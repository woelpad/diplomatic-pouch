<h2>Like The Pouch...?</h2>

If you like The Diplomatic Pouch and aren't ashamed to admit it, we
could use your help.  There are a few places we've come across that
request web page or zine reviews.  However, we feel that we here aren't
exactly impartial and that submitting a review ourselves would be like
stuffing a ballot box.  If you are interested in reviewing the Pouch,
here are a few people who would be interested in hearing your opinion:
<UL>
<LI><a href="http://www.pointcom.com/">The Point</a>, who identify the
top 5% of web sites.  If you think we are up there, here's their
<a href="http://www.pointcom.com/gifs/submit">review page</a>.

<LI><a href="http://www.cnet.com/">c|net</a>, the computer network, 
reviews the best of the web.  Their
<a href="http://www.cnet.com/Content/Reviews/Bestofweb/feedback.html">review
page</a> is located here.

<LI><a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdil">Yahoo! Internet Life</a>, reviews
the "best sites for fun [that's us], profit and personal growth".  Here's their
<a href="http://www.zdnet.com/zdil/cgi-bin/review.cgi">review page</a>.

<LI><a href="http://www.futurenet.co.uk/">FutureNet</a>, an E-Zine with
web site reviews and a section on games.  You have to register to get in,
but they promise that information is kept confidential and won't lead to
junk e-mail.  On the plus side, they say that they won't use your writing
without contacting you to arrange a fee.  See the suggestion box at the
site after registering.

<LI><a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/faint/eziner/">E-Zine Reviews</a> accepts
reviews of any E-zine.  Just follow the submission guidelines link on their
front page. 

</UL>
<HR>

If you do submit a review to one or more of the sites  listed above (or
to any other
site), please accept our thanks in advance and use the short form below
to let us know which one(s).  This feedback to us is anonymous; we just
want to keep an eye out for reviews and remove sites from the list above
once reviews are published.
