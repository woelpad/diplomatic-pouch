    Munchen vote:
    G:3 A:3  (for both risky being OUT| hard luck Austria)
    F:1      (interesting + pointless = goofy)

    boo hoo hoo...
    
    Now you are all morally obliged to proxy me your units...what can be
    more goofy than proxying to an eliminated power?

    Goofy ratings for Fall 1909...
       England: Damn, I crossed up my various 'nor's. I guess I have too many
    nor's--anyone want one?
       Austria: Nice try, one final valiant point.
       France: Geez, why screw up an otherwise wonderful turn? I would have let
    Italy into my capital, and you would have gotten the Beatles at no charge.
    Leapfrog to Greece was a good idea, though.
       Germany: Thanks mucho, but there wasn't much goofy you could do this time
    (Clyde goofier?).
       Italy: Sorry it didn't quite work, would have been a minor coup. But
    you're still dot-grabbing, compadre. Knock it off.
       Russia: Bailing out on *both* fleets before they've completed their
    rounds? I'm so sorry--you should have asked for a center!
    
    --The Silly English K-nnnn-ighit!

    Must be some kind of new record for a turn involving nine potential
    adjustments! If we exchange enough centers to require 34 adjustments, could
    we get the Winter a full day ahead of the Fall?? Warpspeed, indeed!

    Geez, why not? Tell you to go ahead and then screw you up. Or maybe that's
    not goofy after all. Actually I didn't think I was going to bounce you in
    BEL, must have screwed up somehow.
    
    GPs:
    
    A: 2   And we always thought Germany would be the first to go. I'll do a
    		 sympathy proxy for you.
    E: 1   Well, maybe I'll also let England have fun again.
    G: 1   Somewhat gutsy leaving your only center.
    I: 0   Too far, too fast.
    R: 2   Blub, blub, blub.
    T: 1   Why not?

    A tad unfair, donchathink? Italy can easily win this hands down.

    Hands up all those who think Italy will abandon the quest for 18
    centers and proxy all their units to Austria.

    Austria, you have my units.  Use them well.
