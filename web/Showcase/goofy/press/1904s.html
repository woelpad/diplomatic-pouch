    Me thinks, how many more novel goofy moves can we find to do? It appears
    that we have done goofiness to the max. Mayhaps we now need to do goofiness
    to the minimum?

    Sorry to disapoint you, but I've already tried Army Xxx - Orbit
    three times this game for a devastating and unstoppable attack
    behind enemy lines, but the Mother Ship doesn't seem to be responding.
    
    Also, there seems to be something wrong with our colonization
    techniques.	 Either there is a new strain of humans on the planet
    that has developed immunity to modern brainwashing techniques, or
    my technicians are getting soft...	I should enforce discipline
    a bit more thoroughly, I believe.

    well, I tried proxy to master, and proxy to byzantium, and neither
    worked, so there...

    One thing I did think of trying was to proxy to a power which
    had already been eliminated.  Guess I'll have to try it elsewhere (I
    bet it would work!)

    Well, one of the late players has indeed asked for a delay which I didn't
    enter yet as he also provided phased orders. Unluckily some of his
    phased orders could not been parsed correctly leaving her with partial
    orders.
    
    Thus, I shift the deadline as requested. And you, yes you know who you
    are, send in your moves asap. You are just lucky that your co-player
    actually asked for a delay...
