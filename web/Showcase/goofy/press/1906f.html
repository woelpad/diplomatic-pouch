    >Turkey:   Yeah! Destroy the evil Germans!
    
    
    ...er... HEY!!!!!
    
    I thought I did the repentance thing already!  What's this about evil
    Germans???
    
    ....Of course, not that I disagree, just asking.  :)
    
    
    Turkey, I truly enjoyed that last move.  Too bad about clyde... maybe
    we should go to Edinburgh instead?  Russia seems bent on inhabiting
    all of the provinces of the board, and since s/he HASN'T been in Cly
    and is ALREADY in Edi, we might be better popping in there.  What do
    you say?
    
    Oh, and don't worry about me going eliminated quite just yet.  If the
    other players on the board are agreeable, I would like to set a record
    as the first person to own 18 centers (a "victory" in standard) without
    owning *any* of my home centers, and while posessing only a single fleet.
    
    
    
    Sincerely,

    Turkey!!! Great move!! Squishing the German now that he's acheived his dream
    and cannot rebuild is wonderful. Your full retreat contrasts nicely with
    Russia's Manifest Destiny.
    
    Russia!! Weird move!! Saving England from the Turkish invasion, after doing
    your damnedest to occupy us yourself... we applaud your sudden selflessness.
    And your fleets meeting concludes a successful long-term goof.
    
    Austria! Very nice! The Three-Fleets Confusion was great, and made up for
    your options being limited by others ignoring you.
    
    Italy! Going down to the sea to meet the Austrians, then getting stood up!?
    Frustrating, ain't it?
    
    Germany. Too bad. Just ran out of "Goofy Movements for Two Violins"
    
    France.

    Hey! There was a detectable pattern. I cleared out Wales to ensure Russia's
    Lon-Wal, and attempted to undefend Clyde and Lvp. If R is so clumsy he can't
    rape a willing victim, well that's not my fault!
    But this was even worse...

    Ahem. Super Goof hadn't eaten a super peanut lately and therefore
    confused England and Italy. The Silly E.K. is relieved of all accusations.
    MajorDomo is burdened with them (and the punishment going along with it)
    instead.

    Leave out the move of one unit and look what happens. Geez, can't the
    Judge read my mind :-)
    
    Yes, I know, being late is not goofy. Nor is (accidently) revealing my
    secret identity. Aside from the mandatory 50 lashes with a wet noodle, do
    I also get negative goofy points?

    England:  HEY!  Tha's not nice!  2 points.
    
    France:	 Heh.  Anyone who proxies units to Russia is definitely goofy.
    	You get my vote...	2 points.
    
    Russia:	 I am becoming more and more amused with your "Around the World
    in 80 Days" campaign, whether or not that is what you are
    	specifically intending.	 I still think your plan is to occupy
    	every board space in turn...(?)	 2 points, anyways.
    
    Turkey:	 I tried!!	Well, I can't help it if England and Russia are
    spoilsports.  1 point for trying along with me...
    
    >The following units were dislodged:
    >[...]
    >The German Fleet in the Norwegian Sea can retreat to Barents Sea or North Sea

    For those of you who think that it would be un-goofy for me to retreat the
    merciless (former-)master-hunting dinghy Robertjack, and instead want me
    to disband it:  I agree that Germany with three dots and no units would be
    goofy, but I still maintain that it will be much goofier once I have even
    *more* dots... I am hoping for at least a 9-center victory. :)  THEN I will
    be happy to disband the fleet... indeed, I would very much appreciate it.
