	Aha! EXCELLENT goofiness by Italy, proxying the forces in others' capitals.
    MAXIMUM points. WISH I had been bright enough to see it coming! (Take my
    capital--please!--next time.)
    
    French orders were somewhat goofy; Germany proxying his last unit is pretty
    much the best he could do (and why didn't Russia?), but order your own next
	time and let's get that French army to Norway!
    
    Turkish and Italian tripledribbles were fun.
    
    Last chance, and I'm out of ideas... let's see goof one last time, friends!

    Well, we've found out one thing:	the judge won't accept proxy orders
    from a defunct power.  I entered orders for every unit on the board,
    and the judge didn't give me an error message either.

	Oops, what am I talking about?	All those "no order processed" were
	other people's missed proxies.        So, once again, I make the same offer:
    proxy me your units.  Whoever gives me the most proxies will get my
    three points.

    Spring 1910: A0, E2, F1, G0, I2, R1, T1
    
    Austria:  Nice to see you still influence the game somehow. Nice runaway
        moves for those units, too. Too bad the rules say you can't get
	points any more.
	England:  Seems your army still thinks it's convoy time, while your navy
        doesn't. Are you trying to get a fleet into the Med finally?
	France:	  1 point for the Austria proxies.
	Germany:  Will Germany survive? Watch out for the next move!
	Italy:	  The proxies to the various SC owners were amusing, though Rum
	isn't exactly Turkish.
    Russia:   They just don't let you get home. Sigh.
	Turkey:	  I wonder why Austria didn't give you 3 GP. At least you performed
        his idea of head butting in Bla.

    a lot of back points.  Therefore,  I: 3 R: 3 E: 1  (that last point
    would have gone to Austria.  For the good work with the proxies).

    E:  1   Moving the fleet away in face of impending convoys has been done
              before, but since I thought of it first, I'll have to give you
		  a point.
	G:	1	Poor baby.
	I:	1	Hum, the capital proxies were nice, but where was mine? And I didn't
              realize Rumania was part of Turkey.
    R:  2   Poor baby.
    T:  2   An incomplete 'headbutt' is better than none.
    
    It's a lot easier to assign votes with only 5 other players to give them

	Once again, Austria would earn big points if possible. I didn't have time to
    Freeze Frame but found that goofy enough to earn points for F and I (Germany
    needed to be more creative with his *last* unit). One final point for

    Bwa hah!
    This is very funny.  I had entered phase orders to hold all the units
    on the board long before the "Freeze Frame"  idea was mentioned.
    
    Thus, I should not be penalized for going with the flow, but
    certainly should get some credit for participating presciently.
    
    In other words, I want it both ways.
    
    I've entered my retreat, and my goofy votes for both seasons shall be

    Sorry to say that, but votes received after the results of the next
    move are not considered, but instead replaced by the GM's vote. That's
    what you get from phased orders for every unit including yonkers :-)

    G:3 for ending with 0 at the right moment
    E:2 for not having phased hold orders
    I:2 for phased hold orders (though Austria desrves these points really)
    T:0 I already had a proxy order Mos s Sil-War
    F:0 Too many units to think of anything to do with them?
    
    I have not contributed to the press during this game because I was
    playing a simple one track minded Russian Robot trying to tor Europe.
    My goal was simply to get my original 4 units around switzerland & end
    up back in Russia with Stp/Sev & Mos/War reversed.   When I lost one of
    the original units I lost interest for a year or so ..... so I have
    truely forgotten whether my last army was from Moscow or Warsaw.
      I enjoyed the trip and always thought I would make it (especially
    when I had 7 or so sc's which gave me some units to support my
	advances ... for which i always got 'bad' press & 0-1 point).
	
	  Thanks 4 the gee emm in Ronald |	9/10 points (lose 1 pt for sinking

    Folks,
    
    I terminated the game and -presto- the very next message from Russia
    resumed it again. What can I do to permanently terminate the game so
    that identities become revealed etc. etc.? Of course I can set the game
    non-gunboat or become every power agreeing to some made up draw, but
    there should be an easy way for the GM to terminate a game so that
    no player can resume it.

	Austria:  It's really a pity that I can't give you points.
	England:  So you remained in the convoy business until the bitter end.
	France:	  Snapshot. Nice.
	Germany:  Eliminated just in time. Plus snapshot.
	Italy:	  See France.
	Russia:	  You made it! So at least one of your units made the grand tour
	around Switzerland. I've followed its moves and it visited quite
        a number of places: Mos-StP-Fin-Nwy-Swe-Ber-Mun-Bur-Mar-Pie-
        Tyr-Mun-Ber-Sil-War. Too bad your fleets were stopped within sight
        of their home ports.

    Well, now everybody should be able to retrieve the names of the players
    by sending a summary command to the judge. For reasons unknown to me
    the list command however still says 'someone@somewhere' despite the reveal
    flag set.
    
    Any ideas?

<p><a name=39></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=000000>Master:</font></b><pre>
    Hope you don't mind my assuming your identities, but it seemed like
	the only way to terminate the game permanently (with all these nasty
	observers around :-).
	
	I will prepare the final score list, but it may take a few days as I'll
    have other things to do first and as your mass switchings don't make
	things easier.
	
	I will not consider the switchings after fall 1910. For the switchings
	that were performed during the game (A <--> I in before f1907; A <--> F
	between s1909(1) and s1909(2)) the following rule will be applied:
	
	All points will be switched with the player. I.e. Risk Westerman gets
	GP and SC points for Italy from S1901 to S1907, for Austria from F1907
	to S1909(1) and for France from S1909(2) to the end.

	P.S.: EoG statements welcome! I will try to make up one myself when
	  my schedule allows me to.

	I think everyone was a winner. The game interest was kept high even through

	well, they were of the highest caliber goofiness. We did things to the
	Judge that the Judge didn't even know it could do.

	I have already received the first EOG statement for this game.
	I'd love to hear from you others (players and observers) how you
    experienced this "variant". I myself will scribe something up too,
    but most probably I won't have time to do so before monday or tuesday
	next week, as I will not be available after this afternoon for the

    Freddie's EOG:
	
	
	I viewed the goofy format basically as a chance to goof off.
	Never during the game was I concerned with winning so much as trying
	to pull off a few goofy stunts which I hoped would be appreciated.
	I chose Austria, because I think Austria is an inherently
	goofy country.	My next two decision were to use grey press as much as
	possible, and to become a naval power.
	I noticed that both grey and white press were enabled.
	Usually this means that nobody ever uses grey press, except to make an
	occasional sarcastic comment.  I decidedd to use grey press to conduct
	all of my negotiations, thereby making it easy for other players to
	pretend they were me!  Unfortunately, I had to broadcast my votes with
	white press.  Also, toward the end of the game, I did start including
	policy announcements with my votes, so I strayed from this policy a
	little.
	The Freddie persona was born of this line of thought.  My
	original idea was that I was Freddie the Forger, pretending to be
	Austria.  I was impersonating myself!  Later, this name was useful as
	a nickname for Francis Ferdinand, and in "Freddie's Dead."
	So, I started my naval policy.	In 1901, I bypassed Serbia and
	took Greece, so I could build a secon fleet.  In 1902, I took Tunis,
	and convoyed both armies to Africa.	 I built a third fleet.	 I thought
	I was in great shape, as Austria was completely vulnerable.	 Sure
	enough, Italy took the bait, taking half of my SC's, and knocking me
    down to a puny size.
    At this point, I have to comment about the voting.  I feel
    that voting ought to reward players who are pursuing
    long-term goofy strategies.  In my mind, throughout the first half of
    the game, only Germany, Russia, and Austria were doing so.  England
    and France would come up with interesting judge quirks from time to
    time.  Turkey and esp. Italy seemed merley expansionist.
    The definition of goofy I was using was taken from the
    dictionary:  inept, clumsy.  (Also, the part about having proutruding
    teeth REALLY was in there!)  But I saw that voting was not precisely
    folowing those lines.  And, since Italy had stolen all of my actors, I
    thought I'd do something about it.  I came very close to taking over
	France when France went CD once.  I figured such a move would be
	appropriate for this game.	But when Italy, that SC thief, went CD, I
	could not resist.  Freddie was Dead, but Derffie was born.
	For a while, I could not quite figure out what to do with
	Italy.	I wanted to get the fleet into the Channel, and convoy myself
	to England.	 I thought cruising into Scandanavia would be interesting.
	Thus was born the "grab all the capitals"  campaign.  I was never
	looking to win 18 SC's so much as give other players an oppurtunity to
    goofily hand over their capitals.  Also, at about this time I took on
    a new job, which involved my access to Internet being reduced
    somewhat.  I totally missed the time warp, and the last three years
    were largely done via phase orders.
    Some unnoticed goofiness: with phase orders, you can write
    basically whatever you want.  After my phase order NMR, I looked into
    other possibilities.  I declared war upon the GM, by entering
    something like
    phase s1907m
    I declare war upon our Game Master.
    Secretly, anonymously.
    
    Only Robert knew about this, which he could read every time he logged
    in.  Also, at the end of the game (F1910M) I had phased hold orders
    for each of the 64 provinces on the board.  I'm sure Robert enjoyed
	seeing that every time he logged in.  This list included the famous
	Yonkers H.	Sadly, nobody was in Yorkshire.
	
	On the whole, I enjoyed the game.  I thought Germany was the most fun,
	but the rest of you were fairly decent also.  It was interesting to
	seee what kinds of pathological judge quirks we could turn up.	I
	think the voting could be tweaked a little.	 I don't see the purpose
    of SC points.  I am more inclined against them than I was at the
    beginning of the game.
    
    One final point.  This was the second time I impersonated a vampire in
    a gunboat game.  The first was in Guns, which also included Rick
    Westerman.  Rick, did you ever think it was me?
    
    CU all in the funny papers.

    Not quite. The press had a familiar 'feel' to it but it wasn't until
	the end of the game when I saw who you were that I thought to my, "should
    have know it was Desper!"
	
	I'm glad to know you had as hard of a time playing Italy as I did. After
    I realized that having no units was getting me nowhere, I decided to expand
    and try my "headbutt" idea -- too bad you never did this, btw. Either that or
    win with 18 centers which would have also been meta-goofy. Too bad I got
    zapped by not having net access for a week or so.

	There is no way to terminate the game which prevents obnoxious
	observers from restarting it.  However, if you terminate it again,
	maybe they'll behave better now :)
    Also, you could set the deadline to next Januaray (or April).  This
    would at least make sure nobody started the game up while you were
    away, and forced us to lose ded. points for this silly thing.

	End of Game statement from England, 'goofy'
	
	I had a blast. I didn't keep the turn records so I won't write a detailed,
	move-by-move report, but I was consistently surprised at the inventiveness of
	the other players. My unfamiliarity with the Judge meant that most of the
	time I was trying out possibilities which had occured to everyone else a turn
	or turn before!
	
	I pride myself on maintaining certain accomplishments for England: not
	entering the Mid-Atlantic until the final year of the game; repeatedly
	attempting to allow occupation of my home centers; never taking two centers
	from one power and never fighting over neutrals; and, as befits the finest
	navy in Europe, having more failed convoys than any other power.
	
	But I certainly learned more than I taught. Thanks to everyone for the fun,
	especially to Freddie and to GM Robert.

	Well, here it comes: The results of the first (and perhaps only :-)
	game of the goofy variant. And the winner is (ta-dah, drum roll):
	
								   Rick Desper
	
	Congratulations, Rick! According to my rules you may call yourself
	"Goofy of the Year".
	
	A special goofiness beauty award goes to Dan Percival who achieved the
	most pure goofiness points (more than 90% of his total).
	
	Details can be read in the appendix.
	
	As the GM I want to thank all of you for a very entertaining game that
	showed twists in the judge never worked out before. I will try and
	collect a list of goofy things that happened and broadcast it soon.
	
	Thanks again for participating,
	Robert
	
	
	
	---------
	
	Appendix:
	
	Now for the technical stuff (long live Excel :-) and how I assigned the
	points to players:
	
	Replacements are considered together with the player they replaced unless
	there was a switching between two players. Two switchings occurred during
	the game (and are the reason why the GP table contains two entries for
	1907 and 1909):
	
	1) Between the moves of spring 1907 and fall 1907 Rick Desper and Rick
	   Westerman switched Austria and Italy.
	2) Between the first move for spring 1909 and the second move for spring
	   1909 Rick Westerman and Avi Pfeffer switched Italy and France.
	
	Goofy points are assigned to the player ordering the move; SC points are
	assigned to the player controlling that country during the winter of that
	year.

	Ha-ha. I lose the game. That is goofy in anybody's book and thus makes me

<p><a name=71></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=000000>Master:</font></b><pre>
    Actions that struck me as very goofy during this game (in random order
    just as they come to my mind):
    
    
    Russia's idea of traveling around Switzerland with all his units and
	trying to return home just in time. He succeeded with one army, but
	could have almost succeeded with his two fleets as well!
	
	Surprise proxies to others as a way to have a NMR in a non-NMR game.
	
	Helping others into one's own SC.
    
    Supporting yourself in a move (like in A Bur S A Bur-Mun).
    
    Missed supports or convoys from your own units.
    
    Austria having the most fleets around at one time.
    
    Austria having his armies all in Africa.
    
    Having your units move away from home as fast as possible, desperately
    trying to make it to the corners.
    
    The "You first" syndrome (e.g. A Vie S A Gal-Bud, A Gal S A Vie-Bud).
    
    Entering proxy orders, then going CD on purpose but having the judge
    process the proxy orders just because they were there. (Quite a compli-
    cated task to come up with, to perform and obviously also to describe :-)
    
    Switching nations in a game (an absolute NoNo in normal games).
    
    Replaying a move as soon as the chance arose, also an absolute NoNo in
    normal games (a nice judge programmer proved helpful with providing
    the chance :-)
    
    Annoying the GM by endless lists of proxy orders that he gets every
    time he gets some acknowledgement from the judge (I'm very happy that
	Rick came up with that idea that late in the game. Probably it annoyed
	him as much as me, since he got all his proxies listed in every ack'
    just like me :-).
    
    
    Certainly you remember other goofy stuff; please feel free to add to
    my list.

    Other goofy items:
    
       Supporting oneself to another province (paris s paris - bur)
    
       Didn't someone successfully write a support order to move a unit
	to Switzerland?
	
	   Trying to occupy all 7 capitals. Although I still think a 'headbutt'
	would have been better.

	I liked the convoy to Switzerland.	Very inventive.	 After I saw it
	used here, I used a variation in the game Shuppan, where I ordered my
	fleets to convoy forces both to Switzerland and the Himalayas.	(I am
	fairly sure this is the only time the word "Himalayas" has ever
	appeared in a Judge report.)
	
	I liked the war against the GM, the Jeep Jackrobert, the French Civil
	War, the Turkish convoy of my army into his capital (which was erased
	in the Time Warp!), the Turkish army in England, the Russian fleets
	moving through the MAO, the German signature...
	
	I'm a bit embarrassed, after having spent half the game whining about
    SC points, to end up winning because of them.  *blush*  I had felt Dan
    was  a lock to win this game, and I think he deserves recognition for
    getting the most goofy points.  A valiant finish by the Pete should
    also be recognized.
    
    
    So, *snicker*, Nick, do I get HoF points for this?  I think it would
    be hilarious if I were to get into Hall94 based on this game.  :)
    
    Seriously, I think I will try to content myself with the title "The
    Goofball of Internet Diplomacy."

    Yep, that would be me.  In 1901 or 1902, I convoyed a French army to
    Switzerland.  Too bad the silly guy didn't write the corresponding
	order.... :)

    You should be! I was quite relieved to see that my position would have been
    first or second no matter what value was laid on SCs. I felt I was pretty
    ungoofy several turns and would never recover in other players' eyes.
	
	Excellent work by the little guys (Austria, Germany) and I wish more of the
	press had been white so that could have been recognized also.
