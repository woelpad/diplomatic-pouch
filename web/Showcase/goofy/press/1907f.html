    	First, apologies for the ungoofiness of my move.  I feared
    utter extinction this year, and thought I needed a SC.
    
    goofy votes: everything is such a mess that it is hard for me to make
    many distinctions.	I like the Turkish army in Edinburgh, but those
    points I think go to England.
    
    A - E 2 F 1 G 1 I 0 R 2 T 1
    
    France: how can we meet in Piedmont?  I'm in the way? Maybe I could
    convoy A Spa - Pie?  Support from Marseilles?
    
    Turkey:  Don't kill me!  Don't kill me!  ARRRRRGH!  Hmm... I'm already
    undead, you can't kill me!  :P
                    F.F.

    T: My assault upon Constantinople will soon succeed.  Prepare to die!
    (Um, would you be a sport and get out of the way?  Much obliged :)
    I: Face it, your end is nigh!  Get your end out of my face !! :)
    (Stoop for humor!)
    R: You may have your way with Africa, but please don't destroy the
    Cafe Americain.	 It has a special place in my heart.  Say hi to Sam
    for me!
    G: If you get your fleet down here, I'll support you into Spain.      It
    would be grand to meet the JackRobert, finally.  I tried to meet your
    master-hunting army in Syria, but Turkey got in the way.
    E:  The Scots will never forgive you :)

    GM's goofy points for spring 1907
    
    A0, E3, F1, G1, I0, R2, T0
    
    Austria:  Have a nice break with the Marseillaise fish soup.
    England:  Convoying Turkey onto your island looks definitely goofy to
    	me!
    France:	  Well, Gas is as uninspiring for a fleet as was Spa(nc).
    Germany:  1 mercy point for having only one unit.
    Italy:	  I thought your expansion time was over? Not that it mattered;
    	you get no points these years, remember?
    Russia:	  2 point for sticking to your goals.
    Turkey:	  Making it into England is goofy, but that bonus is compensated
    	for by the rest of your actions.

    enough for the girls we're with).
    
    Anyway, the goofy votes....

    England: 3 (for obvious reasons)
    France: 0
    Italy: 0 (sorry, master's orders)
    Germany: 1

    This sounds like a plan to me.  Surrounding countries with fleets in
    these areas, please assist me in such a useless convoy.  Let me pretend
    I'm the Kingfish (former Louisiana governor Huey P. Long) and offer you a
    bribe of all my goofy points for such a goofy move. (Actually, the
    present governor, Edwin "Fast Eddie" Edwards, would probably make the

    Italy - you seem to be getting rather large, so you might be a good ally.
    (Proof:  In regular games, large powers are generally BAD allies
    for very small ones.  Therefore... :)  In any case, would you like

    Minimum score.
    Russia: Doggedness suits you. But it bores me.
    Turkey: Big points for accepting the ride to Edinburgh, losing some ground by

    Hey! Just because the Turk logged on before I did doesn't mean he gets his
    way! I thought lvp-iri-nat-nwg-nth-eng-bre made the most sense, with edi-lvp
    as additional goofiness and still with the potential for a Turk Grand Tour
    next turn.
    
    Now that everyone has committed to edi-edi, I'll do that too (and expect the
    lion's share of the goofiness since I have the lion's share of the units
    involved!). But can we figure-eight Lvp next turn? I've gotta get that army

    get a new one at the price of loosing Austria, then get a new Austria at
    the price of loosing France, and then loose Austria again but get a France
    back. Sigh.
    
    Anyway, we miss a player here. Austrian moves are in, but who knows
    whether a new Austrian player would like them :-) I'll try to get in
    contact with the missing player, but if one of you observers wants to

    	  You will now not accept a DIAS draw.

    Well, after re-reading my own rules :-) I think that voting for a
    draw is perfectly ok. I'm sorry about intervening. Note however that
    if everybody votes YES on a draw (which will terminate the game), this
    will *NOT* be a 7-way draw but a victory of the player with the most
    accumulated points up to then! (Even though ending the game as a 7-way
    draw would of course crown the goofiness of this game [cf. discussion

    all of greater Austria again.

    Austria.
    F: What do you mean? It seems that the cities of Vienna, Budapest, and
    Trieste are well under our control.
    M: Well, yes, we control Austria, but we don't control the Austrian
    forces.
    F: Well, if we don't control the Austrian forces, who does?
    M: Italy.
    F: But we're Italy now!
    M: I should be more specific.  Some "FreddieDomo" is in command of the

    Goofy points for the Fall:
    
    Austria: 0
    England: 3
    France: 2
    Germany: 1
    Italy: 1
    Russia: 0
    
    I appreciate the efforts of those who tried to convoy me around and
    around and around the British Isles.  I would have gone on longer, but
    once you go past one line for orders for a single unit, the Judge gives
    an error message *sigh*.
    
    Anyway, 2 goofies to the French for their suggestion; 1 each to the
    Germans and Italians for their help; and 3 to the English for their help,
    but most importantly, for the bounce.  I couldn't help but chuckle when I
    saw the results.
    
    The Turkish forces are now seasick and will hang around Scotland for a
    while, as any more sea travel would cause us to barf up a lung.

    England, Germany, Italy, Turkey: 1 point each for participating in the
    roundabout.  Although I was expecting you at least to go the other
    way, Turkey.
    
    Russia: 1 point for the surprising change of direction.
    
    Austria: 2 points.  I liked your original move much better.  These
    points are for that one.

    France:  3 points for the attempt to foil the master.  Too bad it didn't
    	come through....
    
    Turkey:	 2 points for the beautiful convoy, as well as helping FreddieDomo
    	or whoever he is now into Con.
    
    England: 2 points for giving me the experience of reading this line:
    
    	Turkey: Army Edinburgh -> North Sea -> English Channel -> Irish Sea -> North Atlantic Ocean -> Norwegian Sea -> North Sea -> English Channel -> Iris
    h Sea -> North Atlantic Ocean -> Norwegian Sea -> North Sea -> English Channel -> Irish Sea -> North Atlantic Ocean -> Norwegian Sea -> Edinburgh.	(

    Now, McCrae, how about supporting me into Liverpool?  After all, I still
    intend to rule the world!

    	(3) Goofy points - I don't care who gets 'em.  I don't want a pickle.
    I just want to ride on my motorcycle.

    Wow. I'm dizzy. I guess I'll let ObsOrvOr go now. Here are my goofy
    points:
    
    E: 3, for foiling Turkey's evil plot to get me dizzy.
    I: 2, for the void supports.
    T: 2, for trying to "help" the Italians out of Rumania. I've always
    	  wished you could do that.

    Well, I guess I can't fault the ObsOrvOr for not being able to count,
    since his GP don't have to add to be seven, but Mr. ObsOrvOr, I did make
    it around England three times!

    What? It DID work! He wound up in Edinburgh, RIGHT? And *I* made sure! Not
    only did I convoy him, but my bounce GUARANTEED he'd end up there!

    Super job by Italy to both be in on the HyperConvoy AND manage two
    simultaneous Alphonse-and-Gaston routines. But I will never grant you any
    points for having lots to play with, Wop, even if you got them in classy
    fashion...
    
    "Austria" and France, I wanted to grant three each for the 'Open Marriage'
    you used to barter countries. But you'll have to do with a minimum score, my
    resources are limited.
    
    Excellent work, Turk. Where do you go from here?
