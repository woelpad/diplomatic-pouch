    Be prepared for a week of vacation from me once my wife returns from

    While I agree with Russia that the new baby's name should have had the
    initials "NMR", I suspect our beloved moderator's wife had some input into
    the decision.
    
    Anyway, congrats on being a father. It can be lots of fun.

    Within a goofy game is it goofy to start grabbing
    build centers just because within a goofy game
    grabbing build centers is considered to be non-goofy
    and therefore to be truely goofy a power should be
    goofy to the squared power and do what everyone

    As of now, the merciless (former-)master-hunting dinghy Robertjack,
    currently at anchor in the Norwegian Sea, is ordered to convoy
    Norway to Clyde.
    
    Also, the merciless (former-)master-hunting Jeep Jackrobert has rebelled
    against the constraints of good taste, and is even now on its way to
    wage vicious war upon the Balkans.  All efforts are being made to recall
    the Jackrobert, but they are maintaining radio silence.

       Broadcast message in goofy:
    
       Within a goofy game is it goofy to start grabbing
       build centers just because within a goofy game
       grabbing build centers is considered to be non-goofy
       and therefore to be truely goofy a power should be
       goofy to the squared power and do what everyone
       else isn't doing?
    
       Or am I just rationalizing?
    
       Goofy is as goofy does.
    
    Sounds like you're just rationalizing.  While it might be contrarian
    to start grabbing build centers, I don't think it would be
    intrinsically goofy just because it is contrarian.	Maybe if you
    managed to get an interesting set of SC's (one from each country, for
    example) it would be goofy.
    
    If you went to a night club, and somebody stood on stage and read the
    stock market report in a dry, business-like manner, would it be funny?
    It would certainly be unusual, but there is more to humor (or
    goofiness, for that matter) than just being different or unexpected.
    
    If the SC count did not figure in towards victory, there might be a
    weak argument in favor of a bold-faced power grab.  I still wouldn't
    buy it.	 As things stand, a SC grab seems like an attempt to grab a
    victory through perverting the spirit of the game.
    
    To me, goofy means silly, stupid, inept, in a slightly humorous
    fashion.  It does not mean merely being non-conformist.

    Austria:  give me support into Con (from Ank) so that we may try your
    idea in the fall.  It will more surprising to see whether this will work
    when we all get a copy of the moves than if I got one of those messages
    from the judge claiming an error in my moves.

    Well, I thought along the same lines when I prepared the call for
    participation for this game:

    >
    > Again, goofiness is in the eye of the beholder. :-)
    
    So, if your co-players consider it goofy to play non-goofy in this
    game, it's a successful strategy. If they don't, you might get no
    points for goofiness. Wait and see...

    Dear Russia:
    I'm sorry, I just don't see how battling a player for the last of his home
    centers is goofy. I guess you force me to undefend myself (which will be
    goofy) but your refusal to participate in convoys and supports with other
    nations strikes me as severely limiting your goof potential.
    
    Good luck, Gen. Noriega!

    I have consulted my on-line dictionary to see how goofy is
    defined, in my attempt to join the current debate on what goofy play
    is.  Here is the entry (I got it by typing webster goofy, even though
    it's the Oxford Dictionary - a goofy fact itself.)
    
    Concise Oxford Dictionary, 8th Ed., Copyright 1991 Oxford Univ. Press
    
    /goofy/ <<"gu:fI>> adj. (/goofier/, /goofiest/)
    1. stupid, silly, daft.
    2. having protruding or crooked front teeth.
    
    /goofily/ adv. /goofiness/ n.
    
    So, it appears that, but #2, I must be the goofiest player on
    the board, due to my teeth!  :{)

    We have consulted the emminent Dr. Beakman, to ask his opinion about
    the "grab the build centers"  strategy.	 His assistan, Lester the Rat,
    also threw is his $.02
    
    BEAKMAN: Fact, the point of the game is to be goofy.  Therefore, the
    player who is goofiest should get the most points.	But playing to
    lose is goofy, so since the object of the game is to be goofy, the
    goofiest player is the player who is least goofy.  So, the goofiest
    player is the least goofy player. But, then, since the least goofy
    player and the goofiest player are getting all of the goofy votes, to
    be truly goofy, one must pursue a strategy of middling goofiness,
    which will ensure that one not become available for top-goofy points
    nor bottom-goofy points.  But, this leads inevitably to the
    middle-goofy points, which cluster around the middle-goof, who is
    trying his best to lose the game by not pursuing either the
    excessively goofy strategy or the excessively non-goofy strategy, in
    an effort to avoid the extremal voting.
    	Even this effort is futile, as...
    
    LESTER: Beakman, where is this going?  *sniffs his tail*
    
    BEAKMAN:  The only possible conclusion is that all strategies are
    equally goofy!	All players should divide their goofy points equally,
    regardless of what happens on the board.
    
    LESTER:	 (stroking his crooked, protruding front teeth) That's the goofiest
    thing I've heard all day!

    Here are the point results so far (including 1905).
    Germany has taken the lead again, and England pushed France back to
    position four. Italy and Turkey are now even.
    
    Interestingly enough, the total ranking is the same as the goofiness
    ranking (except I/T). This should mollify those of you who thought
    that 1.5 points per SC still are too much.

    My votes:
    
    Three points to Turkey. Squishing Germany's army while taking a German
    convoy to Clyde is just gratuitous. I like it.
    
    Two points to England, for vacating. I have spring break next week, and
    vacations are nice.
    
    One point to Austria, for the generally inept moves. It's been done
    before, but still funny.
    
    One point to France, for the same reason.

    Austria:  Rather enjoyable, all told... l pt.
    
    Russia: 3 points out of several that are long overdue.  I am actually
    getting a kick out of your long-winded tour through Europe,
    it is just that there are often moves on the board that are
    more *overtly* goofy.
    
    Turkey: What can I say...?  BEAUTIFUL!  ...Are you a turkey or a turtle?
    Or perhaps an ostritch? Whatever the case, you certainly have your
    head in the sand...  What do you say we try the convoy again next
    season?  3 points.

         ,
    
    I like having you around so much, take Norway from me so that you may
    continue playing in this fun game.  I enjoy this game so much, I wouldn't
    want anyone eliminated so as to deprive them of fun.
    
    I'll move to Sweden and we can try the convoy some other time.

    Basically everybody is goofy except Italy.  Extra points for Germany, who
    has sacrificed everything for goofiness, and for Russia, for continuing to
    adhere to whatever bizarre plan he is using.

    Sorry about the offer to Germany for Norway.  I forgot they owned Sweden
    AND St. Petersburg.  Convoy offer nwy-nrg-cly accepted.
    
    London Ho!

    GM goofiness points for spring 1906
    
    A1, E1, F1, G2, I0, R0, T2
    
    Austria:  Nice variations of destinations for A Tunis.
    England:  It seems the most important thing for your moves is that
    no pattern should be detectable. Let me tell you that you achieved
    your goal this time :-)
    France:   Here came the deserved punishment for being in everybody's way!
    However, I like your preference for Spa(nc), one of the most
    useless spots for a fleet.
    Germany:  2 points for that convoy for Turkey. Also, you're soon to be
    the man without armies but with SC, so you might need the
    points :-)
    Italy:    Still expanding like mad, eh?
    Russia:   Do you stray from your way? Remember your goals! Preventing
    Turkey to get into Clyde was unfair :-)
    Turkey:   Yeah! Destroy the evil Germans!

    R0 - You're seriously trying to win this game, aren't you?
    E0 - I didn't get it
    G1 - Brutally stabbed by the Turk
    I1 - Others have been rewarded for similar tactics
    A2 - A little indecision never hurt anyone
    T3 - Ank-Arm was a nice touch

    Super Goof and the GM have decided to hold a trial.
    
    Accused: The Silly English Knight
    
    Accusation: Revealing Identity
    
    Judge: Super Goof
    
    Accusator: the GM
    
    Defender: none
    
    Sentence: No goofy points from the GM until 1908.
    
    Reasons: omitted because of obviousness
    
    The point assigned to England for spring 1906 has been removed again and
    instead given to Germany.
