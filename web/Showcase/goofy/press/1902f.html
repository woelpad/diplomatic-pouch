    I'm happy to inform you all that I'm very pleased with the goofiness of
    this spring's moves. What amuses me quite a bit is the fact that this
    is the first game I remember where no dislodgements happened during the
    first 3 seasons; definitely goofy! Continue the good stuff!!
    
    Remember to vote and move...

       Movement results for Spring of 1902.  (goofy.004)
    
       Austria: Army Norway Proxy given to Austria.
       Austria: Fleet Denmark Proxy given to Italy.
    
    *smile*
       Austria: Army Greece -> Ionian Sea -> Tunis.
       Austria: Army Vienna -> Trieste.
       Austria: Fleet Ionian Sea CONVOY Army Greece -> Tunis.
       Austria: Fleet Trieste -> Adriatic Sea.
    
       England: Army Norway -> North Sea -> Denmark.
       England: Fleet North Sea CONVOY Army Norway -> Denmark.
       England: Fleet Irish Sea -> Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  (*bounce*)
    Nice convoy.  Especially because it should have failed.  
    2 points
     
       France: Army Spain -> Marseilles.
       France: Army Belgium -> North Sea -> Yorkshire.  (*no convoy*)
       France: Fleet London -> English Channel.
       France: Army Paris -> Gascony.
       France: Fleet Brest -> Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  (*bounce*)
       France: Fleet Marseilles -> Gulf of Lyon.
    
    London - English is OK.  The attempt to use the English fleet
    to invade Yorkshire is humorous.  
    1 point
    
       Germany: Army Kiel -> Ruhr.
       Germany: Army Munich -> Bohemia.
       Germany: Fleet Denmark -> Helgoland Bight.
       Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Prussia.
    
    Very strange.  Fleet in Prussia is nice.  
    1 point
    
       Italy: Army Tuscany -> Rome.
       Italy: Army Venice -> Apulia.
       Italy: Fleet Western Mediterranean -> Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  (*bounce*)
    
    Looks like you thought I would move to Naples.  Strong
    defensive manuever - not goofy.  The MAO bounce is good, but points
    are hard to come  by this turn.
    1 point.
    
       Russia: Army Finland -> Norway.
       Russia: Army Sweden SUPPORT Army Finland -> Norway.
       Russia: Fleet Black Sea -> Constantinople.
       Russia: Fleet Gulf of Bothnia -> Baltic Sea.
    
    Trying to force England to retreat to St. Pete, eh?  It seems
    that he  has outwitted you.  Total lack of response to invading Turks.
    Nice.
    2 points.
    
       Turkey: Army Rumania -> Galicia.
       Turkey: Army Sevastopol -> Ukraine.
       Turkey: Fleet Ankara SUPPORT Russian Fleet Black Sea -> Constantinople.
       Turkey: Fleet Constantinople -> Aegean Sea.
       Turkey: Fleet Smyrna -> Eastern Mediterranean.
    
    As goofy  goes, this is not so goofy.  Much depends on your
    fall moves.  I still think you have passed up major goofiness by
    ignoring  Syria.
    0 points.

    Russia:  Mildly interestinG, but looks mostly like an R/T alliance to me.
    somethinG that I have wanted to pull off in real Games, but never
    seemed to work: 0 Gp.  (Note:  I would consider it *hiGhly* Goofy
    if we were to trade home centers.  What do you say?  You circle
    down throuGh Scandanavia, I slip in throuGh the Barren Zone?)
    
    EnGland:  I must say, norway - nth - denmark tickled my Goofy bone :)  By
    the way, may I have permission to pass throuGh the North Sea next
    turn? : 1 Gp.
    
    France:  The missed convoy was somewhat cute... likewise with your Parisian
    army runninG away into Gascony: 1 Gp.
    
    Italy:  InterestinG... And the three-way bounce in the Mid-Atlantic is
    certainly amusinG: 1 Gp.
    
    Turkey:  Rum - Gal?  Hey!  Get out of my way!  :)  Cute, thouGh...: 1 Gp.
    
    Austria:  Absolutely BEAUTIFUL!  3 points for the proxies plus 2 for
    abandoninG Greece = 3 Gp.
    
    Since the Master and the Observers are obviously holdinG themselves aloof
    from my challenGes, I shall cease includinG them in my Goofy point assiGnment.

    > excuse 3) the judge won't allow me to convoy my fleets like I want
    
    Boy, don't I know it. It took me five sets of orders this turn to get
    *something* the Judge would take (including the now-infamous Nwy-Nwy), and I
    still wasn't happy with what I ended up using. Human GMs are better, they'll
    wink and nudge and go along when they see what you're up to!
    
    And now, the Silly English Evaluation...
    
    Russia:	 Mildly interesting but I could do much sillier things with your
    units. Inviting another raider army keeps score just above nil.
    
    England:  says "thank you very much" to her neighbors.
    
    France:	 Much better. Getting the idea, methinks.
    
    Italy:	We should not repeat the three-way bounce in the Mid. Your crawling
    armies should lift up their eyes to far shores... Points held in abeyence,
    let's see what you do next.
    
    Turkey:  Living up to your spiteful promise, eh? Well, I shall meet you on
    the field of battle and we shall hash this whole thing out, what say? Will
    the Russian carry me to Prussia? Two goofy units out of five is low marks.
    
    Austria:  Beautiful, but I don't appreciate you stealing the
    'convoy-into-a-vacating-center' ploy! Otherwise full marks.
    
    Germany:  Mmmm, good. The 'Four Corners' Offense, no? Best score this turn.

    Sigh. I'm beginning to believe what France mentioned last year -- you can't
    be goofy without a lot of units. I try to be goofy by withdrawing my armies
    away from my borders into my homeland and by moving my fleet further and
    further away from my country. What do I get in return? Bombasts from Austria
    about being "defensive" and few points from the rest of you. Double sigh.
    Subtley is lost. And the area in which to move in is getting constrained.
    
    No really great goofy moves this turn on anyone's part. Russia is being
    a long-term goof by leaving his country open, so I gave him some extra 
    points.
    
    My points:  E: 1
            F: 1   
            G: 1
            R: 2
            A: 1
            T: 1
    
    
    P.S. To Austria. How about convoying APU - ALB? I can convoy TUN - SPA.

    I'm afraid, Game Master, that I had more trouble getting rid of all my
    goofy points than you did... in the end, I had to give everybody one, except
    hat means I have one left over, and there wasn't really a standout in
    goofiness this move... I end up giving the extra point to Turkey for the
    combination of supporting Russia into his own territory and the moves to
    Galicia and the Ukraine.  Italy's would have been better except I remember
    that I suggested that move some time ago... Russia's would have been
    better except the support to norway and the northern fleet look too much
    like a coordinated offensive sweep...  Germany just didn't excite me...
    and the rest (*are here on Gilligan's... no no no no*) were just... well...
    unarresting.

    I am tempted to resign.  I convoy one army to Africa and get
    ready to convoy the other one there too, and get comments from Italy
    and France indicating  boredom and disinterest.   I'm sorry, but
    that's the best I can do.              I seriously wonder what you {\em would} consider
    goofy.  I think France is just splitting his points because he wants
    to win based on his SC count.  
    OKAY, enough whining for now.
    Italy: My fleets will be at your service in the spring, but I
    really want to continue the second half of my African invasion plan.
    Which means Tun - Naf, and Tri - Adr - Ion - Tun.  Then I'll build my
    third fleet and I'll be happy.  
    Turkey: Could you hold off the invasion of  England for one
    phase? I'd be ever so grateful. Also, could you resist the temptation
    to take either Vienna or Budapest?	I need the SC's to build my fleet.
    Germany: I'll make a similar request of you - please do not
    invade Vienna.	At least for this move.
    	Italy(again): I think we can arrange a convoy to Albania in
    the spring, and you could take Serbia in the fall.	The build might
    help.  I'm sorry about the crack about your moves.  
                    F.F.

    Well, firstly here are my goofy points:
    
    A:   Tunis is a very silly place for an austrian army.  I wish you'd
    	 get out of my way, though.	 I need to bring my fleets around to
    	 invade England.  2 points.
    E:	 1 point.
    F:	 1 point for the silly convoy.
    G:	 2 points for managing to get your armies into a position where
    	 they are no use to each other.
    I:	 1 point.
    R:	 0 points.	Supporting a move that actually happens is bad form.

       Wonnerful wonnerful! What a rilly big shoe we have for you tonight,
    folks...
       Austria: Very goofy, and in an ongoing campaign too! Invading the Azores
    next?
       Russia: Some credit for walking off a free center, but you just weren't
    inspired, were you?
       Turkey: Yeah, keep on comin', I can't wait to knock yer block off. De
    bounce in Con was cool, but Shirley intercepting the Austrian army would've
    been more fun?
       Italy: Mild. Wes-NAf would've been pointless for you AND frustrated the
    Austrian.
       France: Excellent. Clearly the best you've done, tie for top marks this
    turn. The ultimate Bel-Hol convoy AND a loop convoy, yet you managed to set
    your other units up for future fun. I guess *that's* the advantage of having
    lots of units early.
       Germany: Wonderful work. Getting the Swiss into play, failing to take a
    center while continuing to expand in every direction... Top marks.

    I smirked a lot.  [not actually an original composition, but shamelessly
    stolen from Queen Elizabeth II]
    
    What is truly astounding, no, amazing, is that the judge accepted an
    order for a movement to Switzerland.
    
    Now that y'all have exhausted nearly the possibilities for goofy
    non-existent convoys, how about some goofy *successful* convoys?

    GM goofiness points for Spring 1902
    
    A3, E1, F0, G1, I1, R0, T1
    
    This was a season in which many goofy things were done, thus it's difficult
    to pick a ranking except for the top goofy set of moves, which were given
    by Austria this time: Proxy-forwarding of foreign units hits me as being
    very goofy (and funny), also the convoy to Tunis and the build of a second
    fleet. Among the rest, I unluckily only have 4 more points to spend, so
    moves which I really consider goofy cannot be valued apropriately. France
    and Russia have to go without points, while EGIT get one each, E for the
    convoy to Denmark, G for spreading its units out into all directions (and
    *all* on non-SC!), I for moving its armies down south (maybe they get convoyed
    to Albania by Austria?) and T for the support of the Russian fleet into Con.
    Btw., my 8th point would have been for Russia.

<p><a name=17></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=bbbb00>Turkey:</font></b><pre>
    Goofy points for this turn:
    
    A:	3.	Very well done.	 You're a complete idiot.  OK, what
    are you going to do next?  Fancy going over to England
    with me?
    
    E:  0.  Being defensive.  You just wait -- I'll fix your little
    	red wagon.
    
    F:	1.	The failed convoys are getting passe.
    
    G:	3 points for discovering you could convoy to switzerland,
    	deduct 1 point for Ruhr-Bur, total of 2 points.
    
    I:	0.
    
    R:	0.	Totally logical attack on Denmark fails to gain any points.
    	I can see what you're aiming at, however, so I'll save some for
    	you next turn.
    
    (Gee, I'm glad I can play this game anonymously.  If any of my allies
    from other games were watching this, they'd abandon me for sure).

    I have decided that it's not neccessary to wait until everybody else voted
    to publish my goofy points. If however anyone of you players thinks I should
    wait until after the next move is processed (like I did up to now) please
    let me know and I will return to that behaviour.
    
    So, here are the GM's goofy points for fall 1902:
    
    A2, E0, F1, G2, I0, R1, T1
    
    My favourites this turn are A and G: A for the two armies in Africa and
    G for his Switzerland idea and his continued attempt to position all units
    as far from each other as possible. The rest is more or less equally goofy,
    but having only 3 points left, two have do without. Since I consider 
    purposefully loosing an SC goofier than taking one or doing void stuff, those 
    who don't get a point are E and I. Of course Italy currently is in a real
    bad position to be goofy. My 8th point would have gone to either I (for
    the attempt of goofy convoys) or to F (who not only left Lon but also 
    ordered this nice convoy Mar-GoL-Mar). Btw. am I correct that the judge
    rejected the corresponding convoy order for F GoL?

    Goofy votes:
    England 0:  Retaking London not so goofy.  Neither is retreat to Kiel.
    You probably deserve at least one point, but points are hard-won.
    
    France 1: Your moves were uncoordinated.  Leaving London was good.  I
    think the Marseilles/Lyon move would have been better if you had
    actually used the convoy.  But that could just be a matter of taste.  
    Incidentally, France could have successfully done the convoy,
    had Lyon ordered c mar - mar.  I've done such a move before, in a
    non-goofy game.	 I had two forces away from the front, and I was
    bored.	
    
    Germany 3: Yes, we can move four forces in four different directions!
    The convoy to Switzerland was good.	 I never knew such an order could
    be written!
    
    Italy 1:  A sympathy point for the attempted convoys.
    
    Russia 1: Guess #1: you are trying to have your forces meet in Spain?
    
    Turkey 1: Forcing Russia to stay in Con is pretty good.	 So are your
    army movements.	 I'll get out of your way now.  I may send my fleets
    in the same general direction, but that does not mean I'll join you in
    the	 war.
    
    	In general, players deserve a lot more points than I have.
    Sorry.

    Well, I would personally Guess that you are planninG on havinG all your
    units meet up in Iberia.  This I would consider to be *extremely* Goofy,
    and I Give you permission to pass freely throuGh my country on your way.
    If it looks like you're GoinG to be able to pull it off, I will Give you
    a base of at least 2 Gp up to the maximum for every year it takes you to
    complete it...
    
    The only favor I ask... could you spare your f con lonG enouGh to help
    me in my attack on Syria?  I am GoinG to lose two units this turn, and so
    I will need a little ouside help.  Also, would you mind if I took stp(sc)?
    Since you are movinG around to re-establish the Great Russian Empire of
    Iberia, you don't really have any use for it... :)
    
    Sincerely,

    aaaaaAAA!  NOW you see my flawless, plan, you hopeless excuse for a game
    master!!!  So, you intended to wipe out my new fleets, eh?	Well, I have
    disguised them as an army and moved them into Russia, so your nefarious
    secret agents have become confused and bewildered and cannot even find a
    good place to buy strudels!
    
    ...But my genius is not only defensive...  Since your location is obviously
    not marked on the map, that leaves only two possible places where your home
    might be... SWITZERLAND and OFF THE EDGE OF THE WORLD!	My attack on 
    Switzerland was going smoothly, except that my French ally forgot to enter
    his order for Gascony -> Switzerland.  On the assault on the edge of the
    board, I am progressing very well, although the silly Turkish bumbler
    continues to hinder my progress with moves to Galicia.	Get you away from
    my way, scoundrel!!	 SYRIA IS MINE!!!!

    You people are too fast for me. 
    
    Anyway, my votes for the fall move:
    
       G:3	 The convoy to Switzerland and the continued moving of all your
    		   units in different directions plus the press. Got to love ya baby!
    
       F:2	 The Mar to Mar via GoL move was good. Too bad you didn't actually
           follow through on it. The move caused a very strange postscript
           bug in the output of my copy of 'mapit'. The proposed convoy of
           Bel to Hol is cute as well. Once again, too bad you aren't actually
    		   doing these moves.
    
       T:1	 Not ganging together to kick Russia out of Con was a good goofy move.
    
       R:0	 You may be heading to Iberia as Germany proposes, but in the
    		   meantime you are just doing normal moves.
    
       E:0	 Almost goofy, but not quite.
    
       A:1	 Not too goofy either but I'm bribing you with a point in order to
           get a convoy so that I can actually be goofy for once!

    Hmmm... The good guesses (Russian units on the western edge of the
    board/Iberia) are taken, so I'll
     go with a short-term but unique idea: Bal C Den-Swe, Swe-Den. I'm sure the

    The Russian will not be sending his units to Spain.	 Already, they
    pine for the native steppes from whence they were spawned, etc. etc.
    
    His units will sweep through central europe and trot smartly home.
    The only question remains: will the attractions of France and Italy
    overwhelm their homesickness, or will they succumb and make a 
    sharp left at Kiel?
    
    So, now that an observer has scooped all your goofy points, you can

       Broadcast message from Austria:
    
       *sigh*  Both armies in Africa, but still "not too goofy."
    
    I was think about this last night as I was going to sleep (shows how
    boring my life is ... thinking about Diplomacy instead of orgies :-) ). Is
    having Austrian armies in Africa a goofy move on Austria's part or a goofy
    move on Italy's part for not having taken Africa in the first place? E.g.,
    Italy didn't do a normal move.
    
    Don't get me wrong. The idea of Austrian African Armies is a neat one. But
    I'm wondering where the credit should go. There is at least one other place
    on the map that this type of situation applies to as well -- Turkey inside
    Russia without Russian resistance.
    
    Just some early morning thoughts.

    Why stop at Iberia when you can go all the way around. I expect we

    (i knOw i  can't prOve it, but the time stamp Of my signOn shOuld give

    amused, and sO i've decided tO Observe! keep up the gOOfy wOrk, guys!
    Oh, and russia, i should add that i knOw  yOur plan! i figured

    Attention!
    
    The GM and all players of this game are ejected from the game due to goofy 
    play. 
    
    This decision seems justified by various comments I received about very
    goofy and meaningless moves by all players. The GM obviously decepted 
    the German player and therefore is ejected as well.
    
    The game will continue without master and players.
