    Heh, the GM caught that too.  I must admit I don't have the rules
    copied anywhere.  OK, here they are:
    A - E 0 F 4 G 3 I 0 R 0 T 0
    Whoops, can't do that either :)
    I'll give it to "you."
    A - E 0 F 3 G 3 I 0 R 1 T 0
    
    You are Russia, right?  :)  If not, Russia deserves the point for
    ignoring the two armies roaming through Russia.
    
                F.F.

    Here are the results of the French jury:
    
    Italy - 0 points.  Ahem, the Mid-Atlantic is DMZ
    
    England - 1 point.  Had to give it to someone
    
    Russia - 1 point.  Ditto
    
    Turkey - 1 point.  Just noticed Serbia unowned.  You deserve some
    credit for that.  (AF, you'll get yours later.)
    
    Germany - 1 point.	Every time you do something good (Sev-Arm) you do
    something bad (Fin-Swe).
    
    Austria - 3 points.	 Neutrality - a wise decision.	Want to try that
    convoy in the spring?

       Broadcast message from Italy in goofy:
    
       > Italy:	   Nice preparation for max. goofiness next year. This time however:
       >	No points.
    
    I>	 Wah!
    
       > Russia:   Go West! ...
    
    I>	I'm going East. Does that count?
    
    But Russia has the head start!  Feel free to collect Serbia,
    which is unowned.  I'm a bit sad about Trieste, as I wished to build
    another fleet.	Well, there is still time for that.
    
    I>	 MajorDomo
    
    I>	 BTW: A: 1	  I'm still confused on what you did.
    
    I used bogus phase orders to trigger the "partial orders
    received"          flag.  There are two ways to trigger that flag:" (1) Submit
    a full set of orders with an error (2) Submit any set of phase orders
    with an error therein.
    The reason I did not broadcast press as Austria was that
    signing on as Austria would have changed the "part" flag to just a
    "no orders received" flag.  That would have spoiled my attempt to NMR.
    The Judge will process through a "part" flag, but not through
    a "late" flag.  But it waits until the end of grace to do so,. which
    is why Robert moved up the end of the grace period.

    Pardon a newbie's reaction, if you please, but it is heartening to see that
    in this sterile, no-misteaks-allowed world of Judge Dip, humans can still
    find ways to tinker with the machines!
    
    As for goofiness: Austria and France score extra, Russia (as >yawn< usual)
    scores none, others keep pluggin' away. Getting harder to develop strange
    strategy, no?
    
    Hey, Freddie, wanna visit Liverpool?? How 'bout it, Italy? Order da convoy,
    or proxy the appropriate units to me!

<p><a name=4></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=808080>Germany:</font></b><pre>
    Austria gets 3 points for finding another clever way to NMR.  Minus two points
    	for collaborating with the ultimate evil of the Universe in order to
    	do so.
    
    England:  Cute random generation of moves... 1 point.
    
    France:	 Absolutely hilarious... 2 points.
    
    Italy:	In anticipation... 1 point.
    
    Russia:	 I'm not quite sure yet, but I think you may be onto something big. :)
    In case I'm wrong, 1 point for now with more to come.
    
    Turkey:	 CUTE!!	 What else can I say...	 1 point
    
    
    One thing that puzzles me... why is fin - swe a "bad" move?	 Have we gone
    the rather legalistic route of Less = Good, More = Bad?	 If you'll notice,
    I was unable to use the build (again) and I knew that would be the case.
    
    My fleet currently in sweden is pushing steadily forward on the quest for
    the edge of the board.  The long route we are taking was made necessary by
    our disguise of the merciless master-hunting fleets as armies, and also by
    the somewhat dissapointing revelation that the crew was unable to carry the
    merciless master-hunting dinghy "Robertjack" through the streets of St.
    Petersburg because of an obscure zoning ordinance.  Much saddened, the crew
    of the Robertjack is continuing their trek along the beaches of Scandanavia.
    
    
    Sincerely,
    
    
    
    ps - Russia is planning on occupying all of the centers on the board in
    succession.

    well if you put it that way...
    
    master, can you find it in your heart to take the point i gave to
    russia and give it to germany?
    
    ps. russia, portugal is mine.

    "Conspiring with the Ultimate Evil of the Universe?"      Ah, too bad you
    did not see the content of my lost phased orders.  A definite strike
    at the GM.
    The only conspiring with Mr. GM (Herr GM?) was arranging for an
    earlier grace, out of courtesy to the other players.
    
    I agree with the German's defense of his moves.  Fin - Swe is hardly
    expansionist.  Along the same lines, I note that my armies have been
    sitting in Africa for a long time immobile.	 Their position is not so
    noteworthy as the fact that my home SC's were completely undefended
    and undefendable.
    
    Look at it this way:  if the game were suddenly declared serious, who
    would do well, and who would fall?  Bogus supports and convoys have
    some humor, but I think real extremism, such as Germany's, ought to be
    rewarded.
    
    I thought possibly that Russia was trying to occupy every SC on the
    board, but he has definitely passed up oppurtunities to expand into
    Austria.  I would like to find out what his strategy is.  As his
    armies get further west, his moves increase in goofiness.

    Besides, my armies have order to board the fleet and sail away. Unfortunately,
    the orders were written so the embarture point is St. Pete.	 :-)

    A1, E3, F0, G1, I0, R1, T1
    
    Austria:  While your not responsible for the almost successful convoy, giving
    	England the chance earns you 1 point.
    England:  Yeah! This time some of your umpteen proxy orders were indeed put
    	to use! Too bad you didn't use *all* units proxied to you. And the
    almost successful convoy to Liverpool would have been even funnier
    if you hadn't put up defense against its success... Nevertheless:
    	3 points.
    France:	  You disrupted a nice convoy! Shame on you!
    Germany:  So it's no round trip around the Baltic. Sigh. But the way you
    chose to StP is also goofy, I think. Seems you may be there earlier
    than Italy, but later than Turkey.
    Italy:    Proxying all units to one nation (known to use them) is goofier
    than proxying them all to different ones.
    Russia:   Go, Russia, go!
    Turkey:   Look who made it to StP first! Also very interesting is the
    reinforcement of your Black Sea fleet.

    Here are the results for 1904. Note that Austria has replaced Germany
    in the leading position, while France overtook England. Russia dropped
    from position 5 to the last position (it seems long-term goofiness does
    not pay as fast as short-term goofiness).
    
    Top-Goofy in 1904 was France with 25 goofy points.

    Hmm, I probably should double check my calculations *before* I send them
    out, not afterwards. My first calculation showed Turkey with three points
    more than actually true. Here's the correction (having Russia on position
    6 and Turkey on 7).
    
    Goofy points sum up to less than the possible 112 since Germany goofed
    up on the voting in both seasons, thus leading to the deduction of those
    points I assigned him.
