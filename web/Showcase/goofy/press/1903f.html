    A:  2
    G:  2
    R:  1
    F:  1
    I:  1
    
    Hey, let's get that army from North Africa into Syria.	From there
    we can convoy it to St Petersburg if the Russians and the English
    do the right thing with their fleets.

    GM votes for spring 1903
    
    
    GM: A3, E0, F1, G1, I1, R0, T1
    
    Austria:  Very goofy! I LOVE it! Giving away control over one of his most
    	important units for home defense (not that anybody in this game
    	seems to care much about home defense :-) *AND* exploring the 
    	possibilities of coastal convoys *AND* doing the perfectly useless
    	army swap in Africa. 
    England:  Also very interesting, but -alas- I only have 7 points to spend.
    	Would have gotten my 8th point.
    France:	  Goofy too. Very defensive moves...
    Germany:  Would have given you two points if the Lvn idea would have been
    	originally yours (don't know, maybe it is?). Nevertheless perfectly
    useless moves otherwise. 
    Italy:    Finally on its way to the 4th SC. And using Austria's fleet made
    	me chuckle quite a bit.
    Russia:	  I recognize that your moves correspond to your outlined idea, but
    	looking at them stand-alone they look less goofy than the moves of
    	e.g. E or F.
    Turkey:	  Good luck on your march north! I too hope that we will see that
    	infamous Syr-StP convoy during this game.

    The results including all of 1901 and 1902
    ==========================================
    
    SC points for 1902:
    	   A	E	 F	  G	   I	R	 T
    SC:	   5	5	 5	  2	   3	6	 4
    ---------------------------------------
    1p:	   5	5	 5	  2	   3	6	 4
    1.5p: 7.5  7.5	7.5	  3	  4.5	9	 6
    2p:	  10   10	10	  4	   6   12	 8
    
    
    And now, the goofy points in 1902:
    
    	   A	 E	   F	 G	   I	 R	   T
    ----------------------------------------------
      SC   7.5	 7.5   7.5	 3	   4.5	 9	   6
      GP  24	10	  16	27	  10	12	  11
    ----------------------------------------------
    1902  31.5	17.5  23.5	30	  14.5	21	  17
    
    Note that I received no vote for fall 1902 from one player, thus the point
    I gave him/her were subtracted again (ok, guess which country it was :-).
    Therefore, the GPs sum up to only 110, not 112 as would have been
    expected.
    
    
    Goofy point totals (1901-1902):
    
    	   A	 E	   F	 G	   I	 R	   T
    ----------------------------------------------
      SC  13.5	12	  16.5	 9	   9	15	  13.5
      GP  37	31	  28	53	  26	30	  17
    ----------------------------------------------
    sum	  50.5	43	  44.5	62	  35	45	  30.5
    rank   2	 5	   4	 1	   6	 3	   7
    
    
    Germany is uncontested leader at the moment (even though having only
    two units!). Austria is second, while the 3rd-5th place are very close
    to each other. Italy and Turkey have yet to prove their real goofiness.
    Note that last and first are still quite closely together, i.e. Turkey may
    easily pass Germany within two years if he/she proves goofier.
    Also, being an eliminated leader surely means loosing leadership fast...

    GOOFY NOTICES... (but he's not telling!)
    
       Turkey: Syria to St. Petersburg is still a long ways off. (Yuck yuck!) But
    I'll try to stay prepared. As for this turn, you did the bare minimum.
       Austria: Wonderful. Two 'unneeded' convoys in one turn, and helping your
    own unit be dislodged. Time to get Out of Africa, methinks.
       Italy: I disagree with the others, your orders were part and parcel of the
    Austrian success. Share his points.
       Germany: I for one did not see the r.g.d. discussion on Lvn so I was more
    objective. I liked it!
       Russia: Your mulberry bush is considerably larger than mine, but with all
    your supply centers you should be able to dance faster! Surprise us next time
    and do something goofy.
       France: Warden of the Coast March, I salute you! With all your lookouts
    and lighthouses, will my fleets be able to sail freely?
       Master: ::scoff scoff:: I blow my nose in the direction of your so-called
    "eighth point," you empty-headed animal! I hereby join Germany's Campaign for
    Real Game Masters and dedicate my press to the eradication of GMs with no
    sense for subtle goofiness!
       ObsOrvOr: !t's gett!ng terr!bly d!ff!cult tO read yOur stuff; Eye am
    gett!ng a m-eye-gra!ne just repl-eye-ng tO !t.
       As for Me and My House: Only one person realized that I occupied every
    English province (mirror-style) in just two seasons. Well, if people think
    THIS mulberry bush was weak, they haven't seen the ultimate in proper British
    etiquette yet.

    Players, the deadline is coming and some of you haven't entered moves yet
    nor voted for the last season. Remember that votes are not accepted after
    the next move is processed (this may be especially important for those
    of you who entered a move but didn't vote).

    E: 3 points! I love the support against your own move to Belgium ven
     more than the triple non-attack on Liverpool.

    G: 1 point for regaining a center, which can only be considered goofy
     in light of the rest of your strategy.
    I: 0 points. I don't get it.
    R: 0 points for being such a meanie, although you did let the Germans
    	 have StP.

    for allowing me to backstab you with your own troops) to convoy my army
    from Apulia to Trieste. This turn, just before the build phase, I walk

    I agree my moves do not appear goofy, currently;
    I certainly deserve between 0 and 1 TOTAL goofy points this season.
    My votes.....
    England 2 (The 1st moves from anyone this game that have actually
    		   made me laugh out loud).
    Austria 2 (Doing his best, worth 1pt but i owe him 1pt of acumulated
    		   0.5 pts).
    Turkey	2 (same comment as to Austria)
    Germany 1 (not really goofy BUT should encourage him in playing a
    		   long term goofy strategy of ultra low sc's)
    France  0 Not particularly impressive compared to the above 3 powers.
    Italy   0 I do see what you are doing but you will have to wait for
          the reward(s) a little longer.

    The Silly English Forecast
    
    Russia is clearly only interested in builds. Nothing at all goofy, one
    moderately polite move in allowing Germany into StP but nothing goofy.
    
    Nice try on Austria's part--I always give credit for attempted moves,
    especially if success hinges on someone else.
    
    Turkey might have intentionally caused the convoy to fail. Support OUT of
    Warsaw could be goofy, could be an alliance with Russia; I'm not impressed.
    
    I like the 'proxy to self,' France--too bad you didn't proxy anything to me,
    I had some fascinating orders submitted for your other units.
    
    The Italian error ("Whaddya mean, I was supposed to CONVOY ??") is cute, and
    with the walk-off the goofiest set of moves this turn.
    
    Germany, your greed is showing! You could have gotten to the edge faster by
    Gal-Ukr! But NOOOOOOoooo! YOU had to go and take a CENTER! But you gain a
    Goof Point back with the AAGH! press item!
    
    Vere Sbor, thank you for being in my cheering section this time! Please
    forward suggestions on which type of mind control I should employ on players!
    
    >>I'd just like to take this time to say that Numerical Analysis is
    >>quite tedious
    >As is actuarial mathematics (Exam 110 is on 15 February)
    As are silly loafing college students! Get out here and work for a living,
    THEN talk about tediousness!

    Unluckily my death strike against my main opponent in this game, Germany,
    hit the wrong player and killed innocent Turkey instead. Sorry, Turkey.
    And of course you see what I am able to do, Germany! Be prepared to die
    as fast as Turkey did.
    
    Since Turkey left us in a surprise action (it seems quite uncommon these
    days to post any reasons for resigning either to the other players or to
    the GM) we will need a new player for that position. The old Turkey did
    leave a remove for winter, but a new player might be interested to give
    that order him/herself.
    
    Maybe some observer wants to jump in? You will have that chance until
    tomorrow, when I will post the opening to r.g.d.
    
    Your friendly GM,
    Robert

    GM votes for fall 1903
    
    GM: A0, E1, F1, G0, I3, R0, T2
    
    Austria:  Nice convoy attempt, but Turkey explicitely mentioned NAf as the
    	source province (not that it would have helped much :-) Otherwise
    	not very goofy. You would have gotten that infamous 8th point.
    England:  The various void supports earned you two points. Taking Bel lost
    	one of them again.
    France:	  Seems you are preparing to defend against that non-present F MAO.
    	I also like the self-proxy which is a funny variant of the proxy
    	to others (which might actually be used, shiver...)
    Germany:  You went for SC, which I think acceptable given your otherwise low
    	chance of being goofy in the future. But: no points
    Italy:	  Superb! First sneaking into a 4th SC and then leaving it again!
    Russia:	  Well, the only goofy thing you did was ordering your
    	broadcasted moves.
    Turkey:	  Too bad Italy and Austria didn't help that convoy to succeed.
    Leaving War in force but ignoring Con seems very goofy to me.

    Oops. I overlooked a email from the old Turkish player explaining his
    resignment. So, s/he's sort of absolved. Nevertheless, I'd expect people
    to have some lookahead on their workload before signing on to a new game...

    Re: The inane "yes you did" "no I didn't" broadcasts of late ...
    
    It is obvious that we have an antithesis of Turkey playing in the game.
    That is, someone with too much time on his/her hands. Must be one of
    those freaking college students. Ah, but to step back to those days.
    Extra time. A young firm body. Young firm girlfriends (or at least
    fantasies thereof :-( ). Gaming everyday. Sigh. No money, but heck,
    who needs that?

    rank   2	 3	   4	 1	   6	 5	   7
    
    
    Note that Russia's lack of goofiness points brought him from 3rd to 5th
    position. Italy and Turkey closed up a bit. Austria's consistently high
    goofiness (and his 5 SC) helped him to get very close to our old and
    new leader, Germany.

    Hi folks,
    
    here's an warning in advance:
    
    My wife is pregnant and expected to deliver on Feb 19th. As you experienced
    parents know, babies rarely adhere to that date. My boss has agreed that I
    can take some days off once the baby decides that it is time to see the
    light, so I might disappear suddenly for a few days, maybe without prior
    warning.
    
    I do hope that the game flow will continue without my intervention should
    the situation occur. Just remember to send me your goofy votes after each
    move, I will compare time stamps to see if they were here in time :-)
    
    Thank you for your understanding,
    Robert
