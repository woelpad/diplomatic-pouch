    What is the sound of one hand clapping?
    
     <silence>
    
    What is the sound of a tree falling in the woods with no one around to listen?
    
     <silence>
    
    What is the sound of a fleet beached upon the sand?
    
     <silence>
    
    Sigh.

    OK - here's my last goofy idea:  to occupy all seven capital cities!
    
    To wit:
    Prussia - Berlin
    Venice - Rome
    Ruhr - Burgundy - Paris
    Rumania - Black Sea - Ankara
    Tyrolia - Vienna
    Irish Sea - Wales - London
    Livonia - St. Pete
    
    Any assistance would be most appreciated!  (Esp. from Turkey!)

    Italy:	Your occupying all capital centers is strictly up to you.

    Does this game end at the end of 1909 or 1910?

    At the rate of playing speed lately, the sooner the better. IMHO.

    Well, my orders are in...and phased until the end of time!

    Hmm... If the object of the game is to be goofier than other players, why
    should one be expected to *help* someone else be goofy? I sincerely hope the
    rest of you *fail* to find new and goofier orders, or at least fail in
    attempting them!

    The rules say (wow, doesn't that sound sound? :-) that the game has
    a hardwired end with the builds of 1910, i.e. 1910 moves are expected
    to be played.
    
    Come on people, only a few more moves!
