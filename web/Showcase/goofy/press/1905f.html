    There has been a coup in the Turkish government since it was learned that
    the ruler of antiquity had horribly poor English and was known to hunt
    snipe in his spare time (also, it just got too damn annoying trying to
    type messages).  The new leader, John Ch'i-McCrae of Thai-British
    ancestry, has but one goal in mind:	 the presence of a Turkish army in
    London.

    next year, provided we have the appropriate fleet moves in the Fall.

    My goofy points for the Spring:
    
    Austria: 0 (why proxy when you could be so creative)
    England: 1 (bribing you to give my homesick army a boat ride)
    France:	 1 (why not)
    Germany: 3 (for taking the Palestinians off my hands)
    Italy:	 1 (see Austria and France)
    Russia:	 1 (see England)

    England: 2pts for what you did with all the proxies... would have been
    	three if you had let naf - lvp go through...
    
    France:	 Definitely cute.  2pts.
    
    Italy: 1pt for participating in ProxyFest.
    
    Turkey: 1pt for beating me to Stp.
    
    
    Now, about last turn's votes... Isn't it true that 5*1 + 1*2 = 7???
    That doesn't look like messing up to me...   So, I would like to have

    Welcome Master McCrae. I would avoid trying to transport an army via the

    Hey! That was a private message to Turkey. How did you manage to read it???
    
    Mr. Moderator: I demand France be thrown out of the game because somehow
    he is reading private mail. He must have purloined your password and

    Imagine a gun to my head. The following is read in an artifical and stilted

       I have been instructed to say that France does not control me. Repeat, I
       am in no way controlled by France. The fact that I made a clerical error
       in the goofy points for France is merely coincidental. That fact that
       I consistently give more goofy points to France is simply because he is
       a better player. I am nothing more than a good acquaintance of France.

    Is Italy revealing his identity or just impersonating somebody else?

    Don't be so quick to report the many other games in which you are

    Argh. I wonder when you selfish Americans *ever* realize that there are
    more than 4 time zones in the world. Time zones that were important when
    none of your ancestors has set a foot on American soil. As you can see
    from the above arrival time, there is a 6 hour difference between the EFF
    time zone and mine (yes, mine!). I was happily watching "Einstein Jr." on
    TV when you sillies had your recent broadcast burstout.
    
    Additionally, you lazy folks sleep when I start working, and have breakfast
    when my lunch is eaten already. So, watch your watch and *never* ask these
    silly questions again. Otherwise you will be *blackballed* (courtesy of
    France).

    It seems you left some of your games out, J*** F***! And there is no

    Of course now everybody knows who always wanted this game to be NMR, sigh.
    Well, you should resign, shouldn't you? At least if setting up a false
    identity is as evil as revealing your real one. However the former may be
    just considered goofy...

    As soon as someone (anonymously) posted that you were not likely to be

    you wonder how I ever survive in grey-press allowed games, eh?
    
    In any case, I am sorry to have offended you.  Now about blackballs...

    Yo folks,
    
    if you want to see something as goofy as the infamous StP-Syr convoy
    happen in reality, watch the next move in game 'puma' on the EFF judge
    which will hopefully see the Austrian army make that long tour.
    Note that 'puma' is not a goofy game, but since the game is almost
    won anyway Dan Percival and I decided to have a little bit fun out
    of it ('puma' is of the 'Intimate' variant which has only two players
    and is won when one of the opponents takes one of his opponent's home SC).

    Oops, I totally forgot that since this is a gunboat game you should
    not sign up to 'puma' as an observer since your address would be
    broadcasted and people *might* guess that you did it due to my
    last announcement.
    
    Hmmm. Well, I will broadcast that move once it got processed for your
    amusement.

    Do not try to weasel yourself out of this one Italy.  You know as well
    as I do that my army moved into Piedmont with your express permission
    and with Austria's too, for the sole purpose of moving to Tyrolia.
    
    If that is not the case, why has it taken you one full year to
    complain about it, or make any move against me?	 Why would I park my
    lone fleet in the North Atlantic if I was making hostile moves towards
    you?  Why would Austria, your game-long ally, support me if I was your
    enemy?
    
    Clearly all the evidence points to the fact that I have put my
    complete trust in your word.  I have now found out that the trust was
    misplaced.	You alone, of all the powers in the game, have blatantly
    broken the CareBear oath.  I call upon all powers to punish you.

    A2, E2, F1, G1, I0, R1, T0
    
    Austria:  Again evil France disallowed your convoy, sigh. Nice attempt
    to dislodge the convoying fleet you wanted to use. Read r.g.d
    lately, didn't you?
    England:  You did (half of) your part to convoy that Austrian army.
    	Of course you should have given the control of A Lvp to Austria,
    	not to Italy...
    France:	  Again you prevented a nice convoy! Shame on you! But your circle
    	convoy made me laugh quite a bit. (2 - 1 = 1 point)
    Germany:  You might get more points again if you indeed to that convoy for
    	Turkey. You got that one point for recognizing the futility of your
    	'war' against me.
    Italy:	  Yeah, go and grow a little bit!
    Russia:	  All these folks don't let you do your moves; what a pity!
    Turkey:	  Not convincing this time; maybe next year?

    Of COURSE I'm going to do the convoy for Turkey!!  Turkey, please
    remember to order A Norway -> Clyde next turn.  It would be a shame
    if your assault on England failed because you forgot about it... :)
    
    I heard an offer last turn to convoy Yasser Aryan back to Germany.  Is
    this still on?  If not, I will have no choice but to commence a brutal
    assault on the Balkans.  The merciless (former-)master-hunting Jeep

    Italy - 0 points.  Did you even bother to read the CareBear oath?
    Austria - 0 points.  Looking for the Beatles in Liverpool is not
    goofy.  Try Sevastopol.
    Russia - 1 point.  For not supporting yourself into the Mid-Atlantic.
    Germany - 1 point.  For helping Turkey against England.
    England - 2 points.  The stuff with Liverpool.
    Turkey - 3 points.  For getting Norway as your 5th center.
