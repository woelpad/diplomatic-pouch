    Hi folks,
    
    our game is back up, but because we are the goofiest ones on this judge,
    of course *WE* *DID* have a move after April 21st. Now it would of course
    be easy to enter your old moves manually and process them.
    
    But, aren't we supposed to be goofy? Who gives a damn about EP house rules
    etc.? Why not redo the move? I.e. I propose that you have time to rethink
    your moves (which already were evaluated in another universe) and have
    a new (and probably different) spring result.
    
    However this is just a proposal and I call you to vote upon it. If any-
    body objects, I will just force the old result to be repeated and you can
    go ahead. You may vote by private email or in public (or not at all, in
    which case your vote obviously is in favour of my proposal :-).
    
    Voting deadline is tomorrow, April 27th, at 10.00 EFF judge time.
    Unless I receive a NO vote until then, I will simply set the game nowait
    and you can do as you please. If I receive a NO vote, I will process
    the old moves and we can simulate that nothing has happened to the game
    at all.

    Hmmm, I'm not really sure how to proceed now. Russia and France went
    CD, and somebody (guess who) jumped right in. I will try to adjust
    dedications once the smoke of the judge crash has cleared.
    
    Here's my current point of view:
    There will be no move until everybody is back in her place (new
    or old :-). Go for it! And remember, we're still voting about replaying
    the last turn (now not only with new moves, but even with new players!).

    Ok, everybody seems to be on board again (though perhaps at a different
    position :-). And I received no complaints about replaying the spring
    season (of course goofiness points will be awarded for both!). Therefore
    I reset the wait flag so that the move can process as soon as those of
    you who did 'set wait' reset their flag or at friday night.
    
    Remember that you do have the chance to move different!

    (scene: The admiral of the fleet is gazing across the sea towards a glorious
    		sunset. An ensign stands by his side.)
    
    Ensign: Sir. I know you are distraught over the loss of your country...
    
    Admiral: (grunt)
    
    Ensign: And I know you are upset about the loss of your supply centers...
    
    Admiral: (louder grunt)
    
    Ensign: And the loss of those seven magnificent armies ...
    
    Admiral: (scowls)
    
    Ensign: But I really think that ... oh my god! land ahead! Admiral, do
    		something! Quickly!
    
    Admiral: (chuckles as his ship grinds it's way onto a sandy beach)
    
    
    *** TIME WARP *** TIME WARP *** TIME WARP *** TIME WARP *** TIME WARP ***
    
    (replay of the scene above)
    
    Admiral: (scowls)
    
    Ensign: But I really think that we should do something active about it,
        not just sail around in circles. Sir.
    
    Admiral: And just what makes you think we are sailing around in circles,
         my young whipper-snapper? I've set our course due west. West,
    		 mind you. Far away from that forsaken land-locked city that
    		 was suppose to be my capital. West, mind you. Back home.
    
    Ensign: But sir, that is ...
    
    Admiral: (scowl) Yes! Are you questioning my judgement?
    
    Ensign: (quickly) No sir!
    
    (weeks pass by, the ship sails up a long windy river to a large city. The
     ensign and admiral are talking again)
    
    Ensign: Ah, sir?
    
    Admiral: (takes a puff on a pipe) Yes?
    
    Ensign: Excuse me for mentioning it, but it doesn't seem like we are in
        Rome.
    
    Admiral: Perhaps not. Well, never mind. This looks like a good place to
         drop the anchor anyway. After all, I've always liked "Paris in
         the springtime".

    G: 1  Sympathy vote, as usual.

    		  a "head butt" IMHO, but good. I doubt if you'll make it though.
    R: 1  Just because.

    Here are the GM's goofy points for the various spring 1909 seasons:
    
    (1) A1, E-, F2, G1, I2, R-, T1
    
    Austria:  1 point for leaving Europe forever
    England:  Your only remaining intent seem to be SC.
    France:   The mass support for Italy's move into Bur made me laugh.
    Germany:  Nice guessed support for the Italians.
    Italy:	  Nice expansionistic attitude.
    Russia:	  Infamous 8th point for you
    Turkey:	  How goofy to proxy F Bla to Italy!
    
    
    (2) A1, E2, F-, G1, I1, R1, T1
    
    Austria:  Did you just do a perfect guess or am I missing something?
    England:  Yeah, at least one person who took advantage of the replay!
    	I admire your Belgium bounce.
    France:	  No goofiness involved yet.
    Germany:  This time you supported Italy via proxy. I liked it.
    Italy:	  Now time becomes short to get into Ankara and Paris...
    Russia:	  1 point since the evil English didn't let you into Nwg
    Turkey:   You weren't very innovative with regards to your moves. But
    	you tried to give Italy what he wanted.
    
    
    
    I still need votes about spring(1) from the following players: AEIGRT
    
    I still need votes about spring(2) from the following players: AFIGRT
    
    No other votes have been received yet. If you sent some, please repeat.
    You may vote for both versions seperately or not, as you please. Just
    indicate if you want the same vote applied to both versions.

    I don't know if the Italian knew (and I know nobody else could have), but
    after I proxied the units to him, _I_ entered the moves to ensure his
    capture of the capitals!!  Of course, he could have entered them himself,
    but I know I did.  A nice function of proxy is that you can enter orders
    for proxied units and the guy who you proxied the unit to wouldn't know
    that you did.  Oh, well, I thought it was goofy.

    Oh, our poor moderator. Figuring out goofy points when people keep
    changing countries and when the judge replays moves. I believe the

    	  T 3
    	  F 3

    Since at the time of version 1, Austria was still France and thus a vote
    for France during version 1 would be a vote for oneself which is, of course,
    illegal.
    
    Or something like that.

    Please leave the moderator's job to the moderator.  I voted as

    I, for one, cannot track who is playing what country. You could all still be
    in your original powers for all I know, and the press fluff is just a decoy.
    I'd be tempted to jump from an eight-dot power to a one-dot power, on the
    theory that this is ultimate goofiness, but I'm not online often enough to
    grab a vacant country and I'm betting nobody would reward the move.

    To clarify: It is illegal to assign points to yourself. Since I do know
    who plays which nation in which turn, I will take care that nobody
    assigns a vote to himself. You should rely on that.

    Goofy points from your GM for fall 1909:
    
    A1, E1, F1, G1, I1, R2, T0
    
    Austria:  Goodbye to somebody who wasn't interested in spending the
    winter in Spain himself. One last charity point for you.
    England:  It's convoy time, isn't it? Pretty useless orders which yet
    hold onto your position. Admirable.
    France:   It might have been played already, but A Par supporting itself
    again looked goofy to me.
    Germany:  Cruising out again looks nice.
    Italy:    Somebody should stop you or you will be at 18 SC next winter :-)
    Otherwise not very surprising.
    Russia:   Finally you make it into Aeg and Nwg! But -alas- maybe too late.
    2 points for your long-term goal.
    Turkey:   I consider you the bad girl this time, not letting Russia back
    home. Your other moves earned you a point, but the one into War
    takes that point away again.
    
    
    Remember that for the last two moves next year you cannot assign points
    to Austria, and the Austrian player can only assign 3 points per move (of
    course she can assign 7 points for fall 1909).
