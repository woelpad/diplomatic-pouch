    Germany,
    
    	yes, like yOu, i am quite prejudiced aGainst the master, whO has nOt
    made even One GOOfy mOve yet! i am currently OrGanizinG an underGrOund mOvement
    tO deceive and distract the enemy while yOu quietly maneuver yOur army/fleet
    units tO the edGe Of the bOard. Once they are in pOsitiOn tO attack the master,
    Our victOry shOuld be ensured, as, i am infOrmed, the master has nO units Of
    his Own!!! yes!!! he is merely scarinG the Other pOwers intO submissiOn, but
    he actually has nO fOrces tO suppOrt his demands On us all!!!
    	fOr nOw, secrecy is absOlutely essential! sO far, i dO nOt believe 
    anybOdy suspects that i have received any cOrrespOndences frOm yOu Or that i
    have been influenced in any way by yOur ideas. sO all is GOOd.

    doing quite well ... no one is talking any more.

    MAKE WAY I MUST PASS THROUGH
    
    
    I am on an inspired mission, and I must be allowed to pass.
    Please keep Galicia clear so that I may continue my assault on the edge of
    the board.

    Insanely stupid? Or maybe just very goofy. I think I'll try it on our
    own very conscientious master. Germany, I am joining your fight. Maybe
    we'll be able to find the master with sonar. Then we'll know which
    edge of the board to go to.

    Talk talk talk talk talk... Nothing but talk! Why should Italy want me to
    *talk* about what I'm going to do? Actions speak louder than words! Goofiness
    is in the EYES (or maybe !s?) of the beholder, not the EARS! Loose lips sink
    English ships! Just because Italy and Austria have broadcast all their plans,
    giving others the opportunity to counteract and outgoof them, I should also
    start thinking out loud? Why should I even be required to think? I will make
    my own choices as to when to think and when not to thank, think you! <thunk>
     
    --The Silly English K-nnnn-ighit!
    
    p.s. to France: dislodge/disrupt the Italian fleet/convoy? Convoy NAf-Wal?
    Convoy Belgium-Ireland? Let's talk.

    Actually I wrote my orders assuming Italy would proxy his
    fleet to me.  Too bad the gig is blown.
    Hey, Kaiser           , I think I see the Master scurrying
    around in Africa.  He has eluded my armies, but I will chase him to
    the end of the Earth.

    Goofy votes:
    A - E 1 F 1 G 2 I 2 R 0 T 1
    Austria: Why are you talking to yourself?
    England: I think you've secured the British Isles :)
    France: F Pie, A Por, and F Spa(nc) are all excellent.
    Germany: The Master will surely fall to your brilliant campaign.
    Italy: Boy, I'm an Idiot! My own fleet used against me!	 Stellar!
    Russia: I know you have something interesting planned, but too
    aggressive.
    Turkey: Too bad I did not use the convoy! :)
