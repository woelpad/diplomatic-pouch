    Your master's votes:
    
    Fall 1906
    
    GM: A0, E0, F0, G2, I0, R3, T2
    Austria:  Nice convoy attempt. 1/2 of 8th point for you.
    England:  Not much to say.
    France:	  You get the other half of my non-existent 8th point for
    	destination MAO.
    Germany:  2 points for that convoy for Turkey. You would have gotten
    	3 if you disbanded that fleet, but I completely agree to your
    	reasoning for not doing so.
    Italy:	  Hope your expansion is over now...
    Russia:	  Leaving Paris again was really goofy, but what I enjoyed most
    	was that anticipation of the English attack onto NWG.
    Turkey:	  Your unit shifting looks goofy to me. To bad you didn't make
    it to Great Britain.

    Despite Russia going down from 6 SC to 3 and Italy going up from 6 SC
    to 9, Russia switched position with Italy.

    Robert, you dingbat! You said, "Russia:   Leaving Paris again was really
    goofy, but what I enjoyed most was that anticipation of the English attack
    onto NWG." Anticipation?! Hell, I *told* him to support me! Don't you read
    the press?
    
    Observers liked my moves, other players didn't... hmm, I'll have to reprogram
    the other players...
    
    Hey Presto! Italy keeps the Nassty Austrians off Italian soil by repelling
    the invading Russians! And even when Italy doesn't proxy to me, his unit (A
    Tyr) still does exactly as I command! Moooohahaha!
    
    Turkey is selling nothing but sour grapes. Don't feel bad, Ahmed, help is on
    the way!
