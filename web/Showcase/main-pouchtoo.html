    <p>Welcome to the Diplomacy Showcase!  This feature of 
      <strong>The Diplomatic Pouch</strong>
      is intended to provide a venue for games of
      interest to the readership.  These games are brought to you for your
      entertainment and edification by other members of the Diplomatic
      community at large. Some of these games are showcased for the
      purpose of elucidating specific topics.	 Others are hard to find
      or not well known variants.	Some are showcased for the
      sheer delight of watching a fun and interesting game.
    </p>
    
    <p>The games showcased here may be of any type, and from any medium
      (email, face to face, postal, judge or hand adjudicated). As a general
      rule, games will be placed in the showcase after they have been
      completed, but a very interesting game in progress might occasionally
      find its way in. Each game will consist of maps, broadcast press (and 
      private press if available), and whatever else will help to make the 
      game's special qualities clear.
    </p>
    
    <p>If there is a game you would like to see in the showcase,
      let me know and I'll put it on the list
      <b>after it's over</b>.
      If you want to see a
      specific type of game in the showcase, get in touch and I'll see if I
      can find a good example.  Showcase requests and questions can be
      directed to me, 
      <strong>Nathan Barnes 
	(<a href="mailto:nathan@diplom.org">nathan@diplom.org</a>)
      </strong>.
      If you've got a game you'd like to suggest for inclusion into this
      document please read <a href="intoshowcase.html">this</a> and then
      email me.
    </p>
