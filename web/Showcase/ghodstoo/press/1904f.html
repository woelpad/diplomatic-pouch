    John: Although I hate to admit it, it looks as if I'm about to fall to
    the cursed A/T duo.  Are you still prepared to move that army in Mars to
    Piedmont and follow it up with a fleet build in the Winter?  I have to
    study the tactics a bit more, but at this point it certainly seems as if
    some help would be appreciated.  I just need to know what my options
    are, hence my query.
    
    Thanx for your time.

    Pitt:  I think it's time we started working together more closely.
    
    In other words:
    
                            HELP!
    
    
    I'm sure you've noticed that there is a game-long alliance emerging out
    of the East with A/T about to steamroll.  Well, you're about to lose the
    only viable ally(ies) you have on this side of the stalemate line.
    
    Is there any way you can see for you (and/or England and/or France) to
    help me stop A/T?  I'd rather not see France in the Med, but a Teutonic
    army or three heading across the plains towards Vienna might enable me
    to hold Edi off long enough for you gain the size you need to handle the
    two of them.  I'm sure Mark could be useful for a year or two doing the
    same thing.
    
    Guess I'm basically playing for a strong second now (always was a
    dreamer...).  Help me now and I'll help you in the long run.
    
    A quick reply would be appreciated.  Grazie.

    Nothing worse than wishful thinking in a Dip game, eh?  We've both been
    guilty of it since turn 1 with the Q Continuum.

    Didn't you take a centre off him last turn?  Or was it the move to
    Sweden?

    I like the idea of A Boh S A Tri-Vie.  That should give Edi something to
    think about as I really think he'll use Albania to cover Serbia (altho
    he MAY decide to cede me Serbia for the one turn it would take them to
    blow it up.

    Still, it keeps one centre out of his hands for one more turn.  That's
    one
    more turn to whisper sweet nothings in Hohn's ear.  Who knows?  Maybe
    the
    horse will sing...

    I've got some writing to do too.  Already wrote to Edi & Hohn this
    morning.
    Guess it's Pitt's turn now.

    Hello, everyone, more machinations, more stabs, more fun.
    
    I remind all of you that I still am interested in more "game summary"
    stuff from your point of view.  What is most useful, of course, are
    comments that do not appear elsewhere in the press, since that stream
    already is saved.  I can't tell you how big it is, since that would be
    private information, but it is not insignificant and will be very
    interesting to review after the game.  Add to that knowledge base!
    
    In addition, I have extended the deadline to Mayday to account for
    a player's trip out of town.  Since I do not believe said player
    made his trip public, I will not reveal which one it is.  Remember
    that I am trying to be very careful not to reveal private information,
    so if you want people to know, you know where the "broadcast" key is.
    
    Great game,
    Jim

    I take that back.... what timing, it at least is semi-public information.
    In any case, I'm assuming that the Thursday deadline will meet Jamie's

    I don't think Germany will be doing much weakening of anyone.  While in all
    likelihood, A Sil will move against AT, it is by no means guaranteed.
    Germany has to be thinking about Russians in Munich.  I know I would.  In
    addition, Nwy-Swe does severe damage to his defenses in the North.
    Certainly, your situation is dire.  If Germany survives a turn, he may find
    the pressure considerably relieved.  Nonetheless, he is not out of the
    woods yet.

    Unfortunately, I am no longer in good position to move against Germany.  My
    armies are two moves away, and my fleets are useless against him.   What

    Germany would come through on his promise to vacate my territory.  He has.

    Thank you  for coming through on your promise to vacate Burgundy.  We are
    now disengaged and can think about how to cooperate more aggressively.   I
    moved to Eng expecting that England would not cover Lvp, and I was correct.
     He told me at the last minute that he would move to Hel.  It does not
    appear to have posed much additional problem for you.   Russia's retreat to
    Sil is by far the larger threat.  (In fact, a French army in Bur could have
    been very useful.)
    
    I would be interested in how you wish to proceed.  Let me know if I can
    support your efforts.  I may find myself involved in the south very soon.

<p><a name=12></a><b>Private message from <font color=00cccc>France</font> to <font color=000000>Master</font>:</b><pre>
    Jim,
    
    Here's how I see things as of Summer 1904.  My alliance with Germany is
    gaining strength.  As things stand, he needs peace with me more than I need
    it with him.  He's in a precarious tactical position, even though R and E
    are declining powers.  If I were to take England's offer of Belgium, for
    instance, Germany could be all but out of this game.  RE would cooperate to
    grab Munich and attack Denmark.
    
    This is tempting, of course, because I would probably be the dominant power
    in a 3-way.  But I intend to take out England and allow Germany to defend
    himself against Russia.  The reason is that I don't see AT losing on either
    front, and they are solid allies, despite Edi's pleas.  Stopping them will
    require a very strong ally.  Germany is better positioned to have the power
    needed than even Russia and England combined.
    
    Italy has finally seen the light and asked me to help him in the Med.  He
    was wise to resist as long as he has.  He must have read The Prince.
    Machiavelli strongly warns against allowing foreign troops in to support
    your cause, for good reason.  I'll help Italy, as long as AT are
    threatening.  I may well end up in a stalemate with no opportunity for
    anything else.  But  I hope that something opens up so I can grab some
    Italian centers.  I might find a way to use Italy's centers to drive a
    wedge between A and T.
    
    The northern front should keep Germany too busy to think about threatening
    me.  Therefore, I should be able to turn most of my forces to the Med.  I
    will probably build all fleets for quite a while to carry this out, and
    because I don't have to fear a land assault.  I hope Germany can turn east
    in time.  I think we need to take out England as quickly as possible.
    
    That's the view from Paris.
    
    John

<p><a name=13></a><b>Private message from <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font> to <font color=008800>Italy</font>:</b><pre>
    Didn't you take a centre off him last turn?  Or was it the move to
    Sweden?
    
    ** No; SWE was always mine, as was Nwy.  he ws mad that I supported
    England two turns ago into Nth Sea, and translated that as "an anti-G
    alliance..." despite the pro-g moves I made this season.  he's just a
    vulutre, as Edi protratys him, basically, and he smells fresh meat.
    
    I like the idea of A Boh S A Tri-Vie.  That should give Edi something to
    think about as I really think he'll use Albania to cover Serbia (altho
    he MAY decide to cede me Serbia for the one turn it would take them to
    blow it up.
    
    ** That's fine.  it doesn't keep me solvent, but hey, who cares if I'm a
    1- or 2-center Russia at this stage?

    but he's at a loss for ways to make that happen, other than perhaps

    take Nwy last turn with two, and he can't take it now with one --
    especially when he's in HEL to boot!  I told Pitt if he REALLY wanted
    good relations, he'd leave Swe...And, knowing that he won't, I see Boh +

    Well, actually, *I* do.  I think your help will be vital if I'm going to
    arrange Hohn and Edi's downfall.  I've already spoken to Pitt about this
    and he seems sympathetic to that cause (he SHOULD as he stands to
    benefit
    most from it).  I think he can be persuaded to help you stay at least
    alive and on our side. He just wants you to lay off him (yeah, yeah, I
    know - quel surprise, but I think it's in your best interest as well).
    The longer you stick around, the better, as anything can happen in this
    game.

    You're depending on GRATITUDE in a Dip game?   Hmmm...
    
    Anyway, I asked him about his willingness to send a unit or two into
    the Med and he agreed.  He said it had just depended on Germany pulling
    back and he did, so France doesn't mind sending units (uh huh, like he
    would).

    I think can Pitt do a lot FOR you by simply not doing anything TO you.
    That and helping take out Jamie ASAP.  Much as I hate to say it, I think
    our chances of stopping A/T will be much improved if England isn't
    around
    as a wild card.  Granted, it removes a threat from Pitt's back, which
    could be very important later, but I'm afraid we have to sacrifice a bit
    of the future to stop A/T in the present.  I've written to France urging
    him to eliminate England before doing anything else) aside from sending
    ME troops, of course...heh heh).
    
    That's all for now
    
    Good luck

    Pitt, we are thinking along very much the same lines.  My view is that we
    need to take England out as fast as we can.  As long as he's alive, we
    can't turn our full attention to the east, which we need to do ASAP.
    
    I look for FG to be a powerful, long-term alliance able to meet AT and, I
    hope, prevail.  Both R and E have sought my help.  Or, more accurately,
    they have offered to help me.  Sure, being number one in a three-way
    alliance is tempting, but a moment's thought shows why I would be a fool to
    take their offers.  AT is solid and growing.  You and I both need strong
    allies to defeat them.  If I were to take the ER offer, I would have a
    major war in the west to contend with while one of my supposed allies -
    Russia - loses centers to AT.   You are on the way to being a dominant
    power, and together we can do no less than force a draw, maybe better.
    
    FYI, I have ordered f iri-lvp and f eng-nth.  I hope the cut of nth helps
    you.
    
    Italy did indeed contact me about assistance.  I have promised it.  I
    should be fully embroiled in the Med within three moves.  Thanks for the
    good word.
    
    Again, let me know how I can help out.

    I'll think about the moves plans.  Go ahead and order your guys
    accordingly, just in case (i.e., assume support to Vienna).  But I make
    no guarantees.  Pitt's so darn concerned NOW, when there's a threat to
    his cetnters; where was his concern for the last two games years, when I
    coul;d have used (and asked FOR) his presence in Sil, in Tyo, etc?  he's
    shedding crocodile tears right now, as far as I'm concerned.
    
    If he leaves Sweden, we have a deal.  otherwise, it will take much more
    convincing for me...and I make no promises.   Hopefully your silver
    tongue will make him see that one center's greed may prove his long-term
    undoing, while returning to the status quo makes me a new convert
    again...

    Would you be willing to let him keep Sweden?  I think he'd be more
    viable
    at three centres in terms of stopping A/T.  I'll understand if you
    refuse,
    but I think we'd be better off if you do.

    John has said he's willing to do this.  He was only waiting to see if
    you
    would vacate his country.

    I've written Mark about this and I'll let you know what he says.  I
    don't
    think he has an awful lot of choice unless, of course, he's totally
    given
    up.  If that appears to be the case, I'll remind him it's a demo game.
    That should work...grin.  I'll probably do a cc letter to the four of us

    Mark:  Got a note from Pitt this morning which sounded fairly
    promising.  As I suspected, he's as concerned about the A/T juggernaut
    as I am and he wants to do something about it.  I believe he's sincere
    for the best of reasons: it's in his self-interest.  If we get an
    anti-A/T coalition of F/G/I/R, Pitt stands to be the one who comes out
    of it the big winner, both position and centre-wise.  Therefore, I
    believe we can work with him.  We'll worry about how to take HIM down to
    size later (with French help, no doubt).
    
    For the immediate future, we really need a German attack across the
    plains towards Austria.  Unfotunately, before he does THAT, he wants
    some assurances that you won't be attacking him.  As a suggestion, I'd
    use the following orders: A Boh s A Tri-Vie; A Sil-War, s by A Mos; A
    Stp s A Mos; F Nwy-Swe.  The last order is in hopes Pitt vacates Swe.
    I'll try to convince him that we need you at at least 3 centres to be
    effective.  These orders should convince him of your anti-A/T
    intentions.
    
    Whaddya say?

    ** I understand your logic, and appreciate the candor.  I have to say,
    though, that I find it hard to see your 'concern' over AT's threat when
    you spend the first three games years saying how I'm to be the Eastern
    Rampart, and then you tear down chunks of the wall from behind.   How
    does keeping a thorn in my paw make for better RG relations?  It just
    makes you out to be as bad as AT when it comes to "helping" folks.   I
    mean, this *is* Diplomacy, and none of us are Mother Theresa, but if I
    was a 1918 German right now, I'd say the "stab in the back" policy
    really _does_ sound right.

    to stave you off, and then you continue the phony baloney by continuing
    to portray him as a "threat" to me.  I don't think either of us believe

    ** True.  Certainly not the best option.  Of course, if I don't attack
    you, you keep one of my centers, I go
    -1 (just from YOU), and probably -2 or -3.  Is that in the Russian's

    Believe me, I've agonized on this one, too.   As much as the grab of Swe
    frosts me, the thought of AT completing killing me off bugs me even
    more.  Man, I wish you weren't in Sweden...
    
    >It's up to you to decide.  I don't know

    ** No, you're on the money, Pitt.  It just boils down to how many
    centers I'd like to have in 1905, is all.  Quite honestly, if I'm a
    2-center Russia, you probably WOULD "turn the vulture" and just
    accelerate my doom, if only to prevent At from doing so....especially if
    I'm in the Far North as a redoubt anyway...si?

    Well, I *have* promised that but he's now hung up on me vacating Sweden.
    He's a funny guy.  When I'm nasty to him, he sucks up to me, in press and
    in his play.  When I try to work with him, he gets threatening and then
    moves against me.  He was apologizing to me and asking to work with me

    That would be my plan.  At the moment, however, he has the upper hand so he

    >Thank you  for coming through on your promise to vacate Burgundy.
    
    You're welcome.  By virtue of your BRE-GAS move, it looks as if you had
    some doubts about my true intentions.
    
    >moved to Eng expecting that England would not cover Lvp, and I was correct.
    > He told me at the last minute that he would move to Hel.  It does not
    >appear to have posed much additional problem for you.
    
    I wouldn't say that.  For starters, I now have to worry about a potential
    supported attack on DEN.  That wouldn't be a big problem except I also need
    to cover MUN and BER.  Additionally, if you were to be thinking about
    stabbing me (I only say *if*...), BEL is exposed.  HEL cuts HOL support and
    NTH and ENG take BEL.
    
    I'm really hoping that you're not thinking along those lines.  However,
    just in case temptation is rearing it's ugly head, please let me point out
    a few things.  One, since helping you to stab England and arise from the
    dead, I have been completely supportive of you and honored all my
    committments.  Two, I am not now, nor likely to be in the foreseeable
    future (barring any action by you which would force me to change my plans),
    any threat to you.  I am engaged with Russia and England and I'm closer to
    the AI front than you.  Three, if you allow England to survive, you'll
    always have him at your back.  He's desperate for an opportunity and he'll
    promise anything to anybody (I now, I've been listening to his entreaties
    ever since we stabbed him).  However, all that will almost certainly change
    once he begins to recover.  I, for one, would much rather have a secure
    rear (we could easily DMZ England after we take those SC's) than have him
    in my rear while I'm trying to deal with activities on the eastern or
    southern fronts.  I can only hope that you feel the same way.
    
    >I would be interested in how you wish to proceed.  Let me know if I can
    >support your efforts.  I may find myself involved in the south very soon.
    
    *That* is exactly how I wish to proceed.  I have been in contact with
    Italy.  He's very concerned about AT.  I've managed to convince him that he
    needs your help in the south to stave off that threat.  He has agreed that
    you should send a couple of fleets that way.  So, you can begin to
    establish a presence down there without having to worry about a
    counter-attack.  You'll be going there at his request!
    
    That will give you another opportunity for expansion (against AT if you
    choose to support Italy or against Italy if not - I'll support you
    whichever way you choose to go).
    
    Let me know what you think.

    Hi Jim,
    Yes, I have to admit, this game has seen me take some lumps.  And JUST
    WHEN I need English input as to a game plan or joint ops, he's off the
    net.  I _really_ need to see if he wants Nwy, or wants to go vs Germany
    (in which case I hit Swe), etc.  "Nice", convenient time to be missing,
    eh?...
    
    Italy is telling me that he thinks I need to jettison England and accede
    to Germany's requests, because in the long run, an FGIR alliance vs AT
    can only work if the English pinpricks vs FG are gone.  There is truth
    to that, but if I jettison my only friend (as it seems now) for the
    benevolence of the guy who just stabbed me in Sweden, well....who knows?
      My problem is if Italy believes that his future is best tied to an FGI
    deal.  If so -- and if I prove unwilling to cut England loose -- then
    Cal may sell me down the river for expediency, also.
    
    The south isn't much better.  Hohn has deliberately lied every turn
    since 1901, which makes me think this was all prearranged way back when.
     If so, then it's a pretty inflexible set of players, unwilling to
    adapt.  Of course, he IS kicking my tail and is in potential to gain
    more from friends and foes alike, so what do I know?!     I mean, I
    thought I had some really game-wreching move proposals for A and T all
    along the line, but they chose to stay firm and continue their alliance.
     Nothing wrong with that, but the game is rapidly becoming predictable.
    Maybe from your vantage point that's not the case, as you See All, Know
    All.  But here in the trenches, life is looking pretty grim.  And to
    think I was the one who enticed Germany to hit England and to call off
    the EI vs France --  who now pays me back with sympathy and little else.
     Funny, these game quirks.
    
    Well, depending on Nwy's status and if I go vs AT, I stand a chance of
    regaining War and/or keeping Mos and StP, meaning a final tally of 3-4
    centers remaining.  In a worst-case environment, Eng gets Nwy, Ger keeps
    Swe, AT guess right on War/Mos, and I'm down to two..or one.
    
    Sigh...I guess I wasn't too far off when I said I was an Intermediate
    player, vice an expert...pretty embarassing.
    
    Thanks for these little notes, Jim.  You're being a SCRUPULOUS enforcer
    of impartiality, and balancing personal notes with official
    observations.  I like it; keep it up!

    I probably shouldn't be propping up those who feel grim and I certainly
    (for ethical reasons if nothing else) can't toss you a bone of hope,
    but I've enjoyed reading your "game-wrenching move proposals" and hope
    they don't completely disappear.... entertainment value and all that,
    if nothing else.  The observers tell me that they are enjoying the
    game immensely.  Remember that my postal/E-Mail szine has about 300
    subbers and they have been (well, at least some of them) watching
    it carefully.

    I really wouldn't say that.  This game has been jarring to everyone to

    has had at least some doubt about whether they should be here.

    As you know, I am that type of GM.  Most judge GMs stay very, very
    far in the background.  I come from the Don Williams school of GMing
    which says that the GM is part of the game, with the balance that the
    particular circumstances of this game imposes on me.

    It is pretty traditional in the Judge E-Mail world to take long summer
    breaks (remember that the backbone of the system is the academic
    world).  In fact many games take the entire summer off!!!
    
    My inclination will be to take a break during all of July if you will
    be away, obviously contingent on your (expected) survival.

    Jim,
    
    If possible, I'd like a deadline extension until Friday, May 2, 1997.  I've
    been incommunicado since last Thursday due to the fact that my wife had eye
    surgery last Friday.  She's home now and doing well but, due to the fact
    that she's confined to bed and, thus, I need to care for her, do everything
    around the house she normally would, as well as earn a living, I have
    little time for anything else.
    
    I expect I'll be able to sneak a bit of time here and there in order to
    diplome during the week but I won't be ready by the deadline, I'm sure.  I
    should be OK by Friday if you can extend until then.
    
    Also, please feel free to let the other players know the reason for the
    extension and that I will be in touch as soon as I can.  Thanks.

    Pitt has asked for the extension to be extended until Friday.  In the
    continuing saga of illnesses, Pitt's wife had eye surgery.  While
    Pitt says she is fine, it has slowed his communication down.
    One presumes that Jamie (and his broken wrist) will appreciate
    the extra time as well.
    
    I am out of town on business from shortly after I send this message until

    I think this is foolish, myself. If/when G and F finish off all other
    contenders in their neighborhood, they might well join arms and try to
    cross the line together. France would merely sail into Italy. The finish
    would then involve T, F, G, in a race.
    
    But, I doubt that Italy has much influence over French or German moves, so
    it doesn't worry me too much.

    Welcome back, My Liege; hope you enjoyed the Steel City.
    
    What shall we consider for the North?  I reviewed your earlier (later?)
    proposal, and--quite naturally--the idea of Nwy-Swe intrigues me
    greatly.  Not only does it allow me to keep a center, but in the event I
    do the "support to den" gambit, or the "hit Mun/Ber" option, it causes
    Pitt maximum consternation.
    
    On that note:  please keep the following close-hold (i.e., even moreso
    than normal correspondence), but I sense Italy is willing to sell you
    down the river in the hopes of keeping AT at bay.  The logical reply is,
    "I'm sure he is," but it's still disquieting.  He thinks that as long as
    you live, FG will be forever mindful of your presence, this diveritng
    them from the True Grail, that of defending vs AT.  He is also likewise
    insistent (in a nice way, of course) that I back off rom attacking Pitt,
    for the same reasons.  The logic is that, if I let Pitt have his way, we
    will first delay the At drive, and then France will be strong enough to
    eventually hit Pitt, in conjunction with whoever's left.  Just wanted to
    give you my "read" of the tea leaves as to Western scuttlebutt regarding
    their desires for you....

    I support faster moves as well, although I have to confess I
    personally haven't had time this past week to answer any press.  So
    long as we can still get liberal deadline extensions in the event of
    unforeseen occurrences, things should be fine, IMO.  I'll try to be
    more diligent in responding to press as well, despite the chaos that
    changing jobs has inflicted upon my life. ;)

    I agree with Edi's assessment.  As you know, I also groused about the
    slow pace, and wondered why we couldn't get moves in on time throughout
    the first couple game-years.   France made the same observation once,
    too, I believe.  Some if it just can't be helped:  a spouse's eye
    surgery, broken bones, bad backs, flu, etc will happen whether the game
    is processed weekly, every third day, or monthly.  But I do agree that
    we are one s-l-o-w-l-y moving game.
    
    Now, having remembered the "people who live in glass houses shouldn't
    throw stones" phrase, I will be just as "guilty" soon enough.  I'll be
    in the field, training cadets, for five WEEKS, starting in July.  (No,
    that DOESN'T mean "kill Faz so he doesn't slow down the game," smart
    guys!)   I will try to find my computer console during that time
    frame--but consider this yet another "game curse" soon to happen.  I
    will meet my end of the deadlines, regardless.  I'm for speeding up the
    game.  It's been days since you non-allies have written me anything,
    anyway -- why stretch out the silence longer?

    Hey guys I know that this game is cursed from a health stand point and all of
    us so far have had serious problems.  Therefore I will suggest that after this
    current delay we go to a 3 or 4 day deadline so that we can advance things
    quicker.  This will give the curse less time to operate on and we can make up
    for the lost time.
    At this rate the game is going at about the same speed as 71BC which was the
    first Demonstration Game in Diplomacy World/Hoosier Archieves.

    Well, Pitt, consider yourself universally chastised!
    
    My feeling is that the role of the GM in these cases is to grant requests
    such as Pitt's and to leave the rest within the game.  Thus, the
    complaints from the players are very much in order, but are (in my view)
    a message to Pitt, rather than a message to me.  Rather than judging
    the relative worth of delay requests, you are on your own with your
    fellow players.  They may "remove the relevance" of your requests, if they
    wish. ;-)

    I do wish to emphasize that shortening the basic deadlines themselves
    is also possible and reasonable as the game moves into later stages.
    
    Is now the time?  I could shorten the move deadline to 96 hours and
    will view that as a proposal.  If I hear no objection to it by the
    upcoming deadline (which is still set as May 2), then I will do that.

    If you support me into Norway, then Russia will be nearly out of the game,
    and I will be able to continue to defend my home centers against France.
    This in itself benefits you because (a) it means Russia is out of your hair

    Hi Jim
    Just a short note; the weight of the world has me right now...hope this
    finds you well!
    
    Russian intentions this turn are pretty straightforward:  support our
    allies (I, E) in their endeavors, and protect what's left of my
    shrinking homeland.  Despite my anger at Germany for his bald-faced
    stab, I realize that fighting him will only allow further, unencumbered
    AT growth--something I can't condone.  To that end, I am trying to "blow
    smoke" vs Pitt, and have him prepare for an attack (vice hitting me);
    maybe he'll even see fit to leave Sweden in the hopes of covering Den
    (fat chance).
    
    France remains an enigma, preferring to play the fence-sitter.  It's
    frustrating, but I wouldn't play it differently if I was him...this
    doesn't help me, and may even hasten England's death.    Eeek.
    
    In the East, I'm bluffing Edi (as he doubtless is doing to me):  While
    I'd love to join an AT vs Germany, I realize they don't want me (Hohn
    doesn't write, Edi writes to smoke me, and they honestly have no need
    for me; I'd get in the way). So rather than aid my tormentors by turning
    on the one bulward against them, I'm going to gut it out and help Italy.
     This move may get him to Vienna, keeping Edi even, or +1 at the most.
    (The interesting moves will come when we see what A and T do with/for
    each other regarding War, Mos, and the Balkans).  I hope against hope
    that Hohn is setting Edi up for the stab, but my policy this season is
    pragmatic:  defense, and hold out from season to season....a pretty
    pathetic game outlook and plan, but not much is left.  Russia is
    considered food for the buzzards, vice a fellow flying scavenger.
    
    By fall I expect to lose Swe and War, going to 3.  Removals will then be
    problematic, based on who's hosing me the most.
    
    Russia will fight to the bloody end.

    Tsar Faz,
    
    Still nothing from the neighbors.
    
    So I would like to go with the original, simple plan.
    
    If you'll leave Norway and support me in, I'll cut A Kie's support so you
    can take Munich. Ok? (To leave Norway, the safe bet is just Nwy-Bar.
    Nwy-Ska might be ok, but I figure you'll want to disband that unit anyway.)
    
    As previously agreed, I'll support you in Stp hereafter, of course.
    
    Cheers!

    For the record, that's what I (and I suspect others) was referring to
    with respect to the "shorter deadlines" issue.  I certainly don't
    begrudge Pitt or anyone else their deadline extensions.

    If anything, I'd like to see move deadlines remain at a week, but move
    up retreats and builds to one day.  For a FTF'er like me, I'm used to
    there not being negotiations (and certainly not extended ones) during
    those phases anyway, although I do adapt when I'm in a PBEM setting.

    Guys:
    My apologies for not writing earlier today.  They were painting the
    basement and the rooms, so once again we were dispersed hither and yon
    after early morning...which means, of course, if anyone sent me anything
    for most of the day, it's somewhere in the queue.  (Today was just a bad
    day for office work, plain and simple -- a long colloquium on UN
    peacekeepers {which I attended, having been one}, followed by family
    stuff.)
    
    So again, I beg your indulgence for my last-day silence.   Nothing
    sinister intended--merely administrative.    To those whom I wrote
    earlier in the week, our arrangements still stand.  I'm looking for a
    break in the persecutions, folks (hint hint), and you'll find me
    amazingly toady-ish and loyal in the process.
    
    More when I next hear from you, or after deadline....good hunting, all.

    Since the order missing is singular and not plural, I'll assume this
    diatribe is aimed at me.  However, I sent in orders within five minutes
    of receiving the Russian RETREAT.  If the Judge didn't receive/process

    I would vote for leaving them at one week, but shortening the
    retreat/build phases considerably.

    Guys:
    I just turned on the machine, and sense that I am somehow at fault for
    not sending in orders.  I see a nastygram and two corresponding
    messages.... Let me explain.
    
    I sent in orders earlier, with certain moves.  It gave me a "normal"
    read.  This morning at 0700,  I accessed the system to see the
    post-deadline  results; nothing came out, meaning someone probably hadn't
    submitted orders.
    
    I decided to change an order based on the fact the 'official' moves
    didn't come out.  When I sent in the change, I got an error read on the
    one unit I changed, but it still listed good stuff at the bottom for the
    rest of my moves.  I assumed (always a dangerous thing) that everything
    was ok, although now that I remember, I did see something about a Russian
    RETREAT for Fall 1904....I never put 2 + 2 together to think something
    was amiss.  That's my, Mr PBEM...
    
    Anyway, I did get my orders in before deadline, and then I tried to game
    the system today; it obviously didn't work.  If I'm the cause of all
    this, I apologize.
    
    I will clear whatever error flag may be out there and resend my orders.
    Jim, my sincere apologies.   It wasn't intentional....why delay my death
    any further?

    Two possible reasons come to mind.
    
    First, there might be something wrong with your mailer. Do you have any
    confirmation from the Judge, saying that it got those orders?
    
    Second, you may have set your ERROR flag; this can make you count as LATE
    even when you have complete moves in. Then when you issue any error-free
    signon, the ERROR flag gets cleared automatically.
    
    I presume Russia has an ERROR flag set now. I can't think of any other way
    he could *become* late well after the deadline!

    Cal,
    
    The Judge was down for about a day during that period and orders submitted
    were lost.  I am 99.99% sure that is what happened to you.  As Jamie
    noted, you need to check to see that the orders came back with the
    Judge adjudication.  If you check your mail file, I suspect you will
    find that to be the case.

    Guys:
    Have removed the red film of disillusion from my eyes, and tried to look
    at the board dispassionately (or as dispassionately a Russian can, after
    being hosed on all sides with no support).  Here's my intention RIGHT NOW
    (subject to whimsical change, of course).
    
    1) Remove Moscow and Silesia.   I can't hold Moscow even with these two
    (War-Mos, Turks support), and they can outguess me all day long.
    2) Bohemia to help Italy for one more turn, until France gets Pie-Tyo
    (I'm assuming that's the intent, isn't it?).  Then, if I still have
    strength left, Boh-Gal in fall.
    
    3)  Pitt, I could REALLY use Sweden back, commensurate with a move of
    SWE-Bothnia on your part.  You could then provide the off-shore support
    for Lvn/StP ad nauseam, thus finalizing northward AT expansion.  I could
    stay solvent at three, providing immesaurable "on-site" support   I mean,
    wouldn't you prefer to have a forward-deployed guy running around in
    Austrian territory, tying down resources?
    
    4)  This jives with my earlier letter.  if you two are genuinely
    concerned with AT expansion, now comes the time to "fish or cut bait:'
    	a) French support via Tyo and/or a southern fleet ENSURES no
    further AT southward/central expansion.
    	b) German moves to Sil and Pru block up the east while their
    greed is focused on the bait of Moscow.  By the time they turn westward,
    your wall will be up.  England (and, I suppose, Russia and Italy) will
    always be there to fill your own greed as you see fit, but for now you
    have a wall and a good defense.
    
    The alternative?  I dunno; you tell me.
    
    Please, guys, this is no smoke; I haven't lied to you yet.  i haven't
    made aggressive moves vs you.  I haven't cooperated with your common
    (English) enemy.   Why the h*** should one stinking center (Swe) matter
    to ensuring security in the East?
    
    What do you say?  Once I hear your reply, I'll make the appropriate
    removals (either these, or otherwise).

    GKJ,
    That hurt.
    yes, another snafu.  Yes, bad play on my part.  but don't subject me to
    being branded a liar, too.  My last two notes should explain what I did,
    what I tried to do, and my sorrow in doing so.
    
    If anything, I should probably de damned as the guy who cared too much
    about others.  Had I done what was best for Russia, I would've attacked
    MUN (obr BER).  But no, I tried to see The Big Picture, what long-term
    effects would come from hitting G, abandoning I, etc.   What a chump.
    
    The best thing for me to do this game, it seems, is to stop upsetting you
    (the ally who feels like he isn't one), to stop supporting Italy (who
    continues to think Hohn is somehow "turnable"), and to punish someone and
    REALLY afect this game.
    
    I think hitting Germany (if that's even do-able anymore) is the way to
    go.  (See my last couple notes.)
    
    You can think what you will, Jamie.  Or you can write Jim-Bob and ask him
    if my moves didn't reflect a genuine attempt to give you Nwy.  But please
    don't blame me for not reading any post-Friday a.m. mail when I couldn't,
    and thus trying to hose you.  I did what I thought we had talked about as
    of the time before you went to Pgh, and was waiting for you to reply
    after talking to F and G.  I'm cursed, it seems.
    
    If this helps, great.  if you're unconvinced, so be it.  In two turns you
    won't need to worry about me anymore.   But you'll have Nwy.  Great.

    Guys:
    As General Richard Ewell said after the Battle of Gettysburg, "There were
    a great many mistakes made  [at the battle...]...Most of them were mine."
      How true for me, also.
    
    First off, there was NO attempted delusion to deny you Norway, Jamie.
    Our mail had discussed two options -- outright transfer to you, and an
    option where I hit Swe while you tried for Den.  As of Thursday, the day
    prior to deadline, we were still debating; you were waiting for any FG
    news.  friday there was no word from you before my systrem was to be shut
    down, so I submitted the "last" option I thought we agreed on:  Swe/Den.
    
    
    On Friday night (and again with my "mea culpa" message on Saturday), I
    figured, "What the heck," and decided to abandon nwy anyway, intending to
    sail for Ska.  I cleared the error message and resubmitted --twice--
    moves of F norway-skagerrak.  This morning, as I opneed the move results
    and my reutnre dmail, I AGAIN had error flags for the move, i.e., not
    allowed!   I can't explain it, other than lack of e-mail finesse.  Jim
    can vouch that I did indeed try twice in the mails to rectify, and both
    times got the error.   I'm bummed by it.
    
    I'm even more bummed by Germany's stubbornness AND by Edi's luck.  In
    retrospect, keeping Italy alive and viable overrode my desire for MUN.
    And, in the bigger picture of things, I honestly feel a strong Germany
    (however odious) is the only thing keeping an AT sweep right now.  That
    may remain to be seen as France gets stronger (maybe we'll see an FT
    sweep later, with attendant stabs), but right now I wanted to use BOH to
    keep Italy at 5, meaning the MUN attack wasn't a 'go.'   How Edi knows
    our moves ahead of time is eerie; why didn't he cover Ser, or attack tri
    again?  DANG,  he's good....
    
    And thern there's the usual fiasco over War/Mos.
    
    Fellows, I'm at an end here.  I am devoid of creative ideas for the rest
    of this turn.  Do I keep a Rump Russia (Stp, Mos and Sil) and attempt to
    attack War ad nauseam?  Do I keep Sil/Boh and spar with Pitt (who now has
    a build coming, and can circle the wagons in Mun/Ber and Den)?    You
    tell me.
    
    Next season I expect Hohn to take Gre with the fleet, have Edi slide
    Gre-Alb, Alb-Ser, have Edi get MOS as compenation for the loss of Grem,
    and have Hohn build another fleet, thus giving them four in position to
    take ION in spring.  Afte rthat, well...the slide begins.
    
    I am looking at one of two options; I could use some immediate input to
    help me out:
    
    Option 1:  remove Boh and Nwy, then order:  StP S Mos, Mos S Sil-War,
    Sil-War
    thus dying a slow death, or
    
    Option 2:  remove Mos and Sil, then go:  Boh helps Italy, StP-Fin,
    Nwy-Ska  (Eng gets Nwy), then in fall I turn on germany with much
    vengance.
    
    If there's better ideas, or if you guys have grander plans, I need to
    hear 'em.  I'm sorry for any computer snafus (Jamie) and for bad luck
    (Cal).  This game has just been a downer.

    Guys
    Congrats on your gains, and on your ability (or your friends' abilities)
    in preventing a unified ER attack on your interests.
    
    I'm down to three.  Neither of you has done _squat_ for the sake of the
    anti-AT, except to feather your nests.  Quite understandable (this *is*
    Diplomacy, after all!), but no longer acceptable.   I have little to
    nothing left to hold off AT, and am now reduced from a "wall" against
    them, to a "speedbump."
    
    As such, I'm either going to remove everything in the west and be your
    Alamo, giving you time to build your forces, or I'm going to stop playing
    the loyal martyr and turn westward with what puny resources I have left.
    
    
    Eastward against my game-long tormentors is the better idea (especially
    for your interests, too), but if you can't promise me survival and some
    MUTUALLY-beneficial ideas (like, staying alive, regaining a center, etc),
    then look for a 180-degree turn against the West.   I have no real
    options left anymore, except "how to die gracefully."  Thanks for giving
    me that option.
    
    King Jean:  If Turkey builds another fleet, then they will force ION in
    F'05.  If you build another fleet, I'd consider helping your Italian
    speedbump, or the potential flood that comes to Pitt's doorstep might lap
    onto your shores by 1906....just a bit of advice from a deaths-door ally
    (ha).

    GKJ,
    I'm more and more hacked off everytime I look at the map.  Mad at myself
    for lost opportunities (this is the part where you smugly say, "I told
    you so, dunderhead"); mad at the SEEMING  "old boy" Edi Loves Pitt Loves
    Hohn network that seems to be bent on destroying the 'lesser ghods' on
    the board, etc.  It's just self-serving whining, I realize, so it's time
    to throw in the crying towel and ready the kamikaze.
    
    I'm probably going to remove MOS and STP, and acknowledge that Edi and
    Hohn's alliance is the dyanmic of the board.  Indirectly, this punishes
    both of your tormentors, too, as they now have foes in all of Russia AND
    Scandinavia (come next year), as well as no eastern wall.
    
    I would urge you to keep HEL and NTH and join me on this ride of the
    Valkyrie:
    
    Nth-Nwy, Hel-Kie (again).    I'd go for MUN and have Nwy-Ska in spring.
    
    Otherwise, remove HEL, keep Lon for Lon-Yor (to cover both your home SCs
    if France creeps along the coast), and still take Nwy anyway.
    
    What do you think?

    Guys:
    Once again, AT shows themselves for the unyielding monolith.  I can't
    fault you for your desire to do what you think is best for your nation,
    but I'm really frustrated at the "old boy network" and the continued
    gang-rape of Russia that proceeded since 1901.  (Of course, I *would* be
    frustrated, given that it's me on the receiving end.  I understand that,
    too.)
    
    Bottom line:  I'm down to 3.  I can abandon everything and head vs Pitt,
    cursing him for his eastward stab.  Or I can continue to try and hold you
    guys off, in essence being the "martyr" for the West, serving as the last
    eastern 'speedbump' on your journey to greatness.
    
    I'm unsure what needs done, but will figure it out in time for moves
    tomorrow.
    
    Congratulations on pounding me into submission.  I truly hope for a
    payback, in spades, somewhere down the line.   I look for an FT finale in
    this one.

    Hi Pitt
    Well, you're in the driver's seat, bitter as the gall it gives (Sweden).
    I listened to Italy this turn (you owe him one) and foreswore my attack
    on BER and/or  the coordinated one with England, figuring a stronger
    Germany is good medicine vs the AT.   But I think it's time for you to
    get off the dime and head east, because your "support" of my forces in
    Scandinavia reduced me in conjunction with Edi's attack....meaning I have
    little to nothing left to hold them off.
    
    If you want to cooperate vs AT, I'd like to hear some mutually-helpful
    plans.  After all, Pitt, when you're in as desperate a strait as I am,
    there's really no logic applied to moves anymore...always a dangerous
    thing.   Are you in this vs AT, or not?

    Your accusation of an old-boy network is belied by my Spring 1901
    moves.  As for why I'm doing what I'm doing, it is indeed based on
    self-interest and my perception of who would be a good ally.
    
    You've stabbed every single one of your neighbors at least once, Mark.

    Do what you feel you need to.  As for Pitt and your alleged
    "martyrdom," well, all I'm going to say is that all may not be as it
    seems.

    Guys:
    As much as I rail against being perpetually attacked, I have to admit
    that you've taken the 'best' (always a relative term) of what R/I have
    thrown at you, and you have persevered and won.  Good show.
    
    As such, I think you'll be somewhat surprised--and pleased--with my
    removals.  Not completely pleased (Edi), because I see myself as the
    Alamo of the East, and promised help to my allies while capable of doing
    so.  This appraoch, of course, _unlike_ some of *my* so-called allies.
    But I digress...
    
    I wish you both well.  The next couple moves will probably see me fade
    to obscurity, so I can only cheer from the sidelines.
