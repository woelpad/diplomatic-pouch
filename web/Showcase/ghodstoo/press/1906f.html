    You know, Jamie, now that you mention it, there have been three guys
    outside my office with eyeholes cut out of newspapers recently....and
    they're wearing black trenchcoats in 80* weather.
    
    Geez, Pitt, if you're really tired, Jamie and I can submit your stuff.
    After all, WE hired the guy to go out and all night and keep you up in
    the first place!

    Hi Guys
    Just got done coloring in the map, and am in a "lull" between
    transportation crises, so figured I'd drop a line.  I'll tell you:
    scheduling 60 VIP academicians, generals, and industry gurus for this
    3-day love-in has not been a bed of roses, but at least it keeps me busy
    (yeah...)   Anyway, here's my game views:
    
    Germany.  I doubt that he expected the French hit.  I think his fatigue
    just led him to the "move of least resistance" this turn.  And it made
    sense.  He covers, sees which way the west and east winds blow, and
    bides his time until E and R die off.  Not a great move, but not a bad
    one.  And he gets a center from Nwy, killing me.
    
    THIS MOVE CONFIRMS MY SUSPICIONS of his pro-east leanings.  Now would've
    been the perfect time to unlimber his fleets and send them eastward, as
    well as prep an army for convoy to the weak north Turkish flank.  But
    instead he sends them in a _westward_ orientation, holds in the center,
    leaving SIL and PRU inviolable, and generally threatening to King Jean.
    *We made the right call, Napoleon IV!!!!!*
    
    Italy.  A shame he lost two to Edi; that could've been Birsan's death
    knell.  Heck, he could've died before ME  :>)  wishful thinking.  I have
    a way to kill Edi as I die, which will be mentioned shortly.
    
    Turkey.  Nice stab.  He probably expected Italy to be firm in Vie and
    Tri, thus really gutting Edi.  Nonetheless, Edi can't take anything back
    from Hohn.   I imagine T/I commmunications will be hot and heavy in the
    next few days.  That's both a boon (kill Edi) and a threat (westward
    ho?), although one easily circumvented by an F/T, John.
    
    Austria.  Doubtless Edi will be pulling out all the stops to get Italy
    reoriented, stabbing Hohn, etc etc...of course, Italy can't get *at*
    Hohn, due to wise positioning by the Perry Mason of the West.  I'd be
    curious if Edi writes anything to you guys about his position.  Maybe I
    can offer "commentary" on his moves in a nice turnabout, hmmm?   To
    misquote Alfred E newman, "What?  Me gloat?"
    
    E/F/R.   Ah, yessss.....now to us, and what should be done.   There are
    several ways to skin this cat, and I think E/F need to make the lion's
    share of the decisions, with me as the witless accomplice.
    
    Option 1:  Faz to Munich and stays alive.
    Boh-Mun (Tyo and Bur S), Mar S Bur, Pic-Bel (Ech S), Nth-Hol.  This may
    or may not work, depending if he does Bel-Bur, Ber S Mun.   England does
    Hel S Nth-Hol, or Hel-Kie.
    
    Option 2:  Faz, ever so loyal, sacrifices self for the Grand Alliance.
    Bur-Mun,  Boh (and Tyo) S Bur-Mun, Mar-Bur, other moves the same
    
    Option 3:  Eastward Ho!  Death to Edi!  Here we work with Italy to
    effect:
    Apu-Tri (Apu C), Ven S;  Tyo-Vie (Boh S), or vice versa.  This assumes
    either a quiet Hohn (mutual holds everywhere) or a greedy Hohn (assuming
    we're hitting Edi and thus capitalizing on simultaneous hits).
    
    GKJ, your options, given that France is allowing you a home survival
    center, seem to be either support for Nth-Hol (if John takes that
    route), or a spoiler, hitting Kie (or outguessing him and going to Den,
    merhaps).
    
    For me, the options depend on French goodwill and logical tactical
    positioning.  I mean, I would LOVE to live and be in either VIE or MUN,
    but if greater circumstances dictate otherwise, then let's discuss it
    and see how I can die with maximum benefit to you both.
    
    I throw myself in prostration before Napoleon IV and beg for the return
    of an ancient fiefdom somewhere as compensation from the rapacious Hun.
    
    
    How doth my friends see this board?

    Thanks for the compliments.  I've been planning this for quite some
    time.  Edi going down to 4 was as good a time as any, I thought.  I'm
    just glad everything went off so well.

    No problem at all.  You graciously did not support VEN-TRI, and that's
    good enough for me.  The "miswritten" order regarding TYS also was a
    particularly neat stroke of genius.  You have my gratitude and
    anticipated cooperation.  Thanks!

    I think you're absolutely right.  We're sitting well, both of us.  I'm
    amenable to whatever reasonable proposal you may have.

    Hi Hohn
    Hope this gets to you before your wedding departure.
    
    Nice stab; all things in their own time, I guess.
    
    Listen, I know you will probably just play it safe and support SER this
    turn, but please consider helping F/I/R eliminate Edi in conjunction
    with my own demise.  Done with max effort, Tri, Vie and possibly Bud can
    go this season.  I mean, you're gaining two off of Edi this turn anyway,
    and probably expected stouter Italian defense up north.  This might be
    the only 'real' cooperation we can do this game for mutual benefit.
    
    Either way, my congrats on a good game.  It'll be F/T with a G spoiler
    to throw his diminishing weight around.

    The Tsar agrees that we should delay the moves until Friday the 13th.
    After all, the East doesn't write to me anyway, so this is an extra day
    of life for my nation.   Plus it gives me an extra day to spin my
    threads of malice around the neck of two Tuetons who done me wrong!
    Who knows, we may even have special edition of "Interview with a
    Vampire, Part II" in honor of the recent rurn of events.  (I *thought* I
    heard a knife balde in the background during that interview.)    Given
    that Pitt is always out on "night surveillance," this merely confirms
    the theme of my show!
    
    Cal, too bad you lost two to BirTeflon.  Having said that, however, his
    position is akin to Custer at the Big Horn:  under siege from three
    directions.  Edi, if you're truly the man I've come to grudgingly
    admire, you will produce yet another Houdini-like escape from the jaws
    of your tormentors.  But I say in reflection:  Would it not be poetic
    justice to have someone else die before (or concurrent with) me?  Ah
    well, wishful thinking....
    
    Great game, guys.  I'm out next season, so I'll withhold mushy goodbyes
    until then.

    You ask, why did I screw you so badly?  I did not intend to.  I wrote you
    early yesterday and I checked mail all day right until the deadline, then
    again after Germany was late.  I got no reply from you.  If I was cryptic
    or you had to have my support, why didn't you write?  We could have at
    least talked about it.  As is, my support for Boh-Mun did not accomplish
    anything, so I wish we had.

    Okay, I should have expected Hohn to lie to me and it was
    hardly a surprise that France screwed me around, but I'm very
    surprised that you did the same thing.  What did I do to you
    that you wouldn't let me know that you and France were going
    to leave me on my own against Austria?  I can understand
    wanting to gain one more centre to stick around, but a
    simple warning would have been nice.

    Well, your vagueness on the army matter has pretty much screwed me
    for this game.  Between your non-support and the Russian "treachery",
    I've lost all the gains I had made over the last two years.  You
    now have to face a Turkey which is going to have at least another four
    Austrian centres virtually unopposed.  You'll be involved with
    Germany and Hohn will be able to do as he pleases.  Can you please
    explain why you screwed me so badly?  I thought you understood that
    I was your best buffer against the East?

    I can give England my centres.  :)

    Guys
    Thanks to Jamie for his usual thorough analysis.  In retrospect, I see I
    was a little cavalier with F Nth and the Germanic fleet threat.
    Actually, I figured that, given a German loss of Mun and.or Hol and Bel,
    Pitt would be reduced and more determined to defend the Reich, vice
    playing Pirate of the High Seas.  Again, though, that's probably not
    reassuring news or views for the Frenchman....what do I know?

    John,
    
    Here's my analysis.
    
    1. You pretty much have to defend Nth, because Germany has little to do
    with the two fleets but attack Nth. You could take Hol and cede control of
    Nth, but I think this would work out badly. Control of Nth is more
    important than the extra center.
    
    2. So if you want to make sure you get Bel, you have to attack with Pic and
    Bur, both. (And either Hel-Hol, or Hel S Nth, Eng S Bur-Bel.)
    
    3. Surely Germany will support Munich from Berlin. My bet is that he will
    also order Bel-Bur, because he is in deep trouble if he loses Munich. So
    you might like to gamble, attacking Bel only with two units, saving F Hel
    for something else. But, Hol-Kie, Den-Kie looks good, rendering F Hel
    pretty much useless.
    
    4. A pretty nice move would be this. My F Hel S Nth. F Eng S Pic-Bel,
    Pic-Bel, Bur-Ruh!, Mar-Bur (probably bouncing A Bel). Unless I miss my
    guess, the German A Hol won't bother supporting A Bel--then A Bel is
    destroyed with no retreat, and you are in Ruhr. Mildly risky, since you
    *might* not take Belgium. But even in that case, you would be in Ruhr, and
    though Germany would get a build there's a good chance that Den-Kie, so he
    couldn't use the build anyway. The real problem would be that you wouldn't
    have the new fleet to bring into play.
    
    
    
    Assuming no trouble in the Med., and assuming you could get into Ruhr and
    also take Bel, I think you would solidly have the upper hand in the mess
    with Germany. My F Hel, a new fleet for you swinging up over England, your
    A Tyo, and an army penetrated to Ruhr, these are each a small advantage,
    and they add up to a decisive one. I think you would have little trouble
    adding Hol next year, and likely Munich the following year. At that point
    you would clearly have a big advantage, and the Mediterranean powers might
    start getting worried, or maybe *you* would have to start seriously
    worrying about Turkey's chances of winning, I haven't looked into that. But
    as long as you can feel safe with that single fleet in the Med., I am
    pretty sure you would continue to make slow progress against Germany.
    
    
    
    The safe approach leaves you in Bel, Bur, Tyo. (Germany would be in Mun,
    Ruh, Hol, but not in Kie.) But then you have to guess to make future
    progress, and (I think) any real attacking move leaves you open to losing
    some ground (Bel, or control of Bur). This is probably ok, you probably
    still have the upper hand, *if* you feel you have all the time in the
    world, or if you think Turkey will bother the Germans from behind.
    (Unlikely, I think. I am not pointing out, you'll notice, that you were
    utterly wrong about Turkey and Austria holding together!)
    
    
    
    I was thinking that Russia could not realistically be kept alive. I now
    think maybe his idea of Eng S Pic-Bel, Bur&Tyo S Boh-Mun (Hel S Nth) might
    be reasonable. But the problems I mentioned in the press to fr are
    worrying, and if you do get Bel and not Mun, you are not in a great
    position without an army in Ruhr.
    
    The move I outlined against Austria doesn't help you or me at all, but it
    is so aesthetically appealing I just couldn't keep my mouth shut.
    
    Let me know what you want me to do.
    
    And the best of luck,

    Comrades,
    
    Glad to see the Tsar in good spirits.
    
    I think there is one glaring flaw in the Tsar's analysis. France must
    defend the North Sea. Germany has nothing to do with the two fleets (Ska &
    Nwy) but Nwy S Ska-Nth. In point of fact, we could swipe both Bel and Hol
    for the French, if Napolean is willing to give up his North Sea position --
    but I must say I do not recommend this.
    
    I will have my own full analysis ready later, if you want it. Here now a
    few critical remarks on Faz's. (Upon re-reading, I see they turned out
    somewhat lengthy....)
    
    
    >Option 1:  Faz to Munich and stays alive.
    >Boh-Mun (Tyo and Bur S), Mar S Bur, Pic-Bel (Ech S), Nth-Hol.  This may
    >or may not work, depending if he does Bel-Bur, Ber S Mun.   England does
    >Hel S Nth-Hol, or Hel-Kie.
    
    This option is pretty good, actually. I thought it through wrongly before.
    
    The problem is that the French F Nth must not move. Even so, the move snags
    either Munich or Belgium, leaving Germany even. If he protects Munich by A
    Bel-Bur, then the move is turns out essentially the same as (a reasonable
    variant of) Option 3, with France in Burg and owning Bel, Germany stuck
    defending with a big cluster of five armies against France's superior
    position (but smaller land contingent). Here I think France has a *small*
    advantage. If Germany defends Bel, he loses Munich, which is very bad for
    him. But the drawback is that France gets no build, and he really does need
    to build a new fleet and start it heading around England for Nwg.
    
    >Option 2:  Faz, ever so loyal, sacrifices self for the Grand Alliance.
    >Bur-Mun,  Boh (and Tyo) S Bur-Mun, Mar-Bur, other moves the same
    
    This option is best for France. Faz should investigate his alternatives
    with Italy and see whether he's really willing to make the sacrifice.
    
    Here France could either try for Bel *and* Mun, with Mun assured, or he
    could settle for Mun and a really good position, by ordering Pic S Mar-Bur,
    while Eng S Nth and my fleet tries some trick or other (I have an idea).
    
    A wild possibility is to take Bel, Hol, and Mun. This is a *lock*, if Faz
    sacrifices, but Germany will enter Nth. He is quite likely to get Edinburgh
    and Liverpool the next year, but my fleet takes Kiel (I break even as
    France enters London, France loses one--this is 1907 I'm talking about--and
    Russia is already dead). As I said, a very wild position. Germany must
    scramble around with six units, unable to defend the Fatherland but running
    rampant in Scand and England. When Germany gains, he has no place to build.
    Mopping up is messy. I probably don't make it to witness the endgame, but
    taking a German home center would be fun.
    
    
    >Option 3:  Eastward Ho!  Death to Edi!  Here we work with Italy to
    >effect:
    >Apu-Tri (Apu C), Ven S;  Tyo-Vie (Boh S), or vice versa.  This assumes
    >either a quiet Hohn (mutual holds everywhere) or a greedy Hohn (assuming
    >we're hitting Edi and thus capitalizing on simultaneous hits).
    
    If Hohn goes for this, it looks quite good. (The "Apu C" ought to read "Adr
    C", of course.) Hohn could order the spectacular move, Rum-Bud!, Ser S
    Rum-Bud!, Gre-Alb!  These moves are almost unbelievable, since the natural
    expectation is that Turkey will sit on the new centers and certainly not
    order his units *out* of them; but in fact the move is utterly safe, since
    (a) the Austrian fleet *cannot* get out of Alb, so Turkey holds Gre, and
    (b) every possible Austrian support is cut, so Ser is safe. It leaves
    Austria with a mere *two* centers. Maybe Austria orders Tri-Tyo, but this
    seems quite unlikely, and in that case he loses Budapest.
    
    The problem is that it leaves Germany relatively unmolested. But France
    still has good chances, even without the Russian help. I don't know.
    John/Nap, think about it. Do you want to see Austria collapse so quickly?
    (I suspect not. Edi is a goner. Making his death slow tends to slow down
    the development of any difficulties Napoleon might have in the
    Mediterranean.)
    
    
    
    >GKJ, your options, given that France is allowing you a home survival
    >center, seem to be either support for Nth-Hol (if John takes that
    >route), or a spoiler, hitting Kie (or outguessing him and going to Den,
    >merhaps).
    
    I feel quite safe now, thanks. It is very clear that my fleet helps the
    Empereur a lot, much more than a new unit of his own could do.
    I've outlined my view of my fleet's options. I actually think it will not
    be very helpful this move. My guess for Pitt's approach is that he will
    give up on Belgium, try to defend Munich with all forces (thus, Bel-Bur,
    Ber S Mun), lash out at Nth (Nwy S Ska-Nth), and order Hol-Kie, Den-Kie to
    defend all three of those centers against a sneaky British fleet. I am
    inclined either to order Hel S Nth, leaving the English F Eng to support an
    attack on Bel, or, well, a trick, which I reserve to a later note.
    
    >For me, the options depend on French goodwill and logical tactical
    >positioning.  I mean, I would LOVE to live and be in either VIE or MUN,
    >but if greater circumstances dictate otherwise, then let's discuss it
    >and see how I can die with maximum benefit to you both.
    
    Good show, old chap.
    
    Have a chat with Brother Calvin and His Most Excellent Sultan. Shall I
    broach the topic with him (with Hohn)?
    
    And let's see what His Other Excellency Bonaparte thinks...?

    Hi Cal
    Well, first off, my moving to MUN shouldn't have been a big killer to
    you.  I mean, had I done what I intended (moving to GAL), I would've
    thrown a fist at air and moved into something Edi was moving out of.  I
    couldn't have helped you, in retrospect, moving to GAL.
    
    France offered support and then wavered.  I figured, well...if I move to
    GAL I know the probable result.  But if France is telling the truth, I
    at least have a chance to hurt Pitt.  Now, having France leave you in
    the lurch was chintzy, but he made the call that he wanted to try it --
    Big Picture vs Germany.
    
    I apologize for not telling you anything.  E/F both thought, for
    interests of Absolute Secrecy -- to avoid even a casual slip -- that we
    should all be mum on this.  I can see where you feel wronged, but at the
    time, we figured you'd be able to hold your ground.  And again, Cal,
    honestly:  my going to GAL wouldn't have changed a thing regarding moves
    vs you, and I didn't know if France was being truthful or not.  I just
    wanted to do something for me this turn, is all.  I'm absolutely crushed
    that it cost you two centers.  I would think France is, too.
    
    Now, the "brighter" side:  Hohn is seriously discussing simultaneous
    crushing of Edi.  France is also interested.  One option would be
    Apu-Tri (Adr C), Ven S, with either France or me hitting Vie (and the
    other in support).  if that is done (and if Hohn moves, versus
    supports-in-place) Edi stands to lose Tri and Vie again.  One for sure.
    
    Cal, I'm on the way out.  No matter what option E/F (and you) decide on,
    it's doubtful I'll get the center.  I'm willing to do anything you want
    -- I think my entire game behavior towards you has shown utterly loyalty
    and doing what I've said, has it not?  In that vein, I'm willing to help
    you with this last season's breath of life I have left.  But I also want
    to maximize pain on A and/or G, and that means we (you, me and John)
    need to figure out the best option.
    
    I hope you forgive me for my one season of independent forays into
    Germany, and I hope you see France's point of view.  I'm more than
    willing to tell him any move that re-maximizes your position.
    
    Does this help at all?

    OK, in the Demo Game I've lied to everyone -- I admit that.  here I
    wouldn't call it "lying" to Cal.  Yes, i didn't go where he thought, but
    that's not really lying.  France should be the 'heavy' here.  I just
    figured Cal could hold off Edi.  Ooops.
    
    Y'know, his letter kind of hurt.  Here I spend all my life in BOH, for

    (on France)
    >Funny, as he's the one who messed me up the biggest...
    
    I didn't realize that. He'd promised to help with his A Tyo, huh? And that
    'miscommunication' over who was going to Ionian Sea....
    
    Well, he decided to go for it, and naturally he wasn't going to tell
    anyone. You know how *that* is.
    
    Here's what I meant. First, in my experience he's been the most trustworthy
    player. Sure, he'll stab if there's a lot in it for him, everyone will. But
    he tends to think friends are worth something. (I am worth something to
    him--witness his Wal-Eng when he could just as well have ordered Wal-Lon --
    and you are too.) Second, it is strongly in his interest to have you
    blocking Turkey, keeping his part of the Med quiet. He's totally committed
    against Germany now, sliding into Rome or the like isn't going to help him.
    (I guess he might see it as a way to 'teleport' that backward fleet, taking
    Rome and building up north, then just disbanding the Med. fleet when he's
    kicked out. But I don't figure he'll think it's worth the aggravation it
    would cause him later.)
    
    >I guess I do have to decide whether to trust someone (ie F or T) or
    >simply suicide.  I'll see who makes me an offer first... :)
    
    I'm surprised you aren't thinking of settling things with Edi. Seems like
    the obvious approach. If you two re-ally, it's your seven plus a little
    French help against TEN Turkish centers. Whereas joining with Turkey leaves
    you the weak partner by a long shot.
    
    Well, I certainly will leave you to figure how best to deal with Edi.
    
    And I can't honestly say I'm too disappointed to see that the rest of the
    woeful RIAE 'alliance' is crashing and burning along with me.

    ** Yes, I know it was.   I think France was concerned you and Turkey

    ** Yeah, at this stage, it looks to be F/T as the main powers.  Pitt can

    BEL this turn, so his power is more of a Kingmaker, than King.  You
    heading west only allows quicker Turkish gains, with perhaps a resurgent
    Austria; hardly what we both want at this stage.  At least keeping true
    to E/F keeps you alive longer.  As for "suiciding out:"  bite your
    tongue!  Poorly-played one-center Russias suicide out.  Well-played
    Italian "swing nations" have much going for them -- to include retaking
    centers from Edi.  And France needs (and wants) your help.

    Hi Guys:
    Whew; Day 1 of the conference is over, with only one last professor (my
    error, unfortunately).  the good news:  he's a department alum with a
    low-key attitude, so life blessed me there.  Today is "tour West Point
    and take a boat ride" day, so I'll be The Love Boat cruise guide, to
    boot.
    
    Yesiree, your military tax dollars at work.  Actually a few heavy
    hitters at this:  Secretary Wm Perry, Ashton Carter, Harlan Ullman,
    fareed Zakaria, and all the other cogniscenti and wannabes.  Yawn.
    
    OK, more important sutff:  the game.
    
    I was thinking about this (hard to believe, I know).  If I were Germany,
    I'd be more than happy -- given the fact that I have never to date done
    _any_ eastward movement anyway -- to once again support MUN and watch
    the hated Faz wither on his vine...his whiny, acerbic mouth forever
    silenced.  As Jamie pointed out, BEL is lost to him anyway, so he'll
    either retreat it to HOL, or hit Bur to ensure no taking of
    MUN...because once MUN/Ruh go, his whole flank is rolled -- everything
    else is poised for the northern breakout.
    
    And, if I were Hohn and/or Edi, I'd want same said Fassio dead, and
    would ensure I cover Vienna, or perhaps hold in place and let Edi live.
    
    Therefore, my 'druthers (if I'm allowed to have any) would be to have
    French A Tyo S Boh-Vie, but *tell* Turkey that France is going into it
    instead, and could he please hit TRI and/or BUD this turn.
    
    If Hohn moves at all, Bud's support is cut.  Italy should be retaking
    TRI this turn(?), which means all of Edi's units have no
    supports....which means I would get VIE (Munich certainly won't hit
    Tyo).
    
    These are a lot of "ifs," I realize.  And if you don;'t want me staying
    in the game, or if you want to try and gut Germany via MUN again, I'm
    game.  Whatever.  I just think the Vienna option is the best potential
    successful option -- and the most satisfying for me, after seeing Edi
    chase me out of my homeland.  To be in HIS center -- with him at the
    same level as me -- well, that would be deliciously good retribution
    before I died.
    
    What say my assembled friends?

    I'll pass up this lovely chance to gloat, but you'll be glad to know that
    this was just a glorious turn as far as I'm concerned. Everyone against
    whom I've ever wanted revenge got stuck with the Big Fork.
    
    I know you are very happy for me, so don't bother saying so.
    
    We won't pretend that there's any chance I'd switch sides now, but if ever

    Actually, there oughta.  Making the GM giggle should not be the sole
    goal of this game.  You have had a lot of "tough breaks".  I still
    honestly think you are just as good a player as any of these people
    and my estimation has not gone down except that I thought you might
    pick up on some subtleties of E-Mail more quickly than you did, though
    my sorry case was no better.  John, in particular, has shown me a lot.
    With E-Mail sometimes it is difficult to resist the "one more E-Mail"
    when silence would serve your position better.  John also is a master
    of the "why make a statement when asking a simple question would do"
    School of Diplomacy, that builds on the theory (most ably implemented
    in sales negotiation) where it is said that the one asking the most
    questions gets the better price.
    
    Don't give up yet, there is at least one more week of great Diplomacy
    left in you!

    I do too, but it's not the lack of coordination of moves that did me
    in.
    It was the fact that you and Russia (and E according to Mark) didn't
    wish to clue me in on what was going on.  That, effectively, left me out
    to dry and cost me Vie & Tri.  If I had known what was going on, I
    could have made my moves accordingly.

    I think it was fortuitous that your message to England accidently arrived
    in my box.  A frank exchange of views will vastly improve our situation.
    
    I don't know what Russia promised you regarding tactics.  I never said I'd
    use Tyrolia to support you.  In fact, for whatever reason, you did not
    mention Tryolia in our earlier communications.  I assumed, then, that you
    had other ideas, so I began to entertain the idea of using the unit against
    Germany.  I'm sorry we communicated so badly.  We were obviously working
    from different playbooks.  England's observation that I want you to remain
    strong is correct.  I certainly did not want you to lose any centers.
    
    Regarding the fleet, with Germany's lateness, we had about a day between my
    message and final orders.  I assumed we had plenty of time, even if orders
    processed without delay, because you have been online regularly throughout
    this game.  Again, I am sorry things did not work out as I expected.
    
    My point is that my commitment to you doing well remains.  I'll continue to
    help you.
    
    Personally, I think you have a great opportunity.  Austria now has his home
    back.  If I were Edi, I'd be thinking in terms of a clean slate.  And I'd
    be observing Hohn's stab.  I'd be looking for new friends and the obvious
    one is Italy.  With Austria's fleet joining ours, Turkey is easily
    outnumbered.  If you and Edi patch it up, Austria can even mount a
    counterattack on Turkey next year.
    
    Austria clearly needs you.  Without Italy's help, he's out.  The rest of us
    will be engaged in the north, so it's just the three of you.  AI has the
    upper hand, I think.  It won't be easy, but Turkey can be beaten.
    
    Regarding suicide, I think that's totally unwarranted.  If nothing else,
    remember that you need only one unit remaining to share in a draw.  I would
    not be at all surprised to see this game end in a five-way, with Italy very
    much alive.  I'm sorry for what happened, but I do remain on your side.

    France has observed with growing concern Germany inching westward for
    several years.  Were Germany a true friend of France, we would not now see
    two fleets threatening the North Sea.  We would have seen German armies
    move, even tentatively, to the eastern front.  None of this has occurred.
    The Foreign Ministry believes that France, in concert with its good friends
    England and Russia, moved just in time to avert a German attack on French
    soil.

    Edi,
    
    As promised, I did nothing hostile to your efforts, and that part worked
    out.  Unfortunately, it seems Turkey stuck a knife in you, probably without
    telling too many outright lies.
    
    Italy is very depressed about how all this turned out.  I have suggested
    that he contact you about working together.  If  I were in your shoes, I'd
    say, okay, I've got my home centers back, let's clear the decks and start
    over.
    
    Any help I can give, let me know.

    Further ruminations.  I am not as averse to moving out of North as GKJ.  I
    think we should force Germany to decide what to keep.  A fleet in Nth would
    bother me if he did not face maybe two disbands.  If he did lose hol, bel,
    and mun (gaining nwy), then I wonder if he'd really hang onto the fleet,
    which would be a major nuisance, but not that useful for defending the
    homeland.  IMO, he's bound to keep the armies.  Perhaps he'd disband stp
    and ska, leaving nth and nwy in play.  Not good, but is that impossible to
    manage?  I'd have f bre and a par to add to our forces.  Even his fleets
    might have to head back to Germany for defense.  At worst, maybe he picks
    up lon or edi, but at what price?
    
    The key is that we could hit Denmark.  That creates real problems for
    Germany, including the unattractiveness of bouncing in Kie.  I hope you
    look this over again, with that problem in mind.  I certainly want to know
    if I'm missing anything.
    
    I say, again, let's hit him with all we can.  As long as neither Italy or
    Austria taps Tyrolia, we're certain to take three centers (losing one).  If
    we hear something to give us reason not to take that gamble, then the Tsar
    can go out in a blaze of glory, but given the tactical situation in the
    east, I think Russia can take Munich.

<p><a name=52></a><b>Private message from <font color=00cccc>France</font> to <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font>:</b><pre>
    Regarding tactics, I wish to note one small point.  Germany might not
    attack North Sea because we could (in fact, were I Germany I would expect)
    order f hel s f nth-den.  Therefore, ska must support Den.  Thus, I could
    defend nth with ech-nth alone.  On first glance, my inclination is to knock
    out both low countries and take a shot at mun.
    
    I say, forget the eastern war.  I'll have a hand with my fleet for a while,
    but for the most part let ATI work it out.  We have a big job to do as it
    is.

    Nappy IV and GKJ
    
    I agree about the DEN threat/option, and I for one am a wholehearted
    supporter of the "turn the center/south German flank, and forget Nth"
    cabal.  I too believe Germany will concern himself most with army
    retention and solidifying his line somewhere (even if it becomes a North
    german/Scandy rump state).  Quite honestly, if there's a way to snag
    both Low Countries and try for others, I say go for it.
    
    As for me going to MUN, I'm not so sanguine.  I think Germany will
    deliberately support MUN again (no other real use for BER, is there?) to
    ensure "minimal" loss and my death.  I'm pessimistic about success, but
    will give it the ol' college try.
    
    Suggest one or both of you perhaps write Italy and mention we'd like to
    see him retake TRI.  Having said that, are we to "ignore" him again in
    the interests of security, or should we warn him not to expect Tyo/Boh
    help, and thus tip our hand?  I leave that to the big boys to decide.
    
    Will order to Munich again; thanks for the help, mon ami.

    Wow, now *this* is a strange combination to be writing to!
    
    Gentlemen:
    I'll do the standard Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF) so well-loved by
    military men everywhere:
    
    I want Vienna. I don't expect to live forever in this game.  Don't even
    know if I want to, being a one-center "life support" piece.  Having said
    that, if Turkey hits Austria (Rum-Bud, Ser S, Gre-Alb) concurrent with
    an Italian hit on TRI and French support of me to Vienna, we could
    reduce Edi to QUITE delicious proportions.  Italy and Turkey stand to
    gain most from this (given that France will gain two from BEL and DEN,
    why have him get any more in the south?), and, fir me, it will be one
    small happy point in an otherwise dismal game.  A Russian unit in the
    enemy's capital -- after seeing (ahem) enemy units in MY cities -- would
    go a great way in providing JUSTICE for we downtrodden types.
    
    Please consider joint ops.  We can take down Vienna, but not if his
    other support pieces are untapped.
    
    I throw myself before the Balkan Powers.

    peoples of the board lie silent and sullen now, realizing how it feels
    to receive a backslip, rather than giving them out.

    Hi guy:
    
    I know this has taken a while to write, but I've obviously had to do a
    LOT of thinking about what course of action is best for me.  I've
    finally decided.  Let me give you some background as to what went into
    my decision.
    
    First off, I had to pick between two "evils".  While you lied to me for
    the second time this game, France and Russia also screwed me pretty good
    last turn when they left me out to dry by withholding support for my
    units in Austria.
    
    The way I figure it, you may have lied to me, but both times it was in
    the context of the game and did benefit you.  The first time, it was
    merely a matter of you having to choose between Edi and I.  I can
    understand and live with that.  The second time (this last turn), you
    DID hit Edi, but you also hurt me by cutting my support of Trieste from
    Adriatic.  Again, I grudgingly admit that this makes sense because it
    took down TWO powers in your neighbourhood.  You took the risk that I
    would continue working with France, but I'm sure that seemed likely to
    you anyway.  Who knows?  You may have been right.
    
    France And Russia really did me wrong last turn and it was for really,
    really, REALLY bad reasons.  I was under the impression that they would
    be helping me retain both Vienna and Trieste by supporting me with their
    units in Boh & Tyo.  Instead, at the last minute, they decide to hit
    Munich.  Okay, that was fine per se - Mark wanted to survive and France
    wanted another means to attack Germany in his stab.  Unfortunately, they
    made the mistake of declaring this Top Secret.  That meant that they
    didn't tell me "in case I inadvertantly tipped someone off".  Not only
    is this insulting, it meant that I couldn't even TRY to defend myself
    and hang onto one of the Austrian centres.  As upset as I am. I've still
    tried to get over this figuring that, if I attack them now, it gives you
    the game.  Unfortunately (for them, not so for you), I can't forgive the
    personal insult part of their actions.  I don't mind living with an ally
    who may perpetrate the "big stab", but I hate working with someone who
    screws me around over the little things (Death of 1000 Cuts?)
    
    My take on the upcoming season is this:  their letters have indicated
    that they are going to try to take Vienna off Edi so Mark can survive.
    I ASSUME that you are going to try and take Budapest for yourself.  This
    means that if Edi uses his fleet in Albania to support Trieste, I cannot
    retake that centre and will lose one of my units.  (I consider this a
    bad thing - at four centres, I will have little effect on the game).
    
    Here's the deal: if you will use your fleet in Greece to hit Albania and
    cut support, I should retake Trieste and not have to remove any units.
    Once this happens, I will turn west and go against France.  Since I
    cannot in all conscience continue to work with him after last turn, this
    course of action appeals to me most.  It should appeal to you as well as
    it will almost certainly guarantee your growth up to at least 13 or 14
    centres (um, hopefully none of them Italian centres...).  This will
    certainly guarantee that you are in at the finish of the game.  With any
    luck, this will mean some sort of survival for me as well.  I doubt I
    have much chance otherwise.
    
    To convince you of my seriousness, I'll pass along a tidbit that may be
    of use to you:  France, Russia AND England have all been urging me to
    patch things up with Edi and have the two of us try to blockade you
    until they can finish with Germany and step in to help.  Methinx this
    would simply give the game to France so I have no intention of doing so
    (regardless of your answer).  I definitely do NOT think France has
    played well enough to win this game and will do pretty much anything to
    stop this from happening.
    
    Please consider this offer.
    
    I think the Judge is down so I am CC'ing a copy to your home (work?)
    address.  You might want to respond the same way.

    Jim: I'm sure you'll be wondering (from my recent press to Hohn) if I'm
    seriously considering throwing him the game simply because I'm pissed
    off at France.
    
    The truth is no, I'm not THAT pissed off.  While I am annoyed at what
    happened, I think that France currently has the upper hand in this game.
    Even if Hohn is allowed to expand unchecked for the next few turns, he
    will be stopped at the stalemate line.  France, on the other hand, has
    the edge in that he can cross the Med stalemate line and take his time
    mopping up English, German and Scandinavian centres.
    
    I figure my best chance at this point is to let Hohn grow til John has
    to turn to face him (earlier than he wants I hope).  With any luck, I
    can be stuck in the middle and invaluable to both sides.  If I attack
    Hohn now, it helps France and at best puts me into a large (5-way?)
    draw.

    Here's another thing to keep in mind.  If Germany disbands  stp and ska,
    he's opening the door to Turkey.  Turkey has to sit in warsaw for one turn,
    then he can move north, backed by his new units.  Germany can't think about
    only causing us trouble, because his other flank would be vulnerable.

    Sultan,
    As you see, I am fully engaged with Germany.  I expect that, with the help
    of the small powers, I can have Germany on the defensive.  I was wondering
    if you were interested in playing a part in this battle.  If we force
    Germany to disband one, it's likely to be f stp, leaving the north open for
    a Turkish army.  This depends, of course, on your attitude toward Germany.
    If I may say, his gradual shift my direction, coupled with talk of FTG
    3-way, indicate that you and he were on friendly terms.  I wonder if that
    has changed, in light of recent events.

    I am assuming we take Munich also.  Thus, G loses Holland, Belgium, and
    Munich, he gains Norway.  net loss two.
    
    If he did try nwy-nth, then he'd lose three, because I'd vacate the north.
    
    I think he has to keep armies over fleets.  We'll be all over his homeland.
     I can't see a convoy to England under such circumstances.

    I'll play it however you want. I won't really look carefully at your plan
    until Monday, but I will say that Germany in Nth still looks bad to me.
    Germany could keep the F Nth and convoy into Edi in S07. He would then get
    Lvp and Edi. Could you take two of his centers to compensate?
    
    With Germany in Nth, I would also be quite worried about my survival, but
    that's obviously my special concern.
    
    Let me also note that you have miscalculated if you think Germany would have
    to take *two* disbands--he's got Norway, after all.
    
    Let me look it over on Monday, and if I really hate the idea I'll try to
    talk you out of it.
    
    Hm. You know, if he really does support Den with Ska, he won't order Nwy-Nth
    (he *really* couldn't afford to lose both lowlands and fail to get Norway).
    That means the F Nth could do *support* duty, which makes me a little more
    comfortable (since if dislodged it could retreat to Edi, or Yor). Think
    about that option.

    If we do give up on taking Munich in favor of boh-vie, then I would suggest
    the following:
    
    a bur s a pic-bel
    f hel s f nth - hol
    f ech - nth
    
    Ths should net us both low countries and perhaps block G out of nth, if he
    does defend den.  Of course, G might also be averse to moving nwy, which
    would be all the better - we'd have a fleet in nth, and the two centers.

<p><a name=66></a><b>Private message from <font color=00cccc>France</font> to <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font>:</b><pre>
    Further thoughts.  I see that the surest way to take Munich is bur-mun with
    support from tyrolia and bohemia.  This, of course, means Russia's demise.
    But, the longer I look at the map, the more permutations I see.  For
    instance, Germany has a real problem figuring out how to defend Kiel.  As I
    said, bouncing Hol and Den won't do if we attack Den.  And, if Germany
    defends Denmark, he won't move Nwy, so we need not worry about a German
    fleet in the North Sea.  In addition, Germany should want to block Bur-Ruh.
    Perhaps he will order Bel-Bur (cutting support for the attack on Munich)
    and Hol-Ruh.  Then how does he defend Kiel?  Den-Kie?  Or perhaps he
    doesn't block Bur-Ruh, ordering Hol-Kie instead.  Then Hel (or Nth) could
    take Hol unopposed.  He'd be in a guessing game with England on whether to
    cover Kie or Hol.  Maybe, then, the solution is to bounce Mun and Ber.  If
    so, then a two-unit attack on Munich works.
    
    Let's start with what I think is a fairly obvious German play:
    
    F Nwy S F Ska-Nth
    F Ska - Nth
    A Den - Kie
    A Hol - Kie
    A Bel - Bur
    F Stp - GOB
    A Ber S A Mun
    
    How can we unhinge this?  And, if Germany assumes we respond to this play,
    what will he do?
    
    This seems to call for bur-mun, mar-bur, pic-bel, ech s pic-bel.  The fun
    begins with deciding whether to hit den, or hol, or to order hel s nth.  In
    any case, the result is Russia's gone, but Germany is in trouble.
    
    An alternative is to respond to Italy's situation with an attack on
    Austria.  If, as GKJ has suggested, we gang up, Austria's out next turn.
    France might do better with a live but crippled Austria in the game, but
    it's not absolutely necessary to me. ( I tried to get A and I talking, but
    Italy has told me he wants his centers back, so it might be best to help
    Italy now, before he switches sides.)
    
    Actually, a bigger question might be whether Turkey wants to take Austria
    out.  Without his help (cutting alb and bud), no one gains - except him.
    He might not order the cuts.
    
    This plan keeps Russia alive, but it also leaves Germany in better shape.
    He'll take only one disband - none if we hold in nth, and if he guesses
    right he might even gain.  In addition, his defensive position will
    improve.  Russia won't be in boh any more, and at earliest in Fall of the
    following year.
    
    That's as far as I've thought it through.
    
    What do you think?

    Gents,
    
    I do see that there are many permutations.
    
    Upon further consideration, I still believe that it is not wise to allow
    Germany to capture the North Sea. However, I can see that from the French
    perspective it might be ok, especially if France could capture three German
    centers.
    
    My last reservation is this. If Germany enters Nth, he will threaten
    London. If France protects London by Eng-Lon in S1907, (a) the German fleet
    could sneak into Eng, and (b) it might be very difficult for France to
    leave London in the Fall safely (or, the move might just bounce, in which
    case there would be another similar situation in the Fall). What this adds
    up to is a significant danger of my elimination.
    
    There is some chance that France could get me into Kiel in '07. And, if
    that's the way you want to play it, giving up Nth for the centers, I'll go
    along. I've committed my last forces to the Cause, and I'll follow through
    with that commitment.
    
    I guess if it were up to me, I'd choose Bur-Ruh, Eng S Pic-Bel, Hel S Nth.
    I think the chance of taking Bel that way is very high, and the chance of
    getting the army into Ruh is also high. This would leave a strong and tight
    position for next year, strong enough to ensure the upper hand against
    Germany in years to come, without ceding control of Nth. I generally prefer
    the slow but sure crushing of an enemy. But again, it's Napoleon's call,
    I'll go along.
    
    
    For me, extinguishing Austria is no great benefit, so I leave that up to
    you two. It would be a kindness for France to escort the Russian unit into
    Vienna (assuming always that Turkey will play along by cutting Austrian
    support), but Napoleon must do what is best for the French people.

    While I see your point, allying with Edi will just reduce me to a role
    player.  I would have NO avenues of expansion and would simply have to
    be content as a buffer between France and you until you finish with
    Germany.  I think I'd prefer to have a few more units to mess around

    Let me know how you feel about helping me get (at least) Trieste back.
    Certainly we can still work together as I don't want to see Turkey waltz
    to an easy and (as yet) undeserved win.

    Thanks you for your help.  If it still comes out that you don't trust
    Turkey, or that you want Germany further reduced, then I will go gently
    into that good night and help you get MUN. It's just that I would like
    one good smack across Edi's chops this game, if possible.  But if that

    Guys:
    
    First off, thanks for your replies.
    
    Next, I agree with Cal.  Killing Edi does three things, in my mind:
    
    1) It "tidies up the board" by eliminating a variable.  (My turn will
    come soon enough, I'm certain.)
    2) It benefits Hohn the most, as it gives him the lion's share of the
    region, and geographic position to boot. Turkey can then play on
    alliance talks with Germany (common French enemy, for example), can work
    with Italy to crunch France if that's the way it works), or work with
    France to turn Germany into "the next Edi."  From a gains perspective,
    Turkey would get the most long-term benefit from snuffing the Archduke.
    3) The last intangible is the most petty, but it involves Russian
    feelings of _amoure proper_, and merely gives me one happy time this
    game before I, too, become T/I/G fodder in 1907.  And that is seeing
    Edi, the Critiquer, die before me.  It is the least point to consider,
    but certainly an incentive for me.
    
    I've asked France to contact Turkey with his thoughts and intentions.
    Hopefully he will, and the results will be favorable.  If France says
    no, then I'll say my goodbyes now.

    Guys:
    
    Stop the presses.  Note the comms between I, T and myself.  You recall I
    sent a note to i/t about their help in killing Edi.  Hohn gives a
    "tentatively favorable" reply, although who can say if he's being
    up-front?
    
    Having been screwed by him all game, I suppose I should be the most
    wary, but hey -- I'm going to die anyway, and if he's willing to snuff
    out Edi and I'm able to help the cause one more turn, why not do so?
    
    John:  please note -- whatever your decision, a timely reply to Hoh
    would be really appreciated.
    
    Here's my review of the West:
    1) We can defend Nth and go after Hol and Bel, possibly risking Nth
    (i.e., if he uses two fleets on it, he's got it):
    Nth-Hol, Hel S
    Pic-Bel (Bur S)
    Mar S Bur
     Ech-Nth
    
    Result:  Germany goes -1 (+ nwy, -bel & Hol)
    
    2) We can hit the Low Countries and risk Nth Sea for sure:
    Pic-Bel (Ech  and Bur S),   Mar S Bur, and Nth-Hol (hel S)
    Result is the same:  -1 for Germany
    
    3) John can try for Mun:
    Bur-Mun (Tyo and Boh S), Mar-Bur, Pic-Bel (Ech S) and Nth-Hol (Hel S)
    This causes germany to go  -2...again, assuming no A/G collusion
    (extremely doubtful)
    
    Or, we can believe Hohn and try for Vienna.  IF he's telling the truth,
    it means the death of Edi, a semi-happy Cal
    (only goes -1, and I can offer him Vie later), and a rapidly-growing
    Hohn.  Could be an extra ally vs Germany (because he's the only one who
    can be hurt geographically as long as F/I stay together).
    
    John, here's the bottom line.  I believe Hohn and wouldn't mind trying
    for Vie.  Having said that, though, you must do as Jamie mentioned in
    one note:  decide what's best for France.  if a rapidly-growing Hohn and
    a semi-satisfied (i.e., potentially-turncoat) Italy isn't up your ally
    and you'd prefer to keep Edi around as a cats-paw, then consider
    crushing Germany first, and I'll give up my last unit to help yopu take
    him down.    My only concern is if A/T are fibbing...Edi will then live,
    I'll be dead, Boh is open, and Germany will be after you regardless.
    I'd rather take the left arm off of the A/T colossus if possible,
    knowing Germany is an eenmy whether at -1 or -2.  We can reduce him even
    further next year.
    
    The other concern I have is with England's lifespan.  I wouldn't want
    Germany to threaten LON (Or force France to cover it and then have GKJ
    taken out "by friendly fire").   That's why I roll over on final moves.
    **Tell me what you want me to do, and I'll do it.**
    
    ** but please respond to Turkey, regardless, even with a negative
    reply.**  We owe him that much, methinks.

    Sultan,
    Your proposal is most intriguing.  Needless to say, I like it a lot.  In
    the short term, this seems to imply next turn will be anti-Austria.  Is
    that so?  I could play a part in that.  Or any other plan, for that matter.

    I see about 6 other Dip messages in the queue, so this one will be short
    (to avoid repetition that I'm sure will come as I read sequentially).
    
    The plan seems ok, and if it means Russia's demise, then I grudgingly
    accept my fate.  John didn't list A Mun's actions, but I imagine it's
    moot:  I mean, unless Edi takes the unheard-of step of hitting Tyo (with
    german support), then (a) the south is secure, and (b) France's
    essentially support piece for guaranteeing Mun's fall is still there
    (doubtful anyone will hit Boh, ha ha).
    
    Let me read the rest of my mail and see if I have anything further to
    add.

    Well, not that I have much say in it (as I noted earlier), I am in
    favour of eliminating Edi simply for that favourable effect of
    eliminating a variable.

    I have no problems with Pitt, but neither do I have problems with you.
    I am content with a three-way.  But to be honest, I see the potential
    for better.
    
    If we work together closely, and monitor each other closely, we can
    whittle the field down to me, you, and small Germany and small Italy.
    Then, if we are meticulous, we can move simultaneously toward the
    stalemate line and obtain a two-way draw result.
    
    This is not some lame BS designed to snooker you into letting me grab
    a solo while you're not looking, btw.  It's a real and realistic
    proposal.  We're both good enough players where we can plan ahead,
    examine the tactical realities, and call it off if it looks like it
    won't work, and we can then just take a three-way.  But we sit astride
    some of the most natural stalemate lines there are, and I think we can
    do it.
    
    And let's assume worst case scenario, and one of us miscalculates and
    the other solos.  In such a case, I'd have only myself to blame if I
    miscalculated, and I'd begrudge your solo not at all.  Moreover, I
    don't mind risking letting another person solo if I have a similar
    shot at soloing.
    
    But again, I think a two-way would be elegant and very workable.  We
    just have to be careful.  And I think it would impress people, that we
    pulled off the extremely difficult.
    
    Alternatively, I'm open to the idea of three-way with either Italy or
    Germany as the third power.  Please let me know your thoughts on the
    matter.
    
    Thanks,
    Hohn

    I've thought about it, and although I was initially considering just
    having BUD support SER, I'm more and more leaning towards the idea of
    eliminating Edi outright this turn, if we can manage it.  I wasn't
    very impressed with certain press he sent me this past turn, and I
    would like to make my displeasure known in some fashion.

    a Russian move on VIE, then I will probably hit RUM-BUD, SER S
    RUM-BUD.  If I can't receive or am not convinced by mutual commitment
    to the plan, then I will stick with the safe route.

    It's okay; this damned game will do that to you...  I think I'll allow
    myself the luxury of a small chuckle here.  I know exactly what you
    mean - what do you think I'VE been hearing from him for the past two
    years?  <chuckle>

    If I hit Trieste and Rum hits Bud, Serbia is in no danger.  If you
    support me from Serbia, I probably wouldn't need the hit on Alb
    (assuming Rum can tap Budapest...).
    
    What do you think of Mark's plan?  I have no objection to seeing him
    around for one more turn although, after last turn, I won't shed a tear
    if he isn't.  I certainly wouldn't mind seeing Edi go out completely if
    for no other reason than to reduce one variable.  Course that applies
    to Mark as well... :)

    Given the calibre of play in this game, I think the only power with
    ANY chance of an 18 centre win is France and only because he has the
    best chance of crossing the stalemate line.  That said, I don't
    think he can do it without my cooperation which, to say the least,
    ain't gonna happen.

    If I can be part of a 3-way, I'm not concerned if France is part of it.
    All in all, he's probably played a better game than Pitt if only because
    I don't think Pitt has made as much happen (okay, it's close).  If you
    see me as the Kingmaker between you and France, fine, because I see it
    that way too.  If I get taken out, YOU risk a French win and lose a
    faithful ally so I figure it's in your best interest to keep me in.
    I mean, after all, I intend to work against France even if you attack
    me again, so what would be the point on your part?
    
    All I ask is that you let me have a fair share of the Balkans (your
    choice on the division - just keep me viable; 6 or 7 centres is my
    estimation of what I need to be effective).  Given that, I'll do my
    best to see that I/T is in on the draw.
    
    Deal?

    Cal,
    
    My condolences over your frustration with John and Mark.  As for me, I
    apologize for screwing you over.  I'd toyed with the idea of claiming,
    "Sorry, it was a miswritten order!" but I quickly dismissed the idea
    because I didn't want to insult your intelligence.
    
    I must admit I'm a bit annoyed with Edi right now as well.  Well, not
    annoyed, but a bit disappointed.  After my stab, he sent me some press
    indicating how letting him live and me retreating from the centers I
    took from him would unquestionably be "the best strategic decision,"
    or some such similar nonsense.
    
    I mean, please.  Don't insult my intelligence, Edi!  Anyway, if he's
    going to do that, I suppose I could do the same, and play along, and
    promise to retreat, etc. etc.  I suppose I'm rambling a bit, and for
    that I apologize, but I'm in a bit of a strange mood right now.
    
    As for your substantive offer, I plan on having RUM support SER, and
    SER is available to support you into TRI.  I haven't yet determined
    whether GRE is free to tap ALB yet, but it is probable that I can do
    so.  I'll confirm for sure later, after I've examined my tactical
    situation.
    
    I will also promise you this.  I still don't think there's a chance in
    hell that I can solo.  I do want to be the largest power in a
    three-way draw, though.  That's just a pride thing.  If you do work
    with me, and one power emerges victorious between Pitt and John (and
    to be honest, I don't particularly care much which one it is; as long
    as I'm part of the three-way, I'm happy), then there is still a decent
    chance that you will be able to be a part of the three-way as well,
    albeit as a small power.  But a draw is a draw is a draw, in many
    ways, and I think being the precarious (but necessary) balance between
    two larger powers is eminently feasible for you.  After all, we both
    know the chances of a two-way of any kind working is extremely remote.
    We'll need a buffer power, and that can be you, I think.
    
    I take it from your press that you would prefer a GIT three-way over
    an FIT three-way.  That's fine with me.  Both F and G had been talking
    individually about an FGT three-way last turn, but that prospect seems
    rather unlikely in light of the French stab.  What do you think?
    
    Let me know.
    
    Thanks,
    Hohn

    Well my friend, I'm in it with you whole hog.  I'm not sure what's up
    with John, his stab seems a bit odd to me, but in any case, you have
    my complete friendship and support.  Just let me know what you want me

    Orders are as I said.  My last decision is regarding RUM/SER, and as I

    Yes, I am all for taking Edi out immediately.  Let's eliminate the

    While I would certainly be hesitant to trust Turkey yet again, he has
    mentioned being angry at something Edi wrote to him after this last
    turn.
    I take this to mean he'd be up for it.  I don't think it matters to me
    at least insofar as it isn't going to change MY orders.  It COULD matter
    to me if Russia hits Vienna and helps me get Trieste, so I guess if
    you're willing and Mark will order Boh-Vie, I'd certainly appreciate it.

    I did lose some mail due to computer upgrade here.  I know this because
    another player resent a lost message.  Perhaps yours also were lost in the

    I asked you in a previous message if your actions this year are to be

    eliminate Bir-Sauron.  If you don't participate, it's a waste of my time

    Cal,
    
    Just had an interesting phone conversation with Edi.
    
    Man, he sure is a smooth talker.
    
    In any case, I want to assure you, I have nothing better to do with my
    units than to do as I've told you.  ION can get kicked out by you and
    France (and even Austria, if that's what you want) easily, so I'm not
    going to bother moving somewhere that will be blocked, or supporting
    it to hold when I know it can be dislodged.  Thus, I am free to hit
    GRE with my backup units.  ION is free to convoy.
    
    Meanwhile, RUM and SER have nothing better to do than to either attack
    BUD or have RUM support SER while SER supports your ADR-TRI.  I ain't
    goin' anywhere (except maybe BUD), and that means I've got support
    orders to write.  I'd much rather see you work with me and play buffer
    and third-party between France and me than to see an angry and now
    distrustful Edi survive any longer than necessary.
    
    Edi and Jamie and Mark are on the way out.  There's no reason to keep
    them in.  That leaves the four of us.  Pitt has been nonresponsive,
    and he's also not as necessary to the stalemate line as you are (I can
    scoot armies into a Russian stalemate position pretty easily, while
    you and I can defend the center, and you can stop the French at the
    ION/TUN/TYS/TUS/GOL/PIE (or some other variant) line).  I can hang
    back with my fleets (which will constitute an impenetrable defense if
    you choose to go against me, incidentally; meanwhile, France will
    continue infiltrating your country until he stabs for the solo) if
    that will make you feel better and safer.
    
    I want to work with you, Cal.  It's in both of our self-interests, I
    sincerely believe.
    
    So please, let's do it.  I apologize if all of this is already what
    you believe, or obvious and self-evident, or otherwise displaying some
    lack of faith on my part.  It's just that Edi is very convincing when
    he wants to be (although in this case, I don't think his diplomacy had
    quite the effect he desired). ;)
    
    Let me know.

    1) Seems to me that the last time I trusted you in a long term alliance,
    it
       involved Russia and England.  Remember the Q Continuum?  Funny how
    we're
       all in the tank now, eh?
    
    2) Regardless of how it affects you or I in the long run, I'd say Hohn's
    move
       made a lot of sense from HIS point of view.  Even game-wise, it
    pretty much
       assures him of a place in the final result, wouldn't you say?

    I'm quite aware of my position strategically.  As things stand now, I
    can
    probably lay claim to being this game's "Kingmaker".

    We'll see.  At the moment, it doesn't look as if you'll be around long
    enough
    to have any meaningful effect on the final result.

    Boy, I'm the wrong guy to ask. :)   He's lied to me twice and I fell

    enough at Edi to do it.  I guess we'll see.

    I thank you both for your review of my options, and for the latest
    French missive, offering Vienna support (again, assuming Turkey makes it
    a "go").   _That_ decision, unfortunately, is far from my hands, and

    Tactically, I would much prefer to hit Germany for three, which would take
    the Tsar of All the Russias out of the game.  But I do want Italy's good
    will, which will probably require giving him help regaining Trieste.  I
    think, right now, that might be more important than knocking Germany down.
    Thus, if the Sultan gives the go sign, we'll probably put Austria out of
    his misery.
    
    In other words, I have good reasons of my own for hitting Vienna, in
    addition to my fervent desire to see my inestimable Russian friend wreak
    his much-deserved revenge.

    Napoleon,
    
    I think you might have to be a *little* careful about letting Turkey
    present himself as Italy's only friend. Probably Italy can't trust Turkey
    enough to sail west with so few units, but you never know.

    >1) We can defend Nth and go after Hol and Bel, possibly risking Nth

    >Mar S Bur
    > Ech-Nth

    >Result:  Germany goes -1 (+ nwy, -bel & Hol)
    
    Surely Bel should be taken from Burgundy, not from Picardy. France doesn't
    want to leave an army in Mar when he could have one in Pic instead. And
    Burgundy is perfectly safe. Attacking from Bur is better -- unless for some
    reason you think Germany will order Mun S Bel-Bur?

    >Pic-Bel (Ech  and Bur S),   Mar S Bur, and Nth-Hol (hel S)
    >Result is the same:  -1 for Germany
    
    Hm. I guess I think this is better. If Germany goes for Nth with just one
    unit, it will be Nwy -- better to let him in (so he doesn't get Nwy!) than
    to bounce him, much as I hate to see France lose control of Nth.
    
    >3) John can try for Mun:

    I like this, but it means Russia is out of the game, almost certainly.

    It becomes a judgment call, really.  Do we strke my second Germanic
    tormentor, and reduce Pitt by two big ones?  Or do we go for a sure -1
    on Pitt, a 75% chance of helping Cal get TRI back (thus helping you in
    the long run), and a chance to eradicate Edi?
    
    My heart is with the Vienna attack, but my brain says you'd be better
    off -- even 1% better --  in reducing Pitt.
    
    Unless you tell me to go for Vienna, and that you _honestly_ 'feel good"

    I told him -- in a very long-winded way -- that if that's what it took
    to optimize the positions and to hurt the most enemy formations, then so
    be it.
    
    I've already reordered Boh to support him to Munich.
    
    He must have some advance poop from either T or G that's causing this
    reassessment.  Oh well, I did offer to die if it helped the cause, and
    after helping Italy ad nauseam for his gains, it'll be nice to hurt my
    other germanic tormentor for a change.

    Well, you need an asap reply, so here we go:
    
    1) I'd be curious to know what's surfaced that might cause you to go for
    MUN instead of the Vie support thing.
    This isn't the "Italy stabbing westward" thing again, I imagine, so you
    must be hearing new rumors.
    
    2) IF you really feel Hohn won't support us, and thus Edi will cut your
    support/be able to defend VIE, then *yes,* I'll accept death to help you
    gain your third German center this turn.   Especially if you feel he's
    doing Bel-Bur to ensure I don't get a center.
    
    This game evolves now into some personality-driven constraints.  if I
    were Edi and Pitt and knew Faz could still hurt them, I'd want me dead
    ASAP, even if they lost something in the process.  And that implies
    Bel-Bur, Vie-Tyo, to ensure I get zippo.  If *that* is what you're
    hearing, and thus any French support for me would be unproductive, then
    I'll help you into MUN and accept death.  In a bummed out way, of course
    (because I want Vie), but I said it in all previous letters, and I mean
    it.  if my death must occur to maximize the positions, then so be it.
    I only wish to survive if it benefits us all and there's a viable choice
    to have it be so.

    I did mean to add something else.  If Germany were to think that no attack
    on Munich is coming, he might play things a little loose there, to solve
    some other problems he has, such as defending Kiel.  Maybe you could use
    Turkey as a channel to feel this out.  Turkey should believe that we are
    hitting Vienna.  He might pass this info along to Germany.  If we had a
    pretty good idea Germany believed this, it would open up some opportunities
    worth exploring.

    Edi, Italy will probably attack Trieste from Adriatic or Apulia.  That
    means that an attack on Venice would stand off.  I can't say I'm that
    interested in making Italy an enemy right now unless Venice falls.  It
    won't, so I think I have other uses for Tyrolia.

    Hi Jim
    
    Thanks--as always!--for the note.
    
    I appreciate your compliment.  I always play a game to its conclusion,
    be it bitter defeat, draw, or solo.  This game, given the high-viz with
    the "ghods" involved, commands even more attention.  I only hope that
    the readership finds this interesting, and has made commentary in your
    'zine??
    
    I'm sanguine about my chances for survival.  if I were Edi or Pitt
    (neither of whom have written, as usual) and I was bombarded all game
    with moronic press, acerbic letter-writing (albeit truthful) and other
    such 'indignities' from the Russian, I'd make it my effort to kill the
    Tsar.  After all, if Edi realistically sees himself going down the
    tubes, what better spite than to work with Pitt (and maybe Hohn!!) and
    hit Tyo and Boh, to ensure I get nothing, anywhere?  This way they "wipe
    the slate" of E/R pieces, and let just the big boys decide the future of
    Europe.
    
    The key is "what do they see as the threat?"  Does Edi see a three-way
    hitting him (assuming Hohn's being truthful)?  or is he fixated on I/T?
    Is Germany expecting a repeat, thus concentrating on his own nest, or is
    there cross-country collusion?   I guess we'll see tomorrow.
    
    It's been fun, in a (very) brutal way, and I'll be curious to see if I
    live or die this turn.  Would be nice to be in Vienna this turn, but
    again, I'm not holding my breath.

    I'm looking forward to hearing Pitt's end-of-game speech. His career has
    been very bizarre. First he makes the perfect moves, establishing himself
    as the frontrunner, then he utterly squanders the position, making
    amateurish moves and failing to talk to anyone. Well, the whole game has
    been inscrutable, as far as I'm concerned!

    Guys,
    A post-script:
    
    Please, someone notify Italy about the change of plans.  I can't in good
    conscience be silent and have Cal feel like he's been 'screwed" a second
    time.  Not only is this just "not cricket," but it bodes ill for future
    F/I relations from his perspective, as well as possibly weakens him
    further by preventing the recapture of TRI -- all of which are
    sub-optimal for France in the long-term.  So please, treat our "other"
    ally nicely.
    
    I have, for your info, sent a note to Edi, telling him that I'll save
    him a seat on the bench of the afterlife.  I said that I'm supporting
    France to Vienna, in conjunction with T/I attacks on him.  This may or
    may not work, but I wanted to mess with his mind one last time.  We'll

    France graciously accepts Russia's support into Munich.
    
    I don't have reason to believe Italy will attack me now.  I do worry about

    Actually, it'll be me, for I'm ordering BOH S Tyo-Vie.  This move,
    coupled with Turkish and Italian attacks all along your borders, will

    Guys:
    Am resetting my address to my home system, as I'll be out of the office
    for the next 3 days, and then off on vacation shortly thereafter.  Those
    of you who have sent voluminous correspondence to date (that would be
    Edi, Pitt and Hohn, HA hahahahahahahahaha), you can also send it
    "off-line" to fazfam@juno.com.
    
    I'll be home tomorrow, although with one car getting inspected and the
    other getting its rock-smashed windshield fixed, I'm not sure how
    "timely" I'll respond.
    
    Still, you'll hear from me in one way or another.   For there are still
    surprises in the Tsar's bag of tricks; woe to those who write me off.

    I've fielded some press with him this turn, but he seems a bit set on
    going after you, at least for the time being.

    I'm going to sit tight and stay away from you, unless you request
    specific aid.  You can feel free to disband F STP without fear of me,
    as I will not move a unit adjacent.  Other than that, I'm going to try
    to wrangle something in the center to make sure John doesn't bust past
    the important lines.
    
    Thoughts?

    I can just about ensure that Austria puts Vienna in motion, I think.  I
    could send him a message saying Russia insists on hitting Vienna, even
    though I tried to call him off.  Let me know if that would help.

    Yeah, that's why I REALLY wanted Vienna to get hit too so as to
    eradicate ANY of his units as possible supporting pieces.

    I was pretty ticked when I wrote the above and have decided to just
    bide my time for a turn.  I've tried to patch things up with Turkey
    cuz I figure France is the bigger threat.  I want to see how this turn
    goes to make any firm decisions.  I think we'll have LOTS more to talk
    about by tomorrow.
    
    > Let me know what you hear and what you'd like to do.
    
    I can offer you this tip: despite my requests for them to attack Vienna
    this turn, F/R are determined to attack Munich. You might want to act
    accordingly.

    Hmm, I definitely agree.  He still has the potential to do some real
    damage if he tries to puppet in France's direction.  I'm pretty sure
    France is really trying to make it up to me for last turn, so we have
    a season's grace.  Let's do take Edi out quick, ca va?

    Well, I've asked Turkey for the appropriate help and he's agreed, but I
    don't give 2 cents for that agreement... grin.  All I can do is send in
    my orders and see.

    Passing this on as it interests both of us tactically.  I've just
    finished TWO softball games in a row, so I have no energy to set
    the board up.  Hopefully, we can still make moves to get me Trieste.
    
    I'll look at it tomorrow.  Hopefully, I can get back to you before
    the moves tomorrow night.  If no, well, you know what I'm doing and
    can act accordingly.

    Yo.
    
    I'm back.
    
    Sorry for the sudden and unexplained silence but I have been incommunicado
    for a few days.  It's a long story but you may get a kick out of it.
    
    I had to complete that investigation I spoke about last week.  For obvious
    reasons, I can't be too specific, but the reason we were watching the perp
    is that he was suspected of stealing cars from my client (hell, they *knew*
    he was lifting the cars, they just didn't have any proof).  The Boston P.D.
    (a good department as a whole) apparently only likes to investigate open
    and shut cases unless they're drug cases, so they were lukewarm about my
    client's losses.  That's good for us, I suppose, since we get paid to
    provide them with all the proof.
    
    Well, as it turns out, the perp not only likes to work nights, he likes to
    travel.  He lives in East Boston but he gets around, including NH and ME.
    I spent the weekend following him, looking for him to snatch a vehicle, my
    trusty camcorder and 35mm camera ready to record his actions for posterity.
    
    Saturday night, he went to a small town in central NH.  Small enough that a
    truck with MA plates has a hard time trying to hang around without looking
    suspicious.  Somebody (not the perp or his buddies) called the local deputy
    dawg at about 5:00 a.m. Sunday morning and he cruised by to check me out
    (professional hazard).
    
    As a rule, we try not to divulge our activities to local authorities unless
    we know they're cool (on one investigation I did, the local chief was
    hooked up with the perp in a scam to sell seized firearms...).  So, I tried
    to slough the deputy off with an off-the-cuff cover story about how I was
    supposed to meet my buddy, John Kurtz (whose name I had snagged off the
    mailbox next door and whose house had no lights on and no vehicle in the
    driveway) to go fishing.  The deputy bought it (or seemed to anyway) and
    left.  However, he'd taken down the info off my license plate and driver's
    license before he left and he was back in about 5 minutes, weapon drawn,
    and ordering me to get out of the vehicle.
    
    I, of course, did as instructed.  He looked *very* twitchy and I wasn't
    about to make him any more nervous.  I was Mr. Compliance.
    
    After he cuffed me and frisked me (thank ghod I wasn't carrying!), he
    escorted me to his cruiser and allowed me to ask him a few questions like,
    "What the hell is going on?!".  Well, it turns out that, when I was in
    college about 17 years ago, I got a traffic citation for speeding that I
    never paid (hey, I had so many it was easy to miss one...).  This citation
    was still outstanding, my right to drive in NH had been suspended, and a
    bench warrant had been issued for my arrest.
    
    Now, it's important to rememeber, this was a *traffic* citation, not a
    warrant for murder...  Barney Fife apparently had a problem with that
    distinction, however.  He seemed to think that I was staking out mon ami
    Kurtz's house in order to rape his wife, bugger his kids, and marry the
    family dog or something.  At this point, I decided that discretion was the
    better part of valor and explained what I was really doing, including
    showing him my PI ID.
    
    Big problem.
    
    In MA, the state doesn't actually issue PI ID's.  The company gets a PI
    license suitable for framing and then issues its own ID's to its
    investigators.  In NH, they apparently issue ID's, badges, bullet-proof
    jock straps, etc.  The Commish didn't think that my ID was real and was
    even more convinced that I was, at best, a con man, and at worst, the
    trigger man on the grassy knoll in Dallas.
    
    So, I got a nice ride down to the local police station (which apparently
    also doubled as the jail, city hall, barber shop, and town garage...)  In I
    go for mug shots, fingerprints, et al.  (He was a little squeamish, so I
    was spared the indignities of a strip search.)  Once we're done, he puts me
    in the lock-up and proceeds to go for breakfast.
    
    Now, of course, you're probably wondering - what about your phone call?
    Well, me too.  Barney tells me, however, that, as long as they don't
    question me, they can hold me for 24 hours without letting me make any
    calls and, since he hasn't Mirandized me and isn't going to question me
    until he hears from his boss (who'll be in later), I'll just have to sit
    tight.  (I checked later and, believe it or not, he's right.)
    
    So, I camp out for the morning (I actually got some sleep since I was
    beat).  The Chief shows up about 2:00 p.m. and comes in to talk to me.  I
    waive my rights (figuring if I request a lawyer, I'll be waiting here for a
    week) and try to explain the situation to him.  He listens, cogitates for a
    moment, and says he's going to check out my story.  Great, thinks I, and I
    start to give him the phone number.  He says he already knows it and off he
    goes.
    
    Bigger problem.
    
    There is a little, mom-and-pop security guard operation in NH that operates
    under the name of Northeast Security.  In NH, we DBA as Northeast
    Intelligence Group but my ID says Northeast Security.  Chiefie calls the NH
    Northeast Security, who tell him that they never heard of me.  He comes
    back with the deputy and they proceed to try "good cop, bad cop" on me.
    Right.  I've been doing investigations, interrogations, and interviews for
    15 years and these bozos think I'm going to be impressed by their
    Mutt-and-Jeff routine.  I tell them that I've got nothing to say and ask to
    make a call, which, finally, they allow me to do.
    
    I call my boss (who owns the company) and explain the situation to him.  At
    first, he thinks I'm kidding but, when he's done laughing, he gets on the
    ball to square things away.  Between him, me, and our Director of
    Investigations, we probably know and have personal, as well as professional
    relationships, with most of the law enforcement organizations in MA, both
    local, state, and federal, as well as a few in NH.
    
    A few phone calls and about 30 minutes later, Chief Littlebrain gets a call
    from the Asst. Commissioner of the NH Dept. of Public Safety, basically
    asking him what the hell he's doing and telling him to release me before he
    starts an investigation of the East Podunk PD.  Minutes later, I'm a free
    man again.  Unfortunately, TweedleDum and TweedleDee had already charged me
    with criminal trespass, loitering, and stalking(!) so, while I can go, I
    have to come back on Monday to be arraigned.  That was actually fun,
    though, because I got to watch the clerk magistrate grill deputy dawg and
    Chiefie.  (I got the oustanding traffic citation dismissed, too, which,
    since I was, in fact, guilty of that, sort of paid back for all the hassle.)
    
    So, anyway, that whole process pretty much trashed the weekend and Monday.
    I had to resume the interrupted investigation Tuesday but, luckily, the
    perp never twigged to any of this other stuff.  Finally, Wednesday night,
    he got careless and I got some good home movies of him snatching a Caddy.
    I had to go to court today to testify at his arraignment and he's now
    cooling his heels pending bail.
    
    The upshot - I'm now back and ready to play.  I know it's late in the week
    but there's still plenty of time for us to figure out how to spank France
    <g>.  Please drop me a line and let's talk.

    It is dark, very dark.
    
    There is a dim, yellowish light in the distance but it grows no brighter or
    larger as you approach.
    
    You move slowly but surely as the ground here is flat and featureless, at
    least what you can see of it through the dim light and grayish, slightly
    foul haze that clings to you.
    
    >From afar, as from a deep well, tinny and faint, a voice calls out:
    
    
    "hello...?"
    
    
    You pause, listening closely.
    
    
    "can anyone hear me?  anyone?"
    
    
    The voice is weak and faint but clear, almost as if it were right next to you.
    
    
    "is anyone there?"
    
    
    You can't locate the source of the voice, so you resume your shuffle toward
    the light, hoping for some surcease from this endless, mindless wandering
    when you stumble and almost fall.  There is something on the ground at your
    feet.  You bend down to look closer.
    
    
    "it's me.  is that you?"
    
    "Yes", you answer.  "Who are you?"
    
    "the kaiser.  don't you remember me?"
    
    
    You take a step back in surprise.  <The Kaiser?>, you think.  <It can't be.>
    
    You look closer and then you see it.  The dim yellow light glints off it
    evily.  A dark, sweet-smelling substance clings to it and forms a small
    pool below it.  You reach out to touch it and it seems to slip deeper into
    his back.  He groans softly.
    
    
    "What happened?", you ask.
    
    "the frog.  he did it.  without cause."
    
    "He must have had some reason", you say.
    
    "personal gain.  selfishness."
    
    "What of the others?  How have they reacted?", you inquire.
    
    "nothing.  the lion and the bear gloated.  the others - nothing."
    
    
    You rise.  This scene, while strangely appropriate for this desolate
    setting, is too grim even for you.  You shake your head, mutter something
    about "how the mighty have fallen", and move on.  You leave no parting
    words, offer no assistance, give no encouragement.  Instead, you ponder the
    inevitable sadness of it all and wonder how you will react when it is your
    time.  Will you see it coming?  Will you know the moment?
    
    Meanwhile, behind you, you hear:
    
    
    "it's not too late, brother.  there's still time."
    
    
    "it's not too late."

    Jim,
    
    Had some phone conversations with Edi.  He tried selling me on the
    idea that I should leave his centers and work with him still.  I
    expressed my dubiousness.
    
    He called again, and I told him the straight dope, that I couldn't do
    what he asked, and that I was sorry, but I honestly felt it was the
    best thing for me.  He was unhappy, but understood.  Then he did
    something that I felt was rather remarkable, in that he said he
    believed he could engineer a French victory.  I told him that if he
    felt he had enough power to give throw-game leverage to France, more
    power to him, but that I suspected the rest of the board would show
    themselves to be better players than that.  I said it was a bit early
    for talk of solos for France with him only going to about ten centers
    or so for now.
    
    I was surprised he spoke of throw-game leverage to France at this time
    to be honest.  He isn't in very good shape, for one, to make his
    threat very credible.  More importantly, his threat convinced me he
    must be eliminated at all costs, ASAP.
    
    I had been intending to do the safe thing and support myself.  In the
    most recent phone conversation, when I honestly told him I was not
    leaving his centers, I also said I honestly didn't want to see him
    leave the game before Mark (which is true), so he should look to
    Vienna's defense.  I told him that I was going to play it safe.
    
    Now, I'm going to go for it and attack BUD with support.  We'll see if
    we can vaporize Edi completetly.  If not, hey, maybe we can come
    close.

    Edi's now talking throw-game leverage in favor of France, so I'm all
    for taking him out as well.  Obviously, we should try to keep this
    info from France. ;) In any event, France or no, I think the two of us
    will be able to work him over quite well this turn and the turns
    following.  And if he's going to try to play the throw-game leverage
    wild card, I do believe we need to axe him ASAP.

    I sent Italy the word.  Hope he takes it like a man.
    
    Actually, as long as he knows what's going on, he should be in Trieste.
    In fact, his orders are the same regardless.

    After talking this one over quite a lot, Russia and I have agreed to attack
    Munich. This means, I know, that you are not guaranteed recovering Trieste;
    it's now a guessing game.  But we have concluded that taking Germany down
    another notch is very important this turn.  Of course, after last turn's
    unfortunate events, I wanted you to be fully informed.
    
    Russia told Austria that we would attack Vienna.  If he believes it, he'll
    think he can't use Vienna for support.  He'll have to support vie-tri to
    have any hope of hanging on.  If Turkey comes through with the cuts, this
    would put you in Trieste.  Austria suggested to me that he would attack
    Serbia if I did not support him into Venice.  I already told him I would
    have nothing to do with an attack on Italy, so he might go ahead with the
    attack on Serbia.  I think this info should allow you and Turkey to work
    out a devastating attack.
    
    Don't hesitate to contact me about any of this.

    Pitt,
    
    Edi, as you know, is working mightily to effect F-G reconciliation.  I do
    consider this worth exploring.  Your conditions (recover some centers) are
    not excessive, in my view.  Honestly, if Italy had stayed East, I'd want to
    take my chances against you, but F Wes causes me a lot of trouble.
    
    The most important reason we might be able to pull this off is that we both
    seem to be rational players.  Unlike a couple of others in this game who
    launch vendettas or carry grudges, we just make the best moves for our
    countries.  I saw you inching my way, not moving on the eastern front, and
    that I had
    an opportunity to make some gains.  So I struck.  Nothing personal.
    Same for you, I expect.  (Hohn is rational, too, but he thinks he can win,
    so he can't be trusted on anything.)
    
    Now the question is whether the situation calls for rethinking.  I'm open
    to suggestion.  IMO, the game is destined for a draw, so the main question
    is who will be in it.  You and I are probably in, and so is Turkey, like it
    or not.  Italy might survive, although if he comes after me, Turkey will
    eat his lunch.  He's a fool if he can't see it.  Edi, for all his efforts,
    is probably doomed; although he thinks that F-G alliance keeps him alive, I
    don't see why.  So the problem for us is to ensure that we are indeed part
    of the draw.  The only thing to prevent that outcome would be F-G war
    raging while Turkey mops up the easy pickings on his side of the board.
    
    One thing that would help launch a new F-G alliance would be if you'd
    disband Nwy instead of GOB.  Nwy is secure, so it's not a risk, and GOB
    can still help you defend Germany if I were to double-cross you.  If you
    move the fleet to Baltic, it can either support your units or convoy an
    army to Livonia.  This would indicate you are ready to cooperate without
    leaving you exposed.  We can talk over other tactical options after we
    discuss this one.

    Psst!  Hey Mark!
    
    It was a _joke_.  The other option would have been to hold.  Bo-ring.

    Excuse me while I burn your straw man in the town square, Mark, but
    I've never once contested that I've been an architect of your
    downfall.  That still doesn't change the fact that you committed
    suicide this past turn.
    
    > In fact, here's "lame."    Russia writes letters out the kiester -- true,

    Actually, I've been doing plenty of negotiation lately, Mark.  Just
    not with you.  You quickly established yourself to be unreliable in my
    opinion (which is the only opinion that matters, with respect to my
    own moves), and then later on you became mostly irrelevant to me.  I
    rejected your offers because for one I wasn't sure of their sincerity,
    and for two because I felt it was in my better interest to continue
    working with Edi at those points.
    
    But I was never remiss in my negotiations when they mattered.  For
    example, on the first turn or two with you.  Then again on the turn I
    stabbed you.
    
    > If you call Russia's sacrifice "suicide,"  then the Alamo was suicide;

    You exited the game without even trying to survive.  That's as good as
    suicide in my book.
    
    I'm honestly disappointed, Mark.  I firmly believe that good players
    should always act in their own best interests.  Survival is key to
    that, of course.  To subordinate your own interests to John to the
    point where you will accept death rather than try to continue is not
    Good Play, not in my opinion.  Please take that opinion for whatever
    worth you choose; I won't mind.
    
    The only valid exception that comes to mind is throw-game leverage,
    and since that is a situation where you would be dead anyway, or when
    another person solos thus resulting in a loss, there's no real
    downside.  Maintaining credibility and honor in a situation like that
    is as good a reason as any.
    
    But that's not the case here.  It's too early for throw-game leverage,
    and your one unit wasn't occupying that crucial role with respect to
    throw-game leverage in any event.
    
    I've been down to one, and I eventually made it up to a decent number
    of units and a place in a draw.  I've been down to two, and I've made
    it back to win the game.  So long as there is life, there is hope.
    
    Gosh, Hohn Cho an optimist.  Who'd a thunk it?

    Hate to tell you, but aside from your relatively quick collapse, your
    actions had no impact on my decision to stab Edi.  It was sheerly a
    decision based on perceived self-interest.  No offense.

    I think that's too bad, because those are actually reasons I could
    understand more readily.  Or at least a reason to turn the position
    over to someone.

    I can most certainly question the move.  Every one of us has been in a
    similar situation before, Mark.
    
    > But I saw the

    If you're playing toady to some other power to the extent that you
    choose death over an attempt at life, you're not playing to win (or
    participate in a draw).  And playing to win is what this game's about,
    IMO.  Show me an "expert" player (whatever that is) and I'll show you
    a cutthroat, drive-for-18-or-settle-reluctantly-for-a-draw player.
    
    > And I honestly figured Edi and Pitt would
    > order in such a way as to ensure I would've died (once again, fooled even
    > in their antipathy).
    
    Never know unless you try.  And your way, you had no chance for
    survival.
    
    > This *is*, last time I checked, only a game, for those more rabid for
    > victory than me....
    
    I'm surprised you're trotting this tired argument out, Mark.
    
    Of course it's just a game.  Why do you think it took a back seat to
    my job?  Funny, you were just criticizing me for that, weren't you?
    
    But if you're going to take on the endeavor of playing in such a game,
    especially one with other "experts," you _should_ be taking it
    seriously.  Seriously enough to try to fulfill the objectives of the
    game, namely recording a win or a draw, IMO.
    
    Those are my honest and sincere opinions on a subject that, in the
    context of Diplomacy, I feel strongly about.  And as blunt and
    strongly worded as those opinions may be, and even considering the
    obviously opposing viewpoints we're taking here, I intend no offense.
    There's also no ulterior motive here, since you are after all now gone
    from the game. I'm just calling 'em like I see 'em.
    
    And again, you and anyone else should take my opinions for exactly
    what they are: merely my opinions.  Assign whatever worth you choose
    to them.

    The Italian Armada is preparing to execute one of its famous "feint west,
    strike east" manouevers; a trick with which the Grand Duke must himself be
    painfully familiar. Yes, it's slow, but it has proved to be *so* effective.
    
    Or it might be the second half of a drawn-out "feint east, strike west",
    it's so hard to tell, that's the beauty of the routine.
    
    Or possibly the exTsar is colorblind and failed to notice what was going
    on. Those greens look a lot like deep blues. But the yellows really do

    As for the Russian salutation, I might add that the main reason I stayed
    quiet vs Russia in the last two seasons was that it appeared that the
    higher communication gave more attention to our plight and as such I felt
    that a low profile was needed. I thank the Russian for his final move which
    allowed me to  pull off the temporary stop in the east against the Turk and
    the Italians.
    
    Ex-Russia might want to take another look at the board in regard to the
    French-Italian relations and he will see that the Italian has turned
    against him despite the fact that Turkey has repeatedly stabbed him.
    
    In retrospect I still find some of Russia's diplomatic moves and slashing
    manner against multiple neighbors rather odd, however I suspect that the
    odd combination of player styles, backgrounds, combined with the higher
    profile of the game may have encouraged Russia to take a more risky course
    of action than he might otherwise attend to.  Have a good vacation and we
    will see you when we see you.

    John,
    
    >Edi, as you know, is working mightily to effect F-G reconciliation.  I do
    >consider this worth exploring.
    
    Glad to hear that.
    
    You know, I kicked myself after the moves processed because I was almost
    *certain* that you were going to stab me (the suggestion for BER-SIL, TYR S
    MUN-BOH tipped your hand) but I talked myself out of it.  I was afraid that
    I might be wrong and I didn't want to give you an excuse to attack me if I
    moved to defend prematurely.
    
    It was a good short-term move on your part, although I don't think that you
    are in a position to realize any ultimate long-term gain, especially given
    Turkey's position and Italy's moves.
    
    Anyway, we've now both been on the receiving end of an unprovoked attack by
    the other.  Last time, Edi helped convince me to ally with you to our
    mutual gain.  Hopefully, we'll be able to do it again this time, with you
    making the decision to re-ally with me.
    
    >Your conditions (recover some centers) are not excessive, in my view.
    
    Thanks.  I sincerely want to achieve a rapprochement but, in order to do
    so, I have to feel that I'm not going to expose myself to another stab.  At
    the moment, I think I'm in pretty good shape to give you a run for your
    money.  Oh, you'd get the better of me eventually but not, I think, before
    Hohn could pull off a solo.  That's why I think it is still in both our
    best interests to get back together.
    
    >The most important reason we might be able to pull this off is that we both
    >seem to be rational players.  Unlike a couple of others in this game who

    I'm glad you feel that way.  I play to maximize my interests, always, but,
    after all, it is only a game.  It's foolish to allow an emotional response
    to another player's moves or press to affect your plans.  No matter what
    has gone before, you always need to step back and examine the current
    situation in terms of what is best for you *now*.  If that means working
    with the guy who just stabbed you (so long as you can work out a plan that
    benefits both of you), so be it.
    
    After all, I'm a Diplomat - I have no morals.
    
    ;-)
    
    
    >(Hohn is rational, too, but he thinks he can win,
    >so he can't be trusted on anything.)
    
    heh...If he doesn't have to worry about an FG alliance, he might well be
    able to pull of a solo, though.
    
    >IMO, the game is destined for a draw
    
    Agreed.  Unless several of us totally screw up, we should have a draw.
    
    >You and I are probably in, and so is Turkey, like it
    >or not.
    
    I'd agree that you and Turkey are a lock and, if my prediction that Turkey
    solos if you and I don't patch things up is true, I guess I'm in, too.
    
    >Italy might survive, although if he comes after me, Turkey will
    >eat his lunch.
    
    Eventually, yes.  I suspect that Hohn will polish off Austria, first, and
    then munch on Italy.  In fact, I'd be very surprised if Hohn wasn't pushing
    Cal to move on you and promising him some Austrian SC's as part of the deal.
    
    
    >Edi, for all his efforts,

    It keeps him alive for awhile anyway, if we move our MUN and BER armies
    east and, right now, I think Edi is just trying to buy time to stay in the
    game.  Thus, FG is his best bet.

    Hm.
    
    I don't have my trusty MacDip here at home. My gut feeling is that you have
    to continue to use practically everything against Pitt, because you've let
    him into the North Sea. You have to crush him now. Sheesh. I really think
    you shouldn't have let him into Nth.
    
    Well, we'll see what he disbands. Probably the backward fleet.
    
    Probably you have at least a year until Hohn does anything that will

    >From the ethereal darkness, the disembodied voice of Tsar Faz can be
    heard wailing plaintively, yet accusingly, as certain European monarchs
    listen in rapt silence...
    
    "Soooo....this is what it comes to, eh?   Russia fights loyally with its
    allies, and we are accused of suiciding?  Suicide?  If it be suicide,
    then it was Kevorkian-like Physician-assisted suicide from the combined
    Medical Houses of Europe.    Russia would have preferred to strike for
    Vienna, but that move depended on a couple other actors contributing.  As
    he has done *every* turn since 1902, Turkey prefers to be in the dominant
    position, dictating terms, vice cooperating.  (Oh, but thanks for
    convoying me to Switzerland, Hohn; much appreciated, and tactically
    brilliant, if I don't say so myself.)  Turkey accusing Russia of
    suiciding is as lame (or even moreso) than the initial accusation of
    Russian lameness.   The only "lameness" in Russia are my legs and
    backside, from being stabbed and kicked around all game, like some
    sandlot football or whipped cur.  I'm "limping lamely" out of my
    gravesite, is all.  And in no small measure due to Turkish blows.
    Harumph.
    
    In fact, here's "lame."    Russia writes letters out the kiester -- true,
    as of late only to the West -- and gets drilled repeatedly this game.
    Yet others, with their 20-hour workdays, their weird workshifts, or their
    game attitudes, can't be "bothered" with communicating or with seeing a
    different board approach.  *That* is lame.  What of other's "efforts,"
    (ha!) -- those  who figured Russia wasn't worth communicating to on a
    'real' mutual basis,  and thus wrote only self-serving pap -- can we not
    call that "lame" as well?  As for the newly-stabbed victims, well...the
    proof is in the pudding there, too.   People who live in glass houses....
    
    If you call Russia's sacrifice "suicide,"  then the Alamo was suicide;
    falling on a grenade to save your buddy is suicide; and (gasp!) Obi-Whan
    Kenobi's fight with Darth Vader!!) can be considered  "suicide."   Would
    any real person make such comparisons.  Russia begs to differ on
    terminology.
    
    Russia had a chance to help annihilate Austria.  *Nothing* would have
    been more satisfying than to occupy the Teflon King's Viennese palace and
    inflict some reverse humiliation on him.  However, that option involved
    trusting the East -- and we know what "trust" means to A/T/G types.  So
    we jumped at  the chance  to instead hurt the man who, when we had the
    chance to keep Russia at 2-3 and solidify the Eastern Ramparts against
    A/T, did nothing but stab me.  To see Kaiser Pitt reduced three this turn
    -- and be a potential "creme filling" in the F/T Oreo cookie -- well,
    that's equally good to see.
    
    Austria stays at three, and, knowing the "birds of a feather" mentality,
    Russia expects to see at least an attempted rappraochement between A and
    T...although these two buzzards will now be one very large bird, and one
    smaller, squawking one....with the runt always looking to check his
    tailfeathers.  To see these foes come to blows before my death was one
    small wish come true.
    
    Italy has a special pantheon reserved in the afterlife.  He, like
    England, was loyal and set his sights on a common goal.  France owes
    Italy eternal gratitude for turning East and stopping the A/T meance.
    And we remember how one little BOH unit tied up multiple enemy forces for
    quite awhile *and* helped Cal get centers...and we smile, from the grave,
    about that.
    
    To England, who always wanted Good Works with Russia and instead got
    Buffoonery Personified from my poor play:  I wish you survival and the
    chance to hurt common enemies.  You deserved better.  I *told* you I'd
    die before you (gad, what a thing to be right about)!
    
    To France, who awoke from an early-game slumber, beset upon by two
    enemies and a menacing Hun, only to now be the game co-leader:  treat
    well your green and navy blue friends.  See if you can make the Hun
    grovel on your terms, or else crush his big behind.   Listen well to the
    Sultan, but when his forked tongue emerges, make sure you have snake-oil
    antidote -- just in case.  And for the Archduke, well...if *he's* still
    around after a few turns, buy a Teflon frying pan from him, but don't
    take any of his lottery tickets or deeds to the Brooklyn Bridge.
    
    Russia enjoyed the heck out of this game, if only to see "true ghods" in
    action.  Many of your game moves drove me to distraction (obviously, as I
    was outplayed and now dead), but it was still a good thing to try, and I
    hope you guys are enjoying it as well (and you Observers, too).
    First-class players, all the way!
    
    Reality check:  yes, I'm going on vacation next week.  And yes, I'll then
    be in the field for all summer, returning in mid-August to get ready to
    teach.  But it wasn't for either of those reasons that I chose to support
    France.  Quite honestly, I could've stuck around on someone else's
    perpetual "life support" system as a 1-center pawn (an influential one,
    yes, but one still destined to never regain my homeland and thus build).
    And I wanted to do that with Hohn, and Pitt, and anyone else willing to
    deal.  I've had my share of vacuous words.  Maybe when you're at 10, or
    6, or even at 3, you can legitimately question the move.  But I saw the
    chance to better aid an ally this way -- with me in MUN,  I become an
    obstacle to French expansion.  And I honestly figured Edi and Pitt would
    order in such a way as to ensure I would've died (once again, fooled even
    in their antipathy).   We gambled that France's move would succeed,
    whereas a Russian thrust may or may not have succeeded.  Better to go for
    the sure thing, even if meant my death.  Again, question it if you will,
    but from the game perspective, I thought this was the better way.  My
    death is the last strategic move I could do to influence the game.  Sure,
    it frees me up for other games, as well as my real job and life (some of
    you should relate, as mentioned earlier), but that was always secondary.
    I fight in every game to the death, and a one-center Russia (while
    discussed  with France even until the last day of deadline) would've been
    just ducky.  But so is helping reduce Pitt, and watching Austria be the
    speedbump in the middle of the F/T/I  highway.
    
    This *is*, last time I checked, only a game, for those more rabid for
    victory than me....
    
    Russia thus ceases its speaking from the grave.  BirSauron may now return
    to hearing his own dark whispers across the Transylvanian countryside
    (those are jackals outside your walls, BeerSon, not voices of salvation).
     Hohn  "Go with the Flow" Cho may return to his busy work schedule,
    emerging to make a quickie deal with his next accomplice in crime.   The
    Pitt-Meister can find a way to retain his 6 in the face of a big E/F, and
    ruminate on his stab (ah, the poetic justice of it all).   We wish him
    every offer he gave to us -- and  "more."    And the West, well...EFI can
    see what transpires, make the appropriate deals, and hopefully  -- once,
    perhaps -- say, "thanks, Tsar," for the ultimate sacrifice and for
    helping.  At least that's we hope."
    
    And with that, the willowly wisp of Tsar Faz -- shrouded in liquid white,
    just as his dissolved units were all game -- ascended (A-scended!?, says
    England) into Dip Valhalla, where he could better watch the events on the
    board unfold.
    
    Good gaming to you all, and to Jim-Bob:  thanks for the chance to play,
    and for being an outstanding pubber, GM, and friend.   We shall yet cross
    paths again...it was *great* to talk again with you during this game's

    I know what you mean.  Still, what are the chances that Edi might back off
    on you in order to allow you the opportunity to assist me with France?
    It's starting to look like an F draw (or, more realistically, an F or T
    solo).  If you and work on France, Edi can work on Turkey (maybe even with
    your help).

    France is at ten, only.  And he can't build in MAR, which is a happy

    for this to be easy...

    I agree, wiping Edi out still seems like the right call.  He's being
    difficult still, and he's trying to deal for a center or two back, and
    I'm telling him no, and he's still threatening throw-game leverage.
    
    Looks like it's me, you and Pitt against John, Edi and Jamie.

    Sounds good.  What do you think about your removal?  I'm thinking A

    kick him out in fall.  Thoughts?

    I did want to mention one other thing.  This game is destined for a draw.
    We are all role players, in that sense.  The question for Italy is whether
    you will be part of the draw.  I am quite certain I will be, but your
    situation is more precarious.  That's just the nature of playing Italy, and
    I do think that you have done about as well as anyone can do from what is
    no doubt the worst starting position in the game.  I hope you make it to
    the end.

<p><a name=169></a><b>Private message from <font color=00cccc>France</font> to <font color=008800>Italy</font>:</b><pre>
    Let's review the situation.  Not out of the goodness of my heart, but
    because I have the greatest interest in having Italy as a friend, I have
    supported you, never attacked you, and now, because you found it so
    distressing to be left in the dark, told you everything I had planned.
    Your response is to move against me, leaving yourself, I might note,  open
    to Turkey's inevitable attack.  The only way your attack can succeed in any
    reasonable time is to allow Turkish fleets out of the corner.  Are you
    really ready to trust him that far?  Has he done anything but double-cross
    you?  Why should he do otherwise?  Not that Hohn's a bad guy, but Turkey
    has no interest in a health Italy.
    
    I also observe that Turkey's so-called attack on Austria was awfully weak.
    In fact, it's almost as if Austria knew what was coming.  Granted, Edi's
    tactics were nothing short of brilliant, but still, knowing Turkey would be
    so limp-wristed must have made his task easier.  My prediction: Turkey will
    shove Austrian armies right up your behind.  You might like to know that
    the first message I received was from Edi, on how to wipe out Italy.
    
    My builds are obvious, so you know what's coming.  I suggest that when you
    select which unit to remove, you consider what would defend Italy against
    A-T.  You will have France's help, even now, if you only ask.

    The shadow of the master once again falls over the Dark Tower in Vienna.
    Purged from its moat is the foul dropping of the Roman pagan dogs.  Liberation
    in Trieste was also hard won but again the vile legions of green slime have
    been vanquished.
    
    While at the height of these military victories which once again demonstrated
    (if not in a somewhat vulgar manner) the Golden Age ESP feared by those who
    should have known better, BirSauron can not help to be sadden at the
    degeneration of the Turkish hordes to greed, avarice and rampant disorder.
    "What a shame it is that what could have been has come to settle for such a
    display as what we have witnessed.  Is there no sanity in this world that has
    not been sucked into a vat of self focused engrossment and envy for the
    economy of those about them?"
    As he looked into the setting sun, the Lord of Darkness sent an age old
    whisper to be carried on the winds to the west and north:
    'Come, Come, Come to the Darkside."

    I had hoped things would be a lot more settled now, but unfortunately,

    wiped out and it would be a simple case of beating France down while
    keeping an eye on Hohn.  With Edi around, I can't mount as effective an

    the result, I've enjoyed your letters and hope we meet again in a game
    somewhere.
    
    I would like to ask one question though.  Since your final moves didn't
    even try for a centre and allowed Edi to survive quite intact, I'm
    wondering when you switched Pitt with Edi in the role of anti-Christ
    this game?  I figured you would have wanted to be in on the elimination
    of Austria.  Admittedly, given Hohn's moves (which were predicated on
    the fact that you guys weren't going to hit Vie), it wouldn't have
    happened, but I still don't understand supporting John against Pitt.
    Even if John insisted, why didn't you insist on staying around for a
    while.  Oh wait, brainwave, was it your upcoming vacation?
    Anyway, good luck and hope to cross paths or swords again.

    Napoleon,
    
    First things first:
    I assume you will build a fleet and an army. I assume Germany will disband
    the F Bot. I don't know what Italy will do; I will assume the worst, that
    he disbands the F Adr, since otherwise it would surely be the F Wes,
    changing his mind.
    
    (Along these lines, I have heard nothing from you since the move, but I
    certainly hope you are negotiating feverishly with Italy. I *think* I made
    clear to you my feeling that Italy was on the fence; maybe you didn't
    bother talking to him last season? If Turkey should build even one fleet,
    you could definitely use that to your bargaining advantage with Italy.
    I am happy to try to approach Italy for you -- I did tell him last year
    that I believed that of the two of you and Hohn, you would be the safer
    ally for him; apparently to no good end, though.)
    
    Then consider what I mentioned before last move: Germany might convoy an
    army to Edi from Denmark. Also Kie-Den, Ber S Ruh-Kie. The armies are in
    retreat, but they will snag your two English centers and your hopes of
    regaining them soon are small. For this reason, I suggest Hel-Den.
    
    If you don't like that, I suggest as an alternative Hel-Kie, while you try
    to take Ruhr from Belgium (with Mun supporting). This should be a fairly
    safe move, and if Germany merely tries to sit tight in Nth and take Edi in
    the Fall with the fleet, you'd have pretty strong counterplay against Kiel.
    (I bet Germany will *not* try for London.)
    
    I don't think Italy can do any damage this year. I wonder how aggressive
    he'll be, in light of the Turkish navy over his shoulder. We'll see, I
    guess.
    
    I am a bit worried that you will make a peace with Germany again, so as to
    concentrate on Italy. I think this would be a great error, myself. I know
    it would spell a rapid end for me, but I mean a great error for *you*.
    
    If you prefer to wait to see the adjustments before embarking on any
    analysis, I'll be patient.

    Speaking only for our royal self, we can just say that we know on which
    side our bread is buttered.
    
    And note in passing that the Gut Kaiser had every opportunity to have the
    mighty British navy on HIS side instead, but oddly chose to aggrandize the
    French last year (by asking our northern fleet to move to Norway, though
    the Kaiser knew it would be useless, instead of telling it to guard
    Edinburgh against the French). Now it's time to pay debts: the Counselor of
    the Exchequer has his pen hand at the ready, and the Kaiser had better have
    some draughts prepared, too.

    >All my former friends would tell you what a nice guy I was (if they could

    So we asked ourself, "Former friend of the Kaiser, is he really a nice
    guy?" But we couldn't think of anything to say.

    You resign, of course. You just signon, and type the one word 'resign'.
    
    (But are you sure you want to unplug? Won't you miss the drip, drip, drip of

    Same way. Signon as an observer, and then add 'resign'.
    
    C. I rather enjoyed reading all the tirades and stuff, I was just giving
    Mark a hard time about the long-windedness. Pot calling kettle black, kinda

    I suspect John will be working with Edi against you almost regardless.
    But I think we can manage, me you and Pitt.

    If you keep ADR and VEN (obviously) and NAP and WES, that's as good as
    or better than keeping ADR and VEN, and NAP and TUN.
    
    That army is just sort of hanging out there, and is of limited use.
    Getting it back to the continent is inefficient, in that it ties up
    two units.  Moreover, a fleet in TUN for the endgame is much more
    crucial, as it can support TYS, whereas an army cannot.

    > And again, your thoughts?
    
    My thoughts are that we can take Edi and John, especially with Pitt's
    help.  My armies will be moving to bring Edi down, and I don't think
    he'll be able to withstand.  ADR and VEN can defend pretty admirably
    for a small while, and I believe keeping F WES is important to keep
    the pressure on France.
    
    Look at it this way.  If you disband F WES, France will have no
    incentive to hold A MAR back.  It will go straight into PIE.  At least
    this way, you can make him think, and hopefully he'll move to SPA to
    cover.  If he moves to PIE, you're going to have difficulties keeping
    VEN.  Everything we can do to forestall the move to PIE is important,
    IMO.  Otherwise, we have a guessing game and it becomes a big pain.
    
    I want to keep you viable because I can't do it alone.  And I
    _certainly_ want to take Edi down.  Couple that to my desire to stop
    John from winning, and I think keeping F WES alive and disbanding that
    army in TUN is key.  Again, we can push France back and build a solid
    wall of fleets to greet him (and even push him back, perhaps) once he
    gets done with Pitt.  We will have a much harder time doing that with
    an army in TUN.

    Look at it from my point of view.  If I piss off France any more than
    I have, he and Edi have the potential to take me down to three or two
    centres.  It would certainly fit Edi's game-throwing threats.  At 2 or
    3 centres, I think I'd be taking a chance on your/France's goodwill.
    I prefer to be large enough to be INdespensible as opposed to the

    Frankly, as far as the BIG picture goes, I agree completely.
    Unfortunately, with Edi on one side and John on the other and both
    hostile, I may not have the luxury of looking at other than the local
    picture.

    I will definitely consider it as I REALLY want to find reasons to

    is that I can survive at a decent size until Edi is no longer a factor.

    Well Mark, you have done what few people have managed to do in the
    past.  You've outwinded me. ;) I don't have the time or energy to
    respond point by point to your last message.
    
    Suffice it to say that while I understand your position, I still
    disagree with it quite strongly.  In Diplomacy, people should play to
    win, or for a draw.  But anyway, perhaps it's just best to agree to
    disagree here.
    
    Regardless, I did enjoy playing with you, Mark (even if we never were
    able to reach quite the same wavelength at quite the same time), and I
    wish you the best in your endeavors.

    Guys,
    **It seems Hohn has an opinion about my broadcast message...while part of
    my earlier distaribe was a joke (you know, like his convoy of me to
    Switzerland -- ha ha, I get it now!!), I want to say my piece...again.
    (Jamie, this is your cue for the "long-winded broadcast message" thing

    and "unobserve?"
    
    OK, read on!

    It was a _joke_.  The other option would have been to hold.  Bo-ring.
    
    ** Oh, *NOW* it's obvious!  Gosh, I wish I'd played the game longer and

    Excuse me while I burn your straw man in the town square, Mark, but
    I've never once contested that I've been an architect of your
    downfall.  That still doesn't change the fact that you committed
    suicide this past turn.

    observation.  IMO, I consider "suiciding out" in Dip to be when you throw
    a multi-center country completely in one direction, or just give up the
    ghost willy-nilly, for no ulterior purpose.  This one-center "fade-out"
    had a different complexion to it, IMO.  I know you disagree, me hearty.

    Actually, I've been doing plenty of negotiation lately, Mark.  Just
    not with you.  You quickly established yourself to be unreliable in my
    opinion (which is the only opinion that matters, with respect to my
    own moves), and then later on you became mostly irrelevant to me.
    
    ** Would that "irrelevant" part be after your first, or second,  stab of
    me?
    C'mon, I realize you've been dealing with others besides me.  The
    Germano-Turk slice up north was nice, and you've obviously been dealing
    with Italy for awhile; Lord knows you screwed him a couple more times
    than me as of late, and then there was his "conversion" to head west
    again, inspired by your silver tongue.   I never doubted you were
    conversing with someone.  i guess I kind of got bummed out that after
    1901, you *seemingly*  excluded me completely in your computations and
    decided that a multiple retaliation/having the last word "your way" was
    the path you were going to take.  But hey, that's why you're at 10 and
    I'm dead.
    
      I rejected your offers because for one I wasn't sure of their
    sincerity,
    
    ** Well, there's a novel reason.  I should've probably done the same
    after 1902....
    
    and for two because I felt it was in my better interest to continue
    working with Edi at those points.
    
    ** Logical and understood.  It made you the power you are today; why
    trifle with success?
    
    But I was never remiss in my negotiations when they mattered.  For
    example, on the first turn or two with you.  Then again on the turn I
    stabbed you.
    
    ** And then on the next stab, and the follow-ups...let's not forget your
    up-frontness there, too.
    
    > If you call Russia's sacrifice "suicide,"  then the Alamo was suicide;
    > falling on a grenade to save your buddy is suicide; and (gasp!)

    Would
    > any real person make such comparisons.  Russia begs to differ on

    You exited the game without even trying to survive.  That's as good as
    suicide in my book.
    
    ** Well, you're reading from the Cliff notes.  I played the odds to make
    what I thought was the best move for the alliance I was with.  Had I
    tried and not succeeded, I'd still be dead, and Germany would be even
    instaed of  -1.   Hindsight is always 20-20.  I guess I figured as I was
    increasingly "irrelevant"  in your (and others') computations, then I
    should go with the sure-odds takedown of MUN, rather than risk a 1-center
    life.  We disagree on this, but quite honestly, it's no BFD....
    
    I'm honestly disappointed, Mark.  I firmly believe that good players
    should always act in their own best interests.  Survival is key to
    that, of course.  To subordinate your own interests to John to the
    point where you will accept death rather than try to continue is not
    Good Play, not in my opinion.  Please take that opinion for whatever
    worth you choose; I won't mind.
    
    ** I understand fully.  Most times I'd agree with you.  But why be
    disappointed?  I tried to deal with others throughout the game.   Despite
    Edi's description of it as "slash and burn," those 'slashes" were always
    designed with a partner in mind:  'slash' Turkey with Austria in 1901;
    'slash' Austria after proving my intentions to you in 1902;   "Slash" A/T
    with a German ally and be his puppet.  Nothing worked.  Does that mean I
    shouldn't have gone down to the wire and fought-on, Nazi-like in my 1945
    Gotterdammerung?  Pah.  One center dies so another can live.   It doesn't
    disappoint me as much as it does you, apparently.   Again, that's your
    view, and I respect it.
    
    The only valid exception that comes to mind is throw-game leverage,
    and since that is a situation where you would be dead anyway, or when
    another person solos thus resulting in a loss, there's no real
    downside.  Maintaining credibility and honor in a situation like that
    is as good a reason as any.
    
    But that's not the case here.  It's too early for throw-game leverage,
    and your one unit wasn't occupying that crucial role with respect to
    throw-game leverage in any event.
    
    ** How about, "I got tired of being pummeled?"  "I saw no growth
    potential after seizing Vienna?"  or something equally inane?   Again,
    our views of alliance, loyalty, and game objectives differ here.   That's
    ok.
    
    I've been down to one, and I eventually made it up to a decent number
    of units and a place in a draw.  I've been down to two, and I've made
    it back to win the game.  So long as there is life, there is hope.
    
    ** You're seemingly one of the rabid victory guys I dragged out the tired
    argument about (below); I'm not--at least not for this game.    Look,
    Hohn, when you were all of 12, I was phoning in orders from central Saudi
    Arabia at 2 a.m., using half of my weekly five-minute overseas morale
    call allocation to send orders, vice talking to my wife.  Please don't
    consider me a Dip wimp when you've only observed this game.  I've won a
    lot of games, and I've lost a lot of games...and I've survived in a lot
    of games.  The fun comes from playing, as well as from the interaction
    and the *hope* of  gain.   Quite honestly, the interaction wasn't as
    great as I'd have hoped for after 1902, and your superior play (as well
    as G and A)  helped ensure my gains would be near-zero.  In this game, I
    just didn't feel like being the perpetual water boy, sitting on the bench
    watching you guys make the great plays, just so I could wear my trophy
    ring and say "I was part of the team."   That's seemingly where we
    differ.  Again, no biggie.
    
    ** With Dip,  I can be  -- and have been -- as  rabid and as dedicated as
    the next player when it comes to loving and playing this game.  I have
    never NMR'd in 21 years of play, and I've called in orders from equally
    distant and bizarre places.  You don't need to sermonize me on the need
    to fight to the death in a game.  I just didn't do it this turn/game.
    It wasn't fun anymore.   And I doubt any of you feel "cheated' that poor
    ol' Russia -- with his acerbic cynicism and with his 'goofy' play style
    -- has died.

    Hate to tell you, but aside from your relatively quick collapse, your
    actions had no impact on my decision to stab Edi.  It was sheerly a
    decision based on perceived self-interest.  No offense.
    
    ** None taken.  Your steely-eyed logic once again showed itself.  I
    expected nothing less, and nothing more!,  from you.   And don't call me

    I think that's too bad, because those are actually reasons I could
    understand more readily.  Or at least a reason to turn the position
    over to someone.
    
    ** I don't like to give someone else my "sloppy seconds" via abandoned
    positions.  And to say I'm "suiciding" because I want to go on vacation
    would be a laughable excuse, if you really knew me.  Those reasons are to
    me what my last turn action probably is to you, Hohn.

    I can most certainly question the move.  Every one of us has been in a
    similar situation before, Mark.
    
    ** See my 'sermonizing' reference, above.
    
    > But I saw the

    If you're playing toady to some other power to the extent that you
    choose death over an attempt at life, you're not playing to win (or
    participate in a draw).  And playing to win is what this game's about,
    IMO.
    
    ** Yup; that's what the rules say.
    
     Show me an "expert" player (whatever that is) and I'll show you

    I'm surprised you're trotting this tired argument out, Mark.
    Of course it's just a game.  Why do you think it took a back seat to

    Not gonna happen.  Edi is threatening to throw the game France's way
    unless
    Turkey lets him live.  That would take the form of working with France
    AGAINST me to help France across the stalemate line.  Now, since I

    Sure.  Why not remove that army sitting out in the middle of nowhere
    in TUN?  We can make sure that wherever John retreats TYS, we will
    boot him out in the fall.
    
    John's the big threat, now.  He's the one who can romp through the
    north and center and grab for TUN for 18.  My units are way out of
    position, and Edi is very alive and kicking.  I think it's crucial
    that we maintain a forward defense against John, so that a stalemate
    line can be achieved.
    
    I'm in this with you all the way now, Cal.  Edi is leaving me no
    choice.  He's leaving none of us any choice.  His throw-game threat,
    while I still don't think it's that large, is still possible.  (I just
    haven't given him the satisfaction of telling him that I think that's

    something else F@#$s it up.

    Yeah, but not good ones.  My entire plan was predicated on Edi being
    down to no more than one.  I figured I'd have the luxury of facing
    ONE direction for a change.   Sigh.  It's pretty apparent that I'm
    going to have to remove that fleet in Western.  Anything else will
    leave me open to Edi and, unfortunately, you aren't in a position
    to help yet.
    
    In case you're wondering (hey, this IS Diplomacy! :)  ), no, I'm NOT
    turning back against you; I just think that for me to survive, Edi must
    die and I'm in trouble because he hasn't.  I certainly hope you
    understand that I have to pull up against France (for now anyway).
    
    Your thoughts?

    I was in steady communication with Italy before the moves, and I have sent
    him several messages since.  He's finally responded, just now.  He says he
    was still upset over being left out of the loop, that Turkey could be
    stopped as easily later as now, I'm over the stalemate line, and he thought
    Edi would be down to one unit.  Because the last is not true, he's
    rethinking.
    
    Can we dislodge nth?  That would prevent the convoy.

    He does if I'm a counterbalance against you.  Like you he realizes that
    this game is between France & Turkey with me as the balance of power.
    Neither of you can afford to see me eliminated (although with Edi still
    at 3, this is less certain) because that would (eventually) put both of
    you too close to 18 for the other to trust.  I've been counting on that
    for a while.

    Hohn answered this in his broadcast earlier.  He had planned to take out
    Budapest until you and Russia backed out of YOUR supposed intention of
    taking Vienna.  Like Hohn, I don't understand Russia's actions in going
    out with a whimper.  I know I'd never do that if i was in his position.
    (Who knows?  You may get a chance to see me prove this...grin)

    Well, considering that Edi is around at 3 centres, I guess I better ask.
    My only hope in this game is to be, as mentioned above, the swingman
    between you and Turkey.  That means Edi has to go and I certainly can't
    do it on my own.

    Since I have other mail from you to answer, I'll keep this one short.
    
    1- I was still upset by your previous "perfidy".
    2- You have a better chance to cross the board-wide stalemate line
       than Hohn and thereby win the game.
    3- I felt Hohn could be stopped as easily later as sooner, so it
       made more sense to go against you when the opportunity presented
       itself.
    4- I THOUGHT Edi was going down to no more than one centre.  Having
       him STILL at 3 will probably change my plans.  That will probably
       depend on you.

    Well, Italy's message to you about seals it.  He's got an odd perspective
    on things.  He blamed me for his undoing.  In fact,  he refused to believe
    me when I told him I would not support him in Vienna.  He went ahead as if.
     I also told him I did not want to move to Ion, but still he executed the
    order.  And it's all my fault.  Last turn, I went as far as I could to make
    things right, and he attacked me.
    
    He'll be lucky to survive.  The way things are going we might end with that
    TGF draw after all.
    
    To be explicit, yes, I would give up Mun and Hol next year.  My fleet in
    Holland would hold to support and to kill the English fleet.  It would then
    go to the Med.  We'd create a lot of DMZs, I think, more or less by
    default, but we can call 'em that too.
    
    So, we hit Warsaw together, right?

    >I'm curious.  Why'd you disband F NWY instead of F GOB?
    
    It was a tough call.  Initially, I planned on disbanding F BOT so I could
    hold the NTH this spring and take EDI in the fall.  However, the more I
    looked at the board, the more I realized that I needed BOT-BAL in the
    spring to cover BER/KIE or BAL-SWE to cover NOR/DEN.  I still can retreat
    to EDI if he dislodges NTH in the spring and, if I gamble and move DEN-SWE
    or BAL-SWE, bounce him in NOR/DEN in the fall.
    
    My major concern is not losing any more home SC's.  I'll just have to
    slowly write off the peripheral SC's until some help arrives via pressure
    on France in the south (hint, hint).

    His press to me last night regarding his feelings about you and Edi would
    indicate that he'd rather have that happen than let either of you make any
    more gains.  He actually said that he knew that Hohn might have an easier
    chance at a solo based on what he (Cal) was going to do but he didn't care.
     All the more reason that we have to do something quick to slow Turkey down.

    Yes and definitely yes.  Meaning, just to be clear, that I retake HOL and
    MUN while you take LON, correct?  And NTH and NWG become DMZ's effective
    immediately?  Also, where does your HOL fleet go?

    Yes, it's not a bad sign, but I always get suspicious when I see a good
    sign. :)
    
    Well, ok, see how things go with Italy. I doubt you'll get much info, since
    he'll probably say the same thing no matter what he decides. Maybe not --
    he might try to be honest even if he isn't going to swing back against
    Turkey, keeping in mind the fact that he's almost certain to need your good
    will later. But I doubt it. He'll tell you he's going to sit on the fence
    this move, I bet.
    
    BTW, I guess I'm somewhat more inclined (for you) to try to retake Nth, now
    that you could either take it from Eng and keep the fleet Hol where it is,
    or else take it from Hol and cover London. With Norway uncovered it's a
    stronger tactical position (though presumably Bot-Swe? or is he headed for
    Bal for defense?), and the German F Nth is unsupported. An interesting move
    might be Eng-Nth, Hel S Eng-Nth, Bre-Eng. Then you could retake London if
    he retreats there, so probably he'd retreat to Edi, which is less dangerous
    for you (and a lot less dangerous for me!). The risk is that Nth-Eng keeps
    the new fleet in port, an awful position.
    
    You might also think of offering the assistance of Tyo to Italy, maybe on
    the condition that the Italian moves are not hostile in Spring. On the
    theory that a German attack on Munich doesn't look so good (probably fails,
    might lose Kie, you'd just retreat behind his lines unless TUR War-Sil).
    
    Let me know when your plans start to gel.

    I basically mentioned the same thing, with a little more detail.
    
    Interesting fact:
    Even if you lose a center, you don't disband, of course; and even if
    Germany should gain a center, he probably won't have anyplace to build.

    Hmmmm.
    Removed the fleet in Norway?? What do you think that means? Apparently that
    he's hunkering down for a defense. I think that was the wrong thing to do.
    
    Well, that changes the Nth prospects.
    
    What about the Italian disband of the Tun army, did you expect that? My
    guess is that he'll support the Turkish Ion-Tun, expecting it to leave in
    the Fall. But will he cover all his centers by Adr-Ven, giving up all
    attacking prospects against Trieste? Or did you convince him, so now he'll
    play the Wes fleet back to Tunis?
    
    Turkey's builds certainly signal expected cooperation with Italy, anyway,
    and yours were obvious.

    Italy removes A Tunis? I guess it was too much to hope F Wes would come
    down.
    
    You said earlier you want to be the balancer between France and Turkey.  I
    don't think that's achievable.  The reason is that Turkey and I are not
    equally engaged in the Med.  Turkey's all over you, I'm not.  I want you
    alive and well to hold the line while we grind our way to the inevitable
    draw.  Turkey wants you dead as long as he's the only one picking your
    bones.  I don't need to have his words on this, it's obvious from the
    disposition of forces.
    
    Say, is your aim to help him win?
