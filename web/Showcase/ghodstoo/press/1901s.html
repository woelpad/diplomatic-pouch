    Hohn had mentioned earlier that he might want to have a "pre-game"
    discussion about copying text in press messages.  For the moment,
    you may want to let me know if such a discussion would offend you.
    I'm not sure how long it will take for Edi Birsan to join and I
    would want him to hear the discussion.  Otherwise, are we missing only
    John Barkdull?  I think so.

    Hi guys, we're getting there slowly!  Yes, I hope Jamie will remember
    that this is my first go-round as master for a Judge game.  I don't
    believe that it will be any kind of conflict of interest for me to
    ask players for master syntax advice...  would the two of you that are
    Judge master experienced let me know if anything looks unusual or
    strange in the game parameters that I need to fix?  I was not sure
    how to add Monday as a potential deadline day (I don't have a problem
    with meeting Jamie's request to do so, but I didn't know how).  I set
    the game up mucho fast since I had to run to a meeting.  Sorry the
    message was so short (and deficient in not mentioning the Judge, observer
    signons etc.).
    
    Jim
    
    PS I got a strange message from the Judge granting that I was signed
    on as master, but also saying that I'm lacking a preference list.
    Is that a regular occurrence since I could start the game, and then
    switch it to unmoderated and play in it?

    Hi Hohn. Hi Jim.
    
    Jim, why don't you suggest that people signon as observers, too, at first.
    So we can use this channel to address each other en masse before the powers
    are assigned.

    Whoops, as I look at it again, you're precisely correct.  I probably
    shouldn't have forwarded it.  In any case, there was some discussion
    of this at the time.  I don't save everything and don't have any of
    the correspondence with you except where we were talking about people to
    invite into the game.

    I will leave it here, but the way I see it, Jamie and Mark are at
    a disadvantage communicating by the Judge/E-Mail, as some evidence
    has shown here at the beginning.
    
    The unusualness of the game is its particular charm.  The question
    is, what will happen as a result.  That, none of us knows.

    Dear M. Cyberdog,
    
    We are always ready to engage in any defensive manouever whatever. Our
    fleets are so practiced in defensive manouevers that they are constantly
    sailing around each other in circles.
    
    I think I will give Minister Churchill charge of the initial melee. Assuming
    our paranoia is well-founded (as paranoia always is, after all), the point
    of the dagger can be turned immediately toward the Huns.
    
    Do you think this is wise? Or would it be better to begin Mediterranean
    operations sooner?
    
    Cheers!

    This just appeared on the newsgroup rec.gmaes.diplomacy and Edi and
    Mark have been expressing worry about getting move syntax correct.
    I will be watching this and trying to spontaneously give syntax

    Good King Jamie:  France seeks only peaceful relations with England.  You
    are quite correct that the Central Powers cannot be trusted.  Their
    ambitions are a matter of historical record.  Shall we coordinate a
    defensive maneuver to ensure that they remain in check?

    I don't have my original solicitation letter.  I have this exchange
    with Conrad Minshall where I get into the subject of the possibility
    of phone calls in depth.  I'll try to find one of the letters that went
    to you.
    
    I consider this issue at this point as within the game (meaning it
    is up to you to deal with it as you wish), although I will consider
    some sort of specific appeal.  It is possible that Jamie entered
    this discussion at a point where it was not discussed in his hearing.
    
    Please feel free to keep inquiring.  I still haven't gone through all
    of the mail and I apologize if you've asked me a question that I haven't
    answered yet.  I will clean everything up this evening.

    Jim, et al.,
    
    I don't remember any discussion of telephone calls during the set-up of the
    game. Is there a record of that discussion anywhere? I'd like to see it.

    Faz,
    
    Try using lower case letters for power specifications, thus, instead of
    
    >>signon Rghodstoo xxxxxxxx
    >>press to E
    
    do
    	signon rghodstoo xxxxxxxx
    	press to e
    
    I'm not sure it makes a difference, but it's the only irregularity I see.
    
    
    
    >By the way, did you ever get any of these copies, either through the
    >Brown.edu address or via the Judge?
    
    No, through neither channel, it's the first I've seen of it.
    
    To content:
    first, no, I haven't sent out any other gloom-and-doom messages. I
    genuinely worry primarily about an FG alliance, as England, mostly because
    it's just such a strong alliance, so tempting. I will rely on sweettalk to
    try to break it up, but also on your good will. The FG will tempt them less
    if they expect to have to face a healthy Russia who would fight against
    such a consolidation of the Northwest, and make any clean-up of England
    slow and painful.
    
    As to 'directional foci' (sheesh!).
    I am ambivalent. As long as I feel I have things moderately well in hand in
    my neighborhood, I'd prefer to see you go south, and make your
    re-appearance in the north at an opportune moment. That is, if I'm on the
    Two side of a Two-on-one amongs us northwesterners, I'd be happiest to see
    your A Mos-Ukr, or the like.
    
    If, on the other hand, I feel about to be the victim in the north, I would
    prefer to see your strong presence up here.
    
    So perhaps we could leave things open for now. As I am plotting things,
    your interests ought to coincide roughly with mine, so that it would be
    mostly a matter of seeing how things are falling and which of the major
    options is in *OUR* interest.
    
    As to Norway, I will not expect you to contest it, and I though obviously I
    am going to take it, I am willing to do it in the Unthreatening Way (viz.,
    with a fleet), especially if we can build that into part of a larger,
    mutually agreeable plan. (Ideally I'd like my army in Belgium, but the real
    world so rarely approximates my ideals, the wretched thing!)
    
    Does it bother you, by the way, that Herr Edi signed on as Turkey? I'm
    dying to discover what was up with that!
    
    If you're happy with my remarks above, say so, and then let's feel out the
    others for a while.
    
    Cheers!

    			SECURITY COMPROMISED!!!!
    
    How is it that both edi@mgames.com and hohncho@kaiwan.com have just sent
    broadcasts as Turkey???? Geez, the game is hard enough with just one player
    handling Turkey's units.
    
    (Fortunately Hohn is an old Judge hand and knows how to take care of
    trivial little things like this.)
    
    Cheers!
    Gentle King Jamie
    
    p.s. I also resigned as *observer*. As Hohn says, everyone should do this
    or you'll get two copies of each broadcast and Judge bookkeeping
    announcement.
    Do it like this:
    	signon oghodstoo password
    	resign
    The Judge keeps track of observers by their address, so as long as you send
    the resign message from the address you used to signon as an observer
    originally, you will successfully remove yourself as an observer.

    No, I'm still here...I only resigned as an Observer, since I was tired
    of getting double mail.  We can all do that, since once our powers
    were assigned, we can all issue press.
    
    BTW, Ye Olde Sultan extends his hand to all European leaders in
    friendship.  I'm looking forward to a great game, and I'm sure I'll be
    corresponding with you privately very soon.  I am swamped today,
    though, so I may not be able to send/respond messages until the

    Well well well.
    
    I wouldn't mind splitting the board, east and west, with someone suitably
    placed who likes board-splitting. Hypothetically speaking, I mean.
    
    I can't remember what my preference list was, but I know I didn't have
    England first. With good players, I am always afraid that the FG alliance
    looks too tempting. So I'll be sweating that for a while and not attending
    to much else, I think. But my first order of business as England *must* be
    to come to good terms with Russia, I firmly believe that, and if Russia
    happens to be played by someone I've already had a preliminary chat with,
    so much the better!

    As I suspected, Edi is having a little trouble with the registration.
    I've tried to help him and I'm trying to get him to send me what the
    judge is sending him back... we'll see.
    
    If Dave has access to the mail stream of the Judge and can easily
    find Edi's failure, perhaps he could see precisely what Edi is doing
    wrong.  I will remind Dave Kleiman at this point, that his "Judge-keeper"
    job on this game could become more involved than usual.
    
    Edi, as an expert Dip player, is being a bit shy about asking me as
    many questions as he should be.  Our other total Judge rookie (Mark
    Fassio) has been at the other extreme and he's asked me lots of great
    questions.

    Hello, Edi should be joining us shortly.  On Sundays (I think I have this
    right) he does consulting for the mgames postal role playing company
    where people call him for advice on how to form and run factions, gain
    influence and the like in that particular set of PBM games.  Anyway,
    he has to keep his phone line free until that is done.  I have not heard from
    John Barkdull, but he may be a 9-5 weekday user, so with the holiday
    he might not sign on until Tuesday.  We'll see.
    
    Based on Jamie's advice and some thinking of my own, I have "mucked"
    around with the deadline parameters.  I now have the movement at
    seven full days (minus Jamie's suggested half hour), winter builds and
    adjustments at two days and retreats at one day (otherwise when you
    have both retreats and builds things can get pretty slow).  If anyone
    wants me to move a deadline parameter in any direction, please let
    me know.  For you new guys, you may want to "get deadline" for a
    description of how to read these deadlines and you can do "list"
    after a signon to see the whole set of parameters.  I also added
    "Monday after noon" as a possible deadline as Jamie suggested.
    
    We'll start soon...

    Hi all,
    
    My query regarding copying/forwarding messages really wasn't intended
    to be a big deal.  It was prompted by some RGD discussion that Jim was
    involved in.  Basically, from what I could tell, Jim's position was
    similar to mine in that we both despise the tactic.  I was thinking
    that if we had a unanimously strong consensus against it, we could
    institute a house rule.
    
    But it's really no big deal.  If even one person wants to have that
    option, I have no objections to declining the implementation of any
    such rule.
    
    Essentially, my main objection comes from FTF play, in that we don't
    have players walking around with tape recorders and fake dubbing
    machines to try to get/doctor incriminating evidence against other
    players.  To me, it kinda takes away from an element of the game in
    one sense (in that the credible, substantive "proof" that can be
    possible with copied messages (and even more so in the case of
    Xeroxing letters in PBM play, I imagine) removes a level of judgment
    that may otherwise be necessary in predicting stabs and independently
    evaluating credibility), and makes things needlessly complicated in
    another sense (taking the time to doctor up fake messages, or decipher
    them, etc...if I'd wanted to break or set up a code system or do
    detective work, I'd play Clue).
    
    My $0.02.

    A few items:
    
    If you want to have a pre-game discussion, you can send press as a
    non-assigned power by using a long signon command.  I'd suggest you join
    the game as an observer to do this discussion.  Once the game starts, you
    can resign the observer position.  You will get two copies of all game
    messages until you resign as the observer.  I often signon to broadcast my
    message as an observer and then resign in the same message:
    
    signon oghodstoo password
    broadcast
    This is my message......
    dave@kleiman.indianapolis.in.us has resigned dave@kleiman.indianapolis.in.us

    Hi all,
    
    Whoops, sorry about the password mixup.  I've changed mine so that
    these sorts of things hopefully won't happen again.
    
    Regarding phone dip, I'm ambivalent.  I probably won't be making too
    many calls, but in just in case, here's my info:
    
    Hohn Cho
    (213) 955-4689 (WK)
    (310) 320-0331 (HM)
    
    I'm on Pacific time, and you can call me at work literally at any
    time, but at home I'd prefer 10 AM - 10 PM.
    
    Regarding actual negotiations, I apologize, I'm still swamped at work.
    I'll try to get down to business soon.
    
    Jim, since it's the first turn, and in keeping with the FTF tradition
    of having more time to negotiate on the first turn, do you think it
    would be possible to extend the deadline until, say, Monday?  If no
    one else has any objections, that is.

    Hello Edi!
    After years of play, it's a great honor to finally be in a game with
    you...I hope life's treating you well, and that this e-mail crap is
    treating you better than it is me!  I have yet to correctly format a
    message (according to the Judge) and have it get to its recipient.
    I tried to send the same note 15 times to England; no luck.
    Give me a stamp and an envelope any old day...
    
    
    Anyway, IF this should reach you via the Judge, I'm hoping that you
    could see fit to agree to the usual DMZs and peace arrangements
    between our two noble powers.  I have no desire to challenge either
    you and Turkey in a shooting war, and am trying to sound out my
    neighbors as to their 'druthers and whatnot.
    
    If you've got any ideas, suggestions, proposals, etc, I'd love to hear
    them.  I'm hoping for mutual growth for us, and that means a great
    jump-off out of the gate...hence my desire for peace and cooperation.
    What say you?

    This is actually the first time I've played in a game with ANY of the
    people here, although Edi and I have have played a few games of ftf
    "Escalation" (a real cool variant for 2 or 3 people where you put units
    anywhere on the board, one at a time, until you have 8 or so units.
    Play then carries on as normal sans negotiations.  Good tactical
    workout.)

    I must say that I heartily second the concept of Italian growth...
    
    Edi has already sent me an interesting proposal which you may have
    already seen.  He wants the three of us to attack F/E/T right away with
    the assumption that G will join in on the attack on F when he sees
    what's going on.  I see a few drawbacks to this, but it's an interesting
    concept.  Would you be interested?  I know from Edi's standpoint, it
    keeps you and I away from him and takes out Turkey quickly, but at the
    same time it can lead to real gains quickly.  I'd probably have the most
    risk as my back would be turned to Edi once Turkey fell, but I think I
    can avoid the stab with a few well placed units of my own (he said
    hopefully...).
    
    Of course, there's always the chance that you and I could do the old
    pincer-thing on Edi if he gets in TOO good a position...
    
    Whaddya say?

    Don't worry about the phone stuff being an 'advantage'  I have never played a
    regular Diplomacy game by e-mail so consider yourself at an advantage there.
    
    I still have to figure out how to send in a set of orders.
    
    Anyway some quick comments:
    1. Do you know any of these guys...?
    
    2.  As this is a demonstration game, I think we should try to demonstrate some
    thing so how about something a little different.  What would it take for us to
    work out some unusal stuff like an E-I-A-R opening alliance against F-G-T what
    I am thinking about is something along the lines of you and Italy going
    straight after France with me poping into Tyrolia and then Munich while Russia
    does a move to the Black Sea.  Italy should open up to the west as with some
    minimal support we can handle holding him down and pushing him back for the
    western campaign to sort itself out.
    
    Can you push the Italians and the Russians along these lines?
    
    What's your phone number...I have free calls on Friday as part of a local
    promotion for world wide calls through March and USA for the next two years
    and I would like to use them.

    Not really. I know Pitt a little bit, the others not at all.
    
    >2.  As this is a demonstration game, I think we should try to demonstrate some

    Suits me ok.
    The thing I sweat about most when I'm playing England is, of course, a
    Franco-German alliance. If I can set up something that will ensure that
    Russia is on my side, I count that a big plus. And having Italy and Austria
    swarming around Switzerland gives me a good warm feeling, too.
    
    One problem, it seems to me, is how you're going to dig Turkey out of there
    with Italy going west. Not easy. I suppose if you get your fleet to Aeg in
    S02, that could be enough.
    
    If you want to call me on Friday, here's my daytime number:

    Hi, Faz.  I don't have any plans to attack Munich right off, so our
    relationship will be largely info-sharing at the outset, unless you want to
    turn that thought into a proposal.  Of course, the other option is for you
    to bounce England out of Norway while I give him hell from below.
    Otherwise, we can play the usual cautious openings and see what develops.
    I generally play Russia strong to the south, so I'll certainly understand
    if you don't want to do anything overly bold in the north.

    Regardless, I wanted to drop you a short line and let you know that I'm
    very interested in open and constant communication with everyone.
    And, just like Animal Farm, "some communications are more equal
    than others,"  meaning I want to stay abreast on adjacent threats, and
    will assume the same for you.  This calls for good F/R relations.  I'm
    all for it, and hope you are, too.
    
    Take care, John, and good hunting this game!  Drop a line when you get

    Hello Pitt!
    I'm still shaky at addressing these things, so please note the
    inclusion of the Master (Jim) as an addressee here--not sure if
    the Judge automatically routes him copies of all partial press, or
    if we're supposed to do it manually.  As he wants all press thru the
    Judge for a record of the game, I figured I'd err on the side of caution.
    After all, he is sworn to neutral impartiality.
    
    OK, admin stuff aside, what do we have?  The first item is the by-now
    familiar Russian question on Russo-German relations--specifically in the
    border areas of Sil/Pru and Bal/Swe.  I'll admit to all the things most normal Russians will admit to (especially as it's all true)!
    1) I desire R/G peace and--at the very least--some early DMZs in
    areas we might run afoul of each other;
    2) Russia would really like Sweden to add to its peripheral empire,
    with the proviso that I won't sail into German waters (Bal).
    
    Quite naturally, I see any R/G fight as benefiting only Eng or Aus/Tur...
    and why give our neighbors a leg up on us?
    
    I'm amenable to just about any ideas or suggestions you propose, Pitt,
    as long as there's mutual gain in them, and security interests are
    addressed.  1901 won't be too bad, but I'm thinking more of the early game
    years, and how we can help each other out.
    
    I eagerly await any comments or ideas, and wish you 'good hunting' this
    game.  Take care.

    OK, admin stuff aside, what do we have?  The first item is the by-now
    familiar Russian question on the R/T Balkan split, and the status of
    our units in the opening season(s) --  especially as regards Black Sea
    and Armenia. I would be a liar to say I weasn't concerned about two pros
    like you and Edi ganging up on me and blocking normal Russian expansion
    into the area.   I'm inquiring to see if there's any way we can mutually benefit
    from the Balkans, without the attendant fighting that goes with it.
    
    There are a variety of options:  The old "Russia passes its fleet thru Con
    in S'02"  routine, if we REALLY decided to team up.   Given the natural level
    of distrust in the opening season(s), I would love to merely agree to "the
    basics:"  Neither of us in Arm, and some sort of Black Sea agreement?
    I had envisioned something like:  Mos-Ukr, Sev-Bla (or Sev-h), with you
    doing either:
    Ank-Bla (to give the impression of a fight between us) or Ank-Con;
    Con-Buk
    Smy-?  to Con if Ank-Bla, or Smy-holds
    
    In fall, my fleet goes to Rum, thus negating any Bla Sea threat, and yours
    goes into Aeg (or Con, as the case may be).  I build NO fleets in Sev, and
    you build none in Ank, and we then find ways to mutually "do a number"
    vis a vis SER and whatnot.  The lion's share of any Balkan things would be
    yours in such an arrangement.
    
    Anyway, Hohn, I don't expect enthusiastic approval of these variant(s),
    as you need time to hear from the others and to formulate your own plan.
    But I wanted to at least "get out of the starting gate" and let you know I
    MUCH prefer positive R/T arrangements, than to fight ad nauseam over Bla
    and the Balkans...especially as we don't know what's brewing between
    Austria, Italy, and/or Germany.
    
    Hope your work schedule slows down (mine isn't unfortunately), and that
    I hear from you soon.  I wish you 'good hunting" this game, Hohn.
    
    Your Neighbor,
    Tsar Faz

    Hi again John!
    Thanks for your quick reply; hope this finds you well.  I'm off to see
    my son's school play, so I'll keep this one short.
    
    The East is abuzz with rumors of coalitions and counter-coalitions;
    there
    is much fear (for whatever reason) of an E/F duo (or perhaps certain
    folks out here
    are making the stuff up just to divert attention from themselves).   I'm
    not paying much
    attention to it all, because I expect it's designed to divert me from
    the Balkans and to
    allow "others" to profit at my expense.  Still, be advised that the West
    is the object of
    some attention from my neighbors.
    
    As for options.  If you had nothing better to do, I'd entertain an
    anti-German drive.  You
    had asked if I'd offer specifics...well, short of invading SIL and
    Bur-Mun (in fall), I don't
    have any other specifics.  I'm mean, I have nothing against the Hun,
    really, and
    are really just 'trolling for offers' right now.  But if everyone offers
    the conservative,
    "hands-off" approach for S'01, then I'll have to do the same.  I was
    just seeing how involved you are, and what ideas you might float--or
    have floated to you.
    
    I'll probably just open to the south and be a traditionalist, although
    even there, my offers of teaming (primarily to I and T) have been met
    with distance...guess I'm too over-eager
    for the locals, yuk yuk.
    
    Anyway, John, if nothing else, let's shoot for info-sharing and the
    'option'
    of putting our  joint forces into operation (be they anti-E or anti-G),
    as the situation
    arises; ok?
    
    Best to you this game.

    Hi again Cal!
    Well, good to see Edi is singing the same tune to us all--maybe the
    Siren Song is
    designed to sensitize the masses and ensure greater Austrian security.
    
    Actually, I don't have a problem with his plan, at least for the initial
    stages.  I mean,
    given the choice between a working A/I/R (with possible G involvement),
    or a possible
    anti-R combination of A/T, well...the choice is obvious!
    
    I don't think you'd have much of a threat from Edi once this got
    rolling.  After all,
    the three of us will serve as "checks and balances" on the other two,
    and if he
    gets uppity toward you (or me), I would hope that we could cover each
    other's
    backs and stop the danger.
    
    Quite honestly, I'd prefer the ol' straight-out attacks on Gal and Tri,
    and take our
    chances with fighting Austria.  The big downer with that plan is that it
    allows the
    Turk a greater gain out of the starting gate, and that's a threat to us
    both in the
    mid-game.  So, fighting the urge to just attack right away, I'd say that
    yes, I would
    be interested in an A/I/R cabal.
    
    The question mark then, of course, is who does what to whom?  Does this
    imply
    you're attacking immediately westward, gaining just Tun in '01?   Where
    do
    I go -- Nwy?  What does this imply for Russian presence in the Balkans
    (especially if Turkey opens to Arm and/or Bla)?  And Austria:  who
    exactly is
    he attacking in this grand scheme, save 'eastern' power Turkey?  And of
    course,
    we need to figure out Germany's ultimate role here--fellow vulture, or
    Defender of
    the West?
    
    Only my hairdresser knows the answers to all these questions, but I'd
    kind of
    like a little more gouge from Edi before I completely endorse this plan.
    
    Let me know your 'druthers, Cal:  anti-A, anti-T, or anti-West, it's all
    the same to me.
    
    Best

    My Dear Liege
    Indeed, you may *truthfully* say, if asked by F/G, that you and Russia
    have promised Nothing to each other.  I will also play the part, and if
    asked if I have designs on the north, will reply, "Of course."  (Sweden,
    that is).
    
    I think E/I/R are naturals for dealing, as we're geographically
    separate, yet potentially mutually supporting--with plenty of juicy
    enemies in between to "split the pie."
    
    We are in agreement on the issues as specified in your last.

    To Our Cousin Tsar,
    
    Then we continue to see eye-to-eye.
    
    Thanks for the info about Italy's willingness; I shall certainly now follow
    up and press him on the matter. In fact, shortly before your last note, I
    did mention to him that I'd heard the Gran Plan d'Birsan, wanted his views
    of it, and also that I would independently like to pursue at least some
    quiet, background cooperation among you and him and me (on the general
    grounds that the fate of Russia, Italy, and England so often rise or fall
    together). So we shall see.
    
    I think we are both inclined, you and I, to leave it at this then:
    
    we are favorably disposed toward le Gran Plan d'Birsan (albeit highly
    suspicious of his motives), and are tentatively and provisionally going
    along, subject to any especially interesting or alarming developments as
    Herr Pitt or M. Jean-Bark become more talkative.
    
    I add:
    while I fully intend to take Norway with a fleet, I will not yet promise to
    do so, entirely on the grounds that I would like to be able to say that I
    have promised you nothing just in case France or Germany inquire. (That is,
    I would like to be able to say it *truly*!)
    Acceptable?
    
    Cheers!

    Good and Gentle King Jamie
    Once again, munificent well-wishes from your ol' cuz, the Tsar.  Thanks
    for the reply, and let me answer just a couple quick points from your
    letter.
    
    1) Your view of the E/F is identical with my view, i.e., pap, designed
    to fool people.
    You'd be crazy if you didn't write everyone and offer them help vs
    everyone else.  Heck, I've offered up Austria's head (and yours!)
    numerous times, to get a rise from people.  Pretty dismal responses to
    date, though...
    2) On that related note, I agree with your assessment of the writing to
    date.  Maybe it's because I'm having a 'managaeable' week and the others
    aren't, but I've had only sporadic replies from Italy and Germany, zippo
    from Turkey, and the most from you and Edi.  France has written back to
    my queries twice, but both times they've been vanilla with no flavoring,
    if you catch my drift...he waits to see what I throw out for bait and
    then half-heartedly commits a reply with nothing attached to it.  Ditto
    for G and I.
    3) The coalition-plan was indeed Edi's.  I didn't want to spill Edi's
    beans if he hadn't asked you first (it is, after all, his plan).  I told
    him if you were up for it, then I'd strongly consider going along, too.
    Naturally, Edi has his reasons (not all of them benevolent, I'm sure),
    but his opening moves schemes look reasonable, and anything that keeps A
    & T from linking up is ok by me!  The hit on Germany in 1902 may be a
    tad rushed, given that France might not be humbled (nor Germany be out
    of position!), but I think 4 on 1 (or 4 on 2) can easily get the desired
    results.
    4)  Italy is apparently also 'up' for this attack, altho' I sense his
    progress as slow, unless he pulls a "Mussolini" on France while John
    faces vs you.
    5) Bottom line:  I'm for such a coalition, if you are.  I won't pester
    an Eng F in Nwy, and might ask it for help if we start in vs Den and
    whatnot....anyway, consider it.
    
    Take care, Jamie.  Thanks for writing.

    No word from you despite our direst warning re: knids.
    
    Would you mind having a few words to plan openings? I am inclined to play

    Dear Sgnr. White,
    
    May we humbly apologize if earlier telegram appeared too telegraphic.
    
    We should like to open serious negotiations with your government.
    
    In particular, a plan of attack outlined by Archduke Birsan has reached our
    desk, and our interest therein is highly contingent on your own
    disposition.
    
    If possible, we would like to reach a rapprochement in some way, either
    quite limited or aggressively cooperative, among yourselves, ourselves, and
    the Russian selves, since in our experience the fortunes of Italy, England,
    and Russia often rise and fall together.

    It is smokescreen.
    I of course did write to France--I wrote to everyone (isn't that what one
    'does'?). And he did reply, but his reply was cursory, and he hasn't
    followed up. The gist: I said I would like to begin 'purely defensive'
    manouevers with him, and he agreed that we should set up something purely
    defensive. No specifics. Really just 'friendly noise', as far as I'm
    concerned.
    
    >I am also hearing muted rumblings of possible coalition warfare; you may

    Yes.
    I think I know what you mean, Edi's grand plan. It sounds ok to me,
    actually; not too far off what I would like to do anyway, not apt to commit
    me to do anything I wouldn't have been considering in any case. And, as Edi
    put it, this is a demo game, it would be fun to demonstrate something
    interesting or unusual.
    
    If that's not what you meant -- or even if it is -- please, let me hear
    your scoop.
    
    >Anyway, if you hear such rumors yourself, please let me know, ok?  I can
    >confirm multiple rumors, but if they're only coming my way, it could be

    The Great Powers have been strangely quiet, to my ear. Only Edi and you
    have been at all forthcoming. The others have given me a word or two at
    most. I am expecting that this will change. Hoping! As I said earlier, my
    only real worry is the dreaded F/G alliance. Should I hear no more serious
    communication from France or Germany, my fears will grow. In that case, I
    would have to regard Edi's suggestion as my only option. I think I'll try
    to have a real discussion with Italy, anyway.

    Just a short note; much abuzz in the East as of late.  The talk is of a

    APL201 Survival of the Witless:  Antisocial Darwinism in the Academic
    World
    (by Avalanche Press, Ltd, VA Beach, VA)
    
    Survival of the Witless is a fast-playing card game for 3-8 players,
    ages 10 and up, in which players attempt to gain the ultimate prize:
    tenure.  Players take the role of entry-level professors and attack one
    another with gossip, innuendo, color-neutral mail, and seduction while
    attempting to avoid such pitfalls as teaching awards, eye rape, student
    support, ideological impurity, committee assignments, plagiarism charges
    and the Race Card.
    
    With enough status and a completed book (it doesn't have to be any good,
    just published), a player can try for a tenure vote.  What can bring you
    status?  Window office, trophy wife, bold new theories and research
    grants, to list just a few.  Tenure committee members may grow upset if
    you park in their space, kill their pet or (Grant) burn the office
    coffeemaker.  But don't worry about the Lousy Teaching card -- it has no
    effect.  Each tenure committee member is a unique individual, who may
    pay more attention to your race, class and gender than to your ability
    or lack thereof.  Succeed and you'll never have to work again.

    Thanks for the details on both the game and your former education (I
    should be so lucky now to find a $100 PhD kind of arrangement, if I ever
    get off my carcass to get enthused about more self-inflicted brutality).
    >

    Your moves are nicely detailed and provide something for the greedy slob
    in all of us.  If England buys off, then I'll sign up, too.  Have you
    submitted this to him as a plan, or is he clueless over your ideas?  I'm
    not worried that much about Jamie's 1901 moves or anything, but once the
    Tsar's ponderous war machine lurches along (just like WW1), I will have
    difficulty shifting fronts....a smooth 1901 makes life so much simpler.
    
    Good to hear Italy is 'up' for it.   Should be interesting to see how
    far he advances against France in the early stages.  Possibly far,
    should England occupy John's attention up north.
    
    As far as Pitt goes, is 1901 enough to "show" him the vulture attacks on
    France AND get him to commit to us?  I only ask because we then dump on
    him in 1902, and I'm not sure how/where his guys would be in such a
    situation.  (Of course, OUR units are what counts,  but I'd like to see
    him leaning Westward as the noose gets slipped around the neck.)
    
    Bottom line:  looks good, Edi.  Let me know what England says before I
    go final.  (I won't offer this up to Jamie, as I'm unsure what you're
    already said/don't want said.)

     I doubt that you'll screw anything up due to syntax or Judge-type
    quirks.  If I, "Roadkill on the Information Superhighway," can master
    this beast, you can too.  But it's screwy, I'll say that.  One thing
    that's interesting is how the Judge sends me back every one of my
    messages with an "orders not submitted for Russia yet" message at the
    bottom.  I suppose it's the way you're reminded to submit orders, but I
    somehow wonder if anyone else reads my orders when this thing goes out.

    Well, yes, I intend to stay out of Gal, but was kind of hoping you'd
    say, "So am I."  Your reply kind of leaves open that you might go
    there--or am I implying too much?

    A 'friendly' bounce will doubtless be seen by Hohn as most 'unfriendly.'
     If I do bounce, what's your stance on RUM?  Without sounding like an
    imperialist writ large, Russian foreign policy is based on the
    assumption that RUM is in its 'sphere.'  Is that how you see it, also?
    (Ser, Gre, Bul, are all non-issues to me unless they heavily tip the
    balance in anyone's favor.)
    Anyway, I'm not at all averse to bouncing Hohn.  I've written him with
    the usual schemes and dreams (as I've done to everyone this game), but
    no reply.  I appreciate the info on playing style contrasts between him
    and Germany, by the way; nice to know!   I tend to be a two-player
    alliance type, at least for the bulk of the game, but given this is a
    Demo Game with some "high rollers," I can modify my stodgy behavior.
    (The Dip World Demo game is another example of the squirrely alliances
    and power shifts we're all doing, for the same reason:  to provide
    "bread and circuses" for the neophytes and the old heads, showing them
    what's in a good Dip game.   I agree that we should be "open" in this
    game, too.)
    
    As for bouncing Turkey:  if that's a good option, I'll do it...I
    generally do anyway, for security.   But I also want to hear from Hohn
    first...what the heck.

    Forget France.  I've heard from him twice.  He asked if I had any
    'concrete' anti-German plans (other than War-Sil, Bur-Mun--which sound
    pretty 'concrete' to me?!)   He's playing it close to the vest, and not
    letting me know his true leanings, other than "info-sharing vs E and G."

    Now this might be a player!  I think the bulk of folks would be
    agreeable to this; I certainly am.  Italy has also sounded me out about
    this offer, and asked my opinion.  I think England would also be
    agreeable.  My concern deals with expansion routes, and (naturally)
    spoils:
    1) What's Italy's opening:  to Pie, and +1 from Tunis?   How about me?
    The bounce in Bla with ??  a southern strategy, or movement to the north
    to boot?  How about you?  Where exactly would you be going in such a
    plan, given that all the Western targets are separated by I, R or G?  Or
    are you and I to reduce Turkey while I and E (and vulture G?) join the
    anti-French pummeling?
    2) What benefits come to everyone in this one--especially if Germany
    joins us?  Right now it sounds like you and I should do ok (as we're
    after the bulk of Turkey and the Balkans), but I see little gain for I
    and E, unless they gut it out and slog through it for awhile.  (Which
    isn't all that bad, don't get me wrong!)
    
    Bottom line:  I'm interested.

    Your memory serves you in good stead.  The Hotel Thayer remains (due to
    receive a multimillion $$ facelift soon), and the Historian you stayed
    with sounds like Col Trevor Dupuy, "the" icon of modern Army
    historians...I think he committed a quick suicide recently after finding
    out he faced a slower death due to cancer.   Ah, S'grad, Afrika Korps
    and Blitzkrieg--they remain on my shelves, waiting for the next
    generation of board gamers!
    
    The West Point mystique is a long and storied one, and I can image the
    'clash of cultures' you encountered in the Vietnam heyday years.  It's a
    little more sedate now.  For me, it's a learning experience in itself.
    Yes, I am an instructor (you do become an associate professor, but only
    after 2+ years of teaching).  I teach International Relations ("Why do
    states do what they do?"), using various interstate theories of realism,
    pol-econ, and nation-state activities.  I don't have an IR degree, but
    my Masters is close enough, so they took me.  I'm Air Force, here as one
    of 14 liaison officers, so it's a real "culture shock."   But I'd like
    to teach upon retirement (getting there soon) and this is a nice
    addition to the resume.  Plus it's fun, once the admin mumbo-jumbo is
    done.....
    
    Anyway, hope this helps, and is informative.  I await the next Austrian
    letter, and "good hunting" to you this game, Edi.

    The mist rolled in over the Bridge of the Pontifex as the Coronal stared
    out over the river.  The swirling fog seemed only slightly thicker than
    the veil of depression which the messenger's disturbing news had brought
    upon him.  "After all these centuries," thought Hissune, "Why should the
    BirSauron choose this moment in history to re-appear?"  He stared out at
    the river once again and watched as a seabird swooped down and plucked
    a  fish out of the dark water.  "Could that be an omen?" wondered
    Hissune.  "Are we all to become prey for that foulest of birds?"

    Cal,
    I'm 100% with you and your letter's contents!  I fear everyone this game
    (I'm not in the same class as the ghods of the ghame), yet I fear you
    (and France) the least, because of geography (and that you're swell
    fellows, no doubt!  -grin-)  Having said that, I think I'd also like to
    try Edi's plan, at least to see where it takes us.
    
    I was serious when I said I like to see Italian grwoth.  Only in the
    rarest of circumstances would we ever fight, and there are a lot of
    advantages (like, keeping Aus in check) that come from our cooperation!
    Edi's plan is bold, and has the right chemistry for an early takedown of
    a couple powers (neither of them ours!).  To paraphrase Churchill's 1940
    speech in regards to A and T:  "If the Devil (Edi) were against Mr
    Hitler (Hohn), I'd give him a fair mention in the House of Commons."  I
    trust no one, and would readily agree that, once Hohn is on the ropes,
    you and I do an immediate turn-around and start pummeling Edi.  If not,
    he may get E/A against me (or you) and gut us at his whim...I don't want
    that to happen, and neither do you.
    
    OK, then, the die seems cast.  Eng also seems "up" for it.  Hopefully
    this isn't some A/T grand cabal to sucker us all!  I stand ready to help
    (and cover) you as we begin this ploy, and I hope you do the same for
    me.

    Heh heh, at least you got in on the strength of your reputation as a
    player.  *I* got in because I'm passingly competant at running a
    Dipzine!  A couple of Cancon titles aside, most of my experience in this
    hobby is as a publisher, not as a player.  Ah well, I'll probably settle
    for the same goals as yourself ie a lack of public embarassment.  Given
    all the bloody people signing on as "observers" in this game, that may
    come as a challenge!

    I agree that keeping communication open is very important.  We may not
    be able to work together in the near future, but if we can both survive
    long enough, we'll undoubtedly have reason for more substantial chat in
    the future.
    
    As for current insights, well, it's hard to know what credence to give
    ANYTHING in the S'01 negotiations...  Austria is trying hard to get me
    to attack France and Russia seems scared of both Austria and Turkey.
    Turkey hasn't written, but he did say he would be out of town for the
    weekend.  I'm not reading anything into his silence (yet).  Other than
    that, you probably know as much about the opening moves as I do (ie your
    own).  Anything from the west sound interesting?

    I'm on Eastern time as well (Toronto) but I usually go to bed fairly

    Sounds good to me.  England and Italy are natural counterpoints whose
    fortunes, as you point out below, are usually tied together.

    Well, assuming that Edi's plan to you is the same as the one he sent to
    me, that would call for you and I to attack France.  Normally, I
    wouldn't be predisposed to do this, but I think I might make an
    exception in this case.  It will certainly liven the game up a bit.  I
    figure we should give all these observers something to watch, eh? :)

    Agreed.  Russia is Italy's other main counterpoint. Anyway, if you are
    interested in a definite working agreement to attack France, I'm willing
    to do the same.  Moves to the Channel and Piedmont are the obvious
    openers.  We can see what happens after that.

    The way I see the plan is like this:
    
    Positives
    
    It puts Turkey down right from the get-go.  Hohn is a great player and
    playing Italy to his Turkey isn't my cup of tea.  His early demise would
    make me breathe MUCH easier.
    
    It creates confusion in the west.  All the better as I hate games that
    come down to East/West stalemates.  With any luck, I can get a fleet
    into the Mid during the confusion and make it more likely that the game
    will have at worst a small draw.
    
    It keeps Edi positioned right between you and I where we can watch him.
    
    Drawbacks
    
    It keeps Edi positioned right between you and I where we can watch him
    stab either of us in the back... My biggest fear about the three of us
    attacking Turkey is that, once Turkey is out, you're involved with
    England, I'm involved with France and Edi get to pick which exposed back
    he wants to attack...  That's not an attractive proposition given Edi's
    propensity for viciousness (well-deserved, I might add... <g>).
    However, if you and I stay aware of this, we should be able to keep
    enough leverage to make him stay honest.
    
    Keeping him honest will be tricky.  In fact, it MAY not be possible.  If
    it looks as if we're not being successful at it, we might want to pull
    back a bit and try the old pincer attack.  Actually, if there is
    sufficient confusion in the west, we might keep this in the back of our
    minds as the best long term option anyway.
    
    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    
    To sum up, I'd like to give Edi's plan a shot, but I want to keep in
    mind that it will probably be better to take him out right after Turkey
    is gone (or nearly so).  Whatever happens, I'd like for you and I to
    keep working together.  I wouldn't trust Edi or Hohn as far as I could
    throw them (less actually, Hohn's kinda small... <g>), but there is no
    reason for you and I to conflict, given the countries we're playing.

    My dear Kaiser
    Thanks for the letter and info therein!  As for you laying it on rather
    thickly, well...You do state your non-desire to be compared on the same
    plane as these other barracudas, yet only one player this game doesn't
    rate himself "expert" on the scale (Mr Moral High Ground, at your
    service, ha ha!).  And Austria certainly has some info to tell, so I
    imagine he's one of the ones you have "knowledge of!"  ((-grin-))
    Nonetheless, take the above as good-natured ribbing (it is)!    I
    realize this "preparatory fire" is the nature of the beast for us
    experienced Dippers--and completely expected.  Hope this finds you well,
    Pitt!
    
    What can be said of Russo-German relations?  Well, like you, I'd love to
    discuss long-term arrangements.  What German wouldn't love to hear
    there's DMZs all along our mutual borders?  What Russian wouldn't thrill
    to be given SWE without a fight in '01 (hint hint)?!  If there is an
    area where you and I can team up together, Pitt, count me in.  R/Gs have
    a natural gel to them, as there are peripheral foes (to keep us from
    casting covetous eyes toward each other) and there are neighborly foes
    that we can both team up on for quick gain.  Russia is always willing to
    discuss these types of issues with her great German neighbor!
    
    Having said that, I imagine that 1901 will see the usual conservatism.
    Like you, I don't feel worthy to be among the "ghods of the ghame."  And
    that translates into wanting to stay alive a little while, so dozens of
    e-mail observers won't remember my only PBEM game as a farce and a
    comedy of errors.  As such, I'd love to launch into something bold and
    beautiful, but I think it may occur in 1902, so I can at least try for
    centers....I imagine you're thinking along the same lines?
    
    Speaking of...ahem...centers, where do we stand?  Are you going to
    contest SWE, or may I have "rightful" Russian territory?  Can we cement
    DMZs in SIL, PRU and BAL?   If so, those two points will help channel us
    toward "mutual plans" and keep the peace between us with minimal
    apprehension.
    
    I stand ready and able to help/deal with the Germans at a moment's
    notice.  I need all the help I can get this game, and Germany is the
    last foe I want to even consider tangling with!  I hope you feel the
    same in every regard, and that we can, indeed, "do business" in the near
    future.  I welcome any and all ideas, suggestions, or comments.  My
    phone is (914) 446-1308, as I stated in a broadcast note earlier...best
    between 5-7 p.m., or after 9, and weekends.
    
    Yours for Peace,

    Cal,
    No, I'm not home from work (unfortunately).  I'm actually trying to get
    a bunch of classroom admin work done, but every time the server "dings"
    to tell me there's a message, I drop everything and become a slave to
    non-work stuff.  Sooner or later it'll catch up to me.  I tried to
    connect another e-mail net to my home server, but it ate my military
    connection (I also have this remoted to my home terminal), and I lost
    some Windows-based crap that took  me two weeks to fix.  So now I just
    play from work (or via the remote).  Some days I'll write reams to you
    from work, other days I won't get anything out....this is an
    'in-between' day.
    
    "Full support" between us is exactly what I'm looking for.  Italy's
    tough enough to play (even by a top-notch player like yourself), so
    anything I can do to help you --AND VICE VERSA -- is strongly
    encouraged.

    Hi John!  Sorry it's taken so long to write, but bad weather and a trip
    to Montreal in a snow storm have kept my life busy (and interesting) for
    the last few days.  I'm actually home today because my truck is frozen
    up and won't start.  Fine with me, I need the mental health day!
    
    Anyway, I don't believe we've ever met either in person or over a
    PBM/PBEM board before.  Hopefully, that will be a good thing as I'm
    familiar with (and have a few preconceptions about) several other
    players.  I've either gamed with or met Edi (Austria), Mark (Russia) and
    Hohn (Turkey).  I know that Edi and Hohn are two of the most feared
    players in the Diplomacy PBM hobby.  Hohn has won two or three DipCons
    and Edi has been around forever.  I think he's won DipCon at least once
    and is also the inventor of the Lepanto Opening for Italy.
    
    Needless to say, I don't think I want to turn my back on either of those
    two guys!  To that end, I'd like for us to come to a basic agreement
    over the Med and our respective backs.  I don't think anybody will be
    making any radical moves (at least to start), so I'd prefer it if we
    could do the following couple of things:
    
    1) Establish neutrality in the Med and Piedmont;
    
    2) Keep in touch with each other closely as the others' "source" of news
       in the other half of the board.
    
    In keeping with #2, I can tell you that Edi has been soliciting help for
    an attack on Turkey, although with Edi, you never know what his plan
    REALLY are.  As for the rest, nobody has made any solid offers to me and
    I'm still deciding what to do.  My options are pretty much attack
    Austria or Turkey right from the get go.  Here's hoping I make the right
    decision! :)

    am usually home in the evenings during the week.  (416) 281 1318 is my
    home number and during the day I can (usually) be reached at (416) 560
    9206 (cell phone).  Weekends are a gamble, but if you all around noon
    (give or take a couple of hours) you can sometimes catch me.  I live in
    Toronto, so it's eastern daylight savings time.
    
    Take care and good luck!

    I'll see if I can add to Pitt's temptation, although I may not do that
    until
    the Fall turn.  He may not want to join if he thinks France will be
    taken
    down TOO quickly and by too many people for him to get a decent share of
    the
    pie.

    We'll have to make sure we can establish units straddling the stalemate
    lines so this doesn't degenerate into a four-way draw though.  That's
    for
    quite a ways in the future though.  Think I'll see what Spring 01 brings
    first!
    
    Take Care and Good Luck!

    I've actually got England on the "line" at the moment and he says he is
    going to go along with the plan as well.  He just needed my assurances
    that I would be attacking France in '01.

    Hi Hohn!  Been a while, eh?  Was it Toronto or Kansas City we last met?
    Either way, this is our first time meeting over the board.  Mind you, I
    can say that to everyone in this game (although I MAY have played a game
    or two with Fassio at Brad Wilson's place in the early 90s).  My main
    goal for this game will be to try not to embarass myself.  Most of you
    guys are here because of your gaming reputations; I'm here because I'm
    passably good at publishing a Diplomacy zine... <g> And with all these
    observers watching... hmmmm.
    
    Anyway, I would have to say that the players in this game I would be
    most worried about would be you and Edi.  Being neighbours (and even
    natural enemies) with your two countries behooves me to pick a side.
    All things being equal, I would prefer to attack Austria simply based on
    the fact that, if I can pick up a couple of quick centres right from the
    start, it makes me that much harder to take down ie. more likely to
    survive to mid/end game.  I'll be happy to accomplish that - not that I
    won't try for a good draw/win, but that may be hard to come by with this
    cast.
    
    Would you be willing to attack Austria with me?   Obviously, it will
    depend on your relationship with Russia, but in his opening letter he
    indicated an interest in this idea.  For us to work together long term,
    it would require you to stick to land forces while I stuck to naval
    power.  This is workable and is usually how I/T manage to stick
    together.
    
    Comments?  I'm ready to order ven-tyo, rom-ven if you are amenable to
    this plan.

    I have not prohibited such press.  As has been repeatedly told me by
    a number of the players, they are all big boys and can filter
    whatever.  It is unlikely that an observer comment on tactical
    or strategic situations would bias this game anyway.  Some of them
    have encouraged MY comments, but I will be keeping my comments
    to a very dull minimum --- until after the game is over when I will
    be wrting an article on the game for my Diplomacy World column
    series on personality in Diplomacy.
    
    Luca, I find it fascinating that you think you would have something
    to say already, but please feel free to say it.

    My feeling about observer press is about the same as Hohn's. It's ok with
    me if there is discussion of future moves.
    
    I guess I figure, sure, it's *possible* that I'll have this cool plan for a
    convoyed attack, and my naive victim won't have noticed it, and then some
    observer blurts out, "Look, England can convoy A Cly - Ven!", and spoils
    the whole thing. But it doesn't seem too likely. I don't expect to have any
    naive victims. I might *be* one, but then observer commentary could only
    save me. So I understand if anyone objects to observers commenting on
    possible future moves. I also understand that anyone who objects is very
    probably out to get me. But this would only confirm all of my suspicions
    anyway. Pitt is only pretending to be paranoid to catch me off guard. It's
    a transparent trick.
    
    
    Cheers!

    I'm ignoring all rules and protest and will forge right into my discussion
    of future moves:
    
    Austria: f tri h, a bud-tri, a vie s a bud-tri.  You need to determine if
    the judge will handle "self dislodgement" orders correctly.
    
    England: a lpl-yor, f lon-yor, f edi-yor.  This defends your most valuable
    province from all possible moves.
    
    France: f bre-gas, a mar-gas, a par-gas.  This defends your most valuable
    province from all possible moves.
    
    Germany: f kie-hel, a mun-bur, a ber-sil.  This opens up offensive options
    with all neighbors.
    
    Italy: f nap-tyr, a ven-tyr, a rom h.  This allows you to determine which
    abbreviation for those annoy "tyr" provinces actually work with the judge
    software.
    
    Russia: f stp(sc)-liv, f sev(sc) h, a war-liv, a mos-liv.  This allows you
    to test the judge software regarding its ability to get confused.
    
    Turkey: f ank-con, a con-smy, a smy-ank.  Never really liked the starting
    position for your units.  Let's get them adjusted.
    
    
    I'll send $5 to each of you that follow my suggestions...

    As I said, I was just checking the various possibility :)
    I can imagine to have fun in having a bunch of people starting to say
    "Austria did it because of this and that, but if he had done this other ...,
    now if the next season he will attack in this way he might succeed ..."
    
    And so on. The "future" part of it shouldn't be done, according to players,
    so maybe even talking about the past will result difficult.
    I would like to write something if I have time, but I am surely not

    Hi all,
    
    Just wanted to say that I will _definitely_ be responding to
    all press by tonight or tomorrow morning.  Sorry for the
    delay...these darn work people just can't seem to get it
    into their heads that I have _important_ things to do...like
    play Dip!
    
    Regarding observer press, I personally don't mind observer
    commentary, regarding past, present or future moves.  I
    figure we're all experienced enough to use what we choose,
    and this _is_ a demo game after all.  But since reasonable
    player objection has already been made to everything but
    past moves, I think we should respect that.

    I have heard that Edi is a fearsome competitor.  I'm not quite sure how I
    ended up in this game, but it should be interesting.
    
    I agree wholeheartedly to neutrality in Pie and the Med.  As usual,
    France's main concerns lie on other fronts.  I've been solicited for
    attacks on Germany and on England.  No commitments as yet, regardless of
    whatever rumors are flying.  Indeed, I would bet that no one in this game
    has made any commitments or firm plans, but the next few days will be
    filled with rumors of alliances and planned attacks.
    
    Such is diplomacy.
    
    If you hear anything interesting, drop a line.  I will do likewise.

    Kaiser: Thank you for your kind words, but I think my reputation, such as
    it is, has run ahead of my actual accomplishments.  I have but a single win
    on the judges, a couple of draws, and otherwise I have taken early exits.
    
    Be that as it may, Austria may contact you about an interesting proposal.
    He wants to tackle the Russian right away, if you are amenable.  He
    suggested that a German move to the Baltic is an excellent way to put
    Russia on the ropes.  I suppose it would be mun-ruh, ber-kie, kie-bal.

    Okay, here is my brash and bold prediction for Spring 1905:
    
       England:  A EDI - NWG - NAO - IRI - ENG - NTH - NWG - EDI
             (Credit to game "goofy," where this was actually done, though
             the circuit was made THRICE on the same move, not just once
             [it would have been more but the judge has a limit on the
             length of an order].  To crown it all off, England also ordered
             A LVP - EDI to bounce the whole thing.  Truly a beautiful
             sight.)
    
    All players involved (I can predict fleet ownership at this point, but I
    thought it best to leave some suspense in the game) will get $5 from me too.

    John,
    
    I've seen some of your recent press messages.  I want to emphasze
    that you can say anything you want to whomever you want and I won't
    be interfereing in any way, but for your own information, I want you to
    understand why you were chosen (though I note with glee that you did register
    as an expert.... ;-).
    
    The game was designed to have a mix of people with FTF successes, postal
    successes, and E-Mail Judge successes.  Because of the trend toward
    anonymous games on the Judges, especially by many of the current
    expert E-Mail players, a lot of people turned me down.  They didn't
    want to play if it wasn't anonymous.  Conrad Minshall suggested I go look
    at his rating system for people with high ratings on "regular"
    non-anonymous games.  You were the highest person on that list who agreed
    to play (I started at the top and worked my way down).  I believe you
    are fourth on the DSI list for that category.
    
    Don't hesitate to ask me any questions about such stuff.  I have heard
    lots more (as you might imagine) from the Judge rookies.

    The hearst was pulling up to the rusty gates of the Dark Tower when a
    diminutive reporter reached the side of a cloaked visitor.
    
    "It has been recorded in the recent history that there is a malaise across the
    cyber field where the lessons of the Golden Age have long been forgotten.  The
    plea has been to demonstrate that which can be in the true glory and grandeur
    as those long forgotten warriors once daily posted to the world then consumed
    by paper not cyber mail.  For this the old cries echoed down the ages and
    several of the skeletons and shades have assembled to see if but new life can
    be bleed into the tired dullness of the ion diplomats.  For this
    responsibility we all share great seriousness and let us take this shallow
    chasim of cyber void and poor into it the style, flare and if need, by the
    verbosity of our souls to make things richer and better than they were
    before."
    
    The reported scribbled with great speed and in then looked up and commented:
    "....errrr...whatever."
    
    +++
    The purpose of the demonstrate game is to Demonstrate.  So for you observers I
    welcome all the comments and drivel you want to spew forth.  At the start of
    postal Diplomacy the press was often more important than the game...and
    usually more entertaining.  It is a social game and we should socialize
    (apology to  Republicans for using a dirty word).
    An ongoing commentary with tactical review, diplomatic options and the like
    has been used in the past Demo games in postal play without any real serious
    impact on the game.  It would be interesting in someways to see if there were
    an impact.

    I guess we're both home from work today, eh?  Or do you have net access
    from work?  Me, I'm here because my %$#%$@# truck won't start.  Not that
    I mind; I could use the mental health day.  Just replaced my fuel line
    last week and now I think the sucker froze up.  Ah well, put some gas
    line antifreeze in, so hopefully she'll start tomorrow.
    
    Anyway, I just want to let you know that I'm in full support of our
    "watch-out-for-each-other" plan.  Also, I'll do my best to keep in
    touch.  I just upgraded my internet account to 24 hours a day (had to -
    I also design web pages for whoever will pay me to do so...<g>), so
    there's no excuse not to do so.  I think fear of public embarassment
    will keep my attention from wandering too far in THIS game...

    Right, ok, we are on the same wavelength. Hm, I guess our respective
    media's styles aren't so different after all! What a relief.
    
    >Well, assuming that Edi's plan to you is the same as the one he sent to
    >me,
    
    Yes, of course that's always an open question, I suppose. But I'd already
    heard confirmation from Russia that Edi was disseminating the same plan to
    him and me, and he mentioned that you had already been consulted, too, so I
    was pretty sure.
    
    (Every time I write 'Edi' I feel like I'm ordering one of my fleets!)
    
    >that would call for you and I to attack France.  Normally, I

    Exactly. I'm not usually disposed to attack *anyone* in 1901 as England,
    myself. But I agree that it's worth some risk to make the game a real
    'Demo'. (However, I will be counting on you to keep an eye on the Rascal
    Birsan -- I feel certain that this large plan is carefully calculated to
    benefit him, and trust you to be the ablest among us to see through it!)
    
    
    So, I'll open to the Channel and you to the Piedmont, then. And we're
    expecting Austrian troops in Germany in 1902. In the mean time, I will do
    my best to tempt Pitt into scooping spoils from a hapless Frenchman.
    Mun-Bur would chill any French hopes of a drawn-out struggle!
    
    And you know, with any luck, it will take Russia and Austria a lot longer
    to ferret out Turkey than it will you and me to finish France, assuming
    German help....
    
    Cheers!

    No, no, not Sir Winnie. Who's he? The teenage son of Lord Churchill? Yes, I
    forsee great things for him, but not until the 1930's or so. I meant LADY
    RANDOLPH Churchill. You know, she is very fond of French fashion, and
    always likes to take the ferry over for a quick browse through the shops.
    
    
    Ok, down to business.
    Yes, I would be happy to remove one or two of the Slowmail Riders, just to
    even up the odds a bit. Like practically everyone, I prefer taking on my
    first enemy in 1902. However, if you would be willing to commit equally,
    I'd go after France on the first move.
    
    With Russia going south (still the plan, as I understand it), the situation
    is ideal for a blitz of France. If I could then use my southward momentum,
    we'd have a really good defensive set-up, you and I, without much worry
    about getting in each other's ways. We'd be ready to take on the Legends
    Birsan and White, mano-a-mano.
    
    Lemme know.

    I have spoken about it with Russia. I have attempted to speak to Italy
    about it, but so far he hasn't answered me. You might give him a nudge.
    
    Russia and I are interested. But, it goes without saying (practically) that
    I couldn't fall in with the plan until and unless I were sure that Italy is
    on board.

    Vienna, (Free Press)
    The simple ebony casket in the vaults of Saint Stephans moaned with a small
    shudder.  Could it be that in the dark void of cyberspace a simple scream has
    echoed down the time line?  Has not sentient beings learned that the origin of
    their intelligence is simple self foolishness?  Seems that there may be yet
    another field in which there may be sorrows cast in heaps upon the sycophant
    tardy minds of those who would look upon life as some sort of challenage and
    fail in its endeavor to reach but a simple accord with its neighbor: death.
     " Alas it appears that introductions in that regard may be due shortly." and
    with that the shadow of BirSauron took form as the lid yawned on another era
    in another world in another time.

    Hohn,
    
    Greetings, O wicked witch of the south.
    
    ;-)
    
    OK, now that I've taken my life in my hands and tweaked your nose, let me
    cast myself at your mercy.  Seriously, I honestly can't tell you how
    thrilled I feel to be part of this game.  I admit to claiming a certain
    passing competency in Diplomacy but I would never be so bold as to put
    myself on a plane with the other players here.  I have direct experience of
    a couple and knowledge of the reputation of the rest, yourself included.
    My goal is to not embarrass myself and, if I'm lucky, to survive til the end.
    
    I know that probably sounds like I'm laying it on pretty thick (and, I
    suppose, I am) but it's no less true for all of that.  So, to that end, I'm
    offering my hand in friendship with the hope that we can initiate a
    cooperative partnership.  At this point, it seems to me that direct miltary
    action is probably not immediately in the cards (but, please, tell me if
    you think I'm missing something).  However, at the very least, I'd like to
    establish and maintain well-developed lines of communication.  Any insight
    or input you can give me will be very much appreciated.  I'll do my best to
    reciprocate.  I look forward to hearing from you soon.

    you can ask my receptionist to page me or you can leave me a voicemail

    Howdy, all.  I apologize for the delay in getting out my opening messages
    but I've been away for several days and I've just now found the time to get
    caught up.  I'll be sending out individual, private messages momentarily.
    Meantime, regarding Edi's request for phone numbers, I'm all for it.
    However, I'll be sending mine in a private message to each of you as
    opposed to in a public broadcast.  That way, observers or other folks who
    pull down a HISTORY of the game won't also get my home phone number.  I'm
    not paranoid, I'm just careful...(besides, you're not paranoid if they

    Edi,
    
    Hi!  I've been looking forward to this ever since I heard you were going to
    be playing. I have very fond memories of DC/WDC and, in particular, playing
    on two boards with you.  I consider myself very fortunate to have won the
    event and, while I don't mean to sell myself short, you played a large part
    in my success.  Our partnership in Game 2 on Saturday, resulting in the
    3-way EFT, was one of the games that contributed to my point total.
    However, your support in Game 3 on Sunday vs. Leif Bergman and his unholy
    alliance saved me from early elimination and, ultimately, prevented Leif
    from surpassing me.  I like to think that I played well, too, but no man is
    an island and any skill I possess would have been for naught without your
    support and aid.
    
    So, though I was too elated and exhausted to say it then, let me say it
    now, Thanks!
    
    OK...on to this game.  Once again we are neighbors.  As Austria and
    Germany, I *hope* that we don't have much inclination to tangle with each
    other.  That would, it seems to me, be fatal to us both.  By the same
    token, I don't suppose that we have much early opportunity for direct
    action with our forces, either.  At the very least, however, I'd like to
    maintain well-developed lines of communication (particularly about these
    other postal players...their reputation precedes them and I could sure use
    your input and insight).  I'd also be interested in hearing any other ideas
    or suggestions you may have.  I look forward to hearing from you.

    Yes, an unforgettable day in Diplomacy history.  In fact, while we
    enjoy the peace before the calm, the quiet before the storm, let's

    folk away from E-mail Dip forever, for what Manus didn't reveal,

    Thank you Nick, for trying to make my demo game into a reincarnation
    of 'goofy'.... seriously though, for the rookie Judge players who
    haven't seen game results before, thank you for showing them an example.
    
    It still really bugs me that the judge results print the country when
    you support another's country's units, but it FAILS if you try to
    put the country in the order to the judge....
    
    Is that the only case where turning a judge result around and sending
    it back to the judge as orders for the next phase is a syntactical
    error???

    That and the fact that the judge prepends your own power name and a colon
    on the front of each line.  And it won't like seeing the (*void*) or
    (*no convoy*) or (*cut*) or (*dislodged*) stuff coming back at it either.
    And, unless I'm mistaken, you have to remove the final period that it
    puts on the end of each order as well.
    
    But yes, the "don't mention foreign nationalities, even though I, the
    omniscient judge, will do so" feature which bugs you bugs me as well.

    Well, for the first move, if you'll just open to Burgundy (and Kie-Hol),
    I'll open to the Channel (and Lvp-Wal). Chances are you won't get in,
    unless you set him up with a nice lie right away. If you do get in, France
    will crack a lot easier. I remember only once being part of an early
    anti-France alliance, it was maddeningly difficult. Oh, I also remember
    being a French victim, which wasn't all that much fun either. Anyway, we
    should be prepared for a longish fight if you don't slip into Burg right
    away.
    
    Unless I can get Italy involved here. Always a mixed blessing. Well, I'll
    look into it.

    You're far too modest.  I've heard nothing but good things about you
    and your play, and your column and your Dipcon win both speak
    eloquently with respect to your skill.

    Well, since this is my first round of negotiations, I'm afraid I don't

    some return messages.  How about you?  How do things look to you so

    I haven't yet decided which way I'll go, but I'll probably work with
    the one person who seems most willing to demonstrate mutual trust, and
    desirous of working together in a strong alliance.  How about you?
    Looking to the West/Northwest, I imagine?

    It's a pleasure to meet you.  Congrats on pulling France!  It's my
    personal favorite.
    
    Anyway, although we may not have a whole lot to talk about right now
    with respect to direct cooperation, I know you understand the value of

    In terms of information, regrettably I can't give you anything

    Sure.  I must warn you, I'm on my first round of negotiations due to

    Out of curiosity, how's it looking on your end so far?

    As expected, I currently have friendly messages from just about
    everyone, and while that would normally make me happy, with this
    crowd, I'm just trying to figure out who's only feeding me _half_ a
    load of bull instead of a full load! ;)
    
    I'll probably end up going with the person who seems most interested
    in mutual trust and working together in a strong alliance.  One happy
    thing about both of our countries is that we both have some pretty
    good defensive options.  Which way are you thinking of going, so far?

    That was my fault, Edi.  I accidentally sent you mail directly that
    was intended for the judge.  When you forwarded the letter back to me,
    my signon info was still at the top, and that made the judge think
    your post was coming from me.  If you try again, with your own
    password and using:
    
    signon aghodstoo <your password>
    press to <whichever power you want, first letter only>

    Mark also indicated interest to me in going against Austria.  While I have no
    problem with that in theory, I realize you may well have some RT concerns.  I'd
    like to address them, out in the open.  If the three of us do gang tackle Edi,
    what assurances can I give you to alleviate any concerns you may have about
    being next?  Because to be honest, RT is all fine and good for a while, but
    every time I do it, I always seem to notice that Turkey gets the short end of
    the stick.  I'd rather avoid that setup long-term, if I can.

    I'm amenable, but let's try to iron out some more details, too.  What about
    division of the Austrian/Balkan centers?  And the Grecian question?

    As I'm sure you've heard by now, the Master gets copies of

    not necessary.

    I hate wasting the turn by bouncing.  I suspect there may be
    friction between AI, because Cal has a rep for being a bit
    unorthodox.  Effective, but unpredictable nevertheless.  I'd
    be willing to bet that he and Edi don't do the standard AI
    alliance.
    
    I'd like to go out to CON in Spring 1901, and then ANK.
    Natch, I'd prefer not to see SEV-BLA.  So let's go with
    MOS-UKR, SEV HOLDS, please.  If we're _really_ going to get
    it on, WAR-GAL would be nice, too.  Up to you, though...if
    we're RT, we'll have to tangle with Edi eventually (sooner
    rather than later is my bet).  Although depending on what
    Cal does, we can probably manage with just two of your four
    units south.  Depending on the north, MOS-STP, WAR-UKR, SEV
    HOLDS might be interesting, too.  Let me know which way
    you're leaning.  You've undoubtedly had more negotiating
    with the other players in this game so far, so I'd love to
    hear your impressions.

    I think it might be better to do the following:
    
    UKR-RUM
    SEV S UKR-RUM
    
    That gets an army into RUM, which is crucial in any land war
    against Austria.  I _hate_ having that fleet in RUM, it
    can't support into SER or BUD.  With my assistance in BUL if
    necessary, you're guaranteed to get in, practically.

    opening in a full-scale assault against Russia.
    
    That sounds good to me.  I would like to swap my Rumania for your
    Greece in 1902, since it makes more sense for me to be our fleet
    power, while you are our major land power.  I'll start sending out

    2) 1901 will be the 'tentative, touchy-feely' grab for neutrals and to
    view other's actions;
    3) True G/R actions can commence in '02.
    As for your choice of targets, it makes no mind to me.  Austria mentions
    rumblings of an E/F, and, if true, gives you the 'opportunity' (HA!) to
    attack both of your western neighbors.  I for one don't buy that talk,
    though:  my guess is that they will be at each other's throats soon
    enough (perhaps you've even ensured that, hmmm)?   :>)
    
    My goal is indeed to head south.  I'm trying to work a Gal DMZ with Edi
    and to ensure I get RUM, but beyond that, it's still wide open.  I have
    Turkey bombarding me with plans, Austria offering various schemes,
    etc...who knows, they're probably all teaming up on me, and this is a
    big smokescreen to delude me (wouldn't be the first time)!  :>(
    
    You and I can form an arc of 180* coverage, with you facing N and W, and
    me E and S.  Once the 'locals' are taken care of, you and I may be in a
    position to kick some serious butt.  Having said this (and rethinking
    your note to me), I'd hit France, if I were you.  If you're asking me to
    go south first, then any anti-Eng deal by us is immediately weakened in
    the early game.  Best to let E/F perhaps fight (with you being the
    balancer) and then turn on John Bull when I can build northern units and
    help tie down his extreme flank.
    
    Sound like a "weiner" to you?
    
    Again, Russia thanks her German cousin for the encouraging words, and is
    chomping at the bit to grab her share of glory.  Oh, and THANKS for
    Sweden; this little gesture of friendship shall not be forgotten!   Even
    now, we're commissioning busts of your likeness throughout Russia.

    That makes sense.  I have to say, though, that I would need some pretty
    significant reassurances from you regarding our mutual border before I
    would feel comfortable agreeing to this strong an eastward push.
    Specifically, I would need to know that BUR was going be a DMZ, so that MUN
    would not be threatened.  Would you be wiiling to agree to that?
    
    >>From there, you can take Holland and Denmark and be poised for Sweden.  The

    Yes, I see this and, if coupled with an Austrian push, it could be
    devastating.  I am initially inclined favorably towards it (though I still
    need to hear from Austria).  However, I cannot seriously consider it
    without your reassurances and committment to protect and demilitarize our
    mutual border.  Please let me know how you feel about that.

    I look forward to that.  Additionally, I'm thinking about trying to do a

    or, possibly, even The General.  In order to do that, I'd like to ask two

    so that you get copies of all private messages between players?  After the
    game is over, I'd like to read through the archive of that.  Two, could you
    ask each player to give you a brief comment on the game (strategy, plans,

    IMPORTANT MESSAGE: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!
    
    Well, things are off to a smashing start... Hohn has made Edi into
    a Judge technology wary beast through his mistakes in dealing
    with forwarding mail, not once, but TWICE!  Does everyone have that
    straight now?  Be careful from whence you copy and reply to things!!
    I want to thank Hohn for providing our new Judge guys an example
    of what NOT to do ;-)
    
    What I really want to do here, though, is to be clear about what the
    demo nature of this game will mean -- now and in the future.
    
    1) I am seeing all press between players that is occuring through
    the Judge.  I am archiving ALL of that press for future use.  I
    also am saving all press and E-Mail related to the game that is occuring
    outside of the Judge which is forwarded to me.  The general preference
    is that all communication occur through the Judge because then this
    happens automatically; however, with the problems between Edi and
    Hohn i don't want to be dictatorial about this.  Edi has been good
    about CCing me, and I think that nothing important has yet been lost.
    Please, let's keep it that way.
    
    2) I have been writing a series of articles for Diplomacy World over
    the last couple of years on the role of Personality in Diplomacy.
    I view this game as an experiment on some aspects of that issue.
    I will be writing an article on the game with that focus AFTER it is
    over.  Some of the rest of you have inquired about writing your own
    articles and having access to that complete press stream to do so.
    I am indifferent on this request.  There is no need to decide now,
    but keep that question in mind.  I certainly encourage the writing
    of additional articles.
    
    3) In a related point, some of the novice observers want to have access
    to the complete press stream after the game is over, so they can learn
    by the subtleties of how you all have done things over the course
    of the game.  I am inclined to the negative on this request, but can
    easily be dissuaded to the positive.  Certainly, your public endgame
    statements would be archived through the Diplomatic Pouch web page
    along with the game history so that people could look at that at
    a minimum.
    
    4) To add to that complete press stream, I have already been asking
    that you relate to me  (in private "press to m") the gist of phone
    calls that take place.  This already has been happening to my
    satisfaction and I hope it will continue.  In addition, I will
    encourage seasonal and yearly reports to me on some of your background
    thinking as you go along.  There is no need to repeat to me what is
    obvious from the press stream, but to add what is NOT obvious from it.
    Again, here so far, I feel that I am being adequately informed but
    when the tactical/strategic situations get more intricate, i may
    begin prodding you to write more.  You may want to save a copy of
    these statements for your own public endgame statements as well.
    
    5) After some discussion, we have decided that the observers are free
    to write press discussing what they see going on.  I'm reserving the
    right to reign them in if they get out of control.
    
    6) The public broadcast releases (at least most of them) will be
    merged together and published in my postal/E-Mail Diplomacy
    szine, The Abyssinian Prince, along with complete season by season
    game reports and maps.  The szine is a three week szine and should be
    able to keep up with the game fairly well.... at least it did with the
    previous demo game.  I offer to the players in this game free
    subscriptions as a perk for the life of the game.  For E-Mail
    subs, they are free to anyone by sending the message:
    
    subscribe tap
    
    to majordomo@diplom.org
    The disadvantage to this is that E-Mail subs come in the szine's
    source code which bothers some people (e.g. Pitt) a lot and some
    people not at all.  Postscript versions also are available on
    diplom.org's archive site.  Ordinary postal subs are a dollar per issue,
    but as I said, I want to give you players a perk for your willingness
    to do this.  Let me know your preference for being added to the postal
    mailing list.
    
    Thanks!

    I think you're spot on there!  I've given it serious consideration and I've
    decided to declare that Germany is being played by a simulacrum of me at
    the first sign of trouble...  Can't blame me if the *!%#@ programmer

    Good.  That matches my thoughts perfectly.
    
    >Austria is trying hard to get me to attack France
    
    So I've heard.  He's pressuring me to do the same.  That's Edi's style, I
    think - he did the same at DC/WDC when he was France and I was England
    except the target then was supposed to be Germany.  Edi isn't much for
    cautious play...  At this point, I'm planning to take the conservative
    route, grab a couple of neutral SC's in 1901, and see what develops for 1902.
    
    >Russia seems scared of both Austria and Turkey.
    
    Well, that's good for you.  Gives you a strong potential ally and your
    choice of targets.
    
    >Turkey hasn't written
    
    Nor here either, though I did see his broadcast saying he was temporarily
    unavailable.
    
    >Anything from the west sound interesting?
    
    I haven't yet heard from France but, as you say with Turkey, I'm not
    interpreting that negatively (yet) since I just wrote my opening greeting
    to him yesterday.  England has been in touch (and I know Jamie from
    previous PBEM games).  He appears to still be in the "sounding out" stage
    at this point and is not proposing any specific plans.  Given my (limited)
    knowledge of his playing style, I expect a conservative 1901 followed by a
    strong aggressive push in 1902.  Of course, I plan to try hard to make sure
    that I'm *not* the target of that push...
    
    That's about it for now.  I'll write more if I hear anything useful or the
    situation changes.  Please do the same and, in any case, lets stay in touch
    regularly.
    
    Take care.

    A fact not gone unnoticed by most, I assume.  Let me know if it works, will
    ya?  I can be re-rated "chopped liver" in no time flat if it will keep the
    wolf from my door.
    
    >Hope this finds you well, Pitt!
    
    It does (and very excited to be here, too).  I hope you are the same.
    
    >What German wouldn't love to hear
    >there's DMZs all along our mutual borders?
    
    I don't know about other Germans but I can tell you that this German would.
     Shall we?  DMZ's in PRU and SIL?  What about BAL?  I'm game if you are.
    
    >What Russian wouldn't thrill
    >to be given SWE without a fight in '01 (hint hint)?!
    
    And an oh-so-subtle hint it was, too <g>.  Not too subtle, though.  SWE is
    yours, Faz.
    
    Beyond that, I agree with your analysis of how the opening year will
    progress.  Barring anything extraordinary, we'll probably see conservative
    openings and delicate probes of neutral areas.  My primary concern is to
    ensure that at least 2 of my 3 neighbors are friendly (if not actively in
    alliance with me).  It is of the utmost importance to me that Russia fall
    into that category.
    
    Having made that clear (I hope), I am compelled to state the obvious - if
    RG comes together, then I'll be engaged in hostilities with either E or F
    (or, ghod forbid, both).  To that end, I would hope that Russia would focus
    most of her energies in the south, while I focus mine to the west.  A solid
    and secure border between the two of us should go a long way towards aiding
    our endeavors in other areas.

    >same in every regard, and that we can, indeed, "do business" in the near
    >future.
    
    I feel exactly the same and I am very gratified to hear your feelings.
    Shall we commit to the gestation of an RG alliance?  Friendly neutrality in
    1901 with a close examination of joint action possibilities in 1902?
    Please let me know.  I look forward to hearing from you.

    >what's the policy about observer press in the game ?
    
    1. Observer press in support of Germany and her allies is allowed.
    
    2. Observer press mocking Germany's enemies is strongly encouraged.
    
    >Are we (observer) allowed to talk about tactics or would you consider

    3.  Clarification:  observer press complimenting Germany and her
    allies is de rigeur.  Observer press finding fault with the
    tactics of Germany and her allies is disallowed (as well being
    an obvious indication that the observer's parentage likely
    included certain 4-footed, baa'ing creatures)

    Excellent.  Normally, as you say, I'd be incliend to sit back, make a
    conservative opening, and find an ally to join in the attack in 1902.
    However, given that this is demo game, coupled with the caliber of
    competition, I'm inclined to make a quick, decisive attack in 1901.  France
    as a target is just fine with me.

    Dear M. Jean-Bark,
    
    Our discussion, which seemed so promising, somehow ended rather abruptly.
    Possibly you missed my last reply? I attach it below.
    
    I suppose at this point I would like to begin to come to some reasonably
    specific arrangement. So, first, I hope we might agree not to sail our
    fleets along the other's coast. And second, I would be willing to agree to
    play a Churchill opening in particular if you would commit to some
    particular opening in turn.
    
    And if it suits you, we might even broach with Germany the possibility of a
    Western Triple (which could also be considered an Alliance of the Internet
    Diplomats, except for Hohn Cho). Germany has only just started talking, so
    I don't know what he'd think about such a thing.

    Dear M. Cyberdog,
    
    We are always ready to engage in any defensive manouever whatever. Our
    fleets are so practiced in defensive manouevers that they are constantly
    sailing around each other in circles.
    
    I think I will give Minister Churchill charge of the initial melee. Assuming
    our paranoia is well-founded (as paranoia always is, after all), the point
    of the dagger can be turned immediately toward the Huns.
    
    Do you think this is wise? Or would it be better to begin Mediterranean

    I got a phone call from Edi, no doubt he has already conveyed to you its gist.
    
    No new diplomatic topics were broached. I confirmed that I was up for his
    E/R/I/A alliance suggestion. We discussed the relative conservatism,
    especially in openings, of internet play, and we agreed that in this game
    we are especially interested in demonstrating something a bit unusual and
    lively, even if not our favorite plays tactically.

    For what it is woth, for hall92 and hall93 I saved the full

    on my FTP site   ftp://ftp.sentex.ca/usr/nick  or
    http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/Ftp  )
    there were no reprocussions with this, and it seemed

    Since this game is in the provenance of Jim Burgess, whose home is
    Providence, I thought it would be ok to invoke the Old and Strange critters

    Anyway, Edi started it. If it bothers you, or gives you the chills, invade

    Ok.
    Since Barkdull is obviously no duffer, we'd better be a bit careful, so
    that it doesn't seem as though we're making a concerted effort. I'll quiet
    down and let you work on him for a while.
    
    He did mention this point to me: if Russia is going South, it is to our (F
    and E's) advantage if Germany goes East.
    I'm afraid I couldn't help but point out to him that it ought to be to our
    (F and E's) advantage for Germany to go East in any case! Well, I had to
    say that, since there's only one reason I'd NOT want you to go East, and we
    don't want him thinking about that reason too much.
    
    Anyway, he may be disposed to go for some kind of deal with you, Mun-Ruh in
    exchange for Par-Pic, Mar-Spa. And if you and I each take a fairly
    conservative stance, declining to offer any outright alliance with France,
    he may be more likely to try not to antagonize either of us with Bre-Eng or
    X-Bur.
    
    Until recently I was under the misimpression that John Bark. was from the
    PBM side of the hobby. Now I understand the line-up.

    Greetings, Your German-ness!
    As my title indicates, you've stumped me on the Start Trek quiz.   I can
    tell you that Ricardo MontalKhan was in ST2 (rich, Corinthian
    leather-plated starships), but as for Hortas being on the sending or
    receiving end of mind-melds, well...I'll hazard a guess and say that
    they GIVE the stuff, as opposed to taking it ('tis always better to
    give, than to receive...)
    
    Our plans seem like a "weiner," and I appreciate your candor regarding
    E/F and their lack of info.  England was a regular writer to me, but it
    was  a two-day "burst transmission", designed to achieve a DMZ,
    delineate territorial claims (i.e., "Don't try for Nwy, Faz"), and then
    press on vs his 'real' neighbors (you & Fra).   France is like any other
    France in 1901 regarding Russia:  short of the "all-out Sil & Bur
    offensive vs Mun" (aaaaaghhh!!!), there's nothing for him to discuss
    with me after pleasantries--and that's been the case here.
    
    Austria _still_ has not pledged a Galician DMZ with me (insert the above
    scream here again, and square it), yet is offering up mucho plans for
    the East.   Turkey HAS pledged Arm and Bla DMZs and an alliance
    (ooooohh), and it looks nice.  Still, I'll keep my options open.
    
    Sayyyyyy......you wouldn't consider Mun-Tyo (OR Boh), me in War-Gal,
    then we take Vie, would you?  I know the standard fare that happens to
    Hohenzollern emperors when they traipse around down south (Ita,
    Aus)...they get sucked out of position and end up repenting before Popes
    (Henry V at Canossa).  Still, if you have doubts about Edi or long-term
    gain with him around, I offer YET ANOTHER mindless offer...this _is_ a
    Demo game, and I would imagine a little joy de vivre wouldn't be a bad
    thing....anyway, just a madcap diversionary thought; no biggie.
    
    If it has any merit with you (and I don't need a mind meld to know your
    answer!), please let me know.  If, in the off-chance you actually want
    to try this -- and I'm sure it _would_ work, actually -- then I need to
    get Italy on board for a ven-Tyo, Rom-ven shift, and we can probably
    take two from the Ed-meister before anyone reacts!
    Take care, Pitt.  I remain,
    Yours for whacky and zany openings

    Oho!  So now you're pumping me for information, eh?  And under the guise of
    flattery no less.  I sure am glad that you're on my side.  In the spirit of
    our alliance, I'll tell you what I now right now about EF plans - squat.
    England has been in regular communication, as has France, but both are
    being reserved and tentative.  I interpret that as first turn jitters (just
    like mine) and look for something more concrete as soon as the fall.
    
    >Having said this (and rethinking
    >your note to me), I'd hit France, if I were you.
    
    In general, that's my preference, too.  I have to bring England into the
    deal, however, so it may take me until Fall 1901 or Spring 1902 to get this
    under way.  Alternatively if England balks, then I'll go full bore to get
    France to squeeze the PM with me.
    
    >If you're asking me to

    pacified and you're ready to join me in a sweep north.

    Hi Jim
    Just some preliminary (opening) thoughts regarding the S'01 Rusian =
    moves...
    I will update this message as necessary if later news/events occur...
    
    Note my question at the end.
    
    DIPLOMACY THIS TURN.  Fairly extensive.  I had good exchanges with =
    Austria, Germany, England and Italy (in that order), a slight surge as =
    of today (29 Jan) with Turkey, and marginal talks with France.  Everyone =
    seems to be moving out at a brisk pace--so indicative of this sharp =
    crowd!
    
    RUSSIAN OPTIONS.  Austria has been 'driving the train' with the Four =
    Powers (I/A/R/E) in attempting to coalesce an alliance against F, T and =
    (next year) G.  Naturally, this benefits Edi, as it diverts any R/I =
    looks away from him, and also helps him subdue Hohn.  Given, however, =
    that this plan also diverts E from me, keeps G set up for the kill, and =
    provides me with help vs T, I think I'll give it a shot.  I've told Tur =
    I'll forego a Bla Sea fleet move (well, I never said that with =
    finality...), so the S'01 move should be a surprise to him (hopefully =
    not to me)!
    The move will appear fairly benign, but is designed as an anti-Turk =
    plan.  I hopefully have a Gal DMZ, and will be fighting for RUM in F'01.
    
    I'm also working an arrangement with Pitt in Germany, who seems sincere, =
    as well as with Cal's Italy.  I need friends who can help me attack =
    Austria (who will grow too big, too fast) and/or England (should this =
    4-way erode rapidly for some reason), and G/I fit both bills.=20
    
    I trust G and I, and believe them--and Eng (although of the three, =
    Jamie's motives are the most worrisome for me after the early game).  =
    Austria is a great player, as is Turkey, so I want to do anything =
    possible to keep them separate, even if it means helping one of them get =
    big.  My hope is that one will kill the other, and I (and a neighbor) =
    can kill the second...before he gets me.
    
    I expect a 4-way opening vs F (Eng and Ita) and Turkey (Rus and Aus).  =
    The beauty of the opening moves is that it will only seem like I and E =
    are aggressors, given that they must move to "red flag" areas, i.e., Eng =
    and Pie.   Aus and Rus, however, can smokescreen others with fairly =
    "standard" moves that can be construed in a couple of ways.  How this =
    deal will hold up arfter 1901 is anyone's guess--especially as Aus wants =
    a massive hit on Germany in 1902 (before Turkey is dead)!  That's where =
    I draw the line.
    
    It should prove an interesting season.  Winter 1900 confirms a standard =
    dip trait:  you do and/or agree with those that write you the most, and =
    have few qualms about hosing the low-writers.
    
    Russian transmission of 29 Jan ends.
    
    Tsar Faz
    
    JIM:   How do I include press with my move submissions?  Just type the =
    orders and write a bunch of press underneath before I 'signoff?' if so, =
    how does the Judge know to print that press if I update my orders?

    The simplest assurances you could give me would be to stick to building
    armies as I stick to building fleets.  That's always been a good method
    of keeping tabs on each other as contrary builds are a pretty good
    tip-off something isn't kosher.
    
    > I'm amenable, but let's try to iron out some more details, too.  What about
    > division of the Austrian/Balkan centers?  And the Grecian question?
    
    How about I get tri, gre, vie, ser and you get bul, rum, bud and
    (eventually) sev?  As for Greece, I suspect it would be fairer if you
    took it until such time as you gained sev.  As long as you don't put a
    fleet there, I have no problem with this.

    I haven't decided what to do yet.  Part of me wants to play it
    conservatively, but part wants to do something unusual.  This IS a demo
    game after all.  Ah well, we'll see.

    Hello Hohn
    Thanks for the reply.  As for the Bla Sea thing, if moving there will =
    cause ill will, then I'll probably just forego the whole =

    inkling of an R/T.  You can imagine what this savvy group will think/do =
    if they see no Black Sea movement, me in Gal, etc...the red flags would =
    be going up everywhere.   One (or none) of us in Bla would at least have =
    given a season's worth of cover for us.  But I fully understand your =
    concerns, believe me!   They are no doubt the same concerns I have over =
    a unit in ARM, for example.
    
    Interesting report on Germany.  If what you say is true, then he's a =
    real smooth liar, as his little fairly "oozed" sincerity and relief at =
    having no enemy in his rear--for the time being.  (The arrangement is =
    less of an alliance, than a benevolent neutrality and respect of mutual =
    DMZs.)  One false slip by either of us would cause the other to jump, =
    I'm sure...which is the feeling you might have read/heard about =
    regarding G/R relations.  I don't know.   I guess we'll see what happens =
    come fall (re:  Swe) and the builds in Winter.  England is still an =
    enigma, so I'll take whatever touchy-feely goodwill I can get from the =
    Hun.
    
    Anyway, here's to us!  Clue me in on any gouge you hear from the others. =
     The only stuff I've heard about you was from Austria, and contained two =
    points:
    1) He wants me to attack you early on (naturally...) and
    2) He thinks you're a great player (and so I've heard from many others)

    Tsar Faz,
    
    I'm glad to see we're in accord.  Regarding BLA, I really
    would prefer keeping it empty or bouncing.  Having either of
    us there in 1901 is just too dangerous, regardless of the
    level of trust between us.  I am perhaps more willing to see
    your fleet come out to BLA in 1902, however, to help us in
    our endeavors should we need it.  Once we have established
    that baseline trust with one year of cooperation under our
    belts, it will be more palatable.  And it would hopefully
    lead to bringing your fleet out to the Med.
    
    I will of course not move to ARM, not unless you want to do
    that horrid SEV-CON shuffle thing.  Personally, I think the
    move is dangerous for both sides, and can be stymied in a
    big way with ION-AEG.
    
    Regarding your peace accord with Germany, do you believe he
    is sincere?  I have heard that he bears you ill will.  I
    find that report difficult to credit, since it makes little
    sense for either of you to fight in 1901 (aside from SWE),
    but I just wanted to pass that info along to you.
    
    Other than that, I'm still waiting to hear from AI on my
    first/second round of talks.  I'll let you know what's up
    when I do.

    Interesting.  According to one source at least, they have
    concluded a peace agreement.
    
    Hmm.  I tend to believe my information, simply because it is
    not generally in Germany's or Russia's interest to attack
    each other this early.  Oh well, I suppose we'll see soon.
    
    Out of curiosity, where do you think you will move?

    If Russia goes south, then it seems to me our advantage lies in seeing
    Germany go east.  This would open up Scandinavia for you and relieve

    Edi, I discussed the anti-Russian opening with Germany.  He said you had

    will not interfere.  I speculated that you had not broached the subject

    Hello again Hohn!
    Thanks for your note, which I can only get to in a quick reply (work is
    calling).  Anyway, my views generally jive with yours, which is what I
    was hoping for!.
    
    I think getting you into CON is S'01 is both logical and necessary.  I'm
    not so sure we won't see some sort of early-on A/I...again, you know
    these guys, and I don't.  But my sources tell me there is some Aus
    scheming ongoing.  Even if there is no truth to the rumor, having the
    Turk "out and about" is a good deterrent to any Lepantos and a nice
    "check and balance" on Edi's growth.  I've never been one to look
    askance on an R/T.  Turkey is generally my first choice to play by mail,
    and R/Ts are my favorite alliance.
    
    I also agree that Ukr-Rum is better than the fleet.   Let me mull over
    the Sev-holds idea.  I'm not 100% against it, but there are advantages
    to having one of us in Bla.  (Guaranteed support into RUM is one of
    them, as well as eventually passing thru CON en route to link up in the
    fight vs A/I fleets is another.)  Still, I recognize your sensitivities,
    and will weigh that heavily into my decision to (probably) accede to
    your wishes.  I also hope, in reciprocation, that you have no plans for
    Smy-Arm???
    
    Other scuttlebutt from across the board:  I've reached a peace agreement
    with Germany, and am trying to do so with England, too.  This would
    leave just one "mutual enemy" down south for us to deal with, if you
    catch my drift....I've heard there may be an E/F cabal, but I discount
    that rumor.  Again, there's also been some talk of A/I actions, but that
    may be bluff to keep the weaker powers from being picked on right off
    the bat.  We'll see in 1901, I guess.
    
    Anyway, Hohn, count me in as an enthusiastic supporter of the R/T!  This
    goes a long way in cementing good relations between us.   Please do stay
    in touch, and bear with me if I a little slow in replying over the next
    day or two...
    
    Yours for Good Relations,

    Pardon me for being remiss.  I believe we should conclude a non-agression
    pact.  I have no desire to challenge England's mastery of the seas.  But I
    am sorry, I don't know what a Churchill is.  I thought you were alluding to
    your chain of command.  I presume it's an assault on Norway, as WC himself
    undertook?
    
    I think our attitude toward Germany depends upon what you have heard from
    Russia.  The Tsar contacted me, but, as you know, France and Russia rarely
    exchange more than pleasantries in the opening year.   From what little I
    could gather, my impression is that he thinks the south to be his major
    concern.  Have you heard anything?

    He has contacted me but, regarding any discussion of a joint AG eastward
    push, he has been so indirect as to be absolutely silent on the matter.
    This concerns me regarding what he has told you vs. what he is saying to
    me.  It appears that he is trying to mislead us and, I must assume, drive a
    wedge between us.  I would hate for that to happen.
    
    To that end, I am enclosing a portion of your message to me which I assume
    was never intended to get to me.  I don't know if it was as a result of an
    error in the command you issued the judge, a judge problem, or an extremely
    sneaky way of attempting to mislead me (if the latter, I take my hat off to
    you).  I am going to operate under the assumption, however, that it was due
    to some error and not your intent.  Accordingly, I hope you can see that,
    by returning it to you, I am foregoing significant potential advantage in
    the interests of furthering a friendly relationship between us.  I hope you
    will desire to do the same.

    You will as soon as it gets published.  That issue of the DP was canceled

    vs. Germany, and an RA push vs. you.  I don't think he's committed to
    anything other than a topsy-turvy game.
    
    Russia - seems to be conservative and isn't saying much
    
    Italy - seems to be volatile but I hve no idea which way he'll blow
    
    France - neutral, taciturn
    
    England - active talker but seeking only DMZ's at this time
    
    Germany - way over his head, seeking any friendly port
    
    >Looking to the West/Northwest, I imagine?
    
    Not decided yet.  The conservative nature of my neighbors suggests that I
    should do the same (Edi's theatrics notwithstanding).

    Hello again Hohn
    Thanks for the quick and constant communications;much appreciated.
    Let's talk BLA again.  No need to mince words for any perceived =
    "bluntness" as to things being "too easy for me" by being there in =
    Spring.  Quite truthfully, the same could be said for you if I held in =
    Sev and you and Edi were somehow allied:  then I see Gal and/or Rum, =
    Arm, and Bla, putting me in a hurt box. Again, I do *not* expect that, =
    but your concerns are also my concerns.  As such, I make one of two =
    recommendations, and you tell me which you prefer:
    
    S'01 (Rus):  _Sev-Bla,  War-Ukr      (TUR):  Ank-Bla_, Smy-Con
    or
    S'01:  Sev-Rum, Mos-Sev, War-Ukr.    (TUR) Ank-Con, Smy-? hold?
    
    The former makes it cut-and-dry and, while we waste a turn, doesn't cost =
    us too terribly.  It also arouses no suspicions due to its 'normalcy.'   =
    
    
    The second option keeps Bla clear in Spring, and then gives me the =
    option of:  Sev-Rum (Ukr S) (or vice versa), Rum-Bla.  It makes no =
    threat to you for 1901 (or anytime after that, believe me) and we can =
    either pass it thru Turkey, have you build a second fleet and kill it (I =
    go OTB and rebuild an army), or I return it to Sev later (or to RUM, =
    once the armies move inland in 1902.
    
    Which would you prefer, Hohn?  In all seriousness, I don't relish the =
    idea of the fleet 'rotting at the pier' all game.  (I mean, if you think =
    it's useless in RUM and you don't want it in BLA, what exactly will it =
    do, and when will it do it??)
    
    If you're concerned about time, don't be.  I have been trying to entice =
    Italy vs Austria all Winter, but he's looking west (or so he says).  =
    (Don't think I haven't thought of Mun-Boh, War-Gal and ven-Tyo or =
    Tri...but the others aren't as daring.)  If Italy's telling the truth, =
    then Edi is winging it in the East (which is why he's probably selling =
    us both some siren song, to prevent the very alliance that could cripple =
    him.)  So yes, I'm concerned about 'wasted moves,' but spending 1901 =
    prepping for 1902--the same thing everyone else is doing--shouldn't be =
    that difficult.
    
    No further news from E, G or F.  germany seems friendly enough as of =
    last letter, E and F are distant.  I wants friendship but no commitment. =
     A wants alliance vs you and quick action.  And you and I both know what =
    -we- want!
    
    Take care, Hohn, and stay in touch.  Let me hear your ideas, comments, =
    etc.

    I think we need to distinguish Bulgaria from the rest of the Balkans.  Bulgaria
    is my freebie, just as Tunis is yours.
    
    That leaves three Balkans and three Austrian centers.  I similarly think we
    shouldn't count Sevastopol unless we count Marseilles as well.  Austria is one
    enemy, but Russia is another ball of wax.  I know conflict with Russia might be
    inevitable anyway if we're appropriating Rumania into our sphere of influence,
    but that's a problem of mine more than yours, and I'll deal with it as
    necessary.
    
    My counter-proposal is all Balkans to me, army in Greece, all of Austria to you.
    Thoughts?

    Tsar Faz,
    
    It's been a quiet few days, with little in the way of
    negotiations.  I just wanted to touch base with you.
    
    Returning once again to BLA, I'll leave it up to you.  We
    either bounce, or we don't.  I'd rather not waste the turn.
    I don't think the subterfuge is worth the one season loss in
    position, especially if we can get AI to fight for at least
    the first season...which may be possible.  But if you want
    to bounce, I'll bounce.  I definitely want one or the other,
    though, either we both go there or neither of us go there.
    We should each wager an equal amount of trust, as it were.
    While in theory getting you in BLA in Spring 1901 might be a
    marginal tactical benefit, and please pardon my bluntness,
    but it makes things a little too easy for you.  It's not
    hard to be or purport to be a strong ally when there's
    nothing on the line for you, and when you have the upper
    hand.  Just let me know which way you want to go.
    
    No further word from Germany.  Heard from Cal, I'm trying to
    get him to go against Austria.  As always, I'll keep you
    posted.

    Dear Kaiser,
    
    It appears that my mailer messed up.  The stuff before "press to g" was
    sent too.  Well, I hope that in addition to those rather ominous orders,
    you noticed the "set wait."  I did not want those orders to process.  They
    were merely precautionary preliminary orders sent in to hold place while we
    continued discussions.  I usually enter a dozen or so sets of preliminary
    orders during the first week, as a way to think out loud.  In this case,
    your requests for an empty Burgundy made me a tiny bit paranoid, so I did a
    "just in case."  However, I would hope that we continue talking this out
    and settle on a mutually beneficial plan.

    John, yes, it looks that way to me too.  It appears that you forgot to

    Faz,
    
    And this is another distinction we are testing with this demo game.
    I will be "collecting" the broadcast press and printing it in
    bulk in my postal szine; however, there is NO direct way to do
    what you want to do.  The best thing to do is to write your
    "postal style release with the moves press" and save it.  Don't
    send it until you receive the game results.
    
    It is my assertion that the Judge's "rules" hinder good press writing
    and hinder the application of personality to the game.
    
    Your opinions and how well this broadcast press keeps going will tell
    the story.  It is worth noting that the broadcast press so far has
    been two or three orders of magnitude greater than would be usual for
    a demo game OR other regular Judge Dip game.  i can't really say mroe
    right now without biasing you more than I probably already have.
    
    you probably should be aware that the Judgers are a bit surprised
    by different things than you are surprised by.... but equally
    surprised.

    Is there a norm in the flow of correspondence in the E-mail games?  Do most
    communications tend to lump around the beginning of the turn information or is
    it more common for the final day(s) to have a focus of activity?
    
    Is there a database on players and openings as was maintained by the Swedes?
    
    Is there a general record/database anywhere on games done?

    Not really.  I'm still negotiating heavily with Russia about various

    Russia and I are still trying to hammer out particulars with respect to working
    against Austria.  Edi is apparently approaching all comers with various alliance
    proposals.  No clue about the West.  I don't think France is coming after you,
    though, judging from some things he's said.
    
    I'm glad to hear we're on the same page with respect to taking on Austria.  I'll
    let you know if negotiations break down with Russia, but I expect he'll come on
    board, regardless of what particular plan he and I make.  Let me know if there's
    anything in particular that you want me to do.  Of course, if we're allied as I
    believe we are, I'll build no fleets (at least, none on the Med; I suppose it's
    possible that I might need another bordering on BLA, depending on what
    eventually shakes down with the Russian), ever, while you in contrast
    concentrate very heavily on fleets.
    
    Let me know if everything is a go for you, and if my understanding comports with
    your own.  And of course, if you have any other questions, comments or concerns,
    please do not hesitate to inform me.

    I'm afraid I may not have made myself clear.  Of course, if
    either of us were to stab the other, we'd have no alliance.
    When I say "too easy for you," when I'm talking about
    unequal footing, I'm talking about how much trust each of us
    is wagering, _assuming_ we both go through with what we
    propose.  If we both agree to bounce in BLA, and we do,
    we're both implicitly saying that we don't trust each other
    that much (the minor value of subterfuge notwithstanding).
    If we both agree not to go there, we're saying that we both
    trust each other significantly (again, assuming we both in
    fact live up to our side of the bargain).  But if we agree
    to have me move ANK-CON and you move SEV-BLA, I'm wagering a
    lot of trust in you, but you're wagering very little.  Even
    assuming we both go through with what we agree, you're in
    the dominant position.  At that point, I'm _forced_ to rely
    upon your goodwill.  And you can stab in Fall 1901 with me
    being forced to guess whether you will do so or not.  I'd
    rather that not happen.  Therefore, I propose we wager the
    same amount of trust, whether that means bouncing in BLA or
    keeping BLA vacant.  If we choose the latter, obviously, any
    stab will be apparent immediately, and steps can be taken to
    minimize damages.
    
    Is that more clear?

    I think you already know my preference.  If we're going to
    ally, I don't care for half-measures.  I don't like wasting
    the turn.

    I can live with this, although I believe that if we're
    really strongly allied, WAR-GAL, MOS-UKR, SEV HOLDS or
    SEV-RUM is much more powerful against Austria.  And if you
    get into GAL, as is probable in light of Edi's concern about
    Cal, you're in just about as good a position to defend
    against me should I stab you (which I have no intention of
    doing, if we can come to agreement here) as WAR-UKR,
    MOS-SEV, SEV-RUM.  However, if you're not willing to trust
    me that far, I'll deal with it.

    I don't want it in BLA in _Spring_ _1901_.  I've never said
    I have objection to it moving out into the Med later, after
    we've established our trust in each other and our ability to
    work together.  In fact, I've specifically raised the idea:
    
    :I'm glad to see we're in accord.  Regarding BLA, I really
    :would prefer keeping it empty or bouncing.  Having either of
    :us there in 1901 is just too dangerous, regardless of the
    :level of trust between us.  I am perhaps more willing to see
    :your fleet come out to BLA in 1902, however, to help us in
    :our endeavors should we need it.  Once we have established
    :that baseline trust with one year of cooperation under our
    :belts, it will be more palatable.  And it would hopefully
    :lead to bringing your fleet out to the Med.
    
    > If you're concerned about time, don't be.
    
    Sorry, I still am.  I'm such a firm believer that in an RT,
    it's so crucial to get the jump on A/AI.

    Cal's saying something quite different to me.  He wants to
    take out Edi, so he says.  We've discussed potential fears
    of the RT, and he feels confident (again, so he says) that
    he'll be able to reach an accommodation with one of us, or
    that other diplomatic trends of the day will render the
    situation tenable for him.
    
    And yes, Edi's pressing for strong alliance, and I'm feeding
    him what he wants to hear.  The kicker's going to be what
    Cal does, I think.

    Indeed.  Let's come to a decision soon, whether it's
    bouncing or keeping it vacant.

    Hi Hohn
    Ok, Ok, already...I give in.  I'll hold in SEV and see what happens.  If
    you're not moving to ARM and you want to move to CON, have at it.  As
    you said, if you (or I) move to BLA in S'01, I guess we'll see it for
    the obvious stab.  _I_ do not intend to do so now, and I'm banking on
    your (oft-repeated) assurances, also.
    
    You say Italy is attacking Aus, eh?  Let's just say that I'll believe it
    when I see it.  My reading of the tea leaves--based on some last-minute
    correspondence-- is that A/I are in bed together, and that the *last*
    thing Italy wants is to join you (and I) in an Austrian carve-up.  After
    all, if we're allied and Austria dies, who next feels the Turk's
    scimitar?  This is another reason I finally agreed to joint R/T ops and
    moves for spring.
    
    My tenacious (probably "ridiculous", in your eyes) arguing over this
    whole BLA thing was based not only on my fear of balance-of-power
    attacks on me once we become 'obvious.'  It was also based on game
    interaction.   Edi often refers to you and he in glowing terms from
    games past.  And while I do *not* fear cross-gaming, it is a tad
    disconcerting to be the "unknown" among the pack of good old boys who
    have crossed swords in games past.  Your first letters, coming on the
    heels of Edi's, just left me uneasy.  It wasn't 'you,' or your 'style,'
    or anything like that--mostly just me, some hidden paranoia, and the
    feeling that A/T would link up and wax me early on.
    
    But, as you said, it does come down to trust, and measurable trust at
    that. "Measurable" means "calculated," in your lexicon.  I'm going a
    step beyond, and will adhere to a less-than-desired opening for me (SEV
    holds) in the hope that you see my sincerity, and that we truly can get
    this "jump on A/I" that you've been chomping at the bit for.
    
    So, then, "partner," the childbirth was indeed painful.  But now that we
    have a team, let's see what damage we can do.
    
    I'll look for you in CON, and you can look for me in SEV.  Fair enough?

    Hi Cal
    Just a quick note--have been under hot-and-heavy bombardment from
    Turkey.  Wants me to NOT bounce in Bla, but instead to nail Edi.   Says
    he's talked to you and that's also what you want (?), and that you feel
    confortable in the face of any R/T ???
    
    I'm naturally paraphrasing here, and I don't mean to put words in your
    mouth by misinterpreting Hohn's version of things.  But I want to
    reassure myself that this high-falutin' E/I/A/R is a 'go' against F and
    T, and that you're also in this.
    
    The reason (naturally) is because you and I have the ability to crunch
    Edi AND contain Hohn (in that order) if you're serious about pummeling
    Austria.  If you fear Turkey, or the R/T (I don't want one this game,
    btw) and you still want the 'agreed-upon' four-way opening, that's fine
    by me.  I just wanted to know if there was anything new that you and I
    needed to adjust for...If not, disregard this note, and we'll see you in
    MAR.

    Not that I can recall.  I think I might have expressed
    objection to such a move in the first turn due to the need
    to establish sufficient trust first, but I've always
    supported the general idea.

    > Bla and you to Con),  does that really force you to rely on my goodwill?
    
    Of course.  I've said it many times already, I either want
    us to agree that either both of us or neither of us will go
    to BLA in Spring 1901.  That's the crucial turn.  If we both
    agree to move there, fine.  No big deal..  It's not my first
    preference, but I can live with it.  If we agree not to move
    there, then any move by either of us there in Spring 1901
    will signal an obvious stab, and that can set the tenor of
    the relationship for the foreseeable future.  I want that
    big, honking, obvious "stab indicator" if we decide not to
    move to BLA purely because I want to make sure the
    ramifications of that decision to stab, the potential
    consequences of that stab, are self-evident.  It will serve
    to _deter_ a stab.
    
    That doesn't exist under your proposal of SEV-BLA, ANK-CON.
    Which is why I can't support it.  I won't know what you'll
    do in such a situation until it is (potentially) too late.
    
    >  First off, there's either trust, or there's not.
    
    It's one thing to trust without basis.  It's another to
    trust wisely.  And another thing entirely to trust after at
    least one turn of demonstrated goodwill.
    
    > Secondly, the fleet
    > would be used to get Ukr into RUM, not go mucking about vs Bul or Arm.
    
    How do I know that?  And you can just as easily get UKR into
    RUM by having SEV support it there.
    
    And before you counter, "Well, you might stab by moving to
    BLA," the clear response is: so might you.  We're both
    risking the same amount.  And the ramifications will be
    obvious after Spring 1901.

    I've clearly said that I have no intention of moving to ARM.
    That remains true.  Obviously, if we're allied, I have no
    business in ARM.
    
    I haven't decided whether to hold it or move it to ANK.
    There are pros and cons.  And despite your assertion of
    cementing my flank, your presence in BLA would still cause
    me serious potential problems if you were to stab.  And I'm
    not saying you will; I'm merely posing that if we agree to
    keep it neutral, we both are wagering decent risk, and the
    resulting increase in trust should we pull things off
    without stabbing, as I suspect we can, would be
    correspondingly great.
    
    > I guess a lot of what I do with Sev is dependent on what you do with

    It certainly seems so, regrettably.
    
    > If
    > Smy stays out of Arm, I'd be heavily inclined to do the Bla DMZ thing.
    
    I thought that went without saying.  Of course I'm not going
    to go to ARM.

    Mark, I have to confess my stamina's about done here.  I
    recognize your concerns, and although I disagree with them,
    although I think bouncing in BLA is a waste and that it
    demonstrates less trust in each other than I would prefer
    for a strong RT, let's go ahead and bounce.  It clearly
    seems to be what you prefer, and I'm not so obsessed with
    moving out to AEG quickly that it will cause me to ignore
    the warning signals I seem to be getting from you.
    
    Bouncing in BLA is an option.  Rolling the dice and agreeing
    that neither of us will enter BLA is an option.  I will not
    agree to your preapproved presence in BLA while I move to
    CON, however.
    
    I'll assume we're bouncing in BLA unless you tell me
    otherwise.  We should still have enough time to have one
    final round of talks before the deadline, should you so
    desire.  Let me know.

    *Sev transiting Bla.  Yes, you did mention it in notes past.  You also,
    if I recall, came out pretty strongly against its transiting through in
    one other note...But your achieved example at the end of this note sums

    *The BLA issue.   If we both do what we intended to do (i.e., I went to
    Bla and you to Con),  does that really force you to rely on my goodwill?
     First off, there's either trust, or there's not.  Secondly, the fleet
    would be used to get Ukr into RUM, not go mucking about vs Bul or Arm.
    As for stab potential, sure, I guess there is potential.  But while
    we're on the point about "wagering a lot of trust," there is a
    reciprocal question:  where is Smy in all of this?  Are you moving it to
    Arm?  or Ank?  or holding?  Smy-Ank and Ank-Con cements your flank
    against any perceived (non-existent!) Russian stab.
    
    I guess a lot of what I do with Sev is dependent on what you do with
    Smy; the trust factor for us both may not quite be where it should.  If
    Smy stays out of Arm, I'd be heavily inclined to do the Bla DMZ thing.
    
    *Red Flags to Bulls.  Let's ignore the perceived 'minor value' in a
    bounce.  My other main concern deals with bringing down a curtain of
    fire on us by the immediate signals the S'01 turn would show.  An Italy

     Doubtful.  Ger and Eng sitting by while we pummel Austria and I
    potentially build on their borders (why do it down south)?   Again,
    doubtful.  My only point about buying time with a turn of bounce was to
    keep *me* from feeling the heat from three potential fronts (A/G/E) the
    minute Edi cries "wolf" and gets aid from the Balance-of-Power freaks on
    the board.
    Is one extra turn of jumping-off worth the expected firestorm?  That's a
    judgment call we seem to disagree on.
    
    *Italy.  I expect Cal to head west as part of an agreement with Aus, and

    Hi Hohn
    Thanks for the speedy reply; I appreciate your understanding through all
    of this.
    
    I hope against hope that Italy does indeed "join us" against Edi.  I'm
    generally an optimist as regards making things happen, but I sense
    unease as regards A/I infighting.  Hopefully you've got better info from
    Italy than I do.  He just sent me an e-mail and categorically denies
    doing anything other than making "the approprate noises" toward Turkey.
    Again, I hope that's just domestic propaganda, and that he opens
    eastward; sure would be nice!
    
    Take care, and let's see what autumn brings!

    Hi Cal
    OK, I'm reassured!  I've been getting hot and heavy notes from Hohn,
    basically saying that Italy is "with" Turkey in the attack on Austria,
    and that I (Russia) and the foot-dragging scumbag for not wanting to
    agree to his terms and help crush Austria with "better" opening
    moves....Be that as it may, I think we'll be all right in the attack.
    Key for us, however, is:  where does Edi expand after he gets Ser and
    Gre?   Does he channel himself toward BUL and Aeg?  I just have this
    (natural) paranoia that A/T are in cahoots regarding lil' ol' me.  Oh
    well, as long as you're around to help prevent that from happening, then
    consider me still firm to the 4-way opening.
    
    Here's to you and me, pilgrim.  Let's hope Edi's plan is beneficial to
    us all....

    These arrangements are quite reasonable and exactly what we discussed.
    As for the alleged A/I, I have been talking to Edi and sending out the
    usual S'01 happy-talk to give him warm fuzzies; he may have also talked
    about this to some others about this.  Actually, I have distributed a
    few "red herrings" to some of the western powers.  I don't like to
    broadcast my exact plans to those on the other side of the board. Given
    the tendency of some games to come down to the eastern "winners" against
    the western "winners", a little confusion early can't hurt.  But then I
    don't have to tell you not to believe all the Dip gossip, no? :)

    Yup, I'm fine with it, but I do have a question: I'm starting to hear
    rumours of a western triple with France going all out for the Med in
    '01.  Needless to say, this worries me and I'm wondering if you'ev heard
    anything about it?

    Mark,
    
    OK, all sounds good.  I understand and appreciate the
    compromise you've made, and I won't let you down.  I have
    every confidence that after this season, we'll be the
    strongest of allies, an alliance made stronger by our mutual
    and demonstrated trust.
    
    Regarding the old boy network, don't sweat it.  Edi and I
    have enjoyed our few games together, but I doubt he will,
    and I certainly won't, let that prejudice our judgments.
    
    I'm currently making a full-court diplomatic press on Cal,
    to convince him to do what he told me he'd do, namely attack
    Austria.  FYI.
    
    Onward to Autumn, and Austria!

    Cal,
    
    Just checking in regarding the Austrian front.  I've sealed an agreement with
    Russia for the time being so that the three of us can slice and dice to our
    heart's content.
    
    I've heard conflicting reports, though, in that others have said you're pretty
    strongly allied with Austria.  I suspect that's just your effective diplomacy
    camouflaging the real intent, but if it's not, I must confess a bit of
    confusion.  The primary reason I've decided to work with Russia right now was
    because of your offer to carve Austria.  Clearly, if there really is an AI, I
    would think it would be in your better interest to sow dissension between
    Russia and me, which you haven't done.  Are you sure you're still OK with our
    agreement?  I hope you know I'm sincere when I say that of most of the RT's
    I've seen, R gets the lion's share of the success, and that that concerns me.
    And again, I'll build no fleets except in Ankara when I'm ready to go.  There
    will never be more than one Turkish fleet in the Med, in AEG, and that will be
    strictly defensive, as I'm sure you know the importance that province plays in
    my defense.  Finally, there will be an army in GRE, never a fleet.
    
    That's my understanding of our agreement.  Please confirm if that's your
    understanding as well, and if you're still OK with it.
    
    Looking forward to the look on Edi's face after Spring 1901, I remain
    Your Ally,
    Hohn

    Sounds familiar.  He's offered me, Mark, and Cal strong alliances.  I'm
    wondering whether that will backfire.  I'm being careful with Edi, as
    always.  What IR do will of course set the tenor of the situation.  I'm a
    bit further removed from the front with respect to Austria than IR.
    
    > Russia - seems to be conservative and isn't saying much
    
    I get the same impression.  I don't think he's going to banzai against me
    (tough for Russia to do in any event), but I'm uncertain to what extent
    he'd commit to working with me.  As always, Spring 1901 will be very
    telling.  For many parties involved on the board.
    
    > Italy - seems to be volatile but I hve no idea which way he'll blow
    
    Multiple sources suspect West.  Which could be helpful for you.  See below.
    
    > France - neutral, taciturn
    > England - active talker but seeking only DMZ's at this time
    > Germany - way over his head, seeking any friendly port
    
    Regrettably, I must report to you that my current read is an EF.  Of
    course, it could be based on BS info, but I thought you might want to know.
    If it's any consolation, I don't think you'll be attacked by Russia or
    Austria.  Or me. :)

    Makes sense.  I think several people are wanting to make sure they don't
    have the ignominy of being first one out!  Thus the conservatism.
    
    Good luck on your openers.  Let me know if you hear of any dire
    anti-Turkish conspiracies.

    Then be re-assured! :)  I'm still on board for the e/i/a/r.  I just have
    to make the obligatory happy-noises to Hohn, no?

    I agree that crunching first Edi and then Hohn makes good sense, but I
    still think it should be the other way around.  My reasoning is that if
    Turkey is given a couple of years to expand as well as a couple of
    centres to do it with, he will be MUCH harder to take out quickly than
    Austria.  Also, if we attack Turkey second, we're very out of position
    to then move back west.  Going after Austria second makes more sense
    because his defensive position isn't as strong - we can take him out and
    be in position to step across the stalemate line.
    
    As for anything new, nope, the original "Operation du Edi" is still a
    go.

    I wouldn't say it's impossible although I don't believe it.  As far as I
    know Edi, he is known for the kind of bold opening he has suggested.  I
    think he's playing it straight with us and is counting on the fact that,
    once Hohn is gone, you'll be so involved in the German invasion and me
    with France that he'll be able to pick which of us he wants to attack.
    Actually, my biggest fear is that he'll be right.  Even though we're
    forewarned, we have to remember what he has in mind.  I suspect we'll
    probably have to count on turning on HIM one turn before he turns on
    you/me.

    Hohn,
    Have been re-looking the board.  (No, I'm *not* reneging on my pledge to =
    stay out of Black, rest assured)!  Still, I'm going to be 100% up-front =
    with you--as a partner should--and say that I'm at least considering =
    Sev-Rum in spring.
    
    We discussed this earlier, and while I know you're not crazy about it, =
    you did say you could live with move if I did it.  Because I don't know =
    Austria's intentions, I don't think it would hurt for me to consider =
    sailing there in spring.  I can always move an army there in fall =
    (supported, perhaps, by BUL) and get the fleet back into BLA or SEV =
    after we've lined up our quarry.  After all, I can't get an army in =
    there until fall, regardless of what Sev does in spring. =20
    
    The extra advantage of it being there in Spring is to spoof Austria.  =
    The move seems benign, and--depending how he moves--I may able to argue =
    the case for him trying to go for Bul ("supported" by my F Rum, ha ha) =
    and just have him try for GRE with F Alb alone (if that's what he's =
    doing).  If that happens, you can bounce him in Gre and have him only go =
    +1 in fall!  =20
    
    Naturally, it would help if I knew what he was really doing, because =
    right now this is all hypothesizing on my part.  And quite honestly, I'm =
    not even sure I **want** to sail to Rum (it is an awkward placement).   =
    But if I do it, I did _NOT_ want it to be a surprise to you, or to have =
    you think I was pulling a fast one.  If I have an ally, I don't play =
    monkey business with him. =20
    
    The bottom line:  our team stands firm, nothing sails to Black, and =
    quite possibly nothing goes to Rum, either.  Just wanted to give you a =
    courtesy heads-up, should I get an 11th-hour urge to sail to an SC.  Ok?
    
    Take care.  Any more from Aus or Ita?  You mentioned Italy's previous =
    discussions...what has Edi been feeding you? I'd be curious to hear...

    Jim
    Here's a revision of earlier notes as regards my Winter 1900 game
    thoughts...You can incorporate with the 'still-valid' stuff in my
    earlier note, if you care to.
    
    Russia (Faz) / W'00, S'01
    
    Well, the die  is cast.  As much as Turkey offered a rational plan for
    world conquest, I've decided to stick with the Birsan Quadripartite
    Plan, offered up for the beginning years.  This plan involves an A/R
    attack on Turkey, an Italian westward blitz vs France, and England
    joining in from the North.  Under Edi's grand plan, we then spend 1902
    or early 1903 building along Germany's borders, for a three-player
    (E/A/R) "sub-blitz" of Pitt after he's committed in France.  If Edi's
    intent comes true (Tri-Tyo, Vie-Boh), we should cause some jaws to drop
    among the Observers.
    
    Many questions remain, naturally:  How quick will T or F fall (if they
    do at all)?  Will one of the Quadripartite derect and stab, perhaps even
    joining a beseiged nation?  For me--having never played with any of
    these guys--their legend has reached nerve-wracking proportions.  I have
    visions of double-crosses planned against me, etc.  Guess you never know
    until you take the plunge.
    
    For me, it's a significant plunge:  long a proponent of R/T alliances, I
    am in essence passing one up just to risk it all with a structure that
    may not be the best for me in the long-run.  Of course, I don't intend
    it to last for long.  Once Turkey is reduced, Italy and I "supposedly"
    have an understanding with England that we'll try and strangle Edi,
    before the baby (monster) grows out of the crib.  If Hohn is a
    balance-of-power player, he may relish the thought of revenge on Edi
    (and possible resurgence vs me, the other Stan), long enough for me to
    level them both...with help.
    
    Key for me is the quick gain of BLA.  Edi expects me to bounce there,
    although Turkey and I spent several agonizing letters in declaring a
    DMZ.  Hohn wants me to hold in SEV, move to GAL and UKR, and then take
    RUM in the fall, while forcing Edi to go for Gre with only one (which
    Hohn bounces) or else ensure GRE and risk BUD/VIE.  In doing so, he
    intends (or says he intends) to move Ank-Con.  If this is true, then (1)
    I'll gain BLA this spring and (2) I'll earn Hohn's undying hatred for a
    bald-faced lie.
    
    Everyone's been pretty good about communication:  A, E and T on the high
    end of the spectru, I and G in the mid-range,  F on the low end.  But
    all have written and all have plans.  I expect an upsurge in letters as
    F'01 approaches.   If I end up this turn in Ukr, Bla and Sev, then F'01
    will see me asking Edi to move Ser-Bul (tying down F Con), Alb-Gre,
    while I use the two armies to bull into RUM (or perhaps go to Arm).
    The will is there, but we'll see what finally transpires.

    Gentle King J,
    Many thanks for the recent missive.  Just a short reply, as I'm off to
    teach in 10 minutes (yawn).
    I think we're in full agreement on my of life's travails this game.  Any
    notes you can send to the Doge to ensure the three of us are "in synch"
    with Birsan-some worries would be appreciated; Lord knows I've sent my
    share as of late...
    
    I agree that long-term game plans aren't in the cards right now, i.e.,
    "what will be doing in the Final Alliance come 190x?"  I just raised the
    hypotehticals because of the priority in handling T, then A, then the
    "logical" follow-ons from there.  Heck, I may be dead by 1903 or
    something, rendering it all moot  (bite my tongue)!
    
    Indeed, let us sleep on it, as the moves will be made known in less than
    17 hours, and then we can renew the diplomatic process.  I see, to quote
    the U-boat crews of 1941, "The Happy Times" for E/R.
    
    Yours for peace (and pieces)

    Hi Edi
    Thanks for the reminder about differentiating between mail I send to
    "you" (usually via reply to your home address) and mail I send via the
    judge.  It's easy for me to just hit 'return' and forget it all.
    
    We're locked and cocked for the opening moves.  And while there's always
    the chance you and Hohn are really in cahoots to make my life miserable,
    I think not.  I've made plans to move as we agreed, and if things go
    well down south, you and I should have a couple options on what's
    possible in fall.  I judge from Hohn's press and his e-mail that he is
    indeed "a good guy" (I think we all are), and I feel bad not linking up
    with him...but hey, if everyone's a good guy, somebody has to be on the
    receiving end--nature of the game.
    
    We're good to go, my friend.  Will write again soon!

    Doge and Tsar,
    
    This is to register (what I am guessing is) our mutual back-of-the-mind
    awareness of the keen potential danger lurking above the Balkans. We shall
    not underestimate the threat. When the Time comes, your English cousin will
    be patient and understand the need to sit idly by and not to interfere; the
    dirty business will belong to the two of you. No doubt I will have other
    matters to occupy my navy; whatever the situation I intend to give comfort
    and the necessary breathing space for you to contain the menace. Assuming,
    always, that I am still then breathing myself!
    
    Just so it's out on the table. I know we're all thinking about it from time
    to time. Or anyway I suspect so.
    
    In the meantime, to horse (or sail, as the case may be)! Saddle up, batten

    did you intend to broadcast that last note?

    infant Birsan creature comes of age. Looking ahead without looking forward
    to it, I dare say. There won't be much directly for me to do about it, but
    indirectly I can help by just leaving the two of you alone. Let's for now
    just recognize, all three of us, that I am aware of that pregnant
    situation. I think I'll make a note of it to the Doge, in fact.

    Ah.
    The common convention is flanking asterisks (called 'stars' by the
    congenitally neologistic computer scientist) in lieu of the emphatic
    italic, thus:
    
    	I thought you said a *fleet* in Nwy, you bastard.
    
    The italics of titles are usually ascii-fied by flanking underscores, thus:
    
    	Are you not familiar with _The Gamers Guide_, you nitwit?

    Let's leave it to the board, partly. The worry I have about that particular
    plan is that it leaves Germany uncomfortably unoccupied at a crucial
    moment. To wit: supposing that A/R vs. T ends in happy victory
    contemporaneously with All Neighbors vs. France, your next projected step
    leaves me alone against Germany.
    
    But I expect we'll come up with something as the day approaches. Even a
    single fleet Baltic (a White one, I mean) to help me along would probably
    be enough to tip the scales, if I plan properly.

    Hmmmm.
    I think that 'SEV' is meant to be a 'BLA' ('is he telling Turkey to also go
    *there*', emphasis mine).
    
    My own feeling would be, if you do manage to get A Mos-Sev right off, so
    much the better, we'll just delay the assault of Germany a season or a
    year. You'd then be apt to get a larger bite of Turkey than you could
    otherwise expect; something you must be thinking about in any case
    (Austrian armies in Asia, oh my!). And I would get the benefit of an extra
    German move or two contra-France, which I figure will be a great and needed
    help.
    
    What I especially like about the Gran Plan is that an Austrian attack on
    Germany (should it ever materialize!) solves many difficulties for me. It
    is *such* a dastardly act that it may have the unsurpassably desirable
    effect of pushing Germany into a monomania of revenge. Sure, E vs. G, F vs.
    G, even R vs. G, these things happen despite the smiliest of diplomatic
    chat before. But A vs. G! The Germans must punish that transgression.
    Here's hoping.

    You're right, just two seasons could not even begin any reduction at all.
    Two years might. But enough reduction to make it safe to begin a new
    ambitious project? That will be an interesting question.
    
    
    Well then, we sleep tonight content enough with the idea that when Good
    Allies are in hand, Good Tactics and Good Timing are a luxury; if allies
    prove false then let our every trickery be loosed upon 'em!

    Good King Jamie
    As we're in the "Ghod's(too) truth" mode right now, let me also spill
    some guts...
    
    1) I am indeed ingesting much salt with Turkey right now.  he has been
    bombarding me doe four days to (a) not bounce in Bla, and (b) have me
    invade GAL while he hits CON and then GRE.  If the truth be known, Your
    Highness, I would have done so for the greater (initial) gains that come
    from a R/T alliance, "IF" Italy would have been amenable.  Like
    Churchill's observation about the Bolsheviks, I would prefer to
    'strangle the infant Birsan creature in its crib," vice letting it grow
    to possibly unmanageable proportions.  But I can't pass up a unique
    Quadripartite opening, and Italy DOES say he'll assist me Edi gets
    uppity.
    
    So what am I saying?  Don't expect any R/T.
    
    2) Germany offers fealty and kinship, but no real insights.  He
    intimates that he is pro-Eng in leaning, and I tend to believe him.
    
    3)  The "fleet" in quotes was my last paranoid 'subtle hint' to ensure
    life was copasetic up north with us.  (I love to use italics, bold and
    underline in letters and 'real' e-mail, and this *&^%$ format doesn't
    work that way...so I'm left with quotes as a viz-aid.)  Reassurance
    established, and thank you!   To give you any extra 'warm fuzzies,'
    don't expect any evil Russian things up north.  If this thing goes off
    as I envision (ha ha ha), I see:  A/R vs T, then R/I vs A, and finally
    R/E vs G,  after which we kill each other, ooops, I mean, after which we
    live in peace.  Sound ok?
    
    4) The above references your general intent and/or question at the end.
    Yes, I see Italy as a loyal bud and essential counterweight to Austria.
    Quite franklly, I/Rs have less potential friction in the long-term, just
    due top geography and diffused enemies.  But I generally play E/Rs or
    R/Gs as the preferred way up north.
    
    5) I still am uneasy about how exactly we attack Germany, as mentioned
    last letter.  I'm glad to see you also have questions.  For example, Edi
    expects me to bounce in SEV this turn (is he telling Turkey to also go
    there, to "prove the move?") and then go Mos-Liv in fall.  S'02 then
    sees me build A War-Sil and Liv-Pru, while he does two armies to Tyo and
    Boh, and then feast begins.  But what happens if I GET to Sev?  Or if
    Edi doesn't get two, or some other intangible?  I see the overall big
    picture, and am reasonably comfortable with it.   But how long will it
    take to reduce France and Turkey?  A lot longer than two seasons, I'd
    wager!
    Well, as long as you and I are in cahoots, I feel secure.  I j-u-s-t
    don't trust A/T, singly or in tandem.
    
    Here's to a few good English broadsides, too!  May you best all comers,
    my Liege.

    Yes, again, I was remiss.  In response to your question, of course it is in
    our interests for Germany to go east.  Unfortunately, I have not heard a
    word from anyone to indicate that he intends to do so.  I had an exchange
    with Austria on this, and he has yet to respond.  I have yet to hear from
    Italy.  I fear for France.

    Our Cousin Tsar,
    
    Ghods' Truth, I have heard some small talk about Turkey intending to bounce
    you in Black Sea. But it's grapevine stuff, just the sort of thing he would
    tell Party X, or the sort of thing Party X would tell me even without
    strictly speaking having heard it from Turkey, or third hand rumor, or the
    like. Grain of salt, please.
    
    Germany is a quiet sort. (In this game, not Pitt in general. He must be
    busy.) My sources inform me that he intercepted a scandalous note from the
    French, wherein hideously anti-German orders were revealed, and that the
    ensuing rift is likely to be favorable to me (and to you, for that matter).
    But this affects our plans not a whit.
    
    > and you and
    >I should be ok up north--you with a "fleet" in Nwy(?)
    
    Yes, in Nwy a "fleet", whatever that is. None of my units has any quotation
    marks that I have noticed! You may stop worrying about Norway now.
    
    
    
    >Per Edi's big plan, you and I then magically
    >work evil ju-ju against Germany, although the timing still has me a bit
    >puzzled.
    
    It's concerned me, too, the very same issue. Don't forget that Edi says
    he'll add his own ju-ju, presumably Tyo-Mun or something equally sneaky.
    But there's that nagging timing problem.
    
    But matters of timing are going to be very sensitive to luck and guesswork
    in the very early stages; France could take awfully long to invade
    successfully even with Italian navies raking the southern shores, or she
    could fall like the proverbial ripe fig with just a lucky guess or two by
    me or Germany. And similarly Turkey could be a hard nut, or might guess
    badly and offer relatively little resistance. So we can't think too much
    about exact timing, not yet.
    
    I think that as in so many things thus far, we see abstract issues in a
    similar way. To speak plainly, I expect I will regard your noble self as my
    chief ally, and the Italians next, and that I'll be thinking of Archduke
    Edi as a distant friendly face whose helpful acts I'll hope for but never
    count on. *ASSUMING* that my French project goes well, I will count on
    perfect and perpetual peace in Scandinavia, and assess my other options
    with a vaguely open mind. And I shall sincerely hope that your attitude
    will be likewise. I hope that we can convince Doge Cal to keep his mind
    open (if not his borders).
    
    Enough of the misty future. The best of luck in your opening salvos,

    No problem.  I wouldn't have bothered had I not thought that
    the two of us working together was eminently worth it.  And
    the cornerstones of any good alliance are communication and
    trust.

    Here's my take.  Cal's been talking to me from the beginning
    about working against Edi.  He's even been in favor of us
    all _three_ working against Edi.  The thing that turns the
    trick for me is, "Why would he say that to me if it weren't
    true?"  If he were really allied with Edi, wouldn't he be
    trying to get me to go after you?  Wouldn't it be in his
    best interests to try to sow discord between the two of us?
    Especially when I told him that one of the factors that made
    me decide to go against Edi was his own assurance that he
    would do so, and that he was all right with the RT?
    
    We'll see.  I remain confident that Cal will go with us.
    Why else would he approve the RT?  Surely not to have RT
    just bump heads against AI.  At least, I don't think so.  It
    doesn't make sense to me.

    Thanks for your candor and openness.

    I suppose my question is, "Who cares what Austria's
    intentions are?"  We're going to be going against him
    regardless.
    
    > I can always move an army there in fall
    > (supported, perhaps, by BUL) and get the fleet back into
    > BLA or SEV = after we've lined up our quarry.
    
    The problem is, being forced to move SEV removes your
    ability to _support_ the army move into RUM with the fleet.
    That means that either I have to let Edi have GRE unopposed,
    or that if you make it into GAL, you'll have to use that to
    support rather than make a stab for a center.
    
    > After all,
    > I can't get an army in = there until fall, regardless of

    But if SEV stays put, we have more flexibility with respect
    to Fall 1901 moves into RUM.

    I think the utility of fooling Edi here is questionable.
    For one, he'll probably act in his best interests and use
    SER to support himself in one of his own moves, rather than
    support an alleged one of yours which might not go.
    
    Also, as mentioned above, I do think Cal will go with us.
    If so, fooling Edi becomes pointless; he'll die like a dog
    anyway.

    Use your discretion, but I strongly feel that SEV-RUM puts
    us in worse tactical position, for the reasons mentioned
    above.

    OK, but I really think it's a bad move.
    
    Look, if it makes you less likely to move SEV-RUM, let me
    assure you:
    
    I'm _NOT_ going to attack you.  I swear by everything holy
    that I won't.  My moves to BUL, CON, and ANK are already in.
    We're set, and I hope you believe me, and that you too see
    the benefit in our alliance.
    
    > Take care.  Any more from Aus or Ita?  You mentioned

    attack Edi.

    My friend, I am surprised at the lack of correspondence from you.  I had
    thought our discussions were going quite well.  I hope nothing is amiss.
    
    I can inform you of this, which may be relevant to your situation.
    Somehow, Germany received a message from me that showed my password and my
    preliminary orders.  My orders were hostile to Germany.  I told him -
    truthfully - that I frequently change orders before the first turn.  I kind
    of think out loud by entering prelim orders.  But he's stopped writing me,
    so I have to expect the worst.

    I've heard nothing of the kind, actually.  I _have_ heard that an EF is out to

    it's a helluva lot better than EFG.  I'll bet that if the rumors are true,

    Gentle KJ
    All's quiet on the Eastern front.  Indeed, I'm heading southward,
    although Mos may not make it very far if Sev gets bounced.   Wish me
    luck.
    
    Turkey has been hot and heavy to get me to ally, and has plans to bump
    off Austria.   However, with you and Italy also involved in the
    Quadripartite Plan, I prefer to give the anti-T, anti-F coalition the
    benefit of the doubt.
    
    Germany remains quiet, Italy has pledged westerly movement, and you and
    I should be ok up north--you with a "fleet" in Nwy(?) and me with a
    fleet in Swe (eventually).  Per Edi's big plan, you and I then magically
    work evil ju-ju against Germany, although the timing still has me a bit
    puzzled.   But we'll burn that bridge when we come to it!

    Germany on board for an early French invasion. Of course, we might see

    Hearty greetings! I am most surprised that we have not yet communicated.
    As for me, the reason has been that I have no plans to interfere in your

    My friend, I have lately realized that we have yet to discuss specific
    arrangements to achieve our mutual aims.  I believe you mentioned in a
    previous message an understanding to stay out of one another's coastal
    waters.  I am in most complete agreement with this notion.   Can we

    Boy, that's really weird.  He never mentioned it to me.  I suppose it's
    possible that he forgot, in light of the fact that we were discussing other
    matters almost exclusively.

    Sounds correct to me.  I really don't think that there's an EFG, though.
    Pitt's too savvy for that.  Pitt also indicated that he was going to open
    "conservatively," whatever that means.  I don't think an EFG opening can be
    considered "conservative," though!

    Cal, oh Noble Doge
    I'll be happy to pass along said 'misdirection" to the Turk, but please =

    Turkey and I have argued round and round about DMZs in Black Sea, as =
    well as the utility of the Russian fleet going to RUM.  I have rebelled =
    against his wishes for an "alliance" involving F Sev-h, despite my =

    fleet and SEV with the army, he may interpret that as a severe breach of =
    faith, and take *any* other news I send with an...ahem...rather large =

    worth much to him.
    
    Now, what YOU could do (cackle), after the moves come out =
    tonight/tomorrow a.m., is perhaps communicate with the Turk and say that =
    you're sure "Faz made what he thought was a better alliance move, to =
    smokescreen any R/T collusion and to prevent E and G from seeing the red =
    flags in front of the bulls."  Or something like that.  I have a =
    sneaking suspicion that Turkey will not be happy with me (he seems =
    excessively paranoid, for someone who's won games with Edi before), but =
    maybe if we both try and assuage his fear (and anger), we'll get another =
    turn or two of the Triple Whammy vs him.  What say you?  Ideas?  =
    Comments?  Advice?

    Hi Mark!  Just wanted to clue you in to some stuff I'm telling Hohn.
    
    I want to have an excuse/escape clause with Turkey when I DON'T attack
    Edi like I've promised him.  I told Hohn that I heard from YOU about a
    possible Western Triple and that I'm worried about it.  This will be my
    excuse when I open westward in case anything goes wrong (f tri-ven; a
    vie-tyo, etc) (OK, so I'm paranoid... I live longer that way...grin)
    
    If Hohn asks you for confirmation, just tell him that you picked up
    something in a letter from one of E/F/G that got you wondering and you
    passed your speculations on to me.
    
    Cool?

    I'm confused...  We HAVE talked before.  Admittedly it was only one
    letter each way, but I'm sure we discussed neutralizing the Med and it
    was fine with both of us.  Either way, I'm sure we need not fear each
    other, certainly not at the start of the game.

    I'm surprised you hadn't heard about it.  I got the rumour from Mark and

    sent him.  I want to feel him out as to his intentions.  I didn't
    exactly ask him about a EFG triple, but I asked a couple of leading
    questions that hopefully will give me an idea what's going on.  We'll
    see.  Even if there IS a western triple, I'd most likely go ahead with

    Don't give up hope.  The German F Den indicates distrust of both myself
    and the English.  And I think Pitt can be convinced (from a
    balance-of-power perspective) that it's in his best interests NOT to see
    you succumb rapidly to an E/I pincer.  I would use that approach with
    him--and I'll try and do the same myself in my dealings with him.
    
    if, as I suspect, there's an A/I, then I don't want to see them get
    strong at your--and ultimately, my--expense!

    Jamie, if you are serious about wanting to ally with me, we do have one
    very strong move:
    f ech c a wal - bel, f nth - nwy; f mao-por, a mar - spa, a bur - mar.
    
    I'd pick up two builds, as would you.  The balance of power between GI and
    FE would look pretty good for us.  GI would be vulnerable to threats from
    the east and would face a formidable force to the west.
    
    Since this is my only hope, I've already entered the orders.  They won't
    change, unless you have a better idea for FE cooperation.  It's up to you.

    I wish I were so clever.  No, I have been preoccupied and thus did not pay
    close attention to the game.  You see the result.
    
    Of course I would like to patch things up.  But as things stand, perhaps
    you would do better to grab as much of my country as possible.  The only
    problem with that is that, due to Italy's attack, England will be a likely
    next victim of a GI alliance.  When the central powers get together, the
    corners cannot quarrel, I think.
    
    In any event, I am at your mercy.  If you would like to have a willing
    vassal, I'm your man.

    King James
    Yeah, things went reasonably well.  I, like you, would've preferred
    Germany in HOL, not DEN, with the fleet.  I mean, he tells me, "Swe is
    yours, Faz, don't worry," but it now muddies the waters a little, having
    him there.  If he bounces me, it will be because he either (a) sees an
    A/T and wants me "not too" powerful, or (b) Edi will tell him info to
    make him bounce me, and thus ensure Aus is the big dog down south.
    Edi's the one who's knowledgable of all these guys' psyches, and says
    Pitt is a balance-of-power player.  If he sees an imbalance in A/T (or
    peace among ... certain powers ... then he may act to preclude you  (or
    me) of SCs.  Hopefully it was just a CYA move, him being unsure of
    either you or I.  And hopefully he'll 'come around" this turn.  He did,
    after all, head to BUR in spring...
    
    Austria's Move.  The move was exactly as Edi told me he'd do.  I think
    he also did a CYA, as the move protected him from any Italian stab, as
    well as giving armies to cover Vie + Bud in the event I went to GAL.
    *Hopefully* he told Italy he was making that move, so as to ensure peace
    and tranquility.  Will Italy now go to Ven?  Depends on Cal's nerves
    (and balls).  Edi has asked that he go to Tus-TUN, and personally, I
    still see that happening.
    
    For you and I:  I think this move hasn't caused any reevaluations in our
    joint course of action.  By that I mean, nothing that we should change
    vis a vis Germany or the Quadripartite.  If I get bounced in Swe, I
    might be a little more inclined to support Edi into Boh and Tyo and a
    "1902" German option.  Or I might just swallow my pride, and then team
    up with you to take the place in 1902.
    
    In fact, let me ask the question:  if Germany bounces me in Swe, that
    means you'll get Nwy.  And while he could go Kie-Den, den-Swe, it's
    doubtful he'll abandon Holland.  Therefore, if he's isolated in Swe in
    1902, can I ask for Norways's support?
    
    I think we're ok here.  Germany may be doing a little nervous covering,
    and I can't fault him...for now.  The key is what he does come Fall, and
    into 1902 after the builds.  I think we'll be flexible enough up north
    that we can address any silliness on his part.
    
    In the south, it comes down to:  do A/R cooperate and shoot for Bul
    along with everything else?  Do we go conservative and secure RUM and
    GRE?  Do I go to ARM (that's my inclination right now)?  Edi says he
    wants "two from Turkey,." which is in itself disquieting, for that
    translates into:  I want Gre, Ser, Bul, and one more.   Makes my defense
    a little more stretched when the final curtain rises, but I can't think
    that far ahead....not with a vengeful Turk on my case.
    
    Any ideas or suggestions for me/us down there?  Everything else sound ok
    to you?  Counter-commentary?

    That seems to have gone tolerably well.
    
    I'd hoped to have the German fleet in Holland, not Denmark. I asked, he
    seemed agreeable. Too bad. Now I've got some guessing to do, I think.
    
    I wonder whether A Vie-Tri signals trouble for our Quadripartian Shots.
    Probably not, probably Edi worrying that Cal would jump ship. I expect A
    Tus-Ven, anyway, though Tus-Tun is much better for my personal interests.
    
    I would very much like to hear some words from Pitt before I decide exactly
    how I will proceed. But in any case, our private plans, yours and mine,

    Kaiser-guy,
    
    Why Kie-Den? Why not to Hol? Now no Belgium.
    Maybe you were frightened of Russia. Maybe you didn't believe I'd go to the

    I guess this is why you never answered my note, the one that looked like this:

    	Or do we just leave it at this:
    	I'll move to Ech, Nth, Wal; you'll move to Bur, Hol, Kie?

    Dear M. Jean-Bark,
    
    Allow me to explain.
    
    More than once you simply failed to respond to my suggestions, questions,
    comments. You did later write back, but ignoring what I'd said. Since I
    knew the explanation couldn't be that you were uncommunicative,
    incommunicado, or just too busy (else you wouldn't have written at all), I
    could think of only one alternative: that you didn't want to reveal your
    plans by getting into a detailed discussion.
    
    I am sorry. I would have preferred to try a conservative opening,
    Nwg/Nth/Edi. I hate to commit myself so early, and I always hate to spoil
    relations with a neighbor.
    
    Shall we try to make amends?

    Hello Hohn
    I know right now I'm doubtless seen as the "Great Satan" in your eyes.
    Justifiably so, I'm afraid, as I did lie to you.  But I didn't want to
    shut off communication between us, even in a state of hostilities, and
    figured you'd be the first one I sent a note to after I saw the moves.
    
    As you can see, I decided to side with Edi as opposed to you for S'01.
    Even until the day before the moves were due I was still going to go
    "pro-Turk," but when I deduced how the rest of the board was seemingly
    moving, I decided--for the time being--to throw my lot in with the
    Archduke.   While I sincerely believe R/Ts are "the" alliance of choice
    on the board, I wanted to INITIALLY try something wacky and zany for a
    change this game, even at the risk of bringing fire down on me.
    
    Am I locked in concrete with Edi for the game?  Nah.  Should you
    consider me a perpetual lying scumbucket for the rest of the game?  Nah.
     There will be lots of opportunities for potential cooperation, although
    it will take a lot of trust on your part to think I'm not fibbing
    again--I understand that.  But if the opportunity presents itself, you
    can bet I'll be writing you, and I certainly hope you do the same.
    
    Break a leg (not for real!) this game, and good hunting.

    Jim, I am not quite sure what you meant.  Please elaborate.  What kind of
    conclusions will others draw?  I need to know if I've misstepped.
    
    As for my feelings so far, two things.  First, the strange glich that sent
    my orders and password to Germany just about killed me.  He had one solid
    piece of evidence of my intentions and he went with it.  Can't blame him.
    I've recovered from such things in other games, but this time, no luck.
    Second, I really have been distracted.  I dropped out of diplomacy some
    time ago because I did not feel I was devoting sufficient energy to my
    games.  I was happy to join this game and I fully expected to give it my
    all, but as you have seen, I've barely kept track of what others have said
    to me.  When they infer I am being purposely misleading, I'm sunk.  I
    apologize for not being a stronger player.
    
    I've not given up.  I think England will see that it's not in his interest
    to have France go down quickly.  If anything, knowing who your enemies are
    right away can be an advantage.  Thus, don't take my public pronouncements
    of despair too seriously.   Appearing to give up serves purposes re G and
    I.

    M. Jean-Bark,
    
    I understand that the advantage to me of simply continuing the invasion is
    strong enough (a) to make me likely (in an objective sense) to do it, and
    (b) to make you strongly suspect that I will do it. This will, obviously,
    make further negotiations difficult.
    
    However, I will give serious thought to your Belgium suggestion. The fact
    that for you Bur-Mar is such a good move encourages me (makes it less
    likely that you'd play Bur-Bel). And adding both Norway and Belgium, two
    centers for England in 1901, seems like a plenty-good-enough result, much
    better than the average English result. I always like an early army on the
    continent, too; it makes the long term prospects so much brighter, the
    choice of grand strategies so much more flexible.
    
    Since you've said that you will move in accordance with that plan no matter
    what I decide, I feel in no hurry to make my decision! I'll let it stew in
    my mind for a while.
    
    Cheers!

    This is surely going to be a very interesting game ! :)
    
    I never saw that English opening in action (I said I am not an expert), and I
    must say that I was starting to think that England can only play towards
    Russia in 1901.
    Italy seems to cooperate with E, too, and that is also an opening which
    is not so common in my experience (but more than the english one).
    Is France considered to be somehow more dangerous than other neighbours or
    did he simply get caught in the middle?
    
    The southeast is not less exiciting. I imagine that Russia betrayed Turkey,
    and the army in Sev makes me think that it is not a ruse, but if that turns
    out to be the beginning of a RT alliance than I will be absolutely amazed!
    I am curios to see whether Germany will deny Sweden to Russia or not, and
    I am also curios to see whether he will join the "death to France" party
    or try to help him (how?).
    
    Any comment?

    Noble kaiser!
    Greetings again!  I see that not only are we Dip "neighbors," but also
    fellow History buffs.  (You won the historynet.com Daily Quiz for a week
    in January; I am, indeed, duly impressed, having missed more than my
    share of the more arcane questions....)  Good show!
    
    As pertains to the game:  I'm hoping all went well for you, or at least
    as intended?  Your opening move could be construed as pro-E (the opening
    to Bur), anti-R (bounce potential vs Swe?), or merely CYA (there--I give
    you the 'cop out" answer, to hide your true intent, ha ha.)
    
    Anyway, Pitt, I'm hoping there is still no problem regarding Swedish
    ownership for the Tsar?  You occupy a fairly nice position at present:
    France beseiged and soon to die; E/I occupied vs the selfsame France,
    and Russia moving south.  I'm hoping we can maintain continued goodwill.
    
    Getting back to the French issue:  John wrote a couple of 'downer' notes
    to me today, in reply to my condolences (and offers to pass info, baaaa
    ha ha).  Either he's a *very* good actor who's hiding the real story, or
    he's truly abjectly demoralized and defeated already.  If the latter is
    the case, then "we" (the collective "we" who think in terms of
    balance-of-power) may want to consider the ramifications of a
    quickly-blitzed France, and what that means in terms of ... ahem ..
    neighborly growth.  If you're in cahoots with Eng, then by all means!,
    stay away from me and keep plugging France.  But if E/I are playing the
    tag-team killers, you and I need to assess the long-term effects of
    that.
    
    Bottom line:  I always wish G/R peace; I always wish Swe (yuk yuk); and
    I always stand ready to assist you if needed/desired.
    
    Good hunting

    Hohn
    Just a very short note, because the next hour or so will see me
    frantically developing lesson plans for next week.   Thanks for your
    reply.
    
    As for the note you sent:  you can judge our thoughts from the same note
    data I sent you just a few minutes ago.   I think I have enough to "mull
    over" for the moment.  The key for me is:  do I trust you (no reason not
    to) and hit Aus, given that A/I are together (I had a feeling Ita
    wouldn't hit him), or do I see the depth of the A/I and try to make it a
    three-way, hoping to level you?   There are benefits to both:
    Pro-Tur:  utter surprise of the board and clear lines of advance and
    gain
    Pro-Aus (and assuming neutrality with E):  uninterrurpted pummeling on
    you, with fights over scraps among the other jackals.   Disdvantage:
    Tur dies while Aus gains the lion's (jackal's?) share.   Decisions,
    decisions.
    
    Anyway, gotta go.  You've done your share, and make a convincing
    argument.  I'll mull, believe me.
    
    Best

    Mark,
    
    Why you...you dirty rat!
    
    Wow, you really threw me for a loop there.  Had me totally
    snowed.  Our extensive press, added to the traditional
    difficulty Russia has attacking Turkey from the beginning of
    the game convinced me that we were solid.
    
    Oh well, que sera sera, and all that.
    
    I'm going to cover my ass this turn, Mark.  And I sadly
    suspect that we're going to be at war for some time.  But
    just to throw a little food for thought at you (thinking
    perhaps that like a ravenous animal, maybe if I throw food I
    can distract you from eating me) ;) I'd like to point out
    that UKR-GAL is guaranteed.  SEV-RUM with BLA support is
    also guaranteed.  If we did that, we'd be in strong
    position, and indeed, it would identically resemble our
    position under your originally proposed RT plans.  I think
    I've pretty clearly demonstrated my commitment to and
    preference for the RT alliance.  Meanwhile, even if Edi goes
    with you, how long do you think that will last?
    
    What do you say?  I'm willing to let bygones be bygones
    (hell, how can I _not_, considering the circumstances).
    Please don't feel compelled to answer now, all I ask is that
    you just think about it for a while.
    
    Finally, as a note of warning, I also promise you that if
    you continue coming after me, I'll do my utmost to defend
    myself against you, to the exclusion of all others.  If you
    and Edi both come after me, in light of your egregious lie
    and stab, I'll try my damnedest to see that Edi gets the
    lion's share of me, and that he's in better tactical
    position than you are.  And that's no lie, Mark.
    
    Think about it.  And please let me know.

    You did all the right stuff.  You shouldn't feel like some schmoe.  I
    thought the Bla move was a better one, given that I lean toward Austria.
     You stated early on that you wanted me in Sev (or Rum) because trust
    wasn't entirely verified.  Well, look at it now.  (What I'm implying
    here is that YOU did the best you could.  You wanted no Bla fleet

    I guess Sev-Rum (Bla S) and Ukr-Gal is always an option.  I mean, the

    Gentlemen:  Just a very short note, as I'm a tad pressed for time.
    Nonetheless, I wanted to say 'congrats to us all'  for some great
    opening moves (have already said same to England recently).  The
    Quadripartite Plan goes well.  I spoofed Turkey--albeit at the risk of
    soured relations for the rest of the game--and this puts us in good
    shape to influence events in Arm, Bul, or the "traditional" approach.
    Edi, I'll hash out some options later on--no time now.
    
    Cal, you're lookin' good.  Press on!
    
    Faz Concern this turn:  Germany's F den, which really "shouldn't" be
    there (Eng is also nervous).
    
    Faz Note of the Day:  A completely dejected French reply (not once, but
    twice!) regarding his situation. He refuses any offer of even
    info-sharing from me, saying that it's too late, he's finished, etc.  Is
    this an overemphasizing actor ("Don't cry for me, Argentina?") or are we
    facing abject defeatism a la 1940?  Only his hairdresser knows for sure.

    Pitt,
    
    Wow, nice gangbang of France!  I imagine he feels even worse than me
    right now! :)
    
    Obviously, I'm here to beseech your assistance against Russia.  I'm
    not so brazen as to ask you to commit any major force while you're
    busy in the west, but I'm really, really hoping you'll bounce him in
    Sweden.  I'm sure you know that it does you no good to let him in,
    grow stronger, and kill me more quickly.  You have my word that I'll
    be doing my best to slow Russia down, and hopefully turn the tide
    despite my current tactical disadvantage.  But every build he gets is
    another nail in my coffin, and the sooner he finishes me, the sooner
    he looks for new targets.
    
    Good luck in the West, Pitt.  And please, bounce Russia from Sweden.

    Jim,
    
    Regarding commentary, my recent letter to Edi is 100% true.  It
    accurately summarizes my thought processes and current intentions.
    I'm hoping that he recognizes my sincerity and opts to go with me.  In
    light of Russia's moves, I _am_ going to be relegated to junior
    partner status, at best.  And I can deal with that.  One thing about
    Turkey is that unless it's completely eliminated, it can always come
    back.  That's one of the reasons it's my second favorite power (behind
    France), its tenacity and staying power.  At San Diego DipCon 1989, I
    took a Turkey that had 3 centers at the end of 1902 and 1903 to
    eventual 18 center victory.  At Chapel Hill DipCon 1990, in Larry
    Peery's demo game, I was down to _1_ center in 1903-04, and as I
    recall I managed to make it back up to 4 by the time we had to end the
    game (we did the demo game on the last day, and people had to make
    flights).  I'm _hoping_ I can do something similar here.  It's still a
    damn uphill battle, though.  I was really thinking there was
    practically zero chance of Mark stabbing me, not only from our press,
    but also because it's generally a tough row for Russia to hoe, going
    against Turkey.
    
    Those are my thoughts, for the record.

    Cousin Tsar,
    
    I think the sensible thing to do now is to wait to hear from Germany. The
    particulars of my attitudes will depend on what he says.
    
    Oddly enough(!!), Edi explained Pitt's overall Dip-playing approach
    differently (from the way he explained it to you). He told me that Pitt was
    a 'vulture' type player, waiting to see who the weak sister would be and
    then jumping on the twitching carcass. (Do you call it a 'carcass' if it's
    still twitching?)
    
    Hypothesis: Edi gives out 'information' about Pitt according to how he
    expects it will influence the one he is 'informing'. He wants me to go
    along with the 'beat up on France' plan, so he tells me Germany will help
    for sure. He wants you to lay off him (Edi), so he hints that a gang-up on
    Austria would influence Germany to aid his Germanophone relative.
    
    Why I Love Diplomacy, reason 62: I can freely indulge my most paranoid
    fantasies in an appropriate context.
    
    
    Here follow suggestions for you/answer to your potential request:
    
    I fully expect that I would support you to Sweden if necessary. I don't
    like to promise such a thing right this minute. Again, I want to hear what
    Pitt says. There is a chance that I will have to be very careful to stay on
    his good side. I would most like simply to continue with the Plan d'Birsan.
    It's not out of the question that I'll have to consider Germany my main
    enemy after all, though. So many delicate issues. I should probably wait
    also to hear from Austria and Italy. If Cal seems inclined to call the
    whole thing off, my need for German help increases. But again, my
    *prediction* is that in case of Den-Swe, I would offer support of Nwy next
    year. Because it should be clear enough to Pitt that bouncing you would
    count as hostility to me as well.
    
    As to the south, the only thing I feel definite about is that Gre, Ser,
    Bul, plus one more for Austria does sound like too much to me. (Of course,
    there are seven centers to split between you so it has to be 4:3, and after
    all, nominally the next phase is likely to get more for you than for
    Edi--he'd get only Mun from Germany, you'd probably get a couple of
    centers). But you have a delicate hand of your own to play. You may need to
    be the Yes-man for a while with Edi, intending to stab him, in concert with
    Cal, at the ripe moment. Or, you may have to try to plan a longer-term
    alliance with Edi, in which case I do think you ought to be very sure that
    a division of the Balkans and Turkistan is clearly agreed to and considered
    equitable by you (otherwise you're just asking for it).
    
    The specific tactics of invading Turkey, well, I just can't say. I won't
    launch into a whole long theoretic discourse, but in short my view is that
    situations like yours call for 'mixed strategies'. The proper thing to do
    is to give yourself a certain chance of going for Bulg, a certain chance of
    the more conservative move, then roll the dice and follow their decision.
    If that sounds silly, I'll put it this way, which should be fairly
    persuasive:
    Trying to outguess Hohn Cho is a Fool's Game. (And you may feel free to
    tell him that I told you so!)
    
    Back in touch when I've had my response from the Axis.
    
    Cheers!

    Well, OK, I have had long debates in the r.g.d forum with people about
    the tendency of E-Mail players to "give up" when things go badly.... and
    also to tend to drop into stalemate line draw positions if they can't

    Hi Edi!  Now that I've looked at the damned board (grin, I never USED to
    need to do that; I must be getting old) I think we're still in a pretty
    good position.   Mark sent me the list of "Options" he sent you and I
    told him I like the idea of going for Armenia.  Sure, Hohn will get a
    build and you'll be taking a slight gamble that you won't get Greece,
    but I think the tactical position we'd have with you and Mark having
    units in Rum, Ser, Bla, Arm would be enough to offset these
    disadvantages.  Wot say ye?
    
    Anyway, everything else looks good.  Let me know if you hear anything

    I think you're missing Hohn's most likely option, that of simply
    supporting
    Bul with Con.  In that case he'd get a build, but you and Edi would have
    Rum/Gre
    
    > Option 3 was a variant (again, with Edi risking Gre):  Ser S Ukr-Rum,

    I think this is the option I like best, but Option 2 looks good as well.
    While I would like to stop Turkey from building, I'm a firm believer in
    sacrificing the quick centre for a good tactical position.  I figure
    Hohn
    will simply try to pick up his build for Bul (by supporting it from Con)
    and maybe move to Arm with the other army.

    I will definitely write Edi and try to sell Option 3.  If you REALLY
    want,
    I'll try to sell Option 2, but for my money, you're better off with 3.

    I suspect he has enough people to be pissed of at that he's unlikely to
    devote ALL his units to keeping me out of Marseilles, so I'll move there
    if
    only to stop a fleet build there.  My guess as to his most likely moves
    is:
    Mid-Bre; Bur-Bel; Mar-Spa (or H, I'm not sure).  Frankly, he could do
    anything - he's still f%$ked, so he may just try to throw something
    randomly wild at us.  It's what I'D do... grin.

    Hi Edi,
    Have been relooking the board.  If you have those options of mine in =
    front of you, I want to offer up a (temporary) fix to keeping Hohn =
    reduced.  You might not like it because of the more immediate gain for =
    me, but it DOES accomplish our goal of reducing Hohn quickly, with =
    negligible effect on the alliance (or your gains).
    
    It's basically a revision of Option 2:
    Aus:  Ser S (TUR) Bla-Bul(ec),  Alb-Gre
    Rus:  Sev-Rum (Ukr S)
    
    Yes, this gets me BUL (for now; I envision a swapout between us).  And =
    yes, it risks you being bounced in Gre if Hohn goes there (doubtful, =
    given his feeling of being in the Alamo).  But look at the advantage: =20
    1) Rum and Bul are pacified and freed forever from the Turk
    2) Hohn's A Bul has a 50-50 (or greater) chance of being annihilated
    
    If he uses Con to support Bul, then you get Gre with no need for Ser =
    support, and the worst we do is bounce him in Bul.  If he puts Bul =
    anywhere in motion (vs Gre or Rum), then the unit is annihilated.  Same =
    thing if he uses Con to hit Bla, or sail out.
    
    I think we should do *something* other than just supporting ourselves =
    into set-piece attacks (via Gre and Rum with all our units).  What do =
    you think?
    
    And remember:  when we do this German thing in '02, you already have Tri =
    in place, ostensibly "against" Ita...one placement in Vie, and poof!  =
    our plan continues!
    
    What might sweeten the pot:  Hohn is asking me to forego attacks on him =
    and instead "turn the tables" by moving Ukr-Gal, Sev-Rum (Bla S).  I =
    have no intention of doing so.  But if I convince him that I'm sincere =
    (hard, but not impossible), we can set him up for The Big Fall.
    
    What say you?

    Hi Cal
    Thanks for the flurry of mail as of late, and thanks also for putting in =
    the 'plug" about me taking BUL.  In all honesty, it's NOT beyond the =
    realm of possibility, but it would involve (gasp!) a sacrifice on Edi's =
    part for the good of the alliance.
    
    I offered Edi one of three options (and there are tons more out there).
    Option 1 is that we stay conservative:  Alb-Gre (Ser S), and Sev-Rum =
    (Bla, Ukr S).  We both get what we want, but so does Turkey.
    
    Option 2 involves trying to kill BUL:
    Ser-Bul (Bla S), or vice versa, I guess...
    Alb-Gre
    Sev-Rum (Ukr S)
    In this option, I get Rum for sure, and--if Hohn guesses wrong, either =
    Edi (or I) get BUL and GRE.  The downer to this is if Hohn guesses =
    correctly and does Bul-Gre, Con-Bla.  If he did that, he'd bounce us in =
    both Gre and Bul.  Now, what are the odds of Hohn doing that?  =20
    
    ***(And, if I went Bla-Bul with Edi supporting, we'd be guaranteed BUL =
    and RUM, with Gre still an option!)
    
    Oh sure, Hohn could then go Con-Bla and get the place, but so what?  =
    he'd stay at three SCs, I'd have Sev open (for a 2nd fleet), and he'd be =
    boxed in tighter than a drum.
    
    Option 3 was a variant (again, with Edi risking Gre):  Ser S Ukr-Rum, =
    Alb-Gre
    						    Sev-Arm (Bla S)
    We'd stand a pretty good chance of forcing Arm, thus keeping Hohn from =
    moving out of Ank -- thus forcing a build in Smy.  With our units in =
    Arm, Bla, Rum and Ser, it'd only be a matter of time....
    
    I like Option 2, Cal, and wonder what your opinion is?  The reason I =
    like option 2 is it guarantees me +2 in the Balkans, still helps the Q =
    alliance (whether or not Edi gets Gre in 1901), continues to hem in the =
    Turk, and--more importantly--keeps Edi reasonably manageable down there. =
     If and when we then decided to hit him, then it'd be one less unit we'd =
    have to mess with further down the line.
    
    **It'd be swell if you could help 'sell" Option 2 (or any of them, =
    really) to Edi. You could point out the obvious benefits in killing BUL =
    ("so what" if Faz gets it for now?"), and help me convince him that -- =
    even if he got bounced in Gre -- he'd still be ok at +1.  I mean, what =
    is his intent for 1902:  build Vie, Tri, then move to Tyo and Boh.   So, =
    he just builds one (Vie), ALREADY HAS Tri, and thus can still accomplish =
    his grand plan!  =20
    
    Do you agree with this idea/appraoch, or am I being too greedy?  I think =
    the prime directive has to be (a) keep Hohn from building, (b) keep the =
    Q Alliance going as planned until F and T are dead, and (c) keeping Edi =
    manageable when (b) is finally realized.
    
    Let me know what you think, Cal.  I could use some Italian influence in =
    the court of the Austrians right now, 'for the good of the alliance.'
    
    Keep plugging vs France.  I'd hit him, if only to ensure he doesn't try =
    and sneak out for Spain.  He may still do so (Bur-mar, Mar-Spa, Mao-bre =
    or Por, 'damning the torpedoes' as he does so).  If you try for Mar, =
    then we should probably have the Hun doing something (Mun-Ruh?), or else =
    have you hold and have him try for Bur--I bet he'd get it (if that's =
    what we want???)
    
    Take care, and let me know what you think.

    Hey guy!  :)
    
    Well, THAT went well, no?  I think we do have a good bit of momentum and
    I hope we can keep it.  The only slight worry for me was Edi's move to
    Trieste but, when I thought about it, I realized it's just Edi being
    careful.  It actually works out to my advantage because I had been
    worried about exactly how to keep a presence close enough to his border
    to be in on our (eventual) attack.  He's just given me the perfect
    excuse.
    
    I tried to put in a plug for your taking Bulgaria this Fall in that note
    to you and Edi.  Hopefully, he'll go for it.
    
    Now all I have to do is figure out if I should try for Marseilles or
    not...

    I think the important thing would be to make sure that Turkey doesn't
    get
    to build here for Bulgaria.  With F Black cutting Con, it's just a
    matter
    of deciding WHO gets Bul.  You guys figure that one out, but don't let

    I figure it's just Pitt covering his ass.  Inconvenient, but things went
    so bloody well this turn, we better not bitch about the small things.
    (It
    occurs to me that the chance of Pitt blocking Mark out of Sweden might
    be
    an argument in favour of Mark taking Bulgaria?)

    Well, I wasn't really crazy about it, but I think it falls in the same

    mind as it doesn't really threaten me (although it DOES rule out a
    convoy from Tuscany to Tunis this Fall).  Oh well.  Too early to worry.

    After reading the commentary (Hohn's and the observer's), I doubt if ANY
    comments about your moves as a smokescreen will be likely to be
    believed.  I suspect it's simply attack and attack from here on in.

    Edi,
    A quick addition to the note I just sent...
    If I were Turkey, I'd gamble a bit and try Ank-Arm, to open Ank up for
    his +1 fleet build, and thus wrest control of/stalemate me in Bla,
    right?  Option 3 (below) might give us the chance to bounce his unit
    (i.e., keep him in Ank), forcing him to build an army out in the boonies
    (Smy), vice a fleet up north.
    
    Anyway, Edi, just a thought.  There's tons of stuff to consider.

<p><a name=254></a><b>Private message from <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font> to <font color=ff0000>Austria</font>:</b><pre>
    Hi again Edi
    Have been looking over the board, and here are some thoughts.
    
    The West
    England is, as I said, also concerned over Germany's diversion of the
    fleet to Den, vice Hol.  I personally feel Pitt is just playing CYA, not
    knowing early E or R intentions. I told Jamie that I think we're still
    ok, and if G hits anyone, it'll be a block of me, not Eng.  Have been
    communicating with Pitt, trying to ensure continued peace in Scandy.
    The anti-French openings look good, and John could collapse quickly, if
    G doesn't try to realign the previous balance-of-power.   Have you heard
    anything from Italy or from Germany?
    
    The East
    Hohn shrugged off the hit, and seems pretty upbeat about it (he's both a
    good guy, and a good poker player, I'll wager).  Wants me to deviate
    from any alliance/Austrian leanings this turn by hitting Gal and
    supporting myself to Rum.  We can turn this idea into gold for us, Edi.
    
    I see at least three (probably more) move variations we should consider.
    Option 1:  Conservative.
    A:  Ser S Alb-Gre			T:  Sev-Rum (Ukr and Bla S)
    This ensures we get our southern builds, and boxes in Turkey.
    
    Option 2:
    A:  Ser-Bul 			T:  Bla S Ser-Bul
     Alb-Gre			     Ukr S Sev-Rum
    This has good and bad to it.  On the plus side, we stand a good chance
    of annihilating Bul while still getting our gains.  I mean, if he
    supports Bul with Con, you get Gre and I get Rum.  if he tries to bounce
    Rum or Gre, then we nail him in movement.
    On the negative side, *IF* he guesses exactly right, he could
    conceivably go Bul-Gre, Bla-Con and wreck your chance for Gre this turn.
     I don't see that happening, truthfully.
    
    Option 3:
    A:  Ser S Ukr-Rum, Alb-Gre		T:  Ukr-Rum, Bla S Sev-Arm
     This has a chance of *really* putting the choke hold on early!  If it
    succeeds, Turkey is circling the wagons, we have a chance to exploit
    Syr/Aeg/Smy in '02, etc etc.  Again, the disadvantage is if he hits Gre,
    which makes us each go +1 down there.  But we gain position, with no
    enemies to face us down there anyway.  (If you're really going after
    Germany, a +1 wouldn't be all that critical.  You just go Tri-Tyo, and
    the build Vie-Boh, and we're off to the races.  Right?)
    
    As I said, there are tons of other variations out there, Edi, some more
    favorable to you (or to me).  Option 1 is the "standard" plan, but
    allows Turkey more freedom to maneuver down there while we finesse our
    guys around.  I personally like Option 2, because of the chance we kill
    BUL and give him zero builds, while still having a 50-75% chance of
    nailing all the SCs we want.  ***ALSO:  he has no reason to suspect
    perfidy from you; you haven't lied to him or stabbed him, as have I.
    Might be a good chance for success???? ***
    
    Anyway, that's my initial read of the tea leaves.  Turkey was apparently
    suckered in by everyone:  he fully expected Italy to nail you this
    season, and envisioned a three-way on you.  And while I'm sure he's
    trying to get you 'called off" (even though YOU don't show any signs of
    overt hostility yet), he's been heavy on my butt to get me to 'see the
    light.'
    
    Let me know what you think, and take care.  Let's keep plugging.

    Hi Pitt!  Sorry to take a bit to get to you, but like everybody else in
    this game, the weekend seems to be a slow correspondence time...
    
    It sure seems to me that France's goose is cooked.  His press seems to
    suggest he's about to crawl into a fetal ball and die.  Has he written
    to yoy?  He certainly hasn't sent me anything.
    
    I was wondering if you have any preference about moves in F'02.  My gut
    feeling is to try and hit Marseilles in hopes of preventing a build
    there (assuming he GETS any builds), but I'm open to suggestion. Of
    course, if I DO get into Marseilles and you don't get Burgandy (assuming
    you try for it again; or are you going to Ruhr and building in Munich?),
    I would be happy to support you in there in the Spring.
    
    Anything else new?
