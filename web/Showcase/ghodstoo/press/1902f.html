    Edi
    You rascal.  My (self-fulfilling?) fears came true, it seems.  I did
    nothing to wean Turkey to my side, because I thought he'd be willing to
    hit his tormentor after I hit you...apparently you not only beat me to
    the punch, but you and Hohn now have me over a barrel down there.
    Luckily Italy also realized the danger of unimpeded Austrian growth--at
    least you'll have to cover your backside as you pummel me from the
    front.
    
    En garde, oh BinSauronGungaDin.

    Hi there, other witch.
    
    So, the tide has turned! And this tide has left *me* high and dry!
    
    A blessing on your fortunes, a curse on mine.
    
    
    I now have an unusual, a strange request. I am supposing, for the sake of
    argument, that considerations in your corner still have *some* balance,
    even though the one of your tormentors has just helped you and the other
    has not. And if I'm right, then I beseech you to take a close look at
    whatever Russia has to offer.
    
    My reason is that the Bear turns out to be a peculiar animal. He steals
    from me, says he, only out of his instinct of self-preservation. If he were
    to feel that your forces would be directed against Austria, or at least not
    against his ursine self, he would be my last hope of help in my quarter of
    the world. Otherwise he will leave me to the dogs. Quite an offer!
    
    Naturally, you have other considerations far more pressing than my
    hardships. However, if you were to lean in the direction most helpful to
    me, and if as a result I (and you!) managed to make it to the endgame, I
    think my presence in the Other corner would redound to your advantage.
    
    Again, it's a small carrot to offer, but I thought if you were undecided,
    or close to undecided, a bit of carrot for your salad might be enough to
    round out the meal.
    
    In any case, the best of luck to you,
    
    Other Witch

    Hohn:
    Look, I'll take whatever lumps you want to send my way.  Yes, I lied to
    you when you were sincere with me.  Why shouldn't I have done so, when
    Edi had asked us to form a 4-way alliance and (a) crush France with EI
    and (b) crush you with AR?  But don't hand me this "chutzpah" crap, ok?
    I worked in an alliance ENGENDERED BY EDI, thank you very much, against
    a target--you.  I did what I had to do for my gains in an alliance, just
    as you are now doing.  I respect you and your moves.  Give ME some
    credit for my past actions as part of an AR.  (Btw, I find it
    interesting that Edi--the master of this all--gets no slam from you
    whatsoever.  He had the plan to level you, then "supposedly" hit I and G
    in conjunction with me.  I accept my role as Bad Guy toward you.  But
    don't make Edi out as the benign observer, ok?  Don't tell me you're
    that blind.)
    
    Why didn't I contact you last turn?  And say what?  "Hohn, I'm going to
    stab Edi this turn; please don't tell him.  And by the way, I really
    desire you to forget about my last two turns of evilness toward you, and
    want you to hit Edi with me."  What options were thus available to me?:
    (1) You agree to it all, and we live happily ever after; (2) You see the
    perfect chance to warn Edi, have him cover vs me, and start a war
    against both your tormentors while you observe -- or choose sides.
    Who's to say you'd even BELIEVE what I'd say?
    Sure, in hindsight the worst option happened anyway, so maybe I
    should've called.   But I thought that once I was in SER and GAL (and
    not trying stuff vs Arm, despite your "guarantee" of going there), then
    you'd see I was after him for good.  Is letting him take BUL my way of
    being a good ally?  No, it's not.  It was greed, pure and simple,
    designed to build up my country against unknown, expert players.  But
    please note:  he took BUL even without my support.  A subtle nuance
    perhaps of no import to you, but still reeking of evil intent toward you
    from Aus nonetheless.  But that doesn't matter to you if you're an
    Austrian puppet, right?
    
    Frankly, Hohn, I find your tone surly, even for (especially for) a game
    of wooden blocks.  I overlook it  because you caveated it as "your
    style," and you obviously meant it to be "for effect" to stress your
    intentions.  So be it.   Be advised, though, I'm NOT trying to impugn
    your intelligence or smother you with BS.  My first note SAID that I
    tried to kill off BUL;  even my 1901 notes told you that I was a rat for
    hitting you.  How many times would you like me to flagellate myself with
    a whip?
    
    I had an ally; I did what was good for the alliance at the time; the
    alliance is finished; I'm now trying to work a deal with you.  OK?
    
    You want me out of BLA; fine.  Where do I go?  Does it sail to RUM?  Do
    I un-ass SEV and try something with the armies?  YOU tell ME what you
    envision, Hohn; you (and Edi) are now in the driver's seat.  I tried my
    grand pro-Aus plan, and it failed miserably.  As I'm sure I won't be
    talking to him for awhile, I'll be much more in touch with you (mail and
    phone), given that you have stressed repeatedly your desire for
    discussion and/or teamwork.  I always believed you; the window for me
    opened now that AR fell apart.
    
    The ironic thing about this is that RT--natural allies--are fighting
    (caused by me, yes) over the same thing:  Aus perfidy.  And Edi is the
    only one who gains from it.  I'd like to change that situation, and it
    will take us both to fix it.
    
    I  accept your points in the letter, and hope mine wasn't too blunt in
    reply.  I am, indeed, "willing to deal."

    Edi,
    
    Thanks for the support into Rumania!  It was extremely gratifying to
    demolish that Russian army. :)
    
    I'm now more firmly convinced than ever that most people on this board
    have gone stab-happy.  I'm feeling pretty confident that the two of
    us, working well together as always, will be able to weather the stab
    storm and come out in decent shape.  And I'm still more than happy to
    play junior partner to your senior.  I just want to get Mark off my
    back!
    
    Regarding other matters, Cal and Mark are conducting a full court
    press on me to work with them against you.  I've responded by sending
    them a blunt letter, calling Mark out for various things, but which
    does hold out the possibility of working with them if Mark vacates
    Black Sea.  I doubt it will work, but you never know.  I could have
    just played along, but I don't think they would have bought it, and I
    also didn't think one turn's worth of potential tactical benefit
    merited the deception.
    
    Please let me know what you think we should do this turn.  I'll offer
    any refinements I can, but I'll of course support whatever it is you
    want to do.

<p><a name=4></a><b>Private message from <font color=bbbb00>Turkey</font> to <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font>:</b><pre>
    Dear Mark and Cal,
    
    I've read both of your letters.  Preliminarily, I'm
    interested in responding to only one major point.
    
    > Hohn:  Yes, I supported Edi to BUL.  My goal was to see
    > your unit get annihilated (I'll be up-front about that
    > part), but ONLY in the context of luring Edi out of SER

    > beyond, as an ally.  I just couldn't "let on" my plans
    > unless Edi found out--that's why I never called you when I
    > said I would.
    
    I must confess that I find your current diplomatic stance
    extremely curious, Mark.  You said not one word to me this
    entire past turn.  So of course I am going to assume we are
    still at war.  Now, when you decide for independent reasons
    of your own to go for Edi, when you decide not to move to
    ARM (which, barring certain risky guesses on your part, I
    was guaranteed to take anyway, I might add) for specific
    perceived tactical benefits to _yourself_, while at the same
    time _continuing_ to demonstrate hostility towards me
    (_regardless_ of your ostensible "true reason" of sneaking
    into SER, you still ordered RUM S SER-BUL), you apparently
    expect me to happily forget that you have twice gone back on
    your word to me and work with you against my sole ally?
    
    Man, that's chutzpah.
    
    As I said before, Mark, you're going to have to take some
    unilateral action to decrease tension between us, you're
    going to have to make good on at least one promise before I
    can begin to consider working with you in any significant
    fashion.  Tell you what.  Get the hell out of BLA, and I'll
    be happy to work with you.  Until you do, I'm going to
    continue working with Edi as his loyal puppet.
    
    > Of course, you and Edi were on the phones,
    > and you took "the best offer" at the time.
    > Understandable.
    
    Of course it's understandable.  You and I are at war, and
    had no contact this past turn.  You really don't need to
    state the obvious with me, Mark.  It's unnecessary, and just
    FYI, I personally don't appreciate it.
    
    > I did you wrong in that year, and intended to make it up
    > this year by the hit on Edi.  You just didn't anticipate
    > it, so I guess "we're even."
    
    Finally, this is simply laughable.  You expect me to equate
    your two stabs of me with my legitimate diplomatic
    negotiation with Edi to make a coordinated tactical move
    against you, with whom I am unquestionably at war?
    Especially when you gave me _no_ indication of what you were
    going to do?  Come on, Mark.  You did what you felt was in
    _your_ best interest, not mine.  Your support of SER-RUM
    trumpets that fact to all.
    
    There is such a thing as the moral high ground, Mark, even
    in Diplomacy.  Your attempt to avoid personal responsibility
    here, your cavalier disregard of our true history, and your
    recasting of your own motivations, insults my intelligence.
    Please stop it.
    
    Look, I'm going to be up front with both of you.  I _have_
    been up front with _both_ of you, this entire game.  I could
    have smiled and nodded and played yes-man, agreed to
    whatever you wanted like a good lackey, and then stabbed you
    as well as I could.  And there are those who would argue
    that that is what I should have done.  But that's not what I
    chose to do.  Because I'm _genuinely_ interested in working
    things out with you, Mark, and I'm interested in working
    with you as well, Cal.  I'm not just looking for the short
    term gain by a quick lie-n-stab.  But in order to do work
    together, we need to be honest with each other, in _all_
    things.  I've told you what I require in order to work with
    you.  So be honest with _me_ now.
    
    I am a blunt person.  And this message has been extremely
    blunt.  But I'm being blunt with you here because I want to
    make sure we completely understand each other, without risk
    of any confusion.  Also, I know you are both of the highest
    caliber of player, who probably will not take bluntness the
    wrong way, and who could see through a bunch of flowery
    bullshit anyway.
    
    Let me know.  I'm certainly open to further discussion, so
    long as it's honest and up front.  I just wanted to make
    sure we had these basic understandings in place, so that we
    won't be wasting our time if our fundamental outlooks cannot
    or will not be reconciled.

<p><a name=5></a><b>Private message from <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font> to <font color=0000cc>England</font>:</b><pre>
    GKJ,
    And I would retort that this isn't the response I expect from you.
    First off, you are far from "out of this game."  You may be the kind of
    chess-like DipMaster who surveys the next 45 moves and figures your
    future standing and outcome.  And if you are, then I truly admire the
    heck out of you even MORESO than I already do.  But for you to say that
    your 'endgame' may be coming soon is a bit overexaggerated, methinks.
    
    For one thing, France can see the German handwriting just as well as
    you, I'd say.  You can easily make the case that IRA left you high and
    dry, an unwitting stooge to their perfidy.  France surely must see the
    danger to a reconciled EG as regards PAR and beyond.  He too must see
    the dangers inherent in a Grmany who has control over Nth, Bel, and
    having two units IN France to boot!  Can you not use that to your
    advantage and rebalance the front?
    
    Also, your diplomacy is pretty doggone good, Jamie.  Why not entice the
    Hun to support you to Nwy this season, and make-up over France?  Offer
    him an EG over anything smacking of RG and see what happens.  I don't
    buy your bankruptcy of options.
    
    Second, why am I the lone "fall guy" for all your QC-less frustrations?
    Because of one center?  You chide me for "selling out" for one center,
    yet you're willing to forget Italy's retreat from France, Edi's
    forfeiture of hitting Germany, ALL of that -- just to potentially
    suicide out against me for taking "your" center?  Had Edi stuck to the
    plan and convinced me of his intentions, I'd be in BAL and SIL, and we'd
    have Ber and/or Mun in a vise.  In Criminology we use the "but for" rule
    to prove a point:  But for Austria sticking to the alliance and hitting
    Germany, but for Italy staying the course, you'd not be in a bad
    position at all.  (And yes, I'll say it:  "but for" me not moving to Nwy
    you'd have a center, too.)
    
    You want to show me why my "perfidy" was wrong, and why YOUR judgment of
    my interests must prove more rational than my own.  (Expected from a
    philosophe, naturally!)   I accept that.  But I don't know you any more
    than you know me.  Who's to say you DIDN'T have an alliance with
    Germany?  Witness your support of him last turn -- yes yes, it could've
    been to lure him in deeper to France...or it could've been something
    even longer-term.  No one knows anyone here, or how we deal...game
    dynamics, and all that.  But I'll wager that offer (to Gas, vice Par)
    propelled Ger to hit you, when you couldn't justify using it to support
    him to PAR instead.   Germany didn't need me to turn on you, Jamie.   He
    has more Dip smarts in his little finger than I do in my whole body.
    
     I guess I would say this:  You now want me to abandon a center that I
    need to face off against REAL perfidy from within "our" alliance, or
    you'll direct your forces entirely against me (at least that's what
    seems implied) for the alliance-breaking move to take Nwy?  So I should
    abandon my chance to stay afloat in order to give you the life
    preserver?   All this over one center, good King?
    
    I will deal with Hohn to the utmost to get him to come over from The
    Dark Side.  As my last note said, if that happens, you'll see me leave
    Nwy.  But if AT stay united, should I just throw in the towel, abandon
    center gains of my own to your largesse instead, and trust to the Fates?
     Is this what's being asked of the Tsar?

<p><a name=6></a><b>Private message from <font color=0000cc>England</font> to <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font>:</b><pre>
    That's not exactly the response I expected from you!
    
    You've left me as high and dry as an Englishman can get. You have cashed in
    an absolute long term ally for the sake of a single supply center. I admit
    that I am not used to the dynamics of your usual environment, but it is
    hard for me to see how that could be a good deal. Was it really 'insurance'
    against possible G/A collusion? Your best possible insurance was a friend
    to protect your interests and keep Germany otherwise occupied. You are in
    the process of canceling that insurance policy. And for one center! And you
    will certainly have to use that extra unit in the north, in Scandinavia, so
    your net gain is nil. It's an attitude that is so foreign to me.
    
    I will refrain from harsh judgment. I am just swimming in unfamiliar
    waters, that's all. But, I can only draw the obvious conclusions, and I'll
    play the sequel according to my own style.
    
    Here is where we stand. If you exit Norway by the end of the year, I
    retract all of my recriminations, and my forces would be at your disposal.
    What else could I do? Otherwise, I'm afraid I am your sworn enemy. Do you
    see how I must view the matter? I had no alliance with Germany, his attack
    is merely what one expects in this sort of game. France is defending
    himself as best he can. You, on the other hand, are in the process of
    proving yourself the worst possible 'ally'.
    
    I am very pessimistic about my chances, at the moment. As I see it, in the
    next few moves I will be spending my last coins, not to improve my own
    standing (which appears doomed) but to affect the outcome of the game. Let
    me explain.
    
    I have just misjudged the situation on the board very badly. Whenever I do
    that, I have to think why. I judged that my allies would not stab me: why
    not? Because I thought it would not be in their interests to stab me. My
    prediction was wrong, but I must, if I can, prove that my underlying
    judgment was sound. I will have to show that my judgment of your interests
    was better than yours. I will have to do what I can to fulfill my own
    prophecy. When it's time to look back and survey our mistakes, it is
    important to me that you see your perfidy as a mistake. Do you see what
    moves me?
    
    That is what I will do just as soon as I have decided that my prospects for
    participation in the endgame have vanished. That may happen very shortly
    indeed. I expect it will. I don't expect you will give me back my only
    hope. As you say, 'anything can happen'. But the avenues to me are closing
    very rapidly.
    
    
    Your move, Tsar!

    Kaiser Pitt
    Well, sir, you see the Russian honor is true--and I see your mettle, as
    well!  I hope you're feeling better (both from the metaphysical sense
    this game, and from a physical sense after your recent illness).
    
    I'm a little chagrined over the AT reunification down there.  Part of me
    sees Edi as crafting this all along.  But part of me sees Edi as using
    Hohn (much like I planned to do in spring); witness his sneaky slide
    into BUL behind Hohn's advance!
    
    I had intended to kill of Hohn's army BUl, but then ally with him and
    offer him fleet build potential (and Austrian centers!) as recompense.
    Edi, master that he is, once again beat me to the punch.   Any
    suggestions on what to do down south?
    
    As for the north:  I'll hold in Nwy, obviously.   Your moves showed the
    "beyond the horizon vision" that mkes you a helluva player.   I mean, if
    you ally with France, BEL and Bre can fall.   if you re-ally with Eng
    (not desired, obviously), then Paris is a goner, and you have the
    position over F and E in the region at a later date.
    
    If you go for the "basics," then you have a convoy potential this turn
    (Hol-Yor, Ruh-Hol, Pic S Bur-Bel).  If England hits F nth, you retreat
    to Lon or Edi.  If not, his internal defense is imploded.   You are,
    indeed, in a nice position.
    
    I will do nothing to upser the RG applecart.  As I've said before, I
    want peace with you, and I need a quiet northern front in order to focus
    on the dreaded AT now forming.  Any persuasion you can do to "wean" Hohn
    from The Dark Side and hit Edi in conjunction with me would be obviously
    appreciated.
    
    Good hunting against whatever province(s) you hit, and here's to the RG.

    Cal,
    Despite the invective being flung about (see my reply, below), I think I
    can work with Hohn.  If I can't, well...they're after me, anyway.  May
    as well take some chances here.  WE need to coordinate some moves,
    either with Turkey (support him to Bud?) or without him...

<p><a name=10></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font>:</b><pre>
    (Tsarist Winter Palace, Summer 1902):  His Majesty's Ministry of
    Information is pleased to inform the readership that peace has been
    achieved with the great Kaiser Pitt in all regards.  The seizure of
    neutral Norway, despite invective from certain western governments, was
    entirely in self-defense and specifically as insurance against any
    southern perfidy.  Sadly, the Southern Front witnessed such perfidy last
    spring.  Austria, breaking all terms of the Quadripartite Continuum
    Alliance, launched an aggressive campaign in collusion with the
    revanchist Sultan Allah Allah In-Free, aka Hohn the Exalted.   The dark
    smoke from Transylvania shadows the gloom that BirSauron and his evil
    minions have wrought.
    
    Tsarist forces are in full retreat from the Balkans.  We hope diplomacy
    can restore the battlefield situation, but we are not sanguine about its
    prospects.  Luckily Doge Cal -- leading an army of Papal crusaders -- is
    en route to pull the Tsarist chestnuts from the fire.
    
    Vive le France!  Bravo Italia!  Heil Viktoria!  And Huzzahs for Johnny
    Bull!  May our friends realize the growing pus-ball that is now the AT
    alliance, and may they lance it with Swords of Righteousness.   Russian
    weakness will engender the emergence of an AT cancer across the lands of
    our friends by mid-game.
    
    End of Ministry Broadcast.

    Hohn
    Thanks for the quick reply.  No, I'm not taking it personally.  There's
    a difference between personal invective (which neither of us should be
    flinging, as neither of us deserve it) and game stuff.  it's all
    personality, really.   If I may reply to your replies  (I'll be at the

    ** IMO, I have accepted responsibility.  I've mentioned more than either

    it's also the game, isn't it?  Sort of, "Hey, I allied with what I
    thought was an ally.  Dodn't work out.  Sorry.  Nothing personal vs
    you."  IS IT "a big deal?"  Haven't you ever made peace with someone YOU
    stabbed and then mutually worked with?   Did you have to have a pound of
    flesh extracted from you, or did you treat it as part of your
    negotiating and dynamics of the game?

    I would submit to you that the fortunes of war have now caused me to
    fight for my survival.   I could easily say that I'm now in a position
    which your actions (puppeting for Edi) forced me into.  But how far back
    do we trace stuff?   You're fighting for survival, UP TO A POINT.
    Unless Edi hits you again, you're in no danger anymore.  I certainly
    can't hurt you now.

    ** Yes, indeed; I have been hostile (mea culpa #546).   But let's define
    "hostile."  Edi making a plan that calls for your destruction is
    "hostile."  Edi taking BUL (and probably RUM) from you is "hostile."
    My acting as part of that alliance was also singularly "hostile."
    Granted.
    As the Monkees song says, "that was then; this is now."

    ** In all honesty, I do.  You may be trying to tell me that you also

    ** I think you misunderstood what I wrote (or at least mean), Hohn.
    When I said we were "even," it wasn't to say "I've expunged all guilt
    about the past, let's wipe the slate clean."  You never sullied the
    slate.
    What I MEANT (but obviously garbled) was:  you didn't hear from me; you
    made a logical choice (understandable); you got me.  We're even in the
    sense that I tried to hose you, and you did hose me.  Does that mean you
    wanted to nail me?  No.  It just was a statement of fact.  I'm sorry if
    you read into (or if my note said more) than what I intended it to mean.

    ** "Moral leverage?"  How so?  Like you're so untermensch that I
    "graciously" would allow back to the ranks of the living after I spin my
    webs?   Wrong-o.  I wanted to get Edi before he got me.  Your country
    was going to be nailed for one more turn in the process.  Morally wrong,
    but I was hoping to be "tactically right."  I foresaw your growth as
    coming when I had Edi reduced.  if that bugs you, I'm sorry.  That was
    how I was trying to play it.

    ** No, it doesn't.  But I was hoping that my being in GAL and
    (hopefully) SER would've rang the little bells that intimated a Russian
    change-of-action.  I never said I wasn't a rat toward you.

    I guess.  But I fully realize you were under the assumption there was an
    RT.

    ** I sense the implication here.  I'll merely say this:  If I was after
    you, I would've remained the Austrian puppet.  Edi's gameplan called for
    RUM S Ser-Bul, Bla S Sev-Arm...again, to continue the Arm war (or anger
    over it).  He was then going to support me to Con (Bul S Sev-Con, Bla
    C), or so he said...Now, YOU don't know those details, and I wasn't
    about to spill them over the phone.  I made the blatant anti-Aus moves I
    did (and invading Gal and trying for SER can't be much more blatant)
    because I wanted a deal with you in the long run, realizing the error of
    my previous ways.  If I didn't, I would've gone "per the plan" and tried
    to get CON in fall, reducing you to two.  That was the better Russian
    option in the long run.

    ** true.  But Edi masterminded one stab of you by using me as his
    (willing) puppet.  He's apparently capitalized on your survival to
    mastermind a second stab, all for his benefit.   before I deal with him
    again, I'd like to be on a more equal basis, and/or let him feel some
    hot breath down HIS back.   As for this immediate past season, I've
    already discussed that to death.

    I wouldn't be writing so doggone much if I wasn't trying to show that
    I'm willing to open the window.

</pre>
<p><a name=12></a><b>Private message from <font color=0000cc>England</font> to <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font>:</b><pre>
    Tsar Faz,
    
    I will try to be brief (but that's not my forte).
    
    First, I think you have overinterpreted my remarks. I do not yet think that
    I am ruined. I think rather that I am very likely to be ruined, I am on the
    brink of the abyss, not yet in free fall.
    I'll be down to three centers, if you don't follow through on our
    agreement, and though I *might* manage to convince either France or Germany
    that I would make a useful puppet, I am not very sanguine about it. I shall
    certainly try.
    I was explaining my alternatives, that's all.
    
    Second, you're a fine pot calling a kettle black! There you are fussing
    about how your only alternative to seizing Norway was to 'throw in the
    towel', and then you complain that *I* exaggerate my woes! But you have a
    fine friend in Italy, and I have no one, for all of my erstwhile friends
    have stabbed me. Even against a united T/A you are on one team in an equal
    fight. I have no such equality. Then who can cry 'NEED' with more justice,
    you or I?
    
    
    
    Third, I must very stridently object to your use of the word 'largesse', as in,
    
    >Nwy.  But if AT stay united, should I just throw in the towel, abandon
    >center gains of my own to your largesse instead, and trust to the Fates?
    
    Largesse, is it, to execute one's promises taken in good faith? To honor
    one's straightforward agreement to one's allies? Is that largesse? Or did
    you mispeak? I must say that it is this feature of your apology that truly
    galls me.
    
    
    
    Fourth, I am not under any illusion, as you seem to think I am, that you
    and only you have sold me up the river. I am very well aware that *all
    three* of my allies have dumped the Quad alliance, and simultaneously. (You
    must understand that my wounds are aggravated by self-disgust -- how could
    I have been so stupid as to have been deceived into trusting both you and
    Cal???) If I die as a result, then if it were possible I would work ruin on
    all the three of you! (If you come up with a good way to do that, given
    that I shall have exactly three units, do explain it to me, I will be
    forever grateful.) But no, there is only one from whom I could exact any
    direct payment, and you are the one. If it comes to that. *IF*. As for the
    others, I would have to take small comfort in helping/allowing France to
    construct a large navy and Germany a large army, to the respective
    detriments of Cal and Edi.
    
    Fifth, I don't take seriously your insinuations that I may have had in mind
    to ally with Germany all along. If the insinuations were serious, let me
    know and I will address them. But I think that was a bit of
    conscience-soothing rationalization on your part. No shame, everyone does
    it. It takes a man on the brink of disaster to see through the cobwebs of
    his own mind! I speak from immediate experience, having just watched my own
    cobwebs fall away.
    
    Last, I will certainly attempt utmostly to convince Hohn that you are not
    an untrustworthy knave. His is the only quarter in which I can still deal

    The Pouch bourse game boring?  Well, at least it's being called SOMEthing.
    Since it kind of died in the water a while back, I'm glad to see that
    someone remembers it.  Rick Desper is in the process of putting it back
    together, I believe, but I've lost track of where he might be with that
    process....
    
    However, we at the Pouch are always willing to add any game (such as, need
    I spell it out, this one) to the Showcase section, which has unfortunately
    also been a great idea untended.  Since all the partial press is being saved,
    and the players are commenting on their moves, and since (with the exception
    of my own surely inadvertent exclusion :-) the players are among the most
    talented out there, this game would be a nice permanent addition to the
    Showcase.  I know that this is TAP has dibs on the thing (but only because
    you're doing all the work :-), but if you want, Jim, to also consider it for
    inclusion in the fledgling Showcase section of TDP, feel free.

    We all make choices.  You chose to go with Edi instead of
    me.  That's totally fine.  But IMO you should take
    responsibility for that decision, rather than try to play it
    off as no big deal like you did in your past letter.
    
    > But don't hand me this "chutzpah" crap, ok?
    
    Why not?  It seemed a particularly apt word, in light of
    your earlier message.
    
    > I worked in an alliance ENGENDERED BY EDI, thank you very
    > much, against a target--you.  I did what I had to do for

    No.  I'm fighting for my survival.  I'm in a position which
    your own actions forced me into.  The causation analysis
    therefore differs, as does the moral calculus.
    
    > I respect you and your moves.  Give ME some credit for my

    I fully realize you were operating under the assumption that
    there was an AR.
    
    Of course, that changes not one whit the fact that you have
    been hostile towards me, including this immediately previous
    turn, and that you've lied to me twice, and that despite
    what you said in your previous letter, your motives in going
    against Edi were not in my best interests as you claimed,
    but rather your own.
    
    As for me and Edi, I fully realize what is going on with him
    and me.  Your paragraph above is making some unwarranted
    assumptions, but since we've still not established what I
    would term a working relationship, I'm not going to tell you
    what those unwarranted assumptions are.  I hope you
    understand.
    
    > Why didn't I contact you last turn?  And say what?  "Hohn,

    That's a straw man argument, Mark.  I'm not disputing your
    actual _decision_ not to say anything to me.  Reread what I
    wrote carefully.  What I took issue with was your attempting
    to use your stab of Austria as some sort of equalizing
    device, to make us "even" as you put it.  I also used your
    silence to make the point that I could only assume that we
    were still at war.  And that's a reasonable assumption.
    
    > Sure, in hindsight the worst option happened anyway, so

    Fair enough.  Just don't seek to use your uncommunicated
    stab, which you made for reasons of your own, as some sort
    of moral leverage over me, like you did in your previous
    message.  Just because you stab Austria doesn't change the
    fact that your relationship with me has been poor so far
    this game, poor as a result of your actions.  Thus the
    necessity of seeing you take some action to repair that
    relationship, if you really want to work with me.
    
    Regardless of what Edi "planned" with you, regardless of
    what the relationship is between you and him, that doesn't
    matter overly much.  It was _your_ decision to stab me,
    plain and simple.  Edi held no gun to your head.  It was
    your decision.  Not Edi's.  And in order to repair your
    relationship with me, you're going to have to make good with
    _me_, not by pointing at some stab of a third-party.
    
    Do you understand what I'm trying to say?

    I can't say I understand what you're trying to say here.

    <shrug>
    
    I'm simply calling 'em as I see 'em.  What better place to
    do that than in a game?  I'm surprised you're taking it so
    personally, to be honest.  I certainly am not.
    
    > I overlook it  because you caveated it as "your

    That's not the point, nor is it my intent.  I'm asking you
    to take responsibility for your past actions, not to have
    you berate yourself over them.  And by doing so, by
    understanding that I will need to see you vacate BLA or make
    some other unilateral action to better our relationship
    (just as you unilaterally worsened it), we can thus move
    beyond it.
    
    I want you to reread what you wrote to me in that first
    letter this season.  You tried to play off your stab of Edi
    as some sort of big favor you were doing for me, and you
    tried to unilaterally declare that we were "even" when, as I
    mention above, what you do to a third party does not really
    have relevance to your relationship with me.  You claim
    certain motives which, although I suppose are possible, I
    find to be quite dubious in light of actual events.
    
    That's what I didn't appreciate, Mark, and that's why you
    received the response you did.
    
    > I had an ally; I did what was good for the alliance at
    > the time; the alliance is finished; I'm now trying to work
    > a deal with you.  OK?
    
    Sure.  And I told you what I needed to see from you, and
    that is honesty and a vacating of BLA.
    
    > You want me out of BLA; fine.  Where do I go?  Does it

    I will get back to you on this, as I have yet to study the
    tactical situation in depth.
    
    > As I'm sure I
    > won't be talking to him for awhile,
    
    Why?  You kept in touch with me despite our history.  Well,
    except for this immediate past season, that is.
    
    > I'll be much more in
    > touch with you (mail and phone), given that you have

    Sure.  The window opened for _you_.  And what I've been
    trying to tell you is what I'm going to need to see for that
    window to open for _me_, to cooperate with you.
    
    > The ironic thing about this is that RT--natural
    > allies--are fighting (caused by me, yes) over the same
    > thing:  Aus perfidy.
    
    I'll withhold comment on this, except to reiterate that your
    understanding is based upon certain unwarranted assumptions.
    Personally, I see no irony.
    
    > And Edi is the only one who gains
    > from it.  I'd like to change that situation, and it will
    > take us both to fix it.
    
    This is true, however, and I am in sync with your desire to
    change that situation.
    
    > I  accept your points in the letter, and hope mine wasn't
    > too blunt in reply.  I am, indeed, "willing to deal."
    
    I prefer bluntness, so long as people don't take it
    personally.  I'm certainly not.  I hope you're not, although
    I fear you might be.  And I'm glad you're willing to deal.
    Let's try to work something out, then.

    Heh, heh, heh... I'll go look at it, but remind me again how the
    Showcase section works.  When the game is over I certainly want
    to store the records on diplom.org and have them connected to the Pouch.
    
    Do you want to do a hot link for the moment to Dave Kleiman's

    I can't say I'd 'take you down'. But then again, it might not take much,
    huh? House of cards, kind of thing, by your own estimate.
    
    No, I will only do what damage I can. Er, that is: I *would* only do what
    damage I *could*. Enough, I reckon, to make taking Norway count as a
    mistake in the final ledger, when the 'ccountin's done. It would be

    Tsar Faz,
    
    I take it, then, that you are not especially optimistic about the chances
    of peace with Hohn (your own personal condition for removing the knife from
    my back).
    
    I think the upshot is, you were manipulated by Edi. That's what happened.
    He did it deliberately, and awfully well. He inadvertantly manipulated
    Italy, too, so that things may not work out so terribly well for him in the
    end.
    
    Rather than continue the various earlier points of contention, I will say
    merely that you *CAN INDEED* mend what is broken. Nothing could be easier.
    And though you would then have fewer units of your own, of course, you
    would have mine on your side rather than devoted to your pain. (Just do
    some arithmetic. Six units, but if you use five in the south you can't
    possibly hold Scandinavia, so four in the south and two against me, or if
    I'm very fortunate, against me and Pitt. Or, five units, one in the north
    with my eternal support, and again four in the south. What profit, then,
    for Norway?)
    
    If I am right that you were manipulated, then you have my sympathy. If (but
    only if) you let me take Norway, you have my endless cooperation as well.
    Otherwise,  you will have to make do with sympathy. I'm sure Caesar felt
    great sympathy for poor Brutus.

    Hi GKJ,
    Let me comment on your note; I'll asterisk my points, if that's ok...
    
    >First, I think you have overinterpreted my remarks. I do not yet think that

    >I was explaining my alternatives, that's all.
    
    ** Yes, after my recent barrages with Turkey, I've been accused of
    everything under the sun...I have a hunch this 'charge'
    (overinterpretation of your remarks) is also true, alas...
    You'll be down to three centers, "perhaps."  Much depends on how Germany
    moves.  ECH can support BRE if Germany focuses on Paris and/or  only
    goes after BEL.  The big threat to you is if he convoys Hol-Yor, as you
    can't stop it, nor dislodge Nth without him retreating to a home SC.
    But yes, I see your points.
    
    >Second, you're a fine pot calling a kettle black! There you are fussing

    ** Again, the moral and logical arguments lean toward you.  Yes, I do
    have a friend in Italy, although he can't help me much this year, other
    than force Edi to look backward as regards GRE and TRI.  Still, it IS
    more than you have at the moment.
    
    You have a need, indeed; but so do I.  And if I cede Nwy to you and go
    -1 (or worse), then do we not have the same situation in reverse (i.e.,
    a weak Eng doesn't help Russia, but does a wounded Russia do a 4- or
    5-center E any good, either)?

    ask, What happens if I give you Nwy?   Now I'm not even in the driver's
    seat as regards my own foolishness (as seen by you), but instead am
    dependent on everyone for future goodwill and support."
    And quite honestly, what's out there right now for easy Russian gain?
    That's what I meant about "largesse;" it wasn't a slam on you, who has

    ** As for all your allies dumping you:  Had Edi stuck to his guns (yeah,
    let's blame him, why not) and hit Germany, the QC probably would've

    1903 or so anyway, so I imagine a truncated France would've been left
    around anyway.  But please, please don't say you were "stupid" to trust
    both Cal and I.  Cal means you no ill will, and neither do I.  My
    decision to take Nwy came from Austrian unease, and was submitted about
    two days prior to due date.  It wasn't some long-term simmering plan to
    hose you.  You are definitely not a stupid player.  Again (to make Edi
    the bogeyman), had Austria not engendered such mistrust and fear on
    Cal's part (and mine)--and had he shown some willingness to really make
    the QC work--this would be a different ballgame, and no one would've
    dumped you.  It's a sin of omission, rather than of comission, I think
    (although still lousy for you).

    Hohn is weaving his own crap, quite frankly, but if there is any "moral
    high ground" in this game, I'm certainly not occupying it in dealing
    with him.

    >Gosh. Your food poisoning has left *me* with an upset stomach.
    
    Heh...actually, the plan was pretty much finalized before I fell ill.  I
    just wasn't able to implement it on time as a result.
    
    >Hm, you appear to be in a pretty good position. And to all appearances, Edi
    >has manipulated all of my erstwhile allies while I was sleeping.
    
    Well, as I know you know better than most, nothing is carved in stone.  My
    defection from our early EG alliance shows that.  I am always willing to
    consider any plan which I believe maximizes my chances of success.  Please
    don't think that we are now quits (at least not as far as I'm concerned).
    
    FWIW, I felt compelled to take this action because I saw myself getting the
    *very* short end of the stick in our alliance.  The way it looked to me,
    you were going to get BRE, NOR, POR, and possibly SPA, while I got PAR.  I
    had originally expected to get BEL, too, which would have been a more
    equitable distribrution but you grabbed it in 1901 instead of NOR, which
    was not a violation of any agreement we had (due an oversight on *my* part)
    but was certainly, in my opinion, a violation of the spirit of our
    alliance.  Frankly, I expected to be at the top of a very short list for
    your next target and I saw a pre-emptive strike as my only alternative.
    
    >I wonder whether you can get a big chunk out of me before he finds he needs
    >something for all of those armies to do. I don't think you can. We shall

    I'm sensitive to the situation.  However, I felt I had no other choice.  I
    considered broaching the subject with you but I ultimately decided not to
    because I thought it would accomplish nothing other than tipping my hand.
    If I was wrong in that assumption, I apologize.  I won't insult you by
    telling you that I'm now going to pull back and pretend it never happened
    but I hope that we can still talk and, if the opportunity presents itself,
    perhaps work together again (on a more equitable basis, of course).

    I don't blame you.  Of course, as you say, Edi's more or less just doing
    what you planned to do but Hohn found Edi more suitable based on your 1901
    actions, I assume...  Can't really blame Hohn, either, he's just trying to
    stay alive.
    
    >Edi, master that he is, once again beat me to the punch.   Any
    >suggestions on what to do down south?
    
    Well, I didn't know that this was going to happen but I'm not surprised,
    either.  Hohn tried early on to get me to attack you to relieve the
    pressure on him.  When I politely demurred, Edi was his only other option.
    Frankly, I expected Edi to go after Cal because I thought you and Edi were
    in cahoots.  At this point, I think the best ideas would be a) for you to
    try to get Cal to slip a shiv into Edi's back and b) begin to patch things
    up with Hohn.  Once you start that, I can continue to stay in touch with
    Hohn and, as appropriate, subtly point out the danger that Edi poses.  If
    any of these work, it should help you out down south.

    I'm counting on that, Faz.  I need to focus my efforts westward.  I will
    endeavor to be sure that you and I both maintain a friendly, non-tempting
    border, of course (allies is allies but an open invitation is just asking
    for it...I don't plan on asking for it) but I truly do hope that we can
    continue to build on the foundation we've laid so far.  If we do so
    successfully, we'll both be in good position to profit and to deal with
    problems elsewhere.

    Monsieur
    Thanks for the reply.  I didn't want to overly stress Russia's role in
    helping you--merely wanted to say that "you have a friend in court" here
    in StP.  I will help you as much as I can, and I ask but one favor in
    return:  FI peace, to allow the reduction of traitorous Austria.
    
    Edi has the Gaul (snicker) to ask me to go Gal-Sil, rebuild the
    destroyed RUM (thanks to him) in Mos, and head vs Pitt!!  "It is to
    laugh," as they say.
    
    In fact, I have a second favor:  if you could put in a plug/good word
    for Russia when you next speak to the Sultan, life would be just ducky.
    He and I have had some acrimonious exchanges, but I want to get past the
    words, realize the joint Austrian threat, and have him link with me.
    I'd appreciate any "character references" if you could, kind sir.

    he then proceeds to say, "Russia will be at 6," and "I've manuevered to
    allow myself maximum flexibility for the tactical situation, i.e., Bul
    and Rum)."  ((So not only does he aid you in taking my center, but now
    he plans to take it from you and advance to seven centers.))
    
    Quite honestly, Hohn, I can see the same frustration in dealing with Edi
    (at this time) that you obviously had with me.  God has repaid me in
    spades for the hassles I've caused.
    
    I would like RUM back, there's no doubt; I need a build in the event
    Germany does indeed come marching eastward next turn.  BUT:
    whatever I can do to support you somewhere, anywhere (Bud, Bul, etc) AND
    get out of BLA, I'll do it.    Ideally I'd like to take RUM with the
    fleet, and/or support you to BUL again, but I'm open to your
    ideas...convoyng Arm out, whatever...
    
    One (prelim) option:   (ASSUMES Italian moves on Tri and Gre)
    1) Rum-Bul (Bla and Con S), Ank S Con, Arm-Smy
    Sev-Rum (Ukr S), Gal-Bud
     or perhaps
    2) Rum-Bud (Gal S), Bla-Rum (Sev S), Ukr S Gal????
    
    Consider me a friend.  (No sugar-coating on the words, either.)  I mean,
    we either smash Edi before he goes up to 7, or you guys stay together
    and smash my south.  If the latter happens, "ugliness for all" will
    occur, guaranteed.

    Pitt,
    
    >FWIW, I felt compelled to take this action because I saw myself getting the
    >*very* short end of the stick in our alliance.  The way it looked to me,
    >you were going to get BRE, NOR, POR, and possibly SPA, while I got PAR.
    
    Ahem.
    You've already stabbed me, we can be honest about the past now!
    
    I wasn't going to get Spain unless I went off to fight Italy; presumably
    you wouldn't object to *that*. Counting Norway in the division of France is
    not terribly plausible, either. (Why not count Denmark?)
    
    Por and Bre vs Par, true, I was getting two and you one. Doesn't seem so
    unreasonable. The truth is, had I decided to ally with Italy next (I was
    unsure), I would have let him take Mar, Spa, and Por, all three. I probably
    would have let him have Por anyway, and decided after that whether to
    snatch it back and sail into the Med., or let him keep it to fuel a war
    against Austria, and go attack you or Russia. Well, no point thinking about
    *those* options!
    
    However, you decided you could get more by going for my throat. Yeah, you
    may well be right about that! The big difference, though, (I mean the other
    big difference, getting more is a big difference!) is that by engaging
    France you would have been in and out with a quick gain, ready for another
    fight; unless I miss my mark, your attack on me will take a whole lot
    longer. You've just got to hope that the battle between Austria and Russia
    takes a long time, too.
    
    
    >had originally expected to get BEL, too, which would have been a more
    >equitable distribrution but you grabbed it in 1901 instead of NOR, which
    >was not a violation of any agreement we had (due an oversight on *my* part)

    >your next target and I saw a pre-emptive strike as my only alternative.
    
    Well, I had no firm plan for what to do after France, had it gone that way.
    You were in the middle of a medium-sized list, let's say. :) I always
    expect I'm somewhere on everyone's list.
    
    I'm surprised to hear what you thought about Bel, though.
    
    
    >I'm sensitive to the situation.  However, I felt I had no other choice.  I
    >considered broaching the subject with you but I ultimately decided not to
    >because I thought it would accomplish nothing other than tipping my hand.
    >If I was wrong in that assumption, I apologize.
    
    Oh, your most gracious apology is most graciously accepted, fully in the
    spirit in which it was intended. :)
    
    You just haven't been very active talking in this game, that's all. So you
    have to play more strategically and less diplomatically. I was playing more
    diplomatically, which turned out to be a serious mistake, because I never
    did manage to get a 'feel' for any of the postal players. (Obviously? Do
    you realize that Russia and Italy just stabbed me, too? And as for Edi,
    well it's really all his fault, everything. I'm sure of it. I just don't
    know how.)
    
    
    >I won't insult you by
    >telling you that I'm now going to pull back and pretend it never happened
    >but I hope that we can still talk and, if the opportunity presents itself,
    >perhaps work together again (on a more equitable basis, of course).
    
    Hm.
    
    Obviously, I am in pretty dire straights. I'll tell you, if we have to wait
    and see if a long shot comes in and I do ok, and then you want to be
    friends again, that seems really extremely unlikely. If I manage hold out
    until Russia or Austria come for you, I doubt I'll have any incentive to
    help. Well, who knows?
    
    But you are kind of suggesting that *I* come up with some alternative, and
    you'll consider it. Ok, I will. (I'll need a day or two. There's a chance
    that I could actually come up with a *good* alternative, so I won't have to
    tell you an absurd story, but I'll have to do some investigation first.)
    
    By the way, in case it's not obvious: I don't really blame you at all. My
    judgment of the situation doesn't exactly agree with yours, but your stab
    does seem fairly reasonable given your fairly reasonable assessment of the
    situation. (This distinguishes you from Italy and Russia in my book :)).
    
    Still Gentle, but now only *per force*,

    Hello Hohn
    Take your time analyzing the moves.  I _know_ the Bla Sea sticks in your
    craw, and I'd like to move it; it's just figuring out where.  And for
    this turn, anyway, its utility might be better used as an extra support
    piece, vice a fleet-on-the-coast (Rum or Bul).
    
    But I'm (finally) sensitive to your wishes, and your moves have nothing
    to fault them; I'm not trying to sway you with my moves or
    anything--just thought a few more options might be nice.
    
    Let me know what you think (tomorrow, per your note), and we can hash it
    out.
    
    I've contacted Cal and asked for his plans & ideas.  If Edi is really
    sweating (and not just faking it), then he's going to pull out all the
    stops to hose me by enlisting you (stab time?) or getting Italy to "see
    the RT danger" and cool his jets.  Frankly, I can't see Cal doing
    anything BUT hitting Edi, but Austria is a silver-tongued devil...
    
    Will anticipate your reply tomorrow; thanks.

    Hohn,
    A quick postscript.   Without getting overly gushy, I'd like to thank
    you for your style of play and for your willingness (or seeming
    willingness) to "stay the course" with Russia this game.  Edi (here we
    go again!) painted you as THE Wonderchild of the board, an expert, savvy
    diplomat (and it's true, naturally, but he overplayed it to bring in the
    Unknown Bogeyman fear).   From there it was easy to jump on the
    bandwagon and try my deeds.  Luckily for me, you've played this thing
    calmly and rationally, and it's much appreciated up here in St
    Petersburg.
    
    I don't know where (if) you ever heard of me (I knew nothing of you,
    Jamie or John before we started), but if you did, you'd know I was a
    strong alliance player for the first 10 years of my Dip playing.  Oh,
    I'd stab once every three or four (REAL) years, but my style tended to
    gravitate toward 17-17 ties, the feeling of tension as we both tried for
    the tie (and looked over our shoulders for a stab), etc.  Not really the
    'correct' style of play, of course, but I play for fun..._intense_ fun,
    but fun nonetheless.  If I have an ally--one that I say (and know) is
    indeed my ally--then I'm usually the stabee, not the stabber.  Only in
    the last 4 or 5 years have I tried to be a "normal" player, and
    truthfully, I am hideously rusty at stabs and such.  I have a lot to
    learn regarding timing...but I'll manage -grin-.
    
    Anyway, thanks for the moves, the "up front" philosophy a la Hohn, and
    the desire to see this through.  Time will tell if you're spoofing me or
    if you're sincere, but I sense it's the latter...haven't had anything to
    the contrary since game-start!   And while I admire the heck out of
    everyone this game, it would give me "great joy" to have Edi's greed
    repaid in spades.
    
    Thanks.

    Hello again Hohn
    Thanks for the note.  I'm ok.  My back was wiped out last Friday, when =
    we had a Department party at the ice skating rink.  I went on skates =
    (and my knees!) for the first time, and then played broomball, a =
    tennis-shoe-on-the-ice version of hockey.  I fell hard on my back and =
    got body-wide muscle spasms, so says the doc.  The bottom line:  a =

    old, and "paid the price."  I'm now "Mr Medication."   Thanks for =
    inquiring.
    
    Thanks for the move validations.  I'm going to send them in today or =
    tomorrow.  They're fine, and what I consider "locked and cocked" for RT =
    action.  I think we're going to wake up the board big-time when this =
    happens, Hohn.  We should have some fun getting the Observers to rewire =
    their jaws after they drop to the ground.  (Of course, I haven't seen =
    much Observer commentary to date, so perhaps this may be the catalyst.)
    
    Fear not worrying over a "thrid stab."  Having failed miserably on the =

    mine with bad-guy Edi's support has made me a total convert to the need =
    for equal partnership.  Short of you stabbing me, Russia will be =
    extremely harmless (and benevolent) toward his Turkish partner.
    
    What do you do, btw, that you're in at work past midnight?  Software =

<p><a name=40></a><b>Private message from <font color=bbbb00>Turkey</font> to <font color=000000>Master</font>:</b><pre>
    Jim,
    
    Thoughts on this past turn and my negotiations prior to the
    upcoming turn.
    
    I can't tell you what a thrill it was to demolish Russia's A
    RUM.  Feelings like that are why I play Diplomacy.  Edi came
    through, like I was hoping he would.  And in light of Cal's
    and Mark's perfidy, I suspect Edi will stay with me.  I've
    tried to paint myself as the only reliable neighbor he has,
    which has, aside from Spring 1901, been true.  I think he'll
    run with that, again, due at least in part to our past
    history together.
    
    I didn't particularly like Edi's move to BUL, but he had
    disclosed it prior to last turn, so I knew it was coming.  I
    debated arguing against that move, but I decided that since
    whether he would go with me was still very much in doubt, I
    didn't want to make any waves.  Such is often the fate of a
    junior partner.  I also figured he could take BUL from me if
    he wanted, anyway.  As it turns out, if Edi does in fact
    stay with me, his army in BUL will be quite useful, so it
    hopefully turned out fine.
    
    My diplomatic strategy has consisted of taking an initial
    hard line against Mark and Cal (particularly Mark), for
    several reasons:
    
    1) I suspected strongly that any flowery messages from me
    would be dismissed as less than credible, in light of my
    past tone and my poor history so far with Mark;
    
    2) It was kinda fun and satisfying to write those hardline
    letters ;) ;
    
    3) I figured the worst case scenario was that I'd antagonize
    him and he and I would remain at war, which was no surprise
    or big tragedy; and
    
    4) I thought the hardline, coupled with more no-nonsense
    talk and concrete proposals (including the "get out of BLA"
    bit, which I thought was pretty inspired and believable,
    even though I wasn't overly concerned about it) would create
    a better chance that Mark might actually follow-through for
    once, and make him believe I'd follow through as well.  To
    be honest, I think he'll believe me.  I've spent a lot of
    time with him building up my credibility.  And now that I
    have, I'm going to use it all up, hoping to make a coup in
    SEV.  If I can blow him out of there, coupled with another
    risky move or two, he's going to be hurting.  And I'll build
    F ANK and blow him out of BLA, too.  This is a critical
    juncture, and if my gambit fails, well, such is life.
    Considering my less-than-ideal position, I have to take some
    risks.
    
    Cal has been silent so far.  I'm going to call him right
    before deadline, in an effort to get him to turn around. Edi
    has suggested that I take a "point of honor" type position
    with Cal, that I feel compelled to go after Mark in light of
    his past perfidy, and I think I agree with Edi, that that's
    the right tack.  Since I don't know Cal, I'm trusting Edi's
    word for it, but since Cal turning around is in Edi's best
    interest, I see no reason why Edi would lie to me.  As for
    the late phone call, I'm hoping that the natural laziness of
    all people coupled with perhaps a sense of apathy towards
    Mark will prevent him from calling Mark to tip him off.  And
    I'm hoping that Mark won't be checking his e-mail. ;) Again,
    are these meta-game considerations, and perhaps improper
    stratagems?  Personally, I don't think so, any more than
    listing a game to see which particular powers are late and
    taking that into consideration is against PBEM rules.  Or
    submitting two sets of orders (one of which was shown to
    another player, ostensibly to "prove" goodwill) in FTF play.
    Etc. etc.
    
    Aside from that, I fear Pitt.  His growth promises to be
    impressive, and I suspect he'll do well in this game.  I'm
    only hoping I'm around long enough to do something about it.

    Well, to be fair, I think Edi has a general policy of
    calling everyone every turn.  Nice to have free phone calls
    on Fridays! ;)

    Sorry; work has been hell lately.  I was at work until after
    midnight each of the last three days.
    
    Let's go with your proposal.  To make sure there's no
    confusion, I understand that proposal to be:
    
    RUM-BUL
    CON S RUM-BUL
    ANK S CON
    ARM-SMY
    
    BLA S RUM-BUL
    SEV-RUM
    UKR S SEV-RUM
    GAL-VIE (coupled with Italian VEN S VIE-TRI)
    
    Please confirm.
    
    Although it's probably needless to say, I'll say it anyway:
    having been "bitten" once (the second time I didn't bite, so
    I won't hold that against you), I obviously won't take
    kindly to being bitten again.  In fact, that'd pretty much
    finish us for the rest of this game, Mark.  No, no "pretty
    much" about it; it'd definitely finish us, at least as far
    as I'm concerned.
    
    But anyway, enough dire predictions.  Let's do it.  Then,
    after Edi's gone, we can roll over Cal as a long-deferred RT
    juggernaut.  Much to everyone else's shock and amazement, I
    suspect. ;)

    Hello Hohn
    How's everything going?  I've been hearing from Edi (he apparently
    called Thu night, so he says, and definitely called last night--I slept
    through it due to medication for my back).  So he's serious (qualify
    that term, of course) about trying to keep his comm lines open and
    wheel-and-deal.  I'm not buying it, Hohn.
    
    Hopefully you've had a chance to analyze the move proposals; again, I'm
    willing to try just about anything to prove my "change of attitude."
    (Naturally, paranoia runs in when I hear lots from Edi and a little
    silence from you.)
    
    Let me know what you want to do; I can send the moves anytime before
    Monday.

    Hi Cal
    No, I don't think you spilled the beans to Edi; in fact, it was more of
    a pointed barb at Eng, who cries "foul" quite often, but wouldn't
    surprise me as planning our joint demise in the ling run, only to see it
    all come apart.  I agree that Italy would've benefited MUCH more from
    successful Russian moves, vice this last turn setback.  My big concern
    is AG cooperation.  Maybe I'm overly paranoid, but the two "Grand
    Masters of the Order" don't seem to worry about their collective
    backsides, despite Pitt's earlier big-time worries about an AR attack on
    him.   And they they surprisingly head in oppositie directions, both to
    great gain for themselves.   A little unsettling...
    
    I think we're on the right track here.  One thing you can think of would
    be Ven S Vie-Tri, if we both figure he'll try a bounce on tri or
    something,,,might enable me to get into Tri (or Bud), rather than Edi
    just bouncing you and standing pat.  Much to decide, but I want to hear
    if Turjey has anything of merit to mention....I think he may be
    malleable for a turn or two, but in the long-run, trust me or you?
    yeah, right (and vice versa, of course)!
    
    Hang in there, partner.

    'retrospectively' was quoting me. "win English kudos", quoting ...???
    
    All I was saying is that it is much too soon to be insisting that the move
    was justified by the outcome. Of course, all moves are justified by their
    ultimate outcomes, since this is a game with winners and loser, etc. So the
    end always justifies the means, I suppose. All I meant is that the end is
    not in sight, so the assessment of the moves is yet unripe.

    :-) :-) :-) What a straight line.

    I know. Ok, ahem, I really didn't mean to harp on this, I really only meant
    to register my take on it one time. I know that you both understand my
    view, and I don't really have any intention of trying to convince you of
    its correctness. I honestly don't want you guys to think I'm off stewing
    about it. I'm moving on, too. That's the beauty of the game, huh? It's fun
    to get mad, and the dynamics inflame the passions, but it's also easy to
    let go of it.
    
    >Hmmm...makes you
    >wonder if someone didn't tip him off, or if he was just plain greedy and
    >planned this all himself.  (I'll go with the latter).
    
    Hey, hey. Just WHAT are you insinuating?
    
    
    >I will indeed talk to F and point out the logic of having friendly EF
    >relations (I've already mentioned--twice--the benefits AND RUSSIAN

    Good, yes, that low-key, general kind of thing seems best. Plant the seed,
    let him draw the conclusions himself.
    
    It really does help when the point on which you're trying to convince him
    is *true*.
    
    >   Pitt is the great

    Ok. (Actually, I don't understand what you said, but I know I'm not
    supposed to thank you. I also love your construction, "If you listen to
    Edi...." I feel that one could fill in the dots there with pretty much any
    sentence in English :) "If you listen to Edi, monkeys make the best
    diplomats. If you listen to Edi, the moon is made of green cheese. If you
    listen to Edi, you're a bigger fool than I ever imagined.")
    
    Yeesh, three more messages since I started typing this one. Interesting,
    Cal and I each thought ourselves the target of Mark's insinuation of a 'tip
    off', and it turns out he meant Pitt!
    
    Only one other thing from those three recent notes: drawing conclusions
    based on a paucity of information distinguishes us from computers?? Only if
    we do it well! The only hunch I like here is that Hohn is a good player,
    and, well, was that really a hunch? Oh well. I have my own hunches.

    Hmm, was that an accusation?  After all, only you and I knew about our
    intended moves.  Suffice it to say, I categorically deny the charge.  I
    would have been in much better position had your moves worked.
    
    In my previous note, I mentioned how I acted on a hunch.  Well, the
    info I based it on was simply this: Hohn is definitely a very good
    player.
    After the initial Russian/Austrian perfidy in S01, I did not hear word
    one from him.  Mark said he was getting only static from Turkey.  This
    leaves only Edi that Hohn could profitably be talking to.  Since the
    silence stretched out for a couple of turns, this implied that they
    were doing a LOT of talking.  Since Edi's notes to me were becoming
    infrequent, I drew the only conclusion I could.  An A/T was in the
    works.
    Since I was being stone-walled in the west, I thought it was in my best
    interest to see that Edi and Hohn did not have a free rein against Mark.
    Once he went down, *I* was the obvious next target for A/T.  hence my
    attack

    Guys:
    Just commenting on Cal's last entry in his note (below):
    
    >Pitt contacted me and said that he and I have "interesting possibilities
    >to discuss". I'll wait to see what he has in mind before deciding how to
    >approach him about easing off on you.
    
    ** My only concern is that, somehow at the bottom of this all, my
    reassurances to Pitt about not attacking him were passed on to Edi, thus
    giving Edi the "alert" that the plan was changing.   What's the big
    deal?  I don't put it past Edi & Pitt doing the "diverging expansion"
    routine and really being the ultimate allies here,
    
    Cal, please be careful about what exactly you deal with Pitt on (I know,
    I'm preaching to the choir), and make sure he doesn't completely
    "dilute" your anti-Aus attack.  if he's pro-Aus, he might talk you away
    from hitting Edi by offering golden fleece in France or elsewhere.....
    But whatever you can gain--from whomever--have at it, mon ami!
    
    Hang in there, GKJ.

    Oh, I agree.  I certainly wish the QC was still going strong and Edi HAD
    hit
    Germany and Mark & I HADN'T had to make our pre-emptive strikes.
    
    Unfortunately, that's all in the past.  This is a (VERY) fast flowing
    game
    and we "gots to go wid the flow".

    Well, reaching a conclusion with a paucity of information is what makes
    us
    different from computers, no?  Whether we acted on full info or not,
    both
    Mark and I had a feeling that Edi was going to do something distinctly
    non-kosher last turn.  We acted on this hunch and it turned out we were
    right.
    I've been playing this game for 24 years and I've learned to listen to
    my
    hunches.

    I've already written to France and suggested that Pitt is about to grow
    too strong too fast.  Since this game has been very much a case of
    "stop the (perceived) leader", I can only hope he'll go for it (or at
    least
    consider it...).
    
    Pitt contacted me and said that he and I have "interesting possibilities
    to discuss". I'll wait to see what he has in mind before deciding how to
    approach him about easing off on you.

    For what it's worth, England has been deluging me with "Life is so
    unfair" notes, so I doubt that the "fix" is in.
    
    I don't know how you play the game in terms of dealing with him wot just
    stabbed you, but have you thought about trying to work with England?
    The way the game is shaping up now, Germany is going to be the REAL
    power on the board in about a year.  Once England is gone, Russia is
    probably Germany's next target, but how long can he afford to have you
    behind him?  This is going to be hell's own "balance of power" style
    game, so you really ought to
    consider what I've said.

    Hi Pitt
    I apologize for the delay in writing anything "meaty" to you as of late.
     Classes are rather involved right about now (testing, papers, etc), and
    free time is minimal.  Hope you're feeling better, btw.
    
    Edi has been burning up the phone lines to try and get me to 'see the G
    danger', "give him freedom of maneuever,"  etc etc.  He wants me out of
    GAL, wants me to rebuild in WAR, put two on you in 1903, and allow him
    the leverage he needs to take care of Turkey.  Who's he been kidding?
    As I see it, I've got a hostile Turkey (he and I have exchanged some
    blistering letters), a weasel in Austria, and an unknown quantity in
    Italy.  (Yes, I expect Italy to hit GRE and TRi this turn--at least I'm
    hoping for that!  But Edi IS a silver-tongued devil...).  Edi tells me
    you're a "vulture" player who will sense my weakenss and send forces vs
    me next year.   I don't buy that, and I figure you'll prefer a
    strong(er) Russia holding off AT, vice a house-of-cards Russia that dies
    while you're pestering E and/or F.
    
    Eng is upset; France non-committal, and the East is, well, the East.
    Hence my desire for RG stability and continued friendship.  I hope you
    see it the same way.
    
    Well, anyway, time's up; I have tests to collate.  Take care, and let me
    know how you see things.
    
    Best
    Mark

    Gentle People
    The news isn't the best, and I agree that the QC would've been MUCH
    better for us all had it continued.  And the game would've had a certain
    joi de vivre of 'difference' from the same-old startup alliances and
    whatnot.
    
    Having said that, I will revert to a recent Monkees' song, "That was
    then; this is now."
    
    Whether IR will 'retrospectively' "win English kudos" for making the
    correct move remains to be seen.  Quite honestly, my biggest Dip flaw is
    that i tunnel-vision for the short-term tactical, vice plan for the
    long-term strategic (you think I'd learn after 20+ years...-grin-).
    Right now, breaking off to hit Edi, aligned with Cal, was, in my mind,
    both necessary and justified, given Edi's moves.  Hmmm...makes you
    wonder if someone didn't tip him off, or if he was just plain greedy and
    planned this all himself.  (I'll go with the latter).
    
    I will indeed talk to F and point out the logic of having friendly EF
    relations (I've already mentioned--twice--the benefits AND RUSSIAN
    DESIRE--of friendly Franco-Italian relations).   Pitt is the great
    unknown at this point.  If you listen to Edi, he's going to build 2 and
    come a-callin' on me next year.  If that happens, Jamie, I've just
    'indirectly' saved you (please, don't thank me now...)
    
    Cal, hope you're feeling better (real-life), and that your moves are
    "gainful" for you soon.  I will be telling Germany that I'm knee-deep in
    an AT, and that if I go down quick in the Balkans, he'll be faced with
    Edi and Hohn.  Could encourage him to join in the "Russian spoils," of
    course, but it may buy time while he futzes with F...or E.
    
    Anyway, rest assured that I'll try and make the best of this sticky
    wicket for us all.  Barring that, I want to make life a living inferno
    for Edi.

    No kidding! Well, go figure, there's a significant difference between us, then.
    I think practically anything a person could say is part of this game.
    When I'm betrayed, I'll complain about it, too, you can bet on that! You
    are free to call it 'guilt trips' if you like, of course, that's also part
    of the game.

    :)
    
    In a way.
    
    I think it's quite obvious that the present situation is worse for all four
    of us than the situation would have been if all four of us had continued
    with the plan. I blame you collectively, not individually. I thought the
    'put on an unusual show' ethos was a good one, and that it would be a much
    better game, and certainly better for *us* if all four of us had taken it
    seriously.
    Given that the two of you broke away, I certainly agree that Edi's move was
    a good for him (and mutatis mutandis for Russia's moves, and also but
    somewhat less clearly for your moves, Cal).
    
    Whether these moves will turn out to be in your 'enlightened
    self-interests' remains to be seen. I believe you have reached your
    conclusion with a severe paucity of information, always dangerous. If you
    win, I'll retrospectively grant your point. Off hand, my best guess is that
    you have just *diminished* your chance of a good ending. But it's awfully
    hard to say at this point.
    
    Gosh, it's becoming pretty clear that we don't have much of anything real
    to say to each other now, huh? Maybe the General Theory of Diplomacy is
    better discussed in the Newsgroup.
    
    
    >I wish you luck and will do (diplomatically) what I can to help.
    
    That hadn't occurred to me. Thanks for the offer. Let me think....
    
    If you get a chance, the line to sell Pitt is probably that you expect to
    be tied up against Austria and Turkey indefinitely, and that the faster he
    can arrange to tackle Austria, the better. Hm. It's delicate. Well, my main
    idea is that if Pitt wants centers *fast*, he should go for them in France;
    but if he wants a *lot* of centers and doesn't care about how soon they
    come, he should just dismantle me instead. So I'd like other diplomats to
    suggest that Pitt should feel in a hurry. There are all kinds of reasons he
    might have, of course. He might think that Russia will be done with Austria
    sooner than it appears and has Germany in mind. Or he might think that
    Austria will be held still for a couple of years and that the way to cross
    the stalemate line is to prepare to invade Vienna before the southeast
    gells.
    
    
    The line for France, I dunno. Ok, I'll tell you what my line was. I pointed
    out that Germany would be a huge power, and a huge threat, if the present
    tendencies continue, and asked whether he (John) thought he'd be allowed to
    keep Paris. My feeling here is that it really is in France's best interests
    to make peace with England, but that he (quite reasonably) doesn't trust me
    any farther than he can throw me. Hm. Maybe Mark would be a better person
    to approach France. He could express grave worries about Germany, and
    speculate that if things go ok for a while Russia would be glad to prevent
    England, which would be a relatively small power even in the best
    situation, from stabbing France (again). Well, anything either of you can
    think of would be appreciated. I wrote to both Pitt and John, but they
    aren't responding.

    I agree.  Despite your "exchange" with Hohn, he seems at least willing
    to
    consider an attack on Edi.  I have a gut feeling he WON'T however, as
    he'll
    decide not to trust us again.  I will keep working on him as best as I
    can.

    I'm already trying to sell Edi on the idea of he and I working together
    against Hohn.  I told him my moves last turn were simply, in my mind,
    pre-emptive and that I hadn't done him any real physical harm.  I'll let
    you know if he bites.
    
    In the meantime, the moves I'm favouring are f ion-adr; f tyn-ion; a
    ven-tri;
    a nap-apu, but that's far from final yet.

    I'm talking to both John & Pitt right now, but I don't know how good it
    looks.
    John has already asked me if I'd mind if he'd build F Mar so as to take
    it to
    Mid and fight against England (yeah, uh huh, right).  I'm still waiting
    to
    hear from Pitt (he did write and say he'd talk to me when I'm feeling

    Thanx guy.  At the moment, I'm not feeling too bad, so I'm trying to get
    at
    least a few letters cleared up.
    
    I think the rather drastic moves in the East last turn have put you in
    the
    driver's seat for this game (of course, the way this game has played,
    who knows
    how long THAT will last, eh?).  Since I don't see this as threatening to
    me, at
    least in the short term, I'd be quite willing for us to work together,
    even
    if it's only at the strategic level for now.
    
    Probably of most importance to me at this time is the disposition of
    France
    once England is out of the way.  Should he continue to work with you,
    his
    next obvious route of expansion is thru the Med toward ME.  I don't find
    this particularly appealing, to say the least.  Any suggestions (he
    said slyly...)?

    Um, well, yeah, it would create BIG TIME misgivings for me.  Given the
    way the
    game has progressed so far, it would seem obvious that, if you stick
    with
    Germany, your next move after England would be to come back through the
    Med.
    I would have a very hard time seeing a French fleet in the Med so
    quickly.
    
    However, there's little I can do about it.  As hard as Edi is trying to
    get
    me to turn BACK against you, I don't consider that a viable option.  My
    lot
    is now cast where it probably should have been right from the start - in
    the East.  Therefore, if you build a fleet in Marseilles, I have little
    to
    say about it.  If you think you'll have to make that fleet build, I'd
    feel
    more comfortable if the rest of your forces were as committed as
    possible
    in the north.
    
    Anyway, this is about as much writing as my health will allow.  Forgive
    me
    if it seems a bit incoherent. Coherency isn't my strong point right now.
    :)

    I really don't think that guilt trips are part of the game, at least not
    at
    this level.  This is a game of enlightened self-interest, and you
    certainly
    can't discard the fact that all three of us, Edi, Mark and myself were
    RIGHT
    in the moves we made.  If Edi hadn't made the moves he did, he'd be
    toast
    right now.  Same goes for Mark and for me (although if *I* hadn't moved
    the
    way I did, it would also be Mark who would be in trouble.  Okay, BIGGER
    trouble)

    Well, I kind of hate the idea of still having you in BLA (I

    like about it is that I'm almost guaranteed BUL, and between

    After that long discussion concerning observer press there seems to be a
    roaring silence.  Let me for one change that...
    
    Executive Summary of Spring 1902 position
    
    I don't know what the heck is going on here.
    
    Discussion
    
    Subject 1.  The West
    
    At first I thought that England and Germany were going to beat the crap out of
    France and leave his bones to the vultures by 1903.  Now it looks like Germany
    is going to be dining on roast beef and Yorkshire pudding.  How else to
    explain DEN-NTH and the attack on BEL?
    
    If E defends EDI with NWG and Germany lets him move back then R can move
    NOR-NWG.  And then EDI is lost soon enough.
    BEL is lost no matter what E does.
    BRE is lost no matter what E does.  Unless G helps defend it, and if G is now
    out for E, then why should he help.  So BRE is lost.
    
    Or is this all just a planned ruse to deceive the French?
    
    Subject 2.  Italy
    
    What does Italy want?  At first I thought that I was allied with A against T.
    Then I thought I was heading west to get some French wine.
    
    Now it looks like Italy has a hankering for some Vienna pastry.
    
    But could there be a convoy NAP-ION-AEG-SMY in store?  I don't think so.
    If I and A were in cahoots I would have expected PIE-TYR (then TYR-BOH) rather
    than PIE-VEN.
    
    
    Subject 3.  The East
    
    Looks like A has turned T's initial attack on R into an alliance.
    
    But it looks like I is riding to R's rescue.  (See above.)
    
    Well I certainly have a headache about now.  Where are the aspirin?
    
    God I love this game.

    Hi Cal,
    Just wanted to drop a short note and say THANKS AGAIN for moving as you
    did.  I think it's pretty obvious from Edi's moves that we did the right
    thing (Eng's previous e-mail note notwithstanding).
    
    I think we should press to have Turkey work with us vs Edi.  Yes, it
    will cause him growth, but hopefully delayed growth, and thus give us
    both time to maximize our tactical position and get stuff ourselves.  I
    say this without knowing Turkey's true intentions--for all I know, there
    could be a long-term AT being played out right now, to crush us while
    we're apart.  But if I have to vouch for the devil (T) to fight Hitler
    (A), then I'll do it on a temporary basis....one foe at a time.
    
    We have to think of good moves for you.  The logical ones are Ion-Gre
    and Ven-Tri, for they force Edi to use two of his units to cover (or
    risk having you take them).
    
    Another otion is for you to do:
    Ion C Apu-Alb
    Ven S Vie (or Bud)-Tri, figuring he might try and stand you out...of
    course, then it's a guessing game.
    
    This move would be in conjunction with "nasty" press to Edi from you,
    making it unequivocal that you're going to those centers.  The idea
    being, Edi covers uselessly, while you get ALB and force Gre or Tri in
    '03.
    
    Another idea is for you to "see the light," to fall in with Edi's logic,
    and realize how silly you were to listen to Faz or Jamie, and how the
    Birsan Way is the enlightened way, etc etc...in other words, tell him
    that you and he should make a team vs RT..   AND THEN STAB HIM!
    Edi will either seriously clutch at your straw (and you thus hose him),
    or he will still cover against you anyway, but now you've made him spend
    double the anguish in trying to decipher your goodwill.   Mind game
    stuff.
    
    I'll help you anyway I can, Cal.  The rat made the right moves last
    time, which precludes us from easy, adjacent-force grabs together...at
    least for this year.  But we need to finish him off, AND for you and
    France to achieve a single alliance vs G in the long run.  I would think
    John would be glad to expel someone with two units in his home country,
    and who may grow even more next fall....
    
    Take care; let me know what you think.   Death to Austria!

    Gents
    Thanks for GKJ's last missive.  Edi has been burning the comm lines to
    me more in one day, than he did when we were "allied."  He now wants to
    call me because "obviously, we aren't in sync on this, and he wants room
    to maneuver."  And, oh, btw, "RUM is lost (to Russia) for now."  So says
    he.
    
    Hohn and I have had some severe words (all within game constraints,
    natch), but I may see light at the end of the tunnel.  The ideal world
    is having him and Edi blow their mutual brains out, but for now I'd take
    him on and have Edi dealt a crippling blow.
    
    Edi's latest notes are a scream to read.  I am the one who "stabbed"
    three of my four neighbors.  I Edi really "hasn't done anything to
    Turkey, and vice versa," and, given my intransigence, he's going to
    'stick with Turkey for the time being until things cool down.'  His
    going-in position:  no mention of gains for me; Edi possibly grabs Rum
    (in addition to BUL), and he wants me to (a) call off Cal, and (b) get
    out of GAL.  His moves?  Who knows?  I wonder why I even got suckered
    into this.
    
    Jamie, the "abandonment" of the QC by RI was timed for max effect
    against Edi.  YES, it did leave you high and dry.  But when were we
    going to hit Edi?  1903?  1904?  Would I even be alive by 1904?  Would
    Cal?  Better to strangle the Bolshevik baby in its crib early, than to
    let it grow to adulthood.  If Cal fights for his fifth vs France (with
    unchecked AT growth in his rear), or if he fights for it in conjunction
    with me (and keeps AT suppressed), the rational act was to get Edi now.
    The fact that the QC fell apart in one big "poof!" as opposed to a
    whimper, is an unfortunate byline that I gleefully throw back in
    accusation at Edi.
    
    Please continue to work on Turkey to help us kill Edi.   Italy is pretty
    much committed now, I would think, unless (until?) FG link up.  I would
    HOPE that adroit EI diplomacy can blame everything on Edi, and convince
    France of the need for one/both of you to help 'bulwark' against the
    rising Hun threat...heck, blame me and send him/them eastward; I don't
    have much else occupying my time.
    
    The only (bitter) satisfaction of all this is seeing Edi squirm (at
    least it seems that way) by trying to offer half-a**ed options while
    coveting everything, and having me so 'no' for five straight e-mail
    replies.  I also told him not to waste the dime (for his call) if he is
    just going to weasel-word the same pap over and over again.  Should
    prove interesting.

    I am quite pleased to see that peace has been restored between us.  As you
    might expect, I have been asked to move against you already, but you may be
    assured that no such thing will transpire.  However, I do wish to secure
    your blessings for one thing.  In the event that I prosper this Fall, which
    is by no means assured, I may want to build F Mar.  This might appear
    dangerous to Italy, but you can see that I have no other option for
    building a fleet with which to reoccupy Mid-Atlantic Ocean.
    
    If this creates misgivings for you, please contact me.  Although it is
    strictly hypothetical at this point, I don't want to cause renewed problems
    between us on any account.

    That press from R to A was a bit hard to decipher. Fortunately, Faz's
    sentences are readily identifiable without ***'s.
    
    Edi told me several times that he thought I was threatening the 'stability'
    of the Quad by being unreasonable in my dispute with Italy over Portugal. I
    told him straight out that there was no such dispute, that there was at one
    point some disagreement but rapidly resolved. I don't think any of us have
    much doubt that he was just supplying rationalizations in advance for what
    he knew all along that he wanted to do. Similarly, he reported to me that
    Russia was 'unstable', that he (you) (Faz) had told him that what you
    really wanted to do was to build F Stp(nc). Edi said he was very worried
    about this. Again, I find it a bit insulting that he expected me to swallow
    that line.
    
    Look, I do think it is just a *bit* disappointing that after all the cute
    words about how nice it would be to put together an unusual and interesting
    opening for a demo game, ALL THREE OF YOU dumped the plan in one year when
    it looked like it might not be ideally to your advantages. And now you're
    just bogged down in a stale-looking battle, which you certainly could have
    done right from S1901 and not left me in this hideous position. Frankly, I
    think you're all three getting what you deserve! Sadly for me, I am also
    getting what I deserve for getting sucked into the fairy tale. Oh well,
    live and learn!
    
    For my part now, I am trying to convince Hohn Cho that although Russia is
    obviously not to be trusted for a nanosecond, it's not as though Edi is the
    perfect choice for a steadfast ally either. As far as I can tell, Hohn is
    on the fence. I'll play the weak, low cards I have left to tip him against
    Austria.
    
    And, needless to say, I'm saying everything I can think of to convince
    France that despite my opening viciousness I'm the lesser of two evils (and
    would certainly be the smaller of two evils) between his northern
    neighbors; and I'm even trying to convince Pitt that he could, with my
    help, swallow huge gulps of supply centers on the continent and be rapidly
    ready to smash into Austria and be the endgame's front-runner, trying to
    present that as an alternative to sacking my possessions. On these topics
    (G and F) my assessment is that my efforts have been less than successful.
    But we shall see.
    
    Oh, Edi has told me that my best chance would be to convince Cal to change
    his mind again and go for France. So, sure, I hereby advise Cal that that's
    what he ought to be doing now.

    You know, you could quite easily take Paris and Belgium this turn. If I
    ordered Bre-Gas, I mean. And, supposing your fleet were also to position
    itself next to Sweden, I don't think there would be much of a problem
    getting you Sweden next year. If I were to get that fleet into MAO, I can't
    see how you'd have much trouble getting Marseilles very rapidly, either.
    
    I'd come out of that process looking pretty good, all things considered.
    Not as well off as you'd be (but that's part of the point!). And you might
    not get quite as many centers that way as you would by gutting my
    possessions... but you'd get them a lot quicker, ready for action against
    Austria or Russia, whether they were preparing to strike you or not.
    
    What I'm trying to think of, generally speaking, is a proposal which would
    increase your chance of winning and also increase my chance of making it to
    the endgame. If I can't do that, well, then I don't think I'll make it to
    the endgame!
    And I do want to. Because I would dearly love to sail into St. Petersburg
    some day bearing a dagger with dried blood all over it, and present it to
    the Tsar with a little note about Norway. And if it could be managed, I'd
    also like to bring a little message to the Cosa Nostra in Sicily. As I said
    last note, some betrayals I can understand even if I don't agree with the
    reasoning behind them, but others are just ugly and deserve punishment. To
    put it another way, the reason I didn't expect Russia and Italy (and
    Austria, in that inscrutable way I'm sure he had but the details of which
    have yet escaped me) to stick me in this horrible situation is that I
    thought it would be foolish of them to do so. And I'd like to prove to them
    that I was right. I'm hoping you'll think this might be to your advantage.
    
    
    Cheers!

    Dear M. President,
    
    I would like to tell you a story.
    
    Once upon a time, England was trying to decide what country to visit first.
    The Germans suggested France. The Italians and Russians and Austrians
    together came up with an unusual plan, one which involved Russia and
    Austria attacking Turkey, Italy and England attacking France, and then
    various members of this group attacking Germany all together. Well, who
    knows? But given the state of the world, England thought a visit to France
    looked best, practically mandatory. Trying to cover the bases, England
    tried hard to stay on good terms with Germany, too, just to see what would
    happen.
    
    Sadly (for England), not a single one of the aforementioned schemers was
    sincere. Imagine! Lying, in Diplomacy! One can scarcely believe such a
    thing could happen. But there you have it. All of a sudden, England found
    herself betrayed by at least three allies, and really four, if you count
    Austria. Probably you do not know how it feels to find all of one's
    neighbors, and even some non-neighbors, suddenly and unexpectedly aligned
    against one. Do you?
    
    Not that the story amounts to an *excuse*, or even that it provides much of
    a reason for France to forgive and/or forget, but I just thought I'd share
    it.
    
    I don't feel entitled to ask you drop all grudges and forsake various
    possible benefits of an attack on English shores, so I won't. But, I think
    I won't bother defending Brest (though I'm not completely sure I won't),
    and I have no idea whether you're expecting Germany to lay off Paris. If
    the prospect of a really gigantic (seven center?) Germany is frightening
    enough to overwhelm and overcome other motivations and thoughts, you should
    know that I am as ready as could be to return what is rightfully yours and
    direct all future forces against (to defend against) Germany.
    
    Gently, as ever,
    King Jamie

    Hi Hohn
    Have reviewed some moves -- we're pretty much thinking alike here.
    I looked at "mutating" the orders we've both bantied around, and came up
    with something like this:
    
    TUR:  	Rum-Bul (Con S)	RUS:  Bla S Rum-Bul
            Smy-Arm		          Sev-Rum (Gal S), or vice versa
    	Ank S Con			Gal-Vie (if Italy does Ven S Vie-Tri)
    
    This move plays it conservatively, but instead of "wasting" BLA as a
    convoy train, gives you an extra "oomph" against retaking BUL.  If Edi
    covers vs Gre, then you're guarenteed BUL back with this option.  My two
    on RUM either gets it for me, or lets me keep it "by default," in the
    event Edi somehow puts two in it himself.  With this option, you're
    closer to 'home" in BUL (as I am in RUM), instead of having our armies
    flip-flopped in reverse provinces (altho' they can admittedly be easily
    swapped out later).
    
    The GAL thing is a crapshoot.  It could go to BUD (to bust any
    supports), do the Vie thing, I don't know.
    
    Another, more "gutsy" option is:
    Rum-Bud (Gal S)
    Ukr-Rum
    Sev-Bla-Bul (Con S)
    Smy-Arm
    Ank S Con
    I haven't even BEGUN to figure out who would gain what, given all the
    permutations associated with the move.  But a 'first cut" shows it might
    have a surprise factor (regarding BUD), as well as potentially hurting
    BUL and/or bouncing RUM.
    
    Again, these are two parallel options to the ones you proposed.  I'm
    game for just about anything, but wanted to float these by you...your
    opinions?
    
    Oh, btw, Edi wrote again (interesting how he has written more in 2 days
    than he has since the game started...).  Said he wants to call me
    tonight or tomorrow.  Quote:  "I am going to be staying with the Turk
    until I feel comfortable with Russia..."  Says he's trying to keep
    options open, but it's obvious we're not on the same wavelength...If and
    when he calls, rest assured I'll clue you in.
    
    Again, I welcome comment and/or critique of these proposals.

    Hohn:
    Am in receipt of your last note, with the moves at the end.  I will
    cease with my "comments to the comments," as I'm sure we're both tired
    of "moral one-upmanship" or arguing our various points.  I know I am.
    (My one last observation, though:  if you were in court and said "I
    plead the Fifth" three times, the jury would look askance at the
    utterances.  Yet your last note had three "I'm afraid I can't comment
    about that" kind of statements.  Reticence about saying anything to a
    former stabber?  Understood.  Confidence-builders for a future alliance?
     Not.)   Not that the "Hohn-and-Edi" show has some secret plan to fool
    us all and kick butt as a permanent AT (at least I'm praying "it ain't
    so!"), but anything's possible, I guess.  (I know, "I'm afraid I can't
    comment...)
    
    I have the moves printed out, and will look them over in between
    classes, getting back to you later today; ok?
    
    Edi wrote again.  Says that since I'm the stabber of three of my four
    neighbors, I should be the one to initiate goodwill, and that he needs
    room to grow and to "keep the alliance he has now, and its options."
    ("...and, btw, RUM is lost to Russia for now.")   I asked him if his
    memory was really so bad that he, Edi, was the one who volunteered the
    "hit T and G" plan, then advised me to build F StP(nc) in '02, rather
    than hit Germany!  He has offered nothing except "get out Gal and get
    Italy off my back."  That's pap.  Frankly, I'd love an RT, just to see
    the Master sweat with no friends in the neighborhood...
    
    If you guys stay tight, then an RI is a necessity, and I'll go down
    fighting.  If you're serious about an RT (and there's little doubt right
    now that you aren't), then Italy is useful to the death of Austria, but
    not going to obstruct an RT.  That's a fact from the tsar.   We have big
    potential here.
    
    Let me review the stuff, and thanks for writing quickly and with
    positivist feedback, Hohn.

    >That went nicely.  Thanks for coming through.
    
    And I thank you.  It was a leap of faith for both of us.  I hope that it;'s
    teh start of a strong alliance.
    
    >I was not counting on Italy turning east, but it's a nice bonus.
    
    Yes, indeed.  And, frankly, it's for the best for both of us.  If he keeps
    Edi occupied, perhaps he'll have less time to think of interesting ways to
    help others stick to you and me...;-)
    
    >Any ideas on how to play this?
    
    Well, the key issue is where you are going to build.  My strong preference
    is for you to build a fleet so you can get to England more quickly.
    However, you can only do that if you build it in MAR, which might worry
    Italy.  My suggestion is that you approach him and ask for his approval.
    I'll be glad to help with that, if you'd like.
    
    If that doesn't work out, your only other options are to build an army in
    MAR or PAR or waive the build.  I don't want to push but I'd like you to
    consider the waive option.  Frankly, I don't see that you're going to have
    much use for another army any time soon (at least, not so long as you and I
    are working together...;-)  If you do waive the build, you'd lose nothing
    that would be of any use to you next year and you'd then have the option of
    building a F BRE.  In fact, now that I consider it, that might be the best
    overall option since your fleet would get into play even sooner that way.
    
    No matter what you decide to do on the build, I think you should attack BRE
    from GAS with PAR support.  I will also support from PIC and you'll be in.
    I'll be taking BEL from BUR in order to DMZ BUR for our mutual comfort
    (please confirm the DMZ).
    
    Please let me know what your thoughts on all this are.

    Mark, it's easy to say, "I'm a bad boy."  It's easy to say,
    "I'm sorry."  The hard thing is making substantive amends,
    and you haven't yet done that.  You had offered to after
    Spring 1901, but you chose to stab again.  Obviously, I must
    look with suspicion at further diplomatic forays initiated
    by you.  That's not to say I'm foreclosed to the idea,
    though; the length of this letter should hopefully tell you
    otherwise.

    Certainly I have.  But I didn't pretend it was nothing and I
    didn't make certain less-than-credible representations,
    which in some ways I felt you did.

    Your attempt to compare your situation and mine is, IMO, a
    poor analogy in that I have done nothing improper.  We
    aren't in the same boat or in the same position, because you
    have yet to establish trustworthiness with me.  In contrast,
    I've never betrayed you.  This of course goes back to my
    point about requiring some gesture of goodwill before I will
    be comfortable working with you.
    
    As for how far we trace stuff, in terms of relationships in
    game, I take into account the entire history of a game
    relationship, until affirmative later goodwill erases past
    perfidy.  I haven't yet seen that from you.  I hope I will.

    My eyes are fully open, I assure you.  As for my
    "castigation," the fact that you chose to go with your AR
    assumption again changes nothing about the fact that you
    still chose to stab me twice.  Again, your understanding (or
    misunderstanding) of your relationship with a third party
    has nothing to do with your current poor relationship with
    me.  This again goes back to what it will take to restore my
    faith in you, and my failure to see that in your first
    letter to me this turn.

    Anyone can make a plan or say what they want to say in
    Diplomacy.  What matters is what they actually do.
    
    You chose to stab me in Spring and Fall of 1901.  That was
    your choice, regardless of what Edi promised you.  Edi did
    what he did.  And my relationship with him is what it is.

    There was a clear undercurrent in your message, at least a
    clear undercurrent to me, that I should somehow be grateful
    to you for stabbing Austria and choosing not to go for ARM.
    I wanted you to know that that wasn't sufficient with
    respect to restoring my faith in you, not by a long shot,
    especially when, as you now seem to concede, it was hardly
    done with my best interests in mind (as you previously
    claimed), but rather with your own interests in mind.  I was
    just trying to be honest, Mark.  Honest and blunt and
    straightforward.  I reiterate: I could have _lied_ and
    played along and stabbed you right back.  I chose not to do
    so, with all of the attendant risks.  I hope you can
    appreciate that fact.

    It doesn't bug me at all.  I just wish you had said this up
    front at the beginning of this turn rather than go through
    all of the contortions and kilobytes of text which we've
    _both_ gone through to get to this point.

    Oh, I definitely see that.  That much is obvious.  But
    that action with respect to a third party is not sufficient,
    standing alone, to repair the relationship between us.
    That's one of the primary things I've been trying to say
    this entire time.

    Come on, Mark.  You can't blame this on Edi.  Did he hold a
    gun to your head and force you to type those moves?  Sure,
    maybe he formed a plan.  But with respect to negotiations
    and promised moves, you were the only one that broke faith
    with me in 1901.  Edi never once broke faith with me in
    1901.  It was your decision.
    
    He can tell you whatever he wants; but what matters is what
    you and he both decide to actually do.
    
    > The fact that I

    Of course.  It was a knowing, intentional action by you.
    You had seemed to acknowledge this before.  Why the sudden
    change of heart?  I'm not sure I understand how you're
    blaming this all on Edi.

    After this game is over, please tell me whether this
    "inferiority complex" you seem to hold is in fact existent,
    or if it was all a big act. :)
    
    Mark, no one I've talked to has given any indication that
    you're less than the real deal, or any worse a player than
    anyone else.  I've heard only good things about you.  And I
    dare say that your play in this game so far has been better
    than mine.  Sure you may have made an error or two.  But who
    hasn't?  You're certainly in a better position than me, your
    setback of Spring 1902 notwithstanding.
    
    The thing I didn't understand was your part about "letting
    him take BUL."

    For the record, you trying for ARM certainly wouldn't have
    angered me, or caused any real change in my position towards
    you.  Our relationship was already pretty dead at that
    point.

    OK, I understand where you're coming from.  I even believe
    it to a significant degree.  I reiterate that your not
    moving to ARM doesn't really impress me all that much, since
    it was mine for the taking anyway, but the other things you
    say in the above paragraph do impress me a decent amount.

    Venting spleen?  Is that what you thought it was?  I was
    just trying to be completely honest.  I don't believe in
    sugarcoating, Mark.  I call a spade a spade.  Some people
    might be put off by that, but I had been hoping that people
    in this experts' game would not be.  None of it's personal;
    it's just a game.  And thus I prefer blunt honesty.  You
    can't always do that in real life, after all.

    Moralizing?  Maybe a bit.  But the reason I've been harping
    on this fact is because it still hasn't been clear to me
    that you're willing to make any gesture of good faith with
    respect to your relationship with me.  Things like the
    "blame it on Edi" thing above also still tend to make me
    wonder about where you're coming from at times.

    Your diplomacy was very effective in convincing me once.
    I'm sure you understand if it's a bit more difficult to
    convince me a second time.
    
    But if you can convince me, you can count on me following
    through with what I promise, I assure you.

    I'm also in receipt of your other note, the one about your
    talks with Edi.  In light of that, and having looked at the
    map, here is what I propose:
    
    SEV-BLA-BUL
    BLA C SEV-BUL
    UKR S RUM
    GAL-BUD or VIE (assuming Italy orders VEN S VIE-TRI)
    
    CON S SEV-BUL
    ARM-SMY
    ANK S CON
    RUM S SEV-BUL (if GAL moves to VIE) or S GAL-BUD
    
    Looking at the potential support cuts and other factors, I
    think the above has the best chance of working.  It's true
    that you're not guaranteed BUL or BUD (or VIE), but I think
    the chances are pretty good of you at least getting one.
    This is riskier for both of us, as it also leaves you in
    BLA, which is not my preference, but I'll live with it in
    exchange for the potential tactical upside.
    
    Alternatively, we can play things more conservatively, and
    try the following:
    
    BLA-RUM
    SEV S BLA-RUM
    UKR-GAL
    GAL-VIE (assuming VEN S VIE-TRI)
    
    RUM-BUL
    CON S RUM-BUL
    ANK S CON
    ARM-SMY
    
    Technically, this doesn't guarantee you RUM either, since
    Austria might be able to attack RUM with a force of two in
    his own right, but there's also a chance that RUM-BUL will
    succeed, and a standoff will result in RUM (which would
    remain under your control since it wasn't occupied in a fall
    season).  It's not as effective as certain other moves, but
    as I said, I have a pretty strong desire to see BLA vacant.
    
    Let me know what you think.

    Vienna, (Free Press)
    The Dark Tower was the back drop to a small twilight gathering of nine
    horsemen and the cloaked figure of BirSauron.  The events of the previous
    Spring had caused strong currents to swirl in the  events the Palantir was
    projecting though the strain was not yet showing in the voice of the Tower's
    champion.  The shadowed one spoke to each of the riders in turn:
    
    "Take to the Island Kingdom that does not recognize its United status and see
    if King Jamie has overcome the shock of his sudden Germanic storm.  Of special
    concern is to understand the thinking in terms of his move from Scapa Flow to
    the Norwegian rather than the more to be expected North Sea.  What could have
    been the thought in the move for it would appear that by ill or good the North
    Sea calling should not have been denied."
    
    "Take the route through Switzerland and seek out the French whose capital we
    are unsure of at the moment.  It could be that with their ghostly repulse of
    the Italians that they may move their focus to Marseilles in recognition of
    that cities deliverance from the dogs of war. The times are tense in the land
    of the French and what dance they may have with the Normans and the Germanic
    hordes has yet to be played to its final cord.  Much is still left to swing
    about."
    
    "For the Romans and their circular pattern laced with more paranoia than
    hostile intent, we must find what is the essence of their souls.  For their
    appears to be a duality in their approach to life and thus two of you should
    go.  One to explore his dark side and the other to find his strength.  They
    may be responding more to their fears than the calls for perfidiousness from
    the western steppes."
    
    "The Berliners need to be, understood for from the poisoning of their food
    that brought them to near civil disorder they have brought forth some vile
    actions across the lowlands and the North Sea that have upset the Gentle King
    Jamie. The future seems to hold to a major expansion of the German Fleet and
    one can only guess as to the priorities of them over the Islanders.  What is
    the nature of their seeming cooperation with the Cossack?"
    
    "The road to Consantinople is an easy flight, and the winds of the draft have
    been well greased by the staging of multiple thrusts by the Cossack.  Will
    they seek to reclaim the Bulgars or shall we seem rejoice at the slaughter of
    the Russian First Rumanian army.  Though our thoughts are drawn by the blood
    spilled on those wondrous Transylvanian heights, the time is not right for
    their return to their birthright holder."
    
    "The Cossack is a problem and three of you shall be needed there.  The first
    amongst you shall explore the tactical views from the Winter Palace and see if
    the Galician gambits are well under consideration or if he sees them as sole
    objects of projection.  The next shall look to the halls of the couriers and
    see what manner of excitation is implanted in his Western fancy and what hopes
    he has to remain secure in there possession with a resurgent Germanic horde
    from the Pitt of Darkness.  The last of you shall explore the strategic views
    and see if the panes are not clouded by some spell or illusion, for surely the
    Spring jump off would have left little strategic flexibility in its moves
    given the personalities involved.  The cults of the ruling classes across the
    world seem somewhat out of synch in this perception and may be a matter of our
    own weakness in seeing as he does.  Thus more is needed in this field of view
    possibly from both sides."
    
    With that the riders lifted their unnatural steeds to the night wind and were
    gone.  The master of the ebony tower returned to the tall shadow across the
    city and once more summoned up the images in the Palantir for study and
    excitation.

    GKJ,
    Am heading out the door to administer an exam, so this will be brief.
    
    May be a breakthrough in the Turkish camp.  Am working a deal to support
    him (Rum-Bud, Gal S) and perhaps reliberate RUM at the same time.
    
    Italy says he'll probably move to Gre and/or Tri, or perhaps support a
    piece of Edi's to Tri (rather than bounce).  If he does the latter
    (i.e., if he believes what Edi tells him he's moving), then I might try
    Gal-Bud or Gal-Vie instead.  but for now, Turkey's goodwill is one of my
    few options (and this, the guy I stabbed twice in two seasons...yoiks).
    
    Will see how this all works out.   May have Norwegian reprecussions.

    I've had some SEVERE computer problems in trying to send info through my
    home (remoted) server.  Have to send everything thru the work one, it
    seems, at least until I address the problem.
    
    Please don't take any silence I've had for deliberateness, a la last
    turn.  I'm VERY MUCH "with you," will be sending in "our" orders next
    message, and plan on a wonderful anti-Austrian honeymoon with you.  In
    fact, if there's any stabbing to be done, it'll be from you, not me.
    
    Italy writes and says he's unsure of what he'll do with Ven, i.e., hold
    and lure Edi back, bounce, guess which unit's going there, etc.   Edi
    aparently told him that he's moving SER-TRI (yeah, right), bit Italy
    isn't sure how to respond.  Scary, if Edi wins him over!
    
    Will talk to you again when the results come out, if not sooner.  here's
    to reliberating BUL and RUM.  Thanks, Hohn.

    Hm.
    
    Listen, I understand, you feel there's no point in discussing the future
    before you see what you can do about home.
    
    But, do you understand my position? What I do now depends a whole lot on
    what I think might happen in the future. Just to take an example, I have to
    decide whether to keep you locked up in Portugal or not.
    
    Can you give me anything just a little more, um, informative, than that you
    plan to recapture your home center?
    
    I have already said that I won't support myself to hold in Brest, and I'll
    stick to that.

    That's good enough for me.
    
    I will have my army move to Picardy. That might possibly prevent Germany
    from taking Paris along with Belgium. Probably not, but it can't hurt.
    
    As for my having many friends...
    Well, I am not surprised that many other powers are afraid of Germany
    growing at the present projected rate.
    
    I would offer to convoy my own army out of Brest...
    
    Hm.
    
    Y'know, I might just do that. But (a) I probably won't unless you ask me to,
    and (b) I would have to order it to London, and you must realize that it is
    at least possible that Germany will order Nth-Lon.

    Yes, other duties have occupied me, but not so much that I won't correspond
    with my English friend!  I received your brief note following last season's
    results, but I did not think it called for a reply.  Given the presence of
    your army in my home center, I had thought we had very little to discuss.
    But I am glad you wrote, because you have many friends in this game.  I
    have been urged by all and sundry to patch up my relations with you.  It
    seems fears are growing regarding the German threat.
    
    I don't think I can do anything this turn except strive to free my homeland
    of foreigners, but I do want you to know that the lines of communication
    remain open in Paris.

    Hi Hohn
    Will keep this brief; am grading 60 exams by Friday, when they give me
    60 term papers (and spring "break" begins, how ironic).  Hope you're not
    as swamped at work...
    
    Judge is indeed up and running; my home system is screwed up, so you'll
    just get the messages during work hours (in case I forgot to mention
    this --  don't remember who I told already).
    
    I re-sent my orders to clear the error flag.  The Norway piece wouldn't
    take until I finally "cracked the code."  As agreed, Bla S Rum-Bul,
    Sev-Rum (Ukr S)...I may alter GAL, based on what Italy does(n't)
    do...Edi's been telling him "Gal must go," so it's either going to be
    booted, or he's bluffing Cal to try and keep BUL/gain RUM...we'll see
    tonight!
    
    I'm also enthusiastic, if brief, here.  I think the RT will cause
    surprise and consternation among the board, and surprise from the
    Observers.  Maybe keep the game at its high level of fun...
    
    Take care; will talk when the moves are out, if not sooner.

    As you should be able to see (assuming the mail route from
    the Judge to you is still up), the Judge is back up, at
    least for me.  My orders of RUM-BUL, CON S RUM-BUL, ANK S
    CON, ARM-SMY are in and we're good to go, at least as far as
    I'm concerned.
    
    >If it didn't, then this is to reassure you that I do indeed confirm the

    You might want to reverify your moves, now that the Judge is
    back up, if you're uncertain about whether they got through
    the Judge down time.  Being certain is a good thing. ;)

    All sounds good; I've gotten your messages of the last day
    or two, btw.  Please don't mistake my lack of responses and
    my brevity here for lack of enthusiasm.  I appreciate your
    efforts and your kind words, and I'm feeling confident about
    this upcoming turn.  I've just been (and continue to be)
    swamped at work.  I hope your back feels better soon, and
    barring any crucial last-minute info I obtain from any of
    our neighbors that might interest you, I'll talk to you

    I thought that E/G didn't have orders in because they hadn't noticed the
    Judge was accepting messages again.  I was surprised to see the notice

    GKJ,
    Look, Jamie, I don't want to be a bone in your throat.  But look at my
    side, too...
    
    1) I HOPE that Turkey's with me, but won't know until it might be too
    late;  don't I have a right to 'err on the side of caution" too?
    2) Germany may get fat quickly and may be heading east -- I have NO
    central armies and NO defense of Scandanavia if he would build in BER or
    MUn next turn.
    3) Would I give you Nwy if I could, i.e., with no adversity to myself?
    Absolutely.  Despite my press (or apparent "game face"), I've been
    branded an "alliance player playing only for draws" for 10 of my first
    20 years of PBM.  I honor the value of an alliance.  but I'm just d**n
    paranoid over uncertainties this game to voluntarily give up a center
    with the AT and G guys staged the way they are.
    4) Part of it is cold cost-benefit.  Am I willing to take my chances
    "riding the G tiger" and hoping to survive, or should I expose my manly
    honor, stand by E, anger Germany when I'm pretty weak vs him, etc, when
    you may be going -1 or -2?   I'm being brutally realistic here, vice
    honorable, but that is a way to look at the board right now.  Will G
    turn on me anyway, after I've thrown away any E goodwill?  We'll see.
    You can say "I told you so" when he does; I won't get mad.
    
    5) Finally, a point we once discussed:  the English "vent my spleen vs
    Eng because he's the only QC'er I can reach."  I'll say this.  You're
    not an idiot.  You're an expert, shrewdly calculating Dipper who knows
    what must be done FOR himself and TO others.  I respect you and everyone
    else here.   I'm assuming you will make the coldly logical English
    defens moves, rather than charging off half-cocked at me in a fit of
    kamikaze rage because I'm a convenient whipping boy.  If that's not the
    case, then bring on your 3 to 4 units; convoy up there somehow, and take
    me down with you.  But I would hope you have better things to do than
    that.
    
    I guess I just don't understand your continuing moral rage at me when
    you have the Hun crawling all over you--other than Nwy would help you
    stay solvent (as it hopefully will do for me).

    Cal,
    
    I have pointed out to Master Mark that if he decides to try to hold Norway,
    Sweden, and St. Petersburg against an Englishman bent on revenge, he will
    surely lose more than Norway. Whereas if he vacates Norway and takes and
    holds Sweden, he is perfectly solid in the North.
    
    Originally (just after last week's results), he agreed to let me take
    Norway, and give me some chance to survive to the endgame, if only I would
    help him talk Turkey into joining his side (and yours). I did that. Turkey
    has agreed. But Faz has changed his mind.
    
    He may think I am not serious about revenge (it's not quite exactly revenge,
    but that will have to do for this short version), or he may think that I
    can't really harm him.
    
    I wonder whether you might be able to convince him. Of course, you may agree
    with his judgment! In that case, I will have the pleasure of proving both of
    you wrong :) But if you agree with me that it is wiser from the perspective
    of Russia's own security not to sell out his only northern alliance for a
    single, unholdable supply center, you might put in a word.
    
    It's *almost* too late. Maybe it's too late. But I'd hate to have to do what
    I'm about to have to do, without having tried everything else first.
    
    Cheers!

    Well, what do you mean, "know that for a fact"? We never know such things
    for facts, strictly speaking.

    You are *seriously* suggesting that I order Nwg-Nwy when I might instead
    defend Edinburgh, even though you will not tell me that you are vacating
    Norway? Then you must simply think I am an idiot.

    This really is getting very insulting.
    
    You expect me to believe for even one nanosecond that you may already have
    ordered your fleet out of Norway, but declined to tell me that you had? Why
    on earth would you do such a thing? What could possibly induce me to believe
    that you had done that?
    
    So please explain. Are you expecting me to order Nwg-Nwy on the faint hope
    that you *might* let me in? Why? If you order the fleet out of Norway, tell
    me that you have done so, and then I will order Nwg-Nwy.

    Don't be absurd.
    
    Nobody knows what Pitt will do. Obviously, since he does not expect you to
    vacate Norway, he will think that probably I'll cover Edi, so attacking Edi
    is not one of his most likely moves.
    
    Come on, don't make me explain such trivia at this stage. If you wanted me
    to explain that you could have asked me a week ago.

    I'm going to make an observation; lambaste me as a troglodyte if you
    will, but it's JUST an observation, NOT a condemnation...
    
    I'm afraid I don't agree with the GM/Judge policy of allowing for
    negotiation after the deadline when some folks haven't submitted orders.
     I mean, what's to keep E and G (or ANYONE in the same boat) from using
    "the other non-submittee" as an excuse to continue to negotiate, until
    one of them 'caves in' and submits orders?  In the meantime, we are
    'creeping around the edges' of the deadline waiting for The Final
    Submissions.   The "No NMR" policy that Jim has is good--to a point.  It
    allows for guys that are genuinely sick (like Pitt and Cal) or oveworked
    (Hohn, perhaps, with his mega-hour days, or me, writing this when I
    should be grading 60 papers by Friday) to have extra time to negotiate
    and recover from illness...Or perhaps (again) guys like me, taking
    leave, would like a little extra time top recover when returning to a
    computer screen and reading game mail.  I will beg and grovel with the
    best of 'em soon enough, probably...
    
    Having said that, if I as a player can't make a deal with my allies (or
    foes) in two or three days of intense message-writing, then why do I
    need an extra few days?  (Again, I'm NOT accusing E, G or anyone of
    shamming/misusing the system...heck, their computers could be broken for
    all we know!).  I'm merely saying that the game shouldn't have to extend
    artificially for every game turn because we're allowing No NMRs and/or
    because we're not big boys here.  I haven't NMRed in 20+ years of
    PBMing.  I sent moves from combat zones, through morale calls patched
    through 10 different relays, etc....why can't we get a week's moves in
    on time when we're all in the States staring at screens?
    
    Again, I apologize if someone's taking this personally.  BELIEVE ME,
    even though the game dynamics here have caused me to fume (over my own
    lack of apparent skill to date),  I really am an understanding, 70s-era
    "peace love and rock-n-roll" kinda guy.  I just wonder why we allow
    post-deadline negotiations, and why the post-deadlines are so "post"
    every turn.....

    GKJ,
    I understand the tactical vs strategic picture, honest.  But I also
    understand that Turkey may not yet be in my camp.  And if France is
    sincere with this upsurge of communication, then perhaps some pressure
    has been taken from you.
    
    And, quite honestly, Italy may not be making an all-out assault vs Edi
    this turn.  Coupled with Turkey's unknown status ("roll the dice and see
    what comes up"), I am loathe to abandon a center...especially when I can
    rebuild the destroyed A RUM if I have to, or to remain even if RT stay
    unified--as the case may yet be.
    
    I will do what I can to not antagonize the English (any moreso than it
    seems I have).  Go ahead and move to NWY, just in case I leave -- I can
    always explain it as a "head-fake to BAR" if Germany asks.  No promises,
    but I'll see what I can do....

    Jim has already made a ruling on post-deadline diploming.
    
    Here's what he said (it was in a broadcast about two weeks ago)
    
    
    *********
    Again, just as obviously, having a player wait until after the deadline
    to finish negotiating is not fair to the rest of the players.  Still,
    in the same light as the way I adjudicate postal games, I don't feel it
    is out of bounds, given the "no NMR" style of play.

    you were still not entirely decided on the matter.

    Not worth much, eh?  I put out that message about someone letting me know
    if they wanted the deadline extended.  I received no such request, so

    since you were not the only one not to have orders in.  In the future,
    I'd appreciate the note along the lines I suggested in the broadcast.
    (I realize you implicitly did it -- and note that I would not say

    Let me be very, very clear about this:
    
    1) "No NMR" has been a Judge standard from the beginning because of the
    vagarities of the E-Mail system.
    
    2) I support the basic idea of "No NMR" even in my postal szine where
    I call players for orders and accept orders up until the time I adjudicate.
    Sometimes negotiation takes place during that time and this is OK, but
    not encouraged.  If I reach you by phone, the answer "let me write a
    few letters, E-Mail a few people, and wait for replies before calling
    me back with orders" would not be visited too kindly.
    
    3) This is a Demo game and some leeway so that "screwy" forced results
    occur is to my mind something to be avoided, but this is soft thinking.
    I also will not take kindly to being manipulated for advantage and the
    demo system allows me access to most of the information I need to
    determine this.
    
    4) I am an active Internet person, but I have a life and a job and am
    not hardwired 24 hours a day.  Obviously, some discussion took place
    today (you see what was broadcast) after the deadline.  I checked in
    at about 7AM this morning, but then was busy all day until now.
    Rather than have you guys wait all day for me to respond, sure, go
    ahead and negotiate during the grace period.  Some people might
    logically have thought the Judge was still down and the deadline
    was not valid, BUT as soon as they logged on and saw the traffic
    and my earlier message WITHOUT a deadline extension, the logical
    assumption was you were supposed to get your orders in.
    
    5) At that point, if you wanted more time because of the problems
    over the weekend, a private message to me like this: "Jim, I'm
    going to keep negotiating, would you please set the deadline
    until Wednesday, we lost a few days of negotiating with these
    judge problems" would be a good courtesy.
    
    6) I don't wish to point any fingers or cast any blame, but I
    really want orders before the Wednesday deadline or a message
    to me explaining why.
    
    7) This is an intense game, everyone is OK by my book so far,
    but I want to make the limits clear so they are not extended
    in the future.  After my message over the weekend, I really
    expected one of three outcomes: (a) orders all in by deadline
    (b) a request for a few days extension from one or more players
    (c) a Judge-Keeper extension if the Judge really had been down
    for a significant amount of time (this was not my perception,
    but my experience may not have paralleled yours.
    
    Again, let me emphasize that I just am trying to be clear.
    A deadline in general is still a deadline, yet deadline
    extensions are reasonable with prior or even "current"
    notice.
    
    Thanks for everyone's understanding, please send me a private
    note if this clarification did not resolve any remaining uncertainty
    you might have.  I'm assuming that I am extending the deadline
    until tomorrow to adjust for the Judge uncertainty over the last week.

    to me explaining why.
    
    7) This is an intense game, everyone is OK by my book so far,
    but I want to make the limits clear so they are not extended
    in the future.  After my message over the weekend, I really
    expected one of three outcomes: (a) orders all in by deadline
    (b) a request for a few days extension from one or more players
    (c) a Judge-Keeper extension if the Judge really had been down
    for a significant amount of time (this was not my perception,
    but my experience may not have paralleled yours.
    
    Again, let me emphasize that I just am trying to be clear.
    A deadline in general is still a deadline, yet deadline
    extensions are reasonable with prior or even "current"
    notice.
    
    Thanks for everyone's understanding, please send me a private
    note if this clarification did not resolve any remaining uncertainty
    you might have.  I'm assuming that I am extending the deadline
    until tomorrow to adjust for the Judge uncertainty over the last week.
    
    Your cheery GM, Jim

    Jamie, I want to emphasize that everything you did was fine, especially
    since you were not the only one not to have orders in.  In the future,
    I'd appreciate the note along the lines I suggested in the broadcast.
    (I realize you implicitly did it -- and note that I would not say
    "Jamie asked for another day" if you did ask).  On the other hand,
    some of their concerns (F/R) are worth considering too.

    Heh heh, a phone call would do absolutely no good unless you're
    into soliloquys...  I have absolutely no voice whatsoever.  Other
    than that I feel pretty good, but the voice thing is lasting.
    
    Have you decided as to which way you're going this year?  I mean
    have you decided to hit Edi or stick with the attack on Russia?
    I HOPE you'll do the former, but suspect the latter (and can't say
    as I'd blame you).
    
    Edi has been trying his best to get me to go to the Eastern Med and
    "promises" to hit Con if I'll just leave him alone.  I admit I
    considered this course, but I don't like it (bet you don't
    either...:) ), so I'll head straight east.
    
    Let me know what you're doing and we'll work from there.  All I can
    say is, if you DO decide to attack Edi, you'll have a faithful ally
    in Italy.  I'm getting a little tired of Mark's impetuousness and
    don't really see him as a long term ally any more.

    Just thought I'd pass this along as I consider his threats of revenge,
    while
    a tad panicky, most real.  I've responded that I would talk to you,
    while at
    the same time, asking him to reconsider as his suiciding against you
    would
    tip the balance of the game.  I'll let you know what he says.
    
    Is there any chance you could do as he asks?  I haven't checked the SC
    Chart;
    will you lose a unit by vacating Norway?  It may be worth it in light of
    "Gentle" King Jamie's threats.
    
    Let me know what you think.

    I will try to put a bug in his ear, but I don't know how effective it
    will be.
    I definitely don't want to see you and him at total war/revenge as it
    can only
    hurt my position down here to see a weakened Russian.  Unfortunately, if
    I'm
    not mistaken, won't that (vacating Norway) force him to remove a unit?
    I
    have severe doubts as to any effect of my urging such a move on him.  In
    the
    face of A/T belligerence, he'd be in real trouble if he has to lose a
    unit
    (almost as much if he has you to worry about...)
    
    I will try as best I can, but I also urge you to reconsider going all
    out for
    revenge.  That would turn the game drastically in Pitt & Edi's favour
    (who I am
    suspecting of a game long alliance since S'01).  On my personal GT/BT
    Scale
    (Good Thing/Bad Thing Scale), this would definitely clock in as a bad
    thing.
    I'll talk to Mark, but please reconsider.  Just because things look bad
    now,
    this game hs had so much give and take, you could be very easily be on
    the
    upswing VERY shortly.

    Just out of curiosity, what did you think was the big problem with the plan
    I outlined?
    
    I do appreciate the frankness, by the way. [I believe I hinted at the
    following, but may as well say it outright: ours was a modus vivendi, and
    that last move your stab was the fatal one, tactically speaking, but I was
    stabbed by others in a much uglier way. I don't expect I have to spell it
    all out.]
    
    But I honestly don't see how there could me much room for rapprochement
    later, for purely tactical reasons, not diplomatic ones. This seems to be
    the key move. If you carry out your obvious attack, I will have to spend
    all of my remaining efforts in holding onto what I've got. That's too bad,
    because quite frankly I don't relish watching some southerners or
    easterners grow fat while I try to keep the brakes on your growth. I'd much
    rather see your coffers filling while I tried for some revenge against
    Russia (for instance).
    
    It's kind of a pity that you don't know me better, I think my offer might
    seem more attractive if you did.

    Tsar Faz,
    
    I'm not sure what else there is to discuss. What I meant was, I now have
    your message loud and clear. And you could not have had mine more plainly,
    I think, so I have nothing more to add.
    
    
    After a little more thought, I believe I understand your reasoning. There
    were a lot of rationalizations in your last few notes, but you did come
    right out and say you were doing some cold cost-benefit analysis. To you,
    the benefit of screwing me out of Norway is worth the cost of friendship.
    How could this be, I wonder. How could that center possibly be worth the
    headache you'll incur?
    I think I know.
    Stabbing me, and continuing to twist the dagger, you think, is cost-free.
    Doing something that might possibly, in some conceivable way, make Germany
    the tiniest bit cross with you, that is a cost. Giving up your stolen booty
    is a cost. But you think there is no cost to stabbing me, because you
    honestly don't believe I would ever carry out my threat.
    
    
    Here is something I thought I'd explained adequately, but I see that I have
    to explain it again.
    
    You write of "moral rage" and "venting spleen", of "kamikaze rage" and
    "going off half cocked". I've carefully explained to you my motivations,
    and you ought to know that those are not appropriate terms. What I must do
    is to demonstrate that your judgment of costs and benefits was incorrect
    and mine was correct. I am calculating coldly, rest assured.

    GKJ,
    I'm a little dismayed at your last note.  Are you saying that there's no
    sense in us communicating anymore, now that my intent to hold in Nwy is
    out?  Has all R-E correspondence now become 'tainted' due to this one
    flap?  I can't honestly believe that, and am hoping you meant, "Don't
    waste your breath ((this turn)) justifying your steal."   I would think
    there's "life beyond 1902" for E-R talks.  Nothing (not even Germanic
    kow-towing) is forever.
    
    If you are that genuinely miffed that you desire no further notes,
    please tell me now, and I'll not darken your in-basket any more.    But
    quite honestly, you're one of only two reliable mail senders, and I'd

    Cal,
    
    I appreciate what you say.
    
    I'm afraid I understand my own position (on the board, I mean, not my
    rhetorical position!) better than you do -- I wish your assessment were
    correct.
    
    If I go down to three units, which is what will happen if I don't get
    Norway, then my position is just about hopeless. I could certainly play to
    slow down Pitt. I know this is what's better for you. I might get some help
    from France, maybe, and I could slow down Pitt significantly. But I could
    not make it through to the endgame. At three I would not be able to stop
    the slide; I would be down to two units at the end of next year. And then
    my effect on the game would be negligible.
    
    I intend to have a significant effect on the game. At four units, I think
    my best bet is to hold the fort as hard as I can, hope for French help, and
    hope that Austria collapses and Pitt gets some pressure before I'm wrecked.
    In any case, I would do absolutely everything possible to repay Russian
    help. At three units, I think that's a vain hope, and I will just use my
    units as best I can to tip things the way I want them tipped. And, I'm
    afraid, I prefer them to be tipped in Germany's favor, given the
    circumstances of my downfall. As I said, it's not exactly a matter of pure
    revenge. I have explained it to Mark like this:
    When I am stabbed unexpectedly, that's (usually) because I figured that
    stabbing me would not be a good move. (Different case with Germany; I just
    wasn't too worried because I expected he'd be having major problems
    shortly.) It then becomes important to me to show that I was right, that
    stabbing me *wasn't* a good move.
    
    
    I am well aware that Russia may go down a unit if he doesn't finish off
    this stab against me. But in fact he may very well not -- Turkey *says* he
    has decided to take sides against Edi (so Russia could manage to keep
    Rumania this year after all). And in any case, while Russia's going down to
    five would be very sad (violins....), I firmly believe it's more prudent
    for him to do it that way. Suppose he does get an extra (sixth or seventh)
    unit for Norway. He will have to build it in StP and send it to defend
    against me. So he wouldn't get to use it in the south anyway, and his
    northern position would be extremely precarious (believe me!). Whereas if
    he just takes the loss (or stays even), he would have my everlasting
    support to maintain Sweden, and his northern border would be, well, as
    secure as borders get in Diplomacy.
    
    Needless to say, I've pointed these things out already. In the end, his
    answer was, "Russia has to do what Russia has to do." Well, England has to
    do what England has to do. I think he doesn't believe me. I would very much
    prefer that you persuade him, but if not, I'm afraid I don't have many
    options.

    Jim,
    
    Thanks, no problem here with your rulings. At least I don't think so.
    
    Let me explain my own style/views/etc.
    
    Myself, I prefer to have a rule against negotiation during grace period,
    especially, a rule against negotiation by or with powers who are late.
    
    However, since there is no such rule in this game, I can't regard it as
    cheating to take advantage of whatever house rules there are. That's
    Diplomacy, after all. There's cheating, and then there's taking advantage
    of loopholes, and the latter is admirable (when it works). Diplomacy is not
    cricket!
    
    I'm not sure I really understand your thinking. You are allowing grace
    period negotiation, but you don't really want anyone to do it? Sorry, I
    know you were trying to be absolutely 'very very' clear.
    
    Do you see my point/problem? If there's a loophole, I fully expect everyone
    to try to take advantage of it, and I'd just be asking to be taken
    advantage of myself if I didn't try to take advantage of it.
    
    I'll read over your recent comments again.

    OK, good, I think I should tell you that if you were the only one without
    orders in, it would have been inching closer to the line.  If you had
    been "essentially as I saw it in the press" holding up the turn solely
    to say "I won't submit orders until you give me my way" and you were
    the only one we were waiting for, then I would have had a problem with it.
    I didn't think we were anywhere close to that.

    I certainly do understand that rule, I just don't like to have
    essentially unenforceable rules.  You always could resort to
    off judge press and what of phone calls?  Players in my postal
    szine very commonly call other players after the deadline before
    calling or E-Mailing me their orders.

    I want you to request an extension, but then I don't want you to waste
    time waiting for me to grant an extension before you go on negotiating.
    I thought that was clear, but it probably wasn't.

    This illustrates part of my point.  I'm not changing my adjusted
    deadline.  If everyone gets orders in and wants the turn to process,
    those of you who have "set wait" will have to order a "set nowait".
    
    Otherwise, the deadline will still be Wednesday night (as Pitt will
    discover when he reads those messages).

    Guys:
    My home system (routed thru the local server on post) is acting funky.
    I can receive your mail, but can't answer from home.  So my replies have
    to wait until I'm at work.  I'm trying to get another e-mail carrier, or
    fix what I have at home...but until that happens, please be patient.
    I'll write during work when I'm not swamped, and will try to be
    reasonably prompt whenever possible.  Bottom line:  don't take my
    'blocked-off hours" of non-response for non-interest.

    before and after that time frame.  Thanks.

    Jim:
    I hope you're not mad at me for sending out that note...I remember last
    time 'going private' and didn't want to burden you with another off-line
    note.  But neither did I wish to embarass you (or any of the players)
    with the broadcast note.  Can't win for losing, sometimes.
    
    I'm a little dismayed at the stretching of the deadlines, e.g., until
    tomorrow for EXACTLY the reasons you mentioned.  No one requested a
    delay, and anyone (ahem, England) who sent notes today could see the
    Judge was up...yet there's no explanation, no request...zippo.  As a
    military (anal-retentive type) guy, I just find that frustrating.  But
    not game-ending, if you catch my drift.  if it's No NMR and flexible
    periods, then those are the rules we play by.
    
    Again, I apologize if this escalated beyond what was "understood
    territory."   I just got a little mad at Jamie's badgering about Nwy
    (and you see it did get a little testy toward the end).  But if he can
    write me all day to leave Nwy, he could've written a moment and send
    orders in on time.
    
    I don't know, Jim; the e-mail crowd seems a bit harsher and temper-prone

    doesn't fit in?

    Hey, you're back!  Great.  Hope things are better for you
    now.  In any case, I never heard back from you after my last
    letter.  Shall we touch base?  I can give you a call if you
    like.

    Jamie, in response to your earlier questions, no, I do not have info
    regarding Germany's moves.  I assume that, as most people do, he provides
    that on a need to know basis, and I have no need to know.  If I were to
    start asking now, I don't think he'd take it too well.
    
    I have no strong preferences regarding A Bre.  It can't hurt anything to
    convoy it back to London and just might put the army where it is most
    needed.  But I also see some merit to a move to Pic.  It is up to you.
    
    Best,

    I didn't request a deadline extension because the nature of
    my negotiation with Cal was not mandatory or crucial enough
    to warrant such a request, I thought.  My view was that if
    he didn't get back to me before moves processed, it was no
    big deal.  I didn't want to hold the game up for everyone
    else just for me.  But I figured I'd give it a shot with the
    note, and if he happened to respond before moves triggered,
    that's cool too.

    Nope.  What I am trying to do now though is to ask that people
    give me concurrent notice that they are asking for deadline
    extensions to keep negotiating.  I really don't want to break

    To me, all things are in play.  What I'm saying is: don't hesitate
    to E-Mail me privately; also, broadcast anything you want.

    Yes, and if Jamie (doing what he was doing) was the only one missing,
    then that would have been a problem.  You "assumed" that Jamie was
    "getting what he wants", but as now should be apparent I was granting
    the extension for Pitt.  Remember that I have to be very careful not
    to reveal what I know about on-going negotiations.  So, I "knew" that
    Pitt was nowhere to be found on the mail.  But, I couldn't tell you
    that.  Now that Pitt has told you, I am free to tell you.  I also
    told Jamie that the only reason he got away with what he did was because
    Pitt was missing.  Again, you want to be careful about what you say
    in public here -- and I ***REALLY*** have to be careful.  I'm not perfect
    and I will slip at times, please let me know if I have.

    Sure, that is understandable.  IIf I may step just a hair toward the
    line, Jamie was taking advantage of the situation.

    That is precisely the rub..... which is the case?  You tell me.  My opinions
    (mostly) will be kept to myself until the game is over).  Do you know
    what happened in ghods?  This is not a big secret and I will tell you if
    you like.  I also wrote some of my opinions in a DW article on E-Mail vs.

    Hi, all,
    
    Just wanted to give you a little insight into the USIN judge problems, etc.
    
    First, USIN has been in operation for 14 months and is one of two LARGE
    judges.  USEF is the other.
    
    Last summer, my employment changed (company was sold) and I no longer had
    the luxury of a FREE connection for the judge server.  I spent some time
    researching alternatives and concluded that the judge would operate in a
    non-traditional dial-up connection environment.  The use of a
    non-traditional setup was due primarily to the fact that my new employment
    offered me a way of placing an NT server on the internet for work purposes.
     The judge software does not run under NT.  The "non traditional" setup is
    that the NT server actually does all of the mail work for the USIN system
    and they talk together "behind the scenes" on a small network in my house.
    
    Unfortunately, this solution started to fail a month or so after the
    implementation primarily because of some limitations of Microsoft's DNS
    server and my ignorance about the Linux implementation of sendmail.  I've
    struggled with that problem for some months now.
    
    Last night, I believe I successfully solved most of my technical issues by
    being able the eliminate the need for the DNS software at all.  90% of
    USIN's failures since last November and ALL lengthy failures are attributed
    to this DNS/Mail problem (known to all of you as the "too many hops"
    issue).  The other NASTY side of this problem is that the judge NEVER SEES
    this mail so it has no way of managing the situation.
    
    Anyway, thanks for all of your patience.  I think I've solved the problem
    permanently, but we'll see.  I've been in this business long enough to know
    I should have said that!
    
    Dave

    Guys:  We got hooked up to another e-mail service at home and I wanted
    to pass it along.  Last night I tried doing an "IamAlsoat jm..etc"
    command, to see if the Judge would broadcast it, but nothing came from
    it.  (Would the Judge do that as a normal function, though?  Don't know
    enough about it.  Maybe I typed it incorrectly.)
    
    ANYWAY...you can now also send mail to me (any time, any hour) at
    			fazfam@juno.com
    
    If you send something to my work e-mail, remember that after-hours I
    can't reply via that system (I'd end up reading it off of the system and
    then replying via juno).
    
    BOTTOM LINE:  somehow, someway, I'll crack the code on when to send, and
    from what system.  Please bear with me,  Mr Roadkill on the Info
    Superhighway.

    Hi Cal
    Got your reply to Jamie's ominous thunderings about Nwy.  I'm in a bind,
    true, but I'm willing to ride it out.  I mean, look at it from my (our)
    view:
    
    1) Who knows what's going on with AT?  If I give up NWY and Hohn stays
    with Edi, I'm at least -1 (Rum), and maybe -2 (Sev), with me also out of
    Gal.
    2) If I abandon Nwy, Germany then senses lack of will on my part.  If he
    goes +2 and has peace with France, then waht's to stop him from sailing
    to BAL and heading for WAR via Sil or Pru?   Do I voluntarily reduce
    myself of forces -- forces needed for OUR front vs Edi -- to honor a
    deal with England so HE can stay even or possibly even gain (who knows
    what he and F & G are discussing, too)?
    
    Jamie is calculating, and I know he's not a kamikaze player--at least I
    hope not.  But if he comes after me, it'll either be with Germany (in
    which case I'll lose Nwy anyway), or solo, with G on his heels.  If he
    sails to Bar and (eventually) to Nwg, I'll build F StP(nc) and hunker
    down, or boot him before the rest of his units come on-scene.  If he
    really pisses me off, I'll hit Nwg next turn with German support, but I
    don't really want that to happen. I don't want him dead -- just
    occupying EF's attention, is all, so they stay off of US...
    
    If he "screws me" by throwing centers to Germany, well...so be it.  But
    I don't think he'll do that in a demo game.
    
    Frankly, I get a little dismayed by his actions.  They remind me of the
    5 year-old's threats of "If we don't play my way, I'm taking my ball and
    going home" response.  THAT's why I think he's "above that" and may be
    making some of this as theatrics.  But if it's not theatrics, then it's
    silly:  he's penalizing ME for a security breach, when you and Edi are
    equally un-QCish (though you and I not be desire, admittedly)...so he'll
    wildly flail against the only guy he can hurt for his loss of anti-F
    help???  Hopefully not...
    
    I mean, what do YOU think?  Are you willing to risk me facing an enraged
    Germany with an even (or loss) build count, just to satisfy Eng honor
    and have him be "my buddy" against G?  Does this detract from the
    anti-Edi crusdae?   You tell me; I want honest ally feedback here...
    
    Thanks, pardner...

    GKJ,
    OK, back at the terminal, and ready to review this missive!  I'll type
    as I read (always a dangerous thing), so the 'first cut" may not be
    vintage Fassio...but when the 'vintage' is right up there with Mad Dog
    and Boone's farm, I guess that's ok!  Hope this finds you well.
    
    ADMIN NOTE:  I'm sure the other 14 messages in my queue may say this,
    but if it doesn't, I'm also at a new (home) e-mail address, to allow
    evening communications (post 5 p.m.):  fazfam@juno.com.
    
    OK, your note...
    
    >I'm not sure what else there is to discuss. What I meant was, I now have
    >your message loud and clear. And you could not have had mine more plainly,
    >I think, so I have nothing more to add.
    ** OK, interpreted as such by me!  The "loud and clear" part from me
    wasn't meant to "yell," but I know what you mean.  It is an unequivocal
    transmission not loved by English ears.
    >
    >After a little more thought, I believe I understand your reasoning. There
    >were a lot of rationalizations in your last few notes, but you did come
    >right out and say you were doing some cold cost-benefit analysis. To you,
    >the benefit of screwing me out of Norway is worth the cost of friendship.
    >How could this be, I wonder. How could that center possibly be worth the
    >headache you'll incur?
    ** Before I read further, let me game it out and answer here, then see
    if it matches as I go down the line.
    1) From the cost-benefit side:  I reasoned, is English friendship AT
    THIS TIME worth one center?  In other words, do I need this center given
    the board set-up, or should I possibly sacrifice Russian defense to stay
    chummy with England...an England who should know a survival instinct
    when he sees one?
    2) I then said, is one center worth hacking off Pitt, who clearly holds
    the leverage over me AT THIS TIME?  Again, is the honor of keeping
    England even (and facing Germany) worth the reality of me keeping Pitt
    quiet (hopefully) and staying solvent, to boot?
    3) Lastly, I reasoned, is England a grudge player who will carry this
    slight over Nwy to his grave in some sort of snit, or will he calculate
    and deal as expected?
    I thus decided for short-term greed, schizo security feelings, and the
    hope that you'll be amenable for future discussions.  The board's set-up
    in Fall 1902 will obviously affect the ER dealings and
    correspondence....
    >I think I know.
    >Stabbing me, and continuing to twist the dagger, you think, is cost-free.
    ** How so, "continuing to twist the dagger?"  You mean, sailing Nwy to
    Nwg and then continuing to hit you with German help?  Hadn't been my
    intent....
    >Doing something that might possibly, in some conceivable way, make Germany
    >the tiniest bit cross with you, that is a cost. Giving up your stolen booty
    >is a cost. But you think there is no cost to stabbing me, because you
    >honestly don't believe I would ever carry out my threat.
    ** No,  untrue.  I'm HOPING you don't get into this "jihad" vs the
    available guy" mode, but if you do, then I expect a timed assault (while
    you shift to BAR, Nwg, etc, and make my life a nuisance.  And I'll
    build F STP(nc) in such an event).  I just reasoned that the
    "cost-benefit" for you would make it a less than optimal choice, is all.
      But no, I expect you to try something of that variety if you're mad
    >enough....
    >
    >Here is something I thought I'd explained adequately, but I see that I have
    >to explain it again.
    >
    >You write of "moral rage" and "venting spleen", of "kamikaze rage" and
    >"going off half cocked". I've carefully explained to you my motivations,
    >and you ought to know that those are not appropriate terms. What I must do
    >is to demonstrate that your judgment of costs and benefits was incorrect
    >and mine was correct. I am calculating coldly, rest assured.
    
    ** Ha!  Semi-vindication of my above para.  And while I tend to write
    colorfully at times, there are psychological implications of what I
    write....they don't always work, but it's part of the game
    correspondence.   You are the antithesis of erratic, kamikaze behavior,
    from what I've seen.
    
    My thrust is this, GKJ:  I don't want one center to be the bone of
    contention betwene us.  I know for you this is symptomatic of a larger
    trust (and security) issue, rather than just Nwy.
    I just feel this way:
    Edi hosed me, and I hosed Hohn, yet we're all communicating and ready to
    bargain with whomever, whenever, to make our countries secure.  I fully
    expect you to try and nail me, even possibly with German help(!)
    Nothing would surprise me this game.  But I would also HOPE that you
    realize there is "ER life beyond 1902" and I sincerely hope our comm
    lines haven't been irretrievanly shattered just because of this.
    
    Calculate away, oh cold one.

    Jamie, this is a short answer that is preceding a longer answer that
    won't come back to you today.  I do indeed know that you were walking
    up to the line in a way that you wouldn't have done under other
    circumstances.  So, I am in agreement with your statements in

    the various house rule debates.  Still, I must think about your
    comments further.  I do see that you have your orders in with set wait.
    We're fine for right now.  It's your choice whether or not to

    >chummy with England...an England who should know a survival instinct
    >when he sees one?
    
    I know a survival instinct, yes I do. You are screwing me for your fifth
    center or your sixth. You are reducing me to three centers. I've got a keen
    survival instinct.
    
    But to me this means, I have to put something on the table that counts for
    something. And I really don't have much. So what I put on the table is
    this: give me what is due to me, what was promised, and I am your friend to
    the end; otherwise, I'm your enemy to the end. I have to put up high
    stakes, because my survival is on the line.
    
    You don't believe I am serious about that, that's the problem. My problem,
    and it will be yours, too. But, you'll see.
    
    
    >2) I then said, is one center worth hacking off Pitt, who clearly holds
    >the leverage over me AT THIS TIME?
    
    I think this is pure pretense. The idea that Pitt would drop this all-out
    attack against me and spend seasons re-arranging his units to attack you is
    totally ridiculous.
    
    >  Again, is the honor of keeping
    >England even (and facing Germany) worth the reality of me keeping Pitt
    >quiet (hopefully) and staying solvent, to boot?
    
    If it were only honor? Maybe not. That's why I have upped the stakes.
    
    For some players, honor is enough. I had hoped you were one of those. Since
    you aren't, I have to put more chips on the table. So I have.
    
    
    >3) Lastly, I reasoned, is England a grudge player who will carry this
    >slight over Nwy to his grave in some sort of snit, or will he calculate
    >and deal as expected?
    
    Again, you are quite deliberately misdescribing my motivations. I'll let
    that slide. I suppose you are just trying to get me mad.
    
    I'll calculate my deal all right. But what will I be aiming to maximize?
    You assume I will always aim to maximize my survival duration. Not true. I
    will maximize my effect on the game in my dying years. I know how to do
    that now.
    
    
    >>Stabbing me, and continuing to twist the dagger, you think, is cost-free.
    >** How so, "continuing to twist the dagger?"  You mean, sailing Nwy to
    >Nwg and then continuing to hit you with German help?  Hadn't been my
    >intent....
    
    No.
    Stabbing me last move. Then, promising me that if I help convince Hohn to
    join you instead of Edi, you will give me Norway. Then, after I have done
    that, saying, "Hah, sucker, you mean you actually BELIEVED that?"
    
    That's twisting. And if that's the way it is, then you are someone with
    whom there is no point in dealing at all. There is zero expectation that
    you will carry through.
    
    
    >** No,  untrue.  I'm HOPING you don't get into this "jihad" vs the
    >available guy" mode, but if you do, then I expect a timed assault (while
    >you shift to BAR, Nwg, etc, and make my life a nuisance.  And I'll
    >build F STP(nc) in such an event).
    
    You will build F Stp if I move to Bar now. Interesting.
    
    In that case, you will have gained absolutely nothing by stabbing me! You
    won't have that unit to play in the south. So, you are stabbing me for no
    gain at all.
    
    And what if I don't move to Bar now? Will you then figure that I won't move
    there next Spring? Or will you build in StP anyway?
    
    I'll tell you what. I warn you: you had better build in StP this winter, no
    matter where my fleets are.
    
    
    
    
    >My thrust is this, GKJ:  I don't want one center to be the bone of
    >contention betwene us.
    
    Then give me the bone. That's the only way out.
    
    What you really mean is, you want the center and you don't want me to try
    to do anything about it. You want your stab to be cost-free. It will not
    be. You can mark that down in your book of certainties. Other things are
    merely probable, unlikely, possible... this is certain: stab me as you are
    stabbing me and I will do something about it.
    
    >I know for you this is symptomatic of a larger
    >trust (and security) issue, rather than just Nwy.
    
    True.
    
    >I just feel this way:
    >Edi hosed me, and I hosed Hohn, yet we're all communicating and ready to
    >bargain with whomever, whenever, to make our countries secure.  I fully
    >expect you to try and nail me, even possibly with German help(!)
    >Nothing would surprise me this game.  But I would also HOPE that you
    >realize there is "ER life beyond 1902" and I sincerely hope our comm
    >lines haven't been irretrievanly shattered just because of this.
    
    
    Not at all. I will continue to communicate with you. I'll set up a
    telegraph office in St Petersburg.
    
    But it still does seem to me that you simply don't believe I'll carry out
    my threats. Because if you did, your own cool cost-benefit analysis would
    tell you that continuing to stab me isn't worth it, it will be costlier to
    you than pulling out your dagger. So, you don't believe me. I take that as
    a challenge.

<p><a name=144></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=008800>Italy</font>:</b><pre>
    I keep four folders for game-related stuff.  "Ghodstoo" is for stuff I
    receive from my fellow players; "Ghodsent" is for copies of stuff *I*
    send out; "Results" is self-explanatory, and; "Ghodstalk" is for stuff
    like the broadcast below, observer comments, messages from Jim-Bob,
    anything that doesn't fit in the other folders.
    
    Unfortunately, I now am finding a problem with Netscape Gold, which I
    use as a newsreader.  Seems that once I name a folder, I can't change
    the name without deleting the whole thing.  After reading the notes
    today from Hohn, Jamie and Mark, I am forced to admit that "Ghodstalk"
    must be changed to "gd_whine".  Anyone have any suggestions about
    changing the folder name?
    
    I am quite surprised to have to remind the people in THIS game that
    we are, in fact, playing a game.  All our communications are being
    archived for future players to read.  I sure wouldn't want to go down
    in Dip "history" as having authored some of the childishness I've read
    recently.
    
    Lighten up, folks!
    
    Cal
    
    PS: I'm not just picking on the three people who have written broadcasts
    today.  The whole tone of communications has gotten pretty whiny lately.
    Stabbing is part of the game.  Learn to live with it without the
    pettiness.

    ** Indeed.  And I've already echange of two NASTYgrams with him today.
    I'll wager it's personality  more than game at this stage.  If he's a

    "clients"), then he's probably as type A anal-rententive as I am, wants
    the last word, etc etc...We're not getting along well, unfortunately.
    (If I wasn't so anal, I'd keep mail linger than 45 seconds, and send you

    ** I agree, to a point.  But that puts me COMPLETELY at his trust, and
    gives me nowhere else to build.  Now, G is after me to sail for Nwg this
    turn...says he's determined to take you down (I had asked him to build
    in MUN, go Mun-Tyo, then have my GAL retreat to BOH, and he, Cal and I
    put a whammy on VIE/TRI.  All I got was a "hmmmm....let mt think about
    that...I expect you to hold off the southern hordes..." and a "...that
    move would leave France alone over there..." ???
    I only thought of SEV as a way of making the AT fight for every inch.
    
    Now, that's probably the wrong mindset.  I KNOW I want Hohn to jump
    ship.  In fact, even in the most vitrioloc of our exchanges today, I've
    told him he's made great moves, I'm just "mad" at myself for my own

    two related points:
    1) edi sent a note today, implying he'd like me to keep F Bla, and to
    tell Hohn I'm fighting (vice surrending dots to G).  He thinks Hohn will
    then NOT destroy F BLA (to allow me an army rebuild), but will instead
    play cat-and-mouse with it down south.  Now, as I've told Hohn, why
    would EDI ask me to fight on and keep the fleet active....?
    
    2) Edi also mentioned a snippet about "Germany being part of the plan"
    to keep FE occupied...don't know if it was a generic statement, meaning
    I should worry about the Balkans, or whether the expected A-G Axis is
    really here underneath all the layers....

    As if I had to say anything about this:
    
    To my view, so is whining, at times.  Everything is part of the game.
    I guess I just want to say that all is fine with me and to say that
    I haven't had a chance to read through all of this (plus the private
    stuff) and won't until tomorrow some time.  If there is anything
    urgent for me to see before then, please send it to me at
    burgess@world.std.com outside of the judge and I will get to it.
    
    I also think it is important for the Gm to tell people where he is.
    
    Thanks for your understanding,

    Hey Guys:
    I think I'm hooked up for home.  JUNO being what it is, however, doesn't
    have "real time viewing," i.e.,  the lines only open long enough to
    send/receive that 'dose" of e-mail.     So by the time the Judge sends
    the comeback copy (or you reply 5 mins later), it's another dime to open
    the lines again to receive.
    
    Anyway, I'll try and access Juno at least a couple times a night--maybe
    moreso tomorrow and/or Fri, as those are my only two 'real' days to
    negotiate before I take that 6-day leave (Sat-Thu)...and I imagine the
    next due date will be next WED, the 19th.

    Hi Edi
    
    I won't be able to read any reply you send until the 21st, as I'm leaving
    in about 30 mins (and I doubt you're reading this a 3:30 a.m....but you
    never know).
    
    I'd like to know if there's a chance for further cooperation or not, and,
    if so, when and how.   Quite honestly, if there's not -- or if you're
    just going to try and bamboozle me -- then I'll work to get G and I
    energized in the west, and T to the east, and try to hit your country
    from every direction.  Now, whil;e that sounds extremely bellicose, you
    surely realize the "bellicosity" is coming from desperation, not
    arrogance.  I'm in a "hurt box," and need some relief.  As YOU are the
    one who have maneuvered so as to get behind Hohn (to the point I'm not
    even in SEV anymore), then I was hoping you would help take a hand in
    re-altering the balance down there.  I'd certainly like to get AND KEEP
    Sev and Rum (either order would be fine); beyond that, you can be the
    Grand Puppeteer down south for all I care...
    
    Anyway, we can work a deal if you're serious and interested.  if not, we
    can continue to fight.  If the latter, I will work on Pitt to provide
    some aid (and to come 'rescue' me), I will work to keep Italy active vs
    you, and I will try and wean Hohn away (yeah, right).  I'd have no other
    option if that was the case.
    
    if you want to realistically deal, I'll work on Italy to call him off,
    and forget about asking Pitt for stuff.  But I'd like to hear your view
    on things, and what there even IS to 'deal on the table."
    
    Your thoughts?
    
    See you in a5 days or so...

    Cal,
    One more thought, based on your last note.
    
    Independent of your note to me, I also relooked the board, and sent the
    following to Hohn just now.  Note how I make it "us" vs Aus and Ita,
    i.e., this keeps A/I fighting, we gain, etc etc.  I'd ultimately love to
    chop off the stringy necks of both A and T, but first we need Hohn's
    help.
    
    I asked him to essentially tell me what's WRONG with a three-way dump on
    Edi.  I imagine I'll be 'amused' at the reply...if I get one.
    
    Take care of your ankle and your sickness.  Don't breathe on me from

    Hohn
    Was relooking over the map.  Assuming you're serious about cooperation,
    why don't we smoke Edi ASAP with Cal?  It can be done -- he can't defend

    In the south the (hated) Russian F Bla * could * get out of your hair by
    going to BUL...again, we can GUARANTEE its fall this way...you can
    always annihilate it later and make some sort of swap as we deal in
    Rum-Sev-Bul-Bud ownerships...you know, the rough parity thing...
    
    In this arrangement, we "could" all go +1.  But at the minimum, SOMEONE
    goes +1, or maybe more.  And Edi DOES get reduced.
    
    The more I look at it, the more appeal it has.  Cal will surely bite,
    and his support can be crucial for us this turn.  Plus, it keeps Aus and
    Ita fighting!
    
    I'm curious to hear your critique of this plan.

    I wrote a LONG letter to Hohn trying to sell him on the idea of a sneak
    attack on Edi.  Between he and I (and with maybe a little help from
    you),
    we could take up to three centres off him in one swell foop.  He hasn't
    replied and it's now the second evening after I wrote.  I hope that
    means
    he's thinking long and hard about it.  I think I'll try and phone him
    tonight and push it that way.  FYI, I DIDN'T try to get him to back off
    from you because I didn't want him thinking I had ulterior (ie
    pro-Russian)
    motives.  If he goes along with my plan, I figure that will buy you some
    time anyway.

    I'm not sure how I like Pitt being in Tyrolia as that gives him an early
    foot across the stalemate line, but if he does then it at least means
    Edi is doomed.  I can work with that.  Better though if Hohn can come
    over to our (well, for now, MY) side.

    Better than fine.  If he builds a fleet in Ankara, that puts the kibosh
    on my plans and probably my future...

    Hi Cal,
    Will be departing here shortly, and wanted to drop a line before the
    screen went dark for a week.  Hope you're doing ok.
    
    Turkey has been expressing a "tentative" interest in working together,
    but "only as it involves realigning the front (ha!)" and that 'there's
    no way in hell we can work together if you think you're getting both SEV
    and RUM back, even next year."
    
    Man, there's a great way to be diplomatic.  God, he's just lording his
    control over me right now, and it's painful to smile through it.  He has
    the attitude of "take it or leave it" if I want his terms, so for now
    I'll take it.  But I keep telling myself, Edi's the one behind this all,
    and _we must press on with his doom._  I hope you continue to share that
    thought.
    
    In that regard:  I've asked Germany to build/move Mun-Tyo.  Coupled with
    you in Ven and Adr (and me soon to be in BOH when he boots me out of
    GAL), we can put a severe hurt on Vienna and points north.
    
    Hohn's out to crush my F Bla; has already said he's building F Ank and

    Hi Hohn
    Quick reply...

    >  And if that means you need to defer taking RUM
    >until later, that's what I'll need to see.
    
    ** I won't be in any position to take both centers anyway, you know
    that.  You'll kill BLA and Edi will boot me out of GAL, so I'll get one,
    if I'm lucky.  You're overly concerned on this point.
    
    > I have no objection to the
    >idea of giving it back to you when I can get builds in other places,
    >but to be blunt, there's no way in hell I can agree to work with you
    >if you expect to take both back this year.  Or even by next year if
    >you would have more centers than me.
    
    ** That's understandable, but the reverse is true too.  You require
    rough parity, but so do I.
    I'm at 5 with a (small) second front up north.  You're at 5 with NO
    second front (yet?) in the west.  You will gain ANYTHING sooner than me
    at this stage, Hohn.  After the "love taps" we've both done to each
    other, we'll both need to "'fess up" fair-and-square to make this work.
    But we _have_ the whole Balkan front to "slice the pie" to fit both our
    security desires!   There's more than enough to go around....
    
    I'm sitting here as I type this, trying to figure out what good you'd
    get by hitting Edi, and what good you'd do by staying with him, and
    doing a cost-benefit analysis.  I'm hoping the lure of many red centers
    entices you more than the thought of no more white ones.
    
    >I just want to be up front.
    
    ** Good.  No surprises next turn, then.
    
    Btw, being "up-front" might address that ARM and BLA question at a
    not-too-distant point in the future..???  I don't require/want/expect
    any specifics as to convoys, movements away, etc...just a truthful "no
    threat to you" response.   If you can utter those words without your
    nose growing 10 feet, RT cooperation will go a VERY long way.
    
    >If this requirement of mine sinks any
    >chance of us working together, so be it.
    
    It doesn't.  It _sounds_ cavalier; very
    "take-it-or-leave-it-I'm-in-the-driver's-seat."  But I know by you that
    you're fond of directness, and I have no desire to be the one to
    re-upset the applecart of cooperation at this stage.  (Of course, you
    haven't said whether you're riding the cart w/me or not--only that we'll
    assess the situation (uh, yeah).)
    
    This is the best I can hope for, and it's a darn sight better than
    fighting a definite AT.     Agreed.

    Regarding the bulk of the letter, it seems we're in agreement.
    
    Regarding RUM and SEV specifically, I want you to know that in any
    scenario where the two of us work together, I'll require rough parity
    between us in centers.  And if that means you need to defer taking RUM
    until later, that's what I'll need to see.  I have no objection to the

    you would have more centers than me.
    
    I just want to be up front.  If this requirement of mine sinks any

    Mark,
    
    Bottom line for me is that I'm certainly willing to deal and work
    together.  As for your security concerns, I can only tell you that
    I'll be happy to demilitarize BLA if and when we work out a
    substantive deal, which probably won't be until after Spring moves at
    least.  What guarantees do you have that I won't stab?  Absolutely
    none.  But as you say, there's little you can do about it.  I
    recommend that you simply look to your defense until I unilaterally
    pull out of BLA per some prearranged agreement.
    
    Sound reasonable?

    Hi Hohn
    Thanks for the note; "one for the road," as it is.   Hope this finds you
    well.
    
    As my previous day's notes generally alluded to, I was more upset with
    myself for believing all the moral pap and the guilt trips you applied,
    rather than with the stab itself.   It was a fine stab! The fact that
    you planned this whole thing all along--stab included--while abusing
    _me_ (in a game sense) for the same thing is just bitter irony that no
    player likes to be reminded of.  But,  all part of a good the game, what
    can I say?   (I also forgot that Edi and you knew each other from
    previous games--hence a degree of friendship and 'insider knowledge" of
    each others' styles, as opposed to "outsider" Fassio.  I should've had
    little hackles raising on my neck...getting too old for this stuff...)
    
    OK, moralizing and rationalizing now all washed away.  Trust remains the
    only big issue.  Why should I trust you to stop at BLA after you get it?
     Why not use it as a convoy force for further aggression?  But of course
    this is all rhetorical...there's nothing I can do to prevent you from
    killing BLA, so I am, indeed, a "captive audience."  And so I am ready
    to deal--as I was last turn.
    >The question now is: where do we go from here?  It would be easy to
    >write each other off and just be enemies for the rest of this game.
    >But I submit that my impending build and our upcoming moves present us
    >with a unique opportunity: the chance to demilitarize and reorganize
    >such that we are in more secure positions, all while not needing to
    >rely on the others' goodwill and promises.
    
    ** As with the above -- I believe you.  But how does having YOU in BLA
    contribute to "demilitarization" -- unless you plan to sail out after
    you kill off MY BLA?  Is it not just a case of the "shoe on the other
    foot" if we substitute Turkish unease over BLA with a Russian unease?
    >
    >I am going to build F ANK and dislodge you in BLA.
    
    ** Ok; figured as much.  I'll plan accordingly.
    
    >It is my sincere
    >hope that I can destroy that fleet.
    ** How could you not destroy it, with 2 vs 1?   I can't stop you, and of
    course Edi wouldn't do anything against you.
    
    >You have an extremely high chance
    >of dislodging me from SEV,
    ** (or RUM, don't forget)
    
    >and quite possibly destroying THAT unit. We can do these things, which are in

    * I'm with you on this one, Hohn, but...are we talking perhaps some
    LONG-TERM dealing here?  Because if we are, I'd hate to think we have to
    keep 'checking six" on each other while simultaneously trying to
    value-maximize.   Now, if you're merely offering tactical restructuring
    ("here Mark, try and get one of your two seized centers back"), then
    it's a very optimal short-term approach.
    >
    >I submit that once we arrange a swap, we'll be much more comfortable.
    ** Yes, once that Turkish BLA fleet gets addressed....or that guy in
    ARM....???
    
    >I'll have achieved my original goal of a Russia-free BLA, which indeed
    >solves the age-old problem of what to do with that fleet anyway.
    >You'll have a secure southern border.
    ** Secure as in "up to the water's edge," and nothing further in the
    Balkans?  Or perhaps a glimmer of hope for retaking RUM while you, shall
    we say, expand elsewhere?
    
    >And we can THEN move on to
    >other options if we so choose.
    
    ** The "we" here applies to _you_, Hohn.  As of last turn (and into this
    turn!) I was/am ready for "other options."   I have no desire for
    continued AT.  You've got to make the commitment.
    
    >Options that require an initially low
    >amount of coordination (in the sense of you supporting my moves and me
    >supporting yours), until we can gradually rebuild our trust and work
    >together more substantively, if that is what we desire.
    
    ** The old joke:  "We?" Do you have a mouse in your pocket?   :>)
    
    I'll say it this way, as you like bluntness (but please don't interpret
    this as a sour-grapes, or a smart-a** reply...it's not....maybe I should
    say 'direct,' vice 'blunt.'):
    
    1) I don't want an AT.
    2) I'll do whatever I need to do to convince you to work with me, but
    _not_ with the same unease you professed, only now dumped back at me.
    After all, if you planned this for awhile, what's to say you're not just
    stringing me along now, to break the 'final defense line" with Edi?
    Right?   Trust works both ways.
    3) You appear to be offering--right now--a short-term "straightening of
    the lines", IN THE EVENT "we" decide "we" want to deal with each other.
    That's ok by me, for now, but see #s 1 and 2, above.
    4) I think Edi and Cal would collapse like a house of cards if you and I
    worked things out.  I urge you to consider that approach.  I've already
    been bugging Pitt to send an A Tyo in this turn, so when Edi boots me
    out, I retreat to BOH, giving a joint G/I/R hit on Vienna.   That's just
    one phase of a larger plan -- and the bulk of Austrian booty is in YOUR
    neighborhood.  I just want RUM and perhaps one of Edi's domains, nothing
    more.  FG are the long-term threats to you and me.
    5) I won't be made a chump again.  I GLADLY accept your ideas and your
    intent for better relations!   But good play or not, if you and Edi
    stick together,  count on seeing a strong Germany in your neighborhood
    very quickly.  I will do everything I can to bring your two empires
    down.
    6) I don't want #5 to happen to any of us.  I want good RT relations.
    
    Fair enough?
    
    If you can answer my questions of security (post-BLA Sea positioning,
    the guy in ARM, etc), I'd love to hear them..  if you're going to say
    "I'm afraid I can't comment on that right now," then spare the
    keystrokes.   -grin-
    
    BOTTOM LINE:  I'm here, I'm willing to deal, and once "you" want to do
    it, "we" can get the ball rolling.  I would enjoy it, after spewing
    verbiage back and forth.
    
    I'll be here 'till 4 if you can reply; if not, the juno.com line will be
    up tonight, or when I get back.
    
    Thanks again for the letter, Hohn.  Have a good weekend!

    Mark,
    
    A quick note before you leave.
    
    I'm dispensing with all of the moral/ethical type discussion.  As far
    as I'm concerned, none of it really matters any more.  We now both
    have "unclean hands," and the question is simply whether we ever want
    to bother to try to get past it.  And yes, I did hammer away at you
    morally all while plotting to use that to my advantage.  And I'm sure
    that does look incongruous in light of the result.  All I can tell you
    is that it was part of my conscious negotiation strategy for that
    turn, although I don't know whether that makes you feel better or
    worse.  Of course, it was nothing personal.  I just felt that it was
    to my better interest to stab you in that situation.
    
    The question now is: where do we go from here?  It would be easy to
    write each other off and just be enemies for the rest of this game.
    But I submit that my impending build and our upcoming moves present us
    with a unique opportunity: the chance to demilitarize and reorganize
    such that we are in more secure positions, all while not needing to
    rely on the others' goodwill and promises.
    
    I am going to build F ANK and dislodge you in BLA.  It is my sincere
    hope that I can destroy that fleet.  You have an extremely high chance
    of dislodging me from SEV, and quite possibly destroying THAT unit.
    We can do these things, which are in our best interests, without the
    need for cooperation from the other.  It's the best kind of trust,
    Mark.  The kind that isn't needed. ;)
    
    I submit that once we arrange a swap, we'll be much more comfortable.
    I'll have achieved my original goal of a Russia-free BLA, which indeed
    solves the age-old problem of what to do with that fleet anyway.
    You'll have a secure southern border.  And we can THEN move on to
    other options if we so choose.  Options that require an initially low
    amount of coordination (in the sense of you supporting my moves and me
    supporting yours), until we can gradually rebuild our trust and work
    together more substantively, if that is what we desire.
    
    That's what I think, Mark.  Please let me know what your thoughts are.

     I WON'T READ ANY MAIL SENT TO THE USMA.EXMAIL ADDRESS (this one) UNTIL
    MON, 24 MARCH.
    
     (Oh, Edi:  yes, per your question, the juno.com address is permanent,
    altho' I only read it after 5 p.m. on weeknights (all day on weekends).
    
    3) IF you _really_ want to deal, you can try and reach me at (412)
    842-7366 from Sun-Wed.  If I'm not out building pinewood derby cars or
    model rockets, eating cookies, shooting the .22 in the woods, or a
    combination of the above, I'd love to talk!
    
    4) Finally, one football-related note:  Edi wonders what kind of teams
    are associated w/the players here.  I think that's a neat "initiative."
    
    I've already figured I AM a Steeler, a "meat-and-potatoes" offesne with
    no great insightful 'trick moves' (even the ones I TRY and run!), no
    special teams support, and occasional flashes of great gaming, followed
    by games-long lack of offensive drive.  VERY mch the persona of my team.
    
    I find it interesting that Edi picks the Niners, the
    plastic/astroturf/TEFLON, pull-it-out-your-booty
    while-doing-it-with-great-skill-team.  Much as I "hate" SF for winning
    more Bowls than Pgh, I have to admit that they WERE the team of the 80s
    (and Edi IS a team in his own right)!  Of course, 'Frisco did it with a
    QB from western PA....go figure!!
    
    Take care, guys.  I'm here all day until 4 p.m., then off the net 'till
    the 21st at HOME.

    Actually the experience of Postal Diplomacy is probably substantially clearer
    on this aspect. There is no doubt that the injection of the written word
    without faces, sounds and delivery enhance misscommunication and players are
    more encouraged to go off on the deep end and to be less willing to retreat
    from public positions.  The history of postal play is rife with feuds which
    are fueled by the written blasts that people level at one another.
    
    One of the main reasons for the promotion of the face to face DipCon (and I
    was there at the begining) was to get feuding players together in a face to
    face so that a lot of the hostility can be broken down.  As we move towards
    our 30th year of a DipCon in Seattle this August, I have to say that it has
    been a successful effort at introducing people from around the country and has
    helped to reduce friction.
    
    So Mark is quite right that the nature of Email communication encourages
    friction, which is also why I strongly urge all of you in your Diplomacy to
    also use the phone as a means of communication since it allows you to soften
    approaches and react in a little more social manner.  It is after all a social

    I am much more powerful than he.  He only has high-powered weapons
    and futuristic gadgets, while I have dumptrucks full of paper and the
    resources of the greatest state in the world.  It wouldn't even be close.
    
    >Is Texas A&M the same as Texas Tech?
    
    No.  I know more about the differences between Texas and Texas A&M,
    however.  For cheerleaders, Texas uses pretty girls who wear nice
    outfits and use pom-poms.  Texas A&M uses young boys dressed in
    tight white t-shirts and shorts who use homo-erotic gestures to whip the
    Aggie crowd into a frenzy.
    
    For a mascot, Texas uses a manly, mighty Longhorn steer.  A&M uses a
    cute little doggie.  (The inbred Oklahomans use a "Sooner," which is a
    person who violated the law by stealing Indian land by forcibly taking it
    over.  Such an inspiration.)
    
    Texas fans simply show up at the game and cheer their team to victory.
    Functionally retarded A&M fans have "yell practice" where they practice
    cheering for their team, in conjunction with the above-mentioned
    homo-erotic gestures from their cheerleaders.  One of their more famous
    "yells" consists of all of them putting their hands on their knees and
    swaying back and forth and moaning.
    
    Texas is a co-ed school.  Texas A&M is an all-male school where men
    are men and sheep are women.  Sometimes you will see "female" A&M
    students but these are really men who are giving their fellow "students"
    some variety.
    
    Texas has a wide variety of students, from all walks of life, all races,
    and all types of background.  A&M students are all named Bubba Joe,
    wear Perot-like flat tops haircuts, and are all in something called "The
    Corps" where they all dress up in military-type uniforms and pretend to
    be army guys.
    
    Texas fans salute their team with a neat, powerful symbol called "Hook
    'em Horns," where the index and little finger are outstreched.  Aggies
    salute their team with a pathetic imitation of "Hook 'em Horns" called "Gig
    'em Aggies" which consists of the highly unoriginal thumbs up sign.
    They also use the Hook 'em Horns sign upside down (so do the inbred
    Sooners) since they can't think of anything original.  Nobody really wants
    to know what it means to "gig" somebody.
    
    The Texas fight song is an uplifting number which encourages the team
    to do their best.  The A&M fight song contains the line, "Goodbye to
    Texas Uni . . .versity."  (A&M people get a kick out of saying "T.U."
    instead of "U.T."  Obviously, Aggies are quite mentally challenged.)  (The
    inbred Oklahomans use a fight song which goes, "Boomer Sooner,
    Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner,
    Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner,
    Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner,
    Boomer Sooner, Boomer Sooner."  Nobody wants to know what this
    means.)
    
    Finally, Texas has won more Big 12 football championships than A&M,
    Oklahoma, and the rest of the Big 12 *combined*.
    
    HOOK 'EM HORNS!!!!!!!!!!!

    Judge elDRED (any relation to the Sly Stallone character Judge Dredd?)
    is indeed correct.  The Steelers  manhandled the egotistical, overpaid
    and sometimes-arrested-but-never-convicted Cowboys only TWICE in the
    20th century, not thrice.  I had Dallas confused with Minnesota and the
    (former)  LA Lambs, equally great powerhouses (sniff) in their time.
    Suffice it to say, though, that the majority of folks watching that game
    were no doubt universally rooting for ABD (Anyone But Dallas), the
    self-styled "Albania's Team."
    
    But pleeeease, don't get me started about this!  if you think I whine
    about Dip (we ARE in a game, aren't we?), don't start me on
    football....As for last season's 28-3 whupping in beantown, I can only
    say, yes, we got whupped.

    As a resident of Denver and a large fan of the local team, which will remain
    nameless here and which may not even remain local unless a new stadium is
    approved and...er...constructed, I must say that I have absolutely no problem
    adhering to Jamie's completely legitimate request.  As someone who, if it
    weren't for the fact that complaining is forbidden in this game, would admit
    to having had the same feelings regarding the Cowboys that he has had ever
    since a certain sad day in 1978, I only regret that this sensible rule of
    Jamie's is probably not extensible into the real world.  (Another indication
    that Diplomacy is superior than the real world.)

    a lucky interception in the end zone on the last play of the game.  O.K.,

    pass and because Cliff Barnes had a phantom pass interference penalty

    >Austria: Fleet Aegean Sea -> Greece.
    
    Now I understand it. It was the usual austrian opening to get Greece with
    the fleet, but the Admiral is incompetent and it took him two years circling
    around the coast before finding a port.
    
    Italy seem to be pretty well set up for a convoy to Tunis and a Lepanto, I
    imagine that the fleet in Adr is not real, just disinformation.
    
    FG are trying to explain me why I never saw the english "welsh" opening
    (I forgot the name) before, but maybe moving to the Nth rather than Nwg last
    spring would have made quite a difference.
    
    Russia managed to lose Sev being nice with Turkey. It seems that the paranoid
    who suggest never to trust the one you stabbed, especially in fall, have
    some reasons to do so after all.
    
    Germany and Austria seem to have all the options and control the Continent,
    maybe they will soon turn against each other.
    
    What did France do to convince all the others to back off. Was it simply
    a consequence of Austria threatening Italy and of Germany not wanting a
    possible junior partnership with England and seeing a great chance in the Nth?
    Or maybe France managed to say "it's not fair if you all attack me, at least
    *you* should back off" to all of his neighbours individually?
    
    Turkey is a lawyer? If what they say it's true he will soon be at the throat
    of Austria and Italy, and possibly manage to have Norway to fight on his side.

    As a Mavericks fan, I feel that the NBA should give Dallas' pick back to
    them.  Sorry, Celtics, but it's for the good of the league.  The NBA can't

    I agree. Though he has done little, it has been of the greatest possible

    of Austria's opening. However, I have little interest in interest. It's the
    principal of the thing that matters, and St. Cal the Archaic is nothing if
    not principled. (In fact, though, he is not principled. Ergo, he is

    I actually am trying to read (or at least skim) all of the press.  This
    morning I am getting caught up on the last few days..... I think Edi
    has it about right in his message yesterday.  To my mind, if E-Mailers
    are going to be better players (by my definition with more levels of
    the game engaged) they also have to be willing to break down the
    "feud factor" by meeting on other levels as Edi suggested.  It is
    something to ponder. Then again, as I know, many E-Mailers do not
    want to play games on that level.... thus anonymous games.  As you
    must realize, this game could NOT proceed in this manner (lawyer
    jokes and mascot jokes at the minimum, but much more than that)
    without the identities of the players known.

    I most heartily agree with the Grand Doge Cal's recent (shrill) complaint
    to the effect that whining has no place whatsoever in Diplomacy.
    
    I would like to add that I am very disturbed by another, similar trend.
    Many, many of the messages that I have received (and I certainly do not
    mean to single out Cal, who is merely the worst offender) contain words
    that start with the letter 'b'. This really is uncalled for. It's just a
    game! This is Diplomacy! It's not as though it were computer programming,
    or something really important! There is simply no reason that you have to
    use words that, uh, start with the letter 'b'. I think we all have large
    enough vocabularies that we can easily avoid such words altogether. Get
    yourself a good thesaurus if you must.
    
    There, I've said my piece.
    
    Oh, wait. I also think that there is entirely too much complaining. Did I
    say that already? It's the most important thing I want to say. And I really
    wish Jim would do something about it, instead of just sitting around
    smoking those fat cigars of his. Stinkin' up the place. Cancer. Supporting
    communist governments. Throw 'em out, I say. And do something about the
    complaining.

    For one of Cal's seven hundred Dip-related files....
    
    What's a Russian's favorite "wine?"
    "Take me to Miami!"
    
    I agree with Cal.  Much of MY stuff is part whine, part sarcasm, and a
    dash of bitterness at myself.  Bitterness at allowing myself to be
    deceived by better players, and looking silly in front of people witb
    e-mail addresses like %$#^&yt*kf@geek.com.   (I imagine there are others
    who've felt that way at one time or another.)
    
    Part of the reason for this, I'll wager, is that not a few of us (and
    I'm in here) are Type A
    "last word" types, who respond in messages in the same intense way that
    they play Dip:  for a challenge, to let no challenge go by (verbal
    and/or game-related), or just because (in my case) we're crotchety old
    farts who havn't much else to do.
    
    And, to cite a theory of mine (good for toilet paper), I think computers
    encourage more "vebal lisence" than one would use comfortably in ftf
    encounters.  Maybe I'm wrong, but after sitting in on a couple chat
    rooms, where you're as anonymous as you want, with a fine e-mail name,
    you can be as nice or as obnoxious as you see fit, and no one can 'stop"
    you.  Hey, so I'm a psychologist in training; sue me!
    
    I'll save any vitriol for off-line comments.  But as far as acting
    rationally (ha!) because this stuff is being documented for posterity:
    I say no one but gamers reads it anyway--and we all already know he we
    act.  So I for one could give a flying fardullah if someone doesn't like
    it.   Heyyyy...maybe this could be the start of a HOBBY FUED, to breathe
    life into the hobby.......um, nah.
    
    It IS just a game of blocks, anyway....but oh, is it ever addictive.....
      :>)
    
    I promise to be a "kinder, gentler" Tsar, stabs and all.   Watch:
    1) Hohn is a swell guy.  I'm glad he got even with me and took my
    center.  I deserved it.
    2) Edi is a swell guy.  I'm glad he abandoned the QC and masterminded
    everyone to lose while he watches us all fight and gains from it.   I
    deserved it.
    3)  I'm glad I got England mad at me over Norway.  Now I have enemies on
    both flanks (why be niggardly about it, after all)?  I caused it AND
    deserved it!  (And Jamie even gives me verb declension advice on top of
    it all!)
    4) I LOVE THIS GAME!   And I love YOU, man!   (Whew; gotta stop taking
    these muscle relaxants...)

    Hohn:
    
    I suspect this will be the most important letter *I* write this game (at
    least from the point of view of Italy.
    
    As you can see, despite Edi's pleading with me to go to Eastern Med, I
    decided to stick with the attack on Austria.  Attacking you would serve
    no purpose except to place my units so far away from home as to be
    useless against an Austrian (or French) attack.  I'm hoping that you and
    I can now work together to make both our positions stronger.
    
    The way the board stands now, Pitt and John are very much in the
    driver's seat.  They stand to be finished with England within two or
    three turns.  Once he's taken care of they can present a united front
    towards the east.  With the way the east is now (you and Edi against
    Mark; Edi against me, you and I not cooperating), they (E/F) will be
    able to wade through the chaos.  Whichever of them stabs the other first
    would have a clear shot at an outright win.
    
    After thinking long and hard about the east, I'm convinced the only way
    to shorten the time before an eastern alliance emerges victorious is for
    you and I to team up.  I know you're still interested in taking out Mark
    - you can still continue to do this.  What I would ask is that you help
    me against Edi as well.  If we can do this properly, the element of
    surprise should allow us to take at least two of his centres
    immediately.  That would cripple him enough that we could have him down
    and out very fast.  Done right, we should be no more than a turn or so
    away from matching the pace of F/G as you and I come out on top in the
    east.
    
    If things worked out perfectly, we would have a shot of taking Gre, Bul
    & Tri in one turn.  The only share of centres I am asking is Tri, Vie &
    Ser (or Bud; your preference).  We can re-distribute later if need be.
    
    Well, please consider this offer.  I honestly think it's the only shot
    we have at being able to handle F/G given the current board situation,
    but we really need to work something out now.
    
    Please send me any questions you might have.
    
    Regards

    First:
    You won't be offended, I trust, by my broadcast. I've been abstaining, but
    couldn't miss the opportunity for some fun. And, it's calculated, of
    course. I have reasons for wanting the general populace to think I'm mad at
    you. In fact: take broadcasts quite generally with a grain of salt. I think
    it's like that in PBM, too, though I can't speak from experience.
    
    Now....
    
    >** My guess is that energize France and see what you guys can do.  Just
    >as I'm no threat to Hohn, neither is England a threat to France...but
    >those big black blocks in PIC may convince John of your offering....
    
    Yes, of course.
    
    You should always assume that I'm doing everything I can on that front.
    Only I don't generally tell you about it.
    
    
    >** You're right.  I'll be on him like a big dog to leave.  Only this

    Ahem.
    
    Think that through again, sir. And maybe read over some of those 500
    messages you sent me.
    
    The past is over. And in any case, you have no good grounds for resentment
    against Hohn. You started it.
    
    My advice, for what it's worth:
    take your losses, make it attractive to Hohn to get those Balkans and
    prevent Edi from becoming the big fish in the south.
    
    I've put off any plan to regain Norway. You ought to put off any plan to
    regain Sevastopol.
    
    Hard to swallow? Believe me, I know!

    No, ignore them. To quell your worries, have a look at the analysis they've
    given. Most observers will quite properly assume that they have no real
    clue about what's going on. The others' opinions should be of no interest

    Hohn,
    
    Much as I am enjoying seeing Mark suffer....
    
    You know, right, that he just tends to get a little overheated about the
    game. He just says whatever comes into his head. (I speak from personal
    experience--he's insulted me repeatedly then apologized profusely and
    apparently sincerely. It's kind of charming once you get used to it.) And I
    think he feels a little out of his league, like everyone else is an expert
    and he's just an ordinary player. I say this knowing that you will use the
    facts to your best advantage. (Just don't let Edi win, that's all.)
    
    He's right now got some fairly silly ideas about what has to happen before
    he'd flop over and help you against Austria, but I think those ideas are
    changeable.

    ref the broadcast note:
    
    No, you were actually a little _less_ bitter.  You just used a few more
    _underlines_ and capital letters, if I recall.
    
    Glad to see you're keeping a count on the "stab-meter."  Wouldn't want
    to think you're being flexible for options or anything, is all.  Here,
    let me vacate MOS and let you get your second stab in now, so we can
    **perhaps** work on Edi.  You know, that guy who now surrounds you,
    while placing us adjacent to each other for the cat-and-dog show?   The
    guy who offers the gun and the bullets, but allows us to put it up to
    our own heads...
    
    Am indeed glad your client won his trial, or whatever.  You never did
    tell me your occupation during your hours of midnight work.  I should've
    realized this crowd, though -- Jamie's a philosophy professor, you a
    legal-eagle (I assume?)...and me, the military guy, is getting
    pummeled...gads, how ironic.
    
    Now, on a more earthy plane....Take the early morning diatribe as you
    see fit.  I just felt like releasing a little sarcasm, after being
    haragued by you for being such a goon, and how this was "the last time"
    for RT dealing if I tried to nail you again, etc etc...All the moral
    righteousness and (effective) persuasion, just so you could get your
    licks in.  And had I done it, you could've done your famous -shrug- on
    the net and said, "See, you can't be trusted."   Oh yes, I'm wiping the
    All-Day Sucker off my face.  And you guys did it well.    I will be the
    first to say you guys made one heckuva good move....(perversely) fun to
    watch--up to a point, of course.
    
    But we need to figure out the future.  You can build F Ank and crush the
    hated Black Sea, and purge yourself forever of  your 1901 chagrin.  And
    I'll rebuild up north.  That's what Edi just mentioned in a note, btw,
    i.e., to imply that I will indeed "fight on" (vice becoming a G
    satellite), so you will NOT destroy the fleet to allow me the
    rebuild....and thus play a cat-and-mouse game with it (his
    words)...Hmmm, let's see, a Russian fleet working to whose advantage
    down there, if kept around????   Gee, let me consult the crystal
    ball....
    
    Or you can build F SMY and go rape Italy quickly, before anyone comes to
    his aid.  Always an option,. but I counsel against it, for what it's
    worth.
    
    England seems to think you'll be "ready to come around" now that you see
    the tactical positioning down south.  After I stopped laughing
    hysterically and asking him if he was eating some of those muscle
    relaxants they gave me for my  back,  I agreed that there was always a
    chance for anything here.
    
    I'm always willing to deal--of course, it wouldn't hurt if you timed
    your second stab for 1915 or so in that event...-grin-.     But this
    time I'd like a few conditions of my own, assuming there's any Turkish
    interest.  As The Who song goes, "We won't get fooled again."  You can
    bet I'll throw my centers to Germany rather than see AT eat them.
    (I'll forego the underlining and caps here.)  But I don't want that any
    more than some others do.   I think the game has a lot of twists and
    turns left, and wanted to see if those twists didn't somehow put us
    together...for once...   But that's for the Sultan to decide in his own
    time.
    
    Good luck with your future clients.  I'll look for you on old reruns of

    We all plan and scheme.  What's important is what we actually *do*,
    though, as far as I'm concerned.  If I tried to "punish" everyone who
    merely *proposed* action against me, I'd have an awful lot of axes to
    grind.  I'm honestly surprised you're trying to argue this position.
    
    As for "friendship and mutual cooperation," the stab meter's now at
    2-1.  I figure I've got one more freebie coming. ;)

    Don't sweat that. There's this big German fleet in the way, see that black
    wooden thing with all those guns sticking out like bristles on a

    I almost hate to tell you this. But, in my humble opinion, Hohn ought to be
    ready to switch sides.
    Ok, he didn't go for it this turn. But now it's all different. Now Edi is
    the threat, clearly; you are no threat to Hohn, and there is practically
    nothing left of you for him to take, whereas those fat Balkans are looking
    mighty juicy, I bet. This is one of those games where everyone switches

    I don't know what to tell you.
    
    Well, I'll tell you this.
    
    I'm not angry, at all. I thought I made that clear. Sure, you stabbed me. I
    attacked France in the opening. That's what happens. Frankly, I was never
    counting on you, not really. I was counting on others to keep you in check
    in case you turned on me. They failed me, rather miserably.
    
    So, actually, I *am* kind of angry, only at other powers.
    
    
    But that's not really what you meant. What you really meant was, if you
    were to turn east, why wouldn't England take advantage?
    
    There isn't a whole lot I can do to reassure you, I think. It's not as
    though I could send my units off somewhere they couldn't bother you! I have
    to do everything possible to defend my centers. I certainly did try to
    reach a rapprochement with John-Jean. If I had, I would not have blocked
    his Por-MAO. But I failed. Quite understandable, reasonable, I don't blame
    him. I think I'd do the same.
    
    
    
    Hm.
    
    
    What I really want, honestly, is still to have a chance to grab a Russian
    center. Norway would be ok, StP would be a lot better. In the best of
    worlds, I'd grab an Italian one too. But I'd be satisfied to let French
    fleets carry a message from me instead. And, since, as you know, I hold Edi
    personally responsible for all of my woes, it would be nice to see him get
    some come-uppance.
    
    Until ten pm last night, I had the order Nwg-Bar. I wish I'd kept it, but I
    decided I couldn't leave Edinburgh open.
    
    If you or John or Hohn won the game, I would be pleased (relatively
    speaking; I would be much pleaseder to win it myself, but that really goes
    without saying).
    
    
    Short of leaving my home centers open for you, I'll accept any terms of
    peace you offer.
    
    
    Cheers!

    Pitt,
    My (even later) note is somewhat more middle-of-the-raod between early
    pessimism and later optimism.  Sort of a muted optimism, perhaps...Let
    me address your note, at the ***...
    
    >
    >Not to worry.  My focus is northwestward.  I'm counting on you to contain
    >the southern hordes.
    
    ** Part of this is directly related to who's helping down south.  If I'm
    Custer, I could use you there with support before I reach the Little Big
    Horn.  Even taking SEV buys me 1-2 turns, max.  they can surround and
    retake it in fall, no doubt.  Extra pressure is needed.

    >Hmmm...I have to think about that.  I'm concerned about the potential for
    >letting England off the hook, not to mention the fact that a southern push
    >by Germany coupled with Italy's move east leaves France all alone.
    
    ** Please think hard(see above).  For one thing, a friendless England
    with three fleets can't do much to slow you down--especially if i go
    traipsing off to Nwg.  You'll get a convoy and take another center this
    turn, perhaps.  I mean, where's Jamie going to go?
    
    As for France being all alone, I'm not completely following.  Are you
    worried about threats TO him (from whom?) or threats FROM him (i.e., to
    you)?  Seems to me if he builds one, he either goes vs Italy, or builds
    another fleet to come back vs England.  if he builds an army vs you, and
    doesn't already have Eng support, he's a pretty brave guy.  And even if
    you moved to TYO in spring and France somehow hit you, you can always
    cover Tyo-Mun in fall...heck, go Pic-Bur now if there;'s a threat from
    him.
    
    >>In the north, I would urge a convoy to England; I can use Nwy to support

    >Yes, that sounds good.  Except, I'm not sure if the support is needed given
    >the possibilities for an NTH retreat.  You're probably better off getting
    >to NWG, where your fleet will be more useful in the fall.
    
    ** Pitt:  Don't take this in the wrong way, BUT...I trust you 100%.  But
    if you envision helping kill me off (or beating AT to the punch), then
    don't pussyfoot around.  I'd rather just see you move and take the stuff
    now, as opposed to taking Nwy when I'm in CLY, or taking WAR later, etc
    etc.  I'm not saying you're a vulture, or that you harbor evil intent.
    I'm just saying that you surely realize you must monitor the east
    carefully...If you can't/won't send southern help, then RI can't do much
    vs TRI or anything else in a concerted manner.  Which means sooner or
    later, I'll be going down.  Timing is everything here.
    
    Take care, and thanks for the note, as always.

    Thanks, King.  Your "sympathies" have touched a sympathetic chord here
    in the House of Pain.   Could you pass your crying towel to me?  Mine
    seems to be awfully wet right now....
    
    OK, here's the deal.  I'm glad I took Nwy.   The "May the Hohn Be With
    You, Faz Jaywalker" approach that you helped "plug" for me failed
    miserably.  (Not your fault, and thanks for any good words you offered
    there, seriously.)   So now I'm even, at least.  But no extra build
    potential vs G in 1903.  No great offensives to help Cal crush Edi.
    Even my planned attack on SEV is probably a Light Brigade charge.
    
    I'm trying to think of a way to have me sail from Nwy and let you take
    it (without the rest of your world crumbling down, naturally).   On
    thing for sure--don't expect me to come sailing into nwg and help take
    Edi.  (Mighty magnanimous of me, wot?)  Any (sugary-sweet) Ebglish
    advice and commentary is sought, as always.
    
    How the H*** did this happen to you, or me, or even Cal, who's possibly

    Yes, that sounds good.  Except, I'm not sure if the support is needed given

    mind seeing Russia eliminated before me.
    
    Well, good luck. I will just have to try to get France on my side. Last

    Good move, freeing Mar for the build.
    
    Unfortunately, my two units were both destroyed, so I have no options this
    winter. Otherwise I would certainly disband the F Iri.
    
    I won't order Iri-MAO again, in any case. Do what you will with that fleet.

    Guys:
    As my title says, I must be on drugs (actually, I am--those muscle
    relaxants for my back...ahhhh...).  Anyway, color me stupid.  Here I am,
    ranting and raving about 'building one" and valiantly thrashing the
    upstarts in the Balkans, yet I now realize I'm 'even' with 0 builds.
    Thank you, Judge printout, for bringing me back to reality.
    
    Therefore, the earlier allusions stand.  I will press on vs AT.  My rear
    is open.  If you're all 'with' me in this Crusade, then let me work my
    rapidly-shrinking wiles.  But if you sense that I'm going to lose Ukr
    and/or GAL soon (Pitt), then you better make a run on War, ASAP.   I
    won't mind the grab.  Heck, I'm lucky to find time to even play this
    game.
    
    I apologize for the hasty (and incorrect) earlier letters; am trying to
    finish a stack of papers on the ol' desk, and wanted to send off all my
    key messages this a.m.  I rushed myself into error.
    
    Blame it on the drugs.

    Hi Pitt
    Last note I heavily intimated that I was willing to cave in and see you
    move to SIL, PRU, wherever, and take WAR, while perhaps devoting 100%
    attention to the Balkans.   perhaps I was a bit...ah...premature in
    ascertaining my own death.
    
    I forgot about Swe; I can rebuild a unit from down south.
    
    I see something like this:
    
    Germany:  Build A Mun, Mun-Tyo(!)
    Russia:  Build A War, War-Ukr,  Ukr-Sev (Mos S), Bla-Arm, Gal-Rum (R to
    BOH when dislodged)
    
    This puts us on a linear front against Edi, and, teamed with Cal
    (hopefully in VEN and ALB?), we can put the hurt on Edi.    (You'll
    still have enough armies to prosecute either an anti-E or anti-F
    campaign).
    
    A unit in Tyo can also help Fra (if he moves to Pie, altho' hitting
    Italy now only benefits AT); can help you vs France (if you moive to Pie
    later in conjunction with other anti-F moves); or, as desired, helps
    level Vie in the near term.
    
    For me, this is nothing but a punishment move.  I can annihilate SEV
    while being annihilated in BLA (I envision a build of  F Ank), and who
    knows if I can even hold SEV next turn.  But to try and merely defend
    GAL is crazy (it's 4-on-3 potentially, anyway), and this move at least
    keeps the pot boiling down south.  Your move to Tyrolia would REALLY be
    a shocker, and helpful to our cause.
    
    In the north, I would urge a convoy to England; I can use Nwy to support
    Nth Sea.  OR, you can support me to Nwg, and then, if hit, retreat to
    LON, or YOR.....I don't see much Russian gain coming from all this, but
    hopefully you'll see fit to throw me a scrap or two in the near-term, to
    feed down south...
    
    What do you make of this all?

    Fellow ex-QC'ers
    
    Is it me, or have we all been snookered within three turns?   I have to
    say it again -- I'm clearly outclassed by the "Pros from Dover" this
    game.
    
    Cal, you made the right moves last turn.  Edi is at 6 but can't build
    (yuk yuk).  I look for AT fleet action (perhaps) if Hohn builds F Smy.
    (If they're really together, you'll see that, I'll wager).  Although
    Hohn does seem to carry a desire for revenge, and he HAS mentioned how
    much he hates that F BLA...so maybe he'll first build in ANK, annihilate
    BLA, make the Balkans his own little lake, and THEN build (1903) another
    westward-bound fleet.
    
    I would urge either a hit on TRI or a supported convoy to ALB (Apu-Alb,
    Adr S, ven-Tri).  I mean, Edi will now spew forth reams as to why it's
    suicidal for you to hit him, how it'll be to both your detriments, etc.
     You know the outcome of THAT kind of talk....
    
    I can possibly help you next season, using Gal-somewhere (Vie?  Bud?) to
    cut a support, although truthfully, he can defend TRI with both, even if
    I cut one (or if he only uses one and I guess wrong).
    
    Jamie:  Have fun in Norway.  You spent a god day yesterday trying to
    sway me, saying you thought Hohn was with me.  see too the fruits of
    YOUR clairvoyance regarding the Balkans.  I do feel sadness at seeing
    such a fine 1901 attack come down to both of us going "-2" from the
    original year.  I can only say in hindsight that I'm glad I took Nwy for
    1902, to stay even for armies down south.
    
    ** Note my e-mail to AT, at the end of this all; pretty tight-jawed, eh?
      :>)
    
    MY ITNENT is to abandon Nwy and ask Germany to invade SIL and grab WAR.
    I will then use
    Gal-Rum, Bla-Arm (before it's annihilated), Ukr-Sev (Mos S), and kill
    Hohn in Turkey.  then I can play "The Alamo" while red-and-yellow beasts
    engulf me.
    
    By F'03 I'll be down to 2, maybe 1, and can willingly puppet as a rogue
    for any of you.
    
    hey, WAIT A MINUTE (genuine surprise here).  I forgot I owned SWEDEN; I
    can BUILD ONE!  Oh, joy of joys...
    
    What do you guys think of this:
    - Same as above
    - Build War, War-Ukr (to cover in case Turkey tries Rum-Ukr).
    
    If GAL is hit, I go to BOH, and we *all* try to get a german army build
    in Mun to Tyo...hmmm?
    
    Just preliminary thoughts, mind you?  This +1 thing is a bit
    disconcerting...to mutate Mark Twain, "Notices of my death have been a
    bit premature."   Whatever.
    
    I welcome thoughts and comments.

    Gentlemen:
    
    1) I congratulate Edi for (as usual) masterful wheeling-and-dealing.
    Having sent your RIE minions off to fight your crafted battles, you now
    sit back and watch us all lose and/or flounder, while you and friend
    Turkey gain at my expense, and you are free to work your wiles.  My
    appreciation and admiration of an Austrian job "well done;"  I should be
    as good as you.
    
    2) Well done on your part, too!  I understand Turkish desires for gain,
    as well as any possible blood lust to "get even" for earlier indignities
    I put upon you.  Congrats on suckering me in SEV like I suckered you in
    BLA.  I hope you and Edi enjoy your moves.  And _thanks_ for the
    opportunity to let me to show you my change of heart, and for showing me
    yours.  It warms my cockles!
    
    Being that this IS a demo game, I shall be "demonstrating" how to throw
    as many centers as possible to Pitt and Jamie as is possible, before I
    vaporize in this game with a small "poof!"   If I have my way, SEV is

    Gentlemen:  Well, my Turkish diplomacy (consisting of "masterly" ways of
    angering Hohn by being Edi's puppet in 1901 vs Turkey) and my English
    diplomacy (consisting of angering Jamie by taking Nwy) have yielded
    their usual spectacular results.
    
    To put it mildly, I'm in a "hurt box" ceated of my own making.   I will
    be (obviously) facing sotuh to repair what little frontage I have left.
     I'm a little bit miffed at this turn of events, but also realize I
    suckered myself into believing Turkey, when he can be just as petty and
    revenge-minded as the rest of us.   So here's the deal:
    
    - I would ask continued peace among us, so I may not be YOUR "buffer"
    against the Balkan BadGuys.
    - If that's not in the cards--if G wants to get me before AT do, or if E
    wants Nwy no matter what, then do me a favor, and make mine a quick
    death.  As the German populace said in the closing years of WW2, "Better
    and end in horror, than a horror without end."   I'd much rather die
    with my "friends" picking me apart, than my foes.

    (St Pete's)
    The Winter Palace reports another setback on the Balkan Front.  The
    Turkish sultan, who earlier spent countless reams of paper reaming the
    Tsar for his perfidious earlier stabs (done at the evil genius bequest
    of CoalBin Birsan), decided that he too was capable of "getting even."
    Rather than punish the Archduke for his malevolent war planning against
    peaceful Turks, the Sultan succumbed to the Master's siren song, hoping
    for quick gain at the expense of friendship and mutual cooperation.
    
    The road to the west was open; we coulda been contendahs together.
    Turkey and Austria, making common cause, now pose a threat to Italy,
    watching (no doubt disconcertedly) from the Alps, as well as a growing
    threat to Germany and points west.   We shall do what we can do, but we
    ain't holdin' our breath.
    
    Two final points of note:
    
    1) As the old 60s song says, "Mama said there'd be days like this,
    there'd be days like this, my momma said..."
    
    2) We are pleased to see the Turk, who has been so recently overburdened
    at work so as to be "communications-challenged," can now write a novella
    about the thrashing of the Russians.  I'm sure the hardbound version
    will be a big hit in Moscow.

    General Akbar lowered his field goggles.  The situation was
    dire.  He thought ::Sultan Cho must have lost his mind, to
    have reduced us to this parlous state.  Trusting the
    Russians!  How could he forget the history of treachery and
    unrest on the part of Czars past?::
    
    But he set his gloomy thoughts aside.  The grizzled military
    commander knew that such ponderings were pointless, indeed,
    counter-productive, and so he decided to concentrate on the
    matter at hand.
    
    "Mohammed."
    
    "Yes sir?"
    
    "Tell the men to dig in.  We entrench and defend.  But be
    ready to move, we have our orders, and we will carry them
    out to the best of our ability."
    
    "Aye sir.  It shall be done."
    
    General Akbar nodded to his second, and he once again
    examined the field.  The Black Sea fleet floated menacingly
    off the coast, while Russian armies were to the northwest,
    north, and northeast.
    
    It was at that moment that the good general knew he could
    not hold.  Try as he might, the enemy was too numerous.  At
    the end of the day, his loyal troops would be spilling their
    lifeblood onto the earth of the Balkans, as countless men
    had done before them.
    
    They could not hold.  All would die, at the hands of the
    faithless Russians.  They would be resolute and merciless,
    and General Akbar knew that the good citizens of Rumania
    would share the fate of the brave, but hopelessly
    outnumbered Turkish Janissaries.  A solitary tear tracked
    down his cheek.  He knew they could not stop the Russians.
    
    But that was not what mattered.  He _knew_ what truly
    mattered.  "We are _trying_ to stop you," he whispered.  And
    _that_ was what truly mattered.  Not who ultimately won or
    lost.  For millenia from now, who would remember the
    temporal passages of empires?  Succeed or fail, they would
    do their best.  They would try, and they would die, yet they
    would not surrender.
    
    For were they not men?
    
    				* * *
    
    General Akbar braced himself.  "Steady...steady...I said
    steady, you stinking whoresons!"  The pair of Turkish
    Janissaries who had leaned forward only moments ago
    sheepishly relaxed and resighted their weapons.  The
    Russians were coming into view.
    
    Yet shockingly, only a fraction of the Russian ground forces
    advanced on General Akbar's position, even as the Black Sea
    fleet continued to rest peacefully on the horizon.  He had
    no idea why this had occurred, but he vowed to punish them
    for their insolence, for daring to underestimate the resolve
    and morale of the elite First Turkish Janissaries.  "You
    will not find us to be easy meat," he whispered.
    
    Suddenly, things began to occur faster than General Akbar
    could follow.  The Austrian army, encamped behind them in
    Bulgaria, unexpectedly appeared on the southern plain.
    "Shit," he cursed.  If the Austrians had thrown in with the
    foul Russians, then it was no surprise that they had only
    allocated a fraction of their troops.  Flanked as they were,
    only a fraction would be necessary, with Austrian
    assistance.  His leader had failed him again, for he had
    assured Akbar that the Austrians were friendly, or at least
    neutral.  ::Whenever kings and tyrants play their games, it
    is always the soldier who suffers.::  "Third and fourth
    cohorts, prepare to repulse the southern advance!"
    
    But the order never reached fruition.  The Third Austrian
    Guards diverted course at the last moment, and speared into
    the advancing Russian columns from the Ukraine.  General
    Akbar recovered from his momentary shock, and then bellowed,
    "Charge!  Charge!  Allahu Akhbar!  Charge!"
    
    His well-disciplined men sortied from their defensive
    positions, and met the invaders from Sevastopol tooth to
    nail.  Many a Turkish Janissary remained on that bloody
    battlefield after the day was over, even as Russian Cossacks
    joined them.  The fighting continued, however, and General
    Akbar began to wonder if it would ever end.  ::Come on,
    Sultan.  Don't let it end like this.::
    
    And just like clockwork, confusion struck the ranks of the
    Cossacks.  The canny General Akbar exploited every bit of
    that confusion, and although he managed some small success,
    chaos still reigned in the court of Rumania.
    
    As Akbar pressed forward, a runner sprinted to his side.
    "Yes, what is it, boy?"
    
    "General...latest...reports from...HQ say that...
    reinforcements are on their way!  On their way!"
    
    An impossible surge of hope erupted in General Akbar's
    heart.  A heart which only moments ago had been black and
    decayed from lack of joy and love.  He thought ::Come on,
    this could be the break we need!::
    
    And as he saw the smoke on the northeastern horizon, he knew
    that he and his men would live to fight another day.  ::As
    it should be:: he thought.  ::As it should be.::
    
    And so it was that Turkey was well-pleased with its general.

    This is what got me:
    
    >** This is where the trust obviously breaks down (along with everywhere
    >else).  You don't know me from squat.
    
    True.
    You don't know me, either. I have found this frustrating.
    
    
    Also, looking through my records, I found that what you promised regarding
    my convincing Turkey, was somewhat ambiguous. I took it to mean you would
    let me have Norway this turn. But that wasn't explicit. So I have to admit
    that I have been reasoning with an incorrect assumption.
    
    
    I still have a problem, though. I would like to believe (probably in that
    sense in which experts at self-deception would always like to believe one
    thing or another) that in other, future, possible circumstances, your
    promises and alliances would actually mean something to you. I admit that
    one cannot draw any drastic conclusion from one turn. But I don't
    understand what those future, possible circumstances would have to be like.
    And I'm not getting englightenment from what I'm reading. Follow along,
    please.

    This is what you still have to explain to me.
    
    We *were* allies. You have no reason to believe that honoring the alliance
    will threaten you. But you won't honor it. This is what I don't understand.
    Can you explain to me more clearly under what circumstances you *would*
    honor it?
    
    >>Maybe I'm confused. Explain it to me. What reason would you ever have to
    >>give me Norway? I can think of only one: that if you don't, I'll make you
    >>pay.
    >
    >** There you go again, with that "negative incentive is the only thing
    >you understand" thing.  Sigh..
    
    Be fair. I did give you a huge benefit of the doubt. It's only after you
    stabbed me and you explained why that I concluded that this was the only
    sort of incentive that meant anything to you. It was only after you quite
    explicitly came out and said that the past has no weight for you, that I
    concluded the only reasons you'd recognize are dangling threats and
    benefits (and participles).
    
    >I do tend to operate on more than threats and cajoling...just because
    >it's not working with you, AT THIS MOMENT,  somehow is seemingly
    >branding me a dull sluggard that won't listen to reason.
    
    That's also not fair. I certainly never even for a moment implied that you
    are a dull sluggard.
    As for threats and carrots, it's just that you haven't ever given me any
    reason to believe that you are interested in anything else. I did assume
    that you valued other things, right from the start. I paid for it. You did
    severe damage to that assumption. You can't suppose that I would blithely
    continue to assume it in the face of all evidence against it.
    
    
    >>How would there ever, under any circumstance, be any gain to you to give me

    :(
    
    This is not at all encouraging.
    I need help, desperately, against a common enemy.
    We were allies.
    The decision is tactically sound, but only if my interests count for
    anything in the alliance. And if they don't, I can't see how it would ever
    be tactically sound, from your point of view, to let me have a center
    rather than you.
    
    
    >>We can talk it over until I turn blue. You will never have any reason to do

    That's what I'm afraid of.

    (Does that mean you are fixated, too? Doesn't it take two to banty? I am
    willing to concede that I am exactly as fixated as you are. Shall we say,
    "intense", rather than "fixated"? Put a nicer spin on it.)

    Yeah, maybe that's right.
    
    Sigh.
    
    Only, can you explain under what circumstances you really would honor
    agreements? Everything you've said so far, all the circumstances you've
    hypothesized, it sure looks to me like those conditions actually do obtain,
    and yet....

    Ok.
    
    I have been stabbed, to my surprise. I didn't expect it. I would not have
    been so vulnerable if I had expected such a thing. I would have taken
    Norway in 1901, etc.
    When I am stabbed unexpectedly, there has to be some reason. Usually, and
    this time, the reason I didn't expect the stab is that I worked it through
    and decided that it would not be to my potential stabber's advantage to
    stab me. (That's you.) But, since I was in fact stabbed, my stabber
    disagrees with me. He thinks that screwing me out of the supply center is
    worth whatever costs he will pay.
    
    It then becomes important to me to prove that my judgment was correct, and
    my stabber's was incorrect. If I still had a decent position, a good game
    plan, I would have other important things to worry about. But given that I
    will not, the importance of demonstrating that I was correct looms large.
    
    There is one way to demonstrate that my assessment was correct, and that is
    to make it correct. That is, I have to *act* in such a way as to make it
    the case that the stab was not a good move, that its costs to the stabber
    outweigh its benefits. In other circumstances, there might be other ways.
    They might often look nothing at all like revenge. But in this circumstance
    that is the only way. I know that it looks like revenge, or 'spleen', or
    whatever you want to call it, but that's not what it is.
    
    So that is what I will do.
    
    You have called this policy of mine by many, many unpleasant names, but
    that is in fact my policy, and the motivations underlying it I have now
    stated plainly, twice, and most sincerely.
    
    Believe it, or not.

    Sigh.
    
    I've explained this already.
    
    If I could impose costs on you and Italy and Austria, I would. Since I
    can't, I'll just impose those costs I can impose. Since of the three of
    you, only you have actually deprived me of any center directly, I'm not
    disappointed that you will be the one of the three against whom I can
    assess costs.
    
    Come on, I really did explain that before.

    :(
    
    This is really disappointing.
    
    I think you will freely admit, at least I hope so, that you haven't given
    me *ANY* reason to expect you to do what you say. None at all! And every
    reason to expect you to just stab me again, if I were gullible enough to
    rely on your promise.
    
    And yet, you really do expect me to believe it. Why??? I keep being led to
    the conclusion that you think I'm some sort of fool. An 'angry', 'locked
    in' fool, apparently.
    
    >>What could I possibly think? What possible grounds do I have to believe
    >>that you would ever do what you say you will do?
    >
    >** Let me try and be monosyllabic here:
    >if-it-helps-me-and-can-also-help-you,-then-I-can-and-may-do-it.
    
    I am trying that. I am trying it now. It will help me, of course. And it
    will help you, because you may then rely on your northern borders being
    secure. Whereas otherwise you cannot, and in fact you must count on your
    northern borders coming under attack.
    
    But that is not what you are asking me to believe. You are asking me to
    believe that somehow you will actually turn over Norway to me, if Hohn
    proves to be an ally next year. Whereas every indication is that you will
    say something like, "Of course he's helpful now, but I am deathly afraid
    that he will suddenly turn on me... we can never know anything about the
    future, Jamie, are you really asking me to just give up my security out of
    pure largesse and the goodness of my heart?" And when that happened, THIS
    TIME I would certainly have to admit that I in fact had no reason
    whatsoever to expect you to carry out your promise, none at all. For I had
    been warned.
    
    Maybe I'm confused. Explain it to me. What reason would you ever have to
    give me Norway? I can think of only one: that if you don't, I'll make you
    pay. Since that is the only reason I can think of that you'd ever do it,
    that's the one I'm offering you now.
    
    > Why
    >shouldn't I help you, if there's MUTUAL gain?
    
    How would there ever, under any circumstance, be any gain to you to give me
    a center?
    
    Insofar as there is ever any gain, it's present now. By giving it to me,
    you secure my friendship. By denying it, you secure my enmity. Is there
    ever any other reason for you? I just can't see it. There will never be one.

    We can talk it over until I turn blue. You will never have any reason to do
    it, except the ones I've already offered. Honor. Alliance. The threat of
    attack by me, vs. the promise of help. Or what am I missing?

    I don't get it.
    I'm not fixated on anything. I'm just playing the only cards I have left.
    
    The short-term will never, ever lead you to honor your agreements. What
    short-term incentive would there ever be? You always have more centers with
    Norway than you have without Norway.
    
    
    
    >>Those have no effect

    >>Russia must do what Russia must do."
    >** Yes, so?  You then say...
    >>And so must England.
    >** Viola!  As I've also always said.
    
    So much is understood, then. Your agreements will never, ever count for
    anything at all. For when the time comes to honor them, they are always in
    the past. And you never let the past impinge on your decisions. And yet,
    somehow, I am supposed to believe that you would honor a future agreement.
    Why? Am I supposed to believe it on no grounds at all? Am I to take it as
    my credo, an article of faith?

    I can promise you that a 3-4 center England will be much better to have as
    a friend than as an enemy. That's all I can do. It seems like a very
    significant consideration. If to you it's negligible, then we will just
    have to see who is correct.

    though you don't believe me, though you have averred that you do believe me.

    Cal,
    I'm at a loss to explain his rabid fixation with one center, as if that
    spells "game end" for him.  I suppose I shouldn't have gotten as testy
    as I did, but it kind of frosted me.
    
    I'm staying in NWY.  Short of EG rapproachment, he'll wither long before
    he busts my lines.  I'll try not to have it detract from the anti-A
    (anti-T) war(s).
    
    Please indeed press home your attacks vs Edi, however you want them
    done.  I'm going to try for BUD this turn, in case you're looking for
    someone to support to TRI.

    I should also point out there are weird side effects of the
    
    set address andyhre@well.com,schwarz@haas.berkeley.edu
    
    which I use at times for vital games to ensure I get press.
    
    If you have this address, the account from which you send will get 2
    confirmations rather than 1.  The other accoutn will also get 1, meaning
    you get 3 in total.
    
    It also messes up summaries sometimes, so if you sense the game is winding
    down, you might want to reduce to 1 address for the endgame or so, simply
    to make Nick Fitzpatrick's life a hof keeper easier

    Andy S or anyone else:
    
    Eeeek!  What's happening to this address update?
    
    Truthfully, all I want to do is tell the Judge that I am at two
    addresses, so if someone sends me stuff to my Juno line after work, it
    will go there for me to read.
    
     I don't necessarily want duplicate messages at each place...just want
    the ability of the Judge to read both addresses as "legit" when people
    use one (or both).
    
    Can this be done?
    
    Thanks for the earlier advice; I guess I don't follow paperwork
    instructions too well....blush.

    Just got this after I sent my last missive.
    
    If I had an exchange of letters like this in a regular game, I'd pull
    everything north and attack for all I'm worth and the hell with the
    south.
    This IS, however, a demo game and I shouldn't think such thoughts...
    
    My non-advice from the last letter probably goes double now.

    Well, my standard response to situations like this seem to be pretty
    much
    as yours: if he wants to act like a baby then I'm even more likely to
    tell
    him to go to hell.  I do agree with you that I doubt if GK Jamie will do
    something like that.  I suspect it's a ploy to get you to turn around
    and
    give him Norway back.  It may be his only available tactic if you think
    about it.  Personally, I've used this sort of thing myself, but I hate
    having to follow through.  I HAVE followed through, but only to prove
    that
    there WAS some bite to my whining in the future.  I wouldn't do it in a
    demo
    game unless ABSOLUTELY desperate.
    
    I'm not going to advise you on what to do (the Elves say giving advice
    is
    a fool's game...JRR Tolkien), but I will tell you that *I* would stay in
    Norway.

    GKJ,
    An addendum to my last...
    
    Regardless of how this turns out, regardless of how you play this, I am
    going to keep open my comm lines.  I am going to offer deals, and even
    talk about leaving Nwy in 1903 if the south worked out.   You may feel
    free to close your eyes to reading the words; you can close your brain
    to accepting anything from Russia at face value anymore if you desire.
    But that will not change my attitude about keeping an open game, and
    trying to work with everyone.

    How to deal with a change of address from the last draft of the new FAQ I saw:
    
    Q.    How do you change your return address with the judges?
    
    [Bjoern's Answer with slight edits by Andy]
    
    A.   First, notify the judge of your new address by sending, from
     your new E-mail account, an IAmAlso command, i.e.
    
        iamalso my.old.id@my.old.address
    
     This notifies the judge that your new address and your old
     address belong to the same person. If this is not done, you
     lose all your dedication points when entering new games with
     your new account.
    
     After issuing the IAMALSO command, simply fill out a new
     registration form, based on your old one, and send it in.
    
    
    [tip: do WHOIS  my.old.id@my.old.address and use what the judge sends back
    as a template to create a new Regitration, erase user ID line, slap
    REGISTER on TOP, END at the bottom, add/change your address, and zip it
    back]
    
     That
     goes as an update to the registration form you sent in
     for your old account.
    
     The third, and final, step, is to notify the entries in all
     your current games that your address has changed. SIGNON to
     each game, and SET ADDRESS, i.e.
    
     SIGNON Pgamename password
     SET ADDRESS my.new.address@super.duper.server.com
    
    or if you want both addresses to be used for a given game, try
    
     SET ADDRESS  my.old.id@my.old.address, my.new.address@super.duper.server.com
    
    
    ------
    So IAMALSO does not pass the info on to anyone and it doesn;t even
    explicitly update for registration.  It does, however, allow the new
    account to serve a proxy for the old account at will.  Updating you
    registration does the same thing, except it may make it easier for the
    SUMMARY command to work and for people who want to reach you to find you
    new email account.
    
    Only when you
    
    SET ADDRESS my.new.address@super.duper.server.com
    
    will everyone in a given game see the new address.  Remember, this is one
    Set address for EACH game you are in.  it is not a judge-wide change.

    >1) From the cost-benefit side:  I reasoned, is English friendship AT
    >THIS TIME worth one center?  In other words, do I need this center given
    >the board set-up, or should I possibly sacrifice Russian defense to stay
    >chummy with England...an England who should know a survival instinct
    >when he sees one?
    
    I know a survival instinct, yes I do. You are screwing me for your fifth
    center or your sixth. You are reducing me to three centers. I've got a keen
    survival instinct.
    
    But to me this means, I have to put something on the table that counts for
    something. And I really don't have much. So what I put on the table is
    this: give me what is due to me, what was promised, and I am your friend to
    the end; otherwise, I'm your enemy to the end. I have to put up high
    stakes, because my survival is on the line.
    
    You don't believe I am serious about that, that's the problem. My problem,
    and it will be yours, too. But, you'll see.
    
    
    >2) I then said, is one center worth hacking off Pitt, who clearly holds
    >the leverage over me AT THIS TIME?
    
    I think this is pure pretense. The idea that Pitt would drop this all-out
    attack against me and spend seasons re-arranging his units to attack you is
    totally ridiculous.
    
    >  Again, is the honor of keeping
    >England even (and facing Germany) worth the reality of me keeping Pitt
    >quiet (hopefully) and staying solvent, to boot?
    
    If it were only honor? Maybe not. That's why I have upped the stakes.
    
    For some players, honor is enough. I had hoped you were one of those. Since
    you aren't, I have to put more chips on the table. So I have.
    
    
    >3) Lastly, I reasoned, is England a grudge player who will carry this
    >slight over Nwy to his grave in some sort of snit, or will he calculate
    >and deal as expected?
    
    Again, you are quite deliberately misdescribing my motivations. I'll let
    that slide. I suppose you are just trying to get me mad.
    
    I'll calculate my deal all right. But what will I be aiming to maximize?
    You assume I will always aim to maximize my survival duration. Not true. I
    will maximize my effect on the game in my dying years. I know how to do
    that now.
    
    
    >>Stabbing me, and continuing to twist the dagger, you think, is cost-free.
    >** How so, "continuing to twist the dagger?"  You mean, sailing Nwy to
    >Nwg and then continuing to hit you with German help?  Hadn't been my
    >intent....
    
    No.
    Stabbing me last move. Then, promising me that if I help convince Hohn to
    join you instead of Edi, you will give me Norway. Then, after I have done
    that, saying, "Hah, sucker, you mean you actually BELIEVED that?"
    
    That's twisting. And if that's the way it is, then you are someone with
    whom there is no point in dealing at all. There is zero expectation that
    you will carry through.
    
    
    >** No,  untrue.  I'm HOPING you don't get into this "jihad" vs the
    >available guy" mode, but if you do, then I expect a timed assault (while
    >you shift to BAR, Nwg, etc, and make my life a nuisance.  And I'll
    >build F STP(nc) in such an event).
    
    You will build F Stp if I move to Bar now. Interesting.
    
    In that case, you will have gained absolutely nothing by stabbing me! You
    won't have that unit to play in the south. So, you are stabbing me for no
    gain at all.
    
    And what if I don't move to Bar now? Will you then figure that I won't move
    there next Spring? Or will you build in StP anyway?
    
    I'll tell you what. I warn you: you had better build in StP this winter, no
    matter where my fleets are.
    
    
    
    
    >My thrust is this, GKJ:  I don't want one center to be the bone of
    >contention betwene us.
    
    Then give me the bone. That's the only way out.
    
    What you really mean is, you want the center and you don't want me to try
    to do anything about it. You want your stab to be cost-free. It will not
    be. You can mark that down in your book of certainties. Other things are
    merely probable, unlikely, possible... this is certain: stab me as you are
    stabbing me and I will do something about it.
    
    >I know for you this is symptomatic of a larger
    >trust (and security) issue, rather than just Nwy.
    
    True.
    
    >I just feel this way:
    >Edi hosed me, and I hosed Hohn, yet we're all communicating and ready to
    >bargain with whomever, whenever, to make our countries secure.  I fully

    >Nothing would surprise me this game.  But I would also HOPE that you
    >realize there is "ER life beyond 1902" and I sincerely hope our comm
    >lines haven't been irretrievanly shattered just because of this.
    
    
    Not at all. I will continue to communicate with you. I'll set up a
    telegraph office in St Petersburg.
    
    But it still does seem to me that you simply don't believe I'll carry out
    my threats. Because if you did, your own cool cost-benefit analysis would
    tell you that continuing to stab me isn't worth it, it will be costlier to
    you than pulling out your dagger. So, you don't believe me. I take that as
    a challenge.

    Hi guys, we're getting there slowly!  Yes, I hope Jamie will remember
    that this is my first go-round as master for a Judge game.  I don't
    believe that it will be any kind of conflict of interest for me to
    ask players for master syntax advice...  would the two of you that are
    Judge master experienced let me know if anything looks unusual or
    strange in the game parameters that I need to fix?  I was not sure
    how to add Monday as a potential deadline day (I don't have a problem
    with meeting Jamie's request to do so, but I didn't know how).  I set
    the game up mucho fast since I had to run to a meeting.  Sorry the
    message was so short (and deficient in not mentioning the Judge, observer
    signons etc.).
    
    Jim
    
    PS I got a strange message from the Judge granting that I was signed
    on as master, but also saying that I'm lacking a preference list.
    Is that a regular occurrence since I could start the game, and then
    switch it to unmoderated and play in it?

    Jim, why don't you suggest that people signon as observers, too, at first.
    So we can use this channel to address each other en masse before the powers

    Whoops, as I look at it again, you're precisely correct.  I probably
    shouldn't have forwarded it.  In any case, there was some discussion
    of this at the time.  I don't save everything and don't have any of
    the correspondence with you except where we were talking about people to
    invite into the game.

    I will leave it here, but the way I see it, Jamie and Mark are at
    a disadvantage communicating by the Judge/E-Mail, as some evidence
    has shown here at the beginning.
    
    The unusualness of the game is its particular charm.  The question
    is, what will happen as a result.  That, none of us knows.

    Dear M. Cyberdog,
    
    We are always ready to engage in any defensive manouever whatever. Our
    fleets are so practiced in defensive manouevers that they are constantly
    sailing around each other in circles.
    
    I think I will give Minister Churchill charge of the initial melee. Assuming
    our paranoia is well-founded (as paranoia always is, after all), the point
    of the dagger can be turned immediately toward the Huns.
    
    Do you think this is wise? Or would it be better to begin Mediterranean
    operations sooner?
    
    Cheers!

    Good King Jamie:  France seeks only peaceful relations with England.  You
    are quite correct that the Central Powers cannot be trusted.  Their
    ambitions are a matter of historical record.  Shall we coordinate a

    I don't have my original solicitation letter.  I have this exchange
    with Conrad Minshall where I get into the subject of the possibility
    of phone calls in depth.  I'll try to find one of the letters that went
    to you.
    
    I consider this issue at this point as within the game (meaning it
    is up to you to deal with it as you wish), although I will consider
    some sort of specific appeal.  It is possible that Jamie entered
    this discussion at a point where it was not discussed in his hearing.
    
    Please feel free to keep inquiring.  I still haven't gone through all
    of the mail and I apologize if you've asked me a question that I haven't

    Faz,
    
    Try using lower case letters for power specifications, thus, instead of
    
    >>signon Rghodstoo xxxxxxxx
    >>press to E
    
    do
    	signon rghodstoo xxxxxxxx
    	press to e
    
    I'm not sure it makes a difference, but it's the only irregularity I see.
    
    
    
    >By the way, did you ever get any of these copies, either through the

    No, through neither channel, it's the first I've seen of it.
    
    To content:
    first, no, I haven't sent out any other gloom-and-doom messages. I
    genuinely worry primarily about an FG alliance, as England, mostly because
    it's just such a strong alliance, so tempting. I will rely on sweettalk to
    try to break it up, but also on your good will. The FG will tempt them less
    if they expect to have to face a healthy Russia who would fight against
    such a consolidation of the Northwest, and make any clean-up of England
    slow and painful.
    
    As to 'directional foci' (sheesh!).
    I am ambivalent. As long as I feel I have things moderately well in hand in
    my neighborhood, I'd prefer to see you go south, and make your
    re-appearance in the north at an opportune moment. That is, if I'm on the
    Two side of a Two-on-one amongs us northwesterners, I'd be happiest to see
    your A Mos-Ukr, or the like.
    
    If, on the other hand, I feel about to be the victim in the north, I would
    prefer to see your strong presence up here.
    
    So perhaps we could leave things open for now. As I am plotting things,
    your interests ought to coincide roughly with mine, so that it would be
    mostly a matter of seeing how things are falling and which of the major
    options is in *OUR* interest.
    
    As to Norway, I will not expect you to contest it, and I though obviously I
    am going to take it, I am willing to do it in the Unthreatening Way (viz.,
    with a fleet), especially if we can build that into part of a larger,
    mutually agreeable plan. (Ideally I'd like my army in Belgium, but the real
    world so rarely approximates my ideals, the wretched thing!)
    
    Does it bother you, by the way, that Herr Edi signed on as Turkey? I'm
    dying to discover what was up with that!
    
    If you're happy with my remarks above, say so, and then let's feel out the
    others for a while.
    
    Cheers!

    How did you manage to signon as Turkey? Did you just guess his password by

    Good morning, fellow witch.
    
    If you don't mind, I'd like to exchange impressions of neighbors at some point.
    
    I have received no press at all yet, though -- I know Tsar Faz is trying to
    send me some, but he has not yet mastered, uh, telegraphy.

    			SECURITY COMPROMISED!!!!
    
    How is it that both edi@mgames.com and hohncho@kaiwan.com have just sent
    broadcasts as Turkey???? Geez, the game is hard enough with just one player
    handling Turkey's units.
    
    (Fortunately Hohn is an old Judge hand and knows how to take care of
    trivial little things like this.)
    
    Cheers!
    Gentle King Jamie
    
    p.s. I also resigned as *observer*. As Hohn says, everyone should do this
    or you'll get two copies of each broadcast and Judge bookkeeping
    announcement.
    Do it like this:
    	signon oghodstoo password
    	resign
    The Judge keeps track of observers by their address, so as long as you send
    the resign message from the address you used to signon as an observer
    originally, you will successfully remove yourself as an observer.

    No, I'm still here...I only resigned as an Observer, since I was tired
    of getting double mail.  We can all do that, since once our powers
    were assigned, we can all issue press.
    
    BTW, Ye Olde Sultan extends his hand to all European leaders in
    friendship.  I'm looking forward to a great game, and I'm sure I'll be
    corresponding with you privately very soon.  I am swamped today,
    though, so I may not be able to send/respond messages until the
    weekend or Monday.
    
    Take care, all.  Happy weekend!

    Well well well.
    
    I wouldn't mind splitting the board, east and west, with someone suitably
    placed who likes board-splitting. Hypothetically speaking, I mean.
    
    I can't remember what my preference list was, but I know I didn't have
    England first. With good players, I am always afraid that the FG alliance
    looks too tempting. So I'll be sweating that for a while and not attending
    to much else, I think. But my first order of business as England *must* be
    to come to good terms with Russia, I firmly believe that, and if Russia
    happens to be played by someone I've already had a preliminary chat with,
    so much the better!

    As I suspected, Edi is having a little trouble with the registration.
    I've tried to help him and I'm trying to get him to send me what the
    judge is sending him back... we'll see.
    
    If Dave has access to the mail stream of the Judge and can easily
    find Edi's failure, perhaps he could see precisely what Edi is doing
    wrong.  I will remind Dave Kleiman at this point, that his "Judge-keeper"
    job on this game could become more involved than usual.
    
    Edi, as an expert Dip player, is being a bit shy about asking me as
    many questions as he should be.  Our other total Judge rookie (Mark
    Fassio) has been at the other extreme and he's asked me lots of great
    questions.

    Hello, Edi should be joining us shortly.  On Sundays (I think I have this
    right) he does consulting for the mgames postal role playing company
    where people call him for advice on how to form and run factions, gain
    influence and the like in that particular set of PBM games.  Anyway,
    he has to keep his phone line free until that is done.  I have not heard from
    John Barkdull, but he may be a 9-5 weekday user, so with the holiday
    he might not sign on until Tuesday.  We'll see.
    
    Based on Jamie's advice and some thinking of my own, I have "mucked"
    around with the deadline parameters.  I now have the movement at
    seven full days (minus Jamie's suggested half hour), winter builds and
    adjustments at two days and retreats at one day (otherwise when you
    have both retreats and builds things can get pretty slow).  If anyone
    wants me to move a deadline parameter in any direction, please let
    me know.  For you new guys, you may want to "get deadline" for a
    description of how to read these deadlines and you can do "list"
    after a signon to see the whole set of parameters.  I also added
    "Monday after noon" as a possible deadline as Jamie suggested.
    
    We'll start soon...

<p><a name=298></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=000000>Observer</font>:</b><pre>
    Hi all,
    
    My query regarding copying/forwarding messages really wasn't intended
    to be a big deal.  It was prompted by some RGD discussion that Jim was
    involved in.  Basically, from what I could tell, Jim's position was
    similar to mine in that we both despise the tactic.  I was thinking
    that if we had a unanimously strong consensus against it, we could
    institute a house rule.
    
    But it's really no big deal.  If even one person wants to have that
    option, I have no objections to declining the implementation of any
    such rule.
    
    Essentially, my main objection comes from FTF play, in that we don't
    have players walking around with tape recorders and fake dubbing
    machines to try to get/doctor incriminating evidence against other
    players.  To me, it kinda takes away from an element of the game in
    one sense (in that the credible, substantive "proof" that can be
    possible with copied messages (and even more so in the case of
    Xeroxing letters in PBM play, I imagine) removes a level of judgment
    that may otherwise be necessary in predicting stabs and independently
    evaluating credibility), and makes things needlessly complicated in
    another sense (taking the time to doctor up fake messages, or decipher
    them, etc...if I'd wanted to break or set up a code system or do
    detective work, I'd play Clue).
    
    My $0.02.

    A few items:
    
    If you want to have a pre-game discussion, you can send press as a
    non-assigned power by using a long signon command.  I'd suggest you join
    the game as an observer to do this discussion.  Once the game starts, you
    can resign the observer position.  You will get two copies of all game
    messages until you resign as the observer.  I often signon to broadcast my
    message as an observer and then resign in the same message:
    
    signon oghodstoo password
    broadcast
    This is my message......
    dave@kleiman.indianapolis.in.us has resigned dave@kleiman.indianapolis.in.us
    as Observer in game 'ghodstoo'.

    Hi all,
    
    Whoops, sorry about the password mixup.  I've changed mine so that
    these sorts of things hopefully won't happen again.
    
    Regarding phone dip, I'm ambivalent.  I probably won't be making too
    many calls, but in just in case, here's my info:
    
    Hohn Cho
    (213) 955-4689 (WK)
    (310) 320-0331 (HM)
    
    I'm on Pacific time, and you can call me at work literally at any
    time, but at home I'd prefer 10 AM - 10 PM.
    
    Regarding actual negotiations, I apologize, I'm still swamped at work.
    I'll try to get down to business soon.
    
    Jim, since it's the first turn, and in keeping with the FTF tradition
    of having more time to negotiate on the first turn, do you think it
    would be possible to extend the deadline until, say, Monday?  If no
    one else has any objections, that is.

    Hello Edi!
    After years of play, it's a great honor to finally be in a game with
    you...I hope life's treating you well, and that this e-mail crap is
    treating you better than it is me!  I have yet to correctly format a
    message (according to the Judge) and have it get to its recipient.
    I tried to send the same note 15 times to England; no luck.
    Give me a stamp and an envelope any old day...
    
    
    Anyway, IF this should reach you via the Judge, I'm hoping that you
    could see fit to agree to the usual DMZs and peace arrangements
    between our two noble powers.  I have no desire to challenge either
    you and Turkey in a shooting war, and am trying to sound out my
    neighbors as to their 'druthers and whatnot.
    
    If you've got any ideas, suggestions, proposals, etc, I'd love to hear
    them.  I'm hoping for mutual growth for us, and that means a great
    jump-off out of the gate...hence my desire for peace and cooperation.
    What say you?

    To even things up for those who know how to do these things and those
    who do not, here are everyone's register statements (considered to be
    public documents, many people don't like to call themselves experts
    for that reason).  I note that Edi is one level of shy and Mark is
    another, but I think it's fair to say everyone here is highly
    experienced.

    Given Pitt's message, I will grab some private messages that Pitt needs
    to see (but only THIS broadcast) and send them to Pitt and to you (so
    you will know I sent them).  Ummm, you know what I mean....
    I am not changing the deadline for the builds at this point.

    I don't have the text of my last message to you. I do have it at my office.
    
    What I did was to provide extremely compelling reasons that you ought to
    trust me not to bother (oops, uh, 'pester'?) you if you decide to attack
    Russia instead of me. It will save us both (uh, 'each') a lot of trouble if
    you just take my word for it that the reasons were extremely compelling.
    
    Hey, how come you lost all the important partial press, but obviously
    managed to get and reply to all the inane broadcasts?

<p><a name=310></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=808080>Germany</font>:</b><pre>
    This game is beginning to seem like a bad episode of the Twilight Zone to me.
    
    I just sat down to respond the several private messages I received from
    players (you know who you are, I hope) over the past couple of days.  I
    discovered that my mail reader had replaced then text of about 50 Inbox
    messages with the text of one single message (and that was a misdirected
    message intended for a syncon.net address, not syncon.com...)
    
    Given the spate of illnesses, injuries, technical difficulties, and whatnot
    this game has experienced so far, I've taken to carrying a shamrock,
    wearing white, genuflecting three times, drinking holy water, and grounding
    myself before I do anything associated with it.
    
    In any event, assuming that this message will actually make it to the
    intended recipienst, I would very much appreciate it you wouldf resend
    those messages.  I promise I'll reply quickly if they get here (what choice
    do I have?  if I wait, they may mutate and infect my microwave...)

    Yeah, aren't you glad you have me around to cart your messages?
    And Pitt, after I did this for you, you owe me big time!  You had better
    not disappear now.  Give Jamie your answer!!!

    And your follow up was truly compelling.

    Yeah, I was wondering that too as I went back and reviewed everything...
    and I nearly lost the file, but luckily it was retrieved!!  Pitt, you
    will never know what a heart attack you almost caused me..... ah, the
    terror of being a GM to two experienced judge GM's.....

    Aha.
    
    Well, not a surprise, really, that's what you'd build pretty much no matter
    what you were up to.
    
    So, I'm listening, talk. I imagine your first order of business will be to
    eject those German armies... but then what?

    Pitt, I am becoming a bit concerned about the collapse of Russia and the
    probable fall of Italy.  Unless something disrupts the AT alliance, they
    will have Russia down to a couple of units in two years and they will be
    able to win the fleet war in the Med at the same time.  Can we do
    something?  Should we, in your view?

    Tsar Faz,
    
    Please consider supporting my F Edi to North Sea.
    
    If I dislodge the German fleet, I can defend myself for a while longer. If
    Germany can convoy an army across North Sea, I'm in really bad trouble.
    
    I feel reasonably confident that France will at least not be against me,
    and have high hopes that I can get him to exert enough pressure on Germany
    to ease any pressure against you, and to help me survive until the
    character of the board changes.
    
    In the mean time, I have spoken to Hohn on your behalf. He agreed that what
    I said was reasonable, and his main reservation seems to be that he doesn't
    know whether he can trust you. Try to act trustworthy, would you?
    
    By the way, you may expect to keep Norway for the foreseeable future,
    whether I gain North Sea or not. And, *if* you want to cooperate with me, I
    will do everything in my power to help you hold on to those Scandinavian
    possessions, without which you are clearly doomed (the only question being
    which of us would be eliminated first).
    
    Cheers!
    Gentle King Jamie

    Say, I was wondering if you might want some assistance against TA.  You can
    hold them off for a while, but in the end the three fleets against two
    might prove too much.  They might also pick up another one by next fall.
    If you are interested in some help, let me know.
