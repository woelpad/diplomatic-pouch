    if it is just to clarify misperceptions.

    ** Ditto here, Pitt.  Everyone I've talked to says you're not just a
    helluva player, but a Great American as well.  I never doubted either!
    Game persona and emotions are one thing, just like one would scream at a
    muffed play during Sunday football on TV.  But it doesn't translate over
     into real life.

    ** Well, yes, but that's one reason I asked about leaving now.  (Kinda
    late for that, I guess.)  I didn't really hear from you about leaving,
    so I assumed the worst and figured I'd just go there -- didn't have
    anyplace special to go to besides Swe!

    ** truthfully, it seems YOU are more in tune with my reticent Italian
    friend than I've been!  I never expected him to support France instead
    of me.  of course, in retrospect, he's just trying to prop up himself
    for a post-Fassio world of supports, si I *should've* expected it.  I'm
    getting old (and sloppy).

    point about not divulging moves.  I sensed you being reticent about
    options, didn't expect any great divulgings from you, and figured I'd
    keep people guessing while I tried to help Italy.  Moral of the story:
    it's necessary to share ideas.

    ** Naturally, it's your call.  My only concern is that you seem content
    to throw these weak kampfgruppen out east (an offshore fleet and nothing
    else) when you say you're concerned about AT.  It doesn't really show
    that much concern from my bunker.  Now, having said THAT, I fully
    realize that you have to worry about France (I assume that, of course)
    and that you'd like to snuff out any latent Eng threats and start
    expanding again.  So my opinion is tempered; I just get antsy to see the
    cavalry make a line in the sand to AT, is all.
    But you'd expect that from me at this stage.

    ** Again, just a thought.  He may see through it right away and support
    one of us in there (you, no doubt, so he's have no inland threat AND
    still see me go -1).  Or he may fall for it completely.  Frankly, I
    think it has a 30% chance of success (he's just not in position to stab
    Edi), but you never know.

    ** Well, my friend, you definitely have that!   Just keep talking and

    Re taking Nth, I was thinking about that.  If I were to order both fleets
    to hold, both English fleets might go to ground.  You could then sail into
    an empty Nth from Hel.  Chances are, I won't take either center this turn,
    so that might be our best option.  The only risk is that England does go to
    MAO, which means I miss the opportunity to pick up Lon.
    
    Even if England does go to MAO, I'll be okay.  At worst, he picks up Por,
    but at the price of both his home centers.  He can be no more than an
    annoyance, and probably not even that.  He can see that as well as we can,
    so he's likely to cover his home.
    
    What do you think?
    
    Needless to say, Edi is quite disappointed about my failure to hit Venice.
    I am still talking with him, but I think I'll be supporting Italy for the
    time being.
    
    It will be good  when we have England out of the picture so you can move
    those armies in Bel and Hol into action on the eastern front.
    
    On to victory!

    That's pretty much exactly right.  He knows that for A/T to win, they
    will
    have to break the F/G alliance somehow before a stalemate line is set up
    and he sees you as someone who will be likely to waver in the alliance.
    That's one of the reasons he is so friendly right now.  Well, that and
    the fact that my stubbornness is pissing him off... grin.

     Let me guess: France has been pulling a big scam on Italy.  I've finagled
    you into inviting my units in so I could stab you and pick up some easy

    Indeed it is a bad time, my Liege.  That's why I included you in the
    reply to Edi, in the event he got antsy and passed something to Germany.
     After FINALLY getting into Sweden and obtaining some future promises of
    cooperation, the last thing I need is Edi to muck it up by
    cutting-and-pasting a phony message to Pitt.  Keeping you on the distro
    is my reserve, should proof ever be needed of good intent (until you
    'accidentally' delete it, of course...)
    
    Notice that my press  tried to be sarcastic to Edi, in that he's
    'promising' things that aren't his, and not returning things he stole
    from me in the first place.  Count on NO westward regression by me.  (Of
    course, if Italy keeps supporting you and not me, I won't get Vienna,
    either... grin.)

    The travel arrangements of course seem tempting; your travel agency
    always does a nice job of packaging these offers.
    
    However, before I book any fares on your airline, I was wondering if I
    couldn't do a quick Pitt Stop (no pun intended) in my (former) terminal
    of Warsaw -- you know, sort of a nice Austrian gesture of sincerity.
    Heaven knows it's hard to run an airline these days with AT in three of
    my four terminals.  And, well, with Sweden back in my hands (and Turkey
    backing your hands!), it might sweeten the pot to know that folks care
    about long-term cooperative efforts.
    
    I'm sure King Jean also has unease at the apparent "monopoly of travel"
    that AirEdi and AirHohn have been doing, and feels equally desirous to
    see some Eastern Goodwill before we would *ever* consider to do any
    Western Badwill.   Si?

    Well it seems that we are collecting tourist these days.  You have noticed
    that the Fall Fest at Munich is a great attraction for tourists who like to
    support themselves for a good time.
    This would have the only possibility for preserving the Russian presence in
    the future press wars and would be a nice conclusion to the extended southern
    wandering of the Russian Bohemians.
    
    Your mutual cooperation in this manner is requested and we look forward to
    your confirmation that exit visas from Austrian territory can be issued

    Well, Pitt has been "promising" to help against Edi since the very first
    year and has yet to do anything constructive.  In fact, he has been
    downright wishy washy on the subject.  When I combine that with Edi's
    claim that Pitt has been on line with him (Edi) since the start of the
    game, I start wondering.  Maybe I'm just alarmed by exactly how MUCH
    damage could be done with that army in Munich.  He's likely to get
    another build this year too.  If it wasn't for the fact that YOU aren't
    in a position to make an enemy of him, I'd almost want you and Russia to
    take Munich this turn.  Too bad it isn't feasible...
    
    > In any event, I appreciate your word of caution re moving to Piedmont.

    I was also worried about your army in Tyrolia having a place to retreat
    given any perfidy on Pitt's part.  Have to plan for junk like that,
    y'know... :)

    Glad to see we're on the same wavelength.  I was wondering though, if
    you see the future of the game in the same light as I do?  I think our
    only chance of doing well is to stick together and force the others to
    deal with us as a single power bloc.  With the board position as it is,
    I see it as an obvious case of "together we stand. divide we fall".

    John:
    
    Here's the followup letter I promised you.
    
    What is your current relationship with Germany?  It seems to be one of
    cautious optimism.  I have real concerns that he may be working with
    either of A/T (in the long run that is) and can't be trusted to do
    anything to really help us.  The worries I expressed about A Mun hitting
    your army in Tyrolia are quite real.  What is your impression?
    
    If the opportunity presents itself, presumably after England and Russia
    are gone, will you be willing to attack him?  I think that if you and I
    stick together as a real bloc, we will be able to really dictate the
    balance of power in the game.  Comments?

    Mark:  Got some mail from Pitt asking me what I'd like to see from him.
    Basically, I told him I'd like to see him get off his ass and help out
    against Edi.  It'll be fun to read his reply.
    
    I think Pitt is hoping to wait until all us little guys are gone and
    then he and Hohn will take out Edi and race to 18 (or a two-way).  That
    would explain why he doesn't want to do anything to upset Edi right now
    - he doesn't want to tip his hand while there are others around who
    could conceivably take advantage of the situation.  I told him that in
    hopes of getting him to do something to help us.  Who knows?  Maybe he
    will.
    
    What did you want to do with A Boh?  I assume you got the letter I sent
    to you and France.  I meant it when I said that if you want to try for
    Vienna, I'll support you.  Let me know.

    You know what I'd like to see? Some firm, aggressive moves against Edi
    that
    let me know exactly where you stand.  So far, you haven't done anything
    to
    make me disbelieve Edi's claim that you have been part of HIS team since
    S'01.  While I'm not as paranoid as Mark (heh heh, thank God), I am
    still
    very concerned by the apparent lack of interest on your part to stopping
    the A/T juggernaut.  I know you're aware that, in any two-on-two
    situation
    (here I'm assuming a F/G vs A/T), the duo that crosses the stalemate
    line
    first wins all the time (barring internal stabs).  You haven't tried to
    take
    advantage of the fact that I can slow A/T down very seriously for
    another
    one-and-a-half to two years.  Instead of farting around against Russia,
    you
    should be trying to sweep across central Europe to engage Austria in a
    fight
    for position, ESPECIALLY while I'm around to help run interference.
    
    Near as I can tell, the only reason you could have for waiting until the

    you
    have some kind of long range deal with Turkey.  When the little guys are

    I can organize us "little guys" long enough for that to not happen.  You
    won't be able to afford to sit around doing nothing without tipping your
    hand to Edi.
    
    Of course, I could be totally wrong.  In which case, never mind...

    Funny, I already answered this one once, but it came back as unsendable.
    Anyway, you have it pretty much on the head.  Although Edi hasn't
    mentioned
    you much, he has maintained that you will inevitably pounce on my
    "weakness".
    I have told him that you're obviously going to realize that I'm your

    > What's your thinking on the tactics?  What role do you see for A Boh?
    
    I'm sending this note to both of you, so we can get together on what
    moves we want to make.  I'll also send follow-up notes to each of you
    after.  No objections, I hope.  Let me know if there are.  I'm not
    trying to double deal (yeah, as if, with MY position...grin), it's
    just that some aspects of the situation are of interest to one and
    not the other.
    
    My feelings on tactics?  My feeling is that I wish I could get IBM's
    chess computer to look at them for me.
    
    Here's a few thoughts:
    
    - A/T's priorities are taking: 1) Trieste and 2) the Ionian.
    
    - minor priorities/concerns for A/T are: 1) protecting Vienna and
      2) covering Warsaw.
    
    - they have four units on Trieste and three on the Ionian
    
    - we have three supports on Trieste, but will Munich cut the support
      from Tyrolia?  I see this as a real danger.  John, what's your
      feeling on this?  You talk to Pitt more than the rest of us.
    
    - I wonder if a gamble of A Tri-Vie, s by A Tyo & A Boh would work?
    
    - I don't see any way to get Mark into Vienna as I'm assuming Tri
      will be cut and Gal will support Vie.  I'm willing to try if you
      guys think otherwise.  Mark stands a chance of being eliminated
      if we don't.
    
    - I think we will have to cede the Ionian to A/T in a turn or two
      regardless of anything else that happens.  I'd be in favour of
      having F Lyo move to the Tyrrhenian THIS turn.  I'll move Tyn to
      Naples and let Ion retreat to Tunis if necessary.  Comments?
    
    - as a summary of tactics, here is my current suggestion:
    
    F: F Lyo-Tyn; A Tyo s A Tri-Vie
    I: A Tri-Vie; A Ven-Tri; F Adr s A Ven-Tri; F Ion-Adr; F Tyn-Nap
    R: A Vie s A Tri-Vie
    
    Notes: John, I don't want you to move to Piedmont as I don't think
    you should leave your homeland with only one army to defend it.
    Mark, as I said, if you think we'd have a better chance of success
    by supporting YOU to Vienna, I have no problem with it.  I just want
    to make sure we can do something offensive-minded this turn.  We'll
    be falling back into stalemate-mode all too soon as it is.
    
    Comments?  Suggestions?

    Edi:
    Just an addendum to what I sent about earlier...
    
    You are very, very good at getting others to do your dirty work:  me
    hitting Turkey, urging me on vs E and G, etc etc.  ironic as it seems,
    though, now that I'm at 3 -- and a potentially stable 3, may I add  -- I
    actually am in a better position to hurt you *now* as a weakling, than
    when we could've been equals.   If Germany accedes to my requests for
    SWE, then a northern stalemate line is formed, and France bottles up the
    south.  I get to keep BOH as a rogue, and even the center becomes
    problematic for you -- witness that one central unit tying down your
    War/Gal, Vie, and Bud for lo these many turns.
    
    In that event, either I get stabbed by a German (in collusion with Hohn,
    probably), or we hold the line and Hohn eventually stabs you (probably
    in cahoots with a F hit of I).  Either way, YOU are the exposed ally of
    the AT confederation, faced now with a wall to its front, and the
    prospects for a restless Turk in your rear.
    
    You see what I mean about having a quasi-advantageous position right
    now?  Tiny little Russia....
    
    Unless you figure a way to honestly deal -- and that includes returning
    WAR to me -- you're on your own with the bed you chose to lie in.
    
    Good luck, amigo.  I'll take my chances as they stand.  It's starting to
    get fun watching the board "ferment."

    Edi,
    
    I haven't heard a word from Pitt. He is just not paying much attention to
    the game, I think. Ironic that he's winning. (Well, insofar as there is
    such thing as being the leader in Diplomacy.) I'm not sure that anyone is
    paying as much attention as I would be if I were still in real contention.
    Maybe you and Hohn are, but up here in my sphere there is almost no talk,
    nor has there been for most of the game. And I don't think Cal is doing
    much diploming either. It's kind of a shame, considering the intent and
    nature of the game. With lots of talk and sneaky plans, I think I'd have a
    much better chance of getting myself back in it. Still not *much* chance,
    but with things as they are I see John just continuing on his stolid course
    of action, and Pitt just continuing to move conservatively to consolidate
    the fragments of Scandinavia. Oh well.
    
    I don't think I'll order my fleet to Norway if I hear nothing from Pitt
    about it. I *might*, but probably not.

    True.  You might be better off just trying for one of his home SC's in the
    hopes that you outguess him.  Odds are, if he's even thinking of taking the
    risk of any aggressive action he will leave LON uncovered in order to gat
    to MAO.  So, if you go for LON, you may bounce but you will be bouncing ENG
    and not NTH.

    I think that's a good idea, though I wouldn't have felt comfortable raising
    the issue if you hadn't done so first.  By propping Italy up, you slow down
    the AT advance and ensure that Italy will get more and more out of position
    against you while you get the perfect ecuse for snuggling up to his centers.
    
    >It will be good  when we have England out of the picture so you can move
    >those armies in Bel and Hol into action on the eastern front.
    
    You bet.  I expect to be on the receiving end of some aggressive action
    from Turkey (and possibly Austria) in the near future.  Those armies would
    be a great help if they were further east.

    It will take a *lot* of luck. But, sure, it's possible.
    
    The thing is, if Germany were preparing to invade France, I presume that he
    would not like Edi's plan so much, since it allows France to gain a unit
    (in effect, at Russia's expense, since I would take Nwy and let France
    enter Edinburgh). Too bad, since it really does look like France is ripe
    for invading, with at least two of his units committed to the south, and
    maybe three, and another two or three tied up against me. Well, we'll see.
    
    >As for stabs, I don't plan on stabbing Edi this turn, FYI.  Make
    >of it what you will.
    
    Right. Well, I suppose the best scenario for me, anyway, would be to have
    you and Edi stick together in the south, Germany take command in the north,
    and then I'd play some sort of spoiler role in the ending. To have all of
    Edi's attention turned toward avenging a Turkish stab would leave Germany's
    hands a bit *too* free for my survival chances.

    ** Everything depends on the German's attitude.  He seems grudgingly

    Quite frankly, he may hold in MUN (or hit BOH again), to "prevent me

    will be open for me a s a retreat, regardles, although me in GAL has
    advantages....especially if you guys can help me convince Pitt to let me

    The big problem will be the 'creeping" moves along the Alb/Adr/Apu
    coastlines, coupled with an Italian center loss.  I mean, even if you
    get VIE, the advantage in that is not position for you, but denying Edi
    builds -- and thus perhaps further enticing Turkey to stab.  If you lose
    TRi and go -1, then the problem comes in a few game turns:  Units are in
    TUN, TYS, NAP and ADR, and you have to cover APU against a convoy/sail
    there, as well as any moves they make to hit ADR.  I see Edi as
    supporting Hohn this turn to ION, this giving them that ALb unit as
    cover.
    
    If it were me, I would at least *consider* the desperate move of TRI-ALB
    (ADR S), in the hopes that Eme or Aeg take ION.  If that happens, you
    stand the chance of annihilating Edi's F ALB, thus reducing the
    longer-temr threat to the Italian heel.
    
    If you guys are content to hit VIE, then in all seriousness I would
    suggest France's Mar-Apu (via convoys), or at least as far as TUS.
    Untilate destination:  APU.  I'm sure you both think me mad for such a
    suggestion -- Italy because it allows the potential fox in the
    henhouse," France because it sends a defense unit halfway across the
    continent for a dubious, long-term defense.   But short of an Itaoian
    gain/stabilization, we need one more unit down there to hold the
    coastline.  Again, GERMANY is the key to it all.  If F/G are in
    lockstep, then John and Pitt are gonna hose us all in the long run,
    let's face it.  If F/G are doubtful, then France has the capabilities of
    building from English centers; especially with Germany "maybe" going -1
    this turn and not getting into England proper until 1907.
    
    The small "gnat's ass" for France, however, might be England!  If Jamie
    plays reckless, he could go to MAO this turn, covering one home center,
    giving John the other, and then playing Mao as a surface raider along
    the French coastline for the remainder of the game.  Again, SMALL threat
    potentuial, but something to be recognized.

    I actually think you aren't quite squashed yet.  I think Edi's

    move against France very soon.  With luck, France will move for

    John,
    
    FYI, Edi's at it again.  He has brokered a deal including me, Turkey,
    England and him that will result in Russia's elimination this year.  While
    I'm all for that (he's been a constant pain to me), I'd prefer not to see
    England gain NOR, which is part of the deal.  So, I'm going to renege on my
    promised support for NTH-NOR.  I'll order SKA-NOR instead whcih will
    preventEngland from taking it (though it has the unfortunate side effect of
    keeping Russia alive...)
    
    I'm passing this along to you because, assuming that England is serious
    about trying for NOR (which I believe he is), EDI will be unprotected.
    It's important that you take at least one English SC this year so that he
    can be easily eliminated next year.
    
    Hope this is useful to you.

    I don't think we need to resort to desperation tactics just yet.  With
    the units and position we have now, we can make A/T fight for every
    inch.
    We can hold them to one space a season or so, we can kill all their
    momentum.  After that, anything can happen.

    I would have no problem with a French unit in Apu, but I don't consider
    this good tactics.  For one, it wouldn't get the needed French fleet any
    closer to the front and second, it would leave John with only one unit
    defending his home land.

    This is a commentary that the GM wishes to put into the game record.
    
    For what it's worth.....
    
    Pitt has a relatively crucial decision to make this turn.  It looks
    like he has decided (as of this instant) to put Russia out of the
    game and (effectively) to put England out of the game (by pushing
    France to take Edinburgh).
    
    This will leave the board with five players and with Edi and Hohn
    moving a little farther than they would under Mark's plan.  Whether
    this additional gain on their part is important depends upon what
    Jamie's reaction is once this move "goes down" (i.e. will Norway
    be a puppet to Germany) and on Hohn and Edi's skill in exploiting
    it.  This game could very quickly lock up into a five way draw
    or there could be more play in it.  Germany's reaction to the
    attack on Vienna also is important.  If Pitt cuts either Mark's
    or John's support, Vienna will not fall.  If it does fall, then
    Edi's problems continue.
    
    It is still the GM's opinion that Pitt's inability to negotiate
    during the crucial season last year has indirectly led to this
    locked up position.  Without Germany as an active negotiator,
    the anti-AT alliance could not form fully.
    
    I make this (rare) comment to the game record because I see
    this season as so crucial.  What will Pitt do????

    I received a notice about my retreat but it was not complete in that it
    does not mention the Russian Fleet Sweden.  Is it that the Judge does not

    Cal,
    
    Sigh.  Well, it looks like I have to stab Edi now.  Good job on
    the guessing.
    
    I think it would be in your best interest (and most definitely in
    mine :) ) to build an army rather than a fleet.  I promise you
    that I will build an army, that I will divide Edi up with you,
    and that I will get the hell out of ION immediately (probably
    into GRE).  If you build a fleet, though, I'll have to reconsider
    my plans, unfortunately.
    
    I suspect you will be wary of my proposal, but please look at the
    board from my perspective.  If you disagree with me, and believe
    that Edi is _not_ crying out to be stabbed now in light of the
    circumstances, then by all means, build a fleet and let's
    continue to duke it out.  But if you're interested, please let me
    know.  I'll also be more than willing to consider any reasonable
    modifications to the general plan, of course.
    
    Take care,

    Hi guys!
    
    Well, that turn went fairly well.  Turkey's in the Ionian, but we took
    Vienna and have a chance to keep it AND Trieste.  If we can manage to
    guess right again, we can make quite a dent in Austria.
    
    Looks like this will be your last turn Mark, but I think you were
    expecting that.  Would you mind doing us one last favour before
    death do us part?  (I don't see any likely way to get you a centre;
    if you have any ideas, let us know)
    
    Here's my best suggestion for mutual tactics:
    
    F: F Tyn-Ion; A Tyo s A Ven-Tri
    
    I: (Retreat f Ion-Tun) A Ven-Tri, s by A Vie;
       F Adr-Alb; F Nap & F Tun s F Tyn-Ion
    
    R: A Boh-Gal (finally, eh?  grin)
    
    I think they'll be expecting us to simply support in place in an effort
    to hold both centres.  I'm betting Hohn will use Ion to hit Adriatic, so
    using that fleet to hit Albania will (I hope) be unexpected.
    
    Anybody have any suggestions?

    But I reckon you've done it the least of all my neighbors, so I will

    No doubt Pitt will say he just got careless and forgot to change his
    orders, or something like that.
    
    I guess he prefers to have Russia keep that one remaining unit in *your*
    hair, and to give France another unit to use against you and Hohn. I can't
    think of any other explanation. If he wanted Norway for himself, he could
    have just told me to go protect Edinburgh; then *Germany* would add a unit,
    Russia would be out, and France and I would remain at our old strengths. In
    effect he gave up the build to Russia, and redistributed a center from me
    to France!
    
    Some games nothing goes right. :)

    John
    Do you see the board as I do?  the more I stare at it, the more I think
    you may need to "pre-empt" Pitt.
    
    The facts:
    1) He has done NOTHING to prevent ANY AT encroachment westward, and,
    mysteriously, they've done nothing to harm him.
    
    2) When a stalemate line could've been done up north with my guys in
    'perpetual hold,' thus saving troops for the SIL/BOH/PRU corridor, Pitt
    opts to overextend himself and stab me.   besides proving himself just
    as sleazy as A/T, he now leaves himself exposed in STP...UNLESS he has a
    grand plan????
    
    3) Speaking of grand plans, look at his unit disposition.  Where are SWE
    and DEN going?  What's he building?  He has a heavy "westward 'lean'" to
    him, it seems to me.   And if he decides to lean your way, then he and
    his buds completely flank the south and do the big "right hoom through
    Paris" routine, a  la 1914.
    
    I know you have no desire to help England, and you probably could give a
    fig about me (let's forget that shifting from your borders that I pulled
    off regarding E/I; won't even mention it -grin-).  But those western
    armies of his, and his build, and the extra fleets -- where do the GO
    once England and I are gone?
    
    If it were me (and it's not, I realize), I'd offer Eng amnesty if he
    removes Channel.  I'd ask him to keep NTH, support me to MUN, and build
    yourself A Paris....going Par S Mar-Mun, Bre-Pic, Wal-Ech, and watching
    Pittnget hit from three sides (E, F and R) and implode "just a little."
    
    You may ask yourself if that's wise, given you're knee-deep vs A/T now.
    but you can't stab Cal without opening up the sluice gates to the A/T
    tide (you'd be next), and if you DON'T handle Pitt, he'll be in the
    vanguard now when they come west....
    
    besides, if you DO hit him, you can make peace with the Turk, and the
    two of you can kill Pitt and watch I/T kill Edi (before you kill Cal).
    See how simple it all is?
    
    Please consider my words, even if only fleetingly, King Jean.  And that
    support to MUn sure would be appreciated....

    Even though it was never your intent, I thank you for your bounce in
    Norway.  The German has proven himself *more than* the "equal" of Hohn
    and Edi this game, so your bounce at least gives me one last defiant
    shot at MUN (should France help me, which, admittedly, he probably won't
    be prone to do).
    
    I'm disgusted.  Disgusted with the bald-faced lies (not even
    sugar-coated!) of Pitt, Edi and Hohn; disgusted that the heavy writers
    this game (you, me and Cal) are screwed, and -- obviously  -- disgusted
    with my own play (SUCKER!) and the lack of help I gave you.  Well, water
    under the bridge at this stage.
    
    I've had it with PBEM.  I find that my persona has become TOO
    "game-involved" when I get behind a keyboard, and I find little time to
    savor either the few good moves or, more frequently, these visible
    pummelings.  Pressure at work doesn't help much, time-wise.  I'm glad I
    met you and got to see the 'ghods' in action, but quite honestly, I'm a
    troglodyte stuck in the snail-mail motif for the long-term, and I think
    I'll slink back that way very soon ... a kindler, gentler breed of liars
    in the mail hobby, and probably "more my speed."
    
    I'm sorry the game didn't work well for you, Jamie.
    
    PS)  Would've expected you to perhaps do Nth-Lon and Eng-Mao, leaving
    Iberia open for raiding...or supporting A/T from behind.   Not that I
    clump you in with the liars and cheats this game (i.e., you hurting
    Cal), but for survival and remaining options, it might've been a good
    one to try.  (Of course, I'm a fine one to give advice...)

    Gentlemen,
    
    You have both offered to assist France's cause in the coming years of our
    tragic conflict.  I am appreciative of the offers.  I applaud your
    persistence against great odds.  I must also confess to a bit of
    nervousness.  Excellent players such as you can turn a desperate situation
    into a winning hand, and so I fear that abetting your survival might come
    back to haunt me.  Nonetheless, I am inclined to accept your offers.
    
    The Tsar has provided with me a most trenchant analysis of the situation.
    He may wish to share it with England. In any event, the way I see it is
    that the builds and the Spring turn will tell all.  If Germany is in fact
    allied with AT, now is the time he must strike against me.  Thus, any build
    other than A Berlin augurs badly for France.  More importantly, he would
    have to move toward me in the Spring.  Both of you will be alive then.  If
    Germany attacks me, I pledge all my efforts to keep you alive.  If Germany
    does not, then we will review the situation.  I won't foreclose any options
    at this point, but I can't pledge support in that event.  We shall see.
    
    This is the best I can do for the moment.  You have both said that you are
    willing to work with me because I have been, if not entirely forthcoming,
    not blatantly dishonest like the others.  In that spirit, I have tried to
    be as candid as possible.
    
    Best of luck.

    Pitt,
    
    The game has reached a turning point.  You have finally turned aside all
    the threats.  I have  all but eliminated England and eased my way into a
    commanding position re Italy.  It seems we've accomplished what we set out
    to do many turns ago.  Now we have to cash in.  How do we do that?
    
    I think, first, that I have to continue supporting Italy.  We stand chance
    of winning against AT.  Our chances will go way up if you can now start
    pressuring them on land.  I hope you will build A Ber, in preparation for a
    move east.  I can probably remove England from NTH this year, freeing up
    your other armies.
    
    In the long run, TGF can defeat AT, and then you and I can cut Italy down
    to size.  Then we'd be into the end game, both as dominant powers.  I'll
    take it.
    
    Needless to say, I found Turkey's support for your capture of STP quite
    interesting.  As you might guess, others are pointing to it as proof that
    you are allied with AT, which is to lead to my rapid demise.  How do you
    see it?

    >
    >Looks like this will be your last turn Mark, but I think you were
    >expecting that.
    
    ** Actually, Cal, I was not.   Oh sure, I suspected it could occur (why
    not, given their track records vs me?), but Germany fed me the exact
    opposite BS for two turns....I honestly figured he'd be content to leave
    me at 3 (fleet up north to help him later vs F or E, armies to
    perpetually tie down AT in Scandy).  Why he made a half-baked stab and
    let a bounce in Nwy occur is beyond me, but frankly I'm miffed that he
    went through this whole subtrefuge to stab me, when I told him to just
    "get it over with" if he was going to do it.  No need to bamboozel me.
    But no, he's gotta play Mr Dip.

    But what does this do?  If you hit ALB unsupported, you don't cut its
    support for Ion-ADr, meaning you still lose ADR and do nothing to ALB.
     I mean, it's just as good a move as any, but you're either going to
    have enemies in ADR and ALb, or in ALB and APU, probably.  But yes, we
    WILL have a unit in ION.  That means a lot, given another expected Turk
    build....
    
    Good luck, Cal.

    Sorry about the incomplete message.  Sometimes this machine gets
    anxious and fires off letters before I'm ready.
    
    Anyway, as I was saying: yes, I'm wary of you, but fortunately, I
    don't have to place myself in your hands for a turn or two.  I can
    wait to see if you stab Edi AND pull out of the Med before deciding
    that we are brothers in arms again (again?  hmmmm....)
    
    As for other tactics, if you think Edi will not be expecting you
    to move back to Greece, I would appreciate it if A Bul would hit
    Serbia.  This will go a long way towards ensuring me a build and
    establishing I/T trust.  How about it?

    I'm certainly MORE than willing to work with you against Edi and
    also in the long run.  I'm quite aware that, while France has been
    a great help to me thus far, he's only there helping me to make sure
    he stops A/T.  He communicates readily enough, but whenever I ask
    about long term plans he ignores the letter.  I've come to the
    conclusion that he is one of those players (God bless 'em) who
    simply cannot tell a bald faced lie.  That makes his future plans,
    given his silence on the matter, a foregone conclusion.
    
    Assuming I get a build, I will build that army.  I can use my
    imbalance of a/f's as an excuse.  However, if there is a long
    term future for us, it will consist of you being the land power and
    me being the naval power.  That means you'll have to get over your
    fear of little green fleets eventually.  This was the problem we had
    the LAST time I built a fleet, remember?  :)

    Ah, funny how quickly we unite again, noble King!
    
    I am remaining mum to all.  I did tell Italy I'd "like" to hit MUn if
    France would help, but that I didn't expect it.  (You may wish to write
    and say that we've talked, and I'm now moving to Gal.  That's what Cal
    recommended.)  This will throw off any disingenuous remark Cal may
    proffer to Pitt, if he even talks to Pitt.
    
    I'm assuming we're all a "go," although note France's words carefully.
    If Pitt smells a rat, or is crafty enough to delay his attack until Fall
    to see more anti-E moves from his "ally," then I'm dead for sure (you
    will live longer, but in a relative term).   I'm discontinuing press to
    Edi (to make it seem like I'm committed to him to the death) and will
    write Hohn, asking him to "help himself" as I throw myself at edi for
    the last hurrah.  This will hopefully be communicated to Edi and thus to
    Pitt....

    M. Jean (et le petite tsar Faz),
    
    	Your discourse on the present crisis appears sound.
    
    	I think you are correct to place your stock in Germany's actual
    *moves* rather than trust to in the sound and fury of his words. His recent
    machinations could have either of two meanings: he might be preparing the
    way for a drang nach Osterreich by weakening the Austrian position and
    leaving a Russian army as an anti-Hapsburg gadfly; or he might be keeping
    the Kaiserungarn distracted while he readies his troops for an invasion of
    France. Time only will tell. I decline to guess.
    
    	I shall in any event disband my F Eng.
    
    	You are also correct that we (or perhaps I should speak only for
    myself) throw our lots with you because we prefer to see the ending, in our
    own absences, favor one who has retained the aegis of honor through the
    nasty business of war and diplomacy. At the suggestion that you might live
    to regret any aid you might supply or succor you might charitably bestow,
    as either the Tsar or I should rise phoenix-like to strike you, you receive
    only my sardonic smile.
    
    Bonne chance pour tout le doux,
    
    Gentle King Jamie (manning the lifeboats)

<p><a name=58></a><b>Private message from <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font> to <font color=00cccc>France</font>:</b><pre>
    Russia for one accepts the conditional support of France!  Indeed, if
    anything other than A Ber appears on the German's home front, then your
    immediate time to strike is spring, and at Munich.  If nothing else, he
    will be forced to fix Ber in position (to defend MUN) if he even
    anticipates such a blow.   However, be advised that he may delay until
    fall or next spring (when I'm gone and he can guage what YOU do...)
    Again, much depends on future AT moves.  Faced with an F/I southern
    wall, they will have to advance SOMEwhere, and Pitt's the likely
    approach route...unless he's in cahoots with them????
    
    May I suggest you write the German and tell him that "Russia has
    contacted f/i and has been persuaded to die gloriously in a move to Gal,
    to help cement the south."  If you confirm that Russia has agreed to an
    F/I southern approach, we may be able to keep the German quiescent and
    in tough straits, should he hit you.
    
    I myself expect a spring move, as he realizes you must build A PAR.  In
    that case, Mun, Hol and BEL are all available to hit you, which is why I
    applaud your inclusion of England for help.
    
    My only point of disagreement (incredulity?  humor?) is your (no-doubt
    genuine) compliment about good players turning this into a winning hand
    for themselves.  My friend, I have no homeland for builds; no forces
    other than an isolated province, entirely dependent upon your goodwill
    to even survive beyond 1906; and no hopes of ever being 'unfettered'
    beyond that...I have one card in my 'deck,' so a "winning hand" at this
    stage merely means being allowed to remain at the table....but thanks
    for the kind words.

    And so, Tsar Faz, our fates appear again to be entwined. How fitting.
    
    Let us be very careful in what we say to Kaiser Pitt, lest he get wind that
    something is up. But we must somehow try to convince him to build a fleet,
    or failing that an army in Munich. Otherwise we shall die simultaneously
    this coming year.
    
    I believe that Kaiserungarn Edi would be happy to assist diplomatically in
    encouraging Germany to invade France. Goes without saying. But, again, we
    have to approach the matter with subtlety. I've just mentioned the general
    shape of the situation to Edi, and will let you know what he says.
    
    To Pitt I expressed only chagrin and disappointment, since anything else
    would smack of disingenuousness. But if he tries, I will let him convince
    me to use my last unit against France.
    
    I have also dropped a note to Sultan Hohn. I leave Doge Cal to your
    influence, if any.
    
    May our dwindling fortunes rise on this last full tide,

    Big Witch,
    
    The King and Royal Family are boarding the royal yacht on the Thames,
    preparing to abandon the last stronghold of Britannia in Buckingham Palace.
    On the eve of the fall of the British Empire, we wonder whether there is
    any last-ditch manouever which could save a remnant.
    
    The larger situation is very delicate. Kaiser Pitt will determine the shape
    of the endgame. He could stick with his French buddy and go plowing into
    Austria, leaving his formidable navy to mop up the Romanoffs with ease. Or
    he could begin his drang nach *oesten* (how do you spell that?)
    immediately. I believe either option is viable for Germany; his remaining
    healthy neighbors would each separately be glad to leave him alone. All
    this is fairly obvious.
    
    I don't know which sort of endgame you prefer. I think if it were me I'd
    rather see France and Germany fighting, otherwise you will most likely be
    the weaker member of the triad in the ending. But I'm not sure.
    If you think your interests might coincide with my (meager) ones, do let me

    Edi,
    
    You really need to get Germany and France fighting, now. Obviously. That is
    also my only hope to survive another year.
    
    France is somewhat wary. If Germany builds a fleet, or even if he builds A
    Mun, France expects to be attacked.
    
    If France and Germany fight, Russia and I will let France order our units
    around. (Anyway, *I* will, and Mark *says* he will.) France knows this.
    Germany doesn't.
    
    I give you this information because (1) it may help you, and (2) you may
    have a suggestion for what I ought to say to Pitt to get him to move
    against France this year.

    Heh.
    
    I'll tell you what.  Let's talk long-term plans.
    
    I'll build no more fleets, ever.  In fact, if we can arrange the
    dislodgement of one of my fleets some time in the not-too-distant
    future, I'll disband that as well.  I'll limit my fleets to one
    in EAS, one in AEG, and one in BLA (with an army in GRE).
    
    Right after we dice up Edi, we should demilitarize the area and
    press northward.  This will further reduce the possibility of a
    stab between us.  The kicker, IMO, is to position ourselves well
    enough so that Germany runs into a wall, and is encouraged to
    stab France.
    
    I believe this game will (or should) end in a three-way.  I'll go
    one step further and say that I believe _all_ games with seven
    expert players should end in a three-way.  I'd like to be one of
    those three, and to be honest I'd rather you be the second of the
    three over France.  He hasn't impressed me overly much, and
    you've always played it straight with me (well, except for Spring
    1901, but I'll certainly forgive you for that if you forgive my
    one turn's dishonesty from a few years ago :) ).  You've also
    played a better game, IMO.
    
    It looks like there is a high probability that Pitt will be
    guaranteed part of the three-way, as well.  Which is fine with
    me, although I'm certainly open to suggestions if you have any
    ideas of how to take him down a peg or three.

    No problem.  I have the same problem with my call waiting

    I haven't looked at the board carefully yet, but that sounds
    reasonable so far.
    
    I'd like to stress the importance of secrecy for now, so that Edi
    doesn't get wind of our working together.  If he doesn't suspect
    me (as he shouldn't, since we've been working together so well
    this game), I should be able to give you completely accurate
    information as to his movements this turn.  But that will only
    work if he doesn't suspect anything.
    
    I have told him that I'd be sending you a note this turn trying
    to convince you to build an army, but he doesn't know the extent
    or depth of our communications and planning.  If you have to tell
    him anything, maybe just tell him that I've been trying to get
    you to build an army.
    
    Other than that, any other thoughts?

    Yeah? That obviously makes no sense at all. Did you really think I would
    swallow that explanation?
    
    You obviously could have simply told me that you were going to move to
    Norway, and told me to cover Edinburgh. *YOU* would then have had an extra
    center, and *you* would have been able to support your F STP. It's
    completely obvious that I would not have moved to Norway knowing that you
    would be moving there, that I would have covered Edinburgh instead.
    
    Since that option is overwhelmingly obvious, I know you didn't just fail to
    notice it. I am having a lot of trouble avoiding the conclusion that you are
    lying through your teeth, even though I can't see the slightest reason for it.

    Gee, we actually have something to talk about!  I'm assuming that you
    are still interested in having some effect in this game, so I have an
    offer for you.
    
    Although I had no choice about asking France to help me against A/T, I'm
    still a bit worried about all the units he has around my centres.
    Therefore, I wouldn't be averse to seeing something weaken him a bit.  I
    suppose you've noticed that, if you keep your fleet in English Channel,
    you can move to the Mid and then take a shot at Portugal or Spain.  If
    he doesn't move A Mar-Spa THIS turn you have Por unopposed and even if
    he does, you have no worse than a fifty-fifty shot.  This is better than
    your likely odds of survival with any other strategy.
    
    If you DO decide to try this tactic, I'll do my best to tie his units up
    so as to ensure your survival.
    
    Interested?

    I would like to strongly urge you to build either ARmy Kiel or Fleet Kiel
    as this would be a good signal that the western campaign is on.
    
    If you build a Fleet, which may be a better idea it would allow you to
    shuttle Army Holland down to Ruhr and use Belgium for Picardy while
    shifting fleet Kiel to Holland.  I would pull Army Den down to Kiel and
    move Sweden to Denmark to Pick up Norway in the Fall and to be able to
    threaten North Sea more effectively.  AFter all you can also afford to
    redeploy F StP to Both and then out to Sweden.
    
    Again I will make it clear that I need your Army in Munich to go to Tyrolia.

    Jim,
    
    Time again for my review of the situation.  I am waiting on Pitt to say
    something about the coming year.  His lack of communication is ominous,
    IMO.  I at first waived my build, but I've now changed to A Paris.  I had
    thought to allay any doubts he might have arising from all those French
    armies and also leave open the possibility of acquiring another fleet next
    year.  Because he won't answer my messages, I've ordered A Paris.
    
    As you know, I have continued talking to R and E.  I think they are sincere
    in wanting to help me.  They are both conscientious and will work to stay
    alive as long as they can.  I am probably their best hope.  If Pitt does
    turn on me, I will need them.
    
    The tricky thing about the build is that, if I tell Pitt I'll waive, he
    might be more tempted to come after me.  If I don't, he'll be more afraid
    of me and thus more likely to attack.  Lose-lose.
    
    As for me, I continue to believe that GF alliance is the best long-term
    option.  I don't want to attack Germany.  If I do, G will probably join AT
    and drive for a 3-way, at least until the rest of us are all but gone.
    
    This is always the worst part of the game for me.

    ((Bohemia Daily; Dateline:  Prague))
    
    Tsar Faz, making his last-ditch stand with the troops in the field, sent
    the following samizdat literature to the homeland, in the hopes that the
    memory of Russian arms will spark a country-wide fire against the hated
    occupiers:
    
    Friends!  Countrymen!  Russia stands occupied, but not pacified. Our
    troops run retreated, but not defeated.  And our neighbors talk so
    nice--but prove themselves lice.   We Russians refuse to be cowed into
    submission by those who have imperial dreams of repression.   In fact,
    things are looking bright for Russia!  We have hired the services of
    Jeanne Dixon, Clairvoyant to the Stars (and to Rasputin).  She brings
    interesting news.  Says Jeanne:
    
    "In the East, the A/T monolith approaches the end of its "free ride."
    Tsar Faz, wisely trading space for territoryr, has managed to give up all
    his space, and now has lots of free time. (Who said this guy couldn't
    play?!)   And the rapacious ones  now meet each other, with no Russian
    buffer to separate them.  With no Russkies nearby, the Turkish Gobbler
    will hunger for another turkey to fill its plate.  While the German
    (Pitt's-)burghers look tempting, The Perry Mason of the West will instead
    opt for Greece-y 'flank" stakes (made in Rumania by Vlad the Impaler and
    in Bulgaria by
    Crazy Eddie BeerSon)."
    
     Will this satisfy the Turk after hours of filing habeas corpii and
    motions to suppress? Jeanne knows, but she ain't tellin'.
    
    She continues with haiku poetry to describe more Balkan issues:
    I feel excessively bored
    By the ramblings of the Dark Lord
    BirSauron
    Inside his castle high
    He queries the Russian
    "Why?
    Why do you hit me, after all I propose
    Offers so vague you can't see your nose?
    I never reveal my true self
    (I'm such a mischieveous little elf!)
    And still you refuse to listen..."
    
    ...And the treetops now glisten
    I see red blood from red blocks
    Burnt Vienna pastries
    Says Jeanne:  "Expect less than four
    I can see three from from here in TRI
    This is the end...the end, my friend"  ((oops, sorry, that's Jim
    Morrison))
    
    Ms Dixon, having analyzed the Balkans, turned her gaze to the North.  She
    opines:
    In the North, I feel tension.  The old adage, "Pitt, or get off the pot,"
    is coming to fruition.   A black shadow over central Europe hangs like a
    bad temperature inversion.  However, winds of change are blowing from
    within.  The winds blow contrary to each other, creating a tempest.
    First they offer warmth and stability to white clouds (or are they
    blocks?) in the north, and then the winds grow cold, bringing thunder and
    rain. Yet in the center of the storm, units sit placidly, ignoring other,
    eastern, gales brewing.
    Are we witnessing a bell-weather shift in the North and the center?
    Jeanne says:  No way.  Our forecast calls for continued hot air, lots of
    stagnation, and above-average chatter about how wonderful it would be to
    see Eng and Rus stay in the game and help versus the east.   And then it
    will rain again.  ((Jeanne thinks she sees Willard Scott in a yellow
    slicker, somewhere near Berlin, but she can't be too sure; too much
    cloudiness up north.))
    
    In the West, Jeanne sees resignation on the faces of the Italians, for
    they sense that their Russian jockstrap (the "24-hour support piece") has
    finally lost most of  its elasticity.  And Jeanne mutters something about
    "foxes in henhouses" when she stares over the horizon, beyond Italy to
    the West.  Russia can only assume her intent.
    
    Tsar Faz, having thanked Jeanne Dixon (and then arming her and sending
    her to the trenches) concluded with these words -- quite possibly his
    last printed material:
    
    Russians!  Stay true to the cause. Despite some bungling among our
    staffs, we remained true to our friends, and tenacious against our foes.
    The same Riders of the Purple Sage who criticize our moves now feel
    themselves losing some power, unsure if and when it will return.  Others
    will grow  greedier and clash with their fellow vultures.   Russia will
    continue to aid its friends until the bitter end, and then beyond the
    grave.  You may kill the body, but never the spirit.
    
     Rasputin!  Bring me those voodoo dolls of the players; let's give them
    some MORE backaches and broken hands.  Stab Tsar Faz, will they (jab)?!
    Ha!  Ya-ha!  (jab, jab)  Take that, swineherds!   cackle,
    chortle...((double-jab on Hohn's shrugging shoulders))...saliva begins to
    drool down the Tsar's chin as he maniaically jabs the dolls...
    
    We now return you to your regularly-scheduled programming.
    
    Tsar Faz sends regards to the gamers and the observers over this fine
    weekend!

    >Geez, Pitt. You'd rather have France in Edinburgh and Russia owning Norway,
    >than *you* owning Norway and me owning Edinburgh?
    
    Never let it be said that I was afraid to change my mind...
    
    FWIW, I regret having to do what I did but, if you care to know, my
    reasoning was as follows:
    
    - your professed desire to hold NOR and STP as part of the northern edge of
    the stalemate line
    - the fact that my fleet would be in STP without any supporting units
    - the fact that you'd be in NOR and Turkey in MOS
    - the conclusion that STP gets dislodged this year
    
    Even if that were not already a plan between you and Turkey, I didn't see
    how either of you could miss it this year.  And, given our checkered past
    in this game, I sort of assumed that you wouldn't feel any particular
    loyalty to me that would prevent you from jumping on the opportunity if
    presented.
    
    So, I did what I felt was necessary, even though it allows Russia to
    survive a bit longer, too.
    
    No hard feelings, I hope.

    This sounds accceptable.  If you agree, I can probably have that
    fleet in Ionian popped this Spring turn.  More on this in a bit...

    Agreed.  In fact, we should start propagandizing both Pitt AND John
    right after this next turn; Pitt we try to sell on the idea of
    taking out France so as to get a three way result without a lot
    of hassle.  He's an e-mail player at heart, so I bet he goes for it.
    With John, we try to plant the seeds of distrust and make it appear
    to him that I cannot be attacked.  Once you attack Edi, I'll tell
    him that he and I have a golden opportunity to take both Pitt and
    you out.  Combine that with a strong effort on my part to look
    invulnerable and we may talk him into attacking Pitt.  Then you and
    I can make a push west.  (Um, heh heh, note that my telling John
    it's a perfect time to attack YOU will definitely be propaganda;
    as I said, I don't trust him for the reasons I outlined in my last
    note.  There's something about an honest Dip player I can't deal
    with... laff)

    Thanks for the compliment, although I think my blind luck has made
    up for some bad strategic choices this game.
    
    I agree with you that a normal demo game will probably end in a
    three-way.  Too much talent (read cut-throatedness) to play to a
    perfect 7-way Calhamerian draw, but also too much awareness of
    what's going on on the board to let one power get a large lead.
    
    In THIS game though, I see no reason to not try to buck the odds.
    IF we can get F/G fighting or at least suspicious of each other,
    we can at least try for a two-way.  If there's going to be a
    three-way, let's at least make sure it's a true stalemated draw,
    okay?

    Basically, what I've outlined above probably offers us the best
    bet for taking either/both F/G out of the final results.  Just a
    thought: I'd prefer to see an "all postal player" victory... :)

    I will build that army and that will probably be the last one I
    build (unless one is need for a possible French campaign, at which

    M. Jean,
    
    Just to let you know, Italy asked me to keep the F Eng and sail it into the
    MAO, to try to take Portugal. Austria agreed on independent grounds that
    this would be my best approach.
    I don't suppose this will affect your plans much, but it might, somehow.

    Gentile men,
    
    France has already 'nabbed' Edi, Tsar Faz. No doubt you meant London.
    
    To all appearances Germany wants to make it FG vs AT, with Italy casting
    swing votes.
    
    If that's the way it wrings out, then, well, au revoir.
    
    M. Jean, what if the Sultan really does stab into Austria this year? Would
    that give you enough incentive to be the aggressor in an F vs G conflict?
    My idea is that you'd let Italy and Turkey together remove Austria, and
    then Turkey would have nowhere to go but into the Mediterranean, assuring
    you a long period in which you could focus on the north. In that case, you
    would want to strike first to get the upper hand.

    While (obviously) less-than-thrilled over your continued screw-over of
    my position, I'm hoping that you see the obvious weakening of your
    front-positioned ally.  Edi's removal of WAR, coupled with your build of
    CON, offers interesting possibilities.  And, played right (as you've
    been doing to date), you may even convince France of the possibilities
    of stabbing Italy (or you and France hitting Germany later).
    
    I'm standing by Italy, which means against AT.  Germany will take my
    last center, so this will indeed be my last fling.
    
    Good hunting.  I hope you realize that CON is better off in the Balkans,
    vice a useless attempt at convoying to APU.

    >Pitt, I am very interested in your thinking on the coming year.  I would
    >like to hear from you before the build deadline.
    
    Sorry I didn't get back to you before the builds processed, John, but I
    thought I had more time.
    
    In any event, I'm building A BER, both as protection against Russian A BOH
    (which I assume is the one he'll keep) and as a precursosr to a
    southern/eastern push.  Having said that, though, I'd like to keep that
    plan under wraps as long as possible.  At present, I am trying to develop a
    relationship with Turkey (witness his support for me into STP) so that I
    can convince him to help take out Austria.  I am still some way away from
    broaching that topic, however, as he appears to be wholly committed to
    Austria at this point.
    
    So, to whatever extent possible, I'd like to continue our plan in the north
    (finishing off England and Russia) and remain neutral or even slightly
    pro-AT in the east/south.  That doesn't, of course, mean that you have to
    be pro-AT.  In fact, it might work to our benefit if we appeared to be
    having some disagreement about that area.  The more confusion we can sow in
    that area, the better.
    
    Please let me know what you think.

    Congrats again on gaining Vie.  Edi's press to me has "mysteriously"
    fallen silent (cackle).  Well, he started it...
    
    Do you still require support for Vie?  if not, I'm heading east, into
    the sun.  I have two turns to get GAL and threaten AT even now.  (FG are
    too tight for any western options, and I can't retake any northern

    I had begun to have second thoughts about A Mar myself.  I think it is wise
    to leave it in France, as you have suggested.
    
    I will order Tys-Ion.
    
    I would think AT was starting to crack about now.  The Sultan must realize
    that with France helping Italy, he has only one ready source of new
    centers: Austria.  If I were Turkey, I'd be begging Italy to help me take
    out Austria.  But I don't know how Hohn plays it.

    I agree.  I think A/T is too strongly allied for us to let our guard
    down and
    that your erstwhile buddy, Germany, is really in cahoots with them.
    Only
    our good tactical position has prevented him from moving on us (well,
    that
    and the fact he wants to finish off Russia...).  If we seperate, we're
    toast.

    I think we should make an effort to get the Ionian back this turn, so
    how
    about I support your F Tyn-Ion?  I don't have my board set up at the
    moment,
    but I believe this should force the Ionian (Edi's fleet in Albania is
    likely to be involved elsewhere).
    
    As for your army in Marseilles, I don't think you need to move to
    Piedmont.
    Now that I've built the army in Rome, we're well supplied unit-wise in
    the
    area.  I'm also, as I said above, concerned about Germany's intentions
    and
    I'd like to see you have units in reserve for any eventuality.
    I can see us being in a position shortly to think about a possible
    attack
    in his direction.  While A/T haven't been beaten yet, we DO have the
    momentum.  If we're willing to attack Germany and pick the proper
    moment,
    we may yet do much more than prosper, we may even finish in the money.
    I'd like to know your feelings on this.

    Since Hohn checks in with me only sporadically, I will wait to see whether
    he mentions anything about the topic and give him the "France shows no
    interest" line only then. I prefer not to lie to him if it's avoidable.
    
    I'm guessing you'll be hearing a lot from Edi this turn, quite possibly a
    phone call even.

    I think he will be quiet, but I have reminded him gently. I think he'll
    have some urge to mention it to Cal. This would be bad, as you say. A
    little thought will reveal to Faz that he has no chance to survive the move
    if Germany knows what's coming, so a reminder ought to do it.
    
    And as you say too, after this move there will be no secret left, so that's
    all right.

    Your personal philosophy appears to be the perfect one for this game, at
    any rate. I misjudged the various characters rather badly, myself. But I
    kind of like the way things are headed now. For one thing, it is a pleasure
    to see Edi Birsan so befuddled -- it makes me feel a lot better about my
    own errors! For another, well, never mind, there's no point in debriefing
    now.

    Re stabbing Edi, I think Hohn will make that decision based on what he
    thinks Germany will do.  Germany will help him if he thinks France is his
    friend.  I will do nothing to make Germany think otherwise.  Actually, I
    think if you talk to Turkey about hitting Austria, you should also tell
    Turkey that you have had no luck getting France to turn against Germany.
    Therefore, Turkey will believe, Germany is free to join the attack on
    Austria.  Other than that, I have no immediate interest in the situation.
    
    Why did I take this decision?  The time is ripe.  Pitt had no choice but to
    stay on my good side up to now.  Things changed, and besides, I think we
    have an excellent opportunity.
    
    If the word slips out, the plan is sunk.  I think we all see that, and also
    I think the best bet for ER is to go with this.  So I think we can count on
    Faz's sealed lips for one turn.  After that, who knows?  But then the story
    will be told.
    
    If this does not work, I'm out, you are out, Russia is out.  So, we hang
    together or we hang separately.
    
    My personal philosophy is that no guarantee is better than necessity.  Even
    that does not always work, though.

    NOW THAT'S THE STUFF!  As TR would say, "Bully!  Bully!"
    All Russia salutes you for your stance.  I also appreciate supporting me
    to Mun, vice yourself.  (there is always the chance that Edi would hit
    Boh from Gal, however remote, and at least this way we circumvent that
    danger, as well as keep me alive...always a nice feeling).
    
    Of course, if Germany smells a rat and defends MUN, this is all moot,
    because France would need an A Ruh to ensure my success.  But let's give
    it a try.  It won't hurt.
    
    How ironic.  The best cooperation I have to date with E and F comes when
    I'm near death and practically negligble in influence.  Ah, this wacky

    Frankly, I don't trust Faz much, though I certainly think he'll carry
    through with Boh-Mun. But I guess I'll tend to write to you separately most
    of the time.
    
    I have a couple of things.
    
    First, do you want me to talk to Hohn about stabbing Edi? Hohn is a bit on
    edge right now, I think. He is very cross at Pitt (Pitt promised last move
    to help eliminate Russia and also to prop me up a bit), but on the other
    hand it's beginning to look like he doesn't have much of a future with
    Austria. I will not, of course, say anything about your plan unless you say
    so. I should add that I have been on good terms with him for the whole
    game. Too bad it's been of no use to me! But I'd be glad to 'cash in' now,
    if it suits you.
    
    Second:
    
    >Well, since you put it that way, how can I refuse?
    
    Uh.
    Seriously, what's changed your mind? Just that the time seems ripe?
    
    
    >I don't like all those German fleets in the north.  What possible use could
    >they have?
    
    Right. Is *that* it? But they've been there for a year.
    
    When he built that last fleet, it suddenly looked unlikely that he planned
    to go with you to the end. I don't know, *maybe* his idea is to have those
    fleets up there for the very ending, and use them after the two of you
    control 24 centers, or something. Edi sent me a note after that fleet
    build, certain that it meant Germany was going for a win and not a big
    balanced four-way ending. (Edi also predicted that Germany would build A
    Kiel this winter, though.)

    No, it will be fun for me, definitely. There's nothing like attacking the

    >FRA:
    >Wales-Channel
    >Bre-Pic
    >Par-Bur (Mar S)
    >Tyo S (Rus) Boh-Mun
    
    And Edi-Nth, of course.
    France should consider instead Par S Mar-Bur. The reason is that it leaves
    the behind-the-lines army in Paris, where it can move to Picardy and be
    more useful than an A Mar. (Just look ahead two seasons to see why.) We
    assume, I suppose, that there is no imminent danger from Italy.
    
    
    >RUS:
    >Boh-Mun
    >
    >ENG:
    >Nth-Bel, or to HEL (*that* place again!!)
    
    Yeah, I'd go to HEL (I feel I'm destined....) Nth-Bel is silly, it's a real
    long shot and we want to advance the French F Edi to Nth before Germany can
    set up two fleets against North Sea.
    
    I do think that ambushing BEL is obviously the way to go (assuming France
    embarks on a German campaign, I mean). The real key in the longer run is to
    have France's fleets in a good position, though (counting mine as one of
    the French ones). There is something to be said for supporting the French A
    Tyo into Munich instead, because the resulting position is better (A Boh, A
    Mun is better against Germany than A Tyo, A Mun); but in this case that
    would mean Russia leaves the game. I guess even for France it is better to
    maintain that Russian army, rather than to construct new ones and have to
    force them through the bottleneck.
    
    This line still leaves Germany with seven centers; France ends with eight.
    But it maintains both the Russian army and the English fleet, and Germany
    is seriously outgunned and to some extent outflanked.
    
    My assessment overall is that France has clear superiority but needs about
    four years to reduce Germany to harmlessness. Does France have four years
    without worrying about a new enemy in the Mediterranean? I suspect so.
    Italy is deeply entrenched enough that it will take ages for the combined
    A/T to dig him out, and even then there's plenty of room for AT conflict.
    If Sultan Hohn switches sides right away, I guess Austria dies sooner than
    Italy would, but then it is hard to see what Hohn could do but attack Italy.
    
    The big plus is that France is a lot closer than is usual to cracking the
    southern stalemate line. Interesting endgame, it would be.
    
    If France waits, the only chances seem to be (a) to get so many
    Mediterranean centers that no Germanic ones are needed, or (b) that some
    one of the southerners turns into a big land power and threatens Germany
    (at the moment this seems extremely unlikely!). The problem with the
    obvious natural pathways from here is that Germany is unable to move units
    away from the French area of interest, even if he allies in good faith.
    
    Of course, if Germany really moves west, everything's different. But in
    that event France wants the Anglorussian microforces anyway, so I am
    assuming, arguendo, that Germany will head into Austria.
    Now that I look at it, a likely scenario is that Germany plays a waiting
    move with most units, taking Norway (as Faz says), holding in Hol, Bel, and
    Mun, and ordering Ber-Sil. I wonder. That move looks insufficiently
    aggressive against AT. It might signal an impending anti-French strategy
    after all.
    
    
    I believe that Faz and I subconsciously feel that what is important is not
    the number of units one has, but the arithmetic product of lines of press
    times number of units.

    Pitt,
    
    My little broadcast has already drawn some interest.  As I suspected,
    although any reasonable person would dismiss such public bleating as
    blatant misdirection, people still tend to believe what they see, or
    perhaps what they want to see.
    
    I might spread a rumor or two as well, but I don't want to interfere with
    anything you are developing.  I'd appreciate some general ideas on what to
    avoid instigating out there.
    
    Anyway, I was wondering how we should play the coming turn.  I have
    promised Italy continued support, but he did not request anything of A
    Tyrolia.  Thus, it's free if you have a use for it.
    
    I wish that blasted English fleet would go away.  I am thinking of letting
    him move to London in Spring, moving my fleet to Nth, then knocking him out
    in the Fall.
    
    Best,

    King Jean/Nappy IV:
    
    Well, ASSUMING you're not just trying to sucker us into divulging our
    plans and then hosing us in conjunction with the Hun (and, for the
    record, I do *not* think that), here's my idea...
    
    FRA:
    Wales-Channel
    Bre-Pic
    Par-Bur (Mar S)
    Tyo S (Rus) Boh-Mun
    
    RUS:
    Boh-Mun
    
    ENG:
    Nth-Bel, or to HEL (*that* place again!!)
    
    RATIONALE:  If Germany suspects nothing, then MUN is ours, as is BEL
    next turn (assuming E/F cooperation).  England in HEL forces germany to
    tie down DEN, HOL and/or BEL in trying to outguess Jamie, as well as
    providing support/support cutting for French actions along the Low
    Country.
    
    I would prefer to see Eng in Nwy, but I have a hunch Pitt will just
    support Ska-Nwy with Swe.  HEL and the attack on MUN force Pitt to
    immediately hunker down (if he smells a rat), or catches him unawares
    and potentially losing two (MUN and BEL) (assuming a perfect French move
    that gains PIC and BUR, of course).
    Failing that, the French F Ech supports the PIC move next turn, or
    ensures the collapse of BEL once John gets BUR.
    
    Everything depends on Pitt's suspicions, or lack thereof.  I've already
    written to Turkey and asked him to stab Edi now, as I'm 'committed to
    Italy until the turn I die."  He should believe that, if my past track
    record is correct.  (The "jeanne dixon assessment" was press that was
    also designed to show suspicion of F/G as well as AT, and thus lull Pitt
    and Edi as to my true intentions.)
    
    Without being forward, may I assume that IF this goes over well, the
    survival of E/R is assumed, and at least one center will be
    supported/spared by the munificent benevolence of Napoleon IV?    I
    mean, we've already begun building these beautiful statues in your
    honor.  It'd be a shame to tear them down now....
    
    NOTE:  These are the tunnel-vision moves that I see from BOH.  Doubtless
    Jamie has better ones for his own situation....but if we're going to
    strike, NOW is the time.  Fall has already ceded the initiative to Pitt.

    With great concern, the French Foreign Ministry hears rumors of the
    Kaiser's conspiracies with the Sultan.  Could, as it has been claimed, the
    Sultan really have ordered support for Germany's capture of St Petersburg
    "by mistake?"  Is this conceivable?  Do the ambassadors to the French
    capital imagine that our Foreign Minister has fallen off the truffle cart
    only yesterday?  The Foreign Minister, it is reported, said to this
    transparent deception, "I wave my privates in your general direction!"
    
    France pleads with Germany to stay the course.  The Sultan is not to be
    trusted.  His favoritism for Bir-Sauron, the failing monarch of the
    Ostreich, knows no rational bounds.  German aid and comfort to the heretics
    in Anatolia can mean only one thing: Austria and Turkiye will rule Europe

    Very kind of you, witch, but the offer had no effect whatever on my decision.
    
    :-)
    
    Good luck and all, but I'm afraid you can't help me anymore.
    
    Well, actually....
    
    
    Is there *any* chance you might decide that this is the right time to stab
    Austria? If, for instance, France were deciding whether to stab Germany now
    and could be influenced by your choice?
    
    Do you want to hear more about this option, or should I save my breath?

    Gentle Monarchs
    
    Good morning!  I trust your Memorial Day holiday was a good one?
    Before I launch into scheduling 60 helpless VIPs with transportation
    plans for our Departmental Conference, I wanted to do a post-build
    commentary...
    
    Builds.  I expected the German A Ber, both as a preventative to the
    east, and as a guard dog for the West.  John, while you mentioned your
    support would be conditional (based on Pitt's build), please note the
    other action:  Edi's removal of A War.  Here we see the optimum unit(s)
    that COULD HAVE attacked Pitt (Mos & War), and now it's gone....poof.
    How coincidental.
    
     Hohn's build, coupled with Edi's removal, could indicate the beginning
    of the long-awaited Turkish stab of Austria.  If so, however, he'll do
    it with Pitt's help -- or at least benevolent neutrality.  If the
    former, then Pitt may go east and help kill Edi.  if the latter, he'll
    futz in the West and go for one more sure build (Nwy) and then review
    his options.
    
    On the flip side, though, if I were AT and I saw the board congealing
    along recognizeable stalemate lines, I too would 'fake the stab" and
    encourage the rest of the board to do likewise, in the hopes of pulling
    a fast one and regaining the momentum.  A CON is aimed not just at BUL
    and the Balkans, but also to convoy to Italy!
    
    I pose two questions:
    1) If Pitt doesn't go east with Ber and Mun, what IS he doing with them?
     Do you think he'll go Ber-Sil now?
    2) Assuming you don't stab Italy (and things could change in that regard
    *if* there's an AT rift, I realize), then where do you gain, as opposed
    to Germany?  Sure, you'll nab Edi someday, but Pitt gains Nwy, and HE's
    got the entire East for gains, as opposed to your constrained front.
    And, more ominously, he's got the entire WEST to try for, if he's in bed
    with either (or both) A and T.
    
    I merely reiterate my desire for joint action now, to strangle the baby
    in its crib, before it grows to unmanageable proportions.  I realize
    France has its own course to plot, but we'd like to actively help, lest
    La Belle France get the same "love treatment" given to R and E....

    Yeah, I guess I've been pretty lax at writing those things, but I hate
    writing about stuff with so many variables.  You either have to include
    EVERYTHING or look like you're missing something.  Oh well...
    
    Just for the record, I agree with Hohn that a good, well-played game at
    this level SHOULD end in a 3-way.  That doesn't mean I have any
    intention of accepting that kind of result (I'm a win only player when I
    can be).  Sooo, if Hohn follows through with his stab of Edi, I'll look
    to find a way to make France back off.  If I can do THAT, I expect to be
    in a position to ensure a place in a draw.  Once (and if) I manage
    THAT,  I'll look around for a way to win.  If I find it, I'll try it
    even if it costs me a shot at that draw.  We'll see...

    I haven't heard from him either, but I bet he's working furiously on the
    REST of the board...

    I haven't looked at the board closely yet and I'm waiting for some
    replies, but I'll let you know what's up.  I'd love to get you a centre
    and keep you going for a while. I figure you've played a better game
    than England so you should outlast him...
    
    Ciao 4 now

    I think that's wise as it leaves our options open.

    Okay.

    I got a note from him implying that he is ready to strike a deal.  I
    told
    him that I have to see some real moves against Edi first.  We do have
    the
    luxury of waiting for him to move as we're definitely in the driver seat
    as
    regards the Med.

    Didn't get that minute, eh?  grin  Oh well, let me know what you think.

    I think I neglected to answer your question about the long-term.  I do see
    it much as you do.  Although my fear of a German attack is now lower than
    it was, I still think that FI must remain solid, or we both go down.  With
    a little luck, we could prosper.
    
    I need to know what to do with Tyr and Tys.  I also think that, with A Par
    in place and Germany's build in Berlin, I can afford to move Mar-Pie.  If
    we make any headway,  I'd like to be able to move Pie-Tyr, after Tyr goes
    who knows where (maybe to Bohemia).
    
    Let's go get 'em.

    Pitt,
    It might have seemed that my build was obvious because I had no choice, but
    I strongly considered waiving the build.  My purpose would have been both
    to ensure that you face no threat to the west (you still don't but now it's
    my good will alone rather than that and the disposition of the units on the
    board), and to build a fleet next year.  When I did not hear from you, and
    what with all the lies these other players spread, I got a bit nervous, so
    went ahead with A Paris.
    
    Now the question is how we can put it to use.  I suppose I could hold and
    wait for something to develop.
    
    
    Well, I hope this is the worst problem we face.
    
    John
