    I shall prepare my faith for some leaping.
    
    I have been known to take a little jump now and then. But don't stretch my
    poor powers. I am not able to leap tall buildings in a single bound.
    
    Now I know that every signon delays the processing of the moves, and
    probably some of our cohorts are holding their breaths, so I'll shut up and
    wait for the results.
    
    Cheers!

    Now, witch.
    
    If I'm not mistaken, you have to face the question of whether you actually
    *want* to be the leading power in your area, or not. A delicate question in
    a game like this one! To be the leading power, you'd need only to switch
    sides and grab for the remaining Balkan centers. Or so it seems to me. To
    play it slower and lower key, you'd just manouever to destroy that Russian
    fleet and wait and see what develops between Italy and Austria. I'll be
    watching with a fascinated eye.
    
    Here is one little bit of information of which I am pretty certain (I don't
    like to overstate my certainty, but I'd be really shocked if this were
    wrong). When push comes to shove, either Russia or Italy would take
    practically any opportunity to reduce the chance that Austria will be a big
    power in the endgame. Not to say that they wouldn't join forces with him to
    avoid elimination, but short of that I think you could count on Italy not
    to make any common cause with Austria, and likewise on Russia.
    
    I don't know how that fact might affect your plans. I guess it could
    influence in various ways. I still have this feeling, though, that *IF* (a
    big if) I can manage to be around for a few more years, anything that's
    heathy for you will be to my advantage. So I give you what information I
    have, to do with as you will.
    
    Cheers!
    Gentle King Jamie,
    the Other Witch

    Because I replied to those as I read them, without thinking (wasn't it
    obvious?).  Though I'm not sure it does me much good, I like to give the
    real game related stuff some thought before replying.  Often, I don't have
    sufficient time to do that upon first glance.
    
    FYI, I've been giving your ideas a good deal of thought and I'm inclined to
    go with them.  Look for a detailed plan for a surprise EG turnabout in my
    next message.  Fair warning, though, it's going to require a serious leap
    of faith on your part.

    In a phone discussion with a player, it was brought up that the player felt
    that the rules prohibit diplomacy during the build/adjustment phase and was a
    little awkward about discussing the coming adjustments.  As this is from a
    long time E-mailer I was very curious about this attitude.
    
    The no diplomacy during builds has as its origin the face to face game, but
    was never even an issue in postal play.  some postal games had a combined
    season of Fall and winter or of winter and Spring more for the issue of
    speeding up the game than from any rules approach to the issue.
    
    I am very curious, as this is my first e-mail game of regular Diplomacy, what
    the social edicate is on the issue.
    
    Comments please from the observors/masters etc on the issue.

    The way I see MY  moves this Spring, I'll probably convoy into Albania.
    Whether I support it or try to attack Trieste is something I'll decide
    AFTER I talk to Mark (and even Edi).
    
    Assuming you are in Con & Bla with fleets and Rum with an army, as well
    as the (hopeful) success of my moves, we can conceivably put supported
    pressure on Tri, Bul, Gre and maybe even Serbia.  What's your take
    on these tactics?
    
    For the long run, I can see myself having to turn back to face the
    French.  I can see you having/wanting to proceed further north to
    (continue to) attack Russia.  I have no problem with this as I've
    concluded that you make a better long term ally than Mark (we may
    want to see if he'll puppet to us as the ability to build in Stp
    may be vital later).
    
    I'm anxious to hear what the ideas were you mentioned.  I'm sure we
    can come to an agreement on this.
    
    Regards

    Please don't take this wrong as I do expect us to be able to work closer
    later in the game, but I REALLY don't feel secure enough in my position
    to want a French fleet in the Med.  Let's just abide by our agreement
    that
    your fleet will go to Spain and then to the Mid.  Any other moves will
    mean that I will be forced to defend myself.

    ** Part of this is directly related to who's helping down south.  If I'm
    Custer, I could use you there with support before I reach the Little Big
    Horn.  Even taking SEV buys me 1-2 turns, max.  they can surround and
    retake it in fall, no doubt.  Extra pressure is needed.
    
    I understand this but, frankly, I'm not comfortable letting England off the
    hook that easy.  If I turn now and head towards Austria, one of two things
    is likley to happen.  A) France gobbles up England with me seeing little or
    no gain and leaving me with a looming western neighbor or B) England
    convinces France to join with him against me.  Either option is bad for me.
     The only way I can prevent either is to keep up the offensive against
    England, grab my share of his SC's, and make sure that I'm an unattractive
    target for France.
    
    >As for France being all alone, I'm not completely following.  Are you

    Yes, the latter.  He's shown no signs of that, as yet, but I don't want to
    invite trouble, either.  Also, I'm sur ehe hasn't forgottne that myu
    opening move was anti-French.

    I understand your concern.  However, my purpose is not to set you up for a
    German stab.  I stand to gain very little from doing that, for starters.
    If I were to stab you, who stands to gain the most?  Not me but, rather,
    Austria.  Now, if it were Turkey that stood to see the gain, I suppose that
    I might have some incentive to consider that option but I'd be crazy to
    give Edi any more advantage than he already has.  I'm already exposed to
    him.  I need your presence in the east and south to hold him in check.
    
    If I could, I'd do more to come directly to your aid right now but I just
    don't see how I can until I resolve the situation in the west.  *That's*
    why I suggested the moves in the north that I did.  I don't think England
    can afford to dislodge my NTH fleet given my options to retreat to LON or
    EDI if he does but, _if_ he does, your fleet in NWG would give us much
    greater options for response in the fall.  Ideally, of course, my convoy
    succeeds in the spring and your NOR-NWG move does, too.
    
    I don't really know what else to say.  I *need* your support, both in the
    north and as a bulwark in the east and south.  If you continue to give a
    good accounting in the south and we are successful together in the north, I
    will be in position to relieve the pressure on you by going after Austria
    next year.  I know you'd like to see something sooner but I don't see any
    way to do that.  I am committed to doing what I can, however.
    
    I look forward to hearing back from you.

    The deadline is relevant here as people should not be holding up the
    build or retreat deadlines in order to conduct diplomacy; however,
    not conducting it at all doesn't make sense to me.  I have the
    same view on this that Edi does.
    
    > I am very curious, as this is my first e-mail game of regular Diplomacy, what

    >
    Perhaps (since my judge playing experience is not extensive) I share
    Edi's postal view but that is out of step with the majority of you
    Judge players.  I also stand to be educated on this issue.
    
    > Comments please from the observors/masters etc on the issue.
    >
    > Edi
    >
    On a related issue that I have been thinking about.....
    
    my view in general is that rules that are impossible to enforce as
    a GM should be avoided.  During the great "house rules" debates on
    the Judge world a few years ago, at times I realize that I stood
    outside the majority on these kinds of issues.  Edi making the
    phone call he refers to above represents an example of what I would
    call an "unenforceable rule".  If the two players on the phone
    wanted to communicate, there would be no reason for them to reveal
    their contact (if there were a rule against negotiation during
    build phases) and no way for me to find out.  E-Mail outside the
    Judge is similar in effect.
    
    This issue in general colored my approach to the question of negotiating
    during the grace period after the deadline recently.  I also don't
    believe in prohibiting that for similar reasons; HOWEVER, if the player
    or players who are late want to negotiate during the grace period,
    I have asked them to make reasonable requests to me to extend the
    deadline.  I am aware of the possibility of trying to "manipulate"
    me and that sort of situation and will make a judgment based on
    my view of reasonableness.  Again, in my view, there is no restriction
    at all on people who have orders in already to negotiate during the
    grace period.
    
    In my view, these sorts of discussions are good so that they can sort
    out where I am coming from as well as what your views are.  As always,
    I also caution the players that to some extent all things are within
    the game, whatever you wish to see that as meaning.

    Hey, this game wouldn't have anywhere near the interest for me or many
    others if those differences in views weren't there.  I am not shy about
    saying that allowing those differences to intersect over the game
    board is fascinating to me.

    Just a quick note before I dash off to work:
    
    I have no problem with your dislodging the Black Sea fleet; in fact,
    I rather figured you'd want to remove that threat to your shores.
    
    I'll write a more detailed note this evening about how we can coordinate
    an attack on Edi.  I'm quite glad you're reasonably amenable to this
    offer as I feel we can take him down quite quickly.  I also feel Mark
    will at least help me with his Galician (or Bohemian army) even if you
    press an attack on him (he wants some measure of revenge on Edi...)
    
    Take to you later.

    Jim,
    
    My thoughts after the Fall 1902 moves.
    
    Hooray!
    
    Edi came through, as I suspected he would, and my rather elaborate
    stratagem with Mark also worked.  I'm as pleased as punch right now.
    
    BLA will now be mine, and although I might lose SEV, I suspect I
    should be able to take it back in Fall 1903.  I will likely continue
    to work with Edi, simply because I find him to be one of the only
    reliable people in my area.  Mark is simply untrustworthy, and his
    recent letter to me suggesting a cooperative set of moves that would
    require trust on both of our parts is another example.  Cal seems a
    bit erratic, and although it's true that IT is generally pretty good
    for the Turkish player, AT is even better for the Turk.  So in light
    of all that, I think I'll stay with Edi.
    
    Strategically, I think there's only a low chance of a stab by Edi
    against me, which is further reason to go with him.  If he turns on me
    now, he risks alienating his only ally while his other neighbors are
    hostile, and it also exposes his back to a rapidly growing Pitt.
    
    I'm going to return to the moral high ground position of honesty with
    Mark, in the hopes that I can salvage my relationship with him.  It's
    true, being in the driver's seat helps with respect to that position
    with him, but I'm still hoping he appreciates the honesty.
    
    In other notes, I just sent out a spate of messages.  You'll note I
    also sent out a public broadcast.  This is for a definite tactical
    reason.  Whenever I send several private messages at about the same
    time, I almost always also send out a public broadcast.  This is
    because any note passers will not be able to cross-reference my time
    stamps of passed messages with messages that they themselves received,
    because my public note gives notice to all that I was online at that
    time, and thus any note passers could have simply copied the time
    stamp of that particular broadcast.  Without the public broadcast,
    note passers would have increased credibility due to the coincidence
    in timing of private messages.

    Mark,
    
    Although I appreciate your cooperative suggestions, I'm afraid that
    they are not truly feasible in light of our mutual lack of trust.  I
    can't trust you to do what you've suggested, and you can't trust me to
    do as you suggest either, I believe.  Indeed, although the
    coordination you propose would be great if it all went through, it
    could again screw one or both of us in the event of a stab.  Thus, I'm
    afraid I'm going to have to dislodge you from BLA and then we can work
    from there accordingly.
    
    I'm sorry if I seem inflexible.  It's just that I can't trust you in
    BLA.  I hope you realize that I could have lied to you again, agreed
    to everything you said (perhaps a bit reluctantly to prevent you from
    thinking I gave in too easily), and then stabbed you to try to get
    further gain at your expense.  But I don't want to further poison our
    relationship with lies, and I do truly believe we can work
    together...but only _after_ our mutual security is seen to.
    
    Please let me know your thoughts.

    Edi,
    
    Boy, Cal and Mark sure seem to want to axe you.  Badly.
    
    I'm playing along to an extent, although I've told Mark that
    I simply have to dislodge him from Black Sea.  There's no
    other feasible alternative in my mind.  Hopefully, I'll have
    some idea what they're going to try, so that we can adjust
    accordingly.  You might want to play dumb with them about
    our continuing cooperation, so that they're more amenable to
    feeding me reliable info.
    
    But rest assured, I'm still with you 100%.  You're the only
    one of them that's reliable, and I think and hope you feel
    the same about me.
    
    Regarding tactics, I'm blowing him out of Black, that's the

    Cal,
    
    Thanks for your letter.  I also thank you for not moving to AEG or
    EAS.  In any event, I do feel compelled to let you know that I have to
    dislodge BLA this turn.  I'm not ruling out cooperation with Mark, but
    in light of his past actions towards me, having him in BLA is simply
    more of a risk than I want to take.
    
    Regarding Edi, I fully understand both the strategic desirability of
    getting him out of the way and also the tactical feasibility of action
    against him.  Before now, I needed him against Mark, who had shown no
    indication of easing up on me.  I'm in a much better position now,
    however.  I'm willing to consider a stab, although I'd like to hear
    substantive ideas with respect to coordinated moves, though.  I have
    some ideas of my own, but I'd like to hear where you're coming from.
    
    My only restriction is, as mentioned above, that I need to dislodge
    BLA.  Other than that, I'm flexible.  Please let me know.

    Actually, it's fine with me.
    The thing is, having France just be neutral with respect to me, as he more
    or less said he'd decided to be, isn't good enough. It's a slow death
    warrant. So, I'm just as happy if he has to make a different choice. Yes,
    he could choose to send troops into England. But he might choose to
    pressure Germany. That last is my only real chance in the game, so I prefer
    a situation where France at least *might* choose that one.
    
    The only thing is, he *might* decide to go to the Mediterranean anyway. I
    think that would be a bad move, but I guess it depends on his relations
    with Germany. (My best guess is that he has no real relations with Germany
    at all.)
    
    > He seemed a bit hurt that I refused, so his

    No. I'd feel the same.
    Even if he's perfectly sincere, the question would still be how he will
    feel once he decides AT is no longer a huge threat.

    Holy cow. You're worried about Pitt?
    
    Ok. My idea was just, if France is genuinely wondering what he can do to
    help IR against AT, you could tell him (truly, I hope) that keeping Germany
    from overrunning those largely unprotected Russian centers is the most
    helpful thing France could do.

    His current concern, at least as he presents it to me, is none other than

    to M. Jean that an excellent way to help the ItaloRussian cause would be for
    France to give Germany something to think about other than those juicy

    John,
    
    Well, good luck with that fleet, I guess.
    
    I hope that with your other units you will be... flexible.
    
    I do not want to attack Russia with German help (hah! I mean, help Germany
    attack Russia). I may not have much of a choice about it, though. It will
    be my last resort. I would much rather hold off Germany while someone else
    attacked him, while I gave as much assistance, admittedly limited, as I
    possibly could.

    Jamie,
    
    I don't think it's too mysterious how I might help RI.  With Italy's
    permission, a fleet in the Med would help him to hold out against AT
    incursions, maybe even make some headway, given T's build in Ankara.  Of
    course, it won't work unless Italy wants the help, and you are correct that
    he would be very wary of such assistance.   But if he were to accept it,
    then the mere fact that AT faced a real challenge in the Med would relieve
    the pressure on Russia (assuming you and G left the Tsar alone for a
    while).
    
    I do not have a clear idea of Germany's intentions.  I think that my
    position is strong enough that he won't find attacking me again attractive
    for a while, but whether finishing off England or grabbing part of Russia
    is in the cards, I don't know.  Presumably, he'd have to discuss the former
    with me quite soon.
    
    I'll check in again this evening.  Best of luck.

    John,
    
    I'm somewhat surprised that others aren't worried about the AT alliance.
    Maybe you meant Germany. I wouldn't expect him to be worried about it. I
    would be, except that I am too tied up with worrying about my survival to
    be able to spend much worry on the long term.
    
    I am, naturally, glad to hear that you won't be invading England. To be
    honest, I have just been *assuming* that you won't, not because I was so
    sure that you wouldn't, but that I figure my only chance is if you don't.
    If you were hellbent on Liverpool, there would be nothing much I could do
    about it. So I've been making what scanty plans I can make on the
    assumption that you weren't.
    
    Now.
    
    You will understand, I'm sure, that it is rather mysterious to an outsider
    like me how you might manage to help Russia and Italy. A speculator might
    wonder whether you intend to send two fleets into the Mediterranean. A
    speculator would hypothesize that Italy would not be too enthusiastic about
    that sort of help. A speculator might then wonder whether Italy would be in
    any position to refuse help like that. Well, who knows.
    
    I can think of a way you might help Russia. I'm not sure what you're
    thinking, of course. I will tell you that although I know it's quite
    possible that Germany will decide his best move is to try to finish me off,
    I think there is a pretty good chance that he's concluded that the biggest
    payoff for him right this moment is to try to reap a large share of spoils
    from the pending devastation of Russia. In fact, this is my best guess
    (though it may well be wishful thinking). I believe that the chance of
    Germany's deciding that your centers are the most promising source of
    growth, at least given the current configuration, is a rather small chance.
    (If you suddenly committed units to the Mediterranean, that might well
    change.) In sum, my personal view of *your* best bet is that you'd probably
    best be worrying about what Germany is about to do. If he's going East and
    into Scandinavia, you ought to think this is bad news (because it makes the
    AT alliance very strong indeed). If he's going west (small chance, as I
    said), that's worse news. If he's going to try to use his smallish navy to
    attack my island, that's probably best for you, though it might be pretty
    ugly for you in the long run if he succeeds.
    
    Hm, so, I don't know what to say. IF you are planning to put some pressure
    on Germany, it would be very helpful for me to know this. It would affect
    my plans. It would be helpful for me to know whether I have to gamble and
    try to do something that might fend Germany off for a longish time, or
    whether I just have to hold out for another move until he gets a new
    distraction. But, you may not feel you want to reveal your plans, I would
    naturally understand that. It depends on to what extent you feel that we're
    'in this together' now.
    
    Germany is oddly ready to negotiate with me, it seems. Maybe it's a hoax.
    And I don't exactly know what he's offering, either. Whatever it is, I'll
    be doing what I can to improve my defensive posture against him.
    Unfortunately, I am rather in the dark about your plans and Russia's (it's
    too bad that Russia is incommunicado, but that's life).
    
    A last thought about revenge.
    I find that at this level, players go for revenge only when other prospects
    look pretty grim. Yours are certainly good enough that you can have higher
    aspirations! I think that if you play your cards just right, you'll be a
    major endgame factor. Frankly, I hope you do play them just right.

    Jamie, the long and short of it is that I am concerned about the growing
    strength of the AT alliance.  If I were to think in the short term, their
    success provides me with some opportunities.  But they will gain much more
    and much faster than I would from grabbing the immediate profits.  I would
    like to help Russia and Italy hold them off.  I've contacted a couple of
    players about this, but so far I am the only one who feels this way.  The
    import for you is, of course, that I would not make an attempt on your
    homeland.  FYI, revenge rarely motivates me, and I try to play the board as
    it develops.  My reading now is that AT is the problem.

    I have always played that the game is setup with deadlines and what you do

    In a phone discussion with a player, it was brought up that the player felt
    that the rules prohibit diplomacy during the build/adjustment phase and was a
    little awkward about discussing the coming adjustments.  As this is from a
    long time E-mailer I was very curious about this attitude.
    
    The no diplomacy during builds has as its origin the face to face game, but
    was never even an issue in postal play.  some postal games had a combined
    season of Fall and winter or of winter and Spring more for the issue of
    speeding up the game than from any rules approach to the issue.
    
    I am very curious, as this is my first e-mail game of regular Diplomacy, what
    the social edicate is on the issue.
    
    Comments please from the observors/masters etc on the issue.

    Jim,
    
    I haven't decided yet whether I'll broadcast anything in response to yours
    and Edi's recent broadcast notes.
    
    If I do, you must keep in mind that 'everything is in the context of the
    game'! Everything I broadcast is. Private notes to you are extra-game
    communications, of course, with no ulterior motives.
    
    You already have my candid comments about unenforceable rules and about
    your decisions about negotiating past the deadline. I'll be more than happy
    to expand if you have any questions about my views, of course.
    
    Rick Desper gave what should be counted as the Official Judge-players's
    Position. The large majority of Judge denizens think it's perfectly ok to
    negotiate during minor phases. Rick himself is inclined to think not, but
    always goes along with the majority when he's GM-ing.

    Not at all. The large majority of Judge players, I think it's fair to say,
    also find no problem in negotiating during adjustment and retreat phases.
    (Rick's account of this is perfectly accurate, in other words.)
    
    Whoever told Edi that he was worried about it was probably lying. Maybe it
    was me. Maybe I was talking to Edi on the phone about this. Maybe Edi made
    the whole thing up. Seems most likely. Just who does he think he's fooling?

    I disagree. I would like to know just why you think so, Jim.
    
    My view is this. In a game like Ghodstoo, you can expect players to follow
    the rules laid down. So the rules will be largely self-enforcing.

    This seems entirely fair.
    I myself implore all of the players to be reasonable at all times. I mean,
    I hereby do so.
    
    
    I will always follow the rules as I understand them, always. And I have no
    doubt that other players are the same.

<p><a name=37></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=000000>Observer</font>:</b><pre>
    My feeling has always been that the rule against negotiation was designed
    to speed things up, as the rules only allow 5 minutes for builds &
    retreats.
    
    So in general, I think this rule fall under the category of "rules which
    are not applicable outside of FTF," since, after all, we don;'t enforce the
    5 minutes part, so why the no-talking part.
    
    So unless the GM prohibits it, I engage in it w/o qualm.
    
    When I GM I allow it, but I try to enforce the spirit by preventing the use
    of SET WAIT during retreat/build phases.  Since I see the intent of the
    rule to keep the game moving quickly, I think stretching out these phases
    to negotiate is poor form.
    
    Andy
    p.s. On the other hand, strictly prohibiting communication in these phases
    has some interesting unintended game-theoretic side effects.  I once saw 2
    players left with only one retreat each, to the same spot.  They were
    trying to stop me from winning by getting a defensible line.  If both
    retreated to the spot it was just as bad as if neither did.  With
    communication (which they used) it was an easy matter to resolve (heck, I
    won anyway), but w/o communication it would have been a very interestng
    Battle of the Sexes type game.
    
    p.p.s.  I think having the option to claim: "Regardless of the GMs ruling,
    *I* don;t negotiate during retreats and builds" gives a player some stab
    room if he wants it.

    Press during builds/retreats: Of course the AH rules prohibit this.
    However, I have only played in one e-mail game (a Chaos game) where
    press was actually prohibited during these phases.  The master wrote a
    program which set the NoPress flag whenever it detected a build or
    retreat phase.  Of course, there was a small window of opportunity to
    send press immediately after a phase would process, and I think the GM
    may have actually sanctioned someone for doing it once.
    
    As for press during grace periods, as I've become more experienced in
    e-mail play, I've pretty much stopped negotiating during grace periods
    unless there is a good reason, or unless it's REALLY important (in which
    case I am being a hypocrite, but oh well.)  "Good reasons" could be that I
    had publicly asked for a reasonable extensoin and the GM never
    responded, in which case I have no qualms about negotiating up to the
    point where the deadline should have been set, or if another player lost
    access for a time or had himself publicly asked for an extension without
    receiving a response.  Otherwise I am agaisnt it because there needs to
    be some point at which negotiation is over with and the game proceeds.
    
    As GM, I tell players that I "don't make a big deal out of negotiating after
    the deadline, as long as it isn't abused."  I leave this phrase deliberately
    vague and I think players get the idea that they shouldn't negotiate after
    the deadline.  I've never had a problem with players negotiating after the
    deadline as GM.
    
    My two cents.

    Re: Press during retreats/builds
    
    This subject came up during one of the Hall9* games, where I
    discovered that most emailers have been sending press during
    builds/retreats for a very long time.  This goes against my feel of
    the game, but it is the email tradition.

    I will be out of town, disconnected from the internet altogether, between

    Hi John:  England wants me to write you and try to talk you into
    attacking Germany.  The rationale is that, if Germany decides to
    waltz into the (mostly) vacant Russian centres, he may get too
    big to be stopped.
    
    Well, I've done what England asked , so my obligation is
    fulfilled.  I should mention that he has a valid point.  Have
    you given any thought to a possible attack on Pitt (before or)
    after England is toast.
    
    If you have, we should talk about it as it's something we could
    conceivably work together on.

    Oh, that's cool.  I wasn't sure based on your previous message.  I
    know Mark's proposed a unified course of action that involved me not
    dislodging him in BLA, but I've told him straight up that although I
    don't foreclose the possibility of working with him, I'm going to have
    to dislodge/destroy him in BLA.

    My take on the tactics of the situation are...well, they're completely
    muddled.  It's a big, huge mess.  I do anticipate being in CON, BLA
    and RUM, but beyond that, it's a big crapshoot.
    
    I'm glad we have the weekend so I can stew on it some more. ;)

    Thanks.  Mark has been rather...quixotic this game.
    
    But in any case, I'll be happy to work with him...so long as he's not
    the one in the driver's seat.
    
    > I'm anxious to hear what the ideas were you mentioned.  I'm sure we
    > can come to an agreement on this.
    
    My thoughts were pretty much along the same lines as yours, I'd take
    Mark out of BLA this turn and work with Edi to an extent, hopefully
    setting up an ideal stab situation in Fall.  I'd be willing to work
    with Mark so long as he wasn't directly threatening my security.
    
    I think the convoy to ALB is a good idea, although again, I'm
    concerned about your exposure to French perfidy.
    
    If worst comes to worst, and France stabs you, I think that we might
    need to work with Edi.  Then you, me and him can all try to stave off
    the FG.  I think in that situation, Edi and I will need to try to off
    Mark ASAP, since I suspect he won't be willing (or couldn't be relied
    on, anyway) to work in such a situation.
    
    Thoughts?

    Hi again Hohn,
    One more quick reply before I unplug myself and then unpack (and put the

    Mark,
    
    You're more than welcome.  I'm not sure you fully appreciate why I did
    it, though, judging from the tone of the below.  I did it because I
    want to work with you in the future.
    
    ** No, I realize there are two sides to every coin, and this shows a
    measure of goodwill for future cooperation.  Of course, both of us can
    prove (with cynical examples) how being "up front" in 1901 and 1902,
    respectively, came to pass regarding "building goodwill forthe
    future"....
    Nonetheless,  the words *are* there; whether they will ever be matched
    with actions remain to be seen.

    Inflexible?  As to this upcoming turn?  Absolutely.
    
    As for lacking in ultimate sincerity, what possible gain could I
    achieve by lying to you about me wanting to blast you out of BLA?
    
    ** Oh, I agree.   The "ultimate sincerity" allusion was a projection on
    my part, for
    post-spring moves, Hohn.
    
    > Now I'm trying to make the effort to show -- yet again -- *more*
    > sincerity, with a no-kidding "hurt Edi" gameplan (the only thing he
    tells
    > me he fears, btw).
    
    A gameplan that is too risky on both our parts, IMO.  You need to take
    me out of SEV.  I need to take you out of BLA.  That's Spring.  Fall
    is another ball of wax entirely.
    
    **iYo.  IMO, the suggested moves _would_ "take you out" of SEV and "take
    me out"  of BLA--by putting us at Edi's throat.    You just have this
    trust hang-up thing flying in a holding pattern, is all.
    Understandable, but frustrating.  (This is where you throw in another
    -shrug-, btw.)
    
    > And you yet again obfuscate and hedge.
    
    ???
    
    What is obfuscating or hedging about "I'm taking you out of BLA this
    turn."  Sounds pretty crystal clear to me.
    
    ** NOT this turn.  It's the unrealized, "Well, golly gee, after we both
    have secure borders ((and I really value a Turk fleet in Bla for MY
    security, btw)), maybe then I'll deign to discuss serious options" theme
    that
    seems to stick with me for some reason...But, as you say, this is spring,
    and you are trying to be Mr Flexible for fall....
    
    I'm willing to work with you in the future.  Believe it or not, as you
    choose.
    
    ** I'm trying VERY hard to believe it, despite the tonality my reply
    here.
    And, as you have (one of your favortie phrases) the 'gun to my head'
    tactically, I have no choice BUT to believe it.
    
    > You cite
    > 'lack of trust.'  Sure, there's a grain of that, on both sides.  I for
    > one am willing to let it die; I was last turn, and I'll do it again for
    > this turn.  Why not you?
    
    Because.  It's.  Too.  Risky.
    
    ** For.  You.   Because your trust meter is at zero.  I've already
    'waived'  my risk fear...
    
    I'm in a position to secure my border.  You are too.  We can hit Edi
    in Fall depending on how things turn out.  Why take a wildly risky
    move instead that could screw _either_ of us if the other stabs?
    
    I'm not willing to take that risk right now.  I'm sorry if that's
    being too inflexible to you.  Personally, I just think it's being
    prudent.
    
    ** OK; understood.  Violent disagreement on my part, but have it your
    way.  I think we're blowing the perfect turn to establish dominance over
    Aus and the board, but if you want Spring Prudence, then I'm merely
    shouting into the hurricane.
    
    > I mean, no offense, but I have a lot better things to do than write
    move
    > options and proposals, just to be cute and never really intend for them
    > to be implemented.  I wouldn't make this effort if I wasn't sincere,
    > Hohn.
    
    Oh come on, Mark.  You can't mean this.  Because it's demonstrably
    false.  We spent five times as much time and kilobytes of text hashing
    out the Spring 1901 moves and the BLA situation.  Despite all that
    effort, you weren't sincere.  You're not going to convince me that
    just because you offer up a detailed proposal, you're going to be
    sincere about it.
    
    **No, that part is true.  And your  kilobytes of correspondence (well,
    single binary code, anyway) in 1902 also show that words don't always
    equal deeds, I reckon...
     But there's that little move of F'02 that I tried to use as a
    demonstrative effort.  I guessif that didn't convince you, then the
    follow-up goodwill message won't, either.
    
    > And what do you think Italy's intent is?!   If he's with us, then

    > you dish out vanilla in reply.
    
    <shrug>
    **  Better watch your shoulder, Hohn; Edi and I both had back problems
    recently...I wouldn't want you to throw your shoulder out with excessive
    shrugging.
    
    Vanilla can be very satisfying, especially when coupled with the
    knowledge that you won't get heartburn from the exotic.
    
    ** Where's my heave bucket?  I'm listening to Fonzie, hanging out at
    Edi's House of Whipped Cream.
    
    Or to paraphrase another old adage, "Slow and steady wins the race."
    
    ** Well, Monty DID beat Rommel by being plodding and methodical.  And
    then there's that tortoise and hare thing....You do have history on your
    side, Hohn.

    I'm completely willing to consider serious proposals by you.  I simply
    find this one to be too risky.  And I'm telling you up front that is
    the case.  Again, would you have preferred that I _lie_ to you?  What
    _possible_ benefit could I gain by telling you the truth, except to
    try to pave the way for better relations between us in the future?
    
    ** You're absolutely right.  The problem is one that was referenced
    above,
    though.  It all comes down to trust, and the fact the each turn, one of
    us doesn't completely trust the other.  This turn I'm ready to deal, but
    you fear bad karma if one of us (I'm assuming it must be me) wouldn't
    follow through vs Edi.  But after you thrash the crap out of BLA, I'm
    supposed to just assume you're then ready to deal.  YES, it's completely
    logical.  I just have to hope that you're sincere in fall....ah, the fall
    turn(s)...
    
    > 4) Tell you what:  Edi's already said he's staying with the AT unless I
    > leave GAL.  You go ahead and do what you have to do regarding BLA; I
    > can't stop you anyway.
    
    Indeed.  And that's what I'm going to do.
    
    ** Then do it, and let's see if it dies or goes to RUM.
    
    > IF and when you ever see that RT opening vs A,
    > let me know.  Give me  a real no-kidding sign of commitment, as opposed

    It could happen as early as Fall of this year.  But I don't have a
    crystal ball, Mark, and I don't know how people are going to move this
    season.  That's the only reason I can't give you a firmer commitment:
    because I don't know how we're all going to be positioned.
    
    ** Ok, I buy that.
    
    > But the ball's in your court.  Until then, I'll just assume you're
    > locked and cocked with Edi for the duration.
    
    As you choose.
    
    ** I don't  "choose;" that's what you've already dealt me on the table
    for spring.  YOU need to reshuffle the deck come fall.  I'll be waiting
    at the table to see if you have an extra ace up your sleeve.
    
    
    See you tomorrow.  Good luck on the motion for retrial, or whatever
    Charlie Mason Jr recently filed.

    It could happen as early as Fall of this year.  But I don't have a
    crystal ball, Mark, and I don't know how people are going to move this
    season.  That's the only reason I can't give you a firmer commitment:
    because I don't know how we're all going to be positioned.

    Oh yeah, big time, but I have to either go whole hog against Edi or
    forget
    it.  I don't feel I can afford to be wishy washy at this time.
    
    I have slight reason to believe that France won't use that fleet against
    me THIS turn and (probably) not the next.  Call it a hunch from
    something
    he (and England) wrote.  Okay, it's a slim hope, but my reasons in the
    last paragraph still stand.

    Oh, I agree.  (So why'd you ask me to give my take on things?  grin)
    
    > I'm glad we have the weekend so I can stew on it some more. ;)
    
    I think our general rule of thumb for this turn is:
    
    1) I attack Austria and get as much position as I can
    2) You attack Russia while trying to get your own position to attack
    Edi.
    
    Once Fall comes, we make our move.  Presumably Edi will be paying so
    much attention to Russia and I, you can waltz in and deliver a real
    coupe de grace.

    Nope, but I have to concentrate on one thing at a time now.  Hopefully,
    if he DOES, I'll be able to get a build or two to repulse him with.
    Actually, I'll appreciate it if you keep that scenario in mind should
    he move that fleet anywhere BUT Spain(sc)

    As to the above paragraph, it will depend on how strongly he stabs me.
    If it's just the single fleet, I'd prefer to keep up the attack on
    Austria.  To be honest, I'd rather NOT work with Edi if at all possible.
    Simply put if you, Edi and I have to ally against F/G, I'd very
    definitely end up as the junior partner.  Not to my liking... :)
    
    Anyway, let's see how this turn shapes up.  Damn, these deadlines
    are starting to seem WAY too far apart.  If you have any ideas
    after the weekend, please pass them on.

    Hohn
    Am going through my mail queue, and stumbled upon a message from you,
    i.e., your reply to my proposed ITR hit of Edi.  You asked for my
    thoughts, so here they are.
    1) I appreciate your not lying "up front" to me and perpetuating this
    buffoonish game of "gotcha."  You could have indeed lied to me for your
    own expense, although quite honestly it would've availed you naught, and
    then I would've just said to you what you earlier said to me:  "One more
    lie or attempted stab and we're through this game."  Nonetheless, you
    were truthful enough to reject my proposal, so I give you that.  Thank
    you.
    
    2) As of this space in time, I do indeed find you (a) inflexible, (b)
    lacking in ultimate sincerity, or (c) both.  I'm sorry if that sounds
    like a double-barrel between the eyes, but I know you're fond of
    straightforward talk, and this is about as straightforward as I get.
    Here you are, warning that one more fib would make things probably
    irreconciliable for the game's duration.  So I don't even cover SEV last
    turn, fully intending to show my goodwill.  Ok, you got me, and kudos to
    you.  Now I'm trying to make the effort to show -- yet again -- *more*
    sincerity, with a no-kidding "hurt Edi" gameplan (the only thing he tells
    me he fears, btw).  And you yet again obfuscate and hedge.   You cite
    'lack of trust.'  Sure, there's a grain of that, on both sides.  I for
    one am willing to let it die; I was last turn, and I'll do it again for
    this turn.  Why not you?
    
    I mean, no offense, but I have a lot better things to do than write move
    options and proposals, just to be cute and never really intend for them
    to be implemented.  I wouldn't make this effort if I wasn't sincere,
    Hohn.  And what do you think Italy's intent is?!   If he's with us, then
    all the better to hurt Edi and break out westward ASAP.   And if he's
    been seduced by Edi into an AI, then what better time to break through
    their coalescing front than now?    I offer chocoloate fudge chunk, and
    you dish out vanilla in reply.
    
    3) I'm having a hard time convincing myself that you'll ever find it in
    yourself to consider a serious proposal from me, either by design or by
    nature.  And that's a shame.  A shame for me, because it's my one
    remaining good option to hurt the Grand Master, and a shame for you
    because I think that it offers you more gain than an AT designed to take
    me out.  (But that's just my opinion, naturally.) Oh, you'll take me out,
    but you'll get nothing for it.
    
    4) Tell you what:  Edi's already said he's staying with the AT unless I
    leave GAL.  You go ahead and do what you have to do regarding BLA; I
    can't stop you anyway.  IF and when you ever see that RT opening vs A,
    let me know.   Give me  a real no-kidding sign of commitment, as opposed
    to the "over the next horizon" 'maybes.'  I'd LOVE to make it happen, to
    remove the big Balkan threat and then to turn attention to the forming
    FG.    But the ball's in your court.  Until then, I'll just assume you're
    locked and cocked with Edi for the duration.

    With respect to the "profanity and civility" issue, I for one would
    never play in a PBEM game where any purported regulation of such
    conduct was in place.  I'm a dedicated free speech advocate, and
    moreover, I feel that there are times when both profanity and
    allegedly "uncivil" press can be tactically useful.  Very few words
    can capture the strength and elegance of a simple "bullshit," when
    appropriately used.  And when some player (usually of questionable
    competence) tries to justify clearly incorrect or silly moves or
    decisions (especially if that player tries to persuade others as to
    the correctness of the position), there's often nothing like a little
    satire and ridicule to deflate that position.
    
    Is it "nice?"  No, not always.  But I'm willing to accept the
    consequences of my actions, even if that means I have to deal with a
    suicidal game-thrower in the long-run.  It's about advantages weighing
    against the disadvantages, in my opinion.
    
    I can see how such rules might be appropriate in a FTF setting, when
    the potential for physical intimidation (real or perceived) might
    otherwise potentially affect the game in an improper fashion, but in a
    text-only medium, I feel such rules are not preferable.

    Hohn,
    Ref below...
    
    I've made the unilateral decision that further discussion along these
    lines will not be productive at this time.  I've told you what I'm
    doing.  You can do what you choose.
    
    ** Indeed you have (thanks again) and indeed I will.  I'm just tring to
    'diplome' with some correspondence and to discuss(in the initial
    messages) why you ddn't like the proposal.  Then I tried to give you my
    spin to your views in a reply.  If you don't see value in it (for just
    spring, I hope?), then fine, I'll stop bothering you.
    
    
    P.S. IMO, it's not generally a good idea to accuse that your fellow
    players, especially in a game where all are experts such as this one,
    are gullibly eating someone else's lines without thought.
    
    ** Come on, Hohn, really!  First off, word are just another weapon,
    something you -- Mr Free Speech Advocate--should certainly understand.
    ((Ref your earlier broadcast message about profanity and use of words as
    weapons in a game))   Don't be so testy over a game tool.   I'm not
    impugning your intelligence; you ARE a lawyer, after all, something whch
    requires independent thought and "smarts."
    
    ** Secondly,  _I do NOT_ see anyone here as "gullibly eating someone
    else's lines without thought."  Hey, I know no one put a gun to your head
    (or mine) to make the moves you (or I)  did.  We make the beds we lie in.
     And your very offer of 'something' after S'02 keeps the door open for
    future cooperative efforts (if we can get past these notes)!  I would
    just like to see some of the "old (S'01) Hohn" and some moves
    recommendations, instead of "I'm afraid I can't comment on that" and
    "your moves are too risky."  But I digress...After the moves, if you want
    to deal, I'm here.  Always will be.

    Edi, before you head out...
    
    Any chance of an 11th hour reconciliation between us?  By this, I mean:
    1) I call off Cal (maybe even send him to TYO this turn and go after
    MUN?)
    2) You "perhaps" use Bul-Rum (Bud S) to annihilate RUM (knowing that
    Hohn's using both fleets to kill BLA)
    	a) This is in conjunction with Gal-Ukr, Ukr-Sev (Mos S), Bla-Arm
    	b) Not only do you breathe easier in the west, but you also
    achieve your goal of having me vacate GAL...AND you get RUM, to boot!
    	c) Hohn gets BLA, and has all of three centers to do nothing.
    	d) Come fall, you use Gre S Rum-Bul to bounce any two-fleet
    turkish threat to BUL.
    
    ANOTHER OPTION:
    You support me (GAL- RUM!)  with BUL.  This lets you keep vie-Tyo, Bud S
    Tri (or however you envision Cal's coming assault).   This (again) gets
    me out of Gal; allows me to reconquer Rum and SEv, and then--THEN--I will
    rebuild for an anti-German war, and you can run amok down south after
    that...take it all, for all I care.
    
    I'll tell you the reason I'm saying this:
    You and Hohn have both displayed an amazing recalcitrance to talk
    options.  i'm boxed-in, and we all know it.  germany's move of Mun-Tyo is
    problematic at best.  if I'm hit in GAL, I *will* retreat to BOH and make
    my last gasps be anti-Austrian, to Hohn's and Pitt's gain.
    
    I'm not saying the above in any sort of hissy-fit.  You're a damn fine
    player, and this threat is one of the few (pitiful) weapons of persuasion
    left in my arsenal.  I have to try and use whatever's left to get my
    point across.
    
    I can and will work with you down south, but you haven't offered any
    CONSTRUCTIVE options since S'01, and I have a hunch those were to ensure
    you became top-dog down there.
    
    I mean, you and Hohn can stay allied, and I'll just divert centers to T
    and G for as long as possible.  Or you and I can deal (even in a 70-30
    split) and you'll forever be freed of an eastern flank threat.
    
     Can you say the same for Hohn after F'02, with that fleet of his in BLA
    and all those units next to you, and "no moreMark to kick around
    anymore?"
    
    I'd be curious to hear your views, Edi.  I'll go halfway with you on
    this, to the point of even working with Italy over your perceived
    threats.

    Hi Cal
    
    One quick note before I return to grading papers...
    
    1) If you're after Edi this turn, do you want me to hit Bud or Vie (or
    concentrate on Gal-Rum to retake SEV)?  Can we convince Edi to cover Tyo
    (i.e., have him think you're moving Ven-Tyo, Apu-ven (Adr S)?  if so,
    then I can hit Bud, you can take TRI, and then who knows?
    
    2) If the Edi thing won't work for a turn, how about this?  You go to
    Ven-Tyo, Adr-Ven (temporarily, in case Edi gets frisky), and do the
    convoy to ALB.  I hang around in GAL (Edi 'says" he might let me linger
    there, for obvious anti-T overtones...yeah, right).  if he does, then you
    and I hit VIE in Fall.  if he does hit me, then I retreat to SIL, and
    support you to MUN (or you take it and I shoot for BER).
    
    Wacky?  Nutty?  Sure.  But so's waiting around for thec unbreakable AT
    axe to fall on my neck.  The letters between Hohn and I are once again
    approaching critical meltdown, and I'm stumped by it.  I'm sure he's a
    swel human, but I can't get past the tone of his letters, and i'm sure my
    responses (in kind) are perceived equally dimly.  I'm not sure our
    personalities will allow us to deal in a game (ironic, ain't it)?
    
    He (Tur) wants to destroy me F BLA and then see what's available come
    fall.  If he's being on the up-and-up, great, perhaps we can wait a turn.
     If not, then I'll collapse quickly.  And if Germany orders Kie-Den and
    slides into nwy behind me in spring, then I'm hosed anyway (hence my
    Germany option above, however ludicrous).
    
    Any ideas, suggestions, or recommendations for joint policy?  Quite
    honestly, everyone's expecting me to go Gal-Rum, Ukr S Mos-Sev, Bla-Arm,
    and then retake SEV.  I can thus support you in your needs, if you want.
    I don't care at this stage, frankly.

    Certainly.  That's not the point, though.
    
    > ((Ref your earlier broadcast message about profanity and use of words as

    I'm of the opinion that certain game tools are more effective than
    others depending on the situation.  In an expert's game, it's not
    generally a good idea to imply mindless puppetdom, IMO.
    
    That's my opinion.  Take it for what it's worth.  And you again
    mistake bluntness for some sort of anger/annoyance/testiness, which is
    not the case.
    
    > I'm not
    > impugning your intelligence; you ARE a lawyer, after all, something whch

    Actually, considering some of the lawyers I've dealt with, that's
    hardly a general rule. ;)
    
    > I would

    I've made move recommendations.  Take SEV.  I'll take BLA.  Anything
    beyond that is neither necessary nor prudent.  We don't need to know
    the particulars, since the tactical situation dictates variability.
    
    As for why I couldn't comment before, and why I've been wary in my
    dealings with you, there's a reason for that, Mark.

    I am worried about Pitt too, insofar as he would have much to gain by
    taking
    your (virtually) undefended centres, but I think he's telling the truth
    when
    he sayd he wants to finish England off first.  It's a case of wanting to
    establish a corner position on the board (vital for any central power as
    y'all know) and NOT leave a hostile, or potentially so, neighbour behind
    him.

    a while until we can maneuver Hohn into position to be attacked
    (assuming
    this EVER happens; he's a pretty wary player).
    
    ** I understand fully his nervousness.  The aggravating thing, in my
    humble opinion, is:
     Yeah, I stabbed him twice under the siren song of Edi.  You moved vs
    France in 1901; should he mistrust and begrduge you for the rest of the
    game, on his terms?
    
    I've, as they say, reformed, and last turn was the signal that I
    ((anyway)) was willing to accept the New Order..
    
    So what does this all imply?  He can carry the grudge of my 1901 stabs to
    the grave while *I* just suck up his 1902 stab and accept everything on
    his terms, when he's good and ready?  "Not."   The (real) Germans may
    have to live with decades of guilt trips for the Holocaust, but I'm not
    letting him smear me for the duration of this game.  Hohn carries his own
    moral smudges after last turn, as far as I'm concerned.  Fact is, though,
    I've put it past me,  but he hasn't seemed to purge his ghosts yet....oh
    well, maybe after he spanks BLA, the world will be so much brighter
    (yeah, right).
    
    In all honesty, I think Hohn and I have similar "off-board"
    personalities, and that we're clashing on non-game issues.  He's a clear
    Type A, blunt, "on my terms" kind of guy, and I've got that old military
    thing about planning strategy and giving orders...anal-retentive in my
    own right.  Mix two north poles on the same magnet, throw in a couple
    stabs (three, to be exact), and you have the current situation.  Still,
    we are talking, and if we ever do work together, Edi's days are clearly
    numbered.   And then you and I have to figure out a way to stretch his
    neck on the block and throttle the s*** out of him.
    
    Oh well, one crisis at a time!
    
    ** based on your earlier note (and my crazy GER option here), I think
    I'll just use Gal to hit RUM and regain SEV.    My big fear is:  Rum-Ukr
    while I use Ukr-Sev, Mos S (the only sure way I can get Sev, btw).  Then
    I have Turkey completely surrounding Sev, on the border of WAR, and Edi
    possibly in GAL....  that's one reason I could use some hitting of TYO
    this turn, as it forces Vie or BUD to support TRI (thus keeping his
    centers occupied and also keeping GAL in my hands for the fall season...)
    
    ** Oh, tactics question:  I know I said I'd not bother Pitt, but let me
    ask you:  Jamie wants me to support Edi-Nth, to bust up the convoy and
    commit vs Pitt.  Says that Pitt's moving to Den anyway with F Kie (I was
    hoping for Hel), and that I may as well help him.  Your thoughts?  I
    mean, if I help Pitt by Nwy-Nwg, Pitt can take Swe and Nwy in fall,
    regardless....decisions, decisions.
    
    ** Last point:  the cross-gaming reference last note.  It wasn't meant to
    be an accusation.  I just figure it this way ((bear with me here)):  this
    is the first time I've ever crossed swords with anyone in this game.  Edi
    and Pitt go back a long way, and will be en route to WorldCon very soon
    together.   Edi and Hohn are/have played in a previous game recently,
    allying I believe.   I just speak from frustration, because I view myself
    as the "blue-collar schmuck who became nouveaux riche by winning the
    lottery," and I'm now in the fancy mansion at a party with all the REAL
    "pros from Dover" (that's you guys) who greet each other as old
    associates and buds, while I feel out of place.  It's silly, I realize,
    because no one in this game has ever 'talked down" or made me feel like I
    didn't belong...but I feel like I'm on the outside looking in at guys
    with ties going years back...makes it easy to feel like there's big
    conspiracies and "old boy" dealings.
    
    I know, I know, "Faz, you're a knucklehead, and therapy's
    cheap"...actually, beers are cheaper, and I'm gonna go have one now.
    Enjoy your day, mon ami.

    Hi Pitt: Just thought we should stay in touch even though there's
    not a lot we can do this season.
    
    France initially warned me that he would have to build a fleet
    in Marseilles.  I told him I didn't like it much but it was
    very obvious that it was really build option.  No problem.
    
    THEN he sends me an offer to move his fleet my way in order to
    "help" me against Edi.  I told him that I was NOT at all
    sanguine enough about my strategic position to want anything
    to do with THAT.
    
    What I'd like to ask you is your take on this.  Do you think
    he'll send the fleet my way anyway?  He sent me a very curt
    note saying he wouldn't (and seemed "hurt" that I didn't want
    his help), but I don't know if I can believe him.  Admittedly,
    I don't suppose I can trust his ally (you! heh heh) for a straight
    answer either, but I'm gonna try anyway.  What's up?
    
    On this front, things are still quite muddled so I won't pass
    on any (probably) incorrect rumours. You probably know as much
    as I do anyway.
    
    Regards
    
    Cal
    
    btw, have a nice time in Sweden.  If you see Per Westling, tell
    him I said hello.  Thanx CW

    I'm getting much the same from them.  I do not believe they are
    cross-gaming
    (and I'm a little surprised you would even imply that), but I simply
    think
    it's a case of two good players being convinced that allying (at least
    for
    now) is in their own best interests.  I'll keep trying though and let
    you
    know if I'm making progress.

    I am worried about Pitt too, insofar as he would have much to gain by
    taking
    your (virtually) undefended centres, but I think he's telling the truth
    when
    he sayd he wants to finish England off first.  It's a case of wanting to
    establish a corner position on the board (vital for any central power as
    y'all know) and NOT leave a hostile, or potentially so, neighbour behind
    him.

    Hohn has told me that he hasn't ruled out working with you in the
    future,
    but that it will be on his terms with him in the driver's seat.  Given
    the way you guys talk to each other and the fact that you have stabbed

    Germany WILL hit you eventually, you may have to put up with this for

    I'm too lazy to re-arrange the blox myself, but if that's the better
    centre-saving option for you go ahead with that.  The slower you

    I don't want to see Edi in Tyrolia, so if you would hit Vienna, I would
    appreciate it.  That way, if he DOES get to tyo, then he would have to
    use that army to try and get back (or cover) Vienna.  Cool with you?

    That plan is a bit too wacky for me, although if I was in your position,
    I'd probably suggest the same.  While I'm hardly a major power in this
    game, I still have some position in the game.  No one is attacking (yet)
    and I have some potential expansion avenues in Austria.  Therefore, I'd
    just as soon not get to that "what the hell, let's try this and see how
    much fun it is" stage.  I don't think that you are either, but that's
    your own perception.  The way this game has changed yearly (hell,
    SEASONALLY!), nobody is totally out of it yet.  Hang in there, buddy! :)

    I think that once Hohn has taken out your offending fleet, he'll be a
    whole lot more reasonable.  My guess is that, once he feels more secure
    in his borders, he'll at least start to think about anti-Austrianess on
    his part.  I hope...

    If you want to do this instead of hitting Vienna, by all means go ahead.

    Hi John
    Just wanted to report that I'm back from a most relaxing vacation, and
    now back in the 'acedemic grind' of grading papers and such; lovely.
    Hope this finds you doing well.
    
    Have you been giving much thought to the "E vs G" position of your nation
    (a rhetorical question, I'm sure)!?  You must realize from a Russian
    standpoint, that I'd love to see an FIE vs G, to balance the board, keep
    Pitt quiescent in terms of greed, and to secure both your country (all
    those guys in your nation....) and mine (so many open centers to strive
    for...).  If you're more inclined to go "pro-Germany," then that means
    i'll need to adjust my policies as well, to try and pick up some scraps
    and whatot before you guys subsume me, and probably Italy.
    
    Regardless of France's stance, I wish you well.   I thought I was pullin
    a fast one, subverting Edi's grand plan for rapid FT dismemberment, but
    lo and behold, the only "fast" activity is my rapid dismemberment at the
    hands of Edi the Ethereal and Hohn the Merciless (lawyers; gag).
    Anything France can do to help its autocratic empire to the East would be
    gratefully appreciated, it goes without saying.
    
    Good hunting, monsieur!

    GKJ,
    Ref your reply to my note:
    
    Yes, there indeed *are* chances that I would support you in fall. More
    than likely, my support will indeed be forthcoming in fall.
    
    In fact, I was reconsidering stuff after I sent you the first note.  I'm
    not sure whether to just "end the misery" quickly, and thus GOAD Pitt
    into attacking me (i.e., a spring support of you), or  to wait until fall
    and then offer support.
    
    I mean, my position is far from crushed, but in all honesty, real-life is
    making it hard for me to keep up correspondence...or interest... in this
    one.    I had second thoughts about joining this, but decided to stick it
    out as a favor to Jim-Bob, and I did, after all, volunteer in the first
    place.  While I don't yet rue the day I signed up, let's just say it's
    not going to ruin my life if I get (or incite) a blow-out of my positio,
    so I can wind down some games and concentrate on trying to do my real job
    and balance some family time.
    
    I say all this because right now I'm having an internal debate whether to
    "play it to the hilt" and gut out the turns, trying to wean away the A/T,
    balance in favor of E and I, gain some centers (natch), etc, OR  to say
    "strategy?  what strategy?" and just have some wild-a** fun...don't want
    to ruin it for the other "Serious Sams" if I do the latter, however...not
    being a regular in PBEM, I don't want to violate any "ghods-type" norms
    or mores...   -grin-
    
    But yes, Jamie, I'm not going over to 'the dark side'  and ignoring you.
    I want to see what G and T do in spring (especially G).  I mean, it's
    problematic if Hohn screws me in fall -- I won't know 'till it happens.
    But if Pitt goes to Den in spring, then it's not so hard to read the tea
    leaves...Things could be a -rumblin' come autumn...  Hang in there, mon
    ami.

    GKJ,
    Have been looking over all the moves possibilities and whatnot.  I wanted
    to send this early, and let you know I don't think I can provide support
    for your Edi-Nth.  I don't know what I'm going to do with Nwy yet,
    but--given Hohn's foot-dragging and uncertainty, Edi's outright
    acknowledgment of war, and my desire to stay solvent to continue to help
    Italy-I think it's prudent not to pick another fight (Pitt) at this
    stage.   Not until I see Den-Swe (as opposed to perhaps Hel?) and any
    other signs of overt aggression from him.  I mean, why anger yet another
    neighbor?  He merely then retreats to Ska (or Nwg) and unleashes his dogs
    of war.  At least that's the view from StP, however muddled.
    
    My plan is to see what France does this turn, as well as the results of
    down south.  If Hohn is "with" me in fall, I can go +1 from the
    annihilated F Bla, and life will be hunky-dory (I may also  yet retreat
    to SIL from GAL, if Edi boots me, depending on what Pitt does).
    
    Can you not go Edi-Yor, Ech-Lon, and forestall the convoy?   I mean, I
    doubt that Germany will try for Edi on an 'end-around."  or am I being
    naive?
    
    While not wanting to enrage you on this, a sunny Sunday morning in NY, I
    thought it best to at least give you a heads-up two days prior to the
    moves, me hearty.

    On the board:
    
    Here's what I think.
    
    First of all, if I were mad at you and decided I would really like to see
    you crash and burn before I did, I would strongly suggest that you move to
    Nwg. Because I really think this would be the best way to get Germany to
    shift targets. If he thinks he can grab Scandinavia and StP from you,
    letting Turkey and Austria clean out the rest of you, I am almost sure
    he'll do it. It gives him a relatively secure position (Germany always
    hankers after security), very quick builds, and from there he would have no
    trouble at all finishing *me* off. So that would not be very good for me at
    all, but it would be worse for you. Well, naturally, I may have misjudged
    Pitt. Maybe he really wants you to hang around. Sure. :)
    
    Suppose we consider what the board looks like if you just hold in Norway.
    Pitt attempts a convoy over Nth; maybe it works, maybe it fails (he and I
    have to guess). His new fleet goes to Denmark. So it's Ger F Nth, Ger F
    Den, Rus F Nwy. You have to guess whether he will order Den-Swe. If you
    move Nwy-Swe, he could convoy an army into Norway through Nth! Disaster.
    You would *have* to guess right. (Would Pitt instead use the F Nth against
    me? I don't think so. If he's managed to convoy, then I cannot possibly
    prevent him from taking one of my centers. If he hasn't managed it, then he
    cannot possibly take one of my centers. The F Nth is irrelevant for taking
    my centers in the Fall.)
    
    Suppose instead that you support my F Edi into Nth. Now Pitt has to choose
    a retreat. Maybe he retreats to Ska (seems as plausible as any retreat).
    
    And now, again, you have to outguess him. He could support an attack on
    Sweden. But, I can cut any support he gives (but only by guessing right).
    You could order Nwy-Swe, and I would order Nth-Ska or Nth-Den (I'd even let
    you choose! It's just a guess). Of course, he could order Ska-Nwy, instead.
    I am pretty sure this is still a 50-50 guess. I can work it out if you're
    skeptical.
    
    
    So, it seems to me that it is no worse for you if you support me into North
    Sea. (Except that you'd have to believe me when I say I'll have that fleet
    give whatever order you want in the Spring. I think that's pretty
    believable, don't you? I have nothing else to do with the fleet, after all,
    and I am almost freakishly trustworthy.) And in the long run, assuming that
    we both *have* a long run, it's a lot better. For one thing, with a fleet
    in Nth I tie up quite a lot of German units protecting those Nth-bordering
    centers of his. For another, it makes Germany a more tempting target for
    France (I think France is still undecided about what to do next). And, if
    you *do* manage to get Hohn on your side, it sets up a position with some
    real offensive potential if you can manage ever to build another unit up
    north.
    
    
    
    Off the board:
    I've experienced some burn-out myself. Over the last year, or more even,
    I've cut down to playing a single game at a time. I hear Dip players
    complain about this all the time (not *complain*, exactly, maybe
    'bemoan'?). No doubt the day-to-day deception, scheming, suspension of
    ordinary morality takes a psychological toll. I speculate that Dip burn-out
    is a sign of a healthy moral psychology!
    
    That said, I must say add that I am enjoying this game, despite the
    on-the-board problems.
    
    Maybe Pitt and Edi will get into an ugly dispute over something trivial at
    the convention, and come back each devoted to tearing out each others'
    guts. :)

    day, and I haven't yet "SET ADDRESS" back to this address.  I imagine
    that I can only 'send' from here, but anything you reply with goes back
    to the juno.com address.
    
    Will re-set addresses either later today, or tonight, after i read
    what's on the web.  Much to do after 9 days away from work (ugh...)

    If he moves there, I can't really stop him.  sigh   What makes you think
    he
    and Pitt have no "real relations"?

    Definitely.
    
    > Holy cow. You're worried about Pitt?
    
    Not as in "Oh geez, I hope he doesn't attack me this turn!", but more
    that,
    since he's likely to be a power in mid/end game I don't want to piss him
    off (well, not yet anyway).
    
    > Ok. My idea was just, if France is genuinely wondering what he can do to

    I'll probably have better luck talking him into hitting Pitt AFTER Pitt
    attacks Germany.  Unfortunately, this timing may not be the best thing
    for enhancing your survival...

    If A/T stay a threat, then obviously I won't be up for any attack on
    Germany.
    Actually, ANY talk about me moving north is strictly speculative.  As I

    Pitt, I was hoping to hear from you regarding my last message.  To remind
    you, I asked about your opinion of the AT alliance.  I had suggested that
    perhaps allowing them to take out Russia and attack Italy unimpeded might
    be a bad idea.  However, I am not adamant about this.  Just wanted to talk
    through the implications.

    I'll think about it a little.
    
    Ok, actually, I think you'd be absolutely crazy to move to Nwg. There's no
    doubt in my mind, Pitt would take both Sweden and Norway. I'll be very
    surprised indeed if he doesn't move Kie-Den in the Spring.
    
    So I think you should stay in Norway. I know, you think the issue is whether
    you *anger* Pitt, but I am pretty sure you have to be careful not to *tempt*
    him.

    GKJ,
    Actually, I hadn't given the matter much thought (ref conditions for
    supporting you in fall).  I _know_ that sounds crazy, but I haven't
    really thought that far up in the north, other than to say I can help
    you.  The south has occupied nearly all of my nail-biting worries....
    
    I mean, if I move to Nwg this turn, then the fleet can support you in
    Edi, or (God forbid) you or I actually get Nth next turn!  If the fleet
    holds in Nwy, then I probably still piss Pitt off by not being aggressive
    vs you, and then I'm not sure what else it can do, short of supporting
    Edi-Nth in fall.     And, if I move to Nwg this turn and we hit Nth next
    season, he just retreats to Nwy (and if he did Kie-Den, then I lose both
    Scandy centers in fall).
    
    To cite Mark, "The spirit is willing, but nature is weak."  I'm certainly
    willing, but my (mental) nature hasn't really thought this through, other
    than to say I "owe" you (in a good way, obviously).
    
    I'd be willing to entertain any and all English thoughts, to include
    Spring moves up there for me...hold?  nwg?  etc.
    
    Thanks for the moral support on game continuance.  I used to think I was
    a Diplomacy version of "Ironman" Cal Ripken, refusing to burn out from or
     quit the hobby, no matter how many years I played.  And while I can't
    picture myself without an active Dip game or two, I have to admit there
    have been an increasing amount of days lately where I'm tempted to just
    "mass-resign" and see wat life is like "beyond the hobby."  Given that
    I'm the guy who dosn't like the first 'dip' into a cold pool, I have a
    hunch I'll never "take the plunge" and quit, but I still have my days...
    
    Appreciate the notes, Jamie.  Despite the goofy start this game, for some
    reason you're the closest 'soul-mate' I can identify with this game, for
    what it's worth.  Take care, and let me hear your ideas.

    >I think I'm going to dislodge BLA and watch and see what happens in
    >Spring, before I decide what to do in Fall and long-term.
    
    Seems sensible.
    
    Mark told me that's what you said you were going to do. (Actually, he told
    me after you did.)
    
    
    >Good luck on your defense.  I hope you can stymie Pitt. :)
    
    I believe I can stymie him for a while. Obviously, unless something else
    happens to shake things up, I am severely outgunned and my days are
    numbered. But I am cheerfully optimistic that something else *might*
    happen, though I don't quite see what it could be.
    
    France has implied to me a mysterious plan. Maybe it's just a little
    smokescreen (I'm assuming not, since if attacked by Germany and France
    simultaneously I have no hope at all). But in any case, I am not counting
    on any French help with Germany in the immediate future. So the most
    obvious source of aid would be Russia. Thus my interest in Russo-Turkish
    relations.
    
    But more of that, if relevant, next season.
    
    Cheers!

    About Hohn:
    I got a note from him last night, very short, but to the same effect. He
    said he'd dislodge the Black Sea fleet, then see how things looked.
    
    I don't think that's such bad news. To be reasonable, we have to see that
    he can't be happy leaving that fleet of yours in Black Sea. Let him feel
    secure, then he'll be most likely to make the moves that will be to his own
    long term advantage. And I think you and I are pretty confident that the
    moves that are to Turkey's long term advantage are moves into the Balkans.
    At least I feel very sure of this.
    
    If it means you get to take back Sev, that's icing. So to you, Half a
    league! Half a league! Half a league on!
    
    
    >Pitt wants me to move to NWG and take his chances with the convoy and/or
    >retreat to open center.
    
    Hah!
    
    So he can take Sweden *and* control Baltic, or take Sweden and even Norway.
    
    The face he's presented to me says that he's decided that I'm no real
    threat to him, that it would take him a long time to do me in, so he'd go
    get all those available Russian centers instead while the gettin' was good.

    Well, you know, he's going to move to Den, so you have to guess for Swe and
    Nwy anyway.

    Yes.
    I explained in another message, one to you and Cal. Cal later confirmed.
    Cal rejects the kind offer of French help. (Of course. He's not crazy!)
    
    Now the ball is in France's court. I suggested that you tell France that
    the way to help you is to pressure Germany. Maybe that will work now.

    Gentlemen:  I'm back!   Leave was "beauteous," to coin a word.  Enjoyed
    the heck out of the backwoodsy, no-computer lifestyle at my folks' place.
      Shot and subsequently  'sacrificed'  two model rockets to theTree
    Branch Gods, raced slot cars, built a borderline 'hot' Pinewood Derby
    car, and played hide-and-seek with the kids...and now I'm back in reality
    (sigh)...and of course, this includes the 'reality' of PBEM Dip and this
    *&^%$ game.
    
    Got a most disappointing reply from Hohn (and from Pitt) on my "squash
    Edi" plan.  Not that Hohn and Edi and Pitt would ever cross-game, or NOT
    consider hitting each other, mind you -- but they're going to
    extraordinary lengths to find reasons why they "just can't' consider my
    recommendations....
    
    Pitt wants me to move to NWG and take his chances with the convoy and/or
    retreat to open center.  He's giving me the morale pep-talks about
    'continuing to hold on' (Berlin 1945 springs to mind for some reason...);
    also tells me he 'can't let E off the hook' by building/moving to TYO.
    Of course, he also wants me to fight on because his flank is open to AT
    (but not open enough to worry about it himself)!  He's also concerned
    about France (wonder why) and doesn't want to divert his attention from
    the western front.
    
    Turkey continues to drone on about how we 'can't trust each other enough'
    to do the moves I recommended in conjunction with Cal vs. Edi.  I took
    him to task on that one - told him I had better things to do than write
    reams of proposed, SUCCESSFUL moves just to be cute and never intend to
    follow through.  I told him he was inflexible and recalcitrant, and that
    he probably never intends to break the AT paradigm....how's that foe
    encouraging words?
    
    He SAYS he wants to annhiliate BLA (while 'letting' me regain either SEV
    or RUM), and after that, we can "begin to discuss possible options."
    
    God, I hate lawyers.
    
    I told him to do what he felt needed done, and that if he ever woke up
    and saw the benefits in hitting Edi, that I'd be around.   I'm not
    holding my breath (I'm already brain-damaged enough as it is).
    
    FOR GKJ:  Understood about the Nwy support thing.  Of course, this merely
    makes a SKA retreat inevitable, and then a guessing game of Swe or Nwy.
    But hey, I did say I wanted to go out in supernova, right?   -grin-.
    
    FOR CAL:  Whatever option you'd like in the east is ok by me.
    Unfortunately, when I lose GAL and BLA, cooperative efforts will be
    severely constrained (until ((unless))  the 7th Kaiser's Kavarly rides to
    Little Big Horn AFTER the massacre).
    
    Hey, we could go Ven-Tyo, Gal r SIL, and then put the F'03  whammy on MUN
    in conjunction with anything France might do.  It might be crazy enough
    to consider????
    
    Speaking of France, has anyone heard what he's up to?  I have 35 messages
    in the queue, so perhaps I'll withhold further talk until I scope the
    stuff out.  But if he built F MAR, well...let's HOPE there's not an FG!
    
    I welcome any and all discussion, as always, mes amis.  Take care of
    yourselves.

    Am in rceipt of both your notes; thanks, as always.  Without trying to be
    deceptive (which I'm not), or occasionally dense (which I am), let me
    ask:
    
    You essentially want me to thus support you, in spring, with Nwy S
    Edi-nth; correct?  (I *am* a first learner, am I not??)
    
    Ah, what the h.....why not.  If I _am_ courting a "burn-out/ brown-out
    death wish," this will certainly accentuate it.  Pitt will criticize my
    stupidity in angering the only 'true" ally I have left on the board, and
    he and Edi may have "more" to now discuss en route to WorldCon.  But your
    points are valid, and I do indeed trust you regarding help from
    Enhlishmen in nth Sea...who knows, this may even tip France into our
    camp...stranger things have happened.  If not, then COUNT ON me leaving
    Nwy in fall, with YOU moving there (if we can arrange it).  Think about
    it.  Of course, much will depend on what the south does, but let's at
    least mull it over after the moves come out.
    
    Off-board, it's good to see others sufffering thru the occasional "Dip
    dementia" stages I currently feel.  And, in a painful, perverse way, I am
    enjoying this game.

    >FYI, I have been asking Pitt about lending a hand against AT, but he won't

    ** is it:
    1) He writes you, but won't specifically respond to AT issues, or
    2) He's not responding about anything?
    
    As we both know, if it's the former, that's one thing.  if he's being
    quiet on the diplomatic front with you, then one of three possible
    reasons exist:
    1) He feels you and he have a modus vivendi, and no need to discuss
    alliance issues;
    2) He's en route to WorldCon, and talking to no one at the moment; or
    3) You are just as legitimate a target as any other one of us.
    
    Truth is, King John, I sure would like you to consider some, shall we
    say, colelctive action against our large Germanic neighbor???  I'm not
    asking you to do anything in isolation (hint, hint), _believe me_.
    Tomorrow's move results will show this.  Any pro-Russian moves you can

    Pitt, I have been reminded that you may be on your way to World DipCon,
    which I take to explain your silence.  In any event, the rumors are
    circulating that your prosperity is threatening to others.  I have been
    asked a number of times to participate in an anti-German coalition.  None
    of this struck me as going anywhere until today.  Now, I am afraid you may
    be facing threats from several fronts.  I would not be surprised by R-A
    cooperation and perhaps an Austrian unit on your border.
    
    In light of this, I think I should move an army to Marseilles.

    and whtnot; when do you head off to WorldCon?  Are you & Edi traveling

    As for working together, I will give you the "qualified yes," i.e., much

    I am happy to have heard from you.  No, I did not receive your earlier
    reply.  FYI, apart from feeling a bit uncomfortable about the silence, my
    moves remain the same.  I will move to Mid and to Spa.  I can go either way
    from there, so I was not worried about the tactics.  In my last message I
    said I would move an army to Mar.  This may look anti-Italy, but I think
    it's a wise precaution against a possible A-I attack on you.  The reversals

    Yeah, the iri-Cly thing is tricky, honest.  I always get the western
    coastline mixed up, too (guess it shows my bias at wanting only Eastern
    countries to play, huh)?
    
    Not that it matters, but does this change anything about the support
    plan?  I mean, is it any great vlaue to be in nth if you have to go back
    to Edi anyway as a possible cover (given that iri can't get there for
    awhile?  Would it not be better to have Eng-Nth, with Edi S?  Then you
    go Iri-Eng (or Wal) and come around the flank that way....If Pitt
    retreats to LON, so what?   You then have two fleets to crunch him
    ((this idea assumes I go Nwy-Ska...yoiks...to force his Den/Hel/wherever

    I guess i could then go to Nwg and "show" Pitt I'm still "in" on this
    (oops, wait; then he could retreat to nwy)....hmmmm.....
    
    Well, let's leave it at this:  I'm supporting you.  If your analysis
    shows that it's better to abort the plan, tell me and I'll figure
    something else out.  If not, we're on.  The goal is to entice France in
    with us, and to keep Pitt away from Nwy and Edi come fall.   Our minds
    are one (to cite the Vulcan Mind meld episode of Star Trek).

    Oh, that kind of dividend.
    Well, I guess it's better than nothing. :)
    
    
    Once we see the results of these moves, I'll go to work on both France and
    Turkey. My impressionistic sense is that there's no point in bugging either
    of them now, it would only annoy them. (Can you imagine? Some people are
    *annoyed* by getting too much Diplomacy mail! What alien minds.) Maybe we
    can get somewhere diplomatically while Edi and Pitt are out of the country.
    
    Hm.
    
    Just heard from you, saying you'd just heard from Pitt.
    
    I just heard from Pitt, too. He says he is disappointed that I never
    replied to his 'admittedly extreme' suggestion, and wants to know whether
    he ought to take that as a rejection.
    
    The thing is, he never sent me any suggestion. Doesn't seem like a ruse.
    Probably he thought he'd sent me something.
    
    I'm eager to hear what he proposes. I'm sure it will be something I'd have
    to be a complete idiot to accept, from the way he's set me up. But I'm
    eager to hear it, just for the entertainment value.
    
    He might very well retreat to Yor or Nwy. I'll have Edi uncovered, and
    coverable only by the F Nth. (I have to admit something really dumb. I
    thought Irish Sea bordered Clyde! I planned to move to Clyde. You can tell
    I haven't played England as much as I ought to have!)

    Just received a note from Pitt, who hadn't heard from me since last
    week...wanted to know if we were 'still working together.'
    
    Being unable to (completely) lie thru my teeth anymore, I told him that
    much depended on him.  if he moved to Bal or Den, then I would be 'sad.'
     If he moved to hel, weeeellll, that's another story!  (And that's
    exactly how I worded my note.)   Will be interesting to receive his
    reply.  Let me know if you (or anyone else you hear from) hears anything
    recent from the ol' Kaiser.
    
    You realize I am now baiting the proverbial hungry gorilla with the
    even-more proverbial empty banana, and that we'll have to make
    conditionals based on where Pitt retreats his fleet (i e, to YOR or
    SKA...dare I say it will be the latter)?

    I agree.  However, I said in my reply that I thought you and I needed to
    take out England before we could make any agressive moves in that area.  I
    do think that we might try to keep lines of communication open with Turkey,

    tell anyone anything you want; however, I never saw copies of those

    Persistence (and logic) pays dividends, old chap!  Moves are submitted.
    
    Our planned moves remind me of some ancient Gary Cooper film I saw,
    taking place during WW1.  He pursues some girl who also loves a British
    torpedo boat guy...in the end, the torpedo boat guy (who's wounded in an
    attack on a German ship)  and his lifelong pal (who's blinded by shrapnel
    during same) hug each other, steer their boat into the German ship, and
    blow themselves and the perfidious Hun up.
    
    1) Gary Cooper gets the girl.
    2) You and I will hopefully blow some Hun stuff up without having to hug
    each other (or die in the process).

    I don't exactly understand your alternative suggestion. You can't leave
    Norway if I'm dislodging Germany from Nth, of course. If he did retreat to
    London, though, I would have to guess to get it back, even if I were in Wal
    and Nth, since his new fleet could either support Lon-Nth or cut Nth's
    support of Wal-Lon.
    
    The Nwy S Edi-Nth plan looks a whole lot better to me. (Remember, I don't
    *have* to go Nth-Edi, even if he does retreat to York. He has to guess
    whether I'll (i) cover Edi, or (ii) support myself to hold in Nth.)
    
    Let's stick with that one. That was your conclusion anyway.
    
    I really think this will work out pretty well (considering). I've been
    looking at possible continuations. It's going to look *awfully* tempting to
    France to stick an army in Burgundy, tie a German army to Munich, eject
    Germany from Picardy. And if he does that, he has a good shot at Belgium
    next year (I can offer to cut Dutch support). If we can tempt France at
    all, Germany must devote several units to that problem, and our hands get a
    lot freer. But if Germany continues to occupy Nth, France has no real
    opening and would most likely set sail either for Liverpool or Tunis.
    
    In the mean time, down south: it's not clear to me that you'll lose control
    of Galicia. Austria has to use a lot of units to defend against an Italian
    attack. I really hope Cal makes a good (lucky) move. There's an obvious
    one, which if successful puts him in a really good position against Edi.
    
    If he manages it, Hohn is more likely (don't you think?) to have a try at
    those three Balkans. I'll point out that he really is entitled to them, and
    ask him when Edi is going to turn over Bulgaria....
    
    Well, let's see how it all shakes out.

    Jim,
    Some Russian Spring 1903 thoughts...
    
    Despite my chagrin at being bested byEdi and stabbed by Hohn, and despite
    having to 'grit my teeth' and be dictated to by Hohn the Inflexible,
    Russia remains guardedly optimistic for spring.
    
    Turkey has announced up-front that he wishes to destroy F Bla for
    'security purposes' (no doubt to 'enhance MY security' by putting a
    Turkish one there instead).  He also mentioned that this would be a good
    opportunity for me to kill his A Sev, and thus go +1 in fall.  Now, while
    I certainly can't picture Hohn voluntarily giving up a center, my hope is
    that he intends to cooperate in fall, and make a joint RTI kill on
    Edi...it would warm my cokcles to see such a thing occur.  I proposed a
    butt-busting plan (so did Cal) to Hohn for spring, but Hohn deems it too
    risky for the current level of RT trust, and wants to wait...sigh.  IF
    Turkey's fibbing (and thereby moves Rum-Ukr, Sev r--> Rum), then I could
    be in a big hurt box.  It's all a spring gamble, I reckon.
    
    In the north, I've decided to anger my last unassaulted neighbor, and
    will support England vs Germany's F Nth in spring.  It's sheer lunacy, of
    course, because even if it succeeds, Pitt can retreat to SKA (maybe even
    order Kie-Bal), and make my hold in Scandinavia extremely tenuous.  So
    why do it?  two reasons:
    1) Try and entice France to make a balance-of-power arrangement  vs
    Germany while denying Pit any gains from England;
    2) It's a demo game, and half of the moves should be for enjoyment and
    surprise of the board.  Should they also be logical and "worthy of
    ghods?"  probably.  But I'm not ghod.
    
    So, Russia faces S'03 hoping for Turkish benevolence, English
    cooperation, Italian gains vs A, French turncoating on G, and a gain or
    two, to boot.  The result?  Let's see.

    GKJ,
    Am home, and preparing to go to a cadet sport meeting soon.  before I go,
    however,
    
    just wanted to confirm the support for your Edi-Nth.  My earlier note was
    actually a cut-and-paste attempt run amok, which was one (of many)
    reasons it was hard to decipher.  I was merely saying that if  your
    Cklyde escapade was non-workable, then a move of Ech-Nth (Edi S) and
    iri-Wal gets you around the southern coast, and gives you two to retake
    LON in fall (Nth-Lon, Wal S).  Pitt's second fleet would be neutralized
    and unable to help you, because I'd have ordered Nwy-Ska in spring, and
    moving on den in fall.  It's no biggie, though--as we both noted, we're
    "on' for the attack vs nth, and I'm primed.  So let's see where this
    takes us, ok?

    Cal,
    
    I've been mulling it over, and while Edi's message won't change any of
    my particular moves (which are pretty straightforward; I'm covering
    against Mark and blasting him out of BLA), I'm thinking Edi has a
    point.  I know you'll do whatever you think best, but I believe we
    might need Edi to work with us against the FG.  I don't think we'll be
    able to chew him up quickly enough before France is all over you and
    Germany is all over central Europe.
    
    I urge you to consider Edi's suggestions.  If you decide to continue,
    I'll support your decision, albeit a little reluctantly, to be honest.
    I really do think our chances are better with Edi than without him.
    Then, after we've trimmed FG down a bit, you and I can crunch Edi
    between us like a nutcracker.
    
    Please let me know what you think.
    
    Thanks,
    Hohn

    Apparently no one did.  I didn't get confirmations from the judge, either,
    so it looks like they never made it that far.  Unfortunately for me, I've
    been using the judge confirm as my archive copy and I didn't keep a copy of
    them when they were sent.

    No problem.  I'm not looking for an extension.

    That, too.  I've been scrambling to get things caught up here before I
    leave.  I've been so busy that I didn't have time to check mail from Friday
    to today.
    
    It will be interesting to see how my apparent silence will affect the moves
    of the others.

    Wellllll, I think that your proposal makes sense from your point of view
    (behind Edi that is...) and I even agree that having Edi's centres
    available to build in would be a help against F/G, BUT (and it's a
    biggie),
    I know for sure that I would end up as merely a puppet in a A/I/T
    alliance. I'd be waiting for Edi to pick me off as soon as he felt
    comfortable doing so.  I really, really, really don't want to put myself
    in that situation.
    
    What this all boils down to is this:  I cannot afford to leave a
    potential
    threat behind me, especially one who has reason not to trust me.  I
    STILL
    think that you and I can take Edi down quickly enough to be ready to
    take
    on F/G.  I still have enough influence with Mark to have him work with
    us
    even after you take him down enough to feel comfortable (revenged?
    grin).
    That gives us some leverage, especially when you realize that England
    will
    also help us as much as he can (what other choice does he have?).
    
    I hope that what you said above:
    
    "If you decide to continue, I'll support your decision, albeit a little
    reluctantly, to be honest."
    
    means that you'll still go along with the attack turn after this one.
    If
    not, please let me know what you did mean  (yeah, we're still playing
    Diplomacy, but I can ask, no?  grin).

    Your move looks bad for me. You aren't trying to get Germany out of
    Picardy, you aren't moving in to Burgundy, and you have positioned your
    fleets in a decidedly anti-English posture.
    
    Did you change your mind about your plans? Or maybe you never really did
    plan to sail to the Mediterranean.
    
    I managed to convince Russia to join my cause with his only northern unit.
    I'm pleased that Germany moved to Hel rather than to Den, of course. But it
    certainly seems to me that Russia is not long for this world, unless you
    can do something about his problems. Italy is not doing at all well either,
    a bad guess this last move.
    
    In case it's not obvious, let me say that I would be *more* than happy to
    make moves that would help you get Belgium, and/or help Russia get Denmark,
    in the next year. Too late this year.
    
    As things stand, I have a moderately good chance of holding out for a
    while. Of course, if you do sail into Irish Sea in the Fall, I'll just have
    to choose whom to defend against, or hope that Germany makes me an offer. I
    don't relish that, but naturally I'll do whatever I can to survive.
    
    Cheers!

    Witch,
    
    You still aren't committing, exactly. As far as I can tell, you'll finish
    the year with the same centers as you started, but you'll own Black Sea and
    get to re-think your fleet/army distribution. Interesting. On the other
    hand, with the possible exception of France, nothing much on the board or
    in the alliance structure is changing enough to help you off the fence.
    I'll enter my plea next year, since it's clear you aren't going to shift
    and go for those red Balkan dots this season.
    
    
    Up in my corner I'm anxiously waiting to see which way Germany retreats.
    And anxiously waiting to see where those French fleets are going. I have
    this hunch that the A Mar might go to Piedmont (or what's the point of that
    move otherwise?). But I bet dollars to doughnuts that he won't attack
    Italy....
    
    Cheers!

    >  Why would Hohn (or Edi) even consider helping a weak Russia when they

    For an obvious reason. If the destroy you together, Hohn gets little more
    than he already has out of the deal, and he ends up with a huge Austrian as
    his neighbor. If Hohn can instead grab the Balkans, he gains more than he
    would from invading Russia by land, and he finishes with a weak Russian as
    his neighbor.
    
    I don't know what he'll do, and I don't know what I can say to him, but
    I'll give it a try.

    Nah. The reason for that move was that otherwise, in case Rum-Ukr
    succeeded, your dislodged F Bla would have retreated to Rumania.
    
    >On the Italian front, Edi expected the move all along; rats, I should've

    True. It doesn't look very good for Cal now. Maybe he'd better accept that
    Italian help. :(
    Actually, I think maybe the army in Mar is intended for Piedmont, and maybe
    Tyrolia, to help Italy whether he wants it or not.

    Looks a little worse than that. But you're right, he could go either way.
    (If he moves the F MAO to EngCh, I wouldn't mind that at all. Eyes on
    Belgium.)
    
    >  Will he now jump on our

    I don't know.
    I think the smart thing for him is to help us, that's why I have some hope
    that he'll do it.
    
    You might mention to him that you are quite sure that if he sails Iri, I'll
    try my best to defend Lvp if I'm faced with a choice between that or saving
    one of my other centers from a German attack. (Happens to be true, in case
    you have compunctions about lying to John.) You might suggest MAO-EngCh.
    That at least keeps his options open.

    You can get Tri for Cal by giving up Warsaw, right. Yeesh, what a set of

    Well, no rush, let's think about it. We'll have some guesswork, it might be
    worth taking a little risk. I think my risk-taking inclinations will depend
    on how France 'feels' to me.

    Yeah, good idea, I'll 'have him give me Norway'. "Ok, Pitt, enough

    Well, ok, maybe it wasn't *that* anti-English. (I don't exactly see your
    point about the move to Marseilles. Oh. Mar-Pie-Tyo, maybe.) I guess I feel
    that I need more than neutrality from you to survive. But that's not your

    I know that Cal turned down your offer of naval help. I'll point out to him
    that he's just blown his offensive opportunity and that he might want to
    reconsider your offer.
    
    
    Whatever you decide, if you really intend to save Russia, you'd better act

    Guys:  I haven't had time to review the moves in depth, and won't before
    at least 1100,  but what I see confirms what i expected all along.
    
    Hohn took the deliberately aggressive move to UKR while Edi played on
    Cal's expected move(s), and now they stand to fight for WAR while
    simultaneously booting me from SEV again.   You guys may continue to
    hold out with the "once Hohn gets his last territorial demands in
    Europe..." motif, but I consider this the Fassio version of Munich 1938.
      Why would Hohn (or Edi) even consider helping a weak Russia when they
    have me by the throat?   The 'bounce' of Bul-Rum, while possibly being
    of significance, is (to me) merely a smokescreen to keep luring us to
    believe there's a chance they'll "break up."
    
    On the Italian front, Edi expected the move all along; rats, I should've
    seen his GAL move this turn after he told me he might consider leaving
    me in there (ha!)...should've asked you to hit TRI, Cal.   Now he can
    build in BUD for his sixth.
    
    In the north, Germany stayed true to his word, and, while I certainly am
    not upset for supporting you, Jamie, France has taken a 'fence-sitting'
    plan, to see which way the board went/is going.  Will he now jump on our
    bandwagon and help vs germany?  or will he jump on you now that we're in
    the thick of the fray?  (I can hardly wait for Pitt's "happy telegrams"
    to start arriving...)
    
    As none of us have anything to gain by "ratting out" the other(s) to
    mutual enemies, I'm going to offer, for the Italian front, at least THIS
    consideration, Cal (i mean, AT can see these options as well as we):
    
    The logical Russian move is retreat to War, then:  War S Sev-Ukr, Mos S
    War.  An option:
    
    I retreat Gal-Boh, and hit Vienna in fall.  This gets you Trieste for
    sure.  (Of course, if they write conditionals, then AT use Ukr/Gal to
    take War).  Another option is to do the one-hook version of my earlier
    proposed crazy plan and go to Sil, then try for Berlin.   (Still crazy,
    though).
    
    In the north, we can consider Nth-nwy, Nwy-Swe, in the event he
    retreated to Ska--perhaps achieve mega-bounces all along the line.  OR,
    Jamie, talk to Pitt, convince him that I'm on the outs, make an
    alliance, and you guys boot me from Nwy; have him give you Nwy, and then
    you support him to Swe in fall.  It's really no big deal to me.   No one
    seems to be listening about the AT, so perhaps now, if nothing else, the
    giants will turn east.
    
    Anyway, that's my rambling discourse for now.  BE ADVISED:  new carpet
    is coming in today or tomorrow; if you don't hear from me from this
    address, route thru the juno.com one...I may be "off the net" here for

    King Jean
    Congrats on consolidating your position, and best wishes for future
    movement.  I had asked kaiser Pitt for reassurances that he was indeed
    moving to Helgoland.  He never replied to two notes, so I assumed
    hostility.  In retrospect, I've probably erred, but I'm committed now.
    besides, I can take extra heat off you and Eng by this act, and maybe
    get him to see the danger looming in the East.  There, despite my
    protestations and alarms, the AT continues to run rampant.  I now face
    the obvious prospect of not only losing SEV again, but having to guard
    WAR from capture!  And Hohn maoned about my 'stabs' of him...pah.
    
    Anyway, PLEASE consider throwing your substantial power toward the
    suppression of the Kaiser.  To me (anyway), having a weak and repentant
    England on one side of you--and a preoccupied and stagnant Italy on the
    other--allows you the chance to use E and R as loyal subalterns, as the
    three of us find a way to keep the German giant from looming large.  I
    mean, you can have a good FG, move to Iri (which England will probably
    bounce), and fight the good fight vs Jamie.  But I'd ask you to please
    consider moving to Ech instead.  With Mao-Channel, you have a Lon
    option, a Bel option, and a return to Wal/iri option, no matter what
    side of the fence you later come down on.
    
    I shall continue to wish good things for the French people, and hope you
    can pass along some good words about the logic of an RT vs A, should
    Hohn be on your mailing list.. take care.

    Tsar Faz,
    
    I don't have much to say until I see the retreats, that's the main reason
    I'm quiet. There doesn't seem to be any hurry at all to plot tactics.
    
    About Turkey:
    I agree, there is no way he will switch sides on this next move, it wouldn't
    make sense. I figure he'll do the obvious, safe move: Ukr-Mos, Con-Bul, and
    Bla S Arm-Sev.
    The time for him to make a move on the Balkans would be next year. Once he's
    got Sev nice and secured, the possible gains to him of continuing against
    you dwindle. He could only hope for one more center of yours, Moscow. Surely
    he'd rather have the three remaining Balkans instead.

    This is not a big deal, so I feel comfortable mentioning it.... long

    GKJ,
    You've been a quiet one lately, as have I, it seems  -- at least in
    contrast to earlier correspondence levels.  While I'm working lesson
    plans, I get the image of the AT crushing me like a bug, and was just
    wondering if you have any ideas for the Northern front?  I still lean
    toward the Nwy-Swe, Nth-nwy option, although I admit to laziness in
    working through any other more concrete plans.  As always, I value your
    opinions.
    
    I have a hunch you will ling outlive me here.  I see the German behemoth
    using at least two pieces (Mun + Hel or retreated Nth) to come after me
    (especially if there's an FG), and AT show NO signs of breaking up.
    >From a cost-benefit side, Hohn would be a fool to join me.  If he does,
    he goes at least -1 (I get SEV) and only a 50-50 chance regarding
    keeping RUM and a 75-25 getting BUL (would require Italian Ion-Gre).
    If he stays with Edi, there's a chance RI will reduce Edi; Hohn stays
    even (Arm-Sev, Bla S), and one of them builds off of WAR, perhaps.   I
    dunno, I'm having a hard time thinking of anything than continued RT
    emnity...the little weasel hasn't even written me yet this turn!   Have
    you heard from him yet?
    
    Anyway, have a good Easter weekend, Jamie.  I'll be on the juno.com
    line, and will be lying low.  Take care.

    Cal,
    I'm not averse to helping you vs Edi and getting your  5th center.  My
    only concern is that you may end up pushing AT even closer together,
    because now they have to push through a stronger Italy, as opposed to a
    weaker one.  Of course, we both assume (and hope for) the converse--that
    Austria perhaps sees you as unassailable, and worries over being
    crunched (thus making a deal), or perhaps Turkey sees you as a viable
    option to killing Edi.  Who knows?   The idea, though, is that ONE of us
    needs to get some centers.  As I've enraged Germany (and can't get any
    of his stuff) and won't hit England, then my only hope is a Turkish aid
    program -- which we both seem to doubt will ever occur.  So the logical
    alternative is to help you get strong.
    
    There are only two minor concerns with that (and they're both truly
    minor).  One is that AT see this coming (I wish we could combine
    retreats and moves, like in PBM, and make them guess, rather than having
    a week to act on the retreats); if that happens, they they get Edi into
    WAR to keep him solvent and "defuse" your gain.  I can, however, take
    moves to minimize/negate that possibility.
    The other disadvantage is perhaps being seen by the rest of the players
    (of the observers) as an erratic nutcase who's wrecking this by playing
    a "throw the game" strategy.  I mean, it's "minor" because I frankly
    don't give a s**t what people say or think, but some may not see this as
    a "logical" or "ghod-like" approach for the game.  Oh well, no biggie.

    Hell, if you're gonna go out, go out in style, no?  Can't say I've never

    Can't say I am sure what he's doing either.  I've been burning up
    cyberspace trying to get him to pull a surprise attack on Edi and,
    while he makes some positive noises, I'm not sure he's sincere (gee,
    what a surprise!).  His attitude towards you, when he mentions it, is
    pretty much what he's saying to you - he wants security and intends
    to keep crunching you til he gets (whatever he conceives to be) it.

    I would be ecstatic if you would retreat to Boh and help me get Trieste.
    At four centres, I'm just so much cannon fodder should A/T decide to
    attack me.  I'd survive two years at most if I'm lucky.  With that fifth
    center, not to mention the strategic position I'd gain by the incursion
    into the Austrian, I'd have a better chance at A) surviving; B) gaining
    leverage in convincing that Edi CAN be taken down.

    Hi Cal
    
    Wanted to sound you out on our joint possibilities again, as well as to
    seek your opinion on my retreat.
    Having no doubt enraged Germany by my support of England, I imagine I'll
    have opened up yet another front against me.  Can't say the thought
    didn't cross my mind when I did it, heh heh... this game is an
    incredible sink on my schedule, and I won't lose sleep if I'm mugged and
    eliminated quickly.  Having said that, though, my intent is to play it
    with a combination of abandon, pseudo-creativity, and loyalty to allies.
    
    
    As for allies, Hohn, in my opinion, is not, nor will ever seek to be, an
    ally.  He's  practicing pure Hitelrian tactics a la 1935-1939, slicing
    territory off in increments, each time promising to negotiate "once his
    security concerns are addressed."  Heck, if he's still insecure, maybe
    I'd better abandon Mos and War, too.
    
    I mean, doing a cost-benefit analysis, what are Hohn's choices?
    1) Ally with me, letting me keep SEV (so he goes -1 already), and then
    seeing if he can keep RUM and turn south to hit Edi -- giving him a
    50-50 chance of keeping RUM (Ukr-Rum), and a 75-25 chance of taking BUL
    (assumes you'd go Ion-Gre).   Or...
    2)  Joint AT attacks on WAR and SEV.  (Bla S Arm-Sev, and Ukr S Gal-War
    [of vice versa])
    Hohn gets to keep Rum and Sev, and may or may not get War (either he or
    Edi would).  he loses nothing, and perhaps gains one....opening up the
    route to Mos and beyond next year!
    
    I dunno....anyway, I'm heading off to class, but wanted to say that I'm
    fully prepared to consider retreating to BOH, then hitting Vie while you
    go Ven-Tri (Adr S).  You'll go +1. If they do conditionals and get me,
    fine.  Pitt will probably take SWE, so I'll get reduced--but still be
    viable.

    Hello Hohn
    
    Am "most" curious as to your thoughts on the spring results.  While I'm
    obviously looking forward to RT cooperation, I sense unease, given that
    you're in UKR, Edi's in GAL, etc.  I have a couple move ideas, but will
    withhold comment and/or proposals until next note.

    I think we have to risk pushing A/T closer together.  It isn't like they
    could GET much closer, so we have to depend on making a sneak attack on
    Edi by Hohn appear that much more attractive.  Slim hope, but probably
    the one with the best "potential" right now.

    Well, it's certainly not my place to ask you to put your own centres at
    risk, but my above paragraph still applies.  Hopefully you CAN

    What I really wanted to do was to sensitize the Judge rookies to the

    What I did do was decide not to permit grey/anonymous press of the sort

    More weirdness.  I sent in my signon as a player a day prior to my signon
    as an observer.  I don't recall getting a confirmation from the judge, now
    that I think about it.  I'll send it again.

    No problem here.  I'm not clear on what we're discussing, though.  Is there
    a suggestion that press should not be copied?  If so, let me start the
    discussion by saying that, while I don't much care one way or the other
    since I rarely, if ever, copy press from one player to another, I don't see
    any problem with players who wish to do so.  After all, it's just as easy
    to creatively edit the press as it is to send it whole.  Any player who
    accepts copied press at face value deserves what he gets...no?

    My last note was quite confused.  I'll try again....
    
    
    A few items:
    
    If you want to have a pre-game discussion, I'd suggest you join the game as
    an observer to do this discussion and resign in the same message:
    
    >signon oghodstoo password
    >broadcast
    >This is my message......
    >endbroadcast
    >resign
    
    
    Do you mind press/comments from non-players?  heh, heh, heh...
    
    
    When you first create a game, you are a player, not the "master".  When you
    do the "become master" command, then you are no longer a player, but
    sometimes the judge treats you as a player for a bit longer (the warning
    about the preference list).  This is a non-critical judge bug...
    
    
    I've got another e-mail address JUST IN CASE the
    "kleiman.indianapolis.in.us" domain goes down.  It is associated with my
    job, so use in in emergencies only. "dkleiman@questis.com".  I do monitor

    Ok.
    
    Well, to make Mondays available, you just set the DAYS.
    
        set movement days -mTWTF-
    
    The lowercase 'm' allows deadlines to fall only after noon Mondays;
    otherwise they can fall, say, at 1:48 am Monday morning, which people
    generally feel is still the weekend.
    
    And you'd send a similar set for the other two phases, adjustment and retreat.
    
    But see how everyone feels about it first, of course.
    
    You have four day movement phase deadlines, one day for retreats, and two
    days for adjustments. Is that what you meant to have? I thought you wanted a
    week just for movement. This way suits me much better.
    
    However, I suggest that you cut a half hour off each NEXT parameter. I'll
    explain why if you like (it's a bit hard to explain), or you could just
    trust me. :)
    
    The other parameters look fine.

    Simple enough.  liv is not a valid abbreviation for Livonia.  lvn is the
    correct abbreviation.  In order to provide for flexibility, the judge is
    also programmed to accept: livo,lvo,lva and of course, the long-form   Livonia.
    
    Liverpool can be abbreviated by  lvp, livp lpl and Liverpool
    
    (personally I can never remember the syntax, and judge write out
    Liverpool and Livonia each time ...  )
    
    
    
    So Russia could have written
    a pru s a lvn
    a mos s a lvn
    a lvn s a pru
    
    Of course, the judge is quite flexible, and will accept
    pru s lvn
    mos s lvn
    lvn s pru

    Umm, Edi is sending some good messages, but I will remind him that he

    Edi, you need to do things with Austria as your country...
    
    that means:
    
    signon aghodstoo <password>
    ...
    
    Hohn will also show you how to access the Register files to get people's
    phone numbers, if he doesn't I will.
    
    This is a good time to remind people that phone calls ARE
    allowed in this game.  We discussed that during the setup period.
    People are not required to make or accept phone calls though.
    This is an intentional part of the cultural experiment on

    I made a phone call to X and we discussed X or other thoughts to be

    am for doing this.  He ran the first ghods game.

    It seems that the Sultan has already risen from the Dead and Easter has not
    even arrived yet.  Then again as he is a simple pagan heathen savage as
    opposed to a heretic traitor to Rome it may not be time for
    crucifixions....then again maybe he can aspire to that mantle.
    
    Speaking of mantle, I will be visiting Mickey's home state on Feb 6 to hold a
    Legends gathering in Houston, anyone around there at that time?
    
    Will also be going off to Sweden at the end of March for the World DipCon.

    IMPORTANT MESSAGE: PLEASE READ CAREFULLY!
    
    Well, things are off to a smashing start... Hohn has made Edi into
    a Judge technology wary beast through his mistakes in dealing
    with forwarding mail, not once, but TWICE!  Does everyone have that
    straight now?  Be careful from whence you copy and reply to things!!
    I want to thank Hohn for providing our new Judge guys an example
    of what NOT to do ;-)
    
    What I really want to do here, though, is to be clear about what the
    demo nature of this game will mean -- now and in the future.
    
    1) I am seeing all press between players that is occuring through
    the Judge.  I am archiving ALL of that press for future use.  I
    also am saving all press and E-Mail related to the game that is occuring
    outside of the Judge which is forwarded to me.  The general preference
    is that all communication occur through the Judge because then this
    happens automatically; however, with the problems between Edi and
    Hohn i don't want to be dictatorial about this.  Edi has been good
    about CCing me, and I think that nothing important has yet been lost.
    Please, let's keep it that way.
    
    2) I have been writing a series of articles for Diplomacy World over
    the last couple of years on the role of Personality in Diplomacy.
    I view this game as an experiment on some aspects of that issue.
    I will be writing an article on the game with that focus AFTER it is
    over.  Some of the rest of you have inquired about writing your own
    articles and having access to that complete press stream to do so.
    I am indifferent on this request.  There is no need to decide now,
    but keep that question in mind.  I certainly encourage the writing
    of additional articles.
    
    3) In a related point, some of the novice observers want to have access
    to the complete press stream after the game is over, so they can learn
    by the subtleties of how you all have done things over the course
    of the game.  I am inclined to the negative on this request, but can
    easily be dissuaded to the positive.  Certainly, your public endgame
    statements would be archived through the Diplomatic Pouch web page
    along with the game history so that people could look at that at
    a minimum.
    
    4) To add to that complete press stream, I have already been asking
    that you relate to me  (in private "press to m") the gist of phone
    calls that take place.  This already has been happening to my
    satisfaction and I hope it will continue.  In addition, I will
    encourage seasonal and yearly reports to me on some of your background
    thinking as you go along.  There is no need to repeat to me what is
    obvious from the press stream, but to add what is NOT obvious from it.
    Again, here so far, I feel that I am being adequately informed but
    when the tactical/strategic situations get more intricate, i may
    begin prodding you to write more.  You may want to save a copy of
    these statements for your own public endgame statements as well.
    
    5) After some discussion, we have decided that the observers are free
    to write press discussing what they see going on.  I'm reserving the
    right to reign them in if they get out of control.
    
    6) The public broadcast releases (at least most of them) will be
    merged together and published in my postal/E-Mail Diplomacy
    szine, The Abyssinian Prince, along with complete season by season
    game reports and maps.  The szine is a three week szine and should be
    able to keep up with the game fairly well.... at least it did with the
    previous demo game.  I offer to the players in this game free
    subscriptions as a perk for the life of the game.  For E-Mail
    subs, they are free to anyone by sending the message:
    
    subscribe tap
    
    to majordomo@diplom.org
    The disadvantage to this is that E-Mail subs come in the szine's
    source code which bothers some people (e.g. Pitt) a lot and some
    people not at all.  Postscript versions also are available on
    diplom.org's archive site.  Ordinary postal subs are a dollar per issue,
    but as I said, I want to give you players a perk for your willingness
    to do this.  Let me know your preference for being added to the postal
    mailing list.
    
    Thanks!

    Quite different, I think.
    
    Let me distinguish between *vague* criteria, on the one hand, and
    *unenforceable* criteria, on the other. A criterion could be unenforceable
    because it is vague, of course. In that case, I agree it is a defective
    criterion, but I say it is defective primarily because it is vague.
    
    The 'abuse and profanity' rule may be defective on grounds of vagueness.
    
    The 'no negotiations with late powers' rule is not defective on grounds of
    vagueness, because it is not vague at all.
    
    I don't think this kind of unenforceability is a defect, especially not in
    our game.
    
    You have given a good reason to avoid vague criteria, I agree with you
    about that. Is there a good reason to avoid criteria that are not vague but
    are for some other reason unenforceable? I don't know what it is.
    
    
    >Impossible to Enforce: by attempting to enforce this rule, to me
    >the GM is injecting himself or herself into the game and is chasing

    I think this is due to the vagueness of that particular standard, though.
    
    
    (Me, somewhat flippantly)
    >> I myself implore all of the players to be reasonable at all times. I mean,

    (Jim)
    >And that is the rule which I believe I can apply in a fair, even,
    >and impartial manner.
    
    Actually, I think the opposite. I think that standard is awfully vague. Or
    do you propose to define 'reasonable'??
    
    My objections to vague criteria (or standards) outrun yours. To me, what is
    important is that someone who *wants* to follow the rules know exactly what
    he has to do to follow them. Obviously, vagueness prevents this.
    
    Then a special difficulty arises, above and beyond enforceability and
    fairness. It's that a player always has to worry that by taking the
    standard in a stricter sense than others take it, he puts himself at a real
    disadvantage in the game. So there is an incentive to push at the line. And
    this is bound to lead to trouble.
    
    A clear standard that cannot be fully enforced does *not* lead to this
    difficulty, I think. We may reasonably assume that other players don't need
    to be threatened with sticks by the gm to get them to follow a clear rule.
    At least, I am willing to assume this, and I think there's good reason to
    assume it.
    
    
    
    -Jamie
    
    (Pardon me if this sounds obsessive. I'm in the middle of reading a book
    about vagueness!)

    One relevant discussion during the long house rules debate of a few
    years ago was on the matter of "abuse and profanity".  The original
    idea was that "personal abuse" should be disallowed.  I argued that
    the rule was both impossible to define and impossible to enforce
    (slightly different concepts).
    
    Impossible to Define: the only sociological definition to this I've
    ever seen is the difference between saying someone is "acting like
    a horse's ass" as opposed to saying someone IS "a horse's ass".
    If that were the definition of abuse, I would accept it, although
    I like stepping on that definitional line at times.
    
    Impossible to Enforce: by attempting to enforce this rule, to me
    the GM is injecting himself or herself into the game and is chasing
    a moving target.  I really should add "enforcing in a level, fair, and
    impartial way".  Some people's level of "abuse" is very low and other
    people;'s level is very high.  I think it then becomes part of the
    game.  As you, Jamie, are aware, Dan Shoham and I went back and forth
    on this at length for months at that time.

    Hi Jamie & Cal
    Just a short note to reply to your last.  Hope your easter weekend is
    going well; I'll be doing easter egg hunts and the usual stuff today and
    tomorrow.
    
    Wanted to ask you what you thought of these two options.   Some (most) of
    this is rehash, but I'm still curious as to your opinions:
    
    Option 1:			Option 2:
    r-->Boh			r-->War
    Boh-Vie			War S Sev-Ukr
    Mos-War			Sev-Ukr
    Sev-Ukr			Mos  S War
    Nwy-Swe			Nwy-Swe
    
    Option 1 is risky, but gives me more "hurt potential" vs AT.  If I do
    option 1, Trieste is gone for sure--at least for a turn!  Edi probably
    retreats to Tyo, Hohn possibly gives him War or Rum as compensation, and
    he still goes +1 and builds vs Cal.  The froint then becomes filled with
    one more army each while, chillingly, Turkey probably uses his destroyed
    army to rebuild F Smy, thus giving them ION soon.  But that's the 'down"
    part.  The positive side is that it's an innovative move that depends on
    no one but me to fail (ha ha), gets Cal one, and may keep Edi even (thus
    enticing Hohn to perhaos take advantage of his momentary weakness).
    
    The only disadvantage for me is if they use Ukr-War (Gal S), which Edi
    will want to have happen if he sees Tri gone...but which Hohn may not
    desire, thus causing friction.   If they do that, I can't stop them.
    
    if I guess right, then Hohn tries Ukr-Mos (the standard cut of SEV), and
    I bounce him there, bounce Edi in War (or get it myself) and rebuild the
    destroyed Bla and current A Sev into two builds (probably playing one
    short, because my centers are covered).
    
    Option 2 is the conservative option.  It doesn't help Cal, but protects
    me.  Warsaw is saved.   I maintain a linear front, Sev dies (again, of
    course), and I rebuild a unit in STP, thus forming a psuedo-wall...until
    spring, when they put one on Mos to cut support, and then use Ukr-War
    (Gal S) to break the line!
    
    Short of "benevolent" German aid (ha!) in the form of Mun-Sil and then
    defending me in War (figure the odds), the simple truth of the matter is
    that AT will NOT pass up this "vulture" opportunity to kill me, and that
    in spring, they will have the potential to seize WAR.  Hence my
    lassaize-faire attitude toward my lifespan on the board -- at this stage,
    it might be better for me if I just throw you guys some centers, a la the
    old QC.  I *do* have honor toward allies as my baseline modus operandi,
    even if I'm occasionally goofy in showing it....
    
    You guys let me know how you see this, and speak your cases (Cal, I know
    your reply  -grin-).
    
    Take care, and hope to hear from you soon.

    King Jean
    Happy Easter weekend!  This will be short, as egg hunts and basket-making
    await...hope you're doing well.
    
    As I mentioned in previous notes, I sure would appreciate some
    anti-German action. If you were after him, you could go Mar-Bur, Bre-Pic
    (Par S), Mao-Ech.  England is defending himself, Germany is preoccupied
    with E (and now, probably, me...sigh).  You'd secure your borders and
    have everyone by the , ahem, 'short-and-curlies,' able to dictate French
    desires with a little more "oomph."
    
    Having said that, I would understand if you thought English death was
    better for you, and that you need Germany as an ally vs the
    rapidly-growing AT alliance.   Those guys will -- absolutely will -- take
    War next spring (retake Sev now, then have sev-Mos, followed by Ukr-War,
    Gal S).  Once that happens,Germany's flank is caved in, and you may not
    want to see that....I don't know.   if you stick with Germany, you'll
    probably need to go Mar-Pie, if only to buttress Italy and head off Edi's
    westward advance.   (You can always stab Italy later if you see the
    opening.)
    
    So, King Jean, be advised I will fight AT to the end, but the end is,
    unfortunately, coming rather quickly.  If I don't get help from some
    western quarter, you'll be fighting Turkish galleys soon.
    
    Happy Easter!

    I agree that this is quite different; however, I was trying to establish
    a point of comparison.  In retrospect, I was trying to do this mostly
    for myself and I probably should have refrained from "thinking out loud".
    While there is no requirement for consistency.... hobgoblin of little
    minds and all that.... as a GM, I like to try to sketch out my parameters
    so people are not surprised by what I do.  As you also must have gathered,
    I like to be "present" without unduly "influencing" the game.  This is
    a recognized balancing act on my part.   It's also why I don't like
    GMing novice games, since they require a different style.  Anyway, that's
    a long way of saying, yes, I accept the criticism.

    >
    I think it is defective on grounds of vagueness, but even if we agreed on
    the definition of abuse and profanity (I suggested that a reasonable
    distinction, though not without controversy, would be made between
    inserting "like" or "as" into any description or insult vs. saying
    someone IS whatever) it could not be enforced because it could be
    undertaken surreptiously and it could be faked.  Someone trying
    to raise the level of the game could use a rule against abuse and
    profanity as a weapon.  I would prefer as GM to say: "You're on your
    own, deal with it as you will".
    
    > The 'no negotiations with late powers' rule is not defective on grounds of

    >
    That is correct.  It still suffers from the same unenforceability problem.
    You could make a phone call, or E-Mail privately.  Then one could complain
    to me that such activity happened, even providing tapes or E-Mail proofs,
    that were faked.  This sort of activity draws the GM into the game in a
    way in which I am not inclined.  But you are correct that such activity
    would not suffer from a vagueness criteria.
    
    The other aspect, other than drawing the GM in, is that mutually
    consenting moves outside of the rule will likely not be reported at all.
    Both of those aspects are relevant to me.  I would rather avoid making
    rules that people might be tempted to break and I would rather avoid
    making rules that (in a sort of Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle sort
    of way) could affect outcomes in the game by asking for my rulings.

    Oh.... must I?  Now (recall, for the overwhelmed) we are talking about
    defining reasonable reasons for deadline extensions.  Here we are talking
    about something else entirely.  This is a hobby and as such "real life"
    has a call greater than a Diplomacy deadline.  I don't want to get into
    judging work and home constraints on people.  Therefore, reasonable issues
    are defined by players with my involvement only to the extent necessary.
    These vaguenesses are essentially "out-of-game" realities to me.  And
    that's why their analysis differs fundamentally from the other things
    we are discussing.
    
    My important point here is that Diplomacy GMs have a disturbing
    tendency at times to believe that only they have a real life
    outside the hobby.  I grant (in fact insist) that everyone does.
    And then, the fact that the games are supposed to be "fun" is
    relevant.  To blindly hold to a rule, that "ruins" the fun
    of the game, is not fun for anyone.  That's my standard and it
    is by definition vague.

    Yes, that is certainly true.  I am cognizant of shifting the playing field
    such that this comment does not look as relevant.  It still is relevant.
    It is possible under this sort of standard for people in the game to
    use personal life "excuses" to manipulate the game.  Here is where your
    trust issue where you say that you don't want to be using tactics that
    are not "permitted" is relevant.  I will state this clearly:
    
    "Don't use issues in your personal life, either real or fabricated,
    to manipulate the GM into changing deadlines for reasons stemming from
    WITHIN the game."
    
    I still realize that is vague.  This stems from my attempt to be
    clear but not to paint myself into a corner.

    Hm, that's not exactly what I was doing.
    
    I was intending not to submit orders until I got some definite answer; I
    was not intending just to hold up the game as a kind of leverage. (That
    would be silly. It would never work. :-))
    
    To be a bit more thorough:
    I knew that Russia was going to try the "Well, sorry, we just didn't have
    enough time before the deadline to work everything out trick". He'd already
    stalled right up to the deadline. But I was confident because I knew I
    could press him even afterward. Not my favorite move, but legal, so it's
    another arrow in the quiver, as far as I'm concerned.
    
    
    
    >I certainly do understand that rule, I just don't like to have
    >essentially unenforceable rules.  You always could resort to
    >off judge press and what of phone calls?
    
    Oh, sure, you could.
    
    But, that would be cheating. I don't expect cheating in my games, and I
    don't think you should expect it in this game. Yes, it has occurred, one or
    another kind of cheating. Myself, I think it's a shame to create a lot of
    hassles for everyone just to prevent those few cheaters. And I'm sure you'd
    have nothing to worry about here. (Virtual 'here'.)
    
    > Players in my postal
    >szine very commonly call other players after the deadline before
    >calling or E-Mailing me their orders.
    
    Well, I don't know what to say. Is that cheating? I would absolutely refuse
    to talk to anyone under those circumstances. It's a game, after all!
    
    To me (as I said), there's cheating, which is doing something against the
    rules, and there's taking advantage of every little trick, which I do
    especially when pressed to the wall, and the latter is absolutely nothing
    like the former. Again, I think it's admirable to squeeze every last drop
    out of the rules when you're in a bind.
    
    
    >Absolutely.
    
    Good.
    
    >> I'm not sure I really understand your thinking. You are allowing grace
    >> period negotiation, but you don't really want anyone to do it? Sorry, I

    >I want you to request an extension, but then I don't want you to waste
    >time waiting for me to grant an extension before you go on negotiating.
    >I thought that was clear, but it probably wasn't.
    
    I think I get it.
    
    Do you think you could just make this a rule? An unenforceable one, but I
    predict with extreme confidence that enforcement won't be a problem.
    
    So, let's see. The rule would be:
    if the deadline has passed and for some reason or other (restriction on
    permissible reasons?) you want more time, submit a request to the gm for
    more time, inform others (whomever you want) that you've submitted the
    request, then continue at will. If the extension is granted, fine. If not,
    then everyone has to shut up and submit moves.
    
    Look, this might be simplest. Why don't you just ask the players to accept
    the more standard house rule, by acclamation, as it were? Oh, right,
    because you don't want everyone to have to wait around for you to check in
    and move the deadline.
    
    Well, do it how you think best, of course. You know now that if I think it
    will help me out of a jam, I'll push right up to the line, but never tread
    over it.

    Hi Hohn
    On the serious side, Happy Easter, and hope you're enjoying the weekend.
    
    On the NOT-so-serious 'razzing' side:   what's the matter; why so silent
    this turn?  Waiting for Edi to come home, to synchronize your stories?
    Can't think up any more lies to sucker me with?  (Oh wait, I forgot,
    lawyers don't lie; they "selectively apply known truths," as one lawyer
    mentioned in a recent article.   The military calls that 'quibbling,' and
    it's cause for dismissal from the Academies.  I imagine legal eagles call
    it 'part of the profession.'   Ah, semantics.  But I digress; I'm not
    here for semantics, and you've heard enough lawyer-bashing in the past,
    I'm sure.)
    
    Anyway, here goes:
    1) It seems to me obvious that you once again lied through your teeth to
    cover your true intent, that of smashing me with Edi.  Clearly, you'd be
    a fool to let me keep SEV (reducing you by one), ally with me, and then
    try to somehow stab Edi with your current positioning.  But you knew that
    before you even made your moves.   The only thing you could possibly get
    now would be BUL (and that assumes Ion-Gre) and a hopeful bounce in RUM.
    By staying the course with Aus, you can have War and/or Mos in a couple
    turns -- not to mention retaking Sev, rebuilding your army with a F Smy,
    and starting the ol' westward fleet movements.  One nice, long, linear
    front, from Mos to the Ionian....smooth, baby, smooth.
    
    But _please,_ if I'm wrong in that assessment, enlighten me.  Dig deep.
    :>)
    
    Oh, btw, is "inflexible" spelled with one "b", or two?
    
    2)  In light of (1), I have to decide who to throw centers to, and how
    quickly.  I can retreat to WAR and hold the line for another 1-2 turns,
    waiting for Pitt to get into SIL and SWE (that support of Eng should
    finally goad him into coming east).    Or I can retreat to BOH and make
    life interesting for Edi....perhaps even go Sev-Rum to deny him RUM, and
    then watch him go -1 this turn....darn the luck.
    
    "Game face sarcasm" aside, I return to the serious side, Hohn.  You're a
    great player (as are the rest of these sharks).  My biggest goal now is
    to see the breakup of AT.   I can't seem to persuade you to abandon Edi
    voluntarily, because quite honestly it's not (yet) in your best interests
    to do so.  So I'll 'sweeten the pot.'  If I can get centers for I and G,
    that blocks Edi's westward routes and perhaps forces you to negotiate
    with them (at least with Cal)...or perhaps 'go around Edi' to get to the
    west, who knows.
    And if Edi is beset upon by RI and loses one...and if you're gaining at
    the same time, well....Maybe, just maybe, you'll give him some of the
    same treatment you gave me.  I won't be around to see it, but the mere
    knowledge a stab might occur is enough to let me happily leave this game
    en route to greener pastures.   Me helping you--even if you don't
    want/expect it--via either direct or indirect means--is one way I can
    throw a punch this game (however weak and ineffectual).  And actually
    help you.  Really.
    
    Anyway, gotta go; I have to go pick up some cadets coming up for Easter
    dinner, and then do some stuff with the kids today (i.e., 'screw all the
    office work I brought home').  It's a sunny day, and life is short.
    
     Hope your day is equally laid-back and/or enjoyable.  Take care, my
    friend.

    Hi Pitt
    First off, Happy Easter, even though you may not read this until later.
    I hope WorldCon was a blast, and that you did very well there.
    
    Secondly, I understand your pobably confusion and anger this game, given
    that I supported England and ruined your convoy.  Part of it was simple
    suasion:  EF were writers this turn, and England (especially) offered
    plans and ideas.  Your note asked if I was still "on" for our dealings,
    and when I wrote back and asked (twice) about  your fleet intent (i.e.,
    Kie-Hel or Kie-Den), you never answered.  I got a little paranoid.
    
    In retrospect, I shouldn't have supported England (obviously), but quite
    honestly, I couldn't see any gain for me either way --  and thought that
    if EF got the upper hand, I could at least pick a center up to keep me at
    my shoestring level.  Anyway, my error.
    
    The future is now the key question.  Quite honestly,  one of the
    'benefits' to angering you is that perhaps now you'll send something east
    to address the AT threat -- heckuva way for me to get everyone's
    attention regarding the unbreakable Edi & Hohn, but the alternative was
    trying to go it alone.  Anyone who still thinks Hohn will be lured from
    The Dark Side and let me have SEV while he hits Edi is out of touch.
    
    I envision Gal/Ukr working together vs War (or Mos) while Arm/Bla retake
    Sev.  Then, with alinear front (Gal/Sev/Ukr), they WILL take War in
    spring, and possibly Mos in fall.  Oh sure, I can rebuild one destroyed
    unit in STP, but it's a downhill slide, Pitt.
    
    How does this affect us?  Simple.
    1) I'm not after you anymore; I'm covering Sweden this turn, and
    "collapsing inwardly."  If you want to try for Nwy, have at it.
    2) I have a decision concerning my retreat.  if I play "fire sale" and
    throw my remaining centers to you and Cal, then I forget War and retreat
    to Boh, ensuring Cal gets TRI.  If I play conservative, then I retreat to
    WAR and hold the front for one more full season (big deal).   Your ideas?
    3) I think--after watching France sit on the sidelines this turn, and
    judging the "gain" potential of the three Western powers--that you should
    sail for Nwy and move Mun-Sil, ASAP.  Oh, I know your immediate thought:
    "you suckered me this turn, and now you expect me to uncover Mun?  Yeah,
    right."   You'd be normal to think that, but I've decided that AT must be
    delayed and/or punished as much as I can humanly do, before I fade from
    this game.  if that means you in WAR and NWY as I die, great.  Quite
    honestly, I'm overtaxed at work and  at home, and I won't cry big tears
    if I'm the first one eliminated in game.  And if that's the case, then
    YOU and Cal are most deserving of what I have to offer.  Yours to
    consider, and act upon, Pitt.  No foolin' here.

    Gentlemen,
    
    I am very wary about inserting my preferences about what really should be
    your decisions. I guess I kind of like the riskier option, if you want my
    opinion. But I think the conservative option also has virtues.
    
    To my mind, the point of the coming move ought to be to arrange things to
    provide the most incentive to Hohn to switch sides. If robbing Edi of
    Trieste will do that, then I think it's worth the risk. If playing
    conservatively leaves enough incentive already for Hohn to head to the
    Balkans, then I'd do that, I guess.
    
    Though I am on reasonably good terms with Hohn, he hasn't given me much of
    a hint about his future plans. The general impression I have is that he's
    taking this year to re-arrange and secure his position, and will make his
    big decision next year. But I just don't know what the important factors in
    his decision will be.
    
    Putting myself in Hohn's shoes, I think what would most tempt me to attack
    Austria's centers next year would be a combination of (1) Austria beginning
    to gain ascendancy in the south (the motivation of fear), and (2) the
    prospect of a fairly quick, fruitful attack (the motivation of greed).
    
    When I say 'quick, fruitful," I mean by comparison with continuing to
    attack Russia, which doesn't promise very much additional gain; and if he
    did go ahead with it, his units would not be in a very good position to do
    much of anything but attack Austria next anyway.
    
    If I learn anything relevant from Hohn, I'll be sure to pass it along. I'm
    sure you won't tell me what you ultimately decide, and I neither need nor
    want to know! (Ok, I want to know just out of curiosity, but I'm patient,
    my curiosity has no problem waiting to see the actual moves.)

    I don't get this at all. It is obviously unenforceable. If you don't want
    to have an unenforceable rule, this would be a perfect example of a rule
    you should not have. On the other hand, if one doesn't mind unenforceable
    rules as long as they are not vague, then it seems to me that my suggestion
    is vastly preferable.

    It is possible that the level of the game may rise in this way so that the
    vast majority of cases becomes irrelevant.  It takes only one relevant
    case to make things happen that I will regret.  Thus, I will not make
    such a rule.

    I didn't really word that very well, but here's another more complete
    explanation.  If you cite a personal/computer access reason for a
    deadline extension in a request to me, I will accept it, no questions
    asked.  This is enforceable because you tell me you need it and I
    accept your request.  The "guideline" above is not a rule because it
    is unenforceable.  It is an example of a rule that you told me you
    would try to follow if you could, even though it is vague.  If you don't
    want to follow it and make too many deadline extension requests....
    well, then, hmmmm, what could be done about that?
    
    I realize that you and I are not on the same page here.  You also are not
    nudging me toward your page.  i also am not putting really careful
    thought into exactly how I say these things and realize that unclarity
    or vagueness is contributing to your confusion.
    
    It comes down to this (which I hope is clear, yet vague): All things are
    in play, and this is play -- not work -- not home -- not family -- all
    three of which are more important than play in the instant, yet without
    play neither work nor home nor family are possible. [all apparent
    contradictions and vagueness intended]

    Thoughts on this past season.
    
    Well, I knew I should have gone with my gut and moved SEV-RUM with
    support from Edi's BUL (assuming he would have gone for it, which I
    think he would have) as well as RUM-UKR.  My gut has been right most
    of the time so far.  It predicted Italy's move, and I'm glad Edi took
    my advice of TRI-ALB with support.
    
    I'm going to indeed take SEV back, and I plan on building a fleet to
    start moving west.  As for Mark, I question the effectiveness of his
    press to me this turn.  To be honest, the first portion grated on me.
    But he does seem a bit more realistic now, and thus I leave the door
    open for possible cooperation with him in the future, assuming I'm not
    so far into his country that that becomes impossible.
    
    I'm still planning on sticking with Edi.  I suspect I'll be in prime
    position to stab him soon, though, assuming things shake down a
    certain way (a way which has a reasonable possibility of happening, I
    feel).  At which time I'll probably take that opportunity.

    Mark,
    
    Sorry for my silence.  This is the first press message I've written to
    anyone this season.  Things have been hectic as I've been in the
    process of switching jobs.  My firm is going down the toilet due to
    bad management.  Happily, I'm heavily in demand, so I'm not having any
    problems finding alternatives.
    
    I'm not dead set on AT forever, Mark.  I'm sure you know that as
    experienced Diplomacy players, we'll all be looking for opportunities
    for stabs that benefit us.
    
    Sadly, I tend to agree with your evaluation of the situation for this
    upcoming turn.  Again, I don't want to BS you with incredible lies.  I
    need a center, and the only place it looks that I can get that center
    is a retaking of SEV.  I'm going to move from UKR, though, so that
    should hopefully relieve tensions on our mutual border.
    
    I hope you had a good Easter, and I really am open to the idea of
    working with you.  It's just that the tactical situation has not
    easily presented itself yet.
    
    As a side note (and this is not intended to lay blame or make you feel
    bad in any way), at times I wonder how this game would have shaped up
    if you and I had gone for the RT in Sprin 1901.
    
    Binflexibly yours,
    Hohn

    Vienna, (Free Press)
    "Summon up the Blood??"  "Did some one mention Blood?"
    echoed a deep refrain from the lost soul's of the Dark Tower.
    BirSauron and the Night Riders were conferring on recent events
    near Transylvania's eastern province when this disturbing thought was brought
    to mind.
    
    "From what black Pitt does this murmur of blood speak?
    Are we to dally in the shadow of efforts long a'gone
    When glory was set upon Le'pantaloons lusty song
    Or go fast against the winds of fate and course a new peak? "
    
    "huh..." mentioned the Darkest of the Night Riders.
    "It  is enough that you know that the recent military orders were an
    unfortunate vulgar display of power from the E.S.P. (*) mana pool that must be
    drawn upon in times of treasonous stress.  Now it time to send
    the Riders to discomfort the routing hordes of Russian's from the
    Northern provinces and to deal with the Pope.  It would seem that it is Easter
    again and crucifixtions are in."

    Jim,
    
    Uh oh. Ko-ans.
    
    I don't want to talk about this anymore.

    As most of you probably know, the Northeast currently is being battered by
    a winter/spring snowstorm.  Logan Airport has been closed much of the past
    two days and I'm not sure if Pitt is going to make it back in until later.
    
    In anticipation, I am moving the deadline to tomorrow.  Pitt should feel
    free to get his orders in sooner and let the retreats process.
    
    I hope everyone had a good time at World Dip Con!
    
    As he digs out from a foot and a half of snow and an inconsiderate person
    who parked halfway across his driveway!

    Hello Hohn
    
    Thanks for the note; I hope you find yourself a better firm to work at,
    and that your hours calm down a little (as much as lawyers'  hours _can_
    ever slow down).
    
    I appreciate the up-front tone of your letter.  I hate the message,
    naturally:  last turn was wait-and-see (Or was it "string the fish along
    a little longer") and this turn it's 'wait a little more...maybe',
    because the tactical situation isn't what it could be...for you.  (Which
    is, of course, one reason I so desperately wanted a hit of Edi _last_
    turn, when I at least stood a chance of being an equal/semi-equal partner
    and the tactical situation of three-on-Edi would've been so much nicer!)
     Ah well, Mama said there'd be days like this....
    
    I have to chuckle, because your need for a center, IMO, is probably not
    as desperate as MY need, given that (1) I'm beset upon by A, T, and now
    probably G, and (2) if you and Edi stay allied, then I possibly can hit
    him and "relieve him" of TRI, which actually makes you more powerful than
    he --  and Edi with no chance of future gain, unless  YOU help him (ie,
    RUM as compensation, etc)??!
    
     What's the overriding crisis with centers, when Edi has two (and *could
    have* had) three foes against him?  Well, anyway, it's an unanswerable
    question...and moot.
    
    I too wonder what would have happened, had we teamed up in 1901 and I not
    gone in with Edi.  I think, once you and I got past "game verbiage," that
    we would've done extremely well here.  (Not that _you_ won't this game,
    mind you -- just that as an RT, we would've kicked some serious butt).
    One point of note, though:  you could ask that same question for 1902, or
    1903, when I for one still asked for the same alliance idea.  Part of the
    later-game decision for non-alliance, I would think, lies in some small
    part with you, wouldn't you agree?
    
    Again, though, it's moot; water under the bridge.  I don't ever expect
    you to change or open up toward me, but I still wish you well.  (I just
    wish it wasn't so well against me.)  I know the routine by now:  you'll
    be "leaving Ukr," no doubt as you've said.  Of course, it'll either be
    for WAR or MOS, I'll wager!   (I mean, why retrace a perfectly good
    advance line when you have ARM and BLA in the rear to "mop up?")  Once
    you retake SEV, you'll build F Smy, to give you and Edi the 3:2 fleet
    superiority over Cal that you need to break out.
    
    Well, I'll see what I can do vis a vis AT, and hope the Kaiser's cavalry
    comes charging across Central Europe before I'm a memory...  All I can
    say is:  when you see my moves, realize I can "help or hurt" one member
    each of the AT.  Please note which type of attention _you're_ receiving.
    I may have been the "heavy" in 1901, but I still turn the other cheek in
    hopes of cooperation.   My face is awfully bruised, however.
    
    Take care, Hohn.  Have a good one, and we'll talk more when the
    retreat(s) become known and options are available.  You know, if you
    really were sincere about Ukr moving out (to RUM!) I'd almost welcome
    your A Arm in SEV...heck, I'd even move out in anticipation, just to see
    if you'd use your fleets vs BUL.         Am I dreaming here?
    
    Best to you, my friend.
    
    Mark

    Pitt, Pitt, are you there or are you still stranded in Europe somewhere?
    You owe a retreat in the ghodstoo game.  Please check it out as soon
    as you can.

    Well, no sign of Pitt yet.  Logan Airport was still on a heavily
    restricted flight schedule today.  On International flights, such
    problems can be hell.  I am extending the deadline another day
    and hoping Pitt makes it back soon.  I will continue to extend
    the deadline day by day until Pitt returns to the US.  I presume
    that if someone hears from him through another forum they will let
    me know.  Edi, you didn't knife him so bad this time around that
    he is still in a hospital over there, did you???  Pitt, of course,
    was the Defending World Dip Con Champion.
    
    Jim
    
    PS Now out to see if they've cleared the roads a bit more!
