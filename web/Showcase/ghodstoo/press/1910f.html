    Whew. You were right, Pitt was merely not paying close attention.
    
    Now everything is looking pretty tight, defensively speaking.
    
    I bet Hohn will try to squish the German A Sil. If you want to keep Pitt
    around, let him retreat to Ber; but if you don't think there's any more use
    for him, this would be the time to go for it. I'm sure you see what I mean.

    Well that turn went well enough.  John seemed to make the "threatening"
    yet non-dangerous moves he said he would.  I still think he'll have to
    get Jamie to take Pitt out first.  Any more word from the "Gentle King"?
    
    Here's some suggested moves for you to ponder:
    
    Italy
    ~~~~~~
    
    f naf-tun
    f apu-ion
    a rom-tus
    a ven s a tyo-pie
    
    These satisfy my prerogatives of staying near home as well as getting
    you into position to make and hold the stalemate line.
    
    Turkey
    ~~~~~~~
    
    f wes-naf
    f tyn-wes, s by f lyo
    f ion-tyn
    f adr h
    a bul-rum
    a mos & a ukr s a war
    a gal-sil, s by a war & a boh
    a tyo-pie
    a vie-tyo, s by a tri
    
    These moves strengthen our line and increase MY security (but without
    becoming any threat to you as you will have virtually penetrated any
    defensive lines I could throw up).  Fair enough?
    
    Thoughts?

    John,
    
    I've analyzed the situation a bit. Here are the basics, first.
    
    ---part one---
    
    I think you have to move MAO-Por. Because you'll need to defend Spa with it
    as soon as Turkey knocks your army out of Piedmont.
    
    You have to have Eng S Bre-MAO (or vice versa), and it probably won't go
    because GoL-Spa, Naf S Wes-MAO. (But maybe Italy won't give that support?
    Maybe he'll go cover Tunis again?) But that's ok, that part of the
    stalemate line will be secure anyway. At some point either you'll have
    another support for Spa, or I'll get a fleet over to get you into MAO, or
    something. But it's secure.
    
    The problem is going to be getting enough land support in place to secure
    both Mar and Mun, and also we'll have to secure Berlin. So suppose Turkey
    has A Pie, F GoL, A Tyo, Boh, Sil, Pru, eventually. (I don't think we can
    prevent this in the long run unless I get a F Bal to support A Pru, and if
    I do get that we don't need A Pru anyway.) Then there has to be a support
    for Ber, two for Mun, and one for Mar.
    
    At the moment, you've got the A Bur and the A Kie, but that's two short,
    even assuming an army of yours or Pitt's sits in Berlin. You'll build this
    winter and Par-Gas adds support for Mar, freeing A Bur for Mun. Still, the
    A Kie can't support both Mun and Ber.
    
    So either you'll have to have another army in Ruhr, or I'll have to have a
    fleet Bal to do the extra work.
    
    
    ---part two---
    
    Ok, so that should all be possible. Then the question is, will we keep
    Germany around for the draw? You haven't said anything about this, but I
    guess I'd want a 3-way draw if it's safe.
    
    As far as I can tell, it is *NOT* safe to try to eliminate him now. My
    first impression was that it would be safe, but I now think we cannot
    secure all those soft spots and also finish him off. (You have enough
    armies, but a couple of them are sticking out in ultimately unsupportable
    places. Well, really just A Pie, if that were in Ruhr right now everything
    would be ok.) For instance, if you ordered Pru-Ber, keeping him out of
    there, and I took Sweden (from Bot), then we'd have him down to one unit,
    but I think Turkey would (or could, with some lucky guessing) reach the
    surrounding position quite rapidly, and I don't think I could get a F Bal
    in time and also prevent Turkey from taking Stp.
    
    Maybe I could. Probably. I'd manage it unless Turkey made very aggressive
    moves this coming round. But it's quite a risk, I don't think it makes
    sense to take it. Because in the end, I predict, Hohn would back off a
    notch and let us eliminate Pitt later anyway, if we wanted to do it.
    
    
    My recommendation, then, is to play it rather conservatively, with you
    ordering MAO-Por and Eng S Bre-MAO, Bur S Mun, Mar S Spa, and maybe
    Pru-Sil, Mun S Pru-Sil, Pie-Tyo. And I think I'll order Nth-Den, Bot-Swe,
    so I'll be ready to enter Baltic and also have F Nwy, F Fin. Then when you
    build A Par and go to Gas, we'll be completely safe.
    
    
    Look it over, see what you think.

    Sorry, things have been insane around here.  This is my first (and

    I don't have time for a full analysis, so I'll trust that your moves

    Jim,
    
    This is an example of "setting up an excuse" many years in advance.
    
    It's true, I've been very busy.  But I am never too busy to conduct a
    quick five-minute full analysis of the board.  I'm hoping my constant
    (albeit true) whining about my lack of time will allay any fears Cal
    has, because I'm considering stabbing him this turn.  I'll make my
    decision tonight when I get home and can access my board.
    
    The problem has never been lack of time for an analysis, incidentally.
    The problem has been forgetting about the deadline until it passes,
    and/or being forced to negotiate in "waves," then intending to check
    negotiation mail right before deadline, but inadvertently spacing out
    on that intention.  If I see a late notice, I immediately conduct my
    tactical analysis and send moves in.  (And as you know, I don't
    negotiate _past_ deadline.)

    Indeed, interestingly enough, I sent my previous message BEFORE getting
    this one, but "feeling it in the wind".  This is no indication that
    _Cal_ knows that you might be about to stab, but at least that _I_
    saw that you might be about to stab.

    As it should be.  The GM, of course, takes a completely agnostic
    position on all such things.

    Did you get my reply to your note? In short it asked what you meant by
    really wanting to get a build this year, given that you cannot build this
    year (because you don't own any home centers).
    
    If you just hadn't thought it through carefully, I would like to take
    Sweden, since I *can* build. But if I have failed to get your point or
    something, I will certainly not take Sweden against your will.

    I'm just going to take Sweden. I wrote to Pitt twice, pointing out that he
    has no home center to build in. If he had written back with more
    explanation/insistence, I would have stayed out of Swe, but since he never
    said a word I'm taking it. I think I have a good move, you'll see.

    Hm, but he could use A Fin to get Turkey into Stp. Maybe I could still get
    Turkey out before he wiped out Italy for the win, but maybe not.
    
    
    I bet the move doesn't process tonight.

    I've gone with your conservative strategy.  However, I don't think we dealt
    with Pitt's insistence on gaining a build.  He does not own a home center
    anyway, so perhaps it's moot.
    
    If you are still checking in, I have a question.  Why not take StP instead
    of Swe?  All he could do is retreat to Fin and then disband one.  If you
    moved to Den as well, he'd be out next turn.
    
    Maybe if Turkey did get close to 18, Italy would finally switch over.

    Well, we'll see now, huh? :-)
    
    I haven't figured out whether those Turkish moves were good for us or bad.
    Good, I think.
    
    It's a good think I didn't use my fleet to go take Lvp, huh? You definitely
    need all the units you have.
    
    We have some time now, awaiting Italy's retreat. I might build an army,
    intending to put it into your stalemate line. Might be kind of tricky,
    logistically -- I was thinking an army in Ruhr would finish the job. And I
    was expecting you would get a build because the A Pie would be destroyed,
    but Hohn had other ideas....
    
    It will be interesting to see whether Pitt thinks he's been stabbed by my
    move. I think we might be ok even without him, though. I'll work it all out
    later today.

    Pitt,
    
    No offense, but, well, it doesn't look like you're long for this
    world.  You know it, I know it, they know it.  STP is Jamie's whenever
    he wants, without fear of any chance of me taking it, because he'll
    have three on my two.  Berlin is John's whenever he wants it as well,
    because I won't be venturing past my stalemate line, so John will have
    the leeway to take BER.
    
    As you know, I've never betrayed you.  Not once.  However, I suspect
    Jamie has, at least once.  And I _know_ that John has, several times
    in fact.  Remember how much it _sucked_ when he nailed you that one
    turn, right when it was starting to look like an FGT three-way?
    
    If you're going to go down, why not play spoiler and try to help me
    win?  I'd really, really appreciate it. :) And I'll bet it would stick
    in John's craw something fierce. ;)
    
    Now, I'm sure John and Jamie might promise you the world not to give
    me the throw-game-leverage (and your giving it to me would be their
    fault anyway, particularly John's, for his several brutal stabs of
    you, on multiple occasions), but really, how could you believe them?
    With me staying behind my stalemate line, they can axe you in one
    coordinated season, whenever they want.  And unless you believe that
    two expert, cutthroat players will increase the size of the draw out
    of the goodness of your heart, well, you're more of a Diplomacy
    optimist than I am, certainly. ;)
    
    If you're willing, please let me know, and move STP-FIN in Spring.  If
    you're not willing, I understand, and there are of course no hard
    feelings.  I just thought I'd float the idea.

    Jim,
    
    I am pleased.
    
    I now see practically no way I can do any worse than a 17 center
    three-way, assuming John and Jamie are rational.
    
    I foresee a 15 unit stalemate line:
    
    Fleets in: TUN, ION, TYS, TUS, ROM, NAP
    Armies in: VEN, TYR, VIE, BOH, GAL, WAR, MOS, UKR, SEV
    
    And two units to screw around with.
    
    I sincerely doubt I will do any better than a three-way, but at least
    I can say I, and not John, had the most centers at the end of the
    game.  If he even ever _did_ decide to stab, which appears uncertain
    at this point, and if he never stabbed, then we were looking at a
    solid four-way EFIT, so that's another good reason for the stab.
    
    And who knows?  Maybe I can pull off a miracle and take a win.  I
    doubt John will be suckered into a two-way.

    Cal,
    
    I'm really, really sorry.  I just saw the opportunity and I had to
    take it, simply because:
    
    1) It was a golden opportunity (I mean, three centers, you have to
    admit that's a pretty solid stab);
    1) I wasn't sure John was ever going to stab; and
    2) As a cutthroat player, I'm always hoping for the win, no matter how
    unlikely it looks, and the only way I can get anywhere near a win is
    if I can grab more centers.
    
    I'm sure you know it's nothing personal, but I just wanted to say it
    anyway.  I truly did enjoy working with you; my opportunism just got

    I'm not mad you stabbed (again), just surprised it took so long.
    Actually, not even that, your timing was good.  I do however
    suspect that all you've done is give Jamie MY place in the draw.
    Ah well, letting you stab me a THIRD time means I no longer deserved
    that anyway.
    
    For the record, if I'd gotten into the Ion, I was headed for Aegean
    next turn.  I wouldn't have taken any centres (unless you had breached
    the stalemate line, but I would have kept MY hold on a piece of the
    draw by maintain a grip on your proverbial short hairs.  Ah well, I
    should've known you couldn't let me go for it.
    
    Take care and good luck.  Now I can concentrate on the CDO stuff I've
    started doing.

    The position is now pretty clear. If our alliance holds, we have it locked
    up, and we'll have a four way draw. If anybody defects, Hohn wins. By
    making his move now, Hohn has made us all 100% dependent on each other.
    
    Pitt and I each have our own power over both Berlin and Stp, either one of
    which is enough to give Turkey the win. I have no illusions about Pitt's
    willingness to exercise that power, and I hope no one else has any about me.
    
    Hohn has given France the opportunity to bring his wayward A Pied back
    where it is of some use. I highly recommend seizing this opportunity. Since
    John has no build, he can't protect Mar except by tying up the A Bur, which
    he'll need for the protection of Munich. The solution should be obvious.
    
    As for me, I will most assuredly order my two fleets to support Pitt's two
    to hold, forevermore.
    
    My F Swe is free to do anything useful, but it has nothing useful to do. (I
    guess putting it in GoB is the sensible thing, but if Pitt wants me to I'll
    move it to Denmark.)
    
    I am cancelling my earlier hopeful plan to retake Liverpool, since John
    cannot afford to give up another unit. Hm, actually, the one in Prussia is
    an extra. Still, I won't take Liverpool. I don't need it for anything.
    
    Pitt, within the range of non-suicidal moves, I'll do anything you want me
    to do, since you are the one of us most likely (and reasonably) to have
    qualms about his own security. Tell me what position you'd like to see, or
    where you want me to go.

    I think I have a good plan now.
    
    Since Turkey has A Mos, A Lvn, Germany has to have his army hold in Stp. I
    will order Swe-Fin.
    
    I can have my F Bal support you Pru-Ber.
    
    You can order Mar-Gas, Pie-Mar, Bur S Pie-Mar.
    
    If Germany turns this very move, I think Turkey wins. By Stp-Fin, he can
    fork over Stp, and Hohn can hold it in the Fall, and Hohn will get Tunis
    too and lose nothing.
    
    If Germany doesn't turn, we'll have a locked up position. As follows:
    
    Around Stp, I can just keep ordering Nwy S Fin-Stp. Eventually I can sail
    in the other fleets for the elimination. My supported attack prevents
    Turkey from ever taking Stp.
    
    At the German front, you'll be able to order Kie S Mun, Bur S Mun, and I'll
    add Bal S Ber. This holds against any attack.
    
    Mar is held by Gas S Mar. And Spain by Por S Spa. And Eng S MAO finishes
    the stalemate line.
    
    
    
    What do you think? Are you ready to consecrate a three-way draw? Or do you
    want to see if there's any chance of punching through the Turkish lines in
    the Mediterranean, using a single Italian fleet for support? Cal could keep
    the F Ion, threating Greece; you could try to sneak into Wes and get him to
    help you into Tunis. Doesn't look very promising, but, your call.
