    This really is a message going to the Judge so I can check the game's
    status, but I couldn't pass up another parting shot.
    
    So, are you SURE that you are part of this draw??????  Don't count

    (I will say, though, that I am *pretty sure* that there will be no *draw*

    all, then yes, I am pretty sure. But I am not as sure as I'd like to be
    that there's any "this draw" to speak of....)

    I set draw quite a while ago.  Hohn was exploring his options, but I told
    him I was taking the draw, so that should be the end of it.
    
    EOG will be interesting.

    Hey.
    
    Ok, I don't know why we don't have a draw yet. I certainly have SET DRAW.
    Either you are thinking you might possibly still eliminate me without Hohn
    winning, or Hohn is thinking he might fool you into trying or me into
    assuming something dumb, or I don't know what.
    
    You can certainly rest assured that I won't jeopardize the position as long
    as you order the obvious purely defensive moves against Turkey! To be
    specific, you can feel free to march that new army to Ruhr if you like, by
    Bur-Ruh and Par-Bur, which is quite safe to do this move. But if you move
    anything else I am extremely likely to panic. As long as I'm happy, I'll
    keep ordering support for my own F Stp, and for your A Ber.
    
    If Hohn is up to something, I expect I'll see what it is this move. If
    that's what's happening, we can discuss and assess the situation afterward,
    if you like.
    
    Maybe all it is is that one of you two just hasn't gotten around to SETting
    DRAW. I certainly hope so. The more I think about it, the more I am
    inclined to conclude that this must be the explanation. But just in case, I
    thought I'd better put my cards on the table.

    John,
    
    Just checking in.  Haven't received a response to my last letter.
    What are your thoughts?  Do you have a proposal, or should we just go
    with the three-way?

    I guess Jim really was the *second* to congratulate, but I was not the
    first. The Judge was. That congratulations message was an automagic one
    generated by the end of the game.
    
    I was the first human being to comment publicly on the end of the game, but
    I merely expressed my relief. I hereby congratulate my drawmates, and in a
    different way *all* of the participants (including, needless to say, our
    GM) on a game 'well played' in the broadest sense. I enjoyed it very much.
    
    I have rather a lot to say, as a matter of fact, and I bet some others do
    too. I'll probably send more than one installment of End of Game statements.

    Thanks, Manus, I will set all that up to get the game in the Showcase
    section.  One question for the "judge experts".  The Judge is sending
    me a message about sending a message "resume" to restart the game.
    I assume this is only should I want to disallow the draw ;-)
    The game stays "open" for us to exchange end game comments for a bit?
    And Nick will have to let me know if I have to do anything to get the game
    result properly recorded.
    
    It will be a relief to get this game off of my system.  It takes up a
    large portion of my alloted space on world.std.com  If the game went on
    for a REALLY long time, I don't know what I would have done.

    Right.

    Yes. It will stay open as long as people keep sending messages. It will
    disappear if there are no signons for N days, where N is unknown to me....

    I tried to send comments earlier and they bounced.
    
    if this gets through then:
    
    Congradulations to the group for their survival.
    
    Again I think that if Turkey had stayed with Austria, there would have been a
    very good chance that the game could have gon to a rather exciting three way
    and may be a two situation with a strategic rather than a tactical stalemate.
    Further there may have been better chances for a victorious back stab by
    Turkey in the end game.
    
    I have rambled enough on the game during it to the GM so that he plenty of
    material to hang me with, so I will not comment further here,

    Hi folks:  I'll be commenting on this game eventually, but for the
    moment, this is my weekend to move from Toronto to a small town north of
    here called Aurora so I'll be quite busy.  Oh, and I'm also smack dab in
    the middle of studying for a final exam I have to ace to get the new job
    (computer tech support for Sprint Canada) that I just finished training
    for...  busy?  Who?  Me?
    
    For the moment, I WILL say that I wasn't surprised that Hohn stabbed me
    and I was hardly an unwary pawn.  It's just that, if I had turned on him
    when everybody SAID I should, it would have handed France the 18 centre
    win.  My thinking was that, if I could smarm my way to five or six
    centres WITH Hohn, I had a chance to be in the position that Jamie ended
    up in - the indespensible third wheel between France & Turkey.  I had a
    better chance of doing that on Turkey's side than on France's.  I was
    absolutely convinced (and I was RIGHT, dammit! <g>) that Hohn NEVER had
    a chance of an outright victory.  Against novice or intermediate players
    maybe, but not against this crowd.
    
    Thanx for the game; hope to do it again.  :)

    At the very turn that you stabbed me I think I had reached my absolute

    Germany and France  not to mention what I thought was pretty good tactical
    moves to
    recapture my home.
    
    If you had not stabbed me I felt fairly secure that I could continue in the
    balance act between Germany and France to the extent that would have
    allowed us as an alliance to breakthrough any western stalemate line.  A
    critical factor that your stab of me delivered to the west.  Given what I
    (maybe too egotistical) thought and given the military and diplomatic
    situation the position would have developed to BOTH our benefits.   To
    judge the effectiveness of the
    Austrian diplomacy on the west, I think that the turn or two after the stab
    still showed some substantial influence there.  Your stab took away that
    influence from the East and replaced it with an obvious and overbearing
    front runner.  If there were the two of us in the East we could easily have
    parlayed our mutual reputations to continue to dominate the board
    diplomatically as well as
    militarily as the rest would still be in tension over the prospects of
    either one
    of us stabbing the other.
     This would have allowed you to have a better opportunity for a stab later
    with a chance for victory or even a two way draw with myself or one of the
    other Western powers.

    Wow, so you mean an eliminated player can object to a draw and restart
    a game all by themselves.  That's MY kind of Judge ;-)  I've always
    loved to "remain" in the game after being eliminated.

    Well, quite a game.  It's hard to know where to begin the EOG statement.
    For starters, I'm happy to have survived.  Even after weathering the first
    storm, I had limited confidence that I would make it to the end.  I was
    once a 10-unit Italy, largest power on the board, and embarking  my assault
    on England when my erstwhile Austrian ally stabbed me.  In a few short
    years, I was history.   So reaching a fairly large size is no guarantee of
    participation in a draw.
    
    The early part of the game was most interesting.  I was lied to on all
    fronts.  England took the Channel, and Germany attacked from the east,
    while Italy moved into Piedmont.  I had resigned myself to an early exit,
    but I did not give up.  I stayed in contact with my neighbors, and
    benefited when Italy turned east.  The most important development was
    Pitt's willingness to reverse field and allow me to repulse the English
    attack.  Before long, England was near elimination.  Austria (Edi) was a
    main player in bringing this about.   As important, Pitt and I talked over
    the phone and developed an effective plan for mutual expansion.  The
    benefits of the plan were clear enough.
    
    The F-I relationship was particularly interesting.  My policy throughout
    the game was to befriend and support Italy.  Unfortunately, Italy did not
    see things quite the way I did.  I told him the truth about why I wanted
    his friendship: to buffer against Turkey.  I anticipated a draw, and I
    tried to impress on Italy that he would most likely participate in it if he
    and I worked together.  Cal, however, thought that he could manage the F-T
    conflict to his own benefit by allying with Turkey.  His reasoning (at
    least as expressed to me) was that he could occupy the stalemate line, thus
    being in position to throw the game if either F or T stabbed.  My response
    was to point out that I had virtually no presence in the Med, while Turkey
    was, of necessity, a massive presence.  I don't think I ever had more than
    three fleets in the Med, and when Italy threw in with Turkey I had only
    one.  I don't think Cal read this situation correctly.  But no matter what
    I did, Cal would not go against Turkey, and this led to his demise.
    
    For some reason, Cal thought I had a chance at a win, while Turkey did not.
     Cal was proven right on Turkey's chances  by events, but it was a close
    call.  I still don't see why he thought France could win outright.  I
    always expected a draw, and indeed I thought the game would end with as
    many as five remaining powers.
    
    At one point, England was down to one center and I could have easily
    eliminated him, but I chose not to do so.  Quite honestly, I don't recall
    all the tactical considerations at that moment.  I do recall (without
    reviewing old messages) that I was about to attack Germany and I needed the
    English fleet for some reason.  More, I was then large enough to want to
    gather small powers to my side.  I befriended Russia and England, then
    launched the attack on Germany.  Why did I attack Germany?  Simply, I felt
    I had no other decent opportunities, and Germany was somewhat vulnerable.
    I hoped to rebuild both Russia and England as solid allies.  I calculated
    that I would always be the dominant partner, and rescuing my former enemy
    (England) from oblivion would be the basis for long-term trust.  This did
    happen; although I think England had a couple of opportunities (before
    Turkey got so big) to stab me and make for an even more chaotic game, we
    maintained open and honest communication for the rest of the game.
    
    In the most controversial move in the game, Russia sacrificed himself to
    ensure my capture of Munich (not necessary, as it turned out), but I did
    participate in building England back up, ultimately to participate in the
    draw.   In part, I did this because this was a demo game, and I thought it
    would be neat to show observers that no situation is hopeless.  Also, Jamie
    is an excellent tactician, and I wanted his advice.
    
    My most unfortunate relationship was with Germany.  Germany saved me from
    oblivion, yet I later turned on him.  Then, when he was down to a unit or
    two, England and I took him out to reduce the size of the draw, after using
    him to set up the stalemate against Turkey.  Not very nice on my part.
    Nothing personal, Pitt, just sheer opportunism.
    
    Hohn and I did not communicate at all at the beginning, and then not much
    for the remainder of the game.  We bandied about the idea of a 2-way, but I
    never took it that seriously.  I have participated in one 2-way draw).  It
    was founded on game-long trust and cooperation, so strong that at the end
    neither of us could imagine stabbing the other for a win.  Hohn and I never
    developed that kind of relationship, so I did not trust him to carry
    through a 2-way draw promise, and, quite honestly, he had no reason to
    think that I would.  As things turned out, I would have had to bear much
    the larger burden of risk anyway, so I opted for the 3-way.
    
    I'm not quite sure what was going on for Russia.  I know he became highly
    offended by what he saw as maltreatment by Austria and Turkey.  Perhaps he
    had good reason for that.  In any event, he became my vassal.  I wish we
    had played it so he had not been eliminated (at least not when he was) but
    them's the breaks.
    
    Austria and I spoke a lot.  Edi called regularly until his fate was more or
    less sealed.  Also, I think he gave up on me when I did not come through on
    his expectations.  I misled him into thinking I would do things I did not
    do.  I wanted him to think I would, but I never fully committed, even
    though Edi no doubt thinks I did.  I tried to support him toward the end,
    but by then it was too late.
    
    I have always played Diplomacy by computer.  I started out in the
    Compuserve and Genie Dip areas, then moved to the judges after I dropped
    the pay services.  I found it downright startling to receive a phone call
    from someone (usually Edi) on diplomacy.  I'm used to having a chance to
    think about my response before making it, and also to manipulating the
    timing of my responses.  I find it much easier to frame things just the way
    I want in email rather than in a person-to-person conversation.  I'm not
    surprised that the FTF players among us had some difficulty with this
    format.  I know I felt it in reverse.  The game was good experience for me
    in giving me a taste of the FTF world, though far short of the real thing.
    
    The middle game is my weak point, and it showed up here.  I did not display
    good tactics when I had a large force to manage.  This cost me dearly in my
    battle with TI.  I went from an offensive position to a precarious
    defensive position in one turn.  I need to spend more time on tactics
    during the middle game rather than going with my first or second cut.
    
    I'd be interested in others' views on my decision to attack Germany.  Was
    this a wise move, or should I have done something else?
    
    More later, perhaps.

    TURKEY'S END-OF-GAME STATEMENT IN "GHODSTOO"
    
    Right.  It's 2:00 a.m., I'm a bit buzzed from too much booze, and I
    have a shitload of work to do tomorrow.  Yet the muse has struck, and
    I find myself finally prepared to talk about this great game.
    
    As a preliminary disclaimer, some may find my writing style to be
    overly formalistic and/or blunt.  I'm not entirely sure why I tend to
    do this, perhaps it's because I'm a lawyer.  In any case, these are my
    honest and straightforward thoughts, and please, if you wish to take
    issue with them, I welcome you to.  There is little I enjoy more than
    strenuous and heated debate.
    
    So, to begin.  I'm pretty goddamn happy with the way this game turned
    out, all things considered.
    
    First, I was happy to draw Turkey.  Turkey is my second favorite
    nation, right behind France.  Sometimes I think I play Turkey the best
    out of all of the countries, even though I enjoy France more.  Many of
    my best performances have come with Turkey.  The thing I love most
    about Turkey is that you can never, ever count Turkey out.  On so many
    occasions, I've been down to 3, 2 and even 1 center with Turkey, yet
    I've managed to climb out of my predicament and roll onward to a
    respectable finish, sometimes even victory.  At San Diego DipCon in
    1989, my solo victory (which happened to be the only solo victory in
    the entire con) was with Turkey, after being reduced to 3 centers in
    1902 and 1903.  A cagey defense can work wonders, and I can often
    outlast my persecuters with Turkey.
    
    So yes, I was thrilled to have drawn it.
    
    Having Edi to my northwest in Austria was also a great relief.  Edi
    and I have always worked well together.  He and I could tell you some
    rather remarkable stories about DipCons past, and indeed, those games
    have been some of my all-time favorites.
    
    At this point, I'd like to raise potentially controversial issue
    number one.  When you've worked well with someone in the past, and you
    do so again, is that "cross-gaming?"  Or is that just the benefits of
    experience?  I tend toward the latter, although I know some who argue
    the former.  In my mind, the distinction is that although I know from
    experience that Edi is a great player who tends toward strong
    alliance, that doesn't mean I automatically go with him.
    
    Since this was a demo game, I decided to do the exact opposite, in
    fact.  I wanted to torch Edi quickly, not only because I had never
    started initially adverse to him and wanted to try a new experience,
    but also because I knew he was dangerous.  No offense to the rest of
    my esteemed colleagues, most of whom I didn't know before this game in
    any event, but I considered Edi to be the most dangerous other player
    on the board, and I accordingly wanted to axe him.
    
    To that end, I attempted to cultivate a strong RT.  Mark seemed to be
    on board with the idea, as well as personable and likeable, with an
    apparently strong sense of the game.  We exchanged what must have been
    dozens of kilobytes of text, hashing out specific details, and
    ultimately I figured he was solid, and that he was going to go with
    me.  Meanwhile, Edi and I had exchanged a perfunctory message or two,
    along the lines of "Hey, let's kick butt together, we've done it
    before, we'll do it again."  And we didn't talk much more than that.
    
    Of course, as my S1901 moves indicated, that was all BS on my part.
    Again, I was strongly motivated by the novelty/demo factor, and I
    wanted to see what I could do to take Edi out.  And I was utterly
    convinced Mark was with me.  The old, "The greatest volume of
    exchanged press==loyalty" schtick completely took me in.
    
    And also of course, Mark completely snookered me.
    
    I recall seeing the S1901 moves.  I told a buddy of mine, "Well, so
    much for this demo game.  I'm meat."  I would feel a bit less
    doomsaying in the future, but I was quite demoralized after seeing
    Mark neatly eviscerate my position.  I was so convinced he wouldn't
    stab me!  The volume of messages we exchanged, the traditional
    difficulty Russia has opening strongly against Turkey, my desire to
    nail Edi to the wall and the paranoia I attempted to foment against
    him with Mark, they all convinced me I was solid.  How wrong I was!
    
    In any event, after my S1901 failed so disastrously, I had to fall
    back upon experience and a bit of fast-talk desperation.  I approached
    my old buddy Edi, pulled the nostalgia card, apologized humbly for my
    fuck-ups, and pledged my eternal, undying support.  All I wanted,
    ostensibly, was to get back a little bit at Mark.  I utilized my
    standard "toady" line, and while I suspect Edi saw right through that,
    it nevertheless panned out as Edi didn't move decisively against me.
    He rather made some novel moves which _could_ have been used in a
    devastating fashion against me in S1902, but which didn't overly hurt
    me in F1901.  That was fine with me; Edi straddling the fence was much
    better for me than Edi taking the hammer to me.
    
    F1901 was also spent trying to patch things up with Mark (read: me
    begging Mark to pull off).  We once again exchanged dozens of
    kilobytes of text, and he again promised to go with me.  This time,
    though, I wasn't buying, and I decided to take the safe moves which
    would hopefully maintain my position and defend against Russia.  The
    tone of my messages to mark would also set the tenor for my later
    diplomatic strategy with him, one that would ultimately prove
    successful.
    
    I defended against Mark's greed, and then fell back into Fortress
    Turkey mode.  All the while, I was hoping against hope that Edi would
    succumb to nostalgia and recollection of good past experiences with
    me, so that we could work together against Mark.
    
    Happily, Russia stabbed Edi shortly thereafter.  This was a rather
    large blunder on Mark's part, IMO.  He stabbed too many people, at too
    many dangerous times.  I think he was taken by the "demo" aspect of
    the game.  Now, demos are all well and good, but even if you want to
    try something different, you should still always keep sight of the end
    goal, and utilize worthwhile strategies.  You can't expect reckless
    strategies to work, especially not in an experts' game.
    
    Edi was then pushed into my camp, because of Mark's stab.  I of course
    marketed myself as the only reliable ally, and again pledged eternal
    loyalty and support and toadiedom.  All the while, I was still
    conducting a diplomatic onslaught against Mark.
    
    The strategy I adopted was one of absolute bluntness and truthfulness.
    I played the "wounded victim" schtick up to the hilt, and took an
    amazingly self-righteous tone.  You see, I had noticed that Mark
    appeared to avoid taking personal responsibility for his actions,
    preferring instead to blame it all on Edi.  "Edi made me do it" was a
    rather common refrain, with Mark.
    
    With this in mind, I figured that any sign of forgiveness or weakness
    or general "laid-backness" would backfire on me.  Every time I bought
    into his prior acts, I got burned.  So I figured if I took a hard
    line, he might stand up and take notice.  I also figured that if I
    painted myself as the ever-loyal ally who always got brutally betrayed
    by him, he might find my promises more credible.  "I've never once
    stabbed you" was a common refrain of _mine_ to Mark.  I never let him
    dodge responsibility, and I also figured that if I could make him own
    up to it, and didn't let him off the hook, he might actually feel some
    level of guilt and responsibility and do the "right thing" for once.
    
    So on the crucial Fall turn of 1902 (or was it 1903?  I forget, and
    I'm trying to do this from memory, as my older game files are not
    readily available) I made a tactical analysis of the board.  One
    particular set of moves would guarantee that I kept all of my centers,
    as well as take SEV.  I then made a full-scale diplomatic assault on
    Mark so that he would make the necessary moves.  Hoping against hope,
    I then crossed my fingers.
    
    And it worked!  I blew Mark out of SEV, and my build on that turn
    marked the end of my openings phase, and took me into my midgame.
    
    [At this point, the muse passed out.  Upon rereading the above, I'm
    rather amused by quite a bit of it, so I decided I'd keep it in raw
    form, rather than editing.]
    
    Midgame was spent with Edi and me working solidly and steadily against
    IR, with a lent French unit.  We did well at first, but then we began
    to bog down.  So much so that the tide eventually turned, and Edi
    began to take losses.
    
    Somewhere during that time, there was a rather crucial exchange
    between Edi and myself, concerning RUM.  Much of this was done over
    the phone, but basically, the way I saw it, if I managed to convince
    him to let me take RUM, I'd then be able to shed the onus of toadiedom
    and begin to breathe a bit easier.  In fact, considering some of the
    risks he was facing on that same turn, I might even be able to become
    the dominant partner of the alliance.  After much wrangling, he
    finally consented to letting me have RUM on that turn, and I knew that
    I was set.  I was actually quite happy with myself, in that I'd
    suspected he'd remain adamant in his desire to take/keep RUM, but I
    think by that point, he'd decided to throw in with me for the long
    haul, no matter what.  I felt similarly, although I was starting to
    realize that the realities of the situation might require a
    rearrangement in the future.  I really, really wanted to work with
    Edi, because I knew he was reliable and because I knew any AT will
    favor the T in the long run.
    
    But we became stalemated, and Edi began to lose ground.  Edi, I still
    disagree with you quite strongly in that I don't think staying with
    you would have benefited me in the end.  I do think you're
    overestimating your ability to influence our particular situation, to
    be honest; France, Italy and Russia weren't budging, and hadn't shown
    _any_ signs that they ever would, despite several years worth of
    efforts by both of us.  And if I'd granted you the support and centers
    you wanted, it would have been at my expense.  And I didn't want to
    jeopardize my upward trend with a downward turn, especially knowing
    how cagey you are, Edi.  I was worried that you could have stabbed me
    at any time, after making a deal with the others.  Giving up parts of
    my position to you as you had requested was just too dangerous, and
    the potential payoff was too remote and speculative; what I saw was us
    getting driven back, and you can't count on being able to influence
    all of the others, which is what we would have needed for you to
    prosper again.
    
    Moreover, I also of course considered you to be very dangerous, Edi,
    and since I saw an opportunity to axe you while growing at the same
    time, I wanted to do it.  See, I agree with most of the people here
    that said that a solo victory was a very unlikely result.  Thus, I
    wanted to make sure I ended up in any three-way situation.  Stabbing
    you guaranteed my placing in at least a three-way, assuming France
    couldn't achieve a solo (which I was genuinely concerned about for a
    while).  Stabbing you also was a way of playing for the win, since
    even though I suddenly became a major player and a threat for the win,
    I knew France was matching me, at least initially.  Since the only way
    to get to a solo is to get those 18 centers, I figured I'd have to
    start moving, especially considering the threat of France.  I knew
    stabbing Edi was one way of growing toward that 18 center victory.
    
    Jamie said that he thought that after I stabbed Edi, my chances of
    winning were low.  Of course they were low.  In a game like this, the
    fact that I or anyone came close was remarkable in itself; I fully
    expected a three-way result from the start.  Good players wouldn't
    allow for any other result, for the most part, under most
    circumstances.  The thing I dispute is that I don't think staying with
    Edi would have increased my chances of a solo.  At max, even if we
    assume Edi was able to get out of the stalemate situation he was in,
    even if he managed to stave off FIR's push and recover some ground, I
    figure we'd only be able to make it up to 11/11 or 12/12 before we
    reached our maximum realistic extent.  Then I could have stabbed, but
    
    The other thing that helped me make my decision to stab Edi was some
    words from Edi himself, where he said that we could grow to a decent
    size and then "hopefully force a concession."  I don't think Edi
    realized this was a DIAS game, which makes everything different in
    terms of end-game strategies.  The vast majority of FTF games are won
    by concession, but not DIAS games.  As soon as someone pointed that
    out to him, I strongly suspected Edi would be much more wary and on
    guard against me, because there would be no easy concessions; one of
    us would likely have to stab the other.  And since I didn't know when
    someone would clarify this point to Edi, I wanted to strike while the
    iron was hot, and when he least expected me to stab him.  Stabbing Edi
    when he is on guard is a difficult proposition, after all, and should
    be avoided whenever possible. :)
    
    I was very happy with the turn that I stabbed Edi.  That turn also
    involved a stab of Cal, and it worked out perfectly, such that Edi
    went down three while Cal maintained (I think).  Every move worked out
    exactly as I'd hoped, and I knew I was in the three-way, and possibly
    might even get a two-way or a solo.
    
    The endgame was rather simple, straightforward and brief.  Edi stayed
    alive longer than I'd hoped, and there was the judge e-mail fiasco
    that caused such disruption between Cal's and my moves.  I believe my
    chances of winning would have been better had we been able to either
    beat Edi down more quickly, or had we been able to coordinate better
    on the judge fiasco turn.  My reasoning for this was that if I had
    been one turn faster on getting to the Med, I might have been able to
    blow into MID myself, rather than needing Cal's assistance (assistance
    which Cal wisely decided to withhold...it was very tantalizing to be
    so close to blowing into the MID, but having Cal refuse to do so).
    And if I'd made it into MID, I feel confident I would have won.
    
    As a result of that, it was just a question of who would be in the
    final draw.  I had one last card or two to try, though, and things
    were closer than I'd thought they would be.
    
    I'd always planned on stabbing Cal, but the question was how to do it
    without overly jeopardizing my position, because I was genuinely
    worried about John winning, for a long time, perhaps longer than I
    should have been worried.  I think it was a bit of paranoia on my
    part.  As I've said, France is the only nation I like to play more
    
    
    than Turkey, and I tend to overestimate France's chances in most games
    I play in.
    
    An opportunity did present itself, though, and not coincidentally that
    opportunity presented itself at about the same time that I would be
    able to make one final push for victory.  So I stabbed Cal for the
    three centers (I was also happy about that; I'd assumed for a long
    time that I would only be able to get two from him on the turn of my
    stab, but as a result of moves that Cal himself proposed, I was able
    to finagle three), and moved into position in the north.
    
    Now, had Pitt acted the way that _I_ would have acted, I would have
    won this game.  Basically, I view any elimination as an elimination.
    If I'm not in the final draw, who cares whether the end result is a
    solo or a three-way for the others?  In fact, if I've been stabbed by
    someone such that it results in my own demise, I'll do my damnedest to
    try to throw the game to the non-stabber.  This builds credibility for
    my not infrequent throw-game-leverage threats, and it shows people
    that stabbing poorly (since of course, any stab of _me_ must be a poor
    decision, right? ;) ) has certain consequences.
    
    In this game, John had brutally stabbed Pitt on more than one
    occasion, as had Jamie at least once, I believe.  And they were
    unquestionably about to make the final stab which would cut down on
    the draw size, too.  Everyone knew it.  The writing was on the wall.
    Meanwhile, I had never once stabbed Pitt, and had supported him on a
    number of occasions.  So I thought I'd be on pretty reasonable grounds
    to ask Pitt to move STP-FIN, and support me in STP in the fall if he
    got into FIN.  If he'd done that, I'd have won.
    
    I was surprised, though, when he flatly rejected me.  He knew that he
    was going out, but he still wouldn't let me win.  I was disappointed,
    and although normally I would have tried to sway him, from his tone I
    knew that he wasn't going to do it.  So I pulled back defensive and
    established my stalemate line (well, actually I was a bit forward of
    the stalemate line, as a sort of offensive defense).  And then it was
    over.  John and I exchanged a few perfunctory e-mails about a two-way,
    but I suspected he'd back off of that proposal, and he did.  Then we
    called it.
    
    The keys to this game for me were the three crucial turns that I
    describe above, first the taking of SEV, then the stab of Edi, and
    finally the stab of Cal.  Each marked the passing of a game phase for
    me, from openings to mid to end.  And even though I wasn't able to
    pull off the solo, even though the game ended up a three-way like we
    all had suspected, I'm happy with the way this game turned out,
    especially considering my beginnings.  I'll take a 17-center three-way
    with a few "almost wins" any day, especially among this crowd.
    
    I had a great time, and I salute all of my esteemed colleagues.  My
    only regrets are that Pitt wasn't able to participate more fully (for
    obvious reasons; and I hope things get better soon), and that Mark
    seemed to have some hard feelings about the game.  Regardless, I hope
    to see you all again in another game.  And Edi, I hope I haven't
    completely torched my credibility with you...this was just an anomaly,
    I swear it! :)

    John was also doing quite well, and as the board did _not_ unite
    against me right after I stabbed, I feel your claim here is also
    erroneous.  Sure, I was a front runner, but then to get to 18, you

    You are speaking with the benefit of complete knowledge and hindsight
    here, Edi.  Sure, _you_ know that you weren't planning to stab me, and
    that if we'd been able to get you out of your predicament, that you
    would have stayed with me.
    
    I didn't know that for sure, not by any stretch.  I know how good you
    are, Edi, and even though we've always worked well together in FTF
    games, DIAS PBEM is a very different beast.  I was always concerned
    with the stab from you.  So when an opportunity presented itself to
    take you out, I took it.  And I don't think it was a bad decision, not
    at all.

    A two-way between you and me would have been impossible, based on
    geography.  As for stabbing you for the win, I suppose that if
    everything worked out perfectly, that would have been possible, but my
    estimates of the probability of that happening differ from yours,
    apparently.

<p><a name=21></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=0000cc>England</font>:</b><pre>
    I have a couple of things to say about Hohn's comments.
    
    First, about Pitt's ending:
    
    >In this game, John had brutally stabbed Pitt on more than
    >one occasion, as had Jamie at least once, I believe.
    
    Never, though I had *been* stabbed by Pitt more than once.
    I sure would have stabbed him if I'd had a chance, but I never did get one!
    (Until the last year, of course.)
    
    >And they were unquestionably about to make the final
    >stab which would cut down on the draw size, too.
    >Everyone knew it.  The writing was on the wall.
    
    I wonder why you thought this was so obvious.
    
    >So I thought I'd be on pretty reasonable grounds
    >to ask Pitt to move STP-FIN, and support me in STP
    >in the fall if he got into FIN.  If he'd done that, I'd have won.
    
    Yes, you would have won.
    
    If Pitt had been completely on top of things, he probably would have thrown
    it to you then. But, if he were really completely on top of things, he
    wouldn't have let the game *get* to that stage. (I explained this a bit in
    my eog statement.)I was counting on this fact, myself.
    
    
    Hohn to Edi:
    
    >Didn't John stab Pitt on the same turn I stabbed you?
    
    Yes, the stabs were simultaneous. In 1905. (I can't remember which season,
    though. I can check on Monday.)
    
    >If so, that defeats your argument of any kind of "balancing
    >act" existing between F and G.
    
    It kind of does, doesn't it?
    
    (Still Hohn to Edi)
    
    >As for stabbing you for the win, I suppose that if
    >everything worked out perfectly, that would have been
    >possible, but my estimates of the probability of that
    >happening differ from yours, apparently.
    
    Just out of curiosity, what do you think the chance was?
    
    I would factor into two elements. First, there is the chance that you and
    Edi could have beaten whatever westerners resisted you. And second, there is
    the chance that *given you could overcome the westerners together*, you
    rather than Edi would have gotten the win. (The final chance is the product
    of those two factors.)
    
    My view is that the first of these two was very low, but the second was
    fairly high. (In fact, one reason I think the first is low is that the
    second is so high!)

    Actually I knew that the 'system' allows only Draw Include All Survivors,
    however for me that was also part of the challenge.  Players often
    surrender themselves to the 'system' rather than realising that they are
    and should be in control and can do what ever the hell they want with the
    game.  The game is a social function and the ultimate victory is to do both
    get the players to support you in a victory of some sort within the game
    and at the sametime get them to join in a victory over the system.
    
    A demonstration game is just that a demonstration.  One of the things I
    like to demonstrate is that we the players call the shots not some system.
    Too many people regulate their freedoms and choices out of existance, here
    we could have worked to create a situation in which all the players would
    have a rebellion against the system while at the sametime supporting our in
    game goals.  In this I was at fault for not making it clearer to Hohn.
    
    The ultimate control over a game's result is what you want in some manner
    or another that also gives you in game recognition.  Showing players how to
    break the DIAS issue and confronting the email community with it is
    something that was worth the effort.  By turning on Austria you surrendered
    your focus to only the ingame result of a three way draw, something that
    could have been achieved without having to go to the extent of attacking
    me..but anyway....that's another story that has already been over told.

    I think you are attacking a non-issue.  No one disputes that the players
    control the game.  Any parameter - even the DIAS flag - can be changed by
    unanimous vote of the players.  Of course, the GM can annouce prior to the
    game that he will not allow any parms to be changed, but in that case you
    can simply decline to play in that game.
    
    Now, if you're going to argue that a the players should be able to change
    the parms by a majority vote (instead of a unanimous one), I'll strongly
    disagree with you.  But I don't think you're saying that, so I don't see a
    problem.

    "Somehow" it is. But is it closer in the relevant way?
    
    What if we play chess, and at the end I have two knights and a king, and
    you have just a king. Hey, I think I'm closer to winning! But it's a draw.
    Or, maybe you have more pieces, but I sneak into a stalemate position. I
    would be pretty pissed if the scorekeeper insisted that the stalemate was
    just a technicality and awarded you a point and me nothing!
    
    The aim of the game is to get 18 centers. So if you can't get the 18, you
    don't win! Close, but Diplomacy isn't horseshoes. And if you have 17 and I
    have one, but nobody can win without my letting them, I think I control the
    game as much as you do. I should get the same 'reward' you get. If you
    don't like it, you just try to eliminate me. If you can't, why do you
    deserve the win? Why do you deserve more of a win than I do?

    Hmmm. I'm not so sure it rewards aggressive play.
    It just changes *which* positions you have to play very defensively.
    
    
    I like the usual Judge scoring, myself. I think board *position* is as
    important as number of centers, and so is diplomatic position. Seeing the
    game as reducible to the number of centers one controls is, well, kind of
    crass, in my opinion.

    Of course, this is one of the things that's so, well, ironic?, about DIAS.
    I think occasionally you could convince someone to agree to vote for a draw
    that didn't include him, as a matter of fact, but these are likely to be
    pretty dull examples. (For instance, if England were down to a single
    center, one which could be captured safely by France, so that England's
    choices were to survive, voting for a draw that didn't include her, or be
    eliminated. Then the draw vote would just speed up the inevitable.)
    
    In GHODSTOO, I am perfectly willing to believe that France would under no
    circumstances have agreed to a nonDIAS draw that didn't include him. I
    can't think of any reason that Jon *would* have agreed to such a thing.
    
    By the way, most gm's (myself included) will *not* allow a DIAS setting to
    be changed in midgame, even with unanimous consent of the players. The
    reason is pretty obvious, so I won't bother to explain it.

    Okay, Edi. I guess what you are saying is you don't have any idea how you'd
    convince a survivor to vote for accepting a loss rather than striving for
    participation in a draw.
    
    
    I think what you have to do is start, very early in the game, a
    campaign to change the rules.  After all, the DIAS rules are pretty
    lame in a lot of respects.  They give equal weight to runty powers who
    just peter about most of the game, never achieving true greatness.
    Those remora-like powers who, even when they drop down to one SC,
    latch onto some greater neighbor, to weave their way back into the
    midgame, just to eliminate the mighty Kaiser Pitt on the last turn.
    
    Oh, wait, that got a little out of control :)
    
    Seriously, I've played DIAS and judge NoDIAS games for a few years.
    NoDIAS is essentially DIAS, as any power can veto a draw not including
    himself.  The combination of DIAS and HoF scoring gives equal weight
    to frontrunners who almost win and tiny powers who squeak into a draw.
    
    This summer, I played my first convention, where SCs were counted as
    part of a player's score.  My instinct was against this, but now I
    think I like this idea.  If the real purpose of the game is to try to
    win, isn't the 17-SC power somehow 'closer' to this goal than the tiny
    survivor?  The DIAS/HoF scoring has a definite effect upon how people
    play, which I'm not sure is good.
    
    In contrast, at AvalonCon, any coalition which controlled 29 SCs could
    impose a draw.  Yes, this favors 2-way draws much more than a DIAS
    game would.  It has its own downsides, such as late-game skirmishes
    between two 6-SC powers to stay about the elmination line.  But it
    rewards more aggressive play, which is something I like.  After a few
    years of playing this game, it becomes easy to develop a
    play-to-the-draw strategy.  You muddle about for a while, letting a
    frontrunner approach victory.  Then you make a lot of noise, and form
    a stop-the-leader coalition, which needs you as a vital participant.
    Finally, you clear out the chaff, and get your draw.  My problem with
    this approach is that it never includes any honest attempt to win the
    game.
    
    I seem to be implicitly criticizing Jamie for his play in this game.
    Well, that's just needling, as Jamie really should have died, and for
    him to reach the size he did is fairly miraculous.  And I know that
    Jamie will play for the win, and certainly both John and Hohn did so
    in this game.
    
    Well, my point seems to have wandered.  Suffice it to say that there
    is an argument to be made against DIAS, but you would have to make it
    early in the game, when it was not appearing to be a purely partisan
    move.

       Hm. No, I don't think that's right, actually.
       But I do think that good players would rarely vote for a draw that does not
       include them.
    
    Well, the key word is 'essentially', which in math speak means 'not
    really, but the difference is small and I don't care about it'.  For
    me, the only draws I would vote for in nonDIAS games which excluded me
    would be timesaver draws, i.e. I don't see any way to avoid
    elimination anyway.  Of course, not everybody thinks the same way.
    
    
       >If the real purpose of the game is to try to
       >win, isn't the 17-SC power somehow 'closer' to this goal than the tiny
       >survivor?
    
       "Somehow" it is. But is it closer in the relevant way?
    
    By one measure it is.  By another it isn't.
    
    
       What if we play chess, and at the end I have two knights and a king, and
       you have just a king. Hey, I think I'm closer to winning! But it's a draw.
       Or, maybe you have more pieces, but I sneak into a stalemate position. I
       would be pretty pissed if the scorekeeper insisted that the stalemate was
       just a technicality and awarded you a point and me nothing!
    
    That's different.  The stalemate is part of the rules.  Diplomacy
    rules really do not concern themselves with weighting draws.  (I know
    you can read the rules as imparting the spirit of DIAS, but they
    certainly do not do so explicitly, or in any way which measures the
    relative value of a win against a draw.  At AvalonCon this year, there
    was only one solo victory.  That player was not the overall winner, as
    another player had two 16-17 SC powers in two-way draws.  Debates
    about scoring systems are necessarily beyond the scope of the rules.)
    
    
       The aim of the game is to get 18 centers. So if you can't get the 18, you
       don't win! Close, but Diplomacy isn't horseshoes. And if you have 17 and I
       have one, but nobody can win without my letting them, I think I control the
       game as much as you do. I should get the same 'reward' you get. If you
       don't like it, you just try to eliminate me. If you can't, why do you
       deserve the win? Why do you deserve more of a win than I do?
    
    You don't.  Nobody deserves a win.  You perhaps deserve 'more of a
    draw', whatever that means.

       Hmmm. I'm not so sure it rewards aggressive play.
       It just changes *which* positions you have to play very defensively.
    
    I would have to see more games to judge.  But I think the combination
    of time constraints and the rules changes favor aggressive play.
    Which is not in my favor, as I tend to play games where I sit around
    for a long time in third place and hope to get an end-game advantage
    in 1920 or so.
    
       I like the usual Judge scoring, myself. I think board *position* is as
       important as number of centers, and so is diplomatic position. Seeing the
       game as reducible to the number of centers one controls is, well, kind of
       crass, in my opinion.
    
       Jamie
    
    Well, it's not really 'Judge scoring', it's HoF scoring, but that's a
    nitpick.  I don't reduce the game to the number of SCs controlled.
    But I do dislike play which is intentionally drawish (such as those
    hideous 8 SC-Englands which have eliminated Germany and France and
    control Portugal, but have no armies at all) and would prefer a system
    which rewards the players who have at least made a visible effort to
    try to reach 18 SCs over those players who really had no plan or
    intention ever to reach 18.

    Rick,
    
    Edi's just trying to keep me involved by getting me to shut down
    the game each time.
    
    Just to make it clear, as I understand it, the game will stay "active" as
    long as there is at least one press item sent in each one week period.
    
    Just briefly, I thought that Hohn and John's (hey, they rhyme!) comments
    on the endgame captured the accuracy of the matter from my point of view.
    It was very clear to me (reading things as they were going) that there
    was an extremely unlikely possibility that one of them would win, and
    otherwise it would be a three way draw between them and one other person.
    Jamie, as he stated pretty clearly, was the only one who really acted
    to ensure he would be that person.  All in all, from the GM's point of
    view, it was a pretty ho hum ending to what was a much more exciting
    and fluid midgame and early game.

    Why would that make me, a hapless power not being offered a spot in the
    draw, go along with it?  What do I care if Hohn adds one more success to his
    career?  Remember, you have to get everyone to agree, not the just the happy
    few being offered a spot in the winner's circle.

    Aha! A great recipe for making everyone vote for a two-way draw.
    
    Step One: get to 18 centers in a Spring move, making sure that nobody could
    take any of them back in the Fall.
    
    Step Two: propose draw.
    
    Step Three: vote for draw.

    Each person has his values and what is important in the event that he does
    not win.  In John's case I think HE would agree.  In your case maybe
    another approach is needed.   There is an old saying from the sixties on
    Diplomacy: it is the seven pieces around the table that are more important
    than the 34 pieces on it.

    Oh, that's true. But I think this is a good rule in chess, so I think a
    similar rule is good in Diplomacy.
    
    I do agree that there's nothing actually *wrong* with various different
    scoring methods. My views about this are on record ("Let a thousand scoring
    systems bloom"). I'm just explaining which method I prefer.

    Fair enough.

    Hm. But what about the guy who had a really awful plan to reach 18 centers,
    one which could easily be seen to be doomed to failure, stuck at 17? You
    want to reward him too?
    
    I want to reward the guy who took a little chance, left himself open to a
    significant stab that would (and in the event, did) reduce him to four
    centers, because he knew he would still hold a crucial position. Maybe he
    took the chance in going along with a not-very-stable alliance. Or maybe
    what held the alliance together was exactly the knowledge that each member
    could control a stalemate line. I think that's good, interesting play. I
    like people to take those chances. I want to give them these extra tools.
    Not just holding a big basket of centers, but also holding a crucial
    position.

    Well, that might not be me. I might be the short fat guy reading the newspaper.
    
    You just never know, Rick. That's the thing. But think about it, always
    think about it. I'm out there somewhere. Don't forget.

    Just a few comments from the peanut gallery:
    
    First, I must say that watching this game been an experience and an education.
    I've seen things done and said both inside and outside the game that have
    fascinated, intrigued and shocked me, things that I wouldn't have thought of
    doing or even dreamed of doing. It wasn't so much the moves that made the stabs,
    but the subtleties that led up to them that I found so educational. Watching a
    game of all top caliber players is something I think every novice or
    intermediate
    level player should do, even if they do nothing more than read the
    broadcast press
    and keep only the vaguest contact with what was actually going on in the game
    itself.
    
    Secondly, watching this game made me understand why I underestimated Hohn
    so much
    in the two games I've played face-to-face with him. I had no idea who he
    was at the
    time, and both times he surprised me with his knowledge of the game and
    ability to
    analyse and take advantage of situations as they arise. This may sound like
    unabashed
    flattery, but he is the only one of the Seven that I have met, and seeing
    him play
    both FTF and on the Judge was educational in itself.
    
    Finally, the perspectives brought into the 'outside' discussions made them
    lively
    and nearly every broadcast was something worth reading. (Most of the time,
    anyway.)
    For someone who is not in the 'Inner Circle' of the Dip World, those
    discussions shed
    light on topics that I had had only a cursory interest in before this game,
    and have
    been firmly lodged in my thick skull until I have the time to fully pursue
    those
    subjects.
    
    Congratulations to the Final Three, and thanks to everyone for playing in
    this game.
    It was truly a joy to watch.

    I'd rather not get into the middle of the debates unitl I have a chance to
    review the game a bit myself.
    
    I will say a couple of very general things at this point that might be
    helpful:
    
    1) Jamie was probably the best at communicating what he was really up
    to as the game progressed, closely followed by Hohn, in terms of private
    notes to the GM.  Mark also was pretty good about it while he was in the
    game.  Cal and John went through spurts where they updated me on where
    they were going and spurts where they did not.  Pitt and I had some
    very, very regrettable behind the scenes misunderstandings.  In all,
    it was a great shame that he has gone through a very eventful and not
    very pleasant 1997.  I sincerely wish that things look up for him into
    the holiday season.
    
    2) Watching Edi was fascinating!  I've always asserted that Edi was right
    up there with the best I've seen.  I now have greater insight into his
    powers and his weaknesses.  WIthout getting too detailed about it at the
    moment, he did what I think is one of the true marks of a great Dip
    player, he was always in the game and always in the middle of the game.
    Jamie at one point talks of letting Edi occupy the center stage in hopes
    of gaining ground quietly.  Edi seems to see that his personality makes
    it impossible to hide (and his record) so he's better off working it for
    the best.  One way to do that is to keep things shaken up.  I'm sure that
    at least one reason for the quadrapartite proposal was to send the game
    into an unusual early game position that he had analyzed better than any
    of the other players.  I was reading all the press and I was surprised by
    some of his moves.  While Edi did try very hard to keep me up to date on
    various aspects of his dealings, sometimes he appeared to be operating on
    levels I found difficult to follow.  This aspect of "raising the level of
    the game" as I have called it in my debates with Dan Shoham is my top
    Diplomacy player characteristic and Edi had it in spades.
    
    3) As the game simplified, Edi's advantages waned and once the game
    started to revolve around the stalemate line, from my perception
    everyone appeared to be operating on reasonably equal footing.
    Since the Judge and novice Judge players seemed to have very different
    views of the stalemate line and there was LOTS of posturing on all
    sides on that point, it seems to me that some discussion of the role
    of the stalemate line in this game is also in order.  Ultimately,
    this did turn into a pretty standard application of stalemate line
    DIp theory.
    
    4) The effect of the Judge itself was subtle.  I thought the rookies
    had the greatest problem trying to manage pace and flow of communications
    in the new medium (for them).  Mark, in particular, fell for the trap
    of the instant reply, while John appeared to manage the process with
    the most skill.  Hohn did well with this too, but some of it was
    his exploitation of his different time zone and busy work schedule.
    
    5) In my eyes it was a well matched game with diversity and talent.
    Pitt's illness shortened an interesting end game into a foregone
    conclusion.

    I have no particular view on this question. I wasn't interested in it at
    the time, because I was trying desperately to survive. :-)
    
    Tentatively, I will say that it does kind of seem like Hohn had only a
    smallish chance of winning once he stabbed Edi. I guess he had to hope that
    France and Germany would get very tangled up together and not be able to
    bury the hatchet in time to set up a line to contain Turkey.
    
    I have to admit that this is about the weakest aspect of my own game. I
    have a lot of trouble seeing through that part of the middle game. The pure
    tactical aspects are *so* complicated, and the broader considerations have
    not yet clarified for me, when, say, in 1907 I have to assess what I have
    to do to be where I want to be in 1910.
    
    In this particular game, of course, I didn't have the luxury of worrying
    about how to position myself in the midgame to have the best winning
    chances in the ending.

    Edi, I'd like to see you explain your reasoning.
    
    Looking at the board at the time I stabbed you, I didn't see any way
    in hell for the two of us to prosper while working together.  I
    especially didn't see a way for _me_ to prosper if I'd acceded to your

    	ENGLAND's eog statement for GHODSTOO
    
    		(another installment)
    
    		   The Opening
    		   -----------
    
    As the observers never discovered, and as at least many of the players I
    think did know, there was a AIRE alliance at the outset. Edi suggested it.
    I liked the idea. For one thing, as Edi noted, it would be unusual, and
    that's a plus for a demo game. For another, it seemed to me that it would
    be quite advantageous to me, England, if it all held up. And, of course,
    what I feared most in the opening was a GF alliance against me, or a very
    northward-leaning Russia, and the AIRE plan seemed to be a good way to
    eliminate such potential problems. So I opened very strong toward France,
    something I am not generally inclined to do.
    
    Now, much of the diplomacy in the early phases was shot through with what I
    can only call paranoia about Edi Birsan. I loved this. I tried to fan the
    flames at every opportunity. The more everyone was looking at Austria (even
    over their shoulders), the less trouble for me (so I thought!). And, if the
    AIRE held up for a while, it meant that Russia and Italy would be thinking
    of Austria as their next target, after the demise of the unalligned powers.
    And that would surely be very good for me. I could just pick my channel of
    expansion: the Mediterranean, over the top into Russia, or through the
    middle with armies into Germany and then Central Europe. The prospects
    appeared fine indeed.
    
    But a huge problem emerged rapidly, to put it mildly. First, I'd failed to
    count on Pitt being much cagier than the average player. This was really
    stupid. I think my worst mistakes in the game were diplomatic, misjudging
    the characters of the players. But my worst *strategic* mistake was in
    overlooking how my opening would appear to Germany, and what he would be
    most sensible to do in response. He quite rightly saw that I would be
    growing alarmingly fast, and that I would be able to choose my enemies, if
    France fell as rapidly as it looked like he might. And he saw me snatch
    Belgium, appear very confident of being able to take Norway later (!!!),
    with all signs of close ties to Italy and Russia. So he stabbed me when it
    was most effective. This was strategically disastrous.
    
    At the same time, the AIRE alliance fell to pieces, exactly because of the
    Birsan-paranoia I had encouraged. Italy and Russia went for Austria. Russia
    stole Norway. Italy let France off the hook. I was in big, big trouble. So
    the turning point in the game came very, very early for me. Not only was my
    tactical position wrecked, but my attitudes toward all the players changed.
    
    First, I now had to view France as my potential savior, even though he was
    the only power I had attacked -- an uncomfortable situation! But I had some
    hopes. I'd tried to stay on good terms with John even while I was invading
    him; not that I really thought I'd ever need his goodwill, but you never
    know.
    Second, I had been thinking of Russia as my major ally, my "last enemy"
    (there are no lifelong friends in Diplomacy, your best friend is really
    just your last enemy. Deep, isn't it?). But he'd just stuck me by taking
    Norway. This was one of those (numerous) cases in which I am stabbed, and
    because I'm taken by surprise I feel that the stab must have been a dumb
    move (otherwise I would have expected it). (This was not the case when Pitt
    stabbed me. I could see that the dumbness was mine there.) Russia was
    fighting Turkey, he was stabbing Austria, and now he was opening a third
    front! Insanity. I wanted to punish him, or at least I wanted it to emerge
    that taking Norway was a really dumb move. I almost decided to chuck it all
    and destroy the Russian position with my last gasps. But I decided to
    inflict punishment by haranguing Mark endlessly instead. I think Mark will
    agree that this was a pretty harsh punishment. :-)
    
    Third, I now regarded Turkey as my only definite friend. I tried to make
    use of him, but to no real avail. (I didn't blame him, either.)
    
    Fourth, I felt that Italy's abandonment of the invasion of France was an
    indirect stab of me.
    
    And fifth, I felt that somehow Austria was responsible for the whole thing.
    (So I guess some of that paranoia was rubbing off!)
    
    Putting the goal of a really good finish on the back burner, I adopted as
    my goal to see as many of my betrayers eliminated as possible before I felt
    the final axe myself. (I hoped to get a little revenge against Germany,
    too, but this was the lowest priority.) For this reason I decided to try to
    hold out as long as I could, maybe exerting some diplomatic influence in
    the midgame, rather than to play all my on-the-board cards at once to
    avenge myself against Russia.
    
    I have to say that I thought the Russian and Italian openings made no sense
    at all. If they were going to stab Austria in 1902, it would have made a
    lot more sense to begin in 1901 instead. As it worked out, Italy was way
    out of position, and had to tip the attack by shifting his fleets eastward.
    Russia got little out of 1901 except a Turkish enemy. Nor could I see
    anything in particular that happened in 1901 that Russia and Italy couldn't
    have expected beforehand. It's not as though it was a great surprise that
    Italy couldn't just scoop up the French and Iberian centers quickly without
    resistance! Everyone knows that is a difficult attack, one that bears fruit
    only after a couple of years. (I'm really just saying this to get Cal and
    Mark to say something. Oooh, maybe I'd better inform Mark that the game is
    over!)
    
    
    
    The Opening portion of the game was awfully short, as far as I'm concerned.
    Once the AIRE fell apart, after exactly one year!, the Opening was over for
    me, I had to adjust my goals and strategies.
    
    I guess I'll send in my thoughts about the midgame another time.

    Well, well...a three way draw.  I have always felt that a perfect game of
    Diplomacy ends in a three draw...but more on a strategic stalemate than a
    tactical one.
    
    I still think that if Hohn had kept to his original ally that there would have
    been a better possibility for  a two way or even a frightening run at a win
    for either of us if we wanted to gamble.  But that was not to be this time.
    
    Congradulations to all and hope to see you again at the World Con and other
    games.

    	ENGLAND's eog comments on GHODSTOO
    		(a first installment)
    
    Here I'll just remark on the endgame, while I have fresh thoughts about it.
    
    First off, let me say that I was sorry to hear that Pitt had been ill. I
    didn't know until he mentioned it recently on r.g.d.
    
    The ending was fairly interesting, I thought. Leaving aside the question of
    *when* Turkey would annihilate his Italian friend (there wasn't much
    question about *whether*), the main issue seemed to be how and whether the
    FEG coalition would hold together. The problem, as became very obvious, was
    that it might/would become too easy for me and France to eliminate Germany
    in the very final stages to reduce the draw. Pitt had to try to find some
    way to make himself indispensible. His general approach seemed right, only
    the details weren't sufficiently worked out.
    
    As an aside, Edi asked whether it was really 'worth the trouble'. But of
    course, it was no trouble! Edi also noted that his attitude is that a draw
    is exactly as good as being eliminated. Well, not to me!
    
    Working backwards, in the last year there were few choices left. With my
    fleet in Sweden, I could order it to Finland, and if I got there I would
    have Stp locked. (I could prevent Turkey ever taking it, and eventually I
    would be able to take it myself.) Similarly, it was a trivial matter to get
    France into Berlin, consolidating his forces (which he desperately needed
    to do to make sure of being able to block a Turkish win). Of course,
    Germany could see this, and we could see that he could see it, and so on,
    but all this knowledge was to no avail. If Germany wanted to throw the
    game, this was his last chance. But in effect there was no more incentive
    for him to threaten to throw it, since it would be a threat he would have
    to carry out immediately. There was no promise, at *that* point, that he
    could extract, no demands he could make. If he ordered Stp-Fin, or Ber-Kie,
    he'd just be throwing it. If he didn't, he'd be eliminated. He was stuck.
    
    Ideally, theoretically, I shouldn't have let this situation arise. For
    Germany now had no incentive *not* to throw the game, either. I shouldn't
    have let the position evolve into one in which Germany *could* throw the
    game and had no incentive not to. I should have done something earlier to
    prevent the situation from arising. I believe that the last moment to do
    this was when I was considering capturing Sweden. If Pitt had strenuously
    demanded that I leave it for him, and further than I *never* bring a unit
    next to Finland, then I think he could have managed to survive. Maybe. I'm
    not absolutely sure. Possibly Hohn could have backed away from the
    stalemate line, far enough to make it possible for me to eliminate Germany
    safely anyway.
    
    In any case, in F1910 Pitt did ask me to leave Sweden for him, but he
    didn't explain or threaten sufficiently for me to take him seriously. I
    decided that he wasn't paying very close attention. (Actually I had decided
    this much earlier.) [And I now figure it was because of his illness.] So I
    took it, and I think at that point the ending was forced. With no more
    threats, Pitt had to decide whether he was just going to throw it, or
    whether he'd have to trust to my Gentle dispositions or something. I guess
    he felt that there was enough of a chance that I'd want him around, just
    for some unambitious, non-greedy reason. But I was still cutthroat enough
    to want to reduce the draw, and for that matter to extract the final
    revenge against the last suriviving power that had stabbed me earlier.
    
    
    Maybe some of the late Italian moves should be counted as part of the
    endgame. I guess the *late* Italian moves were all more or less irrelevant.
    Once Turkey had surrounded the Boot, there appeared to be no hope at all of
    Italian surivival.

    Let me be the second (Jamie always gets in there first) to congratulate
    Hohn, John, and especially Jamie on the three way draw outcome.  It is
    said by many (and I basically agree) that the most likely outcome for
    a game played among experts should be a three way draw.  Moreover,
    all three of the draw participants were at one point or another
    "on the ropes" and Jamie in particular was very close to elimination.
    Other than Jamie, three of the four participants in an early
    "quadrapartite" alliance were eliminated, and I would argue that
    all four "should" have been eliminated, if not for the force of Jamie's
    will that brought him back into the final draw.  As Rick previously
    noted, Jamie has a "talent" for doing that in expert games.
    
    This is not a substitute for the GM's full fledged end game statement,
    but it is a request for assistance in figuring out where to put this
    archive of material I have collected on the game and to ask when I
    should make it available to the players.
    
    I enjoyed GMing my first Judge game and I appreciate all of your patience
    in bearing with me as I worked out incrementally how and what I should
    be doing.  In particular, at some point I want to comment on the effect
    of the Judge and the electronic medium upon the outcome of the game.
    The players who were rookies with the Judge were the ones eliminated.
    That presumably is not completely a coincidence.
    
    That's all I have to say at this point, but I look forward to everyone's
    larger statements on the game and to archiving this game somewhere so
    people can look at it.  Then I will be writing a general commentary
    on the entire game and publishing it in my Diplomacy szine.
    
    Thanks to all the Players and Observers!

    Geez, holding off both while working with neither?  You have a higher
    opinion of my tactical ability than *I* do, that's for sure! d:})
    
    Obviously, we can go on debating this, but we'll never really know, will
    we?  Suffice it to say that, from the eastern end of the board (distance
    equals different perspective?), it appeared to me (and to Hohn as well
    as he said in his end game statement) that it really seemed that there
    was a risk of a French victory.  You must understand, I was looking at
    it from a POTENTIAL point of view.  That is, should France have been
    able to deal with England & Germany in any reasonably quick fashion, he
    WOULD have been across the stalemate line and THAT is what was worrying
    me.  Sure, it may not have ended up tactically feasible, but in any game
    at this level, I'm not going to take a chance like that.  I KNEW I could
    stop Hohn from the win; I wasn't so sure about France.

    Working mainly with France, I was thinking, but in case France seemed to be

    Hmmm.
    I don't know which 18 centers you thought France might have in this
    potential victory.
    I am saying that you could have kept him from taking Tunis or any of your
    home centers.
    
    Also, which were you primarily trying to do: (i) keep Turkey and France
    from winning, or (ii) be a part of a draw? Your actual decision may have
    been the best way to achieve (i), but I think another choice would have
    been a much better bet to achieve (ii).

    The French, German & English home centres (9), plus Iberia (2),
    Scandinavia (3), the Lowlands (2) & St Pete's make 17.  Warsaw or Tunis
    were potential winning centres.  They may not have been gained easily
    but they were posssible.  I didn't care to gamble on anything at that
    point.

    The way it turned out, yes, but I was thinking at the time that you and
    Pitt were on the way to elimination.  I knew somebody had to be the
    power that prevented the game from going to 17-17.  I was trying to put
    myself in that position when you were probably just thinking about
    survival. :)

    Sorry for my silence lately; work, and all that.
    
    Regarding the now mostly dead-and-buried statistical argument, I can't
    speak as to statistical accuracy in its purist form; I never took any
    statistics in school.  My opinion on the matter is close or identical
    to Rick's though.  I feel that taking centers into account for draws
    is one valid scoring system, and that by not using it, you are
    effectively throwing away useful information.
    
    Regarding John and his chances of victory, when we both hit 10 on the
    same turn, I was extremely worried about him.  I saw German resistance
    crumbling, and I saw John's potential 18 as: FRANCE, GERMANY, ENGLAND,
    Scandinavia, Iberia, Low Countries, STP, and WAR as the 18th.  He
    could have gotten WAR guaranteed, eventually, had he been able to keep
    his Tyrolian raider on the board.  Thus my concern.
    
    I think the concern was legitimate, too, and had John pressed things
    more aggressively, I think he and I would have both come down to the
    wire in terms of possible victory.  I also think Cal's initial
    concerns were legitimate.
    
    As the game wore on, though, I saw John's chances of victory recede,
    although I kept up my doomsaying to Cal in an effort to keep him on my
    side.  The last few years, IIRC, I was pretty well convinced that the
    game would either end in a three-way or a solo for me.

    Just to give you all an update.... what I'm doing is saving all
    of this press with the original game press.  On this Wednesday,
    I will close off the gates and send the entire package to Ryan Brase
    who will be putting it on the Diplomatic Pouch web page.  He is
    one of those student types, I think, and we assures me that he
    will get it up over the Thanksgiving weekend.  Comments after that
    to the "game" will be discouraged (i.e. I won't be saving them any more)
    and we will move the discussion to the letter column for Diplomatic
    Pouch.  I then will finish my article on the game which will go
    there as well as in my szine.
    
    Is that OK with everyone?  Ryan wasn't going to be able to get to
    it until Thanksgiving anyway, so I thought it would be better to
    keep this forum going until then.  I know you all are SOOOO
    curious.

    Thanks, Jim, that was helpful.
    
    I don't really think that Hohn and I are as far apart as it may look on the
    issue. (I think we both like making mountains out of molehills, for one
    thing :-)) And actually, I've probably advanced my own thoughts more in the
    last three broadcasts than I had in years. I feel I understand what a
    reasonable scoring system must be now much better than I did last week.

<p><a name=66></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=000000>Master</font>:</b><pre>
    I've not copied Jamie's message so as not to make the thread even
    longer and more convoluted, but I agree with him.  The point of
    designing a rating system that weighted smaller powers in a draw
    greater than larger powers in a draw (admittedly with tongue slightly
    in cheek) was to suggest how incentives to go for the win and not
    just settle for being the largest power in a draw would promote
    win oriented play all around.  It also will actually be HARDER
    for a small power to get into a draw if they will be the one who
    scores the most "points".  As John and Hohn pondered the two-way
    possibilities, they might have given them more weight if they
    realized that Jamie would benefit more than they would in the 3-way.
    Don't get me wrong, I still think the three way was the natural
    result in this case at that point, I'm just trying to get you
    to visualize the twist.
    
    More generally, what counts is how decisions are made under existing
    uncertain conditions, not a post-mortem after all relevant states
    of nature have been realized.  Personally, (and Hohn most emphatically
    was NOT doing this) I find the kind of play that pushes to the 17
    center stalemate line and just sits there and waits for the game to
    end to be really boring and nearly morally reprehensible (possibly
    two sides of the same coin).  To this observer, you had top quality
    players in this game trying to work their way to that razor edge win
    in the only way you can with other players of the same quality --
    carefully and deliberately, with a good degree of misdirection
    mixed in.
    
    Without belaboring the details of the exchange, I don't see why
    Jamie and Hohn can't reach a communication equilibrium on this.
    The knife's edge is VERY hard to balance on between their positions.

    Huh?
    :-)
    
    So am I, of course.
    
    Put it this way: there is exactly one measure of playing 'well': the chance
    that your play gives you of winning the game. A strategy that gives you a
    30% chance of winning by laying low with just five centers for most of the
    game is most definitely better than one that gives you a 20% chance of
    winning by running out to sixteen centers and hoping the other powers don't
    gang up to stop you. If a good scoring system is to reward good play, then,
    it must reward proportionally to probabilities.
    
    So, I say, let these higher probabilities *be* your higher reward. Of
    course, sometimes you get unlucky, sometimes you have played especially
    well, given yourself an especially high chance of winning, but you get a bad
    break or two in the ending and don't win after all. That's ok, you got your
    reward: your higher chance.
    (Think of how the NBA draft awards more lottery tickets, or pingpong balls,
    to the teams with the worst records. When the team with the largest number
    of tickets doesn't get one of the very best picks, that's the breaks--they
    obviously can't complain that the system wasn't fair. It was fair. They
    *were* given something valuable that the other teams didn't get.)
    
    The reason I was talking about winning 'more often' is that speaking of long
    run frequencies is often a good way of clarifying points about probabilities.
    
    >With respect to one particular game, a person with 17 probably has
    >played a better game than a person with one.  More strategies were
    >successful, better decisions were made, etc. etc.
    
    I'm afraid I just don't agree with you about that. It's like saying the
    football team that gains more yards has played a better game. Not so --
    gaining yards is obviously important, but only insofar as it advances your
    chance of victory.
    Oh, now I see you said 'probably'. That may well be true. Yes, I'd have to
    agree with you, the power with 17 centers is on average played better than
    the one with two at the finish.
    
    > Personally, I feel
    >your attempt to analyze broad trends, over the course of time, is
    >inapposite to this particular issue.  I'm not talking about any given
    >player's overall skill, or who is a "better" or a "worse" player.  I'm
    >talking about any given player's overall performance in _one_ game.
    
    That's fine. I was mentioning broad trends *only* as a way of clarifying the
    probability point. Though as I've said, and as I'm about to explain a bit
    further, there is an intrinsic link between probabilities and long run
    frequencies....
    
    
    >But when it comes to scoring, you need to look at the particular game.
    >And if you do that, _anyone_ can subsequently establish trends and
    >generate a general index/player rating system.  And I suspect it'd

    I'm not following you here. Anyone can do what? Look at the particular game
    and subsequently establish trends and... I just don't understand what you mean.
    
    It certainly seems to me that a *good* scoring system will be one that over
    the long run is rating the better players higher. Isn't that fairly obvious?
    Naturally, it may not give the 'true' ranking just after one game, because
    (and this is a good time to remind us all of this point!) performance in a
    single game is apt to be due a *great* deal to luck, and only a little bit
    to talent. I have always thought this was quite obvious, myself. It's one
    way I manage not to get depressed when I'm eliminated, and not to feel too
    impressed with myself when I win. In any case, the only sensible test for a
    scoring system is how it performs over the long run. Fortunately, a system
    that follows my view about rewarding players for increasing their
    *probability* of success is extremely likely to 'rank truly' in the long
    run. (The Law of Large Numbers says so.)

    In tournament play there is often no time to play to an 18 center victory.
    You have to have some substitute.
    
    My *hunch* is that the idea Rick mentioned (I think it was Rick) of allowing
    any coaltion that controls 29 centers together (or was it 23? twenty
    something, anyway) to declare joint victory, is a better system than
    counting centers. But I'd have to think about that hard to have any settled
    view about it.

    Huh?
    
    I'm not talking about trends.  I'm talking about recognizing
    individual play in any particular _game_.
    
    With respect to one particular game, a person with 17 probably has
    played a better game than a person with one.  More strategies were
    successful, better decisions were made, etc. etc.  Personally, I feel
    your attempt to analyze broad trends, over the course of time, is
    inapposite to this particular issue.  I'm not talking about any given
    player's overall skill, or who is a "better" or a "worse" player.  I'm
    talking about any given player's overall performance in _one_ game.
    I've had inspired games, where I've played very well.  I've also had
    shitty games where I played like, well, shit.  It happens.
    
    But when it comes to scoring, you need to look at the particular game.
    And if you do that, _anyone_ can subsequently establish trends and
    generate a general index/player rating system.  And I suspect it'd
    still be pretty consistent with what we have now, to be honest.
    
    To reiterate, though, I do think individual centers are important to
    the determination of who has done well in any given game.

    I used to believe that it was more impressive to survive as a small
    power in a draw than as a large power.  Then I did it 20-25 times.
    Now I'm of the completely opposite opinion.
    
    To stick around as a small power, all you have to do is not offend
    anybody and play reasonable defense.  With some countries it is easier
    than others, notably England and Turkey, and to a lesser extent France
    and Italy.  To finish as a large power, you have to get away with
    making aggressive moves.  You have to break down other players'
    defenses.  You have to meet on the battlefield and win.
    
    To survive as a small power, you often only have to meet on the
    battlefield and lose slowly.
    
    To survive as a large power, you will need diplomatic successes.
    You can sometimes survive as a small power in spite of diplomatic
    failures.
    
    In short, the fact that I find it relatively easy to finish as a small
    power in a draw compared to finish as a large power in a draw makes me
    view the latter task as one which ought to be more respected.
    
    Of course, finishing as a small power in a draw beats the hell out of
    losing! :)

    First of all, how do you figure you could have _gotten_ to 18, Edi?
    Or anywhere close?  Let's talk specific center distribution, please.
    Under what possible circumstances could this scenario exist?  How
    would we have gotten there?
    
    Second, if you think I'd have gone along with any of the above that
    you suggest, demo game or no, history of working well together or no,
    you are badly mistaken.
    
    I'm all for negotiated two-ways in FTF games, where DIAS is not a
    factor.  But my level of paranoia ramps way, way up in DIAS games, and
    if any ally of mine is on the verge of victory, I'll generally try to
    either take the victory myself or make sure my ally doesn't steal it.
    Usually this requires either carefully planned expansion, or a
    third-party buffer state.  Alternatively, on extremely rare occasions
    (and I did this in a game called "shadow," where France and my England
    split a two-way just because of the incredible synchronicity and
    goodwill we had built up over the course of the game, and because it
    would have been a stylish ending, despite the fact that either of us
    could have taken a solo at any time), the trust and "what the heck"
    attitude can exist to do a two-way DIAS without the carefully planned
    expansion.
    
    I don't think that would have happened here, Edi.  As Austria to my
    Turkey, if we'd truly managed to succeed together to the extent
    that we were both in the mid-high teens (which I doubt), I likely
    would have found the temptation to stab you (as it is especially easy
    for T to stab A in such alliances) to be too great.

    Hohn, have you ever seen my "reverse" center count scoring system
    that rewards small powers more than large ones (Jamie, you would
    have liked that here) whose basic premise is that small powers
    voted into the draw have done the "most work"?  More broadly,
    the system is designed to increase incentives to eliminate those
    small powers (it's not a pure center count but relative center count
    within the draw) and force larger powers to go for the win.
    
    I will back up the assertion that Hohn always had the win on his mind,
    at least he repeatedly mentions it in his notes to me during the game.

    Regarding draws/centers, I do think centers are an important indicator
    of game play and relative performances, to be honest, and I think they
    should be taken into account in scoring systems.  Because the more
    centers you have, the greater the likelihood that you have played a
    good game with successful strategies, whether it be good tactics,
    fooling your neighbors, or exploiting a good alliance.
    
    Sure, I respect the one-center guy who forces himself into a crucial
    role and into the draw.  That's good play.  But the bigger guy not
    only managed good play to make it to the final draw, he also managed
    to survive and prosper.
    
    Centers are a measuring stick.  Considering the goal is to reach 18 of
    those centers, I personally think that any scoring system which does
    _not_ take center performance into account is a less desirable one.
    
    Please keep in mind this is undoubtedly biased by my predominantly FTF
    experiences, which almost always have scoring systems based on
    centers.

    To be blunt, as several others have also stated, I think your argument
    here is utterly meritless, Edi.  If we'd wanted NoDIAS, we easily
    could have done it that way from the start.
    
    I _like_ DIAS.  I think it's more challenging, and I think that it has
    helped my endgame play enormously since I started playing it.  I like
    DIAS even though it takes away the thing that I'm probably most known
    for in FTF games, and that is the negotiated victory.
    
    So I see no need for "revolt" against the system, or anything of that
    sort.  We had the choice.  We chose DIAS.
    
    > By turning on Austria you surrendered

    That's crap, Edi.  I was always looking for the win.  And despite your
    claim that the only result could be a three-way after I stabbed you,
    any number of reasonably probable occurrences could have resulted in
    my victory.  The fact that those things didn't occur is hindsight.  At
    the time I stabbed you, I felt I had a reasonable chance of winning.
    And even though I didn't, I think the game bears witness to the fact
    that I had a decent shot at it.

    the final three, Edi.

    Because Pitt was absolutely unnecessary to the stalemate line, and
    given the positions in spring of the final year, he had no way of
    stopping an elimination.  In this case, any promises would have to be
    hollow ones, due to the simultaneous moves processing present in Dip.
    You guys were already bordering him; it's not like he could warn you
    off.  And unless you were going to cut him in on the draw for free,
    out of the goodness of your hearts (yeah, right ;) ), he was a goner.
    
    That's why I would have thrown the game to the Turkish position, were
    I playing Germany.  For the sake of credibility and revenge, if
    nothing else.

    Impossible to quantify.  Qualitatively, I think my chances of winning
    were greater the way I did it than they would have been had I conceded
    to Edi's requests the critical turn that I stabbed him.

    Exactly so, IMO.  But I think the first one was improbable enough
    given the situation that my alternative action looked better to me.

    Hm, that was interesting.
    
    I finally understand what Cal was thinking in the opening!
    
    I couldn't figure it out. Tactically, it was completely incoherent. Italy
    opens westward, the moves on the board go exactly as could be expected, and
    then Italy immediately turns around and heads east. Since nothing unexpected
    happened, why didn't he go east to begin with??
    
    
    
    But of course, the explanation was entirely off the board. Cal was
    hoping/expecting to hear a certain attitude from Edi, but heard quite the
    opposite song.
    
    
    I do not agree with Cal's remarks about the late midgame, though. It would
    certainly not have been easy, as Cal says, for France to eliminate both
    Germany and England by himself, even assuming Italy could have held off an
    AustroTurkish alliance. And even if France *HAD* eliminated both me and
    Pitt, he *still* would not have been able to win, I think. So personally I
    think that was Cal's best chance, to control his own centers and Tunis while
    keeping Hohn to the east and John to the west.
    
    -Jamie
    
</pre>
<p><a name=77></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=008800>Italy</font>:</b><pre>
    Guess it's about time I put SOMETHING down on electronic paper about
    this game.  Not that my role was anything to brag about -  I never DID
    get anything momentum going and wasn't able to play as much of a part in
    the final outcome as I would have liked to have done.
    
    The one big mistake I made this game was in being a bit taken by the
    fact that it was a demonstration game.  I thought, and a few others
    agreed with me, that it would be nice to do something unusual for a
    change.  Edi's idea of a "quadripartite" alliance appealed to my sense
    of the bizarre.  Basically, I would attack France, Edi's Austria &
    Mark's Russia would attack both Germany & Turkey.  The attack on Germany
    would be made in conjunction with Jamie's England.  Neat plan which
    might have worked in theory except for two things:
    
    1) Edi's negotiating style.  He flat out refused every single suggestion
    that he should make ANY move that would commit him to ANY course of
    action.  That gave the impression that he was going to play every side
    of the fence no matter what happened.  That can only work for so long.
    
    2) Mark's playing style.  Mark was very nervous about being in a demo
    game and was especially concerned about being next to Edi (I had a touch
    of that myself.  I have a great deal of respect for Edi's skills -
    we've butted heads over a few games of FTF 2-player Escalation Dip).
    This meant that he was hypersensitive to Edi's lack of commitment to
    anything.  Mark liked the idea of the "quadripartite" at first, but the
    more Edi vascillated, the more nervous Mark got. This lead to our "stab"
    of Edi in 1902.
    
    That ill fated stab (as well as the initial westward move in S'01) was
    what led to me spinning my wheels for the whole game.  I ended up being
    in a position of having to almost beg Mark or Jamie, depending on what
    year it was, to let me get an extra centre or two to use against Edi,
    Hohn or Edi/Hohn.  I was never able to gather up enough centres to be a
    real factor militarily.  I spent the mid-game making no progress on any
    front.
    
    Once end-game rolled around, I ended up in the position that I feared
    was coming for almost the whole game.  I had to find a way to make
    myself become the vital third wheel in a stalemate line between France
    and Turkey.  I did a pretty good job of that but, unfortunately, a
    couple of things got in the way:
    
    1) France's decision to let England back in the game.  (I never
    understand things like that; if you take a small opponent right out of
    the game, you never have to worry about him again).  That let a second
    country vie for the position I was trying to achieve;
    
    2) I faced a choice of letting Hohn go past the Italian peninsula and
    taking a chance that he might win with 18 centres, or moving west
    myself  and pretty much ensuring that Hohn would take my open centres.
    I chose option #1 for two reasons.  First, if I remained on or near my
    homeland, there was a chance that Hohn would leave some vital strategic
    space open that I could slip into.  If he had held off on his final stab
    ONE more season, I would have been in the Aegean and had some REAL
    leverage.  (Didn't know that, did you, Hohn?  Heh heh).  Secondly, since
    option two, in my opinion, GUARANTEED that I would eventually be taken
    out, I figured it was better to cling to some faint hope that Hohn would
    choose me over Jamie as being deserving of being in the draw.  I'm still
    not sure why he chose to put me out of the draw, especially when he
    did.  I can understand stabbing to at least TRY for the win, but France
    seemed amenable to taking England out as the loser in the three way draw
    sweepstakes and Hohn could have always stabbed LATER to try for the win
    (there were obviously some background dealings of which I wasn't a party
    to...)
    
    I know that some (read "most"  if not all) of you thought I was being
    naive by supporting Hohn against the F/E/G alliance, especially in light
    of the fact that it seemed inevitable I would get stabbed.  While I
    think the above explains my logic, I also want to add that John's end
    game statement shows that he was unaware of how close he was to taking a
    real good shot at an 18 centre victory.  Hohn will, I believe, support
    me on this.  France could have taken E/G out fairly quickly and, as long
    as he did it one victim at a time, he could have been across the
    stalemate line in Munich & St Pete's.  He would have only needed Jamie's
    goodwill for a short time to achieve this.  Meanwhile, if *I* had gone
    against Hohn, France could have even gotten himself in a position to
    take Tunis and an Italian centre or two.  Only John's relatively
    non-aggressive (for a Dip game) playing style, I think, prevented him
    from seeing this.
    
    To sum up, I may not have survived, but I believe I prevented a solo
    winner.  I'll take solice in that during this cold Canadian winter
    (sounds of violins, children shouting and the crack of a puck against
    the boards in the background...)...
    
    All in all, a very enjoyable game.  Certainly it was very challenging.
    Most of the games I have played in the last dozen or so years have been
    tainted by one or more players who's skill level didn't match the rest
    of the board. That was certainly not the case in this game.
    
    I expect to be at DipCon in Chapel Hill next summer.  If anybody here is
    planning on attending, let's get together for a round of drinks and
    recriminations, shall we?  :)

    This technically and factually incorrect.  If you all would review the Quad
    alliance proposals, I as Austria did exactly what I said I would do.  My
    Spring, Fall and Winter 1901 builds were exactly what was called for.  In
    Spring of 1902 I was stabbed by Russia as suspected and surprised by the
    Italian stab.  From that point on I had every right to insist on a on board
    demonstration of the intent of the Italians to pull back from me.  It
    should be noted that in Spring 02 I moved into a perfect position to take
    on the Turks if there had been a sign from the Italians of anything other
    than a double cross.  Throughout the game's early period and carrying on
    throughout the game Cal continued to give me false statements and to
    perceive a strategic concept of things that did not facilitate trust,
    therefore my response to him was that he had to 'show me the truth' with
    his moves, which he never did.
    
    As for Mark, from my winter 1901 phone conversation with him I did not
    trust him and felt that we was habitually committed to attacking me, again
    combined with a perception of his game strategic view that did not
    encourage trust.
    
    Time and time again, as the communications probably show, I offered Cal
    various deals which would have allowed for a check on Hohn and the
    potential for something viable to develop between Cal and I, and time and
    time again Italy moved against me.
    
    I try different styles with different people based on what is going on in
    the game.
    Certainly my style with Hohn was far from lacking to make commitments.
    What is missing in Cal's interesting summary is that there is a
    relationship between the way people respond to you based on what is going
    on in the game as that players properly employ a whole range of negotiating
    styles at the higher intensity levels of play.
    
    What would be interesting to carry on the 'demonstrating' side of things is
    to go over the situation where you feel that the other player's negotiating
    style is not what you want, then how to do you go about changing it and
    seeing your own part in it.
    
    For example from my perspective with Italy, he was unable to be trusted at
    any time and that a single turns miscalculation on my part would have left
    me decimated.  Going over the moves retrospectively I still can see any
    turn after Spring 02 that I could have tactically trusted Italy and not
    avoid a catastrophe.  In quite the opposite view there were numerous
    postiions where Italy could have trusted in my actions without negative
    consequences on his part in order to re-establish relations.  This tactical
    interplay of trust is often overlooked and something that I strove again
    and again with Italy to create but failed.  When the tactical consequences
    are so overwhelmingly one sided there is no real basis for trust to be
    re-established so it behooves the less threatened position to create a
    tactical 'breathing time' for the negotiations to be redone.  Italy never
    did this and my negotiating style with him reflected the fact that I could
    never risk guessing wrong with him.
    
    I would be interested in hearing from Cal on what move and what was he
    expecting me to say that would have resulted in his halting the unending
    attack on Austria that was his visible actions from Spring 1902?

    It can be, but as I said, it is also very possible to have that happen
    regardless of your diplomacy.  Someone is going to come under attack.  If
    everyone involved is conducting "good" diplomacy, that is still going to happen.

    That's what I mean.  Sometimes you can coast to a five-center position in a
    draw, other times you have to work your tail off.  To me, it is advantageous
    to keep it objective.  A draw is a draw.  The players involved should get
    equal credit.  If the big powers don't want the little guy to get credit,
    then they should work out a way to eliminate him.  It adds to the challenge.
    Eliminating the little guy usually involves trust and cooperation between
    two long-time enemies.  There's no way the little guy can stand up
    militarily.  So, I suppose it could be viewed as a failure of diplomacy if
    the two big powers can't find a way to work together.  If they want a bigger
    reward, they should be forced to overcome that barrier.  If they can't, I'd
    say the small power has done his job well.

    Yes, it is.  But that doesn't answer the question.  Didn't the 15-center
    power play much better than the 1-center power?  Isn't the argument here
    that large powers on average have played better than small powers?  My whole
    point, as I proudly wave the small-power banner, is that if you can't be
    eliminated, you should get an equal part of the draw.  I don't care if
    you're at one or five or seventeen.  If the big powers don't want the small
    power to get a piece of the pie, eliminate him.  You've got the firepower.
    Do what it is needed.  Back off that line, set up a line over there,  find a
    set-up that allows you to trust one another long enough to reduce the draw.
    If you can't, split the point evenly among the survivors.

    Exasperating.  Isn't that what this whole discussion is about?  Basing
    points in a draw on number of centers?

    Sorry.  There were a lot of posts and I slipped in "very" by mistake.  But I
    still say that just because you find it easy doesn't mean everyone does.  I
    find it hard to stay that small without becoming a target which probably
    just says that you're a better diplomat than I am.  Or that our styles are
    different.  For me, the easiest game is to stay in 2nd or 3rd place, pick an
    opportune moment to point to the leader and yell "Fire!" as loud as I can,
    and try to slip by in the confusion.  Others seem to find that having the
    most centers offsets the disadvantage of attracting unwelcome attention.  I
    find that style and your style to be harder for me to play.

    I may not have made myself clear here.  I don't believe players should
    achieve a high ranking simply by playing lots of games.  In other words, I
    don't think players should be rewarded simply for playing lots of games and
    getting lucky occasionally.
    
    There are even players out there (we've all run into them) who care so much
    about HOF that they sign up for every game in sight and then abandon the
    ones that don't go well.  Of course, an easy fix for that is to respond to
    an abandonment by deducting a few of those HOF points they care so much
    about.  That'd get their attention.

    My first judge game, I also resumed the game to send an
    end-of-game comment, and ever since then, extending now
    into my more-Mastering-than-playing days, I've been wondering
    what it would be like to leave a game resumed and play on.
    Could a solo victor (in a good position) perhaps achieve 34
    centers?  Would the judge declare the game over every single
    year requiring that it be re-resumed?  Things that make you go,

    I don't see what makes the phone a superior means of communication over
    email.  It seems to me to be a matter of taste and style.  I am happy that
    I experienced phone communication in this game, but I still prefer email.
    Perhaps I need to push myself some, but in this game I preferred to get off
    the phone with as little transpiring as possible and move the discussion to
    the written word.
    
    Did we demonstrate that phone is better than email?  I don't think so.  I
    think we demonstrated that they are very different and the medium does
    matter in Diplomacy.

    I don't know what you mean by a 'subjective scoring system'.  If you
    are saying something like having judges, a la diving or figure
    skating, well, that seems like a pain.
    
    I think, though, you have to allow a scoring system to let one player
    play 'much better' than another and get the same score.  This seems
    inevitable.  You can only hope for the scoring system to do well on
    average.

    This talk of draws is all very interesting.  There's a few obvious points
    that seem to be getting lost.
    
    1) It is very possible through no fault of your own to come under attack
    from your neighbors right from the word 'go'.  If this happens, you might
    play far more skillfully than anyone else just to survive and take part as
    the small power in a draw.  How are you going to measure that against the
    guy who just hangs around playing comfortable defense the whole game and
    getting the exact same result?  The only way to do it is to have a
    subjective scoring system.  And who wants that?
    
    2) If you take the large-power small-power argument to its logical extreme,
    it would seem that you should argue that points should be awarded to the
    losers in a solo.  After all, in an 18-15-1, didn't the guy with 15 centers
    play much better than the guy with 1?  Shouldn't the points awarded reflect
    that?  Sure it sounds silly.  But the argument that some draws are more
    equal than others sounds just as silly to me.  The small guy has to be
    skillful enough to make himself unkillable.  That's not so easy.  If you
    really want to prove yourself more skillful, find a way to squeeze him out.
    Otherwise, accept him as an equal partner in the draw.  To me, it is like a
    forced draw in chess.  You may have outplayed your opponent and you may have
    more material, but if you can't achieve the goal of capturing his king, it
    doesn't matter.  Equal draw.
    
    As for Rick's observation that it is very easy to go to five-six centers and
    simply not offend anyone, I'd say maybe that is easy for him.  Maybe it
    suits his style or maybe he is just good.  A lot of players find that sort
    of balancing act very difficult.
    
    3) There is no third point!
    
    4) I think if you want a better scoring system, you need to take into
    account strength of opposition.  I've been a chess player much longer than
    I've played Dip.  At first, I was very surprised that strength of opposition
    wasn't taken into account.  I was also surprised that you could achieve a
    high rating simply by playing in lots of games (remember the real-time v.
    "normal" debate?).  Now I know the HOF system is set up the way it is to try
    to ease the burdon of keeping it current. That's understandable, but to me
    it means that it is not going to give more than a general "feel" for who the
    top players are.  But a more productive debate my center on revamping the
    HOF system to take into account strength of opposition or, at least, number
    of games played.
    
    5) A brief ad.  It seems we have a few chess players here.  I play PBEM
    chess with friends and would love some fresh blood.  I play at a mid-to-high
    expert level.  Or a low master on my best days.  I'll play a single game,
    black or white, or two at once.  PBEM is perfect for the busy player.  It is
    much quicker than PBM, but there is no pressure to make moves right away.
    If you get busy, the game is still there next week.  Any takers?

    :-)
    
    Ok.
    Well, anyway, I guess I'd say that a win was "lucky" when:
    
    	pr(I win | I played that particular strategy) < 1
    
    The further that probability is from 1, the more 'humble' I ought to be
    about my win. If it were .00007, then I ought to be really humble, so much
    so that I should think pretty badly of myself. :-)
    
    My sense is that it is always rather a lot smaller than 1 (to give a silly
    amount of precision, let's say it is rarely higher than about 1/3), so that
    the degree of appropriate humility is always rather high.
    
    But on the bright side, at least *often*
    
    	pr(I lose | I played that particular strategy)
    
    is often considerably less than 1, also, even when as a matter of fact I
    lost. This is always some consolation. :-)

    Well, I'm not quite that doctrinaire, but I think that you have to

    Then I do take issue with you, because I couldn't even follow for sure
    that you understood the Bayesian point of view in this case, let alone
    that you were a "true believer" about it.  Don't take my attempts to

    Okay, forget the editing, since I see that Jamie has provided a nice
    place where my unedited, rambling thoughts can tail in.  Just imagine,
    if you will, what you're about to read having been written much better
    and actually given a point that it drives towards and makes.  Now try
    to keep that image in your mind as you wade through this:

    Well, I'll jump in here, but I won't stay in.  I like this analogy for as
    far as it goes, but I guess I would say that it applies best to NO-PRESS
    games.  In Rock, Paper, Scissors, players don't usually promise what they
    will do on each turn.  In Diplomacy, however, there is that element of
    promise and trust (and trust broken), and this, to my mind, nearly eliminates
    luck.
    
    Let's say that you have a four-player game of rock, paper, scissors.
    And let's say you "lose" a point each time your choice is "beaten" by
    another player's choice (scissors beat paper, etc., etc.).  A set of
    Calhamerian players will always arrange for the game to be a tie.  Whichever
    of the players who is currently leading will be "ganged-up on" by the other
    three, who would arrange before each turn (through negotiation) to each select
    the same choice, thus ensuring that the leader will lose three points while
    the trio stands to lose only one each per turn.
    
    This doesn't ensure that the leader won't win, of course, because there yet
    exists some luck.  The trio could be consistently wrong, and each take a
    point "hit" on every turn until the end of the game.
    
    Now say that the game is not arbitrarily long, but that when each player
    loses, say, eighteen points, he is ELIMINATED.  All of a sudden, the
    negotiated "catch-the-leader" trio is less stable.  With each player knowing
    the (promised) choice of the others, the players are tempted to "stab" and
    cause an elimination.
    
    Now add three more players and make it so that each player's hand gesture can
    only affect a SUBSET of the other players.  Now we're getting closer to
    Diplomacy.
    
    So what the heck is my point?  Geez, I don't know.  All it seems like
    I've done is taken Jamie's simple comparison and elaborated on it
    unnecessarily.  The point I was trying to make was that it is my belief
    that luck is reduced significantly because the game turns now to
    psychology rather than to chance.  Maybe some people, when stabbed or
    eliminated, feel unlucky, but I, at least, feel like I missed a psychological
    clue; that the turn of events against me was my fault.
    
    Much is involved with player personalities.  If every power on the board
    starts the game thinking that their power stands no chance if England
    survives 1903, and if none are convinceable otherwise despite the best
    diplomacy anyone could come up with, then, yes, it is bad luck that you
    drew England (or good luck that you didn't).  But if none (or at least
    a smaller number) of the players are dumb enough to be intractable in
    their openings, then it kind of like rock, paper, scissors with eliminations
    and with the "let's talk about what we'll do first, and watch it, because
    I'll be looking into your eyes the whole time!"  If you lose, you should
    blame your ability to see into the other players' eyes.  You shouldn't
    blame dumb luck.

    Jim,
    
    I take an *entirely* Bayesian approach, as a matter of fact. I'm a True
    Believer, a follower of Bayes. Insofar as I ever say anything unBayesian,
    you must always interpret me as trying to make myself understood to
    Heretics. :-)
    
    >I think both Hohn and Jamie confuse the issue with
    >the words they choose (luck is too imprecise, for example).
    
    Oh, come on. It is silly to insist on incredibly precise terms in this
    context. I doubt we'd have much trouble finding a really precise substitute
    for 'luck' if we had to. But we know well enough what we mean to serve.
    Anyway, I just haven't thought through everything carefully enough to
    satisfy a math journal's standards! (Or the standards of _Theory and
    Decision_, to take an example more relevant to both myself and this
    context.)
    
    >If we play one game and Hohn wins, the raw probabilities (unadjusted
    >for anything else that is secondary to this discussion) are Hohn=1.0,
    >everyone else=0.0.
    
    What???
    That is the most unBayesian thing one could say about the case.
    
    If you mean, the probability that Hohn won the game *given the information
    that Hohn won*, is 1.0, then that is certainly true but of no particular
    interest! The interesting question is rather, what is the probability of
    (Hohn wins) given the information that Hohn adopted these certain
    strategies. Obviously that is the question! And that posterior is not going
    to be 1.0, that's for sure.

    I can certainly agree with all of this.
    
    Look, my point then, is this. If we want to award points proportional to
    'goodness of play', and we think that 'goodness of play' is nothing other
    than 'probability given this strategy of winning' (I'm afraid I am just
    avoiding the issue of awards for draws relative to awards for wins), then
    there is an *a priori* guarantee that the expectation of reward will be
    exactly what it should be if we simply award points for wins and nothing at
    all for 'near wins', or center counts, or anything else like that. So if a
    player chooses a strategy to maximize expectation of reward, then he will
    be choosing the strategy with the highest 'goodness of play', if rewards
    are meted out by my suggestion.
    
    And the work of de Finetti shows that the long run must vindicate my
    estimator, independent of what priors we assign. That is the ultimate test
    for a Bayesian.
    
    "Credo in unum deum, Bayes, et discipulo, San Bruno."

    I suspect that in order to make a better case than I have, I will have to
    think more carefully about how exactly to present my view very
    systematically and more formally. I don't think it's wise for me to try to
    do that in this forum. So I intend to let this discussion wind down now,
    and quite possibly attempt to write something more complete another day for
    inclusion in a future Diplomatic Pouch.
    
    But I'll respond at length this one last time (no, no, don't thank me!).

    Well, there are two different features that might be at issue here. One of
    them I think really isn't a disanalogy at all, but the other is.
    
    First, of course there is such a thing as doing very well in the opening of
    a chess game, but then being outplayed in the midgame. It certainly seems
    to me that this is in some sense a greater achievement than being
    slaughtered in the opening and having a hopeless position at move 14. So
    there is no disanalogy there.
    
    On the other hand, there is this fact (which, it suddenly occurs to me,
    once came up in an r.g.d. discussion  included me, Rick, and Dan Shoham,
    and if I'm not mistaken Dan and I were on one 'side' and Rick was on the
    other). Since there are initially seven players in Diplomacy, there is a
    special kind of progress you can make: eliminating other players. This is
    special because there is an absolute 'ratcheting': once a player is
    eliminated there is no comeback. Increasing number of supply centers is not
    like that at all. And there is nothing like that in chess, either. For this
    reason, I agree that the number of powers eliminated at any stage of a
    Diplomacy game is a special measure, important in a way that no measure is
    ever important in chess. In chess there is no 'series of challenges' like
    that.
    
    But I don't see how this supports Rick's general position.

    Right.
    No, I agree about these examples.
    
    But now I see that this is a sort of disagreement about which my arguments
    so far have been essentially irrelevant. This is a disagreement about
    whether we ought to see a single game of Diplomacy as more like a single
    baseball game, or more like a tournament or season. And I am inclined
    toward the former, and Rick toward the latter. Off hand I am inclined to
    say that we should just admit that there are different ways to see it, and
    different rating systems all of which might be perfectly reasonable.

    Uh, no, wait. I thought I was quasi-quoting you. I can't quite remember the
    context. Oh, sure I can, you were talking about chess. I went on to say
    that in one sense I thought this was true of both Dip and chess, and in
    another sense it was true of neither.
    
    >  Are you really contending that Hohn did not play a better
    >game here than Pitt?  Or just that he did not play a better game than
    >you?
    
    Neither!
    I am making no judgment about how well the various parties in Ghodstoo
    performed. I could do that, but my judgment would not be derived from the
    outcome of the game, it would be derived from the internal features that I
    happen to know about, and I would know very well that my judgment was
    highly fallible, since I lacked important information.
    
    So, in sum, I say that you can't tell who played the better game from the
    outcome. (You can't tell that Pitt didn't play a better game than Hohn, you
    can't tell that Edi didn't, you can't tell that Mark didn't, or that Cal
    didn't.) However, as I hope I've made clear, Hohn's finish is *evidence*
    that he played a better game than any of the rest of us, I am happy to say
    that. It's just "defeasible evidence" (as I said in response to Hohn,
    "rebuttable evidence", which insofar as I understand legal jargon means the
    same thing).

    To say that 'position is more important than material' in chess is very
    much like saying that 'defense is more important than offense' in football.
    Strictly speaking, they are both contributors to the outcome, and which is
    'more important' is highly context-sensitive. Context free, they don't seem
    to mean anything at all.
    In any case, I certainly agree that in some crucial sense position is
    vastly more important than material in Diplomacy, and in fact I think it is
    much more true than in chess (which is kind of perverse of me, since I just
    said it doesn't mean anything outside of a context! but my context is: in
    the large majority of actual Diplomacy games).
    
    
    >I don't see how you can say participation in a four-way draw is worse

    >finishing with 17 SCs is better than finishing with 1 SC.
    
    Well, they seem to me largely independent of each other.
    
    I don't off hand know how to argue for the claim that a 3-way draw is a
    better result for participants than a 4-way draw. I guess I'd try to say
    something about the 'ratchet' effect mentioned above. But I know some
    people just don't see it that way--Edi said he doesn't.
    
    >I would certainly say that the player who finished with 17 SCs in a
    >4-way draw 'probably played a better game' than a person who finished
    >with 3 SCs in a 3-way draw.
    
    Oh, so would I. I mean, statistically speaking, I am fairly sure it's true.
    
    
    >Again the chess analogy fails.  You just do not get chess draws except
    >when two players are in essentially equal positions.  With a
    >multi-player game, you can have coalition-based draws.  The existence

    That is true, but why isn't a coaltion draw "essentially equal positions"?
    It won't generally be "essentially equal *material*", but that is also true
    in chess.
    
    
    Finally:

    Hmmm.
    Listen, if there were a theorem that showed that a certain
    sc-count-sensitive scoring system would be bound to approach the same
    result as my measure would at the limit, but that the sc-count-sensitive
    system would tend to approach the result faster, then I would be in favor
    of that system. I doubt that there is any such system, but I agree that in
    principle it would have a strong pragmatic advantage. (At least I agree to
    that right now, I might change my mind if I thought about it some more,
    which I will do. Think some more, that is, not change my mind.)

    >... I was not proposing that points be awarded to players based on what

    I would agree with this measure as being valid, but I think that with

    I realize this debate has been taken elsewhere (to some extent)
    but the message below sums up a great deal of this issue.
    
    I think one of the keys to thinking about the problem properly
    is to think like a Bayesian -- specifically in terms of how you
    treat small samples (VERY small samples in many cases) and regression
    to the mean.  I think both Hohn and Jamie confuse the issue with
    the words they choose (luck is too imprecise, for example).
    
    If we play one game and Hohn wins, the raw probabilities (unadjusted
    for anything else that is secondary to this discussion) are Hohn=1.0,
    everyone else=0.0.  I think everyone would agree that the "true mean"
    performance for everyone is not well served by that estimate.
    As performances are added to the database, "regression to the mean"
    would occur toward the "true" expected performance for each player.
    Bayesian posterior probabilities are ways of obtaining estimates
    of these true means.  Standard frequentist statistical approaches
    operate off of the "law of large numbers" when sample sizes become
    really large (in the sense of Diplomacy games), but even there,
    if sample sizes vary (as they will in reality) Bayesian methods
    are still desirable.  An ideal Diplomacy rating system will have
    Bayesian methods built into it.
    
    For a neat application of Bayesian thinking on the Internet, look
    at the "movie rating" voting system in the Internet Movie Database

    Now, given that discussion, read Hohn and Jamie's statements again.
    I think they are both making Bayesian arguments from different
    starting points.

       That is question-begging.
    
       You count increased sc index as 'making strides toward victory' and
       'playing well'. I am willing to count them that way *sometimes*, but I
       don't agree that it's a good *measure* of playing well.
    
    I believe it is a good measure of playing well.
    
       I gave my silly analogy because you seemed to be saying that the reason you
       changed your mind was precisely that you found yourself having an easier
       time participating in draws as a 3-center power (e.g.) than as a 16-center
       power. I was only pointing out that difficulty is no measure at all here.
    
    You took the concept of difficulty in an orthogonal direction.  I
    don't consider it a greater achievement for a person to overcome
    artificial, self-imposed constraints.  But there is a direction in
    which each player is expected to try to go.  To make progress in that
    direction is difficult.  To make more progress in that direction in
    that direction is more difficult.  Furthremore, it is relevant.

       Naturally, there are a heap of important disanalogies between chess and
       Diplomacy. As you certainly know, it's like that with each and every
       analogy ever constructed. So let's see whether the disanalogies you note
       are relevant.
    
       First, chess is a two-player game. Ok, I agree! But I don't see why that is
       relevant.
    
    I see that as very relevant.  View Diplomacy as a series of
    player-to-player challenges.   One may overcome a few obstacles and
    achieve a larger size, only to be stopped later.  I view that as a
    greater achievement than being immediately crushed.  (I would imagine
    most players would agree with this point.)  In chess there is no
    series of challenges, as each game has only one opponent.
    
    The (imperfect) analog would be a single-elimination chess tournament,
    where one needed to beat a series of players to win.  Surely the loser
    of the finals would (skewed seeding aside) be more respected that a
    player who lost in the first round?
    
    Or are the Cleveland Indians, who made it to extra innings in game 7
    of the World Series, no better than the Oakland A's, the worst team in
    the AL?
    
       Second, you think you can't meaningfully say that one player played better
       than another unless the player achieved victory.
    
    Sure I can.  Are you really contending that Hohn did not play a better
    game here than Pitt?  Or just that he did not play a better game than
    you?
    
    
       >The task for a Diplomacy player is significantly harder.  He must
       >achieve an advantage over all of the other players.  Partial progress
       >towards this goal is observable and can be rated.  And, IMO, would
       >represent superior play.
    
       I don't believe it.
       If by 'advantage over all the other players' you just mean having the
       largest number of centers, then I do not believe that is itself progress
       toward victory.
    
    By 'advantage over all of the other players' I mean achieving a
    majority of SCs.  That is why I phrase my points in terms of partial progress.
    
    	If it were, we would never have to worry about Early Leader
       Syndrome.
       To forestall misunderstanding: I do certainly think that there is a pretty
       high correlation between center count and likelihood of winning! But
       similarly there is a high correlation between the amount of material a
       player has on the board in chess (using the standard accounting system,
       with pawns one point, knights and bishops three, etc.), and progress toward
       victory. But I would very strongly object to a tournament scoring system
       that awarded more points to white in a draw if white had more material on
       the board at the end of the game.
    
    Again, the chess analogy fails.  As my chess-playing superiors tell
    me, position is more important than material in chess.  Which is also
    true in Diplomacy to some extent, but not in the same way.

       I think there is more than one way to count draws reasonably. I suggest we
       leave this issue aside for the present. But a quick comment for now, I
       can't resist.
       What would it mean to count all draws equally? Would it mean that a given
       player gets the same number of points for participating in a six-way draw
       as he gets for participating in a two-way?
    
    That's what it would mean.
    
    I don't see how you can say participation in a four-way draw is worse
    than participation in a three-way draw without letting me say that
    finishing with 17 SCs is better than finishing with 1 SC.
    
    I would certainly say that the player who finished with 17 SCs in a
    4-way draw 'probably played a better game' than a person who finished
    with 3 SCs in a 3-way draw.

       I do not.
       No more for Diplomacy than for chess.
    
    Again the chess analogy fails.  You just do not get chess draws except
    when two players are in essentially equal positions.  With a
    multi-player game, you can have coalition-based draws.  The existence
    of which changes everything.

    It seems to me that the debate centers on an impossible question, ie,
    measuring quality of play.  A victory is clear-cut and, in Diplomacy,
    almost invariably indicates superior play, because it is so hard to
    achieve.  Other than that one outcome, no clear criteria emerge.  In
    retrospect, we can say that a player who was eliminated played better than
    one who shared in the draw, or a small survivor played better than a large
    survivor.  Any judgment is possible.  The question is what you did with the
    hand you were dealt, and that's completely different in every game.  We can
    discuss, debate, and maybe even reach consensus on who played well and who
    played badly in a given game, but no measures exist that would take account
    of all the variables making up good play from one game to the next.  The
    current HOF scoring system is simple and does about as well as can be
    asked, given the inherent subectivity in making such judgments.
    
    
    A rating system is a statistic.  It can provide interesting
    information without pretending to have a full understanding of the
    'real value' of each power in each board position.  I don't really
    like the idea of subscribing to the 'we-can-know-nothing' philosophy.
    It seems to let analysis off the hook.
    
    Subjectivity is overrated.  Our inability to get an exact picture
    should not completely deter us from attempting to gain any
    information.

    I agree.
    
    My suggestion, which is really nothing other than the status quo, is to let
    the internal features of the game take care of all these subjective
    judgments for us. It seems to me that we ("we participants in email
    Diplomacy", I guess) have inadvertantly hit on the best possible solution
    to the difficulties.
    
    I do think the issue of relative rewards of draws and wins remains open and
    intelligently debatable, though I don't have anything to contribute at the
    moment.

    Right, we certainly do disagree about this.
    
    I think I have a Diplomatic Pouch article about this. Don't I? Manus? Shall

    Very, very briefly:
    Diplomacy is like a very complicated, much more interesting version of
    Scissor, Paper, Stone. There are no dice in Sc, Pap, Stone. But there is a
    whole lot of luck.

    Ahhh. But this is the beauty of the thing!
    
    Ok, first of all, I do think it is *in principle* possible to quantify
    chances of winning, but in practice it is hopeless (with a few exceptions
    in relatively simple endgames).
    
    Second, I was not proposing that points be awarded to players based on what
    chance of winning each had achieved. I was saying that whatever chance of
    winning player X achieves, player X's reward is precisely *to have that
    chance of winning*! So nobody has to make the judgment. The game does it
    for us! (I have to add that this had never occurred to me before we started
    arguing about it.)
    
    >Second, all of the above is fluid until the end of the game.  The 30%

    Hmm.  Wait, we are comparing the guy who got himself a 30% chance of
    winning, with the guy who got himself a 20% chance of winning. You say, the
    guy with the 30% chance will probably have more centers at the end of the
    game. I think that's likely to be true. So where do we disagree? As
    follows. Suppose the guy with the 30% chance doesn't actually do anything,
    and the guy with the 20% chance is much more active. And as a result, the
    latter finishes with more centers. You seem to be saying that he played
    better, and deserves more points. I say not. I mean, look, by playing more
    actively he gave himself a lower chance of winning! How could that possibly
    be smarter, better play? I can't understand that at all.
    
    Now back to the more common case, where the guy with the 30% chance ended
    up with more centers. Ok, I say: this guy had a better chance to win. If we
    award points only for wins, then his expectation was higher than the other
    guy's. I say this is sufficient reward. You want to give him extra points
    at the end for having more centers. I say, you are double-counting now. His
    expectation was already higher, and now you want to boost it even more.
    This will provide a bad measure in the long run.

    Oh, well, that is a very fundamental disagreement that we have, then. I
    believe that Eric Calhamer's comment that chance is eliminated from
    Diplomacy (except for the initial distribution of powers) is way, way off.
    Briefly: Diplomacy is a game of imperfect information, and all games of
    imperfect information have a significant chance element.

    Yes, I am willing to use it for that purpose. So, for example, I think that
    anyone looking at the public record of Ghodstoo would be reasonable in
    concluding that Turkey probably played a better game than England. I accept
    that point. I do not think this is a good reason to give Turkey a higher
    score, though.
    
    Chess analogy: It is reasonable to suppose that the player with more
    material on the board is playing better. (As with Dip., it is not
    universally true, but it is probative evidence. Rebuttable, but probative.)
    However, it would be a bad idea to award players tournament points on the
    basis of how much material they had on the board at the end of the game.

    Oh.
    Well, I think that method is a kind of double-counting. Just as it would be
    double-counting to award the chess player with more material some extra
    tournament points.

    No! It is definitely not more likely to rank true.
    I'll put this very simply, so simply that I risk sounding paradoxical, or
    trivial:
    
    The very best way of measuring likelihood of success, in the long run, is
    to count up relative frequency of successes in the long run.
    
    *ANYTHING* that dilutes this measure is going to be misleading, either by

    That is question-begging.
    
    You count increased sc index as 'making strides toward victory' and
    'playing well'. I am willing to count them that way *sometimes*, but I
    don't agree that it's a good *measure* of playing well.
    
    I gave my silly analogy because you seemed to be saying that the reason you
    changed your mind was precisely that you found yourself having an easier
    time participating in draws as a 3-center power (e.g.) than as a 16-center
    power. I was only pointing out that difficulty is no measure at all here.

    Naturally, there are a heap of important disanalogies between chess and
    Diplomacy. As you certainly know, it's like that with each and every
    analogy ever constructed. So let's see whether the disanalogies you note
    are relevant.
    
    First, chess is a two-player game. Ok, I agree! But I don't see why that is
    relevant.
    
    Second, you think you can't meaningfully say that one player played better
    than another unless the player achieved victory. I think that the situation
    is exactly the same in Diplomacy. In one sense, you can certainly say that
    one player played much better than the other even though he didn't win.
    Grandmasters say this sort of thing all the time in analyzing world
    championship play. In another sense, I would agree that in the end the
    overall play is *not* better unless it leads to a win (ignoring this
    quibble: that black begins with a disadvantage, to superior play by black
    will often lead to a draw).
    
    >The task for a Diplomacy player is significantly harder.  He must
    >achieve an advantage over all of the other players.  Partial progress
    >towards this goal is observable and can be rated.  And, IMO, would
    >represent superior play.
    
    I don't believe it.
    If by 'advantage over all the other players' you just mean having the
    largest number of centers, then I do not believe that is itself progress
    toward victory. If it were, we would never have to worry about Early Leader
    Syndrome.
    To forestall misunderstanding: I do certainly think that there is a pretty
    high correlation between center count and likelihood of winning! But
    similarly there is a high correlation between the amount of material a
    player has on the board in chess (using the standard accounting system,
    with pawns one point, knights and bishops three, etc.), and progress toward
    victory. But I would very strongly object to a tournament scoring system
    that awarded more points to white in a draw if white had more material on
    the board at the end of the game.
    
    >You are stubbornly sticking to the viewpoint that Diplomacy play
    >should be judged as a 0-1 phenomenon.  Or, perhaps, a 0-1-2
    >phenomenon, as you can win, lose, or draw.
    
    Yes, I am. More and more I think that is the reasonable approach.
    
    > (I suppose the logical
    >conclusion to this thinking is that all draws are equal, no matter the

    I think there is more than one way to count draws reasonably. I suggest we
    leave this issue aside for the present. But a quick comment for now, I
    can't resist.
    What would it mean to count all draws equally? Would it mean that a given
    player gets the same number of points for participating in a six-way draw
    as he gets for participating in a two-way? Or would it mean that the total
    number of points to be divided among the drawers is the same no matter what
    the size of the draw? As we all know, we use neither of these systems. I
    like the current system, but I have not thought carefully about the
    alternatives.

    I do not.
    No more for Diplomacy than for chess.
    Ah, except I do think it would be appropriate to use information about the
    players, thus:

    I certainly agree.
    >From time to time we have considered trying out a more FIDE-like scoring
    system for Diplomacy. It is very difficult to work out anything reasonable
    and practical.
    
    But I don't see what this has to do with rating on the basis of total
    number of centers controlled. It seems entirely orthogonal.

    It sure does.
    On the other hand, it has been obvious all year that Penn State *could*
    have run up the score against lesser opponents, the way Florida State likes
    to do, but that Joe Paterno just doesn't like to do that. So I'm afraid I
    don't see which way this digression cuts in the current debate.

    I cannot disagree with you more strongly here, Jamie.  As Edi said,
    every player has their "buttons."  The key is to find those buttons.
    Barring irrational prejudice (most of which can be eliminated by the
    gunboat provisions of PBEM), I believe that luck has very little to do
    with a good performance in a Dip game.  The game does its best to
    _eliminate_ random factors, and I think it has done an admirable job

    I disagree.  In any game with quantifiable parts (such as supply
    centers), there is more than one way to measure good play.  It's not
    just an all-or-nothing thing, IMO.  You can recognize who played a
    better game without just boiling it down to end results.

    First, I don't think it's possible to quantify possibilities as you
    do above.  It's all inherently speculative, variable, and thus is
    glaringly inappropriate for any scoring system based on anything
    resembling objective criteria.
    
    Second, all of the above is fluid until the end of the game.  The 30%
    guy, if he lays low without ever moving, hasn't really _done_
    anything, wiseness of laying low notwithstanding.  If the 30% guy
    eventually moves, and makes it to an almost-win before the game is
    called, then the 30% guy will probably have more centers when all is
    said and done.

    Too many games end up in draws for this system to be desirable, IMO.
    The level of differentiation suffers.  Moreover, see below.

    I dislike this analogy because it introduces elements of random chance
    into a game which in its elegance (and indeed, is one reason why I
    love the game) attempts to eliminate such things from the game.

    Jamie, in my opinion, you've just conceded a critical point.
    
    To use a legal example, relevant evidence is any evidence which is
    probative of a material issue, i.e. any evidence which tends to make
    something more likely or not.  Clearly, good play in any particular
    game is a material issue to any scoring system.  If a particular,
    piece of evidence (namely centers) is "probably" indicative of good
    play, that evidence should be admitted.  This is especially true when
    the evidence in question is objective and readily quantifiable, such
    as center count.

    Put it this way.  How would taking center count into consideration
    _fail_ to similarly establish viable trends regarding play and
    ability?  If as you admit above, center count _probably_ indicates
    that a player has played a better game, than extending that over large
    trends, you cannot help but get a more accurate picture and projection
    regarding play and ability.

    No, by your own admission, the addition of the center criteria is more
    likely to rank true.  The cases where a player reaches a large center
    count while playing poorly will be limited, and effectively "smoothed
    out" over the longer course of events.

    I stand by my original contention.  I haven't experienced the joint
    29, so I'll refrain from commenting on that until I try it or think
    about it a lot more.

    There is a substantial difference between my reasoning and yours.  I
    favor players who are playing well, making strides toward victory.
    You favor players who decide to, for no reason except their own ego,
    to arbitrarily impose constraints upon their play.
    
    Analogies with chess fail for many reasons.  Chess is a two-player
    game where you cannot really meaningfully say that one player played
    better than another unless the player achieves a victory.  In Master
    play, a significant advantage usually translates into a victory.
    
    The task for a Diplomacy player is significantly harder.  He must
    achieve an advantage over all of the other players.  Partial progress
    towards this goal is observable and can be rated.  And, IMO, would
    represent superior play.
    
    You are stubbornly sticking to the viewpoint that Diplomacy play
    should be judged as a 0-1 phenomenon.  Or, perhaps, a 0-1-2
    phenomenon, as you can win, lose, or draw.  (I suppose the logical
    conclusion to this thinking is that all draws are equal, no matter the
    number of players involved.)  I think that this is only the beginning
    of the information available to a rating system.  I think it would be
    appropriate for rating systems to use information from the course of
    play, such as SC count, and also information about the players in
    rating a game.
    
    In chess, my rating will improve slightly if I beat a similarly-rated
    player, while it will improve signficantly more if I beat a player
    with a much-higher ranking.  But with the HoF, a player can gain as
    many points by routing a board of novices as by winning an expert
    game.  (And at least one of the highest-rated players got most of his
    points that way, but I digress).  A rating system which took this
    greater set of information into account could provide a more accurate
    measure of player level, and would thus have better predictive value.
    
    To conclude, I digress somewhat by referring to the college football
    situation.  For much of the year, Penn State was at or near the top of
    the football polls.  But the NY Times computer ratings placed them at
    #11, 10 places lower than the writer's polls.  Penn State recently has
    been squeaking by lesser foes, and finally this Saturday they were
    clobbered by Michigan.  It seems they were overrated.

    >Now I'm of the completely opposite opinion.
    
    For the same reason, I now think that it is very impressive to draw in
    chess, as black, without ever castling. I have drawn many times as black
    when I castled, so I conclude this is too easy to be impressive. So I think
    black should be awarded 3/4 of a point, instead of 1/2, if he can draw
    without castling.
    
    Similarly, I think a player in Diplomacy should be given extra points for
    occupying every supply center whose name begins with a 'B' and no other
    center.

    Just do nothing!  I got a summary in my mailbox about 5 seconds after
    the game ended (as I do for about 10 games a day.).
    
    But how about that really old EP game you were still running????

    I hate to ask what on earth kind of system this would be.  Sounds
