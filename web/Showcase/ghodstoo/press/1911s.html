    Let's set up the line and end this thing.  I have no adventures planned, so
    I guess holding in Berlin is as good as anything.   My orders are in.
    
    I'll be out of town all of next week.  Shouldn't be a problem or even delay
    a turn, but I'll alert the Master.

    Hold, as far as I'm concerned. If John has some expedition in mind, he'll
    have to explain.

    Yeah. Maybe I'll mention that to Hohn. Nah, I'll wait.

    Nice try, Hohn, but, even if I am on my way out, there's no way I'd
    intentionally hand you (or anybody else) a solo.  You'll have to work that
    one on your own...

    John,
    
    I take it from your silence that you're not interested in trying to
    twiddle the board for a two-way.  If so, I figure you guys can axe
    Pitt while I finish off Cal this year, and then we can just call it a
    three-way.  Sound reasonable?

    I'm not trying to be difficult here, but you received the same message
    that I saw.  I don't really feel at liberty to reveal anything else
    regarding John's availability.
    
    > So I gather from a recent message.

    >
    Yes, I saw your messages.  John asked the turn to go through on
    deadline and then to request a delay if necessary only after that.
    
    > I guess I want a postponement until some reasonably short time after he
    > returns. I hate to ask, but I don't see what else I can do.
    >
    Hmmm, this one is difficult.  What you are asking me is as follows:
    
    1) Player X gets orders in and leaves town.
    
    2) Player Y wants more out of Player X and requests a delay until
    Player X returns.
    
    3) Player Z doesn't know it, but really doesn't want Player X and
    Player Y to agree on what Player Y wants.
    
    4) GM is asked to announce a delay and reasonably explain what
    it is for.

    No kidding.  I want to think about this for a few minutes.  But given

    Jamie,
    
    OK, you're right, but to be explicit, I would have to order the delay
    until October 7.  Is that a short delay?
    
    I am willing to be fairly circumspect about who requested it, but
    there are only so many people in the game.
    
    So, here it is: if you ask me for the delay, I will grant it.  The
    new deadline would be October 7.  I would not say who requested
    it or why.

    Yes, that's right. Except I'm not sure about (4). I am not requesting that
    you reasonably explain any delay, am I? (I did ask you whether John had
    requested one, but if that's not supposed to be public info, fine, no
    problem.)
    
    
    >No kidding.  I want to think about this for a few minutes.  But given
    >my dilemma, what precisely would you have me do?
    
    Announce that there will be a short postponement, but that you won't say
    who requested it. Isn't that your standard practice in any case? I don't
    see why you'd have to say any more than that.

    Has John left for the week???
    
    So I gather from a recent message.
    
    I am afraid I was expecting some reply from him which I haven't received.
    
    I guess I want a postponement until some reasonably short time after he
    returns. I hate to ask, but I don't see what else I can do.

    I will be out of town from tomorrow, Monday morning, until the following
    Monday night.  It's possible this won't require a delay, since my orders
    are in.  But if another deadline arises before Tuesday evening, I would
    need an extension.

<p><a name=16></a><b>Private message from <font color=0000cc>England</font> to <font color=00cccc>France</font>:</b><pre>
    John,
    
    I'm sorry, I could not submit orders without knowing what the deal is
    around Berlin. If you're ordering Pru-Ber and I don't give you support, it
    might be really bad; and if I do give the order and you don't attack, that
    would also be really bad. In either case, Pitt would likely try to throw
    the game, and would likely succeed. (You might support it in yourself from
    Kiel, and that might work, but I thought I'd better wait and be sure.)
    
    So I'm the one who asked for the postponement. I'll submit my orders as
    soon as I get the word from you.
    
    In case you somehow never got the message in which I explained my suggested
    plan, in brief it's this.
    
    I can keep Pitt from getting Stp forever, as long as I can get Swe-Fin this
    season (and if Pitt plans to bounce me (Stp-Fin) then Hohn will probably
    win no matter what we do). If you take Berlin, we can shore up the German
    part of the stalemate line. And you can secure the Riviera part by moving
    Mar-Gas, and Pie-Mar with support from Burg.
    
    If you want to keep Pitt in the draw, it's ok with me.
    
    Let me know,
    Gentle King Jamie

    By the way the following was received in regard to DipCon XXXI.  I will be
    making every effort to attend.  I would strongly urge all of you to attend
    also and to echo it to your friends.  The Diplomacy hobby appears to need a
    shot in the arm in the public arena.  In past the E-mail community has been
    a very minor show in the face to face side of things.  I know we need to
    change that to give the hobby a boost, so it is up to you guys.

    Hi Jamie,
    
    You know there is nothing I can say here except to say that you have
    given me no legitimate reason to delay the game any later than tonight.
    
    ANYTHING else that I say could give you private information that you

    Sorry I did not get back to you earlier.  I was out of town all week.  I
    think the most desirable outcome is a 3-way including you, me and England.

    I am back.  I don't recall receiving your message on how to shore up the
    stalemate line while taking Pitt out.  It's a good thing you asked for the
    delay.  Turkey has suggested we finish off Germany while he takes out
    Italy, then declare a 3-way.  I'm for it.  I will look over your suggested
    orders this afternoon and get back to you.

    Ok, good.
    
    Don't cut it too close, I don't check in really late at night. I will check
    at around 8pm EDT. If I don't have anything from you, I will try to check
    in again later than that.
    
    My moves are in. If I'm late, it could make Pitt really, really suspicious.
    I'd just ordered F Bal S A Pru H, but I'll change that now to F Bal S A
    Pru-Ber.
    
    I feel confident that you'll find my plan is in good order. Just don't
    forget to bring that A Pie back to Mar, with Mar-Gas. Otherwise you will
    (or might well) have a little hole in the Fall.
    
    This move should essentially end the game.

    Ok, I'll check again in an hour or so if I can manage it.
    
    Remember, I have ordered F Bal S A Pru-Ber.

    Hey, that's ON the record now, Burgess! Unexpungeable! Taunting one's
    players, what an irredeemable vice.

    May I presume that your "mood" has improved?   But, yes, I am a vice
    ridden GM animal....

    Comments on the likely outcome of the game from everyone's perspective
    would appear to be a good request to make at this point.
    
    What's next?

    Dearest Pitt,
    
    Let's just say that there's no need to waste your breath or fingers with
    any begging.

    It's been a pleasure, gentlemen.

    I thank you.

    I believe France deserves to be chastised.  Can we do so without giving
    Turkey a solo?  And, are you inclined to do so?  It's readily apparent that
    you can eliminate me if you chose.  I can only hope that you would rather
    keep me alive in order to a) say thanks for me not trying to throw the game
    to Turkey by letting him take STP, b) flip France the bird, and c) show to
    one and all what a generous and magnanimous person you really are.
    
    No, really!
    
    (That's as much as I'm willing to beg.  I hope it's sufficient...;-)
