    Sorry, I'm late folks.  I've been away for the weekend but I thought the
    deadline wasn't until 2330 tonight.  I'm sending in my build now.  I
    apologize to those of you who tried to contact me that I wasn't able to
    discuss this with you before sending in orders but I don't think that it
    makes much difference.  My build is pretty obvious.

    Pitt,
    
    The build of A BER as well as the moves you performed last season
    obviously trouble me.
    
    I'm moving to defend myself this turn.  I hope you will not initiate
    war, but I am not holding my breath.
    
    Your moves of course force me to continue to support Edi.  Which is in
    some ways a pity, since I think the two of us could work well together
    should we both decide to move against our principal allies.
    
    But it's up to you.
    
    Anyway,
    Hohn

    Take care, Mark.  Maybe you can live on for a little while, although I
    certainly don't have much to say in that matter any more.

    John,
    
    Well, although we've had little to discuss directly earlier, I think
    we're certainly reaching a point where we might want to consider
    cooperation, or at least the prospects of such.
    
    What would it take for you to stab Germany?  No reasonable proposals
    rejected, etc. etc.
    
    Let me know.
    
    Thanks,

    I'd rather not, simply because it _is_ a spring turn.  I'd be happy to
    take it as a disband in any fall turn.  Or perhaps in a spring turn
    next year or the year after, after we've established a working
    baseline of trust.

    Heh.
    
    Like I said, I think you've played a better game than John so far, and
    I think this upcoming interchange will bear that out even more.
    
    Pitt concerns me much more than John right now.

    Well, luck certainly always helps, but I'm thinking that most luck can
    be eliminated by use of sound tactics and psychology.

    That's fine with me.  It is a demo game, after all.

    What do you think of the tactical situation so far?  As I promised, I
    did build A CON, btw.

    I think he has to be worried a bit.  He's too good a player not to
    realize that he's in a precarious position.  But I'm doing my best to
    allay his fears.

    I finally found that minute I was looking for.  I've started summer
    teaching, and it seems I'm always in class or preparing for the next one.
    
    I think we've fairly well arranged everything for the next round.  If
    you've heard any interesting stories, clue me in.  I hear a few lies from
    the others every now and again, but nothing of much interest.   Edi's
    stopped calling for some reason.  I can't figure it out.

    Yes (barely it seems).
    
    I have a major new account starting tomorrow morning and I've been putting
    in 14+ hour days all week, including today.  No time for anything else so
    far.  However, I will have a few moments tomorrow afternoon to sit down and

    Pitt, are you still there?  If you recall, I had asked you about A Tyrolia.
     Seems to me that unit occupies a rather strategic place on the map.  At
    least let me know if you have no need for its services.

    Bummer.  And here I always figured the only reason to go into teaching
    and put up with screaming kidlets was the mega-length summer vacation...
    :)

    I'vce been getting mail from Turkey and I'm starting to think he MAY be
    serious  about attacking Austria.  It would certainly be in his best
    interest (in the world according to me anyway) to do so.  All he can
    accomplish by sticking with Austria would be a short term stalemate
    line.
    
    I still think we should go ahead with our plan for nowuntil we see what
    Turkey is REALLY up to.  Finally, we have the advantage of being able to
    take as "wait and see" attitude.  Meanwhile, I'll still support your
    fleet into the Ionian.
    
    Since we are discussing the future, do you have any timetable in mind
    for attacking Germany?  (I'm assuming of course, that you intend to do
    so, but the assumption is based upon your statement that you and I
    should stick together).
    One of the reasons I'm asking is that I would like to see Russia stick
    around for a while.  While England, Germany, Austria and Turkey are
    pissed off at him, he's done nothing but help me.  If possible, I'd like
    to see him be second eliminated (after England).  For that, he needs a
    centre to replace Norway.  I'm not altruistic enough to offer him Vienna
    (grin), but I was wondering if Munich was a possibility?  Obviously he
    would need your help for this but, if you want to atack Germany any time
    soon, an extra unit BEHIND his lines would be invaluable.
    
    All that is just a though and if you're not interested, I'm not going to
    push it.  Just let me know what you think of the idea.

    Bet if you were at seven centres though, you'd have more mail.  My
    combined (sent/received)  total of letters is 480.  That's roughly TEN
    times what I ever received in a postal game and enough to shock this old
    gamer...

    I've looked at the board now and the only way I can see to get you a
    centre would be for you to combine with France and try for Munich.  In
    all honesty, I don't think I have enough pull with him to do this.
    MAYBE I could talk him into that sort of attack, but I'm pretty sure
    he'd want Munich himself.  I'll sound him out.  I'm sure glad Jim
    extended the deadline as I've been very busy this week.  Meanwhile,
    write France yourself and see what he says.  If he turns us down, then,
    well, Galicia IS lovely this time of year... heh heh

    Well, Cal, just to interject, when I was teaching full time, I
    noticed that it tended to be those with the kids at home that
    tended to teach the summer courses.  I, being childless, never did.
    Even now, teaching part time, I'm avoiding summer courses.
    
    As for explanations?  Take your pick over these two or start your
    own:
    
    1) Kids require extra money for college savings plans etc. and making
    extra money in the summer is necessary to achieve those goals.
    
    2) [currently very hot] Kids running around the house becomes a reason
    to "get the hell out" to the safety of work.
    
    GM interjecting.... nothing to do with the game directly.

    This creates a small problem for me of credibility.  My discussions with
    France the last few moves have always been predicated on first giving up
    the Ionian and then taking it back.  I would have a real hard time
    explaining any reluctance on my part to hit Ion this turn.
    
    To get around this, may I suggest the following:
    
    F Ion-Alb;
    F Aeg-Gre;
    F Eas-Aeg.
    
    This will give you Eas to retreat to when Ion gets dislodged.  It also
    has the secondary advantage of being a defensive move just in case you
    don't trust me...heh heh.  You might want to combine these moves with:
    
    A Con-Rum,
    C By F Bla;
    F Mos-Ukr.

    I've written to France and asked him how he feels about helping me help
    Russia to survive by supporting him into Munich.  I've said I don't want
    Russia to be the first eliminated as he has been a valuable ally to me
    (s'true even if everybody else hates him...grin).  My REAL goal is to
    sound out John's willingness to attack Germany.  I'm still worried about
    a solid F/G.

    Well, human variables mean that you can't get rid of all luck, but
    you're right, you CAN minimize it.

    My thoughts are above and I think they offer good odds at taking Edi
    down completely.  My armies will basically be trying to solidify Trieste
    and
    Vienna.

    Well, since both Mark and John have pointed out to me the precariousness
    of Austria's position, I'd say Edi is VERY aware of the danger he's in
    (especially after your build - I'd love to know how you explained THAT
    one...grin).  Do you think he'll make defensive moves against YOU?  Or
    will he decide to take his chances?  I suspect the former...

    Well, I took it out for an overnighter and I'll be buying it if the

    for easier carrying.   I'm hoping to make a solo two-week tour through
    Algonquin Provincial Park next September.  Gonna do some

    I can only hope.
    
    I'm going to be honest with you, Pitt.  According to what I understand
    of what was supposed to happen with Edi, you didn't come through last
    season, and as a result he lost Vienna.  Also, your build of an army
    in Berlin instead of some unit in Kiel is by definition more
    aggressive against me.  Geography speaks louder than proclaimed
    intent, in many cases.
    
    But let's put that aside for right now.  I'm in no position to
    threaten you, certainly.  The converse certainly cannot be said with
    any credibility.  If you chose to do so, you could launch a pretty
    major attack against me right now, and we both know it.

    OK.  Assuming that you don't move on me, I foresee the following.
    
    I was sincere when I said that this game should probably end in a
    three-way draw.  The player quality is too good to let any other
    result happen easily.  Ensconced in my corner as I am, I feel my
    chances are reasonably decent to finish as one of those three.
    Situated as you are, I think your chances are pretty darn good too,
    perhaps even better than mine.
    
    I'd like to up both of our chances.
    
    England and Russia are out.  Edi is down to four, and if I choose to
    move against him, I suspect that between Cal and I, he will fold
    rather quickly.
    
    That leaves Italy and France.
    
    I'd prefer to see Italy be the third party, for simple reasons of
    geopolitics.  I think GIT makes a better and easier natural division
    of Europe than FGT.  Considering Italy's approaches to you can be
    sealed off rather easily, that means we just have to see France go
    down and then we're as good as gold.  Between you and Italy, I think
    you can take France down pretty well.
    
    Again, I'm not well situated to attack you, Pitt.  That should give
    you some good measure of solace that you will be free to attack
    France.
    
    I'm not going to stab Edi this season, simply because I can't afford
    to antagonize him while your units are potentially poised for a strike
    east.  But I am more than willing to do so.  And I think you can see
    my sincerity, especially as it is in my best interest and as Edi is
    very vulnerable.
    
    Please let me know your thoughts.  No reasonable counter-proposal will
    be refused.
    
    Thanks,
    Hohn

    Russia's remaining army and the likelihood that Edi would attempt it use it
    aainst me.  It was in no way anti-Turkish!  It's going south, not east.

    Jim,
    
    Thoughts on the last part of the game.
    
    Well, Edi guessed wrong (I was feeling a bit uneasy about his plan,
    and I was right).  And Pitt showed his true colors.
    
    I'm a bit surprised Pitt tried such transparent BS on Edi.  I mean,
    this is supposed to be an expert game, and Edi is certainly no chump.
    I'd be insulted.  It's quite obvious Pitt is going to stick with the
    FG for now.  I'm a bit surprised; I think stabbing F while I got my
    house in order was probably his best chance for a solo.  Maybe he's
    content with a draw.
    
    In any event, I have now come to the monumental (for me) conclusion
    that I must cut Edi loose.  Cal has been mostly reasonable this game,
    and I think I can work with him.  What's more, I need to make sure I
    shore up my land position so that I can withstand a German attack.  I
    can't do that with Edi in my way, because another player remaining in
    the game might throw off the endgame equation.  I want to make sure
    I'm a part of a draw, and that is in doubt if Edi stays in the game.
    There's a reason he's had such success in the past, and that's because
    he's slippery.  Which makes him even more dangerous when he becomes
    desperate.
    
    I don't think hitting Edi will be that disadvantageous to me.  Italy
    knows he will have to turn on France, or else France will be all over
    him.  And I feel confident that even if Italy continued into me, I
    could hold him off.  Being in the corner like I am is a large benefit.
    Unless John is a totally wimpy carebear, I don't think he would
    blithely sit tight while GI dissect me so the three of them could
    share a three-way.
    
    I think the more likely event will be that John and I will axe Italy
    after Austria is dead, or that John will turn on Pitt, and then things
    will really get interesting.
    
    An FG war is what I am going to push for, because that's the only way
    I can possibly see myself taking a solo.
    
    Other than that, I'm going to continue trying to lull Edi, and I've
    also sent a lukewarm, half-hearted attempt to Pitt to try to get him
    to pull off.  I doubt it will work because of his posture and his
    press so far, but what the heck.
    
    My real hopes now rest on Cal and John.  And I haven't even talked to
    John yet!  We'll see.  This is indeed the point where better and more
    frequent diplomacy earlier on with all of my fellow players, rather
    than just my immediate neighbors, would have served me better.

    I hope I don't go over the top with my comment.  I just found it
    amusing.
    
    I did hope that the deadline extension helps everyone get things
    sorted out to their satisfaction (or at least partly).  This is

    I've been giving thought to the German situation.  Until we defeat AT, I
    don't think the time is ripe to take on a big power like Germany.  If
    Turkey is indeed ready to hit Austria, maybe he'll swing some armies into
    the fray.  About the time ERA go out, the three of us can carve up the
    Kaiser.  Meanwhile, best to hold the line, don't you think?

    I think I've been the target of some rather clumsy diplomacy.  A bit too
    coincidental that T and I both start talking up an attack on Germany at the
    same time.  Italy will move on me, with Turkey's fleets in support.  It
    will be hard to hold them back.

    I am sorry to report that I must abandon our plan.  I believe you will see
    that I was forced to this.  I hope that I can help you to survive
    nonetheless.  I will explore a few avenues and, if you are willing, suggest
    later an order you might execute.

    that it would have ended in disaster.

    >of what was supposed to happen with Edi, you didn't come through last
    >season, and as a result he lost Vienna.
    
    Not true.  Not true, at all.
    
    After the turn processed, Edi claimed that he called and left a message on
    my answering machine asking me to tap TYR.  That may or may not be but I
    never received such a message Admittedly, I had a power failure and all my
    messages were erased but Edi could easily have sent me the same request via
    email, which he did *not* do.  Thus, I did not fail to do something I said
    I would do, only something Edi hoped I would do but never actually asked me
    and never received confirmation.
    
    It may sound like a fine distinction but it's an important one.  I have
    never failed to follow through on a firm commitment that I've made to Edi.
    I have, on occasion, waffled and declined to make a commitment or
    deliberatly tried to leave things murky but, once I said i would do
    something, I did it.  Period.
    
    So if Edi has told you otherwise, he's deliberately misleading you.
    
    
    >Also, your build of an army
    >in Berlin instead of some unit in Kiel is by definition more
    >aggressive against me.  Geography speaks louder than proclaimed
    >intent, in many cases.
    
    I have a hard time seeing this but I suppose that anything in KIE is less
    "threatening" to you than anything in BER.  What exactly, though, do you
    think I am going to with that army?  Even were I inclined to head east, I
    have your army in MOS, Russia's army in BOH and Edi's army in GAL to deal
    with.  What do I have to support my army BER in a headloing flight east?  A
    fleet in STP/sc.  Really, where am I going to go?
    
    It seems to me that it should be obvious that A BER was protection against
    Russian A BOH.  And, yes, I could have done the same with A KIE but why
    should I needlessly antagonize France at this point? (which is what A KIE
    most surely have done).  France's position in the north and west is
    superior to mine and the last thing I want is to engage him whiel that is
    still the case.  A BER was my only reasonable build.
    
    >But let's put that aside for right now.  I'm in no position to
    >threaten you, certainly.
    
    No?  By yourself, I would agree that you're not an immediate threat.  If
    you work with Austria against me as opposed to with me, I'm in big trouble.
    
    >The converse certainly cannot be said with
    >any credibility.  If you chose to do so, you could launch a pretty
    >major attack against me right now, and we both know it.
    
    No, I don't!  How?  Where?  I just don't see it.  What am I going to attack
    you with?  A BER and F STP?  Or, horror of horrors, let's suppose that I
    tried to get A DEN into the act.  It takes me a whole year to get it into
    play and you couldmeasily hold off my measly two army attack on MOS.  And,
    all the time that I was doing that, I'm exposing my rear to France.  Ain't
    gonna happen.
    
    >I was sincere when I said that this game should probably end in a
    >three-way draw.  The player quality is too good to let any other
    >result happen easily.
    
    Yes, I agree.  My only goal is to be part of that 3-way.
    
    >Ensconced in my corner as I am, I feel my
    >chances are reasonably decent to finish as one of those three.
    
    Agreed.  It was touch and go for you at first but you recovered nicely and
    there's no way that you're going out now.
    
    >Situated as you are, I think your chances are pretty darn good too,
    >perhaps even better than mine.
    
    Come on!  I am in the worst position of the 3 remaining large powers (FGT).
     I'm stuck in between you both, I've got an irritated Austrian to my south
    and the remnants of two pwers (England and Russia) who would like nothing
    better than to hurt me on their way out.  I feel *very* vulnerable and not
    at all assured of making the draw.
    
    >England and Russia are out.  Edi is down to four, and if I choose to
    >move against him, I suspect that between Cal and I, he will fold
    >rather quickly.
    
    Well, I'd prefer that if you move against him it be you and I, not you and
    Cal.
    
    >I'd prefer to see Italy be the third party, for simple reasons of

    >you can take France down pretty well.
    
    I don't see this at all.  Or, rather, what I see is a rather unsubtle
    attempt on your part to try to get me to engage the other large power by
    myself while you use your Italian puppet to finish off Austria, and then,
    after France and I are locked in each other's deadly embrace, leave you in
    position to sweep in and try for the solo.
    
    I'm pretty dumb, Hohn, but I hope I'm not that dumb.
    
    Any reasonable third party looking at the board right now would say that
    the game should end in an FGT 3-way.  You and I take out Austria, you and
    France take out Italy.  Should the three of us agree to that, it's over in
    two years on the outside.
    
    You, of course, will have to do what you see fit.  All I can tell you is
    that, while nothing is engraved in stone, I don't see me attacking France
    unless something changes drastically.  And, so long as he doesn't attack
    me, it wll be the two of us who determine who the third part is in the
    3-way.  I very much want it to be you as that is the most logical and
    efficient option.  I hope you see it that way, too.

<p><a name=29></a><b>Private message from <font color=808080>Germany</font> to <font color=00cccc>France</font>:</b><pre>
    John,
    
    Well, at last I have some free time to write to you.  I apologize once
    again for the long delay.
    
    It seems to me that we are fast approaching the end game.  I have always
    assumed that the best possible conclusion of a game of this caliber was a
    3-way draw.  It wasn't always apparanet to me who would be in that draw but
    now it's getting clearer.  You and I are in a position of some influence.
    So long as we continue to work together and do not break faith in each
    other, we are guaranteed to share in the draw.  None of the other players
    can mount a successful attack against a united FG at this point in the game.
    
    I cannot emphasize this enough.  If you are experiencing any portion of the
    attention I am getting, then you are being inundated under the barrage of
    messages from all the other players (most notably Austria) trying to get
    you to attack me (or me to attack you).  This is simply because they all
    now realize just how strong the two of us are together and they're
    desperate to drive us apart.  We must not let this happen.
    
    Having said that, I think we now need to decide which if the other powers
    we would like to share in the 3-way.  I think we're both agreed that it
    should not be Austria.  That leaves Italy and Turkey.  I suggest that it be
    Turkey.  Italy has been a good friend to you, so I know it might be
    difficult for you to stab him now.  However, if we try to mak ehim the
    third pasrty in the 3-way, we will have to find some way to eliminate
    Turkey.  Given his string position in the corner and the fact that we'd
    have to go through *both* Austria and Italy to get to him, I'm not sure we
    could do that.  Thus, if we decided to stick with Italy, we might be forced
    to end up with a 4-way draw.
    
    Now, I'm no big fan of Turkey (and, in fact, he's one of the players trying
    to get me to attack you) but, realistically, I think he's got too good a
    position for us to do him any serious harm.
    
    So, let me know what you think and, once we work out the larger issues, we
    can start on eth details of how we implement them this year.

    He's right.  I did want to try to set up the GIT because I think

    I am sorry to report that our plan has run into a major snag.  I thought it
    would have made for a fun mid-game.  I would appreciate your moving to Nwg
    instead of to Hel.   I will not take London, and I intend not to hit it
    ever.  I think your fleet can play a very important role in the coming
    years, and I would not be surprised to see you move back up in the world.

    We'll see.  I obviously can't say anything specific, but my evaluation
    at your skills in doing Diplomacy within this environment has been
    growing turn by turn.  Still, clumsy is as clumsy does.  The proof

    Austria's beset by Italians and rogue Russians right now.  He's in no
    position to move against you, and I doubt Cal will pull off now, not
    after finally managing to take two Austrian home centers and the third
    in reasonable sight.

    Is that going to screw me immediately?  No, of course not.  But it's a
    start.  And in light of my earlier (perhaps erroneous) understanding
    of your relationship with Edi and the potential strength of the
    alliance you have with France, I was concerned.
    
    Certainly such an attack would leave you somewhat open to a stab by
    France, but nevertheless it was a concern of mine.  You're doing well
    in allaying that concern, though, and I thank you for it.
    
    (At least, I'm hoping I'll thank you for it.) ;)

    I'm in no position to move against you, nor do I have the desire.
    Imagine how overextended that would make me.
    
    As for France, since I am relatively ignorant of your relationship
    with him, I'll leave that specific issue (how endangered you are by
    the chances of a French stab) alone, unless you want to further
    discuss it.

    ???
    
    Italian puppet?
    
    Man, how differently people see things.  Cal is hardly my puppet.  In
    fact, he's generally quite put out with me.
    
    Pitt, I'm not going to solo.  There's no chance in hell I'll be able
    to fool the board and pull a fast one in that sense, and I doubt many
    (I'd say "any," but then that would be belied by Mark's rather
    perplexing decisions in some of this game) of you will feel charitable
    enough to just give the game to anyone else.
    
    No, I'm sincere when I say that I think GIT is the natural division.
    I suppose it will depend on how alliance structures shake down.  But
    geographically, it seemed sensible.

    As I said, no reasonable counter-proposal will be refused.  If
    assurances can be made to provide for my security against the "mighty
    FG alliance," I have no objection to FGT.
    
    But in such a case, how will we deal with Italy?

    I'm all for logic and efficiency.  My concern is based partly on the
    above paragraph, though.  If you and France are so solid, my fears of
    attack by you increase.
    
    Perhaps we will both be benefited by talking specifics.  What do you
    think we should do this upcoming turn, and then in fall?  You
    mentioned wanting to dice up Edi with me, and in so doing cut Cal out
    of it.  How do you propose to do that?
    
    I look forward to your reply.

    None of the above would surpise me.  As I see it, we have three tasks.  In

    1.  work together *very* closely for our mutual safety and protection

    Pitt, our messages crossed.  Turkey has indeed contacted me, first time in
    this game, begging me to attack Germany.  I've done no more than ask why he
    would want that, given your recent cooperation.
    
    My inference is that he's allied with Italy.  I have to move fleets south
    fast and put the armies in defensive position.  I am also asking England to
    move around to help out.  I've offered to leave London alone in exchange.
    I hope he'll go for it.  In the long run, I would expect your fleets will
    join the fray too.
    
    If I'm wrong, well, what the heck, we might have good position on Italy.
    But I don't think I am wrong.

    Maybe.  From what Turkey has said to me, though, I think his long term goal
    isnmto ally with Italy to take out Austria, try to get you and I to tangle,
    and then sweep in to grab a solo from the melee.  If we continue to show
    solidarity, one of them will have to break.  I think it will Turkey if
    *really* comes to believe that he can't split FG.
    
    >I am also asking England to

    Man, there is so much disinformation being slung right now that I'm
    not sure _what_ to believe.  Sorry if I've confused you.  I'm quite
    confused myself.
    
    Perhaps I can place a different spin on the question.  How solid are
    you with Germany right now?  Do you have any desire of stabbing at
    all, or fears of being stabbed?  And perhaps most importantly, how do
    those things relate to your long-term vision of how you see this game
    ending?
    
    I'll go first.  I think this game should end in a three-way.  I'll go
    a step further in saying that I think practically _all_ games with
    seven expert players should end in three-ways.  My goal is to become
    one of those three last players.  I'm eminently flexible with respect
    to who the other two are, though. :) With you, Pitt and Cal emerging
    as the other three major powers, I'm most curious with respect to how
    things will shake down between the four of us in that respect.
    
    I look forward to hearing your thoughts on the matter.

    Edi thinks I'm crazy to have kept the F Nth. Cal also suggested that I keep
    the F Eng and sail it out into the MAO, trying to hole up in Portugal.
    
    Hohn implies interest in stabbing if Germany and France will be at war, but

    Nothing from Pitt, even though I tried to rile him by stating that his last

    Yeah.
    I guess I'd 'wait and see', as Turkey. His problem is that he is too
    containable unless he breaks into Italy, so if he thinks Austria can hold
    up a while it seems to me his best bet is to try to do that. Austrian
    centers look to be available to Turkey for years to come. Even if they were
    overrun by I/G, Turkey could pick away at them from his sound corner
    position.
    
    Yawn.

    Jim:
    Not much to tell you this time around, as you're privy to the press
    that's been flying between F, E and myself as of late.  The news/letters
    are all true data.  E and R are trying to entice a French stab of
    Germany, believing it to be in the best interests of all.  France,
    validly, worries about the ramifications and the potential of an Italian
    defection.
    
    Russian sensibilities would find it hard to believe Italy would turn
    west and allow AT growth behind him, given the bitter fighting to date.
    However, it *is* a consideration:  both I and T would stand to gain by
    punching through TYS and WesMed, and Edi's carcass could be devoured by
    both for mutual gain and for preparation vs any FG that forms.
    
    For me, it's "much ado about nothing."  My country has been torpedoed to
    the point of death.  I must now depend on either French goodwill
    (rapidly receding) or some "dash to the wire" into GAL or SIL, and hope
    that no enemy unit is nearby to bounce me in fall (yeah, right).
    Methinks next game season will be the last press from the Tsar, unless a

    Any news from G, I, T or A?   If I were Turkey, I'd be writing G and I,
    asking them to hit France (bust through TyS and threaten the stalemate
    line beyond WesMed while F is tied up north), and kill Edi in the
    process.  Then, as a mega-center Turk, I could whimsically crush I or G
    with the other at a later date.
    
    Sigh.....so easy to "spend other people's money."

    Hi Cal
    
    Sorry I didn't respond to you sooner.  This conference is killing me!
    Ah well, in 5 days it will have come and gone!
    
    What's the deal with you / us ?  Do you need me to support you anywhere?
     if you're status quo vs A/T, I can do the GAL thing.  If you're going
    to change horses (I'd consider an alliance with Hohn to eat Edi up and
    get you both into the "gains" column -- of course, we've both tried that
    before), I can still help you somehow, if you have ideas.
    
    If you're after FG, I can also try something if you'd like.  Maybe hit
    MUN, or go to SIL and keep them occupied..could even threaten WAR in an
    offhand way, I guess...until At come calling...
    
    What have you heard from the others?  As a 1-center "minilith," I get
    little-to-no mail anymore, as noted before.  Has France offered you more
    help?  has the Hun mentioned anything about me, or his plans?  Any good
    news from Aus or Tur?  I imagine Edi's sweating bullets, and may be
    offeringyou the world now (-grin-).  Like I said, though, make sure A/T
    aren't trying to spoof you and break up the F/I wall, now that it's set
    up.  I really expect Turkey to be writing you hot and heavy; has he?
    
    Any news from our ol' buddy England?  Ever since the HEL/MUn fiasco,
    we've had little discussions (understandable, I guess).
    
    Anyway, fill in your soon-to-die ally with any advice, news from the
    board, or recommendations from you.  I can go just about anywhere with
    BOH, so offer it up.  After all, even when it goes somewhere, it really
    will go "nowhere."

    King Jean
    
    Whoa.  Italy about to attack you?  News to me.  On the paranoid side, he
    did NOT request the continued goodwill & support of yours truly.  On the
    other hand, he doesn't need me anymore, so why ask?
    
    If he did attack you, they key question is:  with German aid/collusion,
    with A/T's belssing, or on a solo whim?   I can't visualize the latter.
    if with German support, then once again, we come back to the "get them
    before they get you," because if he IS in cahoots with the Hun, the only
    firepower you have *left* is ER, however puny.  (Unless you've got a
    reciprocal deal with A/T, of course.)
    
    Now, if he's made a deal with the twin Eastern devils (singly with Hohn
    or jointly with Hohn or Edi), then that's a horse of a different color.
    He could be in with Hohn, as both could gain from a chop-up of Edi --
    although most of his forces would be busy killing Austria, not you.  The
    only danger from Italy, in my opinion, would be a deal with Turkey,
    where he/they hit TyS and TYO and busted into the Med quickly while your
    fleets putz around with England.   I'll see what I can ascertain about
    such an option.
    
    If it were me, I'd definitely get your F WAL into Ech and/or MAo quickly
    as a preventative.  Know, however, that you can't be strong everywhere.
    if GI or TI (or whatever Italian combo) decide to hit you, it's only a
    matter of time before G dumps on you as well, lest others take "his"
    spoils.
    
    But yes, if Germany *seems* your only ally in these times of potential
    trouble, you'd be crazy to hit him.  Hope your judgment of neighbors is
    better than mine was!   Ah, the perils of short-fuze decisionmaking...
    
    Will see what I can get from Italy, and let you know.  I'll be discrete.
     Keep me in your plans.

    Tsar Faz: Here's my problem.  I became convinced that Italy was ready to
    attack me.  I'm not quite so sure now, but I have reasons for my strong
    suspicions.  If that happens, how can I hit Germany now?   I won't have
    ERI, I'll have ER.  As much as I like you guys, you don't carry much
    firepower.
    
    If you have reason to believe otherwise, let me know.  Maybe you can figure

    John,
    
    No, I think you "did right" in saying something.  Imagine my
    consternation if you DIDN'T say something, and left me hanging.  As much
    as I'm upset and dismayed, I appreciate your frankness.
    
    Please do consider the options.  Yes, it *does* possibly make for a
    hairier situation if you take on a strong Hun and/or a Hun in collusion
    with AT.  But if the latter is true, they're coming for you anyway.  if
    the former, then you need to ask yourself:
    
    -Will I gain more by trusting Pitt and fending off AT, knowing my future
    gains are minimal?  or
    - Will I gain more by hitting Pitt and taking my chances?  In such a
    battle, you have ERI support as loyal puppets, and stand to get the bulk
    of German centers before an AT would.
    
    *THAT* cost-benefit analysis, however, is your call.  I can only
    recommend, but you ultimately decide.
    
    I hope you decide favorably for the Tsar and John Bull.
    
    Oh, FYI:  Italy wished me well in GAL.  Told me he'd try and negotiate
    an option of French suppoort for me to MUN, but that he doubted it would
    work.  He thinks I'm headed for GAL.  Looks like our "radio silence"
    worked well.   Pity if it doesn't go off after all this....

    The more I think about it, the more I agree with you.  We may have the
    forces to hit Germany, but we don't have the reserve to exploit any
    gains
    we might make so long as we are still fighting a war in the Med.
    
    If Turkey does as he "says" he will do and actually DOES hit Austria
    this
    turn, we'll take a fresh look at the situation.  If this does happen, I
    can see a hit on Germany by Spring 1907 (at the latest).  If there is
    NO hit, then I can see us having to enlist Germany's help.  Our best
    strategy in that case would be to try to get Pitt to overextend himself
    eastwards and, hopefully, leave himself open to us.
    
    I'll let you know if I hear any more from anyone.

    Well, by himself, of course not.  However, as you and I both know, Edi is
    extremely sly and slippery.  It would be trivial for him to get help from
    Russia since Russia's only mission in life right now is to give me some
    small measure of payback.  If Edi can also find a way to convince Cal to
    hold with what he's got, I'm in big, big trouble.  Just one more reason

    You make my point for me.  All of the above is a precursor only to an
    attack on you.  It telegraphs my intentions, takes a year just to get
    there, and, when I do, I have, at most, three whole armies to threaten you
    with.  All the while, of course, I have to bend over, drop my drawers, and
    invite the delicate attentions of any and all who are at my rear.  All of
    this just for the possiibility of fighting you for no gain in the east.  I
    guess I must have done something to convince you that I'm a totally
    incompetent player if you truly believe that I am planning on that course
    of action...
    
    >And in light of my earlier (perhaps erroneous) understanding
    >of your relationship with Edi
    
    I could be mistaken but I have always thought that my relationsship with
    Edi was the same as yours - that is, one of mutual benefit and convenience
    for so long as it was of *mutual* benefit and convenience.  I'll stick with
    my friend and ally for so long as it is my best interests (short and long
    term) to do so.  After that, well I'm no altruist and this is Dip, after all.
    
    >Certainly such an attack would leave you somewhat open to a stab by

    I believe that but I also have considerable faith in your diplomatic
    skills.  I don't think it's beyond the realm f possibility that you cold
    convince him to join you in a mutual attack on Austria if you were also
    able to convince France or I to attack the other.  Then, when Austria was
    toast, you could swallow up Italy while France and I were entangled.  You'd
    be in the catbird seat then.

    You and France take him out.  I feel quite certain that France would be
    very open to this idea if you were to propose it and show him that you were
    serious about it.  I *know* that I'd be very receptive to a plan that had
    you and I taking out Austria.
    
    >I'm all for logic and efficiency.  My concern is based partly on the
    >above paragraph, though.  If you and France are so solid, my fears of
    >attack by you increase.
    
    Right back at you with the "3-way is the best possible outcome" rationale.
    If we agree that a solo is not going to happen (and we *do* agree, believe
    me), a 3-way is the best possible option.  No way I'm stupid enough to try
    for a 2-way with players of this caliber.
    
    >Perhaps we will both be benefited by talking specifics.  What do you
    >think we should do this upcoming turn, and then in fall?
    
    I'm going to move to cover myself against that Russian army and be in
    position to go after Austria if you choose to join me in the fall.  Until I
    see something more concrete (in words and actions), I'm not willing to be
    more specific.  By more concrete, I'm not talking about an outright attack
    on Edi but, rather, no hostile moves towards me and ensuring that your
    units are in place to attack Edi if you want to do so.

    Sultan,
    
    I was not listening to disinfo, only observing your support for Germany's
    capture of St Pete.  A friendly gesture, at least.  That's why I don't
    understand your desire now to attack him.
    
    Looking at the board, a logical move would be for you to help Italy carve
    up Austria's remains, then see what beckons.  Are you still committed to
    Austria or are you thinking about how to dissect him?
    
    If Italy would leave you alone, you could do it by yourself, even.
    
    Without a hint or two about the eastern/Med situation, I can't reassess my
    relationship with Germany.  So far, we've been working well together.
    That's all I know for sure.

    Having dealt extensively with the Russian, I don't think there's any

    That said, I do think Bohemia is going to hit Munich this turn.  He is
    hoping for support from France, but I tend to doubt John will give it
    to him.

    No, it's more an overdeveloped sense of paranoia on my part.
    
    When you state it like you do above, it clearly exposes my fears as

    Even then, there's no way I'd make anything but slow headway in
    Balkans and Austria.  I've gamed it out, and there's no way I can get
    into a position to take 18 fast enough, even if you and France fight.
    
    I wish that were not so, but we have to take the situation as it lies,
    I suppose.

    If we do it that way, we should be able to wrap this game up within a

    OK.  I'd be up for that.  Perhaps we can start another one if we

    Even if I felt safe enough to move west now, I would need to get

    I suspect you're right.  If I was France, I probably would have hit
    Italy LAST turn, but that would have left him fighting A/I/T, so
    holding off was probably a wise move.  He may actually be waiting for
    Austria to fall far enough that he isn't a threat.  Once you hit
    Edi, that may signal France to go ahead and hit me.  I'll have to
    gamble that he'll wait for that and I'm safe this turn.  After THAT,
    I'll have to cover my self each turn til I turn on him.

    Me too!  What has Edi been saying to you?  And have you heard from
    France
    at all?  I've heard from neither Edi nor Pitt this turn.

    Probably too ambitious, but I want to try.  It'll be about sixty

    I couldn't talk France into supporting you to Munich, so if you could

    Yup, which is more than I can say for Edi, whom I've NOT heard from.
    Hohn is talking about hitting Edi this turn ("top secret: by the way,
    although it IS pretty obvious) and it seems likely.  It's certainly
    in his best interest.  Last time I thought that, he really did have a
    choice as who to ally with.  His options are much more limited this
    time.

    Like I said, if you can hit Galicia, that'd be fine.  If by some fluke
    you get it, I'll do my best to get you into a centre in the Fall.

    Live, from Russian-controlled Bohemia, it's time for the weekly talk
    show, "Interview with a Vampire."  As you know, each week we try and
    find a local Balkan bloodsucker to discuss matters of regional
    importance.  Today's guest is that noted chameleon and Master of Fluff,
    Transylvania's Own, Edvard BirSauron (cheers and applause resonate).
    
    Host (H):  Welcome, Edi.  Why are you looking over your shoulder, and
    what's that sound?
    
    E:  Glad to be here.  Oh, the sound seems to be...ah...geez, it sounds
    like someone's sharpening a knife on a whetting stone.   Hey, what's
    that lawyer doing in the audience?!
    
    H:  Well, anyway, BirSauron, welcome again to the show.  As the regional
    vampire, what's been happening in your *neck* (haw haw!) of the woods?
    
    E:  Oh, much excitement.  Let's see...I write a lot of press about dark
    horses and gloomy fog, and that always seems to get people excited.  And
    don't forget my reams of vacuous press.  To misquote Sir Winston
    Churchill,  "Never in the annals of gaming has so little been said in so
    many pages by so untruthful an individual."   I also make a lot of phone
    calls, and I'm pretty good at telling my neighbors about bonehead moves
    they make, all the while offering nothing constructive in return.  Oh,
    did I mention a lot of fluff in my move proposals for (chuckle)
    "allies?"
    
    H:  Uh, yeah, BeerMan, you did.  But let's move on.  What does the
    future hold for your nation?
    
    E:  I envision everything will change when we eliminate the pesky
    Russian in Bohemia.  As you know, Tsar Faz has been a pain-in-the-NECK
    ever since the mutual stab we pulled on each other in 1902.  I managed
    to "lie low" (in the coffin during daylight) and let him take the rap
    for stabs and non-supports of Turkey and England, and have managed to
    rule the night.  And let's not forget the perpetual lying schtick that
    A, T and G have been giving him.  Yep, in a couple more turns our
    combined half-dozen units from three nations will finally eradicate the
    little cockraoch, and I'm sure Austrian fortunes will only rise after
    that.  Why, I'm working a half-dozen deals with I, F, G, E and even guys
    who haven't done a game-start yet.  You just watch.  I'll rise from the
    grave with even more force soon -- they don't call me the Teflon Count
    for nothing.
    
    H:  But what of your neighbors?  With Tsar Faz but a memory, who's next
    on your hit parade?
    
    E:  Well, I've done my usual thorough PsychoProfile checks, estimated
    projected gains in synch with the lunar cycle, and have asked my Dark
    LordUnderlings for advice.  And I'm sure we'll have that answer in a few
    mo....((yells off-stage)) "Hey, hey!, stop grinding that blade on the
    whetting stone!"  Ok, where was I?
    
    H:  We were discussing future Austrian plans.
    
    E:  Oh yes.  Well, never mind!  Suffice it to say that I've offered
    everything to everyone, and I'm sure that in saying nothing, I've said
    everything.  And already the offers are flowing in.  Yep; just waitin'
    on the best one, is all.  As the old song says, "The future's so bright,
    I gotta wear shades."  But I would say that -- I'm a vampire (yuk yuk)!
    ((audience chuckles absentmindedly))
    
    H:  Mmm-hmmm.   Would you mind if we interviewed your fellow bloodsucker
    and game honcho, Hohn Cho?
    
    E:  ((fidgets)) Well, sure.  Not a problem.  Well, actually, it is a
    problem.  Ever since the Elvis Presley Imitator took his bad nose job to
    small claims court, Hohn's been, ah, busy.  I'm afraid he's out of
    pocket, I haven't talked to him since 1902.
    
    H:  Ok, let's skip Hohn.  Final question.  if you could be King of the
    Board for a day, what would you do?
    
    E:  Oh, easy question!  I'd give peace and free centers to all.  I'd
    re-ally with Russia and Italy, and invade Germany, like I promised in
    Winter 1900.  And I'd tell Pitt to lay off England and Russia; he's such
    a "pitt-stol."  And then we'd end the game with a 7-way and write great
    press about it afterwards.
    
    H:  Ah, Edi, your nose is growing awfully huge.  Folks, that's all the
    time we have.  Tune in again next week, when "Interview with a Vampire"
    profiles Count Armm-Pitt of Germany, sharing the chair with his siamese
    twin, "John the Holder" of France.  Should be a hum-dinger of a show.

    I've been corresponding with Pitt and Edi a good amount.  Not a lot

    I think Edi is still with me.  Pitt claims friendship, but I am

    Jim,
    
    God_damn_, I love it when a plan comes together!
    
    See, it's times like this when I wonder where I'd be if I'd been able
    to conduct full negotiations each and every turn.  Everything went off
    exactly as I'd hoped and planned.  Pitt came through, I feel as though
    Edi and Cal danced to my tunes while I was pulling the strings, and
    John and Mark (OK, I had nothing to do with Mark; although his attack
    on Munich has heightened my credibility with Pitt, I suspect, since I
    predicted it) didn't meddle in the Balkans as I asked.
    
    This is my second "pleased as punch" turn, the first being my taking
    of Sevastopol from Mark.
    
    Now, the question becomes what is up with France.  I'd thought we were
    going to just take the three-way, me, Pitt and John, but it now
    appears I was mistaken.
    
    I'll certainly stand with Pitt against John, at least until I've
    solidified my position.  Perhaps John will have a rapprochement with
    Pitt in light of my successes this turn.  We'll see.  In any case, I'm
    very pleased, and am feeling good about my prospects in this game.

    I kind of gave you a clue, but then John specifically asked me not to tell,
    and in fact suggested that I lie and tell you that he had resisted my
    overtures. I struck a compromise of silence.
    
    Good timing, anyway. And a huge stab. And good cover--John told me a couple
    of days ago that at first he was worried that an I/T alliance might spoil
    his personal plot, but that then he had determined that "Austria and Turkey
    are thick as thieves". Well, no honor among thieves, they say!

    Oh, no problem.
    
    Hohn has just stabbed Edi *hard*. A great stab. Edi got a good strike
    against Italy. France and Italy are still at peace, though they seem to
    have crossed signals over which of them was going to Ion. Pitt mysteriously
    supported Munich, so you didn't get it; otherwise the French attack went as
    expected.
    
    You'll see.

    Merci, Monsieur.
    
    Very bad luck over Munich, we'd have him over a barrel if he'd played the
    obvious Ber-Sil. I wonder what happened there. Do you think he smelled it,
    or did he just not have enough time to think through his move, as he hinted?
    
    There are loads of chances, anyway. I suspect Pitt will abandon Bel, since
    it's indefensible; the three of us together have a fairly long-shot guess
    to take Bel and one other from him. I'll look things over--I think I have a
    pretty good sense of Pitt's style.
    
    Did you know Hohn would stab? Interesting game, no doubt about that.

    Hol-Kie, and Ber S Mun, I bet. Well, there are still chances for you,
    though they are thinning out awfully rapidly.
    
    Hohn chose a nice time to stab, I think. France and Turkey are clearly the
    front runners now.
    
    If you beat me to oblivion, I can't say I'll be disappointed, but I do hope
    you'll make it another round....
    
    Are we crossing messages now? I know you're on line....

    Hey Pitt,
    Let me help with those orders, if you're too busy (-grin-)...
    
    Mun-Boh, Ber-Sil, Edi and Hohn move west, Faz in the vise, at last.....
    
    How hard is it?

    Sorry for being late.  One of my investigators fell ill yesterday afternoon
    and I had to go out on a surveillance myself on short notice.
    Unfortunately, I had no opportunity to get in orders before going and,
    since this was a mobile surv and this turkey is a night owl, I was on the
    go all night.  I just got home a little while ago and I'm putting in orders
    now.  I hope they make sense but I'm too beat to really tell.
    
    -Pitt
