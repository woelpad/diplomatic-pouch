    Just to remind everyone, a player is currently out of town who has chosen
    not to tell everyone of his whereabouts.  As a result, the BUILDS (the
    next season due) are due at midnight on Monday.  This request was made
    of me prior to said player's departure.
    
    All things considered, we are making fairly good progress for summer
    time.  I know of no hold ups approaching in the next couple of weeks.
    Updates to me on your thoughts on the game and vacation updates would
    be appreciated.

    I want to point out that I never received the retreat phase (Jim had to
    send it to me separately).  As for future delays, as I've said before,
    I'll be away for ten days (or so) starting the Friday of the Labour Day
    weekend.

    I am torn between A Mar and F Mar.  F Mar would help to defend against
    further TI movements west, but an army would give me more offensive
    capabilities.  Also, if I do have to hold the line later, and army is so
    much harder to destroy.
    
    I think you should build f lon (obvious, I suppose).
    
    Edi has pleaded for A Mar, for evident reasons.  I'm afraid that if I don't
    build an army, he's gone.

    The army would be better if my plan is to go get Lvp and then defend myself

    Well, he didn't tell me *why* you weren't asnwering my press but he did

    It's fairly obvious that Turkey will soon be looking at your centers for
    easy pickings.  He can see that I have a good chance of stopping him from
    moving further west.  Even if he does make headway, it' will be tough
    sledding, and he'll always have to worry about you in the backfield.  So,
    unless you have more faith in Hohn than his behavior in this game warrants,
    you might consider preparing for the coming Turkish attack.
    
     I reiterate my view of the game: this will end in a draw, unless we allow
    Turkey to win it.  I do not see France having any chance to win, so I want
    to be part of the draw.
    
    With that said, I renew my offer of support and friendship.  I intend to
    build in Marseilles, but I can build either a fleet or an army.  I would
    like your opinion of what I should do.  It might sway my decision.
    
    Please also inform me how you see the coming year or two.  Am I way off?

    >correct?
    
    Correct.  It's very unlikely that I will have an opportunity to build and,
    since I'm down a unit already, the loss of an SC doesn't cost me another
    unit.  I will need the SC when it looks as if I'm going to lose another
    unit or when it looks like I might get a build (in my next lifetime maybe...)
    
    >Pitt, do you want to see WAR move to SIL, or would you prefer
    >something else?
    
    If you're ordering SEV-MOS, WAR-LVN is not absolutely necessary.  However,
    WAR-SIL doesn't give me all that much help in the near future either.  I
    think WAR-LVN is the best move because then you can support yourself into
    STP (the only way we can be sure you take it next spring).

    Correct.  And, until he does, any further discussion of alliance moves

    Right now, you stand to have the best shot at winning the game
    outright.  With Pitt collapsing rapidly on all fronts, you can pick up
    his centres and have a shot at Scandinavia and even St Pete's.  With
    your unit in Tyrolia, you are across the stalemate line and, if you can
    pick up any of Venice, Vienna or Trieste (or for that matter Tunis), you
    will have your 18 centres.
    
    Hohn understands this and he knows that, if he stabs me, I will throw
    that 18th centre your way.  I really can't see him able to stab me for
    ALL of my centres on one turn.  Even if he could, he'd have to use so
    much of his forces to do so, you'd be able to advance across the
    stalemate line.  He'd end up watching you grab that 18th dot just as he
    hits 15 or 16.  Definitely not in his best interest and that's what I'm
    depending on.
    
    At the same time, I'm not going to press an attack on you in the Med so
    hard that it takes me far from my centres.  While Hohn knows he has much
    to lose by attacking me, I don't need to tempt him like that.  You
    needn't fear me trying to break through your defenses and attacking your
    homeland.  Even if I could (unlikely), that's not in MY best interest.

    I disagree with the part that you cannot win.  You can win unless I make
    myself part of a stalemate line.  Your part in a draw is a virtual
    certainty, however.
    
    > With that said, I renew my offer of support and friendship.  I intend to

    I'd rather you built a fleet so we can get on with the business of
    building a Mediterranean stalemate line.  But that's my (very) biased
    opinion.  :)
    
    > Please also inform me how you see the coming year or two.  Am I way off?
    
    What do *I* hope for the next couple of years?  I'd like to build up one
    or two more centres and create a stalemate line in the Med that a) you
    can't break through, and b) Hohn dare not attack for fear that you would
    get Tunis.  I'd also like to see the two of you eliminate England and
    Germany and face off against each other in the Prussia to Tyrolia
    neutral zone.
    
    Once that happens, we can call a three way stalemated draw.
    
    So, am I dreaming?
    
    Cal
    PS: btw, whatever happens, congrats on a well played game.
