    Sorry I was late last turn, folks.  I've been in the process of changing jobs,
    and it's been hectic.  I actually sent my orders in a mere few hours after the
    deadline, but unfortunately the timing was bad and the judge went down, thus
    delaying processing until it came back up.
    
    Oh, and by the way, Pitt, where exactly do entertainment lawyers rank on your
    lawyer low-archy? ;)

    Mark,
    
    I really like the idea of turning west with you, both
    against Pitt and against Edi.
    
    I propose a modification: Ukraine to Rumania, Sevastopol and
    Black Sea support.  That demilitarizes us a bit, and doesn't
    waste a move of Black Sea to Sevastopol that could otherwise
    be used to support.
    
    You might want to consider building a fleet in St.
    Petersburg, although of course I will understand if you feel
    it necessary to build an army instead.
    
    I'm trying to hammer something out with Cal right now.
    We'll see if we can come to an arrangement.

    I also thought it went very well, except for the failed attack on WAR.

    I am indeed still up for attacking Edi.  I moved to BUL because I
    didn't trust him completely, and it turned out to be a good thing.
    He's telling me he just moved to RUM to prevent the Russian from
    moving or retreating there, but as we didn't discuss or prearrange
    that particular move, I wasn't exactly thrilled to see it.  I've
    played it off as no big deal, but it still grated on me.
    
    As for the support into WAR, that wasn't about bolstering Edi, it was
    about trying to take Mark out.  I still don't want to see Mark
    powerful, especially given his history with me this game.

    I agree.  And I think you can see I'm in prime position to move
    against Edi now.  RUM is mine for sure, and BUL is in position to
    attack or support an attack on GRE.

    If you want to build F NAP, that's absolutely fine, but in light of
    that I must of course build F SMY.  Even if those things both occur,
    I'm still open to working with you, and do not intend to launch a war
    against you either.
    
    Let me know if you change your mind about your build.

    Hmm, you seem to have been suckered by that dastardly German again!
    Bummer.
    
    I can't do much to help other than to promise you no threat from the Med
    (like I could anyway...) although I would suggest you take as much off
    England as you can.  He's a real loose cannon and his centres are better
    off in your hands than supporting his chaotic units.
    
    I guess advice is all I can offer right now.

    Well, that turn went about as well as could be reasonably expected, from
    my point of view.
    
    Are you still going to attack Edi?  Your moves didn't particularly
    indicate that you still want to go by what we discussed on the phone.
    Admittedly, you took Bul, but that could have been a pre-arranged
    centre-swap and you DID try to support him to War.  But for some lucky
    guesses on Mark's part, Edi would have still built one.
    
    I really want to stress that taking out Edi is the only way for you to
    get centres FAST.  There are only two more Russian centres left to take
    and I now have enough units to make it difficult for you and Edi to take
    me out quick.  Also, with the apparent German stab of France, you and I
    now have enough time to take care of business at our end of the board
    and move west before they resolve that chaos.
    
    I want to let you know in advance that, because of my uncertainty about
    your intentions, I am forced to build a fleet in Naples this Winter,
    just to make sure that A/T does not outnumber me in fleets.  If you're
    still willing to work with me, this fleet can always be used in a future
    war against France.  Either way, I am not about to launch the war
    against you that Edi is begging me for...

    I've suspected an A/G for a while.  Them being in Sweden together
    doesn't
    do much to change my mind...

    I have to get something from Hohn first.  I've been working on trying to
    get him to stab Edi and, in a phone call, he seemed interested.  Fleet
    Naples is most likely whether Hohn's with me or agin me.

    I like this option, again depending on feedback from Hohn.

    Hi Edi,
    A resend of a mistyped address yesterday...
    
       ----- Original message follows -----
    
    --------- Begin forwarded message ----------
    
    Well it looks like we may have some chance of doing something if you will
    get
    out of my Country.
    
    ** Funny thing, Edi:  that was MY line I was going to say to you!
    
    May I suggest that with the demise of the English and the
    apparant resurgance of the French-German that you consider the following
    possibilities:
    F Swe-Baltic
    A Boh-Sil
    A War-Pru
    A StP-Mos
    A Mos-War
    
    ** These are moves I was also considering, although it would, as you're
    doubtless aware, require a GREAT leap of faith for me to expect you to
    let me alone and to encourage the Turk to do likewise.
    
    This would disengage you from my front and give you a firm position
    against
    the German.
    
    ** And where does this leave me vis a vis the Turks?  Or regarding you?
    
    I for my part can leave you alone in Warsaw and concentrate on the
    Italians
    
    ** You've provided nice examples for my moves; how about your own units?
    
    unfortunately though I can not afford to turn on the Turks at this time
    with
    the Italians in my home centers.
    
    ** Wonder what it would be like if *I* said, "unfortunately I can't
    afford to turn on the Germans at this time with Turks in my home centers
    (and Austrians at the door)?"
    
    
    Anyway it is a possibility.
    
    ** Yes, it is.  These moves are indeed well-crafted against Pitt, but you
    can't honestly expect me to believe you'll let me alone while still
    staying allied with the Turks?  I'll take my chances hitting Vie, Gal, or
    supporting Pitt to Tyo.  Better to die with a Turkish spear in my chest,
    rather than an Austrian dagger in my back.  The last one hurt.

    Hm, that was disappointing. Now I know why France wasn't offering Belgium. :)
    
    Well, if you'd have let me have Norway, I would certainly have built in
    Liverpool and done anything I could to help you against France. Instead,
    I'll have to let John take Liverpool, presumably by convoy, since there
    isn't a thing I can do about it. I don't really understand why you bounced
    me from Norway. I guess you must have had your reasons.

    I'm glad you're so happy with the outcome. This season was the nail in my
    coffin, as far as I can tell. I have no way to prevent France from
    convoying into Liverpool, and no way to get Liverpool back once it's taken,
    and defending my island against an army will be hopeless.
    
    I don't think I'll take Norway. I have to decide whether to defend against
    Germany or France. I'll check to see whether there appears to be any chance
    that Germany will take this opportunity to invade France; otherwise I guess
    I'll have to let France walk in while I hold off Germany a few more turns,
    giving you a chance for a while longer too.
    
    I don't know whether the Judge is working. It didn't send the mail I sent a

    >Well, not all bad, but I am curious as to your move to Burgundy, which we
    >both declared neutral territory.   What's up?
    
    Just curious, eh?  If I were you, I'd be a bit more concerned than that.
    However, no concern is necessary.  I wanted to be sure that I could
    successfully get PIC further west *and* protect against a stab (Yes, I did
    hear the rumors and though I was not inclined to believe them, I figured
    that I'd protect myself just in case).
    
    I hope you're not too concerned about it since BUR is no closer to PAR than
    PIC was and, though BUR is closer to MAR, PIC was closer to BRE.  In any
    case, BUR will be going to MUN or RUH next turn and we will then have our
    DMZ in BUR.
    
    I hope you're comfortable with that.  All in all we are in excellent
    position.  I intentionally blocked England in NOR to prevent him from
    getting a build in LVP.  LVP is now yours for sure and we should be able to
    make short work of him after that.
    
    Any other ideas or suggestions?

    Aha. Well, that does explain (what I found very surprising) Germany's
    gung-ho attitude. I thought he'd send me a gloating message, and was
    puzzled to be essentially called a co-conspirator.
    
    You can't trust Pitt, you know. (Ask anybody.) Maybe you can't trust me
    either, but for sure you can't trust him. (If only you had moved to English
    Channel instead, you'd have more options. Oh well, I've had plenty of
    opportunity for "if only"s this game!) I'm under no illusion about the
    extent to which I can trust him, but I'm in one of those positions where I
    no longer have a choice.

    Actually, you may have been the recipient of some good fortune.  While I
    know you have no reason to believe anything I say and will move on the
    assumption that I am entirely hostile (which I may well be), Germany did
    violate an understanding that Burgundy remain open.  He was to have vacated
    French territory by now.   I await an explanation.  Meanwhile, I am
    reconsidering the situation.

    Jim,
    
    Did not mean to ignore you.  Current thinking: I am committed to the F/G
    for the time being.  Pitt is not very communicative, but I can handle it.
    Maybe that will change now that he's done with dipcon.  Of course, I am
    more than curious about Pic-Bur.  That was supposed to be an open province.
    
    I wish I could help Russia more.  He's still in this, with five units on
    the board.  I thought he'd be in worse shape than that.
    
    Not at all upset to see Austria take a hit.  Edi helped arrange the FG
    alliance, but he did so for his own purposes, hoping I would pressure Italy
    while he dominated in the East.
    
    Long term possibility: finish off England and go into the Med while Germany
    takes Scandinavia.  I hope Italy is not too powerful by then.

    (StP) Tsar Faz, elated at the (for now) "save" of both Nwy and War, has
    decorated Marshall Pullitoff, the architect of the "Hail Mary" option
    plan that not only delayed the AT advance, but also liberated Trieste
    and placed it under the benevolent Italian, Doge Cal.
    
    "The 'active proposals' put forth by the Austrian regarding A/R
    (non-)relations are indeed 'active:' actively hosing Russia since 1902
    (one need only see who owned RUM long before the Austrians jackbooted
    their way in there this year)--to include their rapacious try for War
    only this past turn.  And now the Austrians offer "peace" in their
    terms:  "leave Boh, turn on your friends, completely vacate the Southern
    Front, 'trust us, Tsar Faz,' and everything will be all right."  We in
    Russia have heard this siren song before; it nearly wrecked our ship of
    state on rocky shoals.    We are unmoved.
    
    No, the true course for good allies is to continue to support common war
    aims wherever possible.
    The 'whispers of a nightmare' that BirSauron (known affectionately in
    Tsarist circles as "GarbageBin") hear are not for Russia, nor are they
    the gaseous vapors that emanate from the hind sections of his Dark
    Riders (and their nags).   Nay, he hears, as the Jefferson Starship
    sings, "...Winds of Change (are) going by."
    
    Holy Russia -- indeed, all Europe--hopes the winds bring a new breeze to
    the continent.  One unpolluted by the Foul One and his evil minions, who
    blacken the land with their odious deeds.
    
    We hope the Archduke enjoys his Albanian retreat, and wish more of his
    folks would go there.

    I expected your explanation to be about what it was, because it makes
    sense.  It's true that the situation is little changed tactically.  Also,
    if you meant to attack, you'd still be in Pic.
    
    FYI, England is claiming that you are trying to make peace with him, in
    prep for war against me.  Also, Russia is worried that unless I attack you,
    he will suffer German attack.
    
    I don't know what your response is to Edi's pleas for help.  Seems to me he

    GKJ,
    Yes, I realize the moves were *not* the best for your country.  I was
    9obviously) focused only on the anti-G aspects of the move(s).  There is
    nothing you can do vs France this season, and if he convoys the army, you
    end up with a medium-length agonizing defense.
    
    If you're NOT going to take Nwy, then we need to figure a good move this
    season.  I would suggest one option to be:
    
    Nwg-Nwy (bouncing any 1-on-1 Hun?)
    Nth-Den (Swe S)...with me retreating to BAL if he takes swe, and then the
    two of us hitting Nwy and/or Den (or Ber) come fall.
    
    This obviously enrages Pitt to the point that trade one enemy (A/T) for
    another...or perhaps merely add a third neighbor to my "enemies list."
    it is, however, an option to keep Pitt occupied while France becomes the
    cornerstone of the west.
    
    Ghod, and I thought F/T would be the first two to die.  Curse you,
    BirSauron!

    Dedication points are scores that the Judge keeps for each registered
    player. They are supposed to be a very rough indicator of a player's
    dedication. You gain points every time you submit a move on time. You lose
    points every time you are late submitting a move (and more as days pass and

    Well, my speech was sincere.
    
    But, you don't know me very well, so you are excused. Only don't let it
    happen again.
    
    I won't believe anything you say now. If for some reason you decide you
    want to cooperate after all, just get yourself into a position to really
    attack France. If you do, and I can get into a position to help, maybe
    we'll negotiate. (I will try to move to the English Channel anyway.)
    
    You don't seem to be in a particularly good position, considering.
    Dislodging Russia from Sweden is pretty risky. I won't let you into North
    Sea. And your attacking prospects vs. France are not great, either, though
    they could be great if France goes all out against me.
    
    Well, it will be interesting to see how this plays out. I may still have a
    chance if you let me have one. Otherwise I'll just have to decide which of
    the many powers who have stabbed me deserve to have revenge wreaked upon
    them.

    Tsar Faz,
    
    Let's see.
    
    Well, do you think you'll use your A Stp inland, or would you want to send
    it to Scandinavia? I can think of some good plans if the latter. If the
    former, we are more constrained and would have to try a trick.
    
    
    >Nwg-Nwy (bouncing any 1-on-1 Hun?)
    
    Hey, don't call me "Hun", you don't know me that well!
    
    >Nth-Den (Swe S)...with me retreating to BAL if he takes swe, and then the
    >two of us hitting Nwy and/or Den (or Ber) come fall.
    
    Hm.
    
    I think maybe he won't try for Sweden, simply because a retreat to Baltic
    is so troublesome for Germany. He might well try to sneak into Norway,
    especially if he figures I'll be sending my fleets elsewhere.
    
    Here's a Big Secret. I am seriously considering Nth-Hel, Lon-Nth. It's a
    really good position, considering. If Stp-Nwy, Swe S Stp-Nwy, we'd be in a
    very aggressive position even if Germany dislodges you from Sweden.
    
    There are too many possibilities--tell me whether you are even considering
    Stp-Scandinavia.
    
    My current feeling is to abandon any defense against France and try to
    screw up Germany's position, maybe hole up somewhere else as a renegade
    house. I'll keep you posted.

    Thanks for understanding.  You'll see further confirmation next turn.
    
    >FYI, England is claiming that you are trying to make peace with him, in
    >prep for war against me.
    
    Well, of *course* he is...;-)  He's not too happy with me right now since
    my bouncing him in NOR prevented him from building in LVP and blocking you.
     Now, I'm not going to insult you and say that I might not consider an
    action like he's claiming if it were sufficiently to my advantage but I
    don't see how it could be at the moment.  He's certainly in no position to
    help me and I'm in no position to attack you without giving you advance
    warning.  Moreover, I need your help to finish off England (FYI, I *am*
    expecting a fair share of those spoils...) and I have the RA situation to
    deal with on my eastern flank.
    
    >Also, Russia is worried that unless I attack you,
    >he will suffer German attack.
    
    Well, I'm not surprised.  He's been one of the players feeding me rumors
    about your eveil intentions toward me.  It only seems right that he should
    do the same regarding me to you...      Frankly, he's right to be worried
    about my future plans.  So long as you and I can keep a strong alliance,
    he's my next target (though I'd prefer you not pass that along to him...)
    
    >I don't know what your response is to Edi's pleas for help.  Seems to me he

    Agreed.  If we get the opportunity, however, we should take advantage of it
    to move one or two of our units into the area.  Then we will be in a
    position to influence matters to our advantage, wherever that might lie.

    I did it to protect NWY.  I *knew* that England was going to try for NWY,
    which is why I tried to get you to cover it.  When you made it clear that
    you were not going to, I decided I had to.  I would have liked to support

    possible.

    Look...I'd love to come riding to your aid but I simply must resolve the
    situation in the west.  It's that simple.  I'm doing the best I can to help
    you stay strong (as noted above, as well as through diplomacy with other
    powers, notably Italy and Turkey).  If I just drop everything and head
    east, I won't be much help to you or anybody because that will invite a
    French stab.  I should think you'd be suitably appreciative with what I
    *am* able to do...
    
    >As it stands now, your stated goal -- for me to hold off the hordes -- is

    I'm glad you think so.  Of course, that's easy to do when you're not
    adjacent to him and you won't be the recipient if the stab, should it come.
    
    >Anyway, please consider doing "something" (in an anti-AT manner, of

    BOTH?!  England is only interested in your untimely demise, fer cryin' out
    loud!  I am simply amazed that you could consider anything else.  Frankly,
    I'm beginning to feel like I'm backing the wrong horse.  I knew what
    England's moves were goung to be last turn and I moved to protect you, my
    ally.  I could have moved to put myself into position to better threaten
    England but I elected not to in order to cover NWY.  Yet, you still talk of
    England and I as if you considered us both the same.  Hell, maybe I should
    have let him take NWY and gone after SWE and WAR myself, as he and Edi
    suggested.

    Fair enough.
    
    I'm not totally convinced that Germany's lying. Maybe he is. Or maybe he's
    lying to you. (Probably to both of us.) But your point is that Germany
    would surely say the same thing to me no matter what his actual plans. And
    I pretty much agree.
    
    The thing is, I have this feeling that if you ever actually committed
    yourself to making certain moves, you'd do it, or at least you'd feel some
    pull to do it. I draw this conclusion from the remarkable *absence* of any
    commitment made ahead of time in past moves.
    
    But, you aren't making any commitments now, either. Maybe because you are
    just hoping I'll do what you want, making it easier for you to keep Germany
    off your back while you try for all of the English centers. Or maybe for
    some other reason. So I'll have to make my decision by consulting tea
    leaves.

    Pitt,
    Yoiks!  Looking over my note to you, I can see where you'd be somewhat
    non-plused (understatement of the decade, I'll wager).
    
    I do indeed appreciate you covering NWY, honest Injun.  I do disagree,
    however, that England is of necessity gunning for me.  Maybe I'm overly
    optimistic with him -- and now with his two fleets up there, we'll soon
    see -- but I honestly think he and I have no axes to grind.  Color me
    naive...
    
    Part of my paranoia was your move to Den this turn (although entirely
    understandable, I realize, given recent E and R actions).   I tend to get
    flustered when beset upon by large coalitions (despite your anti-F
    worries, that situation has *not* been done to you this game).  I see two
    Germans near Swe, your verbal-only support for the East, and Edi's smooth
    siren songs, and I add 1+1+1... and get 5.  Crazy?  Probably...Never said
    I wasn't, though....
    
    I sincerely hope you don't stab me, a la BirSauron's wishes.  Edi tends
    to yelp loudest when he's beset upon, and this thing may -- may --
    actually begin to start working against him and/or Hohn soon.  To do
    that, I need to remain viable.  And that's why I *DO* appreciate your
    help and support...never doubt that!   I mean, a stab of me hastens the
    arrival of AT into SIL and WAR...and also brings in vagaries of retreats,
    Eng actions, etc etc.  It's just plain messy for us all.
    
    As for the north:  we can do a variety of things, if you're interested:
    - You retaking Nth (thus tying down Nwg and nth) while I retry for Nwy;
    - Me moving to nwy, supported by  Ska;
    - Me supporting you there (if you expect a bounce w/England);
    - Something new and different (surprise me).
    
    In the West, I honestly don't see your concern over France.  Seems to me
    you two have arranged a nice, slow, phased withdrawal, with you "backing
    out" of PIC and heading home, thus freeing MUN for the east.   I mean,
    c'mon, Pitt:  if he was such an all-fired threat to YOU, why move to iri
    to set up an anti-Eng convoy?  Why not attack you in PIC or drive you out
    somehow?  No...my bet is you've reached a deal, however "11th hour" it
    came...it just doesn't look hostile between you guys.   (hence my desire
    for that eastern help.)
    
    It's no big deal, though.  If you can't spare the guy due to other
    worries, I'll take my chances.  I've done 'ok' (ha!) so far without
    eastern German armies, and I'll work it that way if need be.   Your
    diplomatic support is always d esired when dealing with I, A and T, by
    the way....
    
    But please please please, don't mistake my poorly-worded letters for
    'abuse' or as cause for your frustration.  I'm perfectly happy with the
    status quo, and think I might be able to hold these guys off as you head
    off on your plans.
    
    Am I sufficiently repentant?

    GKJ,
    Short note before soccer practice...
    
    I like your idea of StP-Nwy...MUCH depends on what Turkey is
    doing...supposedly he and Cal have some secret handshakes going on
    regarding Austria (if one can actually believe that)!  If true, perhaps
    it might not be bad to go trapising off to nwy....let me mull that over.
    
    Got the 'thundercloud" note from Pitt. He's frustrated that i don't see
    you as a threat, he "had" to move to nwy last turn because he "knew"
    you'd try for Nwy, he's mad that I said he's a sluggo in the east
    (non-support), and he's wondering if he shouldn't actually listen to
    Edi's pleas and take WAR and SWE..
    
    Uh-oh.
    
    I was sufficiently repentant, with just a veil of threat about "vagaries
    of retreats" should he take SWE.  I think I've poured balm on the wound,
    but it might not hurt to check my flanks as I beat my head vs AT.
    
    Keep me apprised.  I like your BigSecret idea.

    Great!  Yes, I'll play the "defensive" mode for another turn, just to
    make sure this isn't one last hurrah from the AT forces, but I'm feeling
    good about this.  Come fall, things will surely shake up the board!
    
    On the Scandinavian front:  Pitt did indeed send a note of "frustration"
    -- I guess my wonderful correspondence style touches the hearts of
    EVERYone this game, not just my Balkan neighbors -grin-.  He said "maybe
    I should just listen to Edi and take SIL and SWE....whoa.
    
    So, yes, I do need to watch out for Pitt and for the now-gimpy-wristed
    Jamie.  Having said that, though, I think Pitt will refrain from having
    me retreat to BAL and taking BER in the event of a hit, and Jamie has
    been mentioning some plans regarding both F and G.  So I'm worried, but
    no more than any other precarious position I'm in on the map!
    
    Thanks again for the note and the words of encouragement.  I think (I
    *hope*) you'll find that I'm not such a bad guy to work with after
    all...especially when you've got me essentially neutered down south
    anyway.  I certainly look forward to spreading that Hohn Cho "charm" to

    What are your specific plans this turn?  I'm going to work with Mark and
    either take Vie or Alb.  I assume you're going to take Rum this turn and
    support your Smy fleet into the Aeg?

    Not really.  I think we're in good shape, actually.  Mark is willing
    to pull west if I hit Edi this turn, and since I plan on doing that,
    I'm hoping Mark will follow-through.  It's in his best interest, since

    All sounds good.  Do what you feel you need to do with respect to your
    defense, and I'll demilitarize UKR into RUM.  Then we can move further

    Pitt,
    
    England offered to move to Hel if I would help him survive.  Of course, I
    expressed interest (to see what he'd divulge), but I did not encourage the
    move.  He also said that you have been urging him to enter Eng.  That would
    no doubt give you options re Nth and Nwy, so I would not be surprised if
    you were trying to push in that direction. Still, an English fleet in Eng
    would be most uncomfortable for me, and I would not want him to make a
    supported move there.  If I defend against it, he can move to Wal and
    perhaps block me out of Lon and Lvp in the Fall, which I don't think is
    good for either of us.  Thus, I would hope you could find some other way to
    throw the English tactics into disarray.  In truth, I don't think he's
    buying it anyway.

    Whoo.  My condolences, man.  Sorry to hear it.
    
    In any case, I hear you're moving against Scandinavia.  I suppose
    that's understandable, in light of the Russian actions there these
    past few years.
    
    Anyway, no need to reply to this; I don't want to increase your
    response load any more than it has to be.
    
    Good luck on your maneuvers.

    Oh cut it out. "Give me a reason." We tried that already, I gave you a
    reason, you agreed, but you cut me out of Norway.
    
    I have no secret perspective on the game that you lack. All the reasons for
    you to attack Russia instead of me, we have already discussed. And you
    agreed with me about them. All the reasons for you to attack France instead
    of me are extremely obvious.
    
    If you aren't going to deal, at least say so.

    Understood.  I appreciate the insight into England's plans.

    Well, the options re: Nth and Nwy would be nice but I have *not* been
    encouraging England to go to Eng.  It's aparent from what he's been urging
    you to do and what he claims I've been urging him to do that his goal is to
    try to find a way to drive a wedge between us before we eliminate him.  I
    can see no good reason why I should fall prey to that and I hope that you
    won't either.
    
    I expect notying from England excepot treachery, so you needn't worry about
    me working with him.  My plans are the same as we previously dicussed.

    I know you think that I'm just spouting verbiage to string you along but
    I'm really not (No, *really*).
    
    I don't deny that I've lied to you.  You've done the same to me.  That's
    Dip.  It doesn't mean that we will *always* lie to each other and it
    certainly doesn'y mean that we should stop talking.
    
    I am _always_ willing to deal.
    
    I just need to see that the deal, in toto, is my overall bst interests.  So
    far, you haven't given me one that is and I haven't found one on my own.
    It may be extremely obvious to ytou why I should attack France or Russia
    instead of you but it's not to me.  The fact that you consider it so
    apparent makes me wonder what I'm missing and that's why I keep asking for
    you to sell me on the idea.
    
    Of course, the fact that the only responses I get contain no plans of
    substance makes me think that you're the one who's doing the stringing along.

    Well, I suppose that's fair enough but, frankly, it seems to me that *you*
    should be the one who is trying to convince me that I have a good reason to
    attack France, not vice versa.  I can be swayed but only if you show me how
    my interests are better with you than with him (as he did a few moves ago...)
    
    >You don't seem to be in a particularly good position, considering.
    >Dislodging Russia from Sweden is pretty risky.
    
    I neither need to do this nor intend to.  Russia is still my ally.  My move
    to Nwy was only to bounce you since I knew he was vacating it.
    
    >I won't let you into North Sea.
    
    At least, you won't while you a stop me...
    
    >And your attacking prospects vs. France are not great, either, though
    >they could be great if France goes all out against me.
    
    Again, you're assuming taht I intend or desire to attack France.  I'm
    always willing to consider any options but I'd need to know that I could
    reasonably trust you in order to do this.  Your recent rhetoric is not
    encouraging.
    
    >Well, it will be interesting to see how this plays out. I may still have a
    >chance if you let me have one. Otherwise I'll just have to decide which of

    I stabbed you becuase I felt that you were setting me up for a stab.  Maybe
    I was wrong, maybe not.  In any event, I really don't want to see any power
    eliminated from the game.  I'm willing to conisder working with you (and
    helping you survive) but you've got to give me some reasons to do so.

    Well, maybe, maybe not.  All I know is that he has consistently told me
    that he wants to go after you as payabck for you taking Nwy and that he has
    acted on those statements.  He *may* be irritated enough at me now to
    change that but I still think that he'll grab Nwy first chance he gets.
    
    >Part of my paranoia was your move to Den this turn (although entirely
    >understandable, I realize, given recent E and R actions).
    
    I should hope so!  If I hadn't covered DEN, England could have walked right
    in from NTH.  I couldn't be sure that he wouldn't do that, so I had to
    cover it.  I'm surprised that you'd even mention it since it was such an
    obvious move on my part.
    
    >I tend to get
    >flustered when beset upon by large coalitions (despite your anti-F
    >worries, that situation has *not* been done to you this game).
    
    Not yet, anyway.  Your recent cozying up to England has worried me,
    however, and makes me even more concerned about France.
    
    >I sincerely hope you don't stab me, a la BirSauron's wishes.  Edi tends
    >to yelp loudest when he's beset upon, and this thing may -- may --

    OK with me.  I'll say it again - I moved last turn to prop you up so *you*
    could deal successfully with AT, leaving me to deal with E and avoid
    unnecessary exposure to F.
    
    >As for the north:  we can do a variety of things, if you're interested:
    >- You retaking Nth (thus tying down Nwg and nth) while I retry for Nwy;
    
    I'd love to take Nth but it's not going to happen until you get Swe back to
    Nwy.  England has 3 fleets to hold Nth if he so desires.
    
    >- Me moving to nwy, supported by  Ska;
    
    You retake Nwy for sure but why not use STP in support while I use Ska to
    cut Nth support?  That also gives me a chance to take Nth if England gets
    cute with F Lon.
    
    >In the West, I honestly don't see your concern over France.  Seems to me
    >you two have arranged a nice, slow, phased withdrawal, with you "backing

    <sigh>  Of *course* we have a deal.  My concern is not that he's going to
    drop off England and come after me hell-bent for leather.  It would be
    stupid of him to not take Lvp.  My concern is that he comes after me as
    soon a she takes Lvp (and uses the build to my disadvantage).  I'm sure you
    can see that.
    
    >But please please please, don't mistake my poorly-worded letters for

    That's my hope.  So long as we continue to hold share a friendly border, we
    can also continue to hold and make progress on our respective fronts.  I'm
    not asking you to abandon the east to help me in the west; please don't ask
    it if me either.  At least, not right now.

    Doge
    
    Greetings!  What do you think we should do this season?  Do you think
    Hohn is 'with" you down south?  On the one hand, a BEAUTY of a move would
    be Bul(sc) S Apu-Gre (ION C) while he simultaneously uses Ukr-Rum (Bla
    and Sev S).  Edi would lose 40% of his land in one swoop!
    
    On the "dark side," I could see where they might try and spoof you:
    Bul-Aeg(Gre S), Smy-Eas, thus forcing you to either defned TRi with Adr
    in fall (and lose ION), or defend ION in fall (and probably lose Tri).
    It's a hard call, this trusting of Hohn....
    
    Which brings me to MY part:
    
    (1) Do I trust Turkey and move StP-Nwy, and War-Gal?
    
    (2) Regarding BOH:  should we use it for Vienna this turn (Tri S),
    knowing that Alb-Tri will doubtless cut support?  Or do I use the spring
    turn to order Gal-War (BOH S)?  (Possible even the other way around, i.e,
    Boh-Gal, War S; this option, coupled with Mos-Ukr, would ensure no A/T
    funny business would take WAR this turn.
    
    Decisions, decisions....I would indeed like to hear your views on this,
    my friend.  It's getting close to submission time.
    
    PS)  Dont think I reset my address to here, so if you send it to the

    Sheesh.
    
    We already discussed Russia. You can get more centers from him than from
    me, and faster. You agreed that this is so.
    
    As for France, you will have to face off against him sooner or later. You 2
    will be the 2 northern powers in the endgame. You can wait until he's
    swallowed two of my three centers, or you can do it now while he's chained
    to an English attack (and you've got a bulkhead in Burg.).

    Hello Pitt
    
    Thanks for the note.  Glad to see we can still remain "status quo!"
    
    The North sounds good.  Much of what I do is based on what Hohn and/or
    Edi are planning (Edi wants me to go to SIL and PRU as part of a
    disengagement deal (hahahahahaha) and Hohn seems to be "making nice" to
    me...when they both do that at once, then the full-scale assault is
    coming.
    
    The Northern suggestions look good.  Do what you want with Ska, and
    hopefully send DEN westward, and I'll worry about Nwy.
    
    As for asking you to come east for help:  no problem, I won't ask
    anymore.  I had thought you were concerned about AT, which was the
    reason I asked for one guy (Mun) in Tyo/Sil to help crush Edi
    --especially when France is least threatening to you in the Mun region.
    But if you have that much 'confidence' in my ability to keep a
    rapidly-collapsing flank together while fretting that a post-Lvp grab by
    France might equate into a hostile motif vs you, then I admire your
    confidence in my abilities....
    Hopefully I can hold both War and Mos this turn, with a little gambling.
     I think I might forego the Vie attack and instead hit GAL; if I make it
    there in spring, I can threaten Vie and/or Bud come fall.
    
    Good luck in the West; I should think you and France can take down a
    3-center England fairly quickly..about as quickly as AT are taking me
    down -grin-.

    I'd prefer to support you to Vie, so as to make sure Edi loses SOMETHING
    (Vie or Alb).  That will give us leverage on him for the Fall.

    Well, this turn could be a make-or-break; many rumors and impending moves
    on the horizon...
    
     Turkey says he's ready to stab Austria; at last!  Of course, it's
    completely on HIS terms (grumble, grouse...) but if he does it, at least
    it will have occured....which is more optimistic than the current AT
    troubles I'm having.  If he works with Italy and supports to GRE, Edi
    could lose Rum and Gre this turn.   Even if he goes solo, that's fine.
    He's to abandon UKR and we do a joint number westward.   Now, with him
    saying this (after years of fibs), coupled with Austria's siren song
    ("leave Boh and let's make final peace"), I half-expect a renewed crunch
    vs me.
    
    Turkey has more to gain by continuing to attack me, than by gaining from
    Edi.  If he and Austria hit War or Mos this turn, I'm a goner.  But there
    are threats everywhere, and the alternative is slow death--so why NOT get
    daring?!
    
    Italy is to support me to Vie, although I expect cut support from Alb.
    Still, with our planned moves, Edi either loses Vie or Alb, and Italy's
    one more step closer to Edi's door.  My hope  is that AT don't lure him
    out of mutually supporting positions and then make a fleet/land run
    against him.    Edi could be in for a tough time...we'll see.   Cal has
    to concern himself with France, too, but for the time being, he seems
    safe.
    
    F/G have an arrangement, as seems obvious.  Germany claims fear of
    France, hence "no eastward support for me."  That's hogwash, but I can't
    call him on it.   I'm hoping he doesn't snag SWE behind me this turn, but
    again, I can't do much about it.  There are reports of E/G (!!) teaming
    plans against me in Scandinavia.
    
    England claims he's after HEL and NTH this turn, but I'll believe it when
    I see it.  France remains a big enigma (other than the blantant grab of
    Lvp), and the whole board seems unsettled.  Much will be made obvious
    this season, or this year for sure.  I don't think I'll be holding my
    five at the end of the year, unfortunately.

    Hi Hohn
    Just a last-minute note from home; our work system's been down since 0900
    this morning, so I have no way of reading who sent what.
    
    If indeed you're sincere about hitting Edi, I'd recommend Apu-Gre (Bul
    S), Smy-Aeg, Ukr-Rum (Sev & Bla S).  This annihilated Edi's fleet, allows
    you and Cal to sweep up the 'boot' from GRE, and also gives you leeway to
    boot  out Cal in the near future, should you dislike the long-term
    arrangement.
    
    For me, I'm going to play it conservative this turn, as announced.  But
    there may be a twist:  Boh-Gal.  In addition to rotecting WAR -- "just in
    case" you don't break with Austria -- it allows *us* a very good position
    on not just Vie, but BUD, come fall, after the smoke clears!
    
    I'll stay out of UKR, to prevent any unease on your part, and allow Mos
    and StP to play guard duty.
    
    If this works, Hohn, you've got a loyal ally for as long as you want one!
     Good hunting, regardless.

    Hi, John, I note that I haven't heard much of any thoughts from you
    on the progress of the game.  I note it especially because of my
    relative surprise at your current submitted moves.  I don't think
    I need to say any more since you know I've been monitoring your messages
    to England and Germany.
    
    I do wish you would share some thoughts at this juncture on the progress
    of the game.  In particular, before it gets too far away, your
    thoughts on your "comeback".
    
    To my mind, you are showing yourself to be a truly expert E-Mail
    player and a great balance to the point of having people with
    different styles interact.
    
    Thanks, no rush, just when you get a chance, Jim

    Yes, Mark, lots will be told this season.  I know all, see all,
    tell nothing.... well, almost nothing:
    
    By the way, I note that last I checked (a couple of hours ago)
    you did not have your orders in.  Just checking to make sure your
    "system crash" didn't affect your order submission.

    Thanks for the note.  It proved very helpful.  Sorry I haven't
    responded lately; I've been swamped, and again, I haven't had time to
    write anyone.  I have just fielded a productive phone call, though.
    See below.

    I have just gotten off the phone with Cal.  We like your APU-GRE idea,
    and will implement it.  With ADR-ALB to cut any possible support, it's
    a guaranteed attack unless Edi moves RUM-BUL...which I doubt.

    OK, I'm going to go out on a limb here.  UKR-RUM, SEV S UKR-RUM, BLA S
    UKR-RUM seems like a waste, and inefficient.
    
    If you get this note in time, how about SEV-RUM, BLA S SEV-RUM, and
    UKR support an attack of yours to GAL, or alternatively, you support
    UKR-GAL?  That will truly seal his fate, and I'd expect him to
    evaporate down two perhaps two centers by the end of the year.
    
    Let me know.  I'll check my mail right before deadline, and will issue
    appropriate orders if I see a response/confirmation from you.  Since
    there may not be time for me to respond to your response, just tell me
    what you'd prefer, UKR-GAL, or UKR support a move of yours.  I will
    move accordingly.

    Sure, it's complicated. Lot of options.
    
    I will certainly consider hel-kie to cut kie - mun (i already brought that
    up, remember?). i do think we also ought to consider nwy-swe, hel s
    nth-den. And there is France to consider, he may ask for my support into
    Bel in exchange for, well, attacking Germany in Bel, of course.

    Sorry for the multitude of disjointed quickie notes; am filling in the
    map (at last) and looking over options.
    
    Can we consider (as one of many ideas):   Nth-Den (Hel S), Lon-Nth?  I
    then go Nwy-Swe.
    
    In the south, I retreat to SIL and we threaten ber and/or Mun on Pitt.
    
    The reasoning here is NOT to weasel out of giving you Nwy; it's yours if
    you want it.  Having said that, Germany cannot defend everywhere.  if we
    threaten Den, he has to probably bounce you by swe-Den (Bal S), which
    means it's a crap shoot as to whether he defends Ber from my retreated
    Sil, or whether he uses Kiel to defend vs my attack on MUN.
    
    heck, it's all a crap shoot, it seems!
    
    The "logical" thing is for me to retreat War-Liv, and then defend Mos
    with three -- praying all the while that Pitt doesn't use Bal-Lvn to cut
    support and give Mos to Hohn.
    
    Man, the more I look at this, the bigger headache I get.  Ideas?
    
    Again, DON'T take the above to mean I'm waffling on Nwy.  If I give you
    Nwy, I'm probably on a rapid flame-out toward suicide.  if I keep Nwy
    and put you into Den, we both stand to remain solvent, albeit at more
    risk to you....    Anyway, Nwy's there if you want it.

    GKJ,
    Am mulling my retreat options, i.e., lose MOS for Sil and anti-German
    options.
    
    If I do the SIL retreat, can we consider Hel-Kie to cut a support?  I
    could then do Boh-Mun (Sil S), and hope Edi doesn't come out of WAR to
    cut it.

    Hi Cal
    Sigh...there's no use saying "I told you so," because I wanted to believe
    it, too.  Hohn pretty much let out that this has been a game-long
    conspiracy with Edi, so I'm assuming anything he says (as opposed to
    does) is so much pap.  I'm trying to stay in touch, pointing out that
    (unless they have a prearranged deal this turn), Edi stands to get TRI
    and WAR, where Hohn gets zero.  Who knows, maybe they'll trade off....
    
    Have also gotten angry with Germany, who stabbed me for no reason --
    unless he's no in cahoots with AT.  He can't spare one army for the east,
    but he can spare two fleets for my centers...
    
    As such, here's my intent:
    
    retreat to SIL.
    
    Sil then used either anti-germany (Sil/Boh vs Mun, or Sil-Ber, and Vie S
    Tri-Vie!), or
    anti-AT  (Sil S Mos-War, StP-Mos).
    
    The way I see it, they suckered us both good.  You can either defend TRI
    this turn (assuming I help you and/or you guess correctly by Ion-Alb to
    cut support), or you can hold Ion and lose TRI.
    
    As such, I at least offer you support of BOH S TRI-VIE.
    I don't know how well it works, because even if you get it (and cover
    with Apu-ven), then Edi retreats to Tyo and has Tri/Tyo vs VEN next turn
    (forcing you to hit Tri with Adr and risking Ion!).    the alternative,
    however, is to guess right in defending Tri, lose ION, and then have Edi
    build at least one, possibly two.  Shudder...
    
    You may need to ask France to move Mar-Pie and build F lyo next turn,
    much as I hate to say it.....
    
    Anyway, I'm dealing with Jamie, have written all players (including my
    tormentors) and refuse to give up hope.  Time will tell.   Just let me
    know if you want support to Vienna,  plan on holding 9AND RETREATING TO
    SERBIA?), etc....

<p><a name=81></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font>:</b><pre>
    (St petersburg)  In the dimly-lit, semi-deserted War Chancellery, Tsar
    Faz held yet another press conference, albeit in a more somber tone
    compared to last season's proclamation.
    
    "Once again," the Tsar began, "We trusted those whom we assumed would
    show flexibility, or those whom had earlier pledged alliance and
    nonaggression.  The season opened with great potential:  German-Russian
    forces prepared to face the AT foe; the chance for dissension within the
    AT hordes; and great potential in the balkans.   Instead, the Forces of
    Darkness lied through their teeth (again, for the upmpteenth time) and
    we--rather I, your Gullible Tsar--fell for their honey-coated words.   No
    one is to blame for Russia's dismal situation save I.
    
    What now for the course of future relations?  We are in a sea of actors,
    all with their roles to play:
    - Best Balancing Act:  France, for sitting astride  a fence for the
    entire game and maintaining his own internal equilibrium.
    - Optimist Boy of the Month Award:  Turkey, for seeing potential in RT
    cooperation in 1902; and 1903, and 1904...and...well, anyway, he is our
    multiple winner.
    - Rasputin Award:  For living through death repeatedly and emerging,
    plague-like, the hands-down winner is Austria.  Morris the Cat would be
    hard-pressed to equal his near-death experiences and yet emerge
    unscathed.    Would that we Russians could do as well!
    - Self-Fulfilling Prophet Award:  Germany, for seeing shadows where none
    existed, for making shadows where none were needed, and for helping open
    the AT sluice gates that much quicker...
    - Head-Banger Award:  Italy, with a flat forehead after repeatedly trying
    to force a result in Austria, and facing frustration due to perfidy.
    (NoteZ  Italy also is a co-winner, with we Russians, of the Zebco Rod and
    Reel Award, for being lured, reeled in, and gutted by the AT sportsmen.)
    - The Farragut Award:   England, for his 'damn the torpedos' atttidue and
    boldly charging  into a hail of Tuetonic steel, even as France shivs him
    in the back.
    - And we Russians?  Besides sharing the fish award with Italy, we
    classify for the PT Barnum Award; "...There's a sucker born every
    minute."
    
    This leaves us with the obvious question:  whither Russian foreign
    policy?  Beset upon from three sides by foes, and with only enough troops
    for one true battle front, it now comes down to a roll of the die as to
    whom gets our attention, and who gets an easy gain.  It's a sad day for
    Russia, my followers.  Nonetheless, I shall remain in the War Room and
    face the approaching foes.  For you, I say the French phrase, "Sauve que
    puit."  That is the French phrase, isn't it?"  (or is it the second
    person plural with optional genitivie declension, GKJ?)
    
    With that,Tsar Faz shuffled out of the Chancellery, a broken man, with
    only one thing on his mind:  small-scale revenge against those who have
    sullied Russia's reputation and her loyal troops.  There is literally
    nothing else to do when options have run out.
    
    Curse BirSauron and Hohn the Forked-Tongue!  A plague upon rulers with
    names ending in **it!  A pox on those who refuse to face the AT before it
    reaches their borders....a...ah, what's the use...

    I see it like this. France either (a) has to face off against Germany in
    the next few years, or (b) plans to stick with G into the endgame. If (b),
    we're out of luck. But to my mind that is an unrealistic hope for France.
    What worries me is that Germany apparently voluntarily left Burg of his own
    free will.
    But if (a), then this looks like the best opportunity for France to strike.
    Else Germany builds and very likely prospers (at our expense). France must
    see this. Will he trust Pitt???

    Oh no, not at all. To the contrary. If he's fighting Edi, Cal gets a little
    bigger, and France stops worrying about the unstoppable A-T. Hohn could get
    at least one western friend that way and plan to go with that friend to the
    finish. The danger of stalemate is rather if he and Edi overrun Italy,
    *forcing* the remaining powers to make peace and bottle the western Med.
    
    Well, we shall see.

    My problem was that I just couldn't get over our 1901 interactions.  I
    know you showed good faith later on.  But I still couldn't get over
    it, not when there was no compelling reason for me to do so.  Edi's
    planted seeds of you as an unreliable ally found fertile ground in me,
    I'm afraid.
    
    But as you say, it is just a game, and I certainly wish you well in
    your other endeavors.

    Dear Witch,
    
    I keep telling people what to do, but they never listen. If Pitt just did
    what I said, he'd be dominating the north. If Russia did what I said (given
    that Pitt didn't), he'd at least be in the game. If France did what I said
    (nad the others ignored me), he'd be bearing down on Germany.
    
    If *anyone* had listened, I'd be in position to play a real endgame role.

    ** Yes.  But in retrospect, my position could have been SO much better

    Pitt hadn't given me a reason to suspect him before this, and could

    Curses. If only you'd decided to take Burg, I'd have very happily gotten
    Belgium for you.
    
    Do you want to try for it anyway? We'd have to discuss it, but I'm receptive.
    
    I think the Italian move Nap-Tyn was defensive. But you probably know
    better than I.

    Ok.
    
    It's just that your position could have been SO much better if only you'd
    done the obvious and sensible thing, StP-Nwy and Swe-Bal. But though I have
    never given you even the tiniest reason to mistrust me, you spent two of
    your dwindling resources covering against a fantasy stab. And although
    every power on the board (practically) was urging me to take Nwy, I again
    trusted you, and you trusted Germany instead of me.
    
    If you are really willing to support me to Norway, I'll accept this time. I
    expect France to take Lvp, and this way I could still have some influence
    and chances. You can order Nwy-Bar, Stp S Nth-Nwy (planning to disband the
    F Bar).
    
    If you change your mind and don't feel so generous, let me know.

    GKJ, Great timing, your note following mine.  I'm now seven shades of
    red, but not from embarssed discovery -- more for the fact that you
    imply I somehow let you down again.
    
    Yes, I listened to Germany, but he could've used two on me anyway and
    taken the place.  (Granted, it would've allowed me a better retreat...)
    But I didn't want to leave StP, because of the risk involved if they
    took War after lying to us; as is noted here.
    
    Heck, Jamie, I don't know what's up and down anymore.  I thought by
    staying in StP I could have a land defense of my northern empire, while
    still trying to outguess Pitt if he tried for Nwy.  It wasn't designed
    to launch an attack on you; please don't believe that if you're
    currently thinking it.
    
    Bottom line:  it was a dumb move in retrospect, but one that was made in
    trying to cover two flanks with forces enough for only one.  I made a
    major goof.
    
    Please bear with me on this one.  I'll support you to Nwy if possible
    and desired.  What the heck, I'm gonna die anyway....you may as well get
    Nwy after lo, these many years.
    
    Still an ally, honest.

    Well, guys, I knew I shouldn't have crowed so much about keeping 5 last
    season.
    
    In the south, my worst fears came true:  we trusted Hohn for one last
    time, and it proved my undoing.  (I KNEW I should've hit Ukr this turn;
    damn!)   In the north, I probably should have moved StP-Nwy (Swe S), but
    nooo, I figured Germany would be occupied with Jamie; wrong again.
    
    I'm screwed, esepcially now that Germany's in the VultureFest against
    me.   AT suckered Cal and I, and I'm not sure I can do anything, except:
    (a) retreat to Lvn and defend Mos -- HOPING that Pitt doesn't cut its
    support!  or
    (b) retreat to Sil, use Boh/Sil vs Mun, or somehow tie down stuff so
    Jamie can hit Den/Kie.
    (In that regard, Nwy-Swe cuts Swedish support, while I go for Mun, and
    then we possibly get one or the other.)
    (c) SUPPORT ENGLAND TO NORWAY?
    
    Truthfully, these are the initial 'reads" of the map; I haven't digested
    the options fully (we have visiting Norwegians coming in 30 mins, so I'm
    out until 2:15 today).   Guys, I'd REALLY appreciate your insights and
    recommendations on this one, to help me look less like the dufus that I
    am.  The retreats are due tonight, and I want to make sure I help you
    guys as best as I can.

    Hi Pitt
    Well, looks like my grovelling wasn't sufficient after all.  Either
    that, or you're the vulture Edi makes you out to be, going for the
    quickie center.  Oh well, it's all moot at this point.   I trusted you
    and Hohn--you because I saw no need not to, Hohn because this turn
    could've been the big hit on Austria.  In reality, it's the big hit on
    me.   The board will rapidly devolve to FG vs AT, with any switchings
    that will doubtless occur.   Well played on your part.
    
    I haven't reviewed the board yet, but I'll have to weigh who gets the
    lion's share of my death and who doesn't.   You'll probably get the nod,
    as you've screwed me less than they....
    
    It's funny...You wouldn't send one army east to help stop AT from
    plundering me, but you found the time to send two fleets to aid them in
    their carving.  Ah, life's ironies.....

    Dear Edi,
    
    If Pitt had seemed even the slightest bit friendly, I'd have gone for
    Norway and StP and tried to become a renegade house. Left with virtually no
    choice at all, I had to trust France.
    
    I don't know what Faz thinks he's doing. As far as I can tell, Pitt
    convinced him that he'd better cover Norway lest I sneak in. Mark doesn't
    seem to have a lot of sense about these things.
    
    Cheers!

    I just don't understand where you expect to get centres from in the next
    few years?  Edi already has War and will likely be the one to get Ven
    and Rom.  You think you'll be satisfied with Tun & Nap?  Even if you
    are,
    how much room for expansion do you have?  One small corridor leading to
    St Pete and the Med where it's an even longer, harder road to your next
    build.  Meanwhile, Edi is going to be up around 10 centres with you
    stretched out from Turkey to Spain. You KNOW this isn't going to work
    long term.  Why not attack him now when you have a willing ally to help?
    My fleets need not bother you as you can see I moved F Nap - Tyn to show
    sincerity.  In fact, my moves were EXACTLY as advertised.  My intentions
    should be clear now.

    No problem talking.  That's what the game is about, no? :)
    
    As for proposals, my offer to help you against the Birsauron still
    stands.
    The only difference is that you have to hit him first.  I don't have
    enough units to defend myself and make speculative moves against
    Austria.
    
    Your call.  You know you have to do it eventually and you won't be able
    to
    handle a 10 centre Austria.

    Hohn
    Yeah, for what it's worth, I have given up on you.  "Game mechanics" or
    not, I really laugh (bitterly) when you rake me over the coals for my
    1901 "indignities" and then proceed to bald-face lie to me the rest of
    the game.   Yes, it's just a game, and YES, you probably did do 'the
    right thing' for Turkey...but it's still a bitter pill to swallow.
    
    As for the last-minute "didn't hear from you, made the judgment call"
    part:  again, completely understandable, to a point.  I've been writing
    every third day or so (granted, nothing much, but still corresponding),
    and I know Cal's done the same.  To use a last-minute non-response from
    me  -- when my system was down AND when _you_ were only responding to
    folks at the 11th hour -- as the final "coin flip" to determine your
    stance, is a bit stretching in the credibility department.  Either that,
    or you and Edi were just stringing us along all the while--as I told Cal
    would probably be the final result.
    
    Regardless, what's done is done.  In addition to being disappointed, I'm
    also dead now.  I only hope Germany has better luck in not falling for
    your sweet talk, and in defending vs AT.
    
    Never let it be said you guys aren't good....I do admire your play,
    Hohn, I really do.   I just wish you would've switched sides this turn
    (obviously).  Ah well, c'est la vie; it's the game.

    Hohn,
    
    Many, manyb apologies.  I didn't read your note until this morning (the
    SET ADDRESS was still to my work station; dumb!).  I decided to try for
    Vienna, only because Cal really was insistent that I do so, as "this
    ensures Edi loses either ALB or Vie."  (Again, this was a decision he
    and I agreed to before the system crashed and we really firmed anything
    up.  Hopefully this wasn't too disabling.
    
    I APPRECIATE your moves (will read the results shortly), and hope this
    signals a long and productive alliance.

<p><a name=102></a><b>Private message from <font color=bbbb00>Turkey</font> to <font color=000000>Master</font>:</b><pre>
    Jim,
    
    Well, that went quite well.  I suppose I'm 2-1 with respect to
    guessing.  Edi and I had devised a more conservative plan originally,
    but as a result of Cal's phone call to me (and the corresponding
    information Cal gave me, and my judgment of its credibility), I
    decided to push for a riskier plan.  Happily, it worked.  What's more,
    the original plan would not have taken MOS.  I'm feeling quite pleased
    right now.
    
    I think I've probably burned any and all goodwill with Mark and Cal
    (particularly Mark; I'm still holding out hope that I might be able to
    negotiate with Cal at some future date), but I think Edi and I will be
    able to make slow and gradual progress now, whereas before it was much
    more in doubt.  Again, my rationale for sticking with Edi is twofold.
    For one, he's been a trustworthy and loyal ally so far; Mark and Cal
    have both lied to me (Mark much more so than Cal), and I'm leery of
    them both.  For two, any Turk should be delighted to have a strong
    alliance with any Austrian.  That fact alone should have made Cal and
    Mark realize they'd have an uphill battle convincing me to side with
    them, IMO.
    
    There's actually also a third reason, namely that my press to Cal just
    now indicating that I was uncomfortable with there being three Italian
    fleets is very true.
    
    At this point, I'm going to suggest to Edi that I take the extra
    build, perhaps by moving BLA-RUM or something.  The reasoning is that
    he won't be able to use it, since I don't think he'll have a home
    center open.  For security's sake, I wouldn't mind another army, but I
    think that Edi will push me to build a fleet.  We'll see.
    
    Looking at the general board situation, I'm starting to feel
    relatively comfortable and safe.  Of course, that's often the most
    dangerous time, since that's when people get complacent, and that's
    also when people begin to look at you as a threat.  If things continue
    shaping up the way they have been (Pitt not being overtly hostile to
    Edi, relative chaos in the west, Mark being whittled down in both the
    south and the north), I think I'll soon be in position to grab at
    least part of a draw.  And I hope I didn't just jinx myself. ;)

    I'm very uncomfortable with three Italian fleets, and I decided at the

    either.  If it's any consolation, it was a very close and difficult

    I really don't think there will be a problem with Mark.  He has promised
    to help me "until the end" and his actions thus far have borne that out.
    I think if you promise to let him keep a couple of centres, he'll be
    more
    than happy to work with us as a puppet against the terrible twosome.
    After all, Edi and Hohn are far more responsible for his demise than you
    or England.
    
    As for France, well, you know more than I do.  He hasn't been the most
    communicative of players thus far (at least not in this direction - I
    suppose the same could be said about me vis a vis you, although my
    total letters written this game stands at almost 200) so we don't really
    have that much of a game relationship.  He did offer a couple of years
    ago
    to send a fleet to the Med to help me out vs Turkey and I gently
    refused.
    I wrote him last night about perhaps doing the same thing now and
    haven't
    had a reply yet.  If he does send an army and a fleet south, that would
    probably make you more comfortable about doing the same, no?  Maybe if
    you two work out something to take England out, that would be one less
    factor to worry about.
    
    Anyway, let me your thoughts on the matter and I'll write Mark.  Maybe
    you
    can do the same and we can ALL set out (minus England?) to stop the
    greatest threat to Western Civilization since the invention of
    television...
