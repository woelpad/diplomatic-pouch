    Yes, there is NO other way to say it, I have to agree.  I saw all
    of the messages and so (despite SOME judge difficulties) I didn't
    feel that "pushing" people to get orders in was out of line on my
    part.  I'm assuming you're just venting (which is QUITE alright)
    and not faulting me for not giving you enough time.

    Are you referring to his trip out of town, or his moves to North Sea
    and Baltic ;-)  You are aware he won't be back at his computer until
    Monday.  I am inclined to ask for a delay (to Wednesday?  Tuesday?),
    but Jamie was somewhat explicit to me about wanting to avoid a delay
    if possible.  What do you think?

    I understand your concern and trust that you understand my message as one
    written to an expert Diplomacy player with whom I need not pretend does
    not understand "what's up".  We shall see.  Diplomacy is a strange game.

    I would rather not do so, so it would take a unanimous vote which
    could not even take place until Monday since Jamie is away.
    This is supposed to be a "test of Judge Diplomacy" with expert
    players after all ;-)  I view the technology as part of the test.

    I will repeat that I am ***MORE THAN WILLING*** to help anyone make sure
    that the orders they wish to send are being registered properly to the
    Judge.  Since Cal mentioned it, he can verify that I was E-Mailing him
    about the error flag directly to see if I could help.
    
    As far as losing vital correspondence, for myself, what I do is CC
    a message to the Judge to myself and then if I don't get back the
    verification in short order, I can send it directly.  As I think you
    all know, Edi has been cautious and sending many messages directly
    to correspondents since early in the game.  Again, if you do that,
    please just CC me (burgess@world.std.com) as well.
    
    I also would like to go on record as saying that even if it is
    past the deadline, if you sent a message BEFORE the deadline
    that the Judge didn't process, forwarding it to the desired
    parties by direct E-Mail is acceptable and does not constitute
    "negotiating after the deadline".  The time stamp on the original
    E-Mail (that you will send to me as a CC, of course) will verify
    that to me.  I trust that is acceptable to all of you.

    I oppose hand adjudication.  I agree that using the technology is part of
    the demo aspect of this game.  I've been burned by judge failures, but I
    can take care of that with a little effort - sending directly to email
    addresses, as you suggested.

    Not I, I'm afraid.  While I sympathize with Cal's problems with the judge
    last turn (I suffered a bit of the same myself), I still think that the
    ease of communication and adjudication afforded by email and judge play far
    outweighs the occassional problem with the judge.

    I believe in making such "votes" secret, so if Cal goes on to demand
    a formal vote, the proposal will be rejected and I will announce
    neither vote totals nor identities of voters, just that the proposal
    failed.  Ifeel that to do otherwise injects the vote into the game.

    Absolutely.  But the "error flag" you asked me about was for an order
    that was in correctly!  I got the flag from the Judge regarding my order
    of f tun s f ion-tyn (it doesn't like "tyn").  You mentioned that you
    had seen a flag about the move to tyrolia (it doesn't like tyo either,
    but I didn't use that).
    
    And I really hope, Jim, that you don't take anything I've said as
    criticism of you or your efforts.  To me, you've gotten A+ as GM of this
    game.

    That's what I shall do in the future if we continue using the Judge.

    Thanks.  Are you requesting that I officially poll the players on
    this question?  I have not yet done so and obviously I cannot collect
    Jamie's input until he returns, so I think everyone should assume
    the next season for sure will be conducted as normal, although we
    hope normal does not include Judge problems.

    No, because, if you don't submit your orders, the Judge will still
    accept changes from other powers as well.  Do I have to spell it out
    in complete detail?  As an abbreviated further explanation, you could
    forward your letter on, written before the deadline, but not delivered,
    and the power you send the letter to could read it and decide to change
    their orders and do so.  They would NOT have the luxury of continuing
    the negotiation.  Still, my perception was that addressed at least
    part of your problem.

    I thought I already did this by spelling Tyrrhenian out completely.  I

    ordered correctly.  I'll try again, but this program is f&^%ed.

    Beats the hell out of me, I never managed to figure it out.
    You would think that "get syntax" (for order writing) would tell you
    what you wanted to know, but it doesn't.  I am sympathetic with you.
    I had a devil of a time in the first ghods game getting orders in
    correctly too.  As I said, if you're having problems, though, I'd
    be happy to work with you on it.  On this, you'll just have to spell
    them out, I guess.  You could post the question on r.g.d and I'm
    sure there would be answers posted in return.

    My ISP, which has been on the whole an excellent service, has been
    giving me some real headaches lately.  I THINK that the recent problems
    I've been blaming on the judge were actually a result of my mail server
    not SENDING the messages out in the first place.  Also, I've been unable
    to get back into r.g.d. for a couple of weeks now.  That's ticking me
    off double because I've been wanting to advertise the new updates to the
    CDO Home Page.  Sigh.

    Is anyone else interested in taking this game to hand-adjudication?
    
    With all due respect to Dave Kleiman who has a quite thankless job, it's
    obvious that the "system" is not up to coping with the demands of a game
    of Diplomacy.  I sent in orders FOUR times last turn before they got
    recognized (admittedly, one set had an error because the Judge doesn't
    know the proper abbreviations for Tyrolia (tyo) or Tyrrhenian (tyr), but
    even then it sent me back an error flag for the province I spelled out
    in full...).  Also, the Judge managed to lose a vital letter which
    accounted for the total lack of coordination between Hohn and I  this
    season past.
    
    I'd like to have this game adjudicated the "old-fashioned" way before
    the quality of play deteriorates any further.

    I am getting really fed up with the Judge program.  I sent you a really
    long detailed letter several days ago and it obviously got lost.  I sent
    in orders four f&^%ing times for this game before it would finally
    recognize them.  I wondered why you hadn't responded but I thought that
    (at least) you'd have a chance to see my letter before the turn
    processed.
    
    Anyway, here's a copy of the letter I sent you.  It should explain my
    moves:

    What I want to do, and what I think this does, is as follows.
    If my F Kie is dislodged, I prefer retreats in this order: to Den, to Ber,
    to Hol, to Hel. Or disband if I have no retreat.
    
    It looks right. One thing I'm not sure of: if I have no retreat, this
    phased order *might* cause an error, and I might get an ERROR flag.
    Probably not. If I do, you know, you can clear it for me, just by signing
    on as England.
    
    Anyway, in the unlikely event that I do have to retreat when I'm away, I'd
    appreciate it if you'd check to see that it's doing what I want. Will you
    do that? If not, I will have to ask for a postponement if the Spring move
    hasn't processed before Ieave.

    Jim,
    
    Hate to ask, but is there any way I can have a two day extension until
    Friday?  It's been hectic at work, it's my birthday on Thursday, I
    have relatives and friends in from out of town, and I haven't had a
    chance to conduct much diplomacy yet.  Please let me know.

    I'll be away next week, I'm afraid, from Mon 28 July to Sat 2 August.
    
    I will see what I can do to avoid having a postponement, but my presence in
    the game is actually increasing! Let's see. Well, yes, there's a fairly
    good chance that I can get in my F1908 movement orders before I go;
    supposing no retreats for me, that would mean at worst a delay of the
    adjustment phase for a day or two. And even for that I could probably send
    in a phased order.

    Hello, it's your friendly deadline extending GM again.   I will be
    away at a conference Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday.  With Jamie not
    coming back until Monday, I was a little uncomfortable with what
    would happen Monday should something requiring my attention happen.
    In the interim, another player has asked me for a one day extension,
    which I will grant.  Thus, the deadline will be Tuesday.  Then when
    I'm back on Wednesday I can deal with whatever I find when I return.
    I hope that is acceptable to everyone.

    I should have known I could count on someone to be late.  Now I have a
    chance to think this over with the map in front of me.
    
    Edi, it seems to me that mun-boh is futile.  Vienna is bound to get
    crunched, so your support for that move does nothing.  I think I can find a
    more productive use for mun, but I still will give you full support for
    tri-ven.
    
    GKJ, I think we are on track.  You have lots of options for f nth, which I

    Have no bitterment at all.  Hell its been a fun and intense game and I like
    that.  Of course I would like it a little more at 3 centers and a bit more at
    5 centers and what not.
    
    There is no winning hand at this point in the game until such time as you
    secure one German center or France an Italian/tunis one.  Then there is a
    winning hand.   personally it looks closer to a potential Turkish victory than
    a French one mainly because of the Italian exposure.

    Well, still nothing from Pitt.
    
    Hohn misunderstood what I asked him, and has apparently been assuming that
    I am now just going to grab what I can from Germany. (I was trying to ask
    him to be the go-between, to suggest a move for me and G in PRESS TO EG.)
    Hohn hasn't heard from Pitt either, he says, so there's no doubt that he'll
    be taking Stp himself (earlier I thought there was some chance he'd try to
    help Germany back in).
    
    I've realized that I made a little error in that last press to you. I
    forgot that you still own Nwy, so that Nwy-Swe, Nwg-Nwy is a stupid move
    for Germany. By the same token, there is not much point in your ordering
    Stp-Nwy.
    
    Now, if it's really true that Turkey and Germany are not communicating,
    then the situation is somewhat different, in that your centers become a lot
    safer. I bet Turkey goes for the elimination of Austria.
    
    What do you think about Kie S Bal-Ber?? With Mun-Sil? Only Den-Kie could
    prevent success. And would you be willing to go all out and also order Hel
    S Nth-Den? We'd have a damned good chance of leaving Pitt with only Edi,
    Nwy, Swe; I could build in London, and maybe you'd let the dislodged F Stp
    go and build something more useful.
    
    You should tell me what you want me to do, in any case, I'll be standing
    by. I'm willing to just do Nth-Edi, or Nth S Bal-Den, or any of the various
    reasonable tries.

    Hohn,
    
    Actually, you misunderstood what I was saying. I was asking you to help me
    coordinate with Germany, not to help me figure out how to destroy him! But,
    since he isn't saying a word, I guess I'm pretty much forced. I guess I'll
    just take Denmark, since I feel I have to have something to compensate for
    Kiel. It leaves my fleets hideously out of position, but it's the only sure
    thing (assuming no Kie S Den! wouldn't that be a surprise).
    
    It's sort of sounding to me like you are about to eliminate Austria. See, I
    told ya you could do it. Timing's right, too, with Italy stuck for a move
    making sure France doesn't snatch Venice.
    
    As to his Archdukeness,

    Well, but you realize that that 'little jibe' was not supposed to be a
    public one at all, right? He was just venting to France a little. Or maybe
    trying to manipulate France.
    
    Oh well.
    
    Listen, if I hear from Pitt before this evening, I still expect to
    cooperate. If not, I would *still* be interested in cooperating with him in
    the future. And if I get a little bit lucky, the time may come soon when
    one of us could support the other into Norway....

    I say go for the homeland; NTH-EDI.  As for BAL, hmm.  Maybe go for
    BER, with France's help?  I think it might actually succeed.

    Yes, but not very useful unless you feel like spending many hours.
    
    The PRESS file is much, much more useful; admittedly imperfect, but I have
    found in the many Newbie games I have mastered that people pick up the

    have incorporated some of the usual introductory features of regular Newbie
    games. I think it didn't because (1) Jim is not highly experienced with the

    Actually a number of people write updates fairly often.  You can

    >Is the person in charge/owns or whatever the source code even listening to

    Well, I cannot comment about any echoes.  The judge programmers get a
    lot of requests/demands and few volunteers to actually write code.
    
    >Can some one grab him by the head and smack him a few times and have him make
    things a little more user friendly?
    
    The help files are worth reading.  They explain the press options
    fully.  Of course, that's not really your complaint.  Your complaint
    is that the commands are counter-intuitive.  And, though I've never
    thought about using '-' as 'to' in press, I have to concede your point.
    But in the eight years I've been using the Judge I've never seen
    this happen before.
    
    >Probably none of the above, because the software is freeware and ultimatly the
    egocentric nature of that can not rise to the demands of the users.  This is

    Well, I, for one, don't really want to pay to play.  Though I concede
    more programming would get done if the program were done commercially,
    the task in question would appear to be sufficiently simple that
    shareware should suffice.  It does pretty well, in my opinion.

    >A quick question: how do you explain F Bal to Pitt and Hohn?  Seems

    I just admitted it was anti-German, and said I did it because Pitt never
    wrote to me last year.
    
    
    >I will lose StP, so how about if I order stp-nwy?  If he moves, I take

    Well, the F Nwy isn't going to give any useful supports. He certainly isn't
    going to have Nwy S Nwg-Nth, since that would force me to retreat into Edi.
    And it wouldn't make sense for him to support his A Den into Sweden.
    
    I guess the question is this. Suppose he does Nwy-Nth, Nwg-Nwy (or Nwy-Swe,
    Nwg-Nwy). Would we rather have him finish in Nwy, or in Nwg? I'm not sure.
    If my F Nth is going to stay there, I would much rather see that German
    fleet in Nwy than in Nwg, since it would mean I could take Edi. On the
    other hand, F Nwy F Swe might be better for a last stand defense than F Nwg
    F Swe. Then again, with Nwy vacant Hohn might be tempted to move in....
    
    I think it's a small matter.

    Quite right.
    Unfortunately, he hasn't said a thing to me since the last move, and in
    fact nothing much since the move before that. So I'm making provisional
    plans on the assumption that he'll be hostile to me.
    
    Edi Birsan has just sent a very cryptic note to all players (and observers)
    but you. I'll fill you in if I ever figure out what he means.
    
    Oh, never mind, it was an error. No doubt he will now send you that
    message, originally intended for just you, but sent instead to everyone but
    you.

    Unfortunately, the SYNTAX file is nowhere near as useful as it should be.
    In particular, it does not explain abbreviations or give enough examples
    of how orders like convoys and supports of foreign powers work.  I
    probably should rewrite them myself, and perhaps I shall some day.

    I know, but I thought I would comment on it.  I admitted (1) up front
    and have ALWAYS been highly cognizant of (2).  What I most would like to
    have is the Judge to send me all ORDER submissions in addition to all
    PRESS.  I really do read all the press (though not always when it is
    received) and I follow up on things as soon as I can.  Although I
    repeatedly tell people to consult me when they are having problems
    with order submissions, the practical fact is they don't.  They get
    frustrated just like I did when I played in the first ghods game.
    What were some of the usual introductory features of regular Newbie
    games?  I thought I was following them: reading all press as it goes
    and trying to troubleshoot problems, start and feed broadcast discussions
    on how the Judge works (like this one), and repeatedly mention that I'm
    available to help with problems (you guys actually do ask me for things
    sometimes, but not as much as you could).

    My apologies to the crew for the last message that went out to everyone but
    France.
    Seems I foolishly tried to once again use the Judge for communication and I
    wrote:
    Press -F
    which seems to mean everyone but France.
    Odd when I write Bur-Mun  it does not mean Burgundy goes to every place except
    Munich,
    but hey who am I to question the logic of a programer.  You got to love those
    guys...who else would have thought of such a weird multiple and opposite uses
    of a dash.
    
    Is the source code of the 'Judge' available?
    Is anyone bothering to make updates and expansions?
    Is the person in charge/owns or whatever the source code even listening to
    anyone else but their own echoes?
    Can some one grab him by the head and smack him a few times and have him make
    things a little more user friendly?
    Probably none of the above, because the software is freeware and ultimatly the
    egocentric nature of that can not rise to the demands of the users.  This is
    one reason that paying for a game and having service oriented companies is
    really the way to go.

    A quick question: how do you explain F Bal to Pitt and Hohn?  Seems
    anti-G to me.
    
    
    I will lose StP, so how about if I order stp-nwy?  If he moves, I take
    nwy, if he doesn't I cut any supports he might give.
    
    
    All this hinges on whether Germany expects your help or your enmity.
    If he thinks you are his ally, you could take edi, or support stp-nwy,
    for instance.  I'll stand by until you hear from the other side.

    Wow, tough position.
    
    Ok, here's what I think.
    
    If I just take Den from Nth, you can support Kiel sufficiently, and
    probably Munich too (unless they get together and guess lucky).
    
    The problem with this is that if Germany gets into North Sea, my fleets are
    out of position and cannot defend London next year. This would be very
    unfortunate for me.
    
    But, if you use your F Hel to help me from Bal into Den, you risk losing
    Kiel to Germany, which is also not so good, since you do need a build at
    this point. (I figure if Turkey kicks you from Stp, you can always disband
    and rebuild.)
    
    A complete analysis looks pretty daunting. My gut feeling is that I should
    try to sail into Sweden, and use the F Nth to go Nth-Den. You could support
    your A Kie from Hel and Mun, and the A Kie could support me into Den.
    
    Then, if I don't get into Den, at least I'm still in Nth; and if I do get
    in and also get Swe, I can build and protect myself. You look to be pretty
    safe in Kiel.
    
    The problem comes if I don't get into Swe. Then I might be stuck with F
    Den, F Bal, which could be ugly if Germany happens to sail Nwy-Nth (but
    this is unlikely, don't you think?). Or, worse for me, I might get neither
    Scand center, and have to disband. But just about any move is risky for me.
    My hunch is that Germany will not order Nwy-Swe, because if it goes your F
    Stp has a retreat into Norway. He might try Nwy-Swe, Den-Swe, but that uses
    up all of his attacking prospects and he has to think he could well lose
    Denmark too.
    
    The first thing I thought of was the simple Nth S Bal-Den. I think Nwg-Nth
    is unlikely, but maybe Nwy-Nth? He would have to be worried that Nwy-Nth
    would succeed, giving you a retreat Stp-Nwy when Hohn knocks you out of Stp.
    
    What's your gut feeling?
    
    
    I have asked Hohn to come up with a plan around Nth and tell me and Pitt
    what to do. If he does that, I'll have a better idea of what my best plan
    is. But I wrote to both Pitt and Hohn and haven't gotten an answer.

    Yes indeed. But I want to register the historical point that it is Eric
    Klien even more than Ken Lowe who is responsible for the NoNMR norm in Judge
    play. And Nick Fitzpatrick is also due a healthy share of the
    responsibility, for making a general rule (exceptions for exceptional cases)
    of counting only NoNMR games in the Hall of Fame records.

    I have been lurking rather than reading lately (actually, ever since the
    extended non-game discussions that began with us rooting for our favorite
    American pro football teams led to a spate of resignations by non-U.S.

    >
    The judge has a NMR setting.  This or any game could be run NMR so that
    civil disorder takes effect when tardiness rears its head.  One difference
    (a major one) between the PBEM hobby and the postal hobby is that in the
    e-mail hobby, NoNMR is the default setting, and you actually have to do
    something special to ask for civil disorder.  In the postal hobby, with
    game deadlines tied as they are to publishing deadlines, all games (that
    I know of) are run using the NMR rule.
    
    The reason I'm broadcasting is because this difference is not, I believe,
    a happenstance.  The creator of the judge and we who have followed
    in the e-mail hobby have subscribed to the core belief that any actual
    person at the helm is better than none, and that replacing an abandoned
    player (no matter how long it may take) with another player is superior to
    CD'ing a power.  As Edi said, the course of this game would have been
    dramatically different if late powers had been declared in CD.  The PBEM'er
    thinks that the game would have been "worse," but of course the PBM'er
    simply thinks that it would have been "normal" (putting words into PBM'ers'
    mouths, aren't I?)

    This is a demonstration game.  We have all been assembled and agreed to
    take part in it as a demonstration.  Moving the game from a judge format to
    a non-judge format would be demonstrating the wrong thing at this point in
    time.
    
    While it is certainly true that given email communication there is no
    difference in the ability of players to communicate with one another
    regardless if the gamne is run by a GM or a machine; however if there is to
    a large scale rebirth of Diplomacy then it must be done with automation in
    place so that the players are not subject to the problems of real life
    judges.  This recent disturbance is of really minor annoyance considering
    the scope of possibilities with real life GM's.
    
    Historically through the game Turkey and Germany have been perpetually late
    in getting orders in and Italy has less than a spottless record on that
    basis.  The course of this game would have been dramatically different if
    there was a GM involved and all the late orders issued were in turn
    converted to civil disorders.
    
    So let's not be so eager to turn our backs on the game's mechanical
    awkwardness at this point.  Lewt us demonstrate the good spirit to continue
    and allow the coders of the Judge to know where and when they have to make
    adjustments so that the expansion of the hobby can be done with Email
    automation.

    I don't really have much of an assessment, that will unfortunately have to
    wait until Monday, when I have the position mapped and also have some time
    to think about it.

    Hi. I'm back, but I won't really have my head back in the game until Monday.
    Oh, Jim's away until Monday anyway.
    
    Well, from what I've seen, I'm with Pitt on the question of ditching the
    Judge. Actually, I don't entirely understand what the problem was. The main
    thing seems to be that the Judge's downtime made AGT late. But I assume we
    aren't just fussing about dedication points, are we?
    
    What was the 'protocol error' that Cal got? Was it from the
    indianapolis.in.us mailer daemon, or from the Judge, or what?

    Then what, for flippin hell, are the abbreviations for Tyrrhenian and
    Tyrolia?
    
    The "official" (in my mind and that of the 1976 IDA Handbook)
    abbreviations are:
    
    Tyrrhenian = tyn
    Tyrolia = tyo
    
    The Judge rejects both of these (at which point I resubmit

    Cal, you snipped off the part of my reply to Jim in which I noted

    to the abbreviations for *commands*, which are in the SYNTAX
    file--I showed you all some of those).

    It doesn't. It accepts "tyn" as an abbreviation for "Tyrrhenian".
    
    Here are two lines from the MAP file.
    
    Tyrolia,               l tyr tyl trl
    Tyrrhenian Sea,        w tys tyrr tyrrhenian tyn tyh
    
    Notably, this file *cannot* be mistaken, as it is the one which the Judge

    Two quick notes of response.... sorry, I'm a bit pressed for time this
    week:
    
    1) Deadlines:  Sorry if there was any confusion.  I did send explicit
    messages out each time I changed the deadline.  I did NOT originally
    make the deadline Wednesday (even though I was out of town and out
    of computer contact on Monday and Tuesday) because when I brought up
    the issue, no one advocated the longer delay.  With the warning that
    I wouldn't be around to talk to, I went ahead and set it to Tuesday.
    The record is clear, you can look it up ;-)
    
    2) Map: Ugh, my fault.  I thought map was about how to make maps out
    of Judge output, since I don't do that and mostly work the map in
    my head (years of hand adjudicating without maps), I've never looked
    at that file.  It does seem that tyo should be an abbreviation for
    Tyrolia..... sorry, Cal, but now you know.
    
    Get those retreats in, I'll bet we all can't wait to get to those
    builds and removals!  Exciting, eh?

    If that's what you want, I'll do the Big Draw Thing. But tell me, please,
    whether you were sincere.
    
    Myself, I would like to see at least one of them eliminated. For instance,
    I now believe Austria could be removed without real danger. Germany
    probably not -- unless Hohn pulls back, or Tunis can be secured by you and
    Cal.
    
    I am more than happy to have Cal share, though.
    
    In any case, I won't do anything to spoil the scheme, and I'll send press

    centers.  I have not changed my view of France's prospects.  I will share
    in a draw.  The only question was how large the draw would be.  It seems to
    me that, despite my effort to reduce the number by one, Germany must
    survive.  I am ready to let all bygones be forgotten.  We must work
    together to prevent Turkey's victory, then declare a draw.

    The MAP file contains the abbreviations, and also what amounts to a graph
    of the board. It's a confusing-looking list. It lists all the adjacencies,
    by sea and by land, of the various spaces. And it's what the Judge uses as
    its board.

    I agree. I must have tried TYO about a dozen times, myself, in games past.

    Yes. I think we are about to see ten centers change hands in one season;
    and eight of them are home centers; and all three of Germany's home centers
    are going to change hands. Unusual, eh?

    Ok, I think I've got the big picture now.
    
    First: you must, of course, retreat A Mun to Kiel, no question about that.
    I can't use the build for it even if I keep it, and you need it to stay
    even.
    
    Second: All of a sudden Turkey is genuinely threatening to win. Do you see
    this? He has 18 centers inside his ring! He owns 13, and there's Trieste,
    Italy, and Tunis.
    
    Were it not for this fact, I would suggest that you let the F Stp go and
    build something at home to defend. But we may have to push Hohn out of Stp
    sometime soon, don't you think? I dunno. Even if he stabs Italy all out
    this year, he can't win right away, but he could strangle poor Cal by
    taking Tri and Nap or Tun, and you'd have to try to hold Ven for Edi to
    prevent Turkish victory in 1910. (I wish you'd sent that F Wes into Spain,
    or the F MAO to leave MAO for the retreat. Water under the bridge.)
    
    Germany will have no offensive capabilities. I half expect him to ditch
    Munich and leave the three Scandinavian units. But even in that case I can
    hold him off myself, and you'd pick up Munich, and then I think I could
    slowly invade Scandinavia. So if you, or you and Cal, can hold onto enough
    in the South, I think I can handle the northern waters.
    
    Yeesh. If Cal doesn't wise up immediately, it looks pretty bad! I'm turning
    up my propaganda machine to persuade Cal of the seriousness of the
    situation.
    
    
    What a season. Ten centers changed hands, including eight home centers, and
    all three of Germany's home centers.

    Turkey goes to thirteen centers.
    
    Worried yet?
    
    Have you got this all worked out in your own mind, or do you want to talk
    thing over? Remember I said earlier, about a game-year ago or so, that I
    thought our fates would be tied together if we both made it to the endgame.
    Well, I think we've officially made it to the endgame, and I think we'll
    stand or lose together indeed. So I don't think I have any secrets to keep
    from you anymore. And it might be wise to make sure we're in synch.

    Ok by me, Napoleon.
    
    Given my struggles, a share in a victory sounds great.
    
    And, much as I enjoyed beating the hell out of Germany with you, my
    bloodlust is satisfied. I would, though, like to hear something definite
    from Pitt before I have to actually do anything friendly -- Pitt has been

    I'm sincere in the sense that I'll do all I can to prevent a Turkish win.
    My main object, though, is to bring Italy around, at last.  I agree with
    you that we could possibly reduce the numbers a bit more.
    
    Let's see how the proposal flies.  We don't know yet what might open up.

    Quite a turn.  I suspected Germany might sneak into Munich while I took
    Berlin.  He probably did not figure on that happening.  If I were he, I'd
    keep A Mun for the diplomatic leverage.  It'll be interesting.
    
    I think I have to disband stp and build f bre.  Otherwise, T and I will
    break through.
    
    Surely, Italy can now see the situation.  I warned him this would happen,
    but he was convinced he could play the balancer in the Med.  Well, maybe
    he's right, which means a draw is in the offing.

    Jim,
    
    >Unfortunately, the SYNTAX file is nowhere near as useful as it should be.
    
    That may be. However,
    
    >In particular, it does not explain abbreviations
    
    I believe it does, in fact.
    
    Here are some abbreviations that it explains:
    
    
    <type>    = "army", "a", "fleet", "f" or <empty>.
    <power>   = Power name or abbreviation of two or more characters.
    <holds>   = "h", "hold", "holds", "stand", "stands".
    <moves>   = "-", "->", "m", "move", "moves", "move to", "moves to".
    <support> = "s", "support", "supports".
    <convoy>  = "c", "convoy", "convoys".
    <proxy>   = "p", "proxy", "proxy to".
    <disband> = "d", "disband".
    <build>   = "b", "build" or <empty>.
    <remove>  = "r", "remove", "d", "disband" or <empty>.
    <waive>   = "w", "waive".
    
    So there, for example, it has explained that "a" can abbreviate "army", "-"
    can abbreviate "moves to", and so forth.
    
    Maybe you had certain other abbreviations in mind? Abbreviations for
    provinces? Those are given in another file (MAP).
    
    
    >  What I most would like to
    >have is the Judge to send me all ORDER submissions in addition to all
    >PRESS.
    
    Actually, I think this would not be so good, myself.
    
    It would essentially eliminate the stratagem of entering a 'deliberately
    incorrect' order, so as to have an excuse to hand your 'ally' later. That
    might be all right for a Newbie game, where we can give up some recherche
    tactics, but would it be a good idea for a demo game like ghodstoo?

    Well, I send out some broadcasts with examples of various kinds, including
    press and convoy orders. (I agree with you that the help files do not have
    enough examples, and especially the formal sort of explanation the syntax
    file gives can turn off non-programmers fast!) I ask players to try out
    press commands before the game starts, while I 'watch'. I go over the
    various deadline parameters and other flags in broadcasts. Quite a lot of
    other things, I think -- I'd have to check my logs.

    Witch,
    
    In case you're wondering, the press from me that Italy forwarded was part of
    something I wrote in reply to a general note from France to everybody except
    you. France offers a share of the draw to whomever will help him prevent you
    from winning.
    
    Why Italy decided to annoy me by forwarding that particular piece of mail,
    and showing me that he was forwarding it, I don't know. I guess there's a
    fair chance it was just an oversight.
    
    My thinking is not too far from Cal's, in fact. Not much of a revelation to you.
    
    There aren't many secrets left in a position like this one. Oh, maybe I
    still have one left....

    Comment 1.
    I sent some press to iagf, you forwarded it to Turkey. Please don't do that.
    I don't forward your press.
    
    Comment 2.
    I agree that there is no reason Austria ought to share.
    I also agree that Pitt should be dropped if it's possible. I am not at all
    sure it's possible, but I'll work on it. I think France will stop attacking
    this year, and will also support Austria in Venice, and wait to see what
    happens.
    
    Comment 3.
    You could lose two of your four centers to Turkey next year if you aren't
    very careful. Maybe Turkey still wouldn't win. But I bet you he tries,
    especially now that you have informed him that everyone else is getting
    together to stop him.

    Not particularly, but that isn't to say I'm ignoring a possible threat
    of Hohn trying for 18 centres.  Right now, I don't think he is likely to
    try the stab as the odds are just not good enough for him.  I have every
    intention (and I've told France this) of NOT straying too far from my
    home centres so as to maintain the status quo.  Now that you're at
    three, you have a say in that status quo as well.
    
    > Have you got this all worked out in your own mind, or do you want to talk
    > thing over?
    
    Not sure what there is to talk about, although I'll surely listen.  All
    I see as our parts at this point in the game is to make sure neither F
    nor T win outright.  A desirable side effect of this should be to
    involve you and I in the draw.

    I think we have to be part of a draw unless we get careless or (and this
    is unlikely) John & Hohn, in deciding to go for a 17-17 draw, wipe us
    out.

    I'm only sending this to the four of us as I don't feel the draw should
    be any larger than EFIT.  Edi won't be around much longer and I just
    don't think Pitt has played well enough to be in on the end result.  I'm
    not fussy on such a large draw, but it's probably an accurate assessment
    of this game.

    Calvin"! Talk about heterodoxy.)

    Yeah, my aim is about the same as yours. And so is Cal's, for that matter. I
    guess the main difference is that I could just sit on the sidelines and
    demand a draw, while you and Italy are each rather more in the way of the
    imperialists. Anyway, at this point I am certainly going to stick with
    France, since Turkey is the threat to win, and France seems to have no
    interest in eliminating me at all. (I mean, he doesn't seem to be interested
    in it.)
    
    I don't believe that France really expects Austria to share in a draw. But I
    think he does expect it to be a five-way. I know this: *any* scheme that
    definitely stops Turkey France will prefer to any scheme that gives Turkey a
    chance to win.
    
    Now that France has disbanded that fleet, I think tactics are simple, if we
    are both serious about drawing. Uh, wait, you have to disband two. Ok, well,
    obviously you are going to keep the A Mun. Let's go get Stp, then, with your
    two Scand units plus one of mine. Or two of mine, if you'd rather. Maybe I
    could do F Den-Bal-Bot and F Edi-Nwg-Bar.
    
    I don't have my map in front of me. But if something along those lines
    sounds all right, I'll look over the details on Monday.
    
    The other possibility is for you and me just to sit and do nothing. I might
    send a fleet to help out around the MAO. But I think it's really going to be
    up to Italy and France, and to a lesser extent to you (your A Mun) to do the
    Turkeystopping.
