    Well.
    
    I guess I have to change the order back, to F Bal S A Pru h. Because for all
    I know you haven't managed to change *your* orders at all. Maybe you're out
    of e-mail contact or something.
    
    Somewhat annoying.
    
    If you're moving Pru-Ber, I only hope you're giving yourself some support.

    Actually, my mood was rather good (though certainly anxious) when I wrote
    the above. My apologies if it came across as genuinely angry. (If I were
    really angry I wouldn't have signed my 'game name', as I think you know.)
    
    Also, I now think I should have said 'sin' rather than 'vice'. A subtle
    distinction, but important. ;)
    (I don't think vices can be redeemed at all, in principle; only sins.)

    I think the two singleton powers will be eliminated in the Fall, and then
    the three survivors will SET DRAW. Not only do I think this is what happens
    with 'best play' by all remaining parties, but I think it's obvious enough
    to survive the various ways in which real games fall short of 'best play by
    all parties'.
    
    The reasoning is pretty obvious, but here it is explicitly:
    
    1. France can just hold the line south of Stp himself this move. In all
    future moves I can order Bal S Ber, and that plus the simple French orders
    constitutes a complete stalemate south of Stp.
    
    2. I can order Nwy S Fin-Stp, which prevents Turkey ever from taking Stp
    under any circumstances. So Turkey is stuck at 17 if France and I play
    right.
    
    3. I can sail in two more fleets and force Stp, eliminating Germany and
    holding Turkey to the stalemate, eventually. So there is no point in Turkey
    supporting the German army in Stp now, unless he thinks France or I will
    make a really stupid mistake. I predict he will prefer to end the game now.
    
    4. Turkey will be able to construct a stalemate on his side, so there is no
    point in France and I continuing, and in any case I don't have any
    inclination to go on (I can't see how my result could improve).
    
    5. Then the only other possibility is that France could try to eliminate me
    too. Turkey would have to back way away from the line. But (although I
    haven't worked it all out blow by blow) I am quite sure I have more than
    enough extra force to "scuttle the ship" (throw the game to Turkey) if
    France threatens me at all, and I am quite sure that John takes my threat
    to be credible.
    If I'm judging wrong about this last item, the finish should be very
    interesting indeed!

    Oh, I should have put a smiley face on my note too.  I, of course, had
    the advantage of knowing what orders France had submitted (or at least
    had submitted to that point.

    Philosophers and those principles......
    
    It does look mightily as if you will be the only surviving quadrapartite
    member.  Did you have a deal with Turkey to pull back and let you have
    St. Pete free and clear?  I just didn't remember seeing that press fly by.
    Cal made it easy for Hohn to surround him too.  Fascinating ending.
    It does look like the three players with the will to be part of the draw
    are.  Cal and Pitt just didn't "have it".

    So, I'll support you to hold in Berlin, and I'll just take Stp with Fin and
    Nwy (I assume Hohn won't defend the A Stp, but if he does it's only a pain
    in the ass, not a disaster).
    
    Right?
    
    Then after G and I are eliminated in the Fall, we'll set draw. (I'm pretty
    sure that's when we do it, we don't have to wait until after the
    adjustments, do we?)

    My gambits have failed.  Oh well, I had to try.  Besides, at least I
    can take solace in the fact that I'm the biggest power. :)
    
    But unless John has a brain lapse of Brobdingnagian proportions, stick
    a fork in 'er.  She's done.  After this season, too, unless I miss my
    guess badly.
    
    Three-way EFT, 6/11/17 centers.

    You really have to ask?!
    
    OK, well here goes:
    
    
    
    Hohn finishes off Cal (like *everyone* always said he would...)
    
    John grins smugly (though he has to do so in the dark since undead can't
    stand direct sunlight).
    
    Jamie surprises everyone by *not* eliminating me in order to demonstrate
    his new playing style, "dubious self interest".
    
    I warp back from my alternate reality and set draw before Edi and Faz can
    further poison Jamie's pristine state of mind.
    
    Game over.

    Likely outcome: 3-way FTE.  I'll vote for it if it's proposed.  Hohn's
    broad-front retreat, however, could signal his willingness to let E-F fight
    it out.  Still, I think he'd scoop the needed center to win if we did.

    As a matter of fact, I thought about that, and wondered whether the fact
    that you were willing to tease me about it was evidence that things were
    going to work out all right for me in the end. I did take it to be some
    evidence! Even *your* cruelty must know some bounds....
    
    
    I want to address the rest of your note, but I would like that to be "off
    the record", ok? I guess I'll bypass the Judge to send it.

    Tell you what.  Let me know what centers you'd be interested in, what
    other lines we'd develop, and I'll respond to the proposal ASAP.

    strike a deal with me for a two-way and then concede some centers until I

    Dudes,
    
    I believe that we can set DRAW after the retreat phase, during the
    adjustment phase, and have a 3-way draw. That is, I think Germany and Italy
    are officially *out* (no longer "survivors") as soon as they own zero
    centers, which will happen *during* the adjustment phase.
    
    But I am not quite sure enough of this to be willing to set DRAW and risk a
    five-way. :-)
    
    Does either of you know for sure? I'd ask Jim, but I figure it's more
    likely that one of you knows.

<p><a name=16></a><b>Private message from <font color=0000cc>England</font> to <font color=bbbb00>Turkey</font>:</b><pre>
    Yeah, ok, just submit the builds then. Too bad Pitt retreated instead of
    just disbanding. Now we have to wait for *his* adjustment orders too.
    
    But fine, I'm submitting my order now.
    
    And beginning to write my EOG comments. Now don't you guys change what I
    have to write, ya hear?

    My build is in.  Let's just set draw after builds are resolved; I
    agree it's not worth the risk.
    
    But what a shock that would be. ;)

<p><a name=18></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=ff0000>Austria</font>:</b><pre>
    Well it looks like there may be a three way draw here.
    
    Now the issue that I have always wondered at in the play is that was it
    really worth that much to go from a 4 way to a 3 way?   I still hold to the
    old old school of either you win or there is another result.  This may be
    also why I am a better ally in that if there is no victory I really value
    the alliance over some marginalization of a loss.

    So Jamie worms his way into yet another draw, just like most of the
    Hall9* games.  Good show, Gentle King!
    
    Looks like Pitt should have let Hohn win.
