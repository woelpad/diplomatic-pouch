    I'm baaaackkkk....
    
    I was delayed by the blizzard of '97 but I've been home for a couple of
    days.  Problem was, I had no power.  I defaulted to my trusty laptop but,
    for some reason, I couldn't talk to the judge that way...go figure.
    Anyway, all's back to normal now and my retreat is in.
    
    Edi, I was out most of the day but I was gratified to get your messages
    when I returned:
    
    RING
    
    RING
    
    Answering Machine: "This is Pitt's place.  Please leave a message."
    
    Edi:  "Pitt!  You're late!  Get your orders in, you bum!"

    I have called Pitt three times today and left messages for him to get his
    moves in.
    He is still on vacation this week.  He left Sweden on Monday with me though we
    split up on the flights home.
    
    He suffered in Sweden from the Kill the Champion syndrome.
    
    A quick summary:
    
    There were 7 Americans, 10 French, 6-8 Brits, 1-4 Belgiums, 1 German, 1
    Norwegean, 4 Finns and about 80 Swedes.
    
    Top Board had: 2 French, 1 Belgium, 1 Norwegean, 1 American (me) and 2 Swedes.
    Top finish was 1-Frenchman, 2-Swede, 3- Norweagean (won tie breaker with
    American)
                          supply centers was 9T-7E-6R-6I-5F-2G-1A with all 7
    countries alive at 1909
    
    Top Countries went to
    2 to Americans (me and Tom Korbin)
    2 to French
    1 to Brit
    2 to Swedes
    
    The team tournament was won by an American Team ( Perry, Bonds, & ???)
    Top Tactician went to a Frenchmen (who won the tournament)
    Top Diplomat went to a Brit (who had the only 18 center win in the
    tournament's 40+ games).
    
    The tournament system ignored ties and awarded points based on supply centers
    held as of 1909 Winter.
    If there was a game winner then he got 100 points and everyone else got -0-
    If there was no winner then everyone got their supply centers +1 with bonuses
    of
    38 for first
    14 for second
    7 for third
    Ties summed the bonuses and divided by number of tied positions.

    Pitt,
    
    Knowing what a mess your mail queue must be, I will send you this update
    so it will be at the top.  We are waiting for you to retreat your Fleet
    in the North Sea.  Please submit it ASAP.  thanks!
    
    I hope your "adventure" getting bback from World Dip Con wasn't too
    trying.

    Just to add to Edi's report on WDC VII, there were, after round 3, no fewer
    than three Americans in the top seven (Tom, Edi, and me).  But since the
    rankings were posted on the wall (a practice I didn't appreciate, and about
    which I complained), we were marked men.  Edi was smart and played round 3
    instead of round 4, and thus made it into the final game.  Tom and I didn't
    play round 3 -- we played round 4 (after the posting was made) and we dropped.
    In both our cases, we were openly ganged up on for the solitary reason that
    we were at the top of the rankings.  It felt like playing a game with four
    instead of six players, since my two closest neighbors wouldn't even talk to
    me once they saw where I was placed.  I was so disgusted that I sat out the
    final round (round 5).  Anyway, I ended up 28th as a result, but for one brief
    and shining moment (and using only objective play as a measure), I was one of
    the top seven Diplomacy players in the world.
    
    So watch yourselves, 'cause I'll stab you soon,

    John,
    
    You seem, in general, like the kind of player who prefers to let his moves
    do the talking. Shall we talk now, or shall I just listen to what your
    fleets have to say when the next round is processed?
    
    Germany could have given me a lot more trouble by retreating to York.
    Apparently he prefers to participate in the final carving up of Russia.
    This is not much of a relief to me. If Russia is crushed, my position will
    be even worse. As I recall, you were not too enthusiastic about the
    prospect, yourself.

    To comment a bit on Edi's and Manus' WDC VII report:
    
    >Just to add to Edi's report on WDC VII, there were, after round 3, no fewer
    >than three Americans in the top seven (Tom, Edi, and me).  But since the
    >rankings were posted on the wall (a practice I didn't appreciate, and about
    >which I complained), we were marked men.
    
    I can certainly speak to this.  As Edi noted in his brief report, I was
    targeted in the first two rounds because of the perception that the current
    World Champion was either too good or too untrustworthy to be allowed to
    live.  (I prefer good...:-)  I expected that, of course, but even I was
    surprised at how blatant it was.  In round 1, I was Turkey.  Russia,
    Austria, and Italy all diplomed with me prior to Spring 1901 and we made
    the usual nice talk.  In Spring 1901, all 3 of them reneged on their
    promises and either stabbed me directly or set up the Lepanto.  More
    importantly, however, when I approached all of them independently after
    Spring 1901, each openly and bluntly said that they were picking on me just
    because I was the current champ.  Worse yet, two of them refused to even
    diplome with me any further becuase they were too afraid of me.  I *was*
    able to get Russia to back off a bit but I was stuck in the corner as a
    Russian puppet fending of the AI for the rest of my miserable existence
    (Russia ultimately stabbed again in 1905 and I was out in 1906).  Round 2
    was more of the same with me as England.
    
    So, OK.  I don't really blame them since I *did* have a reputation.
    However, the practice of posting interim scores during the tournament
    resulted in Manus and Tom suffering this same effect, unfairly so in my
    opinion.  Tom missed the final board by 2 points - he was 2nd after 2 games
    but he placed 8th prior to the last round.  Manus was in 7th after round 2
    and had a decent shot, too.  However, in both their cases, players in their
    games identified them as front-runners and targeted them for elimination in
    the third game.  If either of them had had even a marginally good score in
    their third game, both would have been on the top board and there would
    very likely have been another US World Champion (Edi, Tom, or Manus).
    
    US players weren't the only ones zinged by this practice.  The leader after
    2 games was a Belgian, Jean-Louis Delattre.  He didn't even make the cut
    for the top board.  In fact, with the exception of Edi and possibly one
    other, none of the leaders after round 3 made it to the top board and those
    who did had already played all 3 of their qualifying games, so they weren't
    affected by the "get the leader" syndrome.  In order to do this, however,
    you had to sit out the 4th round, which was the team tournament.  Edi did
    this, I hope intentionally, and showed again what a smart player he is.
    
    Manus and I discussed this at the tournament and we agreed that it was
    useful to post scores so you could see where you stood in relation to
    others.  However, we felt that the scores should be keyed to a player
    number rather than a name.  That way, only those who know your number can
    tell where you stand (and if you divulge your number, you deserve what you
    get).
    
    I have a number of other thoughts on the scoring and tournament format
    (like how Edi got screwed in the final game tie-breaker or how setting a
    year-play-to limit [1909] completely destroys the end game) but I'm
    interested in hearing comments on this one first.
    
    What do you guys think?

    Not being too hip to the whole Dip convention scene, i was wondering if
    it would make sense to move this discussion over to r.g.d., since I don;t
    think much of the world community is observing this game.
    
    I am not upset to see it; it's cool.  I just think maybe the practice can
    be stopped/fixed (I like the ID# system a la postign grades in college)
    better if you include some non ghodstoo people.  maybe r.g.d., maybe via
    various Zines?
    
    Not sure the fora which are appropriate, but this should certainly not be
    the ONLY one.

    World Con
    
    >US players weren't the only ones zinged by this practice.  The leader after
    >2 games was a Belgian, Jean-Louis Delattre
    
    Actually this is in correct.  Jean-Louis and I were together in the third
    round, and yes I played in the 3rd round to avoid the anticipated blood bath
    in the team game.  In that round we both had come into the game as having
    'won' our prior game.  While the rest of the board tried to jump on us we
    stuck it out together with a Russia-Turkish alliance that saw me move my Fleet
    Sevas through Constantinople in Spring 02 and then out to the Medit.  We
    stunned the local's with a solid alliance and we wound up with a 13-13 finish
    that put both of us in the Top board.
    
    The local Swedes on our table were very shocked that we did not stab each
    other and made constant references to our prior standings.  We countered that
    neither of us thought it would be good enough and that only double 'wins'
    would work.  We were both lucky in that.
    
    I am not a big fan of the posting of results in a flowing effect since I have
    often been the victim of the posting of an early success.  I can remember
    often coming in 8th and 1 center short of best country.  The problem with the
    issue of posting is that it felt that the rumormongers amongst us would know
    what was the best scores and thus by positing them they give everyone the same
    information.
    
    The posting effect was one of the reasons that for many years in the US
    tournaments the scoring system was not known in detail so as to prevent
    players from playing the tournament rather than simply the best game.
    
    I like the idea of a number ranking so you know where you are but not exactly
    who everyone else is.  Then again the rumormongers will have a field day.

    It certainly is going in the Abyssinian Prince Section on the game which
    is seen by many, many people (about 300 now, I think) and will get
    excerpted on Dave Kleiman's web page.
    
    The ID system might help, but the working assumption is that people will
    track these things and figure it out anyway.  One issue buried in the
    discussion is the tendency for nationality groups to work together to
    effect the kinds of tournament behavior that is being described.
    Americans tend to be much more "lone rangers" in their approach in
    my experience.  At the World Dip Con that I attended a few years
    ago in Birmingham, the big hew and cry at the time was against the
    French; however, in my experience in the games the Swedes and Brits
    actually were more aggressive in plotting together.  In one game I
    was in there were three Brits, three French and me.  I found myself
    "in the middle".  While the Brits pretended to ally with me, Steve
    Cox (who is a brilliant player in any event) froze me out and stabbed
    me brilliantly with the eye on the scoring system.  The French players
    were quite blunt (partly because of their seeming inability to be subtle
    in English and while I understand French very well and speak it very
    poorly, I chose to disguise that fact as it helped me there) in that
    they were REACTING to the Brits three-way gang up.  That was my
    independent assessment as well.  While I still think the concept of
    World Dip Con is fascinating, tournament behavior is a big issue.

    What shall we do? Specifically, do you want me to order Nth-Nwy while you
    go Nwy-Swe? Or shall I stay put, or take a chance on Nth-Den? I'll do it

    GKJ,
    Greetings!
    My advice (as I head out the door, late for a Pinewood Derby
    weigh-in....mmm boy...):
    
    Go for the fjords!  I imagine Pitt will either get mad at me and try for
    SWE, or he'll cover Den and wait out French action (against whom, for
    example) before making offensive noises vs either of us in '04.
    
    I'll write more later this weekend, but for now, Jamie, take Nwy.  Hohn
    and Edi will obviously shoot for WAR now, but I'm committed.  I want
    viable E/I nations, and--quite honestly--if the front collapses quickly
    enough, it *may* throw Germany into your arms as a matter of joint
    convenience, to stanch the northern/western AT expansion.
    
    Hey, stranger things have happened!  I imagine Edi is upset over BOH.
    Life's hell sometimes, wot?

    Well, I would really like to own Norway. Hell, I'd like to own Belgium, but
    I'll be honest and admit that France hasn't offered it. Greedy bastard.
    But, there you have it, he's still got me over a barrel, I can't expect any
    giveaways.
    
    Of course, if I should happen to take over Norway any time soon, I would
    want StPete too, but I don't think I would need anyone's permission at that
    point, or anyone's help except for the help of not attacking me. I feel
    that I need to have five centers to play any significant role in the
    endgame. And Nwy + Stp are centers I want to own for other reasons. (No,
    not stalemate reasons!)
    
    One point in your favor already, from my perspective, is that you retreated
    to Skag instead of York. Whew. You could have kept me tied in knots;
    instead I have a little freedom.
    How I regard you in future moves will depend (assuming France is being
    honest with me) on what your next little projects turn out to be.
    
    Cheers!

    I'm as happy as anybody that you're putting the heat on Russia after what
    he did to me in the north.  However, though I'm sure you've seen it, may I
    suggest a path of caution with regard to Austria?  He's slippery.  If, at

    >Sorry to hear about the WorldCon thing.  Take it as a "backhanded
    >compliment" from everyone that they ganged up on you.
    
    I do.  I was part of the same thing against the 1995 World Champ at WDC VI
    last year.  I was bothered by the fact that others, like Manus and Tom
    Kobrin, were subjected to the same treatment just because they played well
    in the early rounds in Sweden.  Their results should have been kept
    anonymous so they were not unfairly targeted as frontrunners.

    Thanks, but even though I'm not thrilled about your support for England
    into NTH, I still don't want to see you collapse.  You need to hold NOR in
    order to stay alive.  I won;t move in behind you but England might.  I
    strongly suggest you continue to hold it and, instead, support me back into
    NTH.  What do you think?

    That sounds like a wrokable plan.  I have already started eastward by
    moving my BUR army to MUN.  The question is, what can we do with it?

    Nope.  The retreat to SKA was a defensive move against England and Russia,
    who supported England into NTH.  I can use it to cover DEN or threaten SWE

    Surely, threatening Sweden is no way to trouble England.  He may let you

    Hi Jim,
    A few quick Russian game thoughts for this season...
    In the east, Hohn continues to wait for 'the next turn" to consider
    stabbing Edi.  of course, when he passed up the perfect chance in S'03 to
    hit Edi with Cal and me, I knew he was just stringing me along.  he'll
    never make an RT happen, because it's not in his best interests to do so.
     He can take me down with Edi -- gaining relatively moreso than his
    Austrian partner -- and than stab Edi at his leisure, if it works for
    him.  It's reassuring to know Hohn is just as underhanded and morally
    bankrupt as the rest of us; he had me worried for awhile!
    
    Edi hasn't offered me anything since 1902, and vice versa.  He's only in
    this for himself, allies be damned, and if that's the gameplan, then my
    goal will be to help take him down a notch or two.   I can help Cal get
    TRI this turn (doubtless for the loss of WAR) and perhaps Pitt will grab
    a Scandinavian center.  I have a hunch the remainder of this game will
    see me more a kingmaker, than a pretender to any thrones of my own...
    
    In the West, my hit of Nth Sea was designed to do three things: (1) show
    Eng that I do indeed honor my pledges, (2) Try and entice France into a
    pro-Eng maneuver, balancing the west, and (3) if all else fails, get Pitt
    roiled enough over the "nonsensical" stab that he'd come after me, and
    finally (!) direct some attention to the East.  For the majority of this
    game, he's been my greatest cheerleader, urging me to hold off AT without
    help, while he mops up E.  Hopefully he'll now see the east for what it
    truly is, and perhaps take action to cover his flank, now that I (his
    previous flank guard) am dying.  The ultimate sweet thing would be a
    german-Turkish hit of Edi, with E/I/F as spoilers and satellites in a
    final Clash of Titans.
    
    No word from France, which isn't unusual --  he's proving to be a rather
    weak correspondent.  England and I see things pretty much eye-to-eye, and
    we've arranged some moves.  I told Pitt to shoot for Nwy, as I'm moving
    to swe.  I also told England to do the same, which may keep me solvent up
    north--benefiting the West, I 'd say!
    
    I feel kind of bad this game, but I'm losing interest in it because of
    time constraints  -- something I expected when I signed up.  I'm trying
    to keep the spark alive, but I wonder if I'm not subconsciously urging a
    'death wish" on myself here.  The logical move would've been a retreat to
    WAR, then have Mos and War defend each other, with Sev-Rum or Ukr.    Of
    course, what does that do?  it gives me another whole turn of defense,
    until they use Sev-Ukr-Gal to hit either War or Mos, and eventually I'd
    peter out anyway.  May as well try and keep this interesting for the
    readership.

    Faz,
    
    I can't address this at length, obviously, but it seems to me that
    Internet games on the Judges are plagued by "time constraints".
    When you imagine that this game is about the SLOWEST that is
    available, so that other games move far faster, this is nearly
    epidemic.  You can see why people descend into playing gunboat
    all the time....  what you are experiencing is part of the game
    and if I think it ever gets close to being otherwise (which it
    isn't) I'd approach you about asking to resign.  You didn't do it,
    but I am responding here to let you know that if you DID inquire
    about resigning right now, I would talk you out of it.
    
    Thanks for playing and interjecting your play into the mix, we'll
    have fun analyzing it at the end!

    Hi again, Pitt
    Sorry to hear about the WorldCon thing.  Take it as a "backhanded
    compliment" from everyone that they ganged up on you.  Typical ungrateful
    Europeans, you know?  We save them in two world wars AND give them the
    Marshall Plan, and they screw you anyway!   Humph.
    
    As for this game, my last letter rings true.  I think you *really* need
    to head east, given that AT stand to rip the front apart in a couple of
    turn, leaving your eastern flank open.  I'm moving to Sweden, so plan
    accordingly -- take Nwy, if it helps.
    
    My goal is to buy a couple more turns of time, to enable you and Italy to
    gain / hold off the AT surge.  Maybe once I try and favor one side of the
    AT over the other, there will be an internal "greed struggle" over
    centers, and we'll see a stab.  If not, I'll go down fighting.
    
    Anyway, welcome back from the Con, and drop a line if you get time.
    
    Mark

    I do.  I was part of the same thing against the 1995 World Champ at WDC
    VI
    last year.  I was bothered by the fact that others, like Manus and Tom
    Kobrin, were subjected to the same treatment just because they played
    well
    in the early rounds in Sweden.  Their results should have been kept
    anonymous so they were not unfairly targeted as frontrunners.
    
    ** I concur about the visible standings at WorldCon.  In a perverse way,
    it's merely a 'balance-of-power', i.e., see the threat, stop the threat.
    On the other hand, to be penalized for doing well -- and to be hit in so
    blatant a fashion -- seems inimical to the game.  Kind of goofy.  Kind of
    European.

    Thanks, but even though I'm not thrilled about your support for England
    into NTH, I still don't want to see you collapse.  You need to hold NOR
    in
    order to stay alive.  I won;t move in behind you but England might.  I
    strongly suggest you continue to hold it and, instead, support me back
    into
    NTH.  What do you think?
    
    ** Thanks for not taking Sweden, but  if it's ok with you, I've now
    managed to p*** off all my neighbors, whether deliberately or
    accidentally.  I'd rather not perturb England again, at least until I see
    what happens in the East.  I'll move to SWE but tell Eng I'm holding (or
    will support him, or something).  As I fully expect Lon-Ech (to counter
    France), methinks Nth will fall easily for you.  he's not going anywhere,
    and if he does bounce Nth this turn, the arrival of France's fleet will
    tip the balance in S'04.  me in Swe eventually means "me in Bot, to guard
    StP and Lvn," which does indeed block up the east from the rapacious AT.
    
    >My goal is to buy a couple more turns of time, to enable you and Italy

    That sounds like a wrokable plan.  I have already started eastward by
    moving my BUR army to MUN.  The question is, what can we do with it?
    
    ** Well, not to say I told you so, but to me the best place for that army
    is a possible  bounce this season (Mun-Tyo).  This way, when I hit Vie
    and Cal takes TRI, Edi can't retreat forward into TYO.  If Edi's not in
    Tyo, that means Cal can build a fleet to prevent the expected F Smy build
    from Hohn (which would give AT three fleets vs Cal's two and thus open up
    IOn in '04 for them).  If Cal has that extra fleet, we almost force Hohn
    to stab Edi, if only to expand somehow!
    
    To me, that is indeed the best place for MUN to go.  if you're still
    leery of it, you can always send it to SIL and help me in WAR.
    
    Thanks for the reply, Pitt, and rest assured, my focus is eastward;
    therein lies the threat to us all.  I'm sorry I havem't been able to hold
    them off.

    Hi Jim
    ** Thanks for the words of wisdom (below).
    
    I can't address this at length, obviously, but it seems to me that
    Internet games on the Judges are plagued by "time constraints".
    When you imagine that this game is about the SLOWEST that is
    available, so that other games move far faster, this is nearly
    epidemic.  You can see why people descend into playing gunboat
    all the time....  what you are experiencing is part of the game
    and if I think it ever gets close to being otherwise (which it
    isn't) I'd approach you about asking to resign.  You didn't do it,
    but I am responding here to let you know that if you DID inquire
    about resigning right now, I would talk you out of it.
    
    ** Rest assured, I have no intention of resigning.  I had to quit three
    games (my only resignations, btw)  before I went off to Russia for 6
    months of UN duty, and doing so left a bad taste in my mouth.  After 20+
    years of playing by mail, I take pride in finishing what I start, and an
    occasional burnout won't slow me down.  I do feel a little bad that I
    haven't managed to keep up a frenetic pace of correspondence (one of the
    things that people seem to like about me, so I've been told), but work is
    just killing me, and will do so until October....much 'extracurricular'
    duty with the cadets (read:  field duty for 6 weeks in summer, as well as
    starting up a new course).
    
    Having said all that, I've got to stop worrying about time, and get on
    with this game.  The only thing worse than resigning from a game is to
    play the position in a substandard manner, and THIS was the fear I'd
    begun to experience.  I'm not sure whether my moves are REALLY being
    driven by a ghods-like set of inspiration, to keep the game interesting
    and fluid, or if it was a death-wish to let them kill me quickly.  I'm
    going to assume the former, and play this thing to the bloody end.  My
    big concern is honor (as most military like to think is only proper).  I
    won't dishonor your choice, the game, or me, by being a sluggo.
    
    Onward and upward, my friend!

    >
    >Provisionally, I could consider that.  The provision is that you use the SC
    >to build F LVP.
    
    Wellll....
    
    I accept that provision provisionally: the provision is that you should
    already be attacking France, or be otherwise engaged, by the time my choice
    of builds comes around (and that's not too soon).
    
    Ok, here's the thing. Maybe I've got the situation all wrong and France
    will either now or soon order a fleet to Irish Sea or NAO or something. In
    that case, I would certainly use any build I got to put something in Lvp,
    most likely a fleet. Ok, yeah, a fleet. But if I'm right, France won't
    order a fleet to Iri or NAO. In that case, building F Lvp is likely to get
    me essentially nowhere except into a fight, a fight to which I'd have to
    devote at least three fleets, even though I'd have virtually no prospects
    of getting anywhere. And, well, that would just make it a little *too* easy
    for you.
    
    Here's where what I said about 'projects' comes in. If I were convinced
    that you were going to be engaged somewhere, and picking off Russian
    centers doesn't count!, then I would prefer to take my chances against
    France. If not, then I guess my best strategy is to sit on the fence,
    taking Nwy and Stp if I can. That does seem like the smart thing to do.
    Think about it.
    
    As I've said, I have no objection to things going smoothly and easily for
    you; you are not my 'enemy' in that way. Only I can't give you an easy shot
    at Edinburgh and London. (Well, I could! But I won't.)

    Hmph. Well, we'll see about that.
    
    
    >OK, I'll bite...what are the reasons (and, while you're at it, why are you
    >so quick to jump on your erstwhile Russian ally?)
    
    I can answer those questions at the same time.
    
    I haven't regarded Russia as an ally since he took Norway. Supporting me
    into North Sea is all very nice, but I still have a score to settle. I've
    never made this explicit, I guess, so here's the scoop. I counted on Russia
    from the start to help me in case of a G/F alliance. (It's more complicated
    than that, but that will do.) He gave me all assurances. And then took
    Norway as soon as it looked like he could get away with it.
    I never counted on you or France, really, except as self-interested
    neutrals, but I counted on Russia's cooperation, so that was the only
    genuine stab. (Except for Edi's, which I still haven't figured out, but I
    know he's somehow responsible.)
    
    
    >That was *part* of the reason for my retreat.
    
    Sure, I know. You could have taken your chances with Russia, or you could
    take your chances with me. I appreciate your choice.
    
    >>How I regard you in future moves will depend (assuming France is being
    >>honest with me) on what your next little projects turn out to be.
    >
    >I'm open to more explicit suggestions.
    
    Well, it's very up-in-the-air. You have many options. Picking off
    indefensible Russian centers is an obviously attractive one, non-committal.
    In that case, I would have to be non-committal in the same way (making the
    large assumption that I have any choice in the matter). You have other
    options. You could plunge straight into Austria, shaking up the balance in
    the south (which is looking pretty unpleasant at the moment). That would
    give me some freedom too, and as I said I think my best bet would be to try
    to grow at France's expense (with everyone else tied up with each other).
    Or you might push west against France, in which case, ahem, we could try to
    come up with a division that everyone could live with this time :).

    How?  If you and the con organizers are the only ones who know that your ID
    is 76, how will anyone else know unless you tell them?  I suppose, if you
    had the only solo victory in Round 1, others could tell...  OK, then, we
    don't don't post any scores until after 2 complete rounds.  If you already
    had *2* solo victories at that point, I don't think it matters if everyone
    knows what your ID # is...

    You know, in two World Dipcons, I haven't seen any of that kind of
    coordinated behavior at the country level.  I've seen friends or
    acquaintances work together temporarily (Hell, I had to take on a Frenchman
    *and* his girlfriend on the same board as Germany and Austria to my England
    in Round 2 last week) in one game but I've never seen any sort of secret
    cabal that works to place a member of a particular nation at the top.  And
    the temporary "meta" alliances I've seen have always fallen apart after the
    initial goal (get the front runner, for example) has been achieved.  I
    recognize that it's certainly possible for these larger, unethical
    alliances to happen but I've never seen them nor any evidence of them.

    I agree in principle but, so far, in practice I don;t think it's been a
    problem.  All the serious players seem to want to win, even if they do so
    at the expense of their countrymen.  I just don't have a sense that we're
    going to see any bicycle racing type behavior in Diplomacy tournaments any
    time soon.

    Whatever theory you guys come up with regarding" leading lights" being
    jumped at tournaments, you better account for this:
    
    When I ran DipCon here in Toronto back in the early 90s, we held a hobby
    meeting the night before the final round.  At that point Gary Behnen was
    leading (or close to) the tournament.
    
    At the meeting, we awarded him the postal Diplomacy Award for Best Player.
    Everyone there said it was the absolute kiss of death for his chances to
    survive the next day.
    
    Heh heh, not only did he survive, he grabbed an 18 centre win and took the
    whole damn tournament!

    Edi,
    
    France has not told me exactly what he plans to do (seems like a case of No
    News Is Bad News). I think he might possibly work against Germany.
    
    There is some chance that he would send one, or even two fleets to the
    Mediterranean and use the armies against Germany. Though he hasn't said so,
    I surmise that his move of an army to Marseilles was intended for Mar-Pie.
    But then what? I don't know.
    
    As to working a deal with Germany (for Norway), I've already tried. Maybe
    it will work. Pitt agreed on the condition that I use the build to
    construct a new fleet in Liverpool! Obviously, this is not exactly what you
    want. Not what I want either. Negotiations proceed. If it works out, I will
    very likely go for Stp after Norway.
    
    Pitt does seem fairly open to the idea of taking the indefensible Russian
    centers. That's good news for you. I don't exactly relish having German
    fleets all over the place if/when Pitt gets those centers and builds, but
    my options are awfully limited, so I'll go with that option if Pitt does.

    Edi,
    
    I did not mean to be coy when you called last night.  I guess that's one
    difference between the ftf and email games.  In email, I can think about
    the other player's message and my response.  A phone call leaves me a bit
    surprised.  I still remain wedded to email, so I have not gained much
    experience with talking diplomacy over the phone.  Thus, my initial
    reaction to your call.
    
    Well, anyway, as I said, I probably won't know what I will do until the
    last day.  England has made a persuasive case for cooperation, but I would
    feel mighty exposed to turn on Germany with one of his units still on my
    territory.  Seems to me I would also open the door to renewed G-E
    cooperation against me.  That's exactly what had me almost out at the
    beginning.
    
    As for Italy, I can give you help with him regardless of what happens to
    the north.  It's just a matter of when.  He's no threat to you, however,
    and sending F Con to the Med will put him on the defensive.
    
    So, let's keep talking.  Things will be self-explanatory after the
    deadline.

    Tsar Faz,
    
    HYPOTHESIS:
    Germany wants to set up to take Sweden himself next Spring, so prefers not
    to see me in Nwy and you in Swe.
    
    He'll probably bounce you in Swe, and move Hel-Den. We'll still have options.
    
    I am a little worried about this: France may eject the German army from
    Pic, and Pitt could let it disband and rebuild a fleet. He'd be taking a
    chance--if France takes Pic and goes to Bur, Germany has to beware of a
    land attack. But if he does build another fleet, we'll have real trouble
    even if/while France invades. Well, we'll just have to wait and see. Seems
    like Germany would support A Pic to hold, nothing else to do with that A
    Bel....
    
    In the mean time, Edi is lobbying for a G/E combination to take Sweden and
    Norway, "to get rid of the erratic Russian play." I hope you're still in
    touch with Hohn. France seems to be beyond any influence, he's just got his
    own ideas. Fortunately, I think they are favorable to me (and to you, for
    that matter). I expect to see him move into the Mediterranean this season.
    And I *hope* he will then coordinate with Italy's new fleet and break into
    the eastern waters....
    
    Cheers!

    Morning!  before I get ready for class, here's a short tidbit of things
    Teutonic....
    
    Germany wrote; tone of the note was actually low-key.  Said he didn't
    'really' mind the joint RE hit of NTH, and that he understood my need to
    face off vs AT; hence he didn't want to reduce me as a co-defender of
    the faith.
    
    Bottom line:  he said he's not going for Nwy or Swe.  He wants me to
    hold in Nwy and re-support him to NTH.   Now, while I half-believe him,
    I fully don't intend to flip-flop in the North.  I told him I had no
    desire to face off vs you, that he and Eng needed to work together if
    they were to defeat the AT, and that, if he really wanted NTH, he could
    wait until France got to Ech and then take it next spring.   Didn't get
    a reply to that....-grin-
    
    Told him I was still going to SWE (he's worried you'll take Nwy from
    behind; fancy that).   Food for thought, your Nobleness.....

    How's your day going?   How's the work routine/searching?  Hope all's

    Good luck here.  It's obvious I can either hit GAL or VIE this turn with
    BOH; you can guess which one it'll be, probably. -grin-
    Remember what I said last note.  I can't hurt (or help) both A and T,

    Well, but extremely hectic.  After game end, Jim and the public press

    very little negotiating this turn.

    I feel the same.  I suspect this will be an exciting turn, judging
    from the board positions and the messages I have waiting in my inbox
    that I have not yet responded to, and maybe there will be a way for us
    to coordinate.  At least, a bit better than we have in the past. ;)

    war aims, and to allay fears that "illogical elements and unhealthy
    forces" were controlling Russian military actions.
    
    The Ruler of All Russias assured the audience with the following:
    
    "For two years we have attempted to broker a peace with the Turks to our
    south.  Despite our sincere eforts to cultivate a friendship, Turkish
    insecurity (and, dare we say, expanding greed) has prevented a union of
    our forces.  This is regrettable, for we feel much mutual benefit
    could've occurred from such an alliance.  However, this *is* war, and our
    gallant foes have the upper hand--nothing more can be done.  Their
    Turkish partner, Archduke Edi, has given the Tsar nothing but fluff in
    all correspondence since 1901.  if one were to compare offers of mutual
    benefit to Baskin & Robbins ice cream flavors, Russia has only received
    "vanilla ice cream."   In fact, we weren't even offered the bowl to put
    the ice cream in!   It is clear that Austria (The Court of the Crimson
    King) never intended to treat Russia with anything but scorn and enforced
    servitude.
    
    Faced with such Balkan  intransigence and a desire to exploit us, Russia
    has embarked on a policy of 'selective punishment.'  We cannot hurt both
    A and T, so we shall selectively deal out what little pain it is still
    possible to administer.   We also owe our former Quadripartite Continuum
    allies the honor due them, to allow some sort of beneficial gain to come
    from our exertions.  This is why we move as we do.  We are not propelled
    by madness, or by poor play.   And while it is true that the Tsar is
    _not_ possessed of the same 'ghod-like' skills as his fellow diplomats,
    rest assured there *is* a "method to the madness" of what we do.
    
    Russia could retreat her forces to the WAR-MOS line and try to hold on;
    but why?  In one more turn the AT forces will be in Sev/Gal/Ukr, and one
    or the other center will then fall anyway.   Does  this help our allies?
    It does not.  Therefore, Russia shall hold on for as long as possible,
    and give her friends (particularly  G and I)  a chance to grow and face
    the expanding Eastern Threat.  And while we do this, we shall attempt to
    create...conditions...that may cause a cleavage in the AT.  If that
    occurs, then the Tsar can defend his city with a smile on his dying face.
     If that event still does not occur, thenlet them sing our posthumous
    praises in Berlin, in Paris, London and Rome, and bury us standing
    up--facing south.  And then  they shall know we fought the good fight,
    both for ourselves and for our allies.  For honor still means something
    to Russia, even if 'life' does not."
    
    With that, the Tsar called a halt to questions from the press, and
    advised them to stay glued to the wireless for news from Central and
    Eastern Europe.

    Hi Cal,
    Well, FINALLY we pierce a small part of Edi's line.  And while I'm sure
    that AT planned these moves all along (i.e., the swap of BUL/RUM, support
    to WAR, etc) it *is* nice to see Edi at 0 builds this turn, eh?  And the
    nice part is that he didn't retreat Tri-Tyo, as he could've done to make
    life tough(er) for us. I'm still bitterly disappointed that Pitt didn't
    move to Tyo or Sil, as requested; that would've solidified the East
    and/or caused great heartache for Edi...makes you wonder about any A/G
    in-place agreements....
    
    We now have to decide a couple things:  what do you build?  (I'm wagering
    F Nap-TyS?), and how do I move?   (I'm thinking two army builds, and then
    either passively sitting tight--mutual War/Mos supports--or some
    razzle-dazzle regarding Boh and War vs Gal.)
    
    One option, if you're willing:
    
    Boh-Vie (Tri S);   Apu-Alb, Ion C (Adr S)
    
    This way guarantees you don't lose Tri, as both support pieces are cut,
    and stands at least a small chance of getting me a center -- as
    compensation when either E or G hose me up north.
    
    I figure Turkey will build F Smy, and then use the two AT fleets + Smy
    and try to blow you out of ION.  Hence my desire for your fifth build and
    a cementing of the sea lines...Hohn and Edi have to either slowly reduce
    me for more builds to get more fleets to hit you, or Hohn can take the
    'easy way out" and stab Edi for quick builds--probably with you gaining
    something in the process.  That's my current plan.
    
    Anyway, let me hear what you think of the above proposal, or anything
    you've got cooking in your brain at present.  I'm going down to the wire
    with you on this one, Cal.
    
    Best

    Well, all went exactly as I planned this turn (for once)!  The northern
    bounce allowed me to keep both Nwy and Swe (for now, anyway), and, as you
    predicted, Germany is turning his big guns eastward vs me.  That may buy
    you a turn or two, although the French stab into Iri is MOST unwelcome.
    It appears you'll have to come after me to compensate for centers which,
    while we discussed it earlier, will still cramp my style as I attempt to
    punish A and T.
    
    I got lucky regarding WAR and defending the south.  I now have to decide
    whether to sit passively (using Boh-Gal, for example, while defending Mos
    and War with supports), or just launch some weird probes vs Ukr or
    Gal...any ideas?
    
    I'll obviously rebuild in WAR and STP.  I imagine I'll build 2 armies,
    vice 1-and-1, which means we have some discussions needed for Nwy  and
    regarding Germany.   Are you going to try for Nwy?  Send a fleet back
    toward Cly/Wal to deal with Fra?  or should we try and get me into Den
    (Swe-Den, Nth S, Nwg-Nwy) instead?  Options, options....
    
    Anyway, me hearty, we are in a flux pattern at the moment, but certainly
    not as bad as it could've been (or might be in 1904)!  let's hear what
    you're thinking, and see what we can do regarding joint ops.

    Hello Hohn
    Congrats on retaking BUL (and belated...cough...congrats on reseizing
    SEV).  I know in my heart of hearts that the AT moves were
    pre-coordinated regarding Rum/Bul, but nonetheless, 'thanks" for keeping
    Edi at 0 builds.  For once this game, my moves all trned out exactly as
    planned, so I have a modicum of chance at keeping a small, viable rump
    state up north, as well as staying in BOh and continuing to harass one
    half of my tormentors!
    
    Here's the Russian offer of the day:  turn west.  Use Sev-Rum (Ukr S) and
     BLA-SEV (no threat to me that way).  In return, I can sail to BAL when
    Pitt boots me from Swe, and could theoretically even go to Sil and/or Pru
    if the freedom to maneuver made itself apparent (i.e., no AT wolves
    banging on the door).
    
    This doesn't make for earth-shattering moves, I realize, but it does give
    you the Black Sea littoral states (and a build), and puts you and Italy
    in a position to further hose Edi.  Granted, Italy then grows(and
    possibly stymies your growth), but I think a judicious use of Turk armies
    and Italian fleets--over Austria's rump--would cause Cal to head west
    against the obvious F/G alliance, while giving you army invasion corrdors
    into germany...ably aided by your loyal Russian subaltern.
    
    Anyway, like all my other proposals, I don't expect these seeds to fall
    on fertile ground either, but I have to sow them nonetheless.   As longas
    there's an AT, I'll allow aggressive EG actions in my rear while I focus
    on the east, and will try to at least stop one arm of the two that are
    choking me.  You benefit either way in these arrangements, you rascal.
    
    Take care, Hohn; good luck with work and play.

    Hello Pitt,
    Well, "thanks" for the bounce in Nwy.  Not sure if you expected the
    bounce and did it to "protect" your eastern flank, or if you did it to
    pave the way for the eventual takeover of Scandinavia (Den/Ska tag team
    next turn, etc).   Regardless, the results allowed me to build the two
    armies I so desperately needed (I finally guessed right for once!), and
    now have a chance to slow, if not counterattack into, the AT menace.
    
    I am  disappointed that you continue to play the East like the Russians
    did outside Warsaw in August 1944, i.e., watch from a distance as loyal
    opposition guys get pounded by the enemy, and only then come in to
    "help."  I was hoping for help in either TYO or SIl this turn; the former
    to ensure no retreat route for Edi (and to help ensure Vienna's fall next
    season!)...the latter to help ensure the wall of defense in the East
    stayed strong.   I mean, if I were Edi, I'd go GAL-Sil next turn, with
    Rum-Gal.  This ensures they take WAR if so desired, and also puts them in
    a bid to take BER or MUN, should the opportunity arise, thus flanking
    your east.   I consider that a very viable option for Edi, Pitt.
    
    As it stands now, your stated goal -- for me to hold off the hordes -- is
    not exactly in synch with your observed actions.  Yes, there was the
    matter of France's status, but that seems crystal clear at present...
    Anyway, please consider doing "something" (in an anti-AT manner, of
    course) with A MUN; thanks, Pitt.
    
    We'll need to talk over the North.  Eng may try for Nwy with two (whuile
    you try for swe with two??), but I'm hoping you both realize the benefit
    in a strong Russian buffer up north.
    
    Not much else to say.  I have to figure what else to do with BOH (maybe
    grab Vie), as well as how to position the armies for a counterattack...I
    don't want to sit passively and await my (unsupported) fate....
    
    Let me know how you see all of this, and we can proceed from there.  Take
    care, Kaiser!

    King Jean
    I would assume you have "come off the fence" by virtue of your anti-Eng
    move to Iri last turn, as well as the apparent beginnings of a phased
    German withdrawal from France.  Can't say as I blame you (and thanks for
    not hitting Italy, btw).  It's naturally bad for me, because I see the
    anti-E as the eventual strengthening of the F/G--with me the logical
    victim of Pitt in the near-term.
    
    I'm ambivalent towards the death, as my goal is the stated breakup of AT
    and the hurting of at least one of my two game-long tormentors.  I had
    HOPED for German help in Tyo or Sil this turn...maybe next season, now
    that you two seemed to have tied the knot.
    
    Please try and help me stay alive for a few seasons more in the North.  I
    know Germany will want Swe and Nwy as future gains, and just for
    security, but I'm already in-place to slow down AT.  If he reduces me,
    they just move faster into MOS and WAR, wrecking his inadequate eastern
    flank, and threatening advance into STP.
    
    I can't help you stop the common AT threat if you're whittling me away at
    the same time,My Liege!
    
    Anyway, John, good hunting, and drop a line if you get time.  How do you
    see all of this unfolding?

    Edi
    I imagine that you and Hohn already worked out the BUL/RUM swap, to allow
    for three fleets to face off vs Cal, etc etc.  I'm a litle surprised that
    you didn't sit tight in TRi and then retreat to TYO, to force him to
    build another army (thus allowing a 3:2 fleet superiority), but ALB is
    also crucial to your defense at this stage, I reckon.
    
    You may wonder why it seems I'm so anti-Aus, but if you look things over,
    you'll noticer that your AT schemings have boxed me in; have given me NO
    concrete incentives to *not* keep fighting; and have now made it
    geographically inevitable that only anti-A actions seem viable.
    
    Given the impending firestorm over Nwy (Eng) and Swe (Ger) next season,
    I'd LOVE to divert attention west and north - but I could stand some move
    ideas or guarantees (real ones, for once) from you and Hohn.  Otherwise,
    it'll be "business as usual," with Pitt  gaining WAR and SWE in fall.
    You guys have rubbed my nose in the dirt with superior play the whole
    game; at best I'm a speedbump in the road.  But I'll wreck your
    undercarriage as a penalty, UNLESS you offer me something better than
    nothing.  Any ideas?

    The distant thundering noise of Russian hordes to the northwest in Bohemia
    were a minor distraction to BirSauron who once again called forth the Nine
    Riders to bring news of the world's attentions.
    
    The Russian's moves since their double reverse in Galicia and the Black Sea
    remains a puzzle to those around the Dark Empire.  Clearly the shift to
    Bohemia would tend to indicate but one intent and that of deliverance of
    Trieste to the Italians on a temporary loan.
    However what of the strategic options such a move entails.  One can hardly
    complain about the possibilities of active proposals from Vienna to Moscow
    when the Russian army acts in such a manner to reduce the strategic
    possibilities rather than increase them.
    
    As pointed out by the Arcane Advisory panel, had the Russians retreated to
    Silesia they would have been in a position to expect the negotiation of an end
    to the Dark War since there would have been possible cooperations to be had.
    
    Repeatively the Dark Tower has held to the demand that the Russians must
    vacate all Austrian soil and yet the Russians are inclined always to negotiate
    from a position where they hold the sacred soil.  One must grasp the options
    only after increasing them to more than a whisper of a nightmare.

    I hate to disagree, but I am fairly certain that if you took a typical
    lawyer (if there is such a thing) and put him on TV next to David
    Letterman, or Rosie that we could pretty easily determine who was the

    Well, truth to tell, I've been negotiating furiously with Hohn for the
    last two years, up to and including one very long phone call before the
    Fall moves.  I pointed out that he could get limited centres from you
    and Edi was between me and him.  His long term prospects are better in
    the Balkans at least in terms of centres.  Unless he's a very good liar
    on the phone (a possibility), he seemed very interested.  All he wanted
    was to make sure you weren't a threat any longer (as he had said all
    along).
    
    The Fall results weren't exactly as I had hoped for, but they were close
    enough.  A note from Hohn earlier today indicated that he still wants to
    do the attack, probably starting this turn.

    Of course, I can't be absolutely sure of that.  This COULD be a ruse on
    Hohn's part and I haven't ruled that out.  However, the way I figure it,
    if they ARE pulling a ruse, I'm dead anyway.  The alternative is to
    listen
    to Edi who is still trying to get me to go to Eastern Med...
    
    I'll stick with this, I think.

    Thanks for your two notes.  Yes indeedy, I was looking for Viennese
    support this turn from Tri.    As for War-Gal, let me mull it over.  It
    _is_ the logical move, ASSUMING Hohn and Edi aren't still a team.
    
    I mean, I just rec'd a note from Hohn; all of a sudden he's a "convert"

    winkle me out of position...especially after Hohn suggested I build F

     I like the idea, I really do.  And if Hohn is with us, then it really
    makes Edi's life damn miserable for the next couple turns.   I'm just
    hesitant at this stage to leave the Fassio Line in the event this is yet
    another AT fib to lure me out of the final bunker.
    
    Same thing goes for you, Cal.  Make sure AT aren't trying any ploy they
    can to sucker your fleets and lull you to sleep, so they don't have to
    fight their way through a wall they can't penetrate!     (Heh heh...this

    Hello Hohn
    Thanks for the upbeat reply!  Without sounding like an ingrate, you
    probably understand my suspicions and/or doubts that you've suddenly
    become an "anti-Austrian convert."  Having said that, though,  I
    definitely would like to see this come about.  I may be wrong on this,
    but I somehow suspect the A/T was an alljance after-the-fact, whereas I
    *really* smell the stink of an A/G here...dunno why.
    
    I'm building  two armies this turn and will stand pat, other than going
    for Vienna (or hitting GAL) this turn.  If and when the stab comes (i.e.,
    if Ukr-Rum is really going to happen in spring), then you've converted me
    and we're on the march!
    
    If Pitt his me in spring, he'll have to contest a retreat to BAL and
    subsequent hit on Ber, so I think he may wait until fall.  (Eng may be
    the worse one, with two fleets on Nwy!)   Once I see you out of UKR, then
    you can bet your bippy I'm be much more amenable to Pru or Sil
    movements...Germany cannot defend the flank if I'm not defending it for
    him, or if you and I make the move...but if we do, Edi *must* be reduced
    another 2 or 3, IMO--me in Vie, you in Bud/Rum (eventually Gre), Cal
    inTri...
    
    Anyway, Hohn, you're saying the words I want to hear, but let me see the
    moves in a spring turn; then I'm in your camp come fall.  Count on me
    defending this turn (this also allows me to hover near Nwy for any
    autumnal battles.
    
    Sound ok?

    I suspect that Mark's days are numbered and the number isn't
    particularly
    high given that E/G can pretty well eviscerate him.

    Okay, I think that despite our builds, we are still in good position to
    continue anti-Austrian maneuvers.  I can keep Trieste this turn for
    sure and probably the Fall as well.  If you move to the Aegean we'll
    be able to take both those centres (Bul/Gre).  Any other suggestions?

    I think I was the last person in with builds.  Should have used SET
    WAIT,
    I guess.  Oh well, doesn't matter now.
    
    Waiting for your comments.

    Jim,
    
    Thoughts on this past turn.
    
    Grr.  Edi was right about what Mark might do.  I'd really hoped to
    knock Mark down to 4 and build Edi up to 6.  As it stands, I still
    think it turned out OK, although in a different sense.  If things had
    gone as originally hoped, Edi and I would be doing well, and it would
    make staying with him an easy decision.  There will always be a ripe
    opportunity for T to stab A in an AT.
    
    Now, I have to consider cutting Edi loose, given the positioning.
    It's earlier than I might want, especially since I consider Mark to be
    very unreliable, and Cal to be a wild card that I don't completely
    trust.  (Well, when can you ever completely trust _anyone_ in
    Diplomacy...but in any case, I have a lower than average level of
    trust for Cal, right now...hopefully, that will change.)
    
    I have little doubt that Cal and I could dice Edi up very quickly.
    The kicker is going to be builds.  If he does carry through with his
    threat to build F NAP, then I will probably stay with Edi.  If he
    builds A VEN, I might stab Edi.  Regardless, I will build F SMY.  I
    will use "oh, I got your message too late" as an excuse if he decides
    to build A VEN, and I suspect we will still be able to work
    together...but with me in the position of naval superiority.
    
    Some might argue that the converse position is called for, that given
    a stalemate of fleets in ION, I should break the impasse by stabbing
    Edi.  And that given the opportunity to make headway against Cal in
    the Med, I should do that.  The latter argument is a reasonable one,
    and I might accept that reasoning.  But the former argument is not
    compelling, at least not to me.  The reason is that I've played Turkey
    a million times before.  It's my second favorite country behind
    France, and I seem to draw Turkey more than any other country.  And as
    Turkey, I can safely play the waiting game.  Much more safely than
    pretty much any other nation.  So long as Cal can't make headway
    against me, and without the army build that he will need to make
    further gains against Edi, I can sit back and hold my Black Sea
    possessions and watch as France eventually turns on Cal, or until Edi
    can retake his country.  Meanwhile, I can possibly make gains against
    Mark.  I can't comfortably attack Edi when Cal is poised to move on
    against me after Edi is gone.
    
    Hmm.  Builds have just processed.  Oh well, looks like I will stay
    with Edi, since Cal built a fleet.  That's fine.  Now the war to
    retake the Austrian homeland should reach a more favorable conclusion.
    And I think Edi and I can still work together well.
    
    Hohn
