    There is also the infamous (in some circles at least) Hall of Fame which
    I produce.  It currently contains the results of over 1200 games finished
    up to September 1996.  I have another 350 games finished since then that
    I am yet to process.  The main list has a breakdown by player
    so you can can see all his games, and results.
    
    Summaries and histories (a history is an archive of what an observer
    would see in a game), are stored for most games at the judge they were
    played on.

    Well, sort of easy.  It seemed easy when there were 40 or 50 games
    finished every year, but now we are up to 5-10 games being finished
    every day it's starting to get out of control.

    I would say that it varies a lot.  This is expected, because E-Mail access
    is variable and ideosyncratic for all of us.  In these "long" deadline
    games, everything seems to happen in pulsating flurries.  Think of how
    most of you do things.  You sign on and send six messages at once.
    Two people might read those quickly and send a flurry of replies.
    
    Then, when deadline approaches, you have to send in the final orders,
    so, yes, there does tend to be a closing flurry UNLESS everyone already
    is set (which can happen at different times in games).
    
    Demo games like these also tend to raise concern about what the volume
    actually is.  Unlike FTF, you can't observe "X and Y are talking", but
    unlike PBM you can get an impression of how people respond to correspondence
    at least in how and when they reply to you.  Variants where the volume of
    correspondence is "public" or even "controlled" have been proposed.  With
    public volume counts, there obviously are ways to distort it by blizzards
    of blank messages.

    Yes, and yes.  This is not something I've done a lot with myself,
    so I am not the best one for advice.  Manus Hand's www dip szine The
    Diplomatic Pouch has all of the relevant connections.... ummm,
    it just moved so I don't recall it off the top of my head anymore, but
    isn't it at http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch  ??? Manus is observing here
    and will be sure to correct that if it's wrong.  Mark Nelson and others
    have done lots of analysis on openings frequencies.

    Well, in principle it's trivial, to organize it and make it
    "accessible" in an easy way?  That's hard.

    It's a secret plan, Rick, don't worry.  See, both the Celts and Dabroonz
    are going to finish in the cellar (and, in so doing, Dabroonz wil break a
    professional sports record for most consecutive years in post-season
    play...Yay!...another Boston record).  Then they'll both get the 1st pick
    in the draft but, in a totally unexpected move, Bob Kraft will buy both
    teams, trade them to New York (which doesn't have any pro sports teams) in
    exchange for Bill Parcells.  With Parcells back, of course, the Patsies win
    the Super Bowl in 1998.

    The Viennese press is well taken, and this observer wishes to even the

    Let me expand upon my earlier reply to the YogFather, and all his
    ruminations (don't cows ruminate when they rechew their udders?  Or am I
    thinking of udder things???)
    
    The Ed-Master speaks of Southern Powers, Wrst Pointers, and whatnot.
    Let us all heed the call of history, and recall that peter the Great (my
    father) was a Westernizer who brought much power to Russia...He even
    spent time as a common shipbuilder in Holland, learning the  intricacies
    of western work and ideas.  (Hmmm, Pitt, this gives me an idea--can I
    have HOL this game?)
    
    So indeed, Russia *should* be "Pointing West" for her rendezvous with
    karma.  The last time we heard about Southern Power was, sadly(?),
    around 1863....my apologies to those of you with "Forget H***" bumper
    stickers on your pickup trucks.

       The scribes at the Palantir Network Broadcast System  (PNBS) were stunned
    at the recent discovery in Central Europe of a  character called Yog.  Seems
    the young fellow was having some problems with a door way and could not manage
    to walk through it.  Something about his gait.  It would normally be
    recommended that he take a change of pace.
       Meanwhile the confusion seems to have spread as far as Saint Petersburg
    where the Tzar has surrounded himself by so many Western Observers that he has
    lost sight of the fact that the very first origin of International Relations
    was dealing with the divinities amongst the first people.  These observers are
    so intent on their perception of the things Western that they are now called
    West Pointers much to the disappointment of the Southern Powers where the
    civilization that they admire originated.
       That the worlds great social and poltical efforts were first seen in the
    fantastic stories of legendary characters and struggles is often lost on those
    who have been given the scriptures by Marx, Lasswell, McMahon and the host of
    others who seek science in the politic of nations when we are really dealing
    with the imagination of men.  Bring on your Orcs and wayward Yogi's for
    through the psyche of it all we shall cover the droll analysis with a shroud
    of sparkling fun to entertain and confound those who shall stumble upon the
    efforts of all here most humble.

    Loyal Doge
    Doubtless you've already 'greased this' with Edi, but be advised:  he
    intends to sail Alb-Ion this turn, and do 1-on-1 walk-ins to Ser and Gre
    with the armies.
    
    I'm NOT saying this to muck things up by throwing out paranoia.  I know
    in my heart of hearts that Edi is fixated on killing Turkey, and will
    not consider the westward movement (army convoy to Apu, seizure of Tun,
    etc) that could come from this.  I mean, that scenario would then also
    see him hit me with Turkey this turn, assuming some A/T collusion.
    Again, I don *not* see that happening.   I see Ion-Aeg in spring,
    combined with Ser and Bul hitting Bul and me hitting Arm/Ank.
    
    So why am I writing, you may ask?  Two reasons:
    1) As a tried-and-ture no-kidding ally, I want to pass along whatever
    else I've heard--to include from other allies.
    2) If Edi didn't clue you in, then perhaps there's some collusion going
    on.  (That's me--always the muckraker!)
    
    Regardless of the above, I'd appreciate you treating this 'discreetly,'
    so we can continue our mutual info-sharing???  Thanks, Doge.
    
    On the A/R front:  Given Edi's plans, I am pretty much resigned to using
    Sev-Arm for the bounce, and support myself to Rum this turn.  (or
    perhaps support to Arm, and just go Ukr-Rum unsupported...Much depends
    on Turkey's intent, so if you hear from him, let me know, ok?).  Thanks.

    Kaiser Pitt
    Greetings on this sunny Monday!   Hope you've mulled over my last e-mail
    (regarding Scandinavia and France), and hope that life is treating you
    well.
    
    Just a short note this go-around....
    The assault on Turkey goes well.  I'm unsure how to play it further.  In
    balance-of-power respects, I should now move to Gal and support Sev-Rum
    with Black, allowing Turkey egress to Aeg and  disrupting the A/I (I'm
    sure there is one).   From a "feeding frenzy" aspect, though, I should
    press on with Edi and try to hit Hohn.  In that regard, I could ask Edi
    to do:   Alb-Gre, Ser S Ukr-Rum, and Bla S Sev-Arm.  This gets us
    surrounding Hohn, guarantees me Rum (and Edi still gets Gre, as Hohn
    will never try for a 1-on-1 bounce with Bul in danger), and keeps
    Turkey's coastal provinces occupied/bounced, to prevent a second fleet
    build.
    
    Do YOU have any ideas/suggestions?  (I mean, I'm generally pushy enough
    to 'run" someone else's country when I see a good move for them, so
    what's good for the goose, is good for the gander...)  One option
    ensures chaos down south (everyone still equal and having opportunity),
    the other offers A/R growth, but more "A" than "R."  It's a tough
    call--I mean, I have nothing against Hohn....decisions, decisions.
    
    How about you, Pitt?  What's percolating through the Germanic mind?  F
    Den stands poised to bounce me, or hold Den, or sail to Nth (if you've
    decided to "save" France from pincer powers that may next turn on you).
    I imagine Kie-Hol (vs Fra, or convoy potential someday), and perhaps
    Mun-Ruh???  (doubtful that John will strike for Mun when Bel, Ruh, and
    Mar are in danger of being invaded).  As with me, you have a variety of
    options and concerns to consider; I wish you well in your endeavors!
    
    Drop a line when you get time, ok?

    Edi,
    Just read this msg; good ideas, as always.  (In fact, I opened with your
    option Ion-Gre-Ser in a new game start just last month.   It provides
    many nice options.)
    
    Will indeed make it a guessing game over Arm or Ank. I'm tempted to
    either support to Arm, or try to slide into Ank.  If you dicuss things
    further with Hohn and he seems to be "in your orbit," pass him along
    some sort of bum dope, and I'll do the opposite.
    
    Here's to the assault.  Even if something doesn't go exactly right in
    fall, you and I will still have the death grip on BUL and Aeg next
    season, guaranteed.

    Hi Edi
    Thanks for the notes...was beginning to get a bit paranoid myself, not
    hearing from you!  Hope Houston was enjoyable.
    
    As for the moves:  yes indeed, I "missed" a few options.  as I said in
    the first note, there are indeed "tons" of options out there -- I only
    "tunnel-visioned" on the immediate "seam" where our units converged, in
    the hopes of denying Hohn a build.  The other options you described are
    equally (or more) valid than my ideas (altho' I imagine Italy would
    cringe if he saw Alb-Ion, for example).
    
    Turkey is indeed upset, and that's fine; I'm not out for popularity
    contests.  if he's mad because of the amount of "e-mail investment,"
    then that's the wrong reason.  That's just one way I play the game
    (heavy correspondence), and he did everything he should have, by the
    book.  I just chose you as a partner--nothing to lose sleep over for
    him.  Still, this can be made into a good advantage for us.
    
    if he offers you support for RUM, let him give it!  It'll prevent him
    from bothering you, and then it comes down to a guessing game for he and
    I over Ank, or Arm.  He has already said that he wants me to join him
    and move to Gal and Rum (Bla S), and he'd then hit Gre. He also said
    that if I hit him, he'd suicide and throw everything against me and help
    you.  Again, good psychological fodder for us to use against him when
    you "offer help" against me.  All it takes is a couple turns for us, and
    we'll be in a good stranglehold position.
    
    Anyway, that's the quick and dirty for now.  Let me know if you have
    other ideas/suggestions, and I'll assume we're going the "conservative"
    move for our respective centers....

    I have heard from Edi, but only (about three hours) after I got your
    message last night (Sunday pm). He didn't say much, just gave me some
    helpful suggestions on how to proceed against France.

    Hey Guys
    Just a quick paranoid-type question from the nervous Tsar...
    have either of you heard from Germany or (more importantly) Austria?  I =

    the spring turn, or at least a critique of my move proposals vs Turkey =

    also bodes ill, methinks.

    Thanks for the missive.  I did indeed hear from Edi--twice,
    actually--today.  He was apparently in Houston on weekend business.  Did
    much to reduce my paranoia.
    
    Edi is (slightly) risking a build, but making a good tactical move:
    Alb-Ion, Tri-Ser, Ser-Gre.  Unless Hohn bounces him (Bul-Gre), which he
    won't (can't) have the kahunas to do, Edi gets his two AND gets into
    position for the move to Aeg and on Bul in spring.
    
    For me, I'm now debating whether to support myself to Arm or to Rum.
    Looks like Hohn will go +1 this season, but hopefully it'll be his last.
     He's pledged to suicide out against me, which will allow Edi to get the
    lion's share (as well as threaten Cal with that F Ion someday), but
    that's the perils of the game.
    
    Still no word from Germany, or from Hohn as of late (he's asking me to
    join him)...beginning to wonder who's colluding with who....Hopefully
    Pitt will make nice and not bother either of us.

    Edi,
    
    Thanks for the tactical advice. Believe me, I've thought about the
    possibilities. I have many of them.
    
    At the moment I'm most concerned with Germany's disposition. Since my F Nth
    is obviously bound for Nwy, I am worried about F Den-Nth. The problem is
    that Pitt has been so quiet that I really have no idea what he's up to; it
    could be as simple as covering his ass, as you point out, but it could be
    something unpleasanter for me. Having gotten me committed to a strongly
    anti-French campaign, and Russia to the south, he might expect to get a
    good jump on me by taking Nth. Of course, my comfort is that he'd get only
    a single build, what with his A Mun totally out of position. Doesn't seem
    very Pitt-like.
    
    Please let me know *anything* you hear from Pitt.
    
    Cheers!

    Kaiser, I can surely understand your suspicion toward me.  You had one
    solid piece of evidence (my preliminary orders) and you went with it.  When
    you stopped communicating, I figured that's what you'd do, so I played a
    defensive opening.  You've done a fine job of lining everyone up against
    me, too.  But I wonder if your interests will be so well served when Italy
    and England gain rapidly at my expense while you get next to nothing.
    Personally, I think it highly unlikely that they will cut you in for a fair
    share.  They are natural allies, while you always cause them to worry.
    
    With that in mind, I hope we can reverse the disastrous course we are on.
    As you can see, I am in dire straits, so I am open to almost any
    constructive suggestion.

    Hi, Mark, I'm popping this message back to you because it seemed
    to have been cut off at the end (probably just the very last line).
    I can see (in my mind's eye) your dart board with my bright shining
    face on it asking yourself the question, "why did I let Burgess
    talk me into this anyway????"  A wilder game could barely be imagined
    by me, which means it's sure to get better into the Mid-Game.  No boring
    stalemated game coming here.  I do appreciate all of the effort you
    have put into it, if it is any consolation, I had a very similar set
    of experiences in ghods (the first demo game in this series).  We'll
    see how it turns out and I'll tell you more then.  About the only
    part I think I can tell you is what you already know, that your first
    E-Mail game is a a rush and an entirely different experience from any
    previous Dip games.  Keep track of those experiences.  You've been
    writing a lot of detail so I can clearly see where you are, but later
    you might not be able to remember where you've been, if you get my

    Pitt
    Many thanks for the long-awaited note!  Paranoia running as rampant as
    it is here in Russia, I began to worry when I didn't hear from you.  So
    I'm "happy" that it was due to mechanical problems (you catch my drift
    here, I'm sure...better hardware problems than evil intent).
    
    Ref the historynet info:  what prize did you win in Jan?  Yes indeed,
    I'm a history buff--was my Undergrad major in college, and the thrust of
    my Masters.  I was one of those scrawny teenagers who played wargames,
    read Sgt Rock comic books, and preferred a history book to a date for
    tjhe prom (Mom always worried about me...).  It's a love-in.
    
    For the game:
    I'll be up-front with you:  I can't commit to building a F StP(nc) yet.
    The reason:  I'm unsure as to the south.  Originally this started out as
    an A/R vs T thing, but now I'm hearing that Hohn is offering Edi support
    to Rum.  Is it bluff?  Hohn propaganda designed to defuse the threat?
    Truth?  Don't know!  Even if A/R remain together on this, what happens
    if I try for Arm, and Turkey gets bold enough to bounce me in Rum (I
    plan to go there unsupported, and move Sev-Arm, Bla S)?  He
    could--theoretically--bounce me in both RUM and ARM, giving me just one
    build (Swe), and forcing me to do a full-court press down south.  A
    Fleet StP(nc) IMMEDIATELY sends the red flag to England and commits me
    to a possible two-front war-- with me unsure as to (a) the quickness (or
    inevitability) of Turkey's demise, and (b) no knowledge of how chummy
    these guys are all.  Overstretched and unsupported.
    
    Tell you what, though:  depending on Turkey's dance with me, and what
    E/I finally do with France, I'll consent to a HEAVY consideration of
    building "north" (Mos/StP) as a balance to their growing power.  It's
    not exactly what you want, and it still sends bad ju-ju vibes to
    England, but I'll look at it with great detail.  I want a balance up
    north, Pitt.
    
    That desire for "balance" led me to ask about your French intentions.
    If you're joining in the feast of French flesh, then all's ok, *until*
    E/I lick their chops for their next, adjacent neighbor--you.  Hence my
    desire for a "sure" build (Swe), to both reduce Turkey and provide some
    needed counterweight to the north.   As a Russian, I have a great belief
    in the survival of G and I in games, but with the possible unbridled
    growth of the Doge (could there even be an E/I/A or combination
    thereof?), your security now becomes "mind-melded" with mine.  Hortas
    included.
    
    I hope this didn't sound like the "brush-off" to you, ref StP.  I will
    help you, and I do want growth and cooperation, Pitt.  For 1901 and
    maybe early 1902, we can afford to putz around with the Frances and
    Turkeys, but the builds from '01 will allow me to concentrate up there
    with you as we get into the early mid-game (or when the threat to us
    becomes so blatant as to warrant action).
    
    THANK YOU for Sweden, and count on continued Russian friendship.

    Whew.
    
    I was getting nervous.
    
    OK, then we're still on. Good, I would really hate to waste such a
    successful stab of France by changing my target instantly :).
    
    Your options are limited, what with that army stuck in Mun. The obvious
    move is just Mun-Bur, Kie-Hol, Den H. I can't see anything better.
    
    You might discuss things with Italy, especially that Mun-Bur move. France
    surely must order Bur-Mar; if Italy orders Pie H, then France can't build F
    Mar (so that's good for Italy) and you'll be in Burgundy, which is
    obviously your only entry point. If Bre is open in the Winter, France would
    probably build a fleet there, but I can deal with that if you guys are set
    to crawl all over his other territory, and you would be.
    
    Let's see. I think I'd like to get plans a bit clearer for the future, so
    as to avoid the sort of uncomfortableness I've been having about your Den
    move. (For a short while I actually thought you might be planning Den-Nth,
    since I'm obviously going to try to vacate Nth. But then I realized you'd
    only get one build, and if you then built a fleet, you'd be skinned alive
    next year. That realization made me very happy.)
    
    For the winter, I would be glad if you didn't build F Kie. If you have any
    winter requests for me, let me know and I'll entertain them.
    
    If it's all the same to you, I guess I won't say what my plans for the
    current moves are. There are many options for me, any one of which would be
    fine if I guess right. I have to gauge how France is feeling. If it were me
    under this kind of attack, I think I'd go to Spain and Portugal and hope
    not to lose Brest. Then I'd dig in and do what I could do avoid
    annihilation, hoping that someone would change courses in time to save me.
    But, the alternative of trying to punish England is also something to
    consider; Bur-Bel, MAO-Bre, Mar-Bur?
    
    
    
    
    Thinking ahead:
    
    It would be really nice to make very short work of France, since the
    southeast looks like it will settle out rapidly (unless Turkey gets some
    lucky guesses). I guess I see it this way. What we *don't* want is a
    concerted I/R/A effort to cross the stalemate line in Gibraltar and swarm
    all over you through the center. With peace between G and E, any other
    further alignment seems ok to me. We could do you and me against Russia, me
    by sea and you by land, with Italy facing off against Austria. Then we'd
    choose which one of A or I to help a bit; either a fleet of mine bothering
    Italy, or an army of yours nagging Austria. Or we could have you and Russia
    teaming up on Austria with me bashing away against Italy around Gibraltar;
    not too promising, really, but ultimately ok if the team can stick together
    long enough. Maybe best of all would be to have you, me, and Edi allied and
    working toward an endgame. That would work very well *if* Austria starts
    building fleets right away, otherwise you and he would get in one another's
    way too much, I think.
    
    We'll have to see how the other players seem disposed.
    
    Cheers!

    Hi again Edi
    While I probably know the answer to this even before I write, let me go
    ahead and (re)propose the question to you, just for grins:
    
    Any chance you'd consider using Serbia to support my Ukr-Rum?
    
    I ask for a variety of reasons:
    1) Our main goal is the rapid reduction of Turkey, right?  Seems to me
    we'd go a lot more toward that objective if we had me support Sev-Arm
    with Black Sea, and had you support me to Rum.  (Remember, I stand a
    good chance of being bounced in Sweden.  Turkey thinks he's allied with
    me--or says he is--and if he tries to get cute and go Bul-Rum, then I
    could, just could, go zero builds in '01.)
    2) Me using the "sure" move of Sev-Rum (Ukr S) is ok, but, as in #1
    above, doesn't give us the rapid, full effect of being simultaneously in
    Rum, Ser, Bla and Arm.  Even Alb-Ion still means two turns to get into
    the Turk hinterland, whereas Arm is already there.
    3) Originally I was hesitant to ask you, because I assumed Ser S
    Alb-Gre.  But if you're just going to Gre unsupported anyway, then
    you'll still get your two (Ser and Gre)...you just won't have the F Ion.
    4) And, to repeat something from last note, if we're serious about
    hitting Germany with your Tri-Tyo, Vie-Boh plan (and I need a build if
    I'm putting something in War to help!), then you *already* have the A
    Tri in-place.  You could "hold" there and obfuscate everyone's view of
    what's going on vis a vis Italy and you, and STILL move "as planned" in
    S02, no?
    
    I don't know, maybe I'm just getting paranoid.  But Turkey says he
    accepts my "offer of alliance" (I told him I'm moving Ukr-Gal, Bla S
    Sev-Rum).  He says he "might" tap me in Bla, as well as "might" move to
    Arm...doesn't know yet.  Is this all bluff, and will he just hold in Bul
    with support?  Anybody's guess.  (Wouldn't hurt if you 'accepted' his
    offer of Ser-Rum.)
    I just envision a sharp Turk trying to "one-up" me and bouncing an
    unsupported RUM move while also moving to Arm in the hopes of a bounce,
    and then I'm SOL **and** our blitz slows down appreciably...all when it
    could've been avoided by some timely Serbian support.
    
    Of course, that's the view from St Petersburg...I was just curious what
    the view is from Vienna?  Does any of this make sense and/or strike a
    sympathetic chord?

    Thank you.  I am indeed a history buff and I'm pleased to find that you
    are, as well.  Regarding the Star Trek question I asked you previously, the
    Horta was a rock-eating, tunnel-making, acid-spitting creature in an early
    ST episode.  It was killing Federation miners for no apparent reason.  The
    Enterprise crew was called in to assist and were trying to find it and kill
    it when Spock mind-melded with it (first use of mind-meld) and discovered
    that it was killing miners because they were destroying its eggs (silicon
    spheres found throughout the tunnels and previously thought to be worthless).
    
    Aren't you glad you asked...;-)
    
    >Your opening move could be construed as pro-E
    
    Yes...
    
    >anti-R
    
    Not at all (no matter how much Tiurkey keeps trying to get me to agree to
    bounce you in SWE).
    
    >merely CYA
    
    Yep!
    
    >Anyway, Pitt, I'm hoping there is still no problem regarding Swedish
    >ownership for the Tsar?
    
    No problem at all.  In fact, let me go you one better.  Given the sudden
    development of the EI, I am a bit concerned about my long term relationship
    with England.  If France does indeed die a quick death, I may well be
    caught between the EI pincer.  I'd prefer to have another ally willing to
    come to my aid - that is, Russia, sweeping in from the north.  To that end,
    I'd like to see one of your 1901 builds be a fleet STP/nc.  What do you think?
    
    >Either he's [John] a *very* good actor who's hiding the real story, or
    >he's truly abjectly demoralized and defeated already.
    
    Jury's out here.  I've had word that there is a secret EF and that the
    opening was a ruse designed to reinforce France's "plight".  On the other
    hand, Italy's opening looks to counter that rumor.  I'm taking the "wait
    and see" approach.
    
    >Bottom line:  I always wish G/R peace; I always wish Swe (yuk yuk); and
    >I always stand ready to assist you if needed/desired.
    
    My sentiments exactly.  Please let me know what you think about my

    two (unreliable?) sources that there is a secret EF and the English opening
    was a ruse to reinforce France's plight.  France's moanings and groanings
    only serve to make me more suspicious.  On the other hand, E, F & I all
    opened anti-France, so maybe France really is in a pickle.  I'm going to
    play it safe and see what happens.
    
    >I was wondering if you have any preference about moves in F'02.  My gut

    I think that's a good idea regardless of whatever els ehappens.  So long as
    you don't feel a need to be concerned about Austria, you should hit France
    hard.  If he and England are allied, I'll be there to help.  If they're
    not, the three of us can make short work of France and move on to other
    pursuits.

    John,
    
    Hello again.  Long time no word for the German front, eh?  I apologize for
    my extended silence.  I had ISP/email problems from before the last turn
    processed until just after and, since then, I have been swamped at work and
    I've just not had time to do much.  I am now able to get back in the swing

    >Kaiser, I can surely understand your suspicion toward me.  You had one

    Well, that and the fact that you didn't reply when I sent it back to you
    saying I saw it but was still open minded.  I interpreted your lack of
    response as a guilty conscience.
    
    >When you stopped communicating, I figured that's what you'd do, so I played a

    Looks like we both had suspicions that could have been allayed by better

    I wonder that, too.  Especially since England was primarily responsible for

    Loyal Doge (good thing we put an "e" at the end of it, huh?)
    Thanks for your two e-mails.  Much of what i wrote is obviously OBE by
    now (Overtaken By Events).   Turkey has accepted my "request for
    alliance" (cackle), or at least SAYS he will.  Plans on "possibly"
    covering Arm and "possibly" tapping Bla--he doesn't know yet.  All
    bluff?  Who knows?  I'll either support myself to Rum for one sure build
    (may need to, given Germany's threat over Swe) or gamble and support to
    Arm (the better move).  Sure would've been nice if Edi could've provided
    support to Rum from Ser...if he was really serious about finishing off
    the Turk quickly, that's what I would've done--especially as he's going
    to try for Gre with just one piece anyway!
    
    Yeah, my paranoia seems misguided, given that he told you about the
    fleet to Ion.  As long as we're all singing from the same sheet of music
    here...
    
    Not much else for now.  Guessing game between me and the Turk, and
    anxiously awaiting any info from the Kaiser...most unsettling with him.
    
    Take it easy, Cal, and let's hope for even better '01 success.   Any

    Hi Hohn
    Thanks for the note and the decision!  Just a couple quick comments (I
    have to run off to teach):
    > I can
    >promise you, however, that if I decide to tap F BLA, I will
    >also order BUL S UKR-RUM, so that UKR-RUM will succeed even
    >if Edi orders SER-RUM, as he's been considering.  I can also

    >and if you've done as you've said, then I'll definitely

    1) If I'm moving _Sev_-Rum, shouldn't BUL be supporting him?  Or do you
    want me hanging around in Sev and not moving Ukr-_Gal_?
    2) I have serious doubts that Edi is mulling over any RUm move, unless
    you guys have been planning this double whammy all along.  In fact, the
    current plan is for us to either hit BUL, (forcing you to support Bul
    with Con while Edi goes Alb-Gre) or for Edi to support me to Rum while I
    support myself to Arm, thus completing the garrot.  (He is a lot more
    anti-T than his 1901 moves indicate, as you're probably discovering.)
    Still, any diplomacy is possible, and hey, never hurts to try.   I may
    be the one to wake up with a blade in my back!
    3) The Armenia move option is, in my opinion, less than optimal, and
    raises the paranoia hackles probably moreso than needed.  Nonetheless,
    you're within your (trust) perogative to go where you deem necessary.
    I'll take it with a grain of salt.
    
    Ok, then, you've got my moves, and I've got an inkling of your intent.
    Italy is indeed off carousing vs France, so perhaps now's the time to
    go.   If there's any last-minute stuff needing clarified, or if the urge
    arises, I'll write again before the moves, I'm sure.
    
    Take care, Hohn.  here's to surprising the pundits!

    Admittedly, the move to Ionian (and for that matter your move to
    Trieste) did make me
    nervous, but as I said in the last message, you're not going to attack
    me for one centre and the overall strategy you've outlined is solid for
    the long term.  I'm in.

    I just wanted to see what you had planned for the Trieste army.  I'm
    satisfied that it's going to Serbia, so I'll go ahead and convoy.  That
    is definitely the better positional move.

    Yeah, he told me.  I was surprised because I wasn't expecting this, but
    I've
    told him to go ahead.  If Edi plans to stab me, it won't be for one
    lousy

    I'm pretty sure that Hohn will simply support himself in Bulgaria this
    turn
    but it probably depends on how panicky he feels right now.  If he wants
    to
    merely shit-disturb, it might be impossible to predict his moves.  I'd
    probably try to take Rum unsupported and force Armenia, but it would be
    a
    gamble and with Germany in Sweden... hmmm
    
    Speaking of Germany, I still haven't heard from him.  Nada.  Rien.
    Zilch.
    And there's no "can't access the net on weekends" excuse.  Maybe he just
    hasn't gotten around to it, but I'll let you know if I hear from him
    
    Later

    Must admit I did a double take when I saw "Ionian" in that sentence...
    I didn't know that was part of the plan, but I am assuming that fleet
    will be heading to Aeg or Eas, no? (not that you'd tell me if it was
    headed for Nap...grin)  If so, I have no problem with this.  You're not
    going to stab me for one lousy centre!  As for the whole of your moves,
    I agree with your obvious guesstimate that Hohn will simply support
    Bulgaria in place.  Go for it.

    That's about what I figured to do.  I don't see him moving Bur-Mar
    because that would imply his total retribution against me.  I don't
    think he has any more reason to be mad at me than at England or Germany.

    Cool.  I'll be holding my army in Venice (currently in Tuscany) until

    Mark,
    
    I received your most recent message with pleasure.  I hope
    we can work things out.  To this end, I am prepared to offer
    you certain assurances.
    
    I am, of course, going to cover my ass.  I'm not certain in
    what manner I will do so yet.  And in light of your Spring
    1901 moves, I'm afraid I'm going to have to reserve the
    right to defend myself tactically as I best see fit.  I can
    promise you, however, that if I decide to tap F BLA, I will
    also order BUL S UKR-RUM, so that UKR-RUM will succeed even
    if Edi orders SER-RUM, as he's been considering.  I can also
    promise you that if I end up in ARM at the end of this turn,
    and if you've done as you've said, then I'll definitely
    build F SMY and demilitarize ARM immediately thereafter.  I
    think we both realize that the presence of A ARM will be no
    threat to you, what with you sitting in BLA.  I'm of course
    not saying that I _will_ move there.  It might all be a moot
    point.  But I have to reserve the right to do so, to keep
    you guessing in case you decide to stab me again.
    
    I hope you can live with those conditions, Mark.  I'm just
    trying to be as honest and forthright with you as possible,
    in an effort to build future trust.  I could have just
    agreed not to, and then done it anyway, but I don't want to
    do that.  I want to put us back on decent footing.
    
    It makes sense for us to work together, Mark.  Italy is off
    on his own, busy against France.  Together, the two of us
    can take Edi out.  That's inevitable; it'll just take some
    time.  Meanwhile, if you go against me, it's a guessing
    game.  If I get to build, you're going to have a hell of a
    time cracking me, unless you get Edi's help, and even then,
    I'll do my best to see that he gets the lion's share.
    There's also no guarantee that Edi will go with you instead
    of me.  We can effectively take him out of the equation
    completely if we work together.  It's a much better bet if
    you and I work together, IMO, Mark.
    
    Besides...in this demo game, wouldn't it be great to shock
    all of the observers?  It'd be icing on the cake! ;)

    Hi guys
    Well, heard from the German...his computer was down, and then he had
    weekend/weekday work.  All is well and he's "back in the saddle,"
    apparently.
    
    *CONFIDENTIAL*  He asked me if I'd consider building F StP(nc), given
    the apparent E/I forming.  I told him that my heart's with him, but that
    I have bigger fish to fry than starting an unprovoked war with England.
    So you guys seem to have at least attracted his attention (either that,
    or he's trolling for leads and links by testing my reaction).   I asked
    him his policy toward France, but don't expect much of a reply.  His
    builds will be the interesting indicator...
    
    Have asked Edi--again--to consider using Ser S Ukr-Rum.  I mean, if
    Edi's only using Alb-Ion and Ser-Gre (i.e., unsupported advances), then
    why not still go unsupported to Gre (Alb-Gre), use Ser to support the
    sure gain to Rum, and let me support Sev-Arm?  We'd have Turkey locked
    down tighter than a drum, and more quickly than Alb-Ion, Ion-Aeg,
    Aeg-wherever, under his plan.  I expect an enthusiastic reply (here, let
    me remove my tongue from the cheek area).  Given a probable negative
    reply, I intend on supporting myself to Rum for at least ONE sure 1901
    build (in the event Germany bounces me in Swe).  I'll then make a guess
    on Armenia...maybe bounce Ank-Arm and thus keep the coastal ports closed
    for a second Turk fleet build.  Any verbal pro-Russian cheerleading you
    guys can do to Edi would be appreciated.  I would like something in
    1901, and if we're going to polish off all comers, the quicker we get
    into position, the better.
    
    No word from F or T as of late.  Hohn did reply (last msg) that he's
    ready to ally, and expects me to honorably go to Gal and Rum this turn,
    with him reserving the right to hold, move to Arm, or even hit me in
    Bla, to be safe....sigh, nothing is easy.
    
    Other than that, not much to tell.  Germany seems to be going with the
    flow--no aggressive intent, a lot of CYA, etc etc...time will tell if
    that's really the case.
    
    I just hope you guys can kill France quickly, so you can turn about and
    help me out.  I don't think Hohn's going down quick, and Edi may be out
    more for himself than for the good of an A/R.  We'll see.
    
    Any news, views, or commentary?

    I think that's safe for the next turn or two.  Once France is definitely
    on the way down, we'll have to watch for him.  Of course, that will be
    the best time for Edi to hit him.

    My best guess as to what the perfect timing would be is like this:
    
    1- France and Turkey down to few enough centres that they are not
    factors.
    2- Edi goes north to Boh, Sil.
    3- Germany turns around from France to defend against Edi.
    4- Just as they reach full involvement (or close) we hit both of them.
    
    Ideally, England will have the biggest impact, hitting Pitt from behind
    with the lateral attacks on Edi by I/R having much the same effect.
    
    We'll obviously be playing it by ear, but these are probably the signs
    to watch for.

    It's certainly possible that there's an E/F extant, but I'd be surprised
    if it were so.  France seems really uninvolved in what's going on in the
    game.  He and I talked very early in the game and decided on
    non-aggression
    (well...) and then, several days later he wrote and asked me why we
    hadn't
    talked.  Seems to me that's a pretty good sign in inattention...

    COMPLICATED PLANS FOR SCENARIOS WITH A RELATIVELY SMALL PROBABILITY OF EVER
    OCCURRING: A SERIES
    
    Volume XII: Jumping Germany
    
    >Do we jump Pitt and Edi before John and Hohn are finished?
    >Seems like that only gives them common cause and a united front.  But if
    >we wait too long, then A and/or G are fairly strong anyway...This won't

    The main thing to keep in mind is this. At the moment Germany is attacked,
    we have to consider any remaining French units to be German by proxy. The
    earlier the jump, the larger the surprise element. Earlier: more 'proxied'
    units for Germany to use, more surprise. Too early, power of proxied units
    outweighs element of surprise. Too late, lost surprise not made good by
    extra Italo-English units.
    Solution:
    Plot Surprise element vs. Time and on the same sheet of graph paper, Proxy
    Power vs. Time. Jump 'im where the curves cross. :-)
    (I really should have been an economist. I have a flair for utterly useless
    formalisms.)
    
    
    Volume XXXI: Jumping Austria
    
    >Not to be
    >overly Machiavellian here, as Edi IS currently a loyal and indispensible

    Be no more, but no less, Machiavellian than he. (That ought to be enough
    for anyone.)
    
    >But if and when we jump him, I recommend (a) simultaneous I/R
    >hits (or else a one-turn delay, so we can play "good cop-bad cop" and

    >AFTER Edi takes the lead in traipsing through Boh and Tyo.
    
    Good point. We'd like to have as many Austrian and German units drawn
    toward the center of the board as possible, since we'll be attacking at the
    peripheries. A large gathering of German-speaking armies around Munich
    would be ideal.
    
    >  We should
    >have a field day in either coddling (or setting up) the astonished Hun
    >for a stab, or for proxy wars 'with us," while we plot their joint doom.
    
    Indeed. Say anything. I'll be busy 'plotting' with Germany to go after
    Scandinavia and Warsaw; you (Mark) conversely to attack me in Scand. and
    the northern seas and through France. And lots of other smoke, too; I'll
    have to be telling everyone who'll listen about my 'plans' to cross through
    the Straits of Gibraltar. We'll have to do this. Pitt certainly isn't going
    to wait quietly for France and Turkey to fall, expecting to take on two or
    three neighbors at once thereafter. He's going to want to have some
    assurance that he'll be on a good team for the next stage. Likewise Edi. If
    he thinks Italy and England will finish France and sail *away* from
    Gibraltar, he's practically guaranteed to strike (Italy) first.
    
    
    I guess planning for Scenarios with Small Probability is the only way to
    boost that probability.

    Gentle Rulers
    
    In reply to Jamie's note, I would state the obvious and say that "timing
    is everything" as regards I/R hits on A, and E/R/A hits on G.  MUCH (if
    not everything) depends on how fast (and to what extent) F and T get
    reduced.  Do we jump Pitt and Edi before John and Hohn are finished?
    Seems like that only gives them common cause and a united front.  But if
    we wait too long, then A and/or G are fairly strong anyway...This won't
    be easy.
    
    Of course, we should really "burn that bridge when we come to it," as
    I'm fond of saying.  I have enough trouble trying to keep Turkey at 4,
    let alone worrying about storming through Germany in 1902!    Not to be
    overly Machiavellian here, as Edi IS currently a loyal and indispensible
    ally...But if and when we jump him, I recommend (a) simultaneous I/R
    hits (or else a one-turn delay, so we can play "good cop-bad cop" and
    get him to overrely on his secondary stabber), and (b) we do all this
    AFTER Edi takes the lead in traipsing through Boh and Tyo.  We should
    have a field day in either coddling (or setting up) the astonished Hun
    for a stab, or for proxy wars 'with us," while we plot their joint doom.
    
    Again, though, much of this is only nice thinking.  France and Turkey
    are far from dead, and Pitt may actually support John, if he thinks I/E
    are next going to gun for him.
    
    Good hunting, you two, and let's keep the info flow going.

<p><a name=52></a><b>Private message from <font color=0000cc>England</font> to <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font>:</b><pre>
    I heard from Pitt, too, to much the same effect, very agreeable and mildly
    apologetic for the F Den.
    
    Until/unless further notice, I'll be proceeding on the assumption that
    Germany is friendly.
    
    Given Pitt's inquiry to Mark, I will, of course, have to assume that
    Germany will take any opportunity to get the jump on me. All that really
    means, I think, is that I'll have to make sure I occupy North Sea and that
    I can defend it in seasons ahead. Well, and assuming that I'm first into
    Belgium, I'll have to watch myself there, too.
    
    But all of this is more or less according to plan, after all. If Edi
    carries through with the promised moves against Munich, everything ought to
    be fine. As I imagine it, Cal and I would finish off France, I would jump
    in against Germany at the opportune moment (Spring '03?), and if possible
    Cal would wait until after I've done that to begin any campaign against
    Austria. In the mean time, Faz is finishing off Turkey, jumping in against
    Germany either right away ('02, when Edi attacks) or shortly after ('03,
    when I attack), and then opens another front against Austria when Cal does.
    
    Timing will be fairly important, as Mark has noted. There will be
    resentment among the three of us, I suspect, if (say) one of you leaves the
    other to fight Austria alone for long (or if Mark or I should leave the
    other struggling with Germany). Come to think of it, I may be wrong about
    the proper timing. Maybe it's best if Cal hits Austria at just the same
    time that I hit Germany. Hm. Well, we'll cross that bridge later, I guess.
    
    Cheers!

    Can't resist kibitzing.... as I think Jamie knows, I am an economist
    (in fact with my degree from where Jamie is teaching... at Brown)
    so Cal, you have to deal with all of these professors.... always
    trying to teach you something!  I can only add, in order to make the
    tradeoff work, you need Danny Loeb's valuations (or some other set of
    valuations from someone else's artificial intelligence diplomacy program)
    to give mathematical precision to the curves.  Digressing further, I've
    never quite gotten Danny to explain to me how his program solves this
    particular problem that Jamie proposes adequately.  All I know is that
    it has aspects of bidding games built into it, since that is Danny's
    research interest.

    Jim,
    I'll play the stooge here -- I have NO CLUE what the heck any of you
    economists and theorists are talking about!  I'm saying this all
    tongue-in-cheek, because I LOVE the press and the banter (and E/I are,

    encountered this game).  My econ classes were limited to figuring where
    those two lines (supply and demand?) intersected.  My grad school Econ
    Intro course had Dr Looney (nice name) basically say, "Don't worry about
    this stuff.  In a crisis?  Just print more money.")  My kinda guy.
    
    I love this stuff!

    "I've never quite gotten Danny to explain to me how his program solves
    this particular problem that Jamie proposes adequately."
    
    I don't think he does solve it adequately.
    
    Well, let me qualify that. I played a game in which one of the powers was
    played by Danny's program, but the human players were not told which power
    that was. (It was no-press, needless to say.) The play of the program was
    good enough so that it wasn't immediately obvious which it was (it was
    Italy), but toward the mid-game it made really awful moves, nonsensical
    ones. [In fact, I won that game, as Turkey, by leaving Italy alone,
    conquering Austria while Italy made silly moves interfering with Austria's
    defense, sailing past and invading France, then mopping up Italy in the
    ending. By far the easiest game I ever won; I was lucky to get Turkey!]
    
    Maybe he's improved it, I don't know.
    
    One way to solve that particular problem would be just to build in
    valuations for controlling the next center (the marginal value of centers),
    and also to have the program look ahead a few plies and evaluate positions
    (instead of having a fixed value of the element of surprise). Here the
    first problem would be figuring out what the marginal value of centers
    function *is*. Empirical research might help, but I doubt that it would be
    very decisive--you'd have to assume that the games you were looking at
    didn't include systematic mistakes by players, or you'd have to make some
    kind of judgment of what sorts of mistakes were likely. Horribly vague. A
    deeper problem would be that if the valuation is built into the program,
    presumably other players can eventually figure out what that valuation is,
    and then your program becomes too predictable, it could *never* make a
    surprise stab. I guess the only viable solution to that would be to include
    a randomizer (stab iff rand(0,1) > .5).
    
    Myself I think that tournaments and games *among artificial Dip players*
    could be interesting, but that we are very far from the day when an
    artificial player could do well in a game with real players.
    
    -Jamie
    p.s. Though no harm done, I think it's better if we don't continue to have
    separate conversations involving the master. There are too many subtle
    potential problems that could arise--for instance if you suddenly stopped
    responding when a certain question was raised that might tip someone off to
    the fact that that question was especially relevant in *this* game,
    something you might know only because of privvy information.... Other
    psychological factors, too.

    Whot???? Don't they teach any game theory to you military strategist
    types any more???  Ideally, these curves Jamie describes would be
    reaction functions incorporating Nash equilibrium properties (e.g.
    the French proxy assumption).  Even children in the playpen understand
    that as they compete to see who can get the most toys!!!

    So do I, it's not appropriate for l'il ol' me to do this, but anyone
    is free to take any of this to broadcast press if they wish -- including

    Ultimately, there are two dimensions to the problem that are hard:
    
    1) When to employ mixed strategies (randomization)
    
    2) How to build Nash behavior in with more than two players (You
    benefited in the demo game by the  fact that the game was unable
    to consider Turkey an enemy while it was concerned with Austria).

    My intention is not to write anything that would not be appropriate
    for broadcast.  Obviously, I felt somewhat safe discussing artificial
    intelligence (and going "personal" as I did in the follow up)
    since I can guarantee you that Danny and his program are NOT playing
    in this game.  I wouldn't answer nor address anything that was not general
    or personal to me.  I mean to be aware, but very careful.

    My pseudo-theorem was highly tongue-in-cheek. It was merely a paraphrase of
    my vague advice in pretentious formal terms; I do actually think that
    economists tend to do things like that. The point is that if you could ever
    get the information you really needed to plug into the 'model', you would
    certainly already know what the best plan was, and the model wouldn't be of
    any use.
    
    Here are a couple of little comments, kind of from the 'outside' rather
    than from my insider's perspective on the game.
    
    1. You guys don't have to include 'm' in the 'press to' line. Every scrap
    of press goes to Jim anyway, because he's set a special option. (So don't
    say anything nasty about him.) And he has to read all of that press, at
    least skim it, because just by the subject headers he can't tell whether a
    message from the judge is specifically directed to him or rather just some
    press from Turkey to Austria or something. (I've used the ALL PRESS option
    as a gm, though it's fun it's a bit of a pain in the ass.)
    
    2. I'm a little surprised that Cal thinks Faz and I send huge amounts of
    press. Believe it or not, this is a quiet game for me. It is *very common*
    for me to send four or five messages *each day* to the powers I'm most
    interested in, especially near the beginning of the game. For example, as
    Russia in one recent game I would exchange four or five messages per day
    with England as we negotiated various abstract aspects of a potential
    long-term alliance. No doubt this is one of those features of internet Dip.
    that separate it from both F-T-F and snail mail Dip.
    Since we have week-long deadlines, I am not so anxious to exchange oodles
    of mail daily. And Cal and Faz have been by a wide margin the readiest to
    keep an ongoing conversation going. I feel that things are going very well,
    actually.
    
    We might all say something about this difference between internet Dip and
    other flavors when we all 'debrief' after the game. I can't resist saying
    that I find it remarkable that two of the three 'old fashioned' powers are,
    to my way of thinking, playing much more in the internet spirit than Pitt
    or John!

    Game theory is alive and well, but only if discussing the Prisoner's

    We can't take this to broadcast press. There would be too much wondering
    about how the discussion got started. Please don't.
    
    I do agree that we should stop this particular discussion, fascinating
    though it be, not because its content is at all problematic from the
    'master interference' perspective, but just because it's better to follow
    the simple principle of having no game-related suggestions or comments from
    master to a subset of players. (I've just mentioned this to Jim in private
    press to m.)
    
    What I mean is, I think Jim has to be very careful here. It would be too
    easy for the discussion to wander over into some very sensitive area, or
    for Jim *suddenly* to fall silent when a certain topic was broached, say,
    if someone raised as an example of something, say: the way Russia and
    Turkey can fool others by sneaking the Russian fleet out into the
    Mediterranean, but that this involves so much trust and the temptations to
    stab are so great, etc. (Not that I believe for a moment that that's what's
    happening, dear Tsar, but you know what I mean.) A sudden silence from Jim
    would be too informative!
    
    A sad cost of being master with ALL PRESS set. :(

    Hi Edi
    
    Just wondering if you'd given any more thought to my request for Serbian
    suupport of Ukr-Rum while I go Sev-Arm (Bla S).  I don't mean to be a
    pest, really.  But I was hoping to submit my orders tonight (or early
    tomorrow, I guess), and was wondering what arguments (for or against)
    you have for this idea.
    
    Again, if you're going unsupported to Gre anyway, then why not ensure we
    get Rum AND Arm this season?  Speed is what we were shooting for,
    anyway.  But I won't rehash last note.  If you have 'druthers one way or
    the other, I'll just await your reply.    For now I'll send in the
    "default" orders of support to Arm, and unsupported Ukr-Rum...

    Jim
    I know I don't have to address this as 'press to m,'  but what the heck.
     Hope this finds you well.
    
    Game thoughts:
    Turkey will never, ever trust me after this move.  For the second
    straight season, I have bald-faced lied to him, which I usually shy
    against doing.  Hohn thinks (or I *think* he thinks) I'm going to Gal
    and Rum, while he does his own thing.  But given the Quadripartite
    Alliance that's ongoing, I'm faced with few alternatives.  After all,
    with three others supposedly following the same "gameplan," any
    deviation is immediately suspect, raises the tension factor, and causes
    "undue attention" toward oneself.   And besides, maybe I'll gain more
    from this route, heh heh...
    
    My opinion is that Hohn, for all HIS words of trust and cooperation,
    anticipates this stab.  He was in contact with Austria, trying to
    support Edi to RUM, and has told me he reserves the right to hit BLA or
    ARM until he sees my true intentions.  (Hence my desire to ensure one
    build--Rum--and play on the off-chance that he leaves Ank for Arm and I
    slide in behind him. It's doubtful this will happen, but hey, why not
    try?)
    
    I've asked Austria to use Ser to support my A Ukr-Rum.  This allows me
    to ensure the capture of Arm (Sev-Arm, Bla S), and put a true choke hold
    on Turkey.  Edi hasn't responded, and I know he's deliberately stalling
    because he can't find a 'good" reason to argue against it.  This, to me,
    is good 'rationalization' for the eventual-planned R/I hit on him later.
       If Edi does what Edi says, he'll move Alb-Ion and Ser-Gre, Tri-Ser.
    (I have also hinted to Hohn--without having him relay it directly back
    to Edi--that he, Hohn, needs to hit Gre from Bul.)  This keeps RUM safe
    for me, and bounces Edi, making him strong (but not too strong) down
    south.   Who knows; they may both be in cahoots and are even now
    plotting my demise!
    
    Germany offers me Swe and alliance vs England, asking me to commit to F
    StP(nc); he fears the E/I, or so he says.  I'm just hoping I get Swe for
    now--where the build goes is secondary.  I am trying to think of a way
    that I can warn Germany of the impending (supposedly-impending!)
    Austrian move to Tyo and Boh in time for there to be an ineffectual,
    bloody stalemate that Italy and I can clean up on.
    
    The gameplan is this:  slow chokehold on Turkey by A/R.  I/E kill off
    France, with or without Germany.  Once the timing is right (and none of
    us knows when that is!!), we will hit Germany in tandem.  The Trio from
    the Q Alliance (E/I/R) have also been debating timing for the hit on
    Austria...much plotting and sub-plotting.  If this all goes well, Turkey
    will lose Bul and Arm next season, and be ground down by early
    1904...ditto for France.  The question is:  can we wait that long for
    anti-G and anti-A action???  Only our hairdressers know for sure...
    
    France is a non-writing lackard this game, and even Edi--a key
    ally--doesn't write as much as I'd expect a hobby ghod to do.  E/I are
    'natural' default allies, because only they (and Pitt) stay in close
    communication.  Out of sight, out of mind, I guess.

    Was your game the one where everyone at first "thought" that it

    Absolutely.  I happen to really, REAALLY, REALLY!!!! enjoy that fact

    Dan had to point the same thing out to me once too (perhaps he pointed
    it out to both of us at the same time).  I do really wish he had
    been the seventh player in this game, but what can you do.......

    That would be GM interference, which I have to be rather careful
    about for the reasons that Jamie states.

    Ah.... Jamie probably is right (at least to some extent) about the
    requirements of complex economics models.  One of my papers predicts
    problems that entrant companies like ValuJet face in trading off
    quality for survival and predict the growth of "low frills and
    cramped seats" in the competitive market, but most of the real
    problem still has to simplified away, and some of the logic of
    the conclusions and implications are transparent anyway.  In other
    words, the way of thinking is important, but the details of
    the thinking probably aren't.

    This is what I was hoping might happen.  I figure that by that time,
    I'll have Edi or Hohn to deal with.  We'll talk about it more over the
    next couple of moves.

    >I wouldn't shoot that birdie.
    
    Your point was well taken.  And, actually, right in line with my
    thinking...my comment was meant more as an off-the-cuff, "now I know where
    this one stands and I'll play him accordingly" sort of thing.  One *never*
    gives up an information source, one just fine tunes it a bit.  I remember a
    reader reply I read by author and book reviewer Spider Robinson in Analog
    many years ago.  The reader had taken Spider to task because he felt that
    Spider had no clue about current SF and that his reviews were *always* in
    direct contrast from the reader's own perspective.  To which Spider
    replied, "Well then I'm the perfect reviewer for you becuase you'll
    *always* know whether or not you'll like the book.  If I hate it, you'll
    love it and vice versa."
    
    >Well, for the record, I have been nervous about his plans from the start,
    >despite my extreme geographical protection from him. Just a fear-inspiring

    I share that concern.  I saw him in action into games at WDC and I know
    full well what he's capable of.
    
    >The thing is, I always have this sense that s-mail players like wild,
    >wide-open games, with sudden and massive shifts in alliance.
    
    FWIW, that's Edi's style in FtF, too.
    
    >I just have no 'feel'
    >for the tensions, intentions, pretensions of the s-mail bunch.
    
    I feel as if I do with Edi, a bit, but none with Cal and Faz.
    
    >If just one
    >of those guys were eliminated early, I'd feel better, but it sure looks
    >like our own Hohn will be the first to go.
    
    Well, I was sort of lumping Hohn in with the s-mail bunch from what I've
    heard previously.  In any case, I wouldn't be so sure that he's going to
    drop.  I suspect that Edi or Faz (or even Cal) will try to take advantage
    of his early weakness and cut a deal to come to his rescue.  I think
    they're too good (as is Hohn) to let the opportunity pass.
    
    >And here we are eliminating our poor colleague John.
    
    In  his case, I think he sort of deserves it.  Or rather, he's doesn't
    appear to be focusing on the game as much as the rest and, thus, isn't
    trying as hard to recover from the spring moves.  Were I he, I'd be seeing
    this spring slam as a great opportunity to engineer a stunning comeback,
    though that would require a monster effort.  I may be wrong and I may be
    being unfair but that's how it's shaping up from here.  (Of course, when
    EFIAR all move to attack me in Fall 1901, I'll be forced to eat those
    words...;-)

    Just my opinion, but:
    I wouldn't shoot that birdie.
    When I have a birdie, I always like to be nice to him. If you can count on
    a birdie to be truthful, that's very helpful. If you can count on him
    always to lie, that is actually just as helpful! Even if you just have some
    pretty good idea of what he might be up to in spreading gossip, that can be
    very useful, too. A live birdie conveys information to a canny listener.
    Dead birdies are useless, except for feeding your cat. (The closest thing I
    have is Hohn, so I am hoping he will survive a while, but frankly I am not
    optimistic. My cat is pleased.)
    
    
    >Edi...definitely Edi.  Which makes me *very* nervous about Austria's other
    >plans.
    
    Well, for the record, I have been nervous about his plans from the start,
    despite my extreme geographical protection from him. Just a fear-inspiring
    sort of guy. As I said, I intend to try to use that quality of his to win
    friends and influence people. (Win friends, influence people, then stab
    them and take their centers; you too can have success with Dale Carnegie's
    Keys to Life!)
    
    The thing is, I always have this sense that s-mail players like wild,
    wide-open games, with sudden and massive shifts in alliance. So I
    constantly have the feeling that I have basically no clue as to what's
    going on outside of our little corner here in the NW. I just have no 'feel'
    for the tensions, intentions, pretensions of the s-mail bunch. If just one
    of those guys were eliminated early, I'd feel better, but it sure looks
    like our own Hohn will be the first to go. And here we are eliminating our
    poor colleague John. Oh well. I guess this way I'll learn a little
    something.

    He's not talking to me a lot (so put your mind at ease about *that*).  And

    Russian Humor: Ha ha. Verrrrry funny. Must be the translation from the Russian.
    
    Chatting with Hohn:
    I've sent him a little something, witch-to-witch.
    I suggest saving the stealing of moves for a crucial moment, since it will
    only work once. I'll try to build up some capital, so to speak.
    
    Germany:
    I think he'll let you (Mark) have Sweden.

    Sultan,
    
    Info on Russia:
    He tells me only that he expects to be heavily involved in the South. He
    hopes but is not confident that Germany will let him have Sweden. He is (or
    feigns to be) frightened near to death of Edi Birsan.
    
    Info on Italy:
    I can tell you confidently that you have nothing to fear from Italian
    ships. :-)
    
    Anything you can share that might be helpful to me?

    Not sure what you mean. How could you lose Denmark? Will Russia build F
    Stp(sc)? I'll be surprised. Well, maybe not too surprised, he's said he's
    primarily interested in the south, but he hasn't mentioned his intended
    construction projects to me.
    
    >I'm willing to do that, however, to sustain that goodwill.
    >Please be prepared to protect me from the big, bad, Russian bear if he
    >comes hunting, though.
    
    Ok.
    I'll tell you, I would really, really like to avoid conflict with Russia
    for 1902. I have no idea what Italy will do next (see below), and I will do
    a lot to avoid having to fight in Scandinavia and the Mid-Atlantic at once.
    
    (I'll let you in on a little fact. Russia asked me to support him to Sweden
    in case you bounce him there. I said I wouldn't promise. Same reason: I
    insist that I will try like hell to avoid getting wrapped up in a
    Scandinavian mess while the prospect of some Mid-Atlantic skirmishes still
    loom.)
    
    But, I'll set up in North Sea and be prepared to support your F Den H, in
    case it's really necessary.
    
    If I've misunderstood, and you only meant that you depended on my good will
    not to *take* Denmark or assist Russia in taking it, then that's a
    different story. I agree to that.
    
    >>If you have any winter requests for me, let me know and I'll entertain them.

    Suits me.
    
    I am sure I will want to build an army or two at *some* point. I do promise
    categorically to build only fleets this winter. Any future army would be
    convoyed either to Norway or west of Belgium (Tunis is west of Belgium,
    isn't it?), and I'd discuss the idea with you in advance. Good enough?
    
    
    >>What we *don't* want is a
    >>concerted I/R/A effort to cross the stalemate line in Gibraltar and swarm
    >>all over you through the center.
    >
    >Agreed.  On the other hand, I'm under the impression that you've made great
    >headway in developing EI.  Is that not accurate?
    
    It is not accurate.
    
    I don't know what to tell you. Cal is not very talkative. I figured he's so
    used to snail-mail games that he hasn't got the hang of writing every day.
    (Also, I know he doesn't have access in the daytime.) But if he's been
    writing to *you* a lot, that hypothesis is shot.
    
    I am, obviously, pleased that he moved to Piedmont. But I am not at all
    confident that he'll snatch Spa and Mar and turn back east. It would be a
    peculiar strategy, since it wastes so many moves re-positioning units.
    Also, I am having a hard time believing that it was I who talked him into
    moving to Piedmont. I did ask him to do it, but unless I have some magical
    charisma power I'm unaware of there must have been another factor. I
    thought maybe you. I guess somehow Edi influenced him. Or Hohn Cho? It's
    mighty strange, though, if you think about it. I have never seen a game in
    which a single request by England made Italy go west.
    
    My diplomatic approach will be to attempt to scare the pants off Cal with
    True and Appalling Stories about Edi Birsan :). I am also trying to get
    Russia to influence Cal in that direction. Since I think Mark really is
    scared to death of Edi, I am somewhat hopeful.
    
    
    >>With peace between G and E, any other
    >>further alignment seems ok to me. We could do you and me against Russia, me
    >>by sea and you by land, with Italy facing off against Austria.
    >
    >Yes, that's sort of what I was thinking was the next logical step.
    
    Ok, that would be fine. Not ideal. Looking *way* ahead, it is not ideal for
    me to have my fleets all around Scandinavia, with a long way to the Med. It
    would work out if Italy and Austria clash interminably, but problematic if
    they (a) kissed and made up too early, or (b) either got run down too
    quickly by the other. Well, so much is obvious. Since we don't really have
    enough influence anywhere to control our own next moves, we'll have to wait
    and see (as you say).
    
    
    >All good possibilities.  Too soon to say right now, though.  What is not
    >too soon to say is that I am deeply committed to EG.
    
    Oh, goody, of course I believe you 100%, as I always do in Diplomacy!
    
    :-) :-) :-)
    
    No, but you know what I mean. Let's make it *prudent* for each other to
    maintain the alliance. E.g. (hey, "EG"!) by our build agreement, by
    avoiding the situation where all my fleets are in Scandinavia, etc.

    Hello Hohn
    Thanks *very much* for the call last night.  I'm sorry I seemed out of
    it initially -- the 7-8 p.m. timeframe always leaves me loopy, what with
    the kids' bathtimes, snacks, reading to them at bedtime, etc.
    Nonetheless, the 'timing' was very good last night, and I wanted to
    thank you for going 'the extra mile' to see this thing through.
    
    My intel (from the Archduke's mouth himself) is that he's going Alb-Ion,
    Ser-Gre and Tri-Ser.  Given that this is in line with what he's said all
    along--to include his peace with Italy--I envision a tough, but
    hopefully successful, fight in the Rum-Gal corridior for me, and Aeg/Bul
    for you.  If you transcend your (justifiable) fears of "the dark side"
    (i.e., former Russian perfidy), at least *consider* Bul-Gre.  That one
    move means he only goes +1, has Tri stuck at home, and less support for
    the 1902 counteroffensive.  I merely throw it out for your consideration
    of 'all' options.
    
    Again, my friend, thanks for the call!  let's make it happen!

    Kaiser,
    
    I think you would be in a better position to discern England's plans re
    Brest than I.  My guess is that he'll go to Belgium, but maybe he's feeling
    good about the immediate future and will order wal-pic to secure the long
    term.
    
    Perhaps you could talk to him and Italy and dig for some hints.
    
    Re den-nth, I assumed you'd order kie-den as well, ensuring two builds no
    matter what.

    >> >I was wondering if you have any preference about moves in F'02.  My gut

    I've actually reconsiderd this.  From what little I've been able to gather
    from France and other sources, he's going to use MAR to take SPA, MAO to
    cover BRE, and BUR to cover MAR (I've reinforced th latter by suggesitng
    that I'm willing to order MUN Hold rather than MUN-BUR).  If that's true,
    then your PIE-MAR doesn't help us.  In fact, it hurts us since it prevents
    my MUN-BUR from working and gives him the option of building a F MAR.  I'd
    suggest that PIE Hold or PIE S BUR-MAR is a better move.
    
    Your thoughts?
    
    >Now, do you have any suggestions as to what those other pursuits
    >should be?  :)
    
    Well, if EIG holds, after France is divvied up, I envision you taking
    heading south and east (east with my help if you want it) and England and I
    heading north and east.  England has already suggested this and I think it
    works.  What do you think?

    This is a possibility. Do you have any idea if England's planning on BEL or
    BRE?  That would make a big difference.

    Yeah, well, in this case I don't think interesting = good, at least not for
    Germnay.  IN order to do that, I'd have to give up the DEN SC and, with
    only one build in 1901, I wouldn't be able to capitalize on F NTH.  BUR we
    can discuss but DEN's just sitting tight.

    Reread my earlier note, and wanted to assure you that it wasn't meant to
    sound trite or irritable.  (But it probably still did, so I apologize.)
    I guess I just seem a little less willing to believe Hohn would just

    Hi Edi
    It's not a matter of "going paranoid."  To you it may seem so, because
    you're willing to gamble with my unit after I (not you) angered our
    common foe.  To me it's more of "playing it safe AND sure" by
    GUARENTEEING we get Rum AND Arm (no fancy-shmansy guesswork or
    double-whammy triple reverses, etc).  If you think it's better "for the
    good of the alliance"  that we try and out-think an angry Hohn and just
    go unsupported to Rum, that's fine.  He called me last night, too, but
    wasn't as open with his 'final" unit placements as he apparently was
    with you.
    
    Anyway, good luck with Ion and the slide gambit.  I'll support to
    Armenia, no doubt, and take my chances with Rum.  Deep down I want to
    believe you're right, and there's no sarcasm intended...I just thought a
    "sure percentage" was the better option this turn, is all.

    Edi,
    
    You have an "error flag" on your orders.  What this probably means
    is that you submitted your orders followed by your ".sig" file
    or signature file without a "signoff" command.  The Judge
    properly interpreted your orders, but did not kjnow what to do
    with your signature file.
    
    Please send  either a repeat of your orders with the signoff
    command, or I think just a blank signoff command if you want your
    orders as submitted to stand (What is there is the moves to
    Ion, Gre, and Ser).
    
    Thanks, sorry for the inconveniece,
    Jim

    No kidding!
    
    Did you watch the others of those games? I can't remember what they were

    others. But I am pretty sure the Artificial Diplomat didn't win any of them!

    You're right.
    The first is a technical problem, the second is a deeper theoretical
    problem: there's no guarantee of Nash equilibria when a game has more than
    two players.
    
    There's also the problem that Diplomacy is not a finite game at all. So we
    can't expect Nash equilibria even in a reduction to two players! I
    discovered this fact (which probably should have been obvious) when I was
    investigating endgames for a couple of Dip Pouch articles. Actually, I
    think Dan Shoham pointed it out to me.

    Hello again guys
    
    I imagine that, of the five remaining mail messages in the queue, one of =
    them will supersede this msg...Still, let me take 'em "one at a time..."
    
    The "separate communications" regarding POR.  Jamie, by no means would I =
    be offended if you and Cal discussed POR separately.  It's not my =
    sphere, so it's not a concern, per se.  I merely tend to believe that =
    when you're allied, advice is cheap and essentially "take it or leave =
    it."  I just wanted to express an ally's opinion, which, like yours, =
    tends to revolve around my personal situation (nature of the game, and =
    all that).  You want POR for the stalemate line; I want Italy to have =
    builds for anti-Aus operations.  Because, unlike you, I am *not* =
    sanguine about our anti-A/T chances for quick operations.  You two may =
    have visions of French sugarplums dancing in your heads, but that's =
    because you have him outnumbered and pressured not just on both flanks, =
    but in the center, with Pitt.  If and when we ever pull off the Edi hit, =
    it all boils down to:  what's happening at the time with Germany?  I can =
    see it now:  Turkey down to 1-2, then we hit Edi (who's at 7 or so), and =
    we're also fighting Pitt.  Guess who has all three enemies on his flank? =
     England is aloof from two of the three foes, as is Italy.  That's my =
    only concern--allies with centers and rapid accessibility to help me.  =
    Because quite honestly, if the board doesn't change in that regard, I  =
    can't (won't) initiate hostilities. =20
    
    That was my only reason for opining about POR.  If Italy gets centers =
    and gets them quickly, then whatever you guys agree on is fine by me.  I =
    *just* don't see Cal being able to rapidly turn on Austria with any =
    semblance of force by 1903, so I'm pressing to "front-load him" for the =
    betterment of anti-Aus operations.  Sorry for the pessimism, but that's =
    the glum Tsar for ya...
    
    The long-term division of spoils is, to me, not even worth considering =
    at this stage.  A lot of it depends on the final match.  Again, being =
    brutally honest here--as allies should--who's to say all three of us =
    will survive?  You guys could turn on me, or any combination could come =
    out.  And does Cal gets Turkish centers that he never fought for?  Do I =
    get German ones that Jamie won by himself?  You catch my drift--I WANT =
    us to be the three-power subset of the QC, because I think Edi's going =
    to bamboozle us all somewhere down the line.  And I harbor no ill-will =
    or evil plans against you guys.  Jamie's division of spoils is as good =
    as any of us can guesstimate for now, but I think it's too optimistic =
    and too premature.  Heck, we haven't even levelled our principal foes =
    yet. =20
    
    Anyway, let me shut down comms.  Rereading this, I sound awful =
    pessimistic -- must be that pizza for supper!  I appreciate the =
    discussions, and I hope you guys work out your western issues AND level =
    France quickly.  There are bigger fish to fry, as we all admit.  In that =
    regard, I AM optimistic we will persevere.  TIMING IS EVERYTHING.
    
    Will reply to any other notes, then shut down the system 'till tomorrow =
    a.m.  As always, I appreciate comments and ideas.

    Cal
    
    This is as good a time to talk as any, and I'm glad you brought this up. =
     I fear, in this oder, the following:
    1) Edi growing too fat upon Hohn's death;
    2) Edi and Hohn (as puppet) teaming up when we hit him (IF we hit him) =
    anytime "soon" (due to lack of good Italian builds)
    3) England growing at the expense of us all.
    
    I deliberately mentioned the idea of you getting POR for the same =
    reasons you have cited in this recent note.  I, of course, use the handy =
    lightning rod (Edi) as the excuse for you gaining.  There's truth to =
    that, but the penultimate reason is that I don't want England getting =
    too strong in the outyears and sealing off the Med/Mid.
    
    In fact, Cal, my big fear is that you and England get into a sparring =
    match when the rapid demise of France makes you guys hot together, and =
    we lose the anti-Edi part.  In other words, let's say you guys are in =
    Iberia and you now have to turn east to face Edi.  What's to stop Jamie =
    from heading east, behind your forces that have turned 180* to face Aus?
    
    The SCARY part of that is:
    1) You may feel that you can't/won't strike Edi because of such a =
    threat, and I end up with an A/I.
    2) Eng gets ahead of us in centers and ends up playing us off against =
    Edi, growing as he does.
    
    There are a few ways to address the issue:
    1) Immediate strike on Edi now and CESSATION OF HOSTILITIES vs France.
    My guess is that John will be most grateful for one less front, and, =
    relieved of a southern threat, can face Eng and Ger. This angers Eng and =
    maybe Ger, but buffers the West while we settle with Edi now.
    2) Status quo, and we just "monitor the situation."  This does nothing =
    to allay the long-term problem, though.
    We gtet Germany involved vs Eng...perhaps a hit on Bel, or a strike =
    toward Nth Sea.  Pitt will doubtless be relieved if he sees a lessened =
    E/I threat, and he can fight Jamie while you either mop up on France, or =
    leave him alone.
    If that was done, I could always sail for Nwy and work with Pitt.
    
    Option 3 is extreme; I don't even like to think of the QC dissolving =
    before ANY initial enemy is gone.  But I'm at a loss on how to deny =
    England centers when he'll be stronger than either of us by 1903, AND in =
    the better tactical position.
    
    Your thoughts on all this?   (I have supper waiting, so I'll return to =

    Even more unusual !
    What is an austrian fleet doing in the Ionian in 1901?
    Do you all agreed to make this a most noticeable game ?
    
    In keeping with the "strange" policy, I predict a fleet in Naples for
    Italy, then an attack on the Ionian to dislodge the austrian fleet, retreat
    to the Eastern Med and convoy Tun-Ion-Eme-Syr in the fall, together with
    a nice attack on Bulgaria and Armenia, of course. :)
    
    And what about England sacrificing (right spelling?) Norway without being
    sure of getting Bel? Or was it just to prevent France from going there?
    
    Turkey seems to have no distant friends, too. Russia got Sweden and might even

    Geez, now *I'm* having a hard time keeping up with all the mail.
    
    Ok, let's see.
    
    
    >Umm, I wouldn't say it's an up-for-grabs centre when it's you and I

    >the grabbing.  Belgium really isn't an option for me so I think we

    Well, I meant Belgium isn't really France's territory anyway. It's not
    quite like Tunis or Norway either. More like Greece.
    
    Anyway, I don't want to quibble over one center, esp. Belgium. I want to
    make it clear that it's not numbers I'm worrying about.
    
    
    >I honestly feel that my position in this game won't
    >start to be secure until I have 7 centres.  Until then, I'm fair game
    >and easy pickings to anyone powerful enough to attack.
    
    Yes, that's fair enough. You need more centers to be secure than I do. On
    the other hand, I need Portugal to be secure. Portugal in particular. I
    need Norway, too, for that matter, and I'll have that. And with control of
    North Sea, my position is very secure.

    >Does this sound fair?
    
    I don't quite understand it.
    
    I don't think you're demanding Paris AND Portugal. So are you saying I
    should take Por right away since/if that's tactically sounder, but then you
    should get it and I should take Paris, and then later we trade back? I must
    say I don't see the sense in that.
    
    Let's try to plot out the likelihood. Most likely we will get neither
    Iberian center in '02, but you will get Marseilles. If so, then in '03 we
    can take Spa and Por, one each. Then Paris probably left for later, '04,
    and I say you should get it. Then I'd just keep Por.
    Suppose you do not get anything this year. Then still we should aim to get
    you Spa and Mar and me Por in 1903. And in '04 we can still get you Paris.
    
    There may be some scenario in which it makes sense for you to get Portugal
    for a while. If you spell it out for me I can probably understand the
    reasoning better.
    
    > I don't want you thinking I'm being unreasonable
    >or greedy;
    
    (Is that what you mean, or do you mean you don't want to *be* unreasonable
    and greedy? :-) :-) :-))
    
    > I just think I have more need for it sooner than you do.
    
    I agree, have agreed, that you have a greater need for more centers sooner
    than I have.
    To be clear: the reason you do is that you will have a lot of trouble
    shifting your forces to attack Austria, whereas my forces will move more
    easily to an anti-German position.
    
    The only contentious issue is whether Portugal in particular is a center
    you need soon. In principle I'm prepared for you to have it for a couple of
    years and take it later. In practice I would like to see the kind of
    scenario you have in mind.

    No, I mean, yes, I agree with that. I meant we can manage France pretty
    easily now without German *help*.
    
    (Cal)
    >Are you sure that fleet Edi wouldn't be a better move if you're about to

    >Germany?  Just a thought.
    
    I think F Lvp, because I intend to move against both France and Germany,
    and I need two fleets against each. Your (currently existing) fleet will
    not be able to help me into MAO, I'm sure. France's fleet will keep me out
    of MAO unless I add another fleet on my west side.
    
    Edi:
    >Hey folks, I am visiting Oregon and I do not have thejudge stuff here...
    >How the hell do you send in builds?  Just say build?
    
    Yeah. This order will have the intended effect:
    
    	signon aghodstoo password
    	b a tri
    	b a vie
    
    You don't even need the 'b', really, you could just write
    
    	a tri
    	a vie
    
    since it's an adjustment phase and the Judge knows you have two builds.
    
    
    >I take it that the Italians will build Fleet Naples, the english two fleets
    >Edi(my favorite) and London
    
    See above response to Cal. I expect to build F Lvp.
    
    Maybe I'm miscalculating. Convince me.
    
    
    >France will go for Army Paris as forced.
    >Germany will go for Army Munich and it will be very interesting to see if he
    >goes for Fleet Kiel or Army Kiel...I suspect he might go for Fleet Kiel given
    >the English emptiness in the North.
    
    I hope not. I am hoping he will think of the English emptiness (an unkind
    phrase, sir!) as a calming influence, demonstrating that he needs no fleets
    to protect him against me. Maybe a vain hope. We'll see!
    
    >Turkey:  figure on Army Smyna maybe more than likely unless he was expecting
    >the Bounce in Ankara.
    
    A Smy is good defensively. If he believes he might be saved (by Italy,
    presumably) then he'll build A Smy. If he thinks that he's doomed unless he
    does something desperate to shake things up, then he'll build F Smy, which
    has more shake-up potential.
    
    
    >France is still playing the sick man mentality and has not even thought of the
    >possibility of Austria attacking Germany.
    
    He feels hopeless. Good. I like that in a victim. :)
    
    >Germany is still in vulture mode but will have to be watched, expect Italy and

    :)
    
    If he wants that, I'll give it to him. The further strung out he is the
    better. I would not at all mind seeing Pitt set himself up to attack me,
    then find his home centers suddenly at the edge of the AustroRussian swords.

    Amici,
    
    Faz: would you mind if Cal and I discussed Por separately? I have already
    begun to do so.
    
    I don't mind sharing my general thoughts, though. I feel that in the *long
    run* Portugal should be mine. Because of the stalemate line. I expect the
    details are obvious, though I am willing to go into them. I count five
    specifically French dots, I don't include Belgium (which I think of as 'up
    for grabs' at the outset). Nor would I include Tunis, of course, or Norway.
    I suppose if the general thinking is that Italy should get Mar and Spa plus
    one more from France, I much prefer that he take Paris as his third. I want
    Portugal for security reasons.
    
    I hope this is acceptable. I do understand now -- I hadn't really thought
    about it earlier -- that you two are in danger of being understaffed for a
    battle with Austria, esp. if there are remnants of Turkey about, which
    would be assumed to be Austrian proxies. And I agree that we should get
    Italy his French centers as *fast* as possible. It's just the strategic
    position of Portugal that I am sticking at. I will try to be reasonable.
    But I have to say that I would worry *a lot* if the two of you insisted
    that Italy ought to have Portugal in the long run. I would have to wonder.
    Maybe you could explain why Portugal, in particular? Again, *numbers* of
    centers for each of us I take to be eminently negotiable, and I accept the
    persuasive case that Italy will need some quickly.
    
    Disposition of Denmark, Kiel, etc., I take to be wide open for now. There's
    not a whole lot of point in discussing them at the moment, it seems to me.
    I am committed to the general idea that the three of us should maintain a
    rough equality in center-count as we progress. Who gets Denmark depends so
    much on who has what else.
    
    Getting really optimistic and looking at the really long term picture,
    let's see. I get, say, Bel and Hol, Por and Bre, Nwy and Den(?). Total of
    nine. Cal gets Tun, Spa, Par, Mar, Tri, Gre, Con, Smy?. Total of eleven.
    Obviously Faz gets Swe, Ber, Rum, Ank, Ser, Bud. Total of ten. There are
    four left: Mun, Kie, Vie, Bul. I guess I should get two of those, maybe Mun
    and Kie, and Faz could get on, say Vie, and Bul is the odd one for either
    of you. Something like that.
    
    
    More immediately:
    Cal, I certainly agree that if Germany and France were now to dig in and
    fight against you and me, it would be a long slow fight, though I suspect
    we have the upper hand (with just a little help from Russia). So I think we
    agree that at least another season should be devoted exclusively to
    anti-French activities, postponing the stabs of Germany and Austria for a
    little while longer. When you pick up one of Mar, Spa, and I add Nwy to my
    sack, then I'd be ready to go. And at that point Germany would, so the plan
    goes, have more pressing concerns than helping the French Friend.
    
    I'm a little more sanguine about your combined chances against Austria than
    you guys seem to be. I am assuming you get a good stabbing move in, so by
    the time the board shapes up to be a clear I/R/E against everybody, we have
    'em outweighed by maybe 20 to 14. Shouldn't that be a decisive advantage??
    
    Well, let us build and tend our local gardens for another season.

    Umm, I wouldn't say it's an up-for-grabs centre when it's you and I
    doing
    the grabbing.  Belgium really isn't an option for me so I think we
    should
    count it in as the sixth centre with you having the obvious claim on it.
    
    > I admit I had not really thought about your short-run needs; and I agree

    That's a definite.  I honestly feel that my position in this game won't
    start to be secure until I have 7 centres.  Until then, I'm fair game
    and easy pickings to anyone powerful enough to attack.

    Tell you what: Portugal will probably be a contentious issue between us
    for the first few years.  I agree that, because of the stalemate line,
    you
    need to have Portugal in the long run.  However, I will need it for the
    short term.  Short term in this case being defined as until such time as
    I
    can reasonably expect to grab a centre from EAST of me.  I WILL support
    you
    into Por from Spain if that's what it takes to get it off France (I'll
    certainly be easily amenable to whether or not this will be true).
    After
    that, we'll trade Por for Par (whether I own it or you take it off
    Germany)
    until the above requirement is met.
    
    Does this sound fair?  I don't want you thinking I'm being unreasonable
    or
    greedy; I just think I have more need for it sooner than you do.

    Hi Mark:  let's take this one-on-one for a bit.
    
    So far things have gone well, but I'm starting to wonder about what the
    plans are in Stage III of this game (Stage II being us hitting G/T).
    
    Jamie has written me privately talking about Portugal.  He seems pretty
    determined that Por will be HIS in the long run.  He wants it for the
    right reason - he knows that Por is crucial to him holding a stalemate
    line against any threat from the Med.
    
    That's prety much exactly the reason I DON'T want it to be his now or
    later.  I'm hoping you can talk him into believing that it will be
    better for me to have it now and him later.  It'll just work out so I
    don't end up giving it back to him... heh heh.
    
    Of course, this is all predicated on the fact that you and I are
    sticking together through all the various stages.  I think that's what
    we've been driving towards since the first moves.  I'm all for this but
    what worries me is that once F/T are gone and we engage G/T, then Jamie
    will really have no one to stop him if he decides to come through the
    Med.  Given the limited availability of centres for me, if he moves on
    me in force once I'm involved with Edi, he could conceivably push me
    back quickly enough that an 18 center English win is at least
    imaginable.  Once he got up to 14 or 15 centres, he wouldn't need to
    take too much off you to cross the Stp-Mun-Tun victory line.
    
    Comments?  I know that we're a long way from worrying about this, but
    it's better to start thinking about it now.
    
    Regards
    
    Cal

    That was pretty much the point I was trying to make when I suggested
    that
    I get Portugal.  If I don't have the units, I can't help against Edi
    and,
    if I can't help against Edi, Mark's prospects look pretty grim,
    especially
    if Pitt or Hohn have ANY units left to puppet to him.
    
    Now if it comes down to where, tactically, Jamie is in position to take
    Portugal and eliminate France, I have no problem with this.  I just want
    to be sure that I will be able to claim it as soon as is reasonably
    feasible.

    I'll pass along anything I hear and see if I can calm any fears Pitt
    projects my way about your build in War.  Doubt if I'll hear much from

    I think you're being optimistic about our chances against France at this
    point.
    If Germany was to take an ACTIVE hand in defending France, we'd be in
    quite a
    battle.  However, if Edi & Mark (as well as yourself) do attack Germany
    this turn,
    then Pitt will have much more to worry about than helping France hang on
    for a
    turn or two.

    Hi,
    
    Let's just talk about Por between the two of us for now.
    
    Ok, my general feeling is that Por should be mine in the long run. Because
    of the stalemate line. Do I need to go into details?
    
    I am willing to agree that Par is yours in the long run. This seems fair
    (Bel, Bre, Por, vs. Mar, Spa, Par) to me (though really I think of Bel as
    having a different status from the others; the other five are properly
    French and must be counted as spoils of invading France, while Bel is
    really an up-for-grabs center).
    
    I admit I had not really thought about your short-run needs; and I agree
    that you do need some quick builds, or anyway as quick as possible. Hm.
    
    When I get into MAO, I will support you into Spain, and I'll ask for your
    support into Portugal after that. And I won't request support from any of
    your units otherwise, since you will clearly need every bit you can muster
    to ensure a couple of builds as fast as you can get them. We may assume
    that Paris won't come until later.
    
    I'm afraid it's not just paranoia for you to worry about France throwing
    his remaining weight against your attack. He doesn't really have much else
    to do. If he's going to pick one attacker to resist, it pretty much has to
    be you. He might hope to frustrate you and change your mind. Anyway it
    looks like his only (feeble) hope.
    
    Well, further strategic thoughts later, there's plenty of time.

    Pitt:  well, that went quite smoothly!  Thanks for the tip on France's
    move; it worked out quite well for both of us.
    
    What are the odds of you supporting me to Marseilles this turn?  I don't
    really have any other hope for a build this year.  I realize this could
    jeopardize your chances of taking Paris, should France move from Spain
    to Gascony but I really think that he'll be defending against me for
    some reason.  Maybe I didn't talk to him enough or something... Perhaps
    England might be willing to support you in should France get into
    Gascony.  I think it's worth a shot (in my biased opinion), but I'd like
    to hear your views.

    Hi again Guys
    Look!  I've correctly erased all those follow-on notes this time!  Do I
    get my doggie treat now?
    
    As for western spoils, I can only offer my 2-cents as an outsider.  I
    would venture to say that if England gets 2/3 of France and all the Low
    Countries (not to mention covetous eyes toward Den), then Italy should
    have Mar and get ALL of Iberia--at a time to be determined by you all.
    The east is also up for grabs (figuratively).  I mean, which of us gets
    Den?  Where does Russia carve up portions of Ger?  Just Berlin, or Kie,
    too?  (Edi will obviously want Mun).  I say this not as an aggrieved
    party trying to argue over countries not even attacked yet(!!), but just
    for the implications of available centers for the follow-on attack vs G
    and A, and what that entails from the second front.
    
    I mean, Cal seems pretty assured that we'll take Edi down, but I ask:
    with what?  By 1903 Edi will have his 5 from 1902, plus Bul and possibly
    Con or Smy.  Cal's units will end up sailing to Lyo and Wes, perhaps?
    And there'll be an army Tunis and one in Mar, which leaves ???what??? vs
    Austria?  And don't forget, if Edi gets fat over Turkey quicker than we
    all expect, he could easily turn on you with Ion and a convoyed army
    while you are knee-deep in France and without a significant set of
    builds (or turn on me with a vengence-minded Turk puppet when I've
    tipped my hand to Pitt)  That's all DOUBTFUL right now, because he'll be
    content on reducing Turkey with me until late 1903 or so, but I have
    some concerns over unit availability to hit him with--especially from
    Italy.  Hence my plug for a green Por, vice a navy blue one.
    
    As for the War thing:  I've already sent said message to Pitt, asking
    him if he'd consider it untoward if I built there, given that Edi will
    "probably" build As Vie and Bud (ok, so I fibbed a little).  I can
    visualize the expected reply, but it doesn't matter in the long run:  if
    three nations converge on him, the outcome is foregone.
    
    Anyway, that's the Tsar's cut on the West, from the panut gallery.  I
    appreciate your Eastern advice, and if you can get the lowdown on any
    Turkish moves, I'd like to hear 'em.  I expect comms to be shut off with

    As mentioned in my other reply, I'd appreciate it if you could do that
    as I
    will certainly need a build soon if I'm to continue against France and
    still have units to back up an eventual attack on Edi.

    I'm comfortable with you taking Portugal, but I think it should be mine
    in
    the long run.  Opportunities for me to take centres are a bit limited in
    this direction.  Once the attack on Edi is underway and I have better
    opportunities we can then decide who should get it.  I'm not dead set
    against the idea so if you don't think it's fair, let me know.

    I have the same feeling about France's intentions to defend against me
    while
    you guys feast on his carcass (paranoid?  who?  me?).  This is probably
    the
    biggest factor in timing any attack on Austria.  Obviously, if I don't
    have
    the builds to turn east, then Mark's job against Edi will be much
    harder.
    That's why I am hesitant about Portugal.  I think I may need it to be
    effective in any eastward effort.  We'll play it by ear, okay Jamie?

    Ah, yes, that; allow me to explain, Marcus Fazius.
    
    That tidbit was for Edi's consumption.
    
    A short while back, Pitt told me that he had heard that I had made
    significant advances toward an E/I alliance. (That was what I meant by 'my
    intentions', not any particular moves.) For evidence he cited A Pie, of
    course, but noted also that he'd heard a rumor. Well, I am guessing at the
    source of that rumor. I very strongly suspect that Edi is tossing more fish
    on the frypan, influencing Germany to lean his defenses in my direction,
    sowing the seeds of future A/G cooperation, etc.
    
    I wanted to let Edi know that I smelled something. For one thing, I don't
    want him to think he can get away with those tricks too easily. More
    important, I want to set out a good explanation, just an implied one, for
    why I did not include him in those thoughts to you and Cal about arranging
    our next moves. The implication was supposed to be: "There may be a leak,
    so I'll tend to share my thoughts on the old need-to-know basis."
    
    Nothing to worry about. I 'assured' Pitt that I had no serious alliance
    with Italy, and even suggested that I believed it was someone else (Edi, of
    course) that did the real persuasion leading to Ven-Pie. Give Pitt more
    things to worry about.
    
    
    So, now you know.

    All I can think of is that you found out some reason that you have to
    fear
    Austrian treachery and need the extra army for "defensive purposes".
    This
    is pretty thin, but is about the best you can do.  It'll be YOUR job to
    make it sound convincing... heh heh.

    I think France's position still has too much play in it to ease up on
    him
    this year. He can certainly put up an aggressive defense against me
    anyway.
    If all we can bring to bear this year would be a single army in SIl and
    a
    single fleet in Bel, then 1903 seems like a better time, no?

    If you use the cover story I outlined above, you can build in Mos and
    tell
    Pitt you didn't want to alarm him as much as a build in Warsaw would
    have.

    I have Pitt to thank for it.  His last minute note contained the comment
    that he was sure France would move exactly the way he DID move.  I just
    took the chance that he was right by not moving to Mar.

    I'll certainly be ASKING him for support to Mar.  Jamie, if you could
    offer
    him support into Paris for the Fall, that would help my case greatly.
    As for Austria, it's true that he will probably have another two units
    if
    we hold off til '03, but with the 2-way attack from both sides, we
    should
    still be able to bring him down regardless.

    You'll still have me to hit Edi from behind, so it's not as bad as
    all that.

    The news about Germany being "a good guesser" after your moves piqued my
    curiosity.  How exactly did he 'guess" correctly?  Did you TELL any of
    us QC folks how you were moving?  I mean, his hold in Den showed he
    didn't sail for Nth when it was open (even tho'  he would've been crazy
    to do so).  And his grab of Bur and Hol seem pretty dang straightforward
    to me.   Of course, I say that as an "outsider" and not cognizant of all
    the diplomacy between you, I and G up there....just curious, is all.  If
    Germany's that good a clairvoyant, I better shut my mind down as I plan
    1902!

    Hi again Pitt,
    
    I forgot to add this to my first note.  If Austria shows signs of
    building two armies on the borders (either yours Vie/Tri or mine
    Vie/Bud), I might consider an Army Warsaw myself.  This way, Ukr S
    War-Gal (in the extreme case).  I have no indications that will indeed
    even happen, but I'm trying to visualize every extant circumstance and
    cover my rather large butt...But before I do, I want to 'clear" it with
    you and not make any antagonistic impressions.
    
    Again, it's a 1-in-6 consideration, but it covers the last of my
    (options) bases.   Your thoughts on the build or general geographical
    situation?

    Conspirators,
    
    Here are my general thoughts on our progress, past and prospective.
    
    I think it is fair to say that Cal and I no longer need the cooperation of
    the Germans to overrun France. Assuming that the full force of the Italian
    contingent will be brought to bear, I will need only a skeleton crew
    hereafter to render ruin to the Hall of Mirrors, etc. Thus, I will be able
    to do my part in the vivisection of Germany. At some point I would like to
    discuss the fair division of those spoils, but I'm in no rush and have no
    particular fear that I'll be cut out or anything.
    
    It does seem to me that the most direct approach is the best for us, for us
    all, for our alliance, for our plan. That is to say, we should all simply
    build and move forthrightly against Germany, never fearing about tipping
    our hands. What can he do, after all? At worst he could plan defensively
    and make our task a bit slower, but we are in no hurry, we four, we lucky
    four. (Of course I only mean that the three of us, Edi, Faz, Jamie, should
    move against Germany.)
    
    
    I must say that Germany seems to be an awfully good guesser after my
    motives. There's no leak among us, is there? No, of course not, perish the
    thought.
    
    
    As to adjustments: you can certainly expect two new fleets for me; one to
    take Norway and prepare my permanent grip on North Sea, and the other (F
    Lvp) to facilitate my incursion into MAO, the final blow to the French
    resistance. Obviously Cal must build a fleet (Rome, I imagine?). Edi is
    committed (as I recall) to two armies for use against the Germans. Faz
    agonizes over his second build (the one that isn't A Sev), but my feeling
    is that A War is the best (in keeping with my 'straightforward' suggestion).
    
    Stage One of the Gran Plan is well underway; let's begin the preliminaries
    of Stage Two (the Oktoberfest stage, shall we say?) asap, yes?
    
    Cheers! (preferably with a mug of pilsner in some lovely biergarten)

    Amici,
    
    1. Note to Cal: I wonder whether you noticed the recent Faz-pas: he
    included my PRESS TO IR at the bottom of his PRESS TO AIRE. I have
    admonished the e-novice separately, and he seems properly contrite.
    
    2. Thoughts on the German A Burg.
    I don't think he'll be too eager to support Cal into Mar. For if French A
    Mar is dislodged it will retreat to Gas, and then Pitt's chances of taking
    Paris decline. I will offer the support of my A Bre to Pitt, with the idea
    of drawing his troops into France to increase the effectiveness of the
    Eastern and Southern Ground Attacks.
    
    3. Other tactical issues.
    I can't think of any of common concern at the moment. My general intention
    is to build two fleets, use one to sail over to Norway and the other would
    be F Lvp; Lvp-Iri, preparing to force my way into MAO in the Fall and
    harvest Portugal in '03 (and/or support Cal to Spain if necessary). I would
    have F Eng-MAO (BOUNCE) in Spring '02, also, to keep the French fleet
    locked up in Por, otherwise I have to worry about holding on to Bre.
    Otherwise I don't know what I ought to do. The F Bel could go right after
    Germany, but it doesn't have any even mildly promising moves in that
    direction, so it would be a lot better if I can wait until I have a F Nth
    for support of Bel-Hol (or to dig in to Helg, or support Swe-Den, ...).
    
    4. It's possible that France will do everything to keep Cal from making
    much progress. That affects only timing. As far as I'm concerned, Cal gets
    Spa and Mar no matter what France does, and I get Portugal. Germany gets
    Paris temporarily, maybe; which of us takes it later might be left open, to
    depend on who really needs the build at the time, fairness in distribution
    of centers among the allies, etc. (Oh, sorry Cal, I meant 'centres'.) But
    timing is still important. I figure that's something the two of you can
    best work out between you, yes? I'm speaking of the timing of turning the
    blades against Austria.
    
    5. I think I'd better send something to aire together, just to reduce
    suspicions. Stand by.

    No worries, just wanted to make sure you were aware of the problem. No
    problems I can't handle, anyway. (Remember, I am geographically safe from
    any Edi schemes for the time being! The only possible unpleasant
    repercussion is if Edi decides the AIRE is really bad news for him and
    starts to alert Pitt.)
    
    Actually, a message you sent a couple of days ago also had the 'endpress'
    and 'signoff' nullified by >s, but nothing followed them. I noticed it and
    was going to mention it, but then I didn't. So I bear some of the
    responsibility :(.
    
    ------
    
    Here are my immediate thoughts on builds.
    
    I am inclined not to plan an attack of my own on Germany this year,
    certainly not in the Spring (well, almost certainly). I expect I'll be
    quite ready to do it in '03.
    Your choices, then, must depend on what you think Edi will do. Will he
    really surround Mun in the Spring? You might want to attack right away,
    then, on the theory that Germany just won't have the guns to resist. In
    that case you could just build F Stp(sc) and German objections be damned!
    Or anyway A War.
    
    A somewhat plausible excuse (to Germany) for building A War would be that
    you are convinced that Edi has a nasty plan in store for you. It's possible
    that Pitt may in fact try to convince you of just such a thing, in fact (it
    came up in the only long note Pitt has sent me).
    
    Finally, if it comes to that, I wouldn't mind too much if you built A Stp.
    The plan would be Stp-Nwy in Spring, and then Nwy-Swe, Swe-Bal! in the
    Fall; or if you like, just Swe H, Stp-Lvn in the Spring, that has some
    things to say for it too. Of course, I would have a fleet ready to snatch
    Nwy in the Fall. In fact I'd probably have two fleets ready (so don't get
    any grandiose ideas, cousin!). Hmmmm. Interesting possibilities there.
    Well, if you do go for that option, we can discuss the various
    continuations after the builds, ok?
    
    
    By the way: I expect Pitt to use the A Burg for his own purposes, not to
    escort Cal into Mar. Oh, I'll explain that in a separate note to the two of
    you, that is, in press to ir.
    
    Cheers!

    Yoiks!
    I didn't notice that carat thing, or the fact I included your message.
    My deepest apologies (and embarrassment)--I got sloppy, it seems.  Which
    is ironic, because I was trying to be so dang careful about me sending a
    secondary message to you all and editing out the "Edi gets the sanitized
    version" portions of mine, that I screw up regarding yours!   I'm sorry,

    Holy shit.
    
    Take a close look at what you just did, sir. You included, in your press to
    aie, *my* message that was addressed only to you and Cal.
    
    The technical reason that happened is that your 'endpress' was rendered
    null by the little caret '>' before it. Look closely, you'll see what I
    mean.
    
    
    I don't think there was any big harm done this time, because my embedded
    message said nothing that I don't want Edi to read; but my heart was in my
    throat when I saw that old message of mine chugging in after your
    
    >endpress
    >signoff
    
    
    PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE be more careful, dearest cousin.
    
    I think the best thing to do is make no mention of the gaff to Edi. Nothing
    really embarassing, nothing to alert the Birs-monster to any trouble
    brewing, but making a big deal out of it could give him more to think about
    than just letting it slide by.
    
    I will address the substance of your note soon, by the way.

    Hi Hohn
    yes, I'm a rat.  You probably envisioned that before the moves, but you
    still gave me the benefit of the doubt (again).  So now I have a double
    black-mark (and bad conscience) for hitting you.
    
    All I can say is, this started with Edi and a grand plan for certain of
    us.  I wanted something more than a "standard" R/T, and thought an
    anti-Turk opening with Edi would be different...and if I died, well, the
    game's over that much quicker for me.
    
    I don't expect you to ever trust me again,  and I won't propose any
    ideas to you for that reason.  Still, not everything I do this game will
    be anti-Turk, as you will soon see.  You will doubtless be true to your
    earlier threat of building and directing all against me and letting Edi
    have the bulk of the spoils; that's expected and understood.  It's also
    ironic, in that I'm the hatchet man, and Edi's the creative genius
    behind it all.
    
    I expect A Smy, and then fights over Armenia and various bounces.  Edi
    gets Bul (even without me) and after that, it's a crapshoot.  But like I
    said, Russia has other directions to gaze in, and you never know.
    
    Still, my apologies.  You almost won me over with your phone call,
    because anyone who goes the extra mile to make his point is Great Player
    in my books.  You've certainly been more prolific and communicative than
    50% of this board, and that's also a conscience hit for me.  Well, I
    made my bargain with the devil....good luck, Hohn.  You deserve better
    than me for a neighbor.  I think it's going to be hard to call off the
    A/I/R dogs of war at this stage, but I will *always* write (if you wish)
    and always wish to hear from you and everyone, every season.
    Gamesmanship, and whatnot...

    John, Will do.  I also see Germany as the weak link.  In fact, I just
    sent him a note asking him to consider you going to Pic while he does
    Bur-Bel (Hol S) and Den-Nth, thus gaining Bel (instead of Par!) and also
    crushing the fleet...not to mention the chance of him getting Nth and a
    convoy option!
    
    Keep this under your hat, but I've heard that Eng intends to build 2
    fleets (obviously), one of which will be F Lvp.  This merely solidifies
    the obvious EI connection, and may be good info to consider when working
    on Pitt.
    
    I'll do what I can.  Don't give up the ship (of state)!

    Noble Kaiser
    First off, my effusive thanks for Sweden.  You are a man of your word,
    and a man of keen vision for the future--much goodwill was bought with
    that gesture!
    
    Next, I wish to discuss the idea of further cooperation.  The E/I storm
    clouds grown more visible each day.  I know for the moment you are
    joining in the FranceFleshFest, for your relative gain as well as
    theirs.  However, I expect them to probably ask you for support to Mar,
    etc, before you manage to get Paris (unless you can sweet-talk Gentle
    King James)?     In essence, I sense a Rommel-like "dash to the wire"
    with you all, to see who can build more quickly and then beat the other
    to the punch.  Hopefully you will be in a better position than they.
    
    I have heard from England, who still wants Nwy, wants me not to build in
    StP, and who *SAYS* he'll be building F Lon/Edi and F Lvp...one for MAo
    duty and the other to Nwy.
    
    CONFIDENTIAL:  If, Pitt, you think the time to hit England should come
    sooner, vice later, you might want to consider Den-Nth as a
    bounce/invasion piece, *or perhaps your armies hitting Bel as you sail
    Den-Nth.*   This annihilates Bel (or at least forces it back onto Pic)
    and either gets you Nth, or bounces it.  In fall, I could support you
    there from nwy (if you're not already in there), and you can always prep
    a convoy unit in late '02/early '03.  I mean, England's anticipated
    builds are Nwy (1902) and Portugal/Spain (1903, probably).  An earlier,
    vice later, hit cuts Bel out of the equation, and catches him in
    southerly stride.
    
    I say this fully expecting you to NOT embrace the idea -- it is, after
    all, a major risk for us both, given that E/I are chummy, and Aus
    espouses chumminess with us all, forcing us to be cautious in a sea of
    sharks.   Still, if you're concerned with E/I, then I at least offer it
    up as another option/consideration....nothing to sweat over if you're
    agin' the idea.
    
    Anyway, *we're* still tight and friendly, and will be so for the
    duration, if you so desire.

    I should have listened to you, Edi.  Now, my ship is sinking fast.
    
    If you'd give my Italian friend a little hell, this might not be totally
    hopeless.  I imagine your attention lies to the east, but I think you and
    Russia have enough firepower to take the Sultan out already.  Might as well
    start on the other front right away.

    I tried to appeal to Germany's interests, too.  He does not stand to gain
    much from EI dominance of the west.  If he sees reason, his unit in
    Burgundy could prove helpful.  But, in truth, things don't look good for
    me.
    
    Four units on the board is still a viable situation.  I won't give up until
    they haul me out feet first.
    
    Work on Germany for me.  He's the only weak link.

    Hi John
    Well, my title says it all -- there is a concerted effort to hose you in
    the quickest amount of time possible.   Given that "talk is cheap," let
    me offer my own advice, if I may...
    
    1) Drink heavily
    2) Talk to Pitt and stress to him the FOLLY of his vulture-like actions
    against you, when E/I stand to get Iberia and the lion's share of the
    region (as them as a teamed power).  I have already mentioned this once
    to him, and will do so again.
    3) Continue drinking heavily.
    
    If you ever want/need advice (and I have it available) I'll keep you in
    the loop.  It does Russia little good to see overbearing E/Is strutting
    around the board--especially if one or both of them are also chummy with
    the Kaiser.  I'll do what I can to  help you (and, indirectly, me).

    Fellow Quadripartiters!
    We couldn't really be asking for much more this game, methinks!   Edi's
    grand plan seems to working well and looks to work even better in the
    very near future.
    
    >From me, a *mea cupla* of stupidity regarding the moves.  I
    overanticipated Hohn's defensive plan, giving him more aggressive credit
    >than , in retrospect, I should have.  As such, I should've done the moves as
    >Edi recommended--we would've had an even better stranglehold on Hohn by now.
    On the "bright side," though:
    1) Turkey can only build in Smy (I expect an army there, thence to Arm
    against me).
    2)  I can force Arm (or bounce him perpetually), and this allows Edi and
    >I the chance to leisurely crush Bul and Con.  He's doomed in Bul/Con for '02,
    >so it's not a big deal.
    3) Me being in Ukr does two things:  it allows me to snooker Pitt by
    making it seem like I trust no one down there, and it also allows me to
    compensate for the missing A Mos (Lvn) by having a possible A War-Sil
    and A Ukr-War (then to Pru).  This still gives Russia two units (three
    with the fleet) vs Germany.
    
    One build for me is Sev, guaranteed.  The other build will be a harder
    >one as regards Germany.  He may request a northern build, given the apparent
    >quick death coming to France and the "teaming" threat from E/I.  I will be
    >*hard pressed* to argue against why I shouldn't be taking an unguarded Nwy
    >that's "ripe for the taking, " as Germany will doubtless see it.   Any good
    >cover stories?
    >
    >The French hit was pure silk; Edi called it right.  I had also urged Germany
    >to coordinate with Cal as regards a Bur-Mar move/hold sequence, and Jamie's
    >ballsy grab of Brest was pure joy!   France will be completely dead in
    >another 3-4 turns, max.  You guys are awesome.
    
    Guys, how do we stand with the follow-on mission against Germany?  Edi,
    are we on track for the 1902 Tyo-Boh-Sil invasions?  Cal and Jamie, I
    imagine your attacks will come in 1903, after you each gain one more
    center and get prepped????  (Sort of a 1-2 punch.)  Much of my build
    consideration and movement will depend on how we all decide to crunch
    Germany, and when.
    
    Again, good moves to all.  Edi, let me know how we will crack the
    Turkish nut this turn:  I'd like to see you take Bul, and then support
    me to Con in fall, if possible.  Maybe split the area via Bul + Smy for
    you, Ank + Con for me?

    Hi guys
    Will be sending out a more inclusive version of this note (i.e., the
    "sanitized version," to include Edi) soon; most will be repititious.
    
    For us:  I probably could've tried for the moves as Edi envisioned
    them--we would've had an even better stranglehold on Hohn by now.
    Still, he can only build in Smy, so that halps out.  Ican force Arm (or
    bounce him perpetually) and he's doomed in Bul/Con for '02, so it's not
    a big deal.
    
    Russian builds:  This is a tough one.  Germany may request a northern
    build, given the apparent quick death coming to France and the "teaming"
    of E/I.  I will be *hard pressed* to argue against why I shouldn't be
    taking an unguarded Nwy that's "ripe for the taking, " as Germany will
    doubtless see it.   Any good cover stories?
    
    Much of my build considerations depend on you two--and Edi.  I mean, if
    you want/need Germany to get deeper into France before you stab him,
    then I'm not going to invade Sil alone and tip our hand.  If, on the
    other hand, you're moving now vs Germany with Bel and a new fleet, then
    I'll mobilize and also join in.   From the sound of it, though,England
    wants its fleets for position (Nwy and Mao), vice a 1902 hit on Germany
    -- so you're saying 1903 at the earliest is German hit time???   If
    that's the case, I expect much pressure (and lying to Germany) over me
    building ANYWHERE else but Sev and StP....
    
    The ideal Faz builds are A Sev, A War.   However, War sends the
    immediate flag to Germany.  Advice, please????
    
    The French hit was pure silk.  I had also urged Germany to coordinate
    with Cal as regards a Bur-Mar move/hold sequence, and Jamie's ballsy
    grab of Brest was pure joy!   France will be completely dead in another
    3-4 turns, max.  You guys are awesome.
    
    How about Austria, Cal?  You're going to be building a fleet, I assume,
    to keep up the westward movement???  And is Germany going to help you vs
    Mar this turn?  If that's the case, you're obviously going to be doing
    1902 in the same "gain/move" mode as Jamie, meaning Edi is secure until
    1903 at the earliest (and that translates into another 1-2 gains for
    him).
    
    In a way, I wish I wouldn't have burned all my bridges with Turkey.
    Hitting Edi with Turkey still alive would only cause them to make an
    alliance of convenience against me.  But hitting Edi after Hohn dies
    means he may beat me to the punch!!!    Decisions, decisions.
    
    ** look for this note in near-entirety within a few minutes, addressed
    to all of the QC.

    Allies, Bon Vivants, Tricky Devils;
    
    Good work. Glad Cal worked out that arrangement with Pitt, it means a
    rapider death for Frenchie. Faz gets his two. I get my two and I have
    crippled France (can't build a fleet).
    
    I think I'd like to see how everyone builds; then, if I'm not mistaken,
    it's time for me to make a serious decisions (will I come right out and
    attack Germany in '02? or should I focus on picking up Norway and preparing
    to take Portugal? Though we didn't discuss it in advance, I am assuming
    that Cal agrees that Portugal is to be mine.)
    
    Oh--I will build two fleets, obviously. I need one to take Norway, and I
    need another (F Lvp) to make sure I get into MAO. Cal's build is obvious.
    Faz, how will you play it?

    KaiserPitt,
    
    Hm, yes, I guess I have to agree that John got what he deserved.
    
    (And for taking a risk on a bold move, I deserve what I just got, too, right?)
    
    Glad you worked out the Burg situation with Italy. Now this should be a
    fairly trivial matter.
    
    I do want to make sure I get Portugal, and of course I have to take certain
    measures to make sure I get Norway now. But France, at least, no longer
    offers me anything to worry about. (Can't even build a fleet!) After the
    builds I think I'll be ready to decide where I plan to be going in '03,
    after Portugal is a fait accompli.
    
    Off hand, I'd say my A Bre is at your service for S'02 at least, probably
    for all of '02. Several options, your call. Lots of time to think about it.
    
    Cheers!

    Hey! No panicking allowed.
    
    First: we do now have an understanding on Par and Por, so that's done with.
    The last hitch turned out to have to do only with our respective
    predictions of how the units would be arranged in a year or so. In case Faz
    had visions of the two navies coming to blows in the Atlantic while the
    Pitt-viper and Birsan creature licked their lips (each his own, I hope),
    you may schedule pleasanter dreams for the future.
    
    As to the timing of the attack on Austria, that is obviously entirely up to
    you guys. I was merely speculating.
    
    As to the timing of the attack on Germany, I believe that Cal and I each
    would like to get France a little deeper into oblivion first. The point is
    that although we can now sink France without any German help, we might have
    serious trouble if Germany actively aided the French. Now, as soon as I see
    those Austrian armies actually attack Munich (even surround in hostilely
    with no obvious excuse for Edi to use, like, 'Tyrol and Boh make a really
    good corridor for streaming my armies into the Warsaw Ghetto'), then fine,
    I will personally be dripping with confidence about the final solution to
    our French problems, and I'm game for throwing whatever weight I have at
    the Helgoland Bight (or wherever).
    
    Here's what's behind my guess at '05 for the Austria attack. Cal has
    explained that he wants to have seven centers before he looks east. That
    means he won't go until he owns Mar and Spa and one other. I don't think
    he's likely to have all three by the end of 1903. Maybe he will, I
    certainly hope so, but I wouldn't count on it. See below, where I explain
    an entirely plausible scenario in which Italy gains nothing at all in 1902.
    (Well, nothing except a headache.)
    
    
    
    On Germany: He hasn't written to me since the results of the move.
    I doubt that he will be inclined to use up that A Bur's move supporting Cal
    to Mar. I've explained why. You could try asking him to move Bur-Gal,
    Mun-Bur; I would be glad to do Bre S Bur-Gal. The idea would be then for me
    to support Bur-Par, while Pitt did Gal-Spa to cut support and Cal orders
    GoL S Pie-Mar. But I suspect that the German army that moved Mun-Bur would
    probably be suddenly and unexpectedly called back to duty at home, if you
    see what I mean. So I can see the end of '02 with Italian units in great
    positions but sitting in no new supply centers. (But, with me in MAO and
    France down to garrisoning Por, Spa, Mar, Italy ought to have no trouble
    snatching two in '03 anyway. It's that last one, Italy's seventh center,
    that looks like it will have to wait until 1904.)
    
    Now I'm a-thinkin', Edi saw this situation coming. He wants Cal to be
    sweating over France for a while to come, because he doesn't want to have
    his own Austrian hands full of Turkey and Germany when Italy suddenly has
    finished his first project. That's what I think. I figure that's why Edi
    wants me to give only very limited help against France from now on, so that
    Cal is bogged down and busy.
    
    
    And about my etch-a-sketch. Laugh all you want, but I have the world's
    greatest Diplomacy mapping and plotting program, and you can't use it even
    at 200 megaherz! Unix guys are no doubt ecstatic over a really cool data
    structure file containing the names and neighbors and occupation and
    ownership of every damn region on the board, and all the neat manipulations
    they can do with those files. I'm very pleased for you! You just print it
    out and pore over the data, while I point and click my way through 1905 in
    six colors....
    
    You may return to your pizza and beer now. I'll buy you a nice lager in
    Kiel, Faz, a round for the Kronstadt Sailors, on your cousin....

    Can I join you on that keg? :)
    
    As I said in my last message, 1905 seems an awfully long time to have to
    live next to Edi.  Don't know if we've made this clear to you, Jamie,
    but both Mark and I know Edi well enough to be scared spitless of his
    Diplomacy skill.  If we seem uneasy about our ability to take him down
    even in a two on one fight, well, that's why.

    I think the idea here is to let Pitt get overextended into France so as
    to make it easier to hit him and then use EXACTLY the same idea on Edi
    when he moves on Germany.  Is this about right?  Or have I
    misunderstood?  I don't want to say exactly what year or turn this will
    happen because in each case it will be a subjective call.  For that
    matter, the German attack timing probably depends on Edi to a large
    extent.

    I think we have pretty much ironed this out already.  If it seems that
    Por is the only way I can get a quick build, then Jamie has agreed that
    I can have it on the condition that I trade it for Paris as soon as
    feasible.  That about right Jamie?

    Ouch.  That seems AWFULLY far away.  I hate to give Edi THAT much time
    to maneuver/diplome...  There's only so long I want to live knowing

    Well, I have more confidence in my ability to stab (heh, heh experience
    IS a good teacher...), but I agree that I'd rather not do it in this
    game (well, not to YOU that is...).  A 17-17 would be quite a nice
    result and with a certain tension, but a race to 18 is fun too.  We'll
    see.  At least we're agreed on the idea that our "QC Subset of TWO" is a

    I agree.  I had the opportunity (misfortune?) to play against Edi in a
    one on one face-to-face game of Escalation and was very impressed with
    his grasp of the board.  But then we saw that when he suggested this

    Sounds good.  We're pretty much agreed in concept but differ on possible
    specifics.  As far as my fleet in Western Med, I didn't mean I was going
    there immediately, I meant that the fleet I'm about to build would be
    there in two turns.  I see that we may want to establish your fleet in
    the Mid before that, so I withdraw my objection to your fleet in Lpl.
    
    Ciao!

    1. About my F Lvp:
    I'm surprised that you are joining the others in urging me not to build F Lvp.
    I don't see your point about your F Wes helping me into the MAO. I would
    have expected that fleet to be in GoL, attacking Marseilles. Are you not
    going to bother taking Marseilles? The attack on France goes faster, and on
    Germany slower, if I build in Lvp. I thought that's what you wanted. You
    want me to build in Lon and Edi and attack Germany right away, this turn?
    That's what Edi and Faz want. I thought you and I agreed that we prefer to
    finish France.
    
    2. About Por

    Yes, we both agree on that. I mean, on those.
    
    >  For that, I obviously need three centres and Mar,

    Let's see how it looks after the Spring moves, shall we?
    
    Here's what I'll do. I agree that you should get Mar plus Spa plus one more
    before you have to attack Austria, and I will try to get you that one more
    as fast as I can.
    We just don't agree on how the tactics are going to work out, I think. Maybe
    I'm wrong. Let's just wait and see.
    
    > Once I get my first
    >Austrian centre, you get Por.  Make sense?  :)
    
    How about my proposal above?
    
    I agree to get you that Seventh Unit asap. If I can get you Paris as fast as
    you could hope to get Por, then you'll take Par.
    
    Ok?

    I would appreciate comments from everyone after the builds are announced
    on the current state of the game from their point of view.  Just do
    "press to m" and I'll be the only one who will see it.  These will
    be archived with the other press from the game.  I think it's fair
    to say the first year has been.... "interesting" for everyone and has

    To add one more thing,
    Dave Kleiman (also esteemed) said:

    Game 'ghodstoo' order #003 (F1901B) has a deadline of Mon Feb 17 1997 23:02:14
    One or more players have not gotten their orders in.
    One or more players have requested that orders not be processed until the
    deadline.
    
    
    I would just add that there is a deceptive part of the judge listing which
    people often get confused on.  What Dave just said is 100% correct, and
    before a deadline arrives, it is the only way to tell if the game is
    waiting for orders, a set no wait, or is about to process.
    
    
    The following players are signed up for game 'ghodstoo':
      Master                      burgess@world.std.com
      Turkey     move    3/4  252 hohncho@kaiwan.com
      England    move    3/5    9 James_Dreier@brown.edu
      Russia     move    4/6    6 jm2365@exmail.usma.army.mil
      Italy      move    3/4    6 diplomat@idirect.com
      Germany    move    3/5  616 pittc@syncon.com
      Observer               1675 dave@kleiman.indianapolis.in.us
      France     move    3/4   84 uejon@ttacs1.ttu.edu
      Austria    move    3/5    6 edi@mgames.com
    
    Obviously, we know from above that one or more players have not gotten
    their orders in, so MOVE listed by each player doe snot mean they have all
    entered their moves.  Rather (and note the contrast with Dave, the
    observer) it mans they are suppose to submit moves for this phase (whether
    thay have done so yet or not).
    
    On a retreat, there will only be MOVE listed next to those due to retreat.
    
    
    AFTER the deadline, passes, however, those who have incomplete orders (at
    least one NMR) will be listed as LATE rather than MOVE, and those with
    complete orders and a spurious error flag will be listed as PART (but
    treated like late, for the most part).  People with complete and clean
    orders will still be listed as MOVE, but now this will be an indication
    that their moves are in.
    
    Andy
    p.s. The Late/Part distinction above may not be 100% accurate.  If others
    can confirm/correct this part, I'd appreciate it

    The other piece of information about the set wait/procssing of moves etc.
    question is that if you do a LIST for the game (list ghodstoo), the judge
    will tell why the moves haven't processed.
    
    In the current example for this game, the moves haven't processed for two
    reasons:
    
    1) Someone doesn't have their orders in (One of more players have not
    gotten their orders in)
    2) Someone has done a SET WAIT (One or more players have requested that
    orders not be processed until the deadline)

    Ah, but Andy didn't directly answer Cal's question.  (Okay, it's implied
    more than once, but...)
    
    If Cal wants the MAXimum amount of time to pass between moves, he needs to
    add the SET WAIT command to his list of orders when he sends those in to
    the judge.

    I think that, for the LONG term, I'd put these in reverse order,
    although that may just be a matter of board perspective.  The order you
    have here is certainly correct for the next two or three years.

    That exactly why I thought we should have this conversation now before
    this sneaks up on us.  I've known from the start of the game that my
    biggest problem would be trying to do the 180 while involved with
    France.  That leaves me open to an aggresive England.
    
    > The SCARY part of that is:
    > 1) You may feel that you can't/won't strike Edi because of such a =
    > threat, and I end up with an A/I.
    
    The only way to avoid this is for you to make it very clear to him that,
    if he tries anything against me, you will have no choice but to move on
    him in the north.  It needn't be a full scale operation (which neither
    of us could mount and still attack Edi), but if we both harass him in a
    two front war, he'll have some problems.  Of course this means that all
    three of us would be in two-front wars: him against us and us against
    him and Edi.  Ugh, that sends shivers down my back.  Edi would be in his
    glory!
    
    > 2) Eng gets ahead of us in centers and ends up playing us off against =
    > Edi, growing as he does.
    
    This may well happen.  See above.

    Unfortunately, this would also have the effect of throwing Hohn and Edi
    together.  I'm not thrilled about that idea, to say the least.

    I think this is our most reasonable course of action.  I think we're
    pretty much aware of what is going on board-wide.  Things aren't so much
    out of control that we have to try anything radical.  Yet.

    We might try a variation of this in a year or two.  Once Pitt has been
    hit and is crippled, if we find that England is growing too large for us
    to handle, we can always offer to pull back on Germany and give him some
    time to face England down.  By this time, we'll have hit Austria, so he
    won't have any say in the situation as he'll be too busy defending
    against you and I.  As long as Pitt is amenable and doesn't decide then
    and there to throw in with England (! Horrors!) we'll be okay.
    
    > Your thoughts on all this?   (I have supper waiting, so I'll return to =
    > this theme in a later note, ok?)
    
    Bon apetit!  I think I've covered all the bases here.  We don't have any
    problems that we don't have at least a possible response to, so let's
    just keep things going as planned for now.  Wot sayest thee?
    
    By the way, we should also talk about the very end game as well.  I'd
    say we have three options:
    
    1) Play for a two way
    2) Expect to attack each other and go for a solo win
    3) NOT attack each other, but play for the "race to 18".
    
    I'm open to any of these, but I don't want to do #2.  If we go for #1,
    then I'd like it to be a 17-17.  If it wasn't a demo game, I'd never
    agree to this, but since it is, a 17-17 result has a certain panache.
    #3 would be fun and we could maintain the alliance and game-friendship
    with a "let the better man win!" attitude.  That's usually quite fun.

    >In the one previous e-mail game I played, the Judge would adjudicate and

    What you experienced before is the general rule: the judge will always
    process is all orders are in, without errors or error flags (see below), no
    one has set wait, and the MINinum time before processing orders has passed
    (see also below).  In this game,
    
    So, to reanswer Cal's question more concisely:
    
    For moves, the game will process as soon as:
    
    Error-free orders from all players are submitted, no one has set wait, and
    at least 12 hours from the last phase has passed.
    
    For retreats/builds, the game will process as soon as:
    
    Error-free orders from all players are submitted and no one has set wait.
    
    
    Now for the explantions:
    
    Error Flags are caused by 2 things, real errors and fake errors.   Real
    errors are generally easy to spot.  You might be England and submit  Army
    Liv - Wales, and the judge will complain it does not know what Liv is.
    You'l see Army Liverpool, no order received, and you'll resubmit, Army Lpl
    - Wales, realizing that while humans know Livonia from liverpool, and
    almost nver find it ambiguous, the silly judge does not.  (However, two
    convoys from Kiel conceivably could be arranged and the question would be,
    which Liv was meant by A Kiel-Liv?)
    
    However, error flags are also caused by fake errors.  Say you have ordered
    all your units, but later you send try to send press, but you forget to say
    
    
    Press to F,
    
    so instead it looks like
    
    --> signon eghodstoo password
    --> Yo, Frenchie, how's that for some hot convoying
    --> endpress
    --> signoff
    
    B/c no PRESS TO F was mentioned, the judge thinks these are attempts at
    orders, says it cannot find a province called Yo, or one called endpress,
    so it gags and sticks an error flag on you.  However, it LOOKS like all
    your orders are in, and they are, but you are marked as if a move were
    required b/c of the error flag.
    
    This flag is designed to prevent you from goofing up if you already have
    orders in and you try to change them but mistype. Rather than just reject
    your botched changes, the judge assumes you would prefer the game to wait
    until you resubmit the orders correctly.  So, if after submitting A
    Lpl-Wales, you decide you'd prefer a Yorkshire move, but forgetfully revert
    to A Liv - Yor, you would still have the Lpl-Wal order on file, but the
    error flag would prevent the game from processing until you either clear it
    or fix the order.
    
    An error flag is easy to clear.  Sign on and signoff (without new error)
    and all stray error flags are erased.  However, this method will not change
    the Lpl-Wal to Lpl-Yor, so be vigilant.  Behind every error flag is a real
    error, trvial or not, and while clearing the flag is easy, you may want to
    FIX the error if it had a non-trivial root cause.
    
    Worse still, people often miss the error flag, and seeing that all orders
    are submitted, they ignore the dire warning at the bottom of their press
    saying they have not submitted orders (after all, they HAVE and they are
    listed right there!).  When orders are properly in, you get no warning at
    the bottom saying when you'll be late, so if you think your orders are in,
    but the judge is still telling you at the bottom of press that you'll be
    marked late if orders are not received by a certain date, well, you have an
    error flag that needs fixing.  And you will be marked late and docked a
    dedication point a day for 999 hours, and the ejected from the game
    thereafter unless you clear the error.
    
    Sorry for being so long winded, but with such an experience Diplomacy
    crowd, it'd be a shame for judge interfce issues to cloud a great game.
    
    As for MIN, this game is set:
    
    Move     min 12.00
    Retreat  min  0.00
    Adjust   min  0.00
    
    
    This means that even if everyone submits Spring move orders immediately
    after the winter builds process (or fall moves after spring moves and any
    needed retreats), the game will wait 12 hours from the last results before
    it processes spring.  However, retreats and builds WILL be processed
    immediately, once all orders are in (w/o errors) and no set waits are set.
    
    
    So, to recap:
    
    For moves, the game will process as soon as
    
    Error-free orders from all players are submitted, no one has set wait, and
    at leats 12 hours from the last phase has passed.
    
    For retreats/builds, the game will process as soon as
    
    Error-free orders from all players are submitted and no one has set wait.
    
    
    
    Hope that helps,
    
    Andy

    My thinking is that I will have an easier time in gaining Portugal in
    the next two or three turns than I would with Paris.  I DO agree that
    Portugal is yours for the long term because of the stalemate line.
    However, for me to attack Edi effectively, I see a real need to have
    three units in Italy.  For that, I obviously need three centres and Mar,
    Spa and Por seem the easiest/quickest to get.  Once I get my first
    Austrian centre, you get Por.  Make sense?  :)

    I'm not sure why you don't think my fleet in Western Med can't help you
    take the Med.  The way I see it, once you're there, taking France down
    in Iberia will be much easier/faster.  I don't mind sacrificing one turn
    supporting you in the Mid when all I would otherwise be doing is banging
    my head against Spain.

    I've asked him about support into Marseilles, but haven't heard back
    from him.  I won't say he isn't paying attention to the game, but he is

    I agree that attacking Germany this turn would be a bad idea as the
    combination of F/G would slow us down WAY too much and would cause my
    involvement against Austria to be too late to stop him from growing too
    large to take down easily.

    Yep, if it works out that way.  Our position should be enough to carry
    us to the win, but as we've been saying TIMING is crucial to that
    position (or at least, the attainment thereof).

    Since I stubbornly refuse to learn how to read game "parameters", could
    someone answer a question for me?
    
    In the one previous e-mail game I played, the Judge would adjudicate and
    send out results once everyone had sent in orders/builds regardless of
    how much time remained until deadline (unless someone sent in a SET WAIT
    command).
    
    Does this happen in this game?  Or will we wait until the deadline every
    time?
    
    BTW, this isn't a complaint.  At least for now and the foreseeable
    future, I would PREFER that the full deadline passes.  Maybe after I
    hit, oh, say 16 or 17 centres, I'll want to shorten deadlines, but for
    now the full time diploming is appreciated.  (tongue in cheek
    sirrrahs...)

    Everyone has the right to look stupid.  I now exercise that right.
    
    After the Spring moves I looked up the openings via the DipPouch.
    I was going to write up my opinions, but I hesitated.  Procrastination?
    Yes, but something else, if Edi was going to throw the Gauntlet, I didn't
    want to spoil the surprise.
    
    So here are the opinions of someone who probably should remain anonymous,
    and avoid the light of those that know better.
    
    But first, a question.  What did John do to invite a EGI alliance against
    him?  If I had expected a "let's get so-and-so" it would have been against
    our current World Champ, Kaiser Pitt.  But then again, that just could be
    my ignorance showing.  This touches upon the concept of newer players
    being ignorant of the history of the hobby.
    
    Enough tangential ramblings.
    
    Austria:
    
    A standard looking Balkan Gambit.  BUT, Dip A to Z mentions that Edi
    Birsan has a variation called the Ionian Gambit.  The same Edi that is
    playing Austria in this game.  Hmm.  This made procrastinating very easy.
    If Italy and Austria are going with a Lepanto it'll look like a Christmas
    board.
    
    England:
    
    The openings resource calls this a Wales opening, and says it's
    anti-French.  (Duh!)  Combined with France's open, I'd guess England
    stabbed France at the first possible chance.
    
    France:
    
    Call this either the Maginot Opening, or a German Defense.  Regardless,
    it would have worked better if England hadn't moved aggressively against
    the Gaul.  Italy's army in Piedmont didn't help his cause either.  It'll
    take some world class diploming for France to avoid being a minor power,
    struggling to avoid elimination.
    
    Germany:
    
    Whether the Kaiser has set up an EG, an RG, or an EGR, Germany will have
    trouble advancing on French territories.  But the openings library
    mentions that this type of open is fairly pro-Austrian, and England and Russia
    should look over their shoulders.
    
    Italy:
    
    This opening is called the Western Lepanto.  And while it may not have
    started out as looking anti-Turkey, combine this with a fleet in Naples, and
    Austria moving from ION - AEG (or EAS,) and the sick man of Europe will
    have even greater worries.  Meanwhile the Tyrrhenian fleet is available
    to harass France.
    
    Russia:
    
    The Tsar looks to have snookered the Turk.  While the "Turkish Attack" can
    be used as a feint to draw attention away from the threat of a Juggernaut,
    the Fall moves seem to indicate that a steamroller is not in Europe's
    future.  Russia does have an interesting chance in Scandinavia with England's
    preoccupation with France.  I see a North Coast fleet in the future.
    
    Turkey:
    
    Turkey opened looking to the west, and now has to be looking at the best
    ways to optimize his defense.  If any player, other than perhaps
    France, wants to see Italy and Austria draw sabers, it is Turkey.
    
    And now, the public humiliation.  I return you to your regularly scheduled
    broadcast messages.

    Hi Pitt
    Tried calling you at the number listed for you in one of the first =
    "notification messages," but it was your work number.  So let's try the =
    e-mail route, and hope your system is up... Really would've rather =
    talked to you, though, vice the e-mails...
    
    What do you envision for (1) German cooperation with E/I versus France, =
    and (2) build ideas for this year (perhaps in a cooperative mode with =
    me)??
    
    The two are exclusive, i.e., if you want to finish off Frenchie first, =
    then just tell me and I'll build two for the south.  If, however, you're =
    playing balance-of-power and want to wreck E/I's day, I have a =
    recommended set of builds/moves:
    
    BUILDS:   Germany (A Mun + F Kie)        Russia (F StP[nc] + A War or =
    Sev)
    
    MOVES:  Ger:  Kie-Hel, Den-Nth,  Bur-Bel (Hol S) and Mun-Bur?
    	   Rus:  StP(nc)-Nwy, Swe-Ska  (or Swe-Nwy and StP-Bar)
    		War-Gal (if I'm after Edi) or Sev-Arm (if I go with Edi vs Hohn)
    
    If England builds as expected, he'll have F Lon for the 'east'.  This =
    move kills bel, bounces Nth, puts 3-4 fleets on the front immediately, =
    and allows us both to go +1 by fall (you in Bel, me in Nwy).
    
    This is an extreme idea, and one I wouldn't recommend unless I knew you =
    were genuinely concerned over the E/I (are you?).  But if there is =
    interest in Berlin, this move effectively cuts Eng to 4 (doubtful he'll =
    get a build this fall), and may even cause E/I to lose ground elsewhere =
    (should France believe all this and make the right moves, for example).
    
    Why would I rpopose this?
    Well, I could use some centers, and Edi will get the lion's share (at =
    least this year) down south--I could use a build or two.
    Secondly, from a purely self-interested point of view, the closer you =
    and I "prove" our respective worths to each other in such an overt =
    cooperative measure, the more solidified e can assume out R/G friendship =
    is....not to mention we eleminate the English threat to either of us for =
    many years (if not forever).  =20
    
    I mean, who's willing or able to help England if we do this?  =20
    
    Again, this is just for your consideration if you're genuinely worries =
    over the future E/I link-up.  If you are willing to take your chances =
    and help them in France (hopefully they'll give you Par??), then by all =
    means, press on, and forget I even mentioned the above.
    
    Would love to hear from you, old chap.

    Hi, everyone,
    Thanks to Andy for the update on how the Judge "announces" late
    players and orders.  I believe his understanding is correct and
    I appreciate the time he took with it.  This demo game and the
    saved press is proving to be interesting for a wide variety of
    purposes.  Unlike other Demo games with experienced Judge players
    it also is recording the "learning process" of how to work with
    the Judge.  Some problems have been made public and others have been kept
    private but can be investigated when the game is finished by
    interested parties.  I, of course, have to be careful about
    releasing private information until the game is completed so
    I appreciate ESPECIALLY having expert novice advisors like Andy
    hanging around.
    
    Jim
    
    PS That reminds me, if you do write private messages updating the
    game to me, remember that what you've written is already there and
    there is no need to recap it.  Thus, you can write in shorthand
    like, "What I said to X was just trolling for info, but I really mean
    what I said to Y".

    Amici,
    
    Struggling to find some way to hurry along Italy's growth, I've come up
    with this thin straw. If Edi is obviously attacking Germany in the Spring,
    there might be some chance for Cal to deal with Pitt: "I'd be happy to send
    in the cavalry against Austria if only I could get Marseilles."
    
    If Germany has an A Gas, then that one at least would be useless to him to
    defend the homeland, and maybe he'd be willing to use it for Gas-Spa
    (letting Italy capture Mar). But he'll probably suggest that I support him
    to Paris instead. I'll be thinking about how I could plausibly refuse this
    support. Hard to think of anything off hand, though. Well, maybe I can set
    it up so that I can reasonably say, "If Pitt gets Par, then it still takes
    more than another full year for Cal to get Por, Spa, Mar; but if Cal gets
    Mar, then the other three would fall in one more year." Hm. I think that's
    probably going to be true, too.
    
    
    Cheers!
    Gentle King J

    Edi is doubtless after England as his #1 alliance choice in the post-T/F =

    I have fought every proposal Edi has made that gives him more benefits =
    than me (part self-interest, part theatrics, to make him 'feel' he's won =
    the "negotiation victory").  We have to be careful we don't go =
    overboard, because he'll read false praise/false promises as well as any =
    of us would. Nonetheless, he's getting BUL and one in Turkey, not to =
    mention MUN...and he's discussed KIE, to boot.  So yes, keep him on =
    board for another couple turns and feed him wondrous tales of Brave =
    Ulysses, but after that, all bets are off.   We'll need him to occupy =
    Pitt, but that won't take long.
    
    As long as we all comprendesz-vous, then we can keep the QC Subset =

    The real reason that Edi wants you to build a F Stp is as follows, I think.
    One way or the other, he knows that our Quad will come apart in a couple of
    years, once the primary victims are on the ropes. Then he will either be at
    war with you or allied with you against me, and in either case he certainly
    wants you to have two northern fleets. You'll make a useful ally to him or
    an easier target if you have that unit unavailable for anti-Hapsburg
    duties. There is no doubt in my mind but that all his 'advice' now is with
    an eye to three or four seasons down the road (thus he wants me to give
    Italy very little help against France, to keep the Western option nice and
    soft for Austria too).
    
    Edi is also dropping me little hints that he wants the Big Breakup to  see
    him and me still together (so touching--we hardly even know each other and
    he's nearly proposing matrimony! <sniff>). I'm afraid the hints were so
    cryptic I couldn't tell what he had in mind. But in any case I'm feeling
    more urgent about getting a build for Italy asap.
    
    Well, we do have to be careful. I think the main thing (now that the three
    Subset Conspirators have more or less settled our minor disagreements) is
    to keep Edi on board for as long as possible, and especially to prevent him
    from locking arms with Pitt. My recent note to AIR was written with that in
    mind.
    
    We need about another year to be in a position where the three of us can
    just fight everybody if necessary. So, a couple of things we can do to keep
    Edi happy enough to follow through:
    
    1. Soon he'll probably start feeling me out more explicitly, like "In two
    seasons will you be ready to help me against Russia [or Italy, pick one]?"
    And I will nod vigorously. That'll give him the confidence to continue
    cooperatively for a little longer. Do you think this is right? Or should I
    always knit my eyebrows (virtually speaking, of course) and express dismay
    over the very idea of stabbing my beloved allies...? (Edi doesn't know me
    from Adam, and I've tried to give him some reason to think that I'm one of
    those crazy e-mail players motivated by unfathomable confusions never
    encountered among sensible postal players. He just told me that people pay
    too much attention to stalemate lines, so I quickly responded that I think
    almost everybody pays much too *little* attention to stalemate lines.)
    
    2. He should be promised an almost foolishly large share of spoils. Faz has
    already agree to give up the larger share of Turkey. We should also be
    prepared to agree that Austria would get another German center besides
    Munich. Put stars in his eyes, keep him from seeing too clearly. Promises
    that fall due over the horizon are cheap trinkets. Only let's not be too
    obvious about it :)
    
    3. I dunno. Any ideas?
    
    
    
    I understand a certain Russian gloominess at this point. Faz, you are being
    asked to open a second front before the others, and you have the Beast at
    your threshold too.
    Hang in there, the day will brighten. You have our moral support!
    
    	F Eng & A Tun morallyS F Swe.
    
    There, now you are invincible.

    Dearest KaiserPitt,
    
    Not much word from you recently.
    
    I must inform you that shortly after the results of the second season's
    movement, quite a lot of powers (everyone who spoke to me) urged me to
    build two fleets on the North Sea. How strange, thought I. So obvious that
    I will build F Lvp, or have I won my big gamble of a move against France
    only to let him live through the midgame to have his revenge? No, I'll be
    nailing down that coffin.
    
    Well, I did manage to persuade *most* of them of the wisdom of my preferred
    adjustment, but not all. A certain party continues to believe (or rather,
    insist) that my meager resources are best spent on my east coast. I cannot
    bring him around to seeing it my way. But as I understand the rules, *I*
    get to give the actual order, so you will see an Irish Fleet tonight.
    
    It would be embarassing for me if my critic should be able to point to a F
    Kie and laugh at my naivete. But I'll think no more about that!
    
    There's no doubt in my mind that some fiendish plan is brewing in Vienna,
    and that the fiend has some eager cohort on a string, too. I don't know
    just what's up. Keep your ear to the ground.
    
    
    Cheers!

    Dear Quads,
    
    Is there some feature of the situation that I'm not seeing?
    
    It is fairly obvious that Italy and I do not want Germany actively helping
    the French. But aside from that possibility, there isn't much that the poor
    men of Europe can do that will bother us rich quads. You know, four against
    three, we have more guns than they have, etc.
    
    I will play Good Cop/Bad Cop if you think that's to some advantage, but
    really all we'll have to do is play the less subtle but equally amusing
    game of Everybody Pile on Germany. So if Austria and Russia just go ahead
    and take those two centers from Turkey, and Italy and I tighten the noose
    around France (it looks like we might not actually deprive him of his
    beloved centers this year, but we should have him ripe for killing by the
    end of '02), as far as I can tell the only other business is to make sure
    that Pitt doesn't get a surprise attack in against any of us. And the
    original proposed moves, War-Sil, Vie-Boh, Tri-Tyl, look to prevent any
    ugly German moves. I'll certainly prevent him from slipping in to the North
    Sea.
    
    I will simply get a fleet in position to support Italian attacks in '03.
    That fleet plus my A Bre will be enough force. Italy is then left to mop
    up, using those supports as he will, and my other four units get stuck into
    Germany's back.
    
    All of this seems to be nothing more than proceeding according to plan.
    It's a good plan, shouldn't we just stick with it?
    
    Ah, yes, there's yet another from Tsar Faz. Yes, that's how I see it too,
    just about like that.
    
    Cheers!
    Gentlissimo King Jamie

    Hello again guys
    On this, the last few hours prior to build submissions, I wanted to =
    check out the QC Alliance and make sure we're all still in synch.
    
    In the north, I'm pretty much determined to build A War and join in =
    Edi's proposed S'02 attack (always per the plan) against Germany:  =
    Ukr-War, War-Sil, Swe-Bal, Vie-Boh and Tri-Tyo.  No one is going to help =
    the Hun, which means Mun and Ber should fall, even if it means I lose =
    Swe in the process.  Eng strikes for Nwy with one fleet under this plan =
    (I also like F Lvp, Jamie.)
    
    This part also sees me using A Rum S A Ser-Bul while trying for Arm.  =
    Then in fall, Edi uses Aeg and Bul to support my Rum-Con (via convoy).  =
    This clears the Balkans for DMZs and reduces Hohn to an impotent two.
    
    You guys do whatever voodoo is necessary vs France, and perhaps have =
    Jamie ready for a 1903 strike vs Germany...sort of like a delayed fuse =
    munition.
    
    Under this scenario, I build +1 (+Con, +Ber?, -Swe) or stay even.  Jamie =
    gets Nwy and whatever else.  Edi goes +2 (Mun and Bul), Italy should get =
    Mar(?), Germany goes -1 (or 2), losing Mun and maybe Ber.  France, =
    well...I don't ever see him recovering.  =20
    
    This also provides no incentive for a G/F linkup, because Pitt thinks =
    it's "only" A/R attacking him, with the west "business as usual." =20
    
    What say all of you?  If I don't miss my guess, this is what the =
    original plan was all along, and NOW we can put it to fruition.  Edi, =
    this commits you and I in S'02 to an attack (rather than any delays and =
    hovering around until "later"), but I think it achieves the right punch =
    at the right time.  After all, each of our three foes (F, G and T) are =
    reduced and/or isolated, and we have the forces necessary to cause them =
    all some grief.
    
    Your thoughts, ideas, or last-minute opt-outs?  I really hope we stick =
    with the plan.  From a greedy-slob , self-serving point of view, it's =
    the one that benefits Russia as well as ALL of us.

    Hi Jim,
    Here are my thoughts for the Winter 1901 turn.
    
    Russia faces 1902 with some tough choices.=20
    
    1) We can "stay with the plan" proposed by Edi and the other =
    Quadripartitie Continuum folks (E and I).  This would mean supporting =
    Edi to Bul in spring while I try to force Arm with Sev and Bla.  In =
    fall, Edi's forces support my convoyed Rum-Con, and Hohn is down to an =
    impotent two.  In the north, I'd let Eng get Nwy while I sail swe-Bal =
    and War-Sil.  (Edi is supposed to move to Tyo and Boh this turn, to =
    complete the circle of pain.)
    2)  I can play the rogue and try a variety of permutations, two =
    "biggies" of which are:
    a) Anti-Eng (build F StP(nc) and have Germany sail for Nth while I take =
    Nwy and Bar).
    b) Anti-Aus (support him to BUL with Bla, and move Rum-Ser, Sev-Rum =
    behind him, commensurate with an invasion of Gal).  This, of course, =
    throws him and Hohn together, although Hohn can't hurt me as presently =
    configured.
    
    These (and others) are not tied to each other, i.e., I can stay with Edi =
    while hosing England, or vice versa. There are more than these options, =
    but thinking about stabbing Edi without help gives me a headache!  The =
    bigger headache, however, happens when Edi gets to 7 in 1902 and I have =
    NO Italian forces available to contain him.  (And in a horror situation =
    that I pray only exists in my paranoid mind, what if A/T team up and =
    smack me in Rum and Gal while Edi convoys to Italy this turn and takes =
    Tri?  if it was a greedy, tunnel-visioned slob like me, that's what =
    *I'd* do!)
    
    Much of my dilemma comes from Edi's call last night.  He wants me to =
    build F StP(nc) ((angering Eng)) and then move "unsuspecting" to Ukr-War =
    while he 'fake attacks me' with Vie-Gal, to throw Germany off the =
    trail--followed by a fall 1902 reversal and movement to Tyo and Boh.  =
    Ah....yeah.
    
    I know I'm just being overly nervous, being the guppy among the =
    barracudas.  Still, the "kill Turkey then turn on Austria" plan depends =
    on a strong Italy for the other pincer, and I don't see him paralleing =
    Edi in power--so if someone has to do the job, it may be me.  If I do =
    stab him, it boilds down to Turkey (of all people)!  Does he join me and =
    help kill Edi, or see that now's the time to pay me back for the 1901 =
    slaps?
    Only my hairdresser knows for sure....
    
    Bottom Line:  None of this matters until I see what the Hun and the Turk =
    build.  I may be pleasantly surprised by both, but I'm not holding my =
    breath....

    Guys,=20
    Decided to send this your way after talking to Edi and then replaying =
    the board.
    
    1) Germany.  Edi and I had discussed a delay in hitting Germany until =
    Fall 1902.  In retrospect, I see no utility in such a move., for the =
    following reasons:
      a) Germany will *NOT* be suspecting a combined A/R hit in spring.  The =
    timing will be sweet, to the tune of:
    	AUS:  tri-Tyo, Vie-Boh
    	RUS:  War (build) to Sil, Ukr-War (thence to Pru)
    	Munich is a goner, and the chances of Berlin falling (assuming Swe-Bal, =
    too) is equally good.
    
      b) Not building in the north keeps King Jamie happy.
      c) This is within our combined resources, as Turkey will be down to =
    two in Fall (losing Bul to Edi in spring, and Con to me in fall).   =
    And--quite honestly--the E/I doesn't need Germany in France, and *no =
    one* is going to help Pitt, right?
    
    	In fact, E/I (probably Eng) can play "good cop" to our "bad cop," =
    offering Pitt alliance and support in fall, as a reaction to the "base =
    perfidy" of A/R -- and then stab him from behind a turn later!
    
    2) Builds.  I am now leaning toward A War in addition to A Sev.  Like I =
    said above, timing in this one is moot; why wait another turn and blow =
    the chance for taking SCs (Mun, Ber) in a fall season?
    
    3) The South.  We're solid here.  Edi's got BUL in spring, and will =
    support me to CON in fall.
    
    What say my fellow Quadripartiters?

    Hello guys
    Well, I have heard The Master's Voice (to cop the old RCA motto).  Edi =
    just called and has some interesting ideas and spin on things.
    
    - The North.  Thinks a build of F StP(nc) is a good idea (naturally--one =
    less thing near him)!  Envisions F Edi-Nwg,. F Lon-Nth (I told him there =
    is supposed to be a F Lvp in all this), followed by the fall turn of =
    Russian F Nwy-Swe, F Swe-Den, supported by F Den, thus precipitating the =
    first shots on Germany by...guess who?  The ol' Tsar, evil empire guy =
    once again. =20
    
    You'd think I'd learn.  I'm the heavy for opening vs Hohn, and now I'm =
    the "heavy" again vs Germany!   Speaking of...
    
    - Edi thinks we should possibly delay the fireworks on Germany for at =
    least a season, so "he's not the only one attacking Pitt."  Gag.  Wants =
    to perhaps "spoof" Pitt by having me go Ukr-War and him moving (get =
    this) Tri-h and Vie-GAL(!)!  This would be followed by him backtracking =
    to BOH and TYO in fall, as my A War goes to Sil.  Who's spoofing who =
    here?
    
    - The South.  Solid down here, or so it seems.  He wants me to support =
    him to BUL this spring, and then he'll 'probably' support me to CON in =
    fall, although "I can do a lot if I'm in ARM."  Sigh...as if Hohn will =
    let me in ARM!  I envision Smy-Arm (Ank S) and Con-Bla to bust my =
    support, knowing that he's going to lose BUL anyway.
    
    - Long-term.  Edi will be at 6 (minimum) in 1902, and has indicated =
    some...ahem..westward leanings in 1903.  This boes ill for your =
    continued wars vs France, as well as for any help *I* can expect from =
    you guys -- you won't even be done with France yet, and Cal will be =
    lucky to get one build this game year!  I'll be like the old Fugitive =
    series, with me as the one-armed man fighting the virile and studly =
    "Edi" Jansen atop the water tower.   And no ability from you guys to =
    help me out.   God, I hope Pitt is doing something harmless as regards =
    the east in '02, or none of us are going to accomplish a whole heckuva =
    lot before we usher in Phase II.
    
    Is it me, or are all my letters sounding increasingly depressing?  I =
    need positive stimulii, or at least another drink....
    
    Good luck vs France; let's see what the builds offer up, so we can =
    figure out the best way to handle the foes that rapidly loom large.  No =
    matter what my second build is, I'm gonna p*** someone off here, I can =

    Hello Cal=09
    Just a short note to you before I send a similar, "inclusive" message to =
    E/I; need to set the proper appearance for our English partner, eh wot?
    
    Edi just called.  He's pushing for me to build F StP(nc), as "we're =
    going to have to hit Eng sooner or later, and you might not be able to =
    build a fleet up there in 1903 or beyond..."  Not necessarily to hurt =
    Jamie, but to *at least* bamboozle Germany (Nwy-Swe, Swe-Den, supported =
    by Eng F Nth in fall).
    
    Quite honestly, there's some method to that madness.  Germany will never =
    expect a 180* reversal in fall if I'm in Nwy.  Also, this move ensures =
    England is '[with us," by forcing him to support me to Den if he wants =
    me to vacate Nwy!  Of course, it probably pisses him off, to boot...
    
    Cal, I'm *REALLY* concerned about your builds and any help vs Edi.  He's =
    now intimating that "perhaps it would be better" if we waited until FALL =
    to hit Germany!  he wants to move Vie-GAL(!!) in spring while I move =
    Ukr-War(!!!), to 'show surprise at being stabbed by Edi and further =
    confuse Germany."  Who's more surprised and bamboozled here?!
    
    What does this all have to do with you?  Well, let's assume Edi's really =
    just being 'truthfully devious.'  He gets Bul in spring, and supposedly =
    supports me to Con in fall.  What do you get in 1902?  Possibly nothing. =
     EDI'S TALKING ABOUT POSSIBLE 1903 MOVEMENT AGAINST YOU, WHEN TURKEY'S =
    DOWN TO AN INSIGNIFICANT AND HARMLESS TWO CENTERS.  And realistically, =
    what can you do to stop it?  You'll have maybe one fleet in the area =
    (TyS) and no builds....
    
    What am I supposed to do then?  Hit a 6-center Austria with a proxy Turk =
    ally, while you scrounge for centers and England presses on in his =
    private little war? =20
    
    "It is to laugh."
    
    I really wish in retrospect we just didn't stab Edi right off the bat, =
    Hohn or not.  It's going to work out that we'll (I'll) be in the soup =
    against them, anyway...how ironic.
    Ah well, if wishes were horses, eh?
    
    Do what you can to work on England for centers.  I'll make the same =
    noise in the next letter to the Sub-QC (should be out within 30 mins of =
    this one).
    
    Let me know your ideas, thoughts, etc, and whether you think Edi really =

    with a "later" hit on him....

    If you think that the Turks and Russkies are in cahoots would the following
    work...
    
    Austrian F ION-AEG
    Turkish  F CON-AEG  ==> bounces
    
    F TYS/NAP - ION
    F NAP/TYS S F TYS/NAP - ION
    
    The Italian fleet moves and dislodges Austrian fleet which can then retreat to
    EAS.  You get the bounce and keep the Turk out of AEG and then get two fleets
    on AEG in the next season on one Turkish fleet.
    
    Pretty ingenious if I say so myself.

    Sanguine indeed!  Not only does Germany INfrequently communicate, but he
    seems to have
     (a) nerves made of steel, (b) balls made of iron, or (c) "insider

    Well, funny you should mention that.
    
    My idea was that EG is worried about Austria, and generally plans to take on
    Russia next year. It seems to me that we therefore want a fairly strong
    Italy. Not too strong. Not strong enough to get all ambitious in the MAO,
    but strong enough to be a formidable neighbor to Austria.
    
    It's mostly that I feel I should be doing *something* about this Austria
    problem, and there's nothing I can do directly. So, I would kind of like to
    see Italy get a build this year.
    
    Am I right in thinking that you do *not* want to see Italy get a build? Or
    is that that you'd like to see him build, but not like to see him get too
    chummy with *me*?
    
    If the latter, I would be glad to leave the arrangements to you.
    
    But my broader question is, what can we do to hamper Austria's expansion? I
    know you have a direct interest. I feel I have an interest too. I'm trying
    to see the broad picture.

    I certainly hope my worry is needless.  You'll certainly have an

    I've *been* discussing it!  Frankly, I'm getting the sense that you're
    ducking me on that issue.
    
    >But I sense nothing concrete from you until France falls and/or
    >you get more builds; true?
    
    No, not true.  I asked for F STP and for you to take NWY, along with F
    SWE-SKA.  You take NTH (or try) in the fall.  I take PAR this year - we
    each get a build.  Because your moves in the north drive England closer to
    me, I can stab him next spring and we both gain in 1903.  How much more
    concrete can I get?

    Sanguine indeed!  Not only does Germany INfrequently communicate, but he
    seems to have
     (a) nerves made of steel, (b) balls made of iron, or (c) "insider

    Vienna, (Free Press)
    The night air was crisp and cool to the tongue and lips that tasted just the
    slight touch of bloodlust in the air.  BirSauron was quickly aroused from the
    Dark Tower and peered over the battlements to the Southeast:
    "What manner of deployment do we have there, could it be that the Pagan Dogs
    of the Sick Man's world have barked up the wrong tree? Or is this some clever
    ploy to re-establish the conditions of the Crimean War as a birthday present
    to the Czar?  Nay, for the Turboned one is not so inclined.  Could it be that
    he and the Northern Emperor have arranged their fleets to make a Cho-Cho train
    through Constaniople and on to the sunny shores of Greece.  In the face of
    such provocation clearly we must bring support for the cradle of civilization
    and protest the incursion of such Turkish delights in our back waters."
    
    The screech from the far west was also something of a distraction for the high
    collared noble of the Trans-astral planes.  Looking a far at the dark shadows
    of the fallen sun he could only comment:
    "Seems that there was some rather intense displays of things, amazing when
    once considers the talk of the wires on such prospects.  Seems like the good
    old days..."

    Ok. So, Russia has built the requisite armies, and Austria as expected. As

    Hello Pitt,
    
    I'm sorry I've caused you grief and (needless) worry with the A War
    build. Your builds were well-reasoned and "generic," covering yourself
    from whatever direction a threat might arise.  I like to think that's
    why I built War, also....
    
    You have nothing to fear from the Tsar.  I have no axe to grind with
    you.  Quite honestly, Edi and I continue to have our "love-in" regarding
    Turkey, but nothing lasts forever with two large land-oriented
    neighbors.  Warsaw is insurance for later.  Similarly, should the
    English prove greedier than normal, I can always cover the homeland
    after 1903.
    
    I'll try and be a little more open very soon.  Quite honestly, G/R
    relations won't (can't) flower much more until we discuss The English
    Issue.  But I sense nothing concrete from you until France falls and/or
    you get more builds; true?
    
    There's plenty of time for us to discuss mutual interests; but please
    don't fear Warsaw.  You have no need to.

    Jim,
    
    A few notes on my current state of mind.
    
    As a preliminary note, due to unforeseen work commitments
    and other things, I haven't had as much time as I'd wanted
    to devote to negotiations in this game.  Also, although I'd
    been in contact with Edi via phone, and I initiated contact
    with Mark via phone after Spring 1901, I think I should have
    been more active telephonically prior to the first turn, and
    if I had, I may have been in a better position now.  I
    genuinely believe (and indeed, I think psychological studies
    have shown, IIRC) that interpersonal contact of a more
    familiar nature (i.e. direct phone contact as opposed to the
    more impersonal nature of letters) allows one to forge
    relationships and trust more quickly and more deeply.  Oh
    well, that's my error, and I'm living with it now.  Perhaps
    it wouldn't have made a difference anyway.
    
    As for this past turn, I was genuinely thinking Mark might
    have had a change of heart, but I wasn't counting on it by
    any stretch of the imagination.  Still, I played it up front
    with him in the hopes that he'd take the bait and move into
    GAL.  He didn't, and I wasn't surprised.  He has a solid
    tactical advantage over me, and every reason to believe that
    Edi will go with him.  A WAR did surprise me, though.
    
    An interesting tactical note of my own with respect to
    negotiations was my deliberate flub of promising to have my
    A BUL support Russian A UKR-RUM if I decided to tap BLA,
    then resending the proper proposed move of A BUL support A
    SEV-RUM to Mark a few minutes later.  The impression I'd
    wanted to create was that I'd proposed the initial incorrect
    set of orders, then I'd sent my orders in and noticed my
    mistake, and notified him accordingly.  That would increase
    the chances of him not moving to ARM (the rationale being
    that I'd issued the support order of BUL S SEV-RUM, coupled
    with a tapping of BLA and a move of ANK-ARM) and trying for
    ANK instead, I reasoned.  No clue if it worked, but I
    figured it couldn't hurt.  In actuality, there was no way I
    was going to risk losing ANK and not building this turn, but
    Mark didn't know that.
    
    My build of A SMY was likewise obvious.  Mark has proven
    himself to be treacherous twice, and there's no way I can
    work with him until he demonstrates unilateral goodwill by
    pulling out.  Until then, I will happily nod to him and pay
    lip service to his efforts to convince me to adopt whatever
    plan o' day that he proposes, but I'm not buying any of it.
    
    My hopes now rest on my old friend Edi.  I believe he will
    probably take the hammer to me while I'm resting on the
    anvil of Russia, but I'm going to use every negotiating
    tactic and tool at my disposal to try to convince him not
    to.  This raises some interesting issues, I think, with
    respect to some meta-game factors.  I have never passed
    e-mail before in my life.  But I'm willing to do it now, to
    Edi, in order to try to save my skin.  I figure I don't give
    a damn if Edi tells Mark, since there's no way it could
    _further_ sour relations between Mark and me.  And I figure
    I've known Edi long enough that he won't lose respect for me
    for making the offer.  So I made it.
    
    I'm also going to be playing on any and all goodwill that
    I'm able with Edi, reminding him of our past history of
    working well together (and we have), of my steadfastness and
    trustworthiness as an ally (and I have been, for the most
    part), and basically invoking nostalgia and the "good times"
    of past games in an effort to convince him not to send me
    packing in this game.  This raises the question of whether
    such behavior is ethical, or if it raises the specter of
    cross-gaming.  I don't think there is any actual
    cross-gaming here, since Edi and I (to my knowledge) are not
    in any games together currently.  But is using credibility
    and judging another player's character based on past games
    and events ethical?  Is it something that is one of the
    benefits of a great deal of experience, or is it improper?
    Personally, I lean towards the former, but regardless, I'm
    doing it, because I'm up against the wall and desperate.
    
    Other than that, I'm going to keep my promise of hurling
    myself against Mark.  I'm going to offer Edi BUL free and
    clear, if he'll work with me.  I'll play willing puppet to
    Edi because my alternative is elimination.  I just have to
    hope I have the opportunity to dig myself out later on.
    
    I also intend to be more active than I was this past turn
    with other countries; as an experienced player, I of course
    know the importance of even remote countries to my own fate.
    I just haven't had the time to devote as much time to it as
    I would have liked.

    Thanks for the reply, and I hope your workload's slowed down somewhat.
    I will indeed call, although I want to wait a little while longer.  (No,
    nothing Machiavellian vs you; THAT part has already been done.)  I need
    to clear my brain as to the proper approach to take regarding the north,
    and then I'll be in touch.
    
    In the south, you can imagine the scenario:  Bla S Sev-Arm, Ser-Bul (Gre
    and Rum S), Ion-Aeg.  In fall, CON goes, and you're down to two.   But
    like I said, let me see the north--E/G seem to making some ... ahem ...
    chummy plans, and I may be diverted longer than planned.   I need to
    check out Edi's views on your survival...who knows, the Master may show
    some compassion!

    Regrettably, my negotiating has been rather limited to my
    immediate area of Europe, particularly concerning my own
    predicament.  This is because of time constraints,
    primarily, which is also why I haven't been able to reply to
    this until now.  You have my apologies.

    Heh.  Thanks.  Any attack on the treacherous Tsar would of
    course be welcomed. ;)
    
    Let me know if I can be of any service to you.  Thanks for
    your kind words and your effort in maintaining our

    Hi Edi
    
    Thanks again for your phone call; much appreciated!
    
    I think my build of A War was the best way to go if we're all in this
    for the long-run (i.e., as long as we want to see F and T reduced before
    G, that is)!   Given that Jamie is only sending one fleet eastward
    Edi-Nwg (or Nth), with bel supporting, I can always build a second unit
    in STP next turn and take the place, if I get the urge.   Or I can sail
    there now and claim necessity, but that would get messy.
    
    I am anticipating your moves to Tyo and Boh.  You should be anticipating
    mine to War and Sil, ALTHOUGH I may go War-Pru (Swe-Bal) instead.  This
    way, if Pitt uses Mun-Sil, Kie-Mun, then it's a crap shoot as to whether
    he defends two vs you in Mun, or two vs me in BER.   (He could, I guess,
    also move Den-Swe, figuring I'll go to Nwy (or Bal), or shoot for the
    Bal bounce and go Kie-Den.  What say you?)
    
    The advantage of us moving now is obvious.  No delayed attack means
    centers for us in Fall '02.  Also, with Italy and England tied down vs
    France, and woried over the Hun, it means we get the lion's share of the
    goodies before they.
    
    Let's kick some butt, and quickly, mon ami!

    That's a concern, I agree. We'll work on it. Maybe we'll think of a
    different approach. (We = Cal and I.)

    Hey, don't threaten *me*, bud. (One thing I love about Diplomacy is that
    you can threaten by proposing to sit on your hands.)
    
    But what are we disagreeing about? This is my chief concern, too. Getting
    Italy Marseilles ==> getting Italy his full complement of centers sooner
    ==> Italy prepared to join the fight against Austria sooner. And the
    keystone of it all is, securing some cooperation from Germany ==> getting
    Italy Marseilles.

    Ok, I give.  I will repeat the mantra..."the "only" concern is getting
    Cal centers quickly."
    
    I just don't see Germany giving support when he fears an E/I.  No
    support, no Italian centers.  No Italian gains, no fast front, no
    stopping Austria.  The snowball effect does indeed kick in, because,
    like Jamie, I want this thing to work, too.  But I'll withdraw from any
    Russian attack on Germany if I'm expected to take on Edi alone, or with
    an Italy that's got an 80% westward commitment.  I ("We") can't fight
    residue Turks, growing Archdukes, and benevolent Huns simultaneously
    unless we're concentrated and in position...and from the sound of
    things, we're going to be hitting people sequentially, and at
    less-than-100% strength.
    
    I'm thinking of some options in the fevered brain of mine, rest assured.
     This *will* work, you two *will* handle France, and truth and justice
    shall yet prevail!

    Cal,
    
    Ok, here's how I see it. We have two options. *I* could try to persuade
    Germany to get you Marseilles. Advantage: I have lots of leverage. He
    really needs my good will now, since his northern flank is awfully bare of
    protection, and his two Eastern neighbors are piling up quite a lot of
    armies. Disadvantage: Pitt may not be very enthusiastic about the idea of a
    big hefty Anglo-Italian alliance. I will test the waters very gingerly.
    Second, *you* could try to persuade him yourself. Advantage: your line
    could be, Germany is likely to need help against either England or Austria;
    Italy is his best friend in either case. Also, you have no impending
    conflicts with him at all. And, you are the smallest power with any future,
    so you are not threatening. Disadvantage: you don't have too much leverage.
    He's likely to say, "I'll just take Paris and help you out next year."
    
    It's at least conceivable that Pitt's real plan is to take Paris, then in
    the Fall strike at Belgium, and build two fleets. I doubt it; he'd have to
    be a lot more confident than he's entitled to be about Russia and Austria.
    But maybe he knows something, or thinks he knows something.
    
    What's your take?

    Amici,
    
    I want to move on to other things, and I'm about to send a note to Cal
    separately, but I will address this again, because I think it's important.
    
    >How you handle the Paris thing is up to you guys.  Again, for my
    >((unwanted)) two-cents' worth, I throw back the question we ALL banty

    Ok, look. The *only* concern here is getting Cal builds as fast as
    possible. You're implying that I am worrying about Germany attacking *me*,
    but that's utterly untrue.
    
    Without German help, Cal will not get any new centers this year.
    
    With German help, he gets Marseilles. And there's a snowball effect. If
    Marseilles this year, then a good prospect of *two more* next year ('03).
    (There is no question of Germany supporting John in Paris! There isn't a
    chance in hell of getting two non-German units against Paris until Cal has
    crashed through the French southern defenses.)
    
    
    But why the rush? We all know why. The sooner Italy gets his builds, the
    sooner he can take on Austria, whether aggressively (pre-emptively, let's
    say) or defensively (as Faz has hinted, Italy might just be playing defense
    sooner than we'd like). Cal's official position is that he wants to have
    his seven centers before he goes for Austria. Maybe he'll soften that
    position a bit, not my affair. But no matter what Cal decides, there's no
    question but that he needs as many centers as possible, as fast as possible.
    
    You know, in the big picture this doesn't really concern me. It's *your*
    two skins on the line down there. But this is the alliance I have freely
    chosen, and it's the one I want, and I want it to work. And if Italy is
    puttering away in Iberia when Edi starts getting really hungry, that's not
    good.
    
    You dig, daddy-o?

    Hi.
    
    Good builds from my perspective, all of them. If I'd been allowed to order
    them myself, those are the ones I would have ordered!
    
    Since my board moves are all pretty tame and obvious, I will spend my
    energies on other things this turn. Especially since you confirm (share) my
    worries about Edi (the guy, not the fleet), I will look into that matter. I
    will probably start strengthening my ties to Italy. My (vague) idea is that
    we want to weave a kind of net around Austria, containment. Tactically, I
    actually prefer attacking Italy all out at a moment like this. But
    diplomatically/strategically I think that might be a bad idea.
    
    With no build in StP, I feel that I don't actually need to make any
    promises to Russia. It *looks* like he's prepping for a fight with Austria,
    but, who knows? Anyway, he's not after *me*, that's for sure.
    
    I guess I'm saying, I think we need a plan now. Or not now right this
    minute, but we need to shape one over the next few days.
    
    
    Cheers!

<p><a name=195></a><b>Private message from <font color=ff00ff>Russia</font> to <font color=008800>Italy</font>:</b><pre>
    Thanks for the recent King James note regarding German builds and Edi's
    intentions.  I think the 'shaming' idea is a good one, i.e., telling Edi
    this should be a wide-open demo, not just a rehash of the 'same old'
    alliances and CYAs.  If it's anything like the 'shaming' I try on him,
    it will (a) not be taken personal and (b) will roll off him like water
    on a duck's back. Still, I think it should be tried.
    
    The German "stopping-up" of A/R for a year is indeed no big deal.  A lot
    of it comes down to the 'good cop/bad cop' thing (again!), in the sense
    that you jump him a couple turns after he's diverted down south.  I
    realize why he did it--he doesn't mistrust E or R, but doesn't trust us
    completely either, so he's centralizing forces for either front, with
    coverage everywhere.
    
    My only big concern with his army build in Kie is that it might give Edi
    a "weaseling out" excuse to not try his attack, i.e., "what if he
    bounces Faz in Sil and/or moves to Tyo against me?"   The logical answer
    to that is:  I move War-Pru (Swe-Bal?) while Edi does his attack. With
    this move, it's moot if he moves to Sil or not--it just means that we
    overextend his coverage and see whether Edi gets Mun or I get Ber (or he
    gets Swe)!  A crapshoot, really (and War's covered by Ukr).
    
    Bottom line:  I have no concern (humorous or real) about English
    imbalance of gain vs Germany.  It's doubtful you'll get "all the spoils"
    from a German attack, given that you have a F bel and a new F Edi for
    the total British war effort in the theater.   I welcome your presence,
    but I expect minimal effect until late '03 at best.  Ditto for Cal -- if
    Edi doesn't hit him before then.
    
    How you handle the Paris thing is up to you guys.  Again, for my
    ((unwanted)) two-cents' worth, I throw back the question we ALL banty
    about when discussing QC targets:  SO WHAT if you agitate him regarding
    Paris?  You owe him nothing, and his builds indicate no anti-English
    hostility (so, no preparedness to fight).  And if he supports John in
    Paris as a result, you work Iberia first.  Easy advice, coming from
    someone who doesn't have to muck about over there, I'll
    acknowledge....But who are your other enemies?  You have none!  And one
    turn of 'diplomatically saying no' to Germany will vanish when the
    invasion(s) come; he'll worry more about the East, than being spurned in
    Paris.
    
    After all "I" angered a benevolent Germany by standing by my guns and
    building War (claiming an Aus enemy); you should be able to stand up to
    the (one-fleet) Hun with similar rationale(s)...I have FIRM faith in the
    glibness of the English monarch's tongue and diplomatic weavings....you
    guys will think of something!
    
    We're on...now if only Edi sends a missive with encouraging news...

    The Inside Scoop from Whitehall (March 1902)
    
    My real views should be fairly clear from the partial press record.
    
    Here's a representation of the alliance structure from my point of view:
    
    (Germany(Austria(Italy(Russia(me)))))
    
    (where in the ideal case powers get stripped off the outside and fall by
    the wayside one at a time over the course of the game)
    
    Edi Birsan's four-way alliance plan sounded good to me for several reasons.
    One, I felt I hit it off with Mark Faz right away, so I preferred to ally
    with him for the long term. We have similar styles, and we both send lots
    of press. Two, as I said to several powers, my main fear as England is
    always that I might face an FG alliance; this Birsan plan would be a good
    contingency in case such an alliance emerged. Three, I liked the way things
    would be likely to shape up positionally in the midgame, with several good
    options for me. Four, I could sense a deep-rooted fear of Edi in the souls
    of Cal and Faz, which would bode very well for me if the four-way should be
    successful. And last, just for the reason Edi gave: it's nice to
    demonstrate something unusual in a demo game.
    
    I fanned the flames of fear a bit, and this little three-power 'subset'
    alliance was born easily. I think this is strongly to my advantage, for
    obvious reasons. If, as I suspect and hope, everything proceeds by plan,
    and Italy and Russia get stuck fighting Austria long after my main enemies
    are in ruins, I have several possible continuations, all good. One very
    interesting one would be just to *wait* while they struggle. Waiting in a
    midgame is an underrated strategy. [I learned this from Dan Shoham, Jon
    Tan, and Conrad Minshall, all of whom play France expertly and often adopt
    waiting strategies. I think I will play England much as France is often
    played, though of course lacking the great geographic flexibility, so I
    will have to make up for that lack somehow.]
    
    Of course, I want to see Russia and Austria attack Germany this year, while
    I stay very neutral, just taking Norway and manouevering a little around
    France. I would like to have fleets set up in Portugal and MAO, or Por and
    Bre temporarily, after about 1904. My other units attack Germany, and I
    will try to ferry armies in there. I'd then be prepared to go down the
    middle with my armies, or switch rapidly west and around Gibraltar if I
    decide to try to take the game to an early endgame with me fighting Italy,
    or conceivably switch east for a big stab against Russia (but this is my
    least favorite option at the moment).
    
    In any case, with such a wide open future, and players I don't know at all
    from a different "Diplomacy Culture", my main plan is to have a flexible
    position with nearly impregnable defense and various offensive potentials
    (armies on the continent are crucial for the latter).
    
    I find it interesting that I'm scheming *with* all the postal players
    *against* all the internet players. Not what I would have expected!
    
    Fun game.

    No surprises. Not for me, anyway. I was pretty sure Germany would build armies.
    
    A few thoughts bubbling out of my first cup of coffee this morning. (Ok, my
    second.)
    
    1.

    >compassionate toward England, he and I will be able to handle Pitt, =
    >whether he's got 1 or 2 fleets.  However, If he smells Edi or me coming =

    But who cares?? So, he'll blockade you guys and hold you off for a year.
    Then I'll cut him to ribbons from the top. As long as Edi remains engaged,
    we have nothing to worry about. Right? Or probably I'm not understanding
    what timing you mean.
    Are you afraid I'll steal all the goodies?
    
    2.

    >(as with Edi) promise Pitt Par, i.e., Bur-Par, Mun-Bur (i.e., "Pitt, =
    >move to Bur and pay us back by supporting Cal in fall"); think that =
    >might be a player?
    
    Yes, I do think that's the best line.
    Let me think about it for a day, ok? Cal and I should discuss it and
    coordinate. It's going to be just a bit touchy. I previously told Pitt that
    I definitely did *not* have a serious alliance with Italy. If I'm going to
    change my tune I want to plan to do it smoothly. But I do think it's the
    right idea, it's the only way we're going to get any help for Mar.
    Wait. Maybe there's another way. Well, Cal and I should discuss this
    separately.
    
    3.
    We're the only powers with more than one fleet. Just thought I'd mention that.
    
    4.
    I have an idea.
    We're all concerned about Edi jumping ship. I thought of a little leverage.
    I will tell him, at the next available comfortable moment, that I thought
    he wanted to have an interesting game, so that this Demo could Demonstrate
    something. But now (I'll continue) it's sounding like all he's really
    interested in is covering his own butt. I'll say that I find this a bit
    disappointing.
    
    What do you think? Do you think this might work? Would it irritate him?
    Cal, you have a better sense for this than we do, what's your feeling? If
    you think it might work, let me do it. From either of you it would just
    obviously be something you'd say to keep him off you.
    
    
    Cheers!

    Cal
    I'll try and send a longer letter today, but for now, here's my views on
    your most
    recent note.
    
    I think Edi is just biding his time to nail you, and I'm unsure as to
    the *depth* of any E/A collusion...but I definitely think there is a lot
    of that.  Germany's note to me last night intimated a "fake bounce"
    press war, and other such smokescreens, and he's made it clear he smells
    an A/R rat with the builds.  Like I said, as long as we can still get
    the jump on him, it's irrelevant.
    
    My fears are twofold at this point:
    1) England holds back and in reality works with Germany (or at least
    "slows down the timing of his role" in the crusade) while A/R take the
    brunt of the fighting.  I see parts of that now, as Germany flat-out
    refuses to think of anti-E operations.  (A key will be whether England
    supports Germany to Paris, or moves to help you instead.)
    
    2) The second fear is that Edi plays some sort of cutesy game and
    withholds his attack, or tries for Gal anyway, making me look the fool,
    and giving himself time to weasel out of anything.
    
    Both these fears are real, albeit minimal right now.  I believe Edi will
    do what he says, and the Turk build of A Smy shows that he's playing it
    more anti-R than anti-A, but still retains flexibility to cover all
    coastlines and threats.
    
    The German build is also somewhat benign -- "middle of the road"
    coverage, by not antagonziing Eng (via building F kie) and not
    antagonziing me (by building A Ber).  As such, we can still get units vs
    Mun this turn, and I can get to Sil (or Pru).
    
    It becomes a guessing game, really:  if Pitt moves Mun-Sil, Kie-ber and
    bounces, then it's two Edi pieces vs Mun, S by Kie.  So I'm almost
    channeled to War-Pru (Swe-Bal), and who knows what his F den will do.
    
    You are my biggest concern, partner.  Like I said before, I think you're
    being left out to dry in all of this, and I don't have any help vs Edi.
    I don't say that from a greedy point of view, I say it from a "if Edi
    hits Cal, who will help?" point of view....especially as you'll be up to
    your ears in the Western campaign.
    
    let me mull over some options and ideas, and I'll try to stay in touch.
    make sure England doesn't support Germany.  in all honesty, if he does,
    you'd be better to cut your French losses and let John buttress the
    north vs E/G while you guard your rear.  NOT what you want to hear, I
    realize, and certainly not "per the plan."
    
    I just hope everyone IS going "per the plan."  I think they've changed
    pages on us, Cal.
