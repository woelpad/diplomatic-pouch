    (I just told it F TYN, and it told me I had no fleet in the Tyrrhenian Sea.)
    
    Either that or the Judge altered its own source code. And I don't think it's
    *that* smart. (What have you JudgeMaint guys been programming these days,
    anyway, hmm?)

    Well I am back from the GenCon convention and I would like to join in the
    talk on what to do with Turkey.  I suspect that Cal is unable and unwilling
    to join in an attack on Turkey as all his actions have been to support
    Turkey.  There is nothing there to indicate he will come over to our side.
    
    I am willing as I believe strongly that Hohn will drop Cal in a flash to go
    ahead.  Now that he has StP and can probably hold it for 2 years he will be
    looking to sweep through Italy and hold tunis for the win.
    
    We have to consider that Italy may be helping him to win intentionally.
    Anyway I am here and would like to participate of course in the draw.

    Deadlines for MOVES are always at 11:30 PM in the time zone of the
    Judge, BUT for adjustments, the clock time is taken as "real time"
    so since the retreats were released at noon last week the deadline
    for the adjustments also was noon.  I realize we all are "dumping
    on Judge coding this week" but that's the way the Judge coding always
    has been.
    
    Sorry, perhaps I'll try to make note of it next time it happens.
    
    While we're talking about deadlines, the next one is Monday, but I
    am changing it to Tuesday since I will be away from the machine
    next Monday and I have an "alert" that someone might have to request
    a one day extension.  I'd rather just grant it now.

    burgess@world.std.com as Master set the deadline
    for game 'ghodstoo' to Tue Aug 19 1997 23:30:00 EST.

    might worry that he was ignoring you preparatory to taking Munich or
    something.
    
    Apparently a trip came up at the last minute, John didn't give any details.

    Sort of.
    The difference is determined by the CLOCK parameter, not in any hard
    coding. (The defaults for the CLOCKs are coded in, though.) Jim, you could
    change it if you would rather have the minor phases processed always near
    midnight, too.

    >Germany:   Removes the army in Munich.
    
    Trusting soul, you are.
    
    Well, now.
    
    Here's how it looks to me. Turkey can't take all of the Italian centers
    (including Ven and Tri, I mean) this year. He probably can't get all of
    them next year, but he might. Therefore, it's up to you and me to take Stp
    next year. We have to be prepared to put four units against Stp, and we
    have to keep Turkey from getting into Finland, too. Hm. That might be
    impossible! What if Hohn orders Stp-Fin, and Mos-Lvn, Sev-Mos? Oh, no, it's
    ok, because we still have two moves next year, not just one.
    
    Right, so I will order Edi-Nwg-Bar, and Den-Bal-Bot. Ok? And are you
    willing to order Swe-Fin? Then even if you bounce there, we have S1910 to
    set up the taking of Stp.
    It's a shame you don't have the army in Nwy and the fleet in Sweden, that
    would add a little flexibility (more adjacency to Fin).
    
    
    I think Edi is correct that Italy is deluding himself. I don't believe he
    has a prayer of surviving the game. What could he be thinking?? So I figure
    we can have a 4-way draw, unless F and T try pulling back from the danger
    zones and eliminating us. But I'm not very worried about that. France would
    have to do all the work, and I think we'd pretty easily throw the game to
    Turkey.
    
    
    You?

    I think you're right that Cal is deluding himself. I can't see that he's
    got much of a prayer of surviving this game. Of course, he's taking you
    with him, maybe that's his desire.
    
    
    I'll recommend that John try to support you in Venice, but if Cal decides
    to take Ven and let Hohn have Tri, I don't think they can be prevented from
    doing that.

    Well, just to be clear, I *wasn't* dumping on the judge code (or coders).
    That is the LAST thing in the world I would do since I know just how much I
    personally benefit from the judges and the work of the coders and JK's and
    I have a pretty good idea of how little appreciation is ever expressed to
    them for it.
    
    My complaint, if that's what it was, was with me and the fact that I missed
    the fact that the deadline was at 1200 and not 2330.  I'm sorry that wasn't
    clearer.

    So?  Do I have a choice at this point?  It's either throw in with you and
    France or try to throw the game to Turkey.  If France is untrustworthy, MUN
    was dead anyway.  If not, SIL is better placed to impede Turkey.  And,
    besides, if France does try to squeeze me, I'm now worse off for doing what
    I can to throw the game to Turkey now than I would be with MUN.

    Not so long as he tries to play with Turkey instead of against him, no.

    Yep.  That's my strategy, too.  Nonetheless, I think you and I need to make
    it clear to John that we will consider any attempt to eliminate one of us
    as an attempt to eliminate both of us and that we will respond
    appropriately.  Yes?

    Uh huh.
    I guess I'll just stay out of all of that stuff, since my units are not
    very close to the Mediterranean. But I will repeat for you that I guarantee
    that I won't let France win.

    I don't have anything in mind. I will say that it has always been my
    heart's desire to own Norway (a little leftover project of mine from the
    opening :-)). But I am not in a big hurry. I feel very patient at the

    need to change what I suggested for your armies in Austria.  Vienna should

    Now that the Judge is back (assuming it still is), I'm having second
    thoughts. I think we should wait until Stp is secured to announce that we
    plan to share a 4-way draw together, or throw the game together. I also
    think we should announce this to John and Hohn (hm, never noticed that
    before) at once.
    
    What do you think?

    Good point. Dividing and conquering might seem more attractive than trying
    to take us both out at once. As Ben Franklin once said, "We must hang
    together, or most assuredly we shall hang separately."
    
    No rush since John is away. I'll write something later today.

    I have no problem with cutting you in on the draw, and I have no
    problem with a four-way.
    
    As for my chances of victory, I am still of the firm opinion that
    France is the larger long-term threat, in light of the stalemate
    lines.  It's true, I'm bigger right now, but I'm not going to stab as
    John claims.  Because if I do, I feel there is a strong chance John
    will win as a result, due to Italian throw-game leverage.

    >Hmmm...OK, why?
    
    Well, it's mainly just an uneasy gut feeling.
    What if John and Hohn heard the news and decided that if they are going to
    go for a two-way, they'd have to do it as soon as possible? Generally, I
    guess my point is that having everyone else proceed as they have been is
    what we want for the next few moves. We'd rather have no surprises. As long
    as Hohn thinks there is some chance that one of us will be harassing
    France, he is much less likely to decide he has to break out into the MAO.
    And I think that's about the only thing that could foil the big plan,
    Turkey's picking up a western center.
    
    It's not too big a deal. If you'd rather, we can announce our intentions now.
    
    >>I also
    >>think we should announce this to John and Hohn (hm, never noticed that

    Ok.
    
    Let's see, when is the move due, Tuesday? I'll be away for the weekend. I
    won't enter my moves until I hear from John, he might want Lon-Eng for
    support, just in case Cal hasn't come to his senses yet.

    No problem.  I need to hear from John, too.  Though we are not going to
    announce our agreement, yet, I still need to warn John that *I* might throw
    the game to Turkey if he doesn't work with me.  If the subjct comes up, any
    influence you can bring to bear to sway John to back me up will be much
    appreciated.

    It shouldn't.  IF Spring goes off on time, and IF there are no retreats,
    THEN I will set the Fall deadline to Thursday.  Do you seriously expect
    that?  I's say both IF's are questionable.  So, you should be fine.
    
    I will view your absence as private information as usual.

    Don't know if I was supposed to receive this but I don't really care.  I
    DO however want to correct the impression that I am trying to help Hohn
    "win intentionally".  Edi's sour grapes notwithstanding, France is in
    just
    as likely a position to win as is Turkey.  The difference is, France has
    everybody else on the board helping him against Turkey.  If I stab Hohn,
    then France waltzes to an 18 centre win.  This way, I have a chance to
    share in a draw.  I explained to France that I have no intention of
    trying
    to gain any ground against him.  All I'm trying to do in the Med is set
    up
    a stalemate line that I am a vital part of.  Similarly, I have no
    intention
    of moving my units so far from my centres that Hohn could slip into the
    win himself.
    
    BTW Edi, how was GenCon?  Haven't been to one myself since '77 when they
    held it at the Playboy Club in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin... :)

    Dear Jim,
    
    may I send the following message into the game or do you think it is
    not the case (observer interference of some sort).
    I am fairly confident that people like Jamie or Pitt know about this,
    and I feel they have an unfair advantage.
    At the same time if it is an observer pointing this out you might avoid
    problems of GM interference (helping AI and possibly penalizing GE)

    I think the moves are admirable.  Consider them made, barring any
    sudden tactical revelations.

    I have no problem with a four-way draw.  I'd prefer FIT, but it's not
    such a big deal to me that I'll risk galvanizing the entire board
    against me, thus risking French victory (which has been the major
    thing I've been trying to stop for the last several years, as you
    know; I still think he has the better long-term position in light of
    his small puppet power and his being beyond the stalemate line, but I
    digress).
    
    As for Pitt, I agree with you that he should not be in the draw.  The
    fact that he will accept John's offer does not surprise me, and I will
    plan accordingly.
    
    Thoughts?

    Yup, I got it both times and responded to it whcih obviously YOU
    never got.  Sigh.  Anyway, I've sent in these orders, but I'd advise
    you to move A Bud-Vie, s by A Gal as I have major reason to believe
    that Pitt will be working actively AGAINST us this turn and from
    now on.

    Well, it depends upon the GM.  The judge does keep track of dedication
    points, which go up with punctual behavior and down with late
    behavior.  But they only serve as a threshhold for entry to games, and
    few games have any meaningful threshholds.  And once points are built
    up, one can get away with massive irresponsibility.  I could quit 20
    or so games on USEF right now and still be eligible to join any game
    formed next week.  Also, many times you'll join a game, assuming a
    certain dedication minimum, and be asked soon after to 'make an
    exception' for a player who has some sob story about why his rating is
    low.
    
    Some GMs go further than looking at dedication points.  Mark Mulik has
    been known to keep a running tally of who is late during the game, and
    to enforce a 'three strikes' rule, with some strikes being forgiven if
    a player is on time for five game years consecutively.  I like this
    approach.  It does require more effort on the part of the GM, but
    let's face it, Judge GMs really are not being asked to do very much as
    thing stand.
    
    Hmm..my xbiff is beeping, I bet it's something from Jamie.  Hey, it

    I think emailers do consider availability when considering alliances.
    Players who are habitually late also habitually don't respond to
    messages, which tends to make them poor allies.  Unforunately,
    sometimes one is forced to make such an alliance.  What is worse is
    when you stab out of frustration, only to see the player take offense
    at having his punctuality questioned, and to then see him play much
    more seriously as your enemy!
    
    This has, naturally, never happened to me, because I never stab.

    First: I believe that John is away. He said about twelve days ago that he
    would be gone for a week, and I suspect that it just turned out to be
    longer than he thought. Note also that John has probably been the least
    late player in the game up to now.

    To some extent, I'm sure it does. If we had NMRs, I am quite sure that more
    players would send in provisional orders early.

    It is used. The main way it is used is that some games are set up with a
    minimum DEDICATION. You can't signon unless you have, say, 100 dedication
    points. This sort of thing is only mildly effective, since playing for a
    year on a given Judge will get you those 100 points unless you are late
    most of the time (or you've actually abandoned a power).

    Just speaking personally, I am more likely to ally with someone who I think
    is reliably on time. There are a number of reasons for this, in my case.

    Sorry for the delay folks, I simply spaced the deadline.
    Interesting in that in postal play I general send in two or three seasons
    at a time to avoid missing a deadline.  However that technique which is
    available here somehow, has never appealed to me because the game is
    delayed for lack of orders.
    
    I am again curious as to the nature of the game play.  It would appear that
    aside from a passive aggressive mental state towards deadlines that some
    players may slip into, I wonder if the no NMR policy actually encourages
    this sort of behavior response.
    
    While there is some record of who delays a game in the Email judge world,
    it seems that the delays have no effect in real game make up or function in
    any manner to provide a penalty for the behavior.  Not that I am a fan of
    punishment response to unwanted behavior... in real life.  As a social game
    I am always curious as to the structures of the small society around the

    Am I also correct in that lateness is not an issue within a email game and

    For example in a postal game I would not ally with a player who I thought
    was tending to miss deadlines as with the standard NMR policy in postal
    games he is unreliable and his orders may convert to civil disorder...in
    fact he becomes a perfect enemy or an ally of my enemy which is where I
    like to put them.

    I've always thought the best code improvement the judge folks could design would
    be a due date prompt.  I think a lot of folks use the deadline as a reminder to
    deal with the game in question and the end of the grace period as the true
    deadline.  If there was a way to make the game send out announcements on some
    pre-set schedule:
    
    "Game: ghodstoo (USIN) has F1903M due in 48 hours"
    
    "Game: ghodstoo (USIN) has F1903M due in 24 hours"
    
    "Game: ghodstoo (USIN) has F1903M due in 2 hours"
    
    
    or some easily programmed (by the GM in the game settings) system, I think late
    might become more of a big deal.  It could either go only to folks w/o a full
    set of orders or to everyone, and maybe it could list what orders were submitted
    so players could remember if what they submitted is what they still want.
    
    I have suggested this to judge maint and the general response was that it was
    among the many good proposals, but I needed to find a champion to get it done.
    I have tried to learn C, but I am not ready to work on judge code yet, so if
    someone hear wants to take on the role of champion, I will happily assist.
    
    I believe the culture of NoNMR developed due to the lack of internet
    reliability, (the post office may be slower but it is very reliable.  Internet
    providers can go missing for several days and i would make NMR really scary.
    However, more often than not, when we hear why someone was late it is either
    "very stressed in real life" or "oops, I spaced."  A "deadline pending" alert
    would address the latter and might even deal with some of the former, as a
    stressful life is often made less stressful by polite nags to deal with the
    crucial things, like submitting orders.  Right now the late notices serve that
    role, but like many of you, I feel a deadline should not be the reminder, it
    should be the deadline.

    Hello, everyone,
    
    Sorry to be a bit asleep at the switch.  John indeed is away, and I had
    been led to believe that he already had orders in for this turn.  Clearly
    that does not seem to be the case.  Although at this time, I will not
    reset the deadline, if I find some mail from him with an update, I'll
    let you all know.
    
    Jamie has described my understanding of the way NMRing is supposed to
    work in the E-Mail world.  In short, to my mind, the most important
    aspect of the "noNMR" rule is that it allows for "computer screwups"
    which happen far more frequently than with the much maligned USPS and
    AT&T.  This may well be such a "computer screwup" where John sent his
    orders before he left but they were not accepted or sent for some
    reason.
    
    Jim
    
    PS I will be a bit detached from E-Mail until Friday, I will try to
    watch but if you don't get instant response, you'll know why.

<p><a name=40></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=0000cc>England</font>:</b><pre>
    My understanding of the main cause of NoNMR default is the same as Rick's.
    Eric Klien's rule had to do with Electronic Protocol -- a game could not be
    run under his auspices if it allowed NMRs. More recently (as I think I've
    mentioned in this forum before), Nick Fitzpatrick has been as responsible as
    anyone for the prevalance of NoNMR: Nick will generally not score a game for
    the Hall of Fame if there have been any NMRs in it. (If a game is set to
    allow NMRs, but there never are any, he'll enter the game on petition.)

    I think it developed because it was really easy to find people who
    would play a game, but the people would loose interest after a couple
    turns, either because of other distractions or because of net
    unreliability.  Keep in mind that during the early days of email quite
    a number of the players were college students, who can be quite
    flighty.  As a result, early email games had huge problems with NMRs.
    It was not just that people were late with orders, people would just
    disappear.  I don't think that would happen so much with postal games,
    as the initial effort of involving oneself in postal play is much
    greater.  So, my understanding is that Eric Klien imposed a NoNMR rule
    because usually one NMR meant a player gone completely.  When this
    happens too often the entire game falls apart.
    
    I don't know if access was the problem so much as forcing players to be
    committed from the start.  Though the menace of net failure looms over
    Internet users all the time, for the most part most of us will not
    lose access for more than a few hours per year.  Maybe a day or two
    once every few years, if a major component fails completely.  I can
    only recall one time where a local compter failed, and I was forced to
    be a day late with orders in a Dip game.  And that's over ~9 years of
    playing.

    Ummm, here's your slightly addled GM, checking back in.  I have NOT
    waded through all of your messages this week yet, so I apologize if
    I have missed something that I have not addressed here.  I have been
    travelling all week and checking E-Mail very infrequently.  Anyone
    want to volunteer to wade through the 400 messages in my queue for
    me??  ;-)  Thought not.....
    
    1) John did tell me that he was leaving town on short notice, saying
    that he had orders in for the "current" season, but might need an
    extension of the next season.  I mistakenly understood him to mean
    that he had orders in for SPRING and that I only had to worry about
    retreats (should he have any) or Fall.
    
    2) Given my error, what I THOUGHT had occurred was that John sent in
    Spring orders that the Judge didn't accept, etc.  Since I was wrong
    about that, I do feel that a deadline extension to tonight is in order,
    which should make everyone feel comfortable, I hope?
    
    3) In sailing through a sampling of the press, I see that Jamie has
    resurrected our discussion about "unenforceable rules".  While not
    completely irrelevant, I feel that this issue is a case of "GM error"
    where I should have extended the deadline until aug 22 anyway because
    of a player absence, but misunderstood the request.  Thus, once my
    error became clear to all of you, "finishing up negotiation" and
    submitting orders was appropriate.
    
    4) I also note that we are facing additional deadline extensions in
    the next couple of weeks.  Is it going to be possible to fit Fall
    in before that?  I need to go back and look at exactly when people
    are going to be away.  I may ask to SHORTEN the fall deadline to
    keep us moving.  Again, please feel free to negotiate with that in
    mind today.
    
    Sorry again for the misunderstanding,

    Aside:
    there is a small but significant chance that the opportunity may arise to
    eliminate Germany without risk in the Fall. I have a feeling you may have
    suggested the Spring moves to open that possibility. If it's really risk
    free, hell, I'm game. But I do believe that Pitt would punish the attempt
    if he survived it by throwing the game to Hohn. I'm quite sure of it, in
    fact. So it would probably have to be outright elimination--leaving him
    even one center might be very risky indeed.

    Hi,
    
    As I just told Pitt, I'll be away from this evening until late Wednesday night.
    
    The possibilities for outcomes of this phase are too complicated to have
    any set plan ready to go for the Fall, but I thought I'd mention some
    options, since Jim may want to shorten the Fall deadline (to get it in
    
    
    before Cal goes off to Northern Ontario).
    
    One thing I thought of: if Pitt can take Stp in the Fall, I think he ought
    to do it.  (With the army, of course.) Then if John is in Kiel with his
    fleet, we might possibly arrange to dislodge that unit so John can rebuild
    it. Hm. No, we won't have two non-French units against Kiel. Unless Pitt is
    dislodged and retreats to Mun or Ber. But no, John was going to move to
    those. Hm. Oh well.
    
    Well, then maybe if there's an extra center that one of us could get, John
    should get it so he can build, and then one of us smaller powers could take
    something from France next year and John can remove the northern fleet?
    
    Pitt, even if you do get Stp, I would like to leave one of my fleets around
    there to participate in the maintenance of Stp. The other fleets can go
    back west to help out around the MAO if necessary. Or we might need one of
    mine in Baltic to hold the line.
    
    Anyway, if you two come up with a plan in my absence and just tell me what
    it is, that might allow me to enter my Fall orders quickly when I get back.
    
    Cheerio,
    Gentle King Jamie

    > Is it going to be possible to fit Fall

    I am leaving tonight, returning Thursday morning. (Actually Wednesday
    night, but late, and I probably won't get a chance to log in that night.)
    
    If John manages to get orders in within the next couple of hours, and if
    there are no retreats--or if the retreats are fairly trivial from my
    perspective--then I may be able to submit my Fall orders before I go away
    this evening (early this evening, I'm afraid). But I may not. Actually, I
    think there's only a very small chance of my doing that, given the fairly
    small chance of the current phase being processed today at all.
    
    I believe that Cal leaves on Aug 29th. I don't think I should have any
    trouble getting my orders for the Fall in before that. So we ought to be
    able to process F1909 before Cal goes away. Unless there are other holidays
    I don't know about, of course.
    
    > I may ask to SHORTEN the fall deadline to

    Remember retreats.
    Don't shorten it (the Fall movement deadline) to Wednesday, but if you want
    to shorten it to Thursday night, I think that's ok with me. It's kind of
    tight, and if I have some momentous decision to make next season (and
    there's some chance of that) I might be pretty nervous about it, but in any
    case I'd be back to plead for an extra day.
    
    As long as I have no retreats (and it would be a very peculiar combination
    of events indeed that would cause me to have one), you can certainly go
    ahead and process the retreat phase without me.

    Do you have some reason to believe he won't?  But I do understand
    that it is likely they will be processed after you leave.

    Sort of. I thought he would have submitted them by now. Since he hasn't, I
    suppose he may not get around to it, or is waiting for something else.
    If there are WAIT flags set, then the move won't be processed until
    midnight, anyway. (And there are, I just checked.)

    I have no problem with shortening ALL the deadlines from here on in.
    Until or unless the situation becomes less static (he said ignoring
    all the home centres that changed hands last year) I don't think
    there are much more than tactical considerations to discuss.

    Thanks for the defence, Jamie.  HoF has taken some negative press, especially
    in the snail mail world.  I guess I assume that no-one is desperate enough
    to manipulate the system badly enough to  deliberatly NMR a game.  Though
    most NMR games have NMR's somewhere along the line, so I can think of
    better scams.
    
    Incidentally, the HoF is two things.  The first is a database.  All games
    are in there, regardless of status.  NMR and nonNMR games.  Secondly
    is the point system (which I have claimed for 5 years now, is temporary,
    until I can institute some kind of zero sum based system).  NMR games
    (among other things) just don't get points.
    
    I don't believe Conrad's system used NMR games either, but I would
    have to check.  Conrad, incidentally, used the HoF database to generate
    his DSI system.  I have always made the HoF database (which includes lots
    of information for each game and player, which the HoF doesn't use) public
    so anyone can take it, and develop whatever type of point system
    they like!  Of course, they have to rely on me, to maintain the database.
    
    The next HoF?  Good question.  The last one was last September.  My life
    kind of fell apart last fall, and I was avoiding it.  The backlog is huge,
    I started getting back into it seriously in April, but then work blew up
    big time.  I think I averaged 70 hours weeks since the beginning of May.
    Things have quietened up a bit lately, but I have taken the opportunity
    to visit the real world a little.  Hopefully, there will be something
    put together, with the traditional August 31st cutoff date, to create
    a hall97 game.  I'm hopeful that September will be quiet, and I can
    clean up the mess.  (and that my hard-drive will not do something
    stupid while there are the results from other 500 games sitting
    there, without backups ...)

    Certain things are going to be left to a sort of honor system, no
    matter what, technically.  People can lie about needing deadline
    requests, too.  But some things are rightfully considered outside the
    realm of the actual "game" and inappropriate.  Willfully ignoring the
    deadline is one of those things, IMO.

    On _occasion_.  I'm often insanely busy, and until recently I'd been
    involved in quite a few games (I put a moratorium on gamestarts, due
    to my busy-ness).  Sometimes, I just don't remember to send orders in
    until reminded.
    
    Since I monitor my e-mail in the background very often, though, I am
    almost invariably able to send my orders in immediately upon
    notification that orders are due.  As I said, 90% of the time within
    an hour or two of notification.  And I still get my orders in on time
    often enough to have racked up a ton of ded points in the space of
    less than a year.  Using the late notification as a prompt is the
    exception for me, rather than the rule.
    
    BTW, I think that the previous poster who urged implementation of a
    "reminder" prompt regarding orders had a great idea, assuming the
    behavior I describe above significantly bothers you and others.

    Right.  The problem is exacerbated by the fact that he was the last
    one to turn orders in.

    "Stupid?"  I wouldn't put it that way.  I think it's acting pursuant
    to the spirit of the rules, is all.

    But keeping the GM in the loop as the neutral arbiter of the game and
    things like deadline extensions is the appropriate thing to do, I
    feel.  And I have little doubt that Jim would have been more than
    willing to extend the deadline, in light of John's unexpectedly longer
    trip.  I would have had no problem with that, either.
    
    It's a question of procedure, though, which I believe is important.
    There is a world of difference between one player making a unilateral
    decision to hold up the game, and the GM making an independent
    decision that the game should be extended.  Placing that discretion in
    the hands of the GM is where it belongs.
    
    As for your point about it potentially taking longer, personally, as a
    practical matter that may be true in some cases.  Alternatively and
    ideally, the rules and guidelines would have been more firmly
    established before the game began, so these things could have been
    decided.

    You mean, John could have immediately submitted orders when he returned.
    
    But he had been away for over a week, that would have been a very stupid
    thing to do. He could have requested a deadline extension, as you note, but
    that would have held up the game even longer, while we waited for Jim to

    Personally, my objection to this type of behavior is that it is
    inconsiderate of your fellow players, to willfully ignore the
    deadlines.  I've missed quite a few, I fully admit, but in 90% of the
    cases I get my orders in within 1-2 hours of the deadline.  That's
    because like someone else mentioned, I tend to use the deadline
    announcement as a prompt.
    
    But I've never deliberately ignored the deadline.
    
    The proper thing to do in a situation such as this is to request a
    deadline extension, IMO.  The way it is now really doesn't sit well
    with me, to be honest.

    That's also my view.
    I was just citing Jim's reason, as I remember it (his reason for *not*
    having a no-negotiations-after-deadlines rule, namely, that it is
    unenforceable).
    
    Just to make sure there's no misunderstanding, the rule I *prefer* is the
    one I've mentioned: late parties are not supposed to send or be sent to
    while they are late, but others may negotiate freely among themselves even
    after the deadline, so long as their orders are in (and error-free).

    To jog your memory, as I remember it he gave as his reason that he does not

    orders in could negotiate freely after deadline. That's the rule I like,
    unenforceability notwithstanding. But of course I will take advantage of
    the opportunity if it is legal, and I thought it was in this game.

    I was going to think through the suggestion, but if it's ok with both of
    you, it's fine with me.
    
    By the way: John, as you will have seen if you read all the broadcasts, Cal
    seems to be pretty severely deluded into thinking that he is safe from
    Turkish attack as long as he 'doesn't stray too far from home' (and he says
    he thinks you are as much a threat to win as Hohn is because 'everyone is
    helping' you). For this reason, Pitt and I thought it was crucial that we
    should be able to get Stp by the end of next year. I'm sure I don't have to
    explain further.

    I've (provisionally) decided to join you and Jamie to stop a Turkish solo.
    Jamie and I have discussed it at length and we will do what we can to take
    STP.  I have ordered SIL-WAR, though it's sure to fail, in order to at
    least tie up one or two of Turkey's armies.  I'm hoping that you will move
    your armies west, as well.
    
    Here's the thing, though, John.  Given a choice between a draw that doesn't
    include Germany and a Turkish solo, I'll take the Turkish solo.
    
    Neither of those options are very appealing to me, however, and I'm really
    hoping for a draw that includes me.  It seems to me that, in order to
    ensure this happens, my only real weapon is the threat of doing what I can
    to throw the game to Turkey.  I think I'm in a pretty good position to do
    that and I *will* do it unless I see some concrete moves from you that are
    unambiguously in support of German survival into a draw.  I apologize for
    the naked threat but there it is.
    
    I fully expect you to take MUN this year.  I also fully expect that you'll
    help me take BER in exchange (unless by some miracle I should take WAR).
    I'm not looking to grow, only not to shrink.  I will not accept any plan or
    set of orders that does not allow me to maintain my size and that does not
    also allow me to maintain the threat of throwing the game to Turkey.
    Without that threat, I would be powerless.  I hope you see my position and
    my reason for taking it.
    
    Having said all that, I feel quite certain that you and Jamie and I can
    easily shut Hohn down if we do work closely together.  I'm reasonably
    certain that Jamie's on board with that plan.  I hope you will be, too.

    Well, sure, in a game that permits NMRs.
    
    But if you're playing in an NMR game, presumably you aren't too interested
    in Hall of Fame records anyway. It is pretty dumb to play in an NMR game in
    pursuit of Hall of Fame points, since the odds are extremely good that
    there will be at least one NMR.
    
    Note also that the Hall of Fame is only one way to get 'recognized' for a
    game. The HoF points system is not any kind of Official Hobby Scorekeeping;
    it is Nick's. (This is a fact that it's good to mention now and then. Every
    once in a while someone starts complaining about some unfairness or other
    in the HoF. I generally ignore these and have little sympathy with them.
    The Hall of Fame is just one set of records, it keeps track of certain
    things that many people seem to be interested in. And Nick annually invites
    the players who score very high in a certain dimension to play a demo game.
    The next one must be coming pretty soon, by the way, right Nick?)
    Since Nick does it very carefully and has long records, his is a popular
    one. But there are others. I am not sure how Conrad Minshall treats NMR
    games in his index, the DSI, for instance. (Conrad thought there were some
    shortcomings in the HoF system, but rather than complain about it he just
    made up his own system. Of course, it's a lot of work.)

    Many of us regulars have unusually good connections. All the .edu and
    employees at big .com companies, I guess.
    
    I gm a fair number of newbie games, and I find that *most* players don't
    have much connection trouble, but a significant minority do. And
    unfortunately a large percentage of the continental Europe players have
    
    
    regular failures. I guess that's largely the .nl players, the other
    Continentals are still lagging well behind *them*. Scandinavia seems to be
    ahead of the European pack.
    
    >This from Nick:
    >>True, but generally I was following Eric, and Danny Loeb, who appears to

    I agree. I think Nick was kind of kidding. Or just being Eeyore.

    I've found about the same.
    My current newbie game has had three replacements. The first one was a
    paradigm of responsibility, though -- the original player quickly found
    that he couldn't put in enough time, asked to be replaced, and played
    another season until I could find a replacement. The second guy just
    vanished without a word, and didn't return my telephone call. That was very
    annoying. The third guy disappeared too, I think he must have lost his
    connection. In this last case, I noticed that the player had stopped
    talking to anyone, and that he didn't answer my e-mail. When the deadline
    passed, I got a replacement right away, not waiting for the Grace to
    expire. This is a little unorthodox, and if Benni shows up again and
    complains I'll feel bad about it, but I really really didn't want to wait
    another five days. I felt my newbies (and the remainder are quite
    responsible, I think) were getting close to being turned off to the whole
    Judge scene. Understandably.
    
    
    
    > Lates are common, but as someone (Andy?) pointed out,

    Yeah, that's a good idea (right, it was Andy "No T In Me" Schwarz). I'm
    tempted to say, "Or players could just manage to take a tiny bit of
    responsibility for themselves," but we do have to deal with the reality,
    and the Reminder idea sounds highly implementable.

    I think the reliability factor for most of us is pretty lousy.  My current
    ISP will have problems for a couple of hours at a time every few weeks.  But
    it is a dream compared to my first ISP which regularly crashed for hours or
    even days at a time.  And even IT was pretty good compared to the nightmare
    that was (still is?) AOL.  I'm just glad I never went down that road.
    
    This from Nick:
    >True, but generally I was following Eric, and Danny Loeb, who appears to
    >have escaped the blame for this so far.
    
    Blame?  I like NoNMR.  I only played in one NMR game and fount that there's
    really not much point to putting a lot of effort into a game if a
    disappearing power can decide the outcome.  Sometimes you get into a game
    that turns into a nightmare of delays and abandonments (I've been involved
    in two of those - in one I took over as the sixth(!) Austria), but those
    games are unusual.  Lates are common, but as someone (Andy?) pointed out,
    
    
    too many players seem to regard the deadline as a "reminder".  I liked the
    idea of sending out reminder notices before the deadline.  I'm sure it is
    right there in the queue behind my idea to optionally sort each country's
    moves (Successful Moves, Bounced Moves, Successful Supports, etc) and is
    scheduled to be implemented by the Twelfth of Never.  No complaints though.
    Anyone is welcome to change the code, so I could do it myself.  But I tried
    learning C and thought that in many ways, it was the most ridiculous excuse
    for a language I'd ever seen.

    Cal,
    
    We have a lot of interesting options coming up.
    
    First, I'm thrilled we vaped those two French units.  Of course, now
    Edi has a place to retreat to, but I think VEN-ROM, TRI-VEN, ADR and
    APU S TRI-VEN will still work admirably.
    
    Second, we can take MAR, SPA or MID.  I'd love to bust into the MID,
    but I'll follow your lead on whatever you want to do.
    
    Third and finally, I'm sure the "anti-Hohn" talk will be rearing its
    ugly head again this turn, but after having looked at the board, even
    if I stabbed you and everything worked perfectly, I'd go up to 16.
    Then I'd promptly lose STP (which is inevitable within a year anyway)
    while stagnating in the center and having my hands full of a new FI
    alliance in the south.
    
    Obviously, I don't want that.
    
    I'm sticking with you, that's for certain.  The question I _do_ have
    is what do we want to do, though?  Should we press on against France,
    blow past the stalemate line and completely remove his chances of
    victory at the expense of making me a potentially greater risk
    (although you will be getting the major lion's share of any future
    conquests, that is for certain)?  Should we sit tight and wait
    (although I will lose ground in the north)?  Should we be shooting for
    a four-way (which is fine) or a three-way (which is preferable)?
    
    Thoughts?

    John: Just want to reassure you that, despite the two units of yours
    that got popped, I will keep my word to you and not try to take any of

    Yup, lots of them. This is my dilemma.  If I help you break thru the
    Med,
    you WILL stab me to go for the win.  I would do it in in your place
    and I would expect no less of you... grin.
    
    However, I promised France that I would be trying to set up a stalemate
    line in the Med and would go no further lest you become as big a risk as
    everyone is scared of.  Now, I'd break that promise if it would do ME
    any
    good, but you'd benefit too much for comfort.
    
    That leaves the question of what next?  Well, given that there will be

    solo win this game, the best we can do is to reduce the size of the draw
    as much as possible.  For obvious reasons, to me that means a three-way.
    
    I haven't talked to France recently, so I have no idea if he will be
    amenable to excluding his faithful lackeys, Jamie & Pitt.  It would be
    worth asking him though and I'll try that first.  It occurs to me that
    blackmail may be an option.  He either votes for the draw, or I throw
    the
    game to you...
    
    For the record, I will NOT do that, but hopefully John won't know that.
    
    Thoughts?

    I'm setting the deadline to Thursday until I hear something to
    the contrary.... just to get people to think about it.

    I'm just noticing that the retreat doesn't seem to have been processed
    correctly.  I think I've just changed the deadline for the RETREAT.
    Just to test, I'm changing the deadline back to tonight.
    
    If it gets "weird", I'll fix it tomorrow.  But I won't get to it first
    thing.  If a Judge whiz can tell me what happened, I'd appreciate it.

    The "delay" feature is also to protect those who put their orders in and
    then, on receiving the acknowledgement, realize that they mis-ordered
    something.  They have some time to fix the problem, before the judge hauls
    off and processes the phase.

    The judge has a 'delay' feature, which makes it wait a certain amount
    of time before processing orders.  This is included to prevent runaway
    games when a bug hits the judge.  In the case of Ghodstoo, this
    parameter is set to a half-hour, which means that the judge waits 30
    minutes before processing moves.

    Of course, you know, this means WAR! :)
