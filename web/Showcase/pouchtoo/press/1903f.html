Yep!  He's being straight for once, eh?  :)

I told him the plan had some merit, but only in the fact that it would take
Hohn down faster.  I also told him that it was completely YOUR call as you
were the one risking a build if, for some reason, you couldn't retreat (or
move) to Spain.  I still like the original set of moves I sent you the other
day (I don't think you've replied to that yet??), but if you see any merit
in his plan, we can talk about it.  Just as an opinion, I'd be pretty wary
of what he is suggesting, but I want to hear your comments.

In retrospect, I think maybe Boh would have been better. But this should be
ok. I have a plan now, I think.

If you knock me out of Gal, I can retreat to Boh. This looks reasonable,
since I'm then threatening you; and I'll next to Munich, and you'll have an
excellent excuse to go to Tyrolia.

I'll come up with specific moves later, but I think I'll probably defend
Rum heavily, not bothering to use my F Bla to support Arm-Ank, since either
Italy does vacate and I don't need support, or he supports Turkey and my
support doesn't help. So I won't defend Gal, and you 'guess right' and
eject me therefrom.

Does that sound like a good basic plan?

Your plan sounds better to me than Italy's. But I was thinking along
these lines:

a bur - gas
a mar s a bur - gas
a mun s a bel - bur (?)
f den - swe
a kie - ber

You could hit Brest, or take a shot at the guessing game for
Spain/Portugal. My attack on Gascony would ensure that Italy's move to
Marseilles fails. It would also cut support for Brest, so if you want to
cut Picardy, you have a somewhat better chance at Brest.

You know, if I order mar-gas and bur-par, you can take Brest for sure
with eng s mid - bre.

If we can dissuade Italy from accepting France's support into
Marseilles, we'd pick up two centers. Possibly, if Italy does dislodge
me, I could take Spain, although I think it's likely Hohn will cover
with Portugal.

I do hope I can pick up a center this turn. Things are getting stormy to
the east. The Tsar says he wants to patch things up with Austria, too.

Anyway, let's talk through all the possibilities. Things are not as
obvious this turn.

Yes, I had considered this, specifically that you would have to retreat
to Boh, whereas if I went to Boh, then you would retreat to Sil.  What
decided me on the move to Sil was your comment about Germany going to Tyr.
That would really be a problem, and I don't want him to even consider it.

This was exactly my thinking.  You face 3 units touching Rum, which means
you need to use the two units that can't be attacked to support it (Bla
and Ukr).  What I'm trying to decide is where I should attack from.  If
I come in from Sil, then my defense is good, but I lose the position of
Sil.  If I come in from Vie or Bud, then when you retreat to Boh I have
the problem of how to "defend" tri and vie, although, if we are ready
to come out into the open versus Germany at that time, maybe we no
longer need to keep up the pretense?

Right, although I could order Gal-Bud. That would be plausible; you
probably wouldn't attack Rum from Bud. Anyway, as a matter of fact you
'have decided' just to take Galicia back.

That's what I was thinking, I guess. That you could stay in Sil, then when
I retreat to Boh it looks like you have to defend, but then in S04 we
unveil the True Plan so the pretense is no longer necessary.

I don't know how England will feel about this, since he may well still have
no French centers... but I expect I'll be feeling impatient by then. :-)

I think I've used up about 5 games worth of my quota of restraint so far,
my knife arm is getting itch (<:.

The question we'll have to decide is, do we take Italy out of Turkey at
the same time?  We can't necessarily expect any builds from Germany in
the first year of the attack, and it would be awfully nice to see you
put a fleet in Stp, even if it is in the south coast.

Hm, yes, true.

Well, I personally would like to do it that way, stab all at once. But I
would also like to see England stay on our side, and so I think maybe it
depends on whether England has gotten his French center yet. Of course,
even if he doesn't get it this coming season, it's quite possible that he
would be assured of getting one next season, since he'd presumably get some
German help in S04.

It might also depend on just how easy it's going to be to take Italy out of
Turkey. If he leaves both units there, we can't do it. Hm, unless you added
your F Gre to the picture, then we could do it easily. Yeah, that would
work nicely. I'd support you into Con, you'd also order Gre-Aeg, and the F
Con would be smushed. Then you'd support me into Smy, or better I'd support
you into Smy and do Bla-Con, and you'd go Aeg-Ion. It would be better,
though, if Italy left only the army. Then you could go straight for Ion and
your attack would be considerably better. So to some extent it does depend
on how Italy is positioned.

But you're right, I've been trying to be very careful not to grow too fast,
but geez, I'm RUSSIA, not goddam Italy, I really ought to have more than
seven centers by the end of 1904!

I've been doing what I can to convince Italy that he and France should make
an all out effort to regain Mar, even at the cost of losing a center to
England instead.  That would be the optimal solution as far as I can see,
Germany losing Mar back to France, but England taking Bre or Por or Spa.

Yes, I was figureing that we would need to involve my fleet.  Actually, I
think we are better off if his fleet stays there.  If he tries to move it
out, then it will be in Aegean if I let it go there.  That puts it in a
position to attack 3 of our centers or support Smy.  On the other hand,
if I move Gre - Aeg, then the fleet is destroyed.  This means that we
can easily take out the army with only two units in the fall, and my fleet,
whether from Gre or Aeg, can move to Ion.  Since we should also be able to
take Ven, that would reduce Italy by 3 centers.  Even if England has not
gotten a lot of French centers, we may be able to convince him to grab a
German one just to keep from being left behind.

That's the spirit! (<:  Actually, I think your policy of restraint has
probably been a good one, but now that France is starting to crumble it

Yes, well, good luck with that, but my understanding is that France
strongly prefers to lose centers to Germany instead of England. I'm not
sure why. It might just be that he had to pick one of his enemies and say,
"If you keep attacking I'll make sure the other guy gets most of the goods."

Good point about that Italian fleet. Better to squish it than have it
hanging around in Aeg.

So if Manus asks me, I'll say that it's probably just as well that he keep
the fleet there, knowing how greedy you are.

Well, my reasoning is that he's already lost a center to Germany, but England
doesn't have one yet.  If he retakes Mar, there is a chance to out guess
England.  If he lets Mar go, then he's guaranteed to be down at least one.
Don't know how successfull it's being, but it sounds good (<:

I was looking over the board last night. I think we want to ensure that
France loses at least one unit. France's best defense against your
attack on Brest is por s bre - mid. This negates all the cuts we can
throw at him, leaving a stand-off with your eng s mid-bre.

In light of that, I think we should go with my suggestion, mar s bur -
gas. If Italy accepts France's support into Marseilles, my move cuts
French support while Italy's cuts mine, and I own Marseilles. Of course,
if Gascony does anything else, I still own the center. The only way I
lose it is if Italy supports gas-mar.

I was thinking you might attack Picardy with eng s bel-pic, perhaps
destroying France's fleet. Then allow France to dislodge F Mid. If you
order f mid - por, either you have a shot at retreating to an open
center or taking Portugal if he covers Spain with the fleet. Also, this
would guard against Italy supporting gas-mar, and France ordering
por-spa to ensure I don't retreat there. You would move into Portugal,
so he still loses a center.

You would also have to hold F Iri and F NAO rather than order a
supported move to Mid, or else you'd have a beleaguered unit and no
dislodgement.

If everything went our way, we could end up with Marseilles and either
Spain or Portugal. If not, we get at least one.

Your thoughts?

Sorry if I'm a bit abrupt here, but it's my day to run on almost zero
sleep...

I like your plan and will go along with everything you say.  I'll also drop
Italy a line and ask him to hold off on attacking Marseilles.  We'll see how
he reacts to that - it should be interesting.

I have to keep this short as this is my day to go on very little sleep.

I've run over the tactics with Germany re your moving to Marseilles and we
decided we'd like you to hold off for this turn.  I believe John recognizes
that Marseilles is yours in the long run, but we both want to make sure Hohn
goes down a centre this year.  Perhaps, if you think Hohn is going to
support you to Mars, you could order a support for HIM and claim a mixup?
Hopefully, it may not matter what you claim as he won't be strong enough to
do anything about it.

Again, please don't move to Marseilles THIS turn. Once Hohn loses the
centre, we'll make sure we come to a fair divvying up of his centres.

Kordially,

Hi.

I don't expect to have much time tomorrow (Thursday), so I'll propose some
moves now.

I was seriously thinking about convoying my A Arm - Rum, sending Rum-Ukr,
Ukr-War, and letting Gal retreat to Boh. Because if Italy does what he
says, I don't actually need to move my army into Ank, since I currently own
it!

But on second thought, it wouldn't be so good if I had no army in Turkey.
And putting an army in Ukr is only a small advantage. So I won't do that.

I'll support myself to hold in Rum and order Gal-Bud; you support Bud and
have A Bud support Vie (or Sil? -- I leave that to you, but please do not
order Sil-War!) to Gal.

You can order Bul-Rum if you like. I think you probably shouldn't order
Gre-Aeg, though. That would spook Italy, he'd build F Nap and order it to
Ionian.

Don't get too bored, now. I have a feeling we'll get to do something more
fun next year.

Tsar J
p.s. I don't think I've heard a word from anyone since Monday, and nothing
at all from Germany since the movement phase was processed.

King Kal,

It would be cool if you just took Holland, to even things up between you
and Germany. But I guess you're not going to do that, huh? :-)

I'm expecting that there will be some sort of attack on Germany in 1904. So
I think this is the time for me to move my army to Stp. If you do manage to
get a build (I understand Austria is trying to arrange some funny business
between Italy and France that might increase your chances, and of course
Mar S MAO-Spa might conceivably work), then you'd have an excellent excuse
for building on your east coast and moving into Nth. And then we could take
Denmark in F1904, or I could just do Swe-Bal, Fin-Swe and stick a couple of
armies into Germany.

In some ways it would be better to wait, but it appears that we are about
to see a new German unit, and I really don't want to wait until he gets yet
another one!

Unfortunately, the funny business Manus is trying to arrange is more
likely to get HIM a build than anyone else.  I'd frankly rather have
Germany get the build than Italy for one simple reason:  I can REACH
Germany to take it off him.  Once Manus has it, it won't be easy for you
or I to get it off him.  We'll have to depend on Austria to hit him.

Anyway, I THINK I have a shot at a centre this turn, but we'll see
how it develops.  That's all I'll really need to be able to start thinking
about the German campaign (although I'll probably wait for a second
build).

Didn't get enough before going back to work, but what they?  I'm home now
and I don't have to go back to work until tomorrow morning.  Delicious!

Italy said he has no problem with backing off on Marseilles, although he did
coyly inquiry as to what my tactics WOULD be.  I told him the truth, but in
a very ambiguous manner which shouldn't benefit him or Hohn should they
choose to try and mess us up.

My orders are in.

Well, either that or Mos-Stp.

Leave that to me, ok? I'm gently testing the water with England. If I go to
Stp and England gets a build, it works out very nicely, because he'd have
an excellent excuse to build on his east coast and move the new fleet to
Nth. If he can do that and also maintain surprise against Germany, he'll
almost certainly stab, since he'll have Hol or Den to snatch.
I asked him if he might like to use that A Bel to grab Holland right now.
His only reluctance seemed to be that Hohn Cho might take Belgium.

Manus,

I think he's BS'ing you about hitting GAS, to tell the truth.  In any
event, and in light of their claims (whether true or false), I think
we should do the sure thing, and have GAS-MAR, PIE S GAS-MAR, and
PAR-BUR.  That will guarantee a retake of MAR, and might well destroy
the German army there.  As for your fleets, what do you think?  GOL
and WES, or WES and NAF?  We might be able to get you into the MID if
we go WES and NAF, and wouldn't _that_ be a fun little ride. ;-)  Or
we can go the other way, too.  I leave it up to you.

Thoughts?

I'm all ready to go after Germany, and I think it would be a good time to

your end. Can you get a center from France this coming year and also maybe
stab for Holland or something? If so, we ought to just go for it. I mean,
if you can get yourself up to speed, we could take this right into a REA

Damn well if I may say so!  Interesting results in France. I didn't
really expect him to manage to hang onto all his centers, but with
none open for the build, he's still down a unit.

Well, actually, while I pushed for the attack on Mar to keep Germany from
gaining a center and I'm glad it worked, I'm not thrilled by the disband.
That means he's going to be building an army in Kiel, which gives him armies
in Kiel, Munich and Berlin.  I'd rather have had one in Burgundy.

I think you have to.  Going to Boh would blatantly signal an AR as it would
leave War open.  I'm really hoping that we've still got Germany believing
there's no threat to him and that he'll send one of those armies west.  As
it is, we can put armies in Tyr, Boh, Sil and Pru in the spring.  Stp can
go to Fin as well.  It would be really nice to have your fleet in Bal, but
if you do that, then he gets into Swe.

In the south, we should be able to destroy the Italian fleet in the spring,
making Smyrna easy pickings in the fall and giving us both a guaranteed
build.

There is no way for France to prevent England taking Brest, so I'm hoping
he'll have no problems with making a move now as well.  If we're lucky,
we might be able to persuade him to take out Hol as well.  If successful,
that could lead to Germany going down 2, Italy going down 2 or 3 and France
going down at least 1, not a bad year's work!

Well, it's not quite hindsight. I did suggest you order mid - por in my
analysis of the moves. I should have written out all the moves as if
they were going to the judge.

Really, though, no harm done. He lost his fleet and has no place to
build, so he's down one anyway. The bad news is he now has an ally (as
we anticipated).

What season are we in? I think it's Winter, so we'll have to figure out
what to do after retreats and builds.

I wrote Russia about mos-stp. He was coy, but essentially said he didn't
know what else to do.  With a little talk, and given his situation in
the south, he'll probably back off.

No mysteries as to what happened. You supported France's attack on

He's still one down due to losing his fleet in Picardy and having no

Make of it what you will and let me know, I suppose.  I am as distressed

I am assuming that we'll just go ahead with the plan this year. So in the
Spring we'll surround Germany and capture Constantinople, destroying the
Italian fleet; and in the Fall we'll open fire against German centers and
capture Smyrna, releasing my fleet into the Mediterranean in the process.

If Germany smells it coming, we might manage only to get three armies
around him instead of four, but really that doesn't seem like it will be a
serious problem. Similarly, when I've got A Fin, F Swe, Germany might guess
right and stop my Scand units from progressing against him (e.g., if I go
Swe-Bal, Fin-Swe, and Germany orders Den-Bal), but this only buys him time.
It's fun to overwhelm the stabee quickly, but I do think time is on our
side: if it takes longer, we'll be that much surer of having England as an
ally.

That's the only hitch, by the way. Since England didn't get a center, he
may attempt to argue us out of our German attack. But as you say, he'll get
Bre and he ought to be able to stab for Holland (putting a fleet in Nth on
pretext of fear of my Scandinavian presence). I will brush off any but the
most strident objections that Kal might raise, and let you know if he does
get strident about it.

On Germany:

>Well, actually, while I pushed for the attack on Mar to keep Germany from

Yeah, but this is definitely better than his having six centers. This way
he's facing some pressure to send another army to France. Or how are they
ever going to get rid of France? I can't see what they're plan could be
unless they get another German army in there. Surely they won't be counting
on Italian help.

>  It would be really nice to have your fleet in Bal, but
>if you do that, then he gets into Swe.

Yes, I can't do that. I considered it. I could always kick him out (I'm
sure he wouldn't order Kie-Den as well), but the problem is that he'd have
Nwy open for retreat. So England would have to use a fleet to cover Nwy,
and couldn't stab into Holland.

>In the south, we should be able to destroy the Italian fleet in the spring,
>making Smyrna easy pickings in the fall and giving us both a guaranteed
>build.

Right. There are two ways to do it, by the way. We could just
double-support my F Bla into Hol, and then my A Ank S F Con-Smy in the
Fall, with your Bul-Con unopposed; or we could bring your army in first. I
bet there is a tactical advantage to one of these, but I can't quite see
what it would be.

>There is no way for France to prevent England taking Brest, so I'm hoping
>he'll have no problems with making a move now as well.  If we're lucky,
>we might be able to persuade him to take out Hol as well.

Yeah. If he sees us outright attacking Germany, I feel fairly confident
that he will stab for Holland. If Germany is going to leave France, or if
Germany's usefulness to England expires, King Kal is going to want to be
sure to get his share of the spoils, and he must be feeling desperate for
growth about now.


>If successful,
>that could lead to Germany going down 2, Italy going down 2 or 3 and France
>going down at least 1, not a bad year's work!

Hmmmm.
I guess that's right!

And I think you and I would each be at eight centers, or one of us might
have nine; and England would have seven. And the other three powers would
have 3 or 4 centers. So that's close to ideal, I think, as the beginning of
an endgame.

No, I don't want war with you. France is too strong and I remain
committed to occupying Paris. With your help, I will. With your
opposition, I will no doubt find myself beaten back to my homeland.

What can we work out to make this happen? With some good planning, we
can ensure that we make off with most of the French spoils.

Before we turn our attention there, though, let's talk about our rear-ends.
As everyone can see, I have a pretty good relationship with Dave, and Jamie
(who I must admit has played me like a fiddle more than once already -- you
have seen much evidence of this yourself, as a matter of fact) talked me into
killing Steve rather than get bogged down in a war with him to which (at least
he argued, and I agreed) he could devote more forces, what with me on the
sail to Iberia and all.

Which leads me to wonder, though, what is to become of Dave and Jamie while
we busy ourselves digging snails?  Have you heard anything.  To be quite
frank, I still haven't looked at the moves (I guess I should).  Are they
attacking each other or not?  Jamie's only other choice (unless he wants
my two centers in Turkey, but I kind of doubt he'd go that route, with
Dave and me as close as I hope we are) is to attack Cal or you.  Austria's
is to attack you, I suppose.  Any indications of how well defended we
are?  I am of course constantly worried about Venice and Trieste, but so
far Dave has proven to be friendly both in manner and action.  Knock on wood.

Good news!  My silver tongue has succeeded in getting me back into
Germany's good graces (honest).  We should have some good inside info
this coming year.

I will let John make the first proposal, but I imagine his goals now
are to put him in Paris and me in Marseilles.  If it works with your
plans, it might prove very beneficial for me to follow along on the
German plan for Italian units in the Spring, which would perhaps put
me in Marseilles this coming turn.  Hopefully we can get me out of
there in the Fall to keep the center cyan, but even if we want to
leave me there due to tactical impossibilities or simply to continue
and solidify the charade, and new unit built would be devoted to our
common cause.

So far I don't see any tactical difference either.  Maybe it's best to move
your fleet to Con then Smy.  The only reason for this is if I get into
Aegean in the spring, and am then bounced when trying for Ion in the fall.
If you are in Con, your fleet would be bottled, whereas if you are in Smy,
you can go to Eas and then we have two on Ion.

This does bring up the issue of other units as well.  What do you plan on
doing with Rum?  Are we going to leave the two armies in Turkey doing a
perpetual bounce in Smy?  I'd like to see the border have fewer units.
Rum is rather a gateway into my heartland, so it would be nice to see it
empty, and of course I'm looking to be moving my own armies north.

Well, one of the questions we may well face is whether we should go for
Ven or Mun in the fall.  Germany is going to be getting hit from all sides,
so I have some preference for taking as much as possible from Italy in the
first year of the attack.  He's going to have nothing else to do but come
back at me!

True.
Also, if we *are* going to empty Turkey, it makes more sense to have your
army in Con than in Smy.

You know what's going to happen, I noticed this just now: at the end of the
coming year, Italy will retreat A Smy-Arm, so I will have to build A Sev.
Then Italy will very likely debuild that army in the winter, so my new A
Sev will be of no use there and I'll have to move it north. Oh well, a
small matter. But it will delay my building another northern fleet, which I
want to do asap before England has a chance to demand that I not do it. I
guess I might also get a build from Germany. Unlikely. Hm. Well, we'll see.

You're going to move them north *and west*.

Yeah, I don't have a clear picture of the situation around our border as we
begin to 'branch out'. I agree that A Rum is too close to your heartland,
though. I'll move it, no problem with that. I'm going to have a problem
finding spaces for my armies! Since there will be a bottleneck heading into
Germany. I figure your armies will be leading the way in there, mine will
be crowding in behind. Maybe if I can build another fleet I can convoy
armies from Lvn to Kiel or something. That part will be fun, I love to
convoy. :-)


>Well, one of the questions we may well face is whether we should go for
>Ven or Mun in the fall.

Can't we go for both of them?

I see, you mean if Italy still has the A Pie, then you'd either use A Tri +
A Tyo against Venice, or you'd use A Tyo against Germany.
I agree, you should use the A Tyo against Italy if necessary, preferably
Tyo S Tri-Ven. As you say, we'll have Germany contained anyway. Also, you
really do want to have Tri empty to build a fleet, I think, so it's
important to be able to force the army into Venice.

On your (our, but mostly your) Italian attack generally:

The good part is that Italy will be way, way out of position. The bad part
is that you'll have to bash into Ionian, and it will take time. Once we get
my fleet, your existing fleet, and one new fleet into action, we ought to
be able to get you into Ion, since you'll be threatening Rome and pushing
armies into Apu and that sort of thing. I don't think Italy will be able to
use all of his fleets to protect Ionian. The only really serious problem I
can see is if England or France sends a fleet to help Italy. So again, we
do need England on our side, preventing France from getting involved and
staying out of the Med himself. And, of course, I really don't want him
helping Germany. Goes without saying.

Another small concern is this: if Italy starts cooperating with France or
Germany, it would be bad if he gives support to one of them in the Spring
and expects to be supported in the Fall, because that would mean his fleets
would not be moving west in the Fall. Or not as much.

I haven't heard a word from Cal, by the way.

If you've looked at the moves by now, you know that Austria and Russia
hit each other hard. Russia's move to StP might have to be reversed if
he wants to hang onto Warsaw.

I am pretty well armed. I'll have units in all my home centers and
nothing really to fear.

You, by aiding France, did ensure you could take Marseilles for
yourself. I hope this was your limited aim. Quite honestly, your support
for France's recapture guaranteed that France would retake Marseilles,
so I am a little skeptical of your shock that such a thing happened. But
I could see an Italian interest in preventing Germany from holding
Marseilles, even while Italy remains set on owning France's centers. So
I think I can give the benefit of the doubt.

I can do any number of things, depending on what England wants to do.
Quite apart from what we/I do, if you simply knock off Marseilles in the
Spring, we should be well on our way to a succesful dismantling of
Hohn's empire. Can I count on you for that?

Okay, I was right.  Germany wants me to attack and take Marseilles this
turn.  Would that be okay with you?  As I say, we should try to arrange

England and Germany talking to and happy with me.  Also, it allows you
to (hopefully) surprise them by committing all your forces against them

your home centers this Spring.

Indeed so.  This is good news for the both of us!  It is nice to have

Excellent!

My aim was only to stay in France's good graces and yet snooker him
so that you kept Marseilles.  I left him thinking he'd get Pie-Mar
and he was supposed to order Gas S Pie-Mar.  I got double-crossed
by him because my own double-cross was (I strongly suspect) tipped
to him by one of those red or white guys we just got done talking
about.

But now that what has happened has happened, and looking at the board,
I see that you are right.  It will be easier to stick me in Marseilles
now and then work on getting you into Paris.  So yes, Marseilles will
be my plan.  I'm still debating my build -- either A Ven to follow A Pie
in to France or F Nap to follow F Wes into Iberia.  Leaning towards
A Ven, because the fleets will stack up at Gibraltar.

Speaking of Gibraltar... You and Cal.  In it for the long term together?
If so, how long is long?  :-)  I've no real reason to ask, but if you have
any reason to answer, we might be able to think of a reason to talk.

It appears that I am being pulled toward an alliance with AI, if you are
open to that. Italy has positioned himself to make off with most of the
French centers. If I am to make any permanent gains, I'll have to take
his part when his inevitable clash with England comes.

Meanwhile, you are apparently locked into a war with Russia. I can play
a useful role for you, as long as I don't have Italy coming at me from
the south. He's already talking about building A Venice. Given that you
and Italy are on good terms, such a build is doubly threatening to me -
but not if the three of us are allied.

Also, in the short term, helping you with Russia will take the pressure
off England, so he can stay focused on France.

This is as it should be, I think: the central powers take out the
corners. Your thoughts?

Italy continues to lie shamelessly about his actions. I pointed out to
him that his support for France guaranteed I would lose Marseilles, but
he maintains he was trying to snooker France so I would hold Marseilles.
I won't bother to pursue it. Every factual statement is simply met with
another absurdity. The bad news is that he's talking about building A
Venice. If he does intend to support France, he'll put the heat on
Munich.

I've written to Austria broaching the idea of helping him against
Russia. This, I hope, will force Russia to back off Norway.

As for France, a first glance suggests that we can and should crush A
Paris in the spring (gas-par, pic s gas-par, mun-bur). Hohn would be
playing two short and still have little prospect for building. If Hohn
cuts Picardy, then you could destroy F Brest with eng s mid-bre. In my
humble opinion, and bearing in mind how unsubtle my tactics are, nat s
iri - mid is called for. IMO, Norway will have to be saved by your
diplomacy with Russia and pressure from Austria, possibly with my help.

Italy promises he's going to take Marseilles. I'll believe it when I see
it, but it really does not matter for what we do. You will have to meet
his fleets regardless.

A Venice would make me rather uncomfortable. But beyond that, I was
thinking about the larger picture today. It seems to me that the most
productive arrangement would be for us to foster AGI alliance. I can
begin to help Austria against Russia as soon as he asks for it. On our
front, we can continue the destruction of France. But we know that
sooner or later you will have to confront England's fleets. At a crucial
moment, I can turn the tide in our favor, for example, by ejecting
England from Brest or Belgium when he least expects it, perhaps forcing
a crippling disband.

In other words, I'll be playing the kind of game with England that you
have been with France. At the right time, we show our swords.

In a year or two, our respective roles would be clear. AG land forces
would roll back the Czar. I would build armies and leave the seas
entirely to you. Your fleets would sweep west, ultimately attacking
England's homeland. France, if he survives, would a puppet until such
time as it is convenient to eliminate him, and likewise for the others.
Then we can discuss a 3-way or continue to fight it out, but AGI would
all be virtually guaranteed of being among the final three, if not part
of a draw.

In light of this, a fleet might be more useful to you in the long run
than an army. I would certainly take it as a friendly gesture toward
executing such a long-range vision.

I am interested in your views of the larger scenario I have outlined.

I can probably get a centre from France and I'm certainly not averse to
grabbing Holland if I can work it out tactically.  However, my BIG problem
is whether or not Manus is going to force me into a Med war.  His actions
certainly indicate that this is his intention (at Hohn's urging no doubt)
and it would make big problems for me if I plan to have Germany for an
enemy.

Well, Germany is totally convinced that Hohn has you for an ally and I'm not

I obviously want to hear your comments as I'd like to keep going the way we

An epiphany!  The proverbial lightbulb going off.  It's serendipity at its
finest.  We kill two birds with one stone, you get the idea...
Russia: A Rum -> Sev

That empties out Rum, protects Sev, and really doesn't lose anything on
the March north as the armies are going to get bottlenecked anyway and
you've already got one in Ukr which can go to War.  So, we have the following
for next year:

Rum - Sev, Bla - Con, Ank s Bla - Con, Bul s Bla - Con, Gre - Aeg
Sev - Arm, Con - Smy, Bul - Con, Aeg/Gre - Ion, Ank s Con - Smy, Sev H/Sev - Arm

I think the armies coming from the north and a fleet in Aegean will make
progress reasonably speedy.  That's another plus for my taking Venice, two
builds lets me funnel another army at Italy and keep the pressure on Germany.
We'll have three fleets on the Ionian by the next fall, and I don't see anyway
he will be able to keep us out.

Sorry to take so long in writing, but I've been out of town.

Well, THAT turn certainly sucked for me.  I've got a likely I/F against me
and a Russia that has the choice of turning hostile against me... sigh.
Well, no one said these games were easy.

Russia is saying that he wants me to stab Germany this year by taking
Holland.  Now obviously, in the face of what the board LOOKS like, that
would be a rather foolish move on my part.  If I do that, I could be
antagonizing my only ally  and should you and Russia decide to join F/I in
heading northwest, I'd be very quickly dried and heated bread.

However, Russia assures me that you have every intention of turning against
Italy at the first possible chance.  Methinx that this would be a very
strange move for you given that Russia ALSO says that you and he are about
to hit Germany.  I'd appreciate any light you could shed on these unusual
claims by the Great Bear.

Suffice it to say that I would dearly LOVE it should you actually decide to
turn against your western neighbour.  I strongly doubt that there is any
chance of Germany and Russia working together so the risk to you of this
course of action would be minimal.  Also, it would buy me the time necessary
to make gains France and have the strength to move on Germany and Russia in
turn.

What do you think?  Any chance of me seeing some anti-Italian moves from you
this turn?

Germany and I are on very good terms at present, and I'm still

and hopefully by that you will know for sure where my loyalties

As I say, wish I could spend more time making sure you know that

Not the best, it's true.

> You stand to lose both Paris and Brest this turn.

I don't think so.

They have A GAS, A PIC, F ENG, F MID.  BRE is lost for sure, I agree.
PAR I can hold, for at least the spring.

I'm thinking the following:

PAR S MAR-GAS
MAR-GAS
BRE-PIC
SPA-POR (to block the evil English from trying to sneak in...I'd like
to save POR for you, if possible)

PIE-MAR
GOL S PIE-MAR
WES-MID

This way, they are definitely denied POR, and SPA.  (Any supported
attack on SPA is cut, MID by WES, and GAS by MAR.)  You are guaranteed
MAR, and hopefully I'll even be able to have my army survive with
supported MAR-GAS.  They will definitely be denied PAR, since PIC and
GAS will both be cut.  In fall, I will lose PAR, in all likelihood
(unless maybe I make it to GAS and they take BRE with a fleet), but
you will be in MAR, and will have three units bordering SPA.  With
luck, I will also make it into POR so I can live on for a few more
seasons to offer you support into MID forever.

That way, you'll have a solid line in SPA/MAR, you'll have my eternal
support in POR (hopefully), and the English/German dogs will have to
settle for one measly supply center each from my country, all while
facing a solid line arrayed against them...and hopefully Jamie will
swoop on them, too!  A fine revenge for me, and it would please me
greatly.  Basically, as soon as they started attacking me, I knew I
was probably history, but I wanted to make it as painful for them as
possible.  And I thank you for helping me do so (and I'm happy this is
also helping your position, too!).

What do you think?

I'm not concerned about going out.  I'm perfectly content to be
eliminated so long as my vengeance is carried out.  And if I can live
on for a while in POR, so much the better.

Manus,

Small wrinkle in my plan.  I just realized that although we block a
supported attack on SPA, a one strength attack will succeed if I make
it into POR, since we have nothing going there right now!

Tough call.  We can gamble on my making it into GAS, and have you go
into MAR unsupported, and send GOL-SPA.  Or we can...damn.  I don't
know.  I wish I'd gone to North Coast, instead of South (force of
habit).  Huh.  Well, let me think on it, and please let me know what

Heh heh, my last note from Italy says: "Germany and I are on very good terms
at
present, and I'm still a snail connoisseur" which is very funny in light of
your first sentence.  :)

An army in Venice would underscore the thing we've failed miserably in so
far: taking Hohn down quickly.  We absolutely HAVE to take a couple of
centres off him this year or we can kiss this game goodbye.

>I've written to Austria broaching the idea of helping him against

With Russia still claiming that he can get Austria to turn on Italy "at any
time" their relationship bodes worse for you than for Italy, but what the

If it's all the same to you (which it probably isn't...grin), I'd prefer to
go with the following:

A Pic-Par, s by Ger A Gas
F Mid-Bre, s by F Eng

My rationale for Army Picardy taking Paris is that Army Gascony will be much
more useful to us NEXT season right where it is as opposed to being in
Paris.  I'm pretty sure the odds of Paris being taken are equal either way
as I see the army in Marseilles going to Burgandy before it goes to Gascony.
Comments?

No doubt, Italy does think we are on good terms. He asked me bluntly
whether we were at war as a result of his support for France. I said no,
I still want his help. As long as I don't insist on challenging his
story that he blundered, he'll expect me to continue in that vein.

Re tactics, it is all the same to me, actually. I agree with you that
the only object is to take Hohn down. I don't care about who gets what
right now. Here's a possible worry. Say Italy does not hit Marseilles.
Hohn knows Paris is doomed, so he orders mar s par - bur. You move into
Paris, and his fleet could be in Picardy. Our strong offensive position
is turned around in a minute, especially if Italy is on his side. I
could see, for instance, a deal whereby Italy gets Spain, France moves
spa-por, and there we are with three hostile fleets on the mid.

Also don't overlook that Gascony is vulnerable.  My mun-bur would cut
off the retreat route, and if Hohn sees it the way you do, he could wipe
out the army.

I am thinking perhaps we should support mun-bur in the Spring. You can
still hit Brest.

Well, a lot depends on Italy's build, so I won't speculate too much. The
main point is that I don't care right now how we do it, let's do it.

I think the A-R war is real. This has been going on long enough that
even if they started out thinking it was a ploy, their nerves would be
shot by now. It appears to me they've simply played well and thus stood
each other off. In any case, I don't think I am that tempting a target.

True. Only, it does leave me just a *little* more open than I would like. I
mean, look, we both know that there's at least a chance that the other will
stab, and we're each banking on the alliance being more profitable in the
long run than a quick stab. And I think it's a good bet, on my side (and on
yours too!). But I don't want to make it *too* tempting.

Can I leave the army in Rumania for a while longer, please? I do think I
can have that army be the one to protect Sev, so I can indeed build F Stp
next winter.

(Remember, you told me to let you know if any of your suggestions made me
nervous, so I'm letting you know.)

>Rum - Sev, Bla - Con, Ank s Bla - Con, Bul s Bla - Con, Gre - Aeg

That's two seasons, and the first one ends with that comma separating
"Sev-Arm" and "Con-Smy", right?

That's fine, but if it's ok I'd prefer to leave the A Rum where it is for
the coming season.

Yeah. Well, especially if I can build F Stp. And esp. if England joins the
party! Speaking of which, I finally heard from him, and he was game except
that he seemed worried that Italy might be posing a real challenge. So I
strongly suggested he confer with you about that. :)

Manus has asked me for tactical suggestions. I don't want to be too obvious
about it, but I'll see what I can do.


Ok, so I think now the only interesting issue remaining is making sure King
Kal is on board. We might try three-way press if it seems like he isn't
getting easily convinced. If we do that, each of us can also send press to
e alone, expressing a little concern about the other and asking for a
British pledge to help keep the other in line. Of course, this is going to
be hard to explain in my case, since the prospects for England bailing me
out if you stab me are pretty far-fetched! But just the mention of it is
important, I think, so that King K. doesn't get the overwhelming feeling
that he is about to aid and abet a new, peculiar version of the
Juggernaut....

A Ven or another fleet?  From skimming your mail, it seems my major play

I thought I owed you at least the courtesy of mentioning that I am

I just read your mail a bit closer (the one proposing an AGI, with you
two taking on Russia, and I sail through the pillars to the Atlantic).
Pursuing such a thing would be fine with me.  I propose that you approach
Dave and see how he feels about it.  The whole A/R relationship is a
jumble to me, but with A/I so close (so far) I think we have a good chance
to add a "G" in there.  He will doubtless need help if he is to take
on Jamie, and all I can do from Turkey is just harass things a bit before
I'd be pushed off.

Your advice on builds is welcome, given any plan I have may indeed
involve fleet pressure in the Atlantic rather than armies down Iberia.
I just think building another fleet would anger and forewarn Kal.
So as I said, I'm still leaning toward building Venice, and it may end
up that way, but if you have any tactical advice, I'll listen.

Okay, I certainly do understand your reluctance as Rum is a bit vulnerable.
However, please do take a look at the flip side of the coin.  Under the
current plan, I will be vacating Bul.  Ser is already empty.  Gal will
be heading to Boh.  Bud may well go to Tri.  You can perhaps understand
how a Russian army in Rum makes me feel very vulnerable to you?  My idea
was that we both leave the area.  Obviously whether you move to Sev in the
Spring or the Fall does not affect the rest of our joint moves so as long
as you are willing to say you'll head to Sev in the fall there's no problem.
I'd be more comfortable if you left in the spring, but it's not a make or
break issue.

Actually, it was two season, split at the new line.  You don't have a sev to

Ah yes, and now we get into the interesting part of it.  I've had notes from
both G and E.  An interesting twist has arisen.  G seems to feel that he
is being forced into an AIG alliance.  He sees that there's nothing really
left for him in France due to Italy's positioning, and sees you making a
move in the north. He's now talking about helping me against you so as to
leave E free to deal with F.  Now quite what we had planned!  I don't see
any way that I can really turn down that offer without making him sure that
I'm going to attack him.  On the other hand, the only move your way he has
is Ber - Pru, and I can say I'll support him there while I can really
support War to Pru instead.  My other concern though is that he may well
build a fleet in Kiel if this is his plan!  Not great, but we can deal
with it.  He also mentions that Italy is talking about building A Ven,
something I'll need to check into.  Please make sure you advise against
this!

King Kal has also written.  He seems a it leery of you at the moment, now
that you have the option to attack him in the north.  He's mentioned that
you have told him that I'll attack Italy, but he's skeptical of this as
you have also told him that we'll attack Germany, and I don't think he
believes I'll do both.  On the face of it, he seems rather disinclined to
hit Holland, but as long as he's in position in the fall, I think we may
be able to convince him to do so, and he has every reason to consider moving
to North Sea.  What he really wants is assurances that I'll hit Italy this
year.

I don't think we really want to work the three way press just yet.  I'm
figuring more that I will assure him on the Italian front, and say that
I'm quite certain your aim is towards Germany, and that I will be with
you in that effort, although not in any major way since I'll concentrate
on Italy.  Based on that, his grabbing a center from Germany would be a
big help to all of us, breaking up Germany's lines and getting him a new
center.

I've yet to write those two back, your thoughts would be appreciated before
I do so.

<chuckle>

I think we're all set for the big push now.  Germany has mentioned the idea
of an AIG to me.  Obviously you and I want to keep up the idea of AI vs R
until after the rude surprise in the fall.

He did mention to me as well that you had told him you were planning on
building A Ven.  As you know, we've both taken pains to demilitarize our
border, and this really wouldn't be thrilling for me.  If you are planning
on attacking France this turn, I would think that the best attack would
be:  Pie - Mar, Gol s Pie - Mar, Wes - Spa/sc.  I think you are going to
want another fleet over there soon as you and England are going to be
vying for control of MAO.  Build F Nap, Nap - Tys, then support Wes
into Spa in the fall from Gol and Mar and move Tys to Wes will give you
a strong lock on the southern centers and a good springboard for the MAO.

Kaiser D

Fleet Naples is is, then.  I just didn't want to unduly alarm England,

King Kal:

Well, I broached the idea of building A Ven with both Germany and Austria
and neither liked it at all.  My feeling was that I probably have enough
fleets for the job of visiting "certain coasts" and that I would like an
army to follow Piedmont in to Marseilles.  However, given the responses
of the German-speaking people, I've decided to float another boat and wait
another year to enlist some Italian land forces.  I thought I should notify
you, though, for two reasons:
   (1) I didn't want you to be unduly alarmed by my navy.
   (2) If I do end up having an extra fleet that I'd rather be an army,
       maybe you could, in some future year, feign an action against me
       that would result in a fleet dislodgement so that I could build the
       army I'm foregoing now.

So this is just a heads-up.  As I said, I do believe (hope) that Germany is
not too displeased with me.  Surely not as displeased with me as I am with
myself.  Let me know your own feelings.

Manus,
You are worried that building a fleet will "anger and forewarn Kal." It
seems to me that building an army might anger and forewarn Germany.

But if that is your main concern, why not forego a build this year and
take it next year? You are in no danger. You'd barely be able to use the
extra unit (except against me).

Barring that, I can see a DEFENSIVE purpose for an army. So why not
build A Rome?  Then, if all goes well, you might even convoy it to the
western front.

Just tossing out ideas.

Great, John chooses *this* moment to start talking!

Well, there are two main difficulties arising out of this, I think: the A
Ven and the F Kie, those two 'potential' units. I would say that the A Ven
is more serious, though I am not at all happy about a F Kie either. I can't
see what to do about preventing B F Kie, except for the heavy-handed
approach (telling John that I am at a decision point and if he builds F Kie
I'll just have to attack him). It's tricky to do anything about the A Ven
too, because Manus must expect that I would naturally be *glad* to see that
unit (available in case I decided I wanted him to stab you because *I*
wanted to stab you, and also in case you stab me I'd presumably want him to
be able to help me out). I might tell Manus that England has 'offerred' to
come into the Mediterranean. I'll think about it.

Hm.
That's a problem, because I bet he will sail the F NAO to Nwg, rather than
the F Eng-Nth, if he doesn't think he is going to want to try for Holland.
On the other hand, that's probably what he wants to do anyway, because he
needs the F Eng to get Bre for sure, and he must be sweating to get a
center.

I have to agree with you about that, under the circumstances, yes.


>I've yet to write those two back, your thoughts would be appreciated before
>I do so.

Well, I think you've got the right approach. I can't think of anything
better, anyway.

As long as I'm sure I'll get the build for Smy, I can deal with whatever
Germany can throw, I think. (It could be ugly, though. If he gets a F Bal,
he could convoy an army into Livonia. Maybe we'll have him so tied up
defending his home centers that he won't have a free army to do that? I
hope so.) And by the same token, I think we can afford to wait for England
to see exactly what's happening, as long as we're pretty sure he will just
go ahead and dig in to Germany once he sees.

I'll send something to England and something to Italy, and maybe even
something to Germany, pretty soon. What the hell, I'll write to Hohn Cho
too, he must be feeling lonely.

At least things are getting more interesting, huh? :) The adjustment is due
this evening....

Good luck with your climbing child, too.

So, have you looked at the results yet?

What are you going to build? Tough choice. I wouldn't exactly complain
about an A Ven, but on the other hand England has offered (I ought to put

got to do *something* with all those fleets. Of course, I'd dearly love it

noncommital.

I feel pretty comfortable about my relations with Austria, in case you were

As was hinted in my announcement of the fleet build, I was aware that
you had laid AGI out for Austria.  In his note to me about that, he also
expressed concern for any Venice build.  So I thought I could signal not
only my understanding of his (and your) positions on my build but also
my support for the AGI proposal by making my build a fleet.

Your ideas of waive and A ROM are still swirling in my head, though.

That was my initial thought, but I felt that to keep myself out of hot
water I had to run it  past AG.  Both objected rather strongly.  Dave
made a case for F Nap, and that is my current order.  I was afraid another
fleet might alarm and forearm Kal, who seems to be the least happy player
with me as it is (Germany seems to have gotten over my failure to let
him keep Marseilles, but Kal hasn't written me his forgiveness yet).

Keep on him.  Maybe when he sees what you and Dave are about to do to Germany,
he'll want a piece of the pie before it's gone.  I obviously don't want him
trying to break through down here.

Ok.
I guess I like that build better, on the whole. An Army in Venice would be
a little *safer* for me, personally, but as long as I'm trusting Dave I may
as well go whole hog, and if you're all on the water he'll be more willing
to commit hard against Germany.

Ah. Right, how silly of you to be concerned! England would *never* want to
move into the Mediterranean, why that would be imperialistic!

Well, maybe it means he really is interested in invading Germany. As you
say, we'll try to make it an easier decision for him.

Yeah. *Eventually* Dave is going to run out of real estate, and either you
or I will be his expansion area. But for now it looks pretty tight.
Unless he's already striking a deal with Germany and England, this is my
one fear -- I'm sure he wouldn't tell you about it, either. This is the
problem with having 'convinced' the NW that Austria and Russia are at war.
It tempts them to try to form a GEA alliance. Oh well, as I said, I pretty
much have to either trust Dave or stab him, and I'm in no position to stab
him!

As mentioned, Ven is okay.  I think we can handle F Kie as well, although
it may slow us a bit.  Remember, his other army is in Gascony, so that
means no army to move to Kie if the fleet goes to Bal.  So, with the build
for Smy in your pocket, you can risk Swe to gain Ber:

  Swe - Bal, Fin - Swe, Pru - Ber, Boh - Mun, Sil s Pru - Ber.

This could lose out, but it would take a pretty convoluted guess on Germany's
part.  And if he tries something tricky (bal - Gob), then you get into Bal.

Gotta run,
more later

Too late, I already asked him. But I didn't lobby him about it. And he did

Hm, yeah, I was thinking about that issue too. It's complicated.
But anyway, fine, that's a deal.

He'd just have to do Mun-Sil. But it is a guess, indeed.

If we really do manage to get the four armies all around Mun and Ber, I
think John will have his hands too full to try anything tricky against me.
I *could* do that trick we discussed earlier, just ordering Swe-Bal in the
Spring, with Stp-Fin. Because Germany might do Kie-Bal, Den-Swe, and I'd
block him; or he might do Kie-Den, Den-Swe, and then I'd take Berlin in
exchange for Sweden and I think I could *count* on England's help then, if
Germany finished with two fleets in Scandinavia.

As I said, my concern will be to come out of next year with a build. If I
can do that, and we do get England to play along, then there's no further
problem. (And I must say, thinking ahead a little, it's not clear to me
that we will need England for very long -- the best bet might be for me to
stab him hard once you're rounding Sicily, keep him out of the Med. But we
can look into that later.)

I know a little bit about how John's mind works in pure tactical
situations, because I worked with him extensively in GHODSTOO (on his side,
I mean. Ok, technically speaking, I was his puppet, and I gave him tactical
advice! But we needn't go into that...).
On the other hand, he knows how *mine* works.
But our side will have your ideas to confuse him. :)

I certainly welcome the idea of a northern ally.  My biggest problem right
now is that Italy is poised to make lots of gains, while I have a hard
struggle to make any progress.  Pressure on the northern front would
definitely be a help.  I have talked to Italy about army Venice and as you
know, he has agreed not to build one, so that should take the pressure off
of both of us.

A move by you into Prussia would certainly help to put the pressure on
Russia.  I'm not sure that he could keep Warsaw in that scenario.

Well, while it good be that bad, I'm not really betting it will be.  I

Keep your eyes on the board and say "cheese". (<:

At this point I do plan to make a move on Italy.  I also expect Russia to
make a move towards Germany.  As far as my own participation in that event,
well, perhaps I've sounded more encouraging to him than I should have.  Shame
on me (<:.  I do have A Sil and will use it to help out in the effort.  My
main focus will be on doing as much damage to Italy as possible though.
It would be nice to see you take Hol as that would help crumble the German
line.  On the other hand, to do so would require you to move Cha - North,
which would be a big tip off since you can cover Nwy much easier with
NAO.  An option might be Nao - Nwg, Eng - Nth, Iri - Eng.  That would
leave MAO at risk though.

There are also some advantages to your NOT attacking Hol this year.  It
allows you to still appear to be allied with Germany.  Certainly he'll
have no qualms about you entering North Sea next year, and nothing he
could do about it if he did.  You can then make the stab for Hol in
the next year.

I'll leave you to game it out and pick the path you like the best, suffice
it to say that you can count on me to give Italy some major distractions.
I want you to get some builds and be in a good position.  Otherwise we'll
be facing a runaway Russia with annoyed people behind us!

move away from English friend's precious colonies, I might see some
advantage in joining the fray.

While we are waiting, think about this:

pic - par
eng s mid - bre
mid - bre
nat s iri - mid
iri - mid

gas s mun - bur

This would give you Brest for sure, all with your own forces. The French
fleet survives only if he orders par s bre - pic. In that case, though,
you retreat to Belgium, and I am in Burgundy and Gascony. Otherwise, the
fleet is wiped out. France and I might stand off, but if so, we still
have Paris surrounded, and I can probably take it in the Fall.

Russia approached me about attacking Silesia. So much for the AR ruse (I
hope). I told him I'd think about it if he'd back off in the north.

Harrrumph.

My hordes aren't doing any marauding in your territory, may I point out.

Tsar J,

It was a joke, and I was referring to all the hordes to the East, red
and white.

Contritely,

The Kaiser
