Well, he continues to surprise us!  I'd say that this does put a little
bit of a new perspective on things.  He can actually keep you out of Sweden
and put a double attack on Norway, but that would take 4 units (Nth, Ska,
Den, Bal).  If he did that, then he could possibly attack Hol with Kie
supported by Ruh and Hel while Bur covers Bel.  That would mean leaving
Kie wide open however and I find it unlikely.  I think that in the current
situation I'm back to favoring my original proposal:

Hol - Kie, Mun s Hol - Kie, Ber s Hol - Kie, Nwy - Swe, Fin s Nwy - Swe.

However, I'm willing to make this your call, so just let me know what
you want Mun to do, and if you want to take the safe route and just
hold Norway that's agreeable.

As to the future, we'll both build fleets this year.  If you get a second
one I think you should waive.  Next year we can evaluate.  I think it
will be worthwhile for me to build a fleet, which would mean taking Gre
>from you.  However, if you can take a center or have one left from this
year we might be able to have us both build as I could evict you from
Piedmont and you could retreat it off the board.  We can work those
details out after this year is over.

Thoughts?

I was surprised too, though I think really this doesn't change much. In
effect, this retreat allows a little more support of Nth and a little less
pressure on Norway. (In Sweden, he could attack Norway with support from
Nth and still use Bal and Den for duty around Kie and Ber; now if he does
that he just allows me to take Sweden.)


>Hol - Kie, Mun s Hol - Kie, Ber s Hol - Kie, Nwy - Swe, Fin s Nwy - Swe.

I guess I'm still inclined either to try for Nth or to attack Sweden the
other way. I am betting that he will not bother to attack Norway, assuming
that I will defend it. But I'm not quite sure yet what I ought to do.


>However, I'm willing to make this your call, so just let me know what
>you want Mun to do, and if you want to take the safe route and just

I don't think I want to take the safe route. But I will indeed let you know
about Mun. (I think I want you to order it to Ruhr, actually.)

Off hand I agree with all of that.

Sorry, I put this off too long and now I have to go. I'll come to final
decisions tomorrow.

Ok, I've decided. Let's go with *your* hunch:

>Hol - Kie, Mun s Hol - Kie, Ber s Hol - Kie, Nwy - Swe, Fin s Nwy - Swe.

Maybe I take Kiel, maybe I can retreat to Nth, maybe I get Swe instead of
Nwy. Any of these would leave me *some* chance of making progress, though
if I take Swe instead of Nwy and lose that F Hol I think the chances will
have dwindled pretty low.

So I'll support Munich to hold, although you can do it adequately yourself.

And remember to order Tus S Pie.

Just to make sure everything's clear, here is my acknowledged set of orders:

Russia: Army Constantinople -> Bulgaria.
Russia: Army Prussia SUPPORT Army Berlin.
Russia: Army Piedmont HOLD.
Russia: Army Berlin SUPPORT Fleet Holland -> Kiel.
Russia: Fleet Holland -> Kiel.
Russia: Army Finland SUPPORT Fleet Norway -> Sweden.
Russia: Army St Petersburg -> Moscow.
Russia: Army Silesia SUPPORT Austrian Army Munich.
Russia: Army Livonia HOLD.
Russia: Fleet Norway -> Sweden.

Looks good to me, the only question I have is about the move to Bul.
If we are going to trade back and forth I was thinking it might make
sense for you to stay where you could take Smy.  On the other hand
I guess we can trade Greece back in forth as well.  I'll send in my
orders in the morning and then send you a copy so you can confirm things.

Why? To trade in Gre if necessary?

I'd like to see that army go to Ven, so that it can support me in Piedmont.
Eventually Italy will get F Tys, and if he has F Tys, F Gol, UNIT Mar,
Piedmont will need the support from Venice.

You'll build a new fleet this winter, and you can use that to take Gre if
necessary.

If you want me to keep my A Con where it is, that's no problem.

Maybe if I beg hard enough he'll let me have a home center back.

A couple of reasons.  One, the army going to Bul.  Two, the ability to
take Greece with the Army and thus leave the new fleet open for
advancement.  I think that requiring the third fleet to end the year
in Greece puts a crimp on my options.  I don't see Italy having Tys,
Gol and Mar.  If he does, then I have Tun!  At the end of this year
either all the fleets will still be where they are (gol - tys , tun - Ion)
or he will have tun/tys and I will have Nap/Ion.  If I have to move the
new fleet to Gre in the fall, then it is not available to either support
or move into Ion, which means I can't try to creep a fleet forward.

As to supporting Pie, I think that Tyr can handle that task for a year or
two if needed.  Again, I don't think Italy will have Tus/gol/mar, but if
he does, then Boh/Sil support Mun and Tyr/Tus s Pie.  Also, if we end
up in that configuration (an english fleet in Tys perhaps?) and army
in Gre can go to Apu in a turn and then position to Ven.

So, overall, I think it is a better strategy to move it to Serbia.

Just wanted to drop you a note and ask you something.  From the way the
moves have played out the last couple of years, it seems as if you and Jamie
are just content to let the game play out into a four way draw (although
Jamie thinks I should take Manus out first).  Is this true?  I admit it
seems as if it's the most likely thing that could happen.

I suppose I could be content with that but I'd like to see if we can reduce
it a bit more.  As far as I can tell, the ONLY viable possibility for a
two-way draw would seem to be you and I.  I'm a long way now from being a
risk to win either soon or in the near-to-remote future.  Can we work
anything out?  I'd be willing to go for a two-way if we can take Jamie out.
Question is, are you willing?  Do you still see me as a threat to win if we
do this?  I'd like to get some comment from you.  I know we've been
discussing this mildly the last couple of years, but can we do anything
concrete?  If not, we may as well start voting for draws now...

Hoping to hear something positive  <g> from you

It might delay one of your options, true.

???

Suppose GoL S Tun-Tys? Then he obviously does occupy Tys, GoL, and Mar, and
you would not have Tunis. So I don't follow you. England will presumably
order MAO-Wes, so he could cover Tun. Now I do think Tun S GoL-Tys is more
likely, or possibly GoL-Tys and Tun-Ion. But even so it's just another
season or two until the blue and green between them will be in GoL, Tun,
Tys, and Mar.

That's fine defensively, but it means you can't even attempt to move the A
Mun. You couldn't use it to cut support from Kie, and you couldn't try to
enter Ruh. I figure, we're only going to have a few smallish chances to
make in-roads into the English position, and it'll be a shame if we have to
hold back and lose one of those chances.

>  Also, if we end
>up in that configuration (an english fleet in Tys perhaps?) and army

True.
Ok, it's just that it doesn't seem to me that we are going to be in any
hurry to get your fleets moving (since there aren't going to be any new
AngloItalian fleets sent to that area), and we might be sorry if we had to
devote A Tyo to defending Piedmont.

But it's not *that* big a deal. Even the loss of Piedmont wouldn't be fatal.

Looks like your (erstwhile) friend's little visit to your Dip board didn't
cost you anything in the end. I was really just considering two moves, and
the other one would have netted me Sweden (without losing Norway). But
honestly I think that just would have postponed the inevitable.

So, anyway, as far as I can tell, there's nothing left in this phase of the
game. Time for a realignment!


I think we have to eliminate Italy. But there are basically two ways to
proceed, I believe, and I don't know which one you (and Dave) will want to
use.

Tell me if you agree that this is the logical next step, and if so, how you
suggest we go about it. (Or would you rather I made a suggestion?)

First, sorry about the Serbia issue.  I've gotten so used to someone
having set wait on that I was assuming we could talk it out.  I was
considering doing it your way when the results suddenly came in!

I guess the other would have worked better in the north, that would
have put your army in Swe and the fleet retreating to Fin.  Now
it does look grim.  Sorry I was so convincing!

I heading home now and haven't had a chance to
look at things.  I'll do that over the weekend and see what I can
come up with either diplomatically or tactically.

Somehow, eliminating my only ally doesn't seem to have a whole lot of logic
in it for me.  I can see where you'd like my forces to be diverted from the
north, but it gets a bit hazy after that.  I can stonewall my way into a
draw, but
for the moment, it seems that any other move detracts from my position.

No I won't raise the old saw about you attacking Dave first, but that's
about
what it would take.

Of course, you're the one who raised the idea of re-alignment... hmmm.

Hi Cal,

I haven't had a chance to check out the results fully.  I still think
a two way would be rather anticlimatic.  I'll try to look at it over

Anticlimactic yes, but certainly less so than a cheesy three/four way, no?
(Unless,
of course YOU want to throw me the game too?  <g>)

I'll try to come up with a plan that has at least some chance of success,
but
we have probably reached the point where it will take a season or two of
subtle maneuvering to put it into effect.

FYI, Jamie has already approached me with the idea of pulling off a
"re-alignment" in the game.  He wants me to put Manus out first as the
price of this "re-alignment".

Why not? You get the lion's share of the spoils, and it loosens the
position. Sure, you would then have a chance of losing, but you'd also have
a chance of turning one of us. What happened to your "this is going to be
the game that Calhamer always dreamed of" attitude? ;-)


> I can see where you'd like my forces to be diverted from the
>north, but it gets a bit hazy after that.

Not at all. I don't see why you'd have to divert forces from the north. (If
you tried, Manus would catch on pretty quick, so I figure you should just
take Mar and Spa with the units that are down there already. If you move
Par-Bur, which is entirely natural, I'll support you into Marseilles, and
you can take Spain with the F Wes.) If it came to that, I'm sure you could
spare one of those six northern fleets. Surely five would be enough to
contain my mighty navy! And I do believe you are going to get Sweden back.
And then when you stab Manus, you'll get a couple more builds. I hardly
think you are going to be short of northern fleets.


> I can stonewall my way into a draw, but

Any other move than what?


>No I won't raise the old saw about you attacking Dave first, but that's about

I'm glad you didn't suggest that I should attack Austria first. You and I
each have eleven centers. Manus has three, Dave has nine. The idea that to
break up a stale position *I* should attack my nine-center neighbor instead
of *you* eliminating your three-center neighbor would have been pretty
absurd.

Well, you think about it for a while. I'll get back to you Monday.

I don't think it matters at this point.
But I do think you ought to start moving the army to Venice. Although, hm,
maybe it just doesn't matter now.

>I guess the other would have worked better in the north, that would
>have put your army in Swe and the fleet retreating to Fin.  Now
>it does look grim.  Sorry I was so convincing!

Yeah, actually, if I had also ordered Hol-Nth, I would now own both Nwy
*and* Swe.
(By the way, a fleet in Norway cannot retreat to Fin, of course.)

But after a little thought, I suspect it doesn't really matter. I believe
Cal could have taken back Norway and Sweden in a year or two, and though we
might have gotten you Kiel, I think he wouldn't have had any real trouble
locking everything up.

In other words, we've just reached the lock-up point a little earlier than
we might have.

I've mentioned to Cal the possibility of eliminating Manus now. Let's just
say that he is not enthusiastic about it. But I think he just hasn't
thought about it enough. I will try to persuade him that the only
possibilities left are (i) he helps eliminate Manus, or does it himself,
and (ii) we are left in a 4-way draw. I can't see how I'd have much trouble
convincing Cal of that! It's pretty obviously true.

Oh, and where do you think I should build? I figure, F StP(sc) and waive
the other build.
Although I might offer to build A Mos too if I have to negotiate with Cal.
With our 'unit swapping' capacity, it shouldn't make too much difference if
I do use up the build. And I'll probably lose Sweden anyway this year.

Yes, I need a plan.  Right now, the only plan I have is this:

Keep working with Cal while the opposition urges Cal non-stop to

A slip of the fingers there.  I meant to say a four way, not a two way.
I'm for trying something out.

Gee, ya mean that guy in white over there who stuck the knife in me
earlier?  He'd consider doing it again?  You really expect me to believe
that? (<:

Actually, in regards to your first note, it's less that we've been sitting
it out than that it appeared there was actually a chance to make something
happen.  When you let that fleet into Holland it opened up a number of
possibilities.  You guessed well this turn and shut most of them down.  It
was possible that I'd be in Burgundy and Jamie'd own Swe and Nwy this turn
which would have opened things up a bit.  Now things are locked down quite
a bit more.

Since Jamie is pushing for you to take out Manus, there is the possibility
for us to cooperate there without trigerring any reaction from him.  For
example, we could easily arrange for me to take Tunis, either with a
"lucky" guess in the spring or overt action in the fall.  After that I've
just got to figure out where the 17 centers I can hold are and then see

You have an army in Mos already.  You must be tired too (<:.

Yeah, the four way is pretty obvious.  The question is can we get rid
of Manus in a way that gives us a shot at breaking through Cal or are
we just going to a three way (which is of course better than a four way).
I'll try to look at it over the weekend.

I see! Well, that's an interesting plan.
So as you see it, your best bet is to just stay in roughly this position,
and maybe Cal won't eliminate you. Because he likes four-way draws?

Ok! I'll be interested to see how well this plan works.

Oh yeah.
I *am*, as a matter of fact.
Well, A Sev then. Anyway, it doesn't seem like a very likely bargaining
chip. I've submitted the order:
B STP(SC), WAIVE.

Well, the question is whether we can convince *Cal* to go for any
"eliminate Manus" plan that gives us a shot at breaking through. Off hand,
probably not. He seems even more cautious than I expected.

I've smelled 3-way for quite a while now. (For longer than you know! Well,
you probably suspected -- several gameyears ago, I tried to convince Manus
to eliminate *you* with me, and even then I figured the result would be a
3-way! But we can go into that some other time.)

>I'll try to look at it over the weekend.

Ok.

Anyway, I think my build on the south coast of Stp is correct, and we'll
have lots of time before the S1912 orders are due.

Well, I guess that's ONE way to put it.  However, a different way is
this:  don't antagonize the only guy who is not openly campaigning
for my elimination.  Instead, bend over backwards to keep one friend
in the game.

My message to you was an apparent failed attempt (I think I struck the
wrong tone -- seems to be my m.o. in this game) to maybe begin to
explore possibilities for re-establishing a different friendship, though
all evidence I have says you want me gone and Dave likes Italian food.

How much chance is there that I could beg and plead and you could see your
way clear to letting me have one of my home centers back?  Maybe we could
work together after that and the world will be such a better place for us
both.  Jamie is pressing Cal hard to eliminate me, and he's probably pressing
you hard the same direction, and he's sending feelers out that make me
think he's wanting puny little me to work with him and consider you the
guy squeezed out of the middle and then of course, I'll be the only guy in
the middle and Cal and Dave will race through me to get the solo.

You and me are in the middle now, and if we don't patch up our differences,
eventually I will die and then you will watch a solo as you get squeezed,
or else we will both live long enough at each other's throats to be squeezed
and we'll both get to see the solo.

Asking for one of my centers back is the minimum I can accept to get back
on your side, which is where I think we both belong.  But it's of course
up to you.  :-(

The big loss would be Manus's fleets which I couldn't replace easily, even
with
the "lion's share" (2 centres? Small lion...) of the spoils.  Also this
sudden southern
naval weakness would tempt Dave far more than I'd be comfortable with...

Calhamer dreams of perpetual seven-way draws...  Amyway, I'm not ruling

the risks inherent.

Like I said, it's the lack of southern fleets that would be the problem.

Really?  Which would have a bigger effect on the game dynamics?  Mind you,
I'm still not expecting you to do it, but calling it absurd is quite an
overstatement.

The current "score" is 20-14 for the Dark Side <g>.  I have a lot less room
to take
the sort of chance you're suggesting.

>Well, you think about it for a while. I'll get back to you Monday.

FYI, Manus is going to be away for a week so we'll have LOTS of time to

I'm a lot more comfortable with my position up north than I have been the
last
few turns (which is when I SHOULD have gotten this position...).  I feel
that
Jamie has no realistic chance to stop me from getting Sweden back,
eliminating
all his fleets and eventually taking St Pete's.  Unfortunately, that's where
things
bog down unless I get help from you.  We should be able to work things out
so
that we each take centres from him and achieve a balance comfortable for
both
of us.

As I explained to Jamie, I'm not comfortable with taking Manus out at this
point.
The current "score" is 20-14 for A/R and I'm not going to take out my only
ally
(and more important, my main source of southern naval power) at this point.

Once I have Swe & Stp, I will have 13 defendable centres and not much hope
of more.  I'm hoping that, by this point, you will have taken a few of
Jamie's
remaining centres and we can settle into the draw.  Manus can probably be
taken out then to ensure our division of centres.

>After that I've just got to figure out where the 17 centers I can hold are
>and then see how we can get there.

Fair enough.  Look at the board situation, do some counting and we'll see
what we can do.  My part probably won't change no matter what you do -
I will continue to push as hard in the north as I can.  I'll take Berlin if
I can,
but, as a gesture of good faith, will not try for Munich (unless you tell me
to
stick my plans in my back pocket, of course...<g>).

FYI, Manus is away for a week so we'll have some time to think.

Uh oh, let's not have another misunderstanding!

I'm just saying, I think that if you just sit and wait, you're awaiting
your execution, that's all.

You probably have a year to think it over, I doubt that King Kal is
planning to kill you right away. He may not even be *planning* to kill you
at all.

True.
Ok, let's think about how to take care of that problem, then.


>The current "score" is 20-14 for the Dark Side <g>.  I have a lot less
>room to take
>the sort of chance you're suggesting.

"Sides" are illusions, as you know. Only your own supply center count is real.

Ok, so here's what I think.

I think that you are going to take Sweden. If you decide it's worth the
effort, you will also take Stp.

At that point, you will have thirteen, and Dave and I will each have nine.
I believe that we will be able to figure out some way for you to take *all
three* of the Italian centers. For instance: you could sail one more fleet
into position to take Spain, maybe just go to MAO. Then, I will issue the
order Pie S ENGLISH A XYZ-Mar, and Dave can order F Ion S ENGLISH F
Wes-Tun, and we can just keep issuing those orders, you don't have to do
anything in return. When you are confident that we'll do those moves ad
infinitum, you can take Spa, Mar, and Tun, and presumably move yet another
fleet into MAO. I haven't worked out the details, but it certainly seems to
me that you could set up a perfectly good stalemate line for yourself at
that point. So that would be a 3-way draw.

If you're happy with a 3-way, or if you're just not willing to risk
anything else no matter how unhappy you are with a 3-way, then I think
that's going to be the result. If we get that far, I am fairly certain that
Dave won't stab me, and I don't expect that I would stab him, since you
would then have 16 centers and each of us (Dave and me) would have an
extremely easy time throwing you two more.


On Monday, let's have a big council, including Dave, and see what we all think.

He and I had a little exchange.  He told me (paraphrasing) "you need a plan,
not a puppeteer" and I told him that if he and Dave would stop begging you
(Cal) to eliminate me, I might be able to think of a different plan than
putting my eggs in the one basket that will actually hold them instead of
dump them out.  I thought he would come back with some tepid approaches
along the, "well, if you took out Dave a bit this way and hit Cal a bit
that way" lines.  That was too much to hope for, though -- he went stonily
silent and I imagine that was when he began making his demands of you.

I believe I have royally pissed him off.  Just be being stabbed by him!
Silly me.  I shouldn't be so interested in survival, perhaps?  :-)

Could be.  But unless you see something I don't, if I stop sitting and waiting,
like, let's say I stand up or something, it seems I would TRIGGER my execution.

Since you and Dave have that plan, and are urging it on Cal, my only (sad,
self-pitying face) choice is to hope that Cal resists your urging.  The
only card I have to play to mitigate against that possibility is to be as
nice to him as humanly possible.  If I hit him, I'm basically a spectator
