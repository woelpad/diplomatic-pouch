Whew.
Turkey and Austria both played nice to me, and England is not *quite* going
all-out Churchill.

But you were right, John is in for some trouble, looks like.

This next round should be fun.

Good thing I warned you, huh? Lotta good it did.

If you're working on England, let me know whether you are aiming to get him
to attack F or just to leave you alone. He might decide that a F/G war is a
good opportunity to begin funneling armies through Norway.

Dear Sultan,

I thought that went pretty well.
I was biting my nails over trusting you to leave the Black Sea vacant,
given what everyone was telling me about your northward predilections, but
I'm glad I did.

Italy is certainly making it abundantly clear that he's going to play
Lepanto, huh? No other possible attacks are left for him!

I can't say I like the way things are shaping up in the north, but I think
I'll keep playing mainly in the south and worry about that later.

Tsar Jamie

p.s. From your recent broadcast, I see what you mean about all that junk at
the end.
I think you might solve that problem by ending your mail to the Judge with
the word "signoff". And use the "endpress" command at the end of all press.
I *think* that will do it.

Oh, come on. You didn't *want* to take over Austria in the opening, because
you were afraid of the horrible Juggernaut, remember? And you thought it
would be foolish to open westward in a game like this one, and I think you
are right.

You have a nice, flexible position, and things are proceeding safely, and
you are sure to get your share of Turkey when the axe falls on his turkey
little neck, and you won't have to worry about any northern fleetbuilder
for quite a while.

And you have the best possible ally, don't forget that.

So you don't pick up Trieste or Marseilles in 1901, big deal. I assure you,
at least one of those will be yours in time.

I admit that it would be more interesting if you had an army in Tyrolia,
though. I'll give you that one. Why not discuss it with Austria and send
one heading that way now?

Pretty darn good assumption, I'd say... <G>

>Fleet in Norway, not army, please. Ok?


Promise.  One thing I might point out after looking at the Fall moves is
this:

England (moi) has F/G at odds and Russia with a full southern attack.
Russia (toi) has Germany involved westward, Austria & Italy seemingly going
after Turkey, Turkey being threatened by the two I just mentioned and a
friendly English neighbour who is much more likely to choose a side in the
west than attack north.

What this all boils down to is that you and both have solid opportunities
for expansion and no present threat to our security.  I figure that means we
should put that situation to our mutual advantage.  To whit (I always wanted
to say that), once the current situations develop a little further and our
respective neighbours get completely involved, I can foresee a E/R
juggernaut sweeping down out of the north crushing all opposition in our
wake.

Okay, so the cough syrup may have been a little strong this morning.  Either
way, it's something we should look at.  If nothing else, it would probably
take the rest of the board by surprise, an E/R seemingly out of nowhere.

True.
Not unusual for England, but quite a surprise for Russia, to have that sort
of security.
Of course, it is not *obvious* that Austria and Turkey will be at odds, but
it is pretty clear that Turkey will be focusing on the threat from the
Mediterranean side, and not on me.

I can see that.
Especially considering the fact that there's no possible stalemate line
against us. (My favorite part of playing Russia :-))

>Okay, so the cough syrup may have been a little strong this morning.  Either

Indeed.

Well, let's see. Obviously, it will be a few years before anything like a
serious thrust by us is possible. One nice thing is that we would hardly
ever have to cooperate right out in the open, I mean, we wouldn't be
supporting each other's moves except in case of an invasion of Germany. So
the thing would be extremely well masked. The alliance would really mainly
consist of our always choosing the 'right' next target, and never
interfering in the other's projects (except possibly in Germany).

Off hand, I think we'd need maybe some Italian help at some point. Or
Austrian help, depending on various factors, but probably Italian if
everything goes reasonably well for both of us.

And then in the ending it might be you and me racing for Tunisia, or even
preparing a 17-17 split (is this really feasible with E and R? I've never
thought about it) and poor old Italy desperately hoping that his central
position controlling the winning centers would be enough to get him a share
of a draw... but this may be too painful for you to contemplate. :-)

Hm, I must have that same brand of cough medicine.

No, seriously, I always like thinking about these Big Picture plans, even
though we both know that they are so often foiled by unforeseen
developments. And I like the picture you drew, it's my favorite big picture
so far.

Not holding my breath.

It would be a lot easier to play this game if Austria would write. He
hasn't said anything to me since the move, either, and practically nothing
before.

In fact, if Turkey had been more talkative, I think I would have lobbied
you to change your tack and go after Austria first. But Steve is also mute,
so what the hell, may as well go with the plan.

Well, that was a bit of an eye opener.  To me at least.  I can understand
John going for Burgandy if he didn't want you there, but to go to Denmark at
the same time?  Weird.  Now he really only has Denmark as a guaranteed
build.  Hmmm, mysteriouser and mysteriouser.

Anyway, it makes things easy for us vis-a-vis Belgium.  I trust our previous
deal is still on, so I'll just convoy in this turn.  I assume you'll be
taking a shot at Munich (just in case)?

Have you heard anything from anybody?  I think everybody is waiting for the
other person to write in this game.

Looks like you guessed right about Hohn, eh?  Too bad he supported the
Burgandy move.

Would you have any objection if I convoyed my army into Belgium this turn?
You aren't in a position to pick it up and I can (at least) make sure that
Hohn won't have it either.  Also, that second build (should I get it) will
make it easier for me to have the firepower to attack him with in S02 (which
I have definitely decided to do, btw).

I am as well.  It goes to show that you can't believe everyone and

the nature and intention of our relationship.  I, especially in light of the
Western situation, wish to forge ahead with the R-T.  I am concerned by the

Well, that's not precisely true.  He could convoy to Greece.  A serious
Lepanto involves landing an army into greater Turkey and that's just a
possibility right now.  Italy's opening, I believe consigns him to a game
without major breakout possibilities.  The hold in Rom is terrible.  I
liketo use the second army vs. Russia (nothing like an Italian in War in
'02). Fortunately for us, these Italians are quite nice.

The good news: Germany is probably so scared that you will walk into Swe.
The bad news:  France and England opened strongly, Germany flailed and Italy
stuck his head in the sand.  Depending on how E-F split the builds, you may
be facing King Kal in force by mid '03. If nothing else, France is already
in a very nice position.  If he can convince E to let him have three builds,
convoy to Nwy and bounce G out of Hol, wow!  And if G does something stupid
along the way, stand by...

I am looking for a commitment from you; then we can discuss our various
tactical options.

I was hedging. Isn't that obvious?

It's possible, but it doesn't make sense. If he had any plan to attack
Austria that brazenly, surely he would have an army bordering Trieste right
now. I can't imagine a more Austria-friendly opening than the Italian one.


>I liketo use the second army vs. Russia (nothing like an Italian in War in
>'02).

I like to put it Tyrolia, too, but usually planning to use it to balance
things in the north. If Germany is under fire, I use it to support Munich;
if Germany looks too aggressive, I use it to harass Munich. It's really too
bad the actual Italy doesn't have A Tyo right now.

I don't care if France grows a lot. (In fact, it might be good for us. If
we do get kind of locked up against Austria and Italy, we want Italy
looking over his shoulder.) I do care if England has too easy a time. You
think France will get Belgium, but I think England will convoy to Belgium.
England is neutral so far between Germany and France; I believe France will
offer Belgium as an incentive. This winter I might build F Stp(nc) to
correct the situation. But that depends on how things look in the south.

>I am looking for a commitment from you; then we can discuss our various
>tactical options.

You have your commitment.
Here's how I see the situation. With strong and strongly allied France and
England, I couldn't afford to join a 3-way alliance with Austria and Italy
even if they offered, because once they finished cutting you up Italy would
have to turn west, and I'd surely be fighting Austria and England, both.

By telling you that I'm complimenting you, in case you didn't notice. I
could just promise and commit and so forth, but I'm showing you *why* I'm
going with the R/T instead.

What do you think I should do with the F Rum? My inclination is to rotate
the three units: Rum-Sev, Sev-Ukr, Ukr-Rum. A better move is Rum-Bla,
Sev-Rum, Ukr-Gal, but I suspect you will insist that the Black Sea remain
vacant.

As for you, since you'll get just one build, I suggest you order Con-Aeg,
Ank-Con, and build F Smy. Otherwise you'll have real trouble with the
Italian fleets.

Plus he needlessly antagonized me.  Had he just asked for the mutual
bounce, I probably would have given it to him.  But he said he was OK
with it, and I took him at his word.  Good thing I took out a little
Marseilles insurance. ;)

We could do it that way.  Alternatively, we could totally trash John
by bouncing him in HOL while I take BEL.

I'm hesitant to even suggest this, as I don't really want three builds
(I know, poor baby), and I know you'll be uncomfortable with the idea.
But the opportunity to slam him this hard, this fast...it's sooooooo
juicy!

We'd have initial disparity, for sure.  But we'd rectify the situation
immediately in 1902.  And I hope you know I wouldn't be dumb enough to
stab you, thus making enemies of you AND John when I could have a
solid ally and a DEAD John, instead.

By the time I'd even be _tempted_ to stab you (i.e. when John is
completely neutralized), we'd have assuredly equalized centers and
power by then, which would obviously dissuade me.  I'll also agree to
build no fleets in BRE, certainly.

It's just a thought.  If you're not willing, I'll certainly abide by
the original agreement.

A one-liner from John.  You, and Jamie.  That's it.  I think you're
right (I personally have been swamped, as usual).

Any other thoughts on the turn?  My personal ones are that everyone is
opening conservatively (well, except John, and he paid for his
gamble).

Last minute word came to me that you were likely to attack.  If you
recall, you said it was okay if I bounced you in Bur, so that's what I
tried to do.  I knew you were moving there, so my move cannot possibly
be construed as an attempt to get into Bur myself.  Supporting your move
is the hostile act, not my defensive move in response to what turned out
to be solid information.

That's not to say the situation is irretrievable, but let's call a spade

I never wanted to fight.  My wishy-washy strategy was to take the

Hohn, you wrote the following:

>>But you lied to me, John, or at the very least, you attempted to
mislead me.  Your attempt to construe my support of PAR-BUR as hostile
when you had told me that my moving to BUR was OK with you anyway is
disingenuous, and flatly rejected.  Unless you are prepared to take
personal responsibility for your own diplomatic statements, I'm afraid
we have little else to talk about.  I can deal with, "OK, I tried to
mess with you, sorry, let's try to move on from here."  I have no
desire to engage any further than I already have in drawn out "he
said, she said" arguments, however.  The tone and substance of your
prior message to me regarding BUR/BEL is clear.<<

Now, I think it would be quite easy for overheated rhetoric to get in
the way of rational action at this point.  My last message told you the
truth.  I was apprised of possible attack just prior to the last move.
I tried to do the least possible to meet the rumored challenge, which
was to do the bounce in Burgundy.  If you had not supported the move,
the result would have been a simple standoff and no harm done.  I did
not try to mess with you.  It is quite true also that I did not move
into position to take Belgium as I said I would, but I wonder what you
would have done, given such information?  In light of the rumor, I did
interpret your support for Par-Bur as hostile.  I can understand your
reasoning, however, and I see no reason to question your motives.

Hmmm.  Perhaps my info source was trying to poison the well.  My bad,
then, for being gullible.

I agree to your suggestions for disengagement.  Your proposal is fair
and sensible.  I wish now I'd gone ahead with my original orders and
defended in Fall if I thought it necessary.

John,

I'm a blunt writer, John.  I think you know that by now, and hope you
understand it's nothing personal.

I'm not taking issue with whether or not you received word of some
kind of impending attack by me on you.  I'm taking issue with the fact
that you said you were OK with me moving to and getting into BUR, but
then tried to bounce me.  That is the lie/mislead I was referring to.

And again, how can I "attack" you in Spring 1901?  I'd already told
you I was moving to BUR, and you'd already agreed to my being there.
What could anyone else tell you about an attack by me that would make
you any more uneasy, to the point where you want to try to invade my
country in violation of our prior agreement?  How is an attack by me
on you even _possible_, under the parameters of the game and our
negotiations?

OK, sounds good.  Let's try to move on from here, then.

I've already thought of this, but I think I'd rather do it the way I
suggested, pretty much for the reason you outline below: the disparity
caused with you at three builds.  Plus, do you REALLY want to get three
builds and set yourself as a target?  You'd be sending fire alarms to the

Well, okay, what do you think about it?  I have nothing else to do with Bul
anyway, so I'm more than willing.  And, frankly, if I could somehow believe
I had gained favor in your sight, I'd be happy to build an army.  I would
request that you agree to go no further east by sea.  I would also suggest a
move of Rom-Ven (duh!) as the Austrian would no doubt be quite angry.  I
don't believe in being greedy nor in dividing centers that are not yet ours.
Therefore, I will merely pledge to work closely with you and choose the best
tactical/political option vs. Austria.

Of course, all of this presumes Austria will not support himself in.  He
initially indicated some interest in going for Rum.  I'll try to stoke those
fires.

This is merely one suggestion.  I'm open to others and would like to work
with you.  I know you want to build a second fleet and I'm looking for ways
to avoid feeling forced to compete with you.  Work with me.

I will not insist that it remain vacant as long as you tell me what you

I know.  The only reason I suggested doing it was because it would
make our job against John _so_ much easier.

> I think with both of us against him and a bad result in S01, John is pretty
> much on the ropes anyway.

See, the thing is, if he gets DEN and HOL, it's _not_ such a bad
result for him.  He gets two builds, same as you and me.

True, if both of us are against him, we'll take him down eventually
anyway; but it will take us longer, and in a game like this, I suspect
every turn will count.

Basically, the way I see it, letting him have HOL and having you in
BEL just allows us all the option of fence-sitting for one more year.
I'd personally rather have things declared, both because that will
make me more comfortable, and because as I said above it will allow us
to move more quickly on John (and eliminate him all the more quickly).

I feel good about our alliance, Cal.  I do.  But until we're formally
declared, until we move boldly against John, I'm sure you know that
that army you're convoying into BEL could be used just as easily
against me as it could be against John.  And, if John builds one fleet
and one army as I suspect he will if he builds two, then I'm also sure
you know that that fleet could be used against _you_.

See, that's why I prefer outright action when I'm confident in the
alliance, as I am with you.  Fence-sitting is not as powerful,
tactically speaking, and it also leaves room for doubts, and those
doubts can sometimes doom otherwise promising alliances.

Now, I know you have your own security concerns--and it's my respect
for you and your concerns that made me give you my commitment to
supporting you into BEL, a commitment which I will certainly stand by,
no matter what, if that's what you ultimately decide--but again, I ask
you, would I ever consider stabbing you after making an enemy of John
and building three this year?  There's no way.  I'd be slitting my own
throat.  Manus would be wary instantly, as soon as I built three, and
John's predisposition toward me is amply demonstrated by his stab into
BUR.  If I were suicidal enough to turn against you as well, I'd have
no allies and two, possibly three enemies.

I'd really like to think I'm not quite that nuts. ;-)

I understand, and I'll assume that's what we're going to do, unless my
words above sway you.  If they do, please just let me know and I'll
change the plan.

Heh.  He said, "Now that wasn't very friendly."

I of course responded with some sarcastic remark, and we had a bit of
a fight over semantics and technicalities.  Then he offered to
"disengage," and for the time being, I've told him that was fine.

Steve's a canny player, and I trust his ability to wiggle out of just
about anything.  John, well, he's hurting if he only gets one build.
Otherwise, we have a serious fight on our hands.

OK, the only other possibility is that I mentioned it to E, which I don't
believe I did (but I've not yet researched).  In any event, the Italian has
realized that he's painted himself into a very minor role and would like to
change that.  I'm working on the Greece angle with him, though I'm inclined
to support you into Rum (I just wanted you to ask).  If he'll go for it, I
don't really care if it's successful or not.  It will give us a huge edge on
A-I.

I've not heard from Cyrille either.  I gather that Italy's in the dark as
well.  Again, this bodes well for us.

I have to tell you that I'm not a big fan of your fleet "hanging out" (my
term) in the Black.  I can stomach it for this turn, but I would request in
return that you build your army in War.  This would help to preclude you
being tempted to convoy into Ank or something similar.  Also, you need War
unless you get Gal this turn.  Rumania's not in much danger unless Austria's
got Gal or can afford to mount a credible attack on Bul.  We have the edge.
We're okay.  Really.

Assuming you get two builds, you'd be foolish not to throw something in the
North, even if it's just A STP.  Sev instead of War?  I don't consider
myself paranoid, but that would be expecting a lot from me.

Take the fleet to Tunis.  You can then build your second fleet and I won't

Now that we have a couple of extra days, let's try to hammer this out.

Hm. That's interesting.
I didn't tell him that. I've just checked my logs to make sure.

Unfortunately, I have no idea whatsoever what Austria will be doing. (I
haven't heard a word from him since the S'01 results!) So, no, I'm not sure
I'll get Rum without supporting. I suppose you have other plans for your A
Bul than supporting my army into Rumania, huh?

As for what I would do with a F Bla in S'02: my plan is to use it to
support a new A Sev into Rum, while A Rum - Ser or Rum - Bud, for
support-cutting purposes or even an attack; or else just S A Rum, or if
neither of those is necessary, I'd put it back in Sev where it belongs.
(Upon request I could have it support you to hold in Bulgaria, or support A
Con-Bul if you were trying to move the A Bul.)

Much as it would be helpful to have the extra fleet in the Med, I don't
think it's feasible. If I tried to sail it through Con, I bet it would get
stuck, or anyway the chances of that are much too high. (I feel sure you
will agree.) Later, maybe, when you've cleared out some space in Aegean, or
when we might temporarily trade centers to let my fleet out. Or you could
just squish it (dislodge it and I'd disband it). That would be fine with
me. It's amusing, but not terribly important tactically, for me to get that
fleet into play.

Hm, yes, that's a good point. I was a little worried about our getting
bogged down.
Hm.
Well, if Austria adds Greece and Serbia, I'm not sure we'll be able to make
progress against him. He'd presumably build two armies. With a lucky guess
I could make some trouble for him, but it's not something I can count on.
If Italy gets Greece, then I agree we have the upper hand.

Oh, I get it.

I leave it to you.  To be honest, either way is perfectly fine with me.
Going after Austria first would work well for me in that it would allow
me to gain some trust with Turkey (my opening seems to have frightened him
no end).  He has offered to support me to Greece, but of course Cyrille
can support himself in).  I have no front against either power yet, and
it wouldn't bother me to set one up against either one.

Hello again:

Thanks for your message.  I am beginning to regret my non-commital Spring,
and am anxious to work with you with a committed direction.  We could indeed
keep Austria out of Greece as you propose, but the cost would be my 1901
build.

You are right that with my Tunis build, I would feel safer building a second
fleet, despite this being bad for working on the Austrian and despite the
fact that it may cause you some worry.  I want very much to get past this
and work actively with you.  To build more armies (if we work against
Austria -- if he is with us and you two head for Russia, I would stick to
fleets and perhaps head west), my second build must come from Austria (there
goes non-commitalness, huh?), and I am thankful to you for your offer of
assistance into Greece.

Wishing to hear your thoughts on all the above,
Manus

Hmmmm.
Hm hm hm.

Well, it's tricky. You have no good attacks on Austria. If you tried to
convoy, and either Austria supported a move to Gre or Turkey double-crossed
you, you'd be kind of screwed.

I wonder whether we can both finish the year without really committing
either way. I could move an army to Rum and move my fleet to Black, you
could convoy to Tun and maybe move the other army back to Venice. Hm, but
then you'd be committing yourself by building. And sitting on the fence so
long might just make Cyrille and Steve join up.

Argh.

Let's decide tomorrow.

Jamie:

Steve is writing much more than Cyrille, and his latest is a suggestion
that I take Tunis with the fleet.  I told him flat out at the gamestart
that my first build will be a fleet, and he says he is willing to work
with me (us) even with two Italian fleets, if the first of them lands in
Tunis and leaves the armies in the boot.  My whole rationale for telling
him I wanted a second Turk-friendly fleet was to keep him from having
naval aspirations, keep him bottled up in the corner for an A/I/R attack.
Now that we may be having a change of heart, a show that my fleets really
are Turk-friendly would be good anyway.  But it might tip our re-thinking
to Cyrille.  On the other hand, worst case it just delays a Lepanto thrust
for a season, making it all the more surprising if it does happen....

Hmm.  What to do, what to do....

Sultan Steve,

My plan was to build A War and A Sev. I do not particularly *want* to get
involved in the North. In fact, I was hoping not to. I was hoping to have
my F Swe just sit there and maybe support a neighbor, have him support me.
Let the sparks fly, show the northerners that I am totally involved in the
South, then as soon as Austria is on the ropes I'd jump in and make my
presence felt in El Norte.

However, if you are violently opposed to A Sev, then I'll build A Stp, A
War. And then, sure, I don't mind moving the F to Sev in Spring '02.

If I'm to be fighting Austria with just three armies (Austria will have at
least three), I want to try to get Italy in on it. I assume you have no
objection if I start to lobby Italy hard to get those armies of his bearing
against Trieste, right?

Along those lines, do you want him to convoy to Greece, or to move his
fleet there?

Manus,

Cyrille isn't giving us much of a choice. I would still rather ally with
him, but I don't see how we can.

So let's say that unless we get a flurry of Austrian notes in the next
couple of days, we're changing the plan. (Changing back again will require
both of us to agree.)

I see what you mean, if you land a fleet in Greece, that will be about the
end of the chances for a real AIR witch hunt. Hm. I guess my instinct is
that you ought to convoy to Tunis and order Rom-Ven. That still leaves both
good options. I will try to leave my units in an ambiguous position, too,
while giving the main impression that I am planning to help Turkey stave
off the fiendish AustroItalian Conspiracy that is obviously brewing (Why
isn't Cyrille talking to me or to Steve? He must be talking to *somebody*!
I wasn't sure what to do, but now I see that I *have* to join forces with
Turkey just for defense. That sort of thing.)

Anyway, let me know what you decide. Or don't let me know, just go ahead!

Your suggestions were exactly what I was considering doing.  Convoy to
Tunis and send Venice to Rome.  I think that my leaning is now toward the
more talkative Turkey, but my moves should allow me to continue my claim
Austrian friendship if need be (i.e., if Cyrille sends me any mail) for
at least another season.

Only problem is that leaves StP vulnerable any time England wants it. And,
he's not likely to care for you propping up Germany.  You can try to ride
the fence, but weakness in the North is likely to invite English
naughtiness.  As for Austria, I have two armies as well you know.

Not at all.  I'm already on that and may have secured his promise to take a
fleet to Tunis rather than convoy.  This would be huge in the effort vs.
Austria.

He doesn't want to go unless Austrian communications make it clear it would
work.  So far, there haven't been any.

Okay, I have decided on a course of action.  I'm going to go ahead and convoy
to Tunis (rather than dock the fleet there) and move my Rome army to Venice.
I know you would prefer that I land the fleet, but this way I will be up
against Greece for 1902 efforts.  I don't want the fact that I'll be in the
ION to frighten you.  I would prefer to build a fleet in Naples (ION-ADR,
NAP-ION would be the probability), but will at least consider building it in
Rome if you are scared of a Lepanto thrust into your waters.

Though Austria doesn't speak, if I build in Naples, he will think I am pro-A.
By building in Rome, I just look indecisive.  I think I can make him okay with
Rom-Ven.  So we will hopefully have his trust going into the next year.

I can't stop it, but this is demanding a LOT of trust on my part and none on
yours.  You maintain (if you build F Nap) the ability to Lepanto, which
virtually forces a build of F Smy.  That's why I suggested the fleet move,
so that my build could be something else.

How could I not be "scared" (I prefer "concerned" by the way)?  I'm just
asking for one (count'em 1) sign of trust here; something I can work with.
If F Rom leaves Austria thinking you're neutral, maybe he'll offer something
to woo you back!  Maybe he'll write!

I'm not threatening or anything of the sort.  I just wonder, if the roles
were reversed, on what basis would you be trusting Italy to not go through
with the Lepanto promised in the initial negotiations?  I don't want to
build a second fleet.  I want to work this out.  I'm just not sure how to do
that if you convoy and build F Nap.  Help me!

Well, dang.  I really truly want to make sure you know I'm your friend.
In hindsight, opening to the TYS would have been the way to go now, but it's
obviously too late for that.  I always like to at least abut Greece in the
opening in case both A and T decide it could go Italian.

I do realize where you're coming from, though, but I want to make sure we are
both having something to do.  If I put my fleet in Tunis, I have a year before
it can do anything at all.  A fleet in Rome is a year and a half away from
any action anywhere.  If we are to attack Austria, it makes no sense to me
to move away from there and lose a year.

I'd like to agree to build an army, but it just wouldn't work.  Three armies
and a fleet is no way to go for Italy.  I was afraid this would happen,
and this is the reason I came to you before anything else in the game and said
"I intend to build fleets and will open to the ION."  I have been up front
with you about it from the beginning, hoping that this would show my desire
for friendship.  I am real sorry that I have only raised your level of concern
rather than lowered it.  I consider it a major diplomatic failure on my part.

I know you want to see a sign (more than just my words) that my seagoing
intentions lie ION and westward and no further east, and I wish I could come up
with such a sign to show you which doesn't take me out of position for actually
making some progress.  My moves are already in for Apu-Tun and Rom-Ven but
if we can come up with something you like better and that gives me a good
position for next Spring, I'm all for it.

Dang, I just got busy at work and will need to resume this conversation
later.  Aauugghh!

Dear Sultan Steve,

I know, leaving Stp open can be tempting to England. It would be a
calculated risk.

Anyway, I'm game for building A Stp, A War. So no problem there.

I've suggested to Italy that it would be a very good idea for him to get
those armies into a more aggressive posture. It's a shame that they can't
get into the really good position they'd be ready for if he'd done
something more ordinary with the A Ven (like hold!). But in any case, he
seems amenable. I think he is a little worried about the idea of AI vs RT,
considering that Cyrille isn't talking. He would like to make friends with
either you or me now. So he ought to be open to at least a little
persuasion, which will make things easier.

I guess we're more or less set now. Let me know if you have any requests or
if there are any new developments.

Tsar Jamie,


I'm cool.  The only development is Italy's insistence on playing a Lepanto
and insisting that he's going to swing into Austria instead of me.  On the
face of it, it's great.  But, I can't afford to not build F Smy (and might
not anyway) when he'll have the ability to convoy into my backdoor if I
don't keep pace.

I had him taking the fleet back to Tun, but he changed his mind.  Little
matter with a comatose ally, Italy poses a small threat.

OK, help me out here.  What is the difference between opening to TYS and
moving to Tun now?  Tactically, assuming the pick-up of Tun, there is none.

All true.  But, even you must admit that it would be a HUGE leap of faith
for me not to build the second fleet given the circumstances your proposing.
With what I am proposing, you'll be in position for a F'02 move into Gre
(hopefully with my support.  I'd promise it now but that might be foolhardy
given my complete lack of knowledge of what the board will look like.) and a
shot at Tri if you move into Ven now.  If Russia moves as promised, Austria
may have other, more pressing concerns than your A Ven.

Well, the term "Lepanto" was a little scary.  I believe you, but I'm not

Well, again, consider A Rom-Tus (or hold), A Apu-Ven, F Ion-Tun.  Build F
Nap.  Then, F Tun-Ion, F Nap-Tyh, A Ven-Tyl, A Rom-Ven.  There are some good
possibilities for the fall.

You've got a point there.  I didn't think my statement out enough.  I always
open to ION because I like to test the Grecian waters.  You're right that
an opening to TYS puts me a season off my usual pace, and that's why I
didn't.

> All true.  But, even you must admit that it would be a HUGE leap of faith

Yes, I suppose you're right.  If you choose to build a second fleet, I will
not (as most Italians would) consider it an act of war.  Rather, I will
view it as a defensive measure, and my moves will make it clear that our
paths will not cross.

My reason for wanting to stay in the ION is to make the possibility be a
Spring one (though we might not exercise it until Fall, depending on how long
we want to string the Silent Cyrille along) rather than a Fall one.

Indeed I am moving into Venice.

Understood.  My apologies for tossing the scary word out there.  Just
wanted to acknowledge that Apu+ION in S01 might make you think the word,
but that I have no intentions along those lines.  I will understand if
you protect your interests (as I probably would) but am very happy that
we were able to talk about it all along so that we can work together no
matter what army/fleet configuration we both choose.

My thinking sends Rom-Ven, Apu-Tun.  "Half-Lepanto"?  :-)  I want to keep
Austria (if his head is in the game at all) thinking that I am a friend to
him.  In '02, my new Naples fleet could go to ION while ION goes to ADR
and in Fall I could convoy Tun-Tri or take it from Ven (w/ADR support)
while you help me into Greece.

I apologize for the rocky start, but I think by the end of '02 we will
be very comfortable with each other.

Steve,

That's a little disappointing, but it doesn't surprise me.

I think Italy now sees that it's got to be an RIT alliance at the start,
and he's just trying to position himself for the 'breakup' that comes when
Austria begins to disappear. He wants to be the dominant Mediterranean
power, so that you and I will fight each other instead of going our
separate ways (with your separate way lying through Italy, and mine maybe
through Germany with a little assist to your land division, I'm sure you
get the picture).

I hope that's what he's thinking, anyway. It's a superficially plausible
plan, but I think you'll agree that it's not very well thought out. But we
can discuss the details after the current phase is better established
(like, when you're in Serbia and I'm in Budapest). Unless you'd rather get
them all out on the table now?

Geez, sorry this took so long, but I'm sure YOU can relate to long hours at
work... :)  Anyway, it was worth it.  Just got a raise and a promotion!

I admit your arguments in favour of going to Hol would make things harder
for John, but I still want to stick with the original plan.  I just honestly
think that second build I can get will offset any advantage John may get
with a second build of his own.  I suppose, if I'm being honest with myself,
the wimpy start I got in the last game that turned into a gamelong wheelspin
is probably in the back of my mind, but I still think that we will have John
by the short and curlies.  If Russia had opened with a less southernly
committed attack, I'd go along with you because then John would have a
potential ally, but since Jamie did, John doesn't and I can live with that.

As for your legitimate concern that I will be effectively "undeclared" in
our war against John, I can understand that.  In the Great White North, we
call that "pulling an Edi"... if you catch my drift... <G>.  But anyway,
that's something else I guess I have to ask you to do.  My future actions
will redeem me in your eyes.

It bloody hard to get a read on a game when it's as damned close to GunBoat
as this one seems to be.  Even Jamie is only writing when written to and
that's unusual (if Ghodstoo was any indication).  Actually, that's another
reason I want to work with you.  Even though you go through "blackouts" when
you get busy at work, for the most part you are a consistant communicator
and will generally reply promptly.  The only time John ever wrote me last
game with any semblance of frequency was when he was trying to get me to
stab you towards the end game.  You and I both know that the most frequent
writers get the best results.

>Steve's a canny player, and I trust his ability to wiggle out of just

See above...  As for Steve, yeah, I know, I've watched him in FTF action on
several occasions (although I've never been in a game with him til now, I
know how good he is; mind you, I rank you and him as about even).  Next time
you and I meet face to face, remind me to tell you a story about CanCon and
Steve.  These letters will be archived and this is "not for broadcast"...

FOR YOUR EYES ONLY!

You know, I have to say that my experience with FTF'ers show them to be (in
general) a very hot-tempered, not-so-nice, I'm right, you're wrong, bunch.
This Cooley fellow apparently fits that mold.  I don't want to drive any
wedges between the communities, because I participate in both, but for my
money, we PBEM'ers are the class act of the hobby.

Well, I have seen a picture of Jamie on his Web page, and though he
doesn't wear glasses, I still knew that "YOUR EYES" in this case
would number four.  :-)

Personally, she no matta me whether we start over or not.  For this
reason, I find it hard to believe that the call should be labelled
so 100% cut-and-dried.  But it's no water off my back (whatever that
means).

I shoulda been in that game.  This one has little press, and frankly,

Thanks for climbing aboard.  Assuming we don't restart the game, here's
the lowdown on things.  I got one (maybe two) messages from Austria before
he disappeared, but in that brief contact, we managed to do a lot.  We
agreed to DMZ Venice, Trieste, and (with Germany) Tyrolia.  We also
talked Lepanto.  I asked if he wanted to do a Key, but he demurred.

So I opened with the wonderful "A ROM H" opening.  I got bored.  From
intelligence around the board, it was learned that Germany is going to
be in for a rough ride (the steamroller is revving up).  So with my Rome
army doing little of anything, I wrote to Austria asking permission to
go to Venice and then to Tyrolia so that he (now you) and I might either
get in on the German feast, if there is to be one, or support a German
Munich if we decide that is better.  One or the other to slow down the
E/F steamroller.

I never heard back from Austria, but I went ahead and put my orders in
assuming it was okay.  So I'm moving Rom-Ven and convoying to Tunis.
Turkey is none too happy that I opened Lepanto-like.  I've tried to
convince him I have no concrete plans (because I don't) but I will
bet dollars to navy beans that he'll build F SMY.  :-(  I am hoping,
then, that ROM-VEN might convince him to leave the waters to me for
an extra turn or two, but I doubt it will be enough.

I'd like, in short, to work with you, and what little view I have of my
future has me heading into Venice/Tyrolia (looking anti-Austria to convince
Turkey, but all with your full knowledge, and mostly to give my extra army
something to do), and trying to get a hold on the Med.  FYI, I have the
standard DMZ with France, but I suppose if the steamroller gets too much
momentum, I may have to be the one to break it.

I don't know what you make of all this, but I suppose I will know as
soon as you write back.

Once again, welcome to the game!

Sultan Steve,

1. Unfortunately, my stupid joke turned out to be obscure. In my most
recent broadcast, I was *merely* making fun of the fact that you had just
broadcast the same message twice!

2. I personally have no objection to starting anew. It's just that I think
it would have to be unanimous among the players to do that, otherwise it
looks as though we are depriving those players who had the best starts of
their advantages. In an earlier broadcast, I specifically mentioned King
Kal, though as a matter of fact I don't think his opening position is above
average for England. But some of our observers said that his was the best
position, and he may possibly agree.
I'm still happy to restart, personally. If everyone else agrees, I won't
stand in the way.

3. In case the game does continue in the current position:
I'll still commit to playing anti-Austria. Naturally I want to hear what
this new guy says, but I don't think promises get cancelled whenever a new
player shows up, so I will abide by our earlier agreement.

4. I think I'll say a little something more in a broadcast, to capitalize
on the fact (and it is a fact) that some onlookers think that your most
recent broadcast shows a rift in T/R relations. If I can encourage this
appearance, I think it will make Italy more likely to take Austria as his
first target. Let me know what you think of this idea, I won't say more in
public until I hear from you again.

Well, can't say I know a whole lot about you either (<:.  I've seen your
name around I know, perhaps in TAP?  I've been in the hobby for probably
7 or 8 years now, but I quite playing through the judges 5 years ago when
I changed jobs and have been doing postal and FTF only since then.  Just to
let you know, so you don't think I'm ignoring you, my email is at work and
my boss is not sympathetic to playing games during working hours.  That means
that I tend to send/receive messages in the morning before work starts or in
the evenings when it's over.  I do check it everyday, but I don't have
access on the weekends.  This week however, the boss is away, so I should
be able to catch up quickly and get things going.

>So far, it would appear that the feared Hohn Cho (F) is off to a fine =
>start.

I know he's a big name on the judges, but as I said, I've been off them for
years, so I haven't run into him.  Of course I once had a high ranking on
the judges myself, so I know how little that means (<:.  I did follow ghods
in TAP, so that's my sum experience of Hohn Cho.  Just enough to know to
watch out for him.

Well, given the Russia opening, there does not appear to be anyway I can
take Rum, even with your support, so an attack there would seem rather
ill advised.  I'm not at all adverse to an A/T, even though I did just
get reamed in on as Austria in the Diplomacy World demo game, but it's
pretty hard to pull off if both Italy and Russia are playing a southern
game.  What we need to do is to convince either/both of them to make moves
on their other fronts.  A big, big plus would be if we could get Germany
to bounce Russia out of Sweden.  That would force him to use his build
in STP, and would open up the options for us considerably.  We should also
both work on getting Italy to head west, playing as much as possible on
the Fearsome French reputation.

If we really want to do this, an early attack is also best, which would
mean my moving to Gal and you moving to Bla and Arm.  Are you open to this?
The big problem of an A/T is of course that T ends up wrapped around A,
leaving him rather vulnerable.  Since I'm still picking the blades out of
my back from the last time I tried that, I'd want to take a pretty cautious
approach as far as my own defense.  Having you expand into Russia with
armies and towards Italy with fleets would make me rather uncomfortable.
How do we work around that and keep things equitable enough that you'll be
okay with it?  From my perspective, given the strength of your position in
an A/T, it's reasonable that your early growth is slower so that I can have
enough force to head north and still protect my homeland.  What are your
ideas on this?

Looking forward to a good game!

Hi Manus,

Thanks for the rundown.  I'd kind of assumed some sort of A/I pact from
the opening (<: .

I'm definitely in favor of an A/I, particularly if there is a strong
E/F forming, even more so given the reputations of those two!  The question
is really how to maximize our growth so that we are ready for the inevitable
French incursion into the Med.  Given the openings, I'd expect that we'll
see France taking Por and Spa.  England could convoy into Belgium without
Germany being able to do anything about it, but if I were them, I'd have
him go to Holland instead to bounce the German and prevent a build.  That
means France might even get three builds, although I doubt it's too likely.
With that kind of start against Germany, and Russia in the south, you might
even see France heading south in 1902, I'd certainly be pushing for it as
England.

Based on that, I have no problem with you going to Ven, but I think you might
need to go to Pie, not Tyr next.  Sounds like we probably will not want to
do anything to speed the fall of Germany, and if we are going to prop him
up, I can probably better spare the army there than you can.  Having armies
in both Pie and Tyr is a lot stronger for us as well.

When you say you have a standard DMZ with France, does that include TYS or
not?  The problem with Lepanto is that it takes a long time to get Italy a
second build, leaving you vulnerable to France, especially with fleets going
east.  There's something to be said for moving a new fleet to TYS, but if we
want to take out Turkey, then you need to be in Ionian and Eas/Aeg.

My suggestion for the moment is that you move as intended (armies to Tun and
Ven), then build F Nap.  I'll take Gre and have to consider whether or not to
try for Gal (thoughts on that?).  I'll do my best Diplomatically to turn the
Turk back towards Russia, and of course you need to do the same.  If he comes
out into Aegean, we are going to have a hard time of it unless we can get
Russia to join us.

For next year, a lot will depend on what France builds.  You need to apply
as much pressure as possible (without annoying him of course (<: ) to get
him to not build in Mar, or, if he's getting three to make sure it's an
army.  If he does build there, then I'd suggest that you move the army to
Pie, perhaps even telling him you are doing so and arranging a bounce.  If
he does come your way we could even consider you taking Trieste for a build,
depending of course on what happens with R and T.

If there seems to be any hope of working with Russia, then I'm disinclined
to take Gal as that would just cement the R/T.  Let's see what we can both
do to cement the idea of an AIR vs EF set up.

Regards,
Dave

P.S.  My email is from work and generally I can only check it in the mornings
before we start or in the evenings.  This week is an exception as the boss
is away.  I don't have any access on the weekends, but I do check twice a

Well, I just heard from Dave, and I must say I'm impressed.  He speaks
long and clear on the possibilities for an A/I, wanting very much to keep
Turkey bottled up and to get you (Russia) into an AIR alliance to combat
a strong E/F.  He warns about the possibility of an early French presence
in the Med, and says that he's fine with my upcoming move Rom-Ven (which I
told him about).

It includes a prohibition against my having a fleet in BOTH TYS and Tun at
the same time without approval, a similar one against France having fleets
in BOTH MAO and Spa/sc at the same time, and it includes a ban on fleet builds
in Rome and Marseilles without prior approval.  Whew!

In filling the new Austrian in on my diplomatic situation, I summarized
the DMZ I have with you as below.  I want to run it past you because I
admit I inserted a clause in the translation, but it's one that I imagine
you're fine with, and so I'd like to get your approval on it:

Neither France nor Italy shall, without prior consent of the other:
   (1) build a fleet in Rome or Marseilles,
   (2) move any unit into Piedmont,
   (3) move a fleet into the Gulf of Lyon, the Western Mediterranean, or
       North Africa,
   (4) station a fleet in BOTH the Tyrrhenian Sea and Tunis,
   (5) station a fleet in BOTH the Mid-Atlantic and on the south coast
       of Spain.

As you can see, I added point 5, which is the French equivalent of point 4.
Just wanted to see if this is okay with you.  If so, I would like us to
consider it as part of our agreement.

Hi yourself!  I strained my memory trying to decide where your name is

about 5 years ago, but one of the last games I played in was a play test
of a variant called Juggernaut.  I believe you and Tim Snyder co-authored

I can certainly understand that you do need to reassess.  Having said that,
I'd like to make my case for staying with Cyrille's plan.  While I have not
played with most of the people in this game (Cal being the exception), their
reputations do preceed them.  The moves and the information that I've been
getting (quite an outpouring so far!) seems to point towards and E/F forming,
do you think this is the case?  If it is, then I think that an AIR, at least
for the moment is going to be necessary.  England is in position to limit
Germany to a single build, and France could possibly get three.  With my
preliminary evaluation of Italy the same as yours (I was going to say
"extremely cautious", but just because I was being polite), I think we have
to worry about France coming into the Med early on, and probably doing rather
well against Italy.  Given all that, I think we need to get Turkey out of
the way quickly for a number of reasons:

1) So that you are free to build in the north and slow down England/shore
up Germany.

2) So that Italy can spare his attention for the west.

3) In the case that Italy proves either spineless or incapable of putting up
   a good defense, to remove Turkey from the backfield so that I can take
   out Italy and assume the defense of the Med.

In the long run, I like the A/R alliance a lot.  It's a little slower to
get going in the Med than the A/I, but has the great advantage of those
northern fleet builds.  If we play a fast offensive game, I think we can
beat out an E/F.  In the short term, I think we should go with an
AIR to take out Turkey and evaluate the threat from E/F.

Specifically, I'd suggest that we make the attack on Turkey as hard and
fast as possible, with Italy setting up for the Lepanto, my taking Greece
this turn, and you pushing south.  The best moves in my opinion would be:

Russia: Sev - Arm, Rum - Bla, Ukr - Rum
Austria: Bud s Ukr - Rum, Alb - Gre, Ser s Alb - Gre

That would pretty much guarantee the fall of Turkey rather quickly.

Yeah, that was me!
I knew that I knew your name too, but I never would have remembered that it
was from Juggernaut.


Yes, I do think there is an E/F, not forming but formed.

I don't know what to do about it. I'd like to help prop up Germany, but on
the other hand I expect to be busy in the South and don't want to have any
trouble in the North if I can help it. If I try to help Germany and fail,
I'll certainly be next on England's list. If I leave them alone, I think
maybe England might decide to use his positional advantage against France
next (envisioning French moves into the Med).

I agree with you about needing the AIR.
I am a little wary of leaving you really big and strong at the end of the
opening, but under the circumstances it appears to be the best approach for
me. (My thinking is that I would build northern fleets as soon as Turkey
has been rendered harmless, and you would push your armies into Germany, or
maybe the remnants thereof if Germany succombs to the F/E.)

Off hand, I'm a little worried about your suggested move, because I'm a
naturally conservative player. I admit that it is by far the best
anti-Turkish move, but to be brutally honest, it leaves me very wide open
in case you've really decided that you should be on Turkey's side in this
fight. Hm.

Give me another day or two to mull it over. I *think* I'm with you on this.

p.s. I think I'll have to pass on the Incident (again!). With three kids,

Hm, yeah.

Listen, if France does plan to occupy the Med next, I'm afraid I think we
have to do something about that, no matter which way we decide to align in
the South. I mean, either we eliminate Austria, and then you have to face
France and you might get pincered by F and T, or we eliminate Turkey, you
go fight France, and then I'm up against England and Austria. I don't see
any other way. (Unless I could persuade Austria to attack you :))

I hate to do it, but maybe I ought to assist England into Germany, and hope
he'll take that as a good reason to stab France soon. That would ease
everything up. Or can you think of some other idea? I guess I could prop up
Germany and take Norway, then I could hold out in the north with minimal
forces and maybe take on either Austria or Turkey myself if you turned west.

The other thing to worry about (I know I haven't given you enough yet) is
that it does not seem as though you will be able to get a Turkish center
any time soon, even if we do go AIR. You'd be stuck at four centers until
the end of '03. Yike. That's too vulnerable. If we go with IRT, maybe you
could take Greece and flank Trieste. We'd promise Serbia to Turkey, I'd
stay at 6 for the year but that's not so bad since I'd have four in the
south and nobody threatening me. If you guys took Ser and Gre and you had
Tri flanked at the end of '02, I'd probably get Bud or Vie in '03. Yeah,
but Turkey isn't going to help you get Greece, that would be stupid of him.
To give you the better position after Austria falls.

Another thought: maybe I should be working Hohn to prepare an attack on
England. My line would be obvious: France can't wait around hoping England
will remain friendly, that always ends up badly. Hm.

Tough game.
Hey, maybe we could start over!

Hohn,

I feel that I'm beginning to get myself into a good diplomatic position in
the south (knock on wood).

Here's this problem I've been worrying about. Suppose that you and King Kal
invade Germany, as to all appearances you are about to do. Then either I
sit around and let you do it, or I try to help Germany survive, or I
actually support Kal into Denmark or something. If Germany is overrun fast,
then I'm afraid I face King Kal and a southerner at once, and I don't
expect to be strong enough to do that (I might be reasonably large, but not
large enough to fight on two fronts when everyone else is fighting on one).
But if I support John, then either I succeed, in which case I'm really
screwing up your personal game plan by freezing you until some southerner
comes for you in the Mediterranean, or I fail, in which case [see above
scenario about fighting Cal plus someone in the south]. I hate all of these
scenarios.

But what's the alternative?
I bet you would *like* to get a surprise stab in against Cal in 1903 or so.
Because I bet you don't want to see an endgame with England strong, since
those are always bad for France. But I bet you don't feel like you'll be
able to do it, because you think some Medi-power would take grossly unfair
advantage of you.
Somehow it seems like our two concerns should be mutually remediable. I can
see a number of possibilities. Is there anything that occurs to you?

(Needless to say, I may be deceiving myself, it's quite possible I'm about
to feel the knife myself and won't be around to work with you in '04.
Doesn't seem like that's true, but, you know how it is.)

Well, I remember it because I got to play the Juggernaut.  As I remember,
I had I/R and I had a lot of fun with the game because I formed an A/I
vs an R/G and then gave Russia the solo.  Even in the EOG no one guessed
that R had been part of the Juggernaut.  Did you keep the variant going?
Has it been played much?

That would obviously be your call.  If you think you can influence it that
way, then holding off until just after the stab would be a good move.  Of
course, in an AR, you can't stay down south too long, makes the natives

As I saw it, you really only had two good choices in the south.  The first
is to have Sev and Ukr support Rum, the only way to protect it in the face
of an A/T, and then T gets into Bla and Arm anyway if there is an A/T (the
last time I tried one, in the Diplomacy World demo game, I got a broadsword
in the back from my Turkish ally), or the all out attack. A single support on
Rum isn't worth anything as it can be overwhelmed.  To
let you know up front, when I've formed an alliance I have a tendency to think
in terms of the moves that will work best for the alliance as a whole.  That
means that I sometimes forget to consider how the moves might look to my
ally in reference to our relative positions.  If my suggestions look like
I'm trying to set you up, please point it out rather than assuming the worst.
I don't have a problem with taking a slower approach if necessary, I just
tend to think in a rapidly offensive style because I've found it works quite
well.  Should you not be comfortable with the wide open attack on Turkey,
I'd still like very much to work with you.  I'm equally willing to say that
you need not tell me how you want to do it.  In that case though I would
prefer not to use Bud to support Ukr to Rum as I would not want to tip my
hand to Turkey if you opted for the hold.  That makes it a little more
risky, but I don't see Turkey opting to bounce you for Rum without a
commitment from me.

Beirmeister Dave

Greetings!

First the brief intro.  I used to play on the judges about 5 years ago,
but dropped out due to a job change and easy email access.  Since then
I've been playing actively postally, and running a local con in Boston
twice a year to get my FTF fix.

The one consistent thing that I've been hearing in this game already is
that you are facing an E/F that is gunning for you.  Don't know what that
is worth as I'm the newcomer and people tell me all kinds of things about
everyone else (<:.  Anyway, I wanted you to know that as long as that is
the case you certainly don't need to worry about any pressure from the
south, and, in fact, if I can resolve things quickly enough down here I
might be able to lend an army for support should you desire it.

Not much else to say now except hi, and I'm looking forward to a good game.

Regards,
Dave

P.S. I access my email now from work and can only do that before or after
the working day, and not all on the weekends.  I do check it twice a day,
so I don't expect this to be a problem, just letting you know that I'm not
ignoring you if you don't get a quick response.

Hello Cal!

Greetings once again.  Due to lamentable circumstances we didn't get to
do much in our Black Hole game in Costaguana.  I'm looking forward to
making up for that here.

There's not much that Austria and England can do together in the early
years, and that often leads to them being locked into opposing alliances
and never even considering how well they can work together in the mid-game.
I'd like to avoid that and keep the lines open with you.  Our distance can
make us very good allies as the chances of a stab are greatly reduced.
However the opening moves shake out, we should consider how joint action
might work for us in a few years, particularly should Italy and France
lock horns in the Med.

Looking forward to the game,

-Dave

Vive le Empereur! (Or some such, my high school french is rather rusty.)

I don't think we've ever played together as I can't make it to the big
cons (small children don't leave much time for gaming).  I used to play
a lot on the judges but dropped out about 5 years ago due to loss of
easy email.  Since then I've been playing a lot postally and organizing
a small local con in Boston to get my face to face fix.

While an A/F is not that common an alliance, I have found that it can
work reasonably well as long as France does not make too large a
commitment into the Med.  Were this still Winter 01 I'd be strongly
advocating that an F/G vs E to help position us for the possibility,
but it appears to be too late for that.  However, simultaneous attacks
on E and I in a few years could still lead to a very powerfull alliance,
and I don't want to rule that out.  So, let's keep the lines open and
see where the first few years lead us.

Best regards,
Dave

Welcome to the game, and thanks for taking over the position.

I am not sure E/F are solidly united.  It could be that F is more
inclined that way now.  He thinks I violated my word on the first turn.
I tried to explain, but who knows if he accepted?  In any case, I

I had that problem in Ghodstoo. As England, I allied with Pitt Crandelmeier,
playing Germany, and we invaded France early and hard. I convoyed to
Belgium. That made him very nervous, so he stabbed me. I remember being very
disappointed that he hadn't instead told me, "I don't like your being in
Belgium, give it to me instead." I would have. (I think. :-))

Yeah. Actually, I want to be very careful not to be the 'leader' in this
particular game. Always a problem with Russia, and especially so in this
game I expect.

But I don't mind subduing Turkey very early if we can manage it.

Well, I am personally not convinced that there ism uch danger of an
entry by France into the Med anytime soon, but the point is well taken
that if France and England are too tight (tighter than I can make myself
with France) then we will have a problem, and I'm glad to know you're on
my side if this happens.

The way I see it, we choose between Austria and Turkey, and I grow
to be as friendly with France as possible in the meantime, while you do
the same with England.  Then, as you say, perhaps we help our respective
partners against each other, perhaps even feigning a war between you and I.
All too far in the future to say anything for sure, but my policy for now
will be to cultivate French friendship and subtly try to make sure that after
Germany is dispatched, his next target should be England (suggesting,
eventually, the possibility of contacting you, if he doesn't bring it up
first).

This is definitely possible (to be left without a build for a while).  As
long as my alliances are firm, I'm actually okay with that.  My philosophy
as Italy is three-fold -- patience, patience, patience.  Turkey has to break
out to succeed, but Italy has to sit back and wait for slow growth.

Understood.  My only chance for growth anytime soon is probably Trieste.
Dave has actually offered to loan it to me if I need it to build western
(I assume this offer is void if I show any anti-Austrian moves :-).  Anyway,
flanking it may not even be necessary.  It seems perhaps my fate in this
game is to always have a unit with nothing to do, so perhaps it will indeed
be this way.

As indicated, E/F partnership is fine as long as it doesn't last.  I will
also point out repeatedly the strong terms of the DMZ Hohn and I have set
up, and how good it has been to us, and how England is so scary, etc., etc.

I'm always open to the unexpected alliances and I especially love looking to

game summary in a couple of days.  Better you should have a chance to gather

So, which way are you leaning?

Here's my basic feeling. I really like the idea of being rid of Turkey
forever. On the other hand, I am not thrilled at having a fairly large
Austria with a gigantic army sitting on my flank. That's why I can't quite
decide.


On the bigger picture: what do you think about the idea of my building A
Stp in the winter and actually trying to take Norway? The idea is that just
my two or three units plus Germany's can stand off an E/F combination. So
maybe France gets frustrated and flips over to the Witch-elimination
approach. In the mean time, I have made a loyal friend of John.
Of course, the downside is that I have a very angry England and I don't
know quite what he'd do. And maybe I'm mistaken, maybe G/R can't really
hold off a concerted E/F.

I'm with you.  One thing to keep in mind is that Austria has offered me
Trieste for the asking.  Perhaps I can "ask" at a time that turns out to
be inopportune for him (assuming we do Turkey first).

Trouble is, even though we've played only a single move, and had only
but little in the way of press, I feel like whichever way we go (Austria
or Turkey) will see me betraying a trust, something I usually don't do
right off the bat.  I haven't promised not to Lepanto, but I've sure been
talking friendly.  As for Austria, we have a good and already honored
DMZ, which could extends to a center-loaning alliance.

I don't want a run for Scandinavia to be seen as an attack on E/F, when it
is just an attack on E.

Well, here's a possibility.  Talk long and hard with England about the
following type of thing.  You want in on the German party that he and
France seem to be having, but you want to cull German favor and surprise
him.  Offer to pass German intelligence to E/F.  So you tell him that you
would like to build A StP and attack Norway in SPRING 1902 (NOT costing him
a center), thus ensuring that Germany will tell you his most intimate
secrets.  Then, in the Fall, when Germany expects England to attack Norway
to take it back, you say that your true desire is a surprise convoy Nor-Den
using his North Sea fleet and your support from Sweden.

As for what you TRULY do that Fall, you (and Germany?) can decide.

Just an idea.  I guess with the pace of the game we have time to try these
kind of things.  And a tres chic tactic for a demo game, anyway.

I'm in a similar situation.
I even have a fairly 'neutral' move available, but if I do that one I'm
afraid they'll *both* see me as betraying a trust! And that's the one thing
we really don't want. On the other hand, there is a pretty good chance I
could get away with it... on the other hand (I have three), what's the
point, really? I'm certainly going to betray one of them, why not in '01?
Ugh.

Hm. Yeah, but he'd tell Cal, and then Cal would defend Norway.

Holy cow.
I don't think Cal is sufficiently credulous for that kind of thing.

I see Manus as sort of semi-committing to the attack on Germany, but quite
opportunistic enough to jump on England if it looks like he's got a good
chance to come out ahead.

The more obvious approach, slurping up a German center, has a couple of
drawbacks. First, it would leave England positioned to start convoying into
my territory, and not terribly well positioned to take on France (though
really England is practically always well positioned to take on France, I
guess). Second, of all the northerners I much prefer John as an ally. Well,
I'll figure that part out.

So how are we going to decide whether it's AIR or TIR? I think all the info
is in now. Shall we each consult our innermost heart and write down our
answers on slips of paper then exchange them? Shall we flip a coin and see
whether we are crestfallen when it comes up heads?

Hi new guy.

Quick recap:
in the opening, I agreed with Austria that we'd make Turkey our first
target. He (Cyrille) suggested some moves for me, I made them. Then he
stopped talking.

I'm sure you'll understand my situation: I feel that I have to reassess
everything now, but I certainly don't plan to penalize you for Cyrille's

Italy appears to be an abject coward, but you'll have to figure that stuff

I was gonna say that. :)

Listen, if Steve really will fly off the handle, I'm delighted. If he
suddenly turns from a fearsome opponent into a third-rate "I'm gonna get
you no matter what I do" player, I'm pretty confident that that would be an
advantage. Nothing so comfortable as an entirely predictable opponent. But
I personally think he's putting on a show. (For whom? I don't know.)

I've written to Dave, too. We'll have to see what develops. I'm inclined to
stick with the anti-A program, myself. We've got Steve kind of stuck now,

obviously not to his advantage.

I've played against him for years.  His best ability won't come into play

even if he has relatively few pieces (9 or less).  It's funny (and maddening

Even without your previous experience, this is a difficult alliance for
Austria.  However, I am a patient Turkey.  I am willing to concede you most
of the builds as you are assuming most of the risks.  As I said, I would be
willing to be very flexible in working to keep you as comfortable as

That's a good start.  I could point out more than another dozen tournament
victories, several top board finishes at DipCon, one meager postal win,
etc., but it's probably best to have the least rep.

These guys are pretty good.  Especially Hohn.

For me, I assume you mean Hohn.  I will make sure he knows his south is save
(since I want my west safe) and hopefully this will convince him he's safe
gobbline both German and English centers with your help.  Maybe it's time
we approach him about an F/I/R.

Still at a loss, and glad my moves for this turn are okay with everyone,
meaning I can put off the decision if you can.  No matter which way we lean,
I would be grateful if you could lobby Turkey against building F SMY, which
I imagine is in his plans given my Lepanto-esque opening.  So if you could
at least talk heavy "armies into Austria" to him, my fleets would feel better
about things.

Oh yeah, sorry.

Ok, so we actually have three options. We could try to stay neutral, or we
could go aggressively with AIR or aggressively with TIR.

I guess I'm leaning *away* from the neutral option. But that's the one you
are going  with, right? So I guess it's up to me.

ROTFL!  The story is just that my dad, James, thought "Manus" would be a good
name.  Turned out (to his pleasant surprise) that it's an old Irish name
anyway.  Strangeness in naming must run in the family.  My son is
McManus Jameson Hand ("son of Manus, son of James Hand").

Well, I guess you could put it that way.  I'm as gung ho for one as the
other, and at the moment, my moves are set for this phase and will work
whichever way we choose, so I have the luxury you may not have of being
able to wait another turn to see where the pieces land.

Hi there.

I hope you weren't thinking I'd just stopped talking (even though in a
sense I had). I was thinking it all over, and also I was trying to get a
sense of what Italy plans to do. His coming move will be noncommital, but I
believe he intends to carry through a Lepanto opening.

Therefore, I am prepared to make the bold move you suggested, viz.,
Rum-Bla, Ukr-Rum, Sev-Arm.

My alternative was Rum-Bla, Sev-Rum, Ukr S Sev-Rum. This has the advantage
of keeping Turkey in the dark about my plans. I liked that. But I would
have to tip my hand in the Winter anyway, by building A Sev. Steve would
know that if I were going to attack Austria I would build A War. Carrying
on a deception by building A War then attacking Turkey anyway would be
rather silly.

I was, as you know, also concerned that you might have a big plan with
Turkey as well as with me, and that you might decide there was more in it
for you if you got to build up a big land force and move into Moscow and
Warsaw. I'm still a little concerned about that. But I've convinced myself
that this would not be a very good plan for you, mainly because you would
have to expect Italy to help me. Even with the advantage of a tempo of
surprise, I think you would be committing yourself to a very long and
painful struggle, one which would allow a couple of northerners to
consolidate their positions and basically gain control of the game. So I
says to myself, would Dave do something like that? And I says, no, he
wouldn't, he thinks like me. So then I felt better.


So, in short, I'm on board. Boy is Steve gonna be mad.


If you want, we can talk about 1902, since it is pretty obvious what the
position will be after the coming move. It looks to me like you get the
first bite, and then I get the second, and poor Italy remains rather small,
having to wait for the crumby pickings at the end. We could do it
differently, but adopting your well-known approach of thinking about what's
best for the alliance as a whole, I think that's what we should do. Get you
into Bulgaria, then me into Ankara, and leave Italy to manouver in the
water and strike in '03.

CCC was the very first szine I joined.  I've been playing there for over
5 years now, although I'm sure we've never shared a game.  I've never been
able to go to a big tournament, just don't have the time, that's why I run
my own local con in Boston.  Diplomatic Incident IX is coming up March 7/8
as a matter of fact to I'll be getting my ftf fix.  I've done fairly well
at them, although Pitt Crandlemire ran me a bit ragged at the last one.

I've been trying to feel out what is going on with the rest of the players.
I'm fairly certain that Italy is going to go for the Lepanto, and I really
can't say anything to convince him otherwise without raising a lot of
suspicion.  I also think your call on Jamie is right.  He seems to be very
cautious and I think he's going to sit on things and see how they play out.
My reading is that he sees AI vs T and FE vs G and figures he can just stay
the odd man out and pick up things on the edges for a while.

Given that, and given that you are the logical power to be the naval half
of an alliance, I'm wondering about this years moves.  Attacking Russia
if he's going to sit on the fence while Italy is coming your way doesn't
seem to make a lot of sense.  What do you think Jamie would do if he
saw AT working together against Italy?  I have to think he'd head our
way, but I think we could cover it for long enough to give us some room.

Let's assume that you make the expected move to Aegean this year.  Jamie
will be building in the north as Sev is occuppied, and you can make the
"obvious" build of F Smy while continuing to maintain cordial relations
with him.  I build two armies (no surprise) and everything looks fine to
him.  Then, in 1902, I suggest to Italy that I support him to Aegean,
guessing that you will go for EAS.  Instead, I move to Tyr, support you
to Ionian and move to Gal (Bud is safe as he has a fleet in Rum), you
move to EAS to keep the retreating Italians out, and move Ank to Arm
where it can cut support.  You can take Rum guaranteed (Arm - Sev,
Gal - Ukr, Ser s Bul - Rum) and I can take Ven (Gre or Ion can cut any
support from the retreating fleet).  With EF and G tied up, taking out
Russia is just a matter of time, and getting the jump on Italy and out
into the Med before France can lock it up seems more important.

What do you think?

Yes indeed, just no mail access over the weekend!  I received your last
note and will be happy to support your army Ukr to Rum.  I agree with
you on your assessment of Italy, he'll be slow and cautious, but will
most likely go with the Lepanto.  It's harder to say what Turkey will
do.  I've been less than encouraging, so as to keep him inclined to
move that fleet out to Aegean and not back towards Black.  I hope you've
maintained good relations with him.

No one else seems to have anything of note to say, so guess I'll try to
remember how to send in orders and get this thing on the road.

Cal,

Hard to believe, but we may actually see a move in this game.  I believe
the deadline is tomorrow night.

I was looking things over and I had a thought you might find of
interest.  I am fairly secure against France, what with Russia and Italy
turning elsewhere.  So you and I could take some strong action in the
north without much worry about losing ground.

For instance, if I were to bounce Russia out of Sweden, while you
convoyed Yor-Norway, and ordered Nwg-Bar, Russia would be just about
helpless to defend the north.  France would not have much to do except
perhaps enter the Med against Italy, which I would be all for.

What do you think?

Hohn,

I have been solicited to join in a strong anti-Russia campaign.  If I
could be reassured of our commitment to cooperate, I think I would go
for it.  That is, I would like your explicit commitment that you will
not order bur-ruh.  As I recall, you have said bur would do "something
else."  That's plenty of info for me if I just sit tight, but not if I
want to join the Anti-R coalition.

I am supposed to bounce Russia out of Sweden and then move on Warsaw in
the following year.  My plan now is to hold in Munich, as we agreed,
take Holland (assuming E does not bounce me out) and hold in Denmark.
If all goes well on the western front, I will send at least one army,
perhaps two, against Russia in the Spring.

Have you heard any discussion of this?  I'm worried that someone is
jerking me around.  In any case, how does this fit with your designs?
Would you prefer that I go for it or that I don't?

Manus,

I have no real problem with your proposal, save to say that I will
probably need to have two fleets at _some_ point (not necessarily
immediately), just for my own defensive concerns.  Where do you
suggest I park them, if only one of SPA/MID is permissible?

I'd also like to propose an amendment on your end, that only one fleet
be allowed in TYS, TUN or TUS.  I find it unlikely that you'd want to
park a fleet in TUS in any event, but hey, since we're being anal
about things, I figured what the heck. ;-)

Sorry for my silence so far, by the way; I've been swamped at work.

You're an old hand.

I can see pretty clearly what's going to have to happen next year, I think.
It looks pretty cut and dried, unless Italy plans some kind of trick.
By the way, if all goes according to plan, I'll build A Stp this winter.
But I don't know what actions I'll take in the north, if any.

My only real concern is that Turkey might move to Bla and bounce you.  I've
been deliberately wishy-washy so as not to give an impression of a good
ally and hope that along with your own hopefully good relations that we'll

I don't expect too much trickery out of Italy,  He is planning on moving
to Ven, but as long as he builds a fleet in Naples then I don't see any
problems.

I am onboard with everything that you said and I believe that it is exactly

Dear Tsar Jamie,
I dunno if I ever got back to you.  I think so.  I am so sick right now, I

Go ahead and disparage me all you want in the press!  The new Austrian may
be a bit more pliable.  I don't think he's looking to attack you (yet), but
has indicated a willingness to do so next turn.  However, he does seem to be
leaning toward a move into Gal.  Don't know what I can say to talk him out
of that without sounding like I'm in your pocket.

All the best,

you'll need more than my flexing one tiny muscle in the general vicinity. I

My southern flank is looking good, but that could change rapidly if France

I'll build armies in the far north and south. And I'm certain Italy will
build F Nap. Any bets on what Turkey will build? If he's consumed with
anti-Romanoff rage he'll build F Ank. But that would be a weak build. Hm. I

I like the way the North is shaping up, too. France isn't committing, and

I have my doubts.  He tried hard to get me to bounce John out of Holland and
I refused, citing a desire for a good start in this game.  I suspected,
based on how Hohn played/reacted last game that this would bother him no
end.  Therefore, I wouldn't be surprised if he has reconciled with Germany
and I'm about to get hit.

John tried really hard to get me to attack YOU this turn (Me: Army to
Norway; Him: Fleet to Sweden).  I refused by simply ignoring the letter
(only got it yesterday), but I'm pretty sure he was trying to deke me north
so he and Hohn could attack.  It sure feels like Hohn's handiwork...

I was waiting for you to do that after his snarky press during the wait for

Hmmm, let's see now.  First, John tries to get me to drop the attack on you
that he has so stridently urged on me and asks me to move north in force
against the Russian...

And then you come up with this Freudian (?) slip:

"France: Army Burgundy SUPPORT Turkish Army Ankara -> Belgium."

Now, I sez to myself, "Self?  Doesn't this have all the earmarks of a
Hohn-led Franco-German alliance?  Given that Hohn didn't like me NOT
committing myself to an attack on Holland, isn't an F/G reconciliation the
most logical thing for him to do, given the clever yet mistrusting player
that he is?  And wouldn't it be a subtle move for him to get John to try to
maneuver me out of position and make me easy pickings from the south?"

And self answers "Yup."

Hi Manus!  Looks like Turkey may be easy pickings after all.  I just wonder
if you won't find it completely covered in Russian armies by the time you
get there?

Should you entertain any thoughts of turning westward towards "certain
coasts", I think I can be there to back you up...

Cal,

BUR S ANK-BEL was a _joke_.  I thought it had more class than BUR
HOLDS, which is boring.

You were uncontested.  What's the big deal?

As for builds, I intend to build A PAR, F MAR.  Since we've decided to
play the "fence sitting" game I so desperately wanted to avoid, I
figured I'd maintain some flexibility while simultaneously refraining
>from tipping John off.  Then we can hit him with surprise in Spring.

I don't know why you're suddenly so nervous; you have your two builds,
I did exactly what I said I would, and we're following a strategic
course which was dictated by _you_.  In fact, I must confess
substantial distress at your apparent change of heart.  The
nervousness I detect is precisely why I wanted our alliance against
John open and declared, last turn.

I remain committed to the alliance.  However, in light of your
apparent second thoughts, I must request that _you_ build F EDI, and
an army in either LVP or LON.  A fleet in LON or LVP would make me
extremely nervous right now, and I'd have to move defensively.

Please let me know your thoughts.  Thanks.

Hohn

Manus,

Pursuant to our treaty, I request permission to build F MAR.  I will
park my two fleets in SPA(sc) and POR, I suspect.  The problem is, I'm
stuck with respect to builds.  Two armies will antagonize John, badly
and too early.  I don't want to do that right now.  A fleet in BRE
will antagonize Cal, badly.  Thus, my quandary.  I hope you know that
I realize it is folly for France to attack Italy at this stage in the
game, especially with my fleet in POR as it is.

Please let me know if you will allow the build.  I would greatly
appreciate it, and to demonstrate my gratitude, I am still willing to
support you into MUN, should you so desire it.

Hohn

Wish I had more time to discuss this, but I have tyo head off to work.

In short, I remain committed to the alliance (ie no second thoughts) and I
agree that the season played out exactly as I requested.  Full marks to you
for that.  It was just that John's request to move north didn't seem to make
a whole lot of sense given the opening tiff with you in Burgandy and, had I
been in your position, it's what I might have tried if I decided to go
against England.

As for the builds, I have no problem with a Fleet in Edi.  If I change my
mind, I promise I will discuss it over with you first.  Fair enough?

Hurriedly yours,

King Kal

I concur.  And, I can promise you that I will not challenge you for
supremacy in the Med (duh!).  Jamie really took care of that, didn't he?  My
position looks to be pretty hopeless.  England won't be much of a
distraction, Germany's of no value, Austria may be Russia's #1 guy, so that
leaves you.

I may be reading the board wrong (done it before), but I believe Dave's
going to go after you sooner rather than later.  You ought to at least
consider building an army.  It'll be pretty ugly if Austria moves to Tyl
this turn.  With no friction in Gal, he's got armies to burn.  I'd love to

That's just smoke. Sound and fury.

I think you ought to move the army to Tyrolia. I don't know what's going to
happen up there, but I think you're going to want to be able to have some
effect. It could help keep Austria honest, too.

I had this thought last night, that I should build two fleets, because
Russia never does that.

Then I thought a little more and remembered why Russia never does that.

I agree he was probably trying to deke you north (great expression), but I

Yeah.

I don't see how I could be too much help, though. Maybe in 1903 I could.

I've suggested to Manus that his extra army belongs in Tyrolia. If there's
really an F/G alliance that won't be too helpful to you, but every little
thing counts.

Interesting situation.

It's a very balanced game. Sure, Turkey is looking pretty awful, but
besides him everyone has chances. Manus got just one build but has no
enemies. (That I know of! You might have a different idea!) I have six
units but a growing and dangerous Austria.

Ideally, I'd like to take my gains in the south and stay out of the
northern mess for at least another year. But various things you might do
would make that difficult. I don't expect you're going to tell me your
plan. Let's see, hmmm. Do you have any advice for me?

That's very useful information, thanks. (It might very well mean he's

Let's try to make a definite plan with Dave about how to execute Turkey.
What I don't want to see is a situation in which it just so happens that
the most efficient way to dispatch the Ottoman's is for Austria to keep
gobbling up the centers. Maybe you could get Greece when Dave takes
Bulgaria. I'd feel much better about that. I'll be quite worried if he
finishes '02 with six units and you with four.

Hello, and welcome to Winter!

I am writing for two reasons.  First, I want to re-open discussions on
me moving to Tyrolia.  France reiterated his offer of support into Munich,
and if France does start treating me poorly, it would be nice to extend
my front against him north, to own something along the Maginot line.
I have nothing against Germany, though, so I am very undecided about
everything.

Second, how would you feel about me taking Greece as you slide out?  I
would frankly feel better if I was involved in this kind of way (not
that I expect any coming disparity in our sizes should have any bad
effect on our relationship or anything).

I also recall your offer of a loan of Trieste.  If I go to Tyrolia and
take Greece from you, I can virtually guarantee that Turkey will confide
in me (and I, of course, confide in you).  If we want to extend that
situation (and if there are sufficient units), you could wrest Greece
back from me (how sad that I retreat to AEG!) while I (if I can't decide
about Munich, or if German survival is something we wish to promote) steal
Trieste, making us look for all the world like we're at each other's throats.

I guess I see my position at the moment as the possible inside man with
Turkey.  He has already sent me private press that makes it certain I
can indeed occupy that role.

Not to worry -- I am keeping an eye on France........

That's fine.  As you can see, I did what I said I would do anyway.

For now, let's stick with the plan we'd talked about: you build F KIE
A BER, and I build A PAR F ???.  Once we establish those builds, we
can move on from there.

Just so we're clear, my understanding of our agreement is that if you
build an army in KIE, or if I build two armies, we're at war.
Obviously, I hope that won't be the case.

Thoughts?

I'm _not_ totally comfortable with it.  But I also know that between
us, we can boot it out whenever we want.

And if we _do_ want to boot it out, that would make the build of F KIE

You and me both.  I have already written Dave mentioning the "I take Greece
as you slide out" and pushing the fact that I can use this to perhaps prove
anti-A intentions to Turkey.  If you could independently broach the same
subject (an Italian Greece), that would be good.

Things will have broken one way or the other by then, I think.  I THINK I'm
still in the position of being able to pick between Hohn & John, but the
builds will tell.  Given a choice, I'd sooner attack France as that would
set Germany up as a victim of choice for you and to combine on, but we'll
see how it shakes out.  As I said, I should still have options.

That's a very interesting question.  France says if I build two armies,
we are at war.  Are you ready to take him on?  Because if you want to go
north,  a fleet would help take Scandinavia, and I would probably not
have France to contend with, because my build would indicate peaceful
intentions toward him.  By the same token, if you are not ready to take
on France, then if I build two armies, I'll be facing him anyway.  So
again, building a fleet is the wise course, so I have some chance of not
facing France's attack.

I also understand that a German fleet looks quite dangerous to England.
So if I build one, perhaps you and I would be at war.  So no matter what
I do, I antagonize you or France.  And my actions are seen as a blatant
threat to one or the other of you, which would make it much easier for
the two of you to ally against me.

No one said playing Germany would be easy, I guess.

How about this: if you build F Liverpool, I'll build two armies, and
then we all know what's up.

Okay, it's later (<:.  I'm getting some pretty weird signals from
Italy.  Not having played with Manus before I don't know if this
is just his style or what, but his proposals this turn included
his moving to Tyrolia, then attacking Munich with French support
(this has apparently been offerred).  Then there were the ideas
of his sliding into Trieste and/or Greece in order that we would
appear to be at odds so he could be the "inside man" in regards
to Turkey.  Seems to me that with the three of us working together,
there's no need for any such shenanigans, we can just take out
Turkey by brute force.  There's no way he's going to build a
fleet in Smy, so we should be able to force Aegean.  My only
concern now is that I'm not certain I want to see Italy in both
Ionian and Aegean.   Makes me worry about Greece!  I've let him
know that I'd like to take a much straighter line, maybe you
can work on him a bit and stress the dangers of an E/F.  Anyway,
I don't think that a fleet build this year would be a good idea.
First, I want the army in case of Italian treachery, and
secondly it might just boost him over the edge if he is considering
turning on me.

I really can't see a fleet build with what he's facing.  My best
guess might be an army in Ank.  He can use fleet Aegean to cover
Smyrna and work on breaking up the AIR.

Yes, noticed his sit back approach.  On the other hand, there is
some committment in his not contesting Belgium.  It'll be interesting
to see what happens this spring.

How do you think we should go about the Turkish attack?  If you
are going to build an army in Sev, then one idea is for you to
move Arm - Syr, Sev - Arm.  That does leave you very wide open
in the middle though.  Given their non-committal moves, do you
think there is a chance we'll be facing a western triple?  I'd
lobby hard for a German fleet build in Kiel if I were you.  Even
then, a slide from Munich to Sil would be rather threatening.
Just something to keep an eye on.

If I can trust Italy, then it would seem the obvious attack is
Ser - Bul, Rum s Ser - Bul, Bla - Con, Ion - Aeg, Gre s Ion - Aeg.
That would guarantee the destruction of Bul.  Arm can go just
about anywhere.  Syr if you want to commit Sev to the Turkish
war, otherwise probably Smyrna.  With my army Bul in the fall
we should be able to guarantee that you take a center.

Italy is sounding rather wishy washy to me, so I'd really like
to Blitzkrieg Turkey here and cement a solid alliance between
you and I.  Any suggestions for the north?  Do you think I should
move up to Boh?  I could potentially support Germany from there,
or attack if he heads your way for some reason.

Well, that's enough trying to guess what's going to happen for
now.  I'm looking forward to your ideas on things, particularly
your feel on what Italy is going to do.

Regards,

Dave von BeirMeister.

Hi Manus,

Thanks for the note.  I still don't have a problem with you
moving to Tyrolia, assuming of course that you build a fleet
in Naples.  Another army in Rome would probably start to concern
me.  I'm still not sure about attacking Munich though, if the
E/F does firm up then helping knock down Germany is probably not
a good idea.  On the other hand if we can form a solid AIR, then
we may just want to go for whatever we can get.  I still think
that a slide into Pie might be a better move for the fall.

As far as sliding into Greece goes, it seems to me that that
would be rather counter-productive.  First of all, I'm not
going to be able to move out on my own, there is a Turkish
fleet in Aegean!  I'd much rather have us go for a classic
Lepanto attack on Turkey.  A fleet build in Smy is highly
unlikely, it would leave Ank wide open, so we should have no
problem supporting you into Aegean.  With the E/F threatening,
the best thing for us is to quickly eliminate Turkey so we
can turn to the west.  I'd like to see you involved in that
attack for a number of reasons.  First of all, it is a source
of centers for you and we need you to build more fleets to keep
France at bay.  Secondly, I'd like to get your army ashore there
so that when Turkey is gone we have more force in place to keep
Russia from getting ambitious.

While your offerring of being the inside man versus Turkey would
be useful in many circumstances, in this case I think we can
just take the brute force approach with Russia working with us
for the moment.  Subterfuge is fun, but passing over two centers
when it's not needed reminds me a bit of what we call a practice
finesse in bridge.

I think in this game of sharks that there's a lot of incentive
for us to have a firm alliance.  A good AI is one of the best
setups there is, but it's strength is in it's position and
we just need to have solid tactics and stick by each other, not
try and get too tricky.

Hope you're amenable to a more straight forward approach.

Look forward to hearing from you.

Regards,
Dave

The word on the street is that France will build two fleets.

So I wouldn't count on being able to choose your ally.

Hm, but I think you'd also be in pretty good shape if Germany were the
first out. Although you and I wouldn't be able to combine against France, I
could probably arrange things so that Italy was available at the right
moment, if you see what I mean.

It's all the same to me, frankly.

I think I have to concentrate on Austria, (a) keep him on the 'right side',
and (b) watch to make sure he doesn't get too big for me to handle.

Hi Steve,

Sorry about that.  I really was being honest about my intentions at the
beginning.  Then Jamie rather dramatically jumped off the fence and that
changed things a bit.  With him willing to commit so completely, the
difficulties of an A/T became a bit harder to ignore.  That doesn't
mean that I'm committed to seeing you wiped out, just that I couldn't
see passing up the opportunity to make sure Russia was pointed elsewhere.
I'm always open to ideas so let's keep talking.

My read of Italy was not the same as yours, but I'll have to reconsider,
maybe you're correct.

The Ven-Tyo move I suggested to him myself. My apologies if it's given you
a headache.
I did not suggest that Manus take Munich, though. My thinking was that
Italian influence should be used to 'stabilize' the north, preventing any
two-on-one coaltion from succeeding too quickly in eliminating the lone
defender. Of course, my small northern contingent could be coordinated. So,
for instance, if Germany is the odd man out, presumably two Russian units
plus one Italian unit plus five German units can hold out against whatever
force E/F could put together. Or, if Hohn switches sides, some harassment
of Germany, just a little, would make an invasion of England very difficult.

But if you don't want the army in Tyrolia, that's cool.

Italy's suggestion about taking Greece or Tri is his own, but he did
mention it to me. My understanding was that he felt that you were going to
be getting something from Turkey right away and Italy wouldn't, so he'd
take something from you to equalize your alliance at 5-5, rather than 6-4.

My conclusions:

1) I didn't think these two suggestions were especially suspicious or
threatening;
2) It's completely up to you whether to go along, I'm not *supporting*
Italy's requests or anything like that;
3) The point about Italy's being the 'inside man' with Turkey does sound
somewhat implausible, and I agree with you that it's totally unnecessary
and we should go with the straightforward approach.


Next, about your construction plans:

>First, I want the army in case of Italian treachery, and
>secondly it might just boost him over the edge if he is considering
>turning on me.

So you're thinking that A Tri is better defensively against Italy, but F
Tri is better offensively. Is that right? I'm not sure that's true.

I'll tell you why I like the fleet build (just personally, from my own
perspective). We'll hobble Turkey this year and finish him in '03. If you
have just the one fleet then, you'll have a rather large number of armies
awfully near my border. I trust you, but I don't want your temptations to
grow too large!

I'm not saying, by the way, that the only acceptable option from my
perspective is for you to attack Italy after Turkey is on the ropes. You
and I could attack Germany together, my fleets your armies. But you
wouldn't need a huge land force for that. And ultimately you're going to be
fighting Italy or me, and I'd really like to see you with some significant
naval power so you'll have a real choice when it comes down to it.

You go ahead and allay my worries, then build an army.

And by the way, you should voice any similar or parallel concerns you have
about my forces. I do plan to build a northern fleet as soon as it's
realistic. (The only reason I don't plan to do it now is that I have to
side with either England or Germany when I build a fleet, and I don't want
to do that this season.)

On the Turkish attack:
I see it about the same way you do. I think I like the really
straightforward approach, where I cut Con S Bul and you take Bul, then you
help me into Ank in the Fall. That's a sure two centers between us, and
it's tremendously unlikely that we could do better than that. And
destroying the A Bul also looks to be the best approach. But let me do a
little analysis and get back to you.

We could just do it this way:
Bla S Arm-Ank
Rum S Ser-Bul
Gre S Ion-Aeg

So either Bul falls or Ank does, and we get the other in the Fall.

I do think I'll leave my A Sev back, because of that 'weak in the middle'
problem. It's not that I think there's an FEG, but I do think we might see
F vs. E and then Germany might decide it's a good time to march east while
his other neighbors are occupied. Probably not, but what a disaster if he
did and I had nothing to cover Warsaw.

On a similar note, I'm thinking maybe I'll build in Moscow rather than Stp.
The mere possibility of Mos-Stp *should* keep England from trying to slip
into Stp, and also the possibility of Mos-War *ought* to keep Germany from
trying anything cute.

Back to the main issue:

>If I can trust Italy, then it would seem the obvious attack is
>Ser - Bul, Rum s Ser - Bul, Bla - Con, Ion - Aeg, Gre s Ion - Aeg.

Yeah, that's fine too. The only advantage my way has is that if Turkey
decided to try to save the A Bul from being destroyed by supporting himself
Bul-Con and moving Con-Smy, we might just possibly get both Ank and Bul.
But that's a long shot.


>Italy is sounding rather wishy washy to me, so I'd really like

I agree.

And there's always the chance that France will launch some movement into
the Med, leaving us without Italian help.

Huh. That hadn't occurred to me (and I didn't notice that comment when I
first read the note).

I don't know. I can't see any down side, so I guess you may as well do it.

Hello down there.  Well I see that Dave is claiming me as part of a
tripatrite alliance against you.  Hmmm.  I freely admit that I am
being heavily lobbied to join A/R, but I have made no committments.
I just wanted you to know that I will only join their party, and then
reluctantly, if it becomes clear that you cannot survive.  In the meantime,
I will at least be giving Austria something to think about, while gathering
>from A/R some intelligence that...well, just might find its way into
Turkish hands.

Frankly, the Russian attack on you -- especially coupled with the
Austrian assistance -- came as a complete (and rather unpleasant)
shock to me.  I was kept out of all discussions.  Russia, up until
the last minute, was mailing me about how he could not decide what
to do, leaning toward a non-commital move.  If I'm going to be dragged
into in an A/I/R (no offense), I would like the "I" part of the alliance
to mean something and have some hope of survival.

How are you doing drumming up support from elsewhere (England, Germany)?

I think that is best as far as the attack goes and would like to just
support your fleet to Aegean.  However, I understand that without planning
any treachary you may be concerned about the imbalance in our relative
center count and I don't want to have you uncomfortable.  First off, I
guarantee you Turkish centers.  Secondly, I can send an army to Boh and
use that to support you to Munich if you'd like?

As far as the builds go, what do you think would be best.  Obviously I will
build an army in Vie, but what should I build in Tri?  When (note, when,
not if!) it comes to war with France, having a mixture of fleets can be
useful as it allows the use of the "forward retreat".  At this point, I'm
really interested in maitaining a three way alliance with AIR and I don't
want to disturb either of you as I'm concerned about the west.  A mass
of Austrian armies might concern Jamie unduly, a fleet might concern you,
so I'm openly asking for opinions from both of you.  What do you think?

Dave

Put up or shut up, eh?  :)  Well, I had hoped to hide my intentions from
Hohn for another season and strike in S02, but I can't afford to take the
chance that you decide to work with him.  Therefore, I am willing to build F
Lpl in return for your promise to build a couple of armies.  As you say,
then we'll "all know what's up".

As I said last turn, I have decided to throw my lot in with you and let
things lie where they fall.  I certainly don't want to get into the war that
would follow if you were to build a fleet(s).  We'll see if that works out
in my favour or not but the decision is made.  At least I've been willing to
put my cards on the table.  Fair enough?

As for the northern sphere, I agree that we will have to deal with Russia as
soon as France has been reduced or eliminated.  Gentle Tsar Jamie is in FAR
too good a position now to be ignored for more than a year or two.  I just
prefer to deal with the West first.  Actually, that's one of the reasons why
I decided to work with you instead of Hohn as you would be a much more
effective partner in the inevitable fight against Russia.  That's one of the
virtues of the E/G alliance.

So, what do you think?  I'm in this for better or worse.  Wot say you?

Briefly, as I have to go to work.  Russia and Austria get at least one each
this year.  The best you could hope for is Smy.  They can deny that to you

problems.  England may be a distraction to Russia.

I'm really not sure what to think about Italy.  Overall I don't think
he's necessarily planning a stab.  Just Greece or Trieste isn't too bad
and I understand his concern about imbalance (actually, since you will
be at 7, how about I give him Trieste and take one from you, say
Warsaw? (<:.  Just kidding about Warsaw, and while it would be nice to
have that balance, I think getting you another build for the north is
very important), however, he actually suggested doing both!  Maybe he
was just testing to see how gullible I am?

My concern with Tyrolia is where it leaves for me to go?  If you and
Italy are propping up Germany as you suggested, just what are all those
Austrian armies in the middle going to be doing?  I don't want us to
embark down a road that is going to force us into a fight, we may
want to keep the AIR alive a bit longer.  That's why I'd rather see
Italy getting a center or two from Turkey and concentrating to the
east.  I have more than enough units to prop up Germany in the center.

No, actually I think the army is better for both.  But I also think the
majority of Italy's are programmed to see an Austrian build of a fleet
as a threat.  Thus I get better defense/offense and keep the Italian
happy.  I get to eat the cake too!

Okay, Allay #1:  I'm much to unsure of Italy to turn my back on him and
attack you.  Allay #2:  When looking for a long term ally in this game
you are displaying the qualities I look for, Italy is displaying the
qualities that make me reach for my sword (<:.  Allay #3.  Were I
planning on attacking you, I'd actually do it this turn.  I'd have
kept my mouth shut about your build in Sev not being so safe and then
would have moved into Gal from Vie and gone into Rum with Turkish
support.  War and Rum would be mine this year.  Not going to happen!

The build in Sev would have concerned me a little as it was a large
concentration in the south, however not overly as it would have been
useful against Turkey.  I think Mos is a much better build though.
Your reasoning in the north is excellent and I fully endorse it.

I think I like the first proposal better (the one that guarantees Rum)
as it gives us a chance to give Italy a center if we want, or at least
to promise him one (<:.

I think we've got the makings of a fine alliance here.  We both seem to
take the long term approach and I think your natural caution will well
temper my natural overexuberance, leading to a very well balanced
strategy.  If we can keep the western pot boiling for a year or two
this could go rather well!

Right. This is what I hate about playing Russia. You *have* to grow faster
than your allies, because you are always playing in two separate spheres.
But this always makes allies nervous, reasonably so. That's a reason for
concentrating on one sphere, you (I) can do ok without getting too huge to
be trusted.

Are you sure he suggested that? It's crazy.

Yes, that's a point. Well, you could go to Boh, as you suggested earlier.
Then you could order Tri-Vie, Boh-Vie and protect against an Italian stab,
too.

Uh.
My plan was to build in Mos and Sev.
I take it you don't like that?

Listen, I pretty much have to build in Sev, I think. The obvious plan is
Sev and Stp, but I was thinking Sev and Mos would prevent Germany from
thinking east. I would be willing to go back to the Sev and Stp plan if
you're concerned. I can still order Stp-Mos in the Spring and be able to
cover War if Germany moves Ber-Pru or something ugly like that. But speak
up fast, the orders get processed tonight and I currently have B A MOS, B A
SEV.


(My plan)
>>Bla S Arm-Ank
>>Rum S Ser-Bul
>>Gre S Ion-Aeg

(Your plan)
>>>Ser - Bul, Rum s Ser - Bul, Bla - Con, Ion - Aeg, Gre s Ion - Aeg.

>I think I like the first proposal better (the one that guarantees Rum)

(I assume the 'first' plan is yours.)
Guarantees Rum, does it? What kind of a slip was that, exactly??

Ok, I'll pretend you said 'Bul'.

But let's see. If we just get you into Bul, can we really guarantee Italy a
center? I guess we can if Turkey hasn't built F Ank. We could do Bla S
Aeg-Con, Bul S Aeg-Con, Arm-Ank. But if he has F Ank that's no good. We'd
still have a perfectly good move (Bul S Aeg-Con, Bla S Arm-Ank) but no
guarantee for Italy.

That's ok, I'm not sure we want to guarantee anything for Italy. And if we
are *able* to do it, he might insist. Whereas if we aren't able, he can't
insist.

Well, it's no big deal, I think your plan is just as good for me anyway,
except if Turkey makes a bad move, which would be a silly thing to plan for.

Righto.
My gut instinct is that it will be boiling. I think Hohn is working as hard
as he can to get it settled, but neither Cal nor John can be easily
manipulated. What I like about the northern situation is that Hohn isn't
likely to settle for any arrangement that doesn't leave him in the lead,
and the others aren't likely to accept any deal with Hohn that doesn't
provide at least equality. Those factors should lead to a slowish
progression. If it comes up E/G vs F, that will be a long hard road for the
AngloSaxons and we ought to be able to take care of business before anyone
comes crashing into our sphere.

Hey, has Steve been talking to you? Understandably he told me not to bother
writing to him, and I haven't, but he doesn't seem like the sort to roll
over. If not to you, is he talking to Manus?

Doge,

Has Steve been writing to you? If not, I bet he's lobbying Dave pretty
hard. He isn't the roll-over-and-die type, do you think?

Also:
Dave thinks (or at least says he thinks) that you are asking him for both
Gre and Tri. Say it ain't so! It's making him nervous (or at least he says
so).
He offerred to move Vie-Boh if Germany needs some 'balancing'. I guess
that's good.

And Dave and I have been putting together a plan to annihilate Turkey. It's
an obvious one. I'd help him into Bul from Ser in the Spring, and he'd help
me into Ank by Bul-Con cutting support, in the Fall. And he'd support
Ion-Aeg in the Spring too. The Ser-Bul move destroys the Turkish A Bul, and
we leave Turkey with two units next year. Your center doesn't come until
then. As I said, I prefer to see you get one, but I don't see how to do it.
Unless it's Gre or Tri.

We're negotiating my build. I'd like to build in Sev and Mos. He thinks
this might be too much concentration too close to him. But I think it's a
good move. I'm looking at the board and seeing my middle very wide open to
a possible German drang nach osten, so I thought A Mos would make that less
attractive to John. And since I have no particular desire to go right for
Norway, it's no disadvantage over A Stp since I can just order Mos-Stp in
the Spring if John still seems friendly.

Dave will build two armies, as you probably know.

Manus,

Here's something I just noticed. I had thought the movement deadlines were
going to be a week after the previous phase, but in fact Rick has set
things up so that the adjustments fall on Fridays and the movement phase
always falls on Tuesday. So we aren't going to have very long to decide on
moves after we see the builds. So start thinking, and especially if you
have an alternative plan to the one I outlined a short while ago, tell me
pretty fast. I mean, soon, you don't have to tell me fast, I get confused
when you do that.

Hi Manus,

Sorry if I misread it.  Unfortunately I've already tossed the message.  I
read it as you'd like one or the other and if we did both that would really
work well to convince Turkey we were at odds.  Did seem just a touch
meglomanic to me (<:.  No harm done though.  I'm still firm on wanting
to keep AIR together and wipe out Turkey.  Then I think we coordinate
to keep the west boiling and maybe even hit them with a three prong
attack.

Any thoughts on that Trieste build?

Sorry for the misunderstanding.  As for your build, I'd prefer an army,
and Jamie says he is under the impression that's what it would be.  I'll
drop F NAP and head for Tyr, so you can help me into Munich from Boh.
At least that's my working plan.

Jamie sent me an outline of the Turkish attack, and it sounds good to
me as long as I don't get left too far behind.  But if we avoid any
misunderstandings like I caused, we should all stay happy.

No more time to write right now.  :-(

That's okay, I understand things like that.  As I mentioned at the beginning,

No, I was typing too much too fast.  I meant to say that the build in
Sev DOES (not WOULD) worry me some, for the above reasons, but I'm okay
with it as I assume you will be with my army in Trieste.  Accomodations
must me made (<:.  Please go ahead with Sev and Mos.  I am going with two
armies.  Manus has said that he prefers the army build, as do I for previously
mentioned reasons.

We actually don't need to decide this now.  Let's wait and see what he

He sent me two notes.  The first was, let's go get the Russian.  The second
was, "Hey wait a minute, why aren't you in Gal, what are you doing supporting
Russia to Rum."   I sent back a note designed to keep the lines open and
see if he had anything he wanted to propose.  Haven't heard anything back.

Building in Mos and Sev: ok, good.

>We actually don't need to decide this now.  Let's wait and see what he

Ok.
However, here's something I just noticed. The movement deadline will be
Tuesday night. When Rick said the moves would be a week each, he meant
including the minor phases. Movement deadlines will always fall on a
Tuesday, adjustments always on a Friday, so we'll really have only a couple
of (week)days of diplomacy for Spring movement phases. (For the Fall it
will be longer since Retreats are on Thursdays and there won't be an
Adjustment phase.) So we should move the negotiation process along.

As I said, I don't mind using your plan, it all comes out about the same
either way. What could cause trouble is if Italy has an alternative plan.
We might be in a rush if he comes up with one, say, late on Monday.

Aha.
So then I suppose he decided that Italy was his only friend, that he wants
to tip things in favor of Italy and against us. That doesn't worry me much.

So anyway, we seem to be more or less on the same wavelength and ready to
proceed. The most interesting thing to me that will emerge from the
adjustments is the French builds. But that will only affect my northern
plans and I should be able to decide how to react to French builds very
quickly.

I saw this too late to do anything about it.  I slept all day yesterday
thanx to this @%&*@ cold and by the time I got up today, the results were
already out.

Regardless, I don't think I would have gone along with it.  I'm not big on
Western Triples (which is what this would have turned into) and I don't
think we should let Hohn up off the carpet if we can get him down.

I'll write again when I've had a chance to really look at the moves.

The last note I had from him said that he did not think he had any problems
with the straightforward approach I was proposing.  He has committed to
building in Nap and I expect his moves to be Ion - Adr, Nap - Ion, Ven - Tyr.
Which way we do the attack should not be affected by that.

Right now I think we are planning on:

Ser - Bul, Gre s Ion - Aeg
Rum s Ser - Bul, Bla - Con, Arm - Ank/Smy

If he builds a fleet in Ank, then I think I might favor Arm - Ank, Bla s
Arm - Ank as it will have no where to retreat and can be destroyed.  If
he builds an army there as I expect, then forcing him out has no great
benefit, although he does have to cover Smyrna to keep you from sliding in.
Maybe there is a benefit to your approach.  We can guarantee to take Bul
in the Fall no matter what happens in the spring.  Let's see, you kick the
army out of Ank, if he covered Smy with Aeg, then it is destroyed, else,
it falls back to Smy and Aeg retreats to Eas, unless of course he attacks
Greece with Bul to cut support.  Then, the fall turn goes:

Ank - Con, Bla s Ank - Con, Ser - Bul, Rum s Ser - Bul, Ion - Aegean
and we've got two centers.

Okay, you've (I've) convinced me.  Let's go with your plan.  I'll think
about it on the weekend (maybe, I'll be playing face to face all weekend
and may end up brain fried!) and we'll touch base on Monday.

Have a good weekend.
