Oh, well, I'm going to bed very soon. But ok!

Well, I figure it would be quite easy, *if* you can get any inside info. If
you can't, maybe the very same tricks work, only I wouldn't be able to get
an Austrian center.

If, for example, Dave won't cover Trieste, then you can order Ion-Gre and
Nap-Apu! You'll take Venice in the Fall. I should be able to capture
Serbia, I expect, or Tri, even without a tip from you. That leaves Dave
with just Munich (maybe! I don't know whether Cal will continue to let him
have it, I figure he will) plus two others. You would have seven. Ok, let's
face it, eight, because he'll support you into Smyrna and I won't defend
it. (But maybe you'll wait? Because you'll only have two spots to build in.)

If he does plan to cover Tri, I can order Bud-Tri and keep him out.

In the mean time, I think I will lose two northern centers to Cal. So even
if I do get the Austrian center, I go down one, to twelve, and Cal goes to
twelve. So don't say that Dave would throw the game to me, because you and
Cal would very easily stop that. I mean, England vs. Russia in the north is
no contest, and Italy vs. Austria in the south would be an easy time for
you.  In fact, I'd be so overpowered in the north that I think we'd just
have to throw up a stalemate line and be done with it (eliminating Austria
along the way, naturally).

How's that? Too vague?

Of course, Dave might actually ask you to move to Greece. In that case, you
wouldn't even have to stab him, you'd get the center and you could stab him
next year, and you could send something else west.

Argh, am I whistling in the dark again? This time just say 'no thanks' if
for some reason you want to keep waiting it out, don't make me squander my
moves again and lose more ground. You're going to need me at some point,
you know.

Now I'm getting depressed, I should go to sleep.

If I may be so bold:
Take what you will, but maybe you ought to put that new army somewhere it
could be useful in case you decide next year is a good time to switch
tacks. For intance, it would not be very helpful in Denmark or Norway!

Paris is looking kind of naked, but I suppose you've noticed that.

My other neighbors are bargaining very hard with me (rather suddenly), but
so far I have resisted. It still seems to me that my best bet is to take my
licks in the north and see if I can keep what I've got, or even maybe grow
a little, in the south.

Hope I'm right!

You could always convoy me to Livonia... :)   Seriously though, I WILL
probably be moving it on to the mainland.

Actually, with you increasing in strength in the south and the removals
that Dave made, I don't think I have to worry overly much about A/I
perfidy.  You're much more of a threat to them now and in the
immediate future. At least for the moment, you're still the devil most
feared.

Geez, it's almost as though he *wants* you to take Ven and Gre! And maybe
Tri too.

Surely there's some way to get you to take some stuff this year, there must
be. It's such a golden opportunity. If I got even one from him, and you got
two, he'd be finished. Virtually. A two center power threatening to throw
the game to me?

We have lots of time. I mean, I have lots of time to convince you. But I'm
right this time, aren't I?

Hi guy!  I need to know what you think about supporting me to Berlin this
season so I can figure out some tactics.  Part of the reason I want Berlin
(as well as the fact that it's a centre that gets taken away from Russia)
is so that Kiel will be open for a fleet which will allow me to make a move
on Bal & Bot ASAP.  Tactically, that will hurt Russia's northern front very
seriously if done correctly.

Please get back to me.

Hi yourself.  I've not been ignoring you, just the usual busy and no email
on the weekends.  I'm not completely adverse to the idea of you getting
into Berlin, but do have a couple of thoughts about it.  First is that I
think there is about zero chance of it working.  Second is that we need
Austrian units more than English units to keep the southern front from
collapsing.  I'll have to update a map and look at it, but I'm thinking
that Mun -Ber might have a better chance of success and some shuffling
of units would still achieve our goals.  Let me do up a map and get back
to you in a day or so.

Why the move to MAO?  There was no threat from France.  If you start to
pressure Italy it makes things rather ugly all around.

Okay, fair enough.  I have no problem with you owning Berlin at all.  I
just want to be able to use it to base a fleet there long enough to force
Baltic.  That's the key in any attack quick attack on Russia in the north -
bully your way into the two interior sea spaces ASAP.

Mostly because Manus was so gung ho that I NOT move there - sheer
cussedness, I suppose.  Don't worry, it won't happen again.  I'll either
keep bouncing it with F Portugal until Manus is out of Western Med or (more
likely) I'll move it to the English Channel this turn.

Do you guys want my fleet in Portugal to come into the Med to help out?  I

I need ideas and I need them fast.  I haven't had time to look

Manus,

My results from the build orders say that the moves are due on Friday.
That is what I've been working on.  If someone changed the deadline on
me again I missed it.  One of the understandings I had when I joined
was that I couldn't do quick deadlines, too much else going on.  How
do I check what the deadline really is?  I'll get you ideas tomorrow,
but I can't do it today at work and I don't have email from home.

You can check the deadline by asking for a game "list", but it
also appears at the top of all "echoes" back to you (like
the press you sent me).  Long story short, you were absolutely

hello Manus,

I think you are trying too hard to make this complicated! (<:

While it's always fun to fake people out, I really don't see
much gain from trying to make Jamie think you are working
with him.  He'll find out the truth soon enough, and in the
meantime and apparent rift between us will only increase the
chances of Cal making a move of his own.

As to the current move, I think Jamie made a mistake with his
fleet build.  Smyrna is now ours.  My suggestions are as
follows:

A Syr s F Eas - Smy, F Ion - Aeg, F Nap - Ion, F Wes s Spa, A Spa s Por

If Jamie does anything other than use Con to support Smy, then we are
in.  If he does support, then you are in Aeg, and as he can't move up
any more support this turn, Smy falls in the Fall.

Note that I do have you supporting me in.  There are two reasons for this.
One, I think I need the centers to stop the collapse of our line.  We
can't afford any more Austrian disbands than we have to.  Secondly, I
think there is a fair chance you may end up in Greece in the fall anyway.

What do you think?

Rick;

All of a sudden in the middle of the day I got hit with some kind of flu or
somehing. I have a high fever and can't think straight. I've been sleeping
all afternoon.

I submitted my moves, uh, this morning, maybe, I think, and they are my
moves on the assumption that Manus isn't going to help me, which is the
assumption I would make, of course, if he never answers me at all. At the
time I was hoping he would indeed write to me today and agree to my plan.
Well, the day isn't over in California, I guess.

So. Um.

I have no idea what my conclusion is. Maybe this is enough information for
you to know what to do.

But as I told you, I am leaving town this afternoon. I'll check in as late

So I'm afraid we will not be able to coordinate anything. Too bad. But take
Greece anyway, I'll support you there. And order Nap-Apu, so you can take

I'll probably live to regret it but I'm holding out for one more year.
I imagine you aren't too happy with this decision, but your fleet at
Sevastopol in the end convinced me that our alliance isn't much of
one yet.  I know Cal is a worry, but if he attacks me, I will convoy
you to Tunis or whatever it takes to hand you the game.  I know he's
hitting you hard up north, but I don't like the fact that you chose to
add more strength to the south instead of deal with him.  I intend to
get my pound of flesh out of Dave, but I guess with your
fleets not only increasing but coming out to get me, and your ownership
of the Turkish spots where I first got stabbed, I'm hoping for an ounce
or two from you first.  I may not get it, but I just was feeling like
while I ate Dave, you would fill the Med and I would have my little
line up against Cal while you sailed into Naples.  Like I say, maybe
this is going to happen anyway; God knows I hope not, but your moves
are no encouragement for any kind of alliance.  I realize I could have
had Greece either of the last two turns.  Look what it would have got me.
You now have three units on it and if you think I would feel safe there,
you're wrong.  You're big, you're growing, and you're a threat to me.
I want to work with you but I don't see a way when you keep coming at me.
I'll admit that I waffled back and forth, and that Dave sweet-talked
me a bit, but well, what's done is done.  Like I say, I'd love to work with
you, but if you're attacking Austria, I don't see why you need three southern
fleets.

Yeah, that looks good. (Strange thing to say to someone who's taking your
centers, but that's how it looks to me!)

I'm a little bit sorry that you're giving Austria Berlin, but I guess he's
still got you with that "I'll throw the game to Jamie if you don't follow
my instructions" line, huh? (He told me he'd give you the game if I didn't
start giving him back his centers, but so far I haven't bought it. :-))


I see you're planning a nice convoy, so maybe you'll feel ready for a
change of tack after the next adjustments. Don't worry, Manus isn't going
to build. He's squandering his only opportunities.

So, for the record, my position is this: If you leave me with enough to
have some hope, I'll keep Manus from bottling up the Med. while you enter.

Obviously, if my chances are wrecked, I'll have to just go for whatever
last alliance I can get to prevent you from solo-ing. Don't be too greedy!
Take the >50% chance I'm offering!

>I'll probably live to regret it but I'm holding out for one more year.

What I'm not to happy about is that you again waited until after the move
to let me know.
Fortunately, I was not so foolish as to support you again!

>but your fleet at

It sure isn't!
Our 'alliance' consists of my offering you any support I can give, and you
hedging until after the moves and *then* declining! That's not an alliance,
you're right. It's totally one-sided.

> I know Cal is a worry,  but if he attacks me, I will convoy
>you to Tunis or whatever it takes to hand you the game.

Manus, I think you're missing the point. If Dave attacks you and you aren't
prepared to defend Tunis, Naples, etc., then there isn't going to be any
question of handing me the game! He will get 18 centers. He has the
northern half of the stalemate line practically in his pocket -- it's
conceivable that if he were to stab a little too early the Austrian army in
Germany could form part of an Eastern line, but if not England would have
Stp to Munich, and would need just Tunis to win. And if I don't debuild
carefully, he could get a little bite more.
But at the moment, Cal doesn't seem to be heading that way, so it looks
reasonably safe for you to continue to play around in the south. So my job
will be to prevent you from gaining anything out of it. I haven't examined
the results very carefully, but it appears that I'm doing pretty well at
that job so far.

>  I know he's
>hitting you hard up north, but I don't like the fact that you chose to
>add more strength to the south instead of deal with him.

Well, then you shouldn't have chosen the "Lie to Jamie for a few Seasons to
See if I Can Get an Extra Center" option. If you thought I was going to
roll over, you were badly mistaken.

As I explained, there is no way I can 'deal with' Cal in the north. I can
make that fight last a little longer, but I cannot win it. Cal will get all
of those centers. It's just a question of how long it takes him.

Ok.
So come and get it then. I'm sure you won't need much force in the western
seas.
Which ounce are you expecting to get, by the way? You just passed up
Smyrna. Are you hoping I'll take Greece so you can take it from me instead
of from Dave? Or which juicy ounce of my flesh are you salivating over?

>  I may not get it, but I just was feeling like
>while I ate Dave, you would fill the Med and I would have my little
>line up against Cal while you sailed into Naples.

So, the scenario you envisage is this. I attack you and Austria, and Cal
waits quietly for a while until I can manage to set up a stalemate line
against him ALL BY MYSELF.
Sure, that's likely. Cal is very trustworthy, I would trust him not to just
take the 18th center while I fought for years to try to take Naples and
Rome, Venice and Tunis, Greece and Serbia, Vienna and Trieste.


> Like I say, maybe
>this is going to happen anyway; God knows I hope not, but your moves
>are no encouragement for any kind of alliance.

*MY* moves are not encouraging!
No, because ordering my units to support yours into Greece is not
encouraging for an alliance. What's encouraging is when you tell me for a
week or so, "Yeah, maybe this is the right time", and then *after* the
moves are processed you let on that you weren't interested. Probably the
most encouraging moves for an alliance are your convoy into Syria and
support of the Austrian fleet into Smyrna.

Hm, wait, that doesn't sound right. Let me check my Users Manual again.


>I want to work with you but I don't see a way when you keep coming at me.

That's disingenuous, don't give me that.
You continue to support Austria *against* me, you convoy an army to a
position where it can't do anything but attack me, you try to get me to use
up my precious moves to support actions you don't intend to make. I offer
you any support I can give, I actually issue the support order, I even
clear out Smyrna in case you want it. It's very clear who's trying to make
an alliance and who's just stringing the other guy along.


>but well, what's done is done.

Yeah, the song is over. But the memory lingers on.

> Like I say, I'd love to work with
>you, but if you're attacking Austria, I don't see why you need three southern
>fleets.

I told you why. I built another fleet because you stabbed me.

It's perfectly clear that I am attacking Austria. If you *really* doubt it
(and I don't think you do, I think you're just pretending), then I bet you
are the only person among all players and observers who has the slightest
doubt. It's not exactly a surprise, either. The surprise, to me anyway, is
that when you stab me you aren't even stabbing me to gain anything. You're
just feeding Dave.

Well, at the moment I don't know what else to do, so I will just continue
my present approach. Maybe Cal will take a couple of years to capture all
of the North. It's probably too late to get Dave on the ropes before that
happens, so I'll just have to hope that at that point, the two of you will
do something to prevent an English win.

Ooh, I was in the middle of writing a follow-up.

Well, I honestly don't understand your attitude. I mean this:

>Yeah, but the differnece here is that all he has to do is throw you one
>or two more centres than you can easily TAKE to give you the solo.

How do you figure that???

Here's how I see it. You're going to have Scandinavia. You actually *had*
Germany locked up, but Dave made you put him in Berlin and now I have
Munich, so you'd have to be careful there, but that was up to you, you
could have sewn up Germany. And ultimately you'd get Stp, too, though I
could probably hold it a good long time. So to win, I would have to take
all of Austria, all of the Balkans, and all of Italy. You think Dave could
throw me Italy???


But on the other hand, if Dave decided he wanted you to win, it would be
trivial for him to give it to you, absolutely trivial. All he'd have to do
is cut Italy's defenses while you sailed in to take Spa and Mar and Tun.
The rest, the northern centers, you can get even without his help (as long
as he doesn't hinder).

So how come I'm not worried?

Because I know Dave?

Anyway, I guess I won't waste my breath.

Good luck with Sweden, sort of. I'm half inclined to let you take it
without opposition. In fact, the only reason I won't do that is that I'm
afraid you'd use the slack to help Dave more :-(. What I was hoping was
that you'd make your gains faster, and I'd cut Dave down to an
unthreatening size, and we'd play it from there. But Dave has an extensive
life-support system in place now.

I think Dave is playing quite an amazing game. He's forcing you and Manus
both to give him my centers! Why Manus agreed that Austria should get
Smyrna I can't imagine. Hypnosis, I guess. At least up in your area, you're
getting something too, and you could get Berlin or Mun later. Manus has
nothing to show for his help, and not likely to see anything soon either.
Yeah, must be hypnosis.

I see what you're saying and it makes sense.  The difference, I guess, is
that you and are both seeing it from our own pessimistic points of view.  I
look at it and say, "geez, he's got 13 centres and most of Austria and the
Balkans in his grasp!" and underestimate how much damage I can do up north.
You look at it and think "Geez, Scandinavia is lost and that's four centres
(inc St Pete's) and I'm going to have a battle on my hands getting Dave out
of Austria with Cal and Manus propping him up."  That leads to a different
perspective.  The truth, I suppose, is somewhere in the middle.

See what I mean?

I don't think he'd throw an outright victory to either of us (I know him a
bit too, from postal play, albeit Gunboat), but if he is forced to make a
"show" of giving you or me a centre, it might be enough to tip the balance.
I won't risk that for now...

>Anyway, I guess I won't waste my breath.


It's hardly wasted for two reasons:  1) you're the only one writing to me at
the moment (we know about Dave's problems, but Manus has disappeared.
Probably picketing outside the Hasbro front offices with a "Save The
Judges!" sign... <g>); and 2) I'm not completely unamenable to what you're
saying. I know that I will eventually have to move back through the Med and,
(admission of blatant self-interest coming) since you're encouraging that,
I'm not ruling out  going along with your ideas.  If you're offering to
help, I'd certainly accept. I just don't think I can turn aside at the
moment.  Next year?  Perhaps a different story.

Truth to tell, his actually getting into Berlin surprised me a bit.  I
figured you'd use it to go into Munich.  A Sil-Mun was unexpected.

As you say, Dave is in a better position tactically and will slow you down
more than I had expected.  Needless to say, I won't give him any more
centres if I can help it.  Strategically speaking, we have a different
story.  If he and I are able to kick you out of Munich this turn (which we
need to do to keep your growth to a minimum), you're going to have a very
interesting retreat option (as I'm sure you've noticed).  While Burgandy
would mess me up somewhat, I'm sure Tyrolia will be a much more useful
option for you. That will give you some pretty good leverage on taking
centres from both Dave and Manus (heck, it might even be enough to crack
Italy open and get you that 18 centre win, although that is a BIT of a
longshot).  This is pretty much the reason for MY paranoia.

Oh, sure, it's in the middle, I agree.

I should be *glad* you don't realize, uh, I mean, believe that you have a

Grrrrr.
As though his giving me one center might "tip the balance" in the sense of
letting me win!

Oh well.

He hasn't really disappeared. I learned this a few moves ago. He just
thinks he can sometimes get an advantage by not responding until the last
minute, or better still just *after* the last minute. It's an annoying
ploy, frankly, I find it a little insulting. (He did get me with it once,
though.)

Oh!
Well well.

I didn't actually mean you should turn aside at the moment! No no no. Ok, I
wasn't clear at all.

No, I meant, supposing that you are going to go ahead and take Sweden, it
*still* might be sensible for us to, ummm, arrange, or orchestrate things
just a little right now.

For instance, you mention later that you guys can kick me out of Munich.
Well, of course you can. But do you really want to?? If you kick me out of
Munich, I really might retreat to Burgundy. Sure, I agree, Tyrolia would
also be nice. But Burgundy has its attractions too.
So maybe you don't really want me out of Munich all that badly. Maybe what
you want is just definitely to get Sweden, and make sure you keep Kiel.
(Trying my own hypnosis: you want sweeeeeden, sweeeeden is very niiiiice,
the giiiirrrrls are beauuoooooootiful... you need kieeeeel, your ships will
fall down if you lose your keeeels... scandinavia is so important,
scandiNAVYyeah!, navy, navy, British navy, scandiNAVYyeah!.... you don't
care about germany, nasty germs, sick sailors, bad, bad germs, bad germany,
you don't care....)

Maybe you'll take Munich *after* you've got that new army into a more
useful position, so that Mun r Bur is no longer a possibility.

Also, maybe you don't mind me staying just a little stronger for another
year, strong enough to render Austria harmless. This seems sensible. After
all, I think Austria is likely to help *you* win, and you think a strong
Austria is likely to help *me* win, so presumably making Austria impotent
is something we both want. Of course, at least some of the gains would have
to be yours, but that would mean you'd have to take them. But (once again!)
I'll go first :-) :-) :-)

But seriously, if you let me cut Austria down to a little puddle, then you
and I will be able to see our relative strengths more clearly, there will
be no disagreement about whose side Austria's dots go to in the showdown.


Am I still being too oblique here? I mean, maybe you just have to tell
Austria that you'd like to help regain Munich, but after all he can't own
both of those centers *this* year (Mun plus Ber), and you do need to make
sure you get Sweden right away without losing Kiel or Norway or Den. (You
can't make sure, really, but devoting a huge percentage of your forces to
the task of taking Swe and protecting Den and Kie and Nwy definitely raises
the likelihood for you.) And you could also say that you are pretty sure I
would retreat to Bur (or Ruh if you went Ruh-Bur). I could probably tell
Manus something that would leak back to Dave, along the lines that I will
definitely retreat to Burgundy if I'm kicked out of Munich.

So then you'd get Sweden, and I've lost Smyrna, so even if I do very well
in the middle of the Austrian territory I'm not going to build, and you
will. So when the real "re-evaluation" time comes at the end of this year,
I'd still be in relatively good shape but not as good as yours, and Austria
would be doing just a little worse than anticipated. This somehow seems
like progress from both our perspectives. No?



>Truth to tell, his actually getting into Berlin surprised me a bit.  I
>figured you'd use it to go into Munich.  A Sil-Mun was unexpected.

Oh, well, you know, I got my training with the Spanish Inquisition.

No, seriously, it was just one of the possible moves, I thought it was
pretty obvious. I got a little lucky that time. Unlucky last year, but I
think my moves were in general pretty lucky this last season. Most of the
time, in tactical skirmishes like these, I think the short term ebb and
flow turns on luck. You just try to eke the odds up a little, if you're in
it for the long haul, which I am.

>If he and I are able to kick you out of Munich this turn (which we
>need to do to keep your growth to a minimum)

Wait.
Stop.
My growth is going to be zero at best. More likely to be negative.
Right?
I lost Berlin, Smyrna, and you're going to get Sweden (well, very likely).
I might lose Budapest. I added Serbia, and I have a shot at Greece, and I
got Munich. If I'm lucky, I break even. I'm expecting to go down one.

>, you're going to have a very

Oh, but the answer is so simple: don't remove me from Munich!

Yes, I could do damage from either Burgundy or Tyrolia, I sure could, and I
honestly don't know which way I'd go.

Still, 18, wow, that's really paranoid. Count again. I really would have to
take all of Italy. I know A Tyo is strong, but it's generally not strong
enough to eliminate Italy without at least one fleet in Ionian!

And, you know, if I were reasonably confident that you were 'finishing up'
your northern escapade, I would definitely be wanting that A Mun to go to
Tyo when it *is* kicked out of there, eventually, by two or three English
armies that after all really do have to go down into Burgundy and
thereabouts, just for your defenses. (That's the reason they go there, but
what they do once they're in the neighborhood you just can't tell, that's
the problem with soldiers in France, you know, they tend to get a little
wild.)


So, I hope you're seeing my ideas, at least. I don't *think* they are risky
for you. They don't involve any outright immediate betrayal of Austria for
you. I'd just like you to get into a better position where you don't have
to worry so much about what Dave thinks... and it would be nice if that
would happen before I start spurting blood out of the jugular. Or aorta, or
some other serious spot. (Hm, F Jug -Aor, that's worth considering.) You
give me the chance, I'll remove Dave's threat for you. My pleasure. A small
favor.

It's not so much the centre as the resultant loss of tactical positioning.

[Not terribly Kreskin-esque attempt at hypnosis snipped...]

With an army on the continent this upcoming turn, I can keep you out of
Paris and Manus can keep you out of Marseilles.  You'd tie up some forces,
but they would be forces that aren't really being used right now.  Just so
you know that I'm not THAT concerned with you retreatng to Burandy...

Austria as a little puddle won't be a bad thing.  Later.  Right now he's
my buffer against you while I continue to grow.  Are you offering me
Munich?

Okay, granted, but breaking even is more likely depending, I suppose, on
Munich.

I guess that answers my question about you offering Munich... :)

As I said above, I'm not that worried about Burgandy.

I think a combination of my taking Sweden and you NOT retreating to

I am seeing your ideas and I'm agreeing with them (for the most part).
And as for your small favour, I certainly accept (even if you Yanks can't
spell it... <g>)  Spring of next year will most likely give us a clue as
to how we're going to proceed (or for that matter, if we're a "we"!
although I suspect it will happen).

Later

Cutting to the chase:
Sure, I'm offering Munich.

What am I offering it in exchange for, by the way? Oooh. Wait, I don't have
my map up right now, just that mental one I have with kind of fuzzy
boundaries. Hm. Let me look at my other mail, then I'll look at my map, I
think I see your point. If I do, then yes, I am offering Munich, for sure.

Ok, I think I have the picture now.


>Perhaps, but you'll pardon any skepticism I might feel towards you
>arrranging to give me any of your centres... <g>

Well, by all means be skeptical, but here's my perspective: you're going to
get those centers (even if you can't spell it). Under most ordinary game
circumstances, I'd try to keep the invader out as long as possible, even if
I knew he was going to get them. But I don't feel I have much of an
interest in doing that. What I want is for you to be ready to move on to
your next phase *while I'm still in good shape*.

I think I might have some trouble in the south if this keeps up much
longer. I mean, I know I will. Certainly if/when I start disbanding. So I
prefer to get it done with sooner. If that means 'letting' you get your
centers a little earlier, I can swallow hard and do that.

[Darn it, I'm going to demand my money back from that charlatan, he swore

That's true, yes. Hm. Well, of course, you'd have to keep me out of Bel and
Hol, too. That takes more units. I know it isn't a disaster for you, but
I'm trying to make the alternatives seem relatively more attractive.


>Austria as a little puddle won't be a bad thing.  Later.  Right now he's

Yes, pretty much, I am. See below.



>> Oh, but the answer is so simple: don't remove me from Munich!
>
>I guess that answers my question about you offering Munich... :)

Well, see, I wasn't in fact offering Munich for this year -- I was
supposing that you could/would let me keep it with the understanding that
you'd have no trouble getting it later. But I'm changing my tune.


>I think a combination of my taking Sweden and you NOT retreating to
>Burgandy would be definite factors in my re-evaluation.

Aha. Right, ok.

So, here's my new idea.
If you take Munich and I retake Berlin, then the net is a transfer of
Munich from Austria to you, which is just what I want. As things stand, you
can do this without at all crossing Austria 'out loud', so to speak.
Because of the way I'd have to use my forces to retake Berlin, you'd easily
get Sweden -- I know, you'll very likely get it anyway, but this would make
it a sure thing. So you'd add Mun and Swe that way.

Now the question is, if that's how things go, and if I retreat Mun-Tyo, is
that going to be enough for you? Will you change tacks next year?

I think it may very well be (virtually) too late to stop Cal from winning.
I think he's going to take Munich. He'll convoy his army to Belgium. He'll
take Sweden, and he'll build three, including at least one army. From
Munich he will move to Tyrolia. At that point, there is no stalemate line
left for the East.

Cal will have no trouble getting Stp or Berlin. That's fifteen. You would
have to stop him from getting Spa and Mar, or it would be over, because the
A Tyo can get him the last center.

Since I don't believe you are going to take the necessary precautions this
season or even next season, I think he can win if he goes for it.

I'm just hoping he still has the old "Gotta Stop Russia" mindset.

Dave can't do much about this either, unless he blocks Tyrolia, which I
doubt he'll do.

I'll be doing well if I only go down two this year. When that happens, even
Cal isn't going to continue to believe I'm the one who's a threat. If he
really does believe it now.

I am sick today (and yesterday).  Shouldn't even be at work (wasn't yesterday)
but here I am.  Feeling just horrible.  Anyway, got your mails, have no
energy for anything but a quickie response.  If you think Cal is about to
win, you should attack him.  I understand why you sold the north for the
south, hoping Cal would not head your way, but if it didn't work and if you
are now rethinking that decision and encouraging similar rethinking in me,
perhaps it is time to make peace with Dave and all hit Cal.  I know you
wanted Dave dead rather than part of a three-way, but am not sure we would
be in any different boat, or that the two of us could do it then if it needs
to be done.

Sorry so short.  What you just read may very well be the product of
delerium, so forgive if so.

Sickly,
Manus

Sorry you're sick. You probably caught it from me. It's one of those e-mail
viruses.


Look, I have said this repeatedly. There was no way for me to stop Cal from
taking my centers in the north. There was nothing I could do. He had far
more units, and England practically always has much better position in a
fight against Russia.

If I thought I could beat Cal in the north, I *certainly* would have done
it. He stabbed me! That's my favorite time and place to fight! But it was
pointless.

So my options were, use lots of units to try to *slow* Cal while allowing
you and Dave to take my southern centers, or just try to slow him with the
units I had up there while preventing you and Dave from taking my southern
centers. For a while I thought I had other options, but you foreclosed
them. So faced with those, it was pretty obvious what I was going to do. I
said all of this earlier. And then I did it.

Just what do you mean by "sold the north for the south"? What do you think
I could have done up there?


Well, back to the present.

I may have just been feeling pessimistic when I sent that last note. It's
not so clear that Cal could even get into the Med.


I'm going to make one suggestion. I'm not going to keep nudging you about
it in these coming phases.

It's possible that I can take Berlin away from Austria this coming move.
Not just possible, I *can*. And it sure looks like I'm going to reduce
Austria by one in his core area. Not just looks-like, I *will*. If you took
Smyrna instead of Dave having it, that would leave him pretty barren. At
that point, you could probably just build an army and take Venice -- or you
could move Nap-Apu now and be certain of getting Ven next year. I'd offer
Gre, Tri, or whatever, to build up your forces, and you would be welcome to
leave the A Smy in case I had to give you another center too. You'd have
three or four fleets to block Cal, which would be enough. The only issue
would be whether I could set up a big line east of Switz and also take out
Dave. I looked at the position, and I think I can do that.

Just keep in mind that Cal is going to build three units. If you think the
unit in Lvp is going to be an army, well, I don't know what to say. And
you're fighting in Asia Minor.
