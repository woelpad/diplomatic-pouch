Ah. There we go.

Now, is there a delay, or do we play this round? Do you remember?

I don't suppose that you would be willing to tell me what your fleet plans
are, would you? As a sort of initiation of the dreaded IR alliance (from
what I hear, possibly the only remaining alliance on the board!)?

Ok, so let's play.

I'm ordering A Kie S A Bur-Mun.
Do you want me to order Sil S Bur-Mun, or Sil-Boh? (I slightly prefer the
latter.)

Also, shall we order Nwy-Swe, Swe-Nwy?

Well, frankly, I don't see any reason NOT to tell you.  However, I haven't
looked at the map yet (perhaps I shouldn't admit to that -- that was why
you tossed me overboard last time!)

Well, I'll pull up a map and look, and unless I see reason not to tell you,
I'll tell you.  If I find that I can't tell you, well, I won't, but I hope
our "alliance" (ho ho ho) remains strong nonetheless.  :-)

Dave:

Jamie wrote to ask me if I would mind telling him what my fleet is
doing, as a token of good faith in the "I/R" that he and I have been
joking about.  Do you have any idea for how I might be able to answer
him and then actually follow through co that perhaps (maybe it's a pipe
dream, but...) he might also let word slip to me concerning his moves,
especially if I come in contact with him to coordinate an attack on
you (which, of course, would fail big-time as I would simply pass
operational plans to you).  This might give Cal time to get his assault
moving.  I obviously don't want to hurt our cause and am fine just sitting
here holding if Cal will grant me leave to do it, but if you have any idea
for how I can help us by appearing not to and spreading some butter on
Jamie, please let me know....  I just guess that since Jamie is interested
in my fleet order, perhaps I *can* be useful and do something other than
sit on my hands and root for you and Cal.

One more thing -- have you gotten a bead on Cal's plans yet?  Is he going
to hit Jamie or will he finish me off.  If he does, obviously you give
Jamie the game, but do you know if he believes this yet?  Is he even back
>from vacation yet?  I cannot recall.

Hi Manus,

Well, I suppose you could tell Jamie that you are going to extract your
pound of flesh from me, but that if he wants the I/R to go forward he
needs to explain how he's going to move against England, especially as
he declined to build a fleet in Stp.

As to Cal, I don't remember if he is back yet or not.  He's said he
believes us, but it's hard to know if it is real.  Of course I don't
really want or plan to give the game to Jamie, but if Cal does attack
you and not Jamie, then I do plan to hand Jamie sufficient centers that
the win will be inevitable if Cal does not attack.  Just as with you
I'm sure, if I'm not in on the final draw, then it doesn't matter to
me what the outcome is.  If there are those who won't help me to that
goal, then I'll do my best to make the threat to them real enough that
they have to.

Personally, I see little way that either of us can be in on a two way
or less draw.  There is not a lot of extra satisfaction in a 3 way rather
than a 4 way, and doing so at the expense of attacking you again to benefit
Jamie is definitely not in my plans.  The real danger I see is that E/R
may decide they can pull off a carefully balanced 2 way and eliminate both
of us.  That's the danger I'm fighting against and the reason I'd run
Jamie up to 16 or 17 immediately if Cal started your way.  Screw up the
balance and the 2 way won't work.

Hopefully of course you concur (<:.

I most certainly do concur.  On each and every point.  I will tell
Jamie I'm willing to attack you, but question his lack of a StP fleet
and see what he says....

Well, at this point, I am leaning towards extracting my pound of flesh
>from Dave as long as Cal doesn't keep attacking me.  This, however, is
a big concern.  Since you didn't build in St. Pete (why not?) it looks
to me like the E/R is still intact and Dave and I can start thinking
about putting our heads between our legs, so maybe I should find common
cause with him instead of attack him.

Still pondering (obviously).  Which way are you headed, though?  I
am reluctant to commit to an I/R (again, ho ho ho) until I see some
serious attack by you on Cal.  What's up in that regard?

I have no objection to laying my cards on the table.

Which way am I headed? I am certainly headed into Austria! Was there some
doubt in your mind about that?


As to the North, everything's up in the air at the moment. I don't know
what will happen. I decided not to build in Stp because (a) I can certainly
use all the builds in the south, in any case, and (2) I am still hoping
that maybe Cal will do something other than attack me, or at least not
commit all his forces to attacking me. Building in Stp would practically
force Cal to attack me full throttle. If Cal had been successful in his
insidious stab last move, I would be pretty confident that he was going to
stay with the E/R alliance. As it turned out, I guess I think it's more
likely than not that he'll be gunning for Kiel or StP. But it's a chance
I'm going to take, partly because I think I could come out all right if Cal
does take a northern center or three from me, so long as I've knocked Dave
down to an unthreatening size.

I think you'd be silly to launch a serious attack against Austria right
now, frankly, much as it would help me. For one thing, you ought to wait
until it's easier for you, say after he vacates Venice of his own free
will. (If I'm lucky, that will be at the end of 1906 when I've forced him
to remove units!) That way you get the center without having to devote the
units. And for another thing, I think you'd be making a big mistake to
trust King Kal entirely -- again, just from general considerations, not
because I am especially confident that I know what he's going to do. He
might decide that he can attack on both wings. He'd probably be right, too.
If I had to guess, that'd be my guess.
If you could capture Venice without a real struggle this year, that would
be different. I think that would be smart, because Dave couldn't really
complain about it and you'd be up to five centers, a considerable leap for
you in survivability. Seems to me that to have any real chance of finishing
the game alive, you need to get to five centers, and probably six. (King
Kal will be keenly aware of this, by the way. Did you see any of the
Ghodstoo ending?)


My basic outlook is this. If I can avoid having absolutely everybody
fighting me at once, I'll be happy. I never meant nor wanted to be the
leader at this stage, and I wouldn't mind at all if Kal turned out to be
the dark horse endgame leader. What I really really don't want is to have
Austria thrashing around with a big cache of centers, able and willing to
throw the game to England. If I can eliminate him with your help, then
we've got a relatively easy time preventing Kal from romping, even if he
does launch a two-prong offensive now. Maybe he could win anyway, or maybe
I could, or maybe you'd hold a lot of crucial middle territory and we'd end
in a 3-way -- I don't pretend to be able to see how it would end. On the
other hand, if I can't eliminate or at least crush Austria because you're
propping him up, and Cal is attacking me too, then I would have to play a
riskier strategy.

Hey Cal --

I don't know if you're back yet, but in case you are, I thought I'd
get you these quotes from Jamie.  Not surprisingly, he is wanting to make
sure that I use my fleet to head west, not prop up Dave, and it sounds
like he's praying that you don't turn on hom.  All the more reason for
you to do so, I say (and hope).

That part sounds good to me, I like the idea of Russia taking some risks (<:.
As before, I ask only that you not take me out merely to move from a 4 way
to a 3 way draw.  If you can move to go for a win, then I could be persuaded
to be a willing sacrifice!

As far as "attacking me", you should be able to force the Ionian on that
basis, which is what we want anyway.  I can safely attack with that fleet
by attacking EAS where his fleet is currently placed.  If he moves to Aeg,
then I'm in EAS.  If he holds, then I retreat to Aeg.

As to armies, well, I'm at your mercy anyway, so if you want to move Rome
to Venice that is fine by me.  I don't think it would be a good idea for
you to actually take the center as my units are on the front line, but
having you in in the spring and out in the fall is not a problem.  Before
we do that though I need to review the board and my moves to make sure that
I will be able to guarantee vacating Venice.  A bounce would cause a delay
that we definitely don't want.

What are your ideas for our actual unit movements?  Do you feel you need to
cover Mar or are you going to leave it open and concentrate on the east?
What about Hohn, have you heard from him at all?

Regards
Dave

Ha!  Me take YOU out?  Me have a chance at ANYthing less than a four-way?
It is to laugh.  But thanks for the thought.

Right.  I will, however, make noise to Cal that I'll be guarding the Med.
I'm deathly afraid that he'll sneak around Spain and we'll both die at
E/R's hands.  It'll be a race for me to give centers to Cal and you give
them to Jamie to make sure we spoil at least one of their Christmases.

If I move to Venice, it would be a Springtime visit.  Do not worry; I will
not jeopardize any semblance of defense that we might have.

Right.  Let me know.

Have heard nothing from Hohn and have thought nothing of Marseilles.
Unfortunately, it's almost the case that I have to trust that Cal sees
the light and moves everything north and east.  I sent him some excerpts
>from Jamie's mail to me that at least gave ME the impression that Russian
centers will be easy for Cal to take and that Jamie truly doesn't want
that to happen (all the more reason for Cal to do it, I say).

Don't know about you, but the layoff means I'm having a hard time getting
back into the game mentally.  I suppose that will change once we resume
"l'attaque", but for now my mind is elsewhere (mostly on fighting SPAM and
designing web pages, but that's a story for later... <g>).

Go for the latter then and do what you want with Kiel.  Remember we were
talking about whether or not we should go for Munich now or in the Fall?
Well, I think I will be better served tactically by waiting for a season.  I
want to push that army south this turn (probably Gascony) in hopes of taking
Hohn out this year.  I'll have the current A BEL in Bur after this turn, so
we'll make our grab in the Fall.  Copascetic?

>Also, shall we order Nwy-Swe, Swe-Nwy?


Nervous, eh?  <G>  I have no problem with the bounce.  I was going to hold

Not much time here, but my thoughts.

1) Yes, I'll do it if necessary (<:

2) In regards to France a couple of points.
      A) remember that Mars is currently Italian, not French!
      B) Russia is the prime target, taking out France is not important
         enough to allow English units to slide into the Med.  No sneaky
         end runs please (<:
      C) The southern front needs the units more than the north at this
         point, if France is to be destroyed, then I think Spain at a
         minimum needs to go to Italy.
      D) Therefore, if France is to be attacked, Pie should go to Mar
         in the spring and receive support to Spa in the Fall.  England
         doesn't NEED the center right now, and this achieves his goal
         of reducing France without any of his units sliding south and
         possibly triggering our paranoid reflexes.  In the spring,
         England can of course try to send Mao to Por, possibly gaining
         a center and leading to the destruction of France.

Gotta run.

Yes.
(Only now I'm thinking maybe you should have build another army! Oh well,
you can do that next year, since you will certainly get Mun at least.)

I think that's marginally better for me, too, because when I thought
through the Fall position, it didn't seem to me that your A Mun would be
all that helpful in advancing my units. So I'll advance them this season,
that should help me just a little. Very small bits of tactics might turn
out to be pretty important in this fight, like whether I can move A War
down into Gal behind Gal-Bud without Austria bouncing the War-Gal move. So
I think the A Sil will support War-Gal.

No problem.  I'll be happy to work out any way with Manus that keeps Mars
out of French hands.

The moves for the rest of my units will confirm my intentions.  However, I
mean to take Hohn out just as as surely as you mean to throw centres to
Russia if I prove false.  I will be more than happy to see it's done in a
manner that you two approve of, but it will be done.  No English ship will
go further than Spasc.

Given the limited front Manus currently has to fight on, I'd be inclined to
disagree, but I do admit that should you make a few wrong guesses, an extra
unit or two for Italy could prove quite necessary just to prop you up.  I'll
stay flexible on this, ok?

Just so it doesn't come as a shock to anyone, I am moving F Mid-Spasc, A
Bur-Gas & F Bre-Mid.  If Hohn does anything but stay in Spain, he will be
gone after the Fall.  At best, he will be killed the following turn.  After
that, those three units will follow the rest of my armed forces north.

Fair enough?  I won't be talked out of eliminating France but don't do
anything rash until you at least see where the rest of my units are heading,
okay?

I can understand and accept your desire to wipe out France.  I don't
really like fleets in Spa/sc and MAO, but that's more up to Manus.
I think having the army in Bur involved in the German campaign,
either supporting Munich or moving to Ruhr would be a lot more
useful however.  What about the following:

Mao - Por, Bre - Mao, Pie - Mar

If France sits, then both centers will fall.  If he tries for MAO, then
both centers fall.  If he tries for Mar, then both centers fall (por s
Mao - Spa/NC in the fall).  If he tries for Por, then one center falls
(Mar and MAO take out Spa) and the other will go the next year.

This negates the need for England to go to MAO/sc, keeps the army on
the German front where it is more useful, and still achieves the English
goal of guaranteeing the destruction of France, thus everybody is happy
(expect poor ole Hohn of course) (<:.

Is this acceptable to you Cal?

I agree with Dave (not surprisingly).  I didn't say so because at this
point if I get attacked, Dave throws Jamie the game and so in the end
it doesn't matter to me all that much.  However, if there is any way
to avoid such scary-looking fleets and still allow that Cal finish off
Hohn, I think we'd all feel better about everything.  I know I would,
at least.  I'm all for any such alternate plan.

My fear, to lay my cards on the table, is that this move will look
sufficiently anti-R, but with some fleet swings to the south thrown in
there, and next move bam.  Thus, Dave spends two moves not throwing the
game, and this is enough to spell doom for Sitting Bull (me) and
Geronimo (Dave).  I don't think it's enough, and I don't think it's
in Cal's plans, but there's my fear.

So it's almost like we need, at this point, some big-time concrete
agreement between you two on exactly what moves are acceptable each
turn before the White Army is turned loose.  Since I trust Dave to
look out for my best interests (because he has no choice but to trust
me to look out for his), I leave it to you guys to come up with this
concrete agreement.  I will continue to just audit the discussion as
a very interested party.

Make sense to everyone?

You betcha.  If Manus is willing to go for it (and his followup up letter

see big uses for an army in Ruhr next turn.

Small tactics are especially important at this stage of the game.  Little
things that go wrong can often end up as stalemate lines.  That shouldn't be
a problem given the wide front we have here.  Province by province battles
can either be very satisfying (if you're gaining) or frustrating (when you
KNOW you can't stop someone from that vital space).

Frankly, my life has been rather busy lately (my house got flooded and the

now) so I haven't mapped out my moves.   Orders aren't due until next
Tuesday.  I'll look at things and let you know.  I see no point in sending
my army backwards to get a center.  The fleet will just get disbanded as
I'm going to lose at least one center.  You army should either head for
Ven or Apu (I'll be convoying out).  I'll see what I come up with. Any
tactical ideas would be greatly appreciated.

Either is fine with me.  Apu is only good if I can convoy somewhere useful.

You were thinking of doing what? Building another army next year?

Well, my point is, as long as you know I'm ordering Swe-Nwy, you can hold
in Nwy or order Nwy-Swe, either way, doesn't matter.

My orders have been in for a while now. I've got a WAIT flag set, but I'm
happy with the orders as they are now. But not everyone's orders are in (so
says the LISTing). I'm hoping we won't really have to wait until Tuesday.
Hm, yeah, it would be really nice if you could eliminate Hohn :-). At least
that would get the game going a little faster. Then eliminate Manus if it's
still not going fast enough. I think Dave is pretty quick. Oh what the
heck, we'll eliminate him too, then we'll play a few lightning seasons!

Hello Manus,

Well, I took a look at things, ugly aren't they (<:.  I think I have my
best defense pretty well mapped out, the only thing I'm undecided about
is which of the following I should try:

  Apu - Gre, Adr Convoy
  Apu - Alb, Adr Convoy
  Apu - Tri, Adr - Gre

The advantage of the first is to get the army into Gre, but it could bounce
if my move out of Greece fails.  The advantage of the second is that it
can't bounce.  The advantage of the third is that we could end up with a
fleet in Gre to make a double attack on Aegean if needed and the army
stays in range of Rome if I need to take the center in order to maintain
the forward units.  What are your thoughts?  No matter which we pick I
guess it is best for your army to move to Apu.

Ouch.  No wonder I'm in such bad shape (<:.  That's what I get when
I try to apply my poor tired brain to the problem without a map handy.
I guess the question then becomes between moving the army to Alb or
the fleet.  The army is more flexible there as it can support to Ser
as well, on the other hand, the fleet can't move to Rom or Nap to shore
up the front line units.  Thoughts on that?  I'm heading home myself,
so I'll see if you have any comments in the morning, then send in my
orders.

Kind of a six of one, half-dozen of the other proposition.  I guess the way
to decide it is whether we trust Cal to leave me alone enough to let you
put your units in the east where they're needed.  Frankly, I don't know if
we can.  If we can't, then he attacks me and you give everything to Jamie
and we watch as someone hits 18.  In this case, putting you in Venice
rather than Apu is good only in that it's easier for you to give units to
Jamie and for us to keep them from Cal to punish him.

On the other hand, if Cal truly does see the light (and like I say, I have
no idea if he truly does, but his acceptance of your alternative plan of
action in the west was, to my mind, a good sign, I'm hoping), then putting
you in Venice doesn't make as much sense and we would rather have the unit
fighting Jamie out of the Balkans.

Like I say, it's a crapshoot, with benefits both ways.  Your choice, and
I promise I won't complain, whichever you choose.

Lotta help, aren't I?

Although of course I'm not certain, I *think* that there was a long dry

I think the move to Apu is still correct.  The only thing I'm still trying
to decide between is the fleet to Alb with the army to Ven which has the
plus of the army being able to go to Rome if needed, or the army to Alb,
which has the plus of the army being able to support/attack Ser and that
your army could be convoyed to Alb next.  Thoughts?

Well, that's true too. But of course, the observers don't expect to see the
sort of evidence there *would* be if there *were* such a united front, so
it's not unreasonable for them to speculate that there is one.

My complaint was that the analysis is dumb even on the (false) (??) hypothesis.

Sorry, Hohn, for not writing.  To tell you the truth, I have no idea how
long either of us are going to be around.  We've been effectively cannonballed
and can't even really work together much at the moment.  As far as my moves
go, I'm just looking to protect little old me against Cal, because I'm sure
he's about to swing around under you, and push Dave out in such a way that
if he wants to throw his probably dying self at Jamie, he'll have at least
a chance to do it.

The game looks to be shaping up as Cal+Jamie until one of them decides to
throw the other one overboard.  Dave, I hope, will be able to tread that
fine line of giving Jamie center after center (without dying, though frankly,
after what he did to me.... :-) enough to scare Cal as much as is necessary
to make him break the E/R that surprised me (but not you).

No offense, but I don't want to tell you.  If your stab of Dave was an

Yes, that would be a very elaborate ruse! I wonder what my motivation was

Persistent, aren't you?

Okay, yes, one of my fleets is hitting ION.  I doubt it'll make it; he's
probably supporting from ADR and/or trying for one of my centers.  But if
he tries to run away (in which case, I would owe you one for pulling him
off me before I completely died), I'll feel a lot better if my two fleets
surrounded the boot instead of his.

I guess I'll never know if you pass that on to him or not, even if he takes
one of my poor little dots, so I suppose it doesn't matter telling you.

Thanks for the info.
But you are hinting, not outright declaring, that you haven't given Dave
any clue about that move. Is that right?

I've worked out on my own what I expect Dave's moves to be. Unless I've got
a completely confused idea of how he'll play this, you really have nothing
to worry about. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe his plan is to try to get you out,
and hang on as the Third Power in an R/E endgame. I doubt it, though.

If you do make it into Ion, by the way, on this or a subsequent turn, and
if at the time I have a unit available, I would be pretty happy about
supporting you into Greece. Would that make our phantom alliance into a
fleshy one?

Buona fortuna,

My only hope is if both Cal and Dave give up and let me breathe.  I'd be a
nice little boy and sit on my hands if they would.  But frankly, even if one
of them decides to do that (and there's no credible evidence of even that),
the chance of both of them leaving me be is virtually nil.

Ya sure ya betcha.  If I get into ION, I don't see any reason why I wouldn't

Jamie has offered me support into Greece if I get into ION on "this or a
subsequent turn"  He said, "if I have a unit available" but I think we
can safely assume that he is headed for AEG this turn.  Don't know if you
want to factor this into anything or stick with what we have (you moving
to EAS, which is guatranteed to get you into one or the other, so it's
probably best to leave well enough alone), but thought I'd mention this.

If we're going to put flesh on the bones of our alliance,
can you tell me what Cal is up to?  I have one fleet headed for
WES, thinking it would bounce him, but I've gone back and forth
on that one a good number of times.  He's just as likely to take
a stab at Portugal or Spain (south coast, I'm sure) or even
convoy Belgium to Gascony.  Not that being in WES would be all
that bad if I'm not bounced (I always rationalize, etc., etc.)

If you guys are still in it together (as you are hoping) then
maybe it's not in your best interests to tell me, but perhaps
you don't even know and I figured it couldn't hurt to ask.

Hohn:

BTW, I'm sending Pie-Mar, imagining it will bounce and not expecting to
be able to defend that dot beyond the current turn.  I expect mean
stuff like a convoy of Belgium to Gascony and then of course MAO wrapping
around Iberia.  But if you can make any use of the fact that I'm
doing Pie-Mar, more power to ya.

So you know, here is what I'm thinking.

Jamie knows that I am hitting ION, though I am being vague with him
on whether it will be a supported attack or not.  I am also pretty secure
in the knowledge that he thinks you and I have not coordinated my move
to ION.  I believe he knows your best move is a forward retreat, but
he is trusting the vitriol that existed between you and I to imagine
that you will be trying to get the forward retreat without my knowing
assistance or something, because one option for the forward retreat,
of course, is Naples.

Anyway, I think he is doing EAS-AEG hoping that you send ION-AEG and that
you get dislodged and have no forward retreat his way.  However, as I say,
I am trying to be vague with him on whether my attack on ION will be
supported, talking about moving to WES to bounce Cal, etc.

If he believes you and I are still at odds (as I think he does), he may
change his orders if he thinks I'm not supporting my attack so that HE is
supporting it, in hopes you have a retreat to Naples that you will take.
However, I have not told him which fleet is attacking ION and he has not
asked, though only my most recent mail to him is *truly* vague on whether the
attack on ION will be supported, and I have not gotten his reply to that
one yet.

Anyway, I believe that the most likely scenario at the end of this turn is
me in ION, you in EAS, and Jamie in AEG.  Though Jamie will see that
you have run away from me, I will be able to claim this was just a
pleasant surprise to me and that I don't care, I still want my pound
of Austrian flesh.  Thus, I tell him I will take him up on his offer for
support into Greece.

Instead, though, we send either my A Apu or (less attractive) your A Alb
on a two-fleet convoy to either Syria or (if we're sure he's busy with
Bulgaria and supporting my non-move into Greece) Smyrna.

Comments?

Well, it helps me figure out what Dave is most likely to do. That's why I
was actually more interested in what he thinks you'll do, than in what
you'll actually do.

Aha. That's helpful too.

Yeah. I guess I agree.
But even if Cal is heading for the Med., he might pause to try to eliminate
Hohn. So if you pick up a couple of centers from Austria, you could be in a
reasonable position at that point.

>If we're going to put flesh on the bones of our alliance,
>can you tell me what Cal is up to?

If only I knew.
I am *hoping* that he will completely leave me alone and try for the Med.
As I think I've mentioned. I am afraid that is somewhat unrealistic. But if
he at least spends some of his forces trying to break into the Med., I
think that leaves me in ok shape, even if I lose Stp, say. I believe I've
mentioned all of this already.

Where else would your fleet go, anyway? TyS?

Anyway, he certainly isn't giving me details of his movement.

I would be very surprised, though, if he convoys Bel-Gas! Very, very
surprised. For one thing, it's just not a very Cal-like move. For another,
he is too frightened of me to leave himself that bare. And finally, it's
not a very good move. If he wants an army in Gal, he can order Bur-Gal,
Bel-Bur, and he doesn't have to tie up two fleets.

>If you guys are still in it together (as you are hoping) then
>maybe it's not in your best interests to tell me, but perhaps

It can't hurt to ask, but I just have no idea what the answer is. (Would I
tell you if I knew? Hmmm. I don't know. I'd be afraid you'd broadcast:
"Cal, you moron, you did it again, you told Russia your secrets and he
blabbed them! Now let's stop this skirmishing and everybody jump on
Russia." Fortunately for me, there is no possibility of that, because he
hasn't told me.)

If I were playing England, I would *not* go to Wes, because I would figure
it would bounce and I would not want to waste the move of the MAO fleet,
since MAO is a bottleneck. Unless I thought you would be thinking I was
thinking that. I guess I'd randomize, with a smallish chance of moving to
Wes. Which is the approach I'm taking in planning my Austrian attack. Gee,
it's a hard game, Diplomacy.

But anyway, Cal rarely does what I would do in his position. So don't use
me as your predictor.

Sheesh!  You really know how to make a guy feel bad!  Me, the guy who
got hopping mad (with a smile on his face) at everyone else for helping you,
only to be doing so unknowingly myself!  I better shut my fat trap.  You're

I agree with you that Cal is probably still on his anti-Hohn crusade.

I suppose that's not out of the realm of possibility.

Gee, thanks.  You're a great ally.  :-)

Well, there's NAF -- with ENG-MAO, WES is his and I'm effectively dead.
And there's me giving up on any hope of stopping him and turning my full
rage on Dave by hoping he's not supporting himself into Naples and that
a supported attack on ION can have some success.  I shouldn't even be
debating things.  I put orders in; now I should just wait and take it like
a man.

Join the club.  :-)

I have no predictor.  You can kind of tell that from my current situation.

Two comments.

1) I appreciate your good game sense and pity in dealing fairly with a
   dirty back stabber like me (<:

2) Should you perhaps consider moving Rom - Nap instead of Apu then?  That
   would block the retreat to Nap.  We would no longer be able to do the
   convoy to Alb with your army, but we would still send it to Syria.
   Whichever you think is better is fine by me.

Regards,
Dave

If you have a REAL problem with it, let me know, but I want to have a fleet
there so as to keep my convoy options open.  Ca va?  (OK?)
