Well, I suppose there's no point going in for half-measures, and
all... ;-)

Oh well.  You can rest assured that I will happily hand Manus Iberia
before seeing you there.  And if you're working with John as it
appears, I suspect even he will find France quite defensible against
ground invasion.

Let me know if you ever wish to change your mind.

Short of it is, thanks for permission.  Long of it is, I wish you'd
said no, in retrospect. ;-)

In light of naked English aggression, I will need to go to MID and
SPA(sc) this turn, but I'm hoping you will see why, and that you know
I'm certainly not headed in your direction.

In fact, if you're interested in helping me out with one fleet (two
would make me rather nervous), I will promise you that if it looks
like I am going to lose ground to Cal, or even be eliminated, I will
support you into Iberia and Marseilles rather than see him get any of
them.  Please let me know if you're interested.

Thanks,
Hohn

I wish I had built differently.  Actually, I wish _Cal_ had built
differently.  Hell, I even wish _you_ had built differently. ;-)

In any event, I suspect you're dedicated to an eastern strategy.  If
there's anything I can do to get you to come west (or even harass in
the north, as unrealistic as that appears right now), please let me
know.  I'll offer anything I can.  Support into MUN, whatever you
like.

Holy cow.
E/G vs F was the one alignment I had ruled out!

I don't know what I can do, personally. I'll certainly move the A Mos to
either Stp, providing a little distraction for England, or to Warsaw, making
Germany think about keeping a little land force to the east. And I'll be
trying to get either Austria or Italy or both to put something up near Munich.

But to be honest, I'm a little scared of G/E myself and wouldn't want them
to, say, kick me out of Sweden and take Stp....

Well, there's plenty of diplomacy time to work on your problem.

Bonne chance,

Just quickly--
I didn't expect E/G vs F. I don't know why, I guess I assumed Hohn would be
the best diplomat in the opening. I'm afraid I played a role in causing that
alignment. It's my least favorite, because I like having France strong
later, to sandwich either E or G with me. On the other hand, this way you
and I can work together for a long time without even having to attack Italy
if we don't want to.

Of course, a joint G+E could really screw me right this moment, but I have a
good reason to expect that won't happen. A kind of ace in the hole. So I'm
comfortable being so committed southward.

Right, catch you Monday. Hope you're enjoying your f-t-f.

Will do, and we both know that's it's always possible in this game.  FWIW,
this was the best way to stop John from building a fleet.  He was waiting
for some kind of committment from one of us and I guess he got it from me
first.  Also, some who shall remain nameless (damn his Russianness) told me
he had heard you were building two fleets.  I couldn't see him, as a
Russian, wanting to force an E/G, so I decided against taking a chance.

Ah well, maybe it'll be your turn next.  One day we'll have a chance to be
gamelong allies! ("Fat chance" mutters Hohn...)    d:-})

Don't worry about it.  It was the negotiations with F/G that made my
decision for me.

I think it will work out for both of us.  As I said previously, Germany will
be an easy target for you and I to combine on later in the game.  Our main
concern til then will be to figure out how to keep Austria & Italy spinning
their wheels so that they will provide little resistance when the time comes
to take them out.  Naturally the best way to do that would be to get them
fighting.  Any thoughts on that?

Thoughts on how to get Austria and Italy fighting:
I bet you that I don't have much problem with that, when the time comes.

Exactly how I do it (or try to do it, let me not get too megalomaniacal
about this... yet) depends on the situation. One obvious approach is for me
and Italy to team up against Austria, maybe at about the same time that you
and I are squishing Germany. Thus leaving an EIR endgame, which might be
quite exciting, especially the E+R vs I kind of EIR endgame! A second
approach would be for me to capitalize on the paranoia that each of A and I
have about the other, convincing him to do a pre-emptive strike. And the
last possibility is for Austria to be encouraged to build some fleets, and
then go for Mediterranean control of his own (Austrians often yearn for that).
Don't forget that Austria and Italy are already out of balance, and I expect
Austria will get more out of Turkey, and faster, than Italy does. That
imbalance will make it very difficult for IA to hold together as an
alliance. That's one main reason I'm not too worried.

Germany's army-heavy forces are really good for your big plan, too, huh?
He'll be helpless against a stab by you.

I bet he will ask you to support him into Sweden in the Fall. I'm hoping (a)
most of all that you won't do it!, and (b) that you'll let me know if he
asks you to.


Later,
Tsar J

This all sounds pretty good to me.  It only remains to see that neither
Austria nor Italy get too big for their britches....  :)

>Germany's army-heavy forces are really good for your big plan, too, huh?
>He'll be helpless against a stab by you.


It's nice to be in a game where I can HAVE a "big game picture"...  Anyway,
that was another reason I decided to work with him.  He offered to stick to
armies in return for my building a fleet in Liverpool.  Simple enough.

>I bet he will ask you to support him into Sweden in the Fall. I'm hoping
(a)

I'm waiting for him to ask as well and I'll put him off (I hope) with
arguments against the "two-front war" concept.

I will let you know if he asks about it, but I suspect his asking is a
foregone conclusion.  We'll keep in touch.

Cal,

Excellent!

Hohn has already contacted me, begging for mercy.  Maybe we can whipsaw
him a little to get this over with quicker.

Russia speculated about A Stp in a message to me, but he must have felt
reasonably secure when I did not bounce him.  No doubt, you also gave
him assurances.  He's very vulnerable, but I think a second front is
premature. I won't be surprised if he orders mos-war just to be on the
safe side. If we leave him alone in Sweden, he might then take the
armies south.

The tactics are going to be tricky.  I'd like to slide A Hol down the
coast, but that might mean Belgium swaps hands. What do you think of me
trying to get into Picardy, but perhaps not making it?  I think we could
find you another center (Sweden in the fall, if nothing else) to make up
for it.

Tsar J:

I did not receive your message until today. Actually, I found it a bit
surprising that you would prefer F Kie. If I were Russia, that build
would worry me.  In any case, England's F Lvp should tell you the story.
My armies will not be moving east.

As for Sweden, I've already informed England I am not interested in
violating Russia's suzerainty over that territory.

Best of luck,

Freundliche Gruesse, Herr Dreier

I mean, I wouldn't want to have to pull it off alone in the south, when at
least Germany is most likely to be a threat in the west. Although you're up to
six units, you can't grow much more all on your own.

But my statement was only to prove that Austrias position is as good as yours,
that a lot of people would seek his assistance/friendship. I guess I could
also have said: *Russia would like an ally, too.*

About that Fleet: It should have read: F Mar is almost an invitation. For
England, I meant. Anyway, ...

Until next round, Felix

That would be nice.  If we get our end of the board sorted out quickly, it's
just that much less time for the east to do the same.

Yeah, I agree.  Even though Russia is the next obvious victim of an E/G, I
really don't believe in two-front wars if they can be avoided.  And Hohn
certainly does have a lot of fight in him yet.

I'd rather not take a "make-up" centre that will involve us in a war with
Russia!  I'd also rather not jeopardize the good start I've had.  Our
advantage over Hohn stems from our naval superiority and I don't want to
risk losing a fleet here.  I'm sure you can see that.

You're right about the tactics though.  If Hohn guesses right, France will
be a tough nut to crack.  I've looked over the situation and the obvious
moves we are going to make are:

Me:  F Lpl-Iri; F Lon-Eng; F Nwy-Nrg (I think); A Bel ?; F Nth ?
You: F Den H; A Kie-Ruh; A Hol ?; A Mun ?; A Ber ?

What do you suggest?  I'll keep studying the situation, but I'm starting to
think a move to Picardy from Belgium might be a good idea.  I also think I
have a few more hours of staring at the damned board in front of me... :)

Picardy or Burgandy?  Burgandy or Picardy?  Hmmm...

How about this: mun s kie-ruh, kie-ruh, hol-bel in the Spring, then in
the Fall, ruh, mun s bel-bur.

Unless Hohn defends bur with par and gas, I'm in, and you hold hol.
Paris will be overburdened.  If he does defend bur, then you take bre
easily. At worst, you stay even, and we don't antagonize Russia.

Maybe he'll defend bre with gas s mid - bre, which would put me in bur.
If you attacked bre wtih lon s pic-bre, you'd have a standoff in mid and
bre, unfortunately. If you let bre-mid happen, you'd at least be in mid,
which really harms his position.

Well, I'll do some pondering, but those are my first thoughts.

Considering the other adjustments, I am very happy with A Kie, A Ber.

My A Mos was supposed to defend either Warsaw or Stp; now I have no idea
what to do with it. I guess I could order Arm-Syr, Sev-Arm, Mos-Sev, but
that's just so silly-looking.

You didn't put down what moves I'm supposed to make.  From your comment
about me possibly holding hol (Holland?) in the Fall if you don't vacate
Belgium, I take it I'm supposed to move F Nth-Hol this turn?  And then move
to Belgium in the Fall

This is worth contemplating.  Let me know if this is what you meant.

Guys:

France's builds were a mystery, most of all, to me.  I am very concerned
that there is an E/F going on, amid all these talks of an English stab
of France.  There may even be a Western Triple.  I believe the it may
be the case that I have to guard the west a bit more than I would like.
How are you guys set for tossing Turkey around without me for a little
while?  As for me, I think what I am considering is heading for Tyrolia
to test France's promise of help into Munich and maybe sail to the
Tyrrhenian this Spring just in case Hohn's new southern-only exposure
is exploited.

Maybe this is asking a bit much, but what would you guys think of handing
me Greece this Fall, which, if I get Munich (assuming we all three agree
this is something worth doing) would give me two builds and allow me to
feel far more secure about the unpredictable M. Cho.

Well, I'll go ahead and admit that when you asked for permission to build
F Mar, I just assumed that it was because you wanted to build two fleets.
Now that I see you only built one, and down here instead of up there, well,
I'm anxious to work some cooperative efforts with you.  I appreciate
your offer to allow me to fortify my western sea while you get the
fleets into the Atlantic, and I'll probably do so.  And I assume your
offer of support into Munich is still valid, yes?

Didn't want to announce it to Russia, but I would indeed appreciate it
if you were to support me into Munich from Bohemia.  As I said, I am
more than a bit shaky vis a vis the French promise of support.

With me moving to Tyrolia this Spring and with no other army around,
I am pondering convoying back to Apulia.  Not that I think you'll
sneak across the border with that new army, but well, since I have
nothing else to do with Tunis, I may as well use it for unnecessary defense.
Let me know what your plans are, though, because if there's anything better

Well, ya know, I muchly admit that I would just LOVE to see that little

betcha I could almost guarantee Hohn would let you have Marseilles rather
than waste a unit on its defense that could be turned north in anger...

Actually, that was a mistake.  I meant you would hold Belgium, with me
out of there and in Burgundy. I also thought about swapping Holland with
you if need be; I just don't see the need at this point. But I do want
you to know that I am open to whatever makes this work. It's only a
matter of very little time before Russia and Austria weigh in.

What I had in mind was hol-pic, lvp-iri, lon-ech. Then, either Hohn
defends Burgundy, which allows you to take Brest, or he defends Brest,
which ensures my hol-bur. Or, as I suggested, if we assume that he opts
to hold onto centers, you can let him execute mid-bre, and your f
iri-mid succeeds.

Hohn,

I really don't want to come after you.  I asked England to join me in a
northern strategy, which would have given you a free hand to move into
the Med, or whatever looked promising. Cal was not interested. Given
that, I decided I needed armies to at least put up the toughest fight
possible in case you and he were against me. I won't lie. I suggested EG
v F, but that does not mean the situation is irretrievable. I did take
note of your friendly gestures toward me. And, as you say, you really
need a friend right now.

I don't have anything specific in mind at this moment, but I did want to
convey my general perspective.

But he'll have that fleet in Spain(SC) to bounce me. And everything hinges
on whether or not I get into Picardy.  Hohn is certainly a good tactical
player.  Given that the army in Spain is certainly headed for Gascony this
turn, he may try to outguess us by moving A Par-Pic and, if we take Burgandy
off him, just retreating to Mar.  He would then have armies in Gas, Par &
Mar to our lone army in Burgundy.

The alternative of trying to force Burgundy THIS turn would give, as a worst
case scenario (assuming he supported it from Paris), the following:

Us:  A Bel, A Mun, A Ruh, F Iri, F Eng, F Nth, F Nrg
Him: A Gas, A Par, A Bur, F Spasc, F Mid

Not a lot better perhaps, but at least we'd have a guarantee on Burgundy in
the Fall.

Best case scenarios, of course, put us in Bur or Pic this turn.

Whaddya think?

I'm with you down to this last part. We can't try for Pic and try to
force Bur in the Spring. Your army has to do one or the other.

It's a guessing game, as always. Have you thought about forcing Mid in
the fall?

Are you asking for Greece and also saying that you won't help with Turkey?
Or are you asking for Greece so that you may help with Turkey?

I'll tell you, without your help it's going to be a hell of a time killing
off Turkey, and speaking personally I can't afford to take a lot of time. I
have to finish that project pretty quickly or I am apt to have real trouble
in the north, trouble that I can't handle.

If you could spare even one unit, F Ion - Aeg, that would take care of my
problems, and it seems to me that you could still cover your west side. (I
don't see the idea of moving to Tyo in the hopes that Hohn will help you
into Munich, then also moving your new fleet to TySea. Is Hohn going to
like that? Maybe he doesn't have much choice.)

Actually, Hohn suggested I move to TYS, because he's about to act in
violation of our agreement, putting fleets in both MAO and SPA/sc.

So it seems I may have put my foot in my mouth again.  In case Austria
(likely) thinks I was asking for a gift without offering to help,
perhaps you can mollify him.  This not having enough time to conduct
proper diplomacy (work just now is busier than ever) crap is killer.  :-(

Kaiser D,

Is Italy saying that he wants you to give him supply centers so that he can
*not* help us with Turkey? Or is he saying that he wants the centers so
that he can feel comfortable helping us with Turkey?

I want him to help us with Turkey. It's your call, but it seems rather
silly to give him a center so that he can go join in the harvest of French
centers while leaving us to bang our heads against Asia minor.

We need his fleet to dislodge the Turkish F Aeg. After that I don't think
we really need him, though it couldn't hurt. Geez, I really hope Turkey
doesn't order Bul-Gre.

Dear Kaiser and Doge,

Not very much Italian help is needed for the butchering of Turkey, but some
is. Having Italy take some Austrian center so that he can move all of his
units to play in the West does not strike me as a sound plan from the
Austral point of view.

I would like Italy to commit a fleet to the attack on Turkey. Changing red
centers to green ones is a matter for the two of you to work out
yourselves, of course.

Diplomatically, I hope,

Well, if I were in a Western Triple, I would disguise it just about
this way.  I wouldn't want a F MAR build to alarm Italy until it was
in the Mediterranean waters, so I would talk nice-nice about it even
after it showed up.

Cal, however, wrote me saying that any idea of E/F cooperation is to
laugh.  Current intelligence has an E/G vs. F, when this is the last
thing I'd have expected earlier -- we were worried about an F/G and
even an E/F, but an E/G is a surprise.

If indeed it plays out this way, I plan to fall in on the French side,
especially if I can get his help into Munich.  How are you going to
handle your two northern neighbors cooperating and theoretically growing
together?

Gentleman,

Sorry to take so long to jump in, no email on the weekends (which I spent
playing Dip and other games, so my brain is fried (<: ).

Anyway, as to the current situation:

The English builds certainly look anti-French and tend to argue against a
Western Triple.  The French builds argue for France believing in either a
Western Triple or an EF.  The German builds are of course fairly
non-committal. The one thing I'm sure of is there is no FG vs E!

The English builds could be an elaborate subterfuge, although I don't think
it is likely.  However, even in the case that it is, there is no danger to
Italian centers this year.  France has F Por and F Mar.  That puts him three
moves away from any Italian center, thus he can not possibly make an attack
on one this year.  Based on that, I think we should stick to the original
plan and take out Turkey quickly.  That plan of course includes Italy getting
a build, whether a Turkish center or Greece would depend on the fall positions.

The real question is how to go about the attack.  I still believe that the
best attack is for Italy to order Ion - Aeg, Nap - Ion and Austria to order
Gre s Ion - Aeg.  This could fail of course if Turkey orders Bul to Gre,
but Bul will be destroyed in that case and our position will still be strong.

In addition, I think we need to look to the north.  While there is the chance
of an English stab into Stp, I think the greater threat may be German armies
to Sil and Pru.  To that end, I think it is vital that Italy move to Tyr
and Austria move to Boh.  I'm less certain about what Russia should do.
Mos - Lvn, Sev - Mos would provide a nice degree of protection, but it would
also be nice to have that southern army for attacking Turkey.  I think that
is really Jamie's call.

Please let me know if we are all set on this so I can send in orders.

Regards,
Dave

Hi Jamie,

Had a great time this weekend.  Played a good game of Loeb9, very balanced,
lots of alliance shifting.  Pitt Crandlemire and I ended up in a German/
Norwegian draw so it was successful as well as fun!  Got trashed in the
next game of course (<:.

Actually, it opens up both possiblities rather nicely, that is, not attacking
Italy and letting him go for France, but balancing that effect with you and
I attacking Germany together, or attacking Italy, thus keeping him off of
France, which we are free to do because France will be too busy to come into
the Med.  In that case we can again work jointly against Germany.  I think
the second alternative might actually be better as I'm concerned that if
they see a solid AIR coming at them, the west might patch things up to hold
us off.

Obviously I don't know what your ace is, but I would expect that a real
EG would have to make a move your way sometime, there's little chance of
growth for Germany otherwise.  How do you plan to use Sev in the attack
on Turkey?  I don't see that it is going to be decisive and am beginning
to think that moving it north might be a good idea.  Speaking purely
on a "alliance as a whole" basis, I think our best move would be the
following:

Mos - Stp, Sev - Ukr, Bud - Gal, Vie - Boh

That would let you protect both Stp and Warsaw.  If Germany does move on you,
then you're in a position to counter quite well, particularly with a retreat
of Swe to Bal.  Ukr - War, Gal s Ukr - War secures it from any attack.  If
Germany does not move on you, we still have some very nice possibilities,
I can move Gal to Sil and you can actually make an attack on Norway!

I understand of course that you may not want my army in Gal.  On the other
hand, Ukr - War protects it anyway, and an attack on Rum would let you
retreat to either Bud or Ser, so outside of the fact that I think attacking
you would be a rather stupid strategic move, it would also not work well
tactically.

What do you think?

Interesting.

So we'd be moving against Germany right away.

I don't *particularly* like your army in Galicia, but it does provide a use
for that army.

It seems to me this approach might actually produce an FEG alliance. I
mean, it's so blatantly RIA, and as Manus has just pointed out we know that
E and G must be a little uneasy about the rapid destruction of Turkey. I
don't really mind RIA vs FEG, if it comes to that, but I would much, much
rather have Turkey rendered harmless before I open a major war in the
north. Otherwise I'll be torn to bits by EG, in short order. Hm. Manus's
idea of hinting to Germany that there might be a change of targets for I+R
does sound pretty smart. Except for the Vie-Boh move, it 'explains' all of
our army movements, so John wouldn't be forced to conclude that he was our
target.

I'll tell you what, I bet that Germany can't make headway against France
this year. If we wait a year, or at least a season, I don't think we lose
much and the German armies might well be committed further west. Of course,
I could move one of my extra armies (A Sev, A Mos) a little bit toward
Germany, I doubt that would alert or alarm him enough to change his plans.

I'll have to look at my map and try out a few things to have a solid idea,
though.

I certainly like Ven-Tyo. Vie-Boh makes a good combination, but if part of

I am worried about driving them into a Triple, something I don't see them

distraction to prevent those Frost Giants from removing me from Sweden and

To my mind, we've got a delicate balance in the north at the moment and

If indeed France is all by his lonesome now (I am asking Germany for more

as long as we cultivate good relations with France.  France was the first
person to mention an Italian Munich, and I am hoping to get his support for
it (Austria's from Bohemia, though, would be nice and perhaps even necessary).
If we make it clear to France that he can either be in a Western Triple
(but, by everyone's assessment at least, he'd need to talk the legs off a
couple of chairs to have a hope of that) or a ready-made F/A/I/R alliance,
I imagine he will stick to us like glue.

I would hope Italy pays attention to the east as well. I wonder, though,
if he is capable of containing Austria without Russian help. And I don't
see how he can have that help as long as you depend on Austria to
execute a swift Turkish campaign. Italy does have the ability to
stonewall for a long time, especially in that Austria built A Trieste.
It may be some time before he has another opportunity to float any
ships. Still, at some point, Russia must act.

You are asking a rather odd question. It seems to imply you wish for me
to antagonize England so he will attack me instead of you. Be that as it
may, my wish is that England devote his resources to taking out France.
Looking over the board shows me that defeating a well-led France is no
easy matter. A good tactician such as Hohn can hold us off for several
moves, perhaps long enough to induce, say, Austria, to come to his
rescue. In that light, I prefer that he stay out of trouble in the north
and concentrate on France. After that, anything is possible.

 Unfortunately, word from Moscow is that Tsar J wants no trouble with

First indications are that England shares Germany's desire to deter
French aggression. At this point, my view is that we have adequate
forces to do the job. But I will bear in mind your generous offer.

Please let me know if Germany can do anything to secure Italy's

Yyyyyyes.

I'm a little confused.
It seems as though you have just told me that unless Russia eventually
attacks Austria, Austria will have a pretty good game. While I certainly
agree with that assessment, it is not the sort of thing that you would
bother to mention to me.

Listen, I am aware that you would prefer not to see Turkey disappear
rapidly. On this point our interests do not agree! I hope that they will
agree on other points.

Not exactly. Something similar to that.
I was pointing out that I am in a position in which I might just *have* to
antagonize England, with the result that he will attack me instead of you.
Quite possibly you wanted to put me in this position! And possibly you have
succeeded. I asked only for your thoughts on the subject.

Or to have me come to his rescue, is that the implication? He's already
asked me. I demured with profuse apologies. There is about as much chance
of that happening as there is of your coming to Turkey's rescue. (I hope. I
hope there isn't a much bigger chance of your coming to Turkey's rescue.)


> In that light, I prefer that he stay out of trouble in the north

Ok, I think I get your drift.

We're playing similar games, in a way. We each have a tough victim and a
pretty good ally. We'll each have to worry about our pretty good ally
sometime in the next few years, but we each prefer to stick with the ally
for now. Each of us has a pretty good ally who could potentially cause a
lot of trouble for the other of us. So maybe in the next year or so we can
try to do something to break this logjam.

Eliminate France and Turkey, then worry about Austria and England. Right?

That's about the size of it. I'm just worried that Austria will have

Now for a suggestion to make you REALLY uncomfortable (<:

I go to Gal as mentioned previously, but NOT to Boh.  This
positions me to support you to War if needed.  It also makes
the world think that I'm going for the opportunistic grab
(you'll get lots of compliments on your brilliant covering move
to Ukraine (<: ).  In the fall, there are several options.  I
can move to Sil and Boh (assuming I did Vie - Gal, Tri - Vie)
(I'll probably get lots of deriding remarks for not being smart
enough to move Tri to Ser, which is part of your backup that I'm
not setting you up).  Or or course I could then just go home
again (leading to more accolades for you for your brilliant
diplomacy).

The other option is that we could remove any worries about an
AIR by actually removing any chance of an AIR.  I could be in
Ven in either the Spring or the Fall.

I'm not advocating any of these approaches at the moment, just
throwing out things for us to consider.

Looking forward to your own thoughts on it.

Yes, I have, but he'll have support from Spain(sc).  If he absolutely needs
the fleet in Mid to move to Brest, I'll certainly go for it, but I have to
see the results first obviously.

I think we should try the move to Pic this turn along with your move to
Belgium.  Both of the plans we discussed have similar upsides, but this one
shows the least downside.  Therefore:

I was thinking very much along the same lines. This morning, I looked at
the board for a while.  I noticed that if we go for bur while France
orders par-pic to block, he'd be in a strong position. He could cover
every center and support bre. We'd gain from having a ruh, but mostly
we'd have to wait for your fleet to come around. So I endorse the above
orders, even though I think Hohn will order par-pic. I think we'll be in
better position.

I did intend ber-kie. I can easily recover if Russia moves my way, but
we've been in communication and I don't anticipate it. He also wants to
stay out of conflict with you. France, of course, has asked Russia to
rescue him, but Tsar J claims to have refused.

Just in case, I thought I might order den-swe, and tell Russia to order
swe-den. That would pin both fleets and keep everyone honest.

Gentle Tsar Jamie
Just a quick note to pass along this tidbit:  Germany is quite content to
have a peaceful eastern border so you have no fears there.  He told me about
his offer to you of having your northern fleets bounce against each other
and that seems to be quite legit as well.

Anything new on your end?

Manus,

I don't know what to make of England's builds, but I'm not convinced =

Toward the same end, I don't believe Russia's position was seriously =

the situation is much more favorable for Austria to partner with Russia =

I propose the following:  A Tun-Gre, A Ven-Tri, F Nap-Apu, F Ion C A =

You're just full of exciting ideas, huh?

They aren't bad ideas. But what's wrong with the simpler approach, just go
get Turkey and worry about Germany later? We have a big advantage. We'll
kill Turkey quickly, Germany and England will struggle against France for
much longer.

Germany is already in quite a state, worrying (allegedly) about your
potential to steamroll him before he can eliminate his French enemy. (I
think he is at least as worried about my potential, but he doesn't tell me
that.)

I'm trying to see the big picture, and the one in which you and I get rid
of Turkey and then start to fan out (sort of the way RT would fan out if
there were a Juggernaut) from the southeast corner, possibly including
Italy in the Med., or possibly having you replace Italy, that big picture
looks very nice. I'm having trouble seeing any advantages, in the long run,
of striking out in all directions now.

But you know my conservative tendencies. Maybe I'm missing some golden
opportunity?

Nothing.

Not necessarily.  Remember at the beginning I said I have flamboyant
tendencies which is why I thought we'd work well together.  This way
we consider all sorts of approaches and hopefully arrive at the best.
There are strong reasons for not going at Germany right now as you have
said, and there is really no risk to me as all it means is that my
armies stay home and can protect my centers.  I throw out ideas for
consideration, and I certainly have no problem with you saying, "Whoa,
that's too much too soon", in fact, I'm relying on you to do that!

That said, where does it leave us for this turn?  The moves I'm certain
of (I hope (<: ) are Ser -> Bul, Rum s Ser -> Bul, Gre s Ion -> Aeg
You make the choice on Bla and Arm.  At this point I think you prefer
that I not go to Boh and I'm okay with that.  What about Gal?  It has
defensive merit, it has potential for making the west think we are at
odds, at least for one turn, and it need not lead to an attack on Germany,
it can simply be pulled back.  Otherwise, I guess my armies all just
sit in Austria.

Let me know, I'm obviously not going to go to Gal unless you want me to.

Dave

King Kal,

Actually, Kaiser Jeep hasn't suggested that he and I bounce our fleets. But
I'd be happy to do it (just don't inadvertantly order F Nwy S Den-Swe!).

The diplomacy business down south is rather complicated and, in my opinion,
not very important. Basically, Italy and Austria have units they aren't
using against Turkey, and they're trying to decide what to do with them
without scaring each other (or me).

Germany has expressed concerns to me that Austria might go and get him. I
sympathize. But better him than me.

More and more I am thinking that you are in a really good spot. When I
envisage teaming up with you openly later, I feel like I'm in a good spot
too :)

Listen, do you object to Mos-Stp? I don't know whether I want to do it or
not. (I'd better decide soon, huh?) You could have Germany keep ordering
Den-Swe, so there'd be no threat from me. I just get kind of uncomfortable
with my home center unguarded and somebody (even my great buddy) sitting
next to it.

I think the bolstering of your north is more effective, personally; I
don't know John will be deterred by one army in WAR.  Having units in
SWE/STP for Fall will definitely make Cal think twice, though, I
think.  And if they boot you out, hmm, well, I'm not sure.  One bridge

Indeed.  I'm hoping I can pull something off, but I'm skeptical; this
is especially true because time is scarce for me these days.  Bleah.

OK, I've thought about it a lot.  And I think your best bet is still
to go with me.

"He's lost his mind," you say.  I hope that after my pitch, you will
see the method to my madness.

There is no way you will be able to take a center from me this turn.
None.  Germany won't either.  We'll all be entrenched, and meanwhile,
Manus will have my open invitation to waltz into my South.  Meanwhile,
Jamie sits in the east, and he can't help but be uncomfortable with th
EG.  Meanwhile, Turkey is going down quickly, much more quickly than I
will, I posit, and the resulting secure corner will mean that you and
Germany will face real opposition sooner than you can get reorganized
to face that threat.

You know I am trustworthy.  More importantly, you know I am desperate
for an ally, and that accordingly, I would not stab you any time soon,
even though you stabbed me first.

So I propose this:

LVP-CLY
NTH-HEL
LON-NTH
NWY-??? (depending on how you work the stab I propose, and your
communications with John prior to the stab I propose, you might be
able to get SWE or STP, or lull John out of position)
BEL S BUR-RUH

You will be guaranteed to take HOL in Fall.  That's one more center,
one more build to make you secure, than you will have if you go
against me.

The Fall moves are powerful as well, if I see you pull off.  I can
take MID-WES, and SPA(sc)-GOL, and put immediate, surprise pressure on
Manus.  CLY can reinforce NWY before any reasonable forces by Germany
(even working with Russia, if that happens) can be brought to bear.
HOL will be squished, and you'll have a LOCK on DEN/KIE by the
following year.

To sweeten the deal, I will be content to take only MUN from the
German pie; all coastal provinces, including BEL, will be yours.  I
cede them readily as a bargaining chip, if you will leave off of
attacking me.

What do you think, Cal?  It will sure surprise the hell out of
_everyone_, and I think we will both be in strong positions as a
result.  Or you can continue on your current path, and I can promise
you that I will hurl everything I can to try to stop _you_, in
particular, from taking any of my centers.  I will let Manus, and yes,
even John, into my centers before willingly ceding one to you.  That's
because I viewed you as my primary ally, and therefore your stab is
the most onerous to me.  Perhaps you'll take BRE; but then you'll be
facing a Mediterranean wall in the form of Italian units, and a
Germany perhaps flush with land conquests from me and looking for
another enemy.

I'll go one better: I promise never to build a fleet in BRE, never to
station a unit in MID, and to build only as many fleets in MAR as I
need to fight Manus.

Please, just think about it, Cal.  I think it's a more than fair
offer, and that it's a bold move which will net you more gain than you
attacking me.  John will be caught completely off-guard, and will not
be prepared to defend himself.

Let me know what you think.  Thanks.

Yes. Cal will not mistakenly support me into sweden. He wants to leave
Norway, and I thought the mutual bounce would be a good way of helping
him do that.

You are also correct that England could well pose problems for you. I
suppose this means we need to work together to keep both our allies from
getting out of hand.

But your ally might also pose a problem for ME. And mine might too.

I know you know this, but I want to mention it anyway.  If I support you
into Rum, you'll get it.  Were you to also send Vie-Gal, that would put you
in an excellent position.  I am willing to offer and follow through on this
and stick with you.  How long can a 3-way alliance which has only 4 dots to
divvy up stay together?  And, because of your allies positioning, you would
have to defeat Russia on your own if you stay with Italy.  On the other
hand, if you stick with Russia, who's got the fleets?  I guarantee you R and
I are mulling these things over as well.  You may very well be the meat for

Whoops.  Please do not get me wrong here.  I don't have my heart set on
doing any of these moves, although it does seem odd to me to order
Tri, Bud and Vie to all hold!  On the other hand, I certainly do NOT
want to drag any kind of reluctant acceptance out of you that you are
going to resent later.  I do think there are some advantages to allaying
Germany's fears with the move, but the most important goal for me right
now is to make sure you're comfortable with our alliance. I don't want
I/R coming my way!  I am trying to strike a balance between the two
extremes of doing too much, and thus forging an opposing alliance, and
doing too little, and thus squandering the lead that we have now.
Gal has little tactical value unless Germany really does attack you, but
it may have a fair bit of Diplomatic value.  Do you agree, or are you
just humouring me to get me to shut up (<:.

On the western front, I've just received a request from France that I move
to Boh and help Italy attack Germany!  This does tend to indicate that
there is not a Western Triple.

At this point, you wouldn't suppose correctly (<:.  At this point I'm not
quite ready to extend myself into Germany, there's Italy to the west and
Russia to the east and Turkey still down there in the south.  However,
if things go reasonably this turn I would be willing to consider such
a move in the fall or the next spring.  While I know you'd prefer it sooner,
it works a bit better for me as it allows Germany to commit farther to
the west, thus leaving less to face me.  Rest assurred however that seeing
France destroyed is not in my plans (at least not right now (<: )

Hi Steve,

I'm definitely aware of the possibility of the R/I, and I have not written
you off.  Acting against Russia is a serious possibility, although I'm not
willing to commit to doing it for certain at this point.  Having you offer
the support, used or not, would certainly be a solid sign that you will stick
by your offer.  I've always preferred a fall stab, but I must admit that
Gal is tempting.  Lots of ideas still flying around in my head right now,
but your support would make the move on Russia more tempting!

Greetings Kaiser of the north,

It has come to my attention (these people will gossip, won't they?)
that you are concerned about my making a move north against you.  While
promises can of course be broken, I give you my word that I have no
intention of moving north this turn.  The reputation of Hohn precedes
him and I see nothing to dislike in you and King Cal taking him down a
couple of notches.  I've got plenty to do here in the south without
running another front against you, that would just stretch me out and
make me an even more tempting target for R and I.

As to the future, my embassy is always open and any ideas are welcome.
The biggest concern with an EG is of course that you not let England get

Yeah, put your ear to the ground and tell me which way the attack's coming.
I'm working on Austria to attack Russia, Italy to attack Austria and Russia

I understand your reluctance to commit, and I am fairly desperate, but I
won't promise support unless you commit to needing it.  You know it will
work, but you're not sure of the ramifications.  Well, Russia's intentions
are obvious.  As he sends more units south, he'll have fewer to defend
himself.  And as it appears that E/G are together, it will be difficult for
R to defend both STP and War with A Mos.

I remain your hopeful servant,

Steve

Manus,

I was rethinking the situation re France today. Germany and England can
indeed finish off France, but doing so would take a long time. And the
result would be a very powerful England without much to show for
Germany. So if you are interested in poking an army into Piedmont, and
maybe even a fleet in the Gulf, I would not oppose you. Now, I will
protest the action and disavow any knowledge of it to my English friend,
who still seems to harbor the idea that we can finish France off quickly
without help. But just to let you know, if you are not already committed
to the east, Germany would not object to an Italian unit in Marseilles.

This message will self-destruct in 10 seconds.

I have been giving considerable thought to exactly this problem. I have
some ideas.

If things develop along the lines we see so far, two corner powers will
be gone, leaving Russia and England on top. The central powers will have
to get it together, or they will pick us off one by one. Therefore, I
hope peace prevails between Italy and Austria, at least for a couple of
years, until we see how this shakes out.

Yes, I am far more worried about Russia than I am about Italy.  Of course,
one way to reduce the threat of E and R is to have them fight each other.
Should we be able to arrange that we can let them hit each other while you
and I pick up the lions share from Italy and France.  I include France here
because France is a tough enough nut to crack, especially with Hohn playing
it, that I expect it will long outlast Turkey.  It would take some careful
timing, but an optimal scenario would have Russia and England starting to
mix it up in the north while Italy moves on France.  When he's committed,
far enough to mess up the French defenses, I move on Italy, leaving you
to pick up the French remnants.  Then we have a 4 power game with you and
having a good history of cooperation, all of it under the table where the
rest can't see it.  Any English outposts on the continent would be
vulnerable to you, and I'd be well positioned to move on Russia.

Of course, that's far down the road, and no plan ever survives the first
few minutes of battle, but it's a scenario that could work out well for
us.  The key is that both of us take care to not get into a postion where
we are locked into our alliances with E and R.  If we do, we are going to
be the meat in the middle of the sandwich!

Happy hunting, send me a case or two of Bordeaux when you get there (<:.

I'll tell you what.

I will support you HOL-BEL this turn.  I will also forever cede BEL to
you.  Meanwhile, I will send PAR-PIC, while you send KIE (or MUN, but
I suspect you won't be comfortable doing that; just send one of them,
don't tell me which one) to RUH.  Pop goes the English army.  I will
obviously also be moving my fleets into position.  With your build in
BEL, you can build a fleet, and if you can work with Russia, perhaps
you can force another disband by England if NWY can fall this year.

Please let me know what you think.  We can have a safe corner by
eliminating England, and we can work outward from there.  I think it's
a strong alliance, even situated as we are.

Take care,
Hohn

Don't know what I was thinking. Friday? Anyway, I'm back. I took my

light-headed at the moment.

Sultan Steve finally tried to get back in my good graces by offering his
help against the E/G/A alliance that is obviously forming. I'll just let
you guess what my response was. (I try not to insult an enemy when he's
down.) Anyway, I was glad to see it, since it presumably means he hasn't

Yep, I object.  I don't think you need to cover yourself at this point.
Anyway, it's fairly moot at this point as I'll be moving that fleet out to
the Norwegian and head it down towards Hohn.  I suspect this should give you
feelings of warm fuzzies and much security.  If you and Germany just keep
bouncing your fleets, we'll all be happy.  Ca va?

Hey Pope Manus!

Saw your note about being busy.  I can sympathize as I've been on the run
for the last few days myself (puff, wheeze, puff).

Hope you're considering my suggestion to move to Piedmont.  Hohn has told me
flat out that he will happily cede you as many centres as he can give you in
order to stop them from falling into my ghoulish hands (cackle, cackle).

Think about.  It can't help but hasten France's departure from the game.

Good for you.  I wish I could go more often.  I grew up in Stowe and am
an avid skier, but really don't get out as much as I'd like, and my
little local mountain went bankrupt this year, so I couldn't do my
evening skiing.

Ah, good.  I'm not really worried about Italy, but nice to have some
confirmation.  I don't think my move to Gal will fool him at all
(not with me in Bul!) but it should soothe the German fears.  It will
probably scare the beejeebus out of France, but hey, a little terror

Would you mind explaining your reasoning to me?  I honestly don't see
why you think it's in your best interest to continue on your current
path.  You are guaranteed to take HOL this year if you attack Germany;
you are guaranteed to take nothing this year if you attack me.  KIE
and DEN are easy pick-ups the next year; at most, if I devote all of
my forces against you as I will, you will take BRE next year.  At
_most_.  You will not lose more than one season for one of your units
(LVP, specifically) worth of efficiency by going after Germany.
Afraid of treachery?  There's no way I'll attack you, not with Manus
being at my south and Germany with one fleet.

Meanwhile, if you continue coming after me, you leave yourself exposed
to both Russia and Germany.  BEL will be German whenever he wants it.
You will not be able to garrison the north very strongly with most of
your units against me.

I honestly don't see any legitimate reason for you to continue on
against me, Cal.  Please, explain it to me.

Ayup as we say up here.  Lived there all my life until I went to college

was 5 years old.  I basically lived on the mountain for the first 18 years
of my life, skiing 5 days a week. (The entire school has organized ski
lessons on Friday afternoons in the winter, and those who race, as I did,
take two afternoons or mornings off a week (alternating so as not to miss
the same class too much) and arrange to make up the work.)  I raced seriously
both downhill and cross country (top 20 in the state in both) until I went
to college, but the level of competition in the area is such that unless
you are a real superstar you don't stand out (I went to school with two
people who skied in the Olympics!).

Yeah, it hasn't been much of a winter.  I haven't been skiing all that much
lately.  Two small children, lousy winters, and I had to have the ACL in
my right knee replaced last year.  I'm hoping to head up to visit my parents
(they still live in Stowe) sometime in the middle of next week.  I'm
definitely a mid-week skier if I can.

I'm the opposite.  My wife skies okay, but is not really into the sport.  She
feels she has to spend a couple of weekends cold and not really enjoying
herself to get into it each year and doesn't think it is worth it, particularly
given the expense.  She'd much rather do cross country or snowshoeing. Since
I enjoy both (and they are MUCH cheaper!) I don't complain, and just run up
to Stowe every so often for my own fix.

I've skied the Swiss Alps, very nice!  I particularly liked the 4 mile run
>from the top back to the door of my hostel at the end of the day! Utah and
Colorado are also rather nice, and quite different.  I spent a week in Utah
skiing Alta and Snowbird and we had 81 inches of snow at the mountain in
9 days!  The only problem was driving the car up to the mountain every day.
I missed out on a trip with my sister and Dad last year because of my knee.
They spent a week helicopter skiing in the Canadian Rockies!

The old rule of thumb is to learn to ski in the east though, then you can go
anywhere in the world and look good.

Okay, I'm a little slow today.  I just figured out this could be a

Now you don't have to worry, you know the best skiing is in Italy

Doge,

Ok, my moves are in now.

Sultan Steve did ask me to reconsider (in light of the 'obvious' fact that
there's a forming AEG alliance), and though I politely refused I am glad he
asked, because (I figure) it means that he tried convincing Kaiser Dave and
struck out there. He must have tried you too, but I was never worried about
that.

Anderkaiser John-Jeep also expressed a lot of concern about Austria's
plans, but none about yours (oddly, ironically).

I hope you'll be prepared to talk a lot during the next movement diplomacy
period. It might just possibly be a key moment. I understand you're
currently busy with the infantile distractions we've all been conditioned
to call 'work'.


Buona fortuna,

Skiing:
Wow, you grew up in Stowe!
I grew up in Manhattan. I never skied until I was an adult, and I've only
skied in Vermont twice. This time we went to Wachusett, which is pretty
good by my standards (although all the snow was manmade, that part was
lousy). There were no lift lines at all, no crowds whatsoever. This winter
has been awful for skiing, though for just that reason the slopes have been
uncrowded, and midweek is really empty. Our 'local mountain' (which is just

got it right here in my special circular file (<:.

For the record, I am sending Ser to Bul.  Isn't that handy!

I'm also sending Vie - Gal as agreed, then to take the pressure off you
and provide support for Gre in the fall in case I need it, or support
for Italy to Gre if decide on that, I'm sending Bud - Ser.  Tri is
staying put so Bud will be empty.

If any of that is a surprise/problem let me know!

Cal,

Hohn has offered to support hol-bel. He'll order par-pic, thus wiping
out your army. If I go through with the orders we agreed on, this will
happen, even though it's not my intent to harm you.

The obvious thing to do is to change our orders to bel s mun-bur. OTOH,
tactically, we'd be no worse off if we go as planned. Your army would be
replaced by mine, and France's armies would stay in par and bur. I could
then order bel-bur in the fall and in all likelihood take it. You'd
still own Belgium, of course. In re diplomatic aspects, this would also
appear to Hohn as a friendly gesture on my part. This might result in
some real gains in the fall. And you could build another fleet.

It's your call.

Glad I sent them to you then, I don't want you feeling you've gotten
a rude surprise!  Where and how are things different than you expected?
I can change if needed.  I assume you're talking about my being in Tri
and Ser rather than Tri and Vie?  That's about the only place I see where
I could do anything different!  I thought there would be some advantage
to our having a unit in Ser.  It provides an extra support for Gre/Bul, or
even allows a supported attack on Bul, thus allowing Bul to attack Con
if the support cut is needed, but I don't have to do it if you'd prefer
otherwise.

Yes, that was the surprise.

The concern is that you'll have three units bordering Rumania and also have
all those retreats (Rum-Bud, Rum-Ser) covered.

I understand why you want the army in Serbia. Actually, I wouldn't be
worried about Greece; the main thing as I see it is that if Turkey orders
Bul-Gre, so that he isn't kicked out of Aegean, you'll need some support
around Bulgaria. (For the reason you said, that I'm going to want you to
order Bul-Con in the Fall.) Hm, but I could just do Rum S Gre-Bul.

I think your moving to Serbia is marginally better for The Alliance, but
only marginally. I don't know what to tell you.

My thinking on support for Greece is in some regards in reference to
Italy.  If it doesn't look like Italy is going to get a Turkish center,
we need to decide if we are going to give him one of mine.  I'd prefer
that to be my decision, not a decision he can make on his own, possibly
with Turkish support.

> I think your moving to Serbia is marginally better for The Alliance, but

Well, they say adversity makes one stronger.  If we go this way, and I don't
stab you, which is what is going to happen as I honestly have zero intention
of attacking you, then you can feel that much more secure in knowing I
passed up a slight advantage (<:.  I could I suppose order the army to
Albania, but that would nullify most of the benefit of going to Gal, which
is to convince the west that there may be some contention between us.

BTW, we should probably have a consistent story to present the west after
this move.  My suggested scenario is that you let them know that the move
to Gal was a surprise to you.  Tell them that I justified it to you by
saying that I noticed at the last minute the possibility of the Germany
attack on Warsaw and wanted to be in a position to help you.  If asked,
I on the other hand, will explain that I have told you the above but I
really went there in the hopes that I might be able to just walk into
Warsaw as I though you were going to move to Stp and Arm (feel free to tell
them you told me that) and that your move to Ukr was a surprise to me.
Then we can "patch things up" for the moment, but will have left the
impression that we are an uneasy alliance at best.

Hm. That sounds ok.

Let's see, for one thing I believe that for full-blooded realism I might
just refuse to explain anything to the Other Powers (except Italy). I think
that's what I would do if you really took me by surprise.
For another thing, I don't want Germany or England to get the idea that I
am suddenly very vulnerable. I want them to think that I am strong and
merely leaving them both alone out of pure goodwill. That I have
essentially nothing to worry about, so that if attacked in the north I
would retaliate very hard.

But as long as you don't give a strong impression that you mean to attack,
and as long as you leave it open that if I were attacked elsewhere you
would leave me alone, that should be fine. Again, I think it would be
unrealistic for you to tell England or Germany much about what your plans
are, you surely wouldn't do that if you really intended to attack Warsaw.
(Would you?)

So maybe we ought just to let the units do the talking. Let them draw the
conclusions.

That's fine.  I certainly won't be volunteering any information.  If asked
if I'll join in on a general attack on you I will say no that I will
in fact help you defend.  The impression I mean to give is more that
I am opportunistic, thus to encourage them into thinking they can lead
me astray in the mid-game and therefore do not need to be too worried
about the strength of AR now.  I'm probably working too hard on this and
should just do the moves and see if anyone bothers to ask as you
suggest.  I enjoy the twists and turns and so am always thinking them
up.  Luckily lots of experience getting hammerred because of them has made
me wise enough to keep most of them up in my head where they belong!

Hope you have a good weekend,

Sorry to take so long to respond, but I was out of town.

I don't like losing the army, but it may be a way to throw Hohn off track.
Mind you, I've supported the move from Hol-Bel with F Nth so it may look a
bit funny, but I don't suppose we lose anything in the long run.

I'll leave my orders unchanged and let the chips fall where they may.
