It's hard to know where we stand now, unfortunately.

I can see two basic ways to go. I could send my A Mos up to Stp, opening
the possibility that I am heading for Norway, but then going to Finland
instead. Then I'd be ready for Swe-Bal, Fin-Swe, which is a good position
for invading Germany.
Or I could move Warsaw, putting A Mos into War behind it. And using that
plan, I could either go straight War-Pru, or I could do the trickier
War-Gal with support, and you'd retreat into Bohemia. Then with A War and A
Gal, I could go to Sil and Pru in S04, while you went to Tyrolia, and we'd
have a big big attack on Germany.

As usual, it's a timing problem, and although I myself am champing at the
bit now, I want to make sure I don't destroy England's strategic position
by dragging Germany out of France too early. I'll ask England directly, but
I think he will say he won't know what timing he wants until he sees the
results of the Spring move. (For instance, if he manages to take MAO, he's
in great shape even without German help, or if he actually captures Bre or
Par, similarly; but if he guesses badly, he'll still have to count on some
German support.)

Ok, so let's hear your wildly aggressive idea for this season. :)

I don't think that's what Manus has in mind.

I was sorry to see A Vie, but Tri wasn't open so there wasn't much choice.
I would like to see Austria try to take advantage of the impending Italian
sailing excursion. On the other hand, I would not like to see him very
successfully take advantage of it.

>About that spare army, tell me how you want this done.

I had nothing particular in mind, only wondering whether I might get some
help if/when needed.

It doesn't really look like you've got a spare one. Well, maybe.

I think I won't do any outright attacking this coming season. I can't get
any really good position against Austria. I'll try to set up a little
first, without tipping the hand too much.

Greetings Kaiser,

Sorry for the delay in answering, I was out of the office on Friday and
don't have email on the weekends.

I'm certain you have it correct when you suggest that Russia is keeping
all his options open.  I can not tell a lie and must admit that I've
been telling him to head north, given the alternative, I think that is
understandable!  However, I've been urging him to head for England rather
than you, the main reason being that I wanted to see a northern fleet build,
not more armies.  Armies can come my way too!

As for myself, I'm still in the middle here and see no future in extending
myself up to the north while I have threats to the east and west.  It
is my intention to remove that threat of a two-fronted war as soon as
possible.  Which way I do it will depend on opportunities that come
available.

All a northern attack can offer me is a shot at Munich.  And we all know
just how long I'd last there!  At this point, my read on Russia is that
he is so slow and cautious about his moves that we may both be able to
grab some centers and fortify our lines against him before he makes a move.
That would then let us coordinate an attack in a year or two.  Bluster a
little bit and he'll probably just sit there again!

Regards,

Kaiser D

Germany has written me in a mild panic believing that the builds you and
Austria made are a direct threat to him.  I'm going to try to assuage his
fears, but I may not be able to.  My biggest concern over this, of course,
is whether or not he will give up the attack on France.  I imagine he'll
keep going, but maybe not with as much committment.  In any event, even
though he is "forewarned", I can't see him breaking off the attack on Hohn
to cross the Pru-Tyo corridor himself.

That said, I'd still like to see you and Austria "temporize" a bit first.

Komments?

Hi Jamie,

I've heard from Kal and it was a fairly positive response, but his big
concern is that Germany is scared by our builds and will pull back.  He
wants to know what the chances are of us holding off on the attack.  Since
we've already agreed that that is probably best, it seems fine to me to
let Kal know that we will do so.  The question is, should we let him know
that we'll be conducting a phony war as well, or just explain it after
the fact?  The second question is how to convince Germany that we are not
going to attack him.  One idea is for me to suppossedly ask England for
help against you, and for England to pass this tidbit on as a reason for
Germany not to worry.

What do you think?  I'll wait to hear from you before responding to England.

Kaiser D

Glad I got that, because I was just about to send something to England.

He told me the same thing, his concerns about German concerns.

Look, it's very hard to believe that John would really decide to stop
attacking France just because of your build and mine. He'd be giving up any
chance of growing. He's got to gamble, I think.

But why am I telling *you* this?

Anyway, I do think we ought to tell England only that we will be happy to
delay any attack on Germany. I'll tell him I intend to pull the trigger in
S04, and that he (Cal) ought to have a good opportunity to stab Germany in
F04. Also that I expect you will be sticking the knife into Italy at the
same time, S04 or so, so that Cal doesn't have to worry about an Italian
navy knocking on the doors of Gibraltar. Let's NOT mention the phony war to
England, if that's ok with you.

I'll use this as an opportunity to put my A Mos into Stp, since that is
probably a reasonably good way to convince Germany that my preferred target
is England, not Germany.


And sure, your idea of 'asking England' for help against me, which King Kal
could then decline politely and mention to Germany, is fine by me. Your
call.

Once I hear from England again, so I can settle my plan for the A Mos
definitely, I'll get back to you and we can make a final plan for movement
this season. And for next season too, I guess.

Hi Cal.

That's funny, when I wrote you that recent "rest time is over!" I had no
idea that you really were trying to catch up on sleep, I just meant that
everyone seemed to be taking a little break while the Judge was down.

Ok, so Germany is concerned. Austria told me the same thing (that Germany
is concerned).

I think, then, that I probably *should* order Mos-Stp. And I will *not*
order any armies in Germany's direction. So the Spring move should allay
his fears, to some extent, since the move to Stp looks a lot more
anti-British than anti-German.

I agree with you about timing; will try to time things so that my push
against Germany comes in S1904. That ought to give Italy time to slice the
French hamstrings, and give you time to grab at least one French center. It
would be very, very nice if Germany didn't get a build this coming year.
But in any case, as I am imagining it, I would attack Germany in S04, and
as he shifts his forces against me you could jump in and steal something
>from him in F04. And, Austria will be just itching to stab at Italy's weak
side, so you won't have to worry about a big navy confronting you at
Gibraltar either.

Sound good?

Sounds good.  Final plans for next season can wait until the results are in
for this one of course, but a general idea of where we are going would be
good.

I don't know, do we want an extension?  With the judge out like a light

in the main our moves are already known.

Yes, yes, yes! ;-)

NAP-TYS would be great.  If you can afford ION-TUN as well, great
also.  If not, I understand.

I am prioritizing slowing the English down, not only because I view
him as my primary betrayer, but also because I think that stopping him
>from getting into the Med is in your greatest interest, and since you
are my primary ally, I want to do everything possible to help you out.
If Germany manages to outguess me this year, so be it; maybe we can
work on kicking him out, eventually.

To that end, what do you want to do with TYR?  Can you spare a move to
PIE?  If so, that will make it easier to defend/retake MAR in fall.
Depending on how things look, I might even ask you to come into MAR in
fall, as I'd rather you have it than Cal or John, if worse comes to
worst.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Hohn

P.S. Jamie's build was disappointing.  I thought he was going to build
STP(nc).

I'm still wondering what to do with Tyr.  I'll do Pie if I can, but of
course I won't take Mar unless you really want me to.  It's bad timing
or I could pass thru it in Spring on my way to Bur to support you wherever
you are, etc., etc.

Perhaps you can head for Munich and try to sell Hohn that your fleets are
coming to help?  That might just give you an extra turn before he reacts,
especially if you don't do it before the moves but after, then apologize
for not having had the time to hash it out before hand?

I'd certainly like to see the fleets going west.  All of us getting out of
the area is fine by me, I have no centers in Turkey anyway.  When we start
those armies north I think we can empty things out a bit.  Maybe park the
Russian fleet in Ank and set up a permanent bounce with Italy from Smy
and me from Bul?  Really it's up to you two as you have the units in
place, but I think we want to get everything to the front lines that we
can move there.

coming to help?  That might just give you an extra turn before he reacts,
especially if you don't do it before the moves but after, then apologize
for not having had the time to hash it out before hand?

I'd certainly like to see the fleets going west.  All of us getting out of
the area is fine by me, I have no centers in Turkey anyway.  When we start
those armies north I think we can empty things out a bit.  Maybe park the
Russian fleet in Ank and set up a permanent bounce with Italy from Smy
and me from Bul?  Really it's up to you two as you have the units in
place, but I think we want to get everything to the front lines that we
can move there.

Tovarishe,

>I do, however, want to know some of the details about the A/R move north.
>About when do you guys plan to arrive where?

I think the current plan is to arrive on G's doorstep in about a year.
To be honest, while Dave and I have been talking about it a little, (a) we
don't have a perfectly definite plan, and (b) I don't think you (Manus)
really need to know any details, and just as a general policy I'd rather
not have you know too much. (Otherwise when John makes the brilliant guess
I just know he will make, I will have to suspect that Manus spilled the
beans. :-) )


>The take of Smy is a given.  Jamie, will you be supporting me in?

I would like to support you in the *Fall*, if you don't mind.
The reason is that I would prefer not to see Turkey retreat to Armenia in
the Summer, since I would then have to spend another unit preventing him
>from going to Sevastopol.

Is that ok?

I got confused in the middle.

By 'west' did you mean 'east'? And why *two* Italian units?

Since you don't have a whole lot of units, I'm afraid you are going to have
to either trust me, or trust Dave, or forget about taking French centers.
But it's up to you, of course. Any way you want to do it is fine with me.
I certainly don't intend to leave more than a single unit in the Turkey
vicinity myself. Then again, I only have one of the centers (he said
resentfully).

I guess the only reason I'm asking is to make sure that you're talking
about it and that Dave has something definite to do with Tri.  Those

Everyone in the west wants to see it go to Piedmont.  The Venetians wouldn't

Okay, I'll push the long wood hard left this turn and leave the army in place
for a fall take of Smy.  And I'll depend on the good faith of my allies that
my Turkish holdings are kept sacrosanct.  However, just like you don't want
to move into Germany too fast, I don't want to move west so fast that any turn
we make on Dave in the future can't be done without a lot of mess.

Uhhh.....

Too many negatives for me to parse!

Ok, I got it now.

I think the key will be to time it properly, so that you can get over and
grab a French center or two, but Dave doesn't have a chance to grab German
centers. This will be the tricky part. If he gets more centers, it may be
quite difficult to stab him effectively, no matter where your units are.
And of course at *some* point, if all goes according to plan, at least one
of us is going to have to start worrying about England....

Go to Pie if you desire.  The one suggestion I had was to do Tyr - Mun
in the spring and to try and suggest to Hohn that you were moving the
fleets west to support him.  I suppose you could equally suggest that
you moved to Pie to support Mar, might be a little harder to sell.

Trieste is just happy as can be.  They hate to swim and wouldn't know
what to do in those canals (<:.

Frankly, I'll run on the need to know principle as well.  If I REALLY
need to by in Tyr, I'll support myself there, but I don't think it's an
issue, so do as you will, but we'll rule out any foray's towards each
other's territory.

This sounds right to me.  I think you need those fleets heading west
(towards MAO) as fast as possible, so using just the army in Turkey
makes sense.  That Turkish retreat does look annoying, waiting till
fall sounds smart, but that's up to you two.

Just a quick note til I can get to my other mail.

I've thought it over and I really DON'T want you to move to St Pete's.

Reasons?

1- If you move there, it forces me to show at least SOME military reaction,
or

2- Our alliance will be revealed far too early and I'll lose all credibility

Russia says he wants to sit tight for a turn. Austria seems inclined to
expect as much. My read is that they are eyeing one another warily. I
don't think they will attack me this turn.

Italy will probably move to Piedmont and Tyrrhenian, so as to grab
Marseilles. It's really the only thing he has going. Russia says he
hopes Austria will take advantage. I have no reason to expect Austria
will. This could be the year of the Phony War in the East.

Use all your forces to take Mid. I will take a shot at Marseilles or
something.

Are you sure, though, that you want to order ech-mid, nth-ech rather
than, say, iri-mid? Russia is making up his mind which way to go. I
would not want to leave tempting targets lying around, ie, Norway if
mos-stp.

My thanks for the information and the offer.  The way rumors seem to flow

Hello King Kal,

Yes, your original message did get through.  Apparently my response did
not, and do to a need to clean up my mailbox I just managed to delete
the note you just resent me.  Doing well, aren't I?

Anyway, in a nutshell, I think we are agreed about the way we want things
to progress.  I am willing to hold off on attacking Germany this year,
and I believe that Russia will as well.  That should let you get firmly
established in France.

Regards,
Kaiser D

Greetings Tsar,

I think that Germany has been mollified and will continue west this year.
We need to make sure that we have our moves correctly coordinated.  I'm
in a rush at work right now, could you please send me your understanding
of what we're going to do and I'll let you know if I think any changes
are needed.

Thanks!

Well, Cal has just told me that he does not want the A Mos to go to Stp.

I guess I could try to convince him, but given that moves are due tomorrow
I think we'd better just go ahead with the alternative plan.

But I don't have any moves plotted out, I'll try to do that later this morning.

That's what happens when a little aside gets written, but not delivered, for
several days.  Working two jobs is wearing me down, but I have the odd day
here and there to recharge and catch up on "real" life (like working two
jobs isn't "real" life... heh heh).

Which is why I said earlier that, it's so overtly anti-British that I would
have to react to it to maintain any credibility with Germany.  And right now
I very much NEED him against France.

As we've agreed, timing is EVERYTHING here, so PLEASE don't give into the
temptation to HAVE to be doing something like A Mos-Stp.  Your army does not
HAVE to go north this turn in order to be in position for an attack on
Germany.  Right now, the status quo looks okay to Germany and he has even
told me that, after corresponding with you and Austria (and I suppose
Italy), that he doesn't think he will be attacked this turn.  You moving an
army north would change all that and destroy my chance for a good stab.

Remember the master plan!  We have to fiddle for a couple of turns in order
for several things to happen:

1) France must be irrecoverably down and with Hohn that pretty much means
three or fewer centres;

2) Germany has to be pulled out of position just enough that you have a
better shot at him for the initial attack;

3) Italy has to be pulled far enough west that Austria (with a little nudge
>from you) cannot resist the temptation any longer (that will be hard enough
should he be heavily involved in the attack on Germany);

4) Austria needs to be involved with both Germany & Italy to make our attack
on them as easy as possible.  There will come a time when Austria, Italy and
whatever remains of Germany or France if anything, will all unite against
us.  We have to make our initial effort as surprising as possible.

This final outcome, pretty as it may seem <G>, pretty much relies on our
being patient for the next two to three turns.  Let's not give it away just
when it's crucial.

Komments?

I've been trying to pump both of them for any future intentions they may
have, without really expecting them to confide in me as regards you, but I
also get the same impression that you should be safe for this turn anyway.
If they come to any kind of agreement, you may be in trouble but I think
you/we have SOME time

Here's hoping Italy isn't there to prop up France, but I suspect not and
that you are right; he'll grab at Marseilles.

You're right, but I think I have to take the chance in order to have a shot
at a centre for the Fall.  I'm going to rely on the Swe-Den bounce tactic to
keep me safe for a turn.  I assume that's still on?  He won't make much
progress against me in the north should he decide to stab unless he builds a
fleet in Stpnc and I don't see THAT as likely for at least a little while.

Kordially,

It's not likely that Russia will hit you, but den-swe won't protect you.
If you move out of the North Sea, he can slide into Norway unopposed. Of
course, he'd have to guess correctly that you won't be there, which
might be a thin reason to make a provocative move.

There's still something I want to clear up with England, but we ought to
make a preliminary plan.

I think the best idea is for me to kick you out of Galicia, then you retake
it in the Fall. That way, I don't have to send the A Mos into Sev in the
Spring. I could boot you from Warsaw and order Mos-War, so I'm not moving
completely southward, which would rub me the wrong way. And when I retreat
>from Gal in the Fall, I could go to Sil.

The only hitch is that I might rather have A Mos in the Fall, so I can
order it to Stp, on the way to Swe. That I am leaving up to England.

The skirmish in Gal gives us something to do and an overt reason for not
doing other things. The skirmish over Rum might look very unrealistic in
the Fall, so I think that one's not as good.

Is that ok as a preliminary? Then we'll settle it tomorrow?

That seems reasonable.  I should attack Rum, which you should fully
support.  Thus you'd have:

Bla s Rum/Bla - Bul, Rum s War - Gal, Ukr s Rum, Ank Hold, Mos ?

and I'd have

Gal - Rum, Ser s Gal - Rum, Bul s Gal - Rum

Which results in Rum having to retreat.

I don't think it matters what you do with Mos.  We can always have you
try and attack on Bud with Gal, once it moves it is easy for me to
kick it out, just as you are doing this turn.

I know Den-Swe won't save Norway, but the idea that if Russia moves Swe-Nwy
he'll lose Swe to you is what I'm banking on.

Moving it to Sev. For one thing, Turkey might go Smy-Arm, threatening Sev.
For another, it would be nice to be able to give my own A Rum a lot of

The eastern front is looking mighty dangerous. RA are deployed to attack
me, not each other. Italy's build was not the worst, although it means
the Med will be tough to crack.

France, I think, is hoping I'll switch sides.

Mid is still guaranteed, but now you have to use A Picardy. I say, go
for it. Beyond that, what should we do?

Very interesting builds. If I were paranoid, I'd think Russia and
Austria (with perhaps Italy's help) were about to pounce on me. Of
course, this would cut against Russia's request for Germany's assistance
in an attack on Austria, but maybe the Tsar is just exploring the
options. Any enlightenment you can provide would be most appreciated.

Now that the builds are up, we can talk. I was worried that Italy might

did it for sheer entertainment value, but we still have all the position we
need to put Jamie in Ankara and me in Smyrna at the end of the year, and rest
assured that's still the plan.  But Steve told me he would support Con-Ank and
(though I never responded to him), I guess I wanted to give him some final
(but temporary) satisfaction.

I looked at it and looked at it, and it's actually very safe for Jamie to
get the dot back in the Fall, so here at 3 AM I figured what the heck.
Anyway, not to worry.

Just going along with what Dave said -- anything that confuses the west is
good for the east.  I don't know who this will confuse if anyone, but thought
it couldn't hurt.

And hey, I ought to get some points from the observers, too, I suppose.  :-)

If Jamie ordered BLA S Ank, then we really look like we don't trust each other,
and the Fall is as set up as ever.  Either way, I thought it would play better
than just holding.

Anyway, in the Fall (I am writing this assuming Steve did offer the support
he said he was entering and Jamie didn't do BLA S Ank), just send the
retreated unit back into Ank and I'll take Smy.

Would have discussed it with youse if I'd have gotten to it before the deadline,
and as it is, maybe it's just the late-night mood I'm in, but like I say,
we'll have a nice glass of Turkish wine together this Winter.  (Turkish wine?)

Oh.  I did not know this was anything that could in any way be annoying

You're the boss, of course, but sending an explanation of my moves before

Just FYI, I got a message from the Master telling me to refrain from press
after putting in my orders but before the results are published.  So I
thought I would just send you two an apology for explaining my moves before
the results.  It was 3 AM, and I knew I could not stay awake for the half-hour
delay, yet knew I wouldn't get to my mail until late tonight (now) and didn't
want my moves to leave the wrong impression with you.

My apologies for lateness (as I have passed on to Rick) and I will try to
better about getting orders in early so I don't get myself in hot water
again.  My time is just catch-as-catch-can lately.

Anyway, I meant no offense and was quite surprised to find that my explanatory
press would give any.  I certainly hope it did not in your quarters.

Okay, I'm now finally looking at the results that got me in trouble.
What's up with Galicia?  Was that pre-arranged with Jamie and you are now
"forced" to retreat into Bohemia or Silesia?  Or is he (which I must say
I doubt) trying to start trimming our three-way alliance.  Let me know,
because as it happens, I guess if it's the latter, we should start to talk.
If the former, my congratulations on a very clever entrance into Germany.

Well, I'm finally getting around to looking at the results.  I'm assuming
that little act in Galicia is just a clever way to force an Austrian unit
into German territory.  If so, congratulations!  I like it!  If not, then
let me know.  (Well, I suppose Dave will let me know too.  :-)

I think we're in real good shape.  If the observers are to be considered
representative, hopefully the westerners believe that you are attacking
Dave and I am attacking you.

My plan for the Fall is Con S Ank-Smy.  You can slide Arm back into Ank
and, if you can spare the unit, you can even support that from BLA if you
want to.  ...Unless you see something that would maybe keep the wool pulled
down the way it hopefully is and yet doesn't hurt??  I won't bring up the
observer's observation that I could end up with all of Turkey, but I gotta
say that as a pure Italian, it made me smile.  But as your ally, it didn't
cross my mind.  You call the shots for the Fall.  It would be nice to
work it so it looks like we didn't just kiss and make up, but if not, at
least we had our fun for a season.

Happy to have fooled at least some of the people some of the time.

Hi.

Yeah, that looks like it will work out ok.

I will tell you tomorrow whether I think there's any especially good way to
go. I certainly agree that you ought to order Con S Smy-Ank, anyway. (And
also order Smy-Ank!)

The skirmish in Galicia, yeah, one possibility is to get an Austrian unit
into Germany, but there are other sneakier reasons too.

Listen, you may have put me in a bad diplomatic situation. I suspect that
Austria is going to ask me whether I want him to punish you for that little
trick of yours, and to be honest I am going to have a very hard time
explaining why I don't. I hope you will not pull something like that again.
It's one thing if we talk it over first -- as you know, I am as fond of

Rick,

Actually, I was going to mention it to you. I don't like to see Manus
crossing the line, even if he was staying within the spirit of the rule. But
I'm glad that you said something to him *without* my asking, since I'd
rather not get into any kind of confrontation with him during the game. (Not
that it's likely, Manus is one of the most easygoing players I've ever met.)

What worried me more than anything was the possibility, seriously raised by
the *content* of the message Manus sent to me and Austria just before the
moves were processed, that Manus changed his plan after the deadline passed.
And if he did, that really is pretty close to outright cheating.

Hmmm, that was an interesting turn.  I suspect you have little to fear from
Russia for the near future anyway.  I almost wondered if he and Austria were
having a "phony war" at first, but I doubt if that would have included Italy
taking Con.  I think we're facing an A/I here so it beccomes very important
that France goes down ASAP.  My hunch is that Italy is coming to France's
aide as opposed to a feast.

Since we can't do a whole lot to Hohn this turn vis a vis taking Brest off
him, I propose that we try the following.  It should catch him off guard at
the very least.  To whit:  (I always wanted to use that phrase...)

England:

F Mid-Gas
A Bel-Pic, s by F Eng
F Nat-Mid, s by F Iri

Germany:

A Mar & A Bur s F Mid-Gas
F Den-Swe
A Kie- wherever you think you need to be to be safe from the Austrian.
A Mun-Tyo would be risky but, if successful, would drive a beautiful wedge
right between A/I.

These moves may just pop a couple of Hohn's units (and may even save
Marseilles for you).

Whaddya think?

So, just how sure ARE you that you can get Italy and Austria to fight when
the time is right?  :)

Not looking too promising is it?  I was hoping that you and Austria were
staging a "phony war" to throw off Italy, but it would seem that Italy's
theft of Con makes it all too likely that there is a A/I.  I'd love your
input here.

Even if there IS an A/I, I think the master plan is salvageable.  It just
requires that Germany stay around much longer than previously thought.  If
we both play up to him the dangers of the A/I and the virtues of a 3-way
northern alliance, we should be able to grind down our southern neighbours.
Germany can be the meat in the E/R sandwich at a later date.

Aren't you glad you didn't move to Stp now?  ;)

Things sure can change in a week or so, eh?  :)

Anyway, assuming that I am reading the A/I alliance correctly, I think you
and I can still do a good job together as long term allies.  Mind you, with
Italy moving west (and I'm assuming he's there to help Hohn, not to join the
feast), I will probably not be able to help you against Russia, at least for
the near future.  You'll have to find some way to take him down yourself
(Germany could be a factor here), although I MAY be able to eventually throw
a few units north to help finish him off.

The real way we can be of use to each other would be against Italy in, I'd
say, two to three years.  We can sandwich him AND Germany, leaving you and I
as the two finalists.

I must admit to a little concern over the likelihood of an alliance between

wonder just how long this "vacation" of yours is intended to last.  As
previously stated, I am loath to embark on an extended cruise anywhere NEAR
the sunny waters of the Mediterranean for fear of being bogged down there
while the rest of Europe moves on.  I shouldn't think you'd be thrilled at
the prospect of trench warfare either.  Perhaps we can come to a mutually
satisfying conclusion as regards the dispersal of French centres as well as
the, um, shall we say, DIRECTION of our future efforts.

With the deadlines having hit me before I got to a map, I have -- well, I

I almost feel like I deserve the worst you guys can do to me.  I hope,
though, that Austria knows we are still three.  I have certainly not
talked to him at all about any attack on you, which of course I would
have done if I intended him to think the take of Ank was genuine.  If
you do hear from him wondering if you want him to attack me, I'd appreciate
knowing about it, but of course that is up to you.

Shall we simply say that my relationship with Austria is similar to yours
with Germany?  :-)

As to those other coasts which await me, I must admit that Marseilles was
one of the snails I kind of expected would be reserved for me.  I'd like
to raise that subject with Germany, but maybe I'll run it past you first.
Obviously, I have no problem with John in Marseilles this year, but in the
long term, I kind of envision that as an Italian center.  So I got to
thinking....

We might even be able to work it short-term too, now that I'm finally in
Piedmont.  I bet I could get Hohn to use Gas to support Pie-Mar (for some
reason, it seems he's none too keen on John and you), and if you guys knew
this was coming, Marseilles could perhaps retreat into (or otherwise reach)
Spain.  Hohn would sink like a rock instead of a pebble, leaving we
Mousetrap players free to explore those other relationships mentioned in
the first paragraph of this very letter.

Hmmm, I'm intrigued here.  I'd thought of trying to talk you
out of hitting Marseilles so I could take a shot at popping
Gascony from Mid, but this COULD be better.  I think you
better run it by John first as he is the one taking a chance
at having the army annihilated.  If he'll go for it, I'm in,
but if he doesn't want to risk it, would you mind holding off
so I can try MY plan?  FYI, I agree that Marseilles IS Italian

Well, I'm not so sure about that part, although as a matter of fact it
would always be an utterly moot point, I suppose.

The main idea of the 'no negotiation after deadline' rule is that players
are never supposed to obtain any *advantage* by submitting their orders
late. Changing your mind after the deadline passes sure looks like gaining
an advantage.

Ok, "a little clarification" you want, here it is:

I am inclined to think that I will get Ankara back in the Fall.

But I am hardly what you'd call 'confident' of it.

I don't want to make any major re-adjustments in plans until after the next
movement phase, since I am really not sure where I stand now.

The 'offer' of Swe and Stp was, of course, a joke; but I am also serious. I

Dear Kaiser Jeep,

Ugh.

I first 'invited' you to help me out against Austria. Then (behind the
scenes, as it were) I came to the conclusion that I wouldn't actually need
your help and, greedy soul that I am, I preferred not to have you sharing
in the spoils.

Now everything is rather cloudy. As you may have guessed, it is not
actually as clear (that Italy and Austria are about to join forces against
me) as it might seem from the moves on the board. But it is enough of a
possibility to make me very anxious.

You look like you're about to be in very good shape. And maybe you can help
me a little right away. I guess it depends heavily on where Austria
retreats. But I have no idea what you're thinking your next plan might be,
after France is rendered harmless.

I'm going to try to talk Austria onto my side again, or talk him into
*staying* on my side, or something like that. I think I have a pretty good
chance of it. If I do, he's probably *less* likely to retreat to Silesia
(as far as I can tell -- if he's going to come after me, he would almost
certainly retreat to Sil and tell me that he's going to try to take
Berlin). I haven't heard from him (Dave) yet.

Hi Jamie,

I definitely did not know that move was coming.  You can be sure it was
not a joint stab, if it were, I would still be in Gal and I would be
taking Rum this turn.  I have heard from Manus who has made no indication
that he is thinking of breaking up the AIR.  He has asked what was up with
Gal and are we at war or was this a setup to get a retreat towards Germany.

I have to say that my estimation of his skills have taken a radical shift
towards the better!

I've also heard from England, whom, along with the rest of the board I
expect, now sees a solid A/I and wonders about the future.

I don't really see anything that can be done in Turkey.  Either he gives
it back to you or he doesn't.  We can of course take a gamble on getting
one or the other back even if he and Turkey just support each other, but
to do so would risk having his attack on Smy fail if he was playing it
straight.

I was originally considering retreating to Sil just for position.  That
looks more like an attack on you with Warsaw empty.  What do you think?

Let me know what you find out.

Regards,
Kaiser D

Hi.

Yeah, I figured. I just had that momentary paranoia one gets when one sees
movement results like that. :)

Manus swears he'll let me have Ank back, by ordering Con S Smy-Ank. So as
you say, anything we might do together to attack in Turkey would stop me
>from getting Ank back if he's sincere.

I might try to see if I can get Turkey to order Smy S Arm-Ank. That way we
could have Bul and Bla attack Con, and Italy might be really screwed. But
I'm not sure that I want that, despite a certain amount of resentment....

I think that Italy would be borderline insane to try to hold onto the
Turkish gains without assurance that you are going to be attacking me. So
I'm tending to think that he really will give me back Ank. Does this seem
right, or am I just wearing rose-colored glasses?

I agree with you about the retreat: retreating to Sil is what you'd do if
you were planning to attack me. (You would be telling me you were going to
try for Berlin, and then you'd try to sneak into War, right?) I'm sending
out a little feeler to Germany. I have a feeling that if you retreat to
Boh, he'll order Mun-Tyo. If you retreat to Sil, he'll have to cover Ber
and Mun. It's nearly certain that he will build this winter, unfortunately.
On the other hand, he's got two armies in France now, and he'll have a
rough time getting them back east.

All things considered, I am inclined to assume Italy is still with me/us,
and play it the way we originally planned. So wherever you retreat, you
should retake Galicia in the Fall.

Confounded,
Tsar J

Hello:

I was discussing something with King Kal we'd progressed to the point
where we had an idea we thought might be worth running past you.  Here
it is:

I bet I can get Hohn to support Pie-Mar (for some reason, he doesn't
seem to like you and Kal much; I don't really know why :-).

With you and Kal knowing about this beforehand, it can be arranged that
your Mar army retreat into or otherwise reach Spain.

Hohn, then, would drop like a rock instead of a pebble.

That's the long and the short of it.  Kal thought the idea promising (he
liked it a lot) and so we're running it past the key player (you).  What
are your thoughts?

I also think that Manus is still with us.  That means I suppose that I
should tell him the Galacia thing was arranged.  Agreed?

England is another matter.  He's wondering what is going on.   The question
is how much of a tip off do you think it will be when Italy gives you back
Ank?  I don't plan on telling him we arranged Gal, and if I attack again
then I can keep the myth of an A/I going.  Having Manus give you back
Ank would then give me grounds for "switching" to an anti-Italy stance,
which is what England expected from me.  This is getting convoluted!

I've told him that I am not as worried as he might expect me to be given
the moves, but that I am somewhat concerned.

This is all true, of course, and allows England to draw his own confus... I
mean, conclusions.

Why, thank you.  (<:

Yes, I do believe so.  The combination of your move, my attack on Rum and
the Russian kicking me out of Gal should keep the rest of the world guessing.
This had the added benefit of having me leave Tri, which I know was a bit
worrisome to you.  I hope you'll return the favor by not building an army
in Ven.

What are you going to do in regards to France?  There is no way for you to
take any centers, so I'd suggest that you actually help France retake Mar
if you can.  I'd rather not see Germany get the build.

My suggestion would be something like this:

Por - Spa, Gas - Mar, Par - Bur, Bre hold, Pic s Bre/Pic - Bel
Pie s Gas - Mar, slide the fleets west.

I'll leave it for you to pass on to France and work it out.

Regards,
Kaiser D

Two kinds o' komments.  First, my desire to have us as long term allies, and
my belief that that will be very effective has not changed.  I also agree that
our first coodination will be against Italy, then moving across the board
west to east.  In other words, we're still on the same track discussed earlier.

As to the situation down here, it's still very fluid.  I've no real bets on
just how it will play out, but I must say I shed no tears over a little
tension between Russia and Italy (<:.  Being in the middle has it's plusses
and it's minuses.  Naturally, I hope to exploit the plusses.

Enjoy your vacation in France!

It's pretty darn fun to watch the observers talk about us, isn't it?

I see no reason at all to do so.

You and me both.  I think Hohn will support Pie-Mar, and that's one
possibility.  Whatever England, Germany and I decide will be duly passed
on to France with a counter-plan.  :-)

Excellent.

We can do that, although I think GAS-MAR, PIE S GAS-MAR is safer
because it can't be cut.  My preference is to go for the sure thing.
However, if you are dead set the other way, I will comply.

In terms of communication with EG, I suggest you present it like this:
say that you've been talking to me, and all I've been focusing on is
how I can hurt England the most.  All of my moves are centered on
denying England a build.  Tell them the idea I'm most seriously
kicking around is:

GAS S PIE-MAR
PAR-BUR
PIC-ENG
BRE S PIC-ENG
POR-MID

Tell them I'm obsessing over the idea of getting a behind-the-lines
French raider to torment England for the rest of the game.

I think they'll buy it.  I've told England in no uncertain terms that
I will do my damnedest to hurt him more than anyone else, and while
that's true, I'd rather hurt him as a long-term thorn in his side than
a short-term raider. ;-)

If they buy the above set of moves, I have a counter-set prepared
which will kick some serious tail.  Please let me know how it goes.

Thanks,
Hohn

I've now heard from both Austria and Italy and both "assure" me that the
situation in the east is, shall we say, _fluid_?  Take that for what it's
worth; neither implied anything incriminating enough to consider quoting.

I understood the offer.  Notice how carefully and diplomatically I phrased
my response to avoid seeming eager... heh heh.

Kleverly,

Two notes on that.  First, I don't think either England or Germany believes
you are there to help attack France.  They expect you to support him.  So,
don't expect them to do what they say.

Secondly, while they probably won't waste an attack on Gas, the support from
Pie is uncuttable, and therefore might be the better move.  You've already
got a build coming from Turkey, so keeping Hohn's units alive is not a bad
option.

Have fun figuring it all out.

Italy says you and he were discussing a plan whereby France supports
Italy to Marseilles, dislodging my army to Spain or somewhere.

Did Italy discuss this with you?
