Well, darn.

I'd have used a slightly stronger expletive, but for the possibility
that the press will someday be published.

You know, though....now would be a real nice time to stab Jamie.
He'd never expect it.

I don't have that much worth taking, and you will surely soon
live to regret putting him into the Med.  You better think about
putting him back before it's too late.

Because it'll be too late before too long.  Mark my words.

Absolutely.  Some of them can be so dead on one turn and then, in the next
turn, the same ones are sooo far off.

>Hohn, feel free to move Spa-Mar, and Cal, feel free to move MAO-Spa/sc.
>I'll see you both in the Russian-dominated next world.  :-)


If it's all the same to you, I'd just as soon not throw up the white flag
just yet, Manus.  France's fleet will be much more useful in the Western Med
than it would be a) taking a centre off you and b) owning a centre he can't
build for.

Well, as one observer said, A/R may have trouble surviving the next year.  I
don't know that that's so (ask Manus about the info I've been getting from
them...<g>), but we can always work at it.

More later, when I've had a chance to stare at the board.

Well, that turn certainly proceeded according to the script, eh?  :)

In fact, although I hadn't expected it at first, I think that THIS could be
the turn we expose the "master plan" to the world.  I need your comments on
the following moves:

Russia:   A Ber-Mun, s by A Sil; A Ukr-Gal; A Smy-Con; F Eas-Aeg.
England:  F Mid-Spasc; A Bur-Mar; A Bel-Hol; F Nwy H.
Germany:  A Ruh & A Kie s A Ber-Mun.
Italy:    A Pie-Tyo; F Tyn-Nap.

Okay, now MY comments.

1) Taking Munich & Constantinople away from Austria is important.  If we
keep him from a build this turn, you will probably have a free shot at
Budapest from Galicia.  A build in Sevastopol in the Fall will allow you to
cover Rumania and start your advance on the Balkans.

2) I THINK I can get Germany to go along with these moves.  He knows he's
pretty much cooked and I'm hoping I can call in one last favour.  Obviously,
a lot depends on his cooperation, so I'll let you know what he says after I
sound him out.

3) Manus, from his quick note to me this morning, is almost ready to throw
in the towel.  I think he'll do the above moves if I can give him the merest
sniff of a A/R breakup.  Probably need your diplomatic help here, my friend.

4) Even without Germany's help, I think this will probably be the last Fall
turn where we have a chance to do any sort of quick and unexpected damage to
Austria.  If he gets a build or two, his homeland will be covered and any
stab will have to be the trench warfare type.  Also, you're going to score
at least one (Den!), maybe two (Con!?) and possibly even three (Mun?) builds
this turn.  What better time?

5) For MY part, I expect to have two or three builds coming.  I'll never
have a better opportunity to build the fleets I'll need (if all works out,
my builds will be F Lpl, F Lon & A Edi - cool for you?  I'll trust you to
NOT build in St Pete's) to consolidate the Med against the red scourge.

6) Shall I mention your commitment to make the first move?  Nah...  ;)

Komments?

Long shot here, but I have a question for you.

If Russia is willing to turn on Austria this turn, would you be willing to
support him into Munich?  I know it wouldn't bode well for your future
prospects to see a strong(er) Russia, but it's the only chance I can see of
breaking up the dynamic duo.

I'm waiting for a reply from Russia at the moment.  I told him that I'd be
sticking by your decision if you're not willing to make the move (assuming
he even goes for it, of course).

I'll understand if you decline.

King K.,

I will have to study the situation on Monday.

I must say that your suggestion looks awfully good at first hearing, though.

My main worry is whether Kaiser John really would go along with it. I have
my doubts.

My stab will either be this year or in the Spring of next year. As you say,
if Austria is going to get a build I have to make sure it's a fleet or my
stab will be awful. On the other hand, if he's not going to get a build,
this is the move to stab him.

Crucial turning point coming up. Back to you Monday.

but unfortunately Windows now can't find my modem, so I can do any internet

Glad to hear it. :)

I figure it's about 50-50.  If he says no, then we'll have to take a close
look at just how many builds Austria is likely to get.  If we can hold it to
zero, this is the time to do the foul deed.  Do you guys have any
arrangements for Con?  IE a mutual bounce?  If not, you'd be okay there and
Munich may even be irrelevent.  He gains Mun and loses Con, ergo no build.
Am I missing anything?

Yup.

Waiting with baited breath (just had fish n chips...)

Hmm, I don't work Internet tech support for nothing, y'know.

1) Make sure all other comm programs are shut down.  Hit CTL-ALT-DEL and
shut down everything EXCEPT "Explorer", the main Windows 95 program.  This
is especially true for a program called RNAAPP (although this may take 15-20
minutes to actually release the modem from it's control).

2) Remove any modem initialization strings from the Modem section of Control
Panel.  Click Start/ Settings/ Control Panel/ Modems/ Properties/
Connection/ Advanced/ Extra Settings.  If there is nothing there, type in
"&F" (without the quotes).  If this still doesn't work, let me know the
brand name of your modem and I'll get you a proper initialization string.

3) Remove the modem driver and reinstall.   Do this from the Modem
Properties of Control Panel, similar to #2 above.  Remove the driver by
clicking "Remove" and then reinstall it by pushing "Add".  It helps to have
the original driver disk when you do this.

4) If this still doesn't work, try removing the modem and then having
Windows 95 reinstall it from the Add Hardware section of Control Panel.

5) As a desperate measure, RTFM!

6) If even THAT doesn't work, take it back to the shop and raise pluperfect
hell.

My gut reaction is that my only hope for survival is if we can cut a
deal with Austria, not Russia. Russia will have me for lunch.

But this is not my last word. I'll ponder the situation.

I was speaking with tongue FIRMLY in cheek.  We all know that Spa-Mar and
MAO-Spa/sc would give the game to Russia.  All of us except the observers,
I was saying.

My white flag is still packed away.  If I pull it out anytime soon, it will
be to put the torch to it.

Ok, I've been able to think it through a bit.



(From your second mail to me:)

>I figure it's about 50-50.  If he says no, then we'll have to take a close
>look at just how many builds Austria is likely to get.  If we can hold it to
>zero, this is the time to do the foul deed.

First of all, if you actually ask Germany and he says no, the whole trick
may be spoiled. I mean, he might blab, then I wouldn't get Con or Mun,
Austria would build A Bud, etc. Awful.

However, as you've noted, it might be workable without German help.

> Do you guys have any
>arrangements for Con?  IE a mutual bounce?  If not, you'd be okay there and
>Munich may even be irrelevent.  He gains Mun and loses Con, ergo no build.


Austria can't bounce me in Con, really, because he needs that army to guard
Greece. I suppose he could use the F Aeg, but I presume he is going to take
a try at Ionian. (He was supposed to move Tri-Adr, by the way; this might
conceivably be a trick to have Tri occupied in the Winter? But it's very
unlikely, at this point, that Italy will move to Adr.)
And, as you say, if I take Con, Austria doesn't build.

>Am I missing anything?

As a matter of fact, there is one small issue you've overlooked (see below).

(Now your first mail to me)

>Russia:   A Ber-Mun, s by A Sil; A Ukr-Gal; A Smy-Con; F Eas-Aeg.
>England:  F Mid-Spasc; A Bur-Mar; A Bel-Hol; F Nwy H.

>Italy:    A Pie-Tyo; F Tyn-Nap.

Is that F Mid-Spasc a typo? Or do you know for sure that France will leave?
Seems like you ought to move to Por. Well, I'm sure you won't do anything
silly :).

Agreed. Taking at least one of those is crucial.

As I said, my real worry is not that he'd refuse but that he'd tattle.

Interesting.
Again, I don't want to spread this 'secret' around. Nothing dumber than
telling the whole world you're about to stab someone. Especially if you are!
I suppose I could try to reassure Manus while being very vague about the
date of an A/R breakup.

Here's the small point you seem to have missed. The Italian moves you
suggest are not safe. Austria could take Rome, by Apu S Ven-Rom, Tyo-Apu.

The safe moves for Italy are as follows:

Ion-Nap, TyS S Rom, Rom S Pie-Ven

or else

Pie-Ven, Rom-Ven!, Ion-Apu, TyS-Nap

(so Austria's support is cut no matter which way he tries to take Rome; the
move Rom-Ven is in case Austria tries Ven S Tyo-Pie.)

Right. Except, there may be one more chance. If Austria does get a build, I
feel confident that he'll build F Tri. His army in the Balkans would be
freed up to keep me from waltzing in, but I'd still have a significant
advantage. The problem, I think, would be that I would be building an army
this Winter, and Austria will know that means trouble. (He thinks I'll
build F Stp, of course. I haven't been botching up my diplomacy with him,
you know.) As I hinted, my idea would be to begin my stab in the Spring.
But not in the Winter!

Yes, those are the builds for you that I would prefer. And no, I won't
build in Stp! (Even if by some miracle I got four builds, I would waive the
fourth. Of course, I can't get four. Earlier I considered Sev-Rum instead
of Sev-Ukr, in which case I'd have had a chance for a bigger stab; but I
decided it telegraphed the stab too much.)

>6) Shall I mention your commitment to make the first move?  Nah...  ;)

:-)
I will, for sure.

And I do feel that this is very likely the right moment, too. I still have
*some* small doubt, still have *some* feeling that I ought to wait and do a
Spring stab after Austria has built a fleet. I know you probably don't want
another fleet in the Med, but I assure you he would be disbanding fleets in
seasons to come! I'll rethink things a couple of times this week, in any
case.

Tsar J

p.s. Thanks for the modem tips. None of them worked, so I'm afraid I'll
have to build F Stp.

Actually, here's the deal. The computer sometimes thinks that the COMM2
port doesn't work or doesn't exist. (My wife does all this stuff, she's the
computer pro in the family, so try to bear with me.) In the control panel,
the COMM2 port exists and appears to be installed correctly. Johanna says
when she tries the diagnostic, typing "MODE COMM2", it says "ILLEGAL NAME".

I think she's taking it in today, to the place that replaced the
motherboard and did the upgrade. They swear they had the modem working, but
I suspect that's just what they always say, "Sure, we got it to work fine
here."

So.

I was a little disappointed that your fleet Tri didn't move, but it seems
rather unlikely that Italy would try to move to Adr this season, so I'm not
too worried.

I could conceivably get both Den and Kie, though it's not likely. Hm.
England is going to get three builds. If he builds F Lvp and an army, then
one fleet will come toward me if I build F Stp. And he'll try to make it
difficult for me to take Kie next year. The result would probably be that I
snag Nwy but have to fight to hold it rather than making more progress. If
I wait, I can probably get him to shift those fleets west and southwest a
little, and there's a fair chance he won't build *next* year. And I think
he'd let/help me take Kie.

I dunno. What do you think about having A Mun S GERMAN A Kie, and I go for
Kiel so I get no build?

If I were you I'd go for position rather than try for an Italian center
this year, but if you want to try for it I have no objection. (Just BTF.)

Greetings King,

Well, seems things went according to plan, always a surprise!

I do of course still have my concerns about Russia.  While he could not
launch much of a stab this year, only acquiring one center, he could
position well for an attack next year.  I think it would be a big help
to both of us if he did not get a build this year.  Unfortunately, the
German moves did not make this an easy task.  Germany can still defend
his centers against Russia with the following:

Kie - Den, Ska s Kie - Den, Ruh - Kie, Hol s Ruh - Kie

The only danger would be Bal, Ber and Mun all attacking Kie, and I think
I can arrange for that not to happen (<:.

Do you think you can arrange something like this?  Do you feel that you
need to attack Germany this year?  If you attacked Hol, the above would
fail.  You could try to convince Germany to attack Kie from Hol,
but I'm not sure what the rational would be.

I'd really prefer to not see a Russian build.  If there is going to be
one, then I need to know so I can prepare my own defenses better.

Regards,
Kaiser D

I went around and around on how I should launch the attack.  If he'd bounced
me in Apu it would have been a pain.  However, since it worked I think it
was a good move and gives me the best attack.  I don't think he'll go to
Adriatic, he needs to worry about Nap and Rom.

I did have some concern as this has left me even more open to your forces.
Why did the army move from Sev?  I assume it will return there in the Fall?

There are a number of ways that you could get no build, a lot depending on
what England does.  If he and I stay out of it, then Germany can still
protect Kiel and Denmark.  If England tries to grab Hol, then things get
trickier.

Perhaps I can use this to put England more at ease.  Suggesting that he
move so as to deny you the build without making an overtly hostile move.
That would help to convince him that he's not facing an already accomplished
AR.  What do you think?

I can certainly consider supporting Germany.  It might look a bit odd however
if I did that then built a fleet and made no other moves towards you.  I think
Kal would see something fishy in that.

Only because it wasn't doing anything in Sev. Ukr is closer to action, I
can at least move to War. And Ukr isn't any closer to your centers than
Sev, is it?

Uh, I guess. :) Wasn't planning to. Ok, sure. In Sev it makes me a little
safer in case *you* stab *me*. (Putting your fleet in Con, for instance.)

I think England will try to grab Hol, yes. (And he'll succeed.)

Hmmm.
Don't like that so much. I mean, you make the plan, then you carry it out,
and suddenly England thinks he's got me right where he wants me and
launches his attack....
My idea was more like this: England sees some minor problems brewing
between A and R, and England has just done something nice for R (tried to
help me get into Denmark), so E figures, "Ah, now I can safely leave Nwy
unguarded."

I know, that's the problem.

No, of course not. What do you mean?
Oh, do you mean Sil S MUN? Yes, that's fine. You didn't mean Pru S Ber, did
you? Because I might want to move Ber-Kie.

I guess I had sort of assumed that army wasn't really going to be in on
the action in the north and having it in Sev meant that I didn't even
need to consider that you might do something nasty like build a fleet there.
Of course you can stab me even more effectively with armies, so perhaps
I shouldn't bother worrying!

I do try to keep in mind your perspective of the board as well.  I think
first of course of the possibility that you'll take a shot at Con, then
realize that I could go to Rum, so we both have to worry.  On the whole
I still think I'm rather more vulnerable with no armies really in a position
to protect my homeland.  Of course Manus has pointed out to me in great
detail what danger I am still in.

Okay.  You have three units in position, one of which has to go for Den
and one for Kie.  All that is left is a guess as to what Bal should do.
You won't get a build if Germany guesses correctly, and it should be possible
to arrange this.  Perhaps *I* should leak to Germany?  Or we should just
do our best to determine what Germany is going to do, then make the wrong
guess!

The other option of course is to try and convince England not to go for
Hol this turn and to be satisfied with his other gains.  Don't know if
we could do anything with that.

Option 3 is to go ahead and get the build and build a southern ST Pete fleet,
but I don't think England would find that overly reassuring.  It's so
annoying having to take into account other power's concerns isn't it (<:.

Germany would have to GET an army in Holland first.  Check the board again.

Regardless, a Russian build looks unlikely unless he decides to stab you for
a single centre (Con).  If Germany supports Den with Ska & Kie with Ruh, it
would take intervention on your part or mine to get Russia a build.

I can take Hol without upsetting the German support scheme in Rusia's

As I said, unless he stabs for that solitary centre, I don't see him

Whoops. I just looked at the board again and realized that I had misread
the results.  Somehow I thought Germany had moved Ruh - Hol instead of
Ruh - Kie.  With the current position, it should not be any problem for
you to not get a build.  Just have Sweden support Bal to Den and try
Ber - Kie.  I can even support Ber - Kie and it won't matter, they'll
both bounce.

This won't even appear overly stupid on your part as you need to be
concerned about a joint G/E attack on Sweden, so attacking Den to
cut support is reasonable.  All Germany has to do is to support Den
to hold and everything bounces.  Even if he attacks Swe, it bounces
as the support is cut.  Unless you expect him to do something really
outrageous, it should be a stalemate.

Okay, I have asked and gotten a reply.  Don't worry about him blabbing.  I
phrased it to look as if, although you would go along with the plan if he
was willing, there was only a very SLIGHT chance that you would be likely to
believe him.  Between the way I phrased it and the somewhat wildness of the
plan, you definitely have "plausable deniability" with Austria.  Just say
"Well, what ELSE is Germany likely to say?  He's trying to break us up!"

As to his reply, he said he would rather try to ally with Austria as you
were likely to "have him for lunch", but that wasn't his final word.  He's
going to "ponder" the situation and get back to me.  The phrasing seems to
mean to me that the odds of his going along are now about 30-70 against.

>However, as you've noted, it might be workable without German help.


I think so.  Austria has written to me to say that while you make him
nervous, he doesn't see a stab happening this turn.  All the more reason to
do it, no?

No typo.  I want to have Manus down two centres this turn as I don't want
him to be a factor in the Med any more and I'm very sure that Hohn is moving
out.  Manus seems quite blinkered to the idea that I can do anything OTHER
than try to stop the A/R juggernaut.  Hohn probably has his doubts about me
(gee, wonder why?), but I think he'll play the part Manus asks him to play
(F Spasc-Wes, that is).

Manus has since said his comments were tongue-in-cheek and he intends to
fight on until the end.  Sounds good to me and the sooner the better... :)

Let's leave off the idea of asking Manus for support in the "Munich Ploy"
should we decide to do it.  I'm pretty sure I have enough pull with Austria
to make sure he doesn't dig in with everything he's got to defend Munich
should we decide to go for it.

Unfortunately, this IS the last chance to do the dirty deed with proper
timing for MY units.  I am going to have to commit to SOMETHING next turn
unless I just want my units to diddle around, sitting in Mid.  While the
logical move after I take Spa & Mar would be to continue into the Med,
that's the one thing that will most definitely alienate Austria.  Best you
get it started this turn so I can charge into Wes & Lyo the following
Spring.

Better he doesn't build at all and we make our move sooner, I think.  Like I

momentum we could get if we go for it this turn.

Probably have to remove and reinstall the Com Port, I imagine.  If none of

The sixth Tuesday of any month is good.  (<:

Have you given any thought to next year yet?  I'm not going to have the
units in position to hit Russia as I doubt I'll get anything from Italy
this year.  Next year should give me some and let me get set up.  I know
that he's got an eye on Den and Kie.  That would only leave Por for you
to pick up, and other than that you'll either need to head into the
Med (NOT good!) or start a move on Russia.  Do you anticipate just taking
the one center leaving just the three of us and Manus with a center or
two, or do you think it make sense to contest for Kie and Den.

In many ways I don't really want to know what you are going to do so I
can't be accussed of passing it on, but I do need to have some idea of

That A Ukr is no big deal to me. I'd rather not have it further from my
front than it has to be, but Sev is not a lot further than Ukr anyway,
since I figure I'd probably move it into action via Mos.

>I do try to keep in mind your perspective of the board as well.  I think
>first of course of the possibility that you'll take a shot at Con, then

Yeah, I know. It bothers me a little, but you'll notice that I didn't even
*ask* if I could move that army back to Rum. :) It would be nice if I could
just remove RUM from the map, leaving a big hole there.

On (roughly) that topic, you're moving your army out of Turkey now. I don't
mine moving mine around the back door to Sev, or just to Armenia. Of
course, I wanted it in Smy partly because you wouldn't tell me what fleet
action you were doing, how you were going to protect Gre, but  now it isn't
needed there. (I was also thinking just maybe it could be convoyed, but
that doesn't look very promising, does it?) If you want me to do that, I
think I'd rather do it next Spring, so that England doesn't see that I'm
essentially making it impossible for myself to stab you. That's assuming I
do take a center and build F Stp. At that point I can stop worrying about
little things that might project my intentions.

> On the whole

Maybe, though you are not at all vulnerable to anyone else. That's the
difference, the big one from my perspective. But such is Russia's fate
<sighs, knits brow, looks stoic>.

He hasn't been saying anything to me.
John does want to give me just one more chance....


At the moment, I think my best bet is just to go ahead and try to take the
center(s) and build the fleet if I do get it(them). I haven't decided
finally, though.

Sure, makes sense. Hohn knows that if you're going to take an Iberian
center, it's going to be Spain not Por; and an extra center is no use to
him! I'm a little surprised he doesn't want to go to Gulf of Lyon instead,
just so he has some vague distant prospect of regaining a home center.

I see that. But, remember, even if I don't decide to go for it this move,
I'll do it next move (Spring 06). And your builds won't be very commital
either way.

But I am more and more leaning toward this season for the stab. (Every time
I type a line, I scroll up to the top to make *SURE* I've written "press to
e" and not "press to a"! This is a good sign that my subconscious is
getting nervous, therefore that it has already decided for me that this is
the big move....) (Now that I made the thought conscious, I'm going to be
constantly worried that *you* will send something to Austria by mistake.
Please check fifteen times every message.)

p.s. Modem update:
Apparently the modem itself was screwed, overheating. The guys at the shop,
having said that it worked when they had it last, can't claim that it was
damaged by the electrical surge! I think we'll have to pay for a new board
only. (Or is that a card?) Now with the new motherboard, new mouse, new
cpu, new board, and an extra 32 MB of RAM, this little deal is costing me a
bit more than I'd thought. Still, we were due for an upgrade, the computer
is 18 months old after all. Wouldn't it be cool if you could upgrade your
car after 18 months for about $200? "Yeah, we bumped you up to 250
horsepower, so of course you had to have a new suspension and transmission,
and we figured you'd want antilock breaks. It comes to $130 plus labor." Of
course, it would suck if it took three minutes to start the car up every
time you turned it off.

I can retain good relations fairly easily I think, as long as he keeps them
up with me!  Since he's expecting conflict with you sooner or later, this
should not cause him to panic or suspect me, that won't happen until I
swing east instead of west.  Next year would probably be largely positional
on my part, although I might be able to slip in for one dot.  I'll have
to evaluate whether it's better to try for one or to let him shift his
attention north and hit for more the next year.  The main question I was
interested in was if you would contest the German centers.  If you are
(I'm now assuming yes), that means no forth coming builds for Russia,
which is a help.

Well, I've been doing my damnedest to poke a stick between Austria & Russia,

guess I better stop dawdling and get my a's (and f's!) in gear.  ;)

Manus, I need to know just how much strength fleet-wise, you want me to send
into the Med.  I suppose we're past the point where it's silly to worry
about making you "nervous" about an English naval presence in the
Mediterranean, but I figure I better ask for form's sake.

Presumably, Hohn will be moving to Wes or Lyo and my fleet in Mid will
follow to Naf or Wes.  I'm going to move F Bre to Mid for sure, but in the
Spring I can move it either to Nat or follow my other fleets south.  I'd
like some input on this from the "Forces of Good".  My personal inclination
is to send both fleets south before A/R can correct the naval imbalance.

Other tactical suggestions are welcome.  John?  Hohn?

Not sure I agree with that.  F Lpl & F Lon looked awfully committal to
France when I built them in Fall 1901... I doubt Austria, who, remember,
made me take a "blood oath" to stay out of the Med, would take it very much
differently...

Next year can be pretty easily do-able for me.  I'll have the units and the
time to position them properly.  Also, contesting of Kiel & Denmark will
almost certainly be on the menu for the Fall of next year.  It's a bit early
to talk about how we'll split up the German "carcass" as the tactics of the
situation will greatly dictate THAT disposition.

In short, if you can have your units in position to attack Russia on the
Kiel, Warsaw & Balkan fronts (or whatever you think will work out best
tactically) we should be able to pull this one off.  Of course, it will be
up to you to maintain good diplomatic relations with Jamie until that time.

I appreciate you asking, but I agree with you that at this point, the more
you can send the better.  Given the unfortunate success of Dave's move out
of Venice, I will need all the strength I can borrow to ensure I can get my

If we can fill the Med with fleets before Dave and Jamie do, we will have the
upper hand and can use it to punish them.  So sail as much force as you can
down here.

I concur.  Two English fleets, one French fleet, and my outgunned navy
all down in the warm waters working together (to the shock and dismay of
our observers, who don't seem to understand alliance play) can hopefully
turn the tide against the two meanies.

Hey there! *sheepish grin*

Well, as you said at the start, there's usually at least one of those.
I didn't even notice, I usually just blow away the responses.

I don't think I need it back thanks (<:.

Please note that I did not say I'll try a low key stab, just that I
might consider one and that I'd probably have to wait until the next
year.  While it is of course embarassing to have mis-sent it, as you
said, we all know that we are all talking to each other.  My goal as
you can see from that is to avoid having to commit to an attack on you.
I have the problem of having to get through Italy to get to England
and as we both know, you two, if you are going to fight, are going to
be at odds sooner than that.

Obviously, I'd like to see that happen because if you two are fighting,
neither of you is coming my way.  On the other hand, as we have discussed
before, I do not see a percentage in jumping on you as England will be
getting the gains faster than I.  Sure I could try to jump you in Turkey,
but England doesn't need to come that far south to get 18, he can do it
with just Mos and Stp.  I'm counting on you realizing that as well to
keep you from coming at me (<:.

I know you are between us and I know that will tend to make you a bit
paranoid, that is one of the reasons I've moved my armies so far west.
I will get only only build this year, and it will be a fleet as promised
so you know you'll have the breathing room you need.  I'm trying to stay
in touch with England about his plans so that I'll know just what he is
going to do in regards to Germany next year.  Maybe after he stabs Germany
this year we can even consider trying to use Germany against him?

So, sorry to air my dirty laundry in your backyard.  I hope it hasn't
strained things.  If I do hear anything specific from England I will
let you know.  I think there will be conflict over Germany for the
simple reason that I have made very clear that if any English unit
enters the Med it will cast an AR alliance in solid stone.

Regards
The Sheepish Kaiser

I can retain good relations fairly easily I think, as long as he keeps them
up with me!  Since he's expecting conflict with you sooner or later, this
should not cause him to panic or suspect me, that won't happen until I
swing east instead of west.  Next year would probably be largely positional
on my part, although I might be able to slip in for one dot.  I'll have
to evaluate whether it's better to try for one or to let him shift his
attention north and hit for more the next year.  The main question I was
interested in was if you would contest the German centers.  If you are
(I'm now assuming yes), that means no forth coming builds for Russia,
which is a help.

It's no problem, really.

As long as you're predicting (rather than promising), and your predictions
are about the end of next year (rather than about this coming turn), I
figure that's about the best A/E relations I could expect, from my point of
view! King Kal has already told me that you seem to be "gearing up" for a
stab. Let's just keep that in low gear.

In any case, I think I'd better try to get a German center now if I can!
Otherwise I can expect Kiel and Denmark to be 'contested' next year, huh?

Just so you don't misunderstand, I won't be contesting them THIS turn and,
since John can hold them himself, Russia shouldn't build.

Next year, however, is a different story.

Fair enough.

Ok, let's see. Hmmmmm.

Yeah, I think I'm prepared to do that.
I mean, if you got three builds, and I got Con, Den, *and* Kie, that would
be a very nice way to reveal the Master Plan, don't you think? :-) Three
builds each. And you'd still have the benefit of my being the real stabber.
Your stabee (Kaiser John) would be gone! Another elimination; that's also a
nice flourish.

Tell you what, I've asked Austria to order Mun S Ber-Kie. If he says yes,
then I'll stab him and you'll cut Ruhr's support, and spend the next few
moves not having to worry about diplomacy, only tactics.

Ooooh, I hope he says yes, I'd really like to just 'play chess' for a
while! And I'm sure he'll agree, why wouldn't he? Even assuming he doesn't
want me to build, he'd have to figure that Germany will successfully defend
Kiel.

I'll confirm later, probably tomorrow, but I think we have ourselves a plan.

Okay, I like the concept, but what happens if Austria says no?  I'm still
completely convinced that THIS is the turn to go for it regardless of his
answer.  Are you saying it's off until Spring if he cops out?

Of course, if he does say yes and follows thru, next turn will be an
all-time Diplomacy classic. :)

No, no,  NORTH of the Munich/Paris line, not including it.   Besides, these

All kidding aside (?), it sounds like perhaps we can actually start

if you're thinking to belatedly just ask for my permission to occupy

Greetings King,

Russia has asked me to support Ber to Kie.  If he also supports with Bal
and hits Den with Sweden, then he's going to get in.  This could mean
that Germany's best defense is not Ska s Den, but Den s Ska - Swe.
Of course, Russia might support Swe - Den and cover Swe with Gob and
that would fail.  Who knows, it's a crap shoot.  But I figured in the
spirit of cooperation I should let you know what I know and you can
decide what you want to tell the German.

Happy hunting.

Since I've been asked to let the King know if I were going to do anything
in Germany I probably ought to tell him.  On the other hand, I can
point out that you can still do a couple of things, like use Bal to
support Ber - Kie, or use Bal to support Swe - Den and have Gob go
to Swe, so it still leaves it as a crap shoot for Germany.  If I don't
get involved it is of course easy for Germany to hang on.

Thoughts?

Well, if you think King Kal is apt to use the info to help Germany
coordinate a defense, I guess I'd rather you didn't tell.
But if you think you must tell, I guess I'd still rather have you support
my move. It's just that I finally convinced myself that I *do* want the
build, so now I'm going to be disappointed if I don't get it. :)

So was that clear? Here are my preferences.

If King K won't tell Germany, then by all means go ahead and inform him of
your Mun support.
If he will tell, then I prefer (you don't tell King Kal) to (you do), but
still prefer (you tell King Kal and support me) to (you don't support me).

I think the odds are about 60-40 that KK will NOT tell Germany.  I will

do so.  As for what you do with the info, that's your call.  Tell Germany
or don't as you think best.  I really don't know which attack Russia
will try, he's been considering both and I can't push to know which one
without him querying my motives.

Not a question we have to worry about, since he's just told me he'd do it.

He also told me that he feels obliged to tell you anything he is going to
do "in Germany". So expect him to mention it. Act surprised. But don't try
to talk him out of it. :)

No?  Darn.  I guess all kidding wasn't aside, huh?

Seriously, though, although you outguessed me on the Venice move last
turn, we're going to bog down very quickly here, and one of us will
have to join the other's cause or we'll just watch the world move
around us.  I could join your cause, except that it seems to be devoted
to my own destruction, so I think the better choice is for you to
start thinking about tossing in with the rest of us against Jamie

All I can see is this:

A Pie-Ven
F Ion-Apu
F Tyn-Nap
A Rom-Nap

Any support for an attack on Rome will be cut and, unless Dave decides to
support one of your units to Naples, it will be left open for a build.

Of course, you'll probably lose Ionian, but you'll have backup from Hohn & I
to get it back.

Actually, ION-Apu will cut any support for Rom-Nap or TYS-Nap, so we should
be in good shape.  I'll retreat ION to Tun or ADR, and build A Nap.  With
you and Hohn speeding into the Med to stop up the gaps and push them back
out of ION, we'll eventually be fine.

One more thing, which probably goes without saying.

I know that the way the game is going, you are starting to look
real good.  In fact, if it came down to an EAR, I would toss all
I have your way.  I'm writing to say that I truly appreciate your
efforts to push my invaders off me, and well, I hope that once
they're off, you don't decide to eat me alive.  :-)  I think
our partnership in particular has been full of all the good
stuff of alliance play, and I'd like to see how far we can take
it.  If I get back on my feet, I hope you will at least consider
an E/I alliance before going with E/R or E/A.

Hard to say just where the game is going to end up, but I agree with you on

Damn!  I've been sitting here all afternoon hoping to see them NOW.  I'm not

Takes half an hour to process, no?

I'm playing ball tonight and going to work tomorrow.  I'll be leaving for up

Yes, but the Judge says that one or more players have not submitted orders.
It says that in a LISTing.

>I'm playing ball tonight and going to work tomorrow.  I'll be leaving for up

Hm. Ok.
That's going to be interesting, because I'm going away shortly after that,
myself. I'll be leaving on Tuesday the 23rd, I think. Anyway, Monday the
22nd will very likely be the last time I can check in before I go. And I'll
be away until about July 5th.

So unless the whole game is put on hold for a long time, we won't have much
time to discuss things in the coming moves. We won't have a *lot* to
coordinate, but I think we'll have at least a few things, and naturally
we'll want to be talking just to make sure our alliance doesn't get too
strained! And there's no doubt in my mind that Dave will be saying
everything he can think of to persuade me that you're going to win if I
don't stab you. (And vice versa to you, of course.) Assuming, that is, that
you have actually entered the moves you said you would, and that Dave
hasn't already smelled a rat and ordered Bul-Con! Yeesh. Can't think about
those things.

So anyway, it's kind of a shame our vacations are popping up at exactly the
wrong time.

Gee, maybe I shouldn't stab Dave after all....

:-) :-) :-)

No, no, I'm in now, I'm committed. Just remember that I have a lot more on
the line this move than you have!

I guess next week I will write you various things, and you'll just have to
read them when you return. Then we'll have a short while to finalize plans
for the following movement phase (the retreats and adjustments shouldn't
require much thought or talk). And then I'll leave you to fend off all the
propaganda Dave will be whipping up. Ugh, don't like that idea. You're
lucky, I think Dave is going to be away just about the same days you are,
so you won't have to worry about my being influenced by his powerful
propaganda apparatus.

Oh well! Hey, maybe we can talk on the phone while I'm away. When I go
away, I don't go as far away as you do!

Sigh.  All the more reason Hohn goes out next season...  John & Manus have
told me that their moves are in and I'm pretty sure Dave's are too...  That
leaves our habitual latecomer. :)

Seems like everyone is going to be away for at least a little while.  Man, I
won't even have a computer, let alone net access!  What am I going to do
with myself when I'm not working???  Probably have to listen to my mom talk
about what SHE did in the good old days before electricity...

Really!  We will have to coordinate fairly closely in the German area
against Austria, but my role there will minimal.

>No, no, I'm in now, I'm committed. Just remember that I have a lot more on

True enough, but we're in it together.  After this turn, no one else will
speak to us again!  (Aside from the propaganda you're talking about that
is...grin)

Frankly, I don't think there IS much they can say to make me turn around.
Our courses are pretty much established after this move.

>Oh well! Hey, maybe we can talk on the phone while I'm away. When I go

I'm only going about 75 miles north of here (110 miles north of Toronto).
Not that far at all.

Anyway, talk to you after the moves which, if Hohn keeps his usual midnight
schedule, will be seen briefly tomorrow morning.

Rick,

I've been insanely busy this past week, and I haven't had time to
negotiate or even set up the board (first time this has happened in a
long time).  I've been working 16-hour days to close this multi-million
dollar deal.  And I'm pretty damn tired.

Hate to be a wet blanket, but having to sort through dozens and dozens
of broadcast messages about sports doesn't really help my time situation
or my mood.

Regarding the game, I think the odds are decent that Cal will stab me
this turn.  And I also think that Manus will lose another center.  And I
also believe the Chicken Little routine about the "imminent" win of the
Russian is a bit overstated.  Manus' mail on that subject sounded
amusingly overstated and had a major undercurrent of fear (fear of me
and Cal), IMO.  Maybe if Italy gets hit this turn, Austria will realize
that further advancement along that front by joint AR action _will_ make
the chances of Russian victory increase, and accordingly A might finally
move against R.  I don't know.

Anyway, for all of the above reasons, plus the fact that I'm cranky, I'm
going to MAR.  I don't like to leave games quietly, and I have a good
chance of having that happen if I go to WES.  I may not last much longer
anyway, since Cal will almost certainly be able to eliminate me next
year, but hey, them's the breaks.

There are probably some flaws in some of my reasoning, and Manus will
undoubtedly scream to high heaven and butcher me in the broadcast press,
but such is life.  I'm tired, and I'm going with it.

Well, that part's obvious... :)

I had NO idea that Hohn was going to move where he did (don't understand it
myself, quite frankly, and SURE as hell didn't anticipate it).

As for my part, that will be explained as the game works itself out.  Sorry
I can't be more specific than that.

Oh, and by the way, was Smy-Con expected?  How about Sil-Gal?  And Ukr-Rum?

All part of the plan?

Nice plan.  (In combination with Bul-Gre and AEG-ION.)

We have common cause.  Like I've been telling you we would.
Get off me before you can't.  You have other problems now.

Mark my oft-repeated words, an A/I which is broken spells doom for both
parties.  I won't say I told you so (but I did).  Or at least I won't
say I told you so more than once per message from here on out.

Which isn't bad, because here on out doesn't look to be too much longer
now, does it.

Now, it's your turn to write to ME.

In a mood (can you tell),

Actually, if Hohn hadn't surprised me with the Spa-Mar move, I'd have been
building three, you wouldn't have been the factor you are probably going to

Oh yeah.  That would have been just great for all of us, wouldn't it?

All of us named Jamie.  You think you can get on the same level as him by
screwing everyone and building three?  Not even close.  He'd eat you
for breakfast.  Dave is his midnight snack.

If Jamie convinced you to do this, I will bet any amount of money he also
convinced Hohn to move Spa-Mar.  Wanna lay odds?

I knew our dislodge of my fleet in Spring was one turn too early.  Jamie
saw exactly what was up and all Mr. Silver-tongue had to do is drop a
little sweet-sounding Russian in your ear and Hohn's ear and look what
happens.

Just look.

Hm. Yeah.
Well, this would be just an awful time to say "I told you so" wouldn't it. :P.
I guess Hohn decided he'd be better off taking his chances with Manus. Or
that he wanted to make some impact on the game while he still could.

But is this really a big disaster, or what? You did take Holland. You have
no serious challenger on the whole western part of the board.

Let me take a good serious look. I hope you aren't going to panic and do
something you (or worse, *I*) will regret! :-)

I am in this game to try to win, not provide "fun" for everyone else.

I've got news for you.  I've been calling the strategy for E/R since Fall
1901.  And that includes the stab of Austria this turn.  Obviously Jamie
went along with the plans because they were in his best interests, but the
"master plan" was mine.

Before you say I was just dancing to the Russian piper, consider this:

If my moves had worked out as planned, I would have had Germany and France
out, you rendered ineffective, and Austria angry at Russia, NOT me.  If
anything, Dave might have been mad enough to throw the game my way.  Not the
worst of positions...

>If Jamie convinced you to do this, I will bet any amount of money he also
>convinced Hohn to move Spa-Mar.  Wanna lay odds?


Well, as I said above, it wasn't Jamie who convinced me.  Unfortunately,
that doesn't mean you're wrong that he tipped off Hohn.  If he did he
snookered me and I'll pay for it.  I doubt if there will be any coordinated
alliance against him (unless Dave is interested).  Your surprising (to me
anyways) snarly diatribes in the public press will preclude the likelihood
of you and I coordinating anything.

Not my ear.  And Hohn certainly isn't so easily swayed either.  If it's true
about Jamie tipping him off, it wasn't the "sweet talk" of it all, but
rather the chance to get me back that made Hohn take advantage of it.  You
are underestimating (if not downright insulting) anyone in this game if you
think simple "sweet talk" can influence anyone.

Ten thousand pardons, Kaiser Dave.
I know the sick feeling in my belly can't compare with the one in yours,
but I did feel all conflicted about the whole thing.

And I know you think that was a stupid time for me to stab. And I know you
aim to prove it.

But I also knew I didn't have much time left before you pulled the trigger.
I *had* to pull it first.

The game is young. King Kal may not be very happy about this. The worm may
yet turn.

Until then, see you on the battlefield,

Panic, no.  But I do have some very legitimate questions/considferations.
All in all, this is probably a lousy time to be going away.

First off, you asked me to let you know if I have concerns about you getting
too far ahead?  Well, I got 'em big time.  In fact, without me getting those
builds, I see you as having little opposition should you decide to try for
18.

Oh, and Manus' little diatribe about you tipping Hohn off?  Well, I thought
of it before he did...  If you did, my hat's off to you cuz you snookered
me.  If you didn't, okay, but the big imbalance remains.

Needing some comments.

Sorry guy.  If my moves had worked out, I'd have had Austria & Russia at war
with no anti-English sentiment anywhere on the rest of the board and three
builds.

First of all, I hope you don't take the tone of my messages as anything
more than in-game diplomacy.  I'm obviously annoyed by the turn of events,
but by your response, I am afraid that I may be personally offending you,
which I certainly don't wish to do.  You are playing well, and beating me,
and I'm just doing what I can to overcome it.  I'm not acting the
sore loser, just the aggreived party.  :-)

Now, to your mail:

Congratulations.  If you'd like, I can start giving you the credit in
my broadcasts.  What do you say?  :-)  My apologies for misplacing the
credit (am willing to rectify if you want the observers to appreciate
your play more; I do truly and honestly apologize).  In my opinion, though,
the game is still Jamie's to win, not yours, and so it was natural for
me to think that the stab benefitted Jamie, not you.

If you look at the board and come to agree with me that Jamie must be
stopped, I will gladly forgive and forget.  But if you think an E/R
will get you into a position to keep Jamie from getting 18, press on
and we shall see.  I suppose we both have different ideas of what we
shall see when that time comes.  I think we shall see Jamie covered
in roses.

Not at all.  I do intend to keep them up, but in no way did I hope or
expect that they would stop us from reuniting.  In fact, just the opposite.
I was hoping to slap some faces to the danger, is all.  Your face for sure.
:-)  My apologies if my snarliness offends, but shall we let it APPEAR to
offend, and perhaps work to salvage something for both of us out of this
mess?

Once again, I apologize for the broadcasts if they simplify things.
They are satiric prose and meant to simplify things to put this game
in some kind of common perspective (mine :-).

Write back.  I truly hope I have not offended in any way.  Am willing to
broadcast any kind of message you would like to see in the way of apology
or explanation for my tirades.  Honest.

Greetings King,

Well, the Tsar has made his move.  It's obvious where I stand, and I think
it should be obvious that an E/R is not going to work out well for you.
Perhaps if you had gotten your southern builds it would have worked out.
It's annoying as I think we could have reduced it to the three of us and
had a good go round, but so it goes.

The question is, do you have any lingering doubts about the dangers of
the Tsar now or are we all set for an cooperative effort?  I would
definitely like to coordinate my army in Mun with your army in Bur.
I expect you'll need to do something about Hohn, but hopefully you can
put some pressure on Russia in the north immediately.

Shall we grind the Russian back into the dust and show him his folly?

Kaiser D


</PRE></PRE><p><a name=24></a>Message from <FONT COLOR="ff00ff">Russia</FONT> to <FONT COLOR="0000cc">England</FONT> in 'pouchtoo':

Ok, I've looked.

Wait, that broadcast from Manus:

I hope you don't think I really did rat on your Iberian intentions. That
would have been a very foolish thing for me to do.
Aha. Just got your mail.
No, I don't think that would have been a clever thing for me to do, at all.
Because now I am worried that I'll have no allies at all. Whereas if all
had gone as you'd planned, I'd have a nice comfortable war against Austria
and nothing else to worry about.
Ask Hohn. Maybe he'll lie and say I tipped him, but maybe he'll tell you
the truth.

So, yeah, ok. It's perfectly reasonable for you to be worried about my
being too far ahead now. In your immortal words, "shit".

Well, let's see.

It's true that you now face significant difficulties breaking into the
Mediterranean. However, you do have a guess next move, for Spa or Por.
Seems like Hohn is more likely to play Spa-Por, but he certainly could go
either way. (If you took Spain, France and Italy combined might have a
chance to retake it; but as a matter of fact, I think they wouldn't. Still,
it looks like a somewhat better chance for them. That's why I think Spa-Por
is more likely than, say, Spa S ITALIAN F someplace - Wes, or Spa-MAO.) If
you can get one of those, you're in much better shape.

Second, you do have a couple of armies to use. It's a long walk, but you
might get A Gas, A Bur before Italy (or France) actually enters Mar.

Third, I will play my hand *any* way you want. I can go really slow,
playing for position against Austria to make sure he doesn't start making
any progress, but refraining from overrunning him. I can work on running
around into Tyrolia, to try to assist your progress underneath Switzerland.
I can build F Sev, or A Sev, whichever you prefer. (Tactically, I think F
Sev is much better, just for the record.)
In other words, I'll avoid at all costs getting so far ahead that you'll
have to stab me.

Under no circumstances will I build in Stp, goes without saying (ok, maybe
it didn't go without saying, so I said it). I'll never move to Ruhr, so you
won't have to worry about protecting Holland. I won't move either northern
fleet to a threatening position.
In other words, I'll give you all the breathing room you want so you can
move whatever forces you need to move (and feel comfortable moving) to the
pressure point. If you want to leave a fleet behind up north, fine, no
problem.

I admit that I'm a little worried now, because I figure you must be at
least a little worried now. Can we salvage this? What will you have me do?

I always knew, right from the beginning, that a big challenge for me in
this game would be to avoid being the frightening leader. I thought I'd
managed to avoid it by a slow, conservative opening! And just when I
thought I could grab a couple of centers without being the big leader, this
happens. Oh well, that's Russia for you.

I just re-read your message again, and gee, I'm even more afraid that I
really did have you worried that I was in some way personally offended
in a out-of-game way.  Please accept my apology.  I'm just saying "I
told you so" as loudly as I can.  As I say, you may still think I'm
wrong in saying so, but the broadcasts are my only avenue for saying
anything right now.  Friendless and abandoned, the poor Italian lashes
out.  :-)

I also feel bad for not giving you more credit for the E/R (which,
personally, I think merits you abandoning it immediately, but that is,
of course, up to you).  I hope my last broadcast, sent in response to
Jamie's broadcast, rectifies this at least a bit.

I am not wanting to close any doors with my self-satisfied broadcasts.
I truly am hoping to RE-OPEN them, and if you are reading into them that
the doors are locked between us, then my broadsides are failing miserably
in their mission.

Okay, three free I told you so's.

I won't bother with the postmortem.  You said it was coming, I knew that
it would come some time.  However, I thought there was a good chance it
would not come this time as I thought, and still think, that it is too
soon.  In some ways, France may have actually saved you rather than
hurt you!  His bounce in Mar saved you a center, and cost England two
centers!  Had King Kal gotten those two I don't think there would have
been a chance to break up the ER.  With the current results however I
think we can turn England.

Obviously, I'm going anti-Russian and I'd like to do it with you.  I
propose an immediate cease fire.  Venice can revert to you whenever
it is appropriate, but I suggest that we not make that a priority and
instead see where it will do more good.

My pledge is simple, to work against Russia with you and hopefully
England.  I'll make no moves solely for Austria's benefit, and if we
end up with an AIE at the end (or AI?) that's more than acceptable to
me as the main goal is to humble Russia.

I'll not bother with defense in public, but I do think you are being a
touch overly harsh in your commentary.  England and I both had plans
in place and we both took some gambles.  I think Russia acted too soon
and I expect we can prove it.

As to the coming moves, my ideas at the moment are:

You retreat to Nap or Tun, doesn't really matter.
You move Pie - Tyr, Rom - Apu, double fleet attack on Ionian
I will convoy Apu to Alb, move Ven to Tri and head Tyr west, probably to Vie.
I have a couple of choices with Ionian:
    Gre - Ser, Ion - Gre
    Gre - Bul, Ion - Eas
I will not attack Aeg as I expect he may try to move his fleet there
and I want to be able to make a retreat into either Aeg or Smy after
you kick me out.

Eventually you may of course want to extract your pound of flesh.  Should
you do so, all I ask is that you wait until we've got Russia firmly on
the ropes.  I took a shot at the A/R and now that's dead, and I'd be happy
to carry the A/I all the way if you want.

Best regards,
Kaiser D

Don't feel bad.  I knew what was coming from you, and I was telling Dave

Well, the truth be told, there you are wrong.  I honestly had not committed
myself to pulling the trigger on you.  Of course I was stringing Kal along,
but you know through my typo that I was carefull not to make any concrete
promises.  I did think that you would wait a turn as I thought this was

prove that.

I don't think he will be.  If you did engineer the Spa - Mar move then I'd
say it was a BIG mistake.  You'd have been far better off if England had
his two builds.  As it is it's obvious to him that he can't be an equal
partner so I expect you'll be all by yourself.

Well yes, but you know it really isn't too late!  You have a nice jump in

England needs turning, and I need you to do it.  I have corresponded
with him at least five times since the moves so far (five each!) but
I am not yet clear on whether he thinks he must ditch the E/R or not.
Especially since I'm out to lunch and then on on-site meetings (granting
the pouchtoo world a much afternoon of silence :-), I need you to take
up the mantle of convincing Cal he has to turn.  Fair warning, though,
he's snaky, because I thought sure he was with me going anti-R last turn
and we found out otherwise.  We need to know for sure or we'll both die.

I'm not ignoring your last note.  I just have a lot of thinking to do, of
course.

Would you be willing to hand over Den & Kie as well as demilitarizing the
north?  That way, you wouldn't have to lose momentum versus Austria by
fighting a holding action and I'd be less concerned about you getting to 18.

I'll get back to you with more later.

>>Sorry guy.

No problem.

>>If my moves had worked out, I'd have had Austria & Russia at war with no anti-English sentiment anywhere on the rest of the board and three builds.


You mean if they had worked out as you expected this turn? If so,
interesting. I'd like to know how that would have happened. It seems to
say the Russkie did you wrong too.

>>I know what you mean by "win some, lose some".

Yes, and things looked so promising there for a while.

>>Cheers and see you in a future game I hope.

No doubt. I'll order up a list to see what's starting.

BTW, I agree with Manus. Jamie will win now. I don't even think he's
stoppable.

They are giving me more 'credit' than I deserve, yes. There are some things
I still can't/won't tell you, but you have somewhat misjudged the
situation. Of course, reality doesn't matter, does it? Only the
*perception* of history matters. Didn't someone famous once say that?
Orwell? You are trying to establish your own Ministry of Truth. Well, go
for it!

If the game is mine, then gee, it's all worked out for the best, hasn't it?
:-) But do tell me how to win from here. My endgame must be getting rusty.

I'm afraid you have forgotten one thing. You have forgotten that Hohn is
The Great Hohn Cho. He needs no ratty help from the likes of me, not even
wearing the hat of the one-center puppet.
Go ahead, ask him.

>Thanks for keeping one of my centers for me, though.  Honestly.

I wish I could take credit for that. I'm pleased to see it!

Don't smile when you say that, pardner.
Believe me, I understand the situation. I think the time may very well come
when I need your help badly. I won't be too proud to ask for it.


>Not a sore loser, but very much enjoying playing the "I told you so!"
>aggreived party, and hope everyone else is enjoying the show,

That's always enjoyable. You're certainly milking it for all it's worth!
Why don't you call Steve and tell him to join the fun? I feel there are
certain small fragments of my integrity that have not yet been called into
question.

Ooh, more from you. Good, because nobody else will talk to me now. :-)


>Cal's a lawyer?  :-)

Nooo, but.... (think about it)

Hey, *any* time. Any time you want to take Venice, Greece, anything, I will
do everything I can to assist you.

I'm not ignoring your note but rather I have LOTS of thinking or possibly
rethinking to do.

For the record, if my moves HAD been successful, I would have not only had
the three builds, but also would have essentially removed Hohn & Manus from
play.  Add to that you having more immediate concerns (Russian armies) than
stopping me, I would have been sitting pretty.

I'll get back to you.  I need time to think and fix my canoe... :)

I knew you'd say that.

Actually, I can't argue with you there. But in fact, you'll be glad to
know, I did not engineer that move of Hohn's.
What everybody keeps forgetting is that that move was made by Hohn Cho, one
of the deadliest Diplomats ever to walk the map! He doesn't need any bears
whispering in his ear.

Yeah, you had to say that too.
I wish it could be so. But I will not build in Stp. Contrary to popular
belief, there is no way in hell I can win on my own now. I have to hope
that King Kal will give me a chance. Somehow, I think F Stp would
discourage him.

Nah, the moves were coordinated up north as expected.  He only REALLY did me
wrong if Manus is correct about him tipping off Hohn.

As for how things were supposed to go, I better save that for the end game
statement.

Perhaps, but I sure hope you're wrong. :)

Hey, Jamie.  Geez, I am now almost sorry I have been calling for a jihad
against you.  Honest, I'm just playin' the game.  Seems like you might
have thought I was taking personal offense.  It's all in fun, and if I
get ANYthing out of my tirades, I'll be happy.  And I definitely count an
I/R as one of the best things I could get.

As it happens, I must leave the office all afternoon now.  Dammit.

I don't deny that.  I knew there was a danger of this, I thought I'd
kept my fences up well enough to prevent it happening.  Oh well.

I await.  I think there is going to be long gap anyway.  You'll be gone
next week and I'll be gone until Wed of the week afterwards.  I don't
have email on the weekends, so if do want a reply before then, please
send me something before 6:00 EST today.

Ok.
But we'd better talk a little more before the end of the day, or it's going
to be a disaster. :-(

!!!!!

Is that really necessary? You want me to sacrifice my only son, too? Hey,
Absalom, get over here....

>That way, you wouldn't have to lose momentum versus Austria by

I have twelve centers (ok, centres, I'm trying to stay on your good side).
It's not as though I had 16.

I don't believe I am anywhere near the threat to win that Manus is
imagining. I am certainly the leader. I am certainly much more of a leader
than I ever wanted to be. But I don't believe I can win alone, and I am
absolutely not going to try. Kaiser Dave has just suggested that I could
build F Stp and A Mos, and then give him back Bulgaria, and change the
whole complexion of the game. But I told him it's out of the question.

I'm going to play the next season (seasons -- winter and spring) on the
assumption that we are still allies and that you will need me to move
slowly and carefully and maybe give you help if you want it and I can do
it. If your moves confirm the assumption, great. Otherwise,
doubleplusungreat. I figure I can afford to make the assumption. If I'm
wrong and you shift north, <shrug>, I'll just have to deal with it then
(and Dave will be laughing! he'd have Italy *wide* open and me with very
thing defenses!).

What I'd like to do is to take just one more bite of Austria. That will
leave him unable to retaliate (I think -- the position is more complicated
than I realized, but I believe I can play very safely if I make him remove
a unit). I could then play practically any way you wanted me to. I hate to
give up centers, but I could give you something each time I took things
>from Austria. (I'd want to take them back once you started getting stuff
>from Italy and France!) Or I could just wait. I like that, as you may have
noticed. I think it's an underrated strategy.

Ok, if you can show me that I'm really too much of a threat, then I guess I
have to give you whatever you demand. But I don't think it's true.

I thought you were impervious to propaganda.

Only playing the game, myself, Manus. You remember when Sultan Steve
lambasted me. You remember that I wasn't exactly offended!

R/I, any time, still. Say the word. Hell, I'll take R/anybody, first offer
accepted!
Hm, better write to Hohn....

We can discuss things next week. Some kind of hiatus, because both Cal and
Dave will be away. Wow, so that leaves just you me and Hohn Cho! Small
world. Interesting possibility. Anything you can put together, anything,
I'll go for it.
