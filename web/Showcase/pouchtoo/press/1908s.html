Oooh, I hadn't noticed: Cal built just what he needs to try for the win. I
was sure he'd build F Lvp, and hoping he'd build a second fleet.

Now I'm back on the fence. I'll have to think hard about this again.

Possibly my retreat to Tyo and subsequent debuilds puzzled you. The retreat
to Tyo looks hostile. I did that because I still wasn't sure of my
situation, and retreating to Tyo is flexible, the army there has many
possible uses. The debuilds look friendly. I did those because I am just
about convinced that you are correct. Glad you removed your fleet, too;
though I hope we have enough fleets among us to blockade the Brits!

I will get serious this afternoon and get back to you.

Just to let you know I'm not ignoring you I'm under the gun at

Huh?  I don't understand.  I built two armies (as we agreed) for use on the
continent (France/Germany) and the fleet is to convoy them over.  Building a
fleet in Liverpool would have tipped Manus off and building in London would
have meant waiting a turn before being able to convoy anything!

If I had wanted to continue attacking north, I already have more than enough
units there to do it, I think that much is obvious.

Don't make a hasty judgement until you see my moves.  I believe you'll see
that *I* have every intention of carrying out what we discussed.

Now *YOU*, on the other hand, show every sign of having concluded a deal
with A/I over the demilitarization of Turkey.  Don't forget, I have already
said I expected a stop-the-leader alliance to form after the last Fall
season and it sure looks like my prediction has come true...

Comments?

Rick: As I mentioned in my broadcast the other day, I will be away next
week, so I would appreciate a deadline extension.  I leave tomorrow and will
be back the following Saturday.  As I don't expect to be included in much
negotiating, a deadline the Monday after would seem sufficient.

Thanks!

There wasn't any agreement like that, actually. I have a complete record of
our press, and I've just examined it for any trace of such an agreement,
and I found none. I wonder what you're thinking of.

But this means you are definitely not moving into the Mediterranean this
year. You're going to put armies on the continent, and I know what you
*said* you'd do with them, but they will be, shall we say, multi-purpose
armies.

>If I had wanted to continue attacking north, I already have more than enough

That is obvious. It's not exactly the point, not exactly what I'm worried
about.

>Now *YOU*, on the other hand, show every sign of having concluded a deal
>with A/I over the demilitarization of Turkey.

Oddly enough, I didn't discuss the adjustments with Austria *at all*.
(Italy, as you noted, had no adjustments.) What is actually happening is
that he's trying to make it difficult for me to steamroll through his
remains, and I am trying to make it easy for me to do that! Those fleets
sitting in Turkey have (had) become superfluous.

>Comments?

Yeah, comments. That prediction is going to come true if you make a move to
cross into Eastern Europe. I won't have any choice, and the smaller powers
are going to be greatly relieved if I have to settle with them at this late
hour. Dave just wrote to me reminding me that "the door is always open" for
A/R rapprochement, just as soon as I see the light (meaning, just as soon
as I see that you're looking to cross into Silesia and Bohemia and those
sorts of places).

You point out that you have 'more than enough' units to continue attacking
in the north. Yes indeed, but as long as you attack with fleets, it's only
a nuisance to me. If you try to bring armies in for an attack, I have to
fold up all my plans and agree to the terms of the little A/I coalition.

One more comment. It sure seems to me that if any stop-the-leader alliance
forms, the game will be over for all intents and purposes. It'll be a
four-way draw.


Hm. What is Dave saying to *you*, by the way? He seems to be *expecting*
you to be moving armies into Central Europe. That's my impression, anyway.

Hmm, now I am too...  Unfortunately, MY records were wiped out with my
computer crash a month or so ago, but I was sure that something like that
was agreed on.  I know the specific builds weren't discussed, but I thought
the general idea HAD been.  Didn't we talk about fortifying the continent at
one point (now you've got me wondering if the agreement I'm remembering
wasn't for a previous Fall turn.  I hope not).  Oh well, if I'm wrong, I'll
once again have to let my actions speak for me.  I am NOT planning an
offensive thru the north.

Since they're targetted for France (ie NOT Holland, Denmark or Norway, but
Belgium, Picardy or Brest), their multi-purpose value is lost.  Admittedly,
I'll have to prove this is where they're going, but you'll see.

Okay, understood, but the point I'm making still stands: why would I tip you
off with a build in Edinburgh if I was headed that way.  I'm a little better
strategist than THAT (hopefully, we can ignore the "Yeah, but if he knows
that I know that he knows etc argument..." <g>).

Okay, I can buy that, but if you sit in MY seat for a second, you must admit
it looks collusionary (you don't own a baseball team, do you? <g>)

Agreed.  That's why you won't see the armies heading anywhere but south
(assuming you don't attack ME, of course...)

Well, that's what most of the Observers said when the alliance was against
you.  This game may just turn into a Calhamerian ideal yet...  If it gets to
the stalemate point, I'll pull back and give centres to Manus and put a
whole new dynamic into the game... (evil grin)

>Hm. What is Dave saying to *you*, by the way? He seems to be *expecting*
>you to be moving armies into Central Europe. That's my impression, anyway.


Mostly, he's just been reminiscing about past camping experiences.  Did I
say mostly?  Hell, camping is all he's mentioned since the Fall moves were
released.  (Did you know that his grandfather runs an outfitter and is out
camping right now?  He's the youngest member of that party and he's 83!)
That and the fact that Manus has disappeared and you hadn't written even to
say hi, was what got me wondering if I was on the outside looking in.

As for his expectations, he made them up.  I certainly never told him they
were heading that way.  He expects me to be moving north as fast as
possible.  Hmm, he could be thinking I'm heading there to support him in
place though.  I don't plan on that though.  My ambitions (as far as Germany
is concerned) stop right where they're at.  The slogging thru the Central
Plains is far too labourious for my taste and stalemate lines are set up far
too easily.

Anyway, to sum up.  I'm sorry if there was miscommunication or
misinterpretation on my part.  I fully intend to carry on as I said I would
do.  You followed thru on your end, ceding me Munich & Sweden and I will
follow thru on my part of the deal and head south.  I'm sorry if it's slower
than you had hoped for, but I'm going there nonetheless.

As I recall, some long reply you wrote a few weeks ago never got to me.
Maybe it was in there.

(Multi-purpose armies)

Ok, if that's where they are heading. Bel-Bur, of course, no problem, you
do what you like over there; Bel-Ruh would be nerveracking, though. (And
where would you be putting the army *currently* in Ruhr?)

Sure, it does. It struck me, too, how odd it looked for Turkey all of a
sudden to be vacated (or really, left to Manus's whims! Kinda makes me a
little queasy, that does).

Here's why I noted that I hadn't discussed it with Dave at all: it's true,
and it puts me a little further out a limb, since you can ask Dave if we
discussed it at all, and though he and I *could* have made a huge plan
(we'll vacate Turkey and if Cal asks we'll both say we never even talked
about it), you have to admit that given the current state of communications
in this game that kind of plan sounds rather implausible!

Anyway, I've explained why it did happen that way, and since the
explanation is true, it ought to be plausible. (Truth is underrated in
Diplomacy, don't you think? I love it. It's so satisfying to stab someone
when you've never lied to him at all! You can be really sanctimonious about
it. ;-))

Yeah. I suppose it *could* work that way. Geez, those centers would sure be
poison pills for Manus. Swallowing them would be very unhealthy.
I do think that this here actual game will *not* work that way. Nothing
about the logic of the position, rather the history and the attitudes of
the players.


>That and the fact that Manus has disappeared and you hadn't written even to

Neither of them is talking. I think I have heard once from each of them
since the Fall moves.

I'm a very talkative player (big news!). If they were talking, I'd be
talking their ears off.
I'm not convinced that Manus has looked at the results yet. I mean, the
FALL MOVEMENT results.

(Dave)
>As for his expectations, he made them up.

I should have been more explicit about this. I didn't mean that he actually
told me, "Cal is going for Central Europe." That was more like something I
inferred from very general things he said. Don't you conclude that Dave is
lying about you. No doubt he was trying to create a general scary
impression! (Hey he tried that on you, and it worked ;-))

>My ambitions (as far as Germany
>is concerned) stop right where they're at.  The slogging thru the Central

Ok, so here's my question, then. Where are you going for centers? If not
into Germany (or Stp), I would have expected you'd be trying to crack into
the Mediterranean. But you've left yourself pretty far away.

Well, I can sort of see it. You'll spend a year putting the new armies in
France, taking no new centers this year. That way you avoid growing to a
size that would force the rest of the board against you. Then you can burst
into the Mediterranean after that, and *IF* I am tying up Manus, you have
some winning chances. And even if I'm not, quite possibly you can arrange
things so that it's worth my while to poke at him.

Maybe.

I still have to think about this. My small intestine is telling me that I
have to be very, very careful at this particular juncture.

As you point out, I DO expect to get any future centres from the Med.  I
just don't think I have to get them "a la blitzkrieg".  If I was to "sweep"
anywhere, that WOULD cement an alliance against me.  This way, you and I can
continue to pressure the central powers and probably end up racing each
other for the win.  That seems about best for both sets of (our)
self-interests.  Anything else and we turn the game Calhamerian again, don't
you think?

As you may have figured, I am waiting (and waiting and waiting) to hear
something from Manus. I am assuming you have heard nothing from him. You
may have a view about whether (and on what terms) he would be prepared to
cease all southern hostilities and participate in a stalemate line, but I'm
guessing you don't really have any solid information about that.

For a moment I was pretty worried, since you say you may not be able to
read any mail you get after today, and Manus says he won't be sending any
until late tonight. But then I realized, this really doesn't matter. I
don't think it will matter to you what I *say* now. You will wait to see
what I *do*. I don't think your moves this season will be affected by
anything I could say. And really, if we *are* going to put together a
four-way draw now, one season isn't going to make any difference. Cal's not
in any position to ruin any stalemate line now, and he won't be next season
either.

Let me know if you think I've missed something. I expected I'd have a
definite word for you a *long* time before now, but then Manus up and
disappeared. (And he wasn't talking much before that either, for that
matter.)

Hi Jamie,

Frankly, I think Manus will be quite willing to halt southern hostilities
anytime it seems obvious you are calling off the offensive.  He's
naturally worried about Cal since he's on the front line in the west.
He isn't really in a position to carry on a war with you without my
help, so if you and I can work out a peace then he'll go along.

As for your second point, you are quite right, what you do will of
course be more important than what you say.  Nothing that I'm going
to do can possibly be so momentous that it will make it impossible
for us to work out a peace, so you are free to make the appropriate
moves to establish a working relationship.  If you do so, then I am
open to realigning things, after all my goal is to prevent ANY win
that does not include Austria, not just a Russian one, and I am confident
that I can bring Manus along in such an agreement.

Regards,
Dave

Hi Manus,

Jamie is making definite overtures towards trying to form stalemate
lines to stop Cal.  Of course he needs to back off first, but he
will hopefully do that this turn.  He is concerned about whether or
not you'll be willing to work with that.  A short note to him to
the effect that if he backs off in the south you'd be amenable to
not pushing farther (not that you'd leave anything open to him
of course) might help.  Obviously for this turn we'll have to make
moves as if he were attacking, but if we are lucky maybe he will
pull back.  That or I'm toast (<:.

I'll try to look at a map tonight and have some ideas.  Any you have
will be appreciated.

I'm certainly still willing to support you in, but it's getting to be about
time
(ie Jamie is less of a threat to win now than a year ago) that we need to
talk about  what happens NEXT.

I have definite worries about Manus.  He has three centres in Turkey which
seem to be his for the taking.  Expansion like that would make him a very
definite threat to me once Jamie is further reduced.  The same would happen
in any kind of stop-the-leader alliance against me.  That's why I want you
and I to work something out.  You're the one person I can work with to
mutual benefit.

In trying to figure out where to go next, I feel that there are only limited
expansion opportunities for me if I stick to the northern approach.  At the
same time I naturally have to worry about your reaction if I was to attack
anywhere else (heading to the Med, of course, precludes me wondering
about Manus' reaction - that'd be fairly predictable, I suspect...).
Another
option would be heading overland thru the neutral provinces towards Russia,
but I don't like that idea for a few reasons:

1) it's always tough slogging;
2) I'm sure it would alienate you;
C*) Manus reaction would probably be as bad as if I had hit the Med, but
there would be little to stop him from attacking me rather effectively.

I think you're at the point where continued pressure on Jamie and new
pressure on Manus would put you back into the game as a solid participant,
not just someone hanging on to avoid elimination.

I very much want to know your thoughts on these ideas.  In short, I need
your reaction to several things:

Am I wrong in thinking that you would not WANT English armies
moving across the plains to Warsaw?
How would you feel about an English move to the Med?
Do you think my worries about Manus are justified?
What do you want for the long term in return for your help against Italy
and Russia?
The most likely outcome as we speak seems to be a four (or perhaps
three) way draw.  Comments?

Waiting to hear from you

To start at the end, I do agree with you at that the moment we are heading
for a four or three way draw.  While I obviously prefer this to a solo
by anyone else, it is not necessarily my end goal.  I am quite willing to
make moves towards a two way (A/E) or even to make moves in that direction
knowing that you'll take your best shot at the solo, but only if I think
the chances for success are reasonable.  That is, give me say a 40% chance
of stopping your solo (or getting my own) and I'd go for it.

The problem right now is that that chance is a lot more like 4%.  If I were
to hit Jamie or Manus right now, they would crush me between them, and you
would have a good shot at the solo in the meantime.  In addition, if you
move to the Med now, not only will Manus send everything that way, but
even Jamies fleet in Greece will head over to help, and of course I'd be
committing suicide to do anything but go along with them.

All that doesn't sound too encouraging, but I do think there is a good
chance for us to work something out.  I think the stop the leader play
is going to shift in your direction soon.  However, I do not think that
is a bad thing for either of us.  What it means is that Jamie will have
to back off of me and Manus will have to shift west.  While this does line
them up on you, I don't think they'll be able to make any headway and it
is vital to my being willing to make a move that you not be just a step
away from 18.  The real benefit of this though is that it leaves me in
the middle with opportunities.  In such a position, I can make a play to
take out one of them (Manus most likely) and still have a decent enough
position that I don't have to fear I'm just handing you the game.  The
other thing I'd want to have would be Munich.  I'd be a lot more comfortable
owning Munich than Berlin, it's a much safer position.

I know this sounds like I'm asking a lot from you, but hey, I'm at 6 and
you are at 13 and a four-way is better than an elminiation or a loss, so
I've got to ask for a lot to bring us up to an equality we are both happy
with.

For the moment, I'd like to just take the slow approach.  We take a shot at
Berlin and you don't go for the Med and we see what Jamie does this spring.
If he backs off, then I will strongly push Manus to back off as well.  This
will shift Manus your way sooner, but without the extra centers from taking
Turkey, so he won't be a real threat to you.  A little positioning, perhaps
I can even bargain for a center or two from them and build a fleet or two,
and we will be in a position to try something.  It's going to have to be
slow and carefull though.

Thoughts?

Hi Manus,

Thoughts for this move:

Ion - Alb, Aeg - Con, Syr - Arm

That will keep him off my back a bit and give him a chance to back off
if he's serious about a new stop-the-leader alliance aimed at England.

Cal has suggested that Jamie is offering you Turkey as a buy off to let
him take me out.  Seems possible, but as I know Cal will jump into the Med
full bore if he sees that, and I'll do what I can to open a hole for him
in the north, I'm hoping that is all in Cal's head.

Hi Jamie,

Any word from Manus?

I certainly won't hold you to anything, but should you be interested in
a rapproachment, then may I suggest the following:

Bla s Bul - Con, Bul - Con, Gre - Bul/sc, Rum s Gre - Bul/sc
Alb - Gre, Ser s Alb - Gre

That keeps you pretty safe and shifts the units away.  Given that we
should be able to convince Manus to head west and maybe even your fleet
can go that way.

Don't worry -- I'm not about to do anything that would endanger myself.
And stabbing you would certainly do that.  At the moment, I'm dependent
on you to keep Cal OUT of the Med, and I will toe whatever line I need
to to make sure he stays there.

I do want to set up a stalemate line out west, but don't know how soon I
can get around to doing it?  Any ideas?

Jamie is making definite noises about needing to have you set up there.
He seems concerned that if he backs off in the south you will keep
pressing him though.  Obviously we can't trust him this turn, but if
you make the moves and Jamie does back off then we might be in a position
where you can start shifting your units to the west.

One possibility if you want to trust him that far is to do:
Spa - WMEd, Mar - Spa and have Jamie move Tyr - Pie.

I want to see Ionian heading west, but need it this turn to protect
against Jamie just in case.  If he's serious about a realignment and
shows it in his moves, then we could even consider having you take
a Turkish center for a build, then give it back next year.  That would
give you a fleet in the west and maybe even let Jamie build another
northern fleet.

Well, my friend, I am becoming more and more convinced that we're in a
four-way unless we play a slowly-turned three-way against Cal.  Both Cal
and Dave have threatened my big-time that if I cross Dave in any way
whatsoever, the English navy will be in my gullet.

Yes, this could have been prevented by me setting up a line out west earlier
rather than later.  But at that point, the threat was that Dave would throw
the game to YOU if we didn't go along, and it was a very real threat.

Unfortunately, it is now just as real that Cal can have the game if Dave
sends it to him, because Cal will continue to position himself such that
the first anti-Dave move I make will give him the extra tempo he needs to
grab my dots.

That's the way I see things.

Dave's plan has you backing off in the South this turn, me backing to the
west  next turn, and you building a northern fleet ASAP.

How does this sound to you and have you been in touch with him on this plan?

I'm not convinced that this is a credible threat. But if you are, that's
it. So I'll go for the 4-way now. If by some miracle we do start to push
Cal back, then ok, we can play it from there, but I don't think that's
going to happen. I think the game will end shortly.

>Yes, this could have been prevented by me setting up a line out west earlier
>rather than later.  But at that point, the threat was that Dave would throw

You should have stabbed Dave. He could not have thrown the game to me under
those conditions. He would have had to throw me all of Italy and Tunis. But
that's over, c'est la vie.

>Unfortunately, it is now just as real that Cal can have the game if Dave
>sends it to him, because Cal will continue to position himself such that

Again, I don't think it's that clear. I think possibly you could hold Mar
and Spa for a couple of years against Cal, long enough for me to eliminate
Dave and feed you a couple of dots to maintain your Med defense. The
question, I think, is whether Dave could get Cal over the Central European
part of the stalemate line, so that when he *did* get Spa and Mar (and he
can obviously get Ber and Stp), he'd win by snagging something from Austria
or maybe Ven or War.

But I no longer want to talk about that. I'm going for the 4-way draw. It
will be very easy. The only trick will be to make sure I do it obviously
enough so that Dave will believe that's what I'm doing!

That sounds fine. I mean, I don't think it matters, really.

Just a couple of hours ago (very shortly after I got this question from you).

So, it's a deal. I'm calling off the invasion, I agree to a 4-way draw.

That looks ok off hand. I'll examine the board and I will inform you in
advance of my moves. (I think!)

Uh. So, are you thinking we are now actually going to try to beat back the
Brits? Or is this just about the end of the game, a 4-way? I was thinking
the latter.

My general plan is to stick my armies into stalemate position. Let's see, I
think there are seven armies needed east of Switz. How many do I have?
(It's been a while!) I must have at least seven. So we can use yours too,
or else we can rely entirely on mine and yours will stick around in the
middle to keep me honest. Oh, and it would be very nice to have one in
Piedmont -- we could set up a line that holds Marseilles, too. Do we have
enough fleets among us? Just barely, if we include mine! Hm. Yeah, I think
we'd better try to include Mar in the line. Manus can have Ank or something
if necessary. I'll give up centers, just not too many. (If you take one,
you'd better build a fleet, I think.)

Tomorrow I will work out some details. Also, some time soon I will explain
why it's taken me so long to agree to terms. (I doubt it will be much of a
surprise to you!)

Hi Jamie,

I have no problem with the 4 way, there's really no way that I can
expect anything more.  I am making my moves this turn based of course
on the possibility that you are going to hit me, but assuming you back
off we are all set and I think we are soon enough to prevent an
English win even if he storms the Med this turn (and I've done a fair
bit of work to prevent that from happening).  Should I end up getting
a build out of this, then yes, it would be a fleet.  Also, this is a
spring turn, so assuming you make a shift that convinces Manus and I,
we can make our decisions about how to allocate centers in the fall.
We have room to shift them anyway we please in the Balkans/Turkey.
In fact we can setup a regular building factory by swapping them around
or forcing some retreats if for example there is a chance for you to
build a fleet in STP and that seems useful or if we need to get Manus
a fleet build quickly.

I will not be around tomorrow, so I have to send in my moves now.

Regards,
Dave

Oh, ok. Then I'll follow your suggestions. Sorry, I just haven't gotten
around to figuring out what else I'll do. I was waiting for Manus, then
this afternoon was extra busy.

Right, you go ahead and move as though I were still attacking. No problem,
plenty of time to fix things up. (It might be kind of awkward if Cal ended
up in Tyrolia, but even that is fixable.)

I think it's rather too late now, personally.

Though my analysis made me think it was possible to eliminate Dave safely,
I am not willing to take the chance now. In any case, I assume you looked
things over carefully and made your own decision.

> I was just shocked that both
>Dave and Cal would write me and accuse me of being ready to toss Dave

Possibly they could think of no other explanation for why I was waiting for
you before I turned in moves. I can't think of any other explanation myself.

Dave sent me some moves he wanted me to make. I can't make exactly those
moves, because Dave thought I had a F Bla. But I will make essentially the
moves he suggested.

You can't have Gre, but you just move Ion-TyS, Aeg-Ion, and when you need
another fleet to set up the stalemate line, we'll arrange for you to get
another center using that army in Turkey.

My fleet will eventually follow yours west. The army line in through Boh,
etc., will be trivial. I expect we'll get my A Tyo into Piedmont to support
you in Mar, though that will await Dave's permission (if he moves Tri-Ven
this season, he could put that army in Pied next season).

Well, I must say I had hoped for a more positive reaction, but I suppose
that WAS pretty unrealistic.  In your situation, I suspect I'd be asking for
much of the same thing.

My interpretation of what you're saying is this: I should basically sit
still
and allow myself to be attacked by everyone (yourself included) in the
vague hope that you may be able to worm a couple of centres out of Manus
or Jamie at which time you may be able to make a move against one of them,
as long as it doesn't benefit ME too much.

I know you didn't say it this way and you probably don't mean it as
harshly as I've phrased it, but I'm afraid that it DOES pretty much boil
down
to what's above.  Sigh...

I think I'll go it alone for a turn or two.  I know I can't force my way to
a
solo, but I think that the improvement I can make in my position is worth
declining your offer.

Keep in touch.  Hopefully, we'll have something to talk about later.

Dave,

Ok, I've entered my move. Here is an almost full report.

>Bla s Bul - Con, Bul - Con, Gre - Bul/sc, Rum s Gre - Bul/sc
>Alb - Gre, Ser s Alb - Gre

You will not be too disappointed, I hope, that I did not order Bla S
Bul-Con. I have an extremely good excuse, I think you'll agree. :-)

You also list Ser s Alb-Gre. Ser is your army, not mine. I am not expecting
you to issue that order. Maybe you were looking at a map from an earlier
season?

I decided not to make exactly the other moves you suggest, but the gist is
about the same, so I'm pretty sure you'll be satisfied.

I am taking a small chance and ordering Pru S War-Sil, dislodging you from
Sil. The point is that you are not going to change your direction during
the movement phase, we've agreed on that, so I am giving you a 'forward
retreat', I hope, into Bohemia. Since it's very unlikely that you will be
moving Vie-Boh or Gal-Boh, you can retreat Sil-Boh unless Cal is moving to
Boh, which also seems fairly unlikely (I'm sure he'll use either A Mun or A
Ruh to support Bel-Bur, and he wouldn't order Mun-Boh unless he also
ordered Ruh-Mun). If your army has nowhere to retreat, well, there should
be no problem clearing your home centers for the replacement build, since I
am moving away from them and I am even attempting to move out of Budapest.
I would order Tyo-Pie, but I would prefer not to see Mun-Tyo, so I'm just
going to leave the A Tyo where it is (actually, ordering Tyo-Mun).

There is some chance that we can actually take Munich in the Fall. In any
case, I think we ought to be able to build a stalemate line that holds
Berlin. Hm, I don't know where your units will end up.... Yikes. I'd better
not think about that anymore, every time I do I can see how bad your
position is against me! :-) But anyway, the line that holds Berlin requires
seven units plus the one in Berlin (for the East of Switz part, I mean).
That could be my two fleets (F Ber, F Livonia) plus six armies (Tyo, Boh,
Sil, Pru, War, Mos), and a couple of those armies could be yours (maybe A
Boh, A Sil, say). This leaves us each with some armies to cash in for a
southern fleet or two, as you noted. And maybe you can move an army to
Piedmont, that would be nice, so we can help Manus hold Marseilles in his
part of the line. I bet you are ordering Tri-Ven, so you could use that
one. And you'll have some armies to leave in the middle of your own
possessions, to police this alliance (and I will have at least one or two
for the same purposes, but in any case I will have such a powerful
potential to throw the game that I'm not really concerned about defending
myself from you or Manus).
If/when we've got that line, it's essentially the same if we've also added
Munich.

I do hope Manus is ordering Ion-TyS, Aeg-Ion. It will be depressing if he's
got some other idea.

I suppose you will already have the results by the time you get this.

Nothing from you today....

I just want to reiterate: send those fleets west. Do whatever you want with
the army in Turkey, but make sure you sail the fleets west.

The stalemate line east of Switz is looking very secure, I think. I don't
know what Dave is going to do, but unless he does something really radical
there should be no problem shoring up the line very quickly. And I believe
we can move an army into Pied in the Fall, either a red one or a white one,
so you can hold Marseilles. So the only potential soft spot is the fleets.
We might need either mine or one that Dave will build to complete the line.
Or you can build another one, I guess.

But don't leave the fleets in the east! (And don't try for Greece, please.)

Trying to get some time.

All that is left really for me to do is take Dave's suggested moves, and
yours, and put in orders that will make us all happy.  I hope to
find time to do this tonight.  Hopefully pre-deadline (!)

I believe Dave wants me to hang one more turn before setting sail,
and you want me to sail now.  I have to strike the happy medium and
walk the wire.  At this point, it's a game of patience, and hopefully
it will break back to a plus side for us sometime.

Argh!

No doubt he wants you to hang just in case I'm going to try to eliminate him.
But *you* don't think that, so you really ought to sail west. (And even if
I *did* try to eliminate him, you wouldn't attack me and try to save him,
would you???)

Look, you can save Spain if you do it now. Otherwise look how far you're
going to be from defending Spain.

I don't follow you.

You are not aggravating. You are irritating.

Look it up.
;-)

But first order Aeg-Ion, Ion-Tys.

But listen, I am ordering my fleet to the Aegean and my A Bul to Con. Dave
instructed me to do that! (I'm not sure he was consulting an accurate map,
though, since he also gave me a suggestion for my F Bla. Which has a
handicap of the worst kind, namely nonexistence.)
If my fleet doesn't get out of Gre, my A Alb won't go to Gre, and it will
be stuck in Alb, and Dave will be unhappy. So for that reason if no other,
get that F Aeg out to Ion!

Whew, you Did the Right Thing.

Too bad we couldn't get an army in Pied, to cover Mar. But you can guess to
cover both Mar and Spa, or you can just go back (MAO-SPA(nc!), Spa-Mar) and
be sure to cover.

I dislodged Dave so that he could 'retreat forward' to Bohemia now that he
sees my intentions. We agreed that he had to make anti-Russian moves this
turn, but that my moves were supposed to demonstrate my final intentions,
so now I do expect he will retreat to Boh. And that *might* make Cal use
the A Bur to defend Munich.

My instinct is to retreat Bal-Lvn, which is the stalemate position to hold
Berlin. I'll have to see whether there's any point in retreating to Bothnia
instead, and whether it's safe.

That should do it, right?

Too bad you cut my support of Baltic Sea. But it's no big deal. It just
means we don't get Munich now.

I guess we could try for Mun. Off hand my inclination is to retreat to
Livonia, to the stalemate position. I guess it depends on whether we are
just going to settle the draw right now, or actually try to take on the
English. Manus's F MAO opens up that possibility.

Well, let's see what Manus thinks.

I suppose that was inevitable. I didn't really expect that you were going
to let me keep Berlin or Stp!

Well, we shall see if I'll really need them.

That Italian fleet looks like it could be a pain, huh? Too bad you didn't

How so? An unsupported move to Bal I could see as making sure I didn't get
a supported attack on Kiel, I guess. But you took Bal yourself. I can't see
*any* defensive purpose to that move.

> Berlin is pretty safe from me if you really look at it.

Yeah? You now have three units against it, and an Austrian one available to
cut my support.

I don't know.
I'll have to see what you do next season, I guess.

Unsupported moves! Hardly "taking a shot". I was hoping to keep you from
entering Norway, so that I'd stand some chance of holding onto Stp. I was
right to do that, I think. I moved to Mun to cut support in case you were
going to go for Berlin right away. You didn't, but it sure *looks* like you
were just setting up to do it in the Fall.

It is up to me.
But you are making it very difficult for me to do anything but settle for a
4-way.

So far.

Hmmm, fair enough.  Not what's happening, but I see how you think that.
FTR, I don't think I'm strong enough to do both (I could give you examples,
but I suspect we BOTH know where I'm weak) and you can see I DID move, quite
demonstrably, south as previously agreed upon.

>> and 2) supported Austrian A Sil-Ber like he asked me to.
>
>But then *he* would have gotten it!


If I wanted to go against you, that wouldn't have mattered.  On the
assumption that you two would be fighting (which would probably continue if
he took Berlin), I could take it from him more easily than from you in the
current configuration.  But I didn't want to go against you.

Like I said, it's a defensive move.  With me there, I don't have to worry
about Kiel.

>> Berlin is pretty safe from me if you really look at it.
>

I didn't support him in.  You really think he's going to support ME in?  He
can count centres too, y'know... <g>


Anyway, HERE'S where our main philosophical and/or perceptual conflict
occurs.  I am working on the assumption that Austria is on your side, if not
now (as seems apparent by the moves) then in the near future.  He has come
out and told me that he sees an anti-England stop-the-leader alliance as
inevitable in the near future.  He worked with me this turn (although I
didn't reciprocate) in hopes of making sure you could be controlled (tamed?)
enough to make sure you took part by being down a centre (Berlin).  Frankly,
that's pretty much the reason I refused to give him support to Munich -
didn't want to facilitate his plans against me or hurt you.

You, on the other hand, are working on the assumption that Austria is, and
will STAY, on my side against you.  I don't think you're giving Dave enough
credit.  This game has already seen enemies turn into friends against a
common foe (uh, that would be you, if you recall...<g>) for either of us to
assume his continued aggression against you.  That's where *I'm* coming
from.  Reasonable?

Anyway, I think this is what is leading us to keep wondering about each
other's moves.  I *THINK* you will see my moves as more reasonable if you
try to look at it from my point of view.  Agreed, the Baltic move was
aggressive and I understand your questioning it, but looked at with the
assumption that I will be facing ALL of you very shortly, it's not so
unreasonable.  Certainly, if I had wanted to, I could have made other
followup moves that you would have liked MUCH less.  No?

Heh heh, we could cut and paste THAT into each message we send each other,

Fair enough.  I didn't hold them against you.  They were defensive moves...
Just like mine...  See above.

I originally sent this last night and went to bed.  Judge sent it back

Hmmm.  I think if I were going to be taking a shot at Stp or Ber, I would
have 1) moved f Edi-Nrg and 2) supported Austrian A Sil-Ber like he asked
me to.  Baltic was strictly a defensive move to keep you honest.  Berlin
is pretty safe from me if you really look at it.  I'd say I kept to our deal
fairly
well.  Certainly, the moves with my armies in England and in Germany
were EXACTLY what I told you I'd be doing.

You've got me confused. Are we working together or not?  I realize, we are
going to have a hard time trusting each other, but I really didn't deviate
very
far from what I said I would be doing.  I definitely didn't make any really
blatant OFFENSIVE moves against you.  Can you really hold moving to
Baltic against me when you take a shot at Munich AND Norway?  I think
all three moves are easily forgiveable by each of us as being something we
just had to do for safety's sake.  No?

I guess you're going to have to decide: side with A/I and take the obvious
and easy four way draw (yuk) or work with me and take the chance that I may
pull off a solo in the hopes that you can get (the more likely result of) a
two way.

It's up to you.

I  can muster enough forces to stop Manus in his tracks and even advance
somewhat so his fleet doesn't worry me.  It all depends on whether or not
you're a player who can be satisfied with a four way.  ;-)

Suggestions for tactics?  Or am I all on my own here?  I'll live with it
either way.
