Although I am the only survivor not involved in the draw, I must
say that I am probably among the happiest people that this game is
over.

Congratulations to you three.  As Jamie said, I really didn't have
much of a chance for a mightly long time now, and it was kind of
inevitable.  It was nice to think that either Cal and I could break
through a line somehow or set up a line of our own that required me
or that A/R would break, but well, you juggle those three options up
in the air and pretty soon they work at cross-purposes with each other;
one person catches one ball, another catches a second, and the third
drops out of the air.  And it turns out to be an egg.  And lands on
your (my) face.

Anyway, congratulations to you guys.  You'd have thought you'd have the
decency to let me win or at least share in a draw in a game named after
my own humble little contribution to the hobby.  But nooooo!  :-)

As for EOG's, I think I've said far more than my share, and I'll let
my recent
statements, taken together, stand as an EOG.  I'll respond when
insulted and
stuff (I'm already cringing beneath my desk in expectation) but I
don't plan
another original broadcast.

(And there was much rejoicing.)

Addio!

I'm still here.  I think I already wrote my EOG, shortly after my

OK, the game is over.  Interesting game to watch, especially from
my perspective.  I mean, you guys all did known that the press
was eventually going to be public domain right?

>From my point-of-view, we had three different sets of players:

1) Hohn and Steve, who each made it a point to try to make sure
the guys on the other side of the board attacked the other one.
Both were quite successful!  Perhaps the next time they play together
they'll have an early game "let's not rally the troops against each
other" agreement.  Though, I would have to say that it did not
require much convincing for people to go after either Steve or
Hohn.

2) John, Cal, Dave, and Jamie, who played the game mostly as I
expected it to be played, with varying degrees of success.   Jamie
again made it to the draw, a fact which didn't surprise me at all,
and flew in the face of many of the early-game "expert" analyses
by observers.

3)  Manus.  Oh my god, I had a hard time keeping a straight face
reading Manus's press.  Those of you who were playing the game
have an inkling of what I am talking about.  When all of this becomes
public (which should not take long) we will see really incredible
efforts by Manus to always appear like he's on everybody's side.
The crazy thing is that one of these efforts almost worked, and would
have if Dave and Jamie had stuck with it.  I encourage
everybody to read _all_ the press surrounding the sequence of
events when Manus invited Dave to take one of his SCs.

I don't consider myself a great player of the game.  I watch and
I try to learn.  The extremes Manus went to in this game were quite
something to observe.  It was rather amusing, because most of the
time, the other players would make comments to each other to the
effect of how unbelievable they found Manus's explanations, yet
repeatedly Manus was able to find somebody to work with, up until
the end.

Manus, I know that you're expecting a new Issue of the Pouch to come
out soon.  Can we get a pointer to this game in that issue?  I'll
try to get the press files to Ry4an Brase quickly.

Any ideas for a new showcase game?

Well, I stuck myself out on a limb to try and break something somewhere
(I don't remember what it was I was trying to break, but it turned out
to be the limb I was on).  Frankly, I was real disappointed by that.
I was hoping that this game would feature some close alliance play,
with SC sharing and stuff.  I think it might have broken to something
better than a three-way (though perhaps not).  But it was not to be,
and I was not to be one of the three.

But all my wriggling did indeed secure my survival.  I played my normal
Italy, working east then west then east again.  Usually this slow
expansion side-to-side in each of the two directions proves successful
for me with my style of press, but in this game, the buffers that are
usually there just plain weren't.  And the extra turn before the stab
never happened.  Still, I suppose, I can live with my performance.
Without a true ally throughout the game, I still managed to live more
than a decade.  Even to the end, I thought I had a chance with Cal of
doing something, but I zigged when he zagged, and Dave stabbed, and the
thing became moot after that.

I'll take that as a compliment.  (Uh, may I?)  One thing, though -- I
will be interested in learning which of my explanations were found
most unbelievable, because by and large (and this may be a shock to
everyone, or it may, I suppose, be a product of my faulty memory), I
don't recall any real zingers.  I think I told the truth in the main
It may just have been that the truth was rather out there.  I remember
when I snuck into a Russian Ankara (was it) back in the original A/I/R
alliance, on a Spring move, and then told Jamie it was a feint and I'd
be out in Fall.  Poorly timed message, but the God's honest truth.
That's just the way I play.  If I have an ally, I play SC sharing and
fake wars, even if only for a single season, to gain a press advantage.
This took Jamie and Dave by surprise, and the fact that it took them
by surprise took me by surprise.  I suppose I simply thought that
everyone played that way.  As the most experienced player in most of
the games I'm in, perhaps it is just that I teach others my modus
operandi and mistake it for something common.  I do think it's the
best and most fun way to play.

Well, now that I think a little, I believe I *do* remember a couple
times when a pretty extragant cover story had to be contrived.  I
always thought I fared pretty well with them, though, and I guess they
worked decently enough.  (Well, other than the fact that the final
tactical mistakes on the last two turns, one a case of crossed judges
and the other of crossed wires, cost me a possible [though, admittedly,
not likely] place in a draw).

I think they did!  And this time everyone used the Judge so that
the press will be lined up correctly as it was NOT in ghodstoo??
ghodstoo also is still available for viewing and when we announce
pouchtoo we might want to remind people about ghodstoo as well.

One idea I have for a new showcase game is that I think Rick did
a better job of managing it than I did.  ghodstoo was my rookie
GMing on the judge attempt and though I didn't royally screw anything
up, I did  make a few errors.

In the next game, I think that Keith Sherwood should be invited to play
and perhaps Paul Rauterberg from my szine.... plus of course Mark
Fassio could be asked again.

Then perhaps some Brits should be asked to play.  Mark Stretch might
be one who I know is very E-Mail connected.  In fact, with some
Scandinavians etc. perhaps the next game could be called "worldtoo".

My opinion is that these series of games should continue with Rick
as the GM.

What does it mean?
That is, I think I know what 'effort' you guys are talking about, but
what
was *supposed* to happen, what would have happened if it 'worked'?

(Manus)

Well, I think we all would have! I don't have to explain to anyone
present
how it can happen that everyone prefers that there be close alliance
play,
yet it never comes to pass.

Just from my own perspective, I think that there *almost* was a close
endgame alliance between me and Cal, but the fateful move in F1905
prevented this from happening. (Cal may correct me; it may be that he
never
intended such an alliance. If that's right, he had me fooled!) Going
back a
little further, I probably could have had a nice tight alliance into the
ending with Dave, but I jumped the wrong way at the fateful juncture.
(Yes,
in retrospect it was the *wrong* way, but I still think it was the
sensible
choice given the information I had at the time.)

I believed you. (And yes, it was Ankara.)
But, it worried me anyway. It wasn't so much *what* you did, as the fact
that you *surprised* me with it, that bothered me. I am willing to
'share'
centers, especially if they are going to be behind the lines, it's
often a
good idea. But I certainly expect my ally to ask first, or at the very
least warn me! I had grave misgivings about entering into a long term
arrangement with Manus at that point. The next surprise might be a very
nasty one. Stabs, well, those I expect, count on, calculate, etc. But
Manus
pulled a surprise that wasn't a stab. I didn't want to have to plan for
*those*.

I can't really remember; it's been a while.  I think, though, that the
intention was for me to allow a center take by Dave, run crying to Cal,
getting his moves, and break through to some kind of glorious triumph.
Vague enough memory for you?  I guess we'll find out when the press is
published, and I'll read it and wonder what I was drinking that night.
But if I remember right, A/R professed an interest in it working,
and according to Dave, he came close to going through with it instead
of taking such rude advantage of my hospitality.

That was fateful indeed.  Hohn basically saved the day that turn, from
my POV (though how someone who didn't make the draw can call the day
saved is tough).

For what it's worth, I knew after that move that I had lost Jamie's
trust completely in the game.  Despite my profuse explanations, which
all centered around the fact that here it was time to put in moves, I
was the last one to do so, and what is the most logical move for that
unit from my point of view, given the diplomatic objectives we were
after at that time?  Holding didn't seem useful, so I assumed that in
my position Jamie would have done the same thing, even without time to
give notice.  I assumed wrong.  And, as I say, I could tell that from
then on Jamie didn't ever speak to me the same way again.  I knew that
my
zig-zag method of playing Italy would be tougher because Jamie would
keep a close eye on Turkey.  I knew I had to shift my diplomatic
strategy
to court Dave a lot harder than I had been doing (I think at the time I
was thinking that the A/I/R would more likely break to an I/R than an
A/I,
but I could tell that I/R got completely shot right then and there).  I
knew that Jamie would start courting Dave as well, wanting the three way
to break against me, just as I had to begin hoping it would break
against
him as a result.  My move into Ankara was intended to build trust, but
it
had the opposite effect, and I could tell I wouldn't get the trust back.
And in the battle for Dave's friendship, Jamie won.  That was probably
my
biggest failure; and I didn't see the break coming.  I thought I had
another turn or two before Dave would make his choice, and I thought I
stood as good a chance as Jamie did of being chosen.  Like I say, that
was my biggest failure diplomatically.  Then I scrambled to join John
and
Hohn and Cal and I hung on for dear life until Cal's E/R plan to turn
Jamie
on Dave (and himself on everyone else) hit us all, and Hohn seemed to
be the
only one prepared for it, which foiled Cal just enough to give me an
ally in
Cal, to join the repentant (for the time) Dave.

I won't say I underestimated Jamie, but that I overestimated myself.
My M.O. when playing (admittedly, against less expert players than
Jamie) is
that I have enough faith in my press ability to explain things like this
even after the fact, and that it only builds *more* trust when I fulfill
promises made *after* any kind of surprise.

Obviously, I may use all this extra trust to advantage first chance I
get, and
one surprise down the road may not be the same kind, and the stored-up
trust
gives me an extra turn to twist the knife.  Now I'm not saying that
in this case I hoped to someday surprise Jamie and then not unsurprise
him,
as I did in Ankara.  In many of my games, I never cash in on the trust I
build in that kind of way.  But, of course, I'm not saying that I didn't
consider the possibility that if I could get Jamie used to harmless
little
surprises from me, maybe one little one might turn bigger when Dave
and I
wanted it to.

This turned out to be a case of not giving Jamie his full due, and I
realized
that as soon as the moves went through.  Jamie took the, "hey!  I
don't care
HOW good your intentions are; don't you EVER surprise me like that!"
tone
(which I completely understand) and my "oh, don't worry; it's nothing"
messages had far LESs effect on Jamie than they usually do.  As I say, I
usually press my way through those things and come out way ahead, but I
could tell in this case that Jamie had just plain stopped, cold-turkey,
considering me a potential two-way partner, and that nothing I could say
would change that.  I wasn't surprised that what I usually find
success with
wouldn't work on Jamie, but I wish I'd have found out a different way.
Though not surprised by Jamie's reaction, I was surprised that that my
press talents weren't able to undo that reaction at least a LITTLE more
than they did.  But they didn't.  I could tell from that point that
the someday sooner rather than later Jamie and I would be on opposite
sides
of the fence, and nothing I could do or say would possibly change that.
I had cost myself what I considered to be a pretty darn good alliance.

Manus

I hear Manus' message loud and clear.  As someone who also often
uses "zig-zag" strategies, I will say that the loss in credibility
can sometimes be excruciating to manage.  The current "Arsenic
and Old Farts" demo game, which unfortunately only can be seen
by postal subbers to my szine, is playing out in somewhat similar
fashion where I am playing France like Manus played Italy.

Right now (and I can't say much more without potentially affecting
my future), I am trying to rebuild trust among some neighbors to
try to make it through to the endgame.  It is interesting to contemplate
whether one can switch base strategies in the middle of a given
game.  I do know that pursuing "zig-zag" strategies can force
others to play in that arena much more than long alliance strategies
can.  They also are much more fun and exciting to play!!

I think Steve and I simply fell into our old habits, here.  He and I
have played FTF dozens of times, as we are friends who both live in the
greater Los Angeles area.  He is definitely one of the best FTF players
around, and I understand his postal play is similarly distinguished.

Whenever we play, particularly at the local conventions, we almost
always go for each others' throats, either immediately or as soon as
possible.  I'd estimate that he gets the better of me more often than
not, but at least this time I can claim the incredibly valuable bragging
rights of lasting a whole handful of seasons longer than he did. :-)

As for the Fall 1905 move, I have to say, that was the most satisfying
move (and corresponding result) that I've ordered in a long, long time.
And no one tipped me off; I just had a feeling about it.

I guess I should listen to my intuition more often. ;-)

No "almost" about it.  My absolute favourite type of game is when I
have a
solid two-way alliance right from the start, but NOT with one of my
closest
neighbours.  I like to ally with someone from across the board (jn this
case, Jamie's Russia) and not only keep it a secret, but make it look to
everyone else in the game like my alliance is the most unlikely thing
on the
board.  Until it was forced to break up after 1905, the fact that
there was
a solid E/R was news to everyone except Jamie, myself and Rick.  Now,
in an
idealistic world, this "secret" alliance would sweep the board and end
in a
17-17 draw.  But since this is Diplomacy we're talking about, my
preferred
result is that I can grab that 18th dot.  Although I WOULD have gone
for the
win in this alliance (unlikely as I thought it would be for Jamie to
leave
me an opening), I really was prepared to follow this two-way right
through
to the end.

Now, in an

Actually, Jamie and I had been having some off line discussions that led
me to understand the tricky depth of the ARE interchanges to some
degree.
In any case, I wasn't surprised.  But Jamie admitted some things to me
during those discussions that I don't think were common knowledge.  To
me,
more than the ER machinations, it was the games that Jamie and David
were
playing that were most interesting to me.  I was having fun tweaking the
observers as they were following the day to day results and not seeing
the
larger picture.  This was very much of a "big picture" game.  Very much
fun to watch.

And from this observer's vantage point, you played that way.  This is
just
my opinion, but I think Jamie was subconsciously or consciously playing
for the three way draw around that period, not the "battle England out
for
the two way or win" that you were playing with him.  It was that "three
way draw" play that Jamie does so well that keeps him in every one of
these demo game draws.  Again, just my opinion, but if Jamie HAD been
playing Cal's game, I think David would have beaten him, even with the
maintained secrecy of the ER alliance.  Then, the three way might have
been different!  Since I was sympathetic to Manus' style of play, I
probably would have been trying to make that scenario play out more
than Manus apparently did, since that would have been a AIE three way.
Jamie is real tough to beat on that score though.... perhaps no one
would have succeeded in taking that line.

Just some observer thoughts,

I tried for the vowel alliance.  I tried for just about everything
that had
more than one letter (I) in it.  In fact, it was my last attempt at a
vowel
alliance that cost me the game.  Anyway, I do think that when the press
comes out, you'll see that I was pretty active in thinking I was in
quite
a number of three-way alliances.  But I was always the odd-man out
when it
came to it.

Sounds like you think only Jamie can/was play/ing the "big picture"

Yes, Manus, I know, but what I was trying to say was that at the bottom
of all that was the machinations of the Russians.  Them keeping
themselves
in meant, in this game anyway, keeping you out.  Jamie didn't let that
vowel alliance thrive.  I think he did it masterfully and delicately.

No, no, Cal, not at all.  I probably should have separated those
thoughts.
I was enjoying watching the games that Jamie and David were playing with
each other (1).  Then, separate idea (as I was tweaking the observers),
it WAS a big picture game.  You HAD to be in that game Cal, or Jamie and
David would have rolled over you and THEY would have been battling for
that two-way/win you were talking about.  You played a quieter game,
for sure.  I didn't have as much insight into what you were doing and
how.
Perhaps after seeing the press I will get more of a picture of it.

But, in sum, with Hohn on one side and Jamie on the other, you were NOT
surviving without some damned good play!!  I thought even the eliminated
players played will.  That one turn that Hohn pulled off like a magician
absolutely floored me!

Well, far be it from me to claim any special insights into my own
subconscious, but I can tell you for sure that *consciously* I was not
at
all settling for a draw, at *that* point. Once Cal attacked me in the
north, then I had to change my objectives, and I would have accepted a
3-way draw right then if I could have. But before that, I had higher
hopes,
essentially the same as Cal's (pressing an E/R forking attack, trying to
stay roughly balanced, going for a solo if I had a reasonable opening,
not
expecting to see much of an opening...).

Now that I would like to see explained. What exactly do you think would
have happened if "Jamie HAD been playing Cal's game"? (Because I
think, to
all intents and purposes, I *was* playing Cal's game!)


Nobody has commented on Dave's endgame play, by the way. I was very
impressed. Tactically, he was beat, he just had to hope I would make
some
mistakes. But diplomatically, he won outright. Not only did he keep
England
after me, which must have been pretty easy, but he kept Manus from
taking
the Austrian centers and attempting to be the Third Man. Finally, he
identified the right move to level his ultimate threat against me:
that he
would throw the game to England if I didn't withdraw. At just that
moment,
England was big enough that it was a completely credible threat, and
Dave
couldn't wait any longer because in another year, even another season, I
might well have been close enough to eliminating Austria that I could
have
afforded to risk it; I would have had some decent chance of holding a
line
against England myself, or with some help from Italy.

To be honest, I'm having some trouble sorting out the time frames in the
game in my thinking.  I do recall though (at a point that I thought was
fairly early on in the game) sending zingers at the observers which were
not very explicit, but thinking in the back of my mind that the Women's
Lib ERA draw was the likely conclusion.  Exactly what point that was
(I know it was while I was still watching Hohn do wonderous gymnastics
in the West and Italy was still relatively strong), I can't recall.
Perhaps, though, on this tradeoff I am all wet.  If so, apologies.

You would ***SURELY*** know better than I.  I'll say what I meant, but
I'm not sure if that was going on.  At the point when the ER alliance
was secret (and David would have to say when he figured it out), I am
suggesting that Jamie was seriously dealing with David about some
alternatives.  This was a point where I was having some side discussions
with Jamie and David (that I was trying not to know too much and step
into interference), but some turn (I forget which one) I could see that
Jamie and David were reaching a deal and at that point I was thinking...
aha, Jamie is moving toward that ultimate ERA draw.  No one is saying
that he at that point had given up on winning himself, just that he
was inclined toward making a deal with David instead of putting him out.

As I said, though, perhaps my timelines are all mixed up here.

It is this time period that I am thinking about.  The turn I am thinking
about is the one where Jamie withdrew.  Do I just have the timing on
that
messed up?  I distinctly recall BEFORE that turn, though, thinking that
this was the turn that Austria and Russia will make a deal and then they
did -- shocking the observers, but not me.  Jamie, were you thinking I
was talking about some earlier point???  If so, sorry about that.

Yeesh.

Ok, let me try to explain the time sequence.

Once Cal was attacking me full force in the north, it is most certainly
true that the idea of an E/R alliance that would drive toward 17-17 with
the possibility of one of us making some timely stab for victory was a
pretty dim and distant idea in my mind! Not *totally* out of the
question,
but not exactly my main plan.

If I put it this way it ought to sound extremely obvious:
at the moment in the game when every surviving power was attacking me, I
was thinking mainly about how I could get into a small draw, and not
about
how I was going to win.

All of that happened as the result of the Fall 1905 move, when Cal
tried to
capture a few centers in and around Iberia and Hohn Cho foiled the
attempt.

But also in Fall 1905, I stabbed Dave. When I decided to stab him, I was
indeed deciding to try for a serious, game-ending E/R alliance, one
which
might get me a 2-way, might get me a solo, and might end in an English
solo. (And, needless to say, might go all wrong, as it did!)

So,

And what point was that?

Say, 1904. Somewhere in there I was not entirely decided whether I
wanted
to try an E/R or an A/R. (And of course I was well aware that I might
be on
the short side of an A/E.) But I definitely wanted one of those two. A
few
considerations tipped me in favor of allying with Cal. I think I won't
say
what they were.


But then,

Yeah, that was in 1908. King Kal had been attacking me for years, and
I had
been attacking Kaiser Dave for those same years (plus one season). There
was only one alliance in place at that point: EVERYONE-BUT-RUSSIA
against
RUSSIA.
Dave and I each knew that if that vowel alliance held together,
eventually
I would have to give up and rejoin Austria to stop England from
winning. It
did hold together, and so I did give up and rejoin Austria, and we did
stop
England from winning. :-)
I tried everything I could think of to break up the AIE alliance. No
doubt
I should have thought of something better. It was quite frustrating. I
felt
dumb and powerless. Still, I never felt really *worried*, since I always
had the reserve plan of rejoining Austria and forging a 3-way.


> Jamie, were you thinking I
>was talking about some earlier point???

Yes, I was, and so was Cal.
There was no secret E/R alliance in 1907! The secret Cal means was one
that
was secret in (and until) 1904), and then came out in the open exactly
when
the alliance itself disintegrated (per force).

I figured then (as now), that we had the same goals after about S1902.
 Play
the E/R for all it was worth, steal dot #18 if possible (albeit
unlikely)
and show the demo-watching world a great way to work an unlikely
alliance
(unlikely as in starting right from the get-go, not that E/R isn't a bad
team onec the early game settles down).

One advantage I had in this alliance is that I knew if there WAS going
to be
a late stab for the victory, it was more likely to work in my favour
than
Jamie's.  Given the direction we would have been heading (both towards
Austria or Turkey as we neared the 17-17), *I* would have units free to
commit to an attack.  Jamie would have no reason to build fleets up
north
and I'd be able to grab something like St Pete's for the final dot. 
Even
so, I knew it was more a fond hope than a likelyhood.  Sigh.  Until
1905, it
was a MAHVELLOUS alliance!

I think the turning point in this game (along with Hohn's stopping me
from
getting three builds in 1905, of course) was Dave's ability to
convince me
that he would throw the game to Jamie if I didn't turn north.  Now I
ALWAYS
have some doubt as to whether or not someone will actually suicide
(especially with the "world" watching), but it only takes a little
doubt as
to whether or not they will do it.  It was true enough that, if I didn't
turn around, Dave would have little to lose by doing so, so I had to
take
the threat seriously.  It was really then that the real "trench war"
started.

</PRE><p><a name=24></a>Broadcast message from <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Austria</FONT> in 'pouchtoo':

<PRE>

Sorry for the batch load of my comments.  I don't have time to
respond to each post, so here are my thoughts on a bunch of things.

Manus I think you played a fun game and I enjoyed it.  I was aware
of your zig-zag approach, it shows clearly even now in the end
comments.  Not that you have said both that you thought an A/I had a
great chance all along and that while the AIR was going you were always
leaning towards the I/R.  The thing is that I don't doubt that you
not only honestly held both these opinions, I believe you honestly held
them at the same time!  Like all of us, I felt the AIR could not last
all that long and I felt that the most likely break up would be to
squeeze the guy in the middle.  That's a good part of why I broke it up
with my stab before you could zig back east again.

As to why I chose attacking you over Jamie, that was more of a long
term decision.  I thought I was in a better position to hammer you
quickly (nice defense by the way!) and I felt that Jamie was in a
better position to make the move we needed on Cal.  Yes, even that
early Cal was the one I was really concerned about.  England has the
easiest position to secure and Cal was on his way there.  I didn't
think that AI could take ER in a straight 2 on 2 slug fest, but I
thought AR had a good shot at taking EI.

And the fateful year of 1905.  I made two mistakes (what, only two
Dave?  Okay, only two that were pivotal) in this year.  The first was
my analysis of the game position.  Of course I knew that Cal and Jamie
were talking and that Cal was working hard for the ER.  It wasn't that
I had been told about it, it was just that it had to be happening.  I
knew what Cal and I were talking about, and I didn't think that Cal was
putting all his money on the alliance with Italy so that only left
Russia.  His strategy of working long term with non-adjacent neighbors
is also one I favor so there was the added fact that an ER is what I
would have been doing at the time.  I also knew that if Jamie was going
to switch to the ER, now was the time.  However, I had looked at the
situation and decided that it would not work out for him and that he
would be better off with the A/R.  The problem was that I didn't
clearly communicate this to him along with all my reasoning.  I made
some allusions to it but make the mistake of assuming he'd reach the
same conclusions I did.  Doesn't help any to know I was right either!

The second mistake was tactical.  In planning the attack on Manus I had
the concern of where his fleet in Ionian would retreat.  I was willing
to let it go into Aegean because I wanted to maintain my position in
Turkey and despite Jamies gentle prodding in the other direction had
decided on that.  Unfortunately I didn't send in my moves that night
and when I came in in the morning I had them all set to go except the
fleet and army and I looked at it quickly only from the tactical
perspective
of attacking Italy and so moved the army from Con to Bul, forgetting the
strategic reasons for leaving it there.  This meant that Jamie was
actually able to take a center from me in F 1905, whereas if I had left
the army in place he would not have been able to.  I expect this
opportunity was the final piece in tipping the scales in favor of the
stab.

The other momentous part of this turn was of course Hohn's move.  A
wonderful move and it will long stand as one of my favorites.  While I
have to admit that it was a complete surprise to me, Cal's stab was
not.  My hope and planning was of course that Cal would stab Manus but
Jamie would opt not to follow through on the stab of me, in which case
AR would have been off to the races and I think we could broken through
all the lines.  Both of us would have course have been maneuvering for
the solo as well.  My planned play was to try and take Manus out after
that in one massive attack.  With Cal successfully stabbing him and him
needing to disband, I would have argued that England was too dangerous
and I would join Manus in the fight and turn on Russia, aiming to get
Manus to disband A Rom and attack to hold the Med with Tun - Wes, Tyr s
Tun - Wes, Pie - Mar.  I don't know if I could have pulled it off, but
I thought I had a good shot at it.  Who knows.   If I didn't, then it
was just a straightforward attack.  The interesting point is that with
the stab by Jamie, if Hohn had moved to Wes as "planned" and Cal's stab
had succeeded, the above plan would have been all the more reasonable
and the odds of Manus accepting it would have risen dramatically I
think.  With the spring moves of:

Pie - Mar, Tun - Wes, Tys s Tun - Wes
Ion - Tun, Adr - Ion, Apu - Nap, Ven - Rom, Tyr - Ven

We are actually down to a three way game immediately!  Yes, I've
given up a lot to Jamie, but we're back in the can anyone move to
a two way without the victim throwing the game to one of the other
two.

Right or wrong, the reason I started with the AR and the reason I
kept coming back to it is that I thought it had the best chance
tactically and I thought that Jamie and I were the two who would most
effectively use the above strategy, so the best hope for getting close
to a two way had to be with both of us together.  I did make one last
try at the end to see if I could move with Cal.  I would have made the
"stab" of Jamie if I could have gotten him to agree to it on the basis
of a pretend war in order to try and set up Cal.  The reason we ended
up in a three way was that there was no way I could make a move on
Jamie and get far enough to prevent him handing the game to Cal.  Not
that I expected him to really suicide if he could help it, but he would
hand over enough centers fast enough that I would have to call off the
war and shore him up to prevent Cal's winning and the odds were too
great that I couldn't shore him up in time to prevent the solo.  If'd
Jamie'd gone for the pretend war there was a chance I could reach a
position to try for it, but Jamie of course was aware of this and too
wise to let that happen.

PS. I made some notes in the first two years and I just looked back at
them. The first note to myself about an ARE hopefully going to AR vs E
shows
up in 1902!

As mentioned above I would not really have wanted to suicide but I would
definitely thrown enough to Jamie that Cal had no choice but to try and
prop me up.  I was convincing because I did mean it.  Of course I
would have
tried to survive, but if I couldn't then I would have taken Cal with
me.  I
picked Cal rather than Jamie as the threat was more viable there.

Tsar Jamie,

I'm interested in your decision to go with the E/R rather than the A/R.
How set in stone was that decision and when did it occur?  Was I fooling
myself that there was a real shot at A/R?  I'm getting a lot of these
messages out of order, so if you haven't read my previous long post you
might want to first.  Just wondering what I could have said/done that

Hm, a lot of questions to answer and comments to offer.

Cal:

>I figured then (as now), that we had the same goals after about S1902.

Almost -- my goal was a Russian victory. ;-) More seriously, see below
in
my response to Dave.

More Cal:

Suffice it to say that it seemed to me that *I* would have the
advantage,
more of a chance of winning, if the ending came down to E&R against
everyone else.

I won't go very specifically into my reasons, but, I think Russia almost
always has this sort of advantage. Russia expands very, very quickly
in an
endgame, when he decides to shoot the moon.

Yet more Cal:

>I think the turning point in this game (along with Hohn's stopping me
from
>getting three builds in 1905, of course) was Dave's ability to
convince me
>that he would throw the game to Jamie if I didn't turn north.

Oh yeah, I had forgotten about that.
I was somewhat surprised about that, myself. Mainly because I didn't
think
Dave really *had* that ability.

But in any case, I basically expected that once Cal started his attack
on
me in '05, he would continue until he had gathered up a great deal of
northern territory. One thing I half-heartedly tried to do was to let
this
happen relatively quickly, on the theory that if I could get Cal
reasonably
satisfied reasonably quickly, he might head into the Med early enough
to do
me some good. (He would force Manus to look westward, and without
Manus's
props I would be able to eliminate Dave quicker, I thought.)



Dave:

Here's what I think:
if Cal hadn't had his 'bad luck' (or bad judgment, or underestimation of
Hohn, or whatever it was) in his Fall 1905 moves, then the E/R alliance
would have held a couple of years at least; in that case, I would have
been
able to take so much out of Austria that Dave would have had very little
threat left. So I feel that my stab was 'right', although it didn't work
out well in the end, due to an unforeseeable circumstance.

My stabbing potential was considerably greater than it looked. I was
counting on that. I could only stab for one center, and I could only
move
other units *near* the Austrian border (and also an army to Rum,
*onto* the
border), but my follow-up moves were very strong and the Austrian
defense
was very hard to muster. I was counting on my position *looking* less
threatening than it was. Reading Dave's recent comments, I guess I
didn't
get any advantage from that at all!

My decision was not set in stone until the very moment I stabbed.

I liked the A/R possibility for a number of reasons. I won't go into
all of
them (a tsar has to have some secrets, as I recently mentioned to
Manus).
One main one was as follows.
The E/R alliance was going to be very 'open', with each of us driving as
many units as we could muster into the opposition, and not having to
leave
much defense each against the other. We would each grow fast, leading to
potentially very unstable situations, with the possibility of a win on
each
side if one of us made a lucky guess here or there, now or then.
An A/R alliance would be much more 'closed'. We would have had to
cooperate
a lot in Germany, and each of us would have had a relatively slow time
against our main targets. And, Austria and Russia have a big long land
border, and we each had a lot of armies, so there would be permanent
issues
of border defense.

Well, I like slower, closed positions, just as a matter of my personal
style. So I sort of hoped for A/R for that reason.

In the end I chose E/R for two reasons. First, as I said above, I
thought
my winning chances were somewhat better with E/R than with A/R.
Second, at
the fatal moment I saw that I had a pretty good stab of Austria, and
that I
was not going to have that opportunity again. To attack England, I was
going to have to build a northern fleet before I got anything going, and
this was going to telegraph my choice. So I wasn't going to get any
surprise stab against England at all. I was afraid that if and when I
stabbed one way or the other, the Big Three (ARE) combination might not
break my way. If I hadn't gotten in a pretty good stab, I might be in
huge
trouble. Whereas if I did get in a good solid stab, then I would
probably
be in reasonably good shape even if the triple didn't break my way.
Which,
in effect, is just what happened -- right after I stabbed, everyone
ganged
up on me, but I was big enough and in an aggressive enough position
that I
was able to continue to be one of the Big Boys anyway.

Thank you.  Perhaps it's because I've had so much practice trying to
pull
myself out of desperate situations.  Especially as Austria.  Did this
remind you a bit of the Dip World Demo Jim?

Doesn't the first (you had a better chance, you expand rather rapidly)
sort
of imply the second (I could throw to you).  Russia + Turkey + Austria
+ Balkans
is 14.  Russia currently owned Ber, Kie, Den and Swe as well.  That's
18 right
there with Mun an easy target as well.  Of course you could have
negotiated a
careful sharing there if you had time, but I wasn't planning on
allowing any
time,
rather a full scale abandonment of everything east of Italy.  You
would have
grown
so fast that the temptation and possibility of the win would have been
very
large.
At least I convinced myself and Cal of that (<:.

More Jamie:

I feel the same would have applied had Cal's stab in 1905 succeeded. 
With my
1906
moves being an attempt to wipe out Manus, which I think would have had
a fair
chance
of succeeding, I would have owned Italy, Tunis and some scatterred
holdings in
Austria and the Balkans.  Cal would not yet have had a presence of any
size in
the Med and would have been facing the same threat as in the actual
line, that I
would keep my fleets, put up my best line in the Med and let Russia
run rampant.
It is certainly possible that you two could have gone to a two way
from there,
but
it would not have been easy and would have required an awful lot of
trust on
Cal's
part.

And from the Jamie/Jim exchange:

I had

There

This was an interesting time for me.  I never expected to be able to
take the
vowel
alliance to the end game.  I was the odd man out and if we carried it
through to
really wipe out Jamie either Cal would be in a position to take the
solo or I
would
be nailed as Italy would be all around me.  On the other hand, I had
to keep the
alliance alive long enough to make the threat against Jamie very real,
but not
so long that Cal was unstopable.  Jamie made it all the harder by
concentrating
on attacking me.  As he mentioned before, this meant that we didn't
just flow
to the
A/R as England grew, I had to precipitate it with the threat of
throwing the
game
to Cal.  Kind of like dancing in a minefield.

>
>> Jamie, were you thinking I
>>was talking about some earlier point???

Jim, I do remember that you did seem to have a reasonable grasp of
things at
that
point that other observers seemed to be missing.  I remember some of
your barbs
and they were fairly close to the mark.

>Yes, I was, and so was Cal.
>There was no secret E/R alliance in 1907! The secret Cal means was
one that

BTW I did not mean to try and appear omniscient and say I knew the
strength or
the
details of this alliance before it came into the open.  It's just that
I knew
that
Jamie and Cal had to be talking and I assumed they were following a
plan and I
figured on ARE for the end game from around 1902.  I did misjudge
Jamie's
committment
to the plan, along with the mistake of leaving him the opening for the
one
center
stab.  As Jamie mentioned, after 1905 he would not have been in a good
position
for the stab as my build would have shored up my home defenses
significantly.
If
the stab could only have been positional, without center gains, that
might have
tipped the balance to AR instead of ER?
