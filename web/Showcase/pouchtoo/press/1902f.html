That went well!

Germany's going all out westward. France and England as expected (and hoped).

Steve defended Bul instead of Ank, somewhat surprising, but this will work
out just fine for Dave too.

I have to run off to report for Jury Duty now, but I'll work on tactics
this afternoon (assuming, as seems safe, that I don't get chosen for a
trial, the lawyers clearly hate me). (Not that I blame them.) I think it
ought to be pretty straightforward in the Turkey neighborhood.

John,

Damn, damn, DAMN!  I'm not sure exactly what just happened, but I
must've screwed up royally.  I could've SWORN I inputted my orders
correctly!  And like two weeks go by without me checking!  Grrah!

Anyway, I have only myself to blame, and I apologize to you profusely.
I took away your flexibility, and screwed up my own position to boot.

I fully understand if you need to go with Cal, now, after my mistake.
And I will still regard you more favorably than him.

Please let me know if you have any suggestions for me/us.  Thanks.

Hohn claims he screwed up. I think he probably did.

I'm worried about the shifts in the east. IRA could really stick it to
me, if they wish. Last year's moves indicate just such an alliance, too.
It does not strike me as a very stable alliance, but it could last long
enough to do me in.

I'm amenable to the moves you suggested. But try to pry some info out
about the eastern front.

Too bad. We would have eliminated England's army.

It's true this turn of events has all but thrown me into England's arms.
Still, I am quite worried about the deployments to my east. Italy
violated a pledge to stay out of Tyrolia. Russia moved to Warsaw. And
Austria's army in Galicia can easily trek to Silesia. You may have more
friends than you had imagined.

Hey.

I thought we'd better discuss a few things without Italy first.

I can see a few ways to go after Turkey really hard. I mean, you get Bul,
that's easy, but we have various tries for Con or Smy, too. I am strongly
inclined, though, to have my F Bla support my A Ank, and I can have the A
Ank support an Italian move to either Con or Smy.

Now: if Italy goes for Con, that's probably a little better, because that
way you can support *yourself* into Bul without the help of my A Rum, and
that would perpetuate the little pretense of tension between us. And you
know what else, I could dislodge you from Galicia, and you could retreat to
either Bohemia (ending the pretense, I guess, but giving me room for
War-Sil) or to Sil (maintaining the pretense and getting surprise against
Germany in S1903).

What do you think?

Not if I can help it.  The plan calls for him to be just "passin' thru" on
the way to Burgandy.  Hohn offered to support John to Bel from Bur and then
move Paris-Picardy to poof my army.  John and I decided to make moves which
might  confuse Hohn and get some position to show for the supposed loss of
my army.  But then Hohn supposedly screwed up and my army lives.

What I need to know from you is what is going on with Manus in Tyrolia?  I
fully support his being there as it will make John's demise easier when it
becomes necessary, but I don't want Hohn talking Manus into pulling the
trigger too early.  In short, keep the army there, but don't use it until
later.  Use some influence to this end, pretty puhleaze? ;)

Certainly some possibilities here.  I'm assuming that Germany will again
move Den to Swe this fall which keeps you from moving to either Bal or
Nwy?  The retreat up to Sil has some possibilities.  One question will
be where you plan to build your next unit?  Are we going to limit this
coming attack to Germany or are you going to take a shot at Norway as
well?  Fighting two powers at once is of course harder, but with my
support against Germany and France working from the other side we should
be able to contain them.  And there is the question of whether or not
England will come to Germany's aid anyway, in which case we should attack
first.

The next question is that of Italy.  How long do we want to continue the
three way alliance?  It is actually easier to break it this year than it
will be for the next couple.  This year we could simply NOT support Italy
to Con and I could walk into Ven.  That would of course cause a Turkish/
Italian alliance, but with Turkey having two disbands and Italy having
one, and our units well placed to advance (Assuming Italy disbands Tunis,
Rome is still undefended) we have a good attack.  The question is if we
can attack Germany as well in this scenario, and I think the answer is
yes.  You should still be able to get a center in the north, and note
that the way it is currently going, England would actually have to
disband this year, although I expect they plan to avoid that by supporting
the German army Bel to Bur, using Pic, Ruh and Mun.  It might even be
interesting to suggest that Italy support Bur to Mun, it could possibly
get in!

Anyway, I am not necessarily advocating the attack on Italy, just throwing
out ideas for discussion.  If he gets a build this year, it becomes much
harder to make a move on him, and we have to worry about where he is
going next.  We don't really want him attacking France!

Looking purely at the German attack, if you kick me out of Gal and I
retreat to Sil, then in the next spring we can move into Boh and Pru
with supported attacks which certainly has merit.

I'll set up a map tonight and try to look at this some more, so far I've
just glanced at the report.

Gal yet.  How much tension do we want him to think is between us?

Yike, I hadn't been thinking that aggressively. But you are right, I
absolutely have to look over those possibilities.


Just off the top of my head:

I hope to be able to fight Germany without fighting England.

I hadn't decided how to play our 'conflict' with Italy. I figure he's got
other things on his mind, so I just won't mention it. But I think my general
line is going to be, "Austria and I are not in open conflict, but I'm going
to be playing it safe." This gives Germany the impression that I want him to
have, and probably that I want everyone else to have. And it's just about
what I would say even if we *were* in a more serious conflict, I think I
would pretend it was still a situation I was trying to handle diplomatically.

Are you at all worried that if we turn out to be attacking Italy, Germany,
and Turkey all at once, everybody else on the board is going to quit
whatever they're doing and join forces against us? I guess we'd always have
France on our side, though, and maybe that would be enough, just you me and
Hohn. Hmmmmmmm.

Well, I'm still on Jury Duty, unfortunately, but I will put as much
attention as I can into the problems tomorrow.

Well, I know that Italy went there at France's request. I *think* that
France has promised support into Munich. Given Austria's apparent
ambitions, I am not sure that Italy will carry through -- he might decide
to go cover Venice instead.

Italy wants/needs another unit ASAP. Though he hasn't said so, he must be
worried about being cut out of the Turkish spoils, and anyway it's very
unlikely he'll get a center from Turkey this year. He lobbied Austria to
hand over Greece, but I think Austria has been relatively unreceptive to
that request so far. So he may go for Munich just for that reason.

Obviously, Manus is somewhat distracted from the game, so I hesitate to
predict his moves.

And that's the news from the southeast....

Pretty much what I was thinking.  I'm not going to bring it up with him.
if he asks, it was just because I was a little leary of you and we are
not at war.

Yes, I'm a little worried about that.  I certainly don't want to start a
western triple.  However, I'm already labelled as the rogue of the board
to some extent.  At least for this year, if I attack Italy, take Bul
by myself as suggested and you kick me out of Gal, there is no appearance
of a grand R/A alliance.  You having Ank hold and not support Italy in
might trigger some suspicions.  One way to avoid that would be for you
to order Ank - Con, Bla s Ank - Con.  At worst this would end up with you
and Turkey trading Con and Ank, but there is no way that he could keep you
>from taking one center.  Of course we are better off with you in Ank I
think.  I suppose the third option is for you to actually support Italy
to Con.  Even if Italy gets in, he has no builds.  Turkey goes down to
one and you can play the innocent for the spring, perhaps even being able
to work with Italy to take out the last Turkish center and "promising"
to help against me.  You do take out the Turkish center, but head for
Germany instead and then we work together to take Italy out of Turkey,
or finish him off the next year.

For example:  Ank s Ital F Con - Smy with a stated plan of Bla - Con.
Ank does the support, but Bla supports Bul - Con.  The retreating
Turkish unit might well support the Italian in Smy, but he'll be easy
meat the next year.

Once again, I'm off an running with the wild ideas.  It's up to you to
grab the reins and apply some sanity (<:.

No time to write just now (maybe -- hopefully! -- tonight) but I wanted
to quickly get a note to you to ask if you have been expressing your anger
with me for moving to Tyrolia (assuming it wasn't bounced -- I didn't check)?
Doing so to the German will help the illusion, of course.  I will also
write to him claiming that you have sent me a bad nastygram about it.

For proper effect, perhaps I could ask that you actually DO send me a
nastygram so that when I pass it along to him it sounds more genuine?
(If not, I can paraphrase one up for you, putting words in your mouth,
as it were.)

As you know, I warned Germany I'd be Vienna-bound, and since he didn't
complain (yet) about my busting our I/G/A agreement to keep Tyrolia as
a DMZ, I guess he believes me....

Dear Duce,

Uhm, what's going on here?  Are you letting the wife drive the car again?
You seem to have taken a little detour there into Tyrolia.  Next time, if
you are lost, stop and ask for directions.  Piedmont is off there to the
west you know.

Seriously, this does make things rather difficult for me.  I acted on our
discussions about an A/I and took a slide into Galacia.  Now, not only is
Russia less than pleased with me, but I've got to consider that I have
to protect myself against my "ally".  Nor will I get anything out of the
Russian foray as he's covered himself well enough that I can't guarantee
anything working?  Why exactly are you in Tyrolia?  Hadn't we agreed you
would not go there?  Makes me rather happy I decided to hold in Trieste.
I have heard Venice is lovely this time of year.  Should I go see for
myself?

Please let me know what's going on.

One thing to consider is that we should be able to get you Con this year

Greetings Gentleman,

Unless Germany is planning on stabbing his English ally, which I wouldn't
want to bet a lot on, I expect that he will support Belgium to Burgundy
in order to keep England from having to disband.  Using Pic and Ruhr and
Mun to do this, the attack is guaranteed.  That does raise the possibility
however of having Tyrolia support Bur to Mun!  I'd say there's a
reasonable chance that it would work.  And it would certainly be a better
use of Tyrolia than some other options it might be considering! (<:.

Just a thought.

Kaiser Dave



</PRE><p><a name=20></a>Message from <FONT COLOR="ff00ff">Russia</FONT> to <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Austria</FONT> in 'pouchtoo':

<PRE>
Kaiser D,

Here's what I think.

I think in a sense, your general plan would almost certainly work. I think
you would be able to crush Italy easily while we finished off Turkey. Then
between
us we would own more than half the board(!).

But the endgame just doesn't look very good to me. I mean, we would be
*forcing* the other powers to align against us. Maybe we could keep England
off my neck for a season or two, maybe we could convince Hohn not to
cooperate if GE ask him to, for a turn or so, but if we're clearly about to
control 18 centers, they'd have to be nuts not to drop their hostilities and
throw up a barricade. And those guys aren't nuts.

Could we outgun them?

We could have more units than they, I think, unless they acted *very*
quickly (unless France were permitted to sail in and help Italy hold Tunis,
say). But we'd be so army-heavy we'd be in pretty bad shape for bashing
through the bottlenecks. I imagine six or seven of my armies all trying to
push into Pru and Sil, while you've maybe managed to construct three fleets
and my extra one, all trying to take on the combined FrancoEnglish navy. I
haven't tried to play through it, but it looks like an exercise in futility.

I don't want to endlessly play the role of cold-water-thrower, so I'll try
to be constructive. I thought about how I would *like* the endgame to look,
and then worked backward from there. Here is how it looked to me.

I think the best thing for us is to have you, me, and one westerner all
*roughly* even going into the finish. (I think it would be all right if you
or I were a bit in the lead, but not if we were ahead 9-9-6, say.) My choice
for an endgame partner would be England, but it could be Germany, if Germany
could be persuaded to go along with me and attack England.

So, going backward from that, what should be the plan?

I think it's pretty easy, as long as we don't grow too fast!

If we just take it slow, remove Turkey, then you go after Italy and I begin
to squeeze Germany, I think we should be pretty nearly unattackable in a
couple of years. The way I see it, you would go ahead and pass up your best
opportunity (which is now) for a devastating stab against Italy, but you
would still outnumber him so drastically that you could take him on 1-on-1
in a year without anything to really worry about. I don't expect I'd really
get anywhere against Germany, but I would hold his units east, allowing
England to reap the French centers. When E gets to seven or so, I bet I can
get him to stab Germany too, and at that point we'd be headed for the
endgame.

What I like about this situation is that it doesn't require anyone in the
game to do anything dumb. In many games I would be willing to count on
somebody playing stupidly, but not in this one -- I don't need to point out
that neither Cal nor Hohn nor John is about to go all irrational on us in
the midgame. Rather, the game would be controlled by you, me, and Cal (or
John, we can try to work that out if you prefer it), and the ending would
be highly advantageous for the three of us, and I don't see that anyone
else could do much about it.

In the ending we three would be roughly even, I think. On the one hand, I
would be a little more vulnerable to a gang-up attack, but on the other
hand Russia practically always has a kind of tactical advantage in the
ending if he survives that long, just because of his having operations in
two spheres.



I haven't played any of this out on the board. It's all pretty abstract.
But what do you think?

Well, I seem to have been left high and dry by Russia as regards my
play for Vienna.  He had talked about Arm-Rum and Rum-Gal in the Spring,
with me getting Vienna and (having used Austrian support in the Spring
the way I did) Greece in the Fall.  It wasn't to happen, obviously.  Great.
I suppose my silence over the past few weeks made him rethink his idea to
suddenly slam Austria (if it was ever true in the first place).  Looks like
his talks with Turkey about it worked as well as his talks with me.

For his part, Austria has expressed serious displeasure with my move to
Tyrolia, and I imagine he's giving you an earful about it as well.
And for my part, I am seriously displeased that he is still in Trieste
and the boot is empty, a fact he has happily pointed out.

I don't rightly know what to do now.  My whole game seems to be based
on me having one too many units, because one of them is always either
stuck with nothing to do or is doing something it lives to regret.

Anyway, I have to commend Jamie for driving a wedge between what was
once a pretty dang good A/I alliance.  Hopefully it's not beyond repair,
and that's partly why I'm writing to you.  How mad is Dave?  His press
to me made it clear he's not too happy, but since his position isn't
compromised, maybe we can just laugh it off?

While waiting for the retreats, I took a glance at our situation. How
about instead of pic-par you take a shot at Brest? If Hohn blocks you,
bel-bur succeeds, so you still own Belgium. If he blocks me, then you
take Brest. Seems to be our best shot at picking up a center.

I haven't heard from France at all, other than a personal mail on the

Well, for Vie-Gal, I can offer an excerpt from Austria's recent mail

Russia, as I said, is playing every side I can think of against the
middle, and his moves to Warsaw and Ukraine look to me like foreknowledge
of Austria's belief in the A/I I was selling him ("I'll go west to Pie, you
go east to Gal").  He didn't stab Dave (as he'd promised me), but he also
didn't let Dave stab him (as DAVE promised me).  Jamie is doing a bang-up
job, I must say.

Hohn:

Austria obviously has interest in seeing Tyrolia involved in Munich
rather than elsewhere, and as you know, so do I.  Let me know your
feelings on this, whether we are still up for Tyr-Mun (and whether you
think it will work).  I believe I have laid the diplomatic framework
to engineer it as a surprise for our friend the Bavarian.

Gotta run do some real-life work.  :-(

I had thought that we would see an Austrian unit in Bohemia.  This is what

Kaier Jeep,

I'm happy with all the peace up in my northern reaches. And I'm happy with
the aligment in the south, too, for the present. I'll proceed on the
assumption that both of those will continue as they are now.

I'm not happy with my long range opportunities. I have lots of options, but
they all make me very uncomfortable.

Because of some unfortunate incidents in GHODSTOO, you never really got to
see how I play in a middlegame (with more than one unit, that is). But
especially as Russia, what I definitely do not want to be is the
front-runner. So what am I going to do when Turkey dies? I don't like it.

If you and Cal could finish off France quickly, I'd be much happier, but I
don't see how that's going to happen. One possibility is that somehow Italy
could go and help you. I could free him to do that by just attacking
Austria outright. But I'm afraid I would lose that fight, and I'm afraid
either you or King Kal would step in, frankly. Not on my side.

I can't see any obvious prospects for continuing to make progress without
growing more than is healthy for me. I wish I could teleport a unit to the
far west, I'd just support your invasion of France.

I don't expect to be making any new enemies this coming year. Until I think
of some good plan, I'll just finish off Turkey and try to make myself an
unappealing target for Austria. But I don't know that I can just sit still
until you've finished your project, either. Or maybe I can. I dunno.

Part of my problem is that I've been all tied up with jury duty for the
past two weeks, so I've lost my feel for the geopolitical situation in
POUCHTOO. (Fancy way of saying that I don't know what the hell I'm doing
anymore.) If you'd like to feed me a master plan, I'd probably gobble it
right up. Any ideas?

</PRE><p><a name=29></a>Message from <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Austria</FONT> to <FONT COLOR="ff00ff">Russia</FONT> in 'pouchtoo':

<PRE>

Kaiser J,

Let me start by answering your last question first:

> But what do you think?
I think you're a thinking man!

A very good analysis.  The key is as we've known, if our actions will
incite the formation of a western triple.  I have to agree, given the
caliber of the players involved, that an all out A/R sweep right now
would probably do that.  The lack of fleets available to us would
indeed be an issue, and I doubt we could bull our way through.

In a game with less experienced players I think we could probably keep
the world confused about what was coming if I were to stab Italy at
the same time that you kicked me out of Galacia.  In this game, I'm
less certain.

However, having agreed with you, now I have to wonder if the cautious
approach is any better.  Lets assume that we go forward attacking only
Turkey this turn.  With luck, I will take Bul and Italy will NOT get
Con.  The next year there is no way to avoid giving Italy a Turkish
center, or to make the open break.  My concern is what happens then?
At this point, Italy really has two choices, to turn west against France
as part of an AIR, or to turn against me, looking for the IR.  Assuming
for the moment that the first occurs (<:, seeing an AIR coming is
definitely going to trigger the Western realignment we are concerned
about, even more so than seeing a potential AR now.  We also have
to face the fact that this is going to be obvious to the Western powers.
Once Turkey is gone, you have to go somewhere, and that means either
an Austria sandwich or a move in the north.

So, the only way I see this working out is that I forgo the attack on
Italy this year, hoping that Italy does NOT get a build, then I make
the attack next year while you begin a foray against Germany.  My
concern here is the timing.  You have mentioned doing this in a couple
of years.  I think that will raise problems as mentioned above, i.e.,
what will Italy be doing for those years.  How will it play out if we
do it next year?  This may be the right time in regards to Germany as
well as we don't really want him getting too many builds out of France.
If you want to wait longer than that, what do you see the three of us
(AIR) doing in the next two years?

One option is to not make the move on Germany immediately.  For example,
next year we support Aegean to Con and I move Greece to Aegean.  In
the fall Aeg and Con support Ank to Smyrna, and I make the stab.  At
that point we've gone two years without an obvious move on Germany
and G/E should be deeply embedded in France.  Now we can coordinate
the destruction of the Italian fleet in Con preferably ending with
your fleet in Con so it can head west (aren't I a trusting soul (<: ).
At the same time we can begin the assualt on Germany.

As long as we can keep Italy in Tyrolia so that I can stab to Venice,
I think this timing will work out.  What do you think?

As far as the long term, I agree in your basic scenario, but I think
that it might be preferable to have France the one Western power, not
England.  England is a much tougher nut for us to crack, he can close
of your northern fleets much more effectively and has the fleets to
stop us in MAO.  France working with us will have the benefit of the
history of conflict they have already started, and of having a more
balanced force.  We can deal with the armies, the fleets are the
problem, so this is a benefit to us.

Look forward to your comments.

-Dave

Hello Manus,

For the moment I'm not sending anything to Germany.  In the current
situation there isn't much I would expect him to do, so I figured
if I sent him something that might seem a little too much like play
acting.  The fact that I don't on the other hand, may make it seem
more realistic!  If he does write me however, I will make sure the
stories line up.

Please let me know what you end up doing.  I'm assuming you will be
using Tyrolia against Munich one way or the other, but if you want
to arrange a bounce in Venice, I can certainly do that.  (Or you
take Vienna and I take Venice just to really make it look like
a fight!).

Couple of things I forgot to mention.  One is what to do about Gal.  The
retreat to Sil doesn't really make a lot of sense if we aren't going to
move on Germany in the near future.  All this talk about stabbing Italy
has also pointed out to me how open I am to an attack by him.  There is
the potential for him to take Greece and try for Vienna.  That would also
effectively make my attack on Bul fail, leaving me in a rather poor
situation.  Any indications that he's considered this?

If you are not going to do the attack on Gal, then what do you think is the
best use of your armies, and of the build you have coming?  Between us
we are going to have an awful lot of armies sitting around doing nothing.
Do you think having them all hold is plausible or do we need to
orchestrate something?

Hmmmmmm.

Complicated.

I have to think about it.

Just off the top of my head, here are a couple of comments.

1. I have no indication at all that Italy is planning to sneak into Vie. He
hasn't written to me except that one note to the both of us. Personally, I
doubt he's planning it, because he would surely try to get a commitment
>from me to help him, right? Or at least be feeling me out. No third party
has mentioned anything about it either. Well, England did ask me what was
up with the A Tyo, but he really wanted to know whether Italy would use it
against Germany.

2. You might think a little about the option of just sitting around doing
nothing.
I know, it's weird, but really I've seen it work splendidly.

Oh, and I would *love* to have France be our western partner, yes, but I
don't see how that's going to happen. I could bail him out, but I'm not
going to get him into a position in which he'd be the third genuine
contender. Or, hm. Maybe. Maybe you could help him to Italian centers,
while I took on both E and G??? Seems crazy.

If we could persuade Italy to go west, that would make France collapse. And
then I could arrange for either Germany or England to be the Third Man,
while you smashed Italy from the rear. Well, anyway I think I could arrange
for England to be the Third Man. (This is bugging me, because I like John
as an ally, but tactically Cal is better. I'll get over it. No doubt Cal
can make a good ally. In fact, the only one of the bunch I never really
liked as an ally was Steve, so that worked out nicely, huh?)

You're right, the big issue is timing. But once again, I think maybe the
possibility of sitting our armies around doing nothing could be quite a
relevant one. Or if you hate that, we could make them tangle with each
other for a while :). Just to put on a show, give the observers something
to write about :)

Seriously, I wouldn't want to do that, I think.

I agree that if we won't attack Germany right away, it would be silly for
me to dislodge you from Gal to Sil.

Well, we have a whole week now, so I'll mull things over this weekend and
we can start to make a really fiendish plan on Monday.

Ooh, just got the broadcast saying you were outa here. Ok, me too!

Hmmm, I don't know if we can count on you taking Burgandy if Hohn blocks me

into Munich and that Manus is desperate enough for a centre that he might
try it.  My source, who wants to remain anonymous, is reasonably reliable
(although Jamie (oops!) DID get the rumours of Hohn building a fleet in
Brest incorrect).  Anyway, make of it what you will.  I think the better
move, in light of this possibility, is to stick with the original plan.

What do you think?

I concur 100% with your policy of not sending Germany anything.  I think
he's in a good state of mind for us (whatever that is).

Italy is might be trying to mislead me, but he insisted he was in
Tyrolia due to a failed RI attack on Austria. He says Russia was
supposed to move into Galicia, and Austria also was supposed to move out
of Trieste. Neither of these happened, and now Austria has threatened to
attack Venice. Italy sent me the lines from Austria's message that made
the threat, and the excerpt looked genuine. Given this, even if AI work
it out, Italy might not feel comfortable leaving Venice uncovered.

Then the question is what Russia has to gain by raising the possibility
of Italy helping France. Usually, Russia wants France to survive as long
as possible. If I were Russia, I would also want Italy to do well. Maybe
if AR are locked in a tight alliance, he wants F and I to be weak. But
if he's trying to help France, the rumor would probably be aimed at
leading us to overload on Burgundy so Brest is not at risk. Then France
has a chance to cover the centers and defend Mid.

I do think that a lot of mistrust and chaos is going on among Italy,
Austria, and Russia, and I would not be surprised to see Turkey play a
major part in who makes gains. In light of that, I think it unlikely
that Italy will do anything to antagonize me. He has to see that he is
not likely to take Munich. My most obvious moves include kie s mun, and
FI can't do anything about that. So hitting Munich would gain him
nothing. If I were Italy and looking for some quick gains, I'd either
try to take Greece and cover Venice or patch it up with Austria while
turning my eyes to some possible easy pickings at France's expense. More
likely, he'll tread water this turn.

In any event, my orders are in. I've ordered bel-bur as we have planned
all along. It's your choice whether to risk taking a shot at Picardy. My
view is that Italy won't interfere, but then I don't have a center at
stake. The worst that could happen is that I would add a unit and you
would lose one. Given the tactical situation, I'd rather that not
happen. I think we'd be worse off if I have to build in Berlin than with
your units as currently deployed, minus one. Those, I think, are the
costs to weigh against the possibility of picking up Brest.

In the end, it's your call. I'll be satisfied with whatever decision you
make.

I went over what Jamie wrote more carefully and the exact quote is:

"Well, I know that Italy went there [Tyo] at France's request. I *think*
that
France has promised support into Munich. Given Austria's apparent
ambitions, I am not sure that Italy will carry through -- he might decide
to go cover Venice instead."

Not as certain as I thought he had stated... Also, it seems as if there is
uncertainty about Venice/Trieste, something that we can take advantage of,
methinx.

I think the intelligence was offered in good faith as opposed to Jamie
hoping to achieve some unknown end from it.  He's been pretty good about
trying to keep me informed about what he hears: I suppose he feels he's
buying peace in the north for any help he can give.  Needless to say, he's
thrilled that the three of us have effectively demilitarized Scandinavia.

Yeah, I think the key is that, with A Kie S A Mun such an obvious move, it's
unlikely that Hohn could talk Manus into antagonizing you.  That just
doesn't make a lot of sense, even if Manus must surely have fears of being
the next target of an E/G.  He wouldn't want to guarantee that he IS the
next in line by getting you mad at him.

I'm going to write to Manus and feel him out.  My current thought is to take
a stab at Brest and see what happens.  If I have to remove a unit, it'll
probably be the army and I'll focus on the Mid Atlantic.  As an aside,
that'll probably guarantee that I go for Manus after France is gone.

Interesting info.  Given that Manus has told Germany that the move to Tyo
was an aborted attempt at a I/R stab of Austria, it's doubly interesting...

When you and I discussed the timing of when we would want to hit Italy
and/or Austria, I think we pretty much agreed that it wouldn't happen until
Turkey was a little further gone.  Hmmm, is this part of your master plan to
keep Italy & Austria mistrustful of each other (as we also discussed).  If
so, I'd say you're doing wonderfully!  ;)

Much obliged.  Not much to tell from up here that isn't obvious.  Hohn will
lose some ground this year, but it's a guessing game as to how much ground
and where.  But then again, that's DIplomacy!

>p.s. As for me, I am very pleased to have demilitarized the northeast!

<PRE>
Hi Manus!  Hope everything is well at home.  Thinking about what you're
going thru has made me remember MY Dad even more often.  If you want to
discuss it at all, I'd be glad to provide my perspective.  Talking with a
(relative) stranger can help.  Meanwhile, hang in there. :)

On to Dip stuff:

Let's get one thing straight here from the start.  If I have ANY choice in
the matter, English fleets will NOT come pouring into the Med once France
goes under.  I've played England many times (and many of those times, allied
with Germany) and one thing I've learned is this: moving into the Med just
about always results in a stalemate and an overextension of English forces.
This is something I very much want to avoid.  While it probably wouldn't
leave me open to a stab because of a (hopefully) fleetless Germany, it would
result in, at best, a share of a large draw.  I hope to do better than a
five/six way draw in this game.

The reason I'm stating this is to ask you to NOT use that Tyrolean army to
harass Munich.  Without your help, Hohn can't survive long and, once he goes
I can turn my attention east (note I said east _not_ southeast...).  I don't
know (and wouldn't say if I did!) who I would attack between R & G, but it
would be one of them, not you.

Tactically, if John doesn't get into Burgandy with Belgium this turn, I lose
a unit.  That would most likely be the army and I would then have to
concentrate my attack thru the Mid-Atlantic.  Given _that_ scenario, there'd
be a chance that my disposition of forces would force me to continue onward
through the Med.  Neither one of us wants that!

Stay out of the western fight and I promise you that English forces will
stay completely out of the Pie-Lyo-Wes-Naf line.  This will allow both of us
a good sense of security and we'll be able to work together(for the sake of
honesty, I _will_ say that all bets would be off should you seem likely to
fall to Austrian or Turkish forces - obviously, then I'd come across the
line, but I'd let you know first).

Does all this sound fair to you?  If you have _any_ problems with this, let
me know what I can do to satisfy your concerns.  Comments welcome!  :)

Kordially yours,

King Kal

Just a note to let you know I wasn't ignoring you. The truth is that I
have no more of a master plan than you do. Right now, it seems I am
locked into anti-France. If Hohn had moved a little differently, I would
have had more options, but he did not, so the attack continues.

The immediate term perhaps deserves some comment. Your southern front
looks immensely complicated and uncertain to me. Turkey might not go
down as easily as you would hope. In that case, you might not have to
worry about Early Leader Syndrome quite so much, because we'll catch up
with you as France falls. In any case, it might still be too early to
develop a big plan. I only hope we remember that if we both build
fleets, we can challenge England on the seas.

I have received a long and impassioned plea from Cal that I do not use
Tyrolia to hassle Munich.  It confirms the battle plan we thought that
E/G was using against Hohn.

I'm not sure how to respond, so thought I'd mention it to you guys for
advice.  What direction should we take?  We could do a little Vienna/Venice
do-si-do instead of Munich (I haven't heard at all from Hohn) but my plan
right now (pending word from Hohn) is to go against England's wishes.
I am just not sure that this type of out-and-out enmity is what we want
to foster just now.  What do you guys say?

Cal's argument is basically that he has no interest in sending fleets
around Iberia -- bears me no ill will, etc., and will head toward someone
other than me when Hohn is dispatched.

Manus,

I think it's simple, really.
Do you want to slow down the EG invasion of France, or do you not?

Ok, maybe it's not so simple to answer that question for yourself, but
that's the question. You know better than to listen to King Kal's promises.
If it's in his interest to pick Germany or me as his next target, then he'll
do that irrespective of whether you've pestered Germany in Munich; and if
he's decided he has to make a Midgame Mediterranean Entree, then he's not
going to feel so grateful to you for staying out of the Beergartens that
he'll change his plans.

Do you want me to tell you whether you *should* slow down the invasion? I
haven't decided. :)

I'll think about it.

Ya know, we need a plan now. I've been delaying, partly because you haven't
been around, and partly because I can't think of a good one. But it's time,
otherwise I'm afraid we're going to find ourselves both in a bad midgame.

It must be one of those talents I have that I exercise without realizing it.

I'm trying to figure out how I'm going to get into the endgame I want, with
you and me plus either Austria or Italy. My problem is timing.
Specifically, I have to figure out how I am (we are) going to do this
without me growing too much in the interrim and spoiling everything.

I don't intend to let things get out of hand, I am going to be careful that

Right.
Well, actually, I think maybe a southern AIR would be *less* worrisome to
the northerners. Because AIR is just too many powers, they would know it
was going to break up. And Germany and England would be very happy, I
think, to see Italy cut the legs out from under France's defense. They
would be confident that they could get their fair share of France and then
consolidate.

In the mean time, of course, we would be preparing to have three of us
(you, me, England?) remove the other two and head into an endgame. Again, I
like that because it's entirely in our control and advantageous to all
three of us, so we don't have to depend on anyone making a mistake.

That propaganda that Italy sent out, by the way, has made me uncomfortable.
He just announced to the west that I had promised him an IR immediately and
that I finked out. I can't see that it's hurt me directly, but I don't like
it anyway. I won't straight out tell anyone that it's a lie, but I'm not
going to 'confirm' Italy's story either. I wish he'd run his lies past me
before he announces them to Germany!

Here's what I'm looking for. I'd like to see either E or G, and preferably
E, get into a solid position before the next round of stabbing. That way we
can convince Cal (let's say) to attack Germany, knowing that you will be
ending any Italian threat of breaking out into the Atlantic, and setting up
a nice little tripod for the ending. Whereas if I start my next project
(attacking Germany) while England still needs Germany to get rid of France,
then I put England in a bad spot and he'd have to call a truce with France
and help Germany. As far as I can tell that's what he'd have to do. It's
what I'd do.

Seems ideal, actually.
We might also try to pseudoskirmish our armies so that they end up in
places like Bohemia and Galicia, so we've got a quick attack on Germany.
And if Italy does back out of Tyrolia, you could go there. Your excuse to
Italy would be that you're flanking Munich, and your excuse to Germany
would be that you're flanking Venice, and in fact the point would be that
you'd be doing both. (And it is your territory, after all, so you're
entitled to have an army there!)

For my part, I think my main problem will be my builds. I might waive one.
I must be able to build at least one northern fleet when I'm ready to stab
G, right? What I don't want is a huge heavy army, which would be difficult
to mobilize against Germany and anyway would bottleneck. But building a
northern fleet tips my hand immediately, since I have to choose a coast.
Maybe I'll load an army into Scandinavia. But I have to be very careful not
to antagonize England with it.

I agree, but as I said earlier, I don't see how we can get France into that
position.

Let's see. Well, England is always harder to crack than France, as you say.
On the other hand, between us we'd have a *lot* of units when the time
came, and I have the northern coasts, so there's no stalemate line unless
England can destroy all my northern fleets and take Stp. So if it came to
that, we could just deprive England of his continental centers with our
armies, and overwhelm him slowly with new fleets.

I _have_ given that some thought and I think the mere fact that you're aware
of it will be sufficient for me, certainly for now anyway.  If there's any
problem, I'm sure we'll discuss it and work out an "evening" of position if
necessary.  ;)  Things are going quite well and our alliance in the grand
strategy of things is probably a complete secret to even the most insightful
observer (knock on wooden blocks... <g>)

True as long as they are reasonably confident that the AIR is going to
break up.  I just don't want to end up providing the mortar that cements

He did the same sort of thing to me.  Actually, he asked me for a fake letter
that he could quote from (which I provided) then changed things around a bit
before sending it to Germany, then let me know what he'd done.

Aha!  Agreeement!  I really have no problems with your thinking on this,
it parallels mine closely.  My concern however has always been timing.  I
have to worry about Italy, and that has been my concern with waiting too
long.  I really do not want to see him getting a build.

As to pseudo skirmishing, we again have a timing issue.  If you kick me
out of Galacia this year, I end up in Bohemia one year earlier than we
really want me to be there.  One option is for me to remain in Gal this
year (perhaps a Gal/Tri bounce in Vie?) which you could then (only if
necessary of course) call a violation of our agreement that I would
move out.  You have a logical reason for your units to hold of course,
Ukr s Rum, War hold as I'm in Gal.  Then a spring eviction from Gal
with a retreat to Boh and some more mucking about in the fall.

Yes, this has been another of my concerns.  I'm also heading towards being
army heavy, but I don't see where I can avoid that this year as I think
Italy would scream about a fleet build (he was pretty strongly against it
last year).  On the other hand, the army in Trieste is more useful anyway
for the moment.  You should hopefully have a build this year and then
one the next year.  Building in Sev this year and moving it to Arm would
make the Turkish campaign easier and make it more sure that we can
squeeze Italy out, but it also makes you more army heavy and puts a lot
of Russian power in the south. (is it getting hot in here? (<: ).  On
the other hand, a waive the next year might be seen as a warning sign by
the north?  Of course, if you've got England lined up, telegraphing with
a fleet in STP/SC might not be too bad.

Ayup, as we say up hear.  While I am of course keeping the lines of
communication open to everyone, do you think it advisable to conduct
joint negotiations with England, that is, should I be making supporting
overtures to him and bringing the A/R out into the open as far as he
is concerned, or are you playing it more as an R/E with one of I/A

Well, he probably won't get a build this year.
If he does get a build, I could very probably get him to sail west. I can't
be sure of it, he might insist on staying east, but if I just refuse to
attack you he would be doomed to a no-growth game by staying east.

Even if he does stay east, you'd have him seriously outnumbered.

Yeah, that's true. Though if you end up in Boh, you could just refrain from
attacking Germany for a year.

Either way is ok with me.

Hm.
Yeah, I really don't want another southern army! But I guess it wouldn't
actually harm me.

I think that would be bad. It would cause Germany to cease the attack on
France, cause England to lose his potential builds, and make it impossible
for us to get our NW ally.

But waiving might be ok. Even if it seems like I'm going to build F Stp
(which would be a correct appearance!), I wouldn't be committing to a
coast. E and G could still stick together, still attack France, etc.

Good question.
As usual, it's a timing question. I do think we ought to approach England
at some point. I'm a little worried about spooking him by approaching too
soon. A player is very apt to get the impression that the alliance that is
approaching him is the solid one, and that he's being strung along or
something. I don't know, but my instinct is to wait until England feels
he's on good solid ground, which means waiting until he gets a bite or two
out of France. If he feels like he's in control of his sphere, and also
that he's big enough to contend if the Big Plan starts to work, then he's
going to be more likely to come along on the ride.

I think generally sitting tight is the right idea.  I'll probably bounce
in Vie to give the view that I don't really trust Italy.  You can use
Ukr to support Rum to show you don't really trust me.  Unless Italy
attacks me in Greece, and I doubt he will, support from Rum for my
attack on Bul would be superfluous.  I'll gladly use it if given, won't

expecting Germany to return Bel to you and are reasonably confident in
this.  Personally, I'm just sitting here trying to make sure the meat

big solid mass of red armies will help discourage that.  Any inklings
you get that something might happen would of course be greatly

Greetings Good King Han,

Nothing new to say really, just wanted to keep in touch.  I'm fairly
certain that Italy is willing to help you out if you get in touch with
him.  I've covered the bases well enough that there's really no
incentive for him to do anything else with that army.

Every indication I have is that England expects to keep Belgium, so
as I mentioned in a previous message, I expect that if you were to
have Italy support you to Mun, you might actually get in!

Keep up the good fight!

Greetings fellow Kaiser,

I wish I could really tell you what Italy was up to in Tyrolia, or that
you could tell me.  Not being the most trusting sort and having a few
spare armies, I covered myself well enough that I don't think he's going
to try anything with the army, although if he goes for Greece he might
as well do that as well.  Have you heard anything that might indicate
his intentions?

Haven't heard a word from your neighbors to the west and north.  I like
your play into Belgium though.  A strong attack on France, and gives you
the upper hand against England, pretty much guaranteeing that he sticks
with you this year.  Well done.

Italy sent a contrite message about Tyrolia. He said it had to do with a
failed anti-Austrian campaign. I would have expected him to be sending
you many missives trying to patch things up. Other rumors have him in

to antagonize me to no purpose. I'm not about to leave Munich

I am thoroughly disgusted with my play this game, which has been
overly conservative, tentative and uninspired.  Probably at least part
of this is because of my success in the last game, I think.

I am also disappointed that work issues have prevented me from
participating more fully in this game.  For that, I apologize to you.

Yes!  Thank you, thank you, thank you. ;-)

My offer to you of all of Iberia and MAR should things against Cal
look grim still stands, btw.  I'd much rather you have them than him.
When you also consider the armada heading my way to bust into the Med
shortly, I think Italian ships on the horizon would be better sooner

Sorry so long in getting back to you.  Tyrolia is where it is on the urging
of Jamie (and with German foreknowledge).  Jamie suggested it could be
arranged that Tyrolia would go on to Vienna, but he didn't quite follow
through with his half of the deal, and now Dave is none too happy (as I had
convinced him to move east, so I am left high and dry here, and with Venice
wide open to boot).  I admit that after I got to Tyrolia, Hohn wrote me asking
to make plans for Munich.  My intention is not to interfere up there, but to
lead Hohn to think I will and yet come out of it still on Hohn's good side
after an oopsy.

I will indeed try to move my fleets toward certain coasts soon.  Save some

I don't have a lot to report to you either. What's happening here in the
west seems fairly obvious to all and my "sources" in the east aren't exactly
bubbling fonts of information.  Everybody is playing it pretty coy as to
what will happen after/if Turkey bites the dust.

You sure Germany had foreknowledge of that?  He gave me the impression he
was surprised by it.  Actually, come to think of it, I guess he really
didn't say that as much as he implied he was a bit worried by it, or at
least by the potential of what you and Hohn could do with it.  Ah well, I'm
not worried by it now.

I was sort of thinking of a bounce in Vie to give the impression I
don't trust you.  However, since I should have a build coming, there
is no loss of position by that, I just build in Vie.  I can then
easily move Vie - Boh, Gal - Sil for a strong attack.

As always Russia is less than excited at seeing more Austrian armies.
I can't see any reason for an Austrian fleet though unless you are
considering a move on France next and would like the support?

I have ordered my A Ank to support Tun-Con. I'll change it if you tell me
to, but I had already sent in a provisional order for the army (in keeping
with sound and polite practice) so I couldn't just not order it.

It seems fairly unlikely that the Turkish A Smy would be unsupported, since
the F Eas has nothing else to do. I suppose he might try Con S Smy-Ank,
Eas-Smy, but that's a pretty hopeless move.

As far as attacking France is concerned, it can be very nice to have an A
Tun if that's what you're going to do (you get a F Wes and convoy to Spa).
But if you're more interested in defending France, then of course you want
fleets over there in the west and the A Tun would be useless.

Anyway, use your judgment and tell me how to order the A Ank, I'll change
the order if you tell me to.

I can't believe that worked.  Of all the double and triple talking Jamie
has been doing, that was the one thing that he never said he'd do was support
me in.  I virtually demanded he do so, just to try and stop his rather
out-and-out growth complex (whether I'd do it or not was not certain, but
I didn't want him overrunning you the way he was talking about), but he wrote
back saying no.  Here is the beginning of the mail I had started to write
to you, but never finished because I didn't get time to see what we could
do in the way of a plan to counter him:

Okay, I've had it with Jamie.  First he convinces me to head into Tyr,
saying he'll help me into Vienna, then he doesn't move to do so
and I do.  So Dave is none too happy and I've been trying to explain
that one away (and unfortunately he's still in Trieste).

Now Jamie goes talk-talk with the situation in your nation.  He started
by telling me to either go after Greece or tap Smy to cut support for
Con.  Reading between the lines wasn't hard:  "Dear Doge:  I am
taking all of Turkey and putting a fleet on the Med."  So I confront
him on it (kind of) and all I get is confirmation.

This turn he is counting on you going defensive and so he wants to twist
the knife into you all the more.  He's thinking you will double-support
Con, leaving Ank support uncut, so he will attack Con from Bla.  Rum will
hit Bul and he wants me to tap Smy for him.  But he says if I don't tap
Smy I should attack Greece.  But of course he won't tap Ser for me.  And
of course, there is no "I will tap Smy and Bul and support you into Con"
talk.  So best case he gets Ank (if he holds it as he expects) AND Con,
and I get squat.  Best case for me, I get Gre, but that's not going to
happen with Austria on the alert now that Jamie put me into Tyrolia, and
Serbian support for Greece is sure and uncut.  So the ONLY case for
me is I get Jack.

So I got to looking and my only retalliation would be through you.

That's where my message left off, and I ended up writing you that short
"we need to talk" message.  I moved the way I did, never expecting
support from Jamie (that was what I meant by the "confronting him on it"
part of the message -- kind of demanded support for Tun-Con), thinking you
were doing Smy S Con, and not tapping it as Jamie wanted.  So it seems he
snookered me again, if for no other reason but that he convinced me you'd
be defending Con.  I don't know if he could tell I was hacked at him for
not being more sharing, or what, or if it was in his plans all along to
support me in.  My best guess is that he planned to get me to do his bidding,
while he went defensive to protect Ank and ordered support for my convoy
thinking it wouldn't happen, and then claim I missed a message or something.

I guess all the convoluted explanations don't matter now.  Fact is, I
am in Con whether he likes it or not, whether you like it or not, and
whether I like it or not.

So now what?

Well, that turn worked out reasonably well for us.  No centres, but a good
position overall anyway.

Any thoughts on tactics?  I'd like to go for the Mid as it's a guaranteed
move and will set Hohn back big time.  My army in Picardy can be used in a
variety of ways to coordinate with your army in Burgandy.  Thoughts?

Manus has written me (yes, already!) to say that his support of Hohn to
Munich was only to lull Hohn into a feeling of security as to Manus'
willingness to prop him up.  Manus says, well, here's EXACTLY what he said:

harm done.

"Onward!
"Manus"

He has promised to make a move against France either this turn or next,
although I really can't say as I believe him.  Call it a hunch but I think
he will be a threat to us as long as he can manage to be.

That's my read on it anyway.

Yes, we are in good position, but I'm worried that Turkey's fall means
we'll face attack from the east. The good news was Austria's bounce in
Vienna, which shows he's not that trusting of Italy either. I read
Russia's war-gal in the same way: it cut support for an Austrian attack
on Rumania. Perhaps enough turmoil and mistrust remains for us to have
time to finish off Hohn. I am surprised that not one of RIA helped
Turkey.

I agree with an all-out assault on Mid. Beyond that, I think we need to
see what the others build.

This is frustrating.  I am conservative when I should have been
daring, and daring when I should have been conservative.  My instincts
are all messed up this game.

I should have gone with BUR-PIC, PAR S BUR-PIC, MID-BRE, GAS S
MID-BRE, SPA-POR as I'd initially entered.  But no, I have to get
greedy and try for MUN.  I also didn't know (that's what I get when I
don't have time to set up the board, the first time in ages that I've
ever tried to just "wing it" without detailed tactical analysis) that
Germany had that army in KIE to support MUN.

Gah.  Well, hindsight's a wonderful gift.  Please forgive my
bitterness; none of it is directed at you, certainly.  I'm disgusted
with my play this game, and disappointed that I haven't had more time
to devote to it.

In any event, I thank you for your support, and renew my offer of
southern supply centers should you ever be able to claim them before
the ravenous Englishman.

As for what now...I disband BUR and rebuild it flexibly, to keep the
enemies guessing (I might just build A MAR anyway).  Then I try to
hold out as long as I can.  Try to get Germany to turn, maybe.
England's awfully out of position.  Or maybe Russia will open a
northern front.  They demolished Turkey more quickly than E will

That was good.

I am now really appreciating the observer comments, since they give me an
idea of how the board looks 'objectively', i.e., without the insider
information I have, without the insider information England has, etc. It's
hard to abstract from what you do know.

Contrary to expectations (including mine), Italy gets the build. And he's
convoyed his army further from home.

I am really thinking it's time to attack Germany. But let me have a little

I'm not.  Steve's press during the wait for a new Austrian player pissed off
Jamie pretty good and I doubt if either of Austria or Italy would go against
Jamie's wishes right now.  They both have a pretty vested interested in
being the one he chooses to ally with against the other after Turkey is out.

I've been agitating for a I/R "pulping" of A for some time now with Jamie
and Manus.  As one of the observers noted, the Italian build will show a LOT
about their intentions.  A build in Venice and you and I (and Jamie) are
laughing.  A fleet in Rome or Naples and we may be in some trouble.  A fleet
in Venice shows considerable confusion on Manus' part... <g>

Heh heh, for the record, he claims he did clear the Tyrolean army with you.
Don't know if he's claiming the support for A Bur-Mun as having been cleared

you and I and it's not working very well.

Nothing new.

However, I am at loose ends. I don't know what to do.

If we're going to proceed with the Master Plan, I *think* I can't attack
anybody now. Or should I now engage Austria? That would mean a schedule
about like this: this coming year I stab Austria, and Italy jumps in once
Austria is directed against me; next year I make a separate peace with
Austria, leaving Italy to do the fighting, and you and I make the move
against Germany? (Scraps of Turkey and France to be cleaned up on the
side.) Do you think the timing would work out?

The other alternative is that I just sit on my hands for a year, and the
next year I get Austria to attack Italy while you and I attack Germany, and
we plan to go into a RAE endgame (I think Austria would win a 1-on-1 fight
against Italy, esp. if I left a unit or two to kick Italy out of Turkey).

As I said, my *main* concern now is not to grow too fast, not to outgrow
the possibility of having *any* allies in the endgame. Already the
observers are calling me the frontrunner, which is a label I am not
comfortable with. I think I'm ok so far, but if I started another little
war and did well in it I would be too big even for such a friendly guy as
you.

So what do you think?

Dear Hohn,

It's awfully tempting. And stepping in to disrupt the north and save the
valiant French resistance fighters appeals to me aesthetically (esp. after
your excellent guess this last move).

But I have a problem. I am afraid that I would do *too* well. If I grew to,
say, ten centers, I'm afraid I would cause practically all the remaining
powers to align against me. And at that point I'm afraid you would be all
too willing to let them do it.

In another game I think my plan right now would be the bold one: I'd stab
both Austria and Germany and maybe even try to snatch Norway, and rely on
France and Italy to stick with me, and then I'd have an awfully good chance
to win the game. But in this game I think that would be stupid of me. Don't
you?

Still, as I said, making a northern move now really does feel right, and I
might do it. I'll have to take the temperature of John and King Kal, maybe
one of them is close to being ready to swap sides if only a little
persuasion is applied.

Comparing notes is interesting. Manus did not tell me about ven-tyo in
advance. He claimed it was part of a failed RI v. A campaign. He did not
tell me about tyo s bur-mun in advance. He sent us that poor excuse
after the fact. Not terribly trustworthy.

France is not out yet. I hope, however, Manus sees that assisting France
is not to his advantage.

Re the east, I'm not so sure we want Austria toasted. Won't that just
put Russia way out on top? We might want to consider GAE v. RI. Your

My preference is to run and get Iberia before Cal does, while you and
Dave take John out.  However, the concern I have with this is that we
will of course need to keep Dave in line, and that line, of course, is
the one separating Venice from Trieste.

FYI, I received a fairly harsh personal attack from Steve, and responded
as I felt it deserved.  I thought he had bad luck, but to call me scum
for playing for an advantage in a game whose point is to create advantages
made me more than a bit upset.

And also FYI, I did not negotiate beyond the deadline.  I meant to send
him a long something before the deadline and did not get to it.  When the
deadline hit, I had to put in orders without negotiating, and I merely
sent him something saying I was doing so.  This was late at night and
I know he was not online, so even if there was something in it that would
make him change his orders, he could not have gotten it before the moves
went through.

I intend to copy this last paragraph to the Master.

I guess I have to agree with that.
My instinct is to try to run and save Hohn, but I don't think this would
get me a good endgame. But this way I can attack Germany and Hohn won't be
saved :)

Now, now.

Steve flies off the handle easily. This is what made us decide in the end
that he would be the better first victim, right? And frankly, I think this
aspect of his personality made him easier to kill. It made him predictable.

My approach is, *say* to him whatever I think will make his moves easy to
predict, and if I want revenge for his words, I get it on the board (and
mission accomplished).


>And also FYI, I did not negotiate beyond the deadline.

I never thought you did.

Ok, so what we'll do is something like this: you go make France cave in,
and Dave and I will try to crush Germany. King Kal will assist you, but I
bet that soon he'll assist us too!

Please do keep a little something back at home so that Dave doesn't decide
you are a very easy target. And I'll do likewise.

Well, my run west will be made on invitation of Hohn ("come save me and/or

Well, you know me (actually, maybe you don't, but) when I said "more than a

think I've *ever* let go of mine.  Not much truly phases me.  In fact, I can't

Yes, I indend to, but given the current disposition of my forces, I'm
looking for suggestions about how to look strong at home.  I would like
to assert a claim to Smyrna, which would give each of the AIR team three
builds from our efforts (Rum, Ank, Swe for you; Gre, Bul, Ser for Dave,
and Con, Smy, Tun for me).  Will you support me in this claim?

Yes, although I of course have some mixed feelings about the Italian build,

a fleet.

I agree.  I'm also quite happy with the way it is trending, and with what
I can read of the west.  I think that the cooperation between the three of
us is very well hidden at the moment.  It's obvious that we are working to
take out Turkey, but the way we did it this turn (the bounce in Vie, the
tap on Gal, the Hold for Rum) made it very hard to see the degree of
cooperation between us.

Yes, and look at all those nasty little green pieces around my dots. (<:.
So far, the indications are that he is planning on heading west, to get
a piece of Hohn before he is gone (blame me for the bad poetry (<:).  He
has said though that he'd like Smyrna and would like me to support his
claim.  I was mildly supportive in my first response, no commitments yet,
but said that I'd like to see fewer of his forces down there.  I suggested
that the army alone would be enough, with Ank s Con - Smy and the fleets
heading west.  That would of course give us a pretty free hand in the fall
depending on what we decided we want to do.  Should you prefer to simply
decline to support him to Smyrna, I may make the appropriate noises to make
him think I'm supporting him, but I'll not consider it a problem.

> I am really thinking it's time to attack Germany. But let me have a little

>
I think I agree, but of course I also need to consider the issue of Italy.
There are a number of different scenarios that might be useful.

1) Russia goes it "solo" in the spring.  You support Con to Smy, but move
your fleet into Con behind it (which Italy would NOT expect).  You also kick
me out of Gal.  At the same time, I might consider kicking Italy out of
Tyrolia (with his permission).

2) Austria takes on Italy in the spring.  You support Con to Smy, I walk into
Con behind you.  I also move into Venice.  If Italy opts for the full attack
on France, which is reasonably possible I think, I could also end up in Tyr.
If we wanted the attack on Germany, I could be in Boh as well (from Gal)
while you could move to Sil from War.

3) We make the full court AIR press in the Spring.  Italy moves to Pie, fleets
go to Tys and Tun and Ion, Con - Smy with Russian support.  Austria moves
to Tyr, Boh and maybe even Sil.  Russia moves to Pru.  We leave the option
open in the fall of taking Ven/Con from Italy.

For all of these, it matters of course what you are going to build.  If we
are going to press Germany you could really use something in the north.  Even
an army in St Pete would be useful as it could go to Fin, leaving you free
to move Swe - Bal, Fin - Swe in the fall.  Or, if you can get English support
for the move, a coordinated attack between North and Swe on Den would be nice.
It would also be nice to not have England totally back of France.  So far Hohn
has not lost any centers and an E/F would still be very powerful.  This lends
some powerful support to the idea of not launching an attack on Germany in
the spring.  England should be able to make a reasonable claim to the right
to a build from France.  A coordinated stab in the fall might take the following
form:

England gets Brest.  England fails to make any supports that would help
Germany get a center.  England and Russia coordinate to take Den.
Russia moves in Pru/Sil.  Austria moves into Tyr/Boh/Sil.

Those are my original thoughts on it all anyway.  Let me know what you hear

We certainly do have them fooled. Heck, even I am confused.

I hope you are now ready to leave off helping France. The only way for
you to gain anything is to take advantage of what England and Germany
have done to reduce him. To put the best light on your moves last turn,
you have earned his trust, with futile efforts on his behalf. In return,
he will no doubt throw as much as possible your way. As I said in an

He told me the same thing. (That he wanted *me* to support his claim.)

I haven't answered him yet, I was going to wait to hear what you thought.

It's fine with me if he takes it. I would *rather* have him have it than I.
It will be easy to wrest it from him if I want to, and if I took it and
then stabbed for a German center, I'd be at nine centers, which is already
getting somewhat scary-looking. (I suspect that ten or eleven would push
the panic button. I am afraid that anything that reveals outright the AR
cooperation will sensitize that button, too.)

Thanks for not slipping on a banana and finding yourself in Venice.  :-)
We need to decide what to do from here.  My plan is to build and move west
to try and get some of Hohn before there's none left.  You and Jamie need
to swing north to take on John.  Your swing will take a long time.  [Read:
please don't get distracted along the way :-}]

Will you support me in a claim to Smyrna?  This would give each of the
AIR team three builds from the effort (Bul, Gre, Ser for you, Swe, Ank,
Rum for Jamie, and Tun, Con, Smy for me).

And FYI, I did *not* negotiate past the deadline.  In fact, I sent Steve
one message beyond the deadline saying that because negotiating beyond
the deadline is verboten, I was simply putting orders in.  That is all
it said.  Thought you should know.

I don't think we have a lot to fear from it, but I have a fair bit of
respect for Hohn's ability, although I've never played against him personally.
I raised this as support for your "don't scare" them caution.  If we
suddenly hammer Germany and Italy, which I think we could do, then we have
to consider that we have an intact France still in play, and if we scare
England in the process we could easily see the two of them allying.  Again,
the position of England is pivotal.

I think I agree.  The tactical situation is very strong for us right now
so I think we can play any scenario we like, the position of England is
the key.  We also need to avoid scaring him however, so I think starting
with the cautious approach is best.  I don't want to present him with the
A/R if it's going to send him into a panic.  Let's see how he responds
to your feelers.  If you think he is receptive, then we can bring it out
into the open.

We can of course postpone the move on either Germany or Italy, although
I do not think we can postpone both.  Well, let's say I don't think we
should, about the only way we could would be to hold a phony war to
explain what our units were doing.  Another build for Italy would really
start to present some issues for me, making a stab rather difficult,
and delaying when I could build a fleet.  Optimally, we'd be able to get
your fleet into Con, mine into Ion and open up Tri for a fleet build.

I'll hold off on a note to England until I hear back from you.

By the way, I have to say *something* to Germany now. So I'm just telling

Quite reasonable.  As you say, you must say something.  I had to exchange
a few notes with him before the last deadline in which I implied that
I was worried about the R/I and that I had made the bad guess of thinking
you were the greater danger so I had moved your way only to have Italy
head into Tyrolia.  I've been working to give the impression, successfully
I think, that I am concerned about both of you, that I certainly don't have
any firm alliance with either of you, and that I'm trying to work out how
to avoid having you sandwhich me and that I basically have no real knowledge
of what either of you is planning.  We've both agreed that not only don't
we know what Italy is up to, but he probably doesn't either.

I think so, but the trick would be to regain Austria's trust after a year.
Maybe if you can manage to take a centre or two from him, he'll grasp at any
chance of you loosening your grip.  Of course, by going through with the
attack on Germany, you should convince him of your sincerity... ;)

The key to this whole thing will be exactly where Manus puts his build.  I
don't know if I've ever seen one single build by a medium sized power hold
so much influence over the course of a game.  If he builds a fleet, I more
or less have to plan on an attack in the Med and must expect a great deal of
difficulty in sticking to the "master plan".  If he builds an army,
everything you and I have planned becomes a LOT easier.  I'm hoping you can
use your considerable influence with Manus to get that army built.  Since he
and Austria are both in desperate need of staying on good terms with you,
you have a good chance to sway him.

I feel like Hari Seldon trying to predict the effects of individual actions
on the "Seldon Plan".

I don't see as where waiting will do anything other than allow Austria and
Italy (or for that matter, Germany) to consolidate their positions.  We must
maintain some momentum for now.

I agree that you shouldn't grow too big too fast or you'll be setting
yourself up as a target.  After the German stab, you and I will have enough
of the appearance of a juggernaut to alarm the rest of the board into an
anti-E/R alliance as it is without our causing it to happen too early.  Our
"master plan" relies on everyone else being in a state of chaos when we
declare ourselves.

Anyway, I'll let you know if I hear anything interesting and you work hard
on Manus.

Depends on how worried he is about the E/G "juggernaut".  I've been pouring
out all kinds of sweetsop as to my friendly intentions towards him and the
Med in general.  I'm just hoping that he has enough A/R-induced paranoia to
not want to turn his back on them.

Heck, I'd LOVE to see Austria survive and Italy gone.  Nothing England loves
more than a fleet vacuum in the Med!  But let's see what develops in the
east and decide where to throw our weight.  No more than a turn or two tops.
We don't want to seem too heavy handed and force a A/I/R against us.  That's
an event that is faced all too often by E/G.

I'd be more than happy to see Italy throw some weight against Marseilles or
Spain.  As I said above, I can't see him trusting A/R enough to devote a
large force to the west and if he only takes one centre, he can be easily
kicked out.

Ok, this is bad, because he's going to build a fleet, but I refuse to let
you off the Master Plan hook.

But don't worry, I have an idea.

>I'm hoping you can

I can't sway him, unless maybe I inform him that Austria is about to stab.
But hold on, hear my new idea.


>I feel like Hari Seldon trying to predict the effects of individual actions
>on the "Seldon Plan".

Ooh, that takes me back a couple of decades!


So anyway, here's the idea.
Manus now intends to sail west, because he wants to go get some bits of
France while the gettin's good. Now I *think* I could get him to stab
Austria fairly soon, that is, grab Mar and Spa and then cut back and stab
Austria. But anyway it would indeed put a crimp in the Plan for Italy to
have a bunch of fleets in the west, or even in the middle of the Med. where
they could get to West Med quickly and stall any invasion of yours.

However, what I think I can do is to get Austria to wait a season or two,
or at most three, and then stick it to Italy. So he'd have his fleets
committed west, then Dave would take advantage of the opportunity, and
Italy would have to rush like hell back home.
Now this means that France collapses relatively quickly, so you are freed a
bit earlier than you might otherwise be, but at the same time you have no
fear of anybody's navy clogging up the Mediterranean or trying to break
through Gibraltar. So you can render France helpless, then help me out
against Germany. And we'd expect to go into the endgame with just you, me,
and Austria as the serious powers. And this makes the Master Plan really a
breeze, because everything I've sketched is actually to Austria's advantage
too, and nobody else could really do much of anything about it.

What do you think of the general idea? I have some more specific ideas too,
but tell me how you like the overall scheme.

I like the _general_ idea, but it begs the question, what are you going to
do in the meantime?  It seems to be similar to your "Plan B" of a previous
letter where we thought about you just killing time for a year or so.

I wonder if the number of units Manus sends west could be kept to a minimum
by keeping him paranoid about Austria?  I don't mind the idea of France
falling quickly (I rather like it, I admit <G>) or even of Manus grabbing a
dot or two.  I just don't want the problem of taking those dots BACK from
him to be any more difficult than it is already likely to be.  We wouldn't
be able to have Austria wait too long to attack.  How sure are you that
David will turn his back on you when you want him to?  ;)

I honestly have no problem with time-killing. I can take this year, for
instance, just to kill off Turkey and I'll choose not to commit myself
otherwise until he's dead.
I can spend another year rearranging my forces, if need be (but I'm hoping
it won't take two full years for you to be in position).
I can begin to attack Germany before you do, as long as it won't cause a
dangerous G/F alliance. I don't mind committing to the attack on G before
you do, that's no problem.
If I have to, I'll sit on my hands. But I don't think I'll have to.

I think the real problem will be: what do I build?
I haven't solved this one yet. :-)


>I wonder if the number of units Manus sends west could be kept to a minimum
>by keeping him paranoid about Austria?

Yep, I can do that.
Let's see, Manus will have five units. I bet he will keep his army
defending Venice. I can suggest that he keep his other army in Turkey, that
shouldn't be a problem either. Of his three fleets, I bet I can keep one as
far east as Ionian. That means he'd just have two fleets against France,
which I believe he expects to be sufficient. Manus has to plan to be
fighting Austria when I am alive and strong and ready to do it too,
otherwise he'd be facing a very powerful opponent alone. So he's apt to be
highly influenced by my timing decisions. If I want him to keep units ready
to fight Austria, I think he has to do it.

Pretty sure, King K., pretty sure indeed. Put it this way: I have more at
stake in that bet than you do!

The problem isn't going to be Austria waiting too long. The problem is
going to be reining him in, getting him to wait a season or two!

You want me to have him contact you about this plan? By my estimate, he's
perfectly ripe for me to sell him on it. Look, it's a great plan for him!
And what are his alternatives? Get into a protracted ground war against me?

See, I've just had a really good opening (perhaps you'd noticed). Some
observers expect me to take advantage of it by striking out all over the
place and spreading white blocks over the map. That would be foolish. But I
do intend to press my advantage in other ways... diplomatically. And since
you and Dave are also in the middle of very good openings, what the hell,
let's go for it.

When the endgame comes, I am at least *pretty* confident that you'll side
with me, not with Dave. And I hope you're at least *pretty* confident that
I'll side with you. I think the on-the-board dynamics will make that the
likeliest Final Alliance, for the reasons we discussed very early in the
game....

My time scale for attacking France will be complicated by the fact that
I'm sure Hohn will do everything he can to make sure that _I_ am the last
person who gets his centres.  Fortunately, with three people attacking
him, he hopefully won't have much luck in this.  It'll take luck (and
Manus!), but there's at least a chance he'll be gone by next year.

Actually, that may make it easier for ME to attack John.  After he turns
to face you, I can use his inevitable request for help to swing a couple
of units north, ostensibly to face you, but which would then fall on him.
That'll give me the advantage of surprise as well. ;)

My results are at home - you get one build, no?  Or is it two?  If only
one, an army in Moscow will be about as non-committal as can be while
still being useful.  I haven't looked at your tactics yet, but that seems
practical.

That makes sense.  Given the position you're in, Austria and Italy pretty
much have to take your whims as orders.  Nice situation, eh?  ;)

Well, your well being pretty much IS my well-being so I'd say
it's about even <G>, but I'll take your word as to your influence with
Austria.  See the above paragraph...

You can have him write to me, but don't say you have done the same.  We
still have to keep our alliance secret from everyone for it to work.  Just
suggest to him that he ask for my support against Italy.  I can nod my
head sagely and give him encouragement.  Sound good?

I agree.  I think the "master plan" has a neat kind of panache here that
will make for a great end game statement.  I am quite committed to seeing
it thru, if for no other reason than to see how well we can pull it off!

I understand.
As I'm sure you know from experience on the wrong end of the stick, it is
often pretty near impossible to choose which of one's attackers will get
one's centers. Unless John plays along with Hohn, of course! But he's not
the type.

Well, yeah, that's what I meant. I meant, it's generally thought to be a
disadvantage to be the first of the team to commit himself to the attack
(for the reason you mention), but in this case I have no problem being
first.

>That'll give me the advantage of surprise as well. ;)

Ah, true.

Yes, one build. And yes, I plan to build A Mos if nothing else comes up
before the deadline. (which is in about 12 hours.)

Oh, ok.
(Those are complicated instructions, but I will consult them again

:)

It does have aesthetic appeal.


Ok, now let me get down to specifics.

What if I show my anti-Prussian cards this Fall? Would that be too early,
would it ruin your attack on France? (Part of my question is, what would
John do exactly -- would he cease hostilities with France, or would he want
to grab the French centers to stock up his forces against me?)

Also: what if I send an army into Scandinavia? Think about it. An army
arrives in Stp. (I could build it there, or send it up from Mos, either
way.) Now everyone can see that I'm going to make a move in the north, but
they have to guess that I'm going after Norway. Maybe you order Nth-Nwy, if
you can spare the F Nth, and I bounce you with Swe-Nwy, and I move my army
into Finland... and then either I go F Swe-Bal and Fin-Swe, you and I take
Denmark together, depending on whether you are ready to show *your*
anti-Prussian cards at that moment.

Ok, I've got an update for you now.
My discussion with England has been somewhat complicated because I didn't
want to tip too much, but I would have to say they've been successful.

However, what you are supposed to do is to write to him and ask him for
support against Italy. You are not supposed to say, "So now it's a big
happy plan among the three of us friendly guys."

The precise reasons for doing it this way are so subtle that I do not fully
understand them myself. :)

What Cal wants is some assurance that after Italy goes over and ruins the
French defense, England won't then have to worry about a major Italian

subterfuge is that he does not want you to think that he and I have an
especially close relationship, so he doesn't want me to be telling you,
"Hey, England and I just cooked up a great plan...."

Do you see the point? (If it doesn't really make complete sense, then
you're in the same boat I am.)

So anyway, you could write to England and say that you understand that
Italy is about to sail west, and that once he's committed you'd expect to
stab him if you felt confident that England would help you out.

Well, I had thought that Turkey had broadcasted an accusation that I
had negotiated beyond the deadline, so I thought I should mail each player
a denial.  Turns out he didn't broadcast it, so the egg is on my face,

Okay, I'll think about this a bit and try and come up with a good
approach.  I'm not quite clear on something though.  Are you
suppossed to have suggested to me that I get in touch with him,
or is it that you implied that I've been in touch with you about
Italy and you expect me to get in touch with him.  i.e.,  which of
the following base lines should I work from:

I've been talking with you about peace as I want to go for Italy and

1) now I'm talking to England on my own as a potential ally.  You and
   I have not discussed England.

2) you have suggested that I get in touch with England, but have not
   revealed that you have talked to him.

3) you have let me know that you have talked briefly with England and
   think he might be receptive and maybe I should try talking to him.

Let me know where to start and I'll send him a note.

It may be too early, but it may not.  Again, it depends on how fast France
is going to fall.  The simplest thing to do is wait for Spring to play out
and see what position Hohn is in.

We'll have to think this one out carefully because as soon as you move on
Germany, it lessens your diplomatic impact on Austria & Italy.  Uncommitted,
you can move against either one.  Committed, your leverage lessens.

All in all, I'd say a Fall attack is _probably_ a good idea.  We'll wait and
see, ok?

In general, I like the idea of you being in Bal & Swe.  It will speed up the
German demise.  Tactically, I'm not sure I can use North for that purpose,
at least in the immediate future as it may be need against the fleet Hohn is
likely to build.  _That_ state of affairs shouldn't last long though.
Again, let's wait and see how the Spring turns out before we decide on this
one.

I'm certainly enjoying this game much more than the last one. ;)

Please send me some idea of your troop movements so I know how quickly the

I would like Smyrna (as I believe I have told both of you).  Since that
seems like it would equitably distribute the profits, and since I seem
to be the one who needs builds the most at the present, and since I
received no objection from youse to my claim on Smyrna, shall we call it

I would like to propose something to you.

How would you like me to attack an unsupported Greece this turn (Spring)
which would allow you to disband your fleet.  I will move out in the Fall
and you rebuild an army.

This seems to be an efficient way to:
   (a) mislead our opponents as to our true alliance (especially while
       we do a bounce ot Tyr+Tri in Venice, or perhaps a Tyr-Tri and
       Tri-Ven?  Of course, when I move out in Fall [unless we have a way
       you can PUSH me out then to make it look like we ARE at each other's
       throats], the jig might be up, but every little advantage is worth it,
       no matter how long it lasts, eh?
   (b) quickly move your most southern unit to your most northern spot,
       and a unit that never would have anything to do for the rest of
       the game except for worrying me, Mr. Med, your bestest friend in
       the whole world.

What do you say?  If you like this, we need to coordinate on my take of
Smyrna, and I don't want either of us to make our holdings (Bul, Con)
attractive to Jamie's eye in the process.  (Just in case, you know....)

Seguro.
(As far as I know! I *hope* that's the plan of all of us. I'm replying just
to you, for now, will reply by PRESS TO AI in a few moments.)

>Please send me some idea of your troop movements so I know how quickly the

Right.
I think both Austria and I should try to stall a moment, so that the timing
is better. What we want, I think, is for Germany to remain engaged with
France until you get there, so Hohn doesn't have a 'change of heart'. But
then we'll jump him, so you'll get (a) a better share of the spoils, and
(b) a better position against England if it comes to that. (But note that I
am still counting on you to help me against Austria if necessary--in a
couple of years, I mean.)

My thought, frankly, is that you probably ought to leave that army pretty
damned close to Venice, and I'd prefer it if you'd bounce Austria in Ven.
But let's see what he thinks. I'm just not sure how much to trust him.

Yes, ok by me, as I'll announce to Austria shortly.

Well, I leave the disposition of A Ven to you two.
I think Manus should leave the exact timing of the German attack to me and
Dave.

Yes, that's simple, but I do have to decide what I'm going to do in the Spring.
And where to build.

Yeah, but if I'm going to try to occupy Swe and Fin, then I have to start
getting the new army into position. So should I build A Stp and move it to
Fin? Or build in Moscow, in order to temporize?

Me too! Similar reasons!

(Actually, I did enjoy the other one, in a totally different way.)

Yeah; this was kind of what I was fishing for when I asked for an idea of
your timing.  I know you both (especially Dave) have a long way to go to
get out of the Balkans and down the steppes, and with Venice sitting there
in ten feet of water, I would very much like to know how Dave plans to
make the journey.

Right.  I want all the spoils I can get, and if I can get westward before
Germany is pulled off him, I'll be seen as either the savior who should
be paid, or the valiant (but too late) protector who should get the centers
lest they fall to those who attacked the poor frog.

Indeed so.  In the slow drag of units from Turkey to Germany, your position
won't ever be bad for kicking off something like this.  Mine, as you know,
is a bit shaky now, with the boot empty, and may be for a while.  We need
to keep Dave honest.  As you point out, I need to know EXACTLY what Trieste
is doing now and from now on.

Thanks for granting me Smyrna.  I'll decide which unit will move (hoping
for your support from Ank) here after the builds.

Greetings King Kal,

As I'm sure you can imagine, the notes have been flying fast and furiously
down here in the south (except for Sultan Steve who has been strangely
silent, I wonder why? (<: ).

Anyway, I'm still trying to solve the problem of being the monkey in the
middle, the natural solution to which is of course to get my neighbors
interested in other areas, which of course means Russia in the north and
Italy in the west.  I think I've been fairly successful in this and am
now quite certain that Italy will head for France and Russia will join me
in an attack on Germany.  While I'm sure you are happy for me, I know that
this will not be the greatest news that you've ever heard.  Certainly better
than Russia attacking you, and I'm sure he won't be doing that, but still
there will be some concern on seeing AIR all moving your way.

I really don't want to see this develop into some sort of massive 2 on 3
or even 3 on 3 stalemate.  That's always an unsatisfactory ending to a
game.  A well fought 2-way, or even a 3-way where the players have brought
themselves to an equilibrium are results I can live with, but I hate large
draws.  I'm also not comfortable being in the middle of IR, even if we are
all heading north.  I don't feel that I have a really solid alliance with
either of them, and they both stand to get more builds out of this than
I do, and they'll still be in a position to crunch me between them.  Given
a choice, Italy is my preferred target of the two.  He's easier to attack
and I'm less certain of his intentions, Manus strikes me as the sort who
might just stab me on a whim at any time.

So, why am I telling you all this?  Well, I've discussed things with Russia
of course in trying to get him moving away from me, and he's mentioned that
there is some chance of you joining in an attack on Germany, sort of a
feeding frenzy if you will (<:, but that you have some concerns about
doing so while Italy is establishing himself in France and building up a
large fleet force.  Personally, I also have some concerns about Russia's
moving into Germany, and where he's going to go afterwards as I'll continue
to be a tempting source of centers.  So, what I'd really like to see would
be a scenario along the following lines:

Italy heads for France, which should destroy whatever defensive lines he's
set up.

Austria and Russia make a move on Germany, probably this fall.

England grabs something from France and joins in against Germany.  The
timing there is up to you, perhaps after the first year?

Before Italy can shore up his home defenses, Austria turns on him.  At that
time, I could also lessen my committment to the German attack, thus slowing
the Russian gains.

You continue your expansion into France and possibly Germany while I take
out Italy and Russia moves into Germany, with both of us tempering our
support so as to keep him from going too quickly.

The builds from Italy will allow me to keep a solid line versus Russia,
and you will of course have control of the northern seas.  France and
Germany will still be around for a while, but as small beleagured powers,
and I think that AE coordination could easily put us into a position where
we could move for a two way ending.  A coordinated attack on Russia would
leave three small powers stuck between the two of us, something we ought to
able to do quite well from.

Well, that's certainly a lot out of the blue!  To put it in a nutshell,
I'd like to be able to point Russia towards Germany without createing a
West vs East stalemate that we'll never get out of.  My real aim is to
take out Italy (thus kind of nuking the East concept (<:) and I want to
be sure that you and I are working together as you would be the instrumental
player in forming the West if you saw the need, and as I would like a long
term ally to work with, and I think we'd make a good pair for it.  I also
think we can hide our degree of cooperation well as we are so far apart
and an eventual joint move by us should have a good chance of surprising
Russia.

If you're still awake, tell me what you think of all this!

Best regards,
Kaiser Dave

The problem is I don't think we'll get even a short term advantage out of
it.  If you were serious about attacking me you'd build an army in Ven.
If you build an army in Ven, I'd think you were serious about attacking me (<:.
In addition, it slows the movement of your fleets to the west.  They'd be
a lot better heading there at full speed if you want to get a build there
soon. (Nap - Tys, Ion - Tun;  Tys - Gol, Tun - Wes) sets you up well to get
another build in two years and with the gain of Smyrna you'll have a build
this year.  If you want a little subterfuge, you could make the above moves
and Aeg - Ion, then in the fall we could bounce in Ven (pie won't be doing
much probably, if it can take Mar, then we do that) and I could move Gre to
Ion, which of course you would leave there to block me.  I'm not sure there
is much to be gained from this though, I think it may just be time to hit
them hard and fast.

To tell the truth, I don't really have a use for another army at this time.
That's not to say that I have any use for the fleet, but I dislike totally
destroying my navy.  I'm still between you and Russia and I'd hate to take
myself out of the play by throwing away my bargaining power.  I can't launch
an attack on either of you with my fleet, but I can make a difference in
the battle between you if it comes to that.  It makes it a little more tempting
for both of you to stay friendly with me.  And I'd hate to present you with
the temptation of actually staying in Greece!

I hope that's not a problem, but I'd rather just go forward with you taking
Smyrna and heading for France while I go for Germany and keep a nice solid
line between you and Jamie's ambitions.

Regards,
Kaiser D
