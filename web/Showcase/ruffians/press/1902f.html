    With all due respect, that was a mistake. You should have waited until
    England was down a few units before making such a move since now you cannot
    be sure of what he will do. All I have to do is conovy *back* to BRE and you
    won't be able to hold the gains you are about to make; England will actually
    gain a unit, and you will be back to the same SC count at the end of next
    year as you started this year with.
    
    I'm all for a good stab, but quite frankly, that was one of the stupidest
    I've seen in years.

    Hi Cyrille,
    
    Well, given the placement of your units, I can't blame you for taking one
    more shot at me, but don't you think you have a little bit more to worry
    about than me?
    
    Turn around, the Italians just kicked your back door in... &lt;g&gt;

    Hi Roland,
    
    I must say I was quite glad to see your move into the Eastern Med.  That
    will give Turkey something to think about.  Let me know if I can be of any
    assistance.  I'll certainly do my best to keep the Turk from making any
    gains against me while you pick away at his belly.
    
    What do you make of the German moves?  My first inclination is that the
    moves to Bel & Bur were false and F/G is just hoping to throw attention away
    from their alliance.  Germany attacking France when he's already at war with
    England (not to mention my F Stp(sc) & A Sil builds) just doesn't seem to
    make ANY sense at all.  Paul's last communication to me certainly indicated
    that he considered Germany & Russia to be at war.  I'm betting he won't be
    in Belgium after next turn.
    
    Let me know if you hear anything interesting and I'll do the same.

    Dear John:
     Stupid is as stupid does.  How was I supposed to stop England from driving
    me away from his shores, anyway?
     And if I did stick it out with you...what did I stand to gain?
    
    The worst that will happen to me is that I'll lose Hol or Den, depending upon
    which
    one I choose not to cover with F Hel.  I'll gain Bel and Par, for a net gain of
    one,
    and I'll be a lot more attractive to England as an ally against you than you
    would be
    for him against me.
    
     Did you give that any thought before you started hollering "stupid"?  I
    doubt it....
    
    &gt;
    &gt; With all due respect, that was a mistake. You should have waited until

    I do hope those were the orders you wanted.
    
    Before you joined, there was a substitute who submitted some orders.
    I noticed that you had submitted orders yourself, and assumed they
    were final, so I removed my WAIT flag.
    
    If you have orders that you are unsure of, and you want to wait a
    while before the orders are processed, the thing to do is
    
    SET WAIT
    
    This will delay the game until the deadline.  Otherwise (as happened
    today), the game will process as soon as all the orders are in (and
    nobody else has a WAIT flag).
    
    To turn off a WAIT flag, the reverse command is
    
    SET NOWAIT
    
    I don't remember how many of these things I explained to you as part
    of Pouchtoo.

    Hi Chris!  Glad to see you're on line.  Hope things have settled down for
    you at work.
    
    What do you make of the German moves?  My first inclination is that the
    moves to Bel & Bur were false and F/G is just hoping to throw attention away
    from their alliance.  That idea seems a little tenuous, but Germany
    attacking France
    when he's already at war with England (and given my F Stp(sc) & A Sil
    builds)
    just doesn't seem to make ANY sense at all.  Paul's last communication to me
    certainly indicated that he considered Germany & Russia to be at war.  I'm
    betting
    he won't be in Belgium after next turn.
    
    Will you be able to spare A Ser to support my fleet in Rumania this turn?  I
    don't think you have to worry about Greece.  With Turkey attacking me and
    Italy coming in his back door, he can't afford to antagonize you - Greece
    may be the safest centre on the board for this turn!
    
    Later,
    
    Cal

    The latter explanation is what happened.  That's a letter in your
    mailbox waiting for you.
    
    It didn't occur to me until Chris's broadcast that perhaps you were
    not expecting the orders to go through right away.  That is how the
    Judge works.  Usually, if you want to wait a bit, you use a WAIT flag.
    
    I forget sometimes that the word "deadline" means something quite
    different to a Judge player than it does elsewhere.
    
    I hope that doesn't spoil things.  I feel bad.  I'm going to go eat

    It seems that robot gms like to publish orders as soon as each participant
    has
    submitted a set....  The moral is, if you're not prepared to live with the
    orders
    submitted, don't send them in!

    Cyrille,
    
    I didn't expect the moves to go through so soon -- those were the orders I
    had before you joined the game!
    
    I should've "set wait".
    
    I will try to find out what Italy plans -- a convoy, or to support the
    attack on Aegean -- Roland and I were working together against Germany, as
    you can see from the moves.  I will let you know.
    
    Not an overwhelming start to our partnership, I know, and I apologize.

    Cal,
    
    I was just getting set to write to you!  Yes, I think we can defend the
    Rumanian fleet -- perhaps offensively?  I am still holding the olive branch
    out to Cyrille, but I think the profit lies in taking him down.
    
    What is your take on Germany this turn?  I think we should go all out on the
    assault, while we can take advnatage of our surpise attack.
    
    Do you think that we can take Munich from Italy any time we want to?  It's
    certainly too far from My lines for me to hold comfortably.  Why don't we
    punch Italy into Munich, and try to get you into Berlin next year?  Once
    your fleet is in the Baltic Sea that should be much easier.
    
    I am considering Serbia -&gt; Bulgaria, supported by Greece.  It seems likely
    to me that that will go, but let me know if that is too risly for your
    liking.

    I made a mistake, it's true, but not the one you think about. My
    intention was to move my fleets against Italy, so I ask to Austria what
    was his intentions. Anyway, with you on another front, if Austria and
    Italy cooperate, I can do nothing. So, I was hoping that they weren't
    playing together, despite the Austrian last moves. He suggested me to
    pusue against you, that's what I did. Anyway, with Germany attacking his
    only ally, it's good for you three. Good luck,

    I've been thinking again (I know, I shouldn't do that) and it occurred to me
    that, if France & Germany really ARE fighting, I've lost the main rationale
    for your continued support and friendship.  Methinx I better come up with a
    new one.
    
    How about this?  If you and I were to go to war, that would turn the East
    into a total melee: A vs R, T vs R, I vs T, I'd try to get I vs A if I
    could.  If nothing else, the mess would take years to clean up.  There would
    certainly be a victor emerge in the West long before the dust settled and
    they'd have the better chance to cross the stalemate line first.
    
    If we take Turkey down for the quick kill, we can turn West before they can
    organize and have the much better chance of a victory for the East.  Whether
    that's a two or three way draw, or one of us manages an outright victory
    (unlikely in a demo game), it still leaves us with the initiative from start
    to finish.
    
    Of course, if the French/German conflict is a phony war, you can ignore the
    above... &lt;g&gt;

     I had many reasons for doing what I did:
    1) The alliance with France was all in the Frog's favor:  he wasn't offering
    me shise out of the English spoils.
    2)  I needed to prove to both yourself and England that I could be useful as
    an ally,
    not just a punching bag.  Maybe E/G can pound on F, and let events in the
    East
    resolve themselves?
    3)Even if I lose Hol or Den this season, I won't lose both.  I'll pick up
    Par and Bel
    for a net gain of one, which is cool under the circumstances, wouldn't you
    say?
    
     Is there any chance that we can call off our petty feud, while we tend

    I'm still puzzling over his move to Bur & Bel, but yes, I DO think we should

    do have options here: you or Italy could support the other into Mun while I
    try to take Berlin, or we could do the move you suggested, the three way
    assault on Mun.  Have to give it some thought.
    
    &gt;I am considering Serbia -&gt; Bulgaria, supported by Greece.  It seems likely
    &gt;to me that that will go, but let me know if that is too risly for your

    I'll leave it up to you.  It IS the best (only?) chance at taking a centre
    from him.  I'm going to have to decide if he's REALLY going to need the army
    in Armenia to cover Smy/Syr or not.  Actually, either way, he's likely to
    move Bul-Rum.  If you support my fleet in Rum from Ser and F Rum support F
    Gre-Bul(sc), that has a a fair shot at working, no?

    To the Prime Minister:
     Now that I have proven my willingness to REALLY change sides in the
    West,
    I have only to sell you on the idea that it might be profitable for you
    to join G/E
    vs F.
     First off, I am off of your borders.  I am situated in the heart of
    France, and I'm
    eating my way in like a cancer....  Unless John somehow gets you to
    support him
    back into Bel, or unless you leave a dot open for him to march into, he
    stands to
    lose two units this winter.
     I have no room for two builds (even if I should be so lucky as to
    keep both Den
    and Hol); so perhaps I should leave Belgium to you?  I could move
    Bel-Pic this
    Fall, strengthening my claim to Brest in 1903.
     As you know, I am threatened by my A/I/R-headed neighbors.  If I
    disintegrate
    early, Russia will have a couple of northern fleets looking for
    someplace else to go.  Wouldn't that be likely to be you?  My point here
    is that you have better things
    to do than to support the Tsar vs. Germany; I can be the barrier holding
    him back
    from you!
     So...what do you think?

    &gt;me shise out of the English spoils.
    &gt;2)  I needed to prove to both yourself and England that I could be useful
    as
    &gt;an ally, not just a punching bag.  Maybe E/G can pound on F, and let events
    in the East
    &gt;resolve themselves?
    &gt;3)Even if I lose Hol or Den this season, I won't lose both.  I'll pick up
    &gt;Par and Bel for a net gain of one, which is cool under the circumstances,
    wouldn't you
    &gt;say?
    &gt;
    &gt;     Is there any chance that we can call off our petty feud, while we tend
    &gt;to our own gardens?
    
    
    To be honest, I'm not sure how I can.  Austria has been gung ho for this
    move into Sil/Boh/Tyo and I can't affford to disappoint him right now.  I'm
    too vulnerable to any sort of A/T.  Also, to reduce that vulnerability, I
    need a couple of centres and you're about the only source of that right now.
    Obviously, other events could change this but that's the situation right
    now.  The players we have in this game are too good to let the board remain
    static, so we'll see what happens.  I'll keep in touch.

     The only German dot that you've got the remotest shot at this
    season is Den, and
    I can block you there (and I will).  Your land units are just a little
    busy, aren't they?
     You won't distract my A Kie from supporting A Mun, so favors owed
    IE will
    be favors deferred....
     Won't England be curious to know what your northern fleets have
    planned after
    I am gone (if indeed I do go--I'm in no bloody hurry)?  I'm a stubborn
    son of a gun;
    taking me out won't just be a matter of a couple of seasons....
     Watch.

    Hi Christian!
    
    Now THAT was an unexpected turn of events.  I'm not sure what Paul was
    thinking by attacking his only ally when the rest of the board was lining up
    against them, but methinx he's going to pay for it.
    
    Have you heard from France yet?  I would imagine he'd be more than ready to
    back off a little so he can face Germany.  That should leave you a lot
    healthier than we had expected.
    
    I'll let you know if I hear anything interesting from F or G.
    
    Later,

    Who knows where our illustrious Master is, who can explain this
    better than I, but there is a little command called "set wait"
    that it is worth knowing about, and its corresponding command
    "set nowait".
    
    The "default" is to set nowait, which means that you agree to
    allow the moves to process as soon as everyone has orders in.
    If you want to submit draft orders and continue to negotiate,
    it is better to "set wait" (put this on one line before
    beginning your orders after the signon line).
    
    Please, please, please, ask Rick or me if you have any
    "process" questions.  He took over mastering this series
    because he is more Judge savvy than I, but I have mastered
    games before too.

    &gt; Hi Roland,
    &gt;
    Greetings!
    
    &gt; I must say I was quite glad to see your move into the Eastern Med.  That
    &gt; will give Turkey something to think about.  Let me know if I can be of any
    &gt; assistance.  I'll certainly do my best to keep the Turk from making any
    &gt; gains against me while you pick away at his belly.
    &gt;
    Well, I have a Austrian that keeps troubling me. And with the french fleets
    in Mid and Spa they threaten my Tun...
    
    &gt; What do you make of the German moves?  My first inclination is that the
    &gt; moves to Bel & Bur were false and F/G is just hoping to throw attention away
    &gt; from their alliance.  Germany attacking France when he's already at war with
    &gt; England (not to mention my F Stp(sc) & A Sil builds) just doesn't seem to
    &gt; make ANY sense at all.  Paul's last communication to me certainly indicated
    &gt; that he considered Germany & Russia to be at war.  I'm betting he won't be
    &gt; in Belgium after next turn.
    &gt;
    I think you might be right. A convoy to Lon from Belgium seems likely.
    
    &gt; Let me know if you hear anything interesting and I'll do the same.
    &gt;

    Dear Christian;
    
     In my previous letter, I was busily at work and was talking without
    a real
    chance of even looking at a map.  Sorry.
     I guess that you might rather support yourself in London than try
    for Belgium.
    Plus, the Russian A Sil escaped my notice; both Mun and Ber are
    threatened!
    I will have to guess whether to double support Mun, or cover Berlin from
    Kie.
     I will still be a healthier ally for you vs. France than John would
    be against
    me.  France should be removing a unit this Winter; I may yet be building
    one!

    Cyrille:  I could not help noticing that you wrote, before the moves came
    out:
    
    &gt;  But I'm more
    &gt; troubled concerning France. He is in great situation. I understand that
    &gt; you play with him, but I think you don't have to hesitate to ask more
    &gt; gains than him....
    
    Then you wrote, after the moves came out, to criticize my attack on France.
    Which is your "official" position?
     He was offering me NO gains this gameyear at English expense.  I was
    forced
    to fend for myself!
     I will hold off the Russian, but it will probably cost me Munich to
    Italy or

    Cal,
    
    I think one of the things that I most respect about the way you've played
    this game is your care for the long-term.  No panty-waist thinking two
    seasons ahead for you, no-sir-e-bob!  It's refreshing to find someone else
    who tries to see the whole ebb and flow of the board and figure out where
    it's headed.
    
    Regarding specifically our next set of moves, though, I think you suggested
    that I move from Greece to Bulgaria -- alas, I don't actually OWN Greece
    yet, so that is out.  Moving Serbia to Bulgaria, OTOH, remains an option.
    
    Roland has panicked regarding my move to Trieste -- now I have to calm him
    down -- would you mind dropping him a line and telling him I have no hostile
    intent to him?  far from it!
    
    More and more I am believing that the German stab was genuine -- poorly
    timed, but genuine.  I remember the first time I was jumped in1902 by A/I,
    and it totally caught Me of guard.  With us squabling over Trieste, he
    probably figured he had another year or 2 before having to worry about it.
    
    I'll keep looking at things, and see what leaps to mind -- can you believe
    Christian failed to defend liverpool?  Bad enough letting the convoy
    succeed, but not moving to yourkshire from Edi!  That's not world champ
    caliber play, if you ask me!   ;)

    Heck, that's the only way to play.  I remember a bull session at CanCon on
    how to play and someone said they couldn't imagine thinking all the way
    ahead to end game friom 1901.  I told them I couldn't imagine NOT thinking
    like that.  Oh well, more cannon fodder for me!  d;-})
    
    &gt;Regarding specifically our next set of moves, though, I think you suggested
    &gt;that I move from Greece to Bulgaria -- alas, I don't actually OWN Greece
    &gt;yet, so that is out.  Moving Serbia to Bulgaria, OTOH, remains an option.
    
    I'm at work and trying to remember the board.  Would you be open to the idea
    of supporting my fleet to Bulgaria?  If it worked, it would net us BOTH a
    centre and hold off Cyrille.  If not, the status quo should be maintained
    (with you gaining Gre, of course).  I'll have to stare at the board some
    when I get home tonight to see how feasible this is, but let me know your
    initial reaction.
    
    &gt;Roland has panicked regarding my move to Trieste -- now I have to calm him
    &gt;down -- would you mind dropping him a line and telling him I have no
    &gt;hostile
    &gt;intent to him?  far from it!
    
    He has already communicated his suspicions to me.  I will do my best to cue
    him in to your gentle and forgiving nature...  &lt;g&gt;
    
    &gt;More and more I am believing that the German stab was genuine -- poorly
    &gt;timed, but genuine.  I remember the first time I was jumped in1902 by A/I,
    &gt;and it totally caught Me of guard.  With us squabling over Trieste, he
    &gt;probably figured he had another year or 2 before having to worry about it.
    
    &gt;From the three letters I've had from Paul since yesterday, I have to agree
    with you that the stab was real.  It's his reasoning that I find SURreal.
    He either made a real bonehead move or one of incredible subtlety.  He SAYS
    he's trying to convince England and I that his continued survival can be of
    use to us.  At first glance, that sounds a bit far out to me.  On reflection
    however, when you think about the way the rest of the board was shaping up
    against F/G, it MAY have been a really, really shrewd move on Paul's part.
    He throws what we all thought was the "established scheme of things" into
    total chaos and then tries to hang around long enough to pick up the pieces.
      Hell of a gamble to take, but it was probably a better move in the long
    run.  If he had stayed with France, they would have had four other countries
    against them.  Interesting...  If I'm right about that, he's a really scary
    player.  Of course, maybe it WAS just a bonehead move... &lt;g&gt;
    
    &gt;I'll keep looking at things, and see what leaps to mind -- can you believe
    &gt;Christian failed to defend liverpool?  Bad enough letting the convoy
    &gt;succeed, but not moving to yourkshire from Edi!  That's not world champ
    &gt;caliber play, if you ask me!   ;)
    
    I see your point about the convoy, but isn't he still able to cover
    Liverpool in the Fall?  Again, I don't have the board in front of me, but I
    thought he had an army available.
    
    Talk to you later,

    DOH!  Of course, you are right -- Edi does connect to Liverpool -- I wonder

    I have had a busy workweek, my wife is pregnant, and I have a head cold.
    Not a pleasant combination!
    
    2nd, for the move to Trieste -- You read my confusion at the orders going
    through (what I thought was) a week early?  I had sketched in those orders
    more than a month ago -- you will recall that we had a bit of a dispute over
    Trieste in Fall 01?  I barely remember it myself, but I must've decided to
    cover my bases way back when.
    
    In any case, I do apologize -- Vienna would have suited my purposes better,
    you know.  I do consider us allies, and want to continue working together.
    Let us find a way to resolve this situation without losing a working
    relationship.  I am working to convice Cal that you should recieve our
    support into Munich, which I hope makes up for the unpleasantness of my
    being in Trieste.
    
    Assuming we are still working together (!), I have some thoughts on how to
    crack Turkey -- Cyrille has gone silent on me, but perhaps he is talking to
    you?  Clearly you can penetrate the Aegean now, or perhaps attempting a
    convoy would be more fruitful?  Next year I can leave Greece and move to the
    Aegean if that is what needs to happen.
    
    one last time, I am very sorry for the move to Trieste, and not writing
    sooner.  I think we have a winning alliance, and that we should stick to it,
    but I recognize that unplanned for moves and lack of communication are death
    to a good relationship.  I will endeavor to do better in the future, I don't
    play on the judges very much!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Cyrille,
    
    The orders that went through were the ones I had written before you joined
    the game -- I don't play on the judges either, and expected I had a week to
    change them.  Why would I lie to you so blatently and so crudely when I had
    nothing to gain?

    &gt;Have you heard anything from Austria?
    &gt;He says he is trying to get you to support me into Mun...
    &gt;
    &gt;Well, you could do something else this turn. I will have to move to Ven.
    
    He HAS been trying to talk me into supporting you into Munich.  I'm just
    trying to decide if I want to do that or take a shot at Berlin.  I suspect
    I'll probably offer the support (if you're interested), but I need to spend
    some time staring at the board before I make a decision.
    
    So far he seems sincere.  I think the French/German situation has him
    wanting to take Turkey down fast so we can resolve the East quickly.  After
    Turkey goes, I think ONE of us has to watch out.  For now though, I'm PRETTY
    sure that Venice is safe.  It's your decision though on whether or not to
    cover it, but it would be nice to see Germany lose something.
    
    Later,

    No, you two should find something else to do with A Boh and A Sil.
    
    In the south I do not know. I need a build soon to be able to stoop France
    from entering the Med.
    I expext you want Gre, else we could do like this:
    F Eas S F Gre - Aeg, A Tun - Ion - Gre, F Ion C A Tun - Gre.
    
    That way I will be able to use F Ion and a new fleet westward while we take
    on Turkey.

    'ruffians':
    
    
    Gentlemen,
    
    The three of us have been negotiating seperately, I thought it might behoove
    us to negotiate together!
    
    Cal, Roland has come up with a plan ( which I have modified slightly)
    whereby both he and I can get a build, and it leaves him in good position to
    go fight France.
    
    It's like this :
    
    we could do like this:
    F Eas S F Gre - Aeg, A Tun - Ion - Gre, F Ion C A Tun - Gre.
    
    That way I will be able to use F Ion and a new fleet westward while we take
    on Turkey.&gt;&gt;
    
    This was the original plan, and not a bad one.  But howabouthis?
    
    Italy:
    
    F Eastmed -&gt; Aegean
    F Ionian C A Tunis -&gt; Greece
    A Tunis -&gt; Greece
    
    Austria:
    
    F Greece -&gt; Bulgaria
    A Serbia S F Greece -&gt; Bulgaria
    
    Russia:
    
    F Rumania -&gt; Black Sea
    
    The Result?  Italy builds one, Austria builds one, Turkey down one.
    
    My reasoning is this:  With the possibility of the convoy to Smyrna/Syria,
    Turkey can't afford to keep fighting Russia -- not aggresively, anyway.  He
    will most likely turtle up, and try to wait things out until one of us gets
    jumpy.  The plan would most likely work even without Rumania cutting
    possible Black Sea support, but it cannot fail if that attack happens.
    
    This enables Italy to build another Fleet, and me to build another Army, and
    for us to start our push through the middle and around both ends in a
    co-ordinated fashion.
    
    The only possible downside to this plan would be Turkey supporting Black sea
    to Sev, or Bulgaria to Rumania.  But these moves can both be effectively
    thwarted by
    
    Russia:
    
    A Ukraine S A Sev -&gt; Rum
    A Sev -&gt; Rum
    
    When I say effectively thwarted, I mean that  either the move to Rumania is
    blocked or (in My opinion ;) it should be worth the loss of one SC (sev) to
    get a fleet into the Black Sea, yes?
    
    I am all for this plan.
    
    Now, as to the Oktoberfest currently scheduled for Fall 1902 in Munich!
    
    We have 3 units total around munich, which is the same # Germany has
    available to defend.  But!  He has an open center in Paris, he is unlikely
    to be dislodged from Belgium, and one of his units SHOULD go to defend
    Berlin.  This means, that in my mind, ANY supported attack on Munich will go
    through, as it will probably hold unsupported.  I see germany ordering thus:
    
    A Belgium Hold
    A Burgundy -&gt; Paris
    A Munich S A Kiel -. Berlin
    A Kiel -&gt; Berlin
    F Helgoland -&gt; Denmark
    
    Now, if we assume that England and France aren't going to team up against
    him, (a moderately safe assumption)  then he will gain Belgium and Paris,
    and even if he loses Munich, he will build one.  If we don't take Munich, he
    will be building two, playing one short.  The imminant arrival of the
    Russian Fleet in the Blatic Sea would make it unlikely that he will hold all
    that he has gained in France, but beyond that -- if we don't press our
    advantage this season, well, it seems unlikely that we will be AS able to
    next.  As well, the more the three of us co-operate, the more likely E/F/G
    are going to get it into their heads to try and stop us -- so we should be
    pressing for Tempo.
    
    Now, Roland, you  have expressed concern over my move to Trieste.  I have
    apologized, but we must deal with the reality of the situation.  It is clear
    to me that my best interests lie with working with you, Roland.  Cal and I
    alone would take FOREVER to crack Turkey, and if you were actively helping
    Cyrille, well, forget about it!  I am, I think, a fairly good player, and I
    will not stab for one center in 1902, when I am fairly surrounded by your
    units and you have a potential ally who can help you against me immediatly
    (Turkey).
    
    I propose that we support you into Munich, giving you TWO builds.  I can
    think of two other options -- 1) that you move to Piedmont, while I move
    Trieste -&gt; Tyrolia, leaving the attack of Germany to Cal and I, whilst you
    go against France, 2) you and I bounce in venice, leaving your unit in place
    for another attack next season.
    
    Cal, if Roland doens't feel he can accept our support into Munich, I propose
    that I Support you in.  You bear the brunt of the risks in the south, and I
    have explained my reasoning for thinking that Munich will be unsupported.
    
    I am looking forward to speaking to you both again, seperately or together!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Hi Chris!
    
    "I think we should use all three units on an assault on Munich, but I
    respect Roland's reasoning and preference for covering Venice.  I'll move to
    Munich and we'll see what happens."
    
    For the record, what I wrote in the other letter was, shall we say, "less
    than sincere".  I think he's being stubborn and unrealistic.  What you wrote
    about your not being dumb enough to stab for one lousy centre was right on
    the mark.  We're losing a great chance to make some decent progress and get
    a jump on the West (I believe you called it "tempo"?).  Well, that's a good
    name for it and we're losing a chance to establish it much earlier than one
    theatre usually gets a chance.
    
    Let's go along with him for now, but as soon as he gets embroiled with
    France, we take him out.  I hope to be far enough around in the north that
    we won't give ourselves THAT big a disadvantage with the loss of his fleets
    in the Med.

    &gt; /Christian
    
    That's the right idea.  I'll have to decide whether to support Mun with Bur
    and Kie;
    cover Ber with Kie and Mun with Bur; leave Mun to the wolves, and head for
    Paris.  My inclination is to head for Paris; too much guesswork is involved
    in
    trying to defend Munich....
     If I lose Mun while gaining Bel and Par, I will get another army this
    winter.
     France brags that just convoying his A Wal-Bre will win him Paris back;
    wouldn't he need a support?  Assuming that my A Mun is dislodged, it can
    retreat to Bur and make me even stronger in France.  If he removes F Eng this
    Winter, I will move A Bel to Pic in the Spring (to join Par vs. Bre).  You
    can pick up Bel at that time, as my contribution to you for becoming my ally.
    
     We choke off France quickly, and still hold off the A/I/R/head alliance
    before they totally dominate the centerboard.  I'm sure that you are wary of
    Russian
    fleets to your east and Italian fleets to your south!

    Hi cal, I will move back of course. As I say, it was my intentions. In
    fact, I need an ally to trust to survive, between Austria and Italy, and
    I don't want to attack you. With A/I against I, I'm dead, even if you
    don't engage in the fight against I. You already have your own war to
    lead in the North. But with the German attack of France (nothing was
    unbreakable did you say), it will be quite easy now. For me, I can hope
    just this turn more, then I will just have to defend my poor centers
    during a couple of years.
    Good luck for the game.

    I don't see the point in antagonizing him right now.  Aside from my obvious
    preference for taking a shot at Silesia, why not give him a chance to at
    least start heading west?  By doing what you propose, you'll scare him into
    an alliance with Turkey.  We certainly can't stand against that - at least
    not without getting bogged down while E/F/G get their houses in order.

    It

    &gt;What word from the West?  I have heard from noone since the last turn!
    
    
    I've been talking to Germany who isn't impressed with my unit positioning,
    (to say the least) and I just got a very short note from England, noting his
    improved lot in life and asking my intentions.  Of course, I told him I was
    going to attack Germany, grab a couple of dots and then stab you.  So, if
    that rumour gets back to you, at least you know who started it...  d;-})

    I had a bad look at the map. Of course, you can also take Venice, while
    you offer Italy Munich. 2 advantages : Germany will be more resistant to
    Russia, and Italy will soon collapse. So we should adopt the tactic I

    Okay, I've had a look at the proposed plan and I am willing to go along with
    it.  Since I am taking the most risk here, I will accept the offer of
    support into Munich from Silesia.  Since I think less of the odds of this

    I think we should use all three units on an assault on Munich, but I respect

    and we'll see what happens.

    &gt; England is quite wary of a large Russia to his East, allied to a strong
    &gt; Italy to his
    &gt; south.  He sees that as ample reason to join me vs. France.
    &gt;      Since I can't take Par, cover Ber AND defend Munich, I have to just let
    &gt; Mun
    &gt; go....
    &gt;      I will cover Den and Ber, and take Par/Bel.  That should net me a build
    &gt; this
    &gt; winter!  France will remove 2, and not be as tough to defeat as he plans to
    &gt; be.  In
    &gt; fact, he should drop quite quickly.  His tough luck.
    &gt;      France was out of position to help me vs the A/I/R-head alliance, even

     &gt; Thanks for all.
     &gt;
    
    Some types of impossible orders are allowed.  Some are not.  For
    example, any fleet anywhere can write a "convoy" order for any army on
    the board.  Some kinds of impossible supports are allowed, like
    A Bul S A War - Gre, for example.  However, A Bul S A Mos - Sev is
    not allowed by the Judge.
    
    What's going on here?
    
    In the first case, the Judge does all of its error checking for convoy
    routes with the convoying armies.  Fleets are allowed to write illegal
    convoy orders, but armies are not.
    
    In the second case, the Judge allows any unit to support any action
    into a neighboring province.   It basically only checks whether the
    target province is next to the province containing the supporting unit
    (putting aside for now the question of unit type.)  Thus, even though
    it is impossible to order A Warsaw -&gt; Greece, the army in Bulgaria
    could be given this order.  It would not allow A Bul S A Mos - Sev
    because it checks to see  if Bulgaria is next to Sevasatpol.  Once it
    sees that this is not the case, the support is not allowed.
    
    So, some kind of joke orders can be parsed by the Judge and used by
    players, while others cannot.  The distinction between the different
    types is somewhat arbitrary.

    Well, it's a hard game for me. The main difference with FTF, that I use
    to practice, is that you can never "put the pressure" over a player, and
    look at him when he gives his orders, to see whether he's stabbing you
    ot not. Nevertheless, it's probably more diplomatic, but I don't think
    there is as many turnovers of ally during the game, as there is in FTF.

    Hello again Roland,
    now I saw the results. I guess you'd better have one more army and one
    less fleet. Of course, we will find an agreement to change the position
    of our fleets, and now that french maritime power is no more a threat,
    you need land power. So, I think the best retreat is a destruction,

    I hope that you will not repeat your last turn's support. Cause maybe

    could, I suggest we both leave the Black Sea. You have your own war in

    Turkey and a strong Austria. With me, there's a balance in the South;
    without me, Austria will have to choose, but with YOU in Germany, it

    &gt;
    &gt;Hi Cal,
    &gt;now we're in better position.
    &gt;I hope that you will not repeat your last turn's support. Cause maybe
    &gt;one day Austria will do it. You see I move back Caucasia. As soon as I
    &gt;could, I suggest we both leave the Black Sea. You have your own war in
    &gt;Germany, and I don't think you'll be in a better situation with a dead
    &gt;Turkey and a strong Austria. With me, there's a balance in the South;
    &gt;without me, Austria will have to choose, but with YOU in Germany, it
    &gt;will be the same for him to move in Russia or in Germany.
    
    Actually, I think that, after that last turn, we have LOTS to talk about.
    Like our respective futures....
    
    Austria has not been at all honest in his dealings with either myself or
    Italy since the start of the game.  I, for one, don't like having someone
    next to me who cannot be counted on to tell ANY truths.  It's just too
    dangerous.
    
    Here's what I propose: how about you and I just go right back to the start
    and forget what happened between myself and your predecessor?  I suggest we
    team up and remove a very dangerous and untrustworthy enemy in Austria.
    With our position, we can do this fairly quickly and still be able to fight
    the Western powers (who are in real chaos right now).
    
    If you're interested, we can try to work out some tactics.  Please let me
    know what you think of this idea.

    Greetings!
    
    &gt; I'll see what I can do. Austria has been less than honest with both of us.
    &gt; I really thought he was sincere about not trying for Venice.  I suggest we
    &gt; both work on Turkey.
    &gt;
    Yes, but I do not have many untis to do anything with. Any plans?
    
    &gt; I'll let you know what I hear.
    &gt;
    Good, m too.

    &gt; Hello again Roland,
    
    Greetings!
    
    &gt; now I saw the results. I guess you'd better have one more army and one
    &gt; less fleet. Of course, we will find an agreement to change the position
    &gt; of our fleets, and now that french maritime power is no more a threat,
    &gt; you need land power. So, I think the best retreat is a destruction,
    &gt; followed by the build of an army
    
    Good suggestion, sorry I did not receive your letter before deadline.
    
    What can we do this year?
    I hope you do nothing to help Austria.
    
    &gt; Good luck

    Russia: with Germany's build, deaspite your taking Munich, he will likely
    boot you out of Munich in the spring. Would you consider using A MUN to hit
    BUR so that that support is cut and I can throw him out of Paris? That mean
    he will not build next year, and you will have an ally (me) who is hell-bent

    well you've got a lone army in Munich with no units to support it. He's got
    an army in BER, BUR and KIE after his builds  :) so we got one chance to put
    your army to good use and cost him a center

    Dear Chris:
     I have to cover both Kie and Den vs. the Russians this coming
    Spring.  If you
    could spare your F Nth to support my F Hel-Den, it would free my A Kie
    to support
    A Ber-Mun (on the supposition that Russia might order F Baltic-S-A
    Mun-Kie).
     If necessary, I'd rather support YOU into Den than allow Russia
    into there....
    If your F Nwy cut Swe, it might increase the odds of  F Nth-Den
    succeeding.  Then
    again, if Russia doesn't build in StP your F Nwy could sail into the
    Russian home
    dot, couldn't it?
     I can control France by hitting Pic with Bel, and Gas with Bur.
    Both his
    possible supports for an attack on Paris would be cut.
     The I/A moves were certainly strange, and only partly coordinated
    at that.  Did
    they just invite Russia to move into the centerboard and then turn their
    backs?  What
    is in it for them to have the Tsar's troops virtually in an arc over
    their northern
    frontier?
     Turkey's diplomatic endeavors with Austria seem to have fallen on
    deaf ears.
    Is Austria really so committed to Russia advancing to his east as well
    as to his
    north?
     Risky business!

    Hi Roland,
    sorry for the mistake. I didn't knew that (A Tun - Gre) was a negociate
    move. As I say, I use to play FTF games, short by nature (7 or 8 years).
    So, I know only some Lepanto's way. I must recognize that for me, most
    of the time, a Lepanto ends in Austria:-), cause Turkey is too far, and
    too strong in defense.
    According to negociation, the previous message that I receive from you
    was the one saying that you were considering the France's situation, ans
    since now, nothing. It's true that I don't mail you, but you were
    attacking you, and I didn't want to lie too much. My intention was to
    attack Ionian ( I guess your convoy was in Syria), and so I ask Austria
    for a support. Anyway, without an help, with 3 hostile neighbors, I am
    dead. A strong argument was the fact that, as I would never let BlaS
    empty, Italy would gain all my centers, nothing for the other guys:-)
    Now, I must look carefully at the map, but I don't think I will stab
    Austria. But it is possible for me to help him, not really
    efficiently:-)

    Hi Cal,
    thanks for the fast reply. I think that now Austria is not really
    poupular versus you and Italy. I agree with you. We should forget our
    old problems. But I have a question : why did you send your FLEET in
    Rumania. There, a fleet can act ONLY against Turkey. You need an army to
    have an action versus Austria. It's probably a reason also for the past
    R/T war. As soon as possible, I think a good idea would be the
    destruction of this fleet, followed by the build of an army, but this is
    another story. Before that, I think you need to envisage to shift the
    position of your units. Unless that, what can we do?
    Possibly, you can then move F Rum-Sev, A Ukr-Sev, and A Sev-Ukr. With
    your present position, what can we do directly against Austria? Of
    course, we need to find some arrangments, cause I don't think such a
    move is possible, unless you ask it NICELY to Austria:-)
    I need to think at the board game. Let me know about your ideas.

    Hi Chris,
    it seems that you're not really popular in Russia and Italy ( for him, I
    must say that I can understand :-) ). Nevertheless, I choose you as an
    ally, and I will try to do the game. In fact, it's more you that choose
    me as an ally, thanks for that. The main opportunities of gain are
    against Russia, for me, and Italy for you. I'm sure we would easily find
    a way to take advantage of our position, especially with Russia fighting
    Germany, strong in power, but weak by his position. France probably lose
    the game, and he'll surely do all that he can for anybody, at the only
    condition that it is against Germany. Unfortunately, I'm too far to take
    advantage of it:-)
    You'll talk more after the builds.

    &gt;
    &gt; Cyrille:  That was the funny thing.  France assumed that I was still
    &gt; fanatically anti-
    &gt; England, even though I had a Russian F StPsc to deal with.  He never
    &gt; breathed a
    &gt; hint of supporting my F Nth-Lon (the only anti-Eng option left to me last
    &gt; Spring)
    &gt; so I assumed the worst--that he might be joining Russia in the middle!
    &gt;      Evidently, he expected me to just move F Nth-Nwg and just "keep Eng A
    &gt; Edi
    &gt; busy."  That wasn't good enough for me with the wolf at my door, and he
    &gt; should
    &gt; have recognized that.
    &gt;      You know, he COULD still talk me into pulling A Bur back into Munich,
    &gt; and
    &gt; Paris into Bur.  But no word since he called my stab "the stupidest he has
    &gt; seen in
    &gt; 10 years."  That indicated to me that he didn't take me seriously (or was
    &gt; prone to
    &gt; overstatement.)
    &gt;      No, I am no angry with you.  I'll keep at least half of the Russian
    &gt; units busy, so
    &gt; that you have a chance!
    &gt;      I DO wish that Austria would have told me that he was pulling back last
    &gt; Spring.
    &gt; I could have supported myself in Munich!
    &gt;      Good luck on your end!    --Paul

    Cal,
    
    Well, I imagine I am not too popular in the halls of the October Palace
    Right now, but I thought I might offer up an explanation as to why I didn't
    give you a 'heads up' on my change of plans before it went through.
    
    And I did start to write that letter -- but then, I thought again, and I
    said to myself -- "What good will this do?"  By my reasoning, Munich would
    still be undefended (Called that, didn't I?), so you would get your build.
    Aside from giving you the opportunity to talk me OUT of the decision, what
    would telling you I was turning on Roland do?
    
    Lets examine that decision for a moment.   It all hinges on Roland's
    unwillingness to keep moving forward, and his desire for Greece.  Neither of
    these decisions are good ones, in my opinion, and Both of them waste time
    that we are going to need if we are to take advantage of the confusion in
    the West.   So, Do I want an ally who makes Bad decisions, wastes time, and
    keeps me Boxed in?
    
    No, I don't.  Now, lets take another look at the board.  I don't like stabs
    that net 0 centers, and that is what this appears to be on the surface of
    it.  However, I am counting on two things -- 1.  Italy's forces are
    scattered, and he is unable to defend himself.  2. Turkey's forces are
    scattered, and he is unable to defend himself.  THREE things 3. You and I
    have had good relations from the beginning, and between us, we can handle
    Turkey, Italy and Germany.
    
    My plan, and I think it is a good one( heheheh  ;)  is to string Turkey
    along for one season -- maybe two, depends.  With Cyrille disrupting the
    Ionian, I should be able to get armies into the Boot, and that'll be all she
    wrote for Roland, mvh.  Cyrille cannot defend himself -- if you slip an army
    into Armenia now, and in the fall I show him the knife by taking Bulgaria,
    his brief expansionary thrust will be over.
    
    In the end, I had to go after Italy or You to have avenues to expand.  You
    have fertile pastures in the north and in Germany to occupy you now, while I
    can pursue a meditteranean campaign.  I think this makes for a stronger
    alliance than A/I/R, especially with Roland so far behind our tactical
    curve.
    
    In any case, this move was in no way intended to harm you, or our
    relationship, which, needless to say, I regard as the most important one I
    have.  I apologize if the shock of this was unpleasant, but I think that
    looking at the board, you will agree that the situation is a workable one.
    
    Please let me know your thoughts upon this change in the wind,
    
    Best,

    today.  One does not assume a move to someone's home center is OK because
    they didn't say "NO, YOU MAY NOT MOVE THERE, NOW OR EVER!"
    
    As for that, why then get so upset with the move to Trieste on my part?  It
    was intended to do two things, as I have said before -- 1) move to serbia,
    after serbia moved to Bulgaria, and 2)  Make Sure you didn't decide to move
    to Trieste again -- heck, I hadn't told you NOT to, right?
    
    So now we fight.  I would rather not be here, but after the fiasco of Fall
    1901, and then your refusal to continue with the plan to attack Germany, I
    didn't see any other choice for me.  I'll take my chances with Cyrille.
    
    Best,
    
    Chris
