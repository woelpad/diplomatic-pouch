    I am writing you to ask for help.
    Would you consider attacking A Mun - Trl?
    In that case I could try to retake Ven.

    To the Pope:
     As you know, Austria can support his A Ven with A Tus.  My cutting
    his A Tyr
    won't assure your getting Ven back, unless his A Tus is headed for
    Rome....
     You might as well accept my offer of support for A Pie-Mar.  That
    will hurt my
    enemy, and give you a dot with which to keep alive and fighting.

    Hello Chris, hope the hurricane doesn't hurt your family. In France, there's
    no Pacific Ocean (what a strange name J). It's a temperate climate, and
    sometimes "temperate" is fine. As you saw it, I like precise and simple
    plan, without any ambiguity. Maybe it's quite weak in email game. But in FTF
    it proves its "worthiness", as Toby saidJ.
    So, can you suggest a precise plan. Then, we'll be able to discuss. Now, and
    more than ever, I think we've to hurry to block England. Of course, I
    already think about something, but this time I'd rather prefer to let you
    suggest something.

    Hello Roland, my last message was
    " I suppose you want me to move in TyS. I can say that I'll not move in
    Naples and wait to see what happened of your fleet in Con. Then I'll see. Do
    you agree? If not, please tell me more about your plan. "
    So, I guess it was clear that I shall not move away from Rome. What for ? I
    don't want to threat France, and it's still early to block vs an eventual
    England's win. But some time, I'll probably have to, so I prefer not move it
    back towards Austria. Moreover, as I had no news from you and Austria for a
    long time, and as Chris seems to be very tricky, I was waiting to see what
    happened of the Con fleet. That's why I ask you for a more precise plan.
    Sorry for the misfit. Now, I can just propose to cut the support of Tuscany.
    But all will depend on Germany's attitude. He doesn't need Munich at all,
    and a big Austria will sooner or later be a problem for him. So…

    &gt; Christian:
    &gt;      Well, my move to Bre failed but so did the French move to Paris!
    &gt; Sometimes one has to count his blessings....
    &gt;      This Fall, I would like to support Italian A Pie-Mar with my A
    &gt; Bur.  If your
    &gt; F Eng can support me, I can order A Pic-Bre also supported by Paris.
    &gt; France can guess correctly and stop one of these moves, but he cannot
    &gt; prevent the loss of either Bre or Mar!
    &gt;      You can annihilate Russia's F Ska this turn, but he will possibly
    &gt; be able to
    &gt; rebuild it in War or StP.  Perhaps it would be better to keep Ska alive,

    &gt; where it is?

    &gt;      I have indeed been talking to Italy, and I have offered to help him to stay

    &gt; (best that I can).  I cannot stop Austria from taking Rome, however.
    &gt;      Perhaps you should offer to support Russia's A Rum-Bud with your A Gal.  It
    &gt;
    &gt; would take Austria by surprise; Russia just might go for it.
    &gt;      You should keep Sev, while Russia bounces over Warsaw (that is my guess,

     well, think of your growth potential sitting right there. You are well
     positioned to leverage yourself into BEL, HOL, and DEN--there is virtually
     no German ability to stop it *plus* if he suspects a stab he walks a fine
     line: what if he acts to prevent a stab but you don't stab? Then HE looks
     like the stabber since he will have all his forces facing you whle you look
     peaceful. Furthermore, Germany's precarious position only lasts until he
     gets another build. Once he builds a fleet (or even an army) in Kiel, then
     he can much more easily deflect any stab. I think the key time for it is
     when you've gotten a build (like you just did) and he has not. If you don't
     stab this fall, then Germany is likely to get either Marseilles or Brest.
     Finally, what can you hope to pick up from France? First you have to get
     Brest, something you cannot do alone, you have to depend on Germany for the
     help. Then you have to hope that France disbands something useful to you
    (ie
     he kills a fleet) otherwise you must spend two season getting a third fleet
     bordering MAO. Then you ahve to dislodge him from the knotty Spain-Portugal
     area. All during this time, presumably, Germany has comfortably digested
     Paris and Marseilles and is working against the Russia with no competition.
    
     I think the key has got to be "how will the East eveolve?" Austria is
     growing fast (you may recall that I tried to stall Austria somewhat the
     season before this by denying him Venice during that fall move). You need
     someone like France who can project forces into the Med very fast to at
     least even out the power struggle there while you can expand to the north.
     The other advantage to striking Germany now is that half of your work (the
     attack on Paris and eventual attack on Munich and Belgium, would get borne
     by French forces while you concentrate on the Holland-Kiel-Denmark line.
     That still leaves you with2-3 units with which to attack St Pete. The end
     result should be for you to increase +3 within 4 seasons, as opposed to +1
     when attacking France.
    
     that's by best argument!  :)

    Hello Paul,
    I'm not worry about Rome, but just think that Italy can take back Venice, if
    you cut the support in Tyrolia, and me the one in Tuscany.

    Cyrille,
    
    Sorry about not getting back to you -- life has been very busy here.  No
    excuse, I know, but a hurricane, even a small one, can mix things up quite a
    bit -- I also had someone visit this weekend, and that took up a lot of time
    I had intended to use for Dip.
    
    Anyway.  It's too latee now to suggest something -- I will look at the
    results of this turn, and come up with a plan for hte SPring.  I won't take
    any action against you, though -- and If you want, I'll support you into
    Rumania.  I am also going to move F Greece -&gt; Bulgaria, to try and dislodge
    that Italian Fleet -- I don't want to keep the SC, just deny it to Italy!
    
    More after results, and apologies again for the lateness of my reply,
