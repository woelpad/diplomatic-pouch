    Paul,
    
    Sorry if disbanding Spain upset you, but this is the fatest way to move
    foward into the Med. My fleet in spain was on the north coast and couldn't
    continue into the Med . Now I can move Por-Spa(sc) and MAO-Wes.
    
    As for the northern board, you said I could have StP and I interpreted it
    as OK that I gave it to Russia. He promised me to use all builds against
    Austria so I hope that is OK too.
    
    Now, now. What to do now? Let´s move on! I think Chris has figured he
    cannot hold Holland wich means he will move A Hol-Kie supported by A
    Berlin. That means we can do this:
    Germany:
    F Nth-Hel
    A Lon-Bel
    F Bel-Hol
    F Den does NOT try to bounce Chris in Kiel.
    
    England:
    F Eng C A Lon-Bel
    and the moving into Med as suggested above. What do you say?
    
    A position in Hel, Hol, Den combined with A Ruh (A Bur-Ruh) means you
    re-take Holland and can throw him out of Kiel. Furthermore I may possibly
    get a chance at Tunis depending on how Chris moves.
    
    I hope we can continue to agree. Please let me hear your thoughts!
    
    By the way, Chris has been sending a mail to me and Cal asking us whether
    we want to eliminate you and Turkey and have a three-way DIAS. Cal answered
    that he´d like to see you eliminated but not Turkey, as he sees Turkey as
    his "insurance". I hope you understand that the reason for saying this to
    you is because I intend to stick on your side. If Russia moves for you I
    will definately capture StP from him this year (by the way; I might be
    doing so anyway in the fall if I see springmoves in accordance with what I
    wrote above).
    
    all the best
    /Christian

    Chris,
    
    I suggest a bounce in WMS. I really don't wanna get in there but I guess
    you don't trust me. Besides, being in MAO this fall can turn out very
    interesting for me. I will definately move in directions suggested by your
    common letter to me and Cal.
    
    all the best

    Christian,
    
    What on earth makes you think I dont trust you?
    
    heheheheheh.  whoo, had to laugh for a moment there.  Because, for a moment,
    I was serious!
    
    Really, I can see that you have a LOT of cleanup to do in the North.  I
    could use some help with the German home SC's, like F North SEa not being
    able to support action against Holland, Dnmark not being able to move to the
    Baltic, that sort of thing.
    
    I was planning on sending that fleet to the Ionain -- Lets not bounce in the
    Westmed, shall we?  Please?  I think we both have bigger fish to fry!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Gents,
    
    It seems to me that the death of Germany is going to be directly related to
    how hard Cal presses me, or helps Turkey.  For now, I am content to put the
    Genie in the Bottle, and simply be the stopper until you decide we don't
    need no more Genies, Cal.
    
    But unless I can send the bulk of my force that way, including some naval
    power to harass Marsailles, it's going to take forever.
    
    It would appear that our common cause is Germany, then.  Cal, could we agree
    to DMZ Galicia and Ukraine?  Galicia for you, Ukraine for me?  If niether of
    us is staging anything there, we can both breath a little easier.  I will
    Vacate Silesia as soon as possible, but that might be a year from now, I am
    not sure.
    
    I would also like to co-operate on the annhialation of the German unit in
    Livonia.  Perhaps Silesia and Warsaw could bounce in Prussia while StPete is
    supported in by Moscow?
    
    In the north, I will try to take and hold Kiel, and then support you into
    Denmark, Christian.
    
    Does this sound like a plan?
    
    Chris

    to

    the
    &gt; Genie in the Bottle, and simply be the stopper until you decide we don't
    &gt; need no more Genies, Cal.
    
    That will take another couple of centres and my expansion opportunities are
    rather limited right now.  I'm definitely going to have to settle for
    consolidation for the moment.  More below.
    
    &gt; It would appear that our common cause is Germany, then.  Cal, could we
    agree
    &gt; to DMZ Galicia and Ukraine?  Galicia for you, Ukraine for me?  If niether
    of

    &gt; Vacate Silesia as soon as possible, but that might be a year from now, I
    am
    &gt; not sure.
    
    As this will definitely help me consolidate my position, I'm for it.
    
    &gt; I would also like to co-operate on the annhialation of the German unit in
    &gt; Livonia.  Perhaps Silesia and Warsaw could bounce in Prussia while StPete
    is
    &gt; supported in by Moscow?
    
    Okay, what I would like to do is get that unit off my soil as well.  Combine
    that with above DMZ (Christian, I'd like to DMZ the St Pete's area sometime
    soon if it sounds feasible to you) and I get a little breathing space.
    Obviously, I'm trying to keep my options open.  I won't lie about that.
    Heck, it's been quite a while since I've even HAD options!  I also won't lie
    about the fact that I may have to attack you (Austria) again if circumstance
    dictate.  But for now (read "now" as at least this coming year), I'm willing
    to help in Germany's downfall and I'll re-evaluate the board situation at
    that time.
    
    Does that sound fair to you?  It's probably the best I can do with my
    position.
    
    &gt; In the north, I will try to take and hold Kiel, and then support you into
    &gt; Denmark, Christian.
    &gt;
    &gt; Does this sound like a plan?
    
    Works for me.

    Chris, great to hear from u.  Wow, I am in a pickle now.  My question to u
    is, what advantage is there to Austria to lay off Turkey, me being on the

    Cal,
    
    I understand perfectly that you are in a tight spot -- I mostly put you
    there!  I would like to end this game on a, oh, I-dunno, 14/11/9 split, with
    you in Russia/Turkey/Rum bul, Me in Aus/Italy/Germany/Gre/Ser/Tun/Hol/Par,
    and Christian in the rest, though I'd want to be DARN sure I had the med
    sealed up if Christian was at 11!  So that is the goal I am working towards
    at this point.  I have most of what I need.
    
     If we spend this year consolidating our positions, then next year we can
    see if our end-game visions match up.  I am curious, does that sound like a
    workable end-game scenario to you?

    Almost.  I see only one real sticking point from my end, but it's
    potentially a big'n.
    
    Simply put, I need a couple more centres so I'm not quite so at the mercy of
    anyone with a unit in the area. Until then, I can't aford to trust anyone
    other than Turkey (who needs me as much as I need him).
    
    If we can figure out a way that I can get another couple of centres, I'll go
    for your draw proposal.  Any ideas?  And no, I'm not prepared to stab the
    Turk until it's safe for me to do so. I'm defining 'safe' here as you not
    being able to turn around and take them from me right away.
    
    I certainly agree that you have to have the entrance to the Med plugged
    because England stands to become a big threat otherwise.
    
    Meanwhile, let's get that German unit popped and we'll take it from there,
    okay?

    &gt; Cal, fyi

    That's pretty much what he's saying to me too.  I think he realizes that he
    stabbed Germany too soon.  You and I still have the power to keep enough of
    his units tied up that he will have a rough go of it in the north.  And if
    England decides to push through the Med, he's in serious trouble.
    Fortunately for all of us, Germany still has fleets that England has to be
    worried about
    
    Anyway, closer to home, Austria is talking about DMZing Gal/Ukr.  I'm going
    to try to make him think I like the idea and, if I get REALLY, REALLY lucky,
    I may take a shot at Bud in the Fall.  Let me know if you hear anything that
    might affect that, k?

    Mikal,
    
    Yes, you ask the really hard questions, dont you?   I'd like to be cryptic,
    and say, "I have my reasons", but I actually do have fairly good reasons --
    the same one's I've been giving you all along.
    
    I am now looking for a good three-way draw.  The Best 3 way on the table is
    E/A/T.  EAR isn't bad, but Russia always has to worrry that I have
    sufficient force to take him out.  This isn't a concern with Turkey -- at 6
    centers, you are just about invulnerable, if those units are in the right
    place.
    
    Russia is going to stand by you -- I don't doubt it for a minute.  The
    question is whether I can dig you out by my lonesome or not, and while I
    think I maybe could, now that I have some fleets in the area, I'd rather be
    back in the atlantic.  Can you imagine how frustrating it was, as Austria,
    to have a fleet in the MAO, and have to retreat because it looked like
    Turkey was going to shoot up to 5?  grrrr.
    
    Ok.  Are you willing to discuss TERMS.  I don't want any of the confusion
    that occoured when Italy and I hit this crossroads.  I want you in the game,
    I want you to develop as a nation, but as the guy with the big stick, I have
    some things I want to have happen.
    
    I don't like to give ultimatums, its bad diplomacy.  If we can agree on the
    situation, I can then put forth what I would like to see happen for us to
    work together.  Everything is negotiable, of course, but some bits are less
    negotiable than others.  ;)
    
    It will involve trusting me some.  Not alot, I know how that bank account
    is -- tapped.  But if its that or War, I would rather negotiate.

    Cal,
    
    I was thinking about that very thing -- well, if Cal holds the Turkish
    centers, what's to keep me from taking them and going for the solo?
    
    Toughie -- I control the southern seas, which makes it that much harder.
    
    I imagine a scenario where my fleets are tied up in Naf/Westmed/Gulf of Lyon
    positions being the answer.  I only have the four, and if they are all being
    used at the other end of the Med, you should be fairly secure.  However, I
    can't send those units away until turkey is down.  Is this a catch 22?
    
    I hope not.  I guess the first center we could easily get you would be
    Bulgaria -- after that, Berlin?
    
    This is a tough thing for me -- I want to build you up, but not soas you
    become a threat to me.  Have you had this sort of situation arise before?
    Its a new one for me.

    &gt;
    &gt; Cal, any thoughts on what OUR story should be with Austria?  If we
    &gt; coordinate our stories, we may fair better.
    
    There's probably not much we can tell him he'll believe.  For example, the
    only thing you could say to him that would be remotely believable would be
    that you want to attack me.  The only other alternative you have is to say
    that you want to help defend the Med against England and that's just not
    gonna fly as a story.  As for atacking me, he's not likely to trust that
    idea either.  He's getting very paranoid (and for good reason!).
    
    Anyway, since there's not much point in lying, let's just stick to the story
    that all we want is to defend our borders, grow a little and see what
    happens.  That's all I've told him anyway..  I'm certainly open to
    suggestion.

    Chris, if I could just get outta this hole I am in, then I may be able to
    feel a little more comfortable.  What are the chances of u backing out of
    Bul and Gre, letting me have them?  I would feel a lot better about our
    relationship then.
    
    Thoughts?
    
    Mikal,
    
    Yes, you ask the really hard questions, dont you?   I'd like to be cryptic,
    and say, "I have my reasons", but I actually do have fairly good reasons --
    the same one's I've been giving you all along.
    
    I am now looking for a good three-way draw.  The Best 3 way on the table is
    E/A/T.  EAR isn't bad, but Russia always has to worrry that I have
    sufficient force to take him out.  This isn't a concern with Turkey -- at 6
    centers, you are just about invulnerable, if those units are in the right
    place.
    
    Russia is going to stand by you -- I don't doubt it for a minute.  The
    question is whether I can dig you out by my lonesome or not, and while I
    think I maybe could, now that I have some fleets in the area, I'd rather be
    back in the atlantic.  Can you imagine how frustrating it was, as Austria,
    to have a fleet in the MAO, and have to retreat because it looked like
    Turkey was going to shoot up to 5?  grrrr.
    
    Ok.  Are you willing to discuss TERMS.  I don't want any of the confusion
    that occoured when Italy and I hit this crossroads.  I want you in the game,
    I want you to develop as a nation, but as the guy with the big stick, I have
    some things I want to have happen.
    
    I don't like to give ultimatums, its bad diplomacy.  If we can agree on the
    situation, I can then put forth what I would like to see happen for us to
    work together.  Everything is negotiable, of course, but some bits are less
    negotiable than others.  ;)
    
    It will involve trusting me some.  Not alot, I know how that bank account
    is -- tapped.  But if its that or War, I would rather negotiate.
    
    Best,
    
    chris

    &lt;&lt;stuff representing Chris' dilemma snipped&gt;&gt;
    
    &gt; This is a tough thing for me -- I want to build you up, but not so as you
    &gt; become a threat to me.  Have you had this sort of situation arise before?
    &gt; Its a new one for me.
    
    Yeah, it's the same position I put Jamie Dreier in in the last demo game,
    although the centres he realized I had to get weren't so inconveniently
    placed. Didn't have Turkey as a wild card either.
    
    Quite frankly, I think the only thing that can be done for now is wait and
    see what breaks. You're gonna have to crumble at some point and,
    unfortunately, it looks as if the Med may be where it happens.  Too bad you
    didn't let Germany back into Munich.  It would have freed up that fleet in
    Trieste or defense duties.

    Chris:
     Did you get what you wanted out of your German stab?  You
    slowed/stopped
    my invasion of England, but it has given Christian time to follow your
    retreating
    fleets towards the Med.  Iberia is a distant dream for you now.
     Russia, which was on the ropes only a gameyear ago, has now been
    building
    armies.  Against whom will they be used?  (Even if he employs them vs.
    Germany,
    he has to go through you to get there!)
     I must ask:  what did Turkey have in mind when he tried a supported
    attack on
    Bul and would have left Con wide open for your retreat?
     What did England have in mind when he supported Russia to StP
    instead of taking it himself (as we had agreed).  People surely are
    getting generous around here.
     Should you wish a rapproachment, the deal may as well be proposed
    by you.  My terms would surely be too harsh to be considered seriously!

    This turn, I'll be doing little other than solidifying my position.  After

    He didn't.  Check the moves again, he moved F Smy-Con.
    
    Note:  If England makes it around Spain into the Med, make sure you hang
    onto a couple of your northern fleets as we'll need them to stop an English
    victory.

    Paul,
    
    Did I get what I wanted?  Hmmm.  Yes and no?  It all really depends on
    whether Christian actually DOES follow my retreating fleets towards the med,
    or if he sends them North to defend against you -- we shall see how he plays
    that one.
    
    Your points, though, are all good ones.  I felt I HAD to take some steps to
    blunt your momentum, though, or risk chasing you from behind.  The cost of
    that was any immediate hope of a solo that I had.
    
    &lt;&lt;must ask:  what did Turkey have in mind when he tried a supported
    attack on
    Bul and would have left Con wide open for your retreat?&gt;&gt;
    
    I think he moved Smy -&gt; Con, didn't he?  That's what my map shows . . .
    Yup, he did.
    
     &lt;&lt;    What did England have in mind when he supported Russia to StP
    instead of taking it himself (as we had agreed).  &gt;&gt;
    
    Now THAT was either very clever, or Very Stupid.  It gives me some worries,
    right?  That;s the only think I can think of, he thought I would need an
    opposing force to balance me.
    
    &lt;&lt;Should you wish a rapproachment, the deal may as well be proposed
    by you.  My terms would surely be too harsh to be considered seriously!&gt;&gt;
    
    Hmm.  I think I might be able to envision those terms.   Unfortunately, I
    cant think of a good way for us to disengage at this time.    If you have
    any Ideas on those lines, I am willing to listen -- I would think that
    Tyrolia -&gt; Munich would be a starting place we could agree on, at the very

    I was! What did I have to lose, since you could always take me out in Tunis?
    I didn't even argue for survival as part of a draw but rather that I'd like
    to survive if you could find 19 just to bother the German. Man, at that
    point you were odds-on to be able to hold past the stalemate line--now
    you've got a resurgent Russia and still have not solved your Turkish problem
    and you can't afford to get that additional fleet out of Trieste for one or
    several turns yet. I'm starting to think more and more that this will turn
    into a 3way (A/R/E?)
    
    Once again, we see our own traditional patterns that we've talked about
    before: I stab too late, and you stab too soon. :) What I continually don't
    understand is why you underestimate people's intentions. Even Freud said,
    "sometimes a cigar is just a cigar". Sometimes a 1-SC power, esp of someone
    you know personally, does get a kick out of helping to play kingmaker. What
    I see is that you've substituted F WES (French) for F TRI (Austrian), and
    ugh, that cant possibly be more useful.

    I have a sneaking suspicion that Austria will concede you Bulgaria and

    the above move so you can get it back.  Lookin at the board though, wouldn't
    a move of F Aeg-Gre and F Con-Bul(sc), s by F Bla be better?  Might even pop

    We need to talk about what is going on in the north this season.  Are you
    going to be re-taking the North Sea?  Do you need me to hit Belgium to cut
    support?
    
    Paul thinks you are going to come crashing into the Med -- I don't doubt
    that is why you asked for the bounce in Westmed -- if you need me to do it
    for dramatic purposes in the spring, that's fine, but if you apply your
    resources, you can re-take the north sea and london this year, as well as
    Brest -- depending on how Paul defends, we might not get Denmark, but its
    bound to fall sooner or later.
    
    Please drop me a line so we can plan this out.

    Mikal,
    
    Well, there is ONE little thing you should keep in mind when considering the
    Italian and the French cases -- and that is in BOTH instances I asked them
    for help, and they turned around and bit me.  Then and ONLY then did I crush
    them (and, for the record, Turkey owned a couple of Italian centers at one
    point, it wasn't all me, and I certainly cant take the blame for France!)
    
    In fact, France still sends me messages like :Wow, good trade, a friendly
    fleet in the Westmed for a fleet in Trieste!  grrrrr.  ;)
    
    In short, the answer is NO.  I am looking to secure a 3-way draw here.  If
    you won't play ball, Russia will, eventually.  I now have the fleets to keep
    you bottled up, at four centers tops, and I can contend that pretty readily.
    Of course, England could come into the Med and distract me, which would
    change everything, or something else that I don't see coming could happen,
    but as the board stands, I only have one reason to work with you -- to
    eliminate Russia from the draw.
    
    Look, I am not asking you to commit suicide.  I am willing to support YOU
    into these centers.  Look at our personal history -- WE had a plan, by which
    you would have gotten Rumania and Sev, and you trashed it for Bulgaria.  I
    played you straight, and you turned on me.  I don't really know why I should
    give you a chance to betray me again, now that I think about it!  But that's
    dip -- you and I know that we have to watch the other person, and make sure
    that any betrayal isn't going to be too costly.
    
    I need an ally more than I need centers.  You clearly don't trust me to do
    anything I would say, just under General Principal, it seems to me.  Well,
    if you won't trust me to do something in my own best interests, ie secure an
    ally who could then work with me further, then I guess you wont trust me
    when the chips are down, either.
    
    Good luck,
    
    Chris

    Chris,
    
    I would actually like to bounce in WES for dramatic reasons. If it´s ok
    with you. Also, I will not attack NTH this season cause I am planning to
    sneak into LON & Brest in the fall. I need it to look like I am attacking
    you and playing with Paul to help him defend. See?
    
    I guess the best thing you can do is to attack Kiel with support and move
    to be able to either hold Kiel or take MUN in the fall.
    
    Paul asked me to use my F ENG to convoy A Lon-Bel. Playing England and
    Germany asks you to help him convoy away from your tiny island. Hard to not
    do that. I will convoy him away, the worst that might happen is that he
    takes EDI but that he could have done whatever I guessed. I just hope he
    moves to open himself for a stab.

    &gt; &gt; Paul,
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Ok, we have a starting point.
    &gt;
    &gt; I take it that you won't try to oppose/bounce A Tyr-Mun?
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;  Do you have a proposal for Holland?  I can
    &gt; &gt; only think of one place on the board it could go that would benefit both of
    &gt; &gt; us, and its so ridiculous that I can't even mention it.
    &gt;
    &gt; Hmm.  Might you consider your A Hol being convoyed via Nth to Yrk or Edi?
    &gt; Wouldn't that be a mean thing to do to Christian?
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; And Livonia.  What of that?
    &gt;
    &gt; What of it?  It could be supported to Warsaw....  Cal's plan is to drive me out
    &gt; of
    &gt; Lvn with a supported move, and he wants me to retreat it otb.  Now a supported
    &gt; move to War MIGHT catch him unawares....
    &gt;

    Paul,
    
    Great minds . . .
    
    No I won't oppose a move to Munich.  I was thinking that a convoy to
    Yorkshire or Edi would just RUIN Chirstian's day, but c'mon, and Austrian
    Army in Edi?  God, I hae to confess, I am the kind of player who would do
    this just so I could say that I have done it, in a serious game as a
    serious, valid move.  Let me think on that, but I think it might be an
    answer . . .
    
    The problem, of course, being that if you double cross me (and hey, I think
    we have to look at this thing from all sides at this point, right?)  you
    could annhialate that army.  My safe move is to support it to Kiel, but that
    is at best a holding measure, as it puts me right in your clutches.  hmmm.
    Would YOU do it, that is my question.
    
    I would happily support Livonia to Warsaw, as it helps me deal with a number
    of issues.  He ends up retreating to Prussia, but that shouldn't help him
    any.
    
    I think we have the pieces of a deal here.  At the heart of it is the
    somewhat improbably convoy of Holland -&gt; Edi.  It ties us together, giving
    you a hostage, essentially, because when england goes down, you can take
    that center when and how you want to, but it does clear me out of your field
    of opperations.  The same can be said of Warsaw, I suppose.
    
    What are your thoughts on the two-year ramifications of such a deal?
    
    best,

    Yeah, and look at it from the other (my) point of view:  I could be leaving
    myself
    open to A Hol-s-A Ber-Kie....
     Yes, the plan has its obvious dangers to each of us.  But nothing ventured,
    nothing gained right?  I'll do the convoy to Edi if you want it!

    Hey, I'm one of the FEW players left in this game who hasn't had a hold on War
    at some time or another.  It's my turn!  The question is, can I hold onto it in
    the Fall?
    He'll be in Lvn, Mos and Ukr plus he'll be as mad as a hornet.  Can you spare
    two

    My A War would be every bit as vulnerable to you (or Russia) as your A Edi would
    be to me.  Plus Lpl is just a retreat away from Edi, isn't it?
     You could still be quite as near to Iberia as I will be.  In fact, you
    could
    have Iberia while I'd concentrate on Scandinavia.
     While there we still E's, R's, and T's around, we'd have to stick together;
    they
    won't be quite as forgiving/forebearing as they've been in times past.
     I've "settled" for two-way draws before--twice that I can think of just out
    of hand.  They're somewhat harder to come by than are solo wins, because it
    takes
    that rare element of trust and (ahem) honesty.

    Paul,
    
    OK.  You have yourself a deal.  I may pay the price, but I think the risk is
    worth the candle.  ( I don't know exactly what that means, but it sounds
    appropriate . . .)
    
    Yes, I can support Warsaw to hold in the fall -- and on another thought, if
    you want, I could shift Edi -&gt; Liverpool in the fall, and you could take
    Edi.
    
    Yes, I think this would leave everyone else hopping mad, no question.  May I
    ask that Marsailles not move to Piedmont -- or should we agree to bounce
    there, to keep you from worrying about Tyre-some developments?
    
    I haven't yet participated in a two way draw.  I am, however, game if you
    are.  Clearly any hope for a solo for me is shot at this point.

    Cool.  They (E/R) will NEVER see this coming!  The deal I made with Christian
    was that his F Eng would convoy A Lon-Bel, and he would leave F Nth alone so
    that it could support F Bel-Hol.  Unless he happens to move F Nwy-Nwg (unlikely,
    
    with my having that F Nth, F Den) he'll be wide open for the kill (well, I'd
    better
    move A Bur-Pic to cover Bre or Bel).
     If I burn you in Hol, you waste me in War.

    Cal,
    
    We had a successful season last.  Austria has thinned his line against us
    dramatically and can be exploited.
    
    This is what I think Austria will do to try and defend against t/r:
    
    a gre - ser (self bounce)
    a bud - ser (self bounce)
    f ion - aeg (cut support against gre)
    
    I recommend the following moves:
    
    f aeg - gre
    f bul(sc) s aeg - gre
    f bla s bul(sc)

    mean to be offensive or brash.
    
    However, my attitude has not changed in that I am still fearful of the big
    Austria stick.  U carry one whale of a punch.  Thoughts on allowing me

    unified and pouring on the pressure, we will both prosper in the game.  I
    think Germany and Austria have both goofed in that they stabbed foolishly.
    My on-going conversations with him will keep a carrot in front of him.

    &gt; a gre - ser (self bounce)

    &gt; f aeg - gre
    &gt; f bul(sc) s aeg - gre
    &gt; f bla s bul(sc)
    &gt;
    &gt; Thoughts?
    
    Yep.  How about you get that fleet out of Black and into Con where it can be
    pushed into the Med?  It doesn't need to support Bul and with Austria's
    "thinning" (I like that phrase!) of the lines, we can afford to pull back a
    bit and start thinking strategically.  I think we can look at you breaking
    out and surrounding the Austrian flank.  That should give us both
    opportunity to grow.
    
    I do want to point out that we have to be careful about weakening Austria
    TOO much, as we may eventually need him against England.  For now, let's go
    after him strong but don't forget the big picture, okay?

    Good question.  I think I'm gonna chase that German army until I eventually
    pop the damned thing, just for the sheer cussedness of it all.  Other than
    that, I cover my butt until opportunity presents itself to gain some

    Well, I wish we hadn't bounced in the Westmed, 'cause I could be in the GOL
    now and we could take Marsailles -- but who knew?
    
    I bet you're glad I didn't accept that convoy to edi, as well!  An austrian
    army in Edi, I had a hard time resisting that!
    
    Anyway, if you will go to Marsailles from Spain, we can annhialate that army
    in Piedmont -- I'll cover Tuscany from Tyhrn, and support an attack in --
    I'll also take Kiel, sorry for not being in Kiel now, but I thought I'd end
    up there after getting dislodged from Belgium.
    
    Thoughts?
    
    Chris

    &gt; Cal, to keep u informed.  Please know I am not gonna backstab u.  As we
    keep
    &gt; unified and pouring on the pressure, we will both prosper in the game.  I
    &gt; think Germany and Austria have both goofed in that they stabbed foolishly.
    &gt; My on-going conversations with him will keep a carrot in front of him.
    
    I agree that you should keep him hanging for as long as he'll chase the
    carrot.  Lord knows, nobody else is talking to him (well, except his cell
    mate, Germany) so he will likely WANT to believe you.
    
    As for our alliance, I am solidly behind it.  This game has been one
    senseless stab after another and I'm tired of it.  I'm going to stick with
    you until the game ends as I think that's the only way we're going to
    prosper.
    
    Thanks for the note,
    
    Cal

    Cal,
    
    Actually, where I come from, DMZ's mean De-militarized Zones, and no armies
    go there.  I somehow doubt you misunderstood this.  Still and all, I have
    kinda passed up the opportunity to contest that, haven't I?
    
    As for Paul, I have to say that the Idea was a good one -- I could have
    supported him into Warsaw, bounced you in Ukraine, and had an army in Edi --
    I would have enjoyed that, but I really didn't see it as a long-term winner.
    
    I came this close to doing it though -- but I thought, classic prisoners
    dilema -- if I go through, and he doesn't, I look like an idiot --- it'd be
    cool if I did do it, but really, not quite cool enough to take the chance.
    Germany is now a corpse, with just a little twitching left in it.
    
    I think we really need to start thinking 3 way here, and that means getting
    Turkey out of the picture.  Right?  Talk to me, here, let me know what you
    think!
    
    Chris

    Greece, hmm.  Well, actually, I am thinking about it.  Would it really be
    good for our relationship, though?  That's my question.  I mean, you'd have
    to be tempted to build a couple of fleets and come screaming out into the
    Med, right?
    
    Why don't we go slow -- IF you build an army, or IF you take Rumania this
    fall, then I will cede Greece to you Next year.  I just need to make sure
    that R/T aren't coming after me tooth and nail before I give up a key
    province like Greece -- you do see that, right?
    
    Anyway, let me know if you want that supported attack on Rum -- a sneak
    attack on Sev would probably work better.  I am hoping that you and I can
    get back on track working against Russia again.
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Your plan about disbanding A Pie seems allright. Paul is and will always be
    your puppet so there is no need whatsoever to try to work with him.
    
    Enjoy your solo! :(

    Paul, Paul, Paul...
    I am actually getting quite tired of trying to work with you. But, I will
    make a last attempt. This coming fall can result in no supplycenter gain
    for you on my loss. I can cover Edi and you cannot reach Lpl. Also I cannot
    gain anything from you. Please let this make sense and start work with and
    not Austria! I am assuming you want to convoy your army over to the
    mainland. Ok, I will continue to pressure my way into the Med IF I can
    trust you. There is really no need for me fighting Austria while you are
    getting slain by him while attacking me. See my point?
    
    Please tell me if your honest intentions in this game is to give the
    victory away to Chris, cause if that is the case I could as well signoff
    from the game. Your trust in him is starting to seem a little bit
    redicolous. BUT, as I said, there is still time to make me change that
    view. Show me some goodwill and some real intentions to work with me and
    I'll start looking at you with respect again.
    
    Sorry if my message seems harsch, but I was a bit upset when I saw the
    adjudication. I will probably have calmed down tomorrow and say a lot nicer
    things...:)

    Christian,
    
    What?!?
    
    &lt;&lt;Enjoy your solo! :( &gt;&gt;
    
    WHAT?!?
    
    Seriously, here, do you really see 18 centers for me?  I can't get back into
    the MAO, and I can't crack R/T.  I may get as far as 14 or 15, all of
    Germany, and Paris, but to get to 18 I need some Turkish centers or some
    Russian centers or some of Iberia, and I just cant see that happening.
    
    Not that I wouldn't try, but if you take Brest this year, and I take Munich
    and Kiel, then Germany is out -- you'll get London and Denmark, and Belgium,
    I should think.  That leaves me with
    
    Home(3) + serbia/greece (5) +Italy/tunis (9) Germany (12) + Holland/Paris
    (14).  Where are my other 4 centers?  Especially if you don't attack Cal in
    the north, I can't get 18, I dont think.
    
    Do you really think eliminating Paul will give me a solo?  I just don't see
    it.  I am NOT trying to be clever or deceptive here.  When I pulled out of
    the MAO I gave up any chance (IMO) of a solo.
    
    I really want to know what you think about this -- I am trying to engineer a
    three way draw.
    
    Chris

    &gt; &gt; Paul, Paul, Paul...
    &gt; &gt; I am actually getting quite tired of trying to work with you. But, I will
    &gt; &gt; make a last attempt. This coming fall can result in no supplycenter gain
    &gt; &gt; for you on my loss. I can cover Edi and you cannot reach Lpl. Also I cannot
    &gt; &gt; gain anything from you. Please let this make sense and start work with and
    &gt; &gt; not Austria! I am assuming you want to convoy your army over to the

    &gt; &gt; trust you. There is really no need for me fighting Austria while you are
    &gt; &gt; getting slain by him while attacking me. See my point?
    &gt;
    &gt; If I thought you were serious about cracking into the Med, last season need not
    &gt; have
    &gt; happened.  I warned you that a move to the Med would just be a bounce, and I
    &gt; advised you to go with F Mao-Naf so that it could support F Spa sc-Wes in the
    &gt; following season.  You declined to even discuss this.
    &gt;      By removing your F Spa nc last winter, instead of A Fin, you cheated
    &gt; yourself
    &gt; of a chance to move F Spa nc-Mao, following up on Mao-Naf.  You would have had
    &gt; a much stronger position in the south vs. Austria.
    &gt;      Instead, you settled for Fortress Scandinavia even after I had removed F
    &gt; Bal.
    &gt; I never believed that you had any intention of returning to StP; you needed Cal
    &gt; on
    &gt; your side vs. Austria too badly.
    &gt;      So I thought about it.  What if I could talk Chris into a convoy to Edi in
    &gt; the
    &gt; Spring?  He might have moved it to Lpl in the Fall, giving me a shot at Edi (if
    &gt; you
    &gt; wouldn't have moved to Nwg).  The other part of the deal was that Chris would
    &gt; support me to War, helping to break Russia.
    &gt;      I mean't have been in on a winning partnership instead of a collection of
    &gt; small
    &gt; fry fighting the big guy.  That was my frame of mind last season.
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Please tell me if your honest intentions in this game is to give the
    &gt; &gt; victory away to Chris, cause if that is the case I could as well signoff
    &gt; &gt; from the game.
    &gt;
    &gt; I have never intentionally "thrown" a game to anyone, and I don't want to start
    &gt; here.
    &gt; What angered me was Cal talking in those terms, and no one seemed to blink an
    &gt; eye....
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Your trust in him is starting to seem a little bit
    &gt; &gt; redicolous. BUT, as I said, there is still time to make me change that
    &gt; &gt; view. Show me some goodwill and some real intentions to work with me and
    &gt; &gt; I'll start looking at you with respect again.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Okay, I gave G/A one more shot in the vain hope that I could be in a stronger
    &gt; &gt; overall position.  It was my only hope in that regard, and now my delusions
    &gt; &gt; of grandeur must be set aside.  A huge dose of humility has been dealt to me,
    &gt; &gt; and now I either work with you or (implicitly) allow Austria to win.
    &gt;
    &gt; So now I must get serious about helping E/R/T vs. A.  I might start out with
    &gt; F Nth-C-A Lon-Hol supported by F Bel.  A Pic could return to Bur.
    &gt;      A Den could try to cover Kie, while A Pru could cut Ber as a support for
    &gt; Austrian Hol-Kie (although I recognize that A Mun can still serve in that
    &gt; capacity).
    &gt;      By convoying A Lon-Hol myself, I free your F Eng to move to Mao.  You can
    &gt; have F Spa sc support F Mao-Wms and finally enter into the Med theatre.
    &gt;      My A Pie can try sneaking into Tus.
    &gt;
    &gt;      Okay?  I harbor no more illusions about Chris (actually they were
    &gt; delusions,
    &gt; since the A/G plans were mine in their inception).
    &gt;
    &gt; Paul
