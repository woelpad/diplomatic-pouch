    &gt;Ooooh, if this lack of attention persists, I will have to INCREASE
    &gt;my prediction on the probability of the English win outcome!!!
    &gt;
    &gt;And no one ;-) wants THAT,
    &gt;Jim-Bob
    
    Well, actually, I do want that. So it is not only this suspicious "no one"
    who wants it :)

    Christian,
    
    Should Munich Support Denmark to kiel, or move to Silesia?
    
    how do you want to handle the Med?  You can get 18 without Tunis, but why
    not push for it too?
    
    Let me know,
    
    Chris

    &gt;Should Munich Support Denmark to kiel, or move to Silesia?
    Supporting Den-Kiel would be good. Then again, moving to Sil would also be
    good. If I move to Kiel I will most surely bounce with Pauls F Hol. That
    way you can keep Kiel one year and have a better chance to push against
    Cal. So maybe moving to Sil is better. If I take Bel+Hol this year you
    don't have to disband against Cal and Meef this turn. Then I can move on
    into Germany next year.
    
    
    &gt;how do you want to handle the Med?  You can get 18 without Tunis, but why
    &gt;not push for it too?
    The med. Well, I suggest we move like this:
    A:
    Pie-Ven
    Lyo-Wes
    Tus-Rom
    
    E:
    Spa S Lyo-Wes
    Mar-Lyo
    Mid-NAf
    
    What do you think Meef wil do?

    Christian,
    
    Sounds good -- I'll move to Silesia.
    
    If I were guessing, I'd guess that He would support Ionian to Tyrh with
    everything.  his tactics aren't all that strong, actually.
    
    Your moves sound good!  Away we go!  Get some Pressure on StPete this year
    and I will be able to hold Cal and Meef completely until you arrive.

    Meef, Cal.
    
    Here is what Chris tells me he want "us" (as in he and me) to do:
    A:
    A Mun-Sil
    A Pru S A Mun-Sil
    A Gal-War
    A Bud S A Ser
    A Ser hold
    F Tus-Trn
    F Lyo-Wes
    A Pie-Ven
    
    To make sure that I then take Tunis he suggests I move:
    F Mar-Lyo
    F Spa(sc) S Lyo-Wes
    F Mid-NAf
    
    He is counting on a bounce in Trn and will then have Tus and Ven against
    Rome while he supports me to Tunis alternatively cut Trn so he can retake
    Rome.
    
    What shall I do? The best for all of us would be if Chris still thinks I am
    his friend in the fall. That way I get to know his moves again. Meef, what
    do you think about having me in NAf? Possible? Or should we bounce there to
    keep Chris thinking I am moving as he wants me to?
    
    Cal, I would be happy if you let Chris into Sil. That way he cannot protect
    Munich. :)

    Without having a map in front of me, I'd say this looks good.  I don't think
    Chris will make much of a move against you in the Balkans.  He'll be more
    likely to throw everything he has against me, so you'll likely be able to to
    shuffle your armies into position.
    
    I'm glad you told Christian that you wanted to bounce in Naf.  We're going
    to have a hard time keeping him in check as it is without surrendering
    position.
    
    I'll get back to you later with my suggested moves. They'll probably be
    designed just to hold Chris off while ERT whittle him down.

    Sorry for taking so long guys, but things have been very hectic for me
    lately.  And with Chris & Paul trying to turn this into "Speed Chess", it
    doesn't make it any easier.
    
    Don't have much to say, just wanted to let you both know I'm still on board
    and will get orders in shortly.
    
    I think bouncing in Naf is a good idea as I like the idea of frustrating
    Chris in his attempt to throw the game.

    Hi guys.  That shows you what happens when I get to busy to respond to mail.
      Sory, Meef, I thought you were supporting Rum from Black. Anyway, it
    should be okay, as we can get Rum back for the Fall and knock Chris down
    even further.
    
    Meef, can you support A Sev-Rum with your Black Sea fleet?  That will get me
    the centre back and let you take Serbia as well (although Chris may choose
    to support it from Bud. If that happens, you get it next turn).
    
    Christian, I assume you are going to take Paul right out this turn?  If so,
    can you move the Ska fleet into Den?  That will give us a level of comfort
    in the north.  You can see that I'm moving far enough away that you needn't
    feel threatened.  BTW, any chance of you popping Chris's Wes fleet?  I'd
    like to see you guys establish a stalemate line in the Med if possible and
    that would help.
    
    Thoughts?
