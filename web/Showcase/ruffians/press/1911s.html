    &gt; Message from christian.dreyer.712@student.lu.se as England to Russia in
    &gt; 'ruffians':
    &gt;
    &gt; Cal,
    &gt; I got this mail from Paul. After his message follows my answer. I rest
    &gt; assured that you don't forward this to Austria! :)
    
    Heh heh, no worry about that!
    
    &gt; Pauls message:
    &gt; &gt;Hi Christian!  Happy New Year!
    &gt; &gt;     As you may have gleaned from the move results, Austria didn't stab
    &gt; &gt;me in the Fall-- he waited until the autumn retreat to give me a jab in
    &gt; &gt;the ribs with his going to
    &gt; &gt;Bel.
    &gt; &gt;     Sigh.  Okay, I was a sucker to stick with Austria, and this is my
    &gt; &gt;payback.  Maybe I can still make up for it now?
    &gt; &gt;     I have submitted a removal of my F Baltic as a show of "good
    &gt; &gt;faith".  My plan is
    &gt; &gt;to support myself to Bel in the Spring, cover Bre with A Gas, and move A
    &gt; &gt;Bur-Gas,
    &gt; &gt;A Mun-Bur, F Den-Kie and F Hel-Hol.  I have promised Cal that I will
    &gt; &gt;move
    &gt; &gt;A StP-Lvn and support him into War in the Fall.
    &gt; &gt;     Most of these moves are designed to reassure you that I am now
    &gt; &gt;serious about
    &gt; &gt;fighting Austria.  My removal of the F Bal alone should be a pretty
    &gt; &gt;serious indication
    &gt; &gt;of my sincerity this time.  I expect to regain Mar and Bel, and to help
    &gt; &gt;you to keep
    &gt; &gt;Iberia.  Munich might be under some pressure if  Austria puts armies in
    &gt; &gt;Ruh, Tyr and
    &gt; &gt;Boh (or some combination of those) but I'll have to deal with this step
    &gt; &gt;by step.
    &gt; &gt;     It's my mess-- I stepped in it!
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;--Paul
    &gt;
    &gt; My answer:
    &gt; Paul,
    &gt;
    &gt; I am building F Lpl. Next turn I assume we will move like this:
    &gt; Germany:
    &gt; F Eng-MAO
    &gt;
    &gt; England:
    &gt; F IRI S (E) F Eng-MAO
    &gt; F Lpl-NAO
    &gt; F Por S Spa(nc)
    &gt; F Spa(nc) S (E) Eng-MAO
    &gt;
    &gt; This means you get into MAO and Chris has to retreat to WES or NAF to be
    &gt; sure to keep us out of Med. But even if he does retreat to one of those
    &gt; we have a chance to get through! Turkey will probably build a F Smy and
    &gt; therefore Chris may want to move Tun to ION. If he has only one unit to
    &gt; cover WES and NAf we are sure to get through by these moves:
    &gt; Germany:
    &gt; F MAO-NAO (yes, attacking my fleet!)
    &gt; England:
    &gt; F NAO-MAO
    &gt; F IRI S NAO-MAO
    &gt; This forces your fleet to retreat. Where to? To the space Chris didn't
    &gt; cover!
    &gt; If Chris covers WES/NAF with two units we can still choose to dislodge
    &gt; your fleet to get a new army in Ber/Kie/Mun. The opportunitys are ours if
    &gt; you capture MAO this coming turn. Keep in touch!
    
    Okay, I guess I may as well trust what Germany says as I really have choice.
    I'll write himand see what he says.
    
    Later,
    
    Cal

    Paul,
    
    Well, I got to look at the board again, and it just seemed to me that a
    fleet built now would get stuck in albania for the forseeable future, and
    that's no good.
    
    Cal's pull of Sev bespeaks his confidence that he and Turkey are working
    together, but I think it's too late for that.  See if you can catch a
    mistake in this, I am doing it off the cuff, and I haven't got a long time
    to think about it:
    
    We go for the Iberian plan as sceduled.  I will not vary from that a jot.
    In the East, I will support you into mocow.  I am sure he will believe you
    are on board with me now, Cal is a tad gullible that way.
    
    Once again, I want to be sure that you are willing to go through with this.
    If you think I am a threat to solo, (and while I would say I am not even if
    I thought I was, I really don't think I am.  ;)  I cant find either the 17th
    or the 18th center in my quick looks at the board)
    
    I have attatched a bitmap of what the board should look like in the fall, if
    we both follow through.  There are some assumptions there, but I think our
    positions are fairly accurate -- I am not sure I'd attack Bulgaria with the
    fleet, but it's an option.  As you can see, your position is CONsiderably
    improved, while mine is commesurately weakened.  It looks to me like a 3
    build year for you -- which I think you might want to avoid, because
    suddenly all the flags will rally against you.  all I'm saying is that you
    might consider convoying belgium to Edi, and leave me either Marsaille or
    Belgium for the time being.
    
    Let me know if the attatchement didn't, otherwise alot of that isn't going
    to make sense! should open as a bitmap file, or maybe a jpeg.
    
    On second thought, I am going to send it to you seperately, I don't want to
    cause the judge any troubles!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Maybe it's just paranoia, but my guess is for Austria to try for Rumania.
    I'm at work so I don't have the board in front of me.  I'll get back to you
    sometime tonight with more thoughts.
    
    I do agree that we have to hunker down and wait for Austria to lose some
    units.  Maybe if Germany IS sincere about helping me get Warsaw, things will
    get better.

     Here it is, 2 am, and I'm up already.  My 99 year old grandmother lives
    with me
    (for lack of anyone else willing to take her in), and she is in bad shape.  She
    just got
    home from a five day hospital visit, sans the new bathrobe and slippers that I
    sent her
    there with (!) and she's been up and to the bathroom countless times tonight.
     Like a new father, I've become a light sleeper.  I hear her every time she
    wakes
    up.
    
     You should get to keep Bel a while longer.  I'm going to convoy A Pic-Lon
    since
    England was so kind as to keep it open.  I will accept your support to Mos, and
    will support your A Mar-Spa, following up with A Bur-Mar as agreed.
     England's plan for the Spring season is to support my F Eng-Mao, while he
    moves F Lpl-Nao.  I think that I prefer taking Lon, for obvious reasons.

    Paul,
    
    I am dissapointed, but alas not shocked, to hear that the new items you sent
    to the hospital with your grandmother didn't come back.  I had heard such
    tales before, but never in such a first hand situation.  That is the sort of
    thing that would make me blindingly angry.
    
    I am humbled by your sense of famlial responsibility.  My Grandmother ( a
    spry 88) just spent the holidays with my parents, and it is as though she
    lives in a different world.  She is a sweet woman, though.  I guess I am
    glad that such a choice is massively unlikely to come my way.  As my grandma
    would say "That's a cross you won't have to bear!"
    
    In the game, I did not realize that England build F Liverpool.  F
    LIVERPOOL!?!  Like I am going to storm the home Islands with a fleet in the
    MAO and a Fleet in Tunis?  What was he thinking?  Well, as he has shown
    before, sometimes he really isn't.
    
    Ok, then.  It seems to me that we can predict the moves of every piece on
    the board with some accuracy.  russia/turkey is on Defense.  I expect to get
    kicked out of the Aegean, which will either give me Rumania or Bulgaria,
    depending on how they defend.  Are you sure you want me to support you into
    Moscow in the spring?  IF I kick Russia out of Rumania, that would mean he
    would be in Sev, Ukr, and Livonia, and he could take it back.  Should we
    wait until the fall on that one?  Up to you. ( I'd appriciate you hitting
    Moscow anyway, to cut support.)
    
    Iberia will self support, while the English fleets on West edge support you
    and cover the NAO. (Silly old england!)  That leaves Scandinavia.  Can you
    model that for me?  Surely he is going to move to the NOrth sea, but will he
    hit Denmark to keep you honest?  and the army in Finland, where is that
    going?
    
    Sorry the map I sent didn't go through.  I use a program, "diplo" to keep
    track of my games and model possible scenarios.  If you have a copy of the
    program, I can send you a result file.  If not, no worries.
    
    Ok -- that leaves Viennat\or/Trieste, Munich, Burgundy, and Belgium
    unnacounted for.  Would you like these units to bounce, say in Tyrolia and
    the Ruhr?  As long as we all know what is going on, we should be able to
    work together.

     Actually, you're right:  going into Moscow in the Spring would indeed give
    Cal
    enough time to boot me out in the Fall.  Okay, let's wait for the supported
    attack
    until it can be "for keeps"!

    &gt; hit Denmark to keep you honest?  and the army in Finland, where is that
    &gt; going?
    
    He hasn't told me his plans for Scanda, but he has to be pretty lulled to sleep
    after my removal there.  I'll stick with my planned F Den-s-F Hel-Nth:  the
    worst that can
    happen is that I bounce him there.
    
    &gt;
    &gt;

    As you probably know, a lot of postal zines (Burgess' TAP for one) publish maps
    to
    illustrate game situations each turn.  Jim was kind enough to print up a blank
    map, and I made numerous copies of it:  now I can draw in changes each season,
    and I
    don't have to drag out the game board anymore at all!
    
    &gt;
    &gt;

    &gt; work together.
    
    We can bounce in Tyr, sure, but I want to send A Bur-Mar to follow up your move
    to Spa.  That leaves me nothing to bounce you with.  I'm afraid I have to ask
    you to
    hold in Bel (see how strategically superfluous that move to Bel was?) for now.
    If I
    reach the Nth in the Spring turn, and have an easy shot at Edi, you can stay in
    Bel
    until the smoke clears.

    We are bouncing in Tyrolia, and Belgium holds.  burgundy follows up to

    &gt; Cal,
    &gt; any thoughts on my proposed moves
    
    Sory to take so long to answer.  I didn't have a free minute at work
    yesterday.
    
    As for our moves, I still think I'm going to lose Rum if Black supports Bul.
    
    See, I don't see it as being tactically feasible for him to attack Bul with
    any of his three units because: 1) if he uses Ser to attack, it leaves the
    centre open for A Rum; 2) if he uses A Gre to attack, the support from Aeg
    can be too easily cut, and, finally, 3) if he moves in with Aeg, it leaves
    him wide open for your fleets to move in.  He can attack Rum with very
    little worries that he will leave anything vital open.
    
    I'll accept whatever moves you make, but I really hope you go with F Bla s A
    Rum.

    &gt;
    &gt; Cal
    
    In a nutshell:  A StP-Lvn, A Mun-Bur, A Bur-Mar supported by Gas, A Pic-Bel,
    F Eng-Mao, F Hel-Hol, F Den-Kie.
     Hopefully, I'll be able to pick up Mar this Spring, and Bel in the Fall.
    If Austria
    goes for Bre in the Spring, I'll be in a position to regain it in the
    following turn before
    it costs me anything.
     Austria is giving me the same line that he used when he went to Mun a few
    turns
    back:  "it was 3 in the morning and I got my signals crossed."  Yeah, right.
    Chris is
    offering to "give Mar " to me if I support his A Mar-Spa, and promises to
    retreat
    his A Bel otb if I dislodge it in the Fall.
     Just in case he moves to Ruh in the Spring, I'm covering Hol and Kie.  I
    wonder,
    though, if maybe I should send A Mun-Tyr to bounce a possible Austrian
    Vie-Tyr?
    If Austria moved to Ruh and Tyr this Spring, I'd be in dire threat of losing
    Mun!

    &gt; Message from prosit@execpc.com as Germany to Russia in 'ruffians':
    &gt;
    &gt; In a nutshell:  A StP-Lvn, A Mun-Bur, A Bur-Mar supported by Gas, A
    Pic-Bel,
    &gt; F Eng-Mao, F Hel-Hol, F Den-Kie.
    &gt;      Hopefully, I'll be able to pick up Mar this Spring, and Bel in the
    Fall.
    &gt; If Austria
    &gt; goes for Bre in the Spring, I'll be in a position to regain it in the
    &gt; following turn before
    &gt; it costs me anything.
    &gt;      Austria is giving me the same line that he used when he went to Mun a
    few
    &gt; turns
    &gt; back:  "it was 3 in the morning and I got my signals crossed."  Yeah,
    right.
    &gt; Chris is
    &gt; offering to "give Mar " to me if I support his A Mar-Spa, and promises to
    &gt; retreat
    &gt; his A Bel otb if I dislodge it in the Fall.
    &gt;      Just in case he moves to Ruh in the Spring, I'm covering Hol and Kie.
    I
    &gt; wonder,
    &gt; though, if maybe I should send A Mun-Tyr to bounce a possible Austrian
    &gt; Vie-Tyr?
    &gt; If Austria moved to Ruh and Tyr this Spring, I'd be in dire threat of
    losing
    &gt; Mun!
    
    Obviously, I'd prefer it if you hit Austria with whatever you can, but I'll
    leave that up to you.  I have sent in orders to support you to Livonia.

    Yeah, I do.  I want to make sure I get replies to some messages I sent out.
    That's the main idea behind the Set Wait concept, no?
