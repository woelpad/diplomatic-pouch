    England: I think we have the German position well-covered. He must lose at
    least one of BEL or PAR this year if we co-ordinate our moves. Since that
    would always be a 50/50 guess, would you be willing to help me take Paris
    this year since you will be gaining Sweden anyway? We both gain +1. Then in
    the spring I will cut Picardy's support and you will pick up Belgium then.
    
    I am envisioning:
    
    F ENG - PIC
    F NTH - DEN
    F SWE - BAL
    A BRE - PAR
    A GAS S A BRE - PAR
    
    thus we effectively each gain one, and you deny Russia a build (if he takes
    Sweden then you take Denmark, if he defends Denmark, then you gain Sweden.
    He and Germany waste each others' time battling over BER/KIE/MUN. I would
    then be free with my new build to move into the Med to counter the growing
    Austrian presence in Italy. With some patience we can make this a 3way
    F/E/(AorR) game rather fast.

    &gt;hmmm.   That probably wasn't the plan, was it?  ;)
    
    Brilliant observation, Sherlock... heh heh.
    
    &gt;Nonetheless, I think we can count on Bulgaria as a lock this time around.
    
    Here's hoping I can hang on to everything else...
    
    &gt;I should get Venice,  and you Rumania -- what do you think England's game
    &gt;is?
    &gt;certainly you didn't invite him into Sweden!  (I guess he could have gone
    &gt;to
    &gt;StPete, though.)
    
    Actually, I knew he was going to go there.  It was part of a plan to keep
    Germany guessing that didn't work out exactly as planned tactically.  Have
    to see what he says now though, but I think England is working with me as
    opposed to against me.
    
    Very interesting board.  Are you keeping notes for
    &gt;yourself regarding this one?
    
    Only in my head.  I keep all press and go through all the moves when the
    game is over before doing my end game statement.
    
    &gt;Let me know what you think our next step is.  I'll have sporadic
    &gt;connections
    &gt;for the next four days or so, but I'll do my best to keep in touch.
    
    Have fun,

    I will try to help a bit by moving F MAR-PIE, just support yourself in
    holding in Venice.
    
    At least Austria will not get Venice that way unless he moves A PIE-VEN with
    2 supports. However, I cannot help versus Turkey. The nice thing about
    letting Turkey have the freebie is that he will find it hard to resist
    attacking Austria with his new found units, rather than moving all the way
    west to Spain. Austria is so much closer.

    Well, that didn't work out exactly as planned, did it?  I think Germany
    takes perverse delight in doing exactly the opposite of what he says he is
    doing.  Mind you, France isn't far behind in that either.  I sure didn't
    expect in being in Burgandy this turn, that's for sure.
    
    Anyway, what can we do with the hand they've dealt us?  Obviously, I'd like
    to see you out of Sweden as I'm going to have to do more than just stay
    even, given the Turk's wandering ways.  I can be guaranteed of taking Den &
    Kie this turn which would give me a build even after the loss of Munich is
    taken into account.  I just hope I can outguess Turkey as that would put me
    one down even if I DO get Den & Kie.  How do you feel about the thought of
    my taking those two centres.  Given my shaky position vis-a-vis Germany &
    Turkey, your being satisfied with what I'm doing is quite important to me.
    d;-})
    
    Your odds of getting a build look pretty good anyway.  Belgium is unlikely
    to be supported which would allow you to take it and, for that matter,
    Holland is probably there for the taking just by moving into it.

    Hello Arghh.., no sorry...
    Hello Roland,
    as I was not in the game at the beginning, I cannot exactly know what
    happened before, despite all players say. So, I choose Austria as an ally,
    which seems to be the only one who don't attack me. Of course, he was aware
    of my plan. I ask him not to bounce you, but he did. He was also supposed to
    move in Galicia. Russia say the same about this province. Now I think that
    there is a strong A/R alliance. It's probably a french joke without any
    equivalent in english, but here we could say that we are the turkeys (the
    animals) of the joke.
    Even if I'm right, we have little to do, with you in Aegean and me in
    Naples:-)
    What I just see is, hoping that Austria will try to play alone a little bit,
    proposing him Rumania for himself, to ensure the russian fall, and so on.
    So, he'll probably do that, and then my support of Aegean to Greece shall be
    efficient.
    What do you think about that?

    Hi Chris,
    well I like the way the board go now. It's always the chaos in the West,
    with a great winner, England, but he was so small. Russia will probably
    collapse. He has already lose two centers for taking just one. If he don't
    want to lose Denmark now, he needs his two fleets, so will not gain anymore
    centers, will lose Rumania, so will have no build but destruction. With your
    armies (you shall build one more), it will be an highway to Russia.
    About us, you'll take Venice easily. I'll take Naples and Rumania with your
    support, losing one center, I still don't know which one. But, as you said,
    I don't think it will be too difficult to take it back.
    About the future, I think it should be better to have a No Man's Land in the
    balkans, to soon exchange Italy for me (maritime power), to Russia for you
    (the land power). According to my desire to be in Munich some days, we'll
    find an agreement:-)

    I think that he stands to lose a couple of centres at least.  Barring

    Germany's relationship with England, he could lose Paris or Belgium/Holland.
    I'm not sure how it's going to play out, but those are his potential losses.

    England,
    have not heard anything yet. I was thinking perhaps we could co-ordinate
    with Russia to each pick up a German-owned center this year (plus you are
    getting Sweden). My thinking is if you just leave Russia alone in Denmark,
    then he might be willing to use A BUR to attack PIC, thereby allowing both
    you and me to take BEL and PAR, respectively. It also means that Russia gets
    Denmark in return for loss of Sweden, and that he can take KIE or BER from
    Germany in return for the loss of Munich. If we phrase it the right way, he
    will see it as a good deal, and we ill both benefit as well.

    what if we all three co-ordinated? Suppose you were to do A BUR-PIC. That
    effectively isolates both PAR and BEL. If in return England leaves you alone
    in Denmark you would then be free to also take KIE (using A PRU to attack
    BER...if Germany dares leave Munich then you still own it)
    , a net loss of 3 for the German

    &gt; Hello Arghh.., no sorry...
    
    :-)
    
    &gt; Hello Roland,
    
    Greetings!
    
    &gt; as I was not in the game at the beginning, I cannot exactly know what
    &gt; happened before, despite all players say. So, I choose Austria as an ally,
    &gt; which seems to be the only one who don't attack me.
    
    I do not blame you.
    And neither I know what happened before. I do not remember. :-)
    
    &gt;Of course, he was aware
    &gt; of my plan. I ask him not to bounce you, but he did. He was also supposed to
    &gt; move in Galicia.
    
    Well, I am sure that no one can ever trust him for a long period. He seems
    to lie alot.
    
    &gt;Russia say the same about this province.
    
    Russia is too occupied with other matters... sadly.
    
    &gt;Now I think that
    &gt; there is a strong A/R alliance.
    
    I do not think it is Strong, but they will stick togther as long as they
    have more important enemies.
    
    &gt;It's probably a french joke without any
    &gt; equivalent in english, but here we could say that we are the turkeys (the
    &gt; animals) of the joke.
    
    We do not have the same joke, but I think I get the idea.
    
    &gt; Even if I'm right, we have little to do, with you in Aegean and me in
    &gt; Naples:-)
    
    Exactly, but hopefully that can change.
    
    &gt; What I just see is, hoping that Austria will try to play alone a little bit,
    &gt; proposing him Rumania for himself, to ensure the russian fall, and so on.
    &gt; So, he'll probably do that, and then my support of Aegean to Greece shall be
    &gt; efficient.
    
    Precisly my thinking...
    
    &gt; What do you think about that?
    
    Great! Let´s rock! :-)

    Hello Cal!
    
    I am thinking about your suggestion. The only way I can see me benefitting
    also is if you allow my fleet Sweden to move into Baltic as you support
    Baltic to Kie. This way I can pick up Berlin next year, or maybe move into
    your vacated Kie as you capture Berlin. Anyway, France suggested you move
    Bur-Pic, France takes Brest I take Belgium and you take DEN and Kie. This
    gives you one build. That should be enough, shouldn´t it? What will you
    build if you get one build? Two builds?

    Hi!
    
    I have been pondering what you said and tried to slowly rise the matter
    with Russia. If you also try to convince him into "sharing" Germany I think
    he will fall for it.

    I have been lobbying Russia hard, and I think he would be glad of any plan
    that helps us force Germany to reduce by two units. Of course, we want to
    make sure that Russia does not grow by two units, but rather that we
    benefit. How would you like to proceed with our common units on Germany's
    western frontier. I'd made two different proposals and would like to know
    which one you prefer.

    &gt;Message from LIT95PCD@student3.lu.se as England to Russia in 'ruffians':
    &gt;
    &gt;I am thinking about your suggestion. The only way I can see me benefitting
    &gt;also is if you allow my fleet Sweden to move into Baltic as you support
    &gt;Baltic to Kie. This way I can pick up Berlin next year, or maybe move into
    &gt;your vacated Kie as you capture Berlin.
    
    I like the second suggestion better as it keeps things a little less
    confused in terms of disposition of forces.  But I certainly have no
    objection to your moving to Baltic.  In fact, I think it will allow us to
    take Germany down even quicker.  Go ahead.
    
    &gt;Anyway, France suggested you move
    &gt;Bur-Pic, France takes Brest I take Belgium and you take DEN and Kie. This
    &gt;gives you one build. That should be enough, shouldn´t it?
    
    Well, the question here is, obviously,  what will I lose to Austria and/or
    Turkey?  With the assumption that Munich is lost, I may have to take Den &
    Kie just to stay even.  To guarantee this, I'll have to use Burgandy to hit
    Munich.  Also, I'm not inclined to help out France as the support to Bur was
    not pre-arranged.  He basically deceived me about this and it cost me a shot
    at taking Berlin as I had planned.  I *don't* like being out of position and
    I certainly don't like being tricked into it.  I'd suggest you grab what
    centres you can from Germany and let France go hang.
    
    &gt;What will you
    &gt;build if you get one build? Two builds?
    
    
    Two builds would take a minor miracle.  If I manage to get ONE build I'll
    most certainly stick to building armies.  For the record, that would also
    hold if I did get two builds.  Also, Warsaw and Moscow are the only logical
    places I'd be building anything.  You needn't fear anything being put in St
    Pete's.  A northern campaign against you would be suicidal for me - you DO
    remember that the second St Pete fleet was build at your request and was
    intended to pull your (chest)nuts out of the fire, don't you?  &lt;g&gt;
    
    You're safe from me.  Our interests really do coincide now and for the
    foreseeable future.  I'd like to keep it that way.

    well I had hoped we coudl work together and thus guarantee that one of us
    takes either Paris or Belgium. For example, if you were to move F ENG-PIC
    then I can capture Paris for sure (A BRE-PAR, A GAS S A BRE-PAR, F
    MAO -BRE). However if you convoy to Belgium and support with North Sea then
    German A PIC can only support one of Paris *or* Belgium so one of them
    falls. See?  A lot faster when we work together.

    Sounds good to me.  This is the critical turn where we see just what can be

    &gt;Any idea whether France or Germany might have an interest in cutting my

    My guess is that they are too interested in each other (or me) to bother
    wasting a unit to mess you up.  But then again, this game is notable for

    he claims to stab for effect, rather than for gain, but also claims so after
    the fact. The fellow really does not have a very good grasp of the game.
    I've seen him do it in other games (where there was also no gunboat).

    Rick,
    
    As I'm sure you know, the keeper of this judge is not the most
    accessible person in the world, but have you tried to find out
    what is up??  I know you're just barely in E-Mail contact at
    the moment, but perhaps you at least need to push the deadline
    back....
    
    Thanks for GMing!

    If anybody wants the orders to wait until Monday because of the Judge
    problems, please feel free to push the deadline forward.  I just pushed it
    forward and pushed it back again when I saw that all the orders have
    been submitted already.
    
    I'll try next week to figure out what is wrong with FROG.
    
    Finally saw Star Wars here in England.  Did anybody notice that Ewan McGregor's
    voice as Obi-Wan Kenobi is uncannily similar to Alec Guiness's voice?
    I don't know if they did that using the magic of special effects, or if they
    just tracked down Sir Alec (I think he's actually still alive.)  One thing
    I'm sure of, that is not Ewan McGregor's natural voice.
    
    Kid was lame.  They could have done much better by letting the character be five
    years older and casting a 12-13 year old.  Jar Jar made me start rooting for the
    bad guys.  Other than that it was ok.

    Hi Roland,
    Chris is a wonderful player, but lying to all of his 3 neighbours is
    dangerous. Of course, each time he's the winner, as long as we fight each
    other. I suggest we end this. It's true that I was quite sure that you would
    take one home center in Turkey and not move to Greece, as you knew that I
    would not leave Rome. But, unless the tactical move of Austria and the
    elegant move of France, Austria would have gain Venice, with a chaos in
    Italy, giving him great ability to take the whole province soon.
    Now, I suggest we play as the same country. You know, in all boards, I'm
    looking for a strong ally, trying of course to end the game with more
    centers than him. I try with Austria, now I try with you.
    I will build a fleet in Smyrna (if you agree). Then, I will support your F
    Con to Bul with my BlS, while moving in Aeg. So, either you'll be in Bul,
    either I'll be in AeG. As Bud AND Gal are empty, I'm not too worry about
    Rum, especially with Armenia. Then, I'll NOT take back Con this year but try
    to take Sev. I think that when I say trying, it is sure... So, you'll not
    disband, even if Austria takes Venice, and we will be in a stronger
    position, cause he will have a too large front to defend, especially with a
    weak ally, cause Russia will lose Sweden versus England, and Sev versus me.
    I wait for your reply. I really guess that it is our best hope to play
    together. Melted as we are, Austria will be the main winner if we don't.
    All the best
    Cyrille from Turkey

    Hi,  now I understand what you meaned that Austria is untrustable. I agree.
    But, as long as we fight, he'll be the only winner. Of course, I don't say
    that I'll give you back Rum or Rom . But, I don't ask for Con, and will not
    attack  Sev. I think we have still enough forces to punish him. If we
    continue to fight, melted as we are, he'll be the sole winner. Do you agree?

    Hi Chris,
    well the plan was good. But, do you really not like to be ally with someone?
    You could easily support my attack in Rum, while taking Bul, as I suggest
    (me the fleetsand the sea (with Italy and Spain..., you the army and the
    lands...Russia...). Moreover, it was quite predictable that Russia, who ask
    me one hundred time (maybe less?) to attack you cause you were untrustable,
    accept your plan.
    And so, what do you suggest now?

    Judas was more looking out for number one, I think.  If  E/G/T can stick
    together
    vs. R, Cal will find himself alone and friendless--exactly where he
    deserves to be!
    
    A/I have one another, for better or worse, and France gets no less than
    he can earn
    on his own.  I offered him Paris in exchange for Bre, but he turned me
    down.
    Nothing is good enough for him....

    Cyrille,
    
    Well, I get what I deserve here, I guess.  I think you did promise to cut
    Apulia's support, but that of course is minor compared to me supporting an
    attack against you, isn't it?
    
    Well, not in my eyes, but there you are.  Ijust went through the files, and
    checked, and you NEVER offered me Bulgaria while you took Rum.  Because that
    doesn't make any SENSE.  (Sorry, I am going to take a deep breath.  I can't
    believe that John cut my support fot the attack on Italy.  What was he
    thinking?  I know where he lives, too . . .)
    
    Wouldn't it have made a lot more sense for ME to take Rumania, and YOU to
    take, say, Greece while I moved to the Ionian?  Why didn't I suggest this?
    I had been allied to Cal from the start, and thought that he and I were
    going to last longer.
    
    But no more.  I am a big believer in playing the game at hand.  I spent a
    long, long time looking over the board before deciding to stab you --
    ultimately, it seemed to me that England would grow too strong without
    someone in the north to check him.   I can't do that, you cant do that, but
    now I can set my goals more clearly -- stop England at St Pete and Munich.
    
    As anticipated, you can easily kick Italy out of Con -- keeping him from
    retreating to another center is a different matter, but that's just a matter
    of time.  I am in a worse position, but tactically this is exactly where we
    thought we might be.  Ok, you didn't help me get here, I didn't help you get
    there, but we are both experienced players, and I think we can understand
    how that could happen and move on.  I hope so anyway.
    
    I guess I am proposing that we move forward as if I had written the supports
    for you -- and you had cut the support for me.  If we can do that, I think
    we are both in pretty good shape -- anything else is going to work to the
    advantage of the others, England specifically.
    
    Best,

    Christian:  You did a nice job reducing the Russian threat to the
    centerboard, and
    you've given me time to manouver.
     So now what?  You can build fleets in Lpl and Edi, and send them to
    Iri and
    Nwg.  Please avoid sending another fleet to Nth Sea, and we can
    cooperate vs.
    France and Russia!   I need "space" within which to manouver.
     In the Spring, my F Kie can support your F Den-Balt.  Or, you can
    support my
    F Kie-Baltic.  We can keep up the pressure on France around Bre, until
    you have
    time to send a supported move to MAO.  My idea is to move A Bel-Bur
    supported
    by A Mun, so that Gas can be cut in the Fall.  A Pic can support my A
    Par.  A Paris
    can support your A Wales-Bre if you like!
      Let me know your favored course of action!

    I'm just back in town for the day from my vacation and I'm *PISSED*.
    
    I DID send in the orders we agreed on, specifically F Rum-Bul(ec) and the
    Judge never processed them.  This is while we were getting those blank
    messages.
    
    I'm sending a copy of this to Rick because, once again, the Judge has
    screwed me in a demo game.
    
    What else can I say?  I'm about to head back out of town, but I'll have
    e-mail access when I get to my brother's place.  I'll look a little closer
    at the results and get back to you.  I haven't even read through them

    I'm only back in town for a couple of hours before I leave again, but I have

    Exactly where I "deserve to be"?  What do you mean by this?  I attacked you
    because if I hadn't, you and France would have cleaned up and been the
    dominant alliance.  I saved England's ass by what I did.  Of course, I
    regret that now, but it was the only thing to do at the time.
    
    By the way, I'm now playing this game under protest.  I sent in a change of
    orders to the Judge when it was sending out those blank messages and it
    processed the turn using the OLD orders.  I didn't think that was possible.
    With the orders that should have been used, I would have still fallen victim
    to England, but Turkey would not have gotten Rum.  *I* would have kept it
    and gotten Bulgaria.
    
    Wish we had played this game on a real Judge, if there is such a thing.
    After getting screwed in two out of three demo games by the Judge program, I
    have some pretty big doubts about the programming.

    &gt;Cal:
    &gt;     Bad season for you... I told you you were overextending yourself!
    &gt;Me?  I'm
    &gt;happy with breaking even!
    
    
    Would have been better if the guy who runs the Judge program would sell the
    Fisher-Price crap he's using and buy a real computer.
    
    I never expect gratitude in a game of DIplomacy, but I thought Christian had
    better judgement than that.  Either one of you or France were easy pickings
    and would have solidified his corner position, but instead he attacks me.
    Oh well, I guess I'm not the only one who overextends...

    &gt;     I'll make a deal with you.  You retreat  someplace else than Hel
    &gt;(Skag or otb)
    &gt;and yank A Bur this Winter.  I will stay out of Sil and Pru, giving you
    &gt;a fighting
    &gt;chance vs. Turkey.  Fair enough?
    
    
    Probably the best offer I'll get.  You've got a deal and I'll even promise
    to be a nicer neighbour from now on.  Okay?
    
    &gt;P.S.  Whatever you do, you will never find me to be an "easy mark."
    &gt;Remember
    &gt;that.  I take time to conquer, and that buys time for others to conquer
    &gt;you.
    
    Yeah, I can read tea leaves too, y'know!  d;-})

    &gt;&gt; Wish we had played this game on a real Judge, if there is such a thing.
    &gt;&gt; After getting screwed in two out of three demo games by the Judge
    program,
    &gt;I
    &gt;&gt; have some pretty big doubts about the programming.
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt;that is in the works--and you'll be able to write your own rules variants
    on
    &gt;the fly too.
    &gt;
    &gt; (I can't say more, but I ain't talking 'bout Hasbro). Interested parties
    &gt;can talk to me during AvalonCON (or whatever it is called now)
    
    
    Great.  Can I get on a mailing list or something?

    &gt;Hi,  now I understand what you meaned that Austria is untrustable. I agree.
    &gt;But, as long as we fight, he'll be the only winner. Of course, I don't say
    &gt;that I'll give you back Rum or Rom . But, I don't ask for Con, and will not
    &gt;attack  Sev. I think we have still enough forces to punish him. If we
    &gt;continue to fight, melted as we are, he'll be the sole winner. Do you
    agree?
    
    
    What possible reason could I have for attacking Austria?  I made an offer to
    you to do just that and you chose to not only refuse it, but to call me
    "foolish" for suggesting it!!!
    
    For that matter, how could I possibly trust you?  You have done nothing but
    lie to me since you got into the game.
    
    Sorry.  Make a better offer.

    Sorry Cal, Chris and you had well play the game, saying, he's a lyer,
    you can't trust him, and so on... I was thinking about something like
    that, as none of you move to Galicia last turn, but had no choice but to
    trust Chris, in my point of view. I would have had a bad turn, if your
    true orders had been taking into account.
    Good luck

    &gt; Cal
    I just read that, and you are not honest. I don't lie to you. I say I do
    not want to attack Austria, as he's the only one who (I guess so but it
    was false) want to play with me. You had an opportunity to attack
    Austria, but you didn't. I never say I won't attack you, do I?
    And, as Austria say, you were ally from the start. So, if I had let you
    the BlaS, I would be already dead, now.
    
    Hi Guys:
     As far as I can see, the Judge cannot be counted upon to pass on
    our messages.
    We had better communicate via our regular email addresses until the
    situation is
    remedied.  If ever!

    OK Chris, sure the options are still there. But you can understand that
    now, I just prefer to wait about your actions. Nobody can empeach your
    move Greece-Ionian, and you've no threat on Greece. If you move so,
    we'll see. Anyway, as I say to Cal, your plan was good. I smell
    something last turn, when I see none of you moving in Galicia, as you
    said. That's was the reason why I do not cut the support of Apulia, to
    avois that you take Ven, while giving Russia Munich. I was not prepare
    to the French action at all. Neither were you:-)
    
    We still can work together, and I think you're right. Let's be realistic
    and try to stop England where you can.
    
    Good luck,
    
    Cyrille

    In sign of loyalty, as I always say to take the seas while I let you
    inland, I'll build a fleet.

    Cyrille,
    
    I recieved your latest messages reagrding the build of a fleet and
    continuing our working relationship.
    
    You suggested that I move to the Ionian, and I am fine with that.  How do
    you propose taht we handle the Italian fleet in your homeland?  Also, how
    should we gegin moving our forces so that I take inland ones and you
    coastal?  Should I move Serbia?  Where?
    
    Lets be detailed about this, so that there can be no further confusion.
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    hi Chris, as it turns out I think I will take the Train down to Baltimore.
    Are you driving back on Sunday and if so can I ride with you into NYC?

    (hmm, lessee. Moves are due AFTER AvalonCon, so I can effectively say...)
    
    why, yes, I promise not to ever cut your support, ever, ever again, in any
    game we ever play in
    
    (whew, it hurts to cross my fingers THAT tight behind my back!)
    
    &gt; Yes, I am driving, and yes, you can ride back with me if you promise not

    I wonder if we can switch the game to another judge.
