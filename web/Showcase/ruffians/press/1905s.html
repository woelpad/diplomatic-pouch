    Greetings!
    
    And thank you for your support last turn.
    I am getting incrisingly worried about A and T, and need more active
    support against them.
    The question is from where?
    If you do not help me with Austria I might be forced to help France so
    that he can help me instead.
    You have a lot of armies a couple of them should be able to move across
    the alps.

    &gt; G/I fight early.  Your actions invited A/T into your area, and now you
    &gt; want me to help you pick up the pieces.  I can only deal with Austria

    Christian:
    
      My plan for S'05 is to order A Pic-Bre (again); can you support
    me?  I will also send A Bur-Gas supported by Paris.
     To show his gratitude for my support, Italy is now demanding that I
    attack Austria with my A Mun.  Sigh.  I have to explain the facts of
    life to that boy....

    Christian, altough the talks, I guess Austria will never play with me
    against his, former
    according to Chris, but still current I think, Russia's ally. Officially, I
    still believe him,
    talking to stop England, but I believe it's the last turn where he can find
    me so stupid.
    Actually, I didn't realize that last turn was coming so fast, especially
    after several weeks
    of wait. I have no negociations in it, and the orders I send were not
    coherent at all.
    So, as long as I'm in Warsaw, I can help you. Unfortunately, your army is
    not in
    position for a convoy in Norway. Despite that, I think you'd better to take
    StP this turn.
    Unless you think it's time to stab Germany, it will be a good idea. You'll
    still be in good
    position after, ans as long as Austria plays with Russia, you'll need a
    strong ally, and I
    shall not be this one, unfortunately, so maybe you'd better to cross the
    stalemate line ASAP.
    For instance, moving F Nwg - Barents Sea, F Swe - Botnia, and Ska -Norway. I
    will soon
    be busy, and I'm quite tired in that game. I guarantee you that I'll cut the
    support in
    Moscow, if you need too. Hope that all email games are not so ... delayed.
    I mean, I use to play FTF CONTINUOUS games, and this one is not at all. The
    only
    message of  Austria, with whom I was trying to play, arrived AFTER the
    deadline. So...
    He says he was not able to write before, but the bounce in Bul leads me to
    an opposite
    opinion. And I cannot be sure, as unlike FTF, I don't even see him. Please
    tell me
    what his your opinion.
    Cyrille.

    As you seemed too -poor french, who help you last turn:-) - want do anything
    to
    survive, I think we can try to cooperate. I suggest to move F Con - Aegean.
    Austria will probably build army Trieste, so he can either send it in Serbia
    or in Italy.
    I will tell Austria that I still believe in him, so if he send not it in
    Serbia, you'll be able
    to take Greece, or take Con, or retreat in Con, if things go in the wrong
    way, for
    me at least:-), with Apulia, either move to Ion, or Venise, depending on
    what you want
    a do with A Marseilles. Anyway, I guarantee you that if I need to retreat
    from Rom, I'll
    not retreat in Naples. I don't want to survive a couple of years more. I
    tried Austria and
    Russia, it fakes. If it's not with you, too bad:-)

    That's it, I understand. I does not even see the deadline, that's why my

    Cyrille,
    
    I have a couple of thoughts.  1st, niether of us wants Italy to get anywhere
    where he can do damage -- any MORE damage.  2nd, England is about to crack
    this whole game wide open.  if we don't work together, we are definitely
    going to get steamrolled.  I think our immediate goals should be to
    
    1) Finish off Italy
    2) blockade the Med,
    3) Pressure the German Rear.
    
    Here is my initial plan, if you think these goals are reasonable ones.    We
    need to put you in Naples, and Me in Rome.  Specifically, I think you should
    move to the Tyhrn Sea, and I should follow you in -- that way, I can support
    you into Naples in the fall.
    
    Italy's fleet in Bulgaria can only go 3 places, greece, Con, and the Aegean.
    If you and I bounce in the Aegean in the Spring, I can support you in in the
    fall.  I don't believe it would be a good Idea to let Roland link his two
    fleets up, even for a short while.  As it is, he might move to the Ionian,
    and then I have to worry about convoys from Tunis (ack.).
    
    I will be moving my new fleet to the Ionian (with any luck) at the end of
    the year.  Next year we can take Tunis, and hopefully get to Iberia before
    the Germans/English.
    
    The main question I have, is what to do with Russia?  We can certainly take
    3 of his centers, but can we do that AND hold Germany when he turns around,
    AND stop England at StPete?  I don't know -- it really depends on how long
    F/G stay together.
    I think I should hit rumania, and you should take Sev, in the Spring.  Maybe
    I can convice Cal to work with us -- he is pretty down on the game at this
    point.  If we could use him to hold things in the north, it would be really
    usefull.  But we have to start taking his centers, at the same time.  It's a
    tricky juggling act.
    
    Putting Pressure on Germany is a tough one too -- I'd like to do that right
    now, but I think Next year is when that will have to happen.
    
    That's my take on the situation.  Let me know what you think!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Your fleet moves are okay with me; if I can get into Gas this Spring, I'll be

    The suggestion about arranging a "shadow stab" of Austria is an

    Dear Chris;
     I've got a problem with my new Italian "ally":  he wants me to
    attack you with a
    quixotic solo A Mun charging over the Alps.  If I don't do it, he says
    he'll throw in
    with the French.
     Is there a way that I can make a "show" move of attacking you
    without really
    doing so?  I.,e., can we arrange an attack by Mun with your
    foreknowledge, so that
    you aren't hurt by it?

     You seem intent upon digging in your heels about this Austrian
    thing....
    But you aren't being specific.  Just what is it that I have to do in
    order to retain your
    friendship, and can I still "buy" your support for A Bur-Gas this
    Spring?
      Is it a token A Mun-Tyr that you want?   I could order A Mun-Boh,

    would leave Munich untended with Austria still in Tyr.

    I'm tired of austrian's talks. I guess Russia is still his ally. So, I'll
    try to do something with Italy against him. Of course, due to our very weak
    tactical position, your help should be very useful. According to his build,
    he's not afraid at all with you. With Marseille's fall, france will not
    survive any longer. Of course, it depends on England's attitude, but I
    believe that with the A/R ally, he'd no choice but to play with you.
    He has only one army to defend his territory. I think Italy will attack
    Venise. If so, Austria will only take Rome with Venice, and so will be very
    weak in his home centers. If you move in Tyrolia, you'll have, at least, a
    50% chance of win. Moreover, the pressure on Austria will be really strong
    there.

    &gt; I will move to Nwy whith no support. Bounce me if you like. If you are not
    &gt; in StP/Fin after this move I will vacate Scandinavia for now. Got to kick
    &gt; some French frogeaters before I stab Germany. :-)
    
    Sounds good to me.

    Hello!
     Could you spare your A Pie to support my A Bur-Mar this Fall?  If
    you do, I can
    send A Mun-Bur and build A's Bur and Ber in the Winter.  Come Spring, I
    can send
    armies to Sil and Pru to help you stabilize the situation in Russia!
     Our "implicit" centerboard alliance can continue to become
    "explicit"; together,
    we can be the only superpower on the board!

    Christian:
      Feel free to support yourself to MAO and to move F Nth-Eng.  That
    should cut
    the French support for Bre, and I will finally take it!  Unless someone
    supports the
    Italian in Mar, I may take that as well.
     My plan is to build two armies (if I get that many builds) and send
    them to help
    Austria "stabilize" the situation in Russia.  I promise to build no
    fleets.

    Well, that was a good season, a couple of Little things aside -- did Roland
    seriously guess that we were bouncing in the Aegean, or were you playing a
    little game?  Take Naples, support me into the Ionian, and let's for gods
    sake get to Gibraltar before Christian can!  Support to hold in Greece would

    Cal,
    
    Ok, when you asked about the Proxies, I assumed you were joking.  I guess
    not.
    
    Hmm.
    
    I have tried to cut a deal with Cyrille, but that doesn't look like it's
    going to happen, he is too greedy for it to work.  Also, we are going in the
    wrong directions.
    
    So, the deal now is this -- you can take back Warsaw, or cover StPEte, or
    re-take Sev, but probably not two or three of these things.  I can't do you
    any more harm, well, I guess I could hit Rumania again but I am not going to
    do that!  It was a bad decision on my part in the frist place.  This damn
    game!
    
    I don't know what come s next -- it looks liek E/G have this sewn up unless
    they start to fight.  If you care to set the board up, and see what the
    situation is, and want to do something, let me know.
    Sorry about rumania -- I thought you were cutting your own deals elsewhere.

    &gt;Ok, when you asked about the Proxies, I assumed you were joking.  I guess

    I wasn't.  Although I told Rick I would continue playing, it's my opinion
    that this game should be abandoned.  When the Judge processed that turn
    using my old orders, the game, how can I put this? became no longer valid as
    a contest of skill.  John (France) (or was it Italy?) put it correctly when
    he said that the game had lost all extracurricular value.
    
    &gt;So, the deal now is this -- you can take back Warsaw, or cover StPEte, or

    Just set the board up and there's not much we can do together.  I would
    suggest you support me in Rumania though, because if Cyrille dislodges me,
    I'd have to retreat to an open centre.  Despite your "Rumanian Perfidy",
    Cyrille is still the one who's been yanking my chain all game, so I'd rather
    deny him a centre than take one from you.

    A bow (of the head, anyway) to the Mighty Sultan:
    
     Austria has refused to support me into Mar in return for my allying
    with him
    vs. Russia.  Instead, he demands that I support HIM into Mar and that I
    build fleets
