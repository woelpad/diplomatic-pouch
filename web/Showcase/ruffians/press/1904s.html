    Hi Roland,
    so I suggest to move my F Smy to Ion, while you move Con to Bul,
    supported by my F Blas. I cut the support of Ser with A Rum, and for my
    defense, the support of Sev with A Arm. With Bud free, I think I've only
    a few risk over Rum. Then, I'll support your Fleet Bul to Gre. Then,
    looking at the other moves, I'll see if I attack Sev or take back
    Smyrna, while you take back Rom. I don't think it'll be possible this
    year but, as I say, there is still too many possibilities, considering
    Austria and Russia's moves.
    Waiting for your reply,
    Cyrille.

    Hi Chris,
    I don't know if you received my last message. As I didn't (don't fire at
    the judge, it may be my fault:-), I doubt of it. So, here is the global
    line: due to Russia's destructions, but I would probably have done the
    same, England has really good opportunities of growth. The best thing is
    to push F/G together, but looking as the beautiful words they use to
    send to the other, I don't think those two guys can play together. So,
    we have to do our job.
    I try to push the It F Con in Bul, then we'll be able to destroy it
    easily. So, please, as I ask him to bounce you, don't go there. I think
    you'd better attack Italy with Pie this time, so you're 99% sure to go,
    and also, France will see no threat in it, and he'll probably need his
    army sooner or later, against England. Then, you'll be able to send an
    army in Bohemia, then against Russia. All your armies are so far from
    him now.
    As it is an italian FLEET, you could then move to Bul. I'll take Sev
    with Arm. Then, as you'll be able to free Tri (you'll only need 2 units
    on Venice), you would cover Bud. So, you'll take Bul, destroying the
    Italian Fleet, while I take bach Con. Even if it is not destroyed, with
    2 centers less, he'll collapse. I'll then build another fleet.
    Of course, ASAP, it'll be interesting to exchange Greece (taken by a
    fleet of course:-) ) vs Rum. I think also, as there are little gains at
    short or middle term in the coastal West (Spain is far), I'll try to
    take Russia (ie Sev, Mos and about War???) while you take the rest. So,
    stopping England in Mun will be your task. I'll be in charge of the Med,
    and St Pet.
    Waiting for your opinion,
    Cyrille

    Hi Cal,
    I have no reply from you. I hope you had my last message, and recognize
    that I'm not the lyer you said. We have no treaties since I join the
    game, so how can they have been broken?
    Anyway, I hope to find an agreement with Italy, my "ally" in the
    "exchange of capitals strategy", to go against Austria. His main
    weakness is Gal. As it is also a good way to attack me, if you want to,
    I guess you'll go:-)
    But talking about the details, i'll be glad to talk with you.
    Good luck,
    Cyrille.

    So, Roland, my ally! It seems we mistify everybody, with our perfect
    strategy! Come on now, let's invade England!
    
    Chris:
     You're going to have to cover Nth Sea from the vengeful Russian,
    but it was
    unfortunate that you couldn't build a F Lpl and have a real shot at
    taking MAO this
    Fall.
     The ideal situation would be for you to be able to trap the Russian
    F Ska where
    it is, move to Nth and Nwg and then, in the Fall, annihilate the pesky F
    Ska!
     It was nice seeing Russian removals that were "nice to me":  I
    never earned his
    attacks on me, and he knew that!   I'm sure that he disappoints John,
    though!
     This Spring, I can move my F Kie-Bal, if you do not object, or it
    can hold where it is.  That fleet is at your disposal, should you need
    help in covering Scandinavia.
     On the French front, I can support an army into Bur from which it
    can reach Gas.
    In the Fall, your F Eng can cut MAO, my A Bur can cut Gas, and I can
    support an
    army into Bre.  That will eliminate France as a factor in the northern
    side of the
    board.
     Stay well!  Paul
    
    
    Paul,
    
    I am going to move as you also suggested, covering Nth, moving Edi-Nrg.
    This way I can disband F Ska in the fall.
    
    More than that, my fleets are well positioned to move against France
    anytime, and fleets are no danger to you anyway. I can see StP fall within
    a few years, thus helping you get Brest seems fair. After that I guess
    Iberia should be mine while you turn your attention towards the growing
    Austria. Whether you move Kie-Baltic or not is your choice, I do not need
    your fleet to conquer StP. Maybe you'd like to move it to Holland to make
    sure I don't stab you. You choose. :-)
    Allright?

    Cal,
    
    Sorry for the stab...:-) I just thought is was good for the game balance. A
    growing Austria is always good for a growing England.
    
    This year I will move to Nrg and Nth to be able to recapture Nwy in the
    fall. This gives you two possibilitys
    
    1. Retreat Nwy-StP
    
    2. Retreat Off the board
    
    Should you choose to retreat off the board you get another build in your
    homecountry AND i promise not to capture StP. If you look on the position
    on the map you can see that time is ripe for me to move against Germany. I
    benefit nothing from taking StP and making Turkey getting the rest of russia.
    
    /Christian, with hope of new ways of working together.

    Christian:
     We have a deal!  I will stay out of Baltic, and park my fleet in
    Holland.  I will
    go for Bre in the Fall, and Mar after that, while you have rights to
    Iberia on your
    way south!
     I will keep an army in Mun for now to watch my unpredictable
    southern
    neighbors.  Perhaps one of them will invite me down to Tyrolia!

    I just got a very discouraging message about FROG.  So, I suggest we
    move the game.  (We did this during PouchToo, and it led to the
    immediate reappearance of the original Judge.  However, I think in
    this case the move will be permanent.)
    
    Please sign on to the game at USEF.  (Note that the address for USEF
    has very recently changed to usef@devel.diplom.org.  David got a good
    offer for the igo.org domain name, and it looks like he took it.)
    
    Please use "set preference" to set the power preference to that
    country which you are currently playing.  Once everybody signs on,
    I'll update the board position.  
    
    I have much more confidence in USEF than in FROG.

    &gt;The game will not be listed in the standard catalogue of available games.

    p.s. if anybody needs a dedication drop to play on USEF, let me know.
    Anybody who has yet to register on USEF will need to go through the

    I agree with Rick, although he went with FROG since it is in the
    time zone where he currently lives, FROG will probably be out
    for all of August.  It's good we're getting started with the
    "new" usef address.  Good luck getting everyone over here safely.

    &gt; I spoke to my folks about getting together for bridge some night -- they
    &gt; seemed to think it was a good idea -- so maybe on a sunday soon?
    
    very kewl! I havent played since May, so the withdrawal was starting to be
    noticeable
    
    &gt;
    &gt; My brother should be mailing me the toads from Dragonflight, including
    your
    &gt; Best Italy -- Since you withdrew from competition (you savvy meta-gamer
    &gt; you!)  I ended up taking 2nd.  Im not sure  i like or approve of the
    scoring
    &gt; system, though.  whatever.
    
    Yeah, I noticed that the results of playing in only 2 rounds really bumped
    up my score. (he sent out a summary of DragonFlight Dip last week by snail
    mail). However, I didn't play more than 2 rounds basically cuz that seems to
    be my interest limit when it comes to face2face. I dunno why...just that the
    next day, Sat. when choosing between playing Dip and doing something else my
    first impulse was "well I played 10 hours of Dip yesterday, so what's the
    big deal?"  I didn't pay enough attention to the scoring system to get an
    opinion one way or the other...although I would have liked to have known,
    ahead of time, that play in the final was *required* for final
    placement--that wasn't entirely clear at all.
    
    &gt;
    &gt; Hey, you gonna let me take Venice this time around?  Don't you have enough
    &gt; problems without messing me up?  Jeez, who do you expect to stop the turk?
    
    no problem with Venice.
    
    will you be able to send an army into TYR or BOH to help me versus Germany?
    
    Also what about a Dip game in NYC some SUnday soon. I can probably
    contribute 3-4 players.

    Of course Roland, I'm also your ally. I'm ally with everyone of the board of
    course, like Christian:-)
    BTW Rick, can you send me the last orders I send with the old judge, if you
    have, it'll help me to remember. It's my first game on a judge, and one of
    the first via email, and it doesn't look at all like a FTF game. I hope
    we'll end it before the death of one of us!
    As Cal, if anybody want to refresh my mind on my former affirmations and
    suggestions, do not hesitate!
    Happy Xmas,
    Cyrille.
    PS:don't worry Rick, I'm more amused than worried, and you couldn't be aware
    of the judge weakness. I'll play my best, as I always try to play.

    Sorry, Cyrille, I don't have those orders.  I'm sure the other players
    will help you remember what they are supposed to be.  :)

    Hi Chris, so how shall I be eat? You didn't reply when I ask about our past
    plans. I don't have a wrotten note, so I shall use my poor memory. We
    planned to stop as quickly as possible England, in Munich and St Pet for
    instance. Building fleets, I'll take care of the Mediterranean sea ASAP. And
    what do we do with Italy and Russia?

    Hi Roland,
    so I think to remember that we planned to bounce Austria in Aegean while you
    take Bul with Con, so we can exchange centers, to a better position for both
    of us, closer to the front with Austria and outside my home centers.
    Waiting for your reply

    Hello Cyrille!
    
    I didn't realize that your message "what was going on" was real, and not
    humourous.  My wife is about 6 months pregnant, so I have been giving
    perhaps a little less attention to diplomacy lately!  ;)
    
    I belive that we should work together from here on out.  I intend to take
    Venice and then try to get units to the Munich border.
    
    If you would like, I could send my Fleet, which is now in Greece, to the
    Aegean if you are planning on killing the Italian fleet in Con.  Let me
    know, if you would like me to do that, otherwise I'll go to the Ionian.
    
    I'd really like to play the position as it is now, rather than our past
    differences.  I hope you feel the same -- keep an eye on me, I'll keep an
    eye on you, and we'll get along fine.
    
    So, let me know what you would like to do, and lets get this game on the
    road!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Yes, that is right. But I am also awaiting to hear what you plan to do with
    your F Rom...

    Well Chris, I can understand that your wife state can give you some trouble,
    but leave diplomacy, no :-)
    Thanks you for the proposition, but I guess you'd better move in Ionian.
    We'll soon be able to block (at leas) the Mediterranean Sea. I think it's
    better to leave an italian fleet while we take all centers in Italy. As long
    as I follow him, nothing can really happen. Sooner or later, he'll destroy.

    Hello Roland. I suppose you want me to move in TyS. I can say that I'll not
    move in Naples and wait to see what happened of your fleet in Con. Then I'll
    see. Do you agree? If not, please tell me more about your plan.
