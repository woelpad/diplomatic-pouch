    with all this public press going on I assume you and I are still on for a
    sea lion?
    
    altogether too much talk by the observers, if you ask me

     The petty chitter-chatter taking place in the broadcast press is
    doing nothing but
    annoying me (cluttering up my mailbox).  No one has suggested ANY plan
    better
    than the Sea Lion, much less a BETTER one!  I'm with you 100%

    Hey, Guys!
     I'm wondering if you two ever received my message proposing the
    neutralization of Tyrolia.  As you know, open space between us is the
    best way to
    ensure peace in the centerboard.  If we generate a war in the middle of
    the map, it
    will only serve as a magnet to draw the corner powers in our direction!
     I am also willing to stay out of Bohemia.
     Russia seems to be "strongly considering" a move of A Mos-Stp in
    Spring 1901,
    to place "a better claim" to Scandinavia.  I'm not too sure that I want
    that to happen.
    I'll move to Den in the Spring, so that I have the option of bouncing
    the Tsar over
    Swe this Fall.
     Most of the broadcast press in this game (thus far) has been
    nothing but idle
    chatter cluttering up my mailbox.  It resembles closely the crap that
    I've seen on
    Internet discussion groups....

    I've been waiting for a reply from YOU to my last message (maybe five days
    ago?).  Guess you missed it in the mail, eh?  d;-})
    
    The gist of it was me asking you what you had heard lately in the west.  I'm
    still considering moving that army in Moscow north, but the silence in the
    south has me too worried about a potential A/T to do so.  I'd like to, but I
    need to hear a bit more before deciding.

    Don't let Cal off so easily, make him paranoid, tell him that you'd
    heard that everyone else has set up a private chat room and are
    talking about taking Russia out by the end of 1902.

    Well, of course it is!  That's why it would have been so easy.
    I suspect that there are a lot of Namur travelers, but it seems
    that so far everyone has just been jousting in the public press.
    At some point people will have to get down to brass tacks on their
    moves for the Spring.  I guess you still have two weeks though,
    right?
    
    No, I take it back, there has been LOTS of private communication,

    The private press for the last two demo games ghodstoo & pouchtoo are on

    Yes, pouchtoo is not up yet, but ghodstoo is.  Since many of you observers
    will pop off to look at ghodstoo, I should explain that was the first
    and only Judge game I've ever mastered and one of the reasons that
    Rick is Master here is his experience.  This shows up in the organization
    of the press on ghodstoo at a number of points.  There is still a
    tremendous amount of meat there.
    
    I would advise you looking at three or four places in the ghodstoo
    press if you're looking for interesting stuff.  Fall 1901 and the
    discussions of the "quadrapartite alliance" are fascinating when
    you can look at the group and private discussions.  Then there
    are the "Press to Master" descriptions in the early mid-game
    (1903-1905) where these brilliant diplomats are explaining their
    thinking to me.  Finally, go to the last season and the end-game
    discussions.

    I don't know about the others, but I'm back from WDC.  It was good to finally
    meet you guys - hopefully we'll see each other again soon.
    
    I would like to state that we now have TWO world champions playing in this
    game - congratulations Christian on an outstanding performance.  I hope the
    bus journey back home wasn't too tiresome!  I think you should be honoured in
    the traditional way by having a target painted on your back.  I am sure your
    neigbours in this (and future) games will be practicing already.
    Congratulations are also due to Chris on winning "Best Diplomat" - you made a
    gallant defence of your title against all the odds.
    
    Unfortunately, I did not fare so well.  But then again, I am only an

    I feel the same way.  Perhaps next time I'll get to play in a game
    with one of you three (Chris, Chetan, Christian).  I suppose I
    shouldn't complain though, should I!  I'm sure that would have been
    much more difficult than the game I had in the first round with a
    board full of Belgian newbies.

    Chetan beat me to the punch.  Gratz to Christian for taking home the
    gold, and gratz also to Chris for "Best Diplomat" and "Favorite Player".

    What Chetan fails to mention is that he finished 6th overall.  Of
    course, we could say that failing to make the final board justifies
    keeping him at Intermediate.  But I don't know where that would put
    the rest of us.
    
    I was told WDC info would be posted at

    Hi Chris!  Well, now that WDC is out of the way, hopefully we can get into
    some meaningful communication in this game.  It's been way too quiet for my
    taste so far.
    
    Was there anything discussed about this game at WDC?  It's been my
    experience that games like this DON'T get talked about too much when
    participants meet FTF at conventions.  Of course, this may have been
    different this year.
    
    I'd like to know what your take on the game so far is.  There hasn't been
    much discussed that *I'VE* heard so far.  Maybe I should start getting
    paranoid?  &lt;g&gt;

    Seriously though (I hope &lt;G&gt;), are we still on the same page as regards
    Austria?  I've heard little from him or Italy, so my initial feeling is that
    there may be an A/I.  That certainly can't be good news for you if true.

    Hi Roland!  I hope, now that WDC is over, we can get some semblance of
    communication going in this game.  Nobody has been writing, so I hope we can
    at least compare notes.
    
    I have still heard very little from either Austria or Turkey and that still
    makes me nervous.  Have they been in communication with you?  I'd like to
    have a little idea of what is going on so as to get a handle on where I
    should move for Spring 1901 at least.  Any suggestions?

    I'm hoping you and I are still cool on NOT having a confrontation in
    Scandinavia.  We're better off settling our particular ends of the board
    before looking anywhere else (other than diplomatically, of course).
    
    Have you heard anything of interest?  One tidbit you might be interested in:
    Germany has dropped a couple of hints that I might want to send my Moscow
    army north "just in case".  Since I am not about to do that, (the east is,
    IMHO, far too unsettled), I don't mind giving you the tip.

    Gents,
    
    Just back from Belgium and a quite lovely vacation.  Only managed 34th in
    the WDC touney, but as I came away with the votes for "Best Diplomat" and
    "Favorite Player", I suppose I can't complain.
    
    I agree with the DMZ of Tyrolia.  It can't do any of us any good to go

    Indeed!  I am just returned, and feel good about my placeing at the con.
    But for one mistake in judgement, I might have placed in the 20s, rather
    than 34th.  Live and Learn!
    
    I also met our erstwhile Turkey -- Chetan.  Good lord he is a ferocious
    player.  came in 6th overall and missed a shot at winning the whole thing by
    three centers in an earlier game.
    
    This game didn't get discussed by or to me at all!  Somewhat surprising, but
    we all had other things to talk about.
    
    My plan is to try and keep Chetan in check.  Italy is making noises about
    opening to Tyrolia and Venice, as if this wouldn't bother me in the least.
    So, if you don't want to bounce in Galacia, That would be fine by me!

    Your Holiness,
    
    I was wondering what the plan is now?  If we are going for the joint assault
    on Germany, I'd prefer for you to not open Rome -&gt; Venice.  To much
    potential for a stab.  OTOH, if I order Trieste -&gt; Venice, resulting in a
    bounce there, that would be ok.  But we should co-ordinate it.

    Chetan!  Congrats again on the grand finish at WDC.  I really liked your
    wide-open style of play, by which I mean agressive and very fluid.  I am
    interested to see how you and I will fare in this game.
    
    I returned to find over 30 messages regarding this game!  Crazy.  What have

    Happens.  FTF cons are a lot more luck than most people realize.  Sometimes
    a game is won or lost by the table assignments or by who picks what colour
    out of the box.  I've won a couple of CanCons, IMHO, by luck as much as
    skill.
    
    &gt;This game didn't get discussed by or to me at all!  Somewhat surprising,
    but
    &gt;we all had other things to talk about.
    
    
    Not so surprising.  I didn't expect much would be discussed.  Seems kinda
    weird, but that's been my experience at Cons.  Games outside of the current
    FTF setting get pretty much ignored.
    
    &gt;My plan is to try and keep Chetan in check.  Italy is making noises about

    Yeah, that shouldn't be a problem.  With the lack of communication, I'm not
    going to be the first to trigger a war.  My moves will be such that I can
    react effectively in F01 to ANY S01 threats.  d;-})

    Absolutely nada.  I tried to write a couple of letters, but everything went
    unanswered.  Almost seemed like a moratorium existed for the length of WDC.
    
    Let me know what you hear.  I'd like to commit to something, but I'm looking
    to hear that first decent offer from someone.  Hasn't happened yet, so my
    view is certainly objective!

    Roland,
    
    After much thought and soul searching, I find I am not comfortable with
    giving you Trieste in 01.  In the long run, I have no objections, and it
    certainly cements the alliance between us nicely -- you know I can't build
    fleets, and wont be sneaking into Venice, and once ownership is established
    you move on and I have the same assurances.  But, against this quality of
    opposition, I think I am going to have to refrain from making this exchange
    quite so early.
    
    So, I have no problem opening to Bohemia, Serbia, and Albania, but please
    dont move rome -&gt; Venice.  I shall happily support you into Munich in the
    Fall.

    Roland,
    
    Sorry to spoil our plans, but I figured we'd both be happier if we discussed
    matters.
    
    As to problems, yes, I still think it's Chetan we need to worry about first.
    He has the savvy to play it slow, non-threateaning and then explode when
    either of us turns away.  I don't know so much about Cal, in Russia, but
    you'll want to keep an eye on John in france.  He is also quite good.

    &gt;I'm hoping you and I are still cool on NOT having a confrontation in
    &gt;Scandinavia.  We're better off settling our particular ends of the board
    &gt;before looking anywhere else (other than diplomatically, of course).
    Of course I am still wanting a non-confrontation in Scandinavia, as we both
    could take advantage from that.
    
    
    &gt;Have you heard anything of interest?  One tidbit you might be interested in:
    &gt;Germany has dropped a couple of hints that I might want to send my Moscow
    &gt;army north "just in case".  Since I am not about to do that, (the east is,
    &gt;IMHO, far too unsettled), I don't mind giving you the tip.
    All I know is that Austria (Chris) tells me he압 going to Galicia and that
    you might be moving Mos-StP. I don앖 know if he says that because it압 true
    or because he wants to scare me away from working with you.

    Roland:  I think it's time we started to do a bit more communicating.  I'm
    hearing rumours that Austria is planning on moving to Galicia and Turkey
    isn't even answering my letters.  This adds up to trouble for me and,
    eventually, for you.
    
    I need to know if there is any chance of your attacking Austria.  If you
    don't, it will give A/T a fast start and you will be the next target.  Some
    positive action against one or the either (preferably Austria) is, I think,
    definitely in your self-interest.
    
    Can you please give me some idea of what you intend to do? Or at least let
    me know if I'm on my own here... d;-})  Nobody is bothering to write much
    and, when they do, it's been one sentence at most.  That's rather
    disconcerting for a "demonstration" game.

    Whatever his reasons, it's not true.  I considered it at first, but
    obviously wanted to wait until the south sorted itself out.  With your (and
    other's) confirmation of Austria's move to Galicia and Turkey's near total
    silence (I thought this was a demo game...), I'd say the south is sorting
    itself out distinctly unfavourable to Russia.  That precludes any possible

    Hi Christian,
    
    I certainly don't mind if you take Belgium in 1901, as long as we have the
    understanding that
    
    1) you will take it with a fleet, rather than an army
    2) you will be moving out of Belgium in 1902
    
    I want to concentrate on the Med, so I'd like to have as few issues to
    resolve in the North as possible. Depending on Germany's moves you and I

    must advance as planned!
     England has also asked me for Bel (which I've graciously
    "consented" to give
    him), and he'll be moving a standard A Lpl-Edi, F Edi-Nwg and F
    Lon-Nth.  He'll
    be set up to allow your move to the channel!
    
     Until Monday, my "real life" job as a Background Investigator was
    taking me on
    constant commutes throughout southeast and south central Wisconsin.  My
    "raw
    material" largely lies in county libraries....  And now, finally, the
    Wisconsin
    Circuit Courts have gone online with all their data:  I can access the
    records I need
    without leaving my home PC!  My car will probably be happy to be faced
    with far
    less abuse....

    Hi Chris!  Congratulations on your World Championship; I'm impressed, to
    say the
    very least.  I myself am a lousy FTF player; people can read my facial
    expressions
    too well...or something.
     I do think that it is fairest that you get Bel; France has his two
    easy builds from
    Iberia, and Hol/Den are enough for me to get a decent start.  Without
    two builds,
    your England would be hampered against Russia, to say the least!  I'll
    hold off on
    recommending which units for you to build until we get through the first
    gameyear;
    let's see what the opening moves look like!
    
     In "real life", I am a Background Investigator.  The bulk of my
    research is done
    on computer terminals at County Libraries, throughout the State of
    Wisconsin.
     Now, the Wisconsin Court system has gone online and I can access
    all my dirt
    right from my home PC!  This will save my car and I a lot of stress from
    all the
    back and forth travelling, not to mention a lot of time....

    Note to whoever reads these things after the game is over - Christian
    couldn't send this via the judge for the reasons stated below, so I'm just
    cycling this through for posterity's sake.
    
    Geez, I feel noble...  d;-})

    &gt;Hello Cal!
    &gt;
    &gt;I send this email via my hotmail account to able to write to you from
    &gt;the university. The judge doesn't want to accept my signing on since I
    &gt;now has another reurnaddress than when I write from home. This is why I
    &gt;send it not via the judge...
    &gt;
    &gt;Anyway, look and behold! I recieved an email from France! He tells me
    &gt;he's going to concentrate in the Med which sounds like a lie. Noone
    &gt;wants to start off attacking Italy when playing France, since it is
    &gt;almost impossible to get anywhere against the mussolinis. I guess this
    &gt;even more tells us that there is a G/F alliance and that maybe Italy is
    &gt;in it to, just stabbing Austria in the back. This however is good for
    &gt;you, especially if Turkey and Austria attacks you. Then you might be
    &gt;able to convine Turkey to attack Austria instead and by that growing.
    &gt;Well, I don't know. As you said,the first moves will show.
    &gt;
    &gt;And what wise words you keep passing on to me..."The universe was once
    &gt;conceived..." Bravo!
    &gt;
    &gt;signing off

    &lt;&lt;Now that WDC and the Lyon
    conference are over, I should be online essentially constantly through
    at least mid-July.

    You have got to see "The Matrix" when it hits Europe, gang.  Killah Flik!
    The fight scenes alone are worth the price of admission.

    rick,
    
    Thanks, I had a good time at the Con, and really only felt targeted for
    destruction in 2 games -- hmmm, the two games I didn't do well in. . . .
    
    Lyon sounds like a cool place!
    
    As to A Vienna, thanks -- I was waiting for diplomatic responses before
    deciding where that unit'd go.  The order is in now!

    Tsar cal,
    
    
    Well, here we are at deadline time, and I have heard nothing from Chetan,
    the Turk.  The last thing I heard from him regarding this game was before
    WDC, so I have no idea how he is going to open.  have you spoken to him
    lately?
    
    I shall not be moving to Galacia, and I trust you shall not either.  Best of
    luck in 01, and lets look at our options for the fall when the results come
    in, yes?

    &gt;Tsar cal,
    &gt;
    &gt;Well, here we are at deadline time, and I have heard nothing from Chetan,
    &gt;the Turk.  The last thing I heard from him regarding this game was before
    &gt;WDC, so I have no idea how he is going to open.  have you spoken to him
    &gt;lately?
    
    &gt;I shall not be moving to Galacia, and I trust you shall not either.  Best
    of
    &gt;luck in 01, and lets look at our options for the fall when the results come
    &gt;in, yes?
    
    
    I have also heard very little from anyone and nothing from Chetan since WDC.
    Mind you, the "little rumours" I DO hear seem to imply an A/T alliance which
    has me a bit concerned.  However, I DO think it unlikely that Chetan would
    write to you and ignore me completely, so I am prepared to disregard the
    "little rumours".
    
    As for Galicia, I will not be going there.  1901 will see me simply try to
    get the usual (for Russia) couple of builds and sort things out in the east.
    Since it's obvious I can trust you to keep in touch, I'm hoping very
    strongly that you and I can work together.  I'd much  rather have an ally
    who writes than an ally who is silent. Heck, I'd rather have an ally who
    writes and LIES than an ally who is silent... &lt;g&gt;
    
    I'll get back to you after the moves tonight.  I'm on afternoon shift now
    while training for my new job, so I (probably) can't answer any messages
    until I get home.
    
    Later
    
    Tsar Cal
