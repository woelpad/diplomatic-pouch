    John,
    
    Yipe!  I am looking at the map and still seeing this as a possible solo for
    ME, and at worst a 3 way with Turkey and England.  What am I not seeing?

    Meef, this is all a ploy to get at Chris.  I'm going to make a bunch of
    noise about the game being over, but it's all a ruse to try to get him to
    back off.
    
    As for his questions to you, feel free to play it dumb or even better, make
    it seem like you think the game is over too.
    
    My only hope is to psych Chris out.

    Gentlemen, gentlemen...
    
    I have to disagree with you all. This game is not over and Chris is not
    throwing the game to me. Note that he retreated to Piedemont keeping my
    Marseilles instead of ridding Austrian Italy of Turkey. A choice in my
    taste actually.
    
    Here큦 why the game is not over:
    There is no way I can gain Germany+StP+Tunis. When I reach the critical
    point you will all start boffing at me.
    
    This game may in my opinion end in three different ways:
    1) DIAS ERT
    2) DIAS ERA
    3) DIAS ETA
    
    All this said, I will still vote for a concession to England. A solo is a
    solo is a solo. Besides, I wanna brag about soloing against the American
    World Champ, proving European World Champs are better! *smile*
    
    So, this game will end in a DIAS. Let the plotting begin, let the cunnings
    of our twisted minds decide who will and who will not be in the draw...
    
    all the best to all of you
    Christian

    I realize that this message goes in the game record and can be studied
    by others, so I will be careful in what I say and remind you not to
    E-Mail me back directly anything you don't want put on record.
    
    The depth and subtlety of this game at this point is very good.
    I dismiss all of the public statements today by current players
    as posturing with my analysis being:
    
    1) England has very high hopes of winning, but is a bit flabbergasted
    at the discussion since he sees a win as still quite far off.  Chris
    clearly can't give him a win alone and I doubt that England sees anyone
    else laying down for him (in particular Cal allowing England to take
    St. Pete does not look promising -- though recall that theoretically
    England can put four units on it.  In this kind of situation, the
    great difficulty is coming up with those four units without something
    collapsing elsewhere.
    
    2) France and John Quarto von Tivadar shows me again why I believe
    he is one of the top five players in the world.  As "no longer a
    player" he is only slightly posturing.  He is a great FTF player
    because he grasps the strategic implications of a position faster
    than anyone I know.  His press was a classic and I look forward
    to reading his earlier one eventually.
    
    3) Chris has that touch of craziness that makes him a fascinating
    player to watch.  I like to play Austria the way he has played it
    here.  I find threats to throw the game a universal part of the
    Austrian arsenal.  I still am not sure Chris ACTUALLY intends to
    throw the game.  I am not revealing anything significant to say
    that I sent him a note asking him some questions and he did not
    respond to me..... just as it should be.
    
    4) Cal is also crazy like a fox.
    
    5) In this kind of situation, everyone knows that getting Turkey
    OUT of the draw is just SO difficult.  In this case, I really doubt
    it can be done.  I don't see why Austria can't be the third partner
    in a three way (I don't discount the idea that this is still Chris'
    goal), but Austria getting Turkey out of the game just won't happen.
    In the end game, I frequently find the lack of dynamics over Turkey
    extremely frustrating (true if I am playing Turkey, or playing
    against Turkey).  This challenges Calhamer's vision.  I really want
    to get that Star Trek Dip game in my szine going since the round
    uniform board precludes static positions.  I also rethought my
    position and that rotating board will be allowed. [sorry for the
    digression to future readers]
    
    In sum, there is lots more play in this game and Cal knows it.
    Cal could be aced out, but I still think there will be a play
    to eliminate Turkey.  It is just SO difficult though.  If Cal
    and Chris pull it off it will be a great achievement.
    
    I don't want to say more for fear of "poisoning the timeline".

    Christian,
    
    Well, I don't think its true to say that we haven't said ANYTHING true to
    each other.  There must have been a time, somewhere in there, when I was
    attacking Germany that we worked together, wasn't there?
    
    I am predicting a 3 way ATE finish.  Accordingly, I will be turning the
    defense of Italy and tunis over to the Turks, as soon as he can get there.
    I think with the army on the other side of switzerland I can keep you from
    taking all of Germany, and probably stop you before you get too far into
    Russia as well.
    
    If you'd like to work towards that end, I am game.  Go take StPete with a
    fleet (north coast, need I say?)  Let me have Germany and Marsailles and The
    southern Russian home dots, and I'll let Turkey have all the coastal centers
    south of Venice/Trieste, and we can all go home happy.
    
    "European WDC's are worth more than American ones" indeed!  ;)  Coming to
    Baltimore?
    
    Oh, speaking of travel, there is a big Swing Dance camp in Herrang, Sweden,
    in July, and I am planning on coming!  Do you think there might be a little
    F2F action to be found in the whole of Sweden the 3rd week of July?
    
    All the best to you and the little one!

    PAul,
    
    I was writing a letter to you this afternoon, when the baby started acting
    up and I had to stop everything -- when I got home from work,  something had
    happened, and no letter.  ;(
    
    The effect of it was this -- Should you go into Munich to stay at three, and
    remove A Munich in the Winter?  I think I can power back into Burgundy if
    you do this, and the three fleets you have will be crucial to forcing
    Christian to a draw.  I for one will be willing to leave Munich yours behind
    my lines providing I CAN in fact put it behind my lines.
    
    The problem here is that I was counting on only losing one center to Turkey
    this turn, and its going to be two.  I'll still have a build, (I am one
    short now), which I was planning on sending through Munich to shore up
    defenses there.
    
    Or do you think we should keep the army in place?  If you only keep two
    units I think Denmark is going to fall, and once he can put a fleet in the
    Baltic I am going to be hard pressed to hold Berlin and Kiel.  ( I know how
    much that would pain you.  ;)
     I can send Bohemia back into Munich, and then I don't think Christian will
    be able to crack Burgundy any time soon, infact,  re-taking paris wouldn't
    be out of the question.
    
    You have the crucial northern fleets that Cal wouldn't provide -- that is
    why I am taking him down.  Let me know your thoughts, and lets work
    something out.
    
    best,
    
    Chris

    Meef,
    
    Well, I think I have a plan that we can both live with.
    
    How about I turn over defense of the Med to you?  Every coastal Center south
    of Venice/Trieste to you, and in return I build the armies that hold the
    line in the north.
    
    That'd be Tunis, Naples, Rome, Greece, and as much of Iberia as you can
    take.  (Marsailles to remain mine).
    
    I build no more fleets, you don't build ANY armies.  If you want Sev, you
    are welcome to take and hold it with a fleet.  That, by my count, would put
    you at 9 and make you a player in anyones book.
    
    This season?  How about you dislodge my fleet in the Ionian, so that I can
    disband it and re-build as an army?  F Greece S F Emed -&gt; Ionian.  hey, if I
    retreat to Aegean, you're building two fleets anyway, right?  So I won't,
    I'll build an army, and get it into Germany, while the rest of my forces
    quickly take out Cal.  Sev to you will make it that much faster.
    
    What do you say?  You don't have to do anything but take my centers and not
    build armies.   Is there anything about this that you don't trust?  (Ok,
    maybe it sounds too good to be true.  But GHODDAM I want to WORK with
    someone in this game instead of fight everyone!)

    &gt;
    &gt; Chris, sometimes I just can't believe that I'm still trying to help you repair
    &gt; the situation that you broke yourself when you rejected a strong A/G.  Your
    &gt; dilemmas are largely of your own making, and I won't let you forget it!
    
    &gt;
    &gt; The effect of it was this -- Should you go into Munich to stay at three, and

    &gt; Christian to a draw.  I for one will be willing to leave Munich yours behind
    &gt; my lines providing I CAN in fact put it behind my lines.
    
    I am as good as useless if I am not allowed to keep the three fleets.  That
    means your choice is:  let me have Mun (and yank the A Mun in the Winter) or
    leave Den
    to fall to England.
    
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; The problem here is that I was counting on only losing one center to Turkey
    &gt; this turn, and its going to be two.  I'll still have a build, (I am one
    &gt; short now), which I was planning on sending through Munich to shore up
    &gt; defenses there.
    
    How can you be surprised that after you left Tun and Nap wide open, one of them
    fell?  Sigh.
     When you pulled out of the favorable situations you had regarding R/T, what
    were you thinking they'd do thereafter?  Fall flat on the ground in eternal
    gratitude to you for allowing them to live?
    
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Or do you think we should keep the army in place?
    
    No, if I have to make a second removal due to my not being allowed into Mun,
    both removals will be fleets.  Can I be any more clear?
    
    &gt;  If you only keep two
    &gt; units I think Denmark is going to fall, and once he can put a fleet in the
    &gt; Baltic I am going to be hard pressed to hold Berlin and Kiel.
    
    Actually, don't you expect Russian F Lvn to move to Baltic allied with England?
    
    &gt;
    &gt;  I can send Bohemia back into Munich, and then I don't think Christian will
    &gt; be able to crack Burgundy any time soon, infact,  re-taking paris wouldn't
    &gt; be out of the question.
    
    Send Boh back through Mun next Spring, and keep it moving to Bur that Fall.  If
    you keep Mun now, I yank fleets and don't bother to resist England any further.
    That's it.
    
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; You have the crucial northern fleets that Cal wouldn't provide -- that is
    &gt; why I am taking him down.
    
    We HAD Cal.  We HAD him, I don't care if the dead Frenchman thinks otherwise.
    We HAD Christian.  That convoy of your A Hol-Edi would have broken his back;
    I don't care if the dead Frenchman thinks otherwise.
      Doesn't anybody else GET it?

    Chris,
    I have NEVER had any aspirations in this game to be an army power, only a
    fleet power.  I am willing to just build fleets as we have discussed in the
    past.  With that being true, I feel we can both have a lot of fun and
    prosper.  My only request is we handle our relationship in a way that
    double-crossing (or rumored double-crosses by other double-crossers) are at
    a bare minimum.  The fleet / army border will serve us the best for that
    goal.  U can count on the f eas - ion order.

    For the Record:
    
    There certainly WAS a G/A alliance.  We had a really good thing going, and
    any difficulty I personally am experiencing -- and any prosperity enjoyed by
    R/E/T -- is a direct result of my abandonment of that alliance.
    
    Perhaps I mis-judged the situation, but I really did think that Paul --
    Germany -- had a better chance for a solo than I did.  Once I had made that
    judgement, I thought my course was clear -- move to prevent that, even if it
    cost me any chance at my own solo -- as it clearly has.
    
    The turning point?  Paul offered to convoy me from Holland to Edi, while I
    supported him into Warsaw.  In hindsight, this would have been a really cool
    thing to do, breaking both England and Germany's back at the same moment.
    But, as John has observed, I was with child at that point, and I didn't
    really think things all the way through.
    
    I don't think England, or ANYONE will be getting a solo out of this one.
    That was really the point when I stopped working with Paul.
    
    Thats my 2 bits!

    &gt;If you'd like to work towards that end, I am game.  Go take StPete with a
    &gt;fleet (north coast, need I say?)  Let me have Germany and Marsailles and The
    &gt;southern Russian home dots, and I'll let Turkey have all the coastal centers
    &gt;south of Venice/Trieste, and we can all go home happy.
    We큞l see. I will try to advance to Holland. Will I have your support? I am
    planning convoy Swe-Ska-Nth. I don't think paul will be moving Den-Swe...or
    at least I hope so. I hope you will cover Mun.
    
    &gt;"European WDC's are worth more than American ones" indeed!  ;)  Coming to
    &gt;Baltimore?
    I am trying to raise funds to go there. Unless I convince some obscure
    company to sponsor me I can't see me coming. Can't afford it with baby and
    everything...
    
    &gt;Oh, speaking of travel, there is a big Swing Dance camp in Herrang, Sweden,
    &gt;in July, and I am planning on coming!  Do you think there might be a little
    &gt;F2F action to be found in the whole of Sweden the 3rd week of July?
    The best thing you can do is mail to Stabbers@PoBox.se and ask politely. If
    you explain who you are I am sure someone will turn up to try to beat you.
    The address goes to the Swedish Diplomacy Mailinglist. There is really no
    reason for you to subscribe to the list (as it is in Swedish) but you can
    send a mail in English asking everyone to reply directly to your
    emailaddress and not to the listaddress.

    I have two units against Marseilles. There is no way i can retake Mar as

    Christian,
    
    Now, why did you have to go and spoil a perfectly good opportunity for us to
    work together by telling me this?
    
    &lt;&lt;We큞l see. I will try to advance to Holland. Will I have your support? I
    am
    planning convoy Swe-Ska-Nth. I don't think paul will be moving Den-Swe...or
    at least I hope so. I hope you will cover Mun.&gt;&gt;
    
    KNOWING that I am still talking to Paul, I can't possibly belive this.
    Clearly an attempt to get me to pass this along to him, and then take
    Denmark when he uses it to attack the north sea.  C'mon, give me a little
    credit here!
    
    
    No, for now, I think I will be helping Paul survive.  (See, there, I told
    you something true!)
    
    Once I have taken Russia down, then we can finish Paul off.

    Well, KNOWING you still talk to Paul this would test your will to work with
    me. Consider I do move Swe-Ska-Nth-Hol. The worst case scenario for me
    would be getting Holland and loosing Sweden. That would not be too bad as I
    would still have at least one build. However, if you want to work with me
    and don't tell Paul this I will manage to put up two builds and could
    heavily improve your chances of taking Cal down by sending fleets to StP.
    
    &gt;No, for now, I think I will be helping Paul survive.  (See, there, I told
    &gt;you something true!)
    As a matter of fact I DO BELIEVE YOU! *smile*
    
    &gt;Once I have taken Russia down, then we can finish Paul off.
    And this information is so obvious I don't even bother to tell Cal...:)

    I'm not sure why you'd want to go to Norway when Paul is threatening your

    2 steps forward, 1 back.
    
    Thoughts on next year?
    
    I would like to build 2 more fleets.  Chris has indicated he will transfer
    some more holdings (i.e. Tun and Rom) to me if I will build fleets and no
    armies.
    
    My biggest concern is Russia being overrun in the mean time.
    
    Chris also mentioned (for the umpteenth time) about me stabbing Russia and
    inviting me into Sev.
    
    If u think it wise I can build a fleet in bla and use it for defense of Sev
    and eventual reconquest of Rum.
    
    I DO NOT want to see u get overrun!!!!!!!!!

    Well, basically, it's like this. If you DON'T build an army and help me out
    by putting pressure on Serbia, I'm toast.  I believe I mentioned this last
    year when I pointed out that a Turkish army in Bulgaria is probably
    Austria's biggest fear.  Right now, he can stalemate me in Rumania because
    he will always have Serbia for support.  Why do you think he's so adamant
    about you sticking to fleets?
    
    It's up to you, but if you want to continue to have a Russian ally in
    existence, you're going to need to build some ground units to help me out.
