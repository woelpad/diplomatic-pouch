    Paul,
    I thought we were agreed? No? I still think we can arrange something good out of this. Convoy back from London to Belgium and use NTH to support that
    . Doing that hinders Austria from growing more than Mun and Ber. I cannot really see why you didn't go along whith what we agreed, but I guess you fe
    lt you could trust Austria. Please reconsider or Chris will have a dead sure solo (no matter what I choose to disband!).
    
    all the best

    Cal,
    Sorry. I really thought Paul was going to play with us this year. I guess he just threw the game to Chris (AGAIN!). Anyway, I will support you to StP
     if you want. This kind of play should be punished. I will only disband stalemate keeping units and keep all the Peul-defending ones. I really hate w
    hen people play like this, he does everything Chris says, get stabbed, trust Chris again, get stabbed...etc Argh!!!

    Chris,
    This season I will disband my southern units. If I were you I would move into position to cross the southern stalemate again. I will defend against P
    aul at all cost and hope that your armies around Mun/Ber will make a difference. I do not know what you tell Paul to make him trust you ten times as
    much as anyone else, I guess that압 why youre a world champ...:)

    Christian:  This is bizarre.  Chris once again did not do what we agreed that he would do, and went off on his own.  Yet, he didn't do the maximum am
    ount
    of
    damage that he COULD have done (i.e., taking Bre, keeping Mar).
     Yes, it appears that convoying A Lon-Bel supported by Nth is my safest course of action.    I can also block him from Kie and Mun, at least this
    
    turn.
     I will set up the board and get back to you.

    I agree with you about the punishment and I'll take you up on your offer of
    St Pete's.
    
    While I agree that Paul's play may have given the game to Chris, it's not
    necessarily so.  Chris's moves have given a lot more position and strength
    to Turkey and myself.  We MAY be able to stem the tide, so don't give up
    yet.  Looks like Paul is very soon to become a non-factor since he'll lose
    Mun, Ber & probably Hol this year.  If we can just make sure that we keep
    pressure on Chris, we may be able to stop this thing yet.

    Jeazus Cal!
    
    Give the man a break, willya?  Look at the board, and the moves -- if I had
    worked with him, I'd be in Spain, guaranteed portugal, and could keep
    Belgium for a net gain on one.  You wouldn't be in Warsaw, and Turkey for
    darn-tooten wouldn't be in Serbia!  With All y'all so hot to trot on
    stopping me, it made VERY good sense for him to work with me long enough to
    cripple england, especially with Christian's build in Liverpool.  I'll
    probably have to pull this turn, and I don't think Paul can be faulted for
    expecting me to continue to maximize my position rather than move towards
    balance.

    MiKaL,
    
    Actions speak louder than words, yes?  I believe that especially in the
    latter part of the game, and doubly so with a player who has entered the
    game, as it were, mid-stream.
    
    I moved this spring away from you, in the hopes that this could diffuse some
    of the obvious worries you have regarding our realive positions.
    
    My question for you is this:  Are there any conditions under which you would
    feel comfortable working with me?  I have given up my ambitions in the west,
    obviously, and while consolidating my position in Germany will be some help,
    I will probably have to Pull this year.   As I said, I am trying to secure a
    place in the 3 way that I see as the most likely end to this game.
    
    You said something about "the knife, fresh from my hand" or words to that
    effect, a while back.  I am curious if the fact that I have, indeed stabbed
    (guilty!) makes me unsuitable as an ally, in your eyes.
    
    Lets keep a dialogue open, in any case.

    I agree that there is a slight chance that we can stop AG. I am trying to
    convince Paul to defend himself, but I will support you to StP whatever
    he seems to be doing. Hopefully we get him to defend himself against
    Chris while you take StP. I guess you are not holding Warzaw, or do you
    think Chris is all-outing on G (Ber/Mun)?

    Paul,
    I hope Russia's taunting doesn't make you unwilling to work with me. I
    promise not to say anything not nice as long as we work together as in
    the beginning of the game...! I think we can use this situation to
    co-work and use the Russian/Austrian disagreement to our advance, we let
    R/T fight Austria while we defend Germany and move forward into Med and
    Italy. Maybe we can even force some parts of Russia if we stick together.
    By not sticking together Chris will be all over the place while you and I
    will have five hundred units around my centers fighting and guessing.
    What seems most fun? :)

    Christian,
    
    No, You're the world champ!  ;)  (There's an americanism "you da man! no YOU
    da man!)
    
    Do you think you can snag StPete?  Also, I am tempted to hold in Holland,
    expecting Paul to move Eng Chan -&gt; Bel, Den -&gt; Kiel.  Without centers to
    build in, we should be able to take him down.
    
    Sometime this season I lost all hope of getting a solo -- so I looked at who
    the best partners in a 3 way would be, and it was you and Russia or Turkey.
    I dont think Cal will ever work with me again, so I hope Turkey'll play
    ball!

    Dear Chris,
    
    I am most impressed by your play, even somewhat intimidated.  As far as
    stilettos, it seems most everyone in the game have an assorted collection of
    them, so I do not or would not hold that against u.
    
    The comment about pulling away, I am not sure what that means.  I see a
    fleet in ion and another in bul.  That is not pulling away, eh?
    
    I do not know what the German guy is doing beyond committing suicide.  I
    think he had a brain spasm last season.
    
    I never feel there is a game situation that would make one an "unsuitable
    ally", so ...
    
    I would enjoy an open dialog.
    
    If u r really interested in a draw, how about REALLY pulling back.  Being up
    in my face so much is most troubling.

    Mikal,
    
    Well, When I said pulling away, I meant I expected my moves to be pulling
    away from you!  Knowing you were goint to dislodge me from the Aegean, I had
    hoped to leave myself a retreat other than the Eastern Med -- hence the
    shift of forces north.
    
    Germany thought I was on board with him, since everyone else was against

    Spain, and held in Belgium, and defended in the Balkans -- he wouldn't look
    so foolish, would he?
    
    ok -- I am willing to "pull back"  do you have a suggestion as to how this
    could be best accomplished?  I would like to keep a fleet in Greece and a
    fleet in the Ionian to defend there.  How do you suggest that we go about
    doing this?  Seriously, whatever makes you comfortable, lets start from

    I think the level of illegal narcotics in this game is approaching dealer
    status!  &lt;G&gt;  Seriously though, it's finally nice to see a stab that goes
    after more than one centre.  Anyway, your timing certainly surprised
    everybody.  Personally, I would have waited until R/T were down further.  If
    you had, your pull-back form the west would have guaranteed you a spot in a
    3-way.  Your odds are probably still in the 90th percentile, but there are
    more variables now. We'll see.  I'm still amazed that Paul left himself so
    wide open. He'd been in a bad position since the short-lived A/G/R and now
    he's paid for it.
    
    Are you going to follow through with the stab?  Would seem like a
    vacillatory (is that a word?) waste if you don't.  Somebody is going to have
    to go down soon, your desire for "balance' notwithstanding and I'd like to
    see it be Germany.  Thoughts?

    &gt; Latest 3 dialogs between Austria and myself.  Any thoughts on how to
    exploit
    &gt; Austria, get a little advantage?  How should I respond to his latest
    query?
    &gt;
    &gt; Meef
    
    My best sugestion would be to play along with what he says, but tell him
    that you feel you need a "little room to grow and feel secure".
    Specifically, tell him you plan on keeping Serbia and want Bulgaria back.
    His reaction may tell you something about how serious he is.
    
    I'm just praying I can hang onto War and have England follow thru on his
    promise of support into St Pete's. Once we get ourselves both back into the
    5-6 centre range, we'll be a force to deal with instea of a couple of guys
    hanging on with their teeth.

    &gt; MiKaL,
    &gt;
    &gt; Actions speak louder than words, yes?  I believe that especially in the
    &gt; latter part of the game, and doubly so with a player who has entered the
    &gt; game, as it were, mid-stream.
    &gt;
    &gt; I moved this spring away from you, in the hopes that this could diffuse
    some
    &gt; of the obvious worries you have regarding our realive positions.
    &gt;
    &gt; My question for you is this:  Are there any conditions under which you
    would
    &gt; feel comfortable working with me?  I have given up my ambitions in the
    west,
    &gt; obviously, and while consolidating my position in Germany will be some
    help,
    &gt; I will probably have to Pull this year.   As I said, I am trying to secure
    a
    &gt; place in the 3 way that I see as the most likely end to this game.
    &gt;
    &gt; You said something about "the knife, fresh from my hand" or words to that
    &gt; effect, a while back.  I am curious if the fact that I have, indeed
    stabbed
    &gt; (guilty!) makes me unsuitable as an ally, in your eyes.
    &gt;
    &gt; Lets keep a dialogue open, in any case.
    &gt;
    &gt; Best,

    &gt;
    &gt; Dear Chris,
    &gt;
    &gt; I am most impressed by your play, even somewhat intimidated.  As far as
    &gt; stilettos, it seems most everyone in the game have an assorted collection
    of
    &gt; them, so I do not or would not hold that against u.
    &gt;
    &gt; The comment about pulling away, I am not sure what that means.  I see a
    &gt; fleet in ion and another in bul.  That is not pulling away, eh?
    &gt;
    &gt; I do not know what the German guy is doing beyond committing suicide.  I
    &gt; think he had a brain spasm last season.
    &gt;
    &gt; I never feel there is a game situation that would make one an "unsuitable
    &gt; ally", so ...
    &gt;
    &gt; I would enjoy an open dialog.
    &gt;
    &gt; If u r really interested in a draw, how about REALLY pulling back.  Being
    up
    &gt; in my face so much is most troubling.
    &gt;

    &gt; Mikal,
    &gt;
    &gt; Well, When I said pulling away, I meant I expected my moves to be pulling
    &gt; away from you!  Knowing you were goint to dislodge me from the Aegean, I
    had
    &gt; hoped to leave myself a retreat other than the Eastern Med -- hence the
    &gt; shift of forces north.
    &gt;
    &gt; Germany thought I was on board with him, since everyone else was against
    &gt; me -- and really, England left himself WIDE open.  just think if I had
    taken
    &gt; Spain, and held in Belgium, and defended in the Balkans -- he wouldn't
    look
    &gt; so foolish, would he?
    &gt;
    &gt; ok -- I am willing to "pull back"  do you have a suggestion as to how this
    &gt; could be best accomplished?  I would like to keep a fleet in Greece and a
    &gt; fleet in the Ionian to defend there.  How do you suggest that we go about
    &gt; doing this?  Seriously, whatever makes you comfortable, lets start from
    &gt; there.

    Bul(sc) can't support A Gal-Rum since it can't move there.  Just like a

    I think I'll take a chance and hold in Warsaw.  That way, even if I lose Rum

     The move towards Mos was just a "throwaway"; nothing else for it to do.
    I admit that the Austrian attack on me comes a big surprise, all the more so
    because
    it makes so little sense.  Is Chris trading his homeland for mine?  He can't
    build in
    MY dots!  All of a sudden, he leaves Mao and Mar, when he had a chance to take
    both Iberian dots.
     This just fries my brain.

    &gt; Paul,
    &gt; I hope Russia's taunting doesn't make you unwilling to work with me. I
    &gt; promise not to say anything not nice as long as we work together as in
    &gt; the beginning of the game...!
    
    Christian, I have just never been so baffled about someone's moves as I am
    about
    those Chris made.  Is he forsaking his homeland for mine?  He can't build in
    MY dots!  Why did he exchange the chance to take Spa/Por this turn for the
    promise of
    no gains in that area?  Why did he abandon War?
    
    &gt; I think we can use this situation to
    &gt; co-work and use the Russian/Austrian disagreement to our advance, we let
    &gt; R/T fight Austria while we defend Germany and move forward into Med and
    &gt; Italy. Maybe we can even force some parts of Russia.
    
    Well, I have to head back towards my homeland or I'll never see another build
    
    again.  There is no coherence to Chris' thinking, and now it has the rest of
    us just
    hissing and snarling.
    
    
    &gt;
    &gt; By not sticking together Chris will be all over the place while you and I
    &gt; will have five hundred units around my centers fighting and guessing.
    &gt; What seems most fun? :)
    
    Well, I was doing what seemed most fun but all the joy seems to have gone out
    of it!
     I'll convoy A Lon-Bel supported by F Nth, and I'll cover Kie with F Den.  My
    
    A Mar can support A Gas-Bur, while A Tyr tries for Vie (a long shot).
    
     Chris is no closer to winning this game than he was a turn ago; he's
    just swapping
    new dots for old.

    Chris:
     I keep looking and re-looking at your moves of last season, and I'm
    just baffled.
    Why are Ber/Mun worth so much more for you than Spa/Por?  Why did you
    walk
    away from your foothold in War?
     Trading your homeland for mine makes precious little sense; you
    can't build in MY dots!

    Paul,
    
    You wrote "Is he forsaking his homeland for mine?  He can't build in MY dots!"
    A bit further down you wrote "Well, I have to head back towards my homeland or I'll never see another build again."
    Maybe that is his point, he stops you from getting builds, he writes long letters to me begging me to keep the defence against you. Russia is telling
     me he migt work with Chris unless the game turns quickly and so forth.
    
    You also wrote that you will convoy A Lon-Bel supported by Nth. That is indeed good if you do. But don't promise it unless you are REALLY doing it. T
    hat would hurt our future chances to work together. If you are attackin me now, you could as well say it, since I cannot stop you from taking Lon & E
    di if you really want it. The problem is that you would not get any builds whatever the sc-count shows. Chris says he압 moving to Belgium. That would
     mean if you cover Kiel and move unsupported to Bel you loose Hol and cannot build in Kie, Mun or Ber. Puh?
    
    This season is really our last chance of doing something creative together. If we continue to fight this season (if I get one or more disbands) we wi
    ll be so crippled that we hardly can stop Chris. If Russia also turns to Chris side we are in really deep trouble.
    
    So, please work WITH me. But if you decide to take Lon & Edi, please let me know so that I know I can trust you in the future. A lie now would be unn
    essecary as I cannot stop you.

    A/R might already be halfway allied; didn't Chris pull out of Warsaw?  The big thing
    that we need Cal for is to continue (with Turkey) to attack Austria in his homeland.
    If Austria gets no more builds, he cannot win the game.  There it is.
    
    
    &gt; So, please work WITH me. But if you decide to take Lon & Edi, please let me know so that I know I can trust you in the future. A lie now would be u
    nn
    &gt; essecary as I cannot stop you.
    
    Okay.  The inclination now is to keep Lon, and send F Eng-Bel with Nth supporting.
    There is no way that I can afford to risk a bounce over Bel; that would give him both
    home countries!
     If I pick up Lon, Bel and Mar while losing Hol, Ber and Mun I break even.  Can
    I afford anything else?  Another removal will just make the Austrian takeover of
    Germany that much easier.
     I have decided upon moving A Tyr-Mun instead of to Vie; if Austria covers Vie
    with Gal, at least he cannot build there (although I cannot envision his building this
    season, anyway).
     You're right about the folly of my moving F Den-Kie for the same reason, but I
    don't see myself getting a build this turn anyway.  That one is up in the air.
     A Gas-Bur makes sense; I have to position myself for a fight to regain Mun.
     What to do with A StP is... a puzzle.  Moving to Mos won't work; neither will
    going to Nwy.  Seeing as how Russia has a solid grip on War, a move to Lvn would
    be wasting time.  I guess holding in StP is the only option.
    
     Okay, the above represents my true thinking at this point.

    Paul,
    
    Good to haer you telling me real intentions. You tell me you need London
    to not disband. OK, you don't want to disband, I understand that. I don't
    either want to disband. I have a plan.
    
    You are telling me that StP has nothing interesting to do. You will hold
    it. So let me take StP with Finland. That means you go minus one sc thsi
    year, and you can disband A Lvn. An army you have told me you cannot use
    anyway. By doing this I don't have to disband some southern fleet and you
    don't have to disband any important unit AND *WE* still keep StP. The
    option of course is that you convoy out of Lon and get to keep StP and
    disband it in winter, but that way we loose position in Russia. A trade,
    London for StP, isn't that fair? But maybe you prefer to leave London,as
    you might wanna have an Army in Belgium rather than a fleet. Think of
    coming seasons, an Army i Bel is far more usable against armies in your
    homesenter area. But, if you stay in Lon you can convoy back to Hol
    supported by F Bel next spring...If I move as I tell you maybe you can
    consider leaving London open next year with my promise of not recapturing
    it. You see, I get a bit paranoid having a foreign army on my Island...:)
    
    Oh, much written and probably it didn't make sense either. I canot really

    Since Austria didn't expect to lose War or Ser, he would have had two builds
    (at least) from Ber & Mun and his homeland would have been defended just
    fine, thank you.

    He's pretty familiar with the history of the game, thanks to me, and he's

    As a matter of fact, this makes sense.  You can hold StP far easier than I

    and I have no prospects for advancing my A StP anyway.  Okay, I'll move A
    StP-Lvn this turn, and disband it in the winter.

    A convoy from Lon-Hol next Spring (supported by Bel) is a definite option.  I
    like
    the idea of both taking Hol back in the Spring and moving A Bel-Ruhr in the
    Fall;
    both strengthen my chances of retaking a home dot or two.

    &gt; &gt; Might Sultan:
    &gt; &gt;      The move towards Mos was just a "throwaway"; nothing else for it to
    &gt; do.
    &gt;
    &gt; And of course, you had no expectations whatsoever that there would be
    &gt; support from Warsaw with Galicia cutting Ukrainian support? I know the kind
    &gt; of things Chris promises...
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Since Austria didn't expect to lose War or Ser, he would have had two builds
    &gt; (at least) from Ber & Mun and his homeland would have been defended just
    &gt; fine, thank you.
    &gt;
    &gt; Well, you guys can support one or another into Bud as well and it wouldn't
    &gt; break my heart.
    
     Christian and I are coming to an understanding at long last (I have more
    incentive to do so nowadays) and I am finally deadset against Austria (have I
    said that before?).  He's delivered two strikes over the plate, and I'm damned
    if I'm going to
    miss knocking that third one outa here....
     No, I'm not moving A StP to Mos anymore.

    Paul,
    
    Hhhhhhhhm.  It was a really, really tough call.  I ran through the scenarios
    literally dozens of times, and it came down to this -- England would crack
    MUCH faster than R/T.  (and people accuse YOU of trusting ME!  Why hasn't
    anyone said anything about Chirstian's posture!  He'dve been down to Scandia
    and Liverpool if we'd stuck together!)  Once england was down, you'd have a
    VERY easy time rolling over my positions in Spain/portugal, giving you 16
    centers, 17 counting st Pete, and you are asking for my support into
    Moscow -- 18.
    
    
    Maybe I made the right move to soon -- You almost certainly would have
    played it straight with me for another year or two.  But with the builds
    you'd get for London/Edi/Marsailles, you certainly wouldn't have left
    yourself defenseless.
    
    So, as I said in my broadcast, this is a move towards balance for me -- I
    will almost certainly have to pull, and where and how I do that is going to
    be another Hard decision to make.
    
    If my position doesn't look great now, look at what it would have been if I
    had followed your plan -- without really good guessing on my part, I think
    it would have been worse.
    
    We shall see.  I was sincere when I said that you have been the best ally of
    the game, and its one of the twists of the game that I then stabbed you --
    and pulled back at the same time.  I almost moved to Brest as well, just to
    go all out -- but it didn't make any sense to have that fleet end up in
    Belgium, fer ghods sake.
    
    That was my thinking.
    
    With England down, there was no way to balance your power.  Possibly
    pre-mature, but that's the folly of the young player, mis-judging threats.
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Chris,
    
    StP will not be German after this year unless Russia wants it that way.
    
    I think the Spain-Prortugal [sic!] thing sounds a bit too risky at the
    moment. I will hold and support myself, because that way you and Germany
    has to co-operate to take my poor little Iberian dots. If I see you
    moving in a satisfying way I will no doubt consider a similar move next
    turn.

    I thought it was Thomas who was the doubter!  You seriously think Paul and I
    are going to work together at this late date?   ;)
    
    Ok,  I was thinking that with one unit of yours and one unit of mine you
    could hold the Iberian dots indefinitely --- but, maybe you're right, no
    reason for him NOT to support Gascony to Spain, and I kinda do need that
    army in piedmont.  No problem!

    Cal,
    
    I was pondering. Maybe it is ok with you if I take StP from Germany? By
    doing that I only have to disband one, and can still keep him out of
    Iberia. As I see the board you will grow one sc anyway, without StP.
    
    If you feel that my suggestion is a bad one, I will still support you in.
    The important thing for me now is that Germany looses StP and that you
    and I are friendly. But, as I said, it would be superb if I could borrow
    StP for this year, and then you can take it back next year. Please?

    &gt;all the best
    
    I spent quite a few hours thinking over this suggestion and I decided that
    I'm still going to ask you to support me in to St Pete's.  Here are my
    reasons:
    
    1) As a three centre power (keeping Warsaw is by no means guaranteed), my
    very survival is hanging by a thread. Obviously, I need some growth fast.
    If I only get a single build, well, four centres is still pretty tenuous.
    
    2) I think we're pretty much in agreement that Austria is the one we want to
    knock down next and I'm in a more dangerous position with regards to the
    "enemy".
    
    3) As with point #2, you have a bit of breathing space with which you can
    regroup and look for another centre.  For obvious reasons, Germany will have
    little choice this turn but to turn and face Austria which means that you
    aren't likely to be threatened this year. I'm going to be hanging on by my
    fingernails.
    
    In case you're not convinced that I'm threatened by Austria, let me point
    out that Chris hasn't even bothered to lie to me this turn (VERY unusual), a
    sure sign that even HE expects us to continue our hostilities.
    
    In short, I tried to find reasons to let you have St Pete's that made sense
    from both our points of view, but I couldn't.  I will however, be more than
    happy to help you against Germany when that time comes (I'm sure it will if
    for no other reason than to make sure Austria doesn't get ALL the German
    centres).
    
    So, in light of this, are we still okay with my move to St Pete and your
    support thereof?

    &lt;&lt;Seriously though, it's finally nice to see a stab that goes
    after more than one centre.  Anyway, your timing certainly surprised
    everybody.  Personally, I would have waited until R/T were down further.  If
    you had, your pull-back form the west would have guaranteed you a spot in a
    3-way.  Your odds are probably still in the 90th percentile, but there are
    more variables now. We'll see.  I'm still amazed that Paul left himself so
    wide open. He'd been in a bad position since the short-lived A/G/R and now
    he's paid for it.&gt;&gt;
    
    Sorry to be so long getting back to you -- the Flu really laid me out.
    
    My thinking was that Paul wouldn't ever be so vulnerable again, and that I
    can hopefully recoup my position as his falls apart.
    
    The Turk.  always the Turk.  Do you want to see him build, even if it is off
    of me?  I always told you I'd walk out of Warsaw and start on with the
    Germans, if you were interested.  Any chance we can go back to Turk stuffing
    at this point?

    &gt;My thinking was that Paul wouldn't ever be so vulnerable again, and that I

    Tactically, your moves were fine, it's just the overall strategic timing
    could have been better.  Ah well, it's always tough to balance the two,
    isn't it?
    
    &gt;The Turk.  always the Turk.  Do you want to see him build, even if it is

    Not really.  Turkey's presence and fleet-building ability are needed to keep
    you from winning.  I'd be willing to help you against Germany if you want
    (although right now, that would probably be limited to talking to England
    more than any direct military intervention), but obviously, Warsaw would be
    the price...  Until then, I'll just have to keep plugging away trying to
    recover my four little, much-abused, home centres.

    Hmm, Turkey's fleet building ability, hey?  I hadn't thought of it that way,

    Warsaw is yours for the nonce, mi amigo -- I may try to take it from you
    again, but I can't really see what would be the point, if and-when.

    Good guesses!  I had hoped that Christian might cut your support in the
    north sea, but I had figured you to not attack Edi.  Why not convoy from
    london to Belgium, for greater diplomatic effect?
    
    Alas, I don't build, and you dont' pull.  this is going to be a mean fight,
    if we go through with it.  Yuk.  Cal back at 5!  How did THAT happen?  At
    least Turkey's bud got nipped.  At least THAT went well for me.
    
    Ok, so, I am looking at the situatioin -- could we back off from each other,
    I to go after Russia again, you to finish off an un-suspecting England.
    With the Turkish Threat down, I think I might actually be able to swing it.
    
    Well, anyway, lets look at it.  Its a new board, and I am not the type of
    player to force a bad position forward -- I feel that we are more in balance
    now than we were, anyway.  I was too early in France, alas.

    &gt; Paul,
    &gt;
    &gt; ?well, I think you are quite right.  If I backed off of you, where would I
    &gt; go?  It is why I haven't tried to come up with any sort of plan for working
    &gt; things out -- we will have to have some shakedowns and see where we stand
    &gt; before you and I can work together in this game I think!   We may end up
    &gt; allying to stop an R/T!  ;(
    &gt;
    &gt; Stay healthy, anyway.  This flu that laid me out is a bear.  It took me a
    &gt; week to recover, and I still ain't really.
    
    My version of the flu was the 24 hour variety-- pukes, shakes-- on Christmas
    day!
    It gave me an excuse to skip a "family reunion" type party, which I always
    dread.
    
    Paul

    &gt;
    &gt; Best,
    &gt;

    Cal,
    
    Well, a set back for me.  A leap forward for you.  We net one though.

    Yeah, but this coming year, we'll make it a priority to get you at least one
    build.
    
    Got a note from Austria addressed to England and I.  He's getting scared and
    he wants E/R to agree to eliminate G/T and settle on a three way.  I haven't
    responded, but, needless to say, I'm not interested.  Austria's position is
    too vulnerable to guarantee him a three-way.
    
    Talk to you later,
    
    Cal

    &gt; It's been a good, long hard fought game, but I think it's about played
    out.
    &gt; I can't get 18 anymore, not since I backed out of the Atlantic.
    &gt;
    &gt; Can we agree to eliminate Germany and Turkey, and call it a three way?  If
    &gt; we all work together, It shouldn't be too hard to do -- I am content to
    hang
    &gt; at 12 centers or so, I don't want to get up to like 15 where I'd be a
    &gt; problem.
    &gt;
    &gt; Gentlemen, what are your thoughts?
    
    I would be willing to help you against Germany but, as I've said before,
    Turkey is my "insurance policy" against Austrian aggression and I won't
    willingly see him go down.  Mind you I'm not fanatical that he be in the
    draw or anything, but I'm just not willing to attack him.
    
    Um, I should ask, is this game DIAS?
    
    There's still a bit of play here yet and I don't think it will be as easy
    for you to eliminate Germany as you think. We'll see how it plays out.
    
    Christian?

    Chris, Cal,
    
    I will for obvious reasons try to defend myself against Germany now and not move further into the Med-area. If Germany goes down I will be happy abou
    t it. Whether you two wants to take T out is not my concern right now...
