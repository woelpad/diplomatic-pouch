    &gt; &gt; Well, if he builds another fleet Tri this Winter all is not lost.  I'm
    going on
    &gt; &gt; the
    &gt; &gt; assumption that if E/A are to be allied vs G, I'm as good as gone
    anyway... so I
    &gt; &gt; will
    &gt; &gt; move under the assumption that this is NOT the case, and will hope for
    the best.
    
    Well, he DID build the fleet so I guess we can keep working with him.  I'm
    still not convinced that he didn't take Munich on purpose and expect to talk
    his way out of it.  Anyway, we still have little choice but to work with
    him.
    
    &gt; &gt;      Perhaps a bit of good can come out of this.  England might think
    that
    &gt; &gt; Austria is
    &gt; &gt; his ally against me, and might tell Chris about his planned moves.
    Chris can
    &gt; &gt; pass
    &gt; &gt; them on to us and we can make our own moves that much more effective.
    &gt; &gt;      But jeez, I wish that I was making a fleet build!
    
    Me too.  As much as I need him to put some pressure on Turkey, England is
    the bigger long term threat.
    
    Anyway, we'll see what comes of the negotiating this turn.

    &gt; Message from prosit@execpc.com as Germany to Austria and Russia in
    'ruffians':
    
    &gt; Hi guys:
    &gt;      Chris, if you are serious about vacating Mun for my A Sil to go
    &gt; there, why not
    &gt; send A Mun- Ruhr?  Once England has fleets in Eng and Nth, it could
    &gt; support my  A Bel, or bounce Bel over Hol.
    
    This sounds like it might be a good idea.
    
    &gt;      The Austrian A Gal might be a big help to Russia if it moves to Ukr
    &gt; this Spring.
    &gt; Cal might need the help in re-capturing Sev.
    
    This would be okay as well.  I'd like to be able to send War-Lvn this turn
    so I can hold up the fall of St Pete's for one (or more) season(s).
    
    &gt;      But Cal's big problem might be if Turkey sends A Sev-Mos, to cut
    &gt; Russian
    &gt; support for his A StP (far be it from me to mention this to Cyrilles,
    &gt; but Christian
    &gt; may have no such scruples).
    
    I doubt if Cyrille is even reading his mail at this point. If he had the
    slightest interest in this game or the slightest desire to negotiate, I'd
    try to talk him into moving through the Med to fend off the English navy.
    But he doesn't, so we take him out even if it means England gaining ground.
    Chris, what and how many units are you going to commit to the Turkish
    downfall?
    
    Comments, guys?

    John,
    
    I cannot believe this.  Heheheheh.  Its quite amusing.  He doesn't really
    belive that 18 centers can call a draw, not including the other half of the
    board, does he?  Well, I certainly am not going to draw his attention to it!
    
    He wrote me, btw, and promised not to move into the Westmed.
    
    Well, I am not certain that Germany can kick me out now, even if he wants
    to.  We shall see.

    Cal,
    
    Ok, I have built the fleet, and as you say, the real question is how many
    resources I can devote to taking down Cyrille.
    
    I think you are right about his not replying to mail -- he has missed every
    deadline since the stab.  His tactics, however, are not in doubt, and he
    might get back to Five if we aren't careful!
    
    He has a supported attack on Bulgaria, and a supported attack on Rumania,
    while you only have a supported attack on Sev, and no guarantee that it
    would work.  Also, I doubt you are willing to risk St Pete to Christians
    certain attack.  So what do you do if you are Cyrrile?
    
    Either:
    
    Sev -&gt; Rum, Black sea Supports
    Aeg -&gt; Bul, con Supports
    
    OR:
    
    Aeg -&gt; Bul, con and black support
    Sev -&gt; Rum (Sev -&gt; Moscow?)
    
    These can both be defended against, but they need our full attention to do
    so.  if Rum is dislodged now, it retreats to Bud (not a REAL problem, but
    hardly a cause for Joy!
    
    That fleet in trieste is going to be the fatal blow to Turkey, I feel sure
    of it.  With Germany in the fight against England, I am not so worried about
    locking up the Med -- The Ionian would be a place he could be stopped, I
    think.
    
    Christian is nothing if not predictable -- slow but steady seems to be his
    motto.  If you don't support StPete in the Spring, he will take it.  How do
    you want to handle this?
    
    Just some random thoughts here, I guess I haven't come up with a tangible or
    workable plan as yet -- I guess I should whack Roland for certain this year,
    just so he can't cause any more trouble, ever.  That'll slow down the
    assault of Turkey a little but not too much.  Maybe we can work some kind of
    rotation, where you move into Greece, I move into Rum?
    
    Let me know your thoughts,
    
    Chris
    
    
</pre><p><a name=8></a><b>Message from  <FONT COLOR="ff0000">Austria</FONT> to <FONT COLOR="bbbb00">Turkey</FONT> in 'ruffians':

    Cyrille,
    
    I am sorry if you feel that no one will diplome with you -- I thought you
    were no longer interested in the game, and so I left you alone rather than
    communicating.
    
    However, your play has continued in such a fashion that I am convinced you
    DO care about the game -- or at least, in holding up your honor.
    
    I don't think there is a way that we can work together that you would trust,
    but I am open to suggestions.  I just put the hammer on Roland because he
    wouldn't help me when I asked for it.  That is really what I want, someone
    who is willing to help me out, and not demand that I help them.  If we
    wanted to stab Russia now, obviously we are in an excellend position to do
    so, but Cal is working with me.
    
    When we stabbed you, he was supposed to support my army into Bulgaria --
    taking you down to 3 centers.  Greece would have been free to head into the
    Aegean, and all would have been lost for you, I think.  But Cal went into
    the hospital at about that time, and screwed the order up.  hence our
    current stalemate, where i have to send that damn fleet I just built to try
    to invade you instead of using Fleet Greece!
    
    So, let me know if there is any way that we can work together, or if you
    just want to taunt me, or help me against England, or whatever.  I don't
    have a grudge, I just saw us as honorable opponents.
    
    All the best!
    
    Chris

    Defensive, yeah, and I don't get a unit into Livonia, but our options are
    limited by Cyrille's position.

    I just hope he takes it slow.  If *I* were him, I'd be pushing fleets
    through the Med as fast as I could and into every possible open crevice.

    That's an interesting idea and a good one.  It will free up a fleet that you
    can use against Turkey without messing up the centre count.  Oh, and yes,
    you should take Italy out.  I'm sure England will try to take France out as
    well, just to clean up the area.

    I'm gonna need some help w.r.t. Tunis. He can muscle his way in if he wants
    by forcing WES and then supporting himself to NAF and positioning for GOL. I
    can stall for two seasons, but if he makes an all-out try I cannot stall for
    3 seasons with a Austrian fleet to back me up (or a Turkish fleet for that
    matter...perhaps there is not time to get Turkey elimianted before the
    English grow too big)

    Turkey loses one for certain, and while that move to the Ionian was

    Sev is a lock now -- Moscow moves in with Ukraine and Rum supporting.
    Whichever unit he pulls, he loses.  Next year Bulgaria is secure, and I can
    support myself into the Aegean, and it's goodby constantinople.

     Let's see.  Russia can try War-S-Lvn-StP, while I try A Den-Swe and F Hel-
    Den.  English F Balt can take Ber or cover Swe; F Nwy can support his A StP or
    cover Swe and leave StP undefended.  My A Mun can bounce Austrian A Ruhr over
    Kiel, ensuring that Kie is open for my Winter fleet build.  This way, I should

    Guys, the bounce in Spain was made in anticipation of England's moving  F
    Spa(sc)
    to Gol and F Por-Spa.  I wanted to strand F Por in place before I tried for a
    serious
    attack on Spain.  With his choice to support Spain, the whole exercise was moot
    anyway.  This turn, I can safely try A Mar-S-Gas-Spa (forcing England to stand
    still again in Iberia).  The only sure move for Christian will be F Lon-Nth,
    supported this time by F Nwg; it might be too late for him to save much of
    Scandin-
    avia!
    
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Cal,
    &gt;
    &gt; Sev is a lock now -- Moscow moves in with Ukraine and Rum supporting.
    &gt; Whichever unit he pulls, he loses.  Next year Bulgaria is secure, and I can
    &gt; support myself into the Aegean, and it's goodby constantinople.
    &gt;
    &gt; Thoughts, gentlemen?  Where do you want that Ruhr unit to go, Paul?  A
    &gt; Bounce in Kiel?  no need for the bounce in Holland at this point.  Cal --
    &gt; same supports for one more season?
    &gt;
    &gt; Chris
