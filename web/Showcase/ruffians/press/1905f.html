    Greetings!
    
    For this turn I suggest the following:
    
    F Tys - Nap
    A Tun - Gre
    F Ion C A Tun - Gre
    F Aeg S A Tun - Gre
    F Bul(sc) S A Tun - Gre
    
    This way I get Gre and you might get Nap. If not I can build in Nap.
    
    Ok?

    Chris, I'm quite busy at the moment. But you must understand that I
    want to ensure that Italy (and his fleet that you graciously ask him
    to send in Aegean:-) ) will not move against me. Now, I'm quite sure of what
    he'll do. I will support you in Greece, while you let me take
    Naples, and cut the support of Rum (maybe you'll even get there). Sorry, but
    the inconvenient of PBM games is here : you said last time that you'd no
    time to talk, so couldn't help me and as I don't see you, I don't know if it
    was true, or if you just wanted to let me wait. Now, I ask for a sign of
    truth. Is Russia really your former (and not current) ally?

    Cyrille,
    
    Yes, I am through with Cal -- he has given up on this game, and would be a
    terrible ally.  I will support you into Naples, and attack Rumania
    again. --- this is what you want, yes?

    I'm feeling really bad about how the Judge ruined the game for you.
    I have looked bad at the particular move where you wanted to go to
    Bulgaria and I think that would have made a significant difference in
    the position.  (Yes, a 2-SC turnaround, in fact).
    
    I appreciate your willingness to stick with the game.  My only
    consolation is that this is merely a demo game and not a tournament
    game.  My problem at the time was that I did not have any confirmation
    that you had changed your orders, and I did not feel that I could
    rollback without a confirmation.
    
    I write this letter so it will show up in the record when it
    eventually comes out.

    p.s. I've noticed the Pouchtoo web page is finally on display at the
    Pouch.  I need to make a more general announcement.

    Cyrille,
    
    Anything else we need to discuss?  Germany wrote and offered to send some
    armies east to help "the russian situation"  I told him to forget it, but he
    should be moving our way soon, and I expect England in the Med next year.
    
    Do you need Rumania's support cut again?  I so, no problem, that is the
    order as it stands, but if you don't, then I'd like to cover Serbia,
    
    Best,

    I appreciate the note, Rick.  I just want to reiterate the fact that I know
    it wasn't anything you could have prevented or rectified as GM.  When the
    turn processed with the old orders and I had no proof of my amended moves, I
    knew you wouldn't be able to replay the turn.  The blame, such as it is, is
    entirely on the FROG Judge.
    
    Thanks again,

     Well, I got Brest anyway....  I will build an army in Ber, and move

     My plan for France is simple; to support myself back into Gas and

    fine with me, but did you HAVE to move another fleet to Nth?  All this

    Don't be nervous. The fleet will be going straight to ENG or London if I

    to be defending against your enemy Austria. We have worked this out fine,
    he doesn't move to Stp and everything is happy. You and I can force StP
    sooner or later if we want to.

    Cal,
    
    Well!  That went well!  Again, apologies for the support being cut last
    season, but there you go.  Back in the saddle and all that.
    
    I think it might be a good time to set the board up -- do you have Diplo?
    (Its a computer program which adjudiactes the game, very useful tool for the
    e-dipper!)
    
    The question is what do we build now?  Cyrille's support of Italy is the
    last straw -- I could've bounced him from naples, didn't, and this is the
    thanks I get?  So the south is a problem, but he is badly out of position,
    and I can take Naples from him this year, which will hurt him more.  You can
    take Sev back, and I think Should!  That leaves Cyrille at 3, and hopefully
    he wont get any more.
    
    I would've liked to build a fleet -- someone down here is going to have to
    soon!  France's 2 unit combo, supported by Italy in Marsaille, will be tough
    to crack, but it'll fall eventually if I dont get to the Westmed/North
    Africa.  With Cyrille retreating to Galicia (almost Certainly, don't you
    think?) I have to build A Vienna -- I have wasted a lot of time with that
    unit that is now in Serbia -- Although I COULD use it to take Bulgaria now,
    I think I'd better head back north with it.  I Almost moved to Galicia, but
    decided the chance of Turkish treachery was too great.
    
    So you build either Army or Fleet StPete.  Boy, a fleet NC would really ruin
    England's day -- but you have no support to back it up.  F SC is a good
    anti-german move, and there you have some support.  An Army might be the
    thing, it can go either way, and another army against germany is certainly
    going to be necessary soon or late.
    
    Let me knw what you think about all this -- I think this game still has a
    lot of play to it!

    Nice try Chum.  I give you one last chance -- disband the army which is
    retreating from Warsaw, and re-build it as a fleet.  If you do this, you and
    I can easily stop the English.  if you don't, you will lose Naples and Sev
    next year, and to heck with the English, I am going to make sure you aren't
    in my rear to screw me up AGAIN.  That support was a really bad move.  As if
    I would let it succeed.  ;)
    
    Seriously, are you trying to play for part of a 3 way draw?  there is no way
    you can get to the 13 center stalemate line before Germany is across it --
    without my help!
    
    So this is it -- if you don't disband that army during retreats, I will be
    coming after you with everything I have.  I have Russia on board -- he is
    willing to let you KEEP sev if you do what I suggest.  You make the call --
    a 3 center Italian ally (maybe -- I wonder if he wants to keep Marseilles?
    I wonder if He'd like Naples back?), and two big enemies who have much
    better position, or a 3 way alliance dedicated to stopping E/G -- you'll get
    Bulgaria back, and Tunis in the deal -- then I can concentrate on the German
    front.
    
    You make the call!
    
    Best,

    Hey Roland!
    
    Well, I think we both came out ok in that last exchange, but any more games
    and we're both going to be in trouble.  I have an interest in keeping you in
    Marsaille, and you have an interest in keeping Bulgaria.  If we can work
    together -- if you will trust me to follow my own best interest -- then we
    can both gain.
    
    In short, I want to put the hurt on Cyrille.  He has done me wrong every
    season since he took over Turkey, and I have had enough.  We have had our
    differences, but I think that now we should put them aside.
    
    Retreat to the Eastern med.  That gives us FOUR units on turkey.  if you
    will  retreat to the Eastern med, we should be able to take Turkey down
    fast.
    
    I have been trying to convince cyrille that England is a real threat -- and
    that he should build fleets to stop him -- but he gives me this kind of hard
    time instead.  I can't build fleets fast enough, and besides I need to stop
    Germany in Tyrolia/bohemia.  So, I would like to get you back in the game --
    to build the fleets we will need to blockade the Med.
    
    If you will do this -- and I realize that you'll be taking a chance, and you
    have options where you can keep fighting me -- then I will convoy your army
    in Tunis back to Naples.  You will need to disband the fleet in Bulgaria,
    but I can move my army Serbia in.  Naples will keep you at Three, and then
    you;ll start getting builds from Turkey.
    
    Yes, I could betray you, but not and Keep England out of the Med.  that has
    to be at the top of my list -- there is nothing else stoping him!
    
    Think about it, Roland -- I can only keep Marsaille alive so long before I
    will have to commit that unit to defense.
    
    Let me know.

    You are right about the English threat. And also Germany is a big threat.
    Especially if he manages to grab centers while England do not.
    
    And I could work with you. However, you have to show me that you want it
    first. You have taken my homeland and thrown me out of Ion. If you help me
    keep Mar and give me Nap back, I might consider helping you with Turkey.

    Chris, it was the first time I play with you, and nearly
    my first email game. Maybe my style of play is not good
    in PBM games, but I can say, and many other players would
    agree, that I nearly never lie. I just try to influence my
    allies' moves in my way. About you, you lie to me many
    times, and the real turn I needed your help, you don't
    answer to me, arguing you were too busy. I always try to
    play with an ally. Arriving late in the game, I try to play
    with you. It was a mistake. Now, England is your problem,
    and as I already have 3 fleets, I must think that the only
    way you ask me for one more fleet is to grab me faster, not
    to stop him. Thanks for the attention, and good luck in
    the game.

    Well, it seems that you had an agreement in the North with
    England. Now, you'll have to choose between A and E. I just
    want to say that I know Christian, and he is more trustable,
    according to me. he is a good tactician, and play with it
    of course but, as I saw Chris lying, at least on one little
    point, every turn, you'd better choose him. I rereat in
    Galicia, but be sure that I'll have other things to do
    than moving against you. If you've got any idea, don't
    hesitate to ask me. I really needed one ally, and as it
    seems you and Chris were not interested, I try Italy, even
    if he was quite weak. It fakes, now I'll defend the best I can.
    But, as you see, I achieve his plan, even if it was less
    sure than taking Greece with the fleet, as I ask him to.
    Chris is quite weak in his home country, with more armies in
    Italy. Depending on his build, we could consider an attack
    of your armies over Galicia, and I'll retreat where I can.
    Or we could attack Budapest, or whatever you think. Anyway,
    with our numerous armies, there will be a great chance of gain.
    Whatever happens, I'll let you Sev, convoying my army back.
    Tell me what you think. If you prefer go with Austria, I
    understand. Anyway, the 2 months of vacancy, added to the start
    of the WorldEmailDip Tournament, and my new job, are enough
    occupate my time, so I'll resign this game.

    Well, I guess it's not just me who should check the game more often.  I'm
    not going to get any builds here as I'm still at four: war, stp, mos, rum.
    IF I can
    get Sev back and not lose Rum (you can help me with that), I can build and
    maybe get back into the game a little.
    
    &gt; I would've liked to build a fleet -- someone down here is going to

    I think you could probably help me with it by supporting me into Bul this
    turn.  That's one way to make sure I get a build whether or not I lose
    rum/gain sev.  Yes, I do think Gal is a certainty and that we do need to be
    concerned about E/G.  With you not able to trust or work with I or T, you're
    going to need my help, not to mention St Pete's as a building spot.  We'll
    see what plays out this Winter, but I think you're going to have to help me
    get re-established if you want to have any chance of stopping E/G.
    
    Yeah, I'm still pissed off, but I guess I may as well get back in the game
    mentally as well as physically.
    
    &gt; I think I'd better head back north with it.  I Almost moved to
    Galicia,
    but
    &gt; decided the chance of Turkish treachery was too great.
    
    
    Understandable.

    &gt; Quiet?  anything but!  Look at me, no allies and enemies all around!
    
    You get what you pay for....
    
    This should be over quick!
    
    I'll try to help out to make that prediction come true!
    
    What was up with F Denmark -&gt; keil, anyway?
    
      England wants to keep my only fleet pinned where it can do no harm to him.
    
    I'd rather see him invite my F Kiel-Den in the Spring, and then dislodge it in
    the
    Fall.  That way I could rebuild it as an army and use it against you!

    Cyrille,
    
    You would not be in Sev without my help.  I could have simply supported Cal
    to hold, and you would not have gotten in.  Right away, you support an
    Italian attack on Greece -- when you said you support me to hold.
    
    If we can't work together, then E/G will win this game.  I would LOVE to
    have us work together to fight them -- Ok, how about this -- you don't think
    you need another fleet, fine -- between us we do have 5.  How about you
    retreat to Silesia, or Prussia?  That would be more useful than a new fleet,
    and a good sign of trust.
    
    I am going to write now to you and Cal and suggest this.

    Gentlemen,
    
    The three of us have been sparring around for years now, and none the better
    for it.  France is almost dead, and E/G are getting ready to send their
    forces against us.
    
    If we are to have any chance to stop them, we are going to have to work
    together, and it is going to be hard.  Cyrille and I have a bad history of
    not doing what we are saying, and I have just cost Cal Sev, through cutting
    support.  So we have reasons to not work together.
    
    On the other hand, we have 13 reasons to work together -- That is the number
    of English and German units.  Germany wrote me today to taunt me --
    
    &lt;&lt;I'd rather see him invite my F Kiel-Den in the Spring, and then dislodge
    it in
    the Fall.  That way I could rebuild it as an army and use it against you!&gt;&gt;
    
    That was a broadcast, so you both saw that, right?  There is no question
    that alliance is strong, and coming after us right now.
    
    What I would like to propose is this -- A 3 way coalition to stop them.  We
    need to put armies in Silesia, Prussia, Bohemia, and Tyrolia, and fleets in
    the Westmed and Gulf of Lyon.  Ideally we should start some pressure up
    north as well.
    
    This is probably our last chance to pull this off.  Cyrille, you are in the
    drivers seat on this one.  If you retreat to Galicia, then Cal and I are
    going to have to take the time to try and fight you, and when we do, Germany
    is going to be all over us.  I have suggested that you retreat off the
    board, and re-build another fleet -- you seem to think this will weaken your
    overall position, which I don't agree with, but whatever -- a retreat to
    Silesia or Prussia accomplishes the same thing for us -- it delays Germany.
    
    Further, I'd like to suggest that Cyrille, you take Bulgaria and give up
    Sevastapol, so that Cal can build a fleet in the north, something neither of
    us can do.  However you want to arrange that is fine with me.
    
    I really do think this moment here is the turning point of the game.  As Ben
    Franklin said, if we don't hang together, we will all hang separately!
    
    Cal, I hope that you are game for this, as fighting Turkey and Germany at
    the same time would be a real pain, and I don't think we can trust St Pete
    to stay open for more than one year without England coming back for it.
    
    Cyrille, I am sincere in this.  I have tried to keep the faith with you, and
    I am sorry that you felt I ignored you when you needed my communication.  As
    you know, my wife is very pregnant, and I have traveled on business 5 out of
    the last 6 weekends.  It has been hard to give this game the attention it
    deserves.
    
    Please, gentlemen, let me know.

    Well, it's like this.  The screwup in the FROG Judge cost me any chance to

    now, I am doing that by throwing my forces at Cyrille as hard as I can.
    This is because I consider him to be the one who didn't keep his word.  I
    know Cyrille disagrees with that very much but I don't particularly care,
    it's what *I* believe.  Therefore, I would be quite happy merely doing my
    best to keep him from winning and the hell with anything else.
    
    However, and I also don't much care if I am believed in this, I will give it
    ONE more try to make this a game.  If Cyrille pulls out of Russia and gives
    me back Sevastopol (while leaving me Rumania), I will do my best to stop
    Russia up north.  If this is not acceptable to Cyrille then that's fine too.
    I'll just keep knocking south as hard as I possibly can and let E/G have the

    Cyrille, it's your call.  I'll know your answer by your retreat.  If there's

    So, it seems that there is a war. I don't care about this game anymore, and
    with the
    start of the WorldEmailDipTournament, will have little time, especially with
    Russia,
    who seems decided to eradicate me, and Austria, who lie every turn, or at
    least is
    not precise at all, and I don't like in Diplomacy. Maybe PBM is not for
    me...
    
    If you plan to play with Russia, and to stab soon Germany, I will not play
    anymore,
    anyway, you'll be OK in the Med, you only need me not to play with Austria.
    I can
    be useful, but not for long, in Russia, it'll depend of what you want. Tell
    me.
    Anyway, as I really don't like NMR's, I'll play, even without diplomacy,
    cause
    NMR's are the worst side of PBM games.

    Chris, maybe you should have try this diplomacy BEFORE I send my retreat's
    order, and
    instead your agressive message, which I really don't like. Actually, a
    famous french
    player, Samy Malki, ex-european Champ, play like that in the last french
    NDC. I don't
    win the game, but I eliminated him (it was not so hard, as I was playing
    France vs
    England). I'm not proud of that, but hopefully, Dip is still a game, and I
    never used,
    nor I like, agressive dip'.
    Sorry for my remark about the lack of dip in the time I required it,
    it was "misplaced" (probably a french expression, it just mean I'm
    sorry). I was not thinking that you lied when you say that, I just said that
    it was
    bad luck, at least for me. And good health for your wife and child.
    Good luck for the game, after my death,
    Cyrille.

    I know you are new to the judge, but you can still change your retreat
    order -- just submit a new order the same way you did.  You can change your
    orders until the move actually goes through, which it hasn't.
    
    I apologize for my agressive tone, but, wow, it's been hard to work

     The French retreat to WMS leaves you with several options:  you

    WOW!  I can't believe we really cajoled Cyrille into that Disband.  It

    those will go through, and possibly both.  I figure if you spring A Warsaw
    to Silesia, you at least bounce the German force which will almost certainly
    move there.
    
    As to the rest, well, that depends alot on what you want to do about
    Cyrille.  Let me know!

    &gt; Cal,
    &gt;
    &gt; WOW!  I can't believe we really cajoled Cyrille into that Disband.  It
    &gt; really changes the whole shape of things, yes?
    
    Yeah, I'm stunned he went for it.  I wouldn't trust us, ya know what I mean?
    
    &gt; The only REAL question is this - do we now stab the bejeasus out of
    Cyrille,
    &gt; or do we stick to what we said before he disbanded?  ;)
    
    On White's Sliding Scale, stabbing the "bejeasous" (note Canadian spelling)
    is very high, but I don't want to commit suicide to do it.  England has been
    very vocal to me about my NOT moving north so he can stab Germany - too
    vocal, in fact, so I don't believe him.  I'd love to hit Cyrille and will
    take some risks to do it, but I want to look at the board first.  No later
    than tomorrow, I promise.
    
    &gt; I will be moving to Tyrolia and Bohemia, once I build in Vienna -- one of
    &gt; those will go through, and possibly both.  I figure if you spring A Warsaw
    &gt; to Silesia, you at least bounce the German force which will almost
    certainly
    &gt; move there.
    
    Let you know tomorrow.
    
    &gt; As to the rest, well, that depends alot on what you want to do about
    &gt; Cyrille.  Let me know!
    
    Yup.

    Christian:
    
     You are, of course, right to want to wait until the French removal
    is made before
    final plans for the follow Spring are made!  However, one can pretty
    well predict
    the uses with which France will be putting his units in S'1906.  He will
    have to use
    A Spa to cover Por, and will have to employ the remaining fleet or army
    in covering Spain (unless he is suiciding out on behalf of Austria,
    which I doubt).
     No matter what he keeps, I will be going for Gas in the Spring
    turn.  If Austria is
    going to support the Italian army in order to slow my land advance, I
    will need your presence in Spain in order to give me the second vital
    support for an advance into
    Mar.  I should be able to support you into Spain in F'06 from
    Gas...unless Austria
    pulls out of Pie and leaves Italian A Mar to its premature demise!
    Meanwhile, my plan is to build the obvious A Ber and move A Mun-Boh,
    A Ber-
    Mun in the Spring.  It is my only real offensive option in the area, and
    it is my best
    defense against Austria as well.  I will write to Russia and encourage
    him to use
    his A War in a move to Gal:  he seems to be "at leisure" at the moment!
    
    Paul
