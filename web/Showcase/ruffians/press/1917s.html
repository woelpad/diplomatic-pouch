    Cal, Meef:
    
    Here´s my moves:
    A Edi-Nth-Hol
    F Nth C A Edi-Nth-Hol
    F Ska-Swe
    A Den S A Hol-Kie
    A Hol-Kie
    A Ruh-Mun
    A Bel-Bur
    A Pic-Par
    A Lon-Eng-MAO-Gas
    F Eng C A Lon-Gas
    F MAO C A Lon-Gas
    F LYO S F WES
    F WES hold
    
    I will tell Chris something totally different, trying to get him not to
    cover Mun/Kie. What I tell Chris will be something like convoyint to NWY
    while supporting myself to NAf. If any of you guys want me to do other
    moves than the ones I suggest above, let me know and I will change them (as
    long as you don't suggest things like "give me all your centers" :))
    
    all the best

    Well, Meef, what do you think?  Time to throw in the towel and make peac
    with Chris if it's still possible?  Christian's proposed move to Sweden
    makes me think it's likely he's going to try for the win (not that there was
    ever much of a doubt).  I'm just wondering if it's worth trying to stop him
    at this point.
    
    Man, I expected so much more from a player of Chris's (alleged) calibre.

    Because Den S A Hol-Kie. If I do it the other way (Hol S A Den-Kie) I will

    It is kinda a tough situation.
    
    Chris appealed for another "stab Russia and we'll fight England together".
    Giving me no other option.  I think he hates u. :)
    
    I hate being manipulated so as far as I am concerned, I'll let England win
    before Austria is gonna dictate how I play.  I know as soon as I stabbed u,
    he'd stab me.  Same ole', I am in control or else.  He and I would never
    make allies for long.
    
    So with all that whining, I am not sure what to do.  If Chris will make
    peace w/ US, I'll deal, but he's not gonna force a division of r/t by
    turkey.
    
    So, I think we blew our chances last year.  Me wasting Rom and poor commo
    concerning Rum.
    
    U just wanna roll over and let England have the solo?
    
    Or just die a slow death?
    
    I can suicide in an all out effort to kick Austria a little.
    
    Any brainstorms?

    I like the idea of kicking Austria as hard as possible.  If it becomes
    (more) obvious that Christian is guaranteed a solo, let's negotiate with him
    to wait until Chris is eliminated first.  I think he'll go for that.

    Christian --
    
    Well, as to what happens now, it is really up to you.  Tactically, this game
    is a draw, and I would be happy with that.
    
    Diplomatically, I am commited to throwing you the game, if you want it.
    
    So, up to you!  I would go and take StPete as well as the German centers
    this year, if I were you.  Russia is going to make a gain off of me this
    year or next, so you;d better hurry if you dont want HIM preventing your
    solo!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Chris,
    
    I very much want to win a solo. Don't we all? :)
    
    OK, I am moving as you outlined, convoying to NWY this turn. It would be
    good for me if you supported GAL to be sure that Russia doesn't move too
    far west too early.
    
    Trieste-Adriatci would also be nice. Maybe you can retreat Ser to Alb and
    convoy to Apulia next turn?

    &gt;Movement results for Spring of 1917.  (ruffians.076)

    &gt;England: Army Edinburgh -&gt; North Sea -&gt; Norway.
    
    I can hardly say I'm surprised or that you didn't warn me, but I really,
    really want to ask one favour.
    
    Can you wait until after Chris is eliminated before grabbing the 18th?  I
    think that would make the most fitting end to this game.

    Well, that about does it.  17 this year, and 18 for sure next.  (even if Cal
    can defend StPete next year, nothing can stop me giving Christian Trieste.)
    
    And, without even ONE item of press suggesting that I do such a thing, well,
    there you are.  In point of fact, I haven't recieved any press from R/T at
    all!  Oh, I take that back -- Meef is ready to accept a 4 way draw now.  ;)
    
    This has been a fun game all around.  Cal, I want to say that I never wanted
    you out of the draw, I wanted you to be stabbed by Turkey, because that was
    the only way I was going to expand.  I think maybe you took it personally
    when you saw me say "I want a 3 way draw, A/T/E".  The fact was, YOU weren't
    going to work with me, and if Meef wasn't, then it was game over for me one
    way or another.
    
    Does anyone remember 1901?  Christian lost the North Sea and didn't build.
    (JOHN remembers 1901!  Paul remembers 1902 ;)   Quite a comeback for
    Christian, and in the end I have to be happy with this result -- I told Meef
    if he worked with me, we would both have a chance to profit, but if he
    didn't we'd both lose  -- Maybe I would have stabbed him successfully later
    on, maybe not,  but we'll not find that out THIS game.
    
    Writing the EOG for this one is going to be a bear, but I can't wait for the
    chance to read everyone elses press!  One of the things I'd like to see, if
    possible, would be the press sorted in files other than chronologically; or
    possibly in addition to chronologically?  I know that would probably be a
    lot of work -- but (from a scholorly point of view) I'd rather read all of
    Russia and Turkey's exchanges without having to wade through the other 5
    powers press of the same phase.
    
    Let get those fall moves in today, and put an end to this beast!  ;)

    Christian,
    
    As I say in my broadcast,  I think you now have this sewn up tight.  God I
    love long convoys!  Very nice.
    
    So, take Berlin and Venice this year, and move to Finland -- If Cal is
    convinced it's over, he may let you walk into StPete.  I will re-take
    Serbia, and in such a fasion that Cal can't take Bud or Serbia (thus, he
    shouldn't build.)  If Meef screws up at all I'll take Naples, and if you
    will be so kind as to hit the Tyrhinian sea, I will at least keep Rome.
    
    Congrats!
    
    Chris

     &gt; powers press of the same phase.
    
    First, let me say that there are over 2000 messages in my Ruffians
    file.  Some might just be deadline extensions or late notices, but the
    vast majority are letters.  Probably more than 1900.
    
    If you look at the showcase games currently at the Pouch, you'll see
    that press is color-coded.  So, if you want to see any letter from
    England, for example, you can quickly scan down the side looking for
    blue.  I don't think it will be that difficult except for the
    occasional letter between England and Italy in Swedish.  (I like the
    idea of leaving these things untranslated.)
    
    So...although it would be nice to provide you with a variety of
    different formats to read the messages, given the incredible volume we
    are talking about, well, it's only going to be in the format you see
    at the Pouch.  I think the color coding should be enough, if you have
    a good browser with a reasonable scroll bar.

     &gt; Let get those fall moves in today, and put an end to this beast!  ;)

    Non sequiter: who's going to WDC in Baltimore?  I know Chris is going,
    and hope Christian will make the trip to defend his title.  Anybody
    else?  I realize it's still four months away but I'm in the process of
    planning my entire summer and I'm curious.
