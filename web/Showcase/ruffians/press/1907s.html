    Paul,
    
    I guess the best is if you support me to Spain(sc) this Spring while I move
    IRI-MAO. Then in the fall you get Mar.
    About north I do as I told you earlier.

    &gt;
    &gt; Well, that went well.  I hope you are recovering.  I think it's a pretty
    &gt; obvious A Moscow, and then we try to crack Munich -- it might even happen!
    &gt; If you are feeling risky, you could Waive the build, and play one short,
    in
    &gt; the hopes of building in Sev next year.
    
    I guess there's a shot at Munich, but you're taking a chance of Germany
    slipping into Boh or Gal.  I've put in orders that have A War & A Rum
    bouncing in Gal to cover your back door, but if you want something
    different, let me know.

    &gt; Cal:
    &gt; Yeah, I know my move to Sil is a pain in the ass...but SOMEBODY has  to
    put units in place to contain
    &gt; Austria!!
    
    I think Austria is a LOT less of a threat to you than the possibility of an
    English stab.
    
    &gt;Hey, it's not like I have enough units in the area  to attack War.
    
    That's true.
    
    &gt; What I want to do, if you will allow me, is to try a supported attack on
    Boh in the Spring.  That wouldn't
    &gt; be a threat to you...would it?
    
    As long as A Sil is the one attacking, I'd have no problem with that move.
    I'm going to turn my attention to making sure England gets squat from his
    northern maneuvers...

    Deal.  A Sil-Boh supported by A Mun.  No units following up into Sil.
    
    &gt;
    &gt; I'm going to turn my attention to making sure England gets squat from his
    &gt; northern maneuvers...
    
    No problem there!  I don't think that Christian will stab me as long as Austria
    has a
    shot at taking the lion's share of my home dots & building an even bigger
    southern
    navy as a result.
     I may be naive, but I don't think so.

    Cal,
    
    Well, I guess you are right, we can afford to wait a minute on the German
    front.
    
    I guess I'd rather you moved Rumania to Bulgaria -- it's the only attack
    that is guaranteed to succeed there.  I can't see Germany moving to Galicia,
    with Munich under attack and all.
    
    We could either try to puch Germany in the Prussia corridor, or Turkey in
    the south -- either way we're going to need to co-ordinate, yes?
    
    I guess I'd like to see this:
    
    A Rum -&gt; Bul
    A Sev -&gt; Rum
    A Mos -&gt; Sev
    A War S A Bohemia -&gt; Gal
    Stp hold
    
    While I go
    
    
    a Serbia S A Rum -&gt; Bul
    F Greece S F ionian -&gt; Aegean
    F ionian -&gt; aegean
    A Tyr -&gt; Boh
    A Boh -&gt; Gal
    
    That makes Bulgaria a lock for you, I cover the Galician corridor, and then
    we push for Silesia in the fall.  Slow but steady!
    
    Thoughts?

    Could you move the fleet to the GoLyon, to support Spain to hold?  Or
    through Tunis to NAF?  Sooner or later England will try to outflank France.
    That would be bad for both of us, yes?

    Sorry for not writing much, but my enery level is still pretty low.
    
    I don't understand why you are attacking me when Germany is such an obvious
    target.
    
    Here's a few points for you to ponder:
    
    1- You've got a perfect chance to attack Germany as you said you wanted to.
    2- He's essentially fleetless and cannot defend against you.
    3- I'm still viable enough to help out.  Take me down (if you can) and you
    face Germany alone.
    4- If you attack Germany WITH my help you'd likely pick up the lion's share
    of his centres, both at home and in France.  By attacking me, you stand to
    pick up, what?  St Pete's and Moscow?  That's nuts.
    
    BTW, if Germany has convinced you that Austria is such a threat, remember
    that Turkey is still able to do damage and Austria is quite spread out.
    It's not as if attacking Germany is going to let Austria sweep the board.
    You'll never have a better chance.
    
    I really think you need to take a look at your overall strategy.  Let me
    know if I can help, or do I just throw everything northward for defense?

    Roland,
    
    I am sorry to hear that.  I don't know how you plan on getting another fleet
    in the water.  I certainly won't be giving one of my hard won centers up for
    nothing!  Are you open to the possibility of dislodging the army in Naples
    so it can be re-built as a fleet?
    
    I hope you understand that I am not threatening you -- I simply cannot
    afford to lose units right now.
    
    I have a thought though -- if you move the fleet to the Gulf of Lyon, I
    don't need the army in Piedmont.  Would that be an acceptable compromise?
    
    Best,

    Definite change of plans.  I have to take the trouble to finish Roland off.

    Your support for my move of A Gas-Mar will be greatly appreciated-- thank

     I also appreciate your moving out of Nth, for obvious reasons.
    
     Next Spring, we might want to consider your allowing my F Kiel-Den.
    Then, in the Fall, you could support yourself back in, and I could retreat
