    I want to hold on to Gre until I can get out and protect it, but if he wants
    Gre there is nothing I can do about it.  I think Aus will take it back.  I
    think he is a little frustrated with the upstart Ottoman not rolling over
    for him.
    
    So maybe it will be more effective if we lurch forward this season making
    our whole situation more effective.
    
    How about:
    
    a pru s war - sil
    a war - sil

    Yes, I will follow the outline that you sent before.  I have no more incentive
    to
    engage in more adventurism with Austria, and I have absolutely no trust/hope

    I think he should learn to live with that, don't you? &lt;G&gt;

    &gt;Or do u think u can forge a deal with Aus?
    
    I think I have little choice but to dance with the devil for another year.
    If I attack him, I do believe that he will turn all his armies east against
    Russia and I just can't stand against that much military strength (yet).  As
    soon as he gets whittled down a bit, either by England/Germany taking back
    German home centres or by you taking Italian centres, I will move on him.
    
    As for your suggested moves, I think you have your own moves down correctly.
      I'm going to have to talk to Austria before I decide on mine.  Did he ever
    respond to your note about moving through the Med?
    
    Later,

    Since we agreed to let you stay in a comfort zone as regards my moves, I
    need to know your suggestions.  I'm willing to pop that Galician unit, so
    just say when and where.

    That probably cinches it.  He's most likely busy right now and also getting
    just a tad fed up with the game.
    
    Has Christian been writing to you?  I assume Paul has given up (at least on

    Paul's last message to me was some kind of cock - in - bull he sent to half

    Cal,
    
    Ok,  Sorry -- really busy here.  People should be here to tear out the
    kitchen Cabinets and the bathroom in an hour or so.
    
    Ok What do you think of:
    
    A Sil -&gt; Gal
    A Bud S A Sil -&gt; Gal
    A Tyr -&gt; Vie
    
    Of course, this leaves you the aggresive retreat to Bohemia.  I think you
    know what that would ignite, however.  ;)
    
    On your end, what are you thinking?  I'd like Galicia -&gt; Vienna for the
    bounce.  A unit moving towards StPete wouldn't ruin my day either.
    
    Are you thinking that Liverpool will convoy to Brest, right now?  Christian
    is playing it pretty close to the vest.

    do you prefer Mikal or Meef?  I can go either way -- I tend to reply to

    Ok.  I would like to see the following, as a plan of getting your fleets
    towards Spain
    
    Move one fleet out into the Emed, Re-take the Black Sea,  support Greece to
    hold, Greece to hold.  If you can be patient, we can work one fleet at a
    time out into the Med -- I am all for this, ok?  But if you come with
    everything all at once, I am going to freak out when I send in orders.  ;)
    
    Still no interest in Stabbing Russia?  It would work, he believes in you!

    Christian,
    
    Ok, I am dead busy here, so a quick note to confirm what we have talked
    about before.
    
    I will be moving Piedmont -&gt; Marsailles, and then through to a non -SC
    province in the fall.
    
    Niether of us will move to the Westmed, and your fleet in Marsailles will
    move to Spain, and then back to Marsailles.
    
    We talked about all that a week ago, right?
    
    I assume you will be convoying to Brest.  Do you need Kiel to support an
    attack on Denmark at this time?
    
    All the best,

    That's prety much what I was thinking.  you didn't comment on my earlier

    got to do *something* that looks aggresive or Christian will get supicious.
    
    &gt; Are you thinking that Liverpool will convoy to Brest, right now?
    Christian

    Again, we're thinking along the same lines.  He hasn't written lately so I

    Chris,
    
    I do not know if u have ever played the diplomacy cd rom game, but anyway
    there is a setting of your attitude u have toward other players.  From nice
    to stern (not the exact wording of the game).  My signoff name whether Meef
    or MiKal is a reflection of my demeanor.  MiKal being an "official" title of
    the Sultan, Meef being the guy behind the facade.  So...
    
    I would rather not go into the bla or stab Russia.
    
    How about:
    
    f smy s con - aeg
    f con - aeg
    f ank - con
    f bul(sc) s gre
    f gre s con - aeg
    
    That would be one fleet at a time so we can maximize our comfort level.
    
    BTW, what kinda of thoughts do u have so I can pickup an sc or two as not to
    overextend myself as I head toward the med?

    people the way they sign off.  ;)
    
    Ok.  I would like to see the following, as a plan of getting your fleets
    towards Spain
    
    Move one fleet out into the Emed, Re-take the Black Sea,  support Greece to
    hold, Greece to hold.  If you can be patient, we can work one fleet at a
    time out into the Med -- I am all for this, ok?  But if you come with
    everything all at once, I am going to freak out when I send in orders.  ;)
    
    Still no interest in Stabbing Russia?  It would work, he believes in you!
    (tempt, tempt tempt.)  ;)
    
    sound good?
    
    Best,

    Cal,
    
    Sorry, a move of Prussa to Silesia will be ok, but I was thinking that
    Berlin would be the easiest center for you to move into next.  I guess you
    can move there from Silesia . . .
    
    What do you think of our fleet heavy Turk.  That has to be the nicest thing
    you've seen all week.  Maybe longer!

    &lt;&lt;That would be one fleet at a time so we can maximize our comfort level.&gt;&gt;
    
    Works for me.
    
    &lt;&lt;I do not know if u have ever played the diplomacy cd rom game, but anyway
    there is a setting of your attitude u have toward other players.  From nice
    to stern (not the exact wording of the game).  &gt;&gt;
    
    ;)  I beta tested it actually -- it really is pretty, too bad about the AI.
    Hey, are you saying I play like the hasbro AI?  Ouch!
    
    &lt;&lt;BTW, what kinda of thoughts do u have so I can pickup an sc or two as not
    to
    overextend myself as I head toward the med?
    
    Thoughts?
    
    Meef&gt;&gt;
    
    This is the problem.  What SC do you suggest?  The nearest one is Spain --
    and that is 3 years away, soonest.  I can't afford to give up Tunis or
    naples unless I am making real gains in  france.  Which I don't see
    happening right now.
    
    Can you wait that long?  My fear is once I let you into the Ionian I can't
    control where you go from there  Right now I can hold the Ionian against the
    Three fleets you can put on it -- but it'd be really easy for England to
    back door me.  We are going to have to see how it goes, and be very, very
    patient.

    He just wrote to me too.  He's finally stopped (for now) asking me to attack
    you.  He figures I must have been happy to see your builds... &lt;G&gt;
    
    We're going to arrange a pseudo-attack against each other this turn with the
    idea of throwing England off the scent.  I'll end up with A Gal annihilated
    so I can build a northern fleet.  No sure that's what I'll build, but it
    will kep Austria happy for the moment.
    
    Just so you know, I am committed to taking Austria down with you so we can
    try for a two-way draw.  That would be a great achievement in a demo game.
    I just want to make sure that we are strong enough to stop England from
    expanding and forcing his way into a draw (or victory).  It will be tricky,
    but that's what the game is all about...

    Sounds good to me.  He's very correct about not being able to control you
    once you're in the Ionian.  In fact, he's so right that you should tell him
    anything necessary to get there.  Say you'll settle for Spain and once
    you're in the Ionian, you can grab like mad for as many Italian centres as
    you can as fast as you can.  With you growing to 8 or so centres and him
    losing a couple, it'll be clear for me to jump on his home turf.  With luck,
    we could both reach 9 or 10 centres or so within three years.

    More like all game, given the way this sucker has progressed. Let's see.
    I've had four different countries occupy one or more of my home centres and

    Right now, only one thing has me concerned: are you going to make sure that

    have to start moving armies north to cover/regain St Pete's.  Especially

    Hi Meef!
    
    Just looking at what Austria wants me to do and, if I go along with it, he
    would be able to stab me by taking Rumania.
    
    Here's what he wants:
    
    A: a tyo-vie; a sil-gal, s by a bud
    R: a gal-vie; a pru-sil
    
    That would dislodge the army in Gal and allow it to be retreated off the
    board, ostensibly to be rebuilt in St Pete's as a fleet.  Unfortunately, it
    would also give him three units on Rumania and he could take it if he wants.
    
    Here's the moves you said you'd be making:
    
    &gt;f con - aeg
    &gt;f gre s con - aeg
    &gt;f bul s gre
    &gt;f ank - con
    &gt;f smy - eas

    &gt; What is Chris up to.  Any ideas?
    
    Sounds like he wants an extra season of security in Ion before he considers
    letting you in there?
    
    Maybe, with your move to Black, he REALLY figures he can't break us up and
    this scares him a fair bit.  Maybe enough that he may not WANT to let you
    into Ionian anymore.  This would be bad news as we would have to get an army
    into Serbia before we could force the Ion.  Why don't you just write him and
    ask him what this would accomplish?  Remind him that bottling you up
    wouldn't be in anyone's best interests and would force R/T to attack him.
    Be real subtle about the last point though... Don't want to scare him any
    further.

    Chris,
    
    I can substantiate the fact the I am f ank - bla this season.  I thought it
    would not matter since u had requested me moving into bla in the beginning.
    As far as bouncing eas, I do not have a problem with that, not really
    understanding the purpose of it, except giving u a higher comfort level.
    Anything I can do to increase your comfort level, I am pleased to do.
    However the statement of "it guarantees I can't attack Greece" confuses me a
    little.  Could u still not annihilate my fleet in Greece with the orders I
    am issuing?
    
    Thoughts?

    &gt;
    &gt; What makes you think E/A can eliminate R/T?
    &gt;
    &gt; I aint seeing it!

    E/A don't seem to be bothering one another, or R/A either.  You're just
    bothering
    Germany.  What happens after that can't be my concern.

    &gt;cal,
    &gt;
    &gt;I do not trust Chris.  Every message i get from him alludes to me stabbing
    &gt;u.  FYI
    &gt;
    &gt;Meef
    
    Basically, Chris is positive that I'm just lying in wait to get him back for
    stabbing me.  He's not far wrong, although I won't throw the game to England
    to do it (that's the part he doesn't seem to be aware of...), so he is
    trying to turn you against me as a sort of pre-emptive strike against me.
    He'd like to see me involved SOMEWHERE so my armies aren't hovering over him
    the way they are currently.
    
    Don't worry about it.  You and I going to stay solid.  This game is likely
    to end as a three-way, but we just need to make sure you and I are BOTH part
    of it.  That means someone else has to go and I'd like it be Chris.  The
    balancing act we'll have to pull off to prevent an English win will be the
    tricky part.

    Hi Christian!
    
    What's the deal with your moves?  You said you'd be bouncing in Norway so
    that Germany couldn't threaten St. Pete's.  It's just lucky he moved to Hel
    or I'd be losing St Pete's again this Fall.
    
    So what happened?

    Hi Chris,
    
    So now what?  We both ordered exactly as we said we would (fiurst time for
    everything, eh?).  I will be disbanding Gal as soon as I set up a cover
    story with England.
    
    Any suggestions now?  Are you still planning to give me Berlin or has that
    changed?  What about the Med situation? We have to give that some thought
    pretty soon before the Western Seas turn navy blue...

    Kraut to Lord Whatshisname, Admiral of the Ocean Sea:
     Yes, it's decided.  You DO have a serious phobia against entering
    the Med area..
    Now really, Christian.  Using THREE units to take an empty space?  Oh.
    You want
    to take Paris too, eh?

    Cal,
    
    My fiancé are having some heavy pains of that kind you have when you expect
    to give birth to a child (whatever that is called in English) so I will
    answer VERY brief...
    
    I took a wild shot at Paul trusting me one last turn AND HE DID! That was
    very good indeed for us as now Nwy/STP can be forever vacated and I have
    time to ship armies to France and mainland Germany. Sorry if I lied about
    covering Nwy but I didn't want my guessing to be out at all. I also lied to
    Chris about this and he is so pissed at me...as I had also promised him to
    get into mar to be able to continue to Burgundy.
    
    Anyway, as you see my moves were very pro-russia but I couldn't tell you as
    I was not sure wheather you would pass it on to Paul.
    
    Yes, I am paranoid.

    Cal, my previous message was supposed to be a tongue-in-cheek ribbing

     I'm quite out of your reach, and I'm likely to be gone by the time
    you get here,
    but I invite you to the dots-that-once-were-German so that you can say
    you punished me (if that is still your priority).  Not that I care

    Cal,
    
    Seriously, what is the holdup?  You can use Turkey's move to the Black sea
    as an excuse for the disband.  If he wonders, tell england I promised not to
    attack you if you disbanded the unit.
    hmmm.  would he believe that?  I dunno, he's been pretty gullible.

    Paul,
    
    Well, you are quite right, I have created an English monster.
    
    If you are interested, I will be ordering Kiel to support Denmark to hold.
    This should free you to defend Paris and Belgium.  Or you could take Kiel.
    
    At this point I have no further designs on German centers, and indeed
    cherish you as a buffer against England!

    Christian,
    
    I understand about your lying -- I shouldn't have asked in the first place.
    I really wanted reassurance that you wouldn't be going to Westmed!
    
    Ah, well.
    
    I almost moved my fleet in the Tyhr to the Gol on the principle that if you
    didn't let me in, I'd force my way in, but that wouldn't have done us much
    good, would it?
    
    I think Turkey is really going to stab Russia this time.  Do you have any
    info on that score?

    The Judge did go into a brief slow down or break down for awhile last
    night/this morning.  It does seem to be back now.  We always could
    move back to the FROG judge ;-)  It finally is coming back up (most
    of you undoubtedly received the notice).
