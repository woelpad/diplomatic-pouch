    Greetings!
    
    And welcome!
    
    I do not know if you remember me, but we have met. I was one of the Swedes
    in the crowded car. :-)

    Greetings (again)!
    
    My general impressions about this game is right now zero.
    I do not remember much. It was a long time since we played the last turn.
    
    But I agree with you F/G is very threatening.
    And I guess I will have to deal with that sooner or later. Probably
    sooner.

    It seems that Cyrille is getting up to speed - great!
    
    Cyrille, I told you about the "press" command.  If you want to
    broadcast something for everybody to read (including the numerous
    observers), just use "broadcast" on a line by itself.
    
    People are allowed to broadcast whatever they like, with the exception
    of movie spoilers.  I've heard rumors that Anakin Skywalker and Ben Kenobi
    survive the first film, but I want to wait until I can see that for
    myself, which might not be for another two months (unless it's playing
    in England in July.)
    
    The Matrix just was released her last week, and I saw it on Monday.
    Much better than I expected.  The Kung Fu scene by itself made the
    film worth seeing.  And with a film like that, I think it might be
    better to see it in a foreign language, so the banality of the
    dialogue doesn't get too tedious.

    How are things? Good I hope.
    
    A new Turkey does not change our plans, right?

    I thought Cyrille started up in pouchtoo originally, I guess he
    didn't get that far with it before his unfortunate accident.
    Good to see him back and congrats on joining the doctoral club!

    OK, OK, I get it.  Allow me to inform you that EVERYONE who should die
    in this film does not.... which will undoubtedly leave you sore depressed.
    This is not a spoiler, it is the reality of the movie business.

    &gt; I take it this is a comment about the apparently universally hated Jar
    &gt; Jar Binks.  He's joined Wesley Crusher in my fantasy Air Lock, waiting
    &gt; to get spaced.
    &gt;
    Hey, NOW who's spoiling the movie!!?? Someone who hasn't even seen it!!
    There is another, my son, there is another....

    &gt;
    &gt; I think all that was said was that it was predictable.  The last
    &gt; Hollywood movie which diverged from formula was "Turner & Hooch".  Tom
    &gt; Hanks figured the film lost at least 50 million dollars because of
    &gt; that.
    
    I didn't see that movie either.  Perhaps I'll have to rent it.
    And The Matrix WAS predictable.... very predictable.
    &gt;
    &gt; For interesting plotlines and character developments, I stick to
    &gt; smaller films.  But I've yet to see a good low-budget movie where the
    &gt; main characters dodge bullets!
    &gt;
    &gt; Rick
    &gt;
    No indeed.  Did you see the Matrix subtitled or dubbed??  There were some
    great voices (including but not exclusively Mr. Fishburne) in the movie.
    
    Perhaps we should take this discussion off of the game broadcasts if it
    goes on much longer.

    'ruffians':
    
    Thanks a lot for the last moves. It gives me a new light on the game.
    By why, you mean why did you attack my army in Bulgaria instead of
    taking Greece? Well, I guess it's because Russia asked you to do so,
    arguing that he should then help you to resist versous Italy. Which was
    a good argument, especially with a Turkey entirely against Russia.
    But now that Italy bounces you in Trieste, I'm here (now I'm superman)!!
    No, more seriously, talking with both, I think Russia will play against
    Germany, but Italy will not move against France. Of course, we can
    understand why. Russia will have many gains, with the english help, or
    at least neutrality, due to his problems in the area. His only weakness
    is in the South, so he prays for us not to attack him. About Italy, it's
    not the same at all. He has nothing to gain, and can just occupy some
    french units. Many players would prefer rather to have some gains.
    
    I am now ready to play with you, in any direction you propose me.
    
    Cyrille.

    Hello there,
    so you don't read the books? The french navy was never as strong than
    the english one's, even with Napoleon. Nevertheless, I forgive you. Now,
    you have them, you must use it. It seems that all players fear you and
    Germany. I don't understand why, especially for Germany.
    Anyway, you can deny those rumors. Everybody now think that you will
    move against England, so think Italy also. Austria and Italy are in a
    little discord. You can easily move SouthEast. You will quickly gain
    Tun, with my amical pressure against Italy, and Russia will lose his
    main argument (I'm the only one who can stop the FG, please let me grow
    in the North when I have nothing in the South...), so Austria will maybe
    change. I wait for your reply. Sorry I cannot finsh my word.

    Cyrille,
    
    I think have got a good grasp of what is happening on the board.  It has
    been so long since the last moves went through that everyone is looking at
    the board fresh, and re-assessing what to do with their postion!
    
    I would like for us to move on Russia -- I will support your Army in
    Bulgaria to Rumania, and move Vienna -&gt; Galicia.  I will also move my fleet
    into Greece, where it can do some good against Italy.
    
    I would very much like for us to work together, I think I am feeling as
    surrounded as you are at this point!

    'ruffians':
    
    This sounds great. I'm OK. Maybe you didn't hear that, but I guess I'm a
    player who lie rarely. I love my allies. There's only a rule, due to the
    FTF games I use to play : a good ally is one who end the game ... but we
    less centers than you:-), a bad ally is one who end with more. If you
    nee to stab your ally, of course it's only for a win. So, I'll move
    Bulgaria to Rumania, and my fleet to Aegean Sea, to eventually act on
    Ionian. As I said, and I hope you agree, I'd rather prefer that we don't
    threat each other, by being to close, a two hex range is perfect, and
    should be done ... later of course. That's why, if we play together, I
    think you will be more continental and I'll be more on the seas (guess
    the english word is maritime, as in French, but I'm not sure). It's too
    early to speak about that of course, but I prefer to think in a long
    range. I hope you agree in the great lines.
    
    All the best,
    
    Cyrille

    &gt;Cal,
    &gt;
    &gt;Well, another workd champ joins the table!  What are we going to do about
    &gt;it?  I am very busy with work right now, but I'd like to hear your thoughts
    &gt;on the board -- Cyrille is begging for his life, as any good player in his

    I guess my only having two Canuck championships is starting to give me an
    inferiority complex... d;-})
    
    As for the game, it will be nice to have a Turk who actually communicates,
    but I can't say that I really see that an alteration in plan is
    necessary/desirable.  We need my ability to build fleets in the north and we
    need Italy's ability to engage France quickly.
    
    Unless Italy's resolve to head west has flagged, I think Turkey figures to
    be the odd man out.
    
    He's promised to vacate Armenia (or Caucasia as he's calling it), so I'd be
    happy to see that, but I still can't see him surviving in an A/I/R.
    Obviously, I AM willing to listen to points of view to the contrary.  What
    do you think?
    
    Guess I better set the board up and look at it again, eh?  d;-})

    Hi Cyrille:
     Have you gotten my previous messages to you since you "signed on"
    as the new
    Turk?
     I've been marvelling that the Russian had the guts to build an
    anti-German fleet
    in StPsc, in the face of the attack by your predecessor!  I am calling
    off my
    invasion of England to deal with it, and I hope that you will be able to
    continue the
    attack!
     It may be possible to also enlist the aid of Austria in the
    anti-Russian cause.  He
    shouldn't automatically blame you for the actions of the man who came
    before, and
    he's told me that a move to Gal isn't out of the question!
     I/A seem to be chums, after all the time since S'01.  Austria will
    have to choose
    between attacking you or attacking the Tsar.
     Best of luck to you in any case!
    
    --Paul

    Hi, I was waiting to reply to your message, to hear more about my
    neighbours. I think I'm gonna continue to put some pressure versus
    Russia. I don't think you're really dangerous, as he said. But I'm more
    toubled concerning France. He is in great situation. I understand that
    you play with him, but I think you don't have to hesitate to ask more
    gains than him in England. Anyway, he needs you so strong as an ally
    that he would not be able to say no. And you need to be strong to resist
    versus Russia ( at least ).

    Well, I just answer to Germany, who of course ask me to attack Russia,
    I'm sure he does the same to you. My answer was moderate. I don't think
    it would be a good idea to talk about our plans. I just told of an
    "amical pressure" versus Russia, and that I don't know about you...
