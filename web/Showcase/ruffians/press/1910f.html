    Hi Mikal!
    
    A treacherous German convoy aside, I think that went great.  Many thanks for
    your support.  I think we have the basis of a longterm working relationship
    here.
    
    I trust that Chris's pleas are falling on deaf ears.  Just shows that he
    considers himself to be in trouble.  If we hold him by the throat until
    Germany either takes England out or they make peace, we'll be in pretty good
    shape.  We just need to stick together and present a united front.
    
    As usual, I'm at work so I don't have the board in front of me.  I'm open to
    tactical suggestions and I'll probably have a few of my own after I get
    home.  I'll try to write you tonight since I'll be away all day tomorrow.
    If I don't get a chance, don't worry, I'm not falling for Austrian blarney,
    I'm just out of town.
    
    Take care,
    
    Cal

    Paul,
    &lt;&lt;Hi Chris!
     So England really did swap Mao for Spain:  &gt;&gt;
    
    Yeah, go fig.  What was he thinking?
    
    &lt;&lt;he's trying to convinceme that hewill throw the game to you if I don't
    pull back on my own attacks on
    him.&gt;&gt;
    
    Throw the game to ME?!?  How exactly would he go about doing that?!?
    He made the same threat to me, by the way, which seems at least Credible!
    
    &lt;&lt;   We can take advantage of your being in Mao:  how about your going
    with
    A Mar-Spa supported by F Wes; F Mao-Por cutting the support there.
    Instead of
    my sending A Gas-Mar and leaving English A Spa a place to retreat, why
    don't we
    bounce A Gas and A Bur over Mar?  This should be enough to achieve the
    annihilation of the English F Spain, and I can keep the dot in Mar for
    myself.&gt;&gt;
    
    This is a sound plan.  Let me look at it and see if it could backfire with
    "loose cannon France" running around.
    Frankly, I'd like to take Tunis now, but I think you're right the support
    for the Move to spain is key.
    Although, you could simply support me into Spain, and achieve the same
    result.
    
    In FACT, I could really use that Burgundian army back home.  You have
    England well under control, and I am going to need another fleet to finish
    off Turkey.  What would you think about dislodging that unit in Burgundy so
    I could disband it and rebuild a fleet?  You'd have to trust me not to
    retreat to Munich, I guess, but I think if I was going to stab you I'd do it
    in a more effective fashion than that!  ;)
    
      &lt;&lt; How do I compensate for the loss of Spain?  Well, StP is wide open,
    isn't it?
    English A Fin should be busy supporting Swe, while F Nwy should be
    engaged in
    trying to keep Nth out of my hands.  Russia's only means of covering Stp
    is to order
    Mos there, covering Mos with Ukr-Mos supported by A Sev.  Obviously,
    this
    would mean his abandoning Rum to you so it is by no means a sure thing!&gt;&gt;
    
    Hmmm.  Cal has as much as said that he will be taking Warsaw back.  I would
    take it as a great favor, if instead of Liv -&gt; StP,  you order Livonia to
    support Warsaw to hold -- that would really help me get into position
    agaisnt the R/T.
    how does all this strike you?
    
    Happy holidays!
    
    Chris

    Dear Archpope,
    
    U seem a little peaved at the lowly esteemed newcomer.  Please forgive the
    "what does around, comes around" episode.  How can we start afresh with a
    plan that will not meet in the quick demise of Turkey and the meteoric rise
    of Austria?  Surely u will share the pie with the Ottomans, eh?
    
    MiKaL
    
    
    &gt; Mikal, Cal
    &gt;
    &gt; What reason will u give me for being in the aegean?  &gt;&gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; What reason will you give me for not being in Sev?  I stabbed a long-time
    &gt; ally in Russia, and I KNEW he'd be lobbying hard for you to join him
    against
    &gt; the big bad austrian.  I had to do something to cover the possibility that
    &gt; you would turn on me.  If you hadn't, that fleet could have gone to the
    &gt; Ionian -- as it is, I'm really glad I left myself a retreat from Bulgaria!
    &gt;
    &gt; Look, I understand your concerns regarding me.  Cal is a good player and
    can
    &gt; be quite persuasive.  You can see now that if you had moved as I had
    &gt; suggested, and you agreed, you would now be in Sev AND Bulgaria, Russia
    &gt; would have been dealt a crushing blow, and I could leave the mopping up to
    &gt; you while I went after Germany.
    &gt;
    &gt; Now we are back to the same old stalemate in the Balkans.  Will you defend
    &gt; Bul, or cover Smy?  From the tone of your letter Mikal you aren't prepared
    &gt; to listen to any suggestions I have as to how we could work together, and
    at
    &gt; this point I really don't care.  I have dealt with THREE backstabbing
    Turks,
    &gt; all of whom I tried to work with, and all of whom turned on me.  Fine.
    &gt;
    &gt; Cal, I was a bad boy and I'm sorry.  Can you forgive me?  You do
    understand
    &gt; that this afternoon I was trying to find a way to work with you, but if
    &gt; Mikal here had stuck to the plan it was too good an opportunity to pass
    up.
    &gt; The three of us can stalemate each other for a while, but as I said to you
    &gt; Germany is now the real threat.
    &gt;
    &gt; Happy holidays to you both -- Seriously.  I wish you both all of the joy
    of
    &gt; the season!

    Cal,
    
    Mr.  Austria always has a comeback!!  I think it caught him off guard I
    switched after two cooperative moves.  THe point he alluded to in the
    message to u about the me not noticing a one-sided deal he was working, is
    the whole reason to attack the guy.  I knew from talking to Italy and the
    way he was talking about Russia, that he was gonna gut me as soon as he
    could.
    
    I am all for remaining united against Mr.  Austria as long as it takes to
    wear him down.
    
    Is germany gonna attack u with the army in livonia?

    Dear Kaiser,
    
    As u can see, and probably have already heard, Mr. Austria is infuriated
    with the lowly esteemed newcomer.  I would like to whole-heartedly invite to
    to partake in the spoils.  I think u r in a position to greatly exploit the
    circumstances.  If the ottoman empire can assist u with our limited
    resources, please advise.
    
    Btw, when i first came into the game there was an Austrian army in the
    German heartland, how is it u have an ounce of trust for Mr. Austria.  The
    short time I have been in the game, it seems he has stabbed or taken a swipe
    at everyone on the board.

    Okay, great.  I'm an alliance type player as I mentioned before and I think
    we need to stick together to survive here.
    
    &gt;Is germany gonna attack u with the army in livonia?
    
    That's the million dollar question.  From his letter to me, I think he is
    feeling some pressure from England over whether or not England can or will
    throw the game to Austria.  He seems willing to change his target from St
    Pete's to Warsaw if I am willing to support him in.  It's damned risky, but
    I'm thinking about it.  I'll let you know as it will affect our tactics.  I
    need to talk to England too.  I'll try to keep you fully informed.

    Christian: Looks like you've thrown a scare into Germany.  He said you're
    threatening to throw the game to Austria and he wants to know if I'm willing
    to support him into Warsaw instead of him trying for St Pete's.  Before I
    decide, I need to check out as much of his story as I can.
    
    He said you plan to keep him so busy that he becomes an open invitation to
    an Austrian stab.  He also said that you were willing to break off the
    engagement with him if he shows you something "positive".
    
    Can you confirm this?  If it's true, he may be telling the truth about
    turning against Austria.  Any comment on this situation?  Do you think he's
    serious?  Any input will help.
    
    Thanks,
    
    Cal

    Yes, my A Gas could support your A Mar-Spa, but then Mar is left open in case
    French F Gol decides to go there.  The best alternative is to have A Gas go to
    Spa
    supported by your A Mar, with F Mao cutting the English support in Portugal.
    This
    might free your F Wes for a move to Tunis, or you could support A Gas-Spa in
    case we have reason to fear the French cutting Mar.
    
    &gt;

    Paul,
    
    &gt;     I'm curious.  Why do you display such vehemence in defending Nth when
    &gt;you simply abandoned Mao?  Yeah, you annihilated my lone army over there; but can
    &gt;you even maintain Spain for the Fall season?
    
    I had to defend primarily against the first agressor. If Austria takes my centers he does it because he skillfully made you and me war each other. If
     you take my centers you do it because I couldn't defend well enough. I could support you to Lvn, but that would mean that you promise both tp stay o
    ut of NTH and to not help Austria conquering Spa. This might seem harsch, but I think I need a build in Lpl to stop Austria from getting through.
    
    I suggest you move Bel-ENG and I move ENG-IRI. If we combine this with me keeping spain (your A Gas S Spa H) and you getting StP I get a build in Lvp
     and we can force Austria out from the so important MAO. It´s up to you really, what will happen.
    
    After I wrote this I saw your second mail. Yes, that will be a good plan combined with the fleet movements I suggested above. Alternatively A Gas can
     support LYO-MAR.

    have threatened to choose to defend against Germany instead of Austria
    AND I have told him I would change my mibd if he shows something
    positive. So I guess you can trust him in this respect. I have sent him a

    Chris,
    Paul is getting into the NTH anyway, he has three fleets bordering, I
    have two.
    
    How come you set up for an attack on Spa? You knew I was capturing it
    this spring, didn't you? Or were you planning to take it from me?
    
    Helping you getting Brest was actually a really good suggestion by me, if
    I take Spain, you take MAR and BRE (and possibly MUN) he will have to
    disband two (or three). This will give us both a good possibilty to grow.
    It would mean that Brest eventually come unde my administration but you
    could surely outgrow me in the south.

    Christian,
    
    Actually, I figured you were still going for Brest, and would move
    Gascony -&gt; MAO supported by Portugal.
    
    I looked at the map again, and you're right, he does have three to your two,
    I didn't notice that -- although an all out defense might work, you cant
    really afford to lose Sweden, can you?  Much Better if Germany loses some
    centers and has to pull.

    Christian:
       You say:
    I suggest you move Bel-ENG and I move ENG-IRI. If we combine this with me keeping spain (your A Gas S Spa H)  I get a build in Lvp and we can force
    Austria out from the so important MAO. It´s up to you really, what will happen.
    
    Okay, I will support you in Spa and move F Bel-Eng as you suggest.  We have to
    prevent Austria from reaching your open dots!
    
    &gt;
    &gt; After I wrote this I saw your second mail. Yes, that will be a good plan combined with the fleet movements I suggested above. Alternatively A Gas c
    an
    &gt;  support LYO-MAR.
    &gt;
    &gt; I'll wait for John to ask me directly for support for his return to Mar; I don't know if I can trust him after all the "bad blood" from previous
    &gt; turns.  You may presume that I will be supporting you in Spain.
    
     I will also try A Ruh-Mun, A Pic-S-A Par-Bur.  This may drive his army into
    Ruhr, but I can better defend my home dots than I can live with his presence in
    France!
    
    Here is hoping that we can overcome our differences, and move to stop the
    advance of the Austrian juggernaut!

    &gt; Cal,
    &gt; Christmas is here so I will answer briefly. Yes, I guess it's all true. I
    &gt; have threatened to choose to defend against Germany instead of Austria
    &gt; AND I have told him I would change my mibd if he shows something
    &gt; positive. So I guess you can trust him in this respect. I have sent him a
    &gt; plan and his answer might enlighten us firther about his actual plans. I
    &gt; will keep in touch.
    
    Okay, sounds good.  Have a good, safe holiday.

    Hi Cal and Christian!
    
     I wanted both of you to get this summary of where I stand as of
    now.
     It's a bit bewieldering why I am considered so inflexibly
    pro-Austrian.  I started
    out with F/G vs. E; changed to E/G vs. F; was nudged by R into A/R vs. E
    and have
    now been finagled by R/E into E/G vs. A.  One just needs a scorecard to
    keep track.
     Not that I'm resentful, mind you!
     My plans for F'10 include:  A Lvn-War, F Den H, F Hel H, F Bal-Ber,
    A Ruh-
    Mun, A Pic-S-A Par-Bur, A Gas-S- ENG F Spa(nc), F Bel-Eng.  Yes, I'm
    aware
    that the Austrian A Bur could be driven into Ruhr, and his A War to Sil,
    but my dots in the area are (at present) covered.  I want to manouver
    into position to attack Mar in '11, while taking War and keeping Austria
    out of Spa, Iri and Eng.
     If Chris believes what I'm telling him, he expects me to cover Bre
    this Fall,
    support him in War, and allow his A Mar-Spa (A's Gas and Bur are to
    bounce over
    Mar, keeping it still in German hands).  Austria is tempted to take
    Tunis, eliminating the French wild-card fleet, but he needs F Wes to
    support A Mar-Spa
    as well.
     I still regard France as a menace to my Marseilles dot; John has
    done nothing to
    dissuade me of this opinion.
     So... I expect to be drawing Austrian fire again quite soon.  I can
    live without
    Spain (one of my fleets can be yanked in the winter); I never expected
    to take it in
    the first place!
     Am I missing anything here?
    
    Paul

    Hi guys!
    
    I am no doubt willing to go along with this line. I will move (as we
    decided Paul) F Eng-Iri and build for Spain in Lpl to be able to cover NAO
    while taking MAO back from Austria. I will remind you though, an aggressive
    move from Paul and I will allow Autria free movement into Iberia and all of
    Atlantic ocean.
    
    I also promise not to try for StP with or whithout support.

    All of a sudden, I have to work 4 hours today.  I want to make up for the 4
    hours I
    missed Thursday (the flu).  No biggie-- it's just taking Circuit Court records
    of the
    internet.  I don't have to leave the house.
     So the E/G/R is born.  I will behave myself, and see if we can't wear
    Austria
    down a bit!  If he gains Mar but loses War/Bul, it should be a start in the
    right
    direction.
     Don't worry, Christian.  I will stay out of the Nth and not be attacking
    Swe.
     Happy Christmas!

    Hi Meef!  Since I have to work today, I may as well take some time to update
    you on what's going on in the game.
    
    I've been involved in some pretty extensive negotiations with England and
    Germany and it's been bearing fruit.  E/G have agreed to call off their war
    and turn on Austria.  I'm going to have to give Germany Warsaw this turn,
    but it beats losing St Pete's.  I'll get it back shortly.  meanwhile, we
    have the resources available to make Austria pull forces back to face an
    attasck.  This should make it possible for you and I to make some headway in
    the Balkans and maybe even Austria itself.
    
    Given that my relationship with both England and Germany has been rocky at
    various points in this game (I saved England's bacon early in the game by
    stabbing Germany, only to have England promptly stab me!), I don't expect
    this new coalition will last much longer than is needed to keep Austria from
    winning.  I just figure it will give you and I the breather we need to grow
    a bit and become a force to be reckoned with.  That's my focus now - get you
    and I some centres and take Austria down.  We'll deal with the West at that
    point.
    
    Hope you're having a good holiday,
    
    Cal

    Hi Chris:
     I've got one of those rare chances to use the "enemy", E/R, to help
    our cause!  I
    have received numerous messages from Cal and Christian this turn,
    pleading with
    me to change sides again and turn the tide against you.
     I have played along with them, and now we can operate knowing what
    the enemy moves will be!
     Cal has offered to support my A Lvn-War with his A Mos.  By
    accepting, I now
    have a clear path to Stp, and you don't have to worry about Russia's
    mounting a
    supported attack on War.
     England has invited me to move F Bel-Eng, while he moves F Eng-Iri
    and
    F Nwy-Nwg.  He has also asked for my support for his A Spa, so that he
    can build
    a F Lpl and shift it up to Nao.
     Knowing all of this, I can freely move F Bel-Eng, F Hel-Nth and F
    Den-S-
    F Bal-Swe.  I will still direct A Gas-Mar to hopefully bounce your A
    Bur-Mar,
    while my A's Par and Pic dislodge your A Bur so that it can retreat otb
    and rebuild
    for the eastern front!
     You will still be free to take Spa with A Mar-Spa supported by F's
    Mao and
    Wms.  Unless, of course, France's F Gol supports English A Spa-- but
    they don't
    talk as if this is a possibility.
     This season we can at least break even if not pick up a dot apiece,
    and we can
    both advance positionally.  I can have England heavily on the ropes; you
    can support yourself to Gal and either attack Bul with two supports, or
    try for Smy.  You might get lucky!
     Russia should lose a unit, England may lose one, and Turkey might
    break even.
    Not a bad season, considering....
    
    Paul

    That looks pretty good to me.  Anything you do is going to be a bit of a

    Chris:
     I'm up and at work already at 3 am!  The internet seems to slow
    down mightily
    during "prime time" hours, and I just don't have the patience for it....
    
     Too bad England will get the build for Spain, but it was just as
    well that you
    wasted France if he wasn't going to play ball anyway.  Wild cards are
    not useful at
    this point of the game.
     Too bad also that I lost both Spain and Marseilles; but I think my
    yanking A Bur
    is the least painful of my options.
     England turned out to be less trustful than I was led to
    anticipate, but he DID
    give me Eng!  Bre and Bel are (for now) secure, and I can go for the big
    offensive
    starting with a multi-supported move to Nth this Spring.
     More later!
    
    Paul

    Yikes!  up at 3?!?  I at least have a baby as an excuse for being up at this
    hour!
    
    I haven't really been reading much mail or results lately -- but a removal
    of A Bur will certainly make me more comfortable, and wont Russia have to
    pull as well?  We should have a lock on spain again, too, shouldn't we?
    
    I am glad that we are able to keep working together despite the entanglement
    of our positions.  Rest assured that my prime concern is now clobbering
    Turkey.

    Sorry John, I think you saw it coming.  When you wouldn't help me take
    spain, I figured the old saw was true -- "The problem with toadies is you
    never know which way they're gonna jump."
    
    I think some people are trying to orginize a F2F in January, when emanuelle
    lorge is in town from France, I'll let you know details.  Also, are you
    planning on going to Prezcon, or, less likely, Armada's con in Denver?  I

    Mikal,
    
    Well, now you see what being big gets you -- enemies on all sides!  ;)
    
    All is not lost for us.  If you will build A ankara rather than F Smy, then
    I will support you into Rumania and Sev -- Russia is going down anyway --

    &gt; &gt; Turkey.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; I just set up the board.  I'll pull A Mun rather than A Bur.  That will enable:
    &gt; A Mar-Spa supported by my A Gas, you cut Por, and I move A Bur-Mar.  You
    &gt; should pick up Portugal in the Fall.
    &gt;
    &gt; Russia will be badly hurt by whatever removal he chooses (Ukr?).  If your A War
    &gt; supports my A StP-Mos, plus you hit Rum with support, one of those moves will
    &gt; have to succeed (unless Turkey supports Rum from Blk/Bul).  You can try a
    &gt; supported attack on Bul as well!
    &gt;      On the English front, I'll try A Pic to Lon (more to cut the English
    &gt; fleet's support
    &gt; for Nwy-Nth than in hopes of actually getting there).  I'll go for Nth with
    &gt; support,
    &gt; in high hopes of finally arriving in those fair waters!
    &gt;
    &gt;      The deciding factor in my sticking with you last season was:  I could pick
    &gt; on
    &gt; E/G without fear of much retaliation.  If I would have dislodged your A War, it
    &gt; could have fallen to Sil.  A's Sil and Bur would have attacked Mun and we'd be
    &gt; back where we were before we finally made peace.  Not worth it!
    &gt;
    &gt; Paul
    &gt;
    &gt; P.S.  My 99 year old grandma lives here with me.  She's in her second childhood
    &gt; (or headed in that direction), and is sometimes a hassle, but she pays my rent
    &gt; for
    &gt; me so I can bear things as they are.  The married brothers and their wives
    &gt; marvel
    &gt; that a single guy would take on this responsibility, but they declined the
    &gt; honors
    &gt; when it came to deciding where Granny should go.  Somebody had to step in (I
    &gt; despise nursing homes!).

    Hi Cal and Chris:
     When you guys cut my head off, how do you want it presented?
    
     Okay, I wimped out of the attack on Austria fearing retaliation and
    now I get
    this.
     But he Chris is looking for retaliation, here it comes.
    I'm removing F Balt for starters.  For the Spring, I'll chase the greedy
    b--- out of
    Bel and Mar.  Hel will move to cover Hol, and Den will man the fort in
    Kiel.
     A Stp will move to Lvn, and be available to participate in an
    attack on War.

    Again, I think it was a mistake by one year. You needed to get a fleet
    built, yes, but they have more than enough time with England's build to
    force you out of the MAO and thus prevent you from ever taking Spain, which
    is presumably #18 now that Germany has woken up. YUou will recall I did not
    ask to be in Spain, I wanted to be in MAR, which as you know I could never
    have used as a bargaining chip in staying alive (since you could always
    offer your support to Germany into MAR to make it a 3way). The point was
    that you needed one more unit on the front to stall their positioning until
    you could get the fleet you build this year to the front which takes 4 LONG
    seasons. I would not be surprised if they figure out some way to hold you to
    17 now, though I do wish you a victory esp since neither E nor G has played
    at the top of their game in this iteration.

    Whoa nellie!  Whats up?  You wrote and said you were going to pull a Bur,
    and then army Mun, and so I took Belgium -- you weren't going to pull
    otherwise!  Since you had a Spain annhialated last spring you were playing
    one short, right?
    
    Dammit.  I shouldn't do these things at 3 am when I haven't had any sleep.
    
    What else could you have meant?  I was going to build two if I pulled that
    unit, anyway!  but then you could have just taken Marsailles from me.  I
    can't hold Belgium OR Marsailles without your help -- nor did I intend to.
    I am not going for a solo with you, England, Turkey AND Russia breathing
    down my neck.  I didn't know what you were thinking, but you invited me into
    Marsailles in the first place.
    
    Why didnt you take spain from Gascony anyway?  Look, your position is no
    different now than it was at 3am when we spoke -- you pull one of your
    armies, and we take spain and Portugal from England, you take the north sea,
    and down england goes.  I went to bed (about 7 am, geez!) thinking I might
    end up getting that army convoyed to England!
    
    It looks like you didn't want me to retreat to Belgium.  But why did you
    volunteer to pull a unit then?  I dont get it.

    Hope everything is going well with the expanded fam!!
    
    I am sure canabalizing Russia would reap for myself short term benefits, but
    after venture is finished then what?  This goes back to the same concern I
    had from when I first reviewed the map before I signed on as a player, "how
    am I gonna get out of this hole with Austria blocking me in on every side?"
    U gave me a challenge of "workable and non-threatening plan".  I could not

    MiKaL,
    
    Actually, I DO have some thoughts on the matter.  The question I am asking
    is this:
    
    Is it possible for me to get a solo, or is it going to be a draw of some
    sort?
    
    Right now, I think we are looking at a draw.  I would be REAL surprised if I
    don't get trimmed back this year, at least it will take some serious good
    luck on my part not to go back down to 10.
    
    Ok, if it is to be a draw, then why not have you in it?  If it is E/G/A/T I
    think we have a good result, and if we can manage to lose either e or G in
    the process, even better.
    
    So, at 6 centers, I think you have a better chance of holding your own in a
    draw situation than at 4.  This is why I think you should take the chance --
    and if you are interested, we can certainly come up with a plan that leaves
    you at no more risk than you had leaving Bulgaria unsupported this turn!
    Good guess by the way -- I flipped a coin, what did you do?
    
    Best,

    &gt;
    &gt; Chris, if you wanted to make trouble for yourself, you couldn't have chosen a
    &gt; more efficient way to do it.   You said that you wanted to get the army out of

    &gt; back in the East; why couldn't you just have been content to do that?
    &gt;      I can't remember when I've been this angry over a stab.  Maybe I'll cool
    &gt; off
    &gt; once I'm back in Bel and Mar.  If I dislodge you from Bel this Spring and you
    &gt; retreated the damn army otb, it might do some good.
    &gt;
    &gt;      Right now, I've submitted F Bal as my removal.  I can't yank any armies

    may still do it.  The ONLY thing that makes me want to prolong my presence
    in this game is the fact that, as you mention above, you're new to the game

    Cal,  my stab was for StP and Swe--it was a two dot special that happens
    not to have worked.  (I considered E/R to be one power, if not one
    country.)
       It would have made sense if G/A were still solid, but now Austria pulled
    the
    topper of pathetic one center stabs with his move to Bel.  He was supposed
    to have
    retreated his A Bur otb and rebuilt it in the east.
    In one of my letters, I forgot that I had already suffered a removal
    for the loss of
    Spain.  I babbled about which unit I should remove this season.  Chris
    seized upon
    this mistake to presume that this constituted "permission" to retreat to
    Bel and make
    my removal a reality.  He claims this in all innocence.  We all know that
    such an
    excuse is insulting my intelligence to the max:  an ally would have written
    and
    said something like "do you want me to go to Bel, or am I misunderstanding
    you
    here?"
    
     I have already submitted "remove F Bal" for the winter.  I will move
    back to
    Lvn and be willing to support YOU to War if you want.  I will retake Bel
    with
    F Eng-Bel, and I'll move F Hel-Hol.  I will cover Bre with Gas, and try to
    move
    A Bur-Gas, A Mun-Bur so that I can support myself into Mar in the Fall.
     If this is not enough to satisfy you guys, besides the admission of
    guilt that I have
    already made, suggest something else.

    Cal,  I hope u will hang in there with me.  I feel if we stick together we
    can prosper.  There seems to be NO UNITY among any of the other players, and
    from my experience, that is what dominates boards, not stabbing every
    neighbor one has.  AUstria is currently fighting every other power and put
    out
    of contention the two that r gone.  So that is the end of my plea ...
    
    Sev is fine.  I will be endeavoring to gain control of the my surrounding
    seas and covering your back.

    &gt; &gt; Dear Cal,
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Germany tells me u have promised him to throw the game to Austria.
    PLEASE
    &gt; &gt; tell me this is not true.  I just got into this game and there is a lot
    of
    &gt; &gt; playing ahead.  I am willing to stick with u and crawl outta this hole
    &gt; &gt; together.  I will help u get your revenge on Germany later, but we gotta
    &gt; &gt; trim Austria down first.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Thoughts?
    &gt;
    &gt; My first thought is that I want to slap several people in the head.  This
    &gt; "demo" game has only dmonstrated that some supposed "experts" can play
    like
    &gt; stab-happy novices when the pressure is on.
    &gt;
    &gt; Yes, I DID tell Germany that I am going to throw the game to Austria and I
    &gt; may still do it.  The ONLY thing that makes me want to prolong my presence
    &gt; in this game is the fact that, as you mention above, you're new to the
    game
    &gt; and it wouldn't be fair to you.
    &gt;
    &gt; I'm planning on removing A Sev, unless you have any other preferences.
    Let

    &gt;Cal,  my stab was for StP and Swe--it was a two dot special that happens
    &gt;not to have worked.  (I considered E/R to be one power, if not one
    &gt;country.)
    
    This is absolutely ridiculous.  What could have possibly made you think
    this?  Hell, Christian was the first guy to cheap shot me in this game.  I
    only wanted to work with him so that Austria wouldn't win.  If you remember
    correctly, I did the same thing when I tried to get you and Austria to stop
    fighting so England wouldn't win.  I'm a small power, getting smaller, and
    all I want to do is stop anyone from winning until *I* have a chance to get
    stronger.  But I keep getting stabbed for one centre by "experts" who should
    know better.
    
    &lt;&lt;A number of stuff snipped about how hard done by you were by Austria for
    which my answer is "I told you so!"&gt;&gt;

    I will take you up on your offer of Warsaw, but ONLY because I think I owe
    it to Mikal to not throw a game in which he has just started and because you
    aren't the only one to make a, uh, "questionable"  stab this game.

    Paul,
    
    I am looking at it now,  the board I mean, and you're absolutely right.
    
    It was a idiodic move.  I can't imagine a worse one.  You said it yourself,
    it just buys me a passel of trouble.
    
    In the World Masters tournament, I have been dealing with a new-ish player
    in Russia, who has just made mistake after mistake.  When I finally
    confronted him, all he could say was "it seemed the thing to do at the
    time."
    
    I hope you can't believe that I would stab you for one center.  I mean, I
    was knocking on your gates with armies to spare, and backed off to preserve
    the balance of the game.  I don't know what I was thinking this morning at 3
    when you wrote.  I wasn't.  All I could think was that "Damn, he's just
    going to take Marsailles, and there isn't a thing I can do about it."  Then
    your letter came in, offering to pull Burgundy!
    
    Yes, I should have said, Exsqueeze me?  I should have just waited until I
    had some sleep (did finally get 3 hours at 7 am).  I'm still not at my best.
    I possibly have a big audition for a broadway show tomorrow, or Friday, I
    don't know yet.
    
    Can we repair this?  I mean, if you can believe that no one would do such a
    thing deliberately, then there is still room for us to work, I think.
    
    I am sorry to have angered you.  It has really been a pleasure getting to
    know you a little better, and just when we started talking about life, I did
    this stupid thing.  I am seriously considering asking for a replacement who
    won't throw this position away, that's how badly I feel about this.
    
    I have some thoughts.  If we were to work together, even on a you don't
    trust me within an inch of my life basis, we could really surprise some
    people.
    
    For example -- in order to take Marsaille and Bel, you;re going to need A
    Burgundy.  If you support Mars -&gt; Spain from Gas in the spring, and Bur
    supports pic-&gt; Bel, then you don't have to trust me to take Marsaille in the
    fall, you can force it.
    
    I am exhausted.  I jsut spend 10 mimutes looking at the map, and it makes
    sense to me.  We have some time.  Whatever you do, I hope you respect the
    work we did around Munich a few years back, and the trimming I helped you
    give england, not to lie to me.  I wasn't stabbing -- Cal's pithy comments
    aside -- but I cant say it was an honest mistake either.  the dot was there
    to retreat to, and I didn't ask questions that might have led you to change
    my understanding of your offer.  My fault.  I hath sewn the whirlwind, and
    I'll reap it if I have to.  Just let me know.
    
    I am trying to offer Turkey some russian centers in the effort to make this
    a 3 way draw -- TAG.  I guess we need to discuss how you see this game
    ending if we are going to work together further.
    
    Im rambling.  goodnight.

    Christian,
    
    Well, thats the best I can do -- mess up the attack on spain and retreat to
    Belgium.  Still, it should distract Paul long enough for you to get back on
    track.  4 Austrian armies showing up on Munich's doorstep won't please him
    much either, I suspect.
    
    AFAIAC, Spain and Portugal are yours as long as I have a fleet in the MAO.
    I will support you into the channel if you want, as well.

    Chris, I have cooled off now.  I can discuss this with you without flying off
    the handle on a dime!
     My removal for this Winter, under the present circumstances, is going to
    have to
    be F Baltic.  Much as I hate to diffuse my potency in the Scanda area, it is the
    only
    way that I can get E/R to let down their guard, even a little bit.  Also, I will
    want to
    keep the A's currently in Mun/Bur, "just in case" you make another bonehead
    assumption about what I "intend for you to do."  Let's both clear our moves with
    one another in advance, and we can prevent misunderstandings from now on.  Okay?
    
     If my A Gas supports your A Mar-Spa, it is with the understanding that I
    can
    follow up into Mar and keep that dot for Germany.  Right?
     If I dislodge your army currently in Bel, you will retreat it otb to
    diffuse tensions
    between us in the area.  You simply don't need another army in France if we are
    to
    repair our relations.  Okay?
     On the Eastern front:  have you considered supporting my A StP-Mos?  Cal
    may
    be vulnerable there this season, especially if my removal of F Bal lulls him to
    complacency.
    
    &gt;
    &gt;

    &gt; I am trying to offer Turkey some russian centers in the effort to make this
    &gt; a 3 way draw -- TAG.  I guess we need to discuss how you see this game
    &gt; ending if we are going to work together further.
    
    Let's try to keep Turkey contained so that we can finish with a two-way (G/A)
    draw here.  No use spreading the wealth so thinly.
     With such a jet-fast communication tool as email is, there need be no
    misconceptions lingering between us:  if you are tense about something I say,
    speak
    up.  I will do the same.  Such is the priviledge of our being equals, right?

    Rick did tell me that he was back in Connecticut for the Holiday.
    If I may be permitted to step in and offer a suggestion as the
    co-organizer of the game, perhaps you should all just wait to
    send in your build orders at least until Monday.  The judge
    has the grace period set to Tuesday.  By then, Rick should be
    back to set the next deadline properly.
    
    Didn't he also say something about setting the game so that you
    could request your own delays?  Someone might want to try
    setting the next deadline to Tuesday and see if it works.
    Heck, nothing ventured, nothing gained, I will try it.

    Paul,
    
    Thanks for both letters.  I will hopefully reply in some detail soon.
    
    I am planning on sending F Tunis back to the Emed area, and building two
    armies.  I think with your help I can punch Serbia into Bulgaria, and
    Galicia into Ukraine, which should break the whole line.
    
    I just hare building fleets as Austria it takes so damn long to get them
    anywhere.  I can't see Turkey kicking me out of the Ionian anytime soon, can
    you?
    
    Yes, if we go Mars -&gt; Spain I fully expect you to follow me up.  in the
    fall, I expect, since you would have to use F Eng chan to dislodge Belgium
    otherwise.  English F Spain is on the North coast, right?  With luck we'll
    annhilate that.
    
    As you said -- plenty of time.  Let me know if my plans aren't what you
    thought they would be, or if this changes information you thought you had
    previously.  The fleet build is the only one I think may be new -- I set up
    the board with Turkey with F Smy, and it just isn't a real threat.  he has
    to defend Bul, and two fleets + Army Greece can hold the Ionian forever.
    
    Gotta run. happy new year!

    The problem without  a fleet in the East is breaking through into the Turkish
    mainland.  It is darned clumsey to do it without two fleets--one in Aeg and the
    other in Ems.  Especially if the Sultan builds a fleet in Smy this Winter!
     Your building two armies is pretty threatening to me.  They could easier
    move
    to Tyr and Boh than they could to Russia and/or Turkey.  I'd feel safer seeing a
    
    F Tri for this reason, also.
    
    &gt;

    You don't mention retreating your A Bel otb, which is a condition for our future
    
    cooperation from my point of view.  I can sooner wait to enter Mar (i.e., in the
    Fall) than I can wait to see your A Bel out of my sight.  Surely you can
    understand

    Heading out the door --( I am working tonite, ack)  But sorry, yes,
    Retreating OTB from Belgium is definitely the plan.
    
    I'll look at the map again, regarding the fleet.  My thinking was that since
    I am in the Aegean allready, I can take Bulgaria, and once Sev collapses,
    Turkey can't defend Armenia and constantinople.  I'll look again.
    
    You re-take belgium and Marsailles, I take Spain and Portugal.  I support

    three days to protect against Y2K problems.  If you need a longer

    &gt;&gt; An exciting few days here.  My mother's computer got eaten by a virus,
    &gt;&gt; and by the time I can get back online, the Germans have taken my work
    &gt;&gt; computer down for Y2K.  If anybody has sent mail to me since last
    &gt;&gt; Tuesday, I have yet to read it, if it was sent to the DKFZ address
    &gt;&gt; (which is what the Judge has.)
    
    &gt;All of MY hassles this weekend are of a more personal nature.  I bought a
    &gt;new
    &gt;Pentium III 733MHz computer on Friday, and have been "personalizing" it
    &gt;ever
    &gt;since-- feeding in programs, typing in addresses and bookmarks, the like.
    &gt;     I had problems with my internet connections until this morning-- my
    &gt;ISP's service
    &gt;dept. was closed for the holiday (grrr!) but everythings up and running
    &gt;now.  That's
    &gt;why I chose a "long weekend" to buy the computer... there are always
    &gt;hassles to
    &gt;work out of!
    
    Am I the only one who actually spent the holidays having holiday? (Or in
    non-student terms: Am I the only one who only had to write three papers
    during holidays? :))

    Hi Christian!  Happy New Year!
     As you may have gleaned from the move results, Austria didn't stab
    me in the Fall-- he waited until the autumn retreat to give me a jab in
    the ribs with his going to
    Bel.
     Sigh.  Okay, I was a sucker to stick with Austria, and this is my
    payback.  Maybe I can still make up for it now?
     I have submitted a removal of my F Baltic as a show of "good
    faith".  My plan is
    to support myself to Bel in the Spring, cover Bre with A Gas, and move A
    Bur-Gas,
    A Mun-Bur, F Den-Kie and F Hel-Hol.  I have promised Cal that I will
    move
    A StP-Lvn and support him into War in the Fall.
     Most of these moves are designed to reassure you that I am now
    serious about
    fighting Austria.  My removal of the F Bal alone should be a pretty
    serious indication
    of my sincerity this time.  I expect to regain Mar and Bel, and to help
    you to keep
    Iberia.  Munich might be under some pressure if  Austria puts armies in
    Ruh, Tyr and
    Boh (or some combination of those) but I'll have to deal with this step
    by step.
     It's my mess-- I stepped in it!

    I wasn't sure what had happened to you.  I tried to set the deadline
    ahead after there was a request to push the Winter build season
    back until at least Tuesday or Wednesday.  The Fall season ran
    with a few late orders.  You did leave the game on moderated, of course,
    so my attempt to set the deadline ahead failed.
    
    There were some messages kiddingly asking Chris if he wanted to
    waive Winter builds if he didn't have time to think about them ;-)
    
    Welcome back from Y2K hell.  This computer that I am typing on now
    is a lame old P5-90mz and it sailed through Y2K, while my newer computer
    did a time reset to 1980.  Still, it seemed to fix pretty easily.
    I'll find out how my work computer does tomorrow.

    My answer:
    Paul,
    
    I am building F Lpl. Next turn I assume we will move like this:
    Germany:
    F Eng-MAO
    
    England:
    F IRI S (E) F Eng-MAO
    F Lpl-NAO
    F Por S Spa(nc)
    F Spa(nc) S (E) Eng-MAO
    
    This means you get into MAO and Chris has to retreat to WES or NAF to be
    sure to keep us out of Med. But even if he does retreat to one of those
    we have a chance to get through! Turkey will probably build a F Smy and
    therefore Chris may want to move Tun to ION. If he has only one unit to
    cover WES and NAf we are sure to get through by these moves:
    Germany:
    F MAO-NAO (yes, attacking my fleet!)
    England:
    F NAO-MAO
    F IRI S NAO-MAO
    This forces your fleet to retreat. Where to? To the space Chris didn't
    cover!
    If Chris covers WES/NAF with two units we can still choose to dislodge
    your fleet to get a new army in Ber/Kie/Mun. The opportunitys are ours if
    you capture MAO this coming turn. Keep in touch!

    Hello there Sultan!
    Is it too much to hope for a Turkish fleetbuild in Smyrna? That would indeed help the situation greatly. I see this game turning right now, and the t
    urn is in the ET-direction. Some opportunities for you, some for me. Together I am quite sure we can force a DIAS at some stage in this game, with or
     whithout Austria. But I do think it is important that you and me stick together whatever our other realtions are. You may stab Russia as you want, w
    ork with Austria as you want, but I think you and me need to keep the communication line open to always keep the opposrtunity to in one voice say "NO
    !, that's it. Let´s have a draw."

    Dear Christian,
    
    I feel u r correct in your message.  I am building a fleet in Smyrna and I
    would most enjoy any joint maneuvers that avail themselves.  I feel we have
    powers that can prosper at the expense of the powers "in the middle".  My
    main goal now is see the power of Austria diminished to manageable size.

    Okay, I'll postpone my attack on Bel and move to Mao as you suggest.  I'll
    bounce
    A Pic and A Gas over Bre, so that the Austrian F Mao doesn't retreat (or
    move) there.

    Austria is not going to be building another fleet this turn (he admits/brags)
    so all this
    plus the Turkish build should hurt his hold on the Med  shortly.  Plus,
    without another Eastern fleet, he will never break into Turkey.  He has
    finally bitten off more than he

    I hope to be marginally back on track.  However, I am having contractors in
    to renovate my kitchen and bathroom  (remember, I am in a one bedroom
    apartment in manhattan, so that isn't as big a deal as it sounds like!),
    sometime in the next two weeks, so If I drop off the map, I'll try to use my

    go off the air for tooo long!
