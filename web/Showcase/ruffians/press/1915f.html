    Cal,
    
    How about:
    
    f tun h
    f rom h
    f aeg - ion
    f gre s bul
    a bul s sev - rum
    f bla s sev - rum
    
    a sev - rum
    a ukr - gal
    
    u r guaranteed rum and a build, I can get a fleet out to help support my
    holdings.
    
    This will give me 2 builds, and u 1 build, setting Chris back a net of 2
    units, Christian back a net of one unit, Paul Even.
    
    We will control 13 units, 5 away from being part of the "final solution".
    
    Thoughts?

    &gt; Hi Meef!
    &gt;
    &gt; How does this look for the Fall?
    &gt;
    &gt; Turkey
    &gt; A Bul-Ser
    &gt; F Aeg-Bul(sc)
    &gt; F Gre s F Aeg-Bul(sc)
    &gt; F Bla s A Sev-Rum
    &gt;
    &gt; Russia
    &gt; A Sev-Rum
    &gt; A Ukr-Gal
    &gt;
    &gt; That should knock Chris down a unit or so and we get you Serbia next year.
    &gt;
    &gt; Any suggestions?

    Christian,
    
    What do you want?  I am really getting quite fed up with all this crap.  I
    will be attemping to take Sev with Turkish help.  If that doesn't happen, I
    AM throwing this game to you so hard you may have trouble catching it.
    
    May I suggest taking the Westmed, finally?  Convoy that army to Norway, will
    you?  I will hold Munich, and you should be able to take one of holland or
    Belgium, yes?

    Cal,
    
    We had a surprisingly good last season. I did not hear from Chris at all
    during last season.  He is wanting to talk pretty badly now.  I think I am
    gonna let him sweat until after winter adjustments before I reply.
    
    Austria trying to hold 3 fronts is costing him.  Maybe he did not expect
    much pressure from the south?!?!
    
    I would like us to get past the stalemate line around stp when feasible.  I
    do not see Austria and England being able to coordinate a defense against us
    with all the bad blood between them.  A breakout on the northern flank seems
    to me the best way to victory.

    Chris,
    
    Hm, I will surely be abel to catch it! :)
    
    I really don't want to discuss my exact moves but yes you will like them. I
    guess you should hold Munich because if I vacate Burgundy you don't get
    Munich. Regarding south, could you please not attack LYO. Supporting
    Marseilles should be anough, I can take it anyway if I really want. (No, I
    know, you have the chance to guess about cutting Burgundy or supporting
    Mar-Bur but nevertheless...)
    
    BTW, I feel quite sure this is going to happen:
    Russia:
    A Ukr-Gal
    A Liv-Pru
    A War S Ukr-Gal/Liv-Pru
    A Sev-Rum
    Turkey:
    F Bla S A Sev-Rum
    A Bul-Ser
    F Aeg-Bul
    F Gre S Aeg-Bul (to defend it from Rum-Bul supported by Ser)
    
    Yes, I do think they are still working together. Might be so obvious that
    they stab ? Anyway, this is what Turkey tells me will happen. Russia just
    says he´s going to build. I have a hard time convincing him to not build a
    fleet. He wants to get into BerKie or something.

    Hi Guys!
    
    I guess you´re taking Rum and securing Bul by attacking yourself with support?
    
    That means Chris will go down three centers this year!

    I think he counted on being able to break up the RT.  It's an endless source
    of frustration to him that he can't and that's probably our best reason for
    continuing our alliance!  We know that anything else but RT solidarity would
    be in Austria's best interest.
    
    &gt; I would like us to get past the stalemate line around stp when feasible.
    I

    seems
    &gt; to me the best way to victory.
    &gt;
    &gt; Thoughts?
    
    I agree with you that I eventually have to build more fleets up north.  I
    was quite nervous about Christian's being in Norway (although he did ask
    permission to retreat there) and I'm glad to see him moving off south.  I
    really think that ERT is committed to seeing Austria eliminated as a factor
    in this game.  We have to make sure that we're in position to control things
    once he's gone.
    
    My problem is the same as I had when Chris was bugging me about moving
    north.  I have to be able to build fleets fast enough that I can resist the
    inevitable counterattack which Christian will launch.  There's no point in
    building a fleet when the only thing that will happen is me being forced to
    pull into a defensive shell while England moves her massive navy north to
    attack me.  The way I see it, I have to wait until Austria is down to only
    three units or so and I KNOW I will be able to continue to press an attack.
    That will require a ready source of centres (hopefully Austrian home
    centres) that I can count on.  Let's work towards that end while continuing
    to level Austria (VERY compatible objectives).

    Hi Christian!  Many thanks for leaving St Pete's in Russian hands.  The way
    this game has gone, my paranoia nerve has been giving me a constant nervous
    twitch.  My wife is looking at me strangely these days...
    
    Anyway, I think by our moves, we can all tell that the committment to
    eliminating Austria is strong.  We'll continue that and end the game the way
    it should be ended (WITHOUT Chris! &lt;g&gt;)

    Mikal,
    
    This is possibly the most important letter I have written this entire game,
    and I want to get this just right.
    
    
    I say, Mikal, you seem to have violated the agreement we made, yet again.
    One is begining to get the impression that one cannot trust a word you say!
    
    I want this game to end in a draw.  England/Austria/Turkey.
    
    If you take Tunis, Rome, or Rumania from me this year, this game will end in
    an English solo.
    
    My removals will be Armies Kiel, Berlin, Munich, and Marsailles, followed by
    the fleets in Piedmont and Tuscany, if Christian decides he doesn't need
    them.
    
    Those centers, plus Holland and Belgium, make 17.  Do you really think
    Christian can't take StPete if he wants it?  Do you think you can STOP him
    from taking any of these centers, if I am assisting him?
    
    
    We can work together.  You do understand that the only reason I attacked Cal
    was because he was setting up to attack me.  He never had any intention of
    working against Christian, and has said as much to me.  I have NOT lied to
    you, nor have I done anything I said that I would not.
    
    Frankly, I don't expect you to listen to this.  You have had a bias against
    me from the first moves you made, and some people just wont change plans, no
    matter what.  I am appaled that you haven't written in the last season.
    This is a showcase game, and I feel you have a certain responsibility to
    those who are going to be looking at this to play well.  But on your head be
    it.

    Dear Chris,
    
    The reason I have not written u was I did not know what I should say.  I've
    lied to you every time I have written for several seasons in a row now and
    really did not want to continue that trend.  I am almost to the point of
    believing I can survive if Russia were to die.  Up until this point,  I have
    been and still am convinced, the death of Russia would lead to the death of
    Turkey also.  This year should change that.
    
    As far as you throwing the game to England, I would hope that would not
    happen since there is a lot of playing still ahead.  Turkey has NEVER been a
    respectable force in this contest until now and I would like for her to be
    part of the final solution in the game.
    
    I am finally out of my "hole" and want to continue to grow, working toward
    some sort of a draw at the end of this game.
    
    You have in your power to throw the game and I hope that will not be the
    case.  You have a tough diplomatic nut to crack here and I am looking
    forward to see how to tackle the task at hand.  Your reputation DEFINITLEY
    proceeds you.  Your name has been a hot topic recently in the w99 board,
    speaking of your ftf tourney and email tourney performances.
    
    Please bear in mind I am way out of my league in this game and am a student
    at the feet of the great ones.
    
    Thoughts?

    Mikal,
    
    I have had to wait until now to write --0- the baby during the day and work
    until now.  Sigh!
    
    &lt;&lt; reason I have not written u was I did not know what I should say.  I've
    lied to you every time I have written for several seasons in a row now and
    really did not want to continue that trend.  &gt;&gt;
    
    
    Ok,  I understand not wanting to gratuitously lie again.
    
    &lt;&lt;am almost to the point of
    believing I can survive if Russia were to die.  Up until this point,  I have
    been and still am convinced, the death of Russia would lead to the death of
    Turkey also.  This year should change that.&gt;&gt;
    
    I understand your concerns -- between Cal, Roland(the italian) and myself,
    Turkey has been stuffed until now.  However, my statement remains true.  If
    you take ANY of Tunis, Rome, or Rumania this turn, or if Cal Builds, I will
    throw this game to Christian.
    
    &lt;&lt; far as you throwing the game to England, I would hope that would not
    happen since there is a lot of playing still ahead.  &gt;&gt;
    
    Exactly as much play as you want to give it.  I dont think I can be any
    clearer, and I am not in the habit of throwing games -- but I have given you
    far to much for ZERO return so far, and it ends right here.
    
    &lt;&lt;You have a tough diplomatic nut to crack here and I am looking
    forward to see how to tackle the task at hand.  Your reputation DEFINITLEY
    proceeds you.  Your name has been a hot topic recently in the w99 board,
    speaking of your ftf tourney and email tourney performances.&gt;&gt;
    
    Hmmm, Thanks I think.  I just was eliminated from my worldmasters board.
    F2F i havent won a con since Dixiecon last year, and that i think, is the
    only one I have won -- two years running, but I cant make it this year.  I
    think I am a stronger F2F player than Email, honestly.  Same for Christian,
    I think.  What have people been saying?
    
    &lt;&lt;ease bear in mind I am way out of my league in this game and am a student
    at the feet of the great ones.&gt;&gt;
    
    Hah!  Tis to laugh.  No one on this board is so good that they cant be beat.
    
    &lt;&lt;houghts?
    
    Meef&gt;&gt;
    
    Let me re-iterate.  This is the season you turn on Russia, or its all over
    for Ruffians.  I don't think it will take 2 years for Christian to take the
    7 centers he needs for the win if I vacate Germany with the winter disbands.
    Particularly as I will keep all my units on the Russian front, and he can
    quickly send fleets through into the baltic.  Plus, I will start giving him
    tactical advice.
    
    Dont lie to me at this point, really.  What would be the point?  If you
    don't believe I'll do it, call my bluff, and take the dots.  Rumania will be
    supporting A Bul -&gt; Sev, and Serbia supporting Rum.  unless you tell me that
    Ukraine is hitting Rum, in which case, I think you should support me in to
    sev, and take Rum behind me -- that would be fine.  So long as Cal loses
    another unit this year, it doesn't  matter.  You can have Rum, Sev, and
    Greece for the rest of the game as far as I am concerned -- the important
    thing is you getting to Iberia with fleets.  Take Tunis and Rome with the
    units which will be following up.
    
    I cannot do anything else to make your position secure.  My fleets are on
    land, on the other side of italy.  I only have two armies in your vincinity,
    and you have the perfect, uncuttable ability to hold the centers that they
    are adjacent to.  Turkey will not now be eliminated from the game -- but we
    may all lose, except Christian, depending on the orders you submit this
    year.  It all hinges on you now, and you're playing with the big boys
    weather you like it or not!  ;)  Seriously, your play has been good,
    defensive, you stood by Cal when you needed to, took the loss of Greece to
    get me off your back, and now are in MUCH better stead than any of the
    players who had Turkey before you (and Cyrille was a world champ himself!)
    You are doing fine, and I believe you will see that it is time for Cal to
    go.  He is no longer necessary for Turkish security, or to hold the north --
    because I can now hold Munich against all comers.
    
    Let me know what you think.  Seriously, even if you are calling my "bluff",
    put it on paper so that the world can see what you were thinking!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Interesting letter from Chris.  He has a point in that you probably could
    survive without me at this point but where he is mistaken is in thinking
    that he can throw the game to Christian.  Even if he does remove all his
    armies in Germany, Christian is unlikely to be able to take advantage of
    them - at least not to the point of getting 18 centres.  He is not going to
    get Tunis and, if I'm around and growing, he will not get St Pete's.  That
    will preclude him from getting past 17 centres.  It's ironic, but *I* have a
    better chance of throwing the game to Christian because, while Chris can
    give him more centres, I can give him the strategic (IE geographic) leverage
    he needs to force that final 18th centre.  The difference is, I'm not
    threatening to do it.
    
    Right now, Christian is very afraid of being perceived as a threat to go for
    the solo.  Certainly, he's thinking it, but he also feels that, if he moves
    on the north and/or expands into the Med too quickly, then ART will drop
    their differences and turn on him.  I don't think he realizes the
    unlikelihood of that happening, but it's the only thing that explains his
    reluctance to move into the Med in force or, for that matter, attack me in
    the north.  Lord knows, he has the resources for it if he decides that's
    what he wants.
    
    I'd say, call Chris's bluff (probably better NOT to tell him though) and let
    the chips fall where they may.  We're still looking at no worse than a three
    way and I think we can break across the stalemate line.
    
    RT solidarity has worked well for us.  Certainly, *I* need it more than you
    do, but it's still going to be more profitable together than apart.

    I personally would rather see Christian win the game that I be bullied or

    in a good rt relationship.  I am going to sit on my reply to Chris until

    Dear Chris,
    
    I do not think u r bluffing.  I think u r gonna throw the game.  SO i have
    come up with and idea that may best suit your purposes (please, do not laugh
    out loud and wake your baby :) )
    
    Throw the game to Turkey.
    
    That way all the champions are still champions.  If some no name, no talent
    gets beginner's luck, then everyone will dismiss it as a fluke and your
    reputation remains undamaged.  THe same would not be if Christian won, he
    would be Champion of Champions.
    
    What do u think about this idea?  My fingers are crossed u will like it.

    work
    &gt; until now.  Sigh!
    &gt;
    &gt; &lt;&lt; reason I have not written u was I did not know what I should say.  I've
    &gt; lied to you every time I have written for several seasons in a row now and
    &gt; really did not want to continue that trend.  &gt;&gt;
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Ok,  I understand not wanting to gratuitously lie again.
    &gt;
    &gt; &lt;&lt;am almost to the point of
    &gt; believing I can survive if Russia were to die.  Up until this point,  I
    have
    &gt; been and still am convinced, the death of Russia would lead to the death
    of
    &gt; Turkey also.  This year should change that.&gt;&gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; I understand your concerns -- between Cal, Roland(the italian) and myself,
    &gt; Turkey has been stuffed until now.  However, my statement remains true.
    If
    &gt; you take ANY of Tunis, Rome, or Rumania this turn, or if Cal Builds, I
    will
    &gt; throw this game to Christian.
    &gt;
    &gt; &lt;&lt; far as you throwing the game to England, I would hope that would not
    &gt; happen since there is a lot of playing still ahead.  &gt;&gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Exactly as much play as you want to give it.  I dont think I can be any
    &gt; clearer, and I am not in the habit of throwing games -- but I have given
    you
    &gt; far to much for ZERO return so far, and it ends right here.
    &gt;
    &gt; &lt;&lt;You have a tough diplomatic nut to crack here and I am looking

    &gt; Hmmm, Thanks I think.  I just was eliminated from my worldmasters board.

    &gt; only one I have won -- two years running, but I cant make it this year.  I
    &gt; think I am a stronger F2F player than Email, honestly.  Same for
    Christian,
    &gt; I think.  What have people been saying?
    &gt;
    &gt; &lt;&lt;ease bear in mind I am way out of my league in this game and am a
    student

    &gt; Let me re-iterate.  This is the season you turn on Russia, or its all over
    &gt; for Ruffians.  I don't think it will take 2 years for Christian to take
    the
    &gt; 7 centers he needs for the win if I vacate Germany with the winter
    disbands.
    &gt; Particularly as I will keep all my units on the Russian front, and he can
    &gt; quickly send fleets through into the baltic.  Plus, I will start giving
    him
    &gt; tactical advice.
    &gt;
    &gt; Dont lie to me at this point, really.  What would be the point?  If you
    &gt; don't believe I'll do it, call my bluff, and take the dots.  Rumania will
    be
    &gt; supporting A Bul -&gt; Sev, and Serbia supporting Rum.  unless you tell me
    that
    &gt; Ukraine is hitting Rum, in which case, I think you should support me in to
    &gt; sev, and take Rum behind me -- that would be fine.  So long as Cal loses
    &gt; another unit this year, it doesn't  matter.  You can have Rum, Sev, and
    &gt; Greece for the rest of the game as far as I am concerned -- the important
    &gt; thing is you getting to Iberia with fleets.  Take Tunis and Rome with the
    &gt; units which will be following up.
    &gt;
    &gt; I cannot do anything else to make your position secure.  My fleets are on
    &gt; land, on the other side of italy.  I only have two armies in your
    vincinity,
    &gt; and you have the perfect, uncuttable ability to hold the centers that they
    &gt; are adjacent to.  Turkey will not now be eliminated from the game -- but
    we
    &gt; may all lose, except Christian, depending on the orders you submit this
    &gt; year.  It all hinges on you now, and you're playing with the big boys
    &gt; weather you like it or not!  ;)  Seriously, your play has been good,
    &gt; defensive, you stood by Cal when you needed to, took the loss of Greece to
    &gt; get me off your back, and now are in MUCH better stead than any of the
    &gt; players who had Turkey before you (and Cyrille was a world champ himself!)
    &gt; You are doing fine, and I believe you will see that it is time for Cal to
    &gt; go.  He is no longer necessary for Turkish security, or to hold the
    north --
    &gt; because I can now hold Munich against all comers.
    &gt;
    &gt; Let me know what you think.  Seriously, even if you are calling my
    "bluff",
    &gt; put it on paper so that the world can see what you were thinking!
    &gt;
    &gt; Best,
    &gt;

    Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
    
    Intruiging.  I am willing to consider the possibility.  I THINK England
    could stop you from a solo, even with my help -- but it would be an
    interesting excercise, and it would fulfill my requirements of Teaching Cal
    a Lesson.
    
    Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.
    
    Two things:  In order for me to commit to this, you must give me something.
    Cal must die, and now.
    
    How does this sound:
    
    You support me into Sev.  Take Tunis, but  move Rome -&gt; Naples.  Follow me
    into Rumania with the Army.
    
    This will give you a foot in the door, access to my home centers, and ensure
    that I can take Cal down.  Next year, we could stage your stab of me.  I
    would leave Budapest open, or something.
    
    But Cal Must Die, and Now.  I like your idea -- it would suit me to a T to
    have you continue to succeed where all other Turks have failed before you.
    There would be a lot of play, and good play to be had in the future.  But I
    will not do it if Cal lives.  Call it an irrational fixation on my part, but
    there it is.

    Chris, what is the godawful hatred u have against Cal?  U r not letting
    personal feelings get in the way of sound judgment are you?  I know I am a
    mere serf, but that is a bit
    disconcerting.
    
    Also, I DO NOT think this game be thrown to Turkey with the quick demise of
    Russia.
    
    Let cooler heads prevail and let US talk further about this matter.

    Meef,
    
    What are you thinking then?  I really have little beef with Christian -- we
    have had so little to do with each other.  Cal, otoh, has decided to work
    against me, even though he knew I was essential to a draw.
    
    So, basically, since you have (consistantly) NOT done what you have told me
    you were going to do, I see no reason to help you rather than Christian,
    unless you are willing to help me first.  It will be a major coup for me if
    you turn on Cal at this point, and that would be enough satisfaction for me.
    
    Your point about "Champion of Champions" is well taken -- I have a big
    enough target on my head without having one more label to work past.  So,
    there are two acceptable endings here, for me -- A draw, or someone else's
    solo.
    
    Either way, Cal has got to lose Sev this year, and not gain another center.
    Otherwise, no deals, no bargains, nada, zip.
    
    You want something from me, I want something from you -- I think we can do
    buisness here, but it all depends on how badly you want from me -- I can
    live with throwing the Game to Christian.  You have come up with a viable
    alternative, and that's great, but it'll have to start out on my terms, not
    yours.  After that, you can call the shots, afaic.
    
    So, I will be moving to Sev from Rumania.  If you support me in, and don't
    take BOTH of Tunis and Rome, I will be willing to work with you to your
    greater benefit -- and if Christian can't stop you, more power to you for
    getting the solo -- I'll even let you take my centers, but that may not be
    enough.
    
    What 18 do you think you can take?  17 I can see easily enough, but 18
    involves getting to and holding Munich, and that will be tough.

    Chris,
    
    I WILL NOT solo w/ a stab of Russia this season.  So how can we approach
    this problem and leave Russia around long enough to make it happen.  Can we
    not speak of greys not just black and whites?  This bad blood, can not this

    There is no way to break the stalemate line from naf - stp w/o a northern
    fleet and neither Austria or Turkey has that ability.  W/o Russia the best
    we can hope for is a draw, worst, English solo.
    
    So we must be creative here and utilize the resources we have or an English
    solo is most likely what will happen anyway whether u throw the game or not.

    Emperor Chris,
    I guess we are at an impasse.  I am glad I gotten to run with the big dogs
    for at least a few seasons (thanks Rick is u r reading this).  I have
    learned a ton playing with u and I appreciate the conversations we have had.
    Give Christian my congrats.  I guess it is not really fair some upstart
    replacement player win anyway since this is showcase for champs.  Maybe I
    will c u at a ftf tourney sometime or play in an email game from the
    beginning where my hands have been tied from the beginning and has NO CHOICE
    but to be on the other side of the trenches from you.  Bless u in your
    endeavors.

    Chris, Cause I am giving away the only chance I have of victory in this
    game.  I believe we can work this out but stabbing Cal this season is
    sealing my fate.  The reason I have stabbed and lied 2 u since my first
    message with u is not because I normally play that way but was the only way
    to crawl out of the hole my 2 predecessors put me in.  Working with Russia
    up until this point and a little further into the future is the ONLY HOPE I
    have had.  I believe if u were honest with me, u would agree.  See my
    point!!  It has NOTHING to do with personalities, it has EVERYTHING to do
    with working out a workable plan.  Several season back u challenged me with
    a statement "give me a workable plan" and although I have not divulged all
    my ideas, 2 things I came up with that point were:
    
    1.  Get out of this hole at whatever cost
    2.  Keep Russia around long enough to get on top of the situation.
    
    Come on let us have some fun with this one.  Help me beat all the champions
    and I will go back into obscurity and u can retain you WELL DESERVED
    reputation as champion.
    
    By giving Christian the game now it will pitiful little stab of Cal.  A much
    more painful one could happen later, but it will take some patience.  Good
    things never come easy, but I believe you will be able to look back on this
    game and relish the thoughts much more if you work with me and take the slow
    course.
    
    But either way, I have had fun playing with you.  Bless u in your decision.
    
    Meef

    &gt;Prepare to catch!  Turkey will not turn on Russia, so it looks REALLY good

    Well, knowing you, I will regard this as a diplomatic trick...but, if you

    I do not believe that.  I believe I have a better chance at a draw with
    Russia than Austria.  BUT I believe I have a better chance for a victory
    with Austria and Russia for a season.  I believe I will have a big goose egg
    stabbing Russia this season.
    
    I do not understand why u will not move from this "kill Russia" or "throw
    the game" stance.  What is a couple of years gonna matter to Austria?
    
    Unless u believe if I stab Russia, Austria can still solo.  Hmm, let us
    explore that thought, eh? I've been straight w/ u.  Come clean! :)))

    Whoops -- used singon.  Doh!
    
    Meef,
    
    Hubris.  It's my weakness.  Pride.  I try to keep it in check.
    
    &lt;&lt;I do not believe that.  I believe I have a better chance at a draw with
    Russia than Austria.  &gt;&gt;
    
    I believe this is wrong.  Please explain this to me.
    
    If all you want is a season, why you may certainly have it.
    
    I think I was pretty clear -- if you take Rome or Tunis, or Support Russia
    into Rumania, I will pull my armies in Germany.  If not, then not.
    
    If you just want Russia for another season, then do none of the above.
    
    I can't be more clear than that.  I believe, and it is merely that, my
    belief, that you can share a draw with me, or lose to an English solo.
    
    A solo for me?  That's the thing that really bites my butt.  How could you
    think that, after I have removed my fleets, and GIVEN you Naples, Tunis, and
    Rome?  I have deliberately crippled my chances at a solo -- all to make you
    comfortable.
    
    But you think a 4 center russia, without any units near England's, is more
    likely to keep England from winning than ME?  Please, please, please,
    explain your thinking here, because I just dont see it.  You didn't respond
    to my point that I am across the NAf-StP stalemateline, either.  What of
    that?
    
    At this point, however, my moves are in.

    If you would please disband A Marseilles and A Ruhr. Then we could try to
    stop Meef right away and take Hol+Bel while you and I are bouncing in Kiel
    to prevent retreats. That would gives us a stalemate in the Med and

    Ladies and Gentlemen:  It time to play
    
    CALL MY BLUFF!
    
    I include for your perusal, the text of a message from Austria to Turkey!:
    
    &lt;&lt;Mikal,
    
    This is possibly the most important letter I have written this entire game,
    and I want to get this just right.
    
    
    I say, Mikal, you seem to have violated the agreement we made, yet again.
    One is begining to get the impression that one cannot trust a word you say!
    
    I want this game to end in a draw.  England/Austria/Turkey.
    
    If you take Tunis, Rome, or Rumania from me this year, this game will end in
    an English solo.
    
    My removals will be Armies Kiel, Berlin, Munich, and Marsailles, followed by
    the fleets in Piedmont and Tuscany, if Christian decides he doesn't need
    them.
    
    Those centers, plus Holland and Belgium, make 17.  Do you really think
    Christian can't take StPete if he wants it?  Do you think you can STOP him
    from taking any of these centers, if I am assisting him?
    
    
    We can work together.  You do understand that the only reason I attacked Cal
    was because he was setting up to attack me.  He never had any intention of
    working against Christian, and has said as much to me.  I have NOT lied to
    you, nor have I done anything I said that I would not.
    
    Frankly, I don't expect you to listen to this.  You have had a bias against
    me from the first moves you made, and some people just wont change plans, no
    matter what.  I am appaled that you haven't written in the last season.
    This is a showcase game, and I feel you have a certain responsibility to
    those who are going to be looking at this.  But on your head be
    it.&gt;&gt;
    
    As Someone once said -- "Most solo's are thrown, not earned"
    
    Here we go!

    Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Chris's math off?  Christian will have to

    Just so you know, I never did "admit as much" to him about not attacking

    remember what I told you about us needing fleets up north eventually?

    For a guy threatening to pick up his toys and go home, this isn't a topic he
    wants to return to too often...  &lt;g&gt;
    
    What do you think for builds?  I'm wavering between A Mos & A Sev.  What do
    you figure for your builds?  Same as last time (except with the fleet in
    Smyrna)?
    
    I'd say our prime goals right now are:
    
    1) R/T sticking together;
    2) Making sure Tunis is not put in danger;
    3) Keeping an eye on England;
    4) Taking Chris down as fast as possible so his ability to cause mischief is
    limited by a lack of units.

    I just want to make it clear I DID have a counter proposal to Chris' "stab
    Russia NOW or English solo" ultimatum.  And I quote,
    
    "Dear Chris,
    
    I do not think u r bluffing.  I think u r gonna throw the game.  SO I have
    come up with and idea that may best suit your purposes (please, do not laugh
    out loud and wake your baby :) )
    
    Throw the game to Turkey.
    
    That way all the champions are still champions.  If some no name, no talent
    gets beginner's luck, then everyone will dismiss it as a fluke and your
    reputation remains undamaged.  The same would not be if Christian won, he
    would be Champion of Champions.
    
    What do u think about this idea?  My fingers are crossed u will like it.
    
    Meef"
    
    So I fail to see what the big problem is.  That is a VERY SOUND proposal.
    Somebody enlighten a poor lost soul here.  Come on, Chris, Rick, Cal, Paul,
    Christian, former players, observers speak up, this new kid is here to grow
    from this experience.  What am I missing?

    I think you should all try to throw the game to Paul instead of Meef
    or Christian.  That would be much more interesting to watch.  But
    don't let him take any home SCs back!  He's got to get to 18 dots with
    only the two fleets.

    Well, if we're going to worry about Chris & Christian's reputations, then
    *I* have a sound proposal of my own!
    
    Throw the game to Russia!
    
    See, I've ALSO never won a World Championship, just a couple of Canadian
    ones.  So no reputations would be damaged!
    
    Also, since this IS a demo game (as Chris likes to point out (although
    that's not a point *I* would harp on when I'm about to throw the game)),
    think of what conceding to Russia would do for future generations looking at
    the game reports?  They'd say, "Why in the world did they do that?  Is there
    something I'm not seeing?"  Well, yes, there is!  See, it would make us look
    like Russian Grandmasters in chess, you know, the ones who make three moves
    and lay down their Kings?  Talk about a game for the ages!
    
    So c'mon, whaddya think?

     we see which player is eliminated next [ditto for the next one])

    Hey gang,
    
    What point in threatening to throw if you aren't going to throw?  I gave
    Meef puh-lenty opps to prevent this -- We even discussed ways that he could
    have the solo thrown to him.  But he wouldn't make even one concession.
    
    And, since he came into this position with the decision to fight Austria
    (even though I was the one who gave him the chance to be in the game at all,
    anyone remember his first spring as Turkey?) and hasn't let up on that

    of this game, so I won't.  Well, just two more statements ;-)
    
    1) If you like I would raise the probability that Austria is eliminated
    next..... ;-)
    
    2) The first game in this series (ghods) ended in a thrown win, anyone

    I think Chris is gonna wind up looking pretty goofy.  I agree totally w/

    E/A still have to finish off Germany and I do not know how well Christian
    and Chris will jive.  Chris likes to be in CONTROL and I do not know if u
    can throw a game and still be in control.
    
    This game has turned out pretty fun.  Chris is one frustrated guy.  Maybe
    his play works well in ftf but email play is a lot different that ftf.
    
    I broadcast part of what I said to Chris, giving him all these asinine
    ideas.  Playing w/ him a little.  He kept playing hard ball.  I played the
    stupid newby.
    
    O well
    
    Let us grind him to powder.  I would like to put him completely out of the
    game.  You will probably get to put the final bullet in his head.

    &gt; &gt; Those centers, plus Holland and Belgium, make 17.  Do you really think
    &gt; &gt; Christian can't take StPete if he wants it?  Do you think you
    &gt; can STOP him
    &gt; &gt; from taking any of these centers, if I am assisting him?
    &gt;
    &gt; Correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't Chris's math off?  Christian
    &gt; will have to
    &gt; take Tunis if he wants the win and I can't see that happening even WITH
    &gt; Chris's help.
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt; We can work together.  You do understand that the only reason I attacked
    &gt; Cal
    &gt; &gt; was because he was setting up to attack me.  He never had any
    &gt; intention of
    &gt; &gt; working against Christian, and has said as much to me.  I have
    &gt; NOT lied to
    &gt; &gt; you, nor have I done anything I said that I would not.
    &gt;
    &gt; Just so you know, I never did "admit as much" to him about not attacking
    &gt; Christian.  Obviously, he's right that I wanted to attack Austria
    &gt; first, but
    &gt; remember what I told you about us needing fleets up north eventually?
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt; I am appaled that you haven't written in the last season.
    &gt; &gt; This is a showcase game, and I feel you have a certain responsibility to
    &gt; &gt; those who are going to be looking at this.  But on your head be
    &gt; &gt; it.&gt;&gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; For a guy threatening to pick up his toys and go home, this isn't
    &gt; a topic he
    &gt; wants to return to too often...  &lt;g&gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; What do you think for builds?  I'm wavering between A Mos & A
    &gt; Sev.  What do
    &gt; you figure for your builds?  Same as last time (except with the fleet in
    &gt; Smyrna)?
    &gt;
    &gt; I'd say our prime goals right now are:
    &gt;
    &gt; 1) R/T sticking together;
    &gt; 2) Making sure Tunis is not put in danger;
    &gt; 3) Keeping an eye on England;
    &gt; 4) Taking Chris down as fast as possible so his ability to cause
    &gt; mischief is
    &gt; limited by a lack of units.

    Hi guys.  I just thought we should get this game-throwing threat out in the
    open.
    
    Christian, quite frankly, Meef and I don't think you CAN solo, even with
    Chris' help, but it could be awfully close and my gut instinct doesn't like
    taking chances.  Well, not those sort of chances anyway.
    
    I guess I'm writing to find out if you're still onside with us and are
    willing to call the game as a three-way once Chris and Paul are out.  What
    assurances (by that I mean tactics) are you willing to use to keep Meef and
    I from feeling too nervous?
    
    Looking forward to your reply.

    Meef, Cal,
    
    Chris writes long letters to me telling me he is throwing the game to me.
    He says he´s disbanding armies in Berlin and Ruhr and that he will use his
    fleets to stop you Meef. As I have said before, I am looking for a
    three-way. I know that if the opportunity arises for me to have a solo I
    will of course go for it, as would all good diplomacy-players.
    
    To make sure this doesn't need to happen, I am willing to not move further
    than you two allow me. I have said so before but none of you told me where
    I might go and where I might not go so I just assumed my moves hence has
    been OK.
    
    I will build a new army in Edi as the army in Ruhr were disbanded. I need
    those little armie to secure my continental centers.
    
    I feel quite sure that Chris is actually going to try to throw the game to
    me so we need to play it very careful. What could be more fun than this...:
    
    1) Chris wants to win th game
    2) Chris cannot win and therefore decides that another player should win.
    Chris does his uttermost to achieve this.
    3) This other player doesn't win solo and Chris once again doesn't get what
    he wanted!! :)
    
    Anyway, I will not move further into Med this turn and I will not convoy an
    army to Nwy. I will move my fleet Ska to Sweden to be able to move to Bal
    in the fall. I assume Meef will give centers of his own to Russia if I
    should stab Russia to help you stalemate me.
    
    Really, I am willing to obey your commands! Let me hear where you want me
    and where you don't want me. I want Chris and Paul out, that´s it! I don't
    know what more to tell you to make you two trust me enough. What do you
    want me to say?
    
    all the best
    Christian

    well I sent an EOG to the GM in 1902 predicting England would get a solo out

    problem with our continuing to talk even though I have no pieces. After all,
    it is not a no-press game so everyone can talk with everyone :)

    &gt;will of course go for it, as would all good diplomacy-players.
    
    I'd be surprised if you did anything different.  One of the reasons for the
    letter I wrote was to put it in the open that we're ALL aware of that.
    
    &gt;To make sure this doesn't need to happen, I am willing to not move further
    &gt;than you two allow me. I have said so before but none of you told me where
    &gt;I might go and where I might not go so I just assumed my moves hence has
    &gt;been OK.
    
    I think that if you keep your promise to stay out of the Med, we'll be okay.
      Let's make the elimination of Austria our priority.  You and I can split
    the German home centres (once Chris is down far enough that I can get some
    armies onto German soil) and Meef can take Austria down in the Med.
    
    &gt;I will build a new army in Edi as the army in Ruhr were disbanded. I need
    &gt;those little armie to secure my continental centers.
    
    No problem.  Obviously, the continued demilitarization of Scandinavia
    remains on the agenda.
    
    &gt;I feel quite sure that Chris is actually going to try to throw the game to
    &gt;me so we need to play it very careful. What could be more fun than this...:
    &gt;
    &gt;1) Chris wants to win th game
    &gt;2) Chris cannot win and therefore decides that another player should win.
    &gt;Chris does his uttermost to achieve this.
    &gt;3) This other player doesn't win solo and Chris once again doesn't get what
    &gt;he wanted!! :)
    
    Heh heh, that's the game plan all right!
    
    &gt;Anyway, I will not move further into Med this turn and I will not convoy an
    &gt;army to Nwy. I will move my fleet Ska to Sweden to be able to move to Bal
    &gt;in the fall. I assume Meef will give centers of his own to Russia if I
    &gt;should stab Russia to help you stalemate me.
    
    Hmmm, as long as this isn't accompanied by an army in Norway, I can live
    with that.
    
    &gt;Really, I am willing to obey your commands! Let me hear where you want me
    &gt;and where you don't want me. I want Chris and Paul out, that´s it! I don't
    &gt;know what more to tell you to make you two trust me enough. What do you
    &gt;want me to say?
    
    Nothing more than you have said.  I think the three of us are on the same
    wavelength.  Let's just go out and execute the plan as outlined.
    
    Regards,

    Well, England maybe... &lt;G&gt;
    
    Seriously, I'm STILL having trouble geting used to what seem like lightning
    quick deadlines for builds.  No, Rick, I'm NOT complaining, it's just that
    with the leisurely pace of the Spring and Fall deadlines, the Winter ones
    have a tendency to sneak up on me.

    (Who NOW has his builds in)
    Death to Austria!
