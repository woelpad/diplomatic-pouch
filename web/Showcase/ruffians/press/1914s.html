    Cal.  hhhhhh.  I thought you'd do that.  ;)
    
    Ok.  My plan is to push into the Ruhr in the spring, so move to Berlin now,
    is a go, K?
    
    It seems that an army in Finland is the next logical step.  Thoughts?

    Meef,
    
    Ugh. South coast?  That's not according to plan.  well, not much I can do
    about it, right?
    
    Ok, here is my thinking.  I had originally suggested
    
    F Ion -&gt; Tun
    F Aeg -&gt; Ion
    
    This still looks good to me, followed by
    
    F Tun -&gt; Naf
    F Ion -&gt; Tunis
    
    It commits you to the Atlantic push, gives you a center for home D, and
    leaves me feeling warm and fuzzy.  ;)
    
    I am assuming you will want to move F Smy -&gt; Con to support Bul in the fall.
    I would much rather you did that than moved Smy -&gt; Aeg.  Again, that would
    just make me really, really nervous.
    
    In the Fall, I will move F Greece -&gt; Ionian, and we can bounce in Greece if
    you want, with Rumania hitting Serbia.  I know this is all rather elaborate,
    but it really is starting to take shape.    Let me know your thoughts.  You
    mentioned at one point that you would feel too strung out -- I hope that my
    unit placement has done a little to alleviate that feeling, and that we can
    balance that with my feeling of being exposed!  ;)

    Cal,
    
    Chris's latest at bottom.
    
    It appears we r on track with:
    
    1.  r/t stay solid
    2.  Keep Austria headed away from us.
    3.  Not alienate England.
    4.  Get Tunis and Ber w/o alienating Chris.
    5.  Keep England at bay.
    6.  Creep forward without minimal alarm
    7.  Keep Austria confused.
    
    I am thinking
    
    F Ion -&gt; Tun
    F Aeg -&gt; Ion
    
    followed by
    
    F Tun -&gt; Naf
    F Ion -&gt; Tunis
    
    is good 4 us.
    
    F Smy -&gt; Con to support Bul in the fall.
    
    seems reasonable also.
    
    If we gain tun and ber this year, I will feel pretty good about our
    position.  I would be nice to rig the f tun - naf to bounce and I have a
    fleet in tun, ion at the beginning of 1915.
    
    Thoughts?

    Friends,
    
    Cal, could you do me the favour of moving StP-Livonia? That would make me
    feel securer when the fall arrives...:)
    
    I will now enter Med (or atleast try) I hope that is OK with you. I do not
    know why Paul kept the fleets and disbanded an army, he probably thinks
    Chris is telling the truth again.

    You can say that again.  Dammit, I was hoping for F Sev.  or F StP (nc)!  ;)
    
    If you will remember a few years back, I was in a situation with Italy,
    where we were fighting the English.  I had stabbed him, but he was still
    alive, and in fact, his position was quite playable.  But, he wouldn't work
    with me.
    
    I feel like we are in a similar situation.  I have stabbed you, but your
    position is not dead.  Your fleets especially are important in keeping
    england out of the Med.
    
    So, at this juncture, I would like to offer you what aid I can, and what aid
    you want.  I will continue to support Denmark from Kiel, if that is what you
    desire.  I am planning on entering the Ruhr, unless you do not want that.
    If you would support me into Marsailles, I would aid you on that front as
    well.
    
    Looking at the map, I think the centers that you have which are defendable
    are Denmark, Holland, and Belgium.  With my army support, England should be
    unable to force those three.
    
    I didn't want to eliminate Italy -- but he would not work with me in reduced
    circumstances.  It'd my judgement that you are perhaps more practical than
    that  You cant get revenge on me later if you are eliminated by England!  ;)
    
    Let me know to what extent you are interested.

    Yeah, I'll take the support in Den, and your A Ruhr might prove useful in
    keeping
    Hol/Bel alive.
    
    &gt;
    &gt; If you would support me into Marsailles, I would aid you on that front as

    At least you're still talking to me!  Okay, you have the support to Mar (again).

    &lt;&lt;Well, I think that it is Christian himself who is AFRAID of entering the

    Well, you wont hear me complaining!  ;)
    
    &lt;&lt;Yeah, I'll take the support in Den, and your A Ruhr might prove useful in
    keeping
    Hol/Bel alive.&gt;&gt;
    
    I hope so.  Ok, support for Den it is, and Mun -&gt; Ruhr.
    
    &lt;&lt;At least you're still talking to me!  Okay, you have the support to Mar
    (again).&gt;&gt;
    
    One of the biggest mistakes I see people make is stopping talking.  I hope
    there is ALWAYS something to talk about.  Even if it is non-dip related.
    One of my main complaints about dip tourneys is that there isn't enough time
    alloted to get to know the other players.  DixieCon has a bar-b-que night,
    and that is one of the reasons I love the con.
    
    It'll be A Piedmont moving, with F GoL hitting spain to cut support.  Thanks
    again.

    Chris,
    
    I know you have promised Turkey Tunis in exchange for him stabbing Russia.
    I am sure he will not stab Russia.
    
    You and I both want this to be over to be able to spend time with our
    little ones. Let´s take Paul out this year and suggest a fourway to RT.
    
    Here is my proposal:
    Austria:
    A Pie-Rom
    F Lyo C A Pie-Rom
    F Trn C A Pie-Rom
    A Kie S (English) A Swe-Den
    A Ber S A Kie
    A Mun-Ruh
    A Boh whatever
    A Bud whatever
    A Trl-Mun
    F Greece-ION
    
    England:
    F Mar hold
    F Spa(sc) s F Mar
    F MAO-Wes
    F Eng S A Lon-Bel
    A Lon-Nth-Bel
    F Ska S A Swe-Den
    A Bre-Par
    A Swe-Den
    
    This way I capture Belgium or Paris this turn, you get Bel or Hol in the
    fall. Also you can take Naples or Tunis back depending on where he goes. If
    he moves to Nap you take it back with Rome and TRN, if he moves to Tunis I
    support you with F Wes AS LONG AS YOU DIDN'T TRY TO WORK WITH PAUL AGAIN.
    What do you think?
    
    all the best
    Christian
    PS Why did you waive the build???

    now,
    &gt; is a go, K?
    
    Okay.  Any preferences for my other armies?  I think a followup from War-Pru
    would look good to Christian, do you think?
    
    &gt; It seems that an army in Finland is the next logical step.  Thoughts?
    
    That, I really don't follow as an army build would not make sense and doing
    that and then moving to Fin would leave St Pete's open.  Unless, of course,
    this is a thinly veiled attempt to get me to pull my southern armies back?

    Yup.  looking good, but it's still a tightrope we're on.  We have to take
    Chris down while not leaving Christian the pening to bottle us up on the St
    Pete-Tun line.  Somehow we have to cross it, especially on land.

    &gt;

    I like it a lot.  I believe we can work something out with Christian to
    arrange that Naf bounce.  Once that's done, we can probably make our big
    grab at Chris.
    
    I'll write later with anything I hear.

    I will not enter with force, I need to support Marseilles preventing Chris
    from getting it with an army. All it takes is one of you whisepring in
    Chris´ ears that I am not supporting myself. That would mean a bounce and
    that one of you get some credibilty towards Chris. Good?
    
    Meef, what do we do? I guess you will go for Tunis, if that is what Chris
    "promised" you. That way you will still be able to stab him alternatively
    if he bounces you in Tunis you can always claim "look, I did ¨what we agreed".

    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Meef,

    &gt; Ugh. South coast?  That's not according to plan.  well, not much I can do
    &gt; about it, right?
    &gt;
    &gt; Ok, here is my thinking.  I had originally suggested
    &gt;
    &gt; F Ion -&gt; Tun
    &gt; F Aeg -&gt; Ion
    &gt;
    &gt; This still looks good to me, followed by

    &gt; F Tun -&gt; Naf
    &gt; F Ion -&gt; Tunis
    &gt;
    &gt; It commits you to the Atlantic push, gives you a center for home D, and
    &gt; leaves me feeling warm and fuzzy.  ;)
    &gt;
    ...
    
    My thought is to accept and follow that plan exactly.  I request that u
    position yourself to keep me out of naf so where I can be in tun and ion at
    the end of this year.  I will gain a build and have control of Ion.
    Thoughts on how to proceed?

    &gt; I will not enter with force, I need to support Marseilles preventing Chris
    &gt; from getting it with an army. All it takes is one of you whisepring in
    &gt; Chris´ ears that I am not supporting myself. That would mean a bounce and
    &gt; that one of you get some credibilty towards Chris. Good?
    &gt;
    &gt; Meef, what do we do? I guess you will go for Tunis, if that is what Chris
    &gt; "promised" you. That way you will still be able to stab him alternatively
    &gt; if he bounces you in Tunis you can always claim "look, I did
    &gt; ¨what we agreed".
    &gt;
    &gt; all the best
    &gt; Christian

    &gt; Meef,
    &gt;
    &gt; Ugh. South coast?  That's not according to plan.  well, not much I can do
    &gt; about it, right?
    &gt;
    &gt; Ok, here is my thinking.  I had originally suggested
    &gt;
    &gt; F Ion -&gt; Tun
    &gt; F Aeg -&gt; Ion
    &gt;
    &gt; This still looks good to me, followed by
    &gt;
    &gt; F Tun -&gt; Naf
    &gt; F Ion -&gt; Tunis
    &gt;
    &gt; It commits you to the Atlantic push, gives you a center for home D, and
    &gt; leaves me feeling warm and fuzzy.  ;)
    &gt;
    &gt; I am assuming you will want to move F Smy -&gt; Con to support Bul
    &gt; in the fall.
    &gt; I would much rather you did that than moved Smy -&gt; Aeg.  Again, that would
    &gt; just make me really, really nervous.
    &gt;
    &gt; In the Fall, I will move F Greece -&gt; Ionian, and we can bounce in
    &gt; Greece if
    &gt; you want, with Rumania hitting Serbia.  I know this is all rather
    &gt; elaborate,
    &gt; but it really is starting to take shape.    Let me know your
    &gt; thoughts.  You
    &gt; mentioned at one point that you would feel too strung out -- I
    &gt; hope that my
    &gt; unit placement has done a little to alleviate that feeling, and
    &gt; that we can
    &gt; balance that with my feeling of being exposed!  ;)

    I just got an interesting letter from England -- in it he says "I know you
    promised Turkey Tunis in exchange for a stab of Russia!"
    
    This is a beautiful piece of dis-information.  Did it come from you or Cal?
    And moving the fleet to Con will only serve to re-inforce the idea.

    Christian,
    
    Well, you must think I'm a pretty good diplomat if I can convince Turkey to
    give me Greece this year in return for stabbing Russia next year + Tunis.
    And he pulled F Black Sea -- yep, yep, he and I are in Cahoots!
    
    &lt;&lt;You and I both want this to be over to be able to spend time with our
    little ones. Let´s take Paul out this year and suggest a fourway to RT.&gt;&gt;
    
    This is certainly true.  I have zero time right now.  Have you felt Cal out
    about the four way?
    
    I am looking at the map -- the moves look good . . .  Let me see if I can
    cover my back while I do this.

    Cal,
    
    Troubling, troubling news.  Christian approached me yesterday, and said,
    "hey, lets finish this thing off.  We can eliminate Paul and set a four way
    draw."
    
    So far no problem.  Then he says "I know you promised Meef Tunis in exchange
    for stabbing russia.  But I am sure he wont stab Russia!"
    
    hmmmm.
    
    I deny everything, saying "yeah, sure, He'd give me greece for tunis, and
    pull F Black if he was stabbing Russia."   however, I say, hmm, could do the
    eliminate Paul thing.
    
    Ok, he writes back, and says "Cal should be willing to go for the 4 way,
    once its clear we (A/E) aren't fighting.  Oh, and btw, Meef tells me he is
    going to do the Tunis thing but not the NAF thing, if you know what I mean."
    
    Meef, in the meantime, has said "Ok, I'll be moving as planned.  Ionian -&gt;
    Tunis, Aegean -&gt; Ionian, and in the Fall Ionian -&gt; Tunis, Tunis -&gt; Naf."
    
    I can't think of any reason YOU would reveal all of this to Christian.  I
    mean, you don't want me ignoring Christian, giving him time and resources in
    the north, right?  So Meef is playing Me two ways.  And in turn, playing US
    two ways.
    
    I come to you with this, because I really don't want to move on Meef without
    you, If I am to move on him at all.  I know you are going to look at all of
    this with a grain of salt.  Ok, maybe a whole salt lick.  But if Meef is
    planning on stabbing me, I am planning on stopping him.
    
    I am going out of town (For ARMADA in denver and some swing workshops I am
    teaching.  I will be aroung tomorrow, and back monday.  I hope we can work

    &gt;Message from tremewanc@worldnet.att.net as Austria to Russia in 'ruffians':
    
    &lt;Lotsa stuff about Meef consorting with the enemy snipped&gt;
    
    &gt;I can't think of any reason YOU would reveal all of this to Christian.  I
    &gt;mean, you don't want me ignoring Christian, giving him time and resources
    in
    &gt;the north, right?  So Meef is playing Me two ways.  And in turn, playing US
    &gt;two ways.
    
    &gt;I come to you with this, because I really don't want to move on Meef
    without
    &gt;you, If I am to move on him at all.  I know you are going to look at all of
    &gt;this with a grain of salt.  Ok, maybe a whole salt lick.  But if Meef is
    &gt;planning on stabbing me, I am planning on stopping him.
    
    Well, it doesn't surprise me that Meef would be talking to Christian, but
    I'm a bit surprised he'd be saying THAT sort of thing to him.  I won't lie
    to you: Meef HAS discussed the possibility of stabbing you with me and,
    while I've considered it, I've tried to talk him out of it.  My reasons are,
    for once, the obvious ones: I can't risk you coming back on me with the
    armies you now have in Germany and, if that DID happen, Christian would have
    a chance to sweep through the German centres you vacate.  Once he crossed
    that line, he'd have a shot at the 18 (I have no illusions about my ability
    to keep him out of St Pete's if he wants it back).
    
    If Meef IS planning to stab, I haven't been told of it.  I'll sound him out
    and, once again, try to talk him out of it. Meanwhile, you cover your butt.

    Christian,
    
    just got back from Manus's convention in denver, and I was looking at the
    board.
    
    What you say makes sense.  I can't see Russia and Turkey not taking a 4way
    at this point, if we eliminate Germany this year.  I am ok with your plan
    except for one thing --
    
    Please do not move to the Westmed.  The move will bounce.  I will handle the
    turkish situation myself -- is that ok?
    
    &lt;&lt;Here is my proposal:
    Austria:
    A Pie-Rom
    F Lyo C A Pie-Rom
    F Trn C A Pie-Rom
    A Kie S (English) A Swe-Den
    A Ber S A Kie
    A Mun-Ruh
    A Boh whatever
    A Bud whatever
    A Trl-Mun
    F Greece-ION
    
    England:
    F Mar hold
    F Spa(sc) s F Mar
    F MAO-Wes
    F Eng S A Lon-Bel
    A Lon-Nth-Bel
    F Ska S A Swe-Den
    A Bre-Par
    A Swe-Den&gt;&gt;
    
    All of this is fine, as I say, except the Westmed part.  In fact, I'd REALLY
    prefer MAO -&gt; Portugal or Gascony if you really intend a 4 way.  It would
    make the whole thing much more believable to me.
    
    What say you?

    Christian is trying to cut a deal with me.  I have strung him along, and
    this is the info I have gleaned:
    
    &lt;&lt;Here is my proposal:
    Austria:
    A Pie-Rom
    F Lyo C A Pie-Rom
    F Trn C A Pie-Rom
    A Kie S (English) A Swe-Den

    As you can see, the North sea is being left unsupported.  This leaves two
    possibilities:
    
    Dislodge the North Sea from Belgium  ;)
    Dislodge it from Helgoland Bight..
    
    This is some form of a convoy paradox, isn't it?  If you support from
    belgium, your support would be cut by the attack from london, but that
    attack never arrives because the convoy is disrupted, right?
    
    Well if you don't want to take a chance on it, I would support from
    helgoland bight and move from Belgium.  He could retreat to Holland, but
    will almost certainly retreat somewhere more prosaic, like Edi.
    
    What do you think?

    &gt; Well, Bel-Nth supported by Hel is the obvious choice.  Knock em out of Nth and
    &gt; force him to support Edi as a home dot (he can't build in Hol).
    &gt;      If you're not moving to Mar, then I cover Paris with A Bur.
    &gt;      With this show of E/A amity, why does Christian profess this belated need

    Chris,
    
    You need to tell me more specifically what you intend to move like if you

    I can agree not to go there if you show me a PLAN you´re having.

    Fair enough -- Unless someone leaks something to Turkey, he will be moving
    to Tunis, not Naples.  As you discerned, that was the plan.  I will move G o
    Lyon to Westmed, and bounce his followupmove to the Ionian.  In the fall, I
    will drive him out of Tunis, forcing a retreat OTB or to North Africa.  I'll
    propose the 4 way to him then.

    Sounds like we are thinking along the same lines -- however, I had been

    result of you supporting me into Marsailles, I could let you into Munich in

    This in fact was MY question -- he claims it would be to help me oust Turkey

    If you arent going to support me to Marsailles (and I respect that it is

    &gt; &gt; &gt;Christian,
    &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;&lt;I can agree not to go there if you show me a PLAN you´re having.
    &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt;Okey?&gt;&gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt;Fair enough -- Unless someone leaks something to Turkey, he will be
    &gt; moving
    &gt; &gt; &gt;to Tunis, not Naples.  As you discerned, that was the plan.  I will
    move
    &gt; G o
    &gt; &gt; &gt;Lyon to Westmed, and bounce his followupmove to the Ionian.  In the
    fall,
    &gt; I
    &gt; &gt; &gt;will drive him out of Tunis, forcing a retreat OTB or to North Africa.
    &gt; I'll
    &gt; &gt; &gt;propose the 4 way to him then.
    &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt;Does that sound reasonable?

    Cal,
    
    I changed my moves as listed below.  Do think this is ok or am i goofing up
    and should go back as agreed with Chris.  I know Chris is looking to stab
    me.  Christian could be double-crossing me, but I KNOW that is the way Chris
    operates.
    
    Should u issue an order such as a rum s bul with no attack on Chris,
    hopefully he will just be angry with me and stay off of your back and give u
    ber as promised (for what that is worth)?
    
    Should u issue an order such as a rum - ser, and we go back to the
    negotiating (or lying) table with Chris?
    
    Thoughts?

    &gt; Cal, latest of Chris' plots.  What do u think about f ion - nap and beat
    him
    &gt; to the draw?
    &gt;
    &gt; Meef
    
    I didn't really want to move this early, but it's becoming pretty obvious
    that England is leaking everything we tell him to Austria.  That includes
    the plan to bounce you in North Africa in the Fall.  It might not be a bad
    idea to cross them both up.
    
    The downside is twofold: 1) we're not THAT ready to stab Chris and 2) it
    could throw the two of them into bed together.
    
    What do you think?

    I'll order A Rum to support F Bul and then, if you don't get Greece, I'll
    use it to cut A Ser support in the Fall.  I think I could use the credit
    with Chris for the one extra turn to hold or take Berlin.

    &gt; I'm back from Denver.  It was fun, but I am stressed.  What word from the

    Not much.  Christian is, I assume, doing the new Dad thing and hasn't
    written and Meef and I haven't exchanged letters in the last several days.
    Guess it's one of those periodic lulls.
    
    One thing I meant to ask you about from well before you left: Christian has
    asked me to move the St Pete fleet to Livonia as a sign of goodwill.  Just
    wanted to know your feelings on that.

    Oh, BTW, Chris and Christian: as Daddy's, you get forced to do everything
    with babies just "to be fair", but as a granddaddy, you're not even trusted

    should

    Is it just me, or didn't we agree to DMZ Ukraine AND Galicia?  I mean, the
    whole Idea here was to get the three of us working collectively against
    England -- but you seem to want to make concession after concession to
    him -- south coast, move to livonia.  When I bring a (I think) very valid
    concern about meef to light, Nada.  you wont even move the army back to Sev,
    As you agreed you would?
    
    &lt;&lt;?).  I WILL move Ukr-Sev.  I'd like to see Gal back in Vie.  Is this
    copascetic?
    &gt;&gt;
    
    I am asking you to stick to this one.  Galicia is in Bohemia, and moving
    towards the Boot.  I just cant keep sending armies away from home without
    some security.  If you are in Sev, and Meef bails into naples, i will at
    least have SOME hope of you moving to Armenia as a retaliatory gesture.  At
    the very least I can threaten it.  ;)
    
    You did agree that you would move back to sev.  I thought we were pretty
    clear that the plan for the fleet in StPete was to menace England, and
    distract him from sending forces south.  I am starting to smell RaT here, if
    you know what I mean.  Reassure me.  ;)

    Cal,
    
    Just opened up my map to see what your problem might be.  I think I see your
    concern now.
    
    Its that I would roll Bohemia right back into galicia, while taking Rumania,
    leaving you outflanked in the south.
    
    hhhm.  ok.  I was pretty focused on breaking through into France, but I can
    see as how those armies are making you nervous.  If I move Bud -&gt; vie in the
    spring, and then maybe back in the fall, would you -- in the fall -- move
    Ukr -&gt; Sev?  I want to work something out in the south.
    
    Until we agree on something in the south, and unless it's REAL clear to me
    that your next build will be F stP (NC!)! I am going to hold in Berlin.
    
    Fair enough?

    The light dawns.  You have the potential with all those little red armies,
    to hit me pretty hard should you choose.  I understand your nervousness, but
    I think you can understand mine as well. Don't forget, *I'm* the guy who has
    had his home centres occupied by four other countries this game...  I come

    If you do it this way, I have absolutely no objection.  Simply remove the
    potential threat to Rum for one turn and I can slip into Sev and support Rum
    from there, no problems.

    &gt; that your next build will be F stP (NC!)! I am going to hold in Berlin.
    &gt;
    &gt; Fair enough?
    
    Now you're talking my language.  The fleet on the North coast will be built.
    With two fleets and an army that I'll move up there, I can honestly mount an
    offensive. The single fleet that you wanted me to build last time wasn't
    enough.  A second fleet is a real factor that I can be quite happy with.
    
    I'll ask you the same question: fair enough?

    Gentlemen,
    
    If I understand the situation rightly Chris gains Rum and looses Greece and
    Nap this year (or if he retreats to Tus with Lyo he kan keep Nap and Rom

    Well, at least in some part, though it is really my fault for letting Turkey

    In any case, I haven't looked at the board too closely, but I think I was
    right when I said that the correct alliance structure at this point was R/A
    vs E/T -- remember I said that?  Still interested?  I do have a plan, and
    it's one that doesn't involve Austrian occupation of Russian home centers.
    However, it DOES involve trusting me to act in my own best interest,
    something Meef seems incapable of doing.

    Cal,
    
    I think Christian and Chris are about the same as far as trustworthy.
    
    This is how I see it:
    
    Austria / Germany are plotting against England
    Austria / Germany are plotting against Russia
    Austria / Germany are plotting against Turkey
    Austria / England are plotting against Turkey
    Austria / England are plotting against Russia
    Austria / England are plotting against Germany
    Russia / England are plotting against Austria
    Russia / England are plotting against Germany
    Russia / Turkey are plotting against Austria
    Russia / Turkey are plotting against Germany
    Turkey / England are plotting against Austria
    Turkey / England are plotting against Germany
    Turkey / Russia are plotting against Austria
    Turkey / Russia are plotting against Germany
    Turkey / Russia are allies
    
    How in Heaven's name am I supposed to sort this out?
    
    All this double-crossing head games we are playing is giving me a headache.
    
    I guess u r gonna have to fight for Berlin.
    Looks like Christian tipped me and Chris off.
    
    Any ideas on how to proceed.

    Chris,
    
    This is the most double crossing game I have ever been associated with.  I
    would like to plead innocence in the same way you insinuate but that is
    ridiculous.  All I ask is u stick with the plans we settle on instead of
    going to every other player on the board plotting how u can "dupe and stab"
    the Sultan. :))
    
    Thoughts on how to proceed:
    
    summer:
    f gol retreat to pie
    
    fall:
    Turkey to keep Nap and Gre
    Austria to keep Mar and Tun
    (even trade)
    
    Winter:
    Turkey build 2 fleets
    Austria disband 1 fleets
    (the way we had planned all along)
    
    Next year:
    Austria fights with armies in the North
    Turkey fights with fleets in the south
    
    Now that is a plan that has potential!!!!!!!!!!
    
    As far as I am concerned, no harm no foul.
    
    Ally Meef (even more courteous than ever)

    &gt; Gentlemen,
    &gt;
    &gt; If I understand the situation rightly Chris gains Rum and looses
    &gt; Greece and
    &gt; Nap this year (or if he retreats to Tus with Lyo he kan keep Nap and Rom
    &gt; but then looses Mar again). I think we can take him down in a few years if

    &gt;
    &gt; I think Christian and Chris are about the same as far as trustworthy.
    
    Now THAT'S damning with faint praise... &lt;g&gt;
    
    &gt; This is how I see it:
    &gt;
    &gt; Austria / Germany are plotting against England
    &gt; Austria / Germany are plotting against Russia
    &gt; Austria / Germany are plotting against Turkey
    &gt; Austria / England are plotting against Turkey

    &gt; Russia / Turkey are plotting against Austria
    &gt; Russia / Turkey are plotting against Germany

    &gt; Turkey / Russia are plotting against Austria
    &gt; Turkey / Russia are plotting against Germany
    &gt; Turkey / Russia are allies
    &gt;
    &gt; How in Heaven's name am I supposed to sort this out?
    
    Tylenol is good.  I think our best bet is to simply assume all the above and
    make sure we remember the last one.  It's the only thing that's going to
    keep us healthy and viable.
    
    &gt; All this double-crossing head games we are playing is giving me a
    headache.
    
    Se above re: Tylenol.
    
    &gt; I guess u r gonna have to fight for Berlin.
    &gt; Looks like Christian tipped me and Chris off.
    &gt;
    &gt; Any ideas on how to proceed.
    
    Well, Chris has already written asking me to stab you in return for him
    backing off from my home centres.  I'm going to have to tell him I'll go
    along with it, but there's not a snowball's chance in hell I'm going to
    change sides now.
    
    Nice work with Gre & Nap.  Let's keep the advantage rolling and I'll try to
    hang on to enough centres to help you get stronger.
    
    I'll let you know what Chris has to say.

    &gt;
    &gt; This is all your fault.  ;)
    
    Sorry, this habit you have of stabbing and getting stabbed all on the same
    turn is one you developed years before you met me...
    
    &gt; Well, at least in some part, though it is really my fault for letting
    Turkey
    &gt; out of the Box.
    
    Uh huh.
    
    &gt; In any case, I haven't looked at the board too closely, but I think I was
    &gt; right when I said that the correct alliance structure at this point was
    R/A
    &gt; vs E/T -- remember I said that?  Still interested?  I do have a plan, and
    &gt; it's one that doesn't involve Austrian occupation of Russian home centers.
    &gt; However, it DOES involve trusting me to act in my own best interest,
    &gt; something Meef seems incapable of doing.
    
    Y'know, each time you stab me, you lessen the validity of your argument
    about me attacking Turkey.  He's the one guy I can actually trust to do what
    he says he's going to do.
    
    I'm willing to listen to your plan for backing off Russian home centres (and
    that includes Rumania, buddy. I didn't just fall off the cabbage truck...)
    and I might even consider carrying through the attack on England, BUT one
    move against War or Rum and I throw everything at *you*, English victory be
    damned.
    
    Your move,

    Meef,  (And I use this name accordingly!)
    
    I was thinking the same sort of thing.  You might be interested to know that
    I didn't approach anyone about double-crossing you last year -- (Well, ok,
    Cal and I continued our dialogue about the perils of working with turkey,
    but I don't count that!  We both know where we stand there at this
    oint.)  -- Christian actually approached me with a grand plan for holding
    you off, predicated on the idea that I would help him into German dots.  I
    agreed, stringing him along, and found that you had revealed the details of
    our agreement to him!  ;(
    
    Or, to quote Christian "he said he would be doing the Tunis thing, but not
    the North Africa thing"
    
    So, I went to Cal, and said, can you believe this?  'Cause I can't!
    
    &lt;&lt;ll:
    Turkey to keep Nap and Gre
    Austria to keep Mar and Tun
    (even trade)&gt;&gt;
    
    I like the way you give me things I allready have in exchange for things you
    are taking from me, and call the exchange even.  ;)  That is a real
    diplomacy skill!   Nonetheless, Greece and "a mediteranean dot" were to be
    yours this year, so, as you say, no harm, no foul.
    
    Shall we work out details in a more detailed fashion?

    Cal,
    
    Well, I did tell you I would do something about Turkish perfidy, didn't I?
    This was all I could do -- put a lot of leverage on you!
    
    &lt;&lt;I'm willing to listen to your plan for backing off Russian home centres
    (and
    that includes Rumania, buddy. I didn't just fall off the cabbage truck...)
    and I might even consider carrying through the attack on England, BUT one
    move against War or Rum and I throw everything at *you*, English victory be
    damned.&gt;&gt;
    
    CARRY THROUGH??  You call StP south coast and a move to Livonia an attack
    against England!?!  I only should hope you attack ME so effectively!  ;)
    
    Seriously.  IF there was a fleet in NC as we discussed, you would be in
    Berlin now.  Heck, if you were in the Gulf of Friggin Bothnia, we wouldn't
    be discussing this.  But NO, Can't piss England off by actually moving to a
    province adjacent to a SC he controls, he might, he might -- He might come
    and try to take StPete Back!  Well, you've Pissed Austria off instead, and I
    assure you I can do more than TRY to take your dots!  (Deep breathing.  Deep
    breathing.  Too many uncles dead of heart attacks in their 30s)   ;)
    
    Seriously.  I refuse to believe you didn't have a part in the Turkish "ahem"
    alteration of the plan.  I came to you with valid concerns, in an attempt to
    determine how far I could expect you to go to work with me, and the answer
    was an unequivical nowhere.  I would MUCH rather be in Munich and the Ruhr
    than Galicia and Silesia, but if this is the only way to guard my southern
    flank, to occupy it with My armies, well so be it.
    
    I am sure you don't like the above, but you're going to like the rest of
    this even less.  My plan is this:
    
    A Silesia Retreat OTB
    
    Fall --
     Support A Serbia -&gt; Bulgaria (thus guaranteeing I wont attack Rum.)
    A Prussia -. Warsaw
    A Ukraine S A Prussia -&gt; Warsaw
    F Livonia -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia
    
    winter -- Build F StPete NC.
    
    Thats the deal.  Become aNorthern Fleet power and you have nothing I want or
    need.  Keep your armies to fight me and I will (ahem, shades of Kruschev
    here) I will Bury you!  (Imagine the shoe banging on the computer, if you
    will)

    Well, ladies and germs, I think this game may be coming to it's logical
    conclusion.
    
    For the last several game years, Chris has been threatening to throw the
    game to Christian if Russia/Turkey didn't roll over and die.  Based on his
    actions this turn and subsequent e-mails to me, I can only believe that this
    is exactly what he is doing.  I figure we may as well save some time and get
    on to other games.
    
    I'm hereby proposing a concession to England.  Please vote with your Fall
    orders. I'll cast my vote here in public as a yes.  Nice game, Christian!

    If you can explain how trying to get you to fight England constitues a
    concession to him, I'd like to hear it.
    
    I had a decent shot at a solo a few years back -- when you were on the
    ropes, remember?  I decided Germany had a Better Shot than I did, and took
    what I thought to be appropriate measures.
    
    Now it is England who is a threat, and again I am trying to fight him.
    
    Ok, -- I retract my offer to lay off Rumania.  I will take Rumania -- the
    rest of the plan remains the same.  Retreat those two units off the board,
    build a F StPete NC, and I will go no further.
    
    I dont' expect you to go for that.  But, looking at the Map, I dont think
    there is alot you can do about it anyway.  You go to four this year, and
    anything you pull reduces your ability to resist me.  Warsaw should go next
    year, and probably two dots in 1916.  Assuming Christian hasn't poached
    StPete any sooner, and that Turkey doesn't ask for Sev -- which I would give
    him.
    
    I don't want you to die -- I wouldn't be talking to you if I did.  I want
    you to acknowledge that you are at my mercy, and agree to my terms of
    surrender, or spit in my face and tell me you'll die first!    We are not
    military equals, nor should we negotiate as if we were.
    
    my terms are remove two armies and re-build F StP (NC) or I will try to
    eliminate you.  I have every expectation of succeeding if I try.  You are a
    wily and respected opponent, and I know such a battle would not be easy.
    But it is FAR preferable to the hedging and carping about that we have had
    recently.

    Meef,
    
    A Plan we can both stick with?  How about this.  Every time I take a Russian
    dot,, you take a Mediterranean dot.  I take Sev, you take Rome.  I take
    Warsaw, you take Tunis.
    
    I will be taking Rumania this turn.  I will not trust Cal any further --
    this whole F StP (sc) fiasco has gone too far.
    
    You I can work with -- I am looking for a good draw here.  If you build
    nothing but fleets, as you propose, then My fleets will try to help push
    yours forward.  Spain and the MAO shouldn't be impossible, given enough
    time.  If they are, then we still have a good 3way draw.
    
    What do you think?

    Hey Guys....
     We all know that G/A had England seriously on the ropes, and we
    could have
    taken him out in a couple of seasons.  We had R and T similarly beset.
    But Austria
    decided to stab G (again), and threw in the towel on the English,
    Turkish and Russian fronts.  Whatever happens until the end, this is
    Chris's work (or a piece of it).

    Makes sense from your end, but it doesn't change the fact that, if I was to
    attack Turkey, I'd be out even faster than I will be now, the only
    difference being that I'd have BOTH of you attacking me and no chance to
    throw centres one way or the other (may not have that option now, but at
    least I have a friend in camp).
    
    &gt; CARRY THROUGH??  You call StP south coast and a move to Livonia an attack

    Occupational hazard of playing both sides of the fence.  You'll concede that
    I really didn't much chocei in the matter?  No matter who I offended, I was
    going to get attacked.  Christian seemed a better bet to stay loyal for an
    extra turn or two.

    I knew about it, but what ws I going to do?  Tip you off?  Not likely.  But
    I didn't encourage him either.  If I had the active part you think I did,
    I'd be in Galicia right now, no?

    That's not what constitutes it and you know it.  &lt;g&gt;
    
    You're leaving your back open to him to walk across the stalemate line.  He
    has a pretty decent shot at taking Tunis, a guarantee of St Pete's if he
    wants it and, after Paul is out, you'll have left him the German centres.
    That's 18, n'est-ce pas?
    
    &gt; I had a decent shot at a solo a few years back -- when you were on the
    &gt; ropes, remember?  I decided Germany had a Better Shot than I did, and took
    &gt; what I thought to be appropriate measures.
    
    Sure. This game has been purely amazing for countries juggling the balance
    of power on the board.  Hel, that's why I'm where I am now.  I should never
    have built that damned fleet in St Pete's in 1901. I should have let England
    take his lumps and then dealt with the F/G.  Regrets? I've had a few...
    
    &gt; Now it is England who is a threat, and again I am trying to fight him.
    
    Funny direction your armies are taking...
    
    &gt; Ok, -- I retract my offer to lay off Rumania.  I will take Rumania -- the
    &gt; rest of the plan remains the same.  Retreat those two units off the board,

    &gt; StPete any sooner, and that Turkey doesn't ask for Sev -- which I would
    give
    &gt; him.
    
    By the time you give Turkey anything, the game's over
    
    &gt; I don't want you to die -- I wouldn't be talking to you if I did.  I want
    &gt; you to acknowledge that you are at my mercy, and agree to my terms of
    &gt; surrender, or spit in my face and tell me you'll die first!    We are not
    &gt; military equals, nor should we negotiate as if we were.
    
    Agreed, but that doesn't mean I hand you the soap.  I'll keep fighting until
    you realize that England is about to win.  My best prediction now is that my
    last army gets popped in St Pete's as England takes it for his 18th centre.
    
    &gt; my terms are remove two armies and re-build F StP (NC) or I will try to
    &gt; eliminate you.  I have every expectation of succeeding if I try.  You are
    a
    &gt; wily and respected opponent, and I know such a battle would not be easy.
    &gt; But it is FAR preferable to the hedging and carping about that we have had
    &gt; recently.
    
    Truth to tell, the last few turns have been very frustrating to me for that
    exact same reason.  I wanted someone to attack, but no matter which way
    (England or Austria) I would have went, the other profited far to much.  I
    hate that, so all I was trying to do was grow enough to be able to pick a
    direction.  Admitedly, it was 60-40 that I attacked you, but with Christian
    in the Med, I could have probably been talked into an *effective* attack
    northwards. He'd have to be dealt with eventually anyway.
    
    Okay then, your call.  Eliminate me if you can (and you probably can) and
    let Christian walk into his 18th centre (my next letter will be to invite
    him north by the way) or disengage, let me build another fleet (NORTH coast,
    so you can quote this to me later) and deal with Turkey
    
    S'up?

    Don't respond through the Judge to this, but I want to put two or
    three things on the game record to you, realizing that other people
    can dig them up with History commands.
    
    1. Put bluntly, I don't see how England gets an 18 center victory solely
    with Austrian cooperation, I just don't.
    
    2.  I can't see how Cal can be doing anything except a very public
    diplomatic ploy to get other people (like, say, you) to do something
    different.
    
    3. Chris moves awfully quickly to "throw game" tactics, doesn't he.
    
    It is interesting, high level negotiating.
    
    I'm going to step back into the background now, but if you do want
    to say something to me, be sure to either use broadcast and say
    it to everyone, or send me direct E-Mail.

    &gt;      We all know that G/A had England seriously on the ropes, and we
    &gt; could have
    
    I don't think G/A ever *really* existed.
    
    There was a point where Austria could have made a real play for a solo but
    unfortunately it coincided with the birth of Chris' kid, and he seemed a
    little bit off his game for those 2 weeks. Other than that I think it was
    always an issue as to whether Austria or England would come out on top, and
    I think R/T sticking together is what made the difference. With all of
    Austria, Russia, and England still alive into the mid- and end-game, I don't
    think Germany (the power) was ever going to be part of any end game.
    Literally *thousands* of games of Diplomacy have shown that Germany has to
    get two of his 4 neighbors eliminated to be a factor in the end game or to
    solo, and even then it has to pick up a good share of both those
    eliminations. This was never the case in "ruffians". ( I harken back to an
    EoG that was submitted to the GM in 1902 [which none of you have seen yet]
    that called for exactly the ending we are about to see)
    
    I also give Chris a lot of credit. Despite the fact that of course under
    perfect diplomacy England could be kept from a solo, I'm consistently amazed
    by the amount of PBeM players who don't believe that someone would actually
    "throw" a game, as a negotiating point. They always think it is "just a
    threat". So every once in a while you actually do get forced into a position
    where even though you don't want to throw it, you have to because the end
    result is the same (here, an English solo). So I think Chris has done some
    good, because in addition to making an attempt at holding off the English
    (which if accepted would have worked), but also by his offer not being taken
    seriously enough in time and his then *following thru* on his threat, he's
    shown that in fact threats made, at least by Chris Martin, actually do have
    some bite. And that's a skill that good face-2-face dip players have got to
    have in their arsenal.
    
    Since the emotions involved in throwing a game (and having one thrown on
    you) are counter to every day socialization skills, it can be really tough
    to distinguish when the right time to throw game will be, and to determine
    how much sooner in the process you have to threaten to do it so as to not
    only make the threat credible but also leave you enough time to work through
    your own emotional reticience towards doing it when the time comes to
    actually perform the act. In short it takes a lot of skill and fortitude of
    self-analysis to distinguish between when to threaten for correct tactical
    reasons versus when to threaten for purely emotional ("I don't wanna play
    with you no more") reasons. I can think of no game other than Dip where you
    ever get to explore the subtle distinction between the two in your own
    psyche.
    
    What a game Diplomacy is.
