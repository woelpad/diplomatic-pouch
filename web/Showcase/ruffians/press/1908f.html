    &gt;Well, that went VERY well.  Christian commiting extra resources to the
    &gt;north
    &gt;is an unexpected bonus.
    
    I'm afraid I have to beg to differ.  I suppose it's a point-of-view thing...
    
    &gt;Cal,
    &gt;
    &gt;Sev is a lock now -- Moscow moves in with Ukraine and Rum supporting.
    &gt;Whichever unit he pulls, he loses.  Next year Bulgaria is secure, and I can
    &gt;support myself into the Aegean, and it's goodby constantinople.
    
    Why do you figure Moscow?  I'd say use Ukr because Christian is NOT going to
    move Stp anywhere this season.
    
    Cal --
    &gt;same supports for one more season?
    
    Yes, please.  d;-})

    Guys;
     Ignore any qualms or doubts that I expressed earlier; even if I
    lose Ber this turn, I'll
    pick up at least Den and Mun and have that second Germany fleet
    constructed in the
    yards at Kiel.  Sure thing.
     Chris, please confirm that you'll be bouncing your A Ruh with my A
    Mun over Kiel.
    If I get burned by England wandering into Kiel, my fleet build has to be
    made in a less
    convenient spot (Ber).
    
     I was quite surprised with the English moves to Nwg (overkill in
    the north!) and to
    Baltic (double overkill).  He must have wanted StP VERY badly!
     The French move to Wms was also a puzzler; why would he risk losing
    his only dot,
    and why would he do it against the very guy that he just dumped two dots
    to?  Ol' John
    must hate everybody, here.
    
    Paul

    Gents,
    
    I will indeed be bouncing in Kiel.  As to the StPete/Sev question, I think
    we should take the sure thing, which is Sev.  Moscow -&gt; Sev, Supported by
    Ukr and Rum cannot fail.  Any attack on StPete may fail, and we cannot
    afford that.  Livonia covers Moscow.
    
    So, go for Sweden, (I think Baltic will be covering which will be fine).  I
    will move Ruhr -&gt; Kiel.
    
    Cal?  I know you'd rather move from Ukraine, but all it would take is
    christian doing the unexpected once to foil this little enterprise.
    
    All the best!

    Paul, Paul,
    
    I have only built fleets since the start of this game. An England with one
    army is NO threat to Germany. If you in fact wanted me to build Armies
    (wich it seems like you did) why didn't you just ask me??
    
    You are saying: " I just didn't feel comfortable with your being draped all
    over me while I stalled Austria until your cavalry arrived."
    
    Now you are stalling me while Austria is finishing R and T. What do you
    think will happen after that? In a way this whole plan could have been a
    plan of MINE, as I will eventually benefit from your fall to Austria. The
    only problem is that you are giving A a solo as he will get 18 before you
    choose to trust me again.
    
    There are now two ways this can end:
    1) A kills R-T-I.He then attacks you and I help you survive (as I will
    surely have units left by the time A has finished R-T-I). This gives us a
    three-way draw.
    
    2) A kills R-T-I.He then attacks you and I DO NOT help you survive. Austria
    gets 18 and only Chris wins (as always! :))
    
    Now the question for me would be: Will I help you later if you are in fact
    attacking me NOW?
    
    As an experienced Dip-player my answer would be - "Yes!, I do not want
    Chris to get a solo, no matter what."
    As an unexperienced Dip-player my answer would be - "No way I help that
    lying pig!"
    
    Now you go figure out wich answer I will choose later in this game!
    
    Finally, if you think you need to have some of my sc:s, maybe we can agree
    on it? Say you get Denmark+Sweden and then we work together. If you early
    in this end-game help Chris through the Iberia Stalemate we canot even stop
    him if we choose to work together later in the game. Better we agree for
    you to have some of my sc:s and then start to work together again, if
    greedy is your moode of the day.
    
    BTW, are you sure about what Austrian A Ruhr are doing? :)

    &gt; Paul, Paul,
    &gt;
    &gt; I have only built fleets since the start of this game. An England with one
    &gt; army is NO threat to Germany.
    
    No threat to Berlin, Kiel, Holland, Belgium, Brest or Marseilles?  Really?

    &gt; Finally, if you think you need to have some of my sc:s, maybe we can agree

    Are you saying that you're willing to buy me back just to stop Austria?  Hmm.
    I'd
    be a fool to just turn down an offer like that.  But I have to wonder.  Why
    weren't
    you more worried about Austrian advances before I changed sides?  You certainly
    
    were casual in your attitude towards rounding Iberia and coming after Italian
    dots
    (whoever was owning them).
     So you are offering Swe/Den if I lay off Iberia, build only armies, and
    work
    against Austria again?
    
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; BTW, are you sure about what Austrian A Ruhr are doing? :)
    
    After Chris promised to vacate Mun, I suggested that he go there; I suspected
    that
    you might have supported yourself to Nth or have sent a fleet to Eng, and I
    thought
    that I might need to bounce over Hol or have a support for Bel.

    Italy, but I realized it too late, especially cause Italy is Turkey's usual

    &gt;In re the Italian's comments below:
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt; This might just well be my last year in this game.
    &gt; &gt; But if any of you should be in position by the fall, I would be glad to
    &gt;try
    &gt; &gt; to help you to one of Austrias centers.
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt;it seems to me that we should be working *with* Austria to ensure that E/G
    &gt;cannot get effectively past the stalemate line. If not, then I fear we will
    &gt;weaken Austria too much and then in the end the Englishman will stab the
    &gt;German for a solo. Better a 4way than a English solo, and if we have a
    &gt;united front then England's only other choice is to attack Germany now.
    I don't think England is a threat anymore, cause Germany is clearly against
    him now. Th threat is more an Austrian win, don't you think?:-)

    Christian, why don't you want to move StP-Mos. Russia will play Liv - StP,
    and Ukr - Sev, supported by Mos and Rum, or the opposite. This is your only
    chance to go beyond StP, and you can only lose it, not really too bad.
    Anyway, you are sure to be in the draw if there is one, so why don't you
    take your chance, by helping me to keep Sev?
    It's almost impossible that he attacked StP, while I own Sev. If you are
    really paranoid about it, we can both attack Mos, while I also attack Bla -
    Rum. He'll then succeed only with Ukr S Rum - Sev.
    Do you agree with the fact that one thing is sure : Moscow will only give a
    support, not attack, while we are in Sev and StP.
    I wait for your reply to send my orders.
    All the best,
    Cyrille.

    Ok, I will move StP-Mos if you move Sev-Mos and Bla-Rum.
    
    I understand that this should be the best move at the moment, regarding
    long-time tactics. I bow to your superior thinking...:)

    Cal -- I can't believe it!  Christian moved!  ACH!  Well, at least we
    finally have taken Cyrille out of it.  No matter what he disbands, and I am
    guessing A Armenia, we can now take him down.  My guess is he will either
    retreat to the Tyhr. sea, and try to help Christian, or the Emed and try to
    hold us off longer.
    
    The proof of Pauls good intentions will be in his builds, of course.  Two
    armies and you and I have a whole PASSEL of trouble on our hands, as
    Christian is in the Med now, and will be hell to kick out.
    
    Just a look ahead, but if Cyrile does retreat to Emed, I will probably need
    to rotate a fleet into bulgaria, so we should think about how to make that
    work for us.
    
    Have a good weekend, let me know what you're thinking!

    I'd hate to try and guess what he's going to retreat as it will depend on
    his level of apathy at the time.  My guess would be the fleet retreating
    from Ion (F Eas?), but A Arm is a possibility. He seems as mad at you as he
    is at me.

    I think Paul is with us, but he sure faces a tactical nightmare trying to
    hold what he has.  I think we should try to support him as much as possible
    or he will probably be "turnable" by Christian.

    I agree.  Might be easier to swap Serbia and Bulgaria instead of Greece and
    Bul.

    I was thinking about asking for TWO of the centres in Turkey just to
    solidify my position, but with St Pete's gone, I may not have a whole lot to
    do after Cyrille goes down.  In fact, any builds I do get will have a hard
    time finding their way to any sort of frontline.  I still want one of
    Cyrille's centres for the sheer principle of it though, but you can use the
    other two more than I can.
    
    Other than that, I'm going to save my serious analysis until after the
    builds/retreats.

    &gt; in his hands (however briefly!).
    
     The English F Gol can support his F Por-Spa this Spring, as will his F Mao.
    
    In the Fall, he can then cut my support for Bre (in Gas).  Perhaps I should risk
    
    moving A Gas-Par this Spring (Christian should expect Gas-S-Bre, eh?).
     I plan on moving F Ber-Bal supported by F Kie, while F Hel goes to Hol with
    
    Belgium's support.  Can your A Ruhr please support my A Bel?

    A mistake that I hope will cost him... d;-})
    
    Just wanted to get my 2 cents (CDN) in here.
    
    I think we have at least three things that are priorities here; first we
    have to make sure that Paul loses as little as possible to Christian.
    You're pretty spread out, Paul, and will have to win a couple of guessing
    games to beat England.  Priority #1, I think, is for Chris and I to tilt the
    odds as much in your favour as possible.
    
    Priority #2 is for me to get St Pete's back.  I know that this isn't the
    first thing Germany needs to deal with, but until I can get some breathing
    space in the north, my units will have nothing to.  Now I'm not the type to
    strike at an ally just because there are no other targets, but I think our
    little triumvirate can utilize my forces better.
    
    Priority #3 is to make sure that Christian can't sweep through the Med.
    This is Chris' problem.  Obviously, our ability to stop this will depend on
    how fast Turkey goes down, so we have to make this happen quick.  Cyrille's
    removal will give us a good idea of how fast we can sew up the bottom corner
    of the board.
    
    Okay, so what have I missed?  Anyone want to re-order the priorities or
    suggest new ones?

    Well, if Chris' A Ruhr can support my A Bel, the Low Countries will be covered.
    If he can move A Ven-Pie, Mar need never lack for support.
     My job is to risk moving A Gas-Par this season, so that future supports for
    Bre
    can't be cut by an English F Spa.  True, this will not be a problem if England
    puts
    F Por in Spa(sc), as he tried to do last season.  Then I could just keep A Gas
    where
    it is, and keep it supporting A Bre.
     My biggest lament is that both armies Bel and Bre are useless, except for
    their
    roles on "garrison duty."
    
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Priority #2 is for me to get St Pete's back.  I know that this isn't the

    &gt; little triumvirate can utilize my forces better.
    
    Well, I want to start this Spring by having F Kie-S-F Ber-Bal.  Perhaps from
    there
    we could try a convoy of Russian A Lvn-Swe (Den supporting)?  Get an army in
    Swe, and Fin is as good as cut; StP can be reclaimed and Nwy put under pressure!
    
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Priority #3 is to make sure that Christian can't sweep through the Med.
    &gt; This is Chris' problem.  Obviously, our ability to stop this will depend on

    &gt; removal will give us a good idea of how fast we can sew up the bottom corner
    &gt; of the board.
    
    This is where Christian's tardiness in rounding the Horn of Gibraltar comes into
    play as an advantage for us!  Austria has time this Spring '09 to move F Nap-Tyn
    
    with support from Ion.  Along with the French fleet already in Tun, that gives
    us
    quite an advantage for holding the Med.
     If England elects to dither around with attacks on Bre, he may not enter
    the Wms
    for quite some time to come!  I don't see this as a burning threat to the
    alliance,
    while Turkey is being quickly dispatched in the East.

    Hi Guys:
      In my last note, I was grousing about wasting units on garrison
    duty.  Obviously,
    they can be put to better use if they are annihilated in a Spring turn,
    and rebuilt as fleets thereafter.
     We have to wait to see England's removal (I predict that he'll yank
    F Nwy), but
    how about this:
    Chris, your A Ruhr bounces my A Bel over Hol.  I order A Mun-Bur and F
    Hel-
    Nth.  If England tries F Nth-Bel supported by Eng, he gets Bel but I
    move into Nth.
    My A Bel retreats otb, and I walk into Edi to compensate for the
    temporary loss of
    Bel.  I build another fleet.
     Heck, I could pull the same stunt afterward with A Bre (if
    Christian was still so
    cooperative)!

    Guys:
     I forgot that England gained StP, so he had no removal due this
    season.  So now if Christian moved F Nth-Bel supported by F Eng, we
    could anticipate that he would also order F Nwy-Nth.
     So forget fancy manouvers to get my A Bel annihilated just yet....
    Chris, let's have your A Ruhr support A Bel, and let's concentrate on
    maybe getting my A Bre
    annihilated instead...?
     In Spring--I move A Mun-Bur and Austria moves A Ven-Pie.   A
    Gas-S-A Bre.
    In the Fall--if England has moved F Por-Spa(nc), with intent to cut my A
    Gas' support for Bre:  I order A Gas-S-A Mar-Spa, Chris orders A Pie-S-A
    Bur-Mar.
    If Bre is dislodged, it is the one that retreats otb to be rebuilt as a
    fleet.
     Hey--simple, right?

    I do have some ideas.... I certainly agree with Cal that I am
    absolutely not the right person to take over.  I have shared
    insights personally with a number of you, not just him.
    
    One problem is that with the Worldmasters Tournament going on
    right now, many of the players in that might not want to also
    get involved here.
    
    My first suggestion, though, is that we find a Frenchman to
    play Turkey.  Does anyone have the results for the large
    French Tournament held last weekend?  We could invite the
    winner or someone from the top five or ten who has a strong
    record.
    
    Mark Fassio is another idea (though he likely would say no)
    since he is the best player I know who is not in Worldmasters
    and is STILL smarting over his performance in another recent
    game in this series.
    
    A third idea which I like a great deal IS to ask an observer
    of this game who is NOT me to take over.  Are there any
    observers here who qualify and are interested?
    
    If I think of another idea, I will let you know.

    &gt; Hmm...a French player would be a good idea, as would Fassio.  It's
    &gt; just that I feel the timing would be perfect to get Mike.
    &gt; Rick
    &gt;
    I think you should start with Mike as you suggested.  It will allow
    him to "sharpen" his skills in the interim!
    
    After that, I suggest that you and I talk more privately about other
    ideas if you need them.

     Yes, the Sultan cannot remain lurking behind our collective backs with a
    large knife clenched in his hand.
     I think that I have begun to work out the problem of my profusion of
    "garrison"
    armies (see past notes), and how to convert them into fleets without losing any
    dots
    to England.

    Hi Mike,
    	Welcome to the game.  You've got a rough task ahead of you, as
    the Turk is down to the three Asia Minor SCs.
    	Order submission is pretty simple - the judge recognizes
    almost any move format you would think of, but if you ever write a
    convoy order, you must specify the route taken, like
    A yor - Nth - Bel
    	Messages are sent by the "press" command, as in
    "press to A"
    
    You can sent press to multiple recipients by combining letters, like
    "press to GRE"
    
    If you want to talk to everybody at once, like this, the command is
    "broadcast"
    
    Right now the deadline for the adjustment phase is Wednesday.
    To make an adjustment, you use a command
    disband force
    as in
    disband f nth
    or
    build a vie
    for example.
    
    If you want the Judge to wait until the deadline before processing,
    you need to set your WAIT flag by
    SET WAIT
    you can remove this by
    SET NOWAIT
    
    Unlike most GMs, the Judge will always process almost immediately once
    all the orders are in.
    
    Hmm...anything I've forgotten?
    
    Welcome to the game again.  I'm sure you'll get some very nice letters
    from all the friendly people playing here.

    Dear chancellor,
    
    what a godawful mess the humble ottoman peoples find themselves in.  After i
    get the blood cleaned up outta my new office, the last sultan met with a
    merciful fate (a little gory though), i am gonna be on the horn double time
    to try to work out some kinda deal for survival and maybe prosperity.
    
    It looks like u have austrian problems of your own.  With your rebound of 2
    sc's this year, they will add much needed resources to your arsenal.
    
    Is there any way the ottomans may assist the germans.  we may have had some
    setbacks, but moral is high with the new leadership.  Any long faces in the
    corp will be dealt with mercifully also.

    grudges that cannot be forgiven.  He met with a merciful fate.  I am in the

    Hi guys!
    
    Just want to confirm that the plan is to take the new Turk down regardless
    of the fact that Cyrille is gone?  IE nobody knows the new guy and thinks he

    Dean Archduke,
    
    I see u are faring well and the potential to fare better.  I would like to
    assist to in your prosperity.  U have fronts to the north, west, south and
    the potential for one in the east.  This makes it difficult to grow.  I
    would like to propose the following:
    
    A demilitarization of your southern front.
    opening of a new front in the east with turkish support.
    
    The reasoning behind this is:
    
    Russia is in for a bad time with the advent of the English in stp.
    Russia is exposed to u now.
    With Turkey limiting herself to Russian Territory, it will make for a solid
    southern front against norther aggression.
    Germany and England are already in a scuffle, thus divided; Italy and France
    are out, that makes for a winning team.  Unity wins diplomacy games!!!
    
    A/T will be much better for the Austrian success that A/R of the following:
    
    1.  Immediate gains by Austia at Russian expense.
    2.  Ablility for Austria to focus her resources North and West with a
    dedicated servant covering your south and east.  Your fleet can be sent west
    with great effectiveness, while your armies moving north has great potential
    for growth.
    
    If Austria is willing to consider to such a concept, Turkey is willing to
    make serve in any way possible.

    Hi Mike!  Thanks for taking over Cyrille's old position.  Frankly, he didn't
    do much with it other than antagonize everyone around him.  You can be
    assured that I won't hold anything he did against you.
    
    Unfortunately though, that doesn't mean I think we're going to be able to
    work together.  I could lie to you and say, "Hey, let's do it!" in the hopes
    of throwing you off tactics-wise, but that's not my style.  Anyway, I'm far
    too vulnerable to a stab by Austria to risk attacking him and I have to get
    another centre from SOMEWHERE, so it looks like it's going to have to be you
    (if I can manage it).
    
    Who knows though?  Austria MAY stab me and I'll need to come crawling to you
    for help.  At least then, you'll know I started off by being honest with
    you.  That may provide the basis for a future relationship.  Keep in touch
    and good luck.
    
    Thanks again or taking over the position!

    MiKal,
    
    Well, this is a fine mess!  Here I have gone and signed in blood an
    agreement to finish off Turkey no matter What, and you come along with this
    proposal.
    
    Its a good thing I didn't use my own blood!  ;)
    
    If I am not mistaken, we are awaiting a disband from you?  Here are my
    thoughts:
    
    I would love to turn some tables against the russian -- he has messed with
    me a number of times in this game, and only lately have we worked together.
    You are quite right that he has big problems coming his way in any case,
    with england.  So, I am inclined to say, yah, sure, lets get to work.  I
    can't afford to let England get any bigger!
    
    The move on russia will have to come in the fall for maximum effectiveness.
    Also, you are a little fleet heavy for my liking right now -- would you
    disband F Emed as a show of good faith?
    
    Oh, and I will be disavowing any intention of working with you -- but come
    the fall, we can strike!
    
    How does that sound?
