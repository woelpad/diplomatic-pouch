    Guys,
    
    Yes, I am taking Paul out. I am quite certain he will move Bel-Nth
    supported by Hol. This means SKA will support NTH. Also, I am not sure I
    will be able to vacate Denmark to fill it with SKA, as someone (Paul or
    Chris) can move to Kiel.
    
    Yes, I am thinking of popping the WES fleet. Will you bounce me in NAf Meef?
    
    What do you guys wanna see me build?

    Okay, that's understandable.
    
    &gt;What do you guys wanna see me build?
    
    Has the time come to decline builds?  If not, maybe one more army?

    Christian,
    
    Well, that went pretty well!  Too bad Paul didn't go for Kiel, you could
    have taken both of them with no problems then.
    
    Thoughts?  I should like to have my fleet WestMed dislodged so I can retreat
    it OTB and re-build as a fleet.  Keeping Rome for a season is a blessing,
    sure enough!  Do you want me to keep Kiel this season, and if so, we should
    arrange a bounce there, yes?
    
    Let me know what you desire!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Paul,
    
    I have wanted to apologize to you for a week or so.  You are the one I feel
    worst about in this game.  I screwed up, and there is no question about that
    anymore.  Now, I have abandoned you to Christian's tender mercies, and
    there's nothing I can do about it at this point.  The diplomatic tide with
    R/T simply forced me this way.
    
    I am sorry that I didn't work with you.  Given another chance, -- well,
    given another chance, you'd probably stab me just to get even, but, ;) ==
    given another chance, I'd have taken the convoy to Edi.
    
    All the best,
    
    Chris

    Chris,
    
    What now? Did you like the way I tricked Turkey to TRN? :)
    
    Anyway, maybe I should force your fleet WES to disband? That would make a
    sure build for you, and we would need an Austrian fleet coming from behind.
    It seems vital to cut ION...Anyway, I will be moving Den-Kie. Feel free to
    support me! :)

    Chris,
    
    Well, I will dislodge your WES fleet then. I guess the best thing is if we
    bounce over Kiel. If you have to choose I would prefer if you use Bud to
    support Serbia instead of Rum. Two build this season will yield a innocent
    A Lon and a F Lvp. You would be able to build two, with keeping Rom and
    disbanding F Wes and getting one of Ser/Rum. An army Vienna and a fleet
    Tri? (not much else to build standing in Bud so why did I ask?)
    
    all the best

    Well, thanks to Paul for playing it out, and now they were four.....
    should I do some more "odds" now? ;-)  I must admit that it still looks
    like it has some play in it to me.....
    
    
    Jim-Bob
    
    
    &gt; 
    &gt; 
    &gt; The game is reaching the point where, if Austria still wants to throw
    &gt; the game to England, I don't see how Turkey and Russia could prevent
    &gt; it.  I _think_ Turkey will eventually cave and stab Russia, but I'm
    &gt; not sure.  He might prefer to let England win.  
    
    Yeah, but that would be REALLY disappointing if that is all that
    happens.  There is SOOOO much more potential play in this game!
    &gt; 
    &gt; I read that El-Amin sprained his ankle yesterday.  Bummer.  Makes me
    &gt; doubt that my Yahoo picks will do well - I have UConn making the Final
    &gt; Four.  I have them losing to Stanford in my ESPN picks.  
    
    Yup, but either way, if you had asked me I would have told you that
    UConn has been totally erratic all season (especially El-Amin and
    Tony Robertson) and they have NO chance of making the Final Four.
    I think they beat Tennessee and I chose them to beat Stanford,
    but I have little confidence in the pick.  UConn has actually
    played better with El-Amin out sometimes (there is where 
    Robertson is the key and he was great against Utah St.).
    &gt; 
    &gt; A very surprising low number of upsets in the first round, especially
    &gt; if one thinks, like I did, that Gonzaga and Pepperdine should have
    &gt; been favored.  Only 3 upsets, but I got two.  I missed on Seton Hall,
    &gt; but got the other 4 Big East teams (the conference seems to have been
    &gt; underrated, but we'll have to wait a bit on that judgment.)  
    &gt; 
    &gt; Rick
    
    As I write Kentucky and Syracuse are going nip and tuck.  I think
    Kentucky will win before losing to MSU next Thursday.  I'm upset
    that I missed on Seton Hall.  Shaheen Holloway was GREAT early
    in the season as he came in for the fall in phenomenal shape and
    on a mission.  But then Seton Hall really slumped badly at the 
    end and I thought Oregon had enough to get by them.  I ***hate***
    missing an upset and thought about that one.  It would have been
    my 13th upset pick, but I already picked way too many.  I am
    NEVER going to do well unless there are a lot of upsets.  I
    love this tournament for the upsets.
    
    I do think the Big East is a great conference, it is just so big
    that it's lost a lot of focus.

    I vote for a 4-way draw, eatr.
    
    I think this play is almost gone in this one.

    Meef,
    
    There's just as much play left as you want.  if you are ready to move on
    Cal, I am ready to hold off Christian.
    
    That, by the way, is still the price of stopping an English Solo.  I do hope
    you believe that I will throw it if you don't work with me, at this point.
    
    Rome can be yours again!  ;)
    
    Chris
    
    
    This is the last message of yours that didn't make it into TAP.
    I ended up holding it until last night.  I'll put it out on E-Mail
    later today sometime....
    
    &gt; 
    &gt; So much for Ohio State.
    &gt; 
    Indeed, and I was really surprised they went down EASILY!
    
    &gt; And Temple, and Stanford.  I've now only got one Final Four team left.
    &gt; Thankfully, that's MSU, but really, picking MSU to win everything is
    &gt; not going to get me ahead of a lot of people with my picks.
    &gt; 
    I only have one left too, but it it UCLA.  I like the pick and obviously
    I like them to beat MSU.  Then I'll be happy as the brackets will be
    broken for everyone ;-)
    
    &gt; I'm so annoyed with myself for picking two Pac-10 teams to make the
    &gt; Final Four!  I mean, I KNOW the Pac-10 teams ALWAYS fall flat in the 
    &gt; tourney.  Grrr.  But still...UNC beating Stanford??  Hard to believe.
    &gt; 
    Yeah, I let Lute Olsen adoration take me too far too (I was a big Iowa
    fan when he was there to show you how far back it goes), but I ***KNEW***
    they wouldn't make the Final Four.  And I didn't like Stanford's lack
    of athleticism on defense at all.  We forget, but North Carolina was
    picked by many pundits BEFORE the season to win the National Championship
    behind Cota and that big man of theirs whose name I forget, but he's 
    tall and wicked quick.  I just HATE UNC and can't bring myself to 
    pick them for anything.  More recently, they have been disappointing
    to be sure, but obviously they are back to pre-season status.
    
    &gt; The only positive I take from yesterday is that I picked Tulsa to beat
    &gt; Cincinnati.   I've picked them to win one more game, and don't really
    &gt; think Miami should be too much for them to handle.  
    &gt; 
    You got that one right, I will be rooting for whoever wins that game
    to go all the way.  I sort of want a team that our lowly PC Friars
    beat to win the National Championship.  We beat Miami IN Miami.
    
    &gt; I was right to say that three Big East teams would make the Sweet
    &gt; Sixteen, though there is no way I would have ever dreamed that the two
    &gt; losers would be St. John's and UConn, the finalists in the Big East
    &gt; tournament.  
    
    WE totally agree on that.... although there is a LONG history of the
    Big East Tournament finalists failing in the Big Dance as opposed
    to the earlier losers doing better.
    &gt; 
    &gt; Given a chance to repick the Final Four from the Sweet Sixteen, I
    &gt; would go with Tulsa from the South, Gonzaga from the West, OSU from
    &gt; the East and MSU still from the Midwest.  I don't really like OSU that
    &gt; much, but the East is gutted (it was really never strong to begin
    &gt; with).  Even Seton Hall could win that now.  Half of the teams I
    &gt; thought could beat MSU have already lost.  Sure, UCLA could beat them,
    &gt; but they could also lose by thirty. Iowa State could beat them.  Right
    &gt; now, I think whoever wins the Midwest will win it all.  Duke does not
    &gt; have a great Duke team.  
    
    I'm rooting for the Hall....
    &gt; 
    &gt; As a UCONN fan, I have to think that they would be in position to make
    &gt; a Final Four run, had El-Amin not gotten injured.  The same could
    &gt; easily be said about Cincinnati and Kenyon Martin.  
    &gt; 
    But you WILL agree that El-Amin has been inconsistent ALL season!
    I stand on my opinion that El-Amin was going to have a bad game
    for some reason in some game -- happened to be for injury -- and
    they would lose if Robertson didn't pick it up and have a great
    game -- and he didn't.  That one I got right in general if not
    in particular.
    
    &gt; I would really love to see a Tulsa/Gonzaga final.  And who wouldn't!
    &gt; 
    &gt; Rick
    &gt; 
    I'll root for it..... but I still like UCLA too.  If they could play
    defense, they would be a shoo-in.
