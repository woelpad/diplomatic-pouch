    Gents, I've actually set the board up within minutes of getting the results,
    a new record for me!  Of course, Chris, with what's going on in your life, I
    suspect my speed will be wasted.  Oh well, I can live with that... &lt;G&gt;.
    Hope everything went well with mother and baby.
    
    Christian is going to have to make some tough choices this turn. he stands
    to lose one/both/all of St Pete's, North Sea or Sweden.  I'll certainly try
    for St Pete's and you guys figure where you want his other chips to fall.
    
    As for the south, Chris, how about you use your fleet in the Aegean to
    support me to Con?  You can follow up into Bulgaria if you want to stop him
    from slipping in behind me.
    
    Comments?

    Dear Archpope,
    
    U sure look spread out on the map.  Are u not concerned about that?
    
    Russia will probably gain 1 sc this year.
    
    U probably can get war.
    
    I would recommend taking bul and leaving rum alone.  If rum is attacked he
    will retreat into Austria proper, which u do not want.
    
    Your fleet in aeg is also a concern.
    
    What do u propose?

    MiKal,
    
    Damn right I'm worried about being spread out!  I wasn't supposed to BE in
    the Aegean.
    
    Also, I had a baby last night -- or rather, my wife did!  It's our first,
    and this leaves me doubly spread out!
    
    I should have some time tonight to look things over -- I agree, Rumania is
    going to have to wait.

     He stands to lose Nth too, unless he despairs of trying a three-way attack

    That's why I moved it there!
    
    Ok, in the south -- I am telling the Turk I will cut Rum's support, so that
    he can take StPete -- he Will support my Army Serbia to Bulgaria, while I
    move F Aegean back to cover Greece.
    
    So, the thing to do would be support you in to Con, and I follow up to Bul,
    as you have suggested.
    
    This is a good baby.  Man, it's nice having the In-Laws here to help out!
    Let me know what you want me to do, I will be mostly incommunicado for some

    MiKaL,
    
    Ok, Cal has been in touch -- the baby is asleep, and I have two seconds to
    myself.  ;)
    
    Cal wants me to support him from Bulgaria -&gt; Con, and he will rotate his
    armies south.  Instead, I hope that you will support a Serbia -&gt; Bulgaria,
    and I will send the fleet back to Greece to cover any retreat.
    
    If you like, F Black Sea can support F Con to hold, which will provide you
    some more security.  Or, your call, you can attack Sev with support again.
    I will be trying to take Warsaw as well -- Cal stands to re-take StPete, so,
    It's vital that we take at least one center off him -- I'd like you to try
    for Sev as well.
    
    Let me know your thoughts!

    Dear Chris,
    
    I will supply u support serbia - bulgaria this season:
    
    Your fleet in the Aegean is making me nervous.
    
    U stand to gain three sc's this season.  Quite a reaping I would say.
    
    U are gonna help me conquer Russia and let me into bul next year, correct?
    
    I would REALLY like to gain 2 sc's next year and Mos the year after.
    
    I am willing to help u fight the northern hordes.
    
    Thoughts?

    Christian --
    
    Well, the holidays are here, and little Jesse C. Martin is resting, so I
    thought I'd drop you a note regarding the game.
    
    I am in a position to stab either Germany or Russia, rather viciously.  it's
    just a choice of target for me at this point.  since I seem to be in
    possesion of Italy, I am a tad nervous about your fleets near and in the
    Med -- clearly it's harder for me to project naval power than you!
    
    On the other hand, Russia is about to resurge, which I really can't have.  I
    was wondering if we might work a deal -- I could tell you how Germany is
    going to defend, say, Brest, in return for you defending StPete, instead of
    Sweden?
    
    Do you think we could work together on those terms?  If you can help me in
    this regard, I can continue to feed you info on how Germany will defend
    himself, so that you can take him down.
    
    Let me know!
    
    Chris

    Cal,
    
    Whew!  finaly a chance to breathe a little!  Jesse is feeding right now, and
    I am sort of cooking dinner, so I have a few seconds to let you in on "the
    plan", which really is the same as always.
    
    Turkey is going to support my move Ser -&gt; Bulgaria, right?  he also writes
    to tell me he would rather support Con to hold with F Black Sea than attack
    you!  Gee, I wonder why?
    
    I think Armenia will be moving back to cover Smyrna as well.  It seems that
    someone has been telling tales about my lack of trustworthyness?  ;)
    
    This is frustrating.  I have been a good boy for some time now, and I
    imagine everyone is expecting me to stab someone.  I am quite spread out and
    could certainly use a build.  I can't seem to break through to get Turkish
    centers, I can't stab you because I need you in the North, both against
    England and eventually Germany, and I can't stab Germany Yet because
    otherwise England runs rampant over the continent, and I can't stay in Tunis
    because that French fleet is much more valuable than the one I would build
    to replace it.
    
    Do you want to re-think the assault on Con?  as it stands, My take is that
    he would hold and I would dislodge you from Bulgaria.  You could retreat to
    Greece, but I'd really rather that we didn't have to go through that.
    
    I hope your weekend went well, and I'll let you know if I hear anything from
    Chirstian, whom I am writing to try to get some info re Germany from!

    John,
    
    Wow, what a weekend this has been!  I have finally got a second to breathe,
    and I thought I'd let you know the Plan.
    
    I am of course going for the solo here, I think I have the position for it,
    but it's going to be a delicate manouver the whole way through -- I have to
    keep Germany and England balanced, while I take down Russia and Turkey, and
    then quickly devour Germany before england can get big enough to stop me.
    
    Any thoughts on my course of action this turn?   I am inclined to wait one
    more turn before stabbing anyone, but if Russia regains StPete, I am in for
    some trouble -- my position in the balkans is too weak.  I could probably
    take Bulgaria and Warsaw, but is the time right?
    
    In the Med, I will be moving Tyrh -&gt; GoL and Tunis -&gt; NaF.  I am going to
    try to get Christian to try to take Brest from the MAO, but we shall see.  I
    really can't afford a retreat to Tuscany right now, but Christian is quite
    conservative, I'd bet even money that if we dislodged GoLyon, he go OTB and
    re-build in the homeland -- he will probably lose the North Sea this year,
    don't you think?
    
    Anyway, as I see it, you can either move to the Mao, or support me to Gol or
    support me to Naf, and any of these will advance the cause.  I could support
    you to GoLyon, that seems like it would probably work, what do you think?
    
    Heck, I'd support you back into Marsailles!  That would be fun!
    
    Best,

    Chris,
    
    I agree with your views on Russian re-awakening. Let´s say that I would need some info about Brest AND some irrational move by A Ruh to be ready to d
    efend StP. No doubt I will disband southern fleets if disbansion is required. But only if I see that you are not to big a threat.
    
    I have one main problem: Whatever I do you will soon be able to get a solo in this game. The only way I can stop you from getting a solo is to eventu
    ally help Germany defend. So what I have to do is taking a great deal of German attack while you grow and then finally when Paul wakes up help him. N
    ot to funny. :)

    Chris is writing to me and asking for me to defend StP instead of Sweden

    I guess that you and the New Turkey can work something out to defend each
    other against Austria? I will move Fin S F Swe, Nwy-Nth, Eng S Nwy-Nth
    (as G has two fleets bordering Nth) and you are free to capture StP with
    one army while defending Warzaw with the other one (Mos/Lvn). A bounce in
    War will give you a build there and Austria will be in trouble if you and
    Turkey stick together. Anyway, I don't want you to promise me anything as
    you probably don't trust me at all. I just want you to know that I am NOT
    covering StP at all, and I do not take it as an act of war if you
    re-capture it.

    What a pointless stab.  You may have Turkey on line, but wouldn't you, as
    Austria prefer a strong Russia over a strong Turkey?  I thought you looked
    to the long term more than that, but I guess I was wrong.

    Well, I guess I'm in a position to at least hope that my previous honesty
    will carry some weight with you.  As I'm sure you noticed, Austria has
    attacked me and made sure you didn't get a cut of the spoils.  Hopefully,
    you'll consider an alliance with me as a way to help stop the game leader
    and gain a share of the spoils for yourself.  Obviously, I'll be a lot
    easier to trust than Chris... d;-})
    
    I notice that you bounced yourself in Smyrna.  I sure hope that indicates
    some distrust of Austria on your part.
    
    What do you say?  Shall we team up and make some noise in the east?

    Cal,
    
    The Cat 23 acadamy has a saying -- never apologize, never explain, it only
    looks like you're gloating.
    
    However, the unsupported attack on StPete, the move to Ukraine -- I think
    maybe I acted just in time!
    
    I would be willing to discuss the reasons behind my actions, but I respect
    you too much to be glib or facile.  I guess I can't say any more than that
    at this time without going over one of those lines.

    Paul,
    
    No doubt you are looking askance at my stab of Russia.  All I can say is
    that I was very worried about his superior position in the balkans, and I
    thought I'd take action before he could build and come after me.
    
    You will note that we successfully anhialated picardy, took spain, and I
    didn't move to Tyrolia, denying myself a fleet build I think I badly need,
    all so that you wouldn't be overly concerned by my actions.
    
    I am . . . eager to know your response to this.  Cal is certainly upset.
    But I think that you now have England on the Run, and I can handle Turkey.
    
    Let me know!

    MiKaL!
    
    Way to Go!  Cal I think expected something of the sort to happen, hence his
    move to Ukraine.   The beautiful thing about all this is this -- we have a
    lock on Rum and Sev in the Spring, and a decent chance at Moscow next year,
    if not this!
    
    Good on you for covering yourself as well -- in the long run, there was
    nothing you could do if Cal and I were allies, but no point in making it
    easy for us if we were.  Classy play, we probably would have tried to convoy
    to Smy if we had been serious.
    
    At this point, I am looking at getting fleets around to Spain.   I don't
    think I have a shot at a solo, england's grip on the waves in the north is
    too strong, so I just need to secure the Med against invasion.  Where do you
    see yourself in the next two years?  In four?
    
    all the best,

    &gt;However, the unsupported attack on StPete, the move to Ukraine -- I think
    &gt;maybe I acted just in time!
    
    The move to Ukraina, along with the supported attack on Sev, was to try and
    leave Sev open for a fleet build.  Obviously, St Pete's wasn't likely to be
    open/available this year for a build.
    
    I try to plan for the long term.  I figured that if we could take out Turkey
    and have Germany remain engaged with England, we'd be able to come out of
    the east as the dominant power.  THEN, we could either play for a two-way,
    race to eighteen or stab as necessary.  You've just prolonged the outcome in
    the east.  Even if you and Turkey do take me out, do you really think that
    you'll be more comfortable with him behind you?  Say, as opposed to me
    beside you?  You'll have to spend time stabbing HIM when you and I could
    have been taking out the western survivor(s).
    
    Don't worry about explaining.  Seriously.  Obviously, you just felt it was
    right thing for you to do at the time.  I respect that, even if I disagree.
    We'll just have to see how it plays out. Turkey's bounce in Smyrna doesn't
    exactly bespeak his eternal trust of you, does it?

    Okay, you have my thanks, even if I didn't take you up on your warning.  I
    don't have any forces available to help your cause, but you can be assured
    that you won't have to worry about me hitting you from the north.  I have
    things closer to home to worry about.
    
    Non-aggression pact sound good to you right about now?

    England,
    
    if you remove F GOL, then I will support you back into Spain this coming
    year in return for your support for me into Marseilles thereafter. I see
    Germany as a major threat to solo and I will do everything I can to help you
    and Austria stop that. But, obviously, France would like a little payoff
    too!

    Christian has expressed the thought that I am the danger to solo -- however,
    I think John has the right of it.
    
    Lets work together.

    Cal,
    
    Ok,
    &lt;&lt;The move to Ukraina, along with the supported attack on Sev, was to try
    and
    leave Sev open for a fleet build.  Obviously, St Pete's wasn't likely to be
    open/available this year for a build.&gt;&gt;
    
    that makes sense.  Why not tell me in advance?  I know how closely you are
    watching this game.  RGA were tight about moves, "support the attack on StP
    and I'll support the attack on Sweden"  Ok, so Christian writes you and
    sez -- Take StP, but do something about Chris, hes about to explode!  You
    write Turkey, say, hey, Chris is really going to hose you, you'd better
    bounce yourself in Smyrna, look he's told me all your plans!  You occupy
    Ukraine, build A Warsaw, and where am I?
    
    In deep doo-doo!
    
    And, hey, even if you didn't plan it, it sure looks convincing, doesn't it?
    Especially with you not responding to my last message, asking what to do
    about Bulgaria/Constantinople.
    
    I think the big concern on my mind is Germany going for the solo.  I really
    did what I did for my own security.  My forces were too spread out and your
    Balkan position superior.
    
    I don't know if you could work with me again but I would be willing to
    discuss scenarios where I return Warsaw to you, you build a northern fleet,
    Turkey remains stifled, that sort of thing.
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    Guys,
    I will remove F LYO, and I do want to stop G at any price. Help me

    &gt; Message from tremewanc@worldnet.att.net as Austria to Germany in 'ruffians':
    &gt;
    &gt; Paul,
    &gt;
    &gt; No doubt you are looking askance at my stab of Russia.  All I can say is
    &gt; that I was very worried about his superior position in the balkans, and I
    &gt; thought I'd take action before he could build and come after me.
    
    Surprised yes, but upset about it--no.  In fact, I can afford to convoy my A
    Den-
    Lvn next Spring to help you out on the Russian front!
     I want to build a F Kie, and move it to Den to give me a third fleet on the
    Nth.
    Perhaps A Pic-Par, A Bel-Pic, F Hol-Bel supported by Ruhr, and A Mar-Gas
    supported by Spain....  This would leave A Spain vulnerable, but it would
    certainly
    ensure that I would regain/keep Brest!
     You might want to have A Bur-S-A Mar-Gas, and move A Pie-Mar.  We could
    determine, in the Fall, what is best for your A Mar but it might prove useful in
    supporting me in Spain (if I manage to keep it!).
    
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; You will note that we successfully anhialated picardy, took spain, and I
    &gt; didn't move to Tyrolia, denying myself a fleet build I think I badly need,
    &gt; all so that you wouldn't be overly concerned by my actions.
    
    Tyr isn't a dot-- you mean't Mar?  I think that I am more valuable to you as an
    ally
    vs. England than I am as a "feeding ground" for your armies.  Let Russia serve
    in
    THAT capacity!
    
    &gt;
    &gt;     England's choice of priorities was certainly odd this season:  he was
    &gt; willing to sacrifice dots for little strategic gain.  I imagine that he will
    &gt; retreat F Spa-Mao, once again choosing "position" over dots.  He will surely
    &gt; remove A Fin.
    
     Paul

    Paul,
    
    Whew!
    
    I was worried you'd get a little nervous, but I can see that you viewed
    russia the same way I did -- helpful, but a pain in the back given a little
    growth.
    
    Ok, let's see -- Christian retreated to Portugal, did you note that?
    
    &lt;&lt;.  In fact, I can afford to convoy my A
    Den-
    Lvn next Spring to help you out on the Russian front!&gt;&gt;
    
    That sounds great.
    
    &lt;&lt;I want to build a F Kie, and move it to Den to give me a third fleet on
    the
    Nth.&gt;&gt;
    
    Sounds good to me.  Christian is going to have a bitch kitty of a time
    holding what hes got now.
    
    &lt;&lt;Perhaps A Pic-Par, A Bel-Pic, F Hol-Bel supported by Ruhr, and A Mar-Gas
    supported by Spain....  This would leave A Spain vulnerable, but it would
    certainly
    ensure that I would regain/keep Brest!&gt;&gt;
    
    Maybe Bur S A Mar -&gt; Gas as well as F Naf -&gt; MAO?  it could annhialate that
    Gasconish fleet.  Wouldn't that be lovely!
    
    Spain could get whacked this way if Christian orders Gascony -&gt; Spain
    supported by Portugal, but that seems a bad move on General Principal.
    
    &lt;&lt;I think that I am more valuable to you as an
    ally
    vs. England than I am as a "feeding ground" for your armies.  Let Russia
    serve
    in
    THAT capacity!&gt;&gt;
    
    i couldn't agree more!
    
    My builds are in!
    
    Chris
