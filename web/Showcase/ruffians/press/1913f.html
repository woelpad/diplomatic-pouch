    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Paul,
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Well, you are quite right, I have created an English monster.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; If you are interested, I will be ordering Kiel to support Denmark to hold.
    &gt; &gt; This should free you to defend Paris and Belgium.  Or you could take Kiel.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; At this point I have no further designs on German centers, and indeed
    &gt; &gt; cherish you as a buffer against England!
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Chris
    &gt;
    &gt; Chris;
    &gt;      As a safety measure, I will no longer be telling anyone what I plan to do
    &gt; with my
    &gt; units.  However, I won't try to suicide out to you OR Christian (if that's any
    &gt; hint).
    &gt;
    &gt; Paul

    Gents,
    
    Whew.  Cal, you had me sweating there!  but now that the retreat is in, I
    have some thoughts, and possibly a plan.
    
    Thoughts:
    
    Does it seem likely to anyone else that I will lose Kiel this season?  I
    can't call Paul anymore -- will he suicide out against me, or will he defend
    what he has?
    
    Does anyone know if Christian believes that R/T is solid, weakening, or
    anything?  Any intell on that front?  Could we create some mis-information
    there?
    
    Plans:
    
    Ok, the first thing I would like to do, is get a turkish fleet past the boot
    of Italy, while maintaining my sanity.  I would like to offer to you, Meef,
    the lovely resort of Tunis!  Yes, Tunis, blessed coastal province beloved of
    all sea-going Europeans.  How do we get you there?
    
    Meef, dig this set of orders:  (sorry, I've been talking to a lot of swing
    people lately -- I am teaching some workshops in Denver next weekend, and
    have been promoting it.)
    
    F Ionian -&gt; Emed
    F Albania -&gt; Greece
    A Serbia S F Albania -&gt; Greece
    F Tyn -&gt; GoL
    
    F Aegean S F Greece -&gt; Ionian
    F Greece -&gt; Ionian
    F Smy -&gt; Emed
    F Bul -&gt; Gre
    F Bla S A Rum
    
    Ok, so what happens?
    
    Ionian is dislodged, and retreats to Naples
    Greece becomes Austrian (for the moment)
    Turkey has fleets in Bul, Black, Smy, Aeg, and Ionian, and can remove either
    Smy or Bla.
    
    Now, all of this is predicated on the Idea that I will lose Kiel.  I am
    trying to keep the front numbers open.
    
    Next year, we can push TWO turkish fleets towards the atlantic, with Ion -&gt;
    Tun/Aeg-&gt;Ion, and then in the fall Tun -&gt; Naf/ Ion -&gt; Tun.
    
    This redresses the SC imbalance, and actually gives us a fleet advantage in
    the Westmed, if I also have two fleets there.
    
    Now, I am leaving myself open to a massive stab here -- F ionian to
    Adriadic/ Aegean -&gt; Ionian simply ruins my whole year.  So, in return, I am
    asking for Greece in advance.  You will have three units on it, and I will
    be unable to hold it, without your continuing goodwill.  You did say you
    were willing to be patient.  In the worst case, I create another stalemate
    situation.  If I, for example, supported Ionian to hold, I would be leaving
    myself open to England, and all my fleets would be forced to try to hold
    Turkey back.
    
    
    At or about this point, Cal should be building his Second northern fleet.
    England shouldn't be able to handle the pressure from both sides of his
    lines.
    
    Ok -- that was plan one.
    
    Plan 2, in the north
    
    Kiel supports Denmark to hold.  (Shudder)  If I tell Paul I am doing this,
    and then do it, I win some cred with him (not that I could get anywhere near
    positive again), AND it slows england down.
    
    Meef, you're the only one who hasn't lied to Paul yet.  Have you any
    relations with him at all?
    
    Cal, how do you want to DMZ?  I'd like to see you back in Prussia, rather
    than Silesia, and Sev rather than Ukraine.  I am content to hold in Bud and
    Ser, as well.  Galicia to Vienna? Bohemia?  Let me know.
    
    Ok, long post.  Lets plan plans!

    Just a quick note til later.  I agree with you and I think you should tell
    Chris exactly what you told me.  He's trying to get his security at the cost
    of yours and you don't like it.  Tell him what you told me and I'll back it

    Cal,
    
    Thanks for the note, I will be looking for your post tonight.  I do get
    twitchy, as you know . . .;)
    
    Meef,
    
    Ok.  I am not willing to give you control of the Ionian AND greece at this
    time.  I have concerns regarding vulnerability as well.   I am not asking
    you to trust me blindly, or to hang your tuckus out where the breezes blow.
    
    I will be moving F Tyn away from you.
    F Ionian, due to the bounce in Eastmed, will be forced to retreat away from
    you.
    
    That leaves F Greece, which will have turkish fleets in the Ionian,
    Bulgaria, and the Aegean surrounding it.  I am putting everything at risk
    here -- the Ionian is the heart of my position, it holds down my entire
    southern flank.
    
    And you want to go through it, in a R/A./T alliance.  That's ok.  However, I
    dont think a little insurance on my part is unreasonable.  At 4 centers for
    one year, you will have a much harder time stabbing me -- for exactly the
    security reasons you mention.  You would be vulnerable to a R/A
    counterstrike, because you wouldn't have enough fleets to cover all your
    bases.   Next year, you will take Tunis, AND have control over Greece,
    whether you take it or not depending on the situation in the north, I think.
    
    I am willing to come down in SC count.  I am not married to my dots.  But, I
    want a reasonable amount of security in return.  I am sure I don't need to
    point out that I CAN draw the line here -- I can hold the Ionian against
    you, and given the army situation, I can probably hold the rest of my
    centers from R/T.  But that doesn't do ME any good, if England then comes
    and clobbers my rear.  Nor indeed does it do you any good, for the same
    reason -- Russia and I will have to work together to stop England.
    
    Meef, I guess this is me swinging from nice guy to mean guy again.  ;)
    heheheh.  Turkey is still around because Cal doesn't trust me.  If he did,
    we would work to eliminate you, and take a three way draw with England.
    That is what was happening in about 1908 or so, when I stabbed Cal because
    his position in the Balkans was too good, and I was being distracted by
    Italy.  I never intended to eliminate him -- StPete was too important
    (though why christian gave it back to you, Cal, instead of taking it himself
    remains a mystery to me.  It was either a very good play, or a very bad one,
    and I don't know which yet.)
    
    My point?  I do have one.  Working you out to the med is a good thing for
    me.  It frees me up to fight Christian in the north.  It is also a bad thing
    for me, in that you have allready stabbed me once (without, I submit,
    reasonable cause) and I really don't trust you that much.  I will not give
    up the Ionian while you are at 5 centers.  I will not give it up if you are
    in Aegean and Eastmed at the same time.
    
    Thoughts?

    Chris,
    
    U made mention of my second season stab.  Although is seemed unwarranted, I

    &gt; F Ionian, due to the bounce in Eastmed, will be forced to retreat
    &gt; away from
    &gt; you.
    &gt;
    &gt; That leaves F Greece, which will have turkish fleets in the Ionian,
    &gt; Bulgaria, and the Aegean surrounding it.  I am putting everything at risk
    &gt; here -- the Ionian is the heart of my position, it holds down my entire
    &gt; southern flank.
    &gt;
    &gt; And you want to go through it, in a R/A./T alliance.  That's ok.
    &gt; However, I
    &gt; dont think a little insurance on my part is unreasonable.  At 4
    &gt; centers for
    &gt; one year, you will have a much harder time stabbing me -- for exactly the
    &gt; security reasons you mention.  You would be vulnerable to a R/A
    &gt; counterstrike, because you wouldn't have enough fleets to cover all your
    &gt; bases.   Next year, you will take Tunis, AND have control over Greece,
    &gt; whether you take it or not depending on the situation in the
    &gt; north, I think.
    &gt;
    
    I understand your need for security.
    
    Say i have fleets in:
    Gre
    Bul(sc)
    aeg (leaving eas open for security)
    Ion
    bla
    
    Then what?
    
    I need a f bla to protect from all the forward Austrian armies.  Will these
    pull back, say dmz of Gal?  If so, this will free up a fleet for the med.
    
    Where would u want Ion to go next?
    
    Is there a chance I am eek Tunis outta u?
    
    With Tun and Bla freed up, this should give me some ability to make a
    reasonable presence in the med.
    
    Is there a way u can place some units in the boot and along the coast
    provide some increased security for yourself.  How about:
    f alb - the boot for security
    a tyr - the boot for security
    a gal - the coast for security
    
    Then f tyn and f ion to the med along with 2 turkish fleets we can plug up
    and add pressure on that flank while Russia adds pressure from the other
    Flank.
    
    Proposed moves:
    
    With the following moves:
    
    f aeg - ion
    f gre s aeg - ion
    f smy - aeg
    f bla s rum
    f bul(sc) s gre
    
    f ion - ?(not eas) (retreating to Tun)
    f alb - adr
    a ser s gal - bud
    a bud - tri
    a tyr - ven
    a pie h
    
    a ukr s rum
    a rum s ukr
    a war s sil ?
    
    I think this will position ourselves for a guarded cooperation.  There will
    be a limit on how many units we can put on the line due to the exposure we
    have from one another.
    
    &gt; I am willing to come down in SC count.  I am not married to my
    &gt; dots.  But, I
    &gt; want a reasonable amount of security in return.  I am sure I don't need to
    &gt; point out that I CAN draw the line here -- I can hold the Ionian against
    &gt; you, and given the army situation, I can probably hold the rest of my
    &gt; centers from R/T.  But that doesn't do ME any good, if England then comes
    &gt; and clobbers my rear.  Nor indeed does it do you any good, for the same
    &gt; reason -- Russia and I will have to work together to stop England.
    &gt;
    &gt; Meef, I guess this is me swinging from nice guy to mean guy again.  ;)
    &gt; heheheh.  Turkey is still around because Cal doesn't trust me.  If he did,
    &gt; we would work to eliminate you, and take a three way draw with England.
    &gt; That is what was happening in about 1908 or so, when I stabbed Cal because
    &gt; his position in the Balkans was too good, and I was being distracted by
    &gt; Italy.  I never intended to eliminate him -- StPete was too important
    &gt; (though why christian gave it back to you, Cal, instead of taking
    &gt; it himself
    &gt; remains a mystery to me.  It was either a very good play, or a
    &gt; very bad one,
    &gt; and I don't know which yet.)
    &gt;
    &gt; My point?  I do have one.  Working you out to the med is a good thing for
    &gt; me.  It frees me up to fight Christian in the north.  It is also
    &gt; a bad thing
    &gt; for me, in that you have allready stabbed me once (without, I submit,
    &gt; reasonable cause) and I really don't trust you that much.  I will not give
    &gt; up the Ionian while you are at 5 centers.  I will not give it up
    &gt; if you are
    &gt; in Aegean and Eastmed at the same time.
    &gt;
    
    See credibility plea at top.
    I do not see a need to be in eas and Aeg at the same time, waist of
    resources.

    Meef,
    
    I accept that YOU had reasons for your stab.  I dont think you had correctly
    assessed the situation, though.
    
    In any case, Let me state again:
    
    I will NOT give up the Ionian when you have 5 centers.
    
    I don't know how to be more clear about that.  Either Greece goes to the
    Ionian, and we bounce in the Eastmed and I take Greece, or I support Ionian
    to hold.
    
    This is non-negotiable.  I could have popped Greece in the spring, and held
    it in the fall.  I did not, in the interests of working together.  I will be
    moving out of Galicia, I am simply waiting for Cal so we can decide exactly
    HOW we can do that.  This should alleviate the need for Fleet Black.
    
    If you look at my plan closely, you will see that it puts Turkey at ZERO
    risk from me.  If you have other issues, I am willing to hear them.  If, at
    any point, I balk on our agreement, you can re-take Greece.  Also, once you
    are in the Ionian, I have no choices.  I must work with you, for you will
    have me exposed.
    
    Thats the way I see it.  If you have another plan, that can change my mind,
    I wait to hear it.  As far as I can tell, though, you arent even reading
    what I write.

    I think we're going to have to play it Chris's way for now.  He does hold
    all the cards when it comes to a Med stalemate.  The upside is that, once
    you ARE in the Med, you'll be able to grow by three or more within a year or
    two, after the stab.
    
    I understand your apprehensions and share them.  I just don't see any way,
    other than all-out attack, that we can force him to let us advance.  If he
    does renege on anything, I'll jump on him with both feet from my end.

    &gt;Message from tremewanc@worldnet.att.net as Austria to Russia and Turkey in
    &gt;'ruffians':
    
    Just a quick reply here.  Things are still hectic around here, but I'm off
    work today, so I've got a few minutes.
    
    &gt;Whew.  Cal, you had me sweating there!  but now that the retreat is in, I
    &gt;have some thoughts, and possibly a plan.
    
    Wasn't me, I had my retreat in in plenty of time.  It was the Judge down and
    outage...
    
    &gt;Thoughts:
    &gt;
    &gt;Does it seem likely to anyone else that I will lose Kiel this season?  I
    &gt;can't call Paul anymore -- will he suicide out against me, or will he
    &gt;defend
    &gt;what he has?
    
    Hard to tell.  Paul isn't writing to me so, unless he's really DOESN'T care
    about the game (I would find that hard to believe), he must be talking to
    England about *something*...
    
    &gt;Does anyone know if Christian believes that R/T is solid, weakening, or
    &gt;anything?  Any intell on that front?  Could we create some mis-information
    &gt;there?
    
    He hasn't mentioned anything to me, but he can obviously see what's in front
    of him.  I suppose I could create some mis-info.  I'm using the move to the
    Black Sea as an "excuse" for my disband.
    
    &gt;Plans:
    &gt;
    &gt;Ok, the first thing I would like to do, is get a turkish fleet past the
    &gt;boot
    &gt;of Italy, while maintaining my sanity.  I would like to offer to you, Meef,
    &gt;the lovely resort of Tunis!  Yes, Tunis, blessed coastal province beloved
    &gt;of
    &gt;all sea-going Europeans.  How do we get you there?
    
    By boat?  &lt;G&gt;
    
    &gt;Meef, dig this set of orders:  (sorry, I've been talking to a lot of swing
    &gt;people lately -- I am teaching some workshops in Denver next weekend, and
    &gt;have been promoting it.)
    
    I'm hip!  I'm hip!
    
    &lt;Suggested moves snipped&gt;
    
    &lt;Explanation of suggestion moves snipped&gt;
    
    &gt;Now, I am leaving myself open to a massive stab here -- F ionian to
    &gt;Adriadic/ Aegean -&gt; Ionian simply ruins my whole year.  So, in return, I am
    &gt;asking for Greece in advance.  You will have three units on it, and I will
    &gt;be unable to hold it, without your continuing goodwill.  You did say you
    &gt;were willing to be patient.  In the worst case, I create another stalemate
    &gt;situation.  If I, for example, supported Ionian to hold, I would be leaving
    &gt;myself open to England, and all my fleets would be forced to try to hold
    &gt;Turkey back.
    
    I can see where Meef would be a little tenuous about losing a centre just to
    keep you from removing, but I understand your paranoia as well.  I'll let
    you guys work this one out since my only concern is that something happens
    FAST enough to keep England from moving into the Med.  We're lucky that
    England is scared of becoming a target by growing too fast (at least, I'm
    assuming that's his reason for not sweeping around Spain).
    
    &gt;Plan 2, in the north
    &gt;
    &gt;Kiel supports Denmark to hold.  (Shudder)  If I tell Paul I am doing this,
    &gt;and then do it, I win some cred with him (not that I could get anywhere
    &gt;near
    &gt;positive again), AND it slows england down.
    
    Well, it isn't like Paul has never believed you before...
    
    &gt;Cal, how do you want to DMZ?  I'd like to see you back in Prussia, rather
    &gt;than Silesia, and Sev rather than Ukraine.  I am content to hold in Bud and
    &gt;Ser, as well.  Galicia to Vienna? Bohemia?  Let me know.
    
    What are your plans for Berlin?  I assume you're not talking about this year
    for the promised turnover?  I don't see where it really makes much
    difference if I'm in Sil or Pru.  You'll have to trust me that I'm certainly
    not about to start working with Paul (supporting him anywhere or cutting any
    of your supports wouldn't exactly be productive for me, would it?).  I WILL
    move Ukr-Sev.  It will look natural with the fleet in Black anyway.  I'd
    like to see Gal back in Vie.  Is this copascetic?

    Ok, Meef and I are deep in discussion over Greece.  I am pretty adamant that
    I get it in return for the Ionian, and upon reflection, that has nothing to
    do with Kiel!  I am jsut plain scared!  If I get another build, I'll waive

    Ok I get the point.  I am more interested in a cooperation that a stalemate.
    
    &gt;  I will be

    Zero risk in Diplomacy, novel idea!

    &gt; Message from mehaffey@ape-i.com as Turkey to Austria in 'ruffians':
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Chris,
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Meef,
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; I accept that YOU had reasons for your stab.  I dont think you
    &gt; &gt; had correctly
    &gt; &gt; assessed the situation, though.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; In any case, Let me state again:
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; I will NOT give up the Ionian when you have 5 centers.
    &gt; &gt; I don't know how to be more clear about that.  Either Greece goes to the
    &gt; &gt; Ionian, and we bounce in the Eastmed and I take Greece, or I
    &gt; &gt; support Ionian
    &gt; &gt; to hold.
    &gt; &gt; This is non-negotiable.  I could have popped Greece in the
    &gt; &gt; spring, and held
    &gt; &gt; it in the fall.  I did not, in the interests of working together.
    &gt;
    &gt; Ok I get the point.  I am more interested in a cooperation that a
    &gt; stalemate.
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;  I will be
    &gt; &gt; moving out of Galicia, I am simply waiting for Cal so we can
    &gt; &gt; decide exactly
    &gt; &gt; HOW we can do that.  This should alleviate the need for Fleet Black.
    &gt;
    &gt; I will be able to utilize f bla, which is good.
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt; If you look at my plan closely, you will see that it puts Turkey at ZERO
    &gt; &gt; risk from me.
    &gt;
    &gt; Zero risk in Diplomacy, novel idea!
    &gt;
    &gt; If you have other issues, I am willing to hear
    &gt; &gt; them.  If, at
    &gt; &gt; any point, I balk on our agreement, you can re-take Greece.
    &gt; &gt; Also, once you
    &gt; &gt; are in the Ionian, I have no choices.  I must work with you,
    &gt; for you will
    &gt; &gt; have me exposed.
    &gt; &gt; Thats the way I see it.  If you have another plan, that can
    &gt; &gt; change my mind,
    &gt; &gt; I wait to hear it.  As far as I can tell, though, you arent even reading
    &gt; &gt; what I write.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Chris
    &gt;
    &gt; I am interested in how and when I will get the unit I lost back.  I assume
    &gt; Tunis in the spring.
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;What are your plans for Berlin?  I assume you're not talking
    &gt; about this
    &gt; &gt; year
    &gt; &gt; for the promised turnover?  I don't see where it really makes much
    &gt; &gt; difference if I'm in Sil or Pru.  You'll have to trust me that
    &gt; &gt; I'm certainly
    &gt; &gt; not about to start working with Paul (supporting him anywhere or
    &gt; &gt; cutting any
    &gt; &gt; of your supports wouldn't exactly be productive for me, would
    &gt; &gt; it?).  I WILL
    &gt; &gt; move Ukr-Sev.  It will look natural with the fleet in Black anyway.  I'd
    &gt; &gt; like to see Gal back in Vie.  Is this copascetic?
    &gt;
    &gt; dmz of gal is crucial
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Thoughts, guys?
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Cal&gt;&gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Cal, you had me on the floor with that dry little comment --
    &gt; its not like
    &gt; &gt; Paul has never belived you before . . .
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Heheheheh.  Rich.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Ok, Meef and I are deep in discussion over Greece.  I am pretty
    &gt; &gt; adamant that
    &gt; &gt; I get it in return for the Ionian, and upon reflection, that has
    &gt; &gt; nothing to
    &gt; &gt; do with Kiel!  I am jsut plain scared!
    &gt;
    &gt; I wonder who is the most scared!!
    &gt;
    &gt; If I get another build, I'll waive
    &gt; &gt; it and turn Berlin over to Cal next year.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Meef, you may not believe this, but I CAN be a solid alliance player.  I
    &gt; &gt; couldn't have gotten here if that weren't true.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; I have never had any doubt of your level of play, and having become good
    &gt; with alliances is surely part of your overall play.
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Berlin will be supporting Kiel to hold.  Silesia/ Prussia, yes, little
    &gt; &gt; difference.  Just less tension if you're in Prussia, is all.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;  Gal -&gt; Vie, copasetic it is!
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; may I share?  I just bought a new CD -- Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams
    &gt; &gt; Sings.  If you love the count, you gotta love this stuff!
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Chris
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; How about not bouncing me out of eas?
    &gt; I will be at 4 sc but in a more forward position to get to the med like we
    &gt; agreed.
    &gt;
    &gt; I am willing to issue:
    &gt;
    &gt; F Aeg S Gre - ion
    &gt; F Gre - Ion
    &gt; F Smy - eas
    &gt; F Bul(sc) - Gre
    &gt; F Bla S A Rum
    &gt;
    &gt; If u will not bounce me out of eas.
    &gt;
    &gt; Thoughts?

    Meef,
    
    Hmmm.  well, we are closer to an agreement, at least -- yes, Tunis next
    spring, that was to be the exchange.
    
    &lt;&lt;How about not bouncing me out of eas?
    I will be at 4 sc but in a more forward position to get to the med like we
    agreed.&gt;&gt;
    
    But remember my other little condition?
    
    Not while you are in the Aegean and the Eastmed at the same time?
    
    Simply put, I want to reduce the chance of you stabbing me.  Now, I know you
    want to eliminate the chances of me stabbing you!  However, at this time, I
    am much more at risk than you.  Yes, even though I have twice as many
    centers, I have four fronts to defend -- you have two.
    
    Ok.  My proposed moves again:
    
    Austria:
    
    F Tyn -&gt; Gol
    F Ion -&gt; Eastmed
    F Albania -&gt; Greece
    A Serbia S F Albania -&gt; Greece
    A Galicia -&gt; Vienna
    A Bud -&gt; Gal
    
    Turkey:
    
    F Black S A Rum
    F Greece -&gt; Ionain
    F Aegean S F Greece -&gt; Ionian
    F Smy -&gt; Eastmed
    F Bul -&gt; Greece
    
    Russia:
    
    A Ukr -&gt; Sev
    A War -&gt; Gal
    A Rum Hold
    
    Ok, this DMZ's Galicia and Ukraine.  Rumania becomes supported by Sev.
    Ionian Retreats to Naples.  Turkey removes one, I am even or build one.  The
    closest unit I have to Turkey is F Greece, which is surrounded by three
    turkish fleets, and whose only support is cuttable from Rumania.
    
    Next year, regardles of my progress into France, I will turn over Berlin to
    Russia, for a second fleet build.  Tunis will go to Turkey, redressing the
    SC count -- however, it is my hope that that build will be waived in the
    interests of peace!  We shall see at the time.  Perhaps another fleet to
    occupy the Black ad infinitum would give everyone security.  In any case,
    that leaves me -2 sc's, -3 if Greece goes away as well.  In this situation,
    at this time, we don't need more units, we need the units we have to get to
    the front.
    
    Cal, I ask you -- is this too much to ask Meef?  A sc for my security?  In
    my mind, it is a token -- he can re-take it at any time, should I deviate
    from the plan.  I really, really fear him breaking my southern flank open.

    I don't think it's THAT much to ask, although I can certainly understand
    Meef's point of view.  Frankly, the idea of not trusting you is one that
    doesn't exactly require the firing of more than a handful of neurons, but I
    think he's pretty safe here.  I assume you know that if you were to cross
    him, I'd be heading straight for the Austrian homeland and damn the
    consequences...?  With that in mind, I'm pretty sure you'll play this
    straight.
    
    Question: did you type the moves you suggested for me correctly?
    
    &gt;A Ukr -&gt; Sev
    &gt;A War -&gt; Gal
    &gt;A Rum Hold
    
    Or are you planning a Bud-Gal bounce?  If so, that would be fine.

    PS: I'm about to head out into a raging snowstorm.  If you write back
    immediately, I won't be getting back to you as fast as usual.

    &gt; &gt; Ok, this DMZ's Galicia and Ukraine.  Rumania becomes supported by Sev.
    &gt; &gt; Ionian Retreats to Naples.  Turkey removes one, I am even or
    &gt; &gt; build one.  The
    &gt; &gt; closest unit I have to Turkey is F Greece, which is surrounded by three
    &gt; &gt; turkish fleets, and whose only support is cuttable from Rumania.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Next year, regardles of my progress into France, I will turn over
    &gt; &gt; Berlin to
    &gt; &gt; Russia, for a second fleet build.  Tunis will go to Turkey,
    &gt; redressing the
    &gt; &gt; SC count -- however, it is my hope that that build will be waived in the
    &gt; &gt; interests of peace!  We shall see at the time.  Perhaps another fleet to
    &gt; &gt; occupy the Black ad infinitum would give everyone security.  In
    &gt; any case,
    &gt; &gt; that leaves me -2 sc's, -3 if Greece goes away as well.  In this
    &gt; &gt; situation,
    &gt; &gt; at this time, we don't need more units, we need the units we have
    &gt; &gt; to get to
    &gt; &gt; the front.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Cal, I ask you -- is this too much to ask Meef?  A sc for my
    &gt; security?  In
    &gt; &gt; my mind, it is a token -- he can re-take it at any time, should
    &gt; I deviate
    &gt; &gt; from the plan.  I really, really fear him breaking my southern
    &gt; flank open.

    Okay, the sled is in the garage, the dogs are fed and back in their kennel
    and my parka is hanging by the fire in the meat house.  Time to write some
    letters.
    
    Chris, at first glance, I was happy enough to do the moves you suggested
    but, on second glance, I see that I am leaving myself open to having you
    take Rumania.  If I leave Ukr THIS turn, aren't I leaving myself open to
    what you were worried about earlier?  I know I could use the move to Sev as
    a ruse to England and say that I'm worried about Turkey (same reason as for
    my disband), but I think I'm more worried about you right now than
    Christian.
    
    I will support Rumania in place from Ukr and vacate NEXT turn.  Once I build
    a fleet up north, all bets are off anyway.
    
    Ca va? (Okay?)

    Whoops!  My bad phrasing.  I actually have a build this turn.  You have the
    tough call on the disband.  Tough to pick one German unit you can pull that
    doesn't lead to another lost center next year.
    
    Care to discuss options?  Clearly, I can't be trusted.  ;)  However, I do
    have a vested interest in you holding those centers, rather than Christian.

    You realize, of course, what a devastating build F Sev would be, right?  ;)
    I think the qualities you were looking for before are in place -- my fleets
    are at the other end of the Med, and my armies away from Russia.
    
    Look at the map and tell me it's not a good move for Russia -- I'll be busy

    Cal,
    
    &gt;From my perspective nothing has changed with Chris.  Still the same
    backstabbing sob as before.  Do u think it wise to open up another front
    with England now?  I think we are not gonna get weaker that we are currently
    in Austria's eyes unless r/e war breaks out heavily.  I think he  is
    counting on the English front keeping us weak enough to handle (or get r/t
    to stab each other).  What will happen if u build a fleet in stp.  Is this
    the wisest build? What about a build in stpsc.  That unit could be sold to
    England and be utilized on 2 fronts.  What is the wisest disband of Turkey?
    Do u think tyn will bounce me outta Tun and keep me from building a unit
    this year?  I am as nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof.  Chris continually
    tries to sell this line he can be an alliance player but out of the other
    side of his mouth he is covertly trying to split up the alliance.

    Pros?  Geez, if someone's getting paid for this, I want a piece! &lt;G&gt;
    
    You've basically hit on what's been bugging me for some time now.  I REALLY
    REALLY don't know if I want to build that fleet that Chris so dearly wants.
    I think you're exactly right that Chris wants me to get involved in a war
    with England so that i become less of a threat to him.
    
    Geez, I wonder if I could pass off an ARMY in St Pete as a misorder?  Nah..
    
    As for your build, I'd say that F Bla is probably best with me building an
    army either in Sev or Mos.  I have to keep in mind what could happen if
    Chris was to order every one of his armies straight east.
    
    Pardon me while I think out loud here: If I build an army, Chris WILL be
    pissed, no doubt, but that MAY not mean he'll be angry with you.  Perhaps,
    if I do that, you could write him and say that you upset with me for not
    sticking to the plan. Then you could agree to some moves against me WITH
    him.  If he decides to trust you, you could take Greece back and slip into
    Naples at the same time.  heck, the best possible thing would be that he
    decides he doesn't NEED to head all his force east because he'll have your
    help...  After that, hopefully, you'd be able to build at least one army (we
    need one in Bul if we're to make any progress against him - in fact, an army
    in Bul is probably his biggest fear right now).  I'd just have to try to
    hold on as best I could in Russia and hope he doesn't throw EVERYTHING at
    me.
    
    Hmmm...  What do you think?

    Anyway, I'm still in the position that, as goes Turkey goes, so goes I.
    That's why I'm sticking (and HAVE stuck) to the plan you outlined.

    Cal,
    
    I would like to tippy - toe on this tight rope as long as possible and
    accomplish the following goals in order of priority:
    
    1.  r/t stay solid
    2.  Keep Austria headed away from us.
    3.  Not alienate England.
    4.  Get Tunis and Ber w/o alienating Chris.
    5.  Keep England at bay.
    6.  Creep forward without minimal alarm (if a frog is put in cold water and
    gradually heated up, it boils to death.   A frog put into boiling water will
    jump out)
    7.  Keep Austria confused.
    
    Can u build a f stpsc and maintain 2, 3, 4, 5?
    I think building an army may blow 2, 4
    
    Could u ask permission from Christian about building f stpsc?  U need a
    fleet to make progress into the German homeland.
    
    I think a stab now is fool-hearted.
    
    Thoughts?

    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt;From my perspective nothing has changed with Chris.  Still the same
    &gt; &gt; backstabbing sob as before.  Do u think it wise to open up another front
    &gt; &gt; with England now?  I think we are not gonna get weaker that we are
    &gt; currently
    &gt; &gt; in Austria's eyes unless r/e war breaks out heavily.  I think he  is
    &gt; &gt; counting on the English front keeping us weak enough to handle
    &gt; (or get r/t
    &gt; &gt; to stab each other).  What will happen if u build a fleet in
    &gt; stp.  Is this
    &gt; &gt; the wisest build? What about a build in stpsc.  That unit could
    &gt; be sold to
    &gt; &gt; England and be utilized on 2 fronts.  What is the wisest disband of
    &gt; Turkey?
    &gt; &gt; Do u think tyn will bounce me outta Tun and keep me from building a unit
    &gt; &gt; this year?  I am as nervous as a cat on a hot tin roof.  Chris
    &gt; continually
    &gt; &gt; tries to sell this line he can be an alliance player but out of
    &gt; the other
    &gt; &gt; side of his mouth he is covertly trying to split up the alliance.
    &gt; &gt; Ergggggg!!!!  Youse pros, youse pros.   Ergggggg!!!!  Youse
    &gt; pro.............
    &gt;
    &gt; Pros?  Geez, if someone's getting paid for this, I want a piece! &lt;G&gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; You've basically hit on what's been bugging me for some time now.
    &gt;  I REALLY
    &gt; REALLY don't know if I want to build that fleet that Chris so
    &gt; dearly wants.
    &gt; I think you're exactly right that Chris wants me to get involved in a war
    &gt; with England so that i become less of a threat to him.
    &gt;
    &gt; Geez, I wonder if I could pass off an ARMY in St Pete as a
    &gt; misorder?  Nah..
    &gt;
    &gt; As for your build, I'd say that F Bla is probably best with me building an
    &gt; army either in Sev or Mos.  I have to keep in mind what could happen if
    &gt; Chris was to order every one of his armies straight east.
    &gt;
    &gt; Pardon me while I think out loud here: If I build an army, Chris WILL be
    &gt; pissed, no doubt, but that MAY not mean he'll be angry with you.  Perhaps,
    &gt; if I do that, you could write him and say that you upset with me for not
    &gt; sticking to the plan. Then you could agree to some moves against me WITH
    &gt; him.  If he decides to trust you, you could take Greece back and slip into
    &gt; Naples at the same time.  heck, the best possible thing would be that he
    &gt; decides he doesn't NEED to head all his force east because he'll have your
    &gt; help...  After that, hopefully, you'd be able to build at least
    &gt; one army (we
    &gt; need one in Bul if we're to make any progress against him - in
    &gt; fact, an army
    &gt; in Bul is probably his biggest fear right now).  I'd just have to try to
    &gt; hold on as best I could in Russia and hope he doesn't throw EVERYTHING at
    &gt; me.
    &gt;
    &gt; Hmmm...  What do you think?

    Christian: I have a problem and I need your input on it.
    
    Chris has been threatening to throw the game to you for the last two turns.
    That's why I haven't been more aggressive towards him.  He's also basically
    *insisting* that I build a fleet in St Pete's north coast this turn and get
    involved in a war with you.  He points out, correctly, that if he was to
    throw everything he has at me and Turkey, you would easily walk into an 18
    centre victory.  That puts me in the dilemma of either doing what he says
    and getting into a foolish war with you (one lousy fleet in Stp is not
    enough to start hostilities even if I was so inclined, which I'm not) or NOT
    doing what he says and have the Austrian hordes sweep across the Russian
    homeland while you walk in behind.  I'm sure the latter option doesn't worry
    you muchly, but I don't want to see anyone solo here (unless it's me! &lt;G&gt;).
    
    Here's what I hope to do.  I'm going to satisfy Chris's request to build a
    northern fleet.  Sort of.  I'm going to build a fleet in St Pete SOUTH coast
    for eventual use against him in the German homeland.  This fleet will NOT
    threaten any of your holdings in Scandinavia and, once Chris's fate has been
    sealed, I will be happy to disband it so we can declare a three-way draw
    (ERT).
    
    I'm REALLY hoping that you can recognize the dilemma I'm in and that the
    fact that I'm being honest about it will mean that we don't have to go to
    war over it.  Right now, Chris is carrying a bigger stick than you are in
    terms of what he can do to me and I have to make SOME decision.
    
    Please get back to me. I know you're busy these days with diapers and
    formula, but I need to hear some input from you.
    
    Thanks,
    
    Cal

    Yeah, but probably not as foolhearty as getting into a war with England

    &gt; Chris
    
    Yes, he needs armies to make much more progress in the mainland (that is, to
    give
    you much more competition for German dots?) and he really has enough fleets to
    stuff up the doorway in/out of the Med (if he ever has any interest to do so).
     It is hard to believe that he was in serious danger only a few gameyears
    ago, isn't
    it?
     Russia, also, was in danger of falling to 2 centers only a short time ago.
    Turkey
    was safely contained.  I wonder how things got so bad again?

    Cal,
    
    It is ok with me that you build a fleet StP(sc). As we said before we need
    a very casual way of eliminating Austria for you not to think I might
    soloing. This is why I moved into Spain rather than Wes, as this is more
    defensive and less offensive against Chris´ centers.
    
    By the way, Chris has been writing to me that he is sure Turkey will stab
    you next move. He also tells me that Turkey used to forward anything
    antirussian sent to him to you. One could think that he wanting you to
    build StP is part of getting Turkey to stab you.
    
    If you want to I can send a mail to Turkey and ask him to stab you. If he
    will not stab you I guess he will tell me something and then send you the
    mesage to show you he is your friend. What do you think?

    Ok,
    
    I have two choices here -- build nothing, or build something.
    
    I am planning on turning Berlin over to Cal next year, and Tunis to Meef as

    Don't worry about it.  I just got a message from England saying he was going
    to do it.
    
    Basically, England is with us against Chris, certainly for the time being.
    Chris wrote him a letter saying that a Turkish stab of Russia was imminent
    and he believed it.  I told him that Chris was just doing his usual
    pot-stirring and you and I were solid.  He said he wanted to try a test of
    your loyalty and he was going to ask you to stab me.  I told him it wasn't
    necessary, but he wanted to do it anyway.  Whatever.  Just more wheels
    within wheels.
    
    Tell him you're not interested, but tell him you MAY want to talk later
    after Chris is down and out.  That will keep him interested and we may be
    able to take advantage of that.

    Dear Christian,
    
    Good to hear from u and hope the new family addition is doing well.  The

    &gt; What are the chances that you and I aim to diminish Russias influence in
    &gt; this game? I am sure he trustes you more than me. Therefore, if I move to

    Chris,
    
    I cannot see why you have to convince Russia to build a northern fleet. If
    you are going to attack him a SOUTHERN fleet would be better, wouldn't it?
    Maybe that is not possible though. My guess is that Cal is building StP
    anyway. OK, so you promise to give me any German centers I need to stop the
    Russian bear in the north. Good enough, but aren't you afraid I will walk
    south into the Med? Or do you still threaten to give the victory away to
    Turkey (of all!!) if I sail south?

    &gt;Message from christian.dreyer.712@student.lu.se as England to Russia in
    &gt;'ruffians':
    
    (Meef, you might want to read the quoted text at the bottom before you read
    my message)
    
    Christian:
    
    I guess I can assume that you didn't mean to send this to me?  Usually, I
    don't point it out when someone makes mistakes like this, figuring I can use
    it to my advantage, but this time it's different.  I think this is a good
    example of what Chris is doing to the whole board.
    
    As you know, Turkey passes me some of the more inflammatory stuff Chris
    writes, so I have a good idea of what's being said.  Your mis-sent
    communication just adds to my total picture.
    
    Here's what Chris is doing:
    
    1) He's writing to me to demand I build northern fleets to stop you from
    winning.  He is offering me Berlin and Denmark and threatening to throw the
    game to you.
    
    2) He's trying to get Turkey to stab me and is offering the Turk Tunis and
    more centres to the west (as well as mine) to do so and is ALSO threatening
    to throw the game to you.
    
    3) He's is trying to get you to attack me up north and is offering to give
    you German centres to support this attack and is threatening to throw the
    game to Turkey.
    
    Gentleman, he is trying to play us all for suckers in an attempt to get us
    at each other's throats.  Okay, so that IS the point of the game, but I
    think we'd better turn it back on him by NOT FALLING FOR WHAT HE IS SAYING!
    
    Christian, Meef and I have been playing the waiting game, looking for an
    opening to take Chris out.  We are not in a position to do so just yet but,
    with Turkey in the Ion, it's probably just a matter of time.  Obviously, you
    are worried about Chris's threats or you would be in the Med by now.  I
    think it's time we all worked together to frustrate his plans and take him
    out.  After that, we can either settle for a 3-way draw or let the chips
    settle where they may.  We can decide that when the time comes, but it's
    pretty clear what we need to do now.  Work against Chris.
    
    Let's come to an agreement that we will not open fronts against each other.
    I will need to build that fleet I told you about Christian, in order to keep
    Chris offguard, but it will ONLY be used against the German mainland and
    will disband as soon as is tactically feasible.  Christian, you will try to
    take the French centres from Germany and put him out in preparation for an
    attack on Austrian holding without moving into the Med or against Russia's
    north.  Meef, you will move through the Med only as far as is need to
    infiltrate Austria's lines and take what centres or provinces as will weaken
    Austria.
    
    Once Austria is down, we either end the game there or continue on to
    whatever result this game holds.
    
    How does this sound to everyone?
    
    Cal
    
    (Meef, the following is a message mistakenly sent to me by England, but
    intended for Austria)
    
    &gt;Chris,
    &gt;
    &gt;I cannot see why you have to convince Russia to build a northern fleet. If
    &gt;you are going to attack him a SOUTHERN fleet would be better, wouldn't it?
    &gt;Maybe that is not possible though. My guess is that Cal is building StP
    &gt;anyway. OK, so you promise to give me any German centers I need to stop the
    &gt;Russian bear in the north. Good enough, but aren't you afraid I will walk
    &gt;south into the Med? Or do you still threaten to give the victory away to
    &gt;Turkey (of all!!) if I sail south?
    &gt;
    &gt;Comments?
    &gt;
    &gt;all the best
    &gt;Christian

    What you are saying Cal seems wise. I have so far never even pondered
    letting Chris off the hook, and I will never do so in the future. So far me
    and Chris hasn't told each other the truth for the whole game...Yes Cal,
    build your fleet. As I said before to you, we need to be careful when
    taking Austria our or you two will be anxious about me getting a solo. As I
    told you Cal, that is also why I didn't move into Med last turn. Anyway, I
    hope me talking to the enemy doesn't mean our little threeway alliance
    can't continue to work?

    Chris: you, along with a note from Christian this morning, put me in an
    untenable situation (so what else is new?)
    
    He has stated that, if I build a fleet in St Pete's north coast, he will
    send all his naval power north to pop that fleet.  You now tell me I can't
    build in the south coast.  Sigh.  Maybe I should just build an army instead?
    
    Seriously though, I think that, given the threat from England, I should
    build whatever fleet I can.  I can use a south coast fleet to bluff him that
    I am attacking you.  He has said he will accept that.  I can always follow
    it up next year with a fleet on the north coast when I'm ready for an
    all-out attack.

    Hey, in this kind of game, everyone writes to everyone.  It's expected...
    d;-})
    
    &gt; Anyway, t seems like my mistake proved good for us in some strange way.

    No, of course not.  While it certainly makes me wary (what doesn't in this
    game?), I think it simply served to illustrate what Chris is trying to do.
    Now that we're all wise to his "I'll promise you the world if you just
    attack somebody else!" routine, we can use it to our advantage.  Let's just
    all work towards the goal of taking Austria out as a factor in the game and
    we can then play the game to its natural conclusion ourselves.
    
    Your point about Turkey and I hving concerns about your ability to solo is
    valid, but if we make sure the division of centres is fair and keep in mind
    the long term strategic position, we should be fine.  Let's all make sure we
    voice any concerns we might have about one another's position, okay?

    I cannot see why you couldn't just comply with Chris demand and build a
    fleet StP south coast. You can always claim a north coast would be too
    obvious. And, a fleet SOUTH could be used against Chris Germany.
    
    all the best
    Christian&gt;&gt;
    
    :)
    
    Oh, those judge newbies!
    
    Anyway, he can hardly pull all his fleets north, can he, with Turkey and I
    steaming towards Gibralter?  in point of fact, he only has two fleets in the
    area, nowhere near the number needed to "Pop" you -- AND you will be
    building again next year -- and we did specifically discuss F StP (nc).
    
    The fact is that a fleet on the SC can really only be used against me, or
    Paul, and not Christian.  His six fleets are strung out from Marsailles to
    Skag, and he cant handle 3 fronts.  NC forces him to defend NWG and Norway,
    and he doesn't have the power to do that, AND hold Gibraltar.
    
    I am waiving that build!

    &gt; &gt; Cal, what did we decide my disband should be?

    &gt; Damn, I'm in the middle of setting up a new computer and don't have the
    &gt; board handy.  I think it was F Smy, no?

    &gt; Cal,
    &gt;
    &gt; Not sure what use f bla is gonna do for us.  We can cover bul w/ support
    &gt; from aeg and rum.  Smy is closer to the objective.  Am I missing something
    &gt; here?
    
    Just me not having a board set up.  I was thinking about Rumania in case
    Chris gets pissed off at my South Coast build.  Do what you think is best as
    I have to leave for work now.  &lt;g&gt;

    &gt; Message from tremewanc@worldnet.att.net as Austria to Russia in
    'ruffians':
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Cal,
    &gt;
    &gt; do you mean this email?
    
    Laff!  Yup, that's the latest, although it is one of a series.
    
    &gt; Oh, those judge newbies!
    
    &gt; Anyway, he can hardly pull all his fleets north, can he, with Turkey and I
    &gt; steaming towards Gibralter?  in point of fact, he only has two fleets in
    the
    &gt; area, nowhere near the number needed to "Pop" you -- AND you will be
    &gt; building again next year -- and we did specifically discuss F StP (nc).
    &gt;
    &gt; The fact is that a fleet on the SC can really only be used against me, or
    &gt; Paul, and not Christian.  His six fleets are strung out from Marsailles to
    &gt; Skag, and he cant handle 3 fronts.  NC forces him to defend NWG and
    Norway,
    &gt; and he doesn't have the power to do that, AND hold Gibraltar.
    &gt;
    &gt; I am waiving that build!
    
    Well, you missed the earlier, more frantic ones that implied he wouldn't
    care if you guys came around the Med if he had to punish me (really,
    throwing this game seems to be becoming a recurring theme in parts... ;-)  )
    
    I'll have to think about it.  If I do build on the SC, try not to worry.  I
    am VERY aware of that sea of red just to the west of Warsaw...
    
    Cal
    (heading off to work now so don't freak if I don't answer right away... &lt;g&gt;)

    Christian,
    
    The contractors accidentally pulled the plug on my CPU earlier -- did you
    get a message from me?
    
    I know you are concerned with my potential for growth.  I am concerned with
    yours as well!  Lets talk about a way we can work together, rather than
    fight each other, ok?
    
    My first suggestion is that you pull back to the three-fleet line holding
    the MAO against all southerners, and concentrate on mopping up Scandinavia.
    I am not opposed to swapping out coastal German Centers for inland French
    ones -- Paris and Marsailles for Berlin/Keil?
    
    Something to think about, anyway.
    
    Best,
    
    Chris
