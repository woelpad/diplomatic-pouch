    &gt; &gt; Message from tremewanc@worldnet.att.net as Austria to Germany in 'ruffians':
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Paul,
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Whew!
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; I was worried you'd get a little nervous, but I can see that you viewed
    &gt; &gt; russia the same way I did -- helpful, but a pain in the back given a little
    &gt; &gt; growth.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Ok, let's see -- Christian retreated to Portugal, did you note that?
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; Yes--not a minute after I predicted that he'd retreat to Mao.
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;.  In fact, I can afford to convoy my A
    &gt; &gt; Den-
    &gt; &gt; Lvn next Spring to help you out on the Russian front!&gt;&gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; That sounds great.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I want to build a F Kie, and move it to Den to give me a third fleet on
    &gt; &gt; the
    &gt; &gt; Nth.&gt;&gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Sounds good to me.  Christian is going to have a bitch kitty of a time
    &gt; &gt; holding what hes got now.
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;Perhaps A Pic-Par, A Bel-Pic, F Hol-Bel supported by Ruhr, and A Mar-Gas
    &gt; &gt; supported by Spain....  This would leave A Spain vulnerable, but it would
    &gt; &gt; certainly
    &gt; &gt; ensure that I would regain/keep Brest!&gt;&gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Maybe Bur S A Mar -&gt; Gas as well as F Naf -&gt; MAO?  it could annhialate that
    &gt; &gt; Gasconish fleet.  Wouldn't that be lovely!
    &gt;
    &gt; Yeah, unless he moves it to Bre but that's why I'm manouvering 3 units next to
    &gt; Bre--
    &gt; so that I can retake it in the Fall.
    &gt;      Can you get France's F Wms to support your F Nth-Mao?
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Spain could get whacked this way if Christian orders Gascony -&gt; Spain
    &gt; &gt; supported by Portugal, but that seems a bad move on General Principal.
    &gt;
    &gt; If A Spain gets annihilated by a "bad" English move, that's okay.  I didn't
    &gt; really
    &gt; expect to get it last turn in the first place!  F Gas-Mao is his only logical
    &gt; move--
    &gt; supported by F Por.  That way, he ensures that he keeps Por through the Fall.
    &gt;       No word yet from Cal....
    &gt;
    &gt; --Paul
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;I think that I am more valuable to you as an
    &gt; &gt; ally
    &gt; &gt; vs. England than I am as a "feeding ground" for your armies.  Let Russia
    &gt; &gt; serve
    &gt; &gt; in
    &gt; &gt; THAT capacity!&gt;&gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; i couldn't agree more!
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; My builds are in!
    &gt;
    &gt; Mine too-- surprise!  I built F Kie!

    Did I read that right?  Did Christian keep the army in Finland and disband
    the fleet Gulf of Lyon!?!?
    
    Someone explain that to me please?
    
    Does that change your thoughts on how to handle Gascony/Marsailles?
    
    I will write John and ask for his support, but who knows?

    John,
    
    Well, Christian was as good as his word, and buh-bye fleet GoL.  Thanks!  He
    wouldn'tve done it if I'da asked!  ;)
    
    So, what now?  I think my fleet in the Tyhr could be used back Turkey way,
    or not.  What is your real assesment of Pauls ability to solo?

    Dear Czar Cal,
    Our Austrian has made a living in this game lying and stabbing.
    
    Italy was victim 1
    I think france was victim 2 season before last
    Russia was victim 3 last season
    He has attacked Germany already this game.
    
    I will be victim 4 (just a matter of time)
    
    SO how can we maximize the damage against Aus?  If we handle this correctly,
    we can turn his empire to rubble.
    
    I enjoy long term relationships with Russia when I play Turkey.
    
    I am willing to be a loyal ally with u long term.  U being an army power and
    I being a fleet power, thus maximizing our comfort level.
    
    Thoughts on how to proceed?

    &gt; or not.  What is your real assesment of Pauls ability to solo?
    
    he is a MUCH greater threat than anything England could do (just look at
    England's position...would anyone capable of solo-ing ever had let that
    position deteriorate? I would help England in any way possible while you
    position yourself to attack Germany...for right now, IF you attack Geramny
    and a tthe same time you and me help England into SPA etc., then in
    England's mind you two will be allies and thus he won't see it as a solo,
    until you get to about 16. of course if you take the RIGHT 16 then by then
    it won't make a difference. That means MUN/BER now, before turkey and Russia
    are gone so that you have those key points long before your SC gets much
    higher. Also, I would stay 1 SC short of whatever count Germany has until
    you stab him, perhaps even play a unit short just to trick the casual
    looker-at-maps, which England is.
    
    
    &gt;

    restaurant that has swing music on friday/saturday nights and it was fun

    I'd also point out that if we can get you into Mar (well maybe I will get
    there momentarily but you eventually, then there is an actual play for you
    to be in Spain. Although you may not be able to hold it long if they were
    working against you, it means that you need Austria+Italy+Balkans = 10 + WAR
    + Turkey + SEV = 15. Now add in Tunis + Mar + Spa, while pressuring MUN/BER
    and you get to 18+ easily. (i harbour no expectations that I will survive,
    however it amuses me to help out because of who is playing Germany...of
    course if you find a 19th, then I expect you to let me survive as a matter
    of 'honor amoung thieves')
    
    
    I am moving to GOL this spring, so maybe we can do something against Germany
    in Marseilles in the fall. At the least I'd move A PIE-MAR just to make sure
    that England gets Spain and that the army there gets destroyed. You can thus
    cost Germany 2 SC this year with the use of but one unit (A PIE) leaving A
    BUR free to make trouble in Paris and Munich as a diversion.

    England,
    I am sure that Austria would be willing to move to MAR to cut its support
    thuis giving you a free attack on Spain, which will DESTROY the German army
    there. That means that I would be able to take Marseilles in the fall, a net
    loss to Germany of -2. To guarantee taking Spain you will have to move F
    GAS - SPA (nc), otherwise Germany can stymie your attack easily by doing A
    MAR-GAS. Once you do that you can re-arrange the units in the fall and take
    BRE the next year. For now I think you should protect North Sea as long as
    possible until you can build that new unit you get from getting Spain back,
    which means F ENG-NTH with Norway's support and supporting SWE to hold.
    Status quo actually helps you in the North since Germany will likely lose
    2-3 units this year, depending on Russia's moves

    &gt; Dear Czar Cal,

    Boy, you picked up on that quick! d;-})
    
    &gt; Italy was victim 1
    &gt; I think france was victim 2 season before last
    &gt; Russia was victim 3 last season
    &gt; He has attacked Germany already this game.
    &gt;
    &gt; I will be victim 4 (just a matter of time)
    
    Quite honestly, this is so evident, it makes me wonder why he stabbed me.
    If him and I had eliminated you, we could have turned to face the west and
    probably handled them easily.  This way, once *I* am gone, he has you behind
    him with fleets.  My mind just boggles at what he was thinking.  Oh well,
    mine is not to reason why, mine is but to make the S.O.B. pay for it!  &lt;G&gt;
    
    &gt; SO how can we maximize the damage against Aus?  If we handle this
    correctly,
    &gt; we can turn his empire to rubble.
    
    I think we can benefit immediately, although you should play along as if
    you're his willing little toady.  Any info we can get on his tactics will go
    a long way.
    
    I need my armies in Stp, Lvn & Ukr to make sure I get War back in the Fall,
    so if you can support me in Rumania in the Spring, I will support you into
    Bulgaria in the Fall.  We have to start beating him back as soon as possible
    to stop the momentum.
    
    &gt; I enjoy long term relationships with Russia when I play Turkey.
    
    Someone who believes in ANY kind of alliance play will be a novelty in the
    game.  I freely admit that I'm a believer in "enlightened self-interest",
    but I also remember reading the part about having to ally with someone at
    some point to prosper.  If we start to do real good and roll across the
    board, I'll stab you if you give me an opening, but I won't do it when it's
    not in my best interests and I certainly don't switch allies just for a
    change which I feel Chris just did.
    
    &gt; I am willing to be a loyal ally with u long term.  U being an army power
    and
    &gt; I being a fleet power, thus maximizing our comfort level.
    
    That sounds like a sensible plan given the rest of the board's tendency to
    chaos.
    
    &gt; Thoughts on how to proceed?
    
    As above.  Let's cut his momentum and then cave him in at the corners.

    Cal

    &gt;       I will never refuse to even listen to someone, but your credibility suffers by
    &gt; your choice of removals.  Why did you pull your F Gol, leaving the entire Med open to Austria?  Wouldn't A Fin have been a better removal, in view
    of
    &gt; your loss
    &gt; of StP?
    &gt;      I assume that your Fall move of F Mao-Gas was meant simply to cut my support
    &gt; for Bre, or to block an attack on Spain?  How could Bre or Spa have been worth
    &gt; the loss of Mao?  That goes double for next gameyear!

    &gt;      It is beyond my understanding.  A Fin can help support Swe, sure, while F
    &gt; Nwy
    &gt; is used to help in covering Nth.  But was it worth abandoning the Med?  Is he
    &gt; going

    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Does that change your thoughts on how to handle Gascony/Marsailles?
    &gt;
    &gt; Not really.  I figure that he still has to make a supported move back to Mao, so
    &gt; I
    &gt; honestly do not expect to lose Spa.  Will he try F Eng-Bre?  Again, I doubt it
    &gt; as he
    &gt; needs two fleets just to hold Nth.  Let's go for Gascony, Par and Pic; I can
    &gt; always
    &gt; take Bre back in the Fall!
    &gt;      If you take Mar and Mao, you can support me to Por in the Fall while your
    &gt; A Mar takes Spain; it will simply make the final conquest of Iberia that much
    &gt; easier.  If you don't take Mao, your A Mar might support my A Spa in holding;
    &gt; perhaps you can support me to Mos in compensation?
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; I will write John and ask for his support, but who knows?

    &gt;
    &gt; thoughts?
    
    
    I agree that getting you a build is priority one.  The thing that worries me
    is losing Rumania to a combined Ser/Bud attack.  Hmmm, well, the most likely
    moves for him are:
    
    A Bud-Rum,
    S by A Bul
    F Gre s A Bul
    A Tri-Ser
    
    With your plan, we get a standoff, but I don't lose Rum.  Of course, that
    means Serbia has a chance to move into position.  Your plan probably gives a
    shot at really cutting his momentum if not putting him back on the
    defensive.
    
    Okay, I'm willing to do it your way.
    
    There is, however, something riskier that guarantees results.  How about
    this:
    
    Russia:
    A Rum-Bul
    
    Turkey
    F Bla & F Con s A Rum-Bul
    
    This guarantees that we take Bulgaria and in the Fall we put everything we
    have into getting your army into Rumania.  This is obviously riskier and
    puts our alliance to the test right away.  It does give good results.
    
    I know that's a tough thing to ask on our first move together, but it's the
    last thing he'll be expecting.  If you prefer to be cautious, we'll do it
    your way, but would you at least consider the more radical plan?  If you
    don't, then no hard feelings and we play on against Austria.
    
    What do you think?

    I entirely agree that it would be a lot better for me and for defense
    against ANYONE's solo that you and I bottle up the MAO. However, with 4
    German fleets in play I think it is vitally important that we cause him some
    disbands (and you some builds) THIS turn. This way we maximize the
    effectiveness of our combined 3 units and just as important we don't risk
    Germany making a lucky guess in defending Spain. We can always re-arrange
    the Iberian situation later since Austria is not in a naval position. IF we
    don't do something about Germany this year then he can force himself into
    North Sea next year and then we've got real problems. My thinking is that we
    get Germany under control, and then if Austria gets *too* big we back off
    Germany. This means the key points will remain STP, MUN, MAR, SPA, and TUN,
    3 of which you and I are in a position to gravely effect.
    
    If you think the position would be better with me in Spain (SOUTH COAST)
    rather than you in spain (NORTH COAST) then you do have a good point, and we
    can handle it that way. It will also mean that one of your fleets (F GAS) is
    free to bother Brest in the fall. Just let me know somewhat fast so I can
    submit different orders.

    Meef,
    
    Next we really kick Russia hard.  This year coming should net you 2 builds,
    Bulgaria and Sevastopol.
    
    The moves are these:
    
    Me:
    
    A Warsaw -&gt; Ukraine  (1)
    A Vienna -&gt; Galicia  (2)
    A Budapest S A Bul -&gt; Rumania
    A Bulgaria -&gt; Rumania (3)
    A Trieste -&gt; Serbia (2)
    
    You:
    
    F Con -&gt; Bul (ec)  (4)
    F Black S A Armenia -&gt; Sev
    A Armenia -&gt; Sev (3)
    
    (1)  Cuts support for Both Sev and Rum.
    (2) eliminates retreat options, ensuring the annhialation of A Rum
    (3) Guaranteed to succeed!
    (4) allows me to move F Greece -&gt; Ionian without fear.
    
    I am still in good position to wheel about and nail Germany, and you are
    back to 5 centers!
    
    I have played with several scenarios in the last 10 minutes or so, and this
    looks to be the best combo.  did I miss anything?  Let me know.

    Paul,
    
    I could not leave NTH open for you to take. I need to be able to keep Swe
    and NTH to work with you, otherwise you would just continue to attack me
    while I was disbanding more and more defence. I will disband anti-German
    if Germany attacks me.
    
    If you have some interesting plan to suggest I would very much like to
    work with you, but as I see it it is you who must want to work with me, I
    will move defensively until I see you turning. Show me your good will and
    we can work good together in a couple of turns.'

    &gt; &gt; Does that change your thoughts on how to handle Gascony/Marsailles?
    &gt;
    &gt; Not really.  I figure that he still has to make a supported move back to
    Mao, so
    &gt; I
    &gt; honestly do not expect to lose Spa.  Will he try F Eng-Bre?  Again, I
    doubt it
    &gt; as he
    &gt; needs two fleets just to hold Nth.  Let's go for Gascony, Par and Pic; I

    It's definitely time Germany took a hit.  Thanks for Disbanding in Gulf of
    Lyon, that was a big help to me.
    
    I will hit Marsailles, cutting support for Spain.  Do you think Paul would
    move Marsailles -&gt; Gascony, to cut support or to get closer to Brest?  I
    think he might go Mar -&gt; Gas and Spain -&gt; Mar, as well as some cut of
    support on Burgundy just to keep me honest.
    
    A DMZ in the Med/Atlantic area sounds great to me I stay out of Naf/Westmed,
    you stay out of Spain (SC) and the MAO, that sort of thing  -- let me know
    how you want to play it.  We are better off fighting Germany than each
    other.

    I was a bit puzzled by the vehemence of John's reaction to my stab:  perhaps my
    goading him in the broadcast press didn't improve his attitude any, but he
    definitely
    overreacted.  I was given no choice but to follow through with the attack.
    Evidently John and I have been in one other game before, but that encounter has
    faded from even the most distant recesses of my mind.  (I've been in too many
    games?)
     As things stand, I won't interfere with the negociations between A/F.  He
    doesn't

    plan."  Yeah, right....   He threatens to keep "making anti-German removals",

    thus far I haven't even seen much sign of THAT:  how did his yanking F Gol hurt

     He says that keeping me out of Nth is his top priority, but he doesn't have

    I think that plants a big fat target on Austria's head as a threat to solo.
    I think you should greatfully accept the offer of MAR and then support me
    into it in the fall. A fleet in MAR will look very safe to both G and E and
    look like it is bottling you up...when the time is right you will have built
    up the fleet(s) you need to enter MAO. The best way right now to drive
    England back into Germany's arms is for there to be a Austrian fleet in MAO,
    esp since you don't have the other 3 fleets to back up such a foray. I would
    concentrate on taking the border centers needed for a win, and then swooping
    back to collect the rear line centers (in Turkey and south russia) etc.

    Hhhhhhhhhhh.  You are probably right.  Its like when Germany said "since
    you're moving out of Munich, why don't you move to the Ruhr and help me
    against England?"  Getting that first unit across the stalemate line is the
    hardest one.  The thing about a fleet in the atlantic, even a solo fleet, is
    that they just don't have the force to pin it down.  But you are of course
    right.  I hate to leave such a nice posting though.  You're moving to GoL,
    I'll move Naf -&gt; Westmed, and send that Tyrh fleet back to Ionian to set up
    those Turkish centers.

    &gt; Are you promising Christian you'll support him to Spain in the Spring?  I
    &gt; think he thinks you are.
    
    
    I didn't have that sense at all. I did suggest that you would move A PIE-MAR
    to cut its support thereby telling England that if he moves F GAS-SPA (NORTH
    COAST!) that the move would then succeed no matter what. Now, this does
    tthree things:
    
    1) leaves me free to move to GOL which is more useful for you and me
    2) prevents England from making any moves into the Med since then he is in
    north coast
    3) guarantees the desctruction of Germany army in Spain, which means Germany
    loses SPA *and* MAR this year. Under all circumstances, that is good news
    for you no matter who gets what
    
    England had originally suggest to support me into Spain, which is silly
    since then he kicks me out in the fall and stops me from helping you take
    Marseilles. With him in Spain in north coast, you can help me into MAR, make
    yourself not look like a threat and buy the several season you need to get
    those Turkish centers and get the resulting builds to the front. I think by
    the time E or G really sees how many SC you can pick up quickly it will be
    too late.
    
    p.s. did you realize that you can take Munich this year very easily? His
    only defense means leaving PAR *and* BEL open which seems silly since you
    haven't "threatened" Germany yet with armies int he border regions. If you
    move to BOH or TYR and move retain A BUR then he *must* move A RUH-MUN and A
    BEL-RUH to protect MUN. (in fact, you might consider moving A BUR-RUH which
    effectively isolates his army  and locks Munich for the fall (who cares if
    he sees it coming at that point.) COmbined with loss of Spain, Marseilles
    this means -3 for Germany. Suddenly you don't even NEED Moscow or Sevastapol
    to get to 18!

    Arm.  Make sense?

    Cal,
    
    Ok, you've had a night to think on it.  I am prepared to start the German
    Campaign, return Warsaw to you, and finish Turkey off.  My security vs. you
    is ensured, and I have no further ambitions in Russia.  Keep Rum, build a
    fleet in StPete, and we can take up where we left off.
    
    Hmm?

    &gt;
    &gt;Cal, below is a copy of Austria's latest message.
    &gt;
    &gt;"Meef,
    &gt;Next we really kick Russia hard.  This year coming should net you 2 builds,
    &gt;Bulgaria and Sevastopol.
    &gt;The moves are these:
    &gt;Me:
    &gt;A Warsaw -&gt; Ukraine  (1)
    &gt;A Vienna -&gt; Galicia  (2)
    &gt;A Budapest S A Bul -&gt; Rumania
    &gt;A Bulgaria -&gt; Rumania (3)
    &gt;A Trieste -&gt; Serbia (2)
    &gt;You:
    &gt;F Con -&gt; Bul (ec)  (4)
    &gt;F Black S A Armenia -&gt; Sev
    &gt;A Armenia -&gt; Sev (3)
    &gt;(1)  Cuts support for Both Sev and Rum.
    &gt;(2) eliminates retreat options, ensuring the annhialation of A Rum
    &gt;(3) Guaranteed to succeed!
    &gt;(4) allows me to move F Greece -&gt; Ionian without fear.
    &gt;I am still in good position to wheel about and nail Germany, and you are
    &gt;back to 5 centers!
    &gt;I have played with several scenarios in the last 10 minutes or so, and this
    &gt;looks to be the best combo.  did I miss anything?  Let me know.
    &gt;Chris"
    &gt;
    &gt;  I am thinking:
    &gt;a rum h
    &gt;a sev s rum
    &gt;(bounces his attack on rum)
    &gt;a ukr - gal
    &gt;(bounces  a vie - gal and a war - ukr)
    &gt;a stp - mos
    &gt;
    &gt;a arm - bla - bul
    &gt;f bla c arm - bul
    &gt;f con s arm - bul
    &gt;(a bul will retreat to gre)
    &gt;
    &gt;in the fall u can retake war
    &gt;i will try and get out into aeg
    &gt;
    &gt;in the winter i will build another fleet in smy and force my way out toward
    &gt;gre, etc
    &gt;u can build another army and ....  the pressure builds
    &gt;
    &gt;thoughts?

    Cal,
    
    Nice to see you have your sense of humor about you on RGD!  :)
    
    Ok, here's the skinny:
    
    I have told turkey the following, and haven't heard from him since, but I
    think maybe he only accesses at work?
    
    Me:
    
    A War -&gt; Ukr
    A Vie -&gt; Gal
    A Bud s A Bul -&gt; Rum
    A Bul -&gt; Rum
    A Tri -&gt; Ser
    
    Him:
    
    A Arm -&gt; Sev
    F Black S A Arm -&gt; Sev
    F Con -&gt; Bul
    
    Ok, no big surprises there, tis the optimum set of moves given the position,
    right?  So, question for you -- can you see a set of moves, which preserves
    Turkeys moves, AND gives you and I the opportunity to take back BOTH Sev and
    Bulgaria in the fall, as well as take one of Turkey's home SC;s,  with F
    Greece -&gt; Aeg -&gt; Smy.  I am trying to work it out, and I'm SURE we can do
    it, but only if we co-ordinate.
    
    I have to say again, that I stabbed you because I felt that your position in
    the Balkans was really approaching an overwhelming nature.  Iprobably should
    have simply expressed that concern, but I didn't feel I could ask you to
    simply Cede a center to me to make me happy, and with the mis-orders that
    happened when you went into the hospital, I wasn't sure how to handle
    things.
    
    Clearly, you are a better ally than Turkey.  Aside from being able to play a
    long term plan, You have expansion opps that don't include Me!  I wonder
    when/if Meef is going to bring that up . . .

    Cal,
    
    I was just thinking about this as your message came in.
    
    Do you agree that the important thing is that Turkey loses a home SC this
    year?  to do that we have to allow him some penetration into our turf.  I
    will modify my moves by NOT taking Rumania, instead I will swing that army
    to Greece.  His fleet move to Bul will go, leaving me free to convoy that
    army to Smyrna in the fall.
    
    You will have three units on Sev in the fall, and should be able to walk
    into Warsaw (from Livonia, I assume?) as I walk out.  I can tell Mikal I was
    worried about him swinging his fleets around, and I will take Rum now, in
    the fall.  Any luck, he won't see it coming.  Even if he does, that army in
    Smy is all she wrote for him.  I can support Rum to hold in the fall if you
    think it's needed as well, since he'll have 3 units there as well.
    
    It's funny how hard Turkey is to take down without that second fleet, isn't
    it?

    Uh, don't take this wrong, Paul, but it looks to me like you're bending over
    backward for Austria and he's reaching for the KY...
    
    If I may presume, here's an analysis of the game from your point of view:
    
    With Austria's help, you've managed to put England on the ropes.  That's
    good, but to do it, you've had to put yourself so far out of position that
    you're will soon become an easy target for Austria.  Don't forget, he's
    stabbed Italy once, Turkey twice, me once and you once.  I don't think he'll
    have any qualms about attacking you again.  Especially now that he has a
    fleet in the Mid and is across the stalemate line.
    
    The only thing that is keeping you safe is the fact that Turkey and I are
    offering him resistance.  As long as we do, he won't be able to pull units
    back from his eastern front.  If we go down and he CAN pull those units
    back, do you think he'll settle for a two-way draw?  Or that you and all
    your fleets will be able to stop his armies coming across the German plain?
    
    End of analysis.  Do you agree with me about your chances?  If you recover a
    bit of position to defend against Austrian treachery and let R/T keep him
    busy, there's a chance you can win?  Or help Chris take me out and guarantee
    you that you're the next victim...  Comments?
    
    What will it take to get that army out of Livonia?  (and NOT into St Pete,
    Warsaw or Moscow...)

    get France to entrust his final sc to u?  How did u get away with your Army

    Paul,
    Austria is attacking you! If you conquer NTH this turn I will disband in
    favour of Austria. I think you I need to work together if we are to stop
    Chris from getting 18. He is well past the stalemate in the Med and soon
    has reached StP unless you or me support you or Russia to hold it. I will
    not support against Austria until I see tha you abort your attack on me.
    This season will probably give you one (or two?) disbands. Seeze the
    opportunity to disband fleets!!! Austria will eat you up otherwise.
    Please? I REALLY wanna work with you. Give me a hint about what I need to
    do to get you to start working with me.

    the west, don't you think?  Who would have guessed (I didn't) that Christian
    would
    sacrifice Mao for a petty shot at Spain... a dot that he still might not keep
    for a full
    gameyear!
     To Austria's credit, he hasn't moved more armies into Try and Boh.  It
    doesn't
    look like he's going for anything that he can't simply get by default!
    
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; The only thing that is keeping you safe is the fact that Turkey and I are
    &gt; offering him resistance.
    
    Oh believe me-- I am grateful for little favors!
    
    &gt;  If you recover a
    &gt; bit of position to defend against Austrian treachery and let R/T keep him
    &gt; busy, there's a chance you can win?
    &gt;
    &gt; What will it take to get that army out of Livonia?  (and NOT into St Pete,
    &gt; Warsaw or Moscow...)
    
    How are you going to cover both Mos and StP, may I ask?  Are you leaving StP for
    
    England to recover?
    
     Why don't you abide by my A Lvn-Stp, knowing that it will be continuing
    into
    Nwy and allowing you to regain/retain StP?  It would at least give you some
    measure of security for Mos.
     I made the move to Lvn firstly to make room for putting a fleet in Den (to
    ensure
    my finally regaining Nth); secondly to give myself a chance to regain the dot
    I'm
    losing in Mar.  That's why I'm openly discussing StP here:  it would give me the
    
    compensatory dot for the French one, but just until I could advance it further
    into
    Scandinavia.  I WILL pick up Nth Sea this turn, and England will find its home
    dots
    wide open to my predations.  He may well move F Nwy-Nwg, just to cover Edi,
    and make my move of A StP-Nwy that much easier.
    
     My estimate is that Austria will refrain from attacking me as long as I'm
    making
    progress vs. England, while he is increasingly busy with R/T.  Assuming that
    Chris
    will be supporting me back into France, Christian will find himself naked to his
    
    enemies.  He may precede R or T into the dumpster!  (Oops!  Sorry for the brutal
    
    honesty...!)

    &gt; Paul,
    &gt; Austria is attacking you!
    
    Marginally.  He could have walked into Mun, or moved an army to Tyrolia to
    make it more convincing, don't you think?
    
    &gt; If you conquer NTH this turn I will disband in
    &gt; favour of Austria.
    
    Almost any removal on your part will help me... Spain may be annihilated to
    make
    this question a nullity, anyway.
    
    &gt; I think you I need to work together if we are to stop
    &gt; Chris from getting 18.
    
    &gt; Give me a hint about what I need to do to get you to start working with me.
    
    Well, a little support for A Lvn-StP wouldn't hurt.  I need to compensate for
    the
    loss of Mar.   If you pledge to do this, I could make to similar promise to
    stay out
    of Nth.
     I'm curious.  Why do you display such vehemence in defending Nth when
    you
    simply abandoned Mao?  Yeah, you annihilated my lone army over there; but can
    
    you even maintain Spain for the Fall season?

    You've got a huge target painted on your back and you're the one who painted

    &gt;
    &gt;Oh believe me-- I am grateful for little favors!
    
    And you seem to have this delusion that you can take me out and NOT have
    Chris attack you?  Man, what are you thinking?  You LIKE digging your own
    grave?
    
    &gt;How are you going to cover both Mos and StP, may I ask?  Are you leaving
    &gt;StP for
    
    &gt;England to recover?
    
    England essentially ceded it back to me.  I doubt if he will spare the force
    necessary to move there.  If he wasn't more worried about you than me, he
    wouldn't have given it back to me in the first place.
    
    &gt;      Why don't you abide by my A Lvn-Stp, knowing that it will be
    &gt;continuing
    &gt;into
    &gt;Nwy and allowing you to regain/retain StP?  It would at least give you some
    &gt;measure of security for Mos.
    
    Look Paul, go set the board up and do some math.  I'm referring to counting
    as in 1-2-3-4.  How many centres do you think I HAVE to be ceding you
    anything even for a year?
    
    &gt;      I made the move to Lvn firstly to make room for putting a fleet in
    &gt;Den (to
    &gt;ensure
    &gt;my finally regaining Nth); secondly to give myself a chance to regain the
    &gt;dot
    &gt;I'm
    &gt;losing in Mar.
    
    Um, have you noticed who's sitting in that centre?  Your buddy and master,
    Austria.
    
    That's why I'm openly discussing StP here:  it would give me the
    &gt;
    &gt;compensatory dot for the French one, but just until I could advance it
    &gt;further

    &gt;and make my move of A StP-Nwy that much easier.
    
    
    And you take a centre off me and bring your stab by Austria that much
    closer.
    
    &gt;      My estimate is that Austria will refrain from attacking me as long as
    &gt;I'm
    &gt;making
    &gt;progress vs. England, while he is increasingly busy with R/T.  Assuming

    &gt;honesty...!)
    
    Brutal honesty, I don't mind.  It's your brutal delusions that bother me.
    You really believe that Chris won't stab you as long as you're making
    progress against England?  That is utter trash.  That's EXACTLY the best
    time FOR him to hit you.  I was "making progress" against Turkey and he hit
    me.  And he needs Turkey to be taken out FAR more than he needs England
    gone...
    
    Sigh.  Doesn't ANYONE in this game think more than a year ahead?

    Hi Chris!
     So England really did swap Mao for Spain:  he's trying to convince
    me that he
    will throw the game to you if I don't pull back on my own attacks on
    him.
     We can take advantage of your being in Mao:  how about your going
    with
    A Mar-Spa supported by F Wes; F Mao-Por cutting the support there.
    Instead of
    my sending A Gas-Mar and leaving English A Spa a place to retreat, why
    don't we
    bounce A Gas and A Bur over Mar?  This should be enough to achieve the
    annihilation of the English F Spain, and I can keep the dot in Mar for
    myself.
     How do I compensate for the loss of Spain?  Well, StP is wide open,
    isn't it?
    English A Fin should be busy supporting Swe, while F Nwy should be
    engaged in
    trying to keep Nth out of my hands.  Russia's only means of covering Stp
    is to order
    Mos there, covering Mos with Ukr-Mos supported by A Sev.  Obviously,
    this
    would mean his abandoning Rum to you so it is by no means a sure thing!
     My batting average in guessing the "other guys" moves has been
    lousy lately.
    What do you think of my guesses this time?

     I can't recover Mar unless Austria chooses to give it back (i.e.,

    You know, I would actually consider supporting you to Warsaw (keep it out of

    Look.  England says that he won't throw the game to Austria if I stop attacking

     You say "don't take Mos or StP" so I offer to take something else.  If I'm
    offering
    to attack an Austrian dot, is that commitment or what?  You can support me from
    Mos and still support Mos from Ukr.  Giving me someplace to go to besides StP
    was the original idea, right?  So let's give it a try, and see if that doesn't

     If I were to move A Lvn-War with Russian support, cover Munich with

    Mikal, Cal
    
    What reason will u give me for being in the aegean?  &gt;&gt;
    
    What reason will you give me for not being in Sev?  I stabbed a long-time
    ally in Russia, and I KNEW he'd be lobbying hard for you to join him against
    the big bad austrian.  I had to do something to cover the possibility that
    you would turn on me.  If you hadn't, that fleet could have gone to the
    Ionian -- as it is, I'm really glad I left myself a retreat from Bulgaria!
    
    Look, I understand your concerns regarding me.  Cal is a good player and can
    be quite persuasive.  You can see now that if you had moved as I had
    suggested, and you agreed, you would now be in Sev AND Bulgaria, Russia
    would have been dealt a crushing blow, and I could leave the mopping up to
    you while I went after Germany.
    
    Now we are back to the same old stalemate in the Balkans.  Will you defend
    Bul, or cover Smy?  From the tone of your letter Mikal you aren't prepared
    to listen to any suggestions I have as to how we could work together, and at
    this point I really don't care.  I have dealt with THREE backstabbing Turks,
    all of whom I tried to work with, and all of whom turned on me.  Fine.
    
    Cal, I was a bad boy and I'm sorry.  Can you forgive me?  You do understand
    that this afternoon I was trying to find a way to work with you, but if
    Mikal here had stuck to the plan it was too good an opportunity to pass up.
    The three of us can stalemate each other for a while, but as I said to you
    Germany is now the real threat.
    
    Happy holidays to you both -- Seriously.  I wish you both all of the joy of

    Well, I was looking it over this afternoon, and said to myself, DAMN the
    torpedoes, full speed ahead!    It Kinda worked, didn't it?
    
    Hhhhhhhhh.  Turks.  What is it about Turks that they curse my life so?
    
    Ok, I have a thought.  How about this;
    
    F GoL S A Burgundy -&gt; Marsailles
    
    A Mars -&gt; Spain
    F Mao -&gt; Por
    F Westmed S A Mars -&gt; Spain
    
    I am feeling a little out of position in Burgundy -- this takes Germany down
    two centers, and he allready had an annhialation.  These are actually the
    moves Germany has proposed to me, but if you give the "ahem" unwanted
    support into Marsaille, then his attempt to bounce Gas -&gt; Mars wont go.  I
    need another fleet dammit.  Turks!  Always with me its Turks!  ;)
