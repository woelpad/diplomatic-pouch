    I think that the game is quiet for exactly the reasons Christian pointed
    out.  There's little need for talking, at least for the moment.  I do see
    that changing as this group isn't likely to remain silent for long.
    
    I really don't see Chris throwing the game to Christian.  For a short while,
    it seemed like Germany was actually starting to matter a little bit in that
    regard.  I think Chris has him in his pocket again and he'll probably still
    pester England for a (short) while.  It will be after Germany is out that
    Chris's intentions will become known.

    No, I am not heading for Med. I am convoying with support to Gas. Spain and

    Wow, baby has been keeping me quite busy!  I also spent the weekend dipping
    down in Virginia, about 5 hours drive.  A Fun tourney, with high level of
    play.
    
    Anyway, sure, lets take him down.  I am going to take Munich.  Why don't you
    go and take StPete?

    No, I'm selling enlightened self-interest (and you're my best salesman!)...
    heh heh.
    
    BTW, I don't know if you get the Academy lists or not, but someone pointed
    out that you hadn't been invited to play.  I responded that you certainly
    should be (sort of seconding a nomination), so I think you'll be asked
    shortly. We'll have to make sure we get into a game as soon as this one
    ends.

    Cal,
    
    I did get your nod, and thanks for it!  I'd very much like to play in a game
    again.
    
    If you can explain to me how keeping you alive HELPS turkey at this point
    (when I am GIVING him the Med) I would really like to hear.  Seriously.  I
    can only hope he is coming to get Sev, as I promised him he could have it if
    he wanted it.
    
    Prussia in the Spring, Warsaw in the fall, here I come!

    Hi Meef!
    
    How does this look for the Fall?
    
    Turkey
    A Bul-Ser
    F Aeg-Bul(sc)
    F Gre s F Aeg-Bul(sc)
    F Bla s A Sev-Rum
    
    Russia
    A Sev-Rum
    A Ukr-Gal
    
    That should knock Chris down a unit or so and we get you Serbia next year.
    
    Any suggestions?
