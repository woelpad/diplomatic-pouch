    Cal,
    
    RUM -&gt; SEV!?!?!
    
    What happened?  I thought you were a) supporting me from Serbia -&gt; Bulgaria,
    and b) moving Ukraine into Sev. and c) moving to Silesia.
    
    Ok Germany didn't break the DMZ, but it was a bad move on his part, and he
    SHOULD have moved there!  Why does he still have 4 armies in France I
    wonder?
    
    I hate it when a plan doesn't come together -- please let me know what's up!
    
    Best,

    Your holiness,
    
    Sorry about not supporting you in -- I didn't reckon with the fact that
    you'd have a supported attack on rome that I couldn't stop.
    
    Yes, I will support you to hold in Marsailles, and I will do my best to
    bouce Turkey out of Bulgaria again -- as I say, I need you alive alot more
    than I need your centers!
    
    As long as I am able, I will keep you in Marsaille, and Tunis, at least,
    will remain yours -- perhaps you would move the fleet to North Africa, where
    it can help against England?  or maybe the army.  I can't expect you to help
    me, but if england takes down France, I can't keep you in Marsaille!

    Paul,
    
    looking at the situation makes me wonder if I dare to move out of Denmark
    this fall. Do you dare to leave Kiel vacated? Holland?
    
    Since this is a fall season, I feel it is best if you bounce yourself (or
    whatever you want to do) in Holland and I´ll hold in Denmark. Also this
    makes it possible for me to move Nwy-Finland and build a new army in Edi to
    be convoyed to Nwy with support next turn. Maybe we shouldn't try for the
    supported attack on Spain but rather hope Austria will use Piedemont to
    cover Venice and I´ll go for Portugal. Chances are France guesses that we
    could attack with support and is holding in Spain supported by WES.
    
    I feel this is the best way to do it. Please let me know if you have any
    other thoughts.

    I don't even remember anymore, but I'll get back to you.  I've just gotten
    home from a five day stay in the hospital for major surgery and everything
    has pretty much gone to hell in my absence.  Regardless, I'll look at the
    game by tomorrow and get back to you.  If I've fucked up, I'll figure out
    how and make amends.  There was no element of "stab" in whatever I ordered,
    maybe just some confusion before going to the hospital.

    for you.
    
    Well, I certainly seem safe this turn so I'm open to suggestions.  It looks

    say if he told me the army in Norway was going to be convoyed out this turn.
    I told him he invested three units to get it there, so I'd be unlikely to

    Austria is demanding I move on Silesia or he'll move on me with Turkey.  I
    think it's just a bit of desperate blackmail on his part, but it would only
    take a unit or two to hurt me.

    &gt; &gt; Message from diplomat@idirect.com as Russia to Germany in 'ruffians':
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; Actually, with your silence and all I was expecting your move to Sil and
    have
    &gt; already written A Ber-Sil to counter it.  Okay, I can live with the bounce
    &gt; there:
    
    The silence was mostly morphine induced although I'm trying to  get my head
    back into this game after all the problems.  I just don't have a lot of
    energy now.
    
    &gt;      I've been worried about what you might have in mind post-Turkey:  are
    you
    &gt; going to stick with your alliance with Austria vs. the Sultan, maintain
    our G/R
    &gt; neutrality and concern yourself with what comes next "later"?
    
    Quite frankly, I don't know what I'm going to do and that's as honest as I
    can be.  Right now I seem to have nobody attacking me, but future expansion
    prospects look dim.  I figure my best move is to wait and see which way
    things break. I don't trust Austria, but then again, he didn't convoy an
    army into Norway this turn.  Not much point in attacking Austria when
    England may be coming over the top, is there?  Conversely, how can I try to
    expand northward when Turkey is still strong enough to take me out?
    
    Best to see how things turn out and defend when attacked.   I suspect you'd
    do the same in my position.
    
    Too tired to write more,
    
    Cal
    
    
    &gt;      Are you and England planning a bounce over StP?

    Well done, and no hard feelings here!  I will be retreating to the Ionian,
    the better to finish Cryille off.  You will continue to recieve my support
    to hold in Marsaille, for what it is worth.  I think it will be safe for a
    while, as Burgundy will need to Support Munich to hold for a while -- would
    you be willing to cut that support, now that you have a home center to
    re-build in?  I mean, you can take rome now, and if it gets popped, no prob,
    you stay at 3 and re-build, if it doesn't, I'd like you to move back out (of
    course) but would understand if you didn't.
    
    I know its tough to work with someone who stabbed you brutaly for your home
    centers, but I am really trying to stop the G/E alliance, and I have seen
    you as a key part of that for years now -- its why I didn't support naples
    to hold -- if you got Cyrille to support you in, then fine, was my theory --
    as long as HE didnt hold it!

    &gt;      Why leave it to guesswork every turn?  Send a fleet to Naf and

    &gt; truly

    &gt;      That Italian army in Mar is a pain in the ass, isn't it?  I cannot

    &gt; I know its tough to work with someone who stabbed you brutaly for your home
    &gt; centers, but I am really trying to stop the G/E alliance, and I have seen
    &gt; you as a key part of that for years now -- its why I didn't support naples
    &gt; to hold -- if you got Cyrille to support you in, then fine, was my theory --
    &gt; as long as HE didnt hold it!
    &gt;
    I can understand that. And if I am able to build a fleet this year, I can
    possibly become the one that helps you with G/E.
    &gt;
    &gt; but it's late and I'm rambling.  Let me know your thoughts, I still think of
    &gt; you as a key player on this board, or indeed on any board you haven't been
    &gt; eliminated from!
    &gt;
    Thank you! I will do my best.
    
    &gt; best,
    &gt;

    Paul,
    
    Yes I am moving down south with fleets in MAO and IRI. I am also moving NTH
    to NWY with support from Finland.

    I had to destroy Apulia. But now, as ion is still free, you could easily ask
    England to move in Tun in Spring, and then in Ionian. It's quite hot, but I
    think that he cannot have your fleet against him.
    Of course, he can always agree a draw with Austria, but what can we do?
    I didn't talk with England, so don't know what to do. If you have some
    suggestions, I will read it carefully.
    Best,
    Cyrille.

    Oh, I do not know... You and Russia should be able to hurt Austria some.
    I will try to retake Rome soon, I hope.
    I am not sure I want to cooperate with England... Bu tI shall see.
