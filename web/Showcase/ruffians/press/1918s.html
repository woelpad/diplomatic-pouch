    &gt;
    &gt; Anybody who thinks Christian was just "lucky", well this is
    &gt; ridiculous.   How many times has he been lucky in this game?
    &gt;
    &gt; 1) Cal builds F StP(sc) in 1901
    &gt; 2) The Sea Lion is derailed in 1902
    &gt; 3) France and Germany stay bitter enemies from that point until both
    &gt; are eliminated (and even in the grave, perhaps?)
    &gt; 4) Italy is enough of a nuisance that France has no chance to recover
    &gt; 5) Russia's presence in the North is reduced to insignificance
    &gt; 6) Austria comes North, completely undermining Germany
    &gt; 7) Turkey is boxed in in the midgame, unable to grow, but not
    &gt; eliminated
    &gt; 8) Italy _is_ eliminated, thereby creating a fleet vacuum England can
    &gt; filled
    &gt; 9) Austria (not England) is viewed by _everybody_ on the board as the
    &gt; big threat to win the game
    &gt; 10) R/T fight Austria when Austria could easily hold England back
    &gt; 11) Austria threatens to throw the game to England and happily throws
    &gt; centers his way
    &gt; 12) Munich and Berlin are ceded w/o a fight
    &gt; 13) Tunis is left undefended to an unsupported attack
    &gt;
    &gt; but most importantly
    &gt;
    &gt; 14) Not once in the game does anybody organize an anti-England
    &gt; alliance
    &gt;
    &gt; Maybe you could attribute a few of these developments to "luck", but
    &gt; _all_ of them?  Let's give credit where credit is due.  Christian has
    &gt; played one hell of a game.

    I am going hell bent for leather on my attack of England.  I was serious
    when I said I stabbed Russia to have a chance to try and stalemate this one.
    Use me as a batter ram or whatever.  These are my suggested moves.  Please

    &gt;  &gt; &gt;In response, the below, I am still learning and will take ALL these lessons
    &gt;  &gt; &gt;to heart.  It is tough runnin' with the big dogs.  But I do not regret be
    &gt;  &gt; &gt;asked to be a part.  Thanks Rick.
    &gt;
    &gt; You're quite welcome.  I think we'd all agree you did a lot more with
    &gt; Turkey than either of your predecessors, and were a welcome addition
    &gt; to the game.
    &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt;  &gt;
    &gt;  &gt; No need to kowtow, Meef.  most of what Christian wrote was plain wrong
    &gt;  &gt; anyway.
    &gt;  &gt;
    &gt;  &gt; Cal
    &gt;
    &gt; Meef has no need to kow-tow to anybody, I'd say.  I think he's the
    &gt; only one out of this crowd going to the second round of the big email
    &gt; tournament (and that includes Christian, Chris, Paul, John(?),
    &gt; Jim-Bob, and me.)
    &gt;
    &gt; Rick
    &gt;
    
    John was the smartest one of all of us!!  He didn't enter the WorldMasters
    Tournament!! ;-)  I guess Cal didn't either....

    how about all units except your fleets holding?  if we are really tryiong to
    stop the solo lets not mess around.
    
    I will move to the Ionian, and then support you in if it looks feasable.
    
    Tyrn sea's support will probably be cut FROM the Gulf of Lyon -- I think you
    would be better off Supporting Tuscany to the Gulf, on the theory that
    Westmed will be supported to hold from the MAO.  But that doesn't matter if
    you are in the GOL and Christian isn't -- GOL cuts westmed's support, and
    Ionian Supports Tyrhinian in.  That is the only real chance we have -- and
    if Christian is clever in the spring he'll realize this, and bounce me out
    of the Ionian.
    
    I haven't seen him be that clever so far this game, but it could happen.  I
    think we should play the percentage, though, and go for the Gulf.

    Well gentlemen, my moves are in. Let´s get this over with quickly, shall
    we? :) We can of course continue for four turns, but I have calculated
    (very accuratley mind you!) that within four turns there are no way to stop
    me. The problem is that if I try to win fast, I might spoil the long-term
    plan also. Therefore, shall I be a dare-devil and go for a quick (1918 :))
    solo or shall I go for a slow (1920) solo? If you all promise not to try to
    stop me I can of course go for the slow but anyway win this year. I suggest
    you lots move like this:
    
    Austria:
    A boh -&gt; vie
    A bud -&gt; ser
    A gal -&gt; bud
    F gre -&gt; aeg

    A tri -&gt; alb
    A tyr -&gt; tri
    
    Russia:
    A lvn -&gt; mos
    A mos -&gt; ukr
    A war Support A lvn -&gt; mos
    
    Turkey:
    A bul -&gt; con
    F naf -&gt; mao
    F rom Support F tys -&gt; nap
    A rum -&gt; sev
    F sev -&gt; arm
    F tus Hold
    F tys -&gt; nap
    
    What say you?
    
    Get the moves in quick or slow, doesn't matter to me. But if you send'em
    quick you can always claim you didn't have the time to stop me! :)

    I feel that the King should step back and give the new unified front a
    chance.  I have been doing some fast talking behind the scenes and a/r/t are
    as good an one power.  It is amazing the overwhelming sense of love, harmony
    and goodwill that has so quickly sprung up.  The Emperor and the Czar are
    currently drinking brandy and smoking cigars after a long day of playing
    polo in the Ukraine.  The goodness of man's heart never ceases to amaze me.

    &gt; &gt; &gt;Okay gents, he's getting smug.  Maybe we can't stop him, but if he ever
    &gt; &gt; &gt;attends a Con where any of us are at, he gets tossed in the nearest pool
    &gt; &gt; &gt;(frozen or not), agreed?
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Yeah! Maybe at WDC? There´s a pool there, I remember! Or you can come to
    &gt; my
    &gt; &gt; native Con SydCon in Malmö, it´s around the 12th of June...I am coming to
    &gt; &gt; you, then are you not coming to me? Not even to throw me in a pool? *s*
    &gt;
    &gt; I'll be at WDC in Baltimore this year if you're coming.  By the way, I'm
    &gt; 188cm and 130 kilos.  What do you figure my chances are of throwing you in

    Spill it, johnnymylad!  I have looked at it a couple of times, and it looks
    like a guessing game to me.
    
    The only chance would appear to be to kick Christian out of tunis, and then
    hold it.  My plan at this point is for meef to support his F Tuscany into
    the GoLyon, so that westmed's support can be cut in the fall.
    
    Christian, if he's clever, will bounce me out of the Ionian -- but he really
    isnt that clever, I hope.  It would almost guarantee the game for him.
    
    He should move MAO -&gt; NAf
    Tunis -&gt; Ionian
    Gulf of Lyon -&gt; Tyhn.
    Westmed S [either one, MAO -&gt; Naf for prefs.]
    
    I am bounced out of the Ionian, the fleet in NAf is popped, and and st pete
    is a major lock.  Cal's fault for not building on the North coast!
    
    Are you seeing something I'm not?

    what about:
    A TYR-PIE
    A TRI-VEN
    F ROM - NAP (!!!)
    F GRE - ION
    F TUS - GOL (!!!)
    F NAF S F TYS-TUN
    F TYS-TUN (or -WES but I like TUN better)
    
    remember that he asked for a "quick" win in 1918 as opposed to 1920. That
    means there is something he thinks is going to take him 2 years to do. Can't
    be STP :)  above, you "give" him TYS and create 3 guessing games in the fall
    (MAR/SPA/TUN). It is significant because if he also does A PIE-TUS this
    season thinking to cut your support, then MAR is wide open and the time it
    will take him to re-arraange and put a unit in Gascony to kick you out is
    one season longer than the time it will take the new fleet thereby gained to
    get to the front. Also in above set of moves, if he attacks NAF with MAO and
    TUN support then it is cut; if he attacks from TUN with MAO support then you
    get to ION and TUN (but probablyu cannot hold it in the fall)

    The problem with your plan (if I may interject) and the reason that England
    will win is that England attacks North Africa with two supports,
    Tunis and WMed, and the Fleet in TYS can only cut one of these supports.
    
    
    Without a fleet in Ion to cut the support in Tunis, there is no way for
    A/T to keep F NAf alive.
    
    
    And I think we all agree once England controls NAf, Tun, and WME, he's just
    not going to lose Tunis.  Then it's just a matter of waiting for St. PEte
    to fall.

    &gt;I am moving Pie-Tus, LYO-TYR supported by WES and MAO-NAF. That would

    As I think everyone should have noticed by now, the truly astounding
    level of play by our English player is NOT in tactics (there are at
    least three players in this game who seem to be as good or better at
    that), NOT in verbosity (almost everyone else in the game seems to be
    more verbose from what I've seen, except for our present Turk who has
    a fascinating clipped writing style!), but in just that characteristic
    of play that Paul notes.  He seems to keep everyone directed at being
    upset and angry at SOMEONE else... NOT him!
    
    That is the trait of a brilliant Diplomat!

    &gt;
    &gt; As I think everyone should have noticed by now, the truly astounding
    &gt; level of play by our English player is NOT in tactics (there are at
    &gt; least three players in this game who seem to be as good or better at
    &gt; that), NOT in verbosity (almost everyone else in the game seems to be
    &gt; more verbose from what I've seen, except for our present Turk who has
    &gt; a fascinating clipped writing style!), but in just that characteristic
    &gt; of play that Paul notes.  He seems to keep everyone directed at being
    &gt; upset and angry at SOMEONE else... NOT him!
    &gt;
    &gt; That is the trait of a brilliant Diplomat!
    
    Well, I agree that Christian has done a fine job of that this game, although
    the only reason I stopped being mad at him after his initial stab of me
    (don't forget that I had just pulled his chestnuts out of the fire with that
    build in St Pete's) was that someone else (Cyrille probably; he was good at
    that) pissed me off even worse.  Add to that Austrian treachery and German
    perfidy, I just never got back around to being mad at England.

    Some comments:

    Or even more. My weak point has always been in tactics (not in strategy though). Our team missed the first place in WDC because I didn't figure out t
    here was one move that would make me certain not to loose any center last year. Instead I did loose a center and we ended up beaten by that multi-nat
    ional team...Grr...Wow did my teammates hate me! :)
    
    &gt;NOT in verbosity (almost everyone else in the game seems to be
    &gt;more verbose from what I've seen, except for our present Turk who has
    &gt;a fascinating clipped writing style!)
    To my defence: I do not know what verbosity means, but I guess it has something to do with being able to speak/write fluently and affirmingly. Well,
    I am Swedish...You guys start playing in Swedish! :)
    
    &gt;but in just that characteristic
    &gt;of play that Paul notes.  He seems to keep everyone directed at being
    &gt;upset and angry at SOMEONE else... NOT him!
    Which as many people has said was not so hard in this game. I just added a little "stupid him" and "bloddy Chris" here and there. You all seemed so e
    ager to hate each other...:)
    
    And Cal, I think you should blame me for Cyrilles furiousity. I am sure he didn't mean no harm. :)
    
    all the best

    I'm leaving on Wednesday for a 10-day trip to Japan.  I'll remove the
    Moderated flag when I go, so anybody could make any necessary
    adjustments while I'm away to deadlines, etc.  I don't anticipate this
    should be a big problem.  I will have email access from the conference
    hotel in Tokyo, but afterwards I will go offline for about 5 days to
    see Mount Fuji, cherry blossoms, sumo wrestlers, kabuki, karaoke, and
    anything else Japanese I can fit into such a short trip.

    If players would get their orders in.... well, better left unsaid ;-)
    
    Don't get into any volcano dust clouds (realizing you will be well away
    from the danger area).
