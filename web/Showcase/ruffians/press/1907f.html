    &gt;     Next Spring, we might want to consider your allowing my F Kiel-Den.
    &gt;Then, in the Fall, you could support yourself back in, and I could retreat
    &gt;the fleet otb.  It
    &gt;would solve our problem with the needless German Fleet!
    
    Yes, that would be a good plan. Do you think we will manage to run over to
    the other side of stalemateline before A/I/R stops us?

    &gt;he should be! With Russia having built a unit, and England not only up +2

    If you can get some fleets into the Med after F/I are eliminated (or at least
    badly
    weakened this turn), and if I can hold on against Austria, we can possibly
    join with Turkey to turn the tide against Austria and his minions.

    &gt;
    &gt; /Christian
    
    Telling him is one thing; doing it is another!  If you want to try it as a
    "trick", to get
    Austria to jump after I or R, no problem.  If you really DO attack me, you lose
    time
    as my defense vs. Austria crumbles in the centerboard.
     My truest defense against your stabbing me is demonstrating that I really
    can hold Austria off in the center, while you finish off France and prepare to
    move
    fleets into the Med.
     As I see it, the likeliest Austrian moves are A Gal-Sil supported by
    Russian
    A War; A Boh-Mun supported by A Tyr; A Pie-S-Italian A Mar.
      My best possible defense against these moves is to order A Sil-Boh
    supported
    by A Mun; A Bur-S-A Mun; A Gas-Mar supported by your F Spa(sc); A Bel-Ruh;
    F Kie-Ber.
     If you don't move to Kie, I wind up in good shape to defend my homeland
    while
    still being no threat to you.  Austria still has only two units (Sil and Tyr)
    with which to attack Mun--not enough for him to break through.
     Meanwhile, you move F Mao-Por and F Eng-Mao; you hold in Den while trying
    a shot at StP.
     In S'08, A Ruhr supports Mun while I finally move A Gas-Mar with support
    from Bur and Spa!  The Italian A Mar is annihilated.  Ber is covered as the
    Fleet
    holds there.  A Mun supports A Boh-Tyr to possibly surprise Austria again.
     Meanwhile, you move F Edi-Nwg, F Mao-Wes and F Por-Mao-- setting yourself
    up to advance on both fronts.
     Yes, I am leaving myself wide open to your stabbing me in Bre or Bel or
    Kie;
    if I am to give an honest defense vs. Austria, I have to trust you 100%  My
    only
    defense against your stab is that I really am being useful in holding A/R back
    in the
    vital centerboard area.  I cannot be so useful once you stab for my dots.
     What do you say?   Paul

    DO attack me, you lose

    I don't even consider stabbing you. I think you and I can force the
    stalemateline! If I did stabb you Austria would win 18. That´s what
    happened when Toby Harris was playing Austria and I was playing England in
    WDC in Gothenburg. I don't wanna see that happening to my England again!!!
    I have sent a little message to Chris telling him I might stab you.
    Hopefully he does anything against I or R.
    
    &gt;      My best possible defense against these moves is to order A Sil-Boh
    &gt;supported
    &gt;by A Mun; A Bur-S-A Mun; A Gas-Mar supported by your F Spa(sc); A Bel-Ruh;
    &gt;F Kie-Ber.

    and Tyr)
    &gt;with which to attack Mun--not enough for him to break through.
    
    Ok, I can stop moving to Kiel. However, this move makes it impossible for
    us to disband your fleet next fall. Isn't i better if you just build an
    army berlin for the sc in Mar?
    
    Well, I´ll hold in Denmark and leave the decision up to you! Don't worry,
    as I have described above, I have stabbed Germany too many times in a
    situation like this!

    Will you get Tunis? If not, you could consider moving F Wes any other

    I think that would enable us (you and me) to have a two-way. The problem
    would be how to prevent the other from getting a solo, wich we both of
    course would want...Any thoughts? Russia is easily devided and stalemated
    between us, but the rest?

    Hej Cal,
    
    I will attack StP this turn. If you let me in I can go no further. I will
    put my fleet there and will concentrate on moving against Germany.The
    problem is that I am a bit obsessed with having StP as England, to secure
    my back. So if you are willing to let my fleet in and use your armies for
    something else then I don't have to mount three or four units around StP
    just to get it. That way we both get what we want, I get StP and you get me
    into Germanys back. If you defend StP, noone gets what we want. You loose
    StP eventually and you don't get me into Germanys back. This is of course
    just a thought, but you might wanna consider it, as cunning as you have
    shown to be so far in the game.
    
    Let me know your thoughts!

    &gt; &gt; Paul,
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt;Telling him is one thing; doing it is another!  If you want to try it as a
    &gt; &gt; &gt;"trick", to get Austria to jump after I or R, no problem.  If you really
    &gt; &gt; DO attack me, you lose
    &gt; &gt; &gt;time as my defense vs. Austria crumbles in the centerboard.
    &gt; &gt; I don't even consider stabbing you. I think you and I can force the
    &gt; &gt; stalemateline! If I did stabb you Austria would win 18. That´s what
    &gt; &gt; happened when Toby Harris was playing Austria and I was playing England in
    &gt; &gt; WDC in Gothenburg. I don't wanna see that happening to my England again!!!
    &gt; &gt; I have sent a little message to Chris telling him I might stab you.
    
    I am going to trust you.  No problem!
    
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; &gt;      My best possible defense against these moves is to order A Sil-Boh
    &gt; &gt; supported by A Mun, A Bur-S-A Mun, A Bel-Ruh, F Kie-Ber, A Bre H and Army
    &gt; &gt; Gas-Mar supported by your F Spa(sc).
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Ok, I can stop moving to Kiel. However, this move makes it impossible for
    &gt; &gt; us to disband your fleet next fall. Isn't i better if you just build an
    &gt; &gt; army berlin for the sc in Mar?
    &gt;
    &gt; Alas, if I use A Bur to support A Mun this Fall I may not have the strength to
    &gt; take Mar (assuming Aust A Pie supports Mar again).  I can only try to be patient
    &gt; and
    &gt; take it next gameyear after my A Ruhr can support Mun, freeing A Bur to join your
    &gt;
    &gt; F Spain in supporting Gas-Mar.  It IS a good idea to try Gas-Mar this Fall,
    &gt; though:
    &gt; if Italian A Mar orders support for French F Wes-Spa it will be cut and you'll
    &gt; keep
    &gt; Spain.
    &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt;
    &gt; &gt; Well, I´ll hold in Denmark and leave the decision up to you! Don't worry,
    &gt; &gt; as I have described above, I have stabbed Germany too many times in a
    &gt; &gt; situation like this!
    &gt;
    &gt; I can hold in Kie one more turn, but if Austria moves to Sil AND I fail to pick
    &gt; up
    &gt; Mar, I must move F Kie to cover Ber in S'08.  Much as I would like to get the
    &gt; fleet
    &gt; otb and replaced with an army, defending Ber will have to come first in 1908.
    &gt;      Much as I would love to use A Bur to provide a second support for Gas-Mar
    &gt; this Fall, I simply cannot afford to risk losing Mun.  After I have an army in
    &gt; Ruhr,
    &gt; Bur will be freed to help in the attack on Marseilles!

    Chris,
    
    Hmm.  A 2 way would certainly be a dynamic finish.  A little brushing up
    shows a number of options, revolving around StPete/Berlin/Munich/Tunis.
    
    I like the Stalemate line where the west holds StP, and Germany,  and the
    East holds Tunis and Italy.  It seems a reasonable division of forces at
    this point.
    
    If you were to attack Germany, I would be able to turn my full attention to
    nailing down Turkey, and then finishing off Italy and Russia.  I am willing
    to go for it if you are.  The article I am refrencing for stalemate lines is
    this:
    
    http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/stalemate.htm
    
    A bit dry, but the info is there.
    
    This will be a good opportunity to go for it for you.  It would be a pretty
    good one for me too!

    My thoughts?  Well, I once heard that over 33% of e-mail traffic throughout
    the world consists of people sending jokes to one another.  How nice to see
    you're adding to the total... d;-})
    
    How can you seriously tell me that the price of your attacking Germany is
    one of my home centres?  I don' care how obsessed you may be.  There are
    still eight German centres that you could be feasting on as opposed to my
    one.  Yeah, you'd eventually get St Pete, but is it worth it?  I'm not as
    stupid as you and Paul think I am.  If I let you get a foothold up north,
    you and he would steamroll me right out of the game.
    
    C'mon, make me an intelligent offer.  If we attack Germany, you get at least
    five centres out of the deal, probably six and there's NO WAY I can build
    fleets fast enough up north to be a threat to you.  Those German centres
    would guarantee your place in any draw.
    
    Time to get serious.

    You've got to get more sleep.  Where do you see me supporting Austria to

    seemed the best way to keep the peace with him.  And if you try to tell me I
    violated the "spirit" of OUR agreement, I fail to see how supporting Austria
    to GALICIA was any worse than your supporting yourself to Silesia last turn.
    
    I did EXACTLY what I told you I was going to do.  I defended myself against

    Ok, Question time -- defend St Pete, or defend Sev?  England can't be kicked
    out of StPete -- Turkey can be kicked out of Sev.
    
    Tough call -- it means I go into Ukraine, so that he can be kicked out next

    &gt; Will you get Tunis? If not, you could consider moving F Wes any other
    &gt; place, such that might incidentally cut a support.
    &gt;
    &gt; Or, i could move Mao-Wes if you move Wes-TRN.
    
    I think you should consider taking Spain and Portugal this year. Italy will
    likely be dislodged from Marseilles this next season and supposedly I am to
    support him from Marseilles to Spain. I haven not decided If I'm gonna do
    that yet, but it seems to me that you should lock down POR and SPA and get
    those builds on the table--you may need them in another direction. With the
    unsuccessful attack on Kiel, you will need several more units in the area to
    get any further in that direction, and if you are going to attack Russia you
    will need units there to do it. What I'm trying to do is help you get into
    the key SPA/POR area so that you can lock that section of the stalemate line
    down--your worst case scenario would then be a E/A/R 3way.

    &gt; that's your problem.  Would you sooner I DID attack you?
    
    Cal, I'm sorry if I misread the support you gave to Austria's move to Gal.  It's
    just
    that I could make no other sense out his urgency in reaching Gal unless it was
    pointed at Sil:  what would he have said-- "I want to police the neutral zone
    between us, so please support me to Gal"?  Why didn't he say "I want to keep the
    
    Hun's A Sil out of Gal, so let's bounce over that province and keep it clear"?
     No, please DON'T take it as an invitation on my part to support his
    Gal-Sil.  If
    he isn't asking for that support, he's probably just anxious to cut my A Sil's
    support
    for Mun (forcing me to make a decision between having A Bur support Mun or just
    having Bur support a move to Mar).  I'm sure that you can see why I might not
    like the idea of having to support Mun all the time, especially with two units
    if he
    takes Sil!  Aren't you grumbling about having to choose between supporting StP
    or
    Sev this Fall?  Wouldn't you grumble louder if England had three units bordering
    
    StP?
    
    &gt; &gt;      But will England REALLY make things as easy for you guys as France
    &gt; &gt; would
    &gt; &gt; like?  Somehow, I doubt it!
    &gt;

    &gt; honest about it.
    
    Who's not being honest about those same goals?  England?  Austria?  They are the
    ones who have chances for actual growth and offensive positioning....  Evidently
    
    England promised France that he would stab Germany if France handed Iberia over
    without a fight.  Apparently France was so desperate to believe that I could be
    "punished" for successfully stabbing him that he was willing to exit the game
    and
    simply watch it happen (or not) as an observer.
     The point which I am making to England, and hopefully to you as well, is
    that
    Germany is more useful to you both alive than dead; holding out at centerboard,
    I
    can stifle/slow Austrian growth in this vital area.  I can "keep him busy" with
    his futile massing of units in my direction, as long as neither you nor England
    choose to
    give him a nudge "over the hill".
     I am stating this as unambiguously as I possibly can.

    Roland,
    
    you raise some good points, but think on this --
    
    IF England isn't going to help Germany,
    
    AND Germany uses Burgundy to support Munich
    
    THEN Marsaille is safe!
    
    Germany certainly knows I am going to attack Munich.  So, burgundy will
    almost certainly be used to Support Munich.
    
    And for me, it's not so much trading Marsialles for munich, it's trading
    Rome for Munich!
    
    And, given how heavily Germany is commited in France, Munich is a pretty
    sure thing for me if I get there.  Its is a risk, but I think a small one.
    
    I think Gascony will support brest, just in case england tries to get
    frisky.
    
    If I have to pull a unit, we lose Marsaille anyway, just a year later, and
    we lose the chance to take Munich!
    
    I really think its worth it.  But you have to make the call, ultimately.  I
    appriciate you beinghonest with me.  I hope you don't choose to hold simply
    because we have fought in the past.  If Germany and France don't fight, they
    can sweep over the board now that Iberia is broken.

    about defending!).
    
    Russia is pushingme against you as hard as possible. I have told him no, I
    will first take StP. He doesn't buy it though, he will defend StP anyway.
    Too bad...:-)
    
    Austria wants us (him and me) to have a 2-way with me holding StP and
    Germany and he holding R+T+I +Tunis. Can't see it happening really, but I
    am of course telling him it is a good idea. Hopefully he takes some Italian
    sc:s soon so that Italys fleets are disbanded!

    Cal,
    I understand that you are upset?
    
    My offer was actually a seious one. Once I am in StP I cannot loose it and
    you cannot loose anything south of it (whothout me getting help from
    Austria). I was trying to negotiate a safe-zone for both of us.
    
    Look at it this way:
    With us fighting over StP you use two or three units to hold it. That is
    three units that could be useful elsewhere.
    
    With me in StP with a fleet (nc) you loose one unit because of the
    center-loss. That leaves one or two of the units used to defend StP inthe
    example above free to do other stuff.
    
    So actually, you are bying freedom for two units by accepting my offer.
    
    A homecenter is not that important, you have three more to build in.
    
    I have tried to be honest with you after my stab and gave you the needed
    time to fight Turkey back. I still try to be honest with you and wants to
    be safe in the northern area to make sure you and I can concentrate
    together on Germany. With you in StP and me in Nwy+Fin we will always be
    suspicious about each others intentions, but with me with a fleet (nc) StP
    we can trust each other to fully concentrate on Germany. I may move fleets
    to Bal/Hel. That´s it. My proposal was serious. At least I look upon it as
    serious. If you feel an other way, no can do. I will not attack Germany
    before StP is mine. Sorry.

    Well, look at it this way. I do not support Spa(sc) with MAO, I am moving
    to WES. If you move on to TRN or LYO you can get either MAR or Tunis next
    turn. A french fleet in Tunis could be alive a long time!
    
    If nothing else, you can attack Spa to make sure my support to Gas-Mar is
    cut :-)

    Chris,
    I will not move directly against Germany this move. I will however probably
    misorder in Spain so that I support the wrong unit into Marseilles. My main
    probelm is that i really don't like to attack Germnay before I have control
    over StP. I am trying to convince Cal about the good things about giving
    StP up to a English fleet Stp(nc) and then attack Germany togteher with
    that problem out of the way. He doesn't listen though.
    
    My reasoning is like this:
    If Russia tries to defend StP he uses three units for a long time to defend
    something he will loose eventually anyway.
    
    If Russia gives me StP (with a fleet nc) he looses one unit due to
    center-loss but can thus use two units more than otherwise to atack Germany
    or Turkey.
    
    Had you given up StP if you were him?
    
    Anyway, if you want to go for the two-way, keep up the positions for
    R-stabbing and we can move within two years (when I have finished StP by
    force!). If you can convince Cal to leave StP now we can go for Germany
    next spring!

    Fine.  You stay out of Norway and I'll stay out of St Pete's

    I'm not doing much else.  If my raison d'etre becomes fighting over St

    and I lost two builds.
    
    &gt; So actually, you are buying freedom for two units by accepting my offer.

    intelligence with crap like this, we can forget about working together.
    France may have fallen for your "Give me Iberia and I'll stab Germany" lie,
    but I'm not him.
    
    I'm sorry if I seem angry, but this really is a load of bullshit.  I guess
    we fight to the end of the game.

    how should we best handle the taking of Tunis? My info from England
    indicates he will move F MAO - WES (i'm guessing for the superior position)
    and will use F SPA to support Germany into Marseilles (strange when combined
    with the move on KIE last season). Depending on how you see things working,
    perhaps I can convolute things by using A NAF to move to TUN and using F WES
    to move to MAO causing a large bounce and I would then keep POR for another
    year---or end up in Tunis and MAO, also a big headache for England's
    expansion into the Med.

    John,
    
    Hmmm.  Good points all.  I think that England will probably take Portugal
    now, and move F Engch to Mao.  I think you'll be best off supporting the
    Fleet into Tunis -- I have other plans for the F ionian, alas.
    
    If I really thought you would get into the MAO, I'd say go for it -- but I
    just cant see that happening.

    &gt; Ok, Question time -- defend St Pete, or defend Sev?  England can't be
    kicked
    &gt; out of StPete -- Turkey can be kicked out of Sev.
    &gt;
    &gt; Tough call -- it means I go into Ukraine, so that he can be kicked out
    next
    &gt; season.  Even then, he can cut Moscow's support for StPete.
    &gt;
    &gt; What do you think?
    
    I think I want to "smite" England even more than Cyrille.  He has demanded
    St Pete as the price for attacking Germany.  He wants to feel secure - no
    secure feeling, no attack on Germany.  I told him that France may have been
    dumb enough to fall for the "You give me Iberia, I attack Germany" crap, but
    I wasn't about to.  I swear, Cyrille, Christian, Paul and Roland are all
    playing this as if it were a novice game.  My EOG is going to have some
    nasty things to say about the way my intelligence has been insulted in this
    game...  As if the E/G isn't the most obvious thing since Christian's naive
    thoughts that he is working some secret master plan...
    
    Do I sound pissed?  Well, I am.  You have no worries about me sticking with
    you.  As far as I'm concerned,  you're the only player in this game (besides
    myself) that deserves to be in a demo game.  Sheesh!
    
    I'm going to support St Pete's (No!  Really?) against England and I'd like
    you to use Ser/Gre to support me in Bulgaria. Would it be possible for us to
    bounce Sev & Gal in Rum?  I have this feeling Cyrille will try for Rum
    instead of Sev.  After all, I've been unrelenting in my opposition to him
    all game and he has no reason to think I'd prefer to stop England's attack
    on St Pete's over his on Sev.  But then again he hasn't shown much tactical
    imagination either.  What do you think?

    &gt; Message from prosit@execpc.com as Germany to Russia in 'ruffians':
    &gt;
    &gt; Cal, I'm sorry if I misread the support you gave to Austria's move to Gal.
    It's
    &gt; just
    &gt; that I could make no other sense out his urgency in reaching Gal unless it
    was
    &gt; pointed at Sil:  what would he have said-- "I want to police the neutral
    zone
    &gt; between us, so please support me to Gal"?  Why didn't he say "I want to
    keep the
    &gt; Hun's A Sil out of Gal, so let's bounce over that province and keep it
    clear"?
    &gt;      No, please DON'T take it as an invitation on my part to support his
    &gt; Gal-Sil.
    
    That unit in Gal probably IS pointed at Sil and I apologize for that, but,
    as I said, it was the price of keeping peace for my side.  I'm basically
    without a friend that can do me any good and I'd rather not piss off
    Austria.
    
    &gt; &gt; Me too.  I don't think England has a clue as to what he is trying to
    &gt; &gt; accomplish in this game.  Me, I'm just trying to stay alive and to be in
    a
    &gt; &gt; position to grow if the opportunity presents itself.  And at least I'm
    being
    &gt; &gt; honest about it.
    &gt;
    &gt; Who's not being honest about those same goals?  England?  Austria?  They
    are the
    &gt; ones who have chances for actual growth and offensive positioning....
    Evidently
    &gt; England promised France that he would stab Germany if France handed Iberia
    over
    &gt; without a fight.  Apparently France was so desperate to believe that I
    could be
    &gt; "punished" for successfully stabbing him that he was willing to exit the
    game
    &gt; and
    &gt; simply watch it happen (or not) as an observer.
    
    England is trying the same bullshit on me.  He has been claiming that he is
    going to stab you for four consecutive turns now, but now he has written me
    (received just after I wrote back to you) and made it clear that he has no
    intention of attacking you unless I give him a feeling of security by
    handing over St Pete's.  I told him that if he is going to insult my
    intelligence by talking to me like I was a novice, he can lose my address
    and piss off.  I'm actually pretty upset (in game terms) by what kind of
    crap is coming out of his mouth.
    
    
    &gt;      The point which I am making to England, and hopefully to you as well,
    is
    &gt; that
    &gt; Germany is more useful to you both alive than dead; holding out at
    centerboard,
    &gt; I
    &gt; can stifle/slow Austrian growth in this vital area.  I can "keep him busy"
    with
    &gt; his futile massing of units in my direction, as long as neither you nor
    England
    &gt; choose to
    &gt; give him a nudge "over the hill".
    &gt;      I am stating this as unambiguously as I possibly can.
    
    I get what you're saying.  What I can't help thinking is this: while it
    looks like you and England could be a pretty good alliance, you are always
    going to have to have eyes in the back of your head.  It's a pretty rotten
    feeling knowing that England can stab you whenever he wants and you can
    neither stop his attack nor even pull a pre-emptive strike because of your
    lack of fleets.  Been there, done that.  It sucks.
    
    But, at the same time, you are making far too much of Austria's position. He
    has an enemy in back (Turkey) who is still strong enough to hurt him badly
    and neither Austria nor I can spare enough strength to kill him because of
    you and England.  Austria also has two very questionable allies in France
    and Italy.  Hell, with Austria sitting in Venice and Roland and he having
    had a pretty crumby relationship all game (trust me on this), I'm not sure
    Italy is an Austrian ally at all.
    
    I know it's hard to consider someone to be not much of a threat when he's
    kind of at your doorstep, but do you see what I mean when I say Austria
    isn't the threat to the board that England is?
    
    I'd say that, in terms of their chances to do well in the game, England is
    way above everyone else, Germany is next (IF England sticks with you, you're
    tied with Austria if he doesn't), Austria is third, R/T next and F/I
    bringing up the rear.  Sound about right?
    
    &gt; Cool?
    
    I think you and I are cool, but I'd love to see the focus of this game
    change a bit.  In my perfect little world, you and Austria would bury the
    hatchet, allowing him and I to bury the Turk.  Then you and I could knock
    England down to size while Austria grabs Italy and sails west through the
    Med.  Of course, since it's MY fantasy, I stab you both and win the game,
    but if I want to be realistic, we just end it in a two or three-way draw
    (whatever works best) &lt;G&gt;.  Do you see any chance of this happening?  If I
    could talk Austria into moving away from you, how far would you go to meet
    him halfway?

    Cal -- I am supporting you to hold in Bulgaria -- I am expecting your
    support from Gal -&gt; Sil.
    
    Christian writes and says "can you convince Cal to let St Pete go?  I can
    take it soon enough anyway.  I am inclined to agree with him -- he wants to
    take on Germany, and so he would probably take it with a fleet.  This would
    let you defend Sev, and take Cyrile down to 3, thus ensuring we can finish
    him off.  Once Christian has stp, he will probably pay attention to other
    stuff.  Cyrille wont stop.until he takes StPete.  Still, it's up to you.  If
    you DO decide to support StPete, you should probably move Sev -&gt; Rum, incase
    Cyrille gets clever and convoys armenia there!

    Obviously the first step is for you to move ONE of your units away so you
    don't have support on St Pete's.  Then, if we don't feel we can trust each
    other, we can just keep bouncing units in St Pete's and Norway, the way you
    and Germany are doing in Kiel.  This would free me to deal with Turkey and
    you could attack Germany with all those juicy supply centres waiting there

    Dear Chris:
    
     As must be obvious to you, your growing encroachment towards my
    homeland
    is keeping me from building any more fleets and is even diminishing my
    defensive
    capabilities with regard to England.  If I have to waste units defending
    the home dots, I have less to work with in defending Hol/Bel/Bre, much
    less in putting together some form of an offensive pressure on
    Christian.
     With France suiciding out in favor of England, and with the
    possibility of
    Christian's picking up StP, I am faced with a sizable foreign body
    "behind my back".  I certainly can't be comfortable with this!
     The corner power behind YOUR back, Turkey, is less threatening but
    is a
    continuing thorn in your side.  If we were not in this "Cold War", you
    could be
    eliminating Roland as a force behind your lines quite quickly. Using the
    builds
    you gained thereby, you could create a navy to stand up to England's
    once he enters
    the Mediterranean theatre!
     Chris, if you allow me to finally take Mar I can build a second
    fleet in Berlin.
    By F'08, I can begin putting pressure on English held Scandinavia!
     If you at least stay away from Sil, I can simply defend Mun with
    one army while
    using the others to defend Bre/Bel/Hol.
     This Fall, I could support A Bur-Mar with Gas and have two units
    bordering on
    Spain.  All this might not hurt England significantly, but it could
    prevent his
    explosion into a power gaining 3 centers per gameyear.  Surely that is
    in your
    interest, as well as Russia's and mine?
     You can keep armies in Boh and Tyr, if that helps you feel safe.  I
    can live with
    two foreign units bordering Mun.  But if you enter Sil, we have a
    serious breach in
    German security:  I must devote two supports to Mun AND another unit to
    the defense of Berlin.  I will be left wide open to England's
    encroachment.
     Can we start a dialogue here, before our choices are simple war at
    centerboard
    and seeing an English victory?
    
    Paul

    'ruffians':
    
    Hey guys,
    
    I just want to add that I'm in favour of Paul's proposal.  With you guys
    fighting, England has free rein to do anything he wants, including making
    silly demands for me to surrender St Pete's.  Also, without Austria and I
    being able to commit enough of our forces, Turkey becomes almost impossible
    to kill.  If we can work together, we can all make much more efficient use
    of our units.
    
    For my part, with England on one side and Turkey on the other, I have to do
    a balancing act to stay on both of your sides.  I can't afford to piss
    anyone off and that severely limits my ability to actually DO anything.  I'd
    love the opportunity to work with both of you against E/T.
    
    Can we work something out to demilitarize the Central Plain? Paul's offer to
    let Chris maintain units in Boh/Tyr seems pretty equitable.  I'd love to
    free up my Warsaw army.  I'm not going to "let" England into St Pete's and
    if Germany can build a fleet, I think we can accomplish something to benefit
    all three of us.

    Gentlemen,
    
    I must say, this is the most sensible discussion I have seen in this game in
    some time.  OF COURSE it benefits the central powers to work toghether.  The
    only reason I am marching on Munich is that the English/German alliance
    looked quite strong.
    
    The French retreat has changed all that, of course.  I do have one
    condition, however.
    
    How do you suggest we go about this?  I am about to lose Rome, and will have
    to remove a unit if I do not gain one in return.  I am not a center Grabber,
    I can live with going back one step for the moment, if I have to, but I do
    need more fleets as well.
    
    I am willing to work out an arrangement on this, but I have to see some long
    term benefits first.  For example:
    
    Paul, you take Marsaille, putting you up one.  Cal and I could dislodge the
    unit in Silesia, which would then retreat off the board.  You are +2.
    
    Kiel could move to the Helgoland bight, while Munich moves to Kiel, bouncing
    with denmark of course, leaving you room to build 2 new fleets.
    
    Next year, Munich and Warsaw dislodge my army from Silesia, which I retreat
    off the board -- allowing me to build a new fleet.
    
    This is the sort of arrangement I think has a chance of working -- remember,
    christian builds 2 this year!
    
    Best,
    
    Chris

    To shorten this down to a phrase: what the fuck?!?
    
    I don't understand you wanting to prolong a war with Germany.  You've
    probably forced him back into bed with England and that's no good for anyone
    in the east.  Heck, you've got ME thinking you're doing the long term thing
    with England.
    
    If Turkey was dead, I could see all this, but he's not.  Whassup?

    Paul,  Cal,
    
    I swear I did not intend to end up in Munich.  I just got home and have
    looked over the results and thought that A silesia -&gt; Bohemia would cut my
    support in.  I have no desire to force england and Germany to work together.
    Let me look at the moves again and see what happened.

    Gentlemen,
    
    Ok -- There were a number of miscues here, but none of them irreparable.
    Italy is now OUT.  I couldn't possibly be happier, Roland has been a thorn
    in my side for WAY too long.
    
    Paul, you copied your orders to us at the end of the email you sent last.
    It included a move of Sileisa -&gt; Bohemia.
    
    Cal thought I was going to move Bohemia -&gt; Silesia.
    
    I thought he was going to support Galicia -&gt; Silesia, and then you would
    dislodge that unit in the spring.   As it is, NO units were dislodged for
    Either of us, but due to my stab of Italy, I will build a fleet now.  I can
    lose munich immediately next year, I will walk out and let Silesia in.  I DO
    NOT WANT TO RE-START HOSTILITIES.
    
     (I can't help thinking:  "We did not mean to bomb the chinese embassy"
    DOH!)
    
    Cal,  I assure you I am all aboard for the destruction of Turkey.
    
    Paul, I assure you I am all aboard for the destruction of England.
    
    I am leaving bright and early tomorrow morning to teach in the catskills (I
    know, very dirty dancing).  I'll be back on Sunday, and I hope to stay in
    touch then!

    Well, part of the problem here is that, when I asked what was I supposed to

    Paul:  I'm don't know what to say right now.  My first inclination is that
    Chris is trying to screw us both and his latest letter doesn't totally
    UNconvince me of that.  Suffice it to say that I'm glad we at least get a
    chance to look at his build before deciding if we're getting suckered.  It's
    occurred to me that A/E are actually in it together for the long haul.  I
    wouldn't put it past either of them.
    
    If you don't believe Chris, or if he doesn't build the fleet, my army in
    Warsaw is at your disposal to get Munich back to you.

    Roland,
    
    I hope you are not a)too surprised, or b) too disapointed.  When I have
    someone on the ropes, and I let them get back up, help them even, I don't
    need them questioning my "suggestions".  I'll say it again -- I would like
    to have your fleet in the Med helping me.  I don't figure you would do
    anything but spit at me at this point, but if you want to stay in the game,
    I will not take Rome as long as you order that fleet the way I want it
    ordered.
    
    Your build and disband will, of course, be my answer, though if you want to
    berate me as a treacherous bastich, that is of course your right.  ;)
    
    Nothing personal -- I rather enjoyed our early years of sparring.  I think
    the A/I dynamic is one of the most fascinating on the board, and you have
    always stood by your convictions.  I respect that, I just can't let it get
    in the way of World Domination!  Muhwhahahahahahahah!  ;)

    Those are the movement orders he had going -- now, evidently he is going to
    change them.  Or should we trust him?
    
    Well, I say support A Galicia -&gt; Silesia, and if he is playing us straight
    fine, if not, we can take him down from there.
    
    I'll be supporting you to hold in Bulgaria.  Turkey at 3 will be alot easier

    Or did you not WANT to support my army Galicia into Silesia?  He would have
    been able to disband and build a fleet, but would he have?  hmmmmm.

    Nope, I checked my files and I never received it.
    
    Obviously, YOU didn't read his letter carefully (or he sent you a different
    version?).  The one *I* saw had that set of orders you quote and ANOTHER set
    right after with the moves which were the ones he eventually used, so I KNEW
    he had at least sent in a new set.
    
    Here are the relevant parts:
    
    &gt; &gt; Okay guys, I'll go along with the plan.  Everything I do at this stage
    is a risk
    &gt; &gt; anyway, so why not go for the gusto?

    I have been watching silently for some time now..... but I thought
    I would weigh in as France and Italy move very close to oblivion
    in this game.
    
    First of all, I would comment that these demo games have had a
    VERY strong tendency to end up in three way draws (some claim
    that among expert players, given the stalemate lines, this is
    the logical long run outcome of the game).  I am sitting here
    this fine Saturday morning contemplating what three way draw
    is most likely and finding some VERY interesting analysis.
    I won't share my conclusions at this point..... hey, you guys
    can all figure it out ;-)  but I think that the next game year
    or two will be very interesting along that line.
    
    Second, I want to remind all of you that another intent of this
    series is to mix expert players from disparate mediums and hobbies.
    This has ALWAYS resulted in some "funny" results as particular
    expert players were taken out of their games or put in situations
    that they found very frustrating.  I just want to take this
    opportunity (it seems a good juncture in the game to do it)
    to THANK each of you for putting your "egos" and playing reputations
    on the line where there were not any soft players to wipe off
    the map easily.  Mistakes?  Yes, perhaps some have been made,
    no one is perfect, but this has been a game thus far to have
    lived up to the reputation of the series.  I would caution all
    of you to remind yourselves what a knife-edge game this is,
    especially when played with great players.  But, ultimately it
    still is a game.  I say all that because I see these attempts
    to "take players out of their game", which all is WITHIN the
    game.  I think you all know what I mean here and I just want
    to thank all of you for putting the time into the game and to
    Rick for GMing it!  I look forward to see how it plays out and
    despite all this rhetoric, not to see any "early draws" ;-)
    
    Diplomacy IS still THE game.

    &gt;

    &gt; Well, if he builds another fleet Tri this Winter all is not lost.  I'm going on

    &gt; will

    &gt;      Perhaps a bit of good can come out of this.  England might think that

    &gt;
    &gt; Okay, I was had!  Austria promised Cal and I that he would stay out of Mun
    &gt; while
    &gt; dislodging my A Sil.  I would then have built a second fleet, and have been
    &gt; more
    &gt; effective in slowing your growth.  The idea was for the middle (G/A/R) to play
    &gt;
    &gt; against the ends.
    &gt;      Neither Cal nor I are happy about the Austrian moves, believe me!  I DO
    &gt; want
    &gt; to make amends with you and get even with Chris, if it is not too late.
    &gt;      If you put a fleet in Nth this Spring, and I hold in Hel, you can
    &gt; dislodge the
    &gt; German fleet in the Fall.  I can retreat it otb and turn it into an army, as
    &gt; we had
    &gt; originally planned!
    &gt;      Since I gained Mar but lost Mun, I don't get a build this season.  Russia
    &gt; is already promising me help in getting back into Mun, but his A War is a

    Hi guys:
     With England getting two builds this season, I expect that they
    will be fleets in
    Edi and Lon and that they will be headed for Nth and Eng.
     A Gas will be available to defend Bre when needed, but this Spring
    it could try
    supporting A Bur-Spa (slowing the advance of English fleets into the
    Med).
     Chris, if you are serious about vacating Mun for my A Sil to go
    there, why not
    send A Mun- Ruhr?  Once England has fleets in Eng and Nth, it could
    support my  A Bel, or bounce Bel over Hol.
     The Austrian A Gal might be a big help to Russia if it moves to Ukr
    this Spring.
    Cal might need the help in re-capturing Sev.
     But Cal's big problem might be if Turkey sends A Sev-Mos, to cut
    Russian
    support for his A StP (far be it from me to mention this to Cyrilles,
    but Christian
    may have no such scruples).

    Yes, I still think that a G/E alliance is worthwhile.  Austria claims that
    he took
    Mun, after "making a deal with me", by accident-- don't you hate it when
    people
    insult your intelligence and play you for a complete fool?
      Even Cal is upset about the Austrian stab:  his priority is to limit
    the powers of
    the corner powers, and he sees the G/A war as playing into his enemies'
    hands.  He'
    is willing to hit Aust A Gal with War while I support myself back to Mun,
    but that
    will only drive the Austrian army into Berlin!  I have requested that he
    wait until
    the Fall before hitting Gal, while I move A Mar-Bur and Bel-Ruhr.  This will
    
    enable me to hit Mun with two supports, plus I will be able to cover Ber
    with Sil.
     I am still willing to hold in Hel, while you move another fleet to
    Nth:  in the Fall
    you can dislodge the fleet and I'll retreat it otb to be reborn as an army
    (probably in
    Kie).
     I would imagine that you will be swinging your fleets into the Med,
    i.e., F Mao-
    Wms, F Spa(sc)- Gol, F Por-Spa(sc)?
     If you can get the Turkish A Sev to hit Mos, the Russian support for
    StP would
    be cut!  I don't know if Cyrilles will want to risk this, but it is worth a
    try!
     Cheers,
                  Paul

    So, it seems that we must play. Finally you go North. You take StPet now,

    Well, I made my move a little early, but when opportunity knocks, you have

    Can we agree that you will not enter the West Med for the moment?  I am
    building a fleet to go finish off Turkey with, and I should think you are
    going to take advantage of the timing to hit Germany where it hurts.

    Hi!
    
    We need to get an army into Piedemont supported by army Marseilles (or a
    fleet in Marseilles.) Whithout that we cannot hold the stalemate if it
    comes to that. I assume Paul are supporting Gas-Bur with Marseilles? If you
    also move Brest-Gas you are in position to move Mar-Pie, Gas-Mar next move.
    Hopefully Chris doesn't see us going for stalemates so soon. From there we
    can go for Tyrolia "from beneath"...We are lucky to be on the
    not-so-messy-side of the board. Anyway, I also need a fleet to NAf to keep
    the stalemate (to stand in NAf supporting French F Tunis.)
    
    Paul, why don't you move F Hel-Kie, A Kie-Berlin, A Bel-Ruh, A Gas-Bur. In
    the fall you kick Austria out and are back. From there you can move on into
    Pru ad build a new army and the stalmate is there. All I need to do is put
    a fleet in Lvn supported by StP and we can hold there forever.

    Okay, that seems to cover everything until I can recapture Mun.  After I am

    Hi Cal and Chris:
     England has written.  He is willing to "forgive" my minor
    transgressions if I
    join a E/G/F campaign for a three way draw.  His theory is that if he
    holds StP,
    I regain all my home dots, and he supports France in Tunis, that makes
    18 total and
    it entitles us to a three way draw.  Wouldn't you guys still be able to
    veto the
    proposal and insist on a DIAS if there is a  east/west stalemate line
    established?
     This seems overly timid to me.  I'd rather work towards a G/A/R,
    eliminating
    the small fry (F, I, T) at least.
     Christian mentions going for Lvn this season (with a fleet!), while
    encouraging
    me to cover Ber, Ruh, Bur and Pie.  He intends to move fleets to Wms and
    Gol.

    Yes, if we have 18 between us and they cannot crack our stalemate line, we are
    definitely to be counted amongst the winners.  First we establish the line, make
    it
    impenetrable, and then it is up to Chris to see if the "small fry" can be
    eliminated.
    The role of Cal in all of this is yet to be foreseen.

    other than the obvious lack of reason for me to help Germany do *anything*,
    I want to be sure I understand what you are asking: are you asking that if
    we three can sit on 18 then we can declare a 3way draw? Then the answer is
    "no": a draw includes all the survivors. I think if you want a three way you
    are going to have to look to the trio being England + Austria + Turkey.
    It's the only one where all 3 of you can work together without the threat of
    any one getting a solo, and it gives both Austria and England room to grow
    towards the center.
    
    If you continue to try and keep Germany as an ally, then I fear you will end
    up with  4-way or a 5-way. It will take you too long to get around the edges
    and by that time a solid pair in the East will appear. Chris (Austria) is
    too good a player not to know what to do and to give Turkey and even Russia
    to make sure that E/G do not enter the east before he can control the
    outcome.
