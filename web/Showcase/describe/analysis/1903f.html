<p><pre>
a bul s aeg - con
	Requested by Italy.	 T has a 50/50 choice with smy - protect con
or protect eas.	 Once he guess wrong, he will fall.

f gre s ion - aeg
	Requested by Italy.	 Keeping up the pressure on T.

a bud s vie
	Losing vie cannot be risked, since taking it back could be
difficult.

a tri - tyr
a vie s tri -tyr
	Cannot let G into tyr.	With support from vie, and ven(Italy), I
may be able to take it.

a rum s bul
	rum holding to recieve support from ser(Italy).

	I could have gone for gal with rum-gal with bud, vie supporting.
But since Italy refused to do ven-tyr, I had to do tri-tyr.	 That meant
bud would have to support vie, which ruled out going for gal.


France
	He is still besieged by EG.	 I can keep a few German units busy
with tyr and boh to help him out.  Rumors that he wants Italy to stab me.

England
	He has pulled out of nwg, so he won't be attack R.  Not well
positioned to stab G.  Diplomatically, he has influence on Germany, so I
continue trying to get E to get G to stop attacking me.

Turkey
    He is dealing with Italy to try and save himself.  con will most
likely be holding, so I expect it to support Italy into bul.  Hopefully,
Italy won't take him up on it.

Russia
	I'm still trying to get him to attack G by claiming FAR vs EG now
is better for him than sticking with EGR becuase

1) AI vs RG is a stalemate.  After F falls, he's EG's next victim.
2) If Italy stabs me and I go down, he is still the likely next target on
   Germany's list and E and/or I is likely to help out G.
3) Attack G now with my help.  Wait to long, F will be gone, and once EG
   attacks you I'm my join in against him.

Italy
    My fate rest with him, with R, G, and T (and maybe FE?) all urging
him to stab me.  My threat to drag him down with me in the event of stab
still stands.  I assured him that with RG on my back and since I'm not
positioned to stab him, he need not fear me stabbing him.
	I would have prefered he do ven-tyr, but he refused becuase F was
going to leave mar open.  The prospect of G sneaking into pie worried
him.  Also, It puts him in a better positon to garud against me and to
stab me down the road.	Unfortuately, I need Italy more than he needs me,
so I go along with his wishes.

Germany
	He proposed that he would withdraw from boh in spr04 if Italy or
I did not enter tyr in fall03.	I don't trust G at all because of his
goofy "justifications" for his anti-Austrian behavior.  A tyr DMZ is out
of the question, since I believe he is just trying to make another lame
attempt to fool me into letting down my guard so he can get into tyr.  I
counter proposed a mutual bounce in tyr in spr03 with boh withdrawing in
spr03 as well.  G did not try very hard to negotiate a deal, leading me
to conclude he was not making a serious peace overture.  Becuase of our
past difficulties, I told him I would not trust him until he pulled out
of boh first; he never really responded.
    Italy wants to try and get G to stab E.  I couldn't get G to stab
R, and in the process got the two of us annoyed at each other.	So, I
leave most of this to Italy.

Moves:
	smy - aeg
	con - bul
	eas s smy - aeg
		I am gambling that I/A attack eas instead of con.
Strategy: Nothing new.	So, Italy isnt going to stab Austria after all.
		  Too bad.	A/I have a 50% chance of taking a center from me
	if they guess right in the spring.
