    German Press Agency ---URGENT ---- Latest News ------ URGENT ------
    GPA announces the following:
    In the early morning of May, 8st 1906, German soldiers of the 2.
    Gardedivision under the leading of General Johan Graf von Greifenklau
    stormed the German Reichstag, Schloss Lichtenberg and several other
    buildings in Berlin. The Kaiser was shot on the run. The new military
    government declared, that Germany will soon change his government to a
    democratic one with elections held as soon as the war will end.
    Generalfeldmarschall Paul von Hindenburg was declared as new
    Reichskanzler. In his first speech, von Hindenburg said:
    Nations of Europe, the german people is tired of all the war. Without the
    imperialistic and anti-german politics of the French Government, all this
    had not to have happened. Well, the french problem will be solved soon and
    we invite all nations to Berlin for peace talks. We know that our Italian,
    Austrian and Russian friends were blended by the evil french president and
    we know that the cry for peace is in all of our hearts.
    With the changing of the german government, the german politics in future
    will change too. We hope, all of you are willing to recognize that.

    your moves in sooner.
