    Greetings
    
      I'm extending the deadline for a player who is having access
    problems.  Hopefully they will be resolved earlier than the
    deadline I set.

    The player for whom I extended the deadline has resolved the
    access problem.  Since the deadline was only extended because
    of those problems, will the player(s) who have set wait please
    set nowait?
    
    Also, one of the players has expressed concern at the rate at
    which this game is moving because he may be losing access in
    mid-april.  I think that some delays are unavoidable for one
    reason or another, but I hope that the game can proceed more
    quickly now that the long holidays are over.
    
    If everyone would like the game to move more quickly, I can
    change the deadlines for move phases from 72 hours to 48 hours.
    However, since some people may feel like this is too short for
    a game with press, so I will only make this change if every
    player agrees.  Please let me know your preference.
    
                - Simon

    I have no objections to shorter turns. I would like to point out though that
    this weekend I will be away. It should very definitively be the last such outing
    for some time though.

    Okay, based on the votes I've received, the deadlines for this
    game will not be shortened.     Hopefully people will be good about
    staying on time and the game will start to move at a good pace.

    As I stated previously, I was away from Thursday to Sunday. As such I would like
    the deadline to be extended until Monday night GMT please.
    Thank you.
