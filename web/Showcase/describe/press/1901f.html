    Today is the last day I'll be reading my email, so if anyone
    wants to talk to me before I'm gone, better make it quick.
    I'll be sending in moves before I leave, and hope I don't get
    ganged up on my absence.  :)

    I am having access problems due to the government shutdown and in
    the interim I am extending the deadline in case there are any problems
    in my absence.    Upon my return, I will adjust the deadlines according
    to the vacation schedules people sent me so if you are going to be away
    past the first, rest assured that you will not miss any deadlines.    If there
    are no problems, feel free to continue to play for as long as you are
    around despite the current extension.

    I apologize for not getting to anybody earlier.      However, the winter
    came early this year and it has been extremely cold.  I was stuck in
    Northern SIberia for awhile and I got back and became ill.    I am back and
    should be okay now.     I still have a little cough though.

    Fellow Leaders,
    
    After many pints of cider and ale during our Yuletide in the
    Cotswolds, we have returned to London in the hopes of progressing the
    cause of European peace.  Please feel free to communicate with us openly
    and in frequency.
    And to all, a happy New Year.

    Bonjours, ici Paris.
    
    We have had our fair share of wine and champagne. Yet for all our wows, we would
    like to wish everybody a very Merry Christmas and a happy New Year.
    On the side, if my memory serrves me correct, during the First Word War Germans
    and French played footballs and shared in the Christmas spirit. This was seen as
    a very dangerous development by the higher hierachy and was severly dealt with.
    Oh well, all is fair in love and war.
    
    Le President de la Republique Francaise.

    On Saturday, 23 December, the Conference of Liverpool was graced
    with an astounding display of this newfangled sport called football.  The
    providers of this show - the national sides of England and Italy.  The
    following is a match report of the friendly, and should any of you fellow
    leaders also be a football fan, we think it would be good reading.
    We English, of course, were victorious.     After all, we invented
    the sport.
    
    Lord Sheringham
    
    
    
    
    From The Daily Telegraph, 24 December 1901:
    
    > REFULGENT ENGLAND ONE POINT AWAY FROM CLINCHING SERIES
    > An Italian lead, a tactical subsitution, a result salvaged from
    > absolutely nothing...haven't we seen this script somewhere before?
    >
    > But when Hollywood produces the same formulaic plot and development over
    > and over, we call it trash; when England and Italy produce a friendly
    > concert of variations on a familiar motif, we call it magic. This time,
    > the usual fairy-tale ending attached itself to a conclusive result: two
    > goals in four minutes, the latter coming from Stan Collymore's first
    > touch of the game and 14 minutes from its nailbiting denouement, produced
    > a 2-1 win from England to delight an Anfield crowd pulsing with tension
    > and enthusiasm for the home side.
    >
    > This match took shape, unfortunately, after a sending-off. Puhl, the
    > Hungarian referee, presented a red card to England striker Ian Wright
    > after a mere quarter-hour. Fully deserved though, for Wright's two-footed
    > challenge on Albertini found more flesh than football.
    >
    > England's resiliency, though, has proven its definitive characteristic in
    > this Series, and even a man short they pressed forward in numbers
    > throughout the first 45 minutes. Three times in five minutes they might
    > have led: Apolloni nearly headed into his own goal while clearing
    > Southgate's cross to safety; Adams' wonderfully-taken volley from the
    > subsequent corner was well parried by Marchegiani; Ince's devilish chip
    > from fully 35 yards nearly caught the Italian keeper slumbering, the
    > latter back just in time to collect.
    >
    > Albertini responded at the other end with an audacious header turned over
    > the bar by Seaman just before the interval, and after a vacuous first
    > half-hour the game was well and truly on. In truth, Casiraghi should have
    > finished the work of Roby Baggio just after the break, his frustratingly
    > inconsistent night punctuated by missing the target from an unmissable
    > eight yards.
    >
    > Baggio, Milan's inspiration, made amends for his partner in the 55th
    > minute, producing a goal of incomparable quality. Four deft touches
    > from Minotti, Dino Baggio and Albertini gave him the ball within the
    > center circle, and count the England bodies left in his wake: Ince,
    > Barton, Lee, Adams, and inevitably Seaman. Baggio has never wanted
    > inspiration in his career, and but for flagging resolve around him the
    > match would have belonged to Italy.
    >
    > What could Venables conjure now? With Sinclair on for Adams England now
    > played three at the back yet again, and yet Sacchi falsely deduced that
    > one goal could prove to be enough, bringing on Evani for Signori and
    > again opting for catenaccio over an attempted coup de grace. Brilliantly,
    > Lee found the horizontally sprawling Ferdinand with a cross that was
    > rattled into the woodwork with some velocity; scrappily, with Barnes now
    > on for Anderton and Collymore up front for Ince, a lofted ball from
    > Walker at the back deflected into Ferdinand's path from Minotti, and the
    > Newcastle number nine made no mistake in converting the gift on 72
    > minutes.
    >
    > At 1-1, England were in full flight, and even a half-fit Collymore could
    > benefit from the inertia of his colleagues. Taking a pass from Lee,
    > Collymore attacked into and through Apolloni, with Marchegiani
    > subsequenly beaten low and to his left. How Anfield has taken to
    > Collymore since his first troubled days with Liverpool--and this goal
    > could hardly dampen his already exalted status throughout England
    > football.
    >
    > "I am absolutely thrilled for Stan Collymore," a grinning--and why
    > shouldn't he be?--Venables said after the game. "We didn't think he would
    > be fit to play in this match, and yet he continues to answer England in
    > our hours of need whenever called upon. Quite a story, really."
    >
    > "I'm just glad the gaffer gave me the chance," Collymore said. "I wasn't
    > expecting to play tonight, but one thing led to another, and here we are.
    > You've got the crowd going, and we're playing pretty well, and then to
    > score for England again....it's a lot of fun out there, no doubt."
    >
    > And still the home side surged forward, Sinclair giving Collymore a
    > delicious feed for a strike that was palmed away diligently by
    > Marchegiani. Lee, now all over the field, crossed to Sinclair for a drive
    > that was blocked to Platt, who dinked a lob to Collymore again for a
    > headed attempt into the seats. Baggio ultimatly acquired a booking for
    > his troubles, in injury time for a tackle of Barton--but no further
    > goals. Italy have paid a steep penalty for their inability to finish off
    > the opposition.
    >
    > England (out of 10):
    > Seaman    5
    > D. Walker     8
    > Adams         6  (Sinclair 59, 6)

    I'm extending the deadline for player absences.  I will be
    away from today until the 3rd, but if there are any problems,
    I'll be back before the deadline to take care of them
    
    Have a happy new year!

    ARGH!!!!!!!
    I was on Vacation and actually still am.  I am glad that I found a
    place to log onto.   I will try to get back to everybody.  The reason I
    have not been replying to anyone was because I was on vacation.

    Greetings,
    
      Somebody asked me if I have a policy regarding negotiations during
    retreat/adjustment phases.    I believe that the rule that forbids them
    was originally created to keep FTF games moving at a reasonable pace
    and doesn't matter the same way in PBEM games.   However, since it is
    officially in the rules, I am willing to apply that rule if somebody
    in the game objects to negotiations during those phases.
    
      If you object to negotiations during those phases, please let me
    know and I will ask people not to do so.  Otherwise, you can ignore
    this message and I will assume people don't mind.
    
    - Simon
