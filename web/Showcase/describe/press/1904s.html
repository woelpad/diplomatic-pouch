    I have received no reponse from the judge indicating it had received my
    message. Since I have not received any other message either I assume the
    judge is down. If not could the Master please get in touch with me directly
    through Email.

    I'm extending the deadline in anticipation of sporadic access on
    my part.  Unless you have a need of an extension, please continue
    to play as if there were none.

    My moves are in.  I'm on vacation currently (although I still
    have net access), so I haven't been checking email as freqeuntly.
