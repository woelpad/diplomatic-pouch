    This is a NEW Turkey.  Please do
    NOT assume I have ANY idea what
    the previous Turkey promised.

    I will be out off town from Thurs June 13 until Sunday June 23.  I
    will have no email access from 6/14 - 6/17.  I will have access for some
    or all of 6/18 - 6/23, so after 6/18 I should still be able to check
    email, although I may not be able to engage in very extensive
    negotiations.

    I will be out of town tomorrow so I'm extending the deadline by one
    day since several powers missed deadlines and I won't be around to
    reply to email.

<p><a name=3></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=000000>Master:</font></b><pre>
    I'm going to be out of town from tomorrow until next Thursday.      I'm
    setting the grace period to a week and setting the game unrated so
    that nobody loses dedication points.  This is just in case something
    happens that I'm not around to respond to, but hopefully the game
    will continue to move with regular deadlines.

    Greetings Master,
       I will not be in at least until probably the following Monday  July 1st.

    Bonjours ici Marseilles.
    
    I would like to thank the powers that have written to me during the last two
    weeks. I would like to apologize for most messages that have gone unanswered for
    some unknown reason. In fact my provider has sent me messages which bear
    absolutely no connection with me or even the provider in question and seems to
    have hidden most of my other mail.
    Once again then my most sincere apologies, especially to my neighbours who must
    have felt brushed aside.
    
    Le President de la Republique Francaise.

<p><a name=6></a><b>Broadcast from <font color=000000>Master:</font></b><pre>
    I've reset the grace periods for all phases to their original values
    (72 hours), I've set the game rated again (so that dedication penalties
    are back in effect) and extended the deadline at a player's request.
