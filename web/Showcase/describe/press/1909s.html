    I'm extending the deadline for one player who told me he'd be
    away.  Hopefully the remaining players will get moves in before
    the new deadline.

    I got the date wrong, so I'm extending the deadline to the correct date.

    I will be away from the 8th to the 19th of August both dates included.
    My moves (sorry my move) is already in.

    I'm setting the deadline for an absent player.  Part of the extension
    is also due to my being away for the beginning of next week -- I don't
    want anything to happen in case there are judge problems and I'm not
    around.  However, if everyone gets in moves before the deadline (hint)
    they'll process.

    Just a reminder that any player(s) who have set wait should remove
    that flag once you are sure about your moves to avoid delaying the
    game.
