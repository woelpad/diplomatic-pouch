    Fellow Players,
    
    If things continue as they are going, the game will be over this
    turn.  My orders are already in and I have NOT set wait, so as soon as the
    rest of you put orders in, we can get this done and get fat on Turkey and
    stuffing and watch very important college football games and not have to
    ask for an extension to do so.
    Thanks.
    
    Lord Sheringham

    Here is my EOG statement.
    
    I had fun thru out the game and I never gave up even when it looked like
    I was dead.  Austria came to my rescue first when we were basically at
    war in the begining since Turkey, myself, and Austria could not come to
    agreements on how we could work together.    Turkey was my first ally and
    I stuck with him the whole time until the change of government, and also
    stuck with him then for awhile.  I could not let all of Turkey fall into
    the hands of Austria and Italy.
    
    However, I also got help from England who actually helped my first demise
    with Germany, but then he decided to backstab Germany and help me come
    back.  Unfortunately, he decided that he could not have a 3-way end game
    and decided to go for the solo victory, which Austria warned me about.
    However, I decided that England was a very trustworthy player at that
    point and I felt I understood where he was coming from,  I was wrong and
    unfortunately shortly after that he won the game.
    
    I feel that I may have been able to cause a stalemate with the help of
    Germany and Italy and Austria, but they did not way to they wanted to
    finish the game with at least one supply center for sure (which means
    nothing).  Austria decided this year to attack me because he wanted the
    game to be over before Thanksgiving.  Such is life as a ruler.

    I'm doing this in two parts, since I don't have time to do the
    entire thing.  I had the honour of having just finished playing in a game
    with Dan Shoham, and he sent out a 1,045 line EOG.    Perhaps inspired by
    him, mine will be long, but not THAT long.
    
    So this is Part I:

    >   I must say this is the most unexpected win I've ever had, as

    Greetings to those leaders of the game Describe from the third German
    Ruler.
    
    Taking over a "mercy" position in 1910 can be a difficult thing as
    most alliances have been set, and everyone knows everyone else. But
    it is especially tough when caught between a powerful Russia and
    England, with Austria banging on my heels. My goal for this position
    was not one of winning (no way that would happen, and even a draw was
    questionable), but mearly surviving and my efforts were directed that
    way.
    
    My initial efforts were to court Austria, England and Russia and see
    where I could get the best deal. Austria sent one very non-commital
    press and continued to attack. Russia (who I initially thought I
    wanted to side with sent nothing and continued to support the
    Austrian attack. England basically said "Sure, I'll let you be my
    puppet and I'll let you keep Munich". Puppet is better than death
    given my goal.
    
    This did not stop me from asking Austria or Russia for an alliance
    (and to stop attacking Munich), but got no commitment. But until
    1911, I received no reply.
    
    England offered up an "alliance", with me and the Czar being the
    sharing powers. I knew all along that it was a trap, but hopefully
    did not let on. Eventually, this lead to the recapture of Berlin and
    the big English stab in Scandanavia.
    
    Overall, (and remember all I saw was from 1910 onward), I found
    England to be a strong player, that would listen to me and understood
    my goal. I enjoyed talking strategy with him, and learned a great
    deal. I also enjoyed our short discussions on sports and the like.
    Thanks Grant for all the good times!
    
    -I hardly got to know F before I gave support from Burgundy to help
    eliminate him in Mar.
    
    -Italy seemed like a good player, but once he got stabbed by Russia
    in Turkey, I did not hear from him. His assistance in the Med was
    crucial to E's victory. Vendettas on a Diplomacy board can be a very
    powereful tool, but don't keep it a secret.
    
    -Austria was very good at saying words and not passing any useful
    information. He eventually realized the English victory was going to
    happen and just helped. If I ever meet him again on a Dip board, I
    shall be wary of his words, but will take his advice on the overall
    situation as he does have a good eye for the board.
    
    -Russia is a very complex player that was also difficult to crack.
    Very trusting (which can be good and bad in this game), he bit on the
    prospect held out by England of the 3-way (E/G/R), but given the help
    of Italy in the south, this was probably a false hope. (his stab of
    Italy was good unless Italy completely turned. Unfortunately this is
    what happened). I actually have a great deal of respect for Russia as
    he is honorable, unlike the rest of us scoundrels. I hope to meet him
    again on a board and this time be good "hunting" buddies.
    
    Thanks again everyone. I hope my pickup of the position didn't upset
    the game too badly and was only a logical extension of potential
    German policies and diplomacy.
    
    Thanks again to Simon the GM. Good job and I look forward to more of
    your articles in Dip World. I hope I get to play in another of your
    games sometime or maybe even meet you across the board, but I need to
    practice some first:-).
    
    Time for Travel and Thanksgiving Turkey!

    First off, congrats to Grant for his victory.  In keeping with the level of
    effort that I was able to devote to this game, I'll try to keep this
    commentary short.  With the birth of my first child, a girl, I found my
    Diplomacy time cut to almost nil!
    
    I took over Italy in the early stages, and had to scramble to unravel all
    the threads of alliances and hostilities.  It was apparent that Austria was
    friendly to my predecessor, and he extended that friendship to me.    At that
    time, it was an alliance of opportunity rather than necessity, although that
    was to change.
    
    Never having played Italy, I was unsure of how to maintain the power
    balance, while at the same time looking for expansion possibilities.
    Together with A, I negotiated a pact with T, allowing me turn my efforts to
    Iberia, despite the constant barrage of press from E.  I was able to capture
    Spain, but could not force my way into Marseilles to allow advancement into
    France. E and I exchanged a fair number of meaningless platitudes, while
    continuing to dance around the line drawn in the sand, neither of us gaining
    much ground.
    
    Somewhat later, when Austria suggested that Turkey should be reduced, I
    agreed, not caring for the possibility of being pinned between the witches'
    fleets.  I dispatched a couple of units, and was able to secure Smyrna.
    Austria took Con, and Russia Ankara.  Next came the crucial moment which in
    my opinion allowed E's victory. A & I arranged to trade Serbia for Con, which
    would consolidate both our holdings.  I took Con, giving full explanations
    to Russia that the fleets would rapidly depart Turkey to fight the British.
    You'll have to excuse my bitterness, but I'm still shaking my head at what
    happened next.    Either Russia feared my two fleets could somehow make their
    way to Moscow, or perhaps he figured that I was insincere in my claim that
    those centers were crucial in keeping E out of the Med.     Whatever the
    reason, he cleverly stabbed me for a single center, which denied me a
    desperately needed build, and collapsed my defense against E.
    
    In dispair rather than in retribution, I offered puppethood to England in
    hopes of survival.    Within a year, he accepted that my offer was genuine,
    and the game was reduced to a tactical exercise, at which he succeded admirably.
    
    My only other comment is in voicing my disappoinment with Austria's
    indecision.  I think he tried to befriend everyone, and satisfied noone.
    With the powerful array of armies at his disposal, it was likely that he
    could have seized enough of Russia to form a line, and force an AIE draw.
    Ah, hindsight.  Also, I felt betrayed by his apparent indifference to
    Russia's selfishness and at that point felt justified in realigning myself
    with England.
    
    To me, there was only one winner in this game.    The survival of both Germany
    and Italy is just as significant as the gains made by A & R, and I tip my
    hat to Grant for not having to eliminate his vassals in his bid for victory.
    There is indeed greatness in a name!

    EOG - Austria
    -------------
    Unlike the typical RAT early intrigue that goes on, I was faced
    with the unusual situation of R showing no interest in fighting T.    That
    left me with only to options - ART or AI vs RT.     With 20/20 hindsight on
    R's style of play, I would have gone for the ART.  But at that time, I
    thought R's disinterest in fighting T was a bad sign for me, so I went the
    AI vs RT hoping to sway E and/or G to help us out.    EG came out on top out
    West, so they were perfectly content to let AI vs RT struggle with each
    other.
    Despite that, AI gained the upper hand on T.  And despite G
    becoming hostile to me in the north and F's decline, we had 3 or 4 50/50
    shots at breaking T defense in time to allow Italy to defend the W. Med
    against E and for me to have enough armies to hold off GR and wait for the
    Western alliances to realign after F fell.  Unfortunately, T outguessed AI
    everytime, so AI was forced to make peace with T and defend ourselves
    against GER.
    Conventional wisdom says that an early G vs A war is bad news for
    both, and it proved true.  It forced me to go with an unweildy TAI
    alliance, and while G was putzing around with me (and later he attacked
    R). It left his back wide open, so he got himself royally reamed when E
    stabbed him.
    I knew that TAI would never last long - once T got armies north of
    the Black Sea it was only a matter of time before he would ally with E.
    Plus, I wanted R in my corner, since it was apparent that he was an
    "honest"  player.  I spent a good deal of effort getting G to stab R.
    Then, G's attack on R allowed me to make nice with R and finish off T.
    The rest of the game was spent fighting with E for R's friendship.
    There's nothing like having an ally who will trust you blindly.     R hoped
    for a compromise with an ARE, but it was a hopeless cause, as ARE would
    lead to an English solo (GI were E's puppets by now).  I warned R
    repeatedly, but he wouldn't listen.
    My biggest mistake in the game occured when the 3rd G came in.
    Right before R was about to get some Turk centers, I should have stabbed
    R.    In retrospect, it was the last real chance to stop E.  G at least
    appeared interested in the possibility of him tyring to hit E, while I
    could attack R.     Unfortunately, I just completely missed the opportunity.
    I hadn't looked at the board closely for weeks, and I paid the price.  By
    the time I saw it, it was too late; R was going to get builds off of
    Italy's holdings in Turkey, which would make my attack futile and collapse
    Italy's defense against E.
    I eventually reluctantly went along with RAE, since E was breaking
    into the Med, thanks to the Russian attack on Italy's Turkish possesions.
    So out of desperation I hoped to get Italy's centers before E did,
    although it was a hopeless effort.  Not content with being fooled into
    thinking E wouldn't win in an ARE allinace, R then decided to go for an ER
    alliance and attack me.
    E finally stabbed R, and IG were uninterested in making a last
    stand against E.  So, I attacked R to get this game over with and to grub
    for centers.
    
    England:  An excellently played game.  He dominated the diplomacy in this
    game from start to finish.    I always felt like he was one step ahead of me
    everywhere.
    
    France:     He ended up the odd man out of the Western triangle, didn't
    really get to do much.
    
    Germany 1:  Got himself in central European wars without watching his
    back, and paid the price.
    
    Germany 2,3:  By the time they came in, there roles were being defined by
    the larger powers.  I misplayed my dealings with them badly, especially
    the 3rd German, by not finding them an alternative to serving E.
    
    Italy 1,2:  I don't feel they ever really got going, as theirs roles were
    defined for most of the game by fighting T then trying to defend the
    Western med.
    
    Turkey1:  It was readily apparent he was a good player.     However, he never
    got going when the early alliances went against him.
    
    Turkey2,3:    Things were getting too messy to my North to allow T to
    develop, so I wanted him eliminated.
    
    Russia:     An honest player who didn't stab.  I based a lot of my play on
    this by courting him heavily for an alliance once I realized how he
    played.  However, E's stronger ties with R, combined with R's lack of
    respect for tatical and strategic considerations, contributed a lot to the
    English win.
    
    Austria:  Once school started, I didn't have much time to spend on
    Diplomacy.    Often times I was in "auto-pilot," not really looking for new
    strategies or tactics. I blew what turned out to be the best chance to
    stop E by not stabbing R.  While R was directly responsible for E winning
    by attacking Italy, the ultimate responsibility was mine for allowing to
    reach that point.

    Here is the second part of my EOG.    I'm sorry that it's so long,

    Second EOG
    
     I feel that I must put out another EOG.   This is more to explain my
    way of playing.     Unfortunately, from the beginning nothing really had
    gone my way except my alliance with the first Turkish player.  As a
    Russian player diplomacy is the most important part of the game.  This is
    because you start out fighting a possible four front war, and four and
    hopefully six units after the first year could not support something like
    that.
      In a way I feel lucky to still be alive at end game, because I was
    sure that I was going to be destroyed after I went down in units.  Yes, I
    am an honest player or at least as much as a diplomacy player can be.
    When I felt like I was allied with players and I was going to attack them
    I would warn them first.  In most games this is at a time when it would
    not matter what they do.   In this game I knew that I could not
    completely trust either Austria or England and I knew that they were
    mortal enemies or at least appeared to be.    I had to constantly try to
    appease both of them as to why I would not attack the other.  One of the
    reasons is because I knew that if I attacked one the other would probably
    come from behind.  This is why I never played a tactical game in this one
    because I always had two fronts and if I left one too open I was
    history.   At the end I felt like I had to make a decision (more from
    England then from Austria, but from him as well) of am I going to be
    England's ally or Austria's ally.    I knew tactically that England would
    be able to take me out much faster then Austria would have been able to,
    so I decided to jump in heads first and hope that it was deep water and
    not very cloudy dark shallow water.     Well i informed Austria that I would
    be attacking him and gave him one turn to prepare for it.    When I
    positioned my units in that area, England made his move.  At this point I
    knew there was nothing I could do, my units in the North would get
    crushed and unless I could get the rest of the countries to stand against
    England he would win.  I prefer playing a tactical/Strategic game
    however, I never could get myself in a position to play that way and this
    was because I could not bring myself to fully trust either Austria or
    England.   From the EOG's of them I feel it was good that I was playing
    that way.  However, their EOG's also proved that no matter what I did I
    was not going to win.
    It was a good game,     I think that both England and Austria were good
    tacticians even though Austria did not get much of a chance to show it as
    well.  Engand's Diplomacy was good in such that he was able to talk in
    such a way as the other player would understand.  Which is why I decided
    to attack Austria, even though I was pretty sure that England would
    attack me.  However, during the whole time I had to constantly say that
    he would never attack me, which was to give my attacking Austria
    backing.  All in all it was a well played game and I wish that I could
    have come out better.

    Congratulations to England for a game well-played, and thanks to
    everyone for participating in my experiment to capture Diplomacy
    strategy and rationale as the game is played out.  I appreciate
    everyone's having taken the extra time to provide information
    which hopefully will be of use to others.
    
    Now that the three showcase games are over, I'll have to get my
    act together and put everything up on the web.  Hopefully it
    won't take too long.
    
    Thanks again.  Here's the game summary:
