    I've had somebody request that I say something about conducting
    diplomacy after the deadline.  Intentionally missing a deadline
    so that you can continue to conduct negotiations is not allowed.
    The only time you may negotiate after a deadline has passed is
    if moves have been submitted for all your units and it is
    somebody else who is late.
    
    Thanks.

    Whoops!  I hope it wasnt me.  I have a tendency to answer my email
    one at a time and write letters before seeing that I am late.  If
    it was me, then I am sorry and I will be more careful next time.

    Greetings,
    
      I received a couple of messages from players regarding my last
    message about Diplomacy after deadlines (or rather intentionally
    missing deadlines to extend negotiation periods).  I was not
    threatening to throw anyone out of the game, nor was I pointing
    fingers at anyone in particular.  It just happens that somebody
    had previously complained about the pace of the game, then came a
    missed deadline with more than half of the players late, followed
    by a message from a player about Diplomacy after deadlines.  So,
    I broadcast a message about that policy to discourage the practice
    and keep the game moving along.
    
      Sorry if I sounded threatening; it was not my intention.

    Oh dear it might have been me! Actually I had four wrong set of moves this time!
    Now why can#t the judge send back moves details it can understand? I keep
    copying the judge confirmation omitting to take off the France in fornt or
    stupid thigs like that.
    
    Note to master: I will be posting my description of my thoughts and moves as
    soon as I get back to using my main computer where they are stored.

    I'm extending the deadline to tomorrow night because of the judge
    slowdown which may cause moves submitted on time to be received
    late.
