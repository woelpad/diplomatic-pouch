    Considering how the judge has experienced some downtime recently,
    would anyone object to a deadline extension?

    Austria asked:
    
    >   Considering how the judge has experienced some downtime recently,
    >would anyone object to a deadline extension?
    
    followed shortly after by:
    
    >Diplomacy game 'describe' is waiting for Austria's orders.
    >Diplomacy game 'describe' is waiting for Russia's orders.
    >Diplomacy game 'describe' is waiting for France's orders.
    >Diplomacy game 'describe' is waiting for Turkey's orders.
    
    I'll take that as a resounding "no" regarding objections.
