<br>The spring and fall links with the (very small) diplomacy map icons are
linked to color images of the mapboard as it would look following the turn.	 The
supply centers are colored according to owner and the (sometimes difficult to find) 
units are placed in their appropriate locations.

<p><a name="results"></a><center><img src="Common/resultslogo.gif"> <b>Orders and Results</b> <img src="Common/resultslogo.gif"></center>
<br>The results icon for each season is linked to the orders and results for each
turn.  Spring movement and spring retreat are grouped together as are fall movement,
fall retreat, and winter adjustment.

<p><a name="press"></a><center><img src="Common/presslogo.gif"> <b>Press</b> <img src="Common/presslogo.gif"></center>
<br>All the game's broadcasts can be accessed through the press links.	Press is
grouped according to the season during which it was sent.

<p><a name="analysis"></a><center><img src="Common/analysislogo.gif"> <b>Player Analysis</b> <img src="Common/analysislogo.gif"></center>
<br>Some games will have analysis links for each turn.	Those that do were run with
the players having been instructed to provide additional information each turn.	 Sometimes
they were better about doing so than others.  What they did submit can be found attached
to the analysis icons.
