<center><h4>What is the Auxiliary Window?</h4></center>

<p>In an effort to present the large amount of data that constitutes a 
Diplomacy game in an orderly fashion, the showcase section makes use of
an additional browser window to cut down on backtracking during browsing.
The auxiliary window will be used to display maps, press, and other text
while the main browser window displays a well-ordered representation of 
the available data.

<center>
<p><h4>What if only one window will fit on my screen?
<br>What if I hate browsers opening more windows?
<br>What if I have an old or nonstandard browser?</h4>
</center>

<p>You can opt not to use the auxiliary window by leaving the selector
at the top of the game view page (be it summary, full, or detailed) on
<tt>Don't use Auxiliary window</tt>, the default.  If you are using
a version of Netscape Navigator earlier than 2.01 or a version of 
Microsoft Internet Explorer earlier than 3.0 the auxiliary window
will not work.

<p>However, if you're opting not to use the auxiliary window because
you've had bad experiences with frames and multiple windows at other
web sites, we would like to request that you give the showcase section
auxiliary window a try.	 Every effort has been made to ensure that it
exhibit no untoward behavior.  More than one auxiliary window will never
appear, and browsing to any other page with the main window will remove
the auxiliary window.

<p><center><h4>A note to Microsoft Internet Explorer v3.x users:</h4></center>

<p>Due to an unfortunate error in the Javascript implementation in 
Microsoft Internet Explorer version 3.x the closing of the auxiliary
window will cause an error dialog to be displayed.	This error message is
in error itself.  The closing will be performed correctly, and the error
can be ignored.	 You might want to consider upgrading to a newer version
of Netscape Navigator or Microsoft Internet Explorer, preferably the former.
