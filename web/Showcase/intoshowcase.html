    <p><b>How can I get my game into the showcase?</b></p>

    <p>As the head of the showcase section (ok, as the only person working
      on the showcase section), I get quite a few requests to put game X on
      judge Y into the showcase section.  Often, I'm not nearly so quick to
      reply to these requests as good ettiquette would dictate, but when I do 
      get around to doing so the answer is almost always a qualified yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The qualification being that the data be presented in a fashion which I
      can turn into a showcase fairly quickly.  Depending on
      the data construction of a showcase can take anywhere from 6 to 30 
      hours.  I like 6 hour showcases.  Below I'll go into detail on what
      can be done to make a game easy to showcase, but in general it's 
      <b>consistancy</b>.
    </p>
    <p>I have no problem with the idea of a 30 game showcase section.  If 
      need be I'll start rating them by quality, providing reviews, and
      writing summaries.  None of that has seemed necessary with the few
      games that are in there now, but it's not an objectionable situation.
    </p>

    <p><b>What can I do to expidite the creation of a showcase?</b></p>

    <dl>
      <dt><i>Keep your data consistant.</i></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>This is no single thing you can do to make my life easier than
	  keeping your game data consistant.  The reason this is so helpful
	  is because I usually use a collection of Perl scripts to massage
	  the data into a presentable form and every exception in the data 
	  means I have to add another clause to my parsing scripts.  
	</p>
	<p>By consistancy I mean consistancy of format.  Don't send
	  three files that contain all the press each in a different format
	  because the GM switched mailers three times.  Don't have 1/2 the
	  messages wrapped in judge headers/footers and the rest without.
	  Don't send me broadcasts in one file and press in another.
	</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Don't be afraid of big files.</i></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>
	  Often people send me many files related to the same game, and it
	  almost always results in a loss of chronological information.  
	  When you separate press into one file and orders into another it
	  becomes necessary to collate them by message timestamp just to 
	  tell which messages happened before and after each set of results.
	  <i>Ideally results, partial-press, results, and broadcasts will all
	    be in one huge file.  I love huge files.
	  </i>
	</p>
      </dd>
      <dt><i>Don't send me overlapping data.</i></dt>
      <dd>
	<p>Don't sent duplicate data.  There are few things than can cause 
	  me to throw up my hands in surrender on a showcase than realizing
	  that the fall 1905 results are in a file twice.  It leaves me 
	  suspect of all the other data, and forces me to keep alert for 
	  other duplications.
	</p>
      </dd>
    </dl>
    
    <p>
      <b>But my data doesn't conform to your rediculously strict requirements.
	What can I do?
      </b>
    </p>
    
    <p>You can help me to put it into the consistant format I'll need.  That
      means delete any duplicate messages.  Combine messages into the same
      mail folder before you send them to me (after removing any non-related
      mail). Little things like that can go a long way.  
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>What if my data is really non-standard, though (postal, non-judge)?
      </b>
    </p>

    <p>Well, we can see about working something out.  Currently the Showcase
      has nothing but judge games because it's so easy for me to generate 
      maps for them, and because their overall consistancy of format makes
      it easy to strip personal email addresses and things like that. Still,
      the Pouch aims to be medium neutral, and I would really like to have
      a Cat-23 game in there or maybe even a postal game.  I would be 
      willing to (slowly) do more work to get a good game in.  If you've got
      a good candidate, let me know and we'll talk.
