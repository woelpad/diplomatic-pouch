<P>Dear Rick,</P>

<P> I could try something fancy
this season and move F(ION)-ADR, F(TYS)-ION. However I would look pretty
stupid if this was the season when Austria actually attacked me and I ended
up losing Greece... In some respects I hope that Austria orders a supported
attack into Tyrolia, standing me out --- leaving Piedmont is slightly risky
as Italy has the worrying option of occupying it, but this probably wouldn't
go anywere as France would capture Mar before Italy could threaten one
of my Italian centers. </P>

<P>Let me go on record for one last time --- I never
wanted to attack Austria. I am only attacking Austria now as a direct result
of their foreign policy. It will be interesting to see if Russia comes
off the fence once I start to pound Austria. I'm saddened that my westerly
fleets policy has come to an end. Still, F(MAO) could prove to be a very
useful piece latter on in the game! </P>
<P>Mark.</P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>I originally intended building
F(Smy). However I decided that in the long term F(BLA) and A(Arm) is a
better setup than F(BLA) and F(Arm), two northern fleets aren't constructive
and it would take too long to move one westwards. Next season will finally
see F(Con) moving out of port. Mark. </P>
