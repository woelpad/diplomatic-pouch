<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>France should try to recapture
Bre (I would laugh if England and France stood each other out!), to move
to Marseille would be very short sighted! A rogue Italian army has the
potential to tie down several Turkish units, halting the movement westwards
and giving France time to set up a stalemate line with England.</P>

<P> England
is facing a tricky few years, with the losses of both Liverpool and Edinburgh
he will only be able to build in London, hampering him in the construction
of a stalemate line. In the south the fact that this is a no-press gunboat
game greatly hinders co-operation between Austria/Italy/Russia and therefore
increases my chances. The presence of FA(Sil) helps me, there is virtually
no chance that England will leave Berlin undefended, so Germany has nothing
to lose by moving to Warsaw.</P>

<P> I could spend a considerable amount of time
discussing this position, but I want these orders to arrive on time!</P>

<P> Mark.</P>

<P> Dear Rick,</P>
<P> Last season went well. The
order F(ENC)-Lon was a surprise, I don't think it was the best for that
unit. England is beginning to set up a commanding position in the German
hinterlands, but the south is open and it's a race to the Straits of Gibraltar!
This may be the last fleet that I build; with F(Smy)-AEG and F(ADR)-ION
(but perhaps not next season) I will be to move Turkish armies more rapidly
to the front.</P>
<P> One reason why it is difficult to convert winning positions
to won for Turkey is the distance from the Turkish home lands to the stalemate
line, no power has it so bad! Another piece of luck --- Italy should have
taken a chance and ordered A(Pie)-Tus; Italy has to trust that France realises
that it's not in his interest to capture Mar. If all goes well next season
should see the elimination of Austria. </P>
<P>Mark.
