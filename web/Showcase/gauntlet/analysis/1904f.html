<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P>Austrian paranora reaches rampant levels and forces me to turn my
attention in that direction. I can see the A/R/T tangle being a
stalemate for sometime to come, but this season the Austrian A(Vie) is
out of position and Russia can take Rumania if he so desires --- I'll
be throwing in a support for A(Ukr)-Rum. If Russia then decides to
return the favour we could run a nice juggernaut against Austria. If
Russia doesn't join in then it appears that we have a stand-off, my
holdings in Italy are vulnerable in the longrun. I may have chances of
capturing Marseilles for a build this year. We will have to wait and
see! 

<P>Mark.</P>
