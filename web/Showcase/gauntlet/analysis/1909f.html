Analysis for Fall of 1909 in gauntlet

<P> Dear Rick, </P>

<P>I will be away from Thursday
17th to Thursday 24th. England has started to send the signals out, so
it should be me vs The Rest of the World from here in --- I hope I don't
blow it!</P>

<P> My biggest decision this season was what to do with F(IRI). If
I hold or order to either Clydside or Liverpool then I retain good chances
of keeping Liverpool. On the other hand if I order to ENG I might entice
Germany to retreat the dislodged F(Edi) to Cly, followed by disbanding
A(Mun). More importantly I intend to blitzkrieg France and F(ENC) is more
important from that perspective. I guess England will convoy A(Nor)-Edi
and build F(ENC). If he dislodges me from ENC in Spring 1910 then I may
be able to retreat to Bre.</P>

<P> Strategicaly A(Tyr) SA(Tri)-Vie is better, but
I want to ensure that Vienna falls this season --- I don't want Austria
to retain Vienna because Germany decided that A(Mun)-Ruhr was called for.
Russia should take the hint and order A(StP)-Lvn this season --- it makes
things much harder for me.</P>

<P> Winning will come down to either taking Munich
or one of the French centers. It's going to take me two seasons to push
F(ION)-TYS-LYO. Hopefully I will then have three fleets adjacent to Spa,
an army adjacent to Mar and two armies adjacent to Munich. The pressure
will then mount up on FA(Bur) --- EA(Bel)-Ruh looks obvious so I may need
three armies adjacent to Munich. Since the critical season is Autumn I
have, in effect, three movement seasons to achieve all this. It should
be possible.</P>
<P> I won't win in four seasons, I won't have mopped War/Mos/Sev
up by then, but if I can take the `18th' centre by then F/E will be under
intense pressure. I will laugh and laugh if I dislodge AA(Gal) this season
and it retreats to War... but that is very unlikely. I suppose Russia would
disband A(StP), not necessarily to my advantage... but in a no-press game
it is harder to co-ordinate two nationalities.</P>
<P> Mark.

<P> Dear Rick, </P>

<P>Thanks for extending the deadline
(I must have forgot to tell you that I was going to be away!). Apologies
for not submitting by the end of the extension --- I had a really bad headache
and spent most of yesterday afternoon/evening in bed. </P>

<P>
A(Con) was an easy
build. The second build wasn't so easy --- I couldn't see if a fleet or
army was required. It's a long way from Turkey to the western battle grounds
and F's(AEG,ION) would speed up movement. In the end I decided that I can
effectively move units to the front by shuffling my eastern armies around
--- Bul to Rum, Rum to Gal, Gal to Sil etc. Additionally I'm thinking of
moving in force against Munich this year, if I build only one army I might
be stretched &quot;like too little butter over too much bread&quot; (to
quote Bilbo) in the east.</P>

<P> My strategic thinking is to force Munich and then use A(Mun)-Bur
to cut French support for Mar. I can pick up War/Mos/Sev at my
lesuire, breaking France open looks the best way to win. It was
interesting that Germany didn't retreat to Cly, I would have been
happy for him to take Lpl. Also the move A(mun)-Bur was
interesting. Perhaps Germany has decided to do what it can to help me
out?</P> 
<P>Mark.
