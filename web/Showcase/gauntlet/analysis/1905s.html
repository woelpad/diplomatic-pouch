<P> Dear Rick,</P>

<P>Nothing to report. If Russia moves against Austria then he will take
Rumania this season, and we will be able to start a Juggernaut;
pushing Austria back province by province.  Since I already have units
positioned behind Austria in Italy this slow retreat will quickly
collapse into a rout. If Russia doesn't move against Austria then the
ART positions will be a standoff for a very long time.  I have some
attacking chances, but I'm going to play a waiting game this year and
offer Russia a helping hand. </P>

<P>With the Italian disbandment of A(Pie)
F(GoL) is out-of-place. I doubt that anyone would offer me support
into Mar, so I am moving to take control of Gibralter. There is a
faint chance that the presence of the rogue Italian fleet may distract
England sufficiently to allow me to secure MAO. With only two fleets I
can't go anywhere from there, but it's a good base. </P>

<P>Apologies for the lateness, especially as I'd worked my orders out
a few days ago.</P>

 <P>Mark.</P>
