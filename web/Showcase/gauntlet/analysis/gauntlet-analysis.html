<P>
   I haven't played this vt before, but I am convinced that the
correct opening strategy is to capture your hsc as quickly as possible.
Furthermore you should capture the center that is nearest to your
starting center so that you continue to expand outwards.  Playing
Austria I would go for Vie, England Lpl, France Paris, Germany Berlin,
Italy Rome, Russia Moscow and Turkey Con.</P>

<P>
   The Austrian move to Ser is worrying, but it could be a brilliant
double-bluff.  In this position I would order A(Ser)-Bud, hoping to entice
Turkey into moving into Bul.  We shall see!
</P>

<P>
   I agree with the opening moves used for F/I/R and, naturally, T.
Although I believe that F should go for Paris I think it's best to order
to Gas, because then your opponents can't be certain about what you are
aiming for.

Turkey to Master in 'gauntlet':</P>

<P> Dear Rick,</P>
<P> Since my last comment on this
game everything has gone as well as possible. Italy moved west, and I followed
his lead. Although my position looks good with fleets in ION and AEG, in
the short term I may not make much progress. Italy will take two centers
this turn, lose Naples, and, assuming that Austria doesn't take Venice,
will be building one. If Italy were to order A(Pie)-Ven and build A(Rom)
then he would have good chances of retaking Naples next year. However he
can only recapture Naples by withdrawing from his engagement in France,
so France should be able to recapture the centers that he will lose this
year. So in the long term Italy should steadily lose centers. and my control
over ION should be sufficient to ensure expansion. Of course if Italy doesn't
order to Venice and Austria does, then Italy won't be building anything
and he'll be in serious problems. If I were Austria I wouldn't order to
Venice, sure I gain a center but it helps Turkey too much. </P>

<P>If I were Austria
I'd want to concentrate everything on Russia and leave F/I/T to fight it
out; Austria is unlikely to gain more than one center in Italy and she
can gain that center at any time. Interesting situation in Ukr this time.
Does Russia standoff or support one of his units in or hold? If Austria
suspects either of the first two options then he should order either A(Gal)-War
or A(Rum)-Sev in conjunction with a support order of the approriate Russian
unit into Ukr. If Austria gains Sev, then I will be worried about a Russian
retreat to Arm. As long as Austria stays away from Alb then I am happy
with my position. Gre/Bul are secure and I have hopes of expanding westwards.
I'll have an interesting build in Winter: the relative merits of Army/Fleet
are balanced, it all depends on the adjudication... Mark. </P>

<P> 
Dear Rick, </P>
<P>My main decision this season
was what to order with the fleets. The options were (a) F(ION)-TYS, F(AEG)-ION,
(b) F(ION)-Nap, F(AEG)-ION, (c) F(ION)-Tun, F(AEG)-ION. If Italy holds
or orders to ION, the latter being the most likely move, then option (a)
is best. If Italy orders to TYS (unlikely) then option (c) takes the center.
However the order to Tun is a long shot and doesn't do anything for me
if it fails. My option is probably not the best, but it's safe. I'm guaranteed
to make steady progress over the next year-or-so. </P>
<P>
What will Austria order
with A(Tri)? It is very tempting to order support for IA(Pie)-Ven, there
are no hard alliances in no-press gunboat and slowing my progress is good
for Austria. If this were regular I could bring diplomatic pressure to
bear on this point, but it isn't so I can't. Austria may be worried that
I will order a supported attack on Serbia, in which case I would take Serbia
if he supported the Italians. At this stage in the game I don't want to
do anything that would alienate Austria, I want to concentrate on westwards
expansion; no two-front war! </P>

<P>The Russian move to Lvn is difficult to understand,
the only rational explanation being that Russia expected England to be
in a position to make a supported attack on StP and wanted an uncutable
support. Ordering to Mos would have been better, I guess Russia was relying
on being able to outguess Austria. Although I would rather build a westwards
unit this season I am going to have to build a unit to move into Armenia
--- assuming that RA(Sev) doesn't retreat to Armenia --- I need to block
Armenia to ensure that Austria doesn't get any ideas about a back-door
entry.</P>

<P> With France collapsing so quickly I am slightly worried so I won't
be able to secure Gibralter before England sails through. With Italy keeping
F(Tun) it mak take me three seasons to capture Tun. At the moment it is
fortunate that England is only building one and doesn't have any southern
units except F(ENC). Hopefully he will not capture Breast this season and
in any case he has to decide if he is going to stab Germany. An E/G war
would be music to my ears. If E/G were to ally then they would have a good
chance of being able to break across the main west-east stalemate line
--- England could push fleets through Gibralter before I could reach it
and Germany could push armies into Austria. In a no-press game this is
unlikely. I don't have a palantir so I can not see too far into the future.
If England doesn't stab Germany then I can see the possibility that this
game will end in a dull four-way draw. Austria may be able to stab for
Bul/Gre but his lack of fleet power would mean that anything would be suicide
(unless Germany were to stab England at the same time, then it might be
a race to 18). If I were to stab Austria I may find Germany rushing through
into Russia and Austria. My best chance appears to be if England is slow
in moving southwards and I am able to take control of the Med. If I were
able to take 3 Iberian centers I might be in a positionn for a war against
Austria. But that's a long way in the future and the picture is fuzzy.</P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>

<P>The main decision was to order
in Ank. I need to push a unit into Armenia this Spring. This prevents Russia
retreating there should Austria outguess him, and should Austria outguess
him it denies Austria the backstab to Syria. In the long term I am obviously
thinking about the possibility of attacking Austria via the orders F(XXX)-BLA
and A(xxx)-Syr, the question is what is the best way of doing this. </P>

<UL>
<LI>Option
1. Build A(Ank), push it to Arm and build F(Con) at a latter date with
the idea of F(Con)-BLA. 
<LI>Option 2. Build F(Ank), push it to Arm and then
build A(Smy) at a latter date with the idea F(Arm)-BLA and A(Smy)-Arm.
</UL>

<P>
I think option 2 is more sneaky. In option 1 Austria may wonder why I have
built F(Con) as opposed to F(Smy). In option 2 Austria will assume I am
going for a westwards convoy and miss the possibility of pushing the army
into Arm. So two fleets this season. I had originally intended to move
westwards towards the straits of Gibralter, but having looked at the position
I am seriously considering the stab on Austria this season. I'll explain
my reasons in my next commentary (I hope you are keeping my comments to
run as an EGS at the end of game?). Austria had a 100% of taking an Austrian
center this season, but decided togo for the 50% option and got it wrong.
I don't understand that. Russia has moved to Mos --- he should have ordered
there last season.</P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>

<P> Apologies for the lateness
of my orders. As usual I left sending the orders until the last moment,
only to find myself being wined and dinned by captains of industry (well
one, to be exact) on wednesday evening. I don't get invited out for meals
at somebody else's expense very often... </P>

<P>
When I looked at the position
before the Winter adjudication I assumed that Italy would keep F(Tun) and
disband A(Pie). I then decided that I would attack Austria with A(Rom)-Ven
and A(Ven)-Tyr. After the Italian builds I decided not to attack him. </P>

<P> With correct play every game should finish in a draw, but I can
see how most powers can win with poor play. Even with poor play I have
never understood how Turkey can win, it's such a long way to the 18th
center. With a strong England and a strong Germany I can't see any way
of winning --- they sit on the stalemate line and even in a gunboat
game they have plenty of time to sort out their orders. </P>

<P>
I'm going to
move westwards and see what happens.  I can envisage this game
petering out into a 4-way draw, depending upon what E/G do. There's a
small chance that I might be able to break through Gibralter and onto
the other side of the stalemate line, but it's very unlikely. </P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>
Moved house today. Went to my new local this evening. Didn't drink too
much but I didn't have any tea, so I am not feeling in a mood to
comment excessively on the game...  </P>

<P>
Austria's paranoria and rampant
anti-Turkish orders are understandable, he must have thought that I
was intending F(Ank)-BLA to pressurise Rum in conjunction with
A(Ven)-Tyr and A(Rom)-Ven. His defensive orders have given Russia
breathing space, which is good --- although I have no intention at the
moment of stabbing Austria I don't want hime gaining units with
increased defensive possibilities. Hopefully he will note that I
didn't make any anti-Austrian moves last season and return to a more
reasonable position. </P>

<P>As I see it Austria only has two options. He
either engages in anti-Turkish maneouvers or he takes a risk and
orders northwards, if I don't stab him he will gain builds; however
his lack of fleets means that he will never become the major partner
in a AT alliance. At the moment my strategy remains to move
west. However, if Austria continues with anti-T moves next season I
will consider F(ION)-ADR and the stab. I'm not particularly keen on
this, because the prospect of a E-G war opens up the possibility of
breaking through into MAO. </P>

<P>The F-I position is interesting. They are
both playing to occupy Spa and Por and in the absence of external
factors this should reduce to a 50-50 guess for each player. </P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P>Austrian paranora reaches rampant levels and forces me to turn my
attention in that direction. I can see the A/R/T tangle being a
stalemate for sometime to come, but this season the Austrian A(Vie) is
out of position and Russia can take Rumania if he so desires --- I'll
be throwing in a support for A(Ukr)-Rum. If Russia then decides to
return the favour we could run a nice juggernaut against Austria. If
Russia doesn't join in then it appears that we have a stand-off, my
holdings in Italy are vulnerable in the longrun. I may have chances of
capturing Marseilles for a build this year. We will have to wait and
see!

<P> Dear Rick,</P>

<P>Nothing to report. If Russia moves against Austria then he will take
Rumania this season, and we will be able to start a Juggernaut;
pushing Austria back province by province.  Since I already have units
positioned behind Austria in Italy this slow retreat will quickly
collapse into a rout. If Russia doesn't move against Austria then the
ART positions will be a standoff for a very long time.  I have some
attacking chances, but I'm going to play a waiting game this year and
offer Russia a helping hand. </P>

<P>With the Italian disbandment of A(Pie)
F(GoL) is out-of-place. I doubt that anyone would offer me support
into Mar, so I am moving to take control of Gibralter. There is a
faint chance that the presence of the rogue Italian fleet may distract
England sufficiently to allow me to secure MAO. With only two fleets I
can't go anywhere from there, but it's a good base. </P>

<P>Apologies for the lateness, especially as I'd worked my orders out
a few days ago.</P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>

<P>The Turkish position could go critical if Russia sides with
Austria. If Austria takes Munich (which is open this season), then he
should be able to force his way into Pie/Tyr and then capture
Venice. In order to move aggressively against Austria I either need
Russia on my side or another unit, but a build from my western fleets
is unlikely. We shall have to wait and see.</P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>

<P>I am away from 10th July to the 17th. 

<P>The Italian player has been most
annoying! If he had been sensible and stayed in Marseilles then I
would have been happy to support him into Spain... hoping to split
Spain and Portugal 50-50 between us.  As it is I have decided to
admitt that my westerly fleets strategy was mistaken. England is too
strong, I can't make any progress against him.  The only chance I have
to pick up a center is if England were to support me into Bre. So I am
sending F(Wes) back east. </P>

<P>In a regular game of diplomacy I could
co-operate with Germany.  If I were to push into IRI then England would
have a 50-50 guess, should he stay in Liverpool or cover Edi? In
no-press Gunboat if he orders A(Lpl)-Edi the likely result would be a
standoff, since there is no way for G/T to decide which center to
attack. The move to Pie is risky because in the future an order
A(Mar)-Pie could cut vital support. However if I don't order to Pie
Austria can force Venice eventually, support into Tyr and then slip
into Pie, resulting in A's(Pie,Tyr,Tri).</P>  <P>Mark.</P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>

<P> I could try something fancy
this season and move F(ION)-ADR, F(TYS)-ION. However I would look pretty
stupid if this was the season when Austria actually attacked me and I ended
up losing Greece... In some respects I hope that Austria orders a supported
attack into Tyrolia, standing me out --- leaving Piedmont is slightly risky
as Italy has the worrying option of occupying it, but this probably wouldn't
go anywere as France would capture Mar before Italy could threaten one
of my Italian centers. </P>

<P>Let me go on record for one last time --- I never
wanted to attack Austria. I am only attacking Austria now as a direct result
of their foreign policy. It will be interesting to see if Russia comes
off the fence once I start to pound Austria. I'm saddened that my westerly
fleets policy has come to an end. Still, F(MAO) could prove to be a very
useful piece latter on in the game! </P>

<P>I originally intended building

<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>The best feature of my position
is my fleet in the west. It's behind the main stalemate line and has the
potential to offer me all kinds of exciting possibilities latter on in
the game. I've got to keep that fleet on the board as long as possible.
Conversely England has to destroy that fleet as quickly as possible. Hence
the move to MAO, with the idea of preventing F(NTH)SF(Lon)-ENC and F(ENC)-MAO
when not only does Bre fall, but F(Bre) is beginning to run out of retreat
locations. I'm not too bothered about hanging onto Bre, hanging onto that
fleet is more important.</P>
<P> In the east we have the set of orders which I
have been working towards for several season. I don't expect to hold onto
Trieste, but I free my position up and I should be able to force Trieste
in the long run. There are various things which could happen, depending
upon how Austria orders; I hope I have everything covered! 

<P>The most `interesting'
option (least desirable!) would be AA(Rum)SA(Ser)-Bul, A(Alb)-Gre, which could
see me in Ser and Austria in Bul and Greece! That shouldn't be too bad,
I think I can recapture everything.</P> 

<P>Having said that F(Bre) is my best unit, if I have to disband this
year (a distinct possibility, there is no sure gain from Austria) that
may be the one. Having said that there is sure gain from Austria, I
think that A(Tyr)-Vie, A(Ven)-Tri is a stronger set of moves this
season, if Austria holds/supports in the south. However there are
potential problems if Italy has to retreat A(Mar) this season, and the
orders don't appear any stronger if Austria orders something like
A(Gal)-Vie, A(Ser)-Bud, A(Alb)-Ser which may be his best set of
defensive orders. I don't know what's going to happen...</P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P> Once again my orders are late
(this is becoming standard, sorry!), unfortunately this time they are late
by almost a week. All I can say is that I have been exceptionally busy
this week, preparing for a visit to the Newton Institute in Cambridge next
week. I wish I could say that it won't happen again...</P>
<P> Onto my orders.
In the south it looks like a guessing game. I couldn't find any way to
guarantee taking an Austrian centre, for any set of orders that takes a
centre there is an appropriate set of defensive orders. However, I believe
that I can force Sev --- AA(Rum) is almost certainly NOT going to support
RA(Sev). If I capture Sev I believe that Russia will disband A(Fin). England
will then capture StP the following year. I'd rather forgo Sev (giving
Russia time to booster his defense with A(War)-Ukr) then allow England
to capture StP so quickly. </P>

<P>
The obvious orders for Austria are either A(Vie,Bud,Ser)
SA(Alb)-Tri, or A(Vie,Bud)SA(Ser)-Tri with A(Alb,Bud) defending Ser in
some manner. Since I'm not guaranteed taking a center, I'll order F(MAO)-Bre,
hoping that England/France don't co-ordinate and take Bre. The best resolution
for me would be a standoff, leaving me in MAO. </P>

Austria chose an obvious choice of orders, I could have taken two of his
centres if I'd outguessed him. I manage to keep Bre for another year, and
more importantly keep F(MAO). England didn't build, even better. My chances
of winning are better now then for several years, but it might depend upon
getting a second fleet behind the stalemate line. I need to move F(ION)

<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P> The convoy to Albania sets me
up very nicely, with four units adjacent to Trieste Austria will soon fall
over. If Austria outguess me this season and combines an order to Albania
with a supported attack into Trieste he will have ordered exceptionally
well! I could use A(Ser) to support into Tri, but I'd rather not get in
this season --- F(Tri) is not a constructive unit. (The problem with ordering
A(Ven)-Tyr is that a retreat to Tyrolia is annoying.)</P>

<P> Russia has to guess
is he should Sev or Rum, maybe I'll guess right here. I originally intended
ordering F(MAO)-Bre for the next two seasons, but worried that France/England
might combine and get it right. Instead I'll try to sneak into Liverpool.
Hopefully this may even stop England from building. (A couple of English
armies might make all the difference, it could all end up depending upon
Munich.)</P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>France should try to recapture
Bre (I would laugh if England and France stood each other out!), to move
to Marseille would be very short sighted! A rogue Italian army has the
potential to tie down several Turkish units, halting the movement westwards
and giving France time to set up a stalemate line with England.</P>

<P> England
is facing a tricky few years, with the losses of both Liverpool and Edinburgh
he will only be able to build in London, hampering him in the construction
of a stalemate line. In the south the fact that this is a no-press gunboat
game greatly hinders co-operation between Austria/Italy/Russia and therefore
increases my chances. The presence of FA(Sil) helps me, there is virtually
no chance that England will leave Berlin undefended, so Germany has nothing
to lose by moving to Warsaw.</P>

<P> I could spend a considerable amount of time
discussing this position, but I want these orders to arrive on time!</P>

<P> Dear Rick,</P>
<P> Last season went well. The
order F(ENC)-Lon was a surprise, I don't think it was the best for that
unit. England is beginning to set up a commanding position in the German
hinterlands, but the south is open and it's a race to the Straits of Gibraltar!
This may be the last fleet that I build; with F(Smy)-AEG and F(ADR)-ION
(but perhaps not next season) I will be to move Turkish armies more rapidly
to the front.</P>
<P> One reason why it is difficult to convert winning positions
to won for Turkey is the distance from the Turkish home lands to the stalemate
line, no power has it so bad! Another piece of luck --- Italy should have
taken a chance and ordered A(Pie)-Tus; Italy has to trust that France realises
that it's not in his interest to capture Mar. If all goes well next season
should see the elimination of Austria. </P>

<P>I originally ordered F(Lvp)-Wal,
aiming to tie England down to defence of London. However if England orders
F(Lon)-ENC this season I want to be able to guarantee F(WES)-MAO, so that
I can follow up with F(Tun)-WMS. That would give me two fleets behind the
stalemate line and one about to cross it --- that should be enough to win.
If England orders to Wales, then I can cover it from IRI and I will be
able to force MAO without support. 

<P>If England wants to make an attempt
at stopping my onwards march to victory he needs to start flooding the
stalemate line area with fleets, there's a slight possibility that he may
be able to push my fleets out of their positions before I can take the
Iberian centres. Something like: F(Hol)-Bel, F(Kie)-NTH, F(Den)-NTH and
F(Swe)-Nor. If his fleets sit where they are, he can't stop the win. If
this were a two-player game (Turkey vs The Rest of the World) I would not
be so confident of winning. Turkey may win more games than Austria but
I am always surprised --- because of its distance from the main stalemate
line I consider it the hardest power to win!</P>

<P> I've left Serbia open so that
I can retreat A(Rum) there if it is dislodged. I'm not sure that this is
optimal, viz-a-viz elimination of Austria, but I want to have the option
of convoying A(Alb)-Ven in the Autumn. Italy should order A(Mar)-Pie again,
this time following up with A(Pie)-Tus, relaying on France not to take
Mar.</P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>

<P>I will be away from Thursday
17th to Thursday 24th. England has started to send the signals out, so
it should be me vs The Rest of the World from here in --- I hope I don't
blow it!</P>

<P> My biggest decision this season was what to do with F(IRI). If
I hold or order to either Clydside or Liverpool then I retain good chances
of keeping Liverpool. On the other hand if I order to ENG I might entice
Germany to retreat the dislodged F(Edi) to Cly, followed by disbanding
A(Mun). More importantly I intend to blitzkrieg France and F(ENC) is more
important from that perspective. I guess England will convoy A(Nor)-Edi
and build F(ENC). If he dislodges me from ENC in Spring 1910 then I may
be able to retreat to Bre.</P>

<P> Strategicaly A(Tyr) SA(Tri)-Vie is better, but
I want to ensure that Vienna falls this season --- I don't want Austria
to retain Vienna because Germany decided that A(Mun)-Ruhr was called for.
Russia should take the hint and order A(StP)-Lvn this season --- it makes
things much harder for me.</P>

<P> Winning will come down to either taking Munich
or one of the French centers. It's going to take me two seasons to push
F(ION)-TYS-LYO. Hopefully I will then have three fleets adjacent to Spa,
an army adjacent to Mar and two armies adjacent to Munich. The pressure
will then mount up on FA(Bur) --- EA(Bel)-Ruh looks obvious so I may need
three armies adjacent to Munich. Since the critical season is Autumn I
have, in effect, three movement seasons to achieve all this. It should
be possible.</P>
<P> I won't win in four seasons, I won't have mopped War/Mos/Sev
up by then, but if I can take the `18th' centre by then F/E will be under
intense pressure. I will laugh and laugh if I dislodge AA(Gal) this season
and it retreats to War... but that is very unlikely. I suppose Russia would
disband A(StP), not necessarily to my advantage... but in a no-press game
it is harder to co-ordinate two nationalities.</P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>

<P>Thanks for extending the deadline
(I must have forgot to tell you that I was going to be away!). Apologies
for not submitting by the end of the extension --- I had a really bad headache
and spent most of yesterday afternoon/evening in bed. </P>

<P>
A(Con) was an easy
build. The second build wasn't so easy --- I couldn't see if a fleet or
army was required. It's a long way from Turkey to the western battle grounds
and F's(AEG,ION) would speed up movement. In the end I decided that I can
effectively move units to the front by shuffling my eastern armies around
--- Bul to Rum, Rum to Gal, Gal to Sil etc. Additionally I'm thinking of
moving in force against Munich this year, if I build only one army I might
be stretched &quot;like too little butter over too much bread&quot; (to
quote Bilbo) in the east.</P>

<P> My strategic thinking is to force Munich and then use A(Mun)-Bur
to cut French support for Mar. I can pick up War/Mos/Sev at my
lesuire, breaking France open looks the best way to win. It was
interesting that Germany didn't retreat to Cly, I would have been
happy for him to take Lpl. Also the move A(mun)-Bur was
interesting. Perhaps Germany has decided to do what it can to help me
out?</P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>If I order F(ENC)-Wal and F(MAO)-IRI
I can hang onto Lpl for another year. With a little bit of luck I should
capture Munich and Sev this year, which would take me to 17. Then War and
Mos would take me to 18, assuming I lose Liverpool the following year.
This begs the question why I am not moving towards Liverpool... I'll have
to think about that some more!</P>

<P> Elsewhere. I could force Sev this year with
A(Gal)-Ukr and F(Bla)&amp;A(Arm) SA(Rum)-Sev. In order to prevent A(Ukr)-Rum,
which would result in a very messy position in the Balkans, I would have
to order A(Bud)-Rum. Even if I take Sev I'm not going anywhere in the Autumn,
so why use so many units to achieve this objective when I can take it in
the Autumn? England should order A(Nor)-StP-Lvn this year. This improves
the defense of the Russian centres, and offers him the opportunity to order
to Pru, to improve the defense of his German centres --- Berlin is weak
at the moment with only one defender.</P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>

<P>Not much to say. By disloding
my F(ENC) England has given me an opporunity to hold onto Liverpool for
another year. I've not yet decided if I am going to take up that opportunity,
it might be better to order F(IRI)SF(MAO), ensuring that I hang on in MAO
until next year, when I should be ready to blitz France. If I'd know that
Russia was going for such a weeny set of orders I could have taken Sev
with A(Rum)&amp;F(Bla) SA(Arm)-Sev.</P>

<P> Dear Rick, I'm running the risk that F(IRI)
will become trapped in IRI and forced to disband next year --- I'll never
get another fleet so far foward. However its destruction requires England to
tire up three units, a price worth paying? Perhaps. </P>

<P>I wondered if it were
better to support F(MAO) or F(Spa/sc) into Por: there's a faint possibility
that England and France will support each into MAO, in which case I can
force Por. However, if I were France I would order into MAO this season
to ensure that the support is cut. Ordering this way means that I either
win the game this season or A(Ven)-Pie is successful. (If France orders
A(Mar)-Pie then I either keep Spa or I capture Por.) In order to capture
Sev this season I have to support A(Rum)-Sev, which produces an `unsightly'
combination of units in Sev/Arm/BLA. </P>

<P>
Incidentally this position shows the
advantages (for the attacker) of keeping 1-center powers in the game. 
A(Gal)-Ukr
is fairly obvious. If Russia realises that Sev is doomed to fall then he
should consider ensuring A(Ukr)-Gal is succesful, so that in turn A(War)-Gal
is successful. A hostil army in Gal would tie down several of my units.
However the army in War is Austrian, not Russian. Consequently two players
have to think of this idea.</P>

<P> Positionally I wondered if it were better to
take Mun with either Boh or Tyr. However, ensuring that I take Mun this
season gives me a good opportunity to force Mar next season. For example,
suppose France recaptures Spain from Gascony, I retreat Spa/sc to WES.
Then next season I can cut the support from Bur via an attack from Munich,
cut the support from Spain by an attack from WES and make a supported attack
on Mar.
France should try enter Marseilles from Bur this season, either
ordering to Mun or supporting England to Munich from Burgundy. Then next
season he can order A(Gas)SA(Bur)-Mar. </P>

<P>I've commented several times during
the course of this game that England does not have an optimal mix of units.
Assume the worst case scenario for a moment (from my perspective). Suppose that
E/F combine to ensure that I can't force any Iberian centres <em>and</em>
 that England recaptures Lvp, while destroying my rogue fleet in the
process. Due to E's lack of armies E/F will find it difficult to
recapture Munich before I capture War and Mos --- two centres which
would take me to 18.</P>

Turkey to Master in 'gauntlet':</P> <P> Dear Rick,</P>
<P> England has moved to destroy
F(lvp) It may have been better to risk losing Lvp last season and holding
it at IRI, to keep the unit alive. Even worse, it looks like I am going to
lose MAO pretty soon. But hopefully I can keep control sufficiently long
in order to guarantee the win!</P>

<P> I'm surprised that Austria didn't order
to Silesia. That would have been better. Looks like I can force Mar in
the Spring. I can keep it in Autumn, at the risk of losing Munich.</P>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>Throughout this game I have
been analysing the position using maps produced by mapit. However, there
is no replacement for a board and pieces --- I should have spotted that
the F(Lpl) as going to be destroyed and consequently that I was going to
be evicted from MAO. Would have been better to stay in IRI. I don't think
that the builds are going to be important. </P>

<P>Dear Rick, </p>

<P>E/F's failure to evict me from
MAO last seasons means that I can force Marseilles this year, compensating
for the inevitable loss of Liverpool. Following up with A(Tyr)-Pie means
that France will not be able to recapture Marseilles for the forseeable
future. (He could do it if he were able to push a fleet into Spas/sc.)</P>

<P>
It's possible (probable) that E/F will combine to evict me from Munich
this season. However, with the set of orders I am going with, they can't
prevent me from retaking it in the Autumn. Additionally, in the best situation,
I might be able to retreat and have chances of both retaking Munich and
keeping Kiel! </P>
<P>
I think it is unlikely that Russia will outguess me in the
south and order to Gal. 
If he does and England finds the best move of A(Nwy)-StP,
intending A(StP)-Lvn then the position in the North could become tense.
If Russia goes for the worse set of orders and supports A(Ukr)-War, then
the game will be over.</P>
<P> I did consider an alternative set of orders, using
A's(Gal,Rum) to support A(Sev)-Ukr and F(BLA)SA(Arm)-Sev. However I can't
retake Munich if I use these orders. Furthermore, if England convoys A(Nor)-Den
I might not be able to retake Munich at all. I would look rather silly
if F(MAO)-Gas succeeds! However this does not look very likely. So I'll
move F(Tun) to ION so that I can convoy an army into either Apu/Alb. Not
that that is going to matter.</P>
