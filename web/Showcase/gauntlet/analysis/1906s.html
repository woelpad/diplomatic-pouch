<P>Dear Rick,</P>

<P>I am away from 10th July to the 17th. 

<P>The Italian player has been most
annoying! If he had been sensible and stayed in Marseilles then I
would have been happy to support him into Spain... hoping to split
Spain and Portugal 50-50 between us.  As it is I have decided to
admitt that my westerly fleets strategy was mistaken. England is too
strong, I can't make any progress against him.  The only chance I have
to pick up a center is if England were to support me into Bre. So I am
sending F(Wes) back east. </P>

<P>In a regular game of diplomacy I could
co-operate with Germany.  If I were to push into IRI then England would
have a 50-50 guess, should he stay in Liverpool or cover Edi? In
no-press Gunboat if he orders A(Lpl)-Edi the likely result would be a
standoff, since there is no way for G/T to decide which center to
attack. The move to Pie is risky because in the future an order
A(Mar)-Pie could cut vital support. However if I don't order to Pie
Austria can force Venice eventually, support into Tyr and then slip
into Pie, resulting in A's(Pie,Tyr,Tri).</P>  <P>Mark.</P>
