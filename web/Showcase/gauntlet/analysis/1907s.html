<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>The best feature of my position
is my fleet in the west. It's behind the main stalemate line and has the
potential to offer me all kinds of exciting possibilities latter on in
the game. I've got to keep that fleet on the board as long as possible.
Conversely England has to destroy that fleet as quickly as possible. Hence
the move to MAO, with the idea of preventing F(NTH)SF(Lon)-ENC and F(ENC)-MAO
when not only does Bre fall, but F(Bre) is beginning to run out of retreat
locations. I'm not too bothered about hanging onto Bre, hanging onto that
fleet is more important.</P>
<P> In the east we have the set of orders which I
have been working towards for several season. I don't expect to hold onto
Trieste, but I free my position up and I should be able to force Trieste
in the long run. There are various things which could happen, depending
upon how Austria orders; I hope I have everything covered! 

<P>The most `interesting'
option (least desirable!) would be AA(Rum)SA(Ser)-Bul, A(Alb)-Gre, which could
see me in Ser and Austria in Bul and Greece! That shouldn't be too bad,
I think I can recapture everything.</P> 

<P>Having said that F(Bre) is my best unit, if I have to disband this
year (a distinct possibility, there is no sure gain from Austria) that
may be the one. Having said that there is sure gain from Austria, I
think that A(Tyr)-Vie, A(Ven)-Tri is a stronger set of moves this
season, if Austria holds/supports in the south. However there are
potential problems if Italy has to retreat A(Mar) this season, and the
orders don't appear any stronger if Austria orders something like
A(Gal)-Vie, A(Ser)-Bud, A(Alb)-Ser which may be his best set of
defensive orders. I don't know what's going to happen...</P> 
<P>Mark.
