<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P> The convoy to Albania sets me
up very nicely, with four units adjacent to Trieste Austria will soon fall
over. If Austria outguess me this season and combines an order to Albania
with a supported attack into Trieste he will have ordered exceptionally
well! I could use A(Ser) to support into Tri, but I'd rather not get in
this season --- F(Tri) is not a constructive unit. (The problem with ordering
A(Ven)-Tyr is that a retreat to Tyrolia is annoying.)</P>

<P> Russia has to guess
is he should Sev or Rum, maybe I'll guess right here. I originally intended
ordering F(MAO)-Bre for the next two seasons, but worried that France/England
might combine and get it right. Instead I'll try to sneak into Liverpool.
Hopefully this may even stop England from building. (A couple of English
armies might make all the difference, it could all end up depending upon
Munich.)</P>
<P> Mark.</P>
