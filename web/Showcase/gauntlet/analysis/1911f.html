<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>Throughout this game I have
been analysing the position using maps produced by mapit. However, there
is no replacement for a board and pieces --- I should have spotted that
the F(Lpl) as going to be destroyed and consequently that I was going to
be evicted from MAO. Would have been better to stay in IRI. I don't think
that the builds are going to be important. </P>
<P>Mark.

<P>Dear Rick, </p>

<P>E/F's failure to evict me from
MAO last seasons means that I can force Marseilles this year, compensating
for the inevitable loss of Liverpool. Following up with A(Tyr)-Pie means
that France will not be able to recapture Marseilles for the forseeable
future. (He could do it if he were able to push a fleet into Spas/sc.)</P>

<P>
It's possible (probable) that E/F will combine to evict me from Munich
this season. However, with the set of orders I am going with, they can't
prevent me from retaking it in the Autumn. Additionally, in the best situation,
I might be able to retreat and have chances of both retaking Munich and
keeping Kiel! </P>
<P>
I think it is unlikely that Russia will outguess me in the
south and order to Gal. 
If he does and England finds the best move of A(Nwy)-StP,
intending A(StP)-Lvn then the position in the North could become tense.
If Russia goes for the worse set of orders and supports A(Ukr)-War, then
the game will be over.</P>
<P> I did consider an alternative set of orders, using
A's(Gal,Rum) to support A(Sev)-Ukr and F(BLA)SA(Arm)-Sev. However I can't
I might not be able to retake Munich at all. I would look rather silly
if F(MAO)-Gas succeeds! However this does not look very likely. So I'll
move F(Tun) to ION so that I can convoy an army into either Apu/Alb. Not
that that is going to matter.</P>
<P> Mark. </P>
<hr>
<P>I WIN next season --- YES! YES! YES! I
want to play it out.</P>
<P> Mark.
