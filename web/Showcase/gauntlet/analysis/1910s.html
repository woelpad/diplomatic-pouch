<P> Dear Rick, </P>
<P>If I order F(ENC)-Wal and F(MAO)-IRI
I can hang onto Lpl for another year. With a little bit of luck I should
capture Munich and Sev this year, which would take me to 17. Then War and
Mos would take me to 18, assuming I lose Liverpool the following year.
This begs the question why I am not moving towards Liverpool... I'll have
to think about that some more!</P>

<P> Elsewhere. I could force Sev this year with
A(Gal)-Ukr and F(Bla)&amp;A(Arm) SA(Rum)-Sev. In order to prevent A(Ukr)-Rum,
which would result in a very messy position in the Balkans, I would have
to order A(Bud)-Rum. Even if I take Sev I'm not going anywhere in the Autumn,
so why use so many units to achieve this objective when I can take it in
the Autumn? England should order A(Nor)-StP-Lvn this year. This improves
the defense of the Russian centres, and offers him the opportunity to order
to Pru, to improve the defense of his German centres --- Berlin is weak
at the moment with only one defender.</P>
<P> Mark.
