Analysis for Spring of 1904 in gauntlet
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<P> Dear Rick, </P>

<P> Apologies for the lateness
of my orders. As usual I left sending the orders until the last moment,
only to find myself being wined and dinned by captains of industry (well
one, to be exact) on wednesday evening. I don't get invited out for meals
at somebody else's expense very often... </P>

<P>
When I looked at the position
before the Winter adjudication I assumed that Italy would keep F(Tun) and
disband A(Pie). I then decided that I would attack Austria with A(Rom)-Ven
and A(Ven)-Tyr. After the Italian builds I decided not to attack him. </P>

<P> With correct play every game should finish in a draw, but I can
see how most powers can win with poor play. Even with poor play I have
never understood how Turkey can win, it's such a long way to the 18th
center. With a strong England and a strong Germany I can't see any way
of winning --- they sit on the stalemate line and even in a gunboat
game they have plenty of time to sort out their orders. </P>

<P>
I'm going to
move westwards and see what happens.  I can envisage this game
petering out into a 4-way draw, depending upon what E/G do. There's a
small chance that I might be able to break through Gibralter and onto
the other side of the stalemate line, but it's very unlikely. </P>
<P>
Mark.</P>

Moved house today. Went to my new local this evening. Didn't drink too
much but I didn't have any tea, so I am not feeling in a mood to
comment excessively on the game...  </P>

<P>
Austria's paranoria and rampant
anti-Turkish orders are understandable, he must have thought that I
was intending F(Ank)-BLA to pressurise Rum in conjunction with
A(Ven)-Tyr and A(Rom)-Ven. His defensive orders have given Russia
breathing space, which is good --- although I have no intention at the
moment of stabbing Austria I don't want hime gaining units with
increased defensive possibilities. Hopefully he will note that I
didn't make any anti-Austrian moves last season and return to a more
reasonable position. </P>

<P>As I see it Austria only has two options. He
either engages in anti-Turkish maneouvers or he takes a risk and
orders northwards, if I don't stab him he will gain builds; however
his lack of fleets means that he will never become the major partner
in a AT alliance. At the moment my strategy remains to move
west. However, if Austria continues with anti-T moves next season I
will consider F(ION)-ADR and the stab. I'm not particularly keen on
this, because the prospect of a E-G war opens up the possibility of
breaking through into MAO. </P>

<P>The F-I position is interesting. They are
both playing to occupy Spa and Por and in the absence of external
factors this should reduce to a 50-50 guess for each player. </P>
<P>Mark </P>
