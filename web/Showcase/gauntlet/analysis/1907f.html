<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P> Once again my orders are late
(this is becoming standard, sorry!), unfortunately this time they are late
by almost a week. All I can say is that I have been exceptionally busy
this week, preparing for a visit to the Newton Institute in Cambridge next
week. I wish I could say that it won't happen again...</P>
<P> Onto my orders.
In the south it looks like a guessing game. I couldn't find any way to
guarantee taking an Austrian centre, for any set of orders that takes a
centre there is an appropriate set of defensive orders. However, I believe
that I can force Sev --- AA(Rum) is almost certainly NOT going to support
RA(Sev). If I capture Sev I believe that Russia will disband A(Fin). England
will then capture StP the following year. I'd rather forgo Sev (giving
Russia time to booster his defense with A(War)-Ukr) then allow England
to capture StP so quickly. </P>

<P>
The obvious orders for Austria are either A(Vie,Bud,Ser)
SA(Alb)-Tri, or A(Vie,Bud)SA(Ser)-Tri with A(Alb,Bud) defending Ser in
some manner. Since I'm not guaranteed taking a center, I'll order F(MAO)-Bre,
hoping that England/France don't co-ordinate and take Bre. The best resolution
for me would be a standoff, leaving me in MAO. </P>

<P>Dear Rick,</P>
<P>
Austria chose an obvious choice of orders, I could have taken two of his
centres if I'd outguessed him. I manage to keep Bre for another year, and
more importantly keep F(MAO). England didn't build, even better. My chances
of winning are better now then for several years, but it might depend upon
getting a second fleet behind the stalemate line. I need to move F(ION)
westwards as quickly as possible.</P>
<P> Mark.
