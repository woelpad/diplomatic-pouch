Analysis for Spring of 1909 in gauntlet

<P> Dear Rick, </P>

<P>I originally ordered F(Lvp)-Wal,
aiming to tie England down to defence of London. However if England orders
F(Lon)-ENC this season I want to be able to guarantee F(WES)-MAO, so that
I can follow up with F(Tun)-WMS. That would give me two fleets behind the
stalemate line and one about to cross it --- that should be enough to win.
If England orders to Wales, then I can cover it from IRI and I will be
able to force MAO without support. 

<P>If England wants to make an attempt
at stopping my onwards march to victory he needs to start flooding the
stalemate line area with fleets, there's a slight possibility that he may
be able to push my fleets out of their positions before I can take the
Iberian centres. Something like: F(Hol)-Bel, F(Kie)-NTH, F(Den)-NTH and
F(Swe)-Nor. If his fleets sit where they are, he can't stop the win. If
this were a two-player game (Turkey vs The Rest of the World) I would not
be so confident of winning. Turkey may win more games than Austria but
I am always surprised --- because of its distance from the main stalemate
line I consider it the hardest power to win!</P>

<P> I've left Serbia open so that
I can retreat A(Rum) there if it is dislodged. I'm not sure that this is
optimal, viz-a-viz elimination of Austria, but I want to have the option
of convoying A(Alb)-Ven in the Autumn. Italy should order A(Mar)-Pie again,
this time following up with A(Pie)-Tus, relaying on France not to take
Mar.</P>
