Analysis for Spring of 1899 in gauntlet
</font></td></tr></table></center>

<p>   I haven't played this vt before, but I am convinced that the
correct opening strategy is to capture your hsc as quickly as possible.
Furthermore you should capture the center that is nearest to your
starting center so that you continue to expand outwards.  Playing
Austria I would go for Vie, England Lpl, France Paris, Germany Berlin,
Italy Rome, Russia Moscow and Turkey Con.</P>

<P>
   The Austrian move to Ser is worrying, but it could be a brilliant
double-bluff.  In this position I would order A(Ser)-Bud, hoping to entice
Turkey into moving into Bul.  We shall see!
</P>

<P>
   I agree with the opening moves used for F/I/R and, naturally, T.
Although I believe that F should go for Paris I think it's best to order
to Gas, because then your opponents can't be certain about what you are
aiming for.
