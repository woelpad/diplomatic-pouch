Analysis for Spring of 1911 in gauntlet

 <P> Dear Rick,</P>
<P> England has moved to destroy
F(lvp) It may have been better to risk losing Lvp last season and holding
it at IRI, to keep the unit alive. Even worse, it looks like I am going to
lose MAO pretty soon. But hopefully I can keep control sufficiently long
in order to guarantee the win!</P>

<P> I'm surprised that Austria didn't order
to Silesia. That would have been better. Looks like I can force Mar in
the Spring. I can keep it in Autumn, at the risk of losing Munich.</P>
<P> Mark.
