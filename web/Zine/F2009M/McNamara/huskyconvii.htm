<p>My first HuskyCon was <a href="/Zine/F2007M/Woodring/huskycon.htm">in 2007</a>, and I had a blast. The same experience
repeated itself in 2008, so there was no way that I was going to miss
the 2009 version. At some point in the intervening time, the idea
coalesced in my head that it would be a good idea to make the trip
down via bicycle. So thumbing my nose at the fickle and horrible New
England weather and generally hoping for the best, this is where the
story starts.
<h2>Prologue: Cambridge to Providence. (6km + train)</h2>
<p>An easy day on the train to crash at Brendan Hickey's place in
Providence so that I can get off to an early start the following day.
We duelled over a couple of games of Escalation <b>Diplomacy</b>, which I'd
never tried before. My impression of the two player variant is that it
is all over very quickly, with the placement of the pieces determining
the outcome given any sensible set of moves.
<h2>Stage 1: Providence to New London (95km)</h2>
<p>The morning started easily with the flat Washington Secondary Bike
Path, fuelled by an enormous breakfast when I stopped to grab a bite
to eat. Now I know that America is known for huge servings, but still
I did not expect to receive two large plates of food, one containing
two large pancakes and the other with a large breakfast in itself.
<p>Nevertheless, this food fuelled me as the rolling hills started as I
traversed Rhode Island along the most direct route, largely following
the I95. The rain starts as I cross the state border into Connecticut,
but this is not a problem as the rain is very light. I find the
entrance to the (too narrow, not happy) pedestrian/bicycle path on the
Gold Star Bridge and cruise into New London mid-afternoon.
<p>At this point, with the rain settling in, I make what I consider a
strategic error and find a motel in New London to spend the night.
Better would've been to take the ferry to Orient Point on Long Island
immediately and stay the night there, saving two hours on the
following day. But this was not to be.
<h2>Stage 2: New London to the Woodring residence (100km + ferry)</h2>
<p>The rain finally stops, and I am treated to a sunny day with only a
slight headwind for the ride down Long Island. I am able to follow the
well-signposted New York Bicycle Route 25 from Orient Point to Port
Jefferson which largely follows the main roads with a few detours
thrown in for good measure. It is a mostly flat stage with some
undulating terrain at the end beginning to hurt after two days in the
saddle. Still, I arrive at the Woodring residence in one piece, and a
few hours later Alex Amman arrives with my change of clothes so that I
may be presentable for the weekend.
<h4>Round 0</h4>
<p>The Woodring hospitality is amazing. For those who have been living on
a rock and don't yet know, the venue is in a spectacular house
overlooking the water, with food drink and sleeping space all
complimentary for the entire weekend. If you haven't yet made it to a
HuskyCon, then you owe it to yourself to do all that you can to make
it to the next one.
<h4>Round 1: Friday night</h4>
<p>I draw Russia, and for the first time get to play a regular <b>Diplomacy</b>
game on the big board. This big board is a hand painted board on a
table tennis table and comes complete with large wooden pieces.
Despite the big board, I am off my game and struggle. In the south I
ignore the diplomatic signals that I would be better working with
Manny's Turkey and make a poor stab. Meanwhile in the north, Don
Woodring in England is lying to me every turn.
<p>In 1905 Carl in Austria decides to stab for something he is never
going to hold while at the same time letting the EF through the
stalemate line. I vote down the draw and we take two off Carl the
following year, after which the draw passes. This draw should not have
passed, bringing an unnaturally early end to a game that had barely
started.
<h4>Round 1.5: Brendan Hickey's secret mansion</h4>
<p>Now this HuskyCon is the largest ever, and so there is encouragement
to sleep off-site for those who are able, in order to ease
overcrowding concerns. Brendan regales Alex, Jon and myself with stories of
a large mansion on Long Island that he can find a key to. For some
reason, we believe him and set off in the middle of the night to find
this place.
<p>Apparently this place is 30 miles away. I have no idea what that means
since I grew up in a civilised country with the metric system. But
after about an hour in the car, we're clearly lost, and have to
backtrack our way to the main road. Fortunately Alex has a good sense
of navigation. So we find the house, Brendan then can't find the key,
but eventually does and we're inside. Turns out this place is also
massive and could hold its own HuskyCon if only we could convert the
occupants (who were out of town) to <b>Diplomacy</b>. So we get a good night's
sleep, and after a couple of nervous moments an alliance with Brendan
is still on the cards for the following day.
<h4>Round 2: Saturday morning</h4>
<p>I draw England. I used to be able to play England, until Goffy started
drawing Germany at the same time and eliminating me. This time I have
Cyrille along as Germany. Cyrille has twice as many world
championships as Goffy so I'm starting to feel twice as worried &#8212 this
doesn't look good, especially when Manny, who I killed in the first
game, reappears as my neighbour in France.
<p>However, in 1901 Manny supports an Austrian army into Munich so
suddenly things are looking up. Russia builds a fleet in StP(nc),
volunteering himself as my first target. So I am able to clean out Swe
and StP in the midst of an uneasy EFG truce.
<p>I don't really like the idea of being ruthless to the same player
twice in two games, but the EFG situation was crying out to be
resolved as an EG v F battle. Unlike the previous night, this time I
was successful as Cyrille and I became the dominant alliance on the
board. There were a couple of hiccups, one where Cyrille tried to stab
in the fall but aborted in the Winter after things didn't go to his
liking, then in the last turn before the draw I grabbed Paris to be on
top in a 10-9 supply centre split.
<p>I shouldn't have taken Paris, and yet again this game was unfinished,
but we called a draw and went swimming. The water was a little chilly
for my liking but it was pleasant to be outside in the water,
certainly a positive of the early draw.
<p>The other games on the Saturday were also eventful. There was a
costume themed board, where seven players who had dressed up were all
seeded on the one board. They must've been really getting into the
swing of things as I'm pretty sure this was the last board to finish.
Then there was the non-solo and the solo.
<p>Firstly, rising star Randy (already a good player, and rapidly
improving, so watch out!) got himself up to 17 centres. The rest of
the board managed to convince him that he was stopped, though this was
not the case. As soon as Randy voted for the draw it was pointed out
that the 18th centre was actually forced. Not to worry, I'm sure
Randy's breakthrough first solo is not far away.
<p>Meanwhile, on another board, Jon and Gary had set up the classic
stalemate line to ensure that Graham's Austria could never get past
17. But some jerk threw Graham the solo, catapulting him into the
tournament lead, from which he was never headed.
<h4>Round 2.5 Saturday night</h4>
<p>HuskyCon deliberately doesn't have a Saturday night round, opting
instead for a night of socialising. With all players onsite, the mix
of food, drink, socialising with a great crowd of people and open
gaming available truly makes for a great time and is really part of
what makes HuskyCon so great.
<p>As is the tradition, we ended up on the big board playing a game of
double gunboat. That is there are 14 players with two sets of pieces
playing independent games that just happen to be sharing the same
board. Only problem is, we had 15 players. So one lucky guy got to be
a joker who put in orders for his choice of country each turn.
<p>In this variant, you score one point per supply centre, and then have
to guess the identities of the other players, getting one point per
correct response. On the board, I was in the easiest Juggernaut
alliance I'd ever seen, romping to 10 centres before the time draw,
and since nobody was able to replicate the feats of Melissa's guessing
of 12 correct out of 14 from two years past, I was somehow able to
hold on for the victory.
<h4>Round 3 Sunday</h4>
<p>I don't think I had ever caught up with the extra sleep from cycling
down, so I volunteered to sit out this round. That, and it was the
timedraw round, which makes it less attractive to play in. As
mentioned before, Graham Woodring (in what I believe is his first
HuskyCon as a player only) held on for the tournament win, beating out
runner up Cliff, who failed to provide us with a repeat of last years
performance of falling down the cliff.
<p>Sunday is quite a relaxed day as the tournament winds down, and people
start to leave. For the first time, I was staying the night as I had
my bicycle with me. Graham tried to poison us by placing far too many
spices in his pasta, leaving me pining for the earlier cooking of Lori
Wheeler, whose donation of time and energy, as well as the work put in
by all the Woodrings, cannot be thanked enough.
<h2>Stage 3 Setauket to Boston (19km + train + bus)</h2>
<p>After breakfast, I realised through a combination of tiredness, lack
of fitness, and the weather report, that I wasn't really feeling like
riding all the way home. So I made an executive decision to get back
to Boston in what is both the cheapest and the most bike friendly
manner that I knew of. Cycle to Port Jefferson train station, followed
by LIRR to Manhattan. Then cycle through dirty smelly New York to
reach Chinatown, which puts me on a bus taking me all the way back to
South Station in Boston, ready for a quick four and a half kilometre
ride home, completing my longest <b>Diplomacy</b> experience to date.
<p>Now at one point recently, Mel was telling me how after a tournament,
people always want to compile a detailed list of what went wrong to
complain, and never write such a detailed analysis of what went right
over the course of the weekend. HuskyCon certainly deserves the
latter. So here we go.
<h4>Itemised list of good things at HuskyCon</h4>
<ol type="n">
<li>The Woodring hospitality.
<li>The cost. Free food and board for all.
<li>The fellow <b>Diplomacy</b> players. This year we had a great group of
people in attendence, making for a serene ambience.
<li>The Scoring System. It is good to see that Win Tier nonsence exorcised.
<li>The location. Right next to the water, viewes of Long Island sound,
what more could one ask for?
<li>Saturday night. I don't think there are any plans to interfere with
this structure, but there never should be.
</ol>
<p>... maybe I could go on forever here.
<h4>Itemised list of bad things at HuskyCon</h4>
<ol type="n">
<li>Carl's stab of me in Round 1.
<li>Me failing to join an RT in Round 1.
<li>That cat that lives at Brendan Hickey's house.
<li>How are we supposed to have a flame war on mailing lists if the
only thing that I can think of that went wrong is that someone in
Providence has an annoying pet?
<li>I think I'm running out of things to say. HuskyCon was too
enjoyable. 
</ol>
<p>See as many of you as possible there next year!
