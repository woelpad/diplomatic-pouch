			<p class="centered"><i>The Academy of Creative Destruction (the "ACD") is looking for new members!</i></p>
			<p>In conjunction with our move from Yahoogroups to a new board, we realize that in order to continue as a community, we want to bring in new, active members and reach out to old members who have drifted away over the years. The ACD has been an invitation-only organization for almost its entire existence, so this is a big step for us.</p>
			<p>The ACD is over 30 years old (it began as a friendly "back room" of the old Cat23 forum). Games are old-school, play by email and human-adjudicated, although GMs are welcome to use software to assist them. We have had both FTF and online world champions as ACD members and the overall level of play is very good. The stronger your level of play the better, but what is much more important to us your reliability and dedication to the game. Some more specifics:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Almost all games are full press and not anonymous.</li>
				<li>No scoring or rating systems. Members acquire reputations (see point 1), but each game stands on its own.</li>
				<li>Deadlines are usually on the longer side, typically in the 3-7 day range for movement turns and somewhat shorter for retreats and adjustments.</li>
				<li>We are serious about reliability and dedication. Multiple failures to submit orders or an abandonment, without cause, and the offending player will be booted from the ACD.</li>
				<li>Many games are interesting variants, including playtests of new variants.</li>
			</ol>
