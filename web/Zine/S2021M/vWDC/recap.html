This was the Top Board for the very first edition of the Virtual World Diplomacy Classic, a direct consequence of a year in which almost all Face-to-Face tournaments were cancelled or adapted to a virtual format because of the ongoing pandemic.
</p><p>
The Top Board, and in fact the whole tournament, was covered by the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj88H0KNyakiUXuN7jSz_EQ"><i>Diplomacy Broadcasting Network</i></a> (or DBN for short). They unfortunately insist that you watch this on YouTube, so click the link in the video and you're set to go. Coverage of the Top Board starts at 1:25:50.

The recap retells the Top Board in the words of the participants, which may give some surprising insights that you may have missed just listening to the commentators. Go on and read what these brilliant minds had to say about their own play and that of their adversaries.

<blockquote><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Let's kick it off for real. All of you players, what are your thoughts on the power selection process, both at the time and now in hindsight?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> Picked third to last and really thought I would end up picking third. It seemed, however, that everyone wanted to dodge <span class="england">Nicolas</span> and myself, and I ended up picking first - France was an obvious choice, though in hindsight, maybe I would have been better off as Italy. &#128521;
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="austria">Matt Crill</span></b> My reasoning for picking after <span class="france">Bill</span> and <span class="england">Nicolas</span> was to first see what arena they chose.  If <span class="russia">Farren</span> also chose before me then I would still pick 4th which still provides plenty of choices.
<br> After seeing the top three selections, I wanted to be in the East away from a potential EF alliance. I selected Austria thinking that I could work well with <span class="russia">Farren</span> as Russia and whoever selected Italy. At this point, I was already thinking of focusing on Turkey.
<br> In hindsight, I could have picked higher and gone with a safer choice to attempt being in a final draw. Given my second place ranking entering the top board,  I should have been considering the 150% point bonus for the final tournament rankings instead of gambling with Austria.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> The consensus so far is that picking higher might be preferential. Let's see if this trend continues.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> I didn't have any choice in the matter, but I was actually pleased with being assigned Turkey. It matched how I was planning to approach the top board very well (play fairly defensively at first and bide my time for dynamics to become clear).
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> I was hoping to get either England or France but also wanted a decent tiebreaker if it came up. (It came up! So in that regard I feel slightly vindicated for not just picking first.) I thought <span class="france">Bill</span> would probably take one of those two, but I didn't think <span class="england">Nicolas</span> would take the other. But I was happy to take Russia as a third pick because I'm comfortable playing the country.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> I was hoping to pick somewhat in the middle and think maybe choosing before <span class="england">Nicolas</span> would have been better for that. I wanted to base my picks off of the few people before me still having a fairly wide choice. I choose Italy out of that and Turkey because Italy is one of my preferred countries and I don't feel like I play Turkey very well.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> I didn't really have a strategy when it came to selecting the order. When it was my choice to pick, I was never going to pick Turkey (too likely to get killed by an AIR early) and the choice between Germany and Italy was tough. I went for Germany because it was a western country and I could directly control the big names already in the west if the need arose, as opposed to needing others to do the work for me.

<blockquote><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Let's put up the first season. First contact. Who do you talk to, what do you tell them and how does it pan out?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> My plan for turn one was pretty simple. I wasn't completely sure whether I wanted to work with Austria or Turkey initially but Austria came to me and told me that Italy was on board with him and we kind of came to an agreement on an AIR to take down Turkey. I spoke with Italy who agreed to do this so I went ahead with that plan. I tried to come to terms with Turkey as well just in case Austria was bluffing and made a pretty standard set of moves so that I wouldn't be in dire straits if Turkey or Austria decided to move against me.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> I had good initial conversations with everyone in the East. Austria and I spoke about me getting Trieste and he was not against it happening in the Fall. France and I agreed not to move against one another. I agreed to work in an AIR to take down Turkey but in reality wasn't really for or against it and wanted to see how things would play out. I planned to work with one of Austria or Turkey against the other at this point and had not yet come to any conclusions, although I was probably pulled towards working with Turkey due to having a good relationship with him from prior games.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="austria">Matt Crill</span></b> I also had good initial discussions with everyone but did focus on arranging an AIR alliance and thought there was good buy-in from all parties. A bounce in Galicia was arranged with <span class="russia">Farren</span> and these Spring moves went as expected.
<br> I offered Trieste to <span class="italy">Maxim</span> to help provide the important 5th unit to Italy for moving on Turkey but more importantly for him to protect against <span class="france">Bill</span> assuming an EF alliance. I felt this would help solidify an AI alliance which I felt was especially important this game so that <span class="italy">Maxim</span> wasn't seen as a weak target for France.
<br> I also had good opening talks with <span class="turkey">Morgante</span>, but I assumed he would see the AIR forming so we didn't discuss much with the opening moves.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> As you can see from the moves, there are no surprises. There seemed no interest in the west in doing anything out of the ordinary in the opening so I made the standard moves.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> I talked to everyone in the East to start, but only Italy seemed interested/committed to a plan of working together. Austria and Russia were both willing to talk but neither were interested in committing to decisive plans against the other. Therefore I chose a relatively flexible/passive opening to see how diplomacy shaped up for the fall, with an eye towards Italy as my preferred ally.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> - The move Smy-Ank, Ank-Bla is not often seen. It's as if you expect to enter Bla with the aim of destroying the Russian fleet either in Arm or Rum (through convoy) to set up the Steamroller. But in this case you knew that there was a bounce coming, right?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> Correct, Russia had requested the bounce so I knew that move would bounce. I chose this move because it maintains optionality: if Russia did decide on an RT, I could move Ank-Con / Smy - Ank, but I also have the option of Smy-Arm in the fall. I had also considered Smy-Arm but Austria wasn't willing to commit to an AT attack on Russia.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> <span class="germany">Peter</span> (G) and I spoke briefly about an early assault on <span class="england">Nicolas</span> (E).  But, I was pretty hesitant about opening to the channel and previous experience with <span class="germany">Peter</span> has taught me not to get out of position near him. I offered the usual Mediterranean DMZ to <span class="italy">Maxim</span> in Italy, and spent the rest of the time getting a feel for the rest of the board.

<blockquote><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Moving on to Fall and Winter 01. All neutrals get taken, but not always by the unit one would expect. Same with the builds, except one was waived (by France). What are the considerations there?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> By this point I thought I had a stable alliance with Austria and Italy. Negotiations with Turkey weren't working out very well. Seeing Turkey's move of the army into Armenia, the attempted bounce in Rum, and the fleet into Black Sea I built to be aggressive against Turkey. I thought the move of Italy to Tri was negotiated and so didn't think anything of it.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> <span class="russia">Farren</span> - The build of army Rome should have raised some red flags though. A hair in the butter?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> Army Rome definitely raised red flags but I didn't know about that until the builds went through.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> <span class="france">Bill</span> told me that he would build 1 fleet, 1 army and waive if he took BEL. With that I was willing to allow him into BEL (<span class="england">Nicolas</span> had told me he wasn't interfering in BEL) to try and find a FG alliance, knowing that if instead I wanted to play an EG, BEL would be an easy target. From that point, my moves and builds are very boring. I was very unhappy to see the fleet in MAR and not BRE though.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> I took Tri as arranged with Austria, but instead of convoying to Tun as agreed I moved up to Ven. At this point I decided to attack Austria and see how much I could get. Looking back, Army Rome might not be very good for fighting Austria as it is difficult to move Ven and I expected Austria to expect me to fight them. Towards the end of the Fall negotiations, <span class="france">Bill</span> told me that if I moved to Tyrolia he would not build a fleet in Marseilles, however I was already planning to move to Trieste. I don't recall whether or not I told him that, although if I did not I am not sure why as perhaps I could have convinced him to not build F Mar regardless. That build had me a bit worried. Sev was the other notable build from my perspective. I expected <span class="russia">Farren</span> to probably work with <span class="austria">Matt</span> as she had said she would, but I didn't expect the fleet there due to forcing the fight with Turkey.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> By the fall, negotiations with Russia had broken down enough that I felt fairly confident she would be likely to attack me. So I decided to move to Arm. The remaining question was over Austria—could I get him on side against Russia or not? I agreed to not bounce him in Greece and suggested he support me to Rum if he wanted the possibility of allying together.
<br> My build was relatively straightforward—fundamentally Turkey needs two fleets, but Con was the optimal location for maximizing my defense against the obvious AR and also provided maximal flexibility moving forward.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> Three build France is easy. Waive one unless Germany is in Burgundy. Of course, if Germany’s in Burgundy, you’re probably not getting three builds, but I digress. 
<br> I told England (<span class="england">Nicolas</span>) and Italy   (<span class="italy">Maxim</span>) “do X and I’ll not build a fleet in Brest/Marseilles.” I wasn’t sure what I’d do if they both kept their word, but fortunately <span class="italy">Maxim</span> didn’t.  About what, I can’t be certain.  Maybe I asked for a convoy to Tunis or him moving into Tyrolia?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> Yeah, you asked me to move to Tyrolia. Did I tell you that I wanted to take Trieste or no?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> You did not, as far as I recall.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="austria">Matt Crill</span></b> Yes, <span class="italy">Maxim</span>'s move to Trieste was arranged but the agreement was to use it for a second fleet. I was frustrated by the army build but thought the combination of France's fleet build in Mar and Russia's fleet build in Sev were enough to convince Italy to defend against France and work with us against Turkey. I didn't believe that <span class="italy">Maxim</span> would press an attack on me for these reasons and had a stable alliance with <span class="russia">Farren</span>. At this point, I felt the AIR alliance was working well and started thinking about whether the West was headed toward us since there were no clear EFG conflicts starting.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> So... <span class="austria">Matt</span>, a similar scenario played out during the top board at the 2019 WDC. Ruben Sanchez was Austria and I was Italy and he welcomed me in for the extra fleet build (which I did). There was a strong EF in that game, too. It did not turn out well for Ruben, but we’ll have to see how it turns out for you!

<blockquote><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Spring 02. Alliances take shape, and an East versus West appears to emerge. Or not? What are the optics here going into the Fall season?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> Biggest mistake I (and Austria) made this season was that we thought we had Italy on side. Even after this turn we still thought Italy might be on board for cooperating. We thought Italy was going to help us finish off Austria and then turn west as a united front. Obviously that didn't happen.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> 100% should have done a better job convincing <span class="england">Nicolas</span> to take my support into HOL. 
<br> <span class="italy">Maxim</span> gave me some song and dance about going to Western as a ruse. I asked him not to, especially since I took POR with the fleet like he asked. I was desperately trying to reach some sort of agreement with him so that I could free my fleets up to go north - and have any kind of options.  But he insisted on this and I was in no position to stop him. We’ll see how successful this “ruse” will be moving forward.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> There was a lot of talk this turn about AIR moving into TYR/BOH/SIL. I didn't get to talk to <span class="russia">Farren</span> all turn, which was very bad. The moves to SIL and BAL were mostly in response to these two things.
<br> In the west BUR was a negotiated bounce with <span class="france">Bill</span> and given my difficulties elsewhere, I felt I had no choice but to hope that <span class="england">Nicolas</span> was telling the truth. He was.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="austria">Matt Crill</span></b> I agree with <span class="russia">Farren</span> that we both thought Italy was still on board to finish off Turkey while moving to Tyr, Pie & W Med. This prompted us to move to Sil & Boh hoping to get an early jump on the West.
<br> <span class="italy">Maxim</span> or <span class="turkey">Morgante</span>, if <span class="germany">Peter</span> and others were hearing about Tyr/Boh/Sil moves were you sharing that intel to help the West defend while attacking me?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> I had been planning to continue into Austrian centers since the Fall and did so. I was a little surprised that <span class="austria">Matt</span> was willing to trust and work with me and considered going with the AIR, but decided against it seeing more gains in the Balkans than elsewhere. I moved into WES because I worried that <span class="france">Bill</span> would move towards me and wanted to be in a better position if he did. I don't remember what exactly I talked to <span class="france">Bill</span> about but I did state my worry and that I was on edge whether or not to move to WES. I did not tell the West that anyone was moving to Tyr/Boh/Sil as far as I remember, but I may have said (I don't recall) I was working with Austria and Russia which could have resulted in that suspicion, although the suspicions were definitely alive before this turn.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> <span class="italy">Maxim</span> talking about WES was a huge tip that there was an AIR that he needed to demonstrate follow through to. I anticipated Tyrolia, Bohemia, and either Pru or Sil, and discussed the matter with <span class="germany">Peter</span>. 
<br> I found the move to Serbia surprising. <span class="austria">Matt</span> - what did <span class="italy">Maxim</span> say when you asked him about it?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="austria">Matt Crill</span></b> Thanks <span class="france">Bill</span> for the insight and makes sense if <span class="italy">Maxim</span> was talking about WES.
<br> The move to Serbia was a complete surprise and <span class="italy">Maxim</span> was obviously attacking. I attempted to get him to pull back by pointing out France's two fleets positioned to enter the Med plus reminding him that France had a waived build. However, that reasoning didn't work and I was out of position to push back against Italy's advances.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> At this point, my priority was survival. That included trying to maintain the position in the Black Sea and highlighting the AIR to western powers with an interest in slowing down the AR. With <span class="italy">Maxim</span>, I focused on how powerfully he could attack Austria and that I was ready to play an IT the whole way.

<blockquote><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> In Fall 02 we see turmoil in the East and unity in the West. It's a defining moment, the end of the opening phase, as the underlying dynamics come to the surface. How did it happen?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> It became clear to me by this point that Italy was firmly on side with Turkey and I had big problems in the north as well. My immediate goal became finding an agreement with either Germany or England to not lose Stp while trying to fight the Italian-Turkish alliance in the south with Austria. Seeing the French fleets move into the Med and the army build in Mar gave me a glimmer of hope that maybe I could still find a way to talk Italy into helping us finish off Turkey and then turning West.
<br> Really, the idea of "surely now I can get Italy on side" dominates my thought process through most of this game and where I made most of my mistakes.
<br> Something something definition of insanity
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> I pick up SWE from BAL instead of DEN because E is still in NTH. Even though I get a build, this is not a great position to be in. I have no opening to attack either E or F, and the position of the only two French fleets the wrong side of MAO is not helping.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="austria">Matt Crill</span></b> My positioning at this stage was pathetic so my focus was on trying to have Russia provide support and encouraging France to attack Italy. I wasn't in a position to really help Italy but offered to not attack him if he would pull back to fight France.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> <span class="france">Bill</span> convinced me that he was not headed my way and I was hoping to use that fleet in the East, although with a build I am thinking now that it probably wasn't needed much in the East. I supported <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> to Bulgaria instead of taking Greece because I didn't want to get too large and draw the attention of more foes, thinking <span class="france">Bill</span> was not headed towards me. If I was in this position again I think I would have held WES or tried to guess on Naf and would have taken Greece. My plan with my build was to cover ION in case <span class="france">Bill</span> let me into Tunis, but in the end I didn't do much with it for a long time and should have probably built in Rome and certainly crawled it somewhere useful.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> Nobody in the west was interested in working with me against a common opponent. So, I only had one direction to go. Had <span class="italy">Maxim</span> supported himself to Greece, which I thought he would, I would have snagged Tunis in the next year and really been in a position to impose my will in the north. I needed another build and stability in the south to pivot (was my thinking).
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> <span class="france">Bill</span> - Mao to Naf instead of the more deliberate support for Spa to Wes is quite a bold move. How confident were you that it would succeed?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> Pretty confident. Between my three neighbors, <span class="italy">Maxim</span> (Italy) was the unknown. I thought I could catch him overextended into his attack on Greece. I failed to recognize that Turkey and he would work together, which was ultimately my undoing here.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> <span class="france">Bill</span> - Your build is certainly interesting as well. In order to force Tun a fleet in Mar would have been more practical. Instead you choose the army. Please explain.
<br> The same could be said for <span class="germany">Peter</span>. Fleet Kie looks a lot more flexible in terms of tactical options up North. Do France and Germany fear each other that much that they're both locking each other down?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> I didn’t want to overcommit to the med. I knew that I would have to negotiate my way out of the situation I placed myself. In hindsight, a fleet might have been a good idea. But in my experience when you you’re France and neither Germany or England talk to you about attacking the other ... there’s a good chance they’re attacking you. An Army has flexibility for defense and could do an end-around into Munich. A fleet would get me Tunis, but then what? Italy was in GREAT shape to lock three of my units down protecting one center. That’s peak inefficiency.

<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Spring 03 While the battle in the East rages, the West rearranges its forces. IT gains a major victory when AR bounce each other over Rum during retreat. Did Russia betray Austria, or did the tactics simply not work out?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> Winter 02: I probably build an army to preserve EG options, but I forget exactly my thinking at the time.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> At this point I, sadly, gave up on Austria being a viable partner. Accepting the support to Bud from Italy and the bounce in Sev was arranged. Rum to Bul, however, was not arranged. I had agreed to disband BLA with Turkey but instead had it retreat to Rum to block Budapest retreating there since that would force disband it anyway. I assumed that Turkey's intention was to kill me regardless so I was still hoping to get Italy on side.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> <span class="italy">Maxim</span> can correct me if I'm wrong, but it's here that I began trying to sell him on a trade of Tunis for Munich.  I considered this a principled trade - it would benefit him by allowing him to get his fleets into better position against Austria and Turkey and it would cripple Germany to benefit me.  Granted, it was a bit of strong-arm diplomacy as well - since I had fleets threatening Tunis directly.  But it began the point at which I strongly pushed for a principled solution for us.
<br> I wonder how things would have turned out had we reached this agreement.  Unfortunately, I'm afraid that my heavy fleet presence in the south all but forced him to partner with <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> in Turkey.  But, rather than lay out his thought process - I'm confident that <span class="italy">Maxim</span>  can speak for himself.
<br> It's also at this point that <span class="england">Nicolas</span> and I should have attacked Germany vice continuing to play nice.  But it would have required him supporting me into Holland rather than me supporting him into the territory.  Also, <span class="germany">Peter</span> didn't let me know that he was attacking England.  Had he, I probably would have pulled back from the south and worked with him.  I needed an outlet for growth, and I just wasn't getting anything anywhere.

<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> In Winter, <span class="russia">Farren</span> was supposed to disband her fleet in Black Sea but instead kept both her fleets around so it was clear to me she had no intention of working together. My priority for this year was eliminating those fleets to give me room to operate and control the Black Sea area. Otherwise most of my diplomacy was focused on keeping <span class="italy">Maxim</span> on side and seeing what else I could do to make <span class="russia">Farren</span>'s life difficult in the north.
<br> <span class="russia">Farren</span> I do have to ask why you chose to keep those fleets. I was actually still hoping to work with you until you did and even if you still intended to be hostile I think they left you overextended.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> In the Mediterranean, I didn't coastal crawl Nap anywhere due to worry that I would be let into Tunis while Austria could take the Ionian behind me. I don't recall much of what <span class="france">Bill</span> said about a trade for Munich, but it must have been this turn since in the next he made a slightly different offer. I probably didn't want to do the Munich offer since I didn't think I could hold onto Munich for very long.
<br> In the East, I decided to support <span class="russia">Farren</span> to Budapest to hopefully get into some center myself with her help in the Fall.
<br> Overall, this turn didn't see much progress for me and I was working towards some change in East and West to open up opportunities.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> <span class="italy">Maxim</span> - what change in the west were you working towards?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> I was hoping to get you to move out of the Med. In hindsight I think I should have taken your next deal, but at the time I wanted to keep Tunis.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> You will have to chime in with that. &#128522;
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="austria">Matt Crill</span></b> At this point, all of the East was moving in like vultures! I was especially disappointed by <span class="russia">Farren</span>'s betrayal here since I believed there were still good opportunities to help her have the upper hand against IT.
<br> France had started applying pressure and Serbia was vulnerable with the discussed plan being to get the Gal army into Rumania. I was willing to focus on helping Russia grow as my only friend in the East but I understand the change in direction. However, I do believe this was a key turn that mainly helped Italy instead of Russia.
<br> Retreating to Rum was my only choice and the end was clearly near...
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> S03: <span class="russia">Farren</span> convinces me she's not moving to BAL, so I rearrange pieces to try and make it as hard as possible for EF to get through.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> I will say, I didn't actually want that army in Moscow. I thought it was going to bounce against a supported English attack.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> An EF would have been nice at this point.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> <span class="england">Nicolas</span> was obviously playing the long game: Securing StP, getting a build, before deciding on the next target. He would however soon get a rude awakening.

<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Fall 03, <span class="germany">Peter</span>'s master stroke. Instead of England capturing StP, he loses Nwy instead without even a fleet in Ska, but with the aid of the Russian army under attack. Elsewhere Turkey convinces Austria to jump start his rise at the detriment of Russia while Italy stands by. What was going on backstage?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> This turn, <span class="england">Nicolas</span> and I agreed that he should get a build. <span class="england">Nicolas</span> wanted to take StP.

</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> By this time, relations with <span class="russia">Farren</span> had completely fallen apart but I finally had the upper hand. I wanted to make sure I got both Sev and Bul so I asked Austria to support me in. My pitch to him was I would eventually hurt Italy, which was his main goal at this point.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> I think as my army builds show at this point I was in just "survive against the Italy/Turkey alliance" mode. I continued to try to talk Italy into flipping on Turkey but <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> is correct that he and I had very little to discuss at this point.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> In other words, credits for planning the attack on Nwy go to <span class="russia">Farren</span>. Shame on me for believing too much the commentators on the DBN broadcast. It made Germany the board leader though and in this respect it was a high point for <span class="germany">Peter</span>. Plus we now know why <span class="france">Bill</span> was never informed of any such plans. His France was the original target!
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> I needed a friend in the north and <span class="germany">Peter</span> seemed like a good option for that friend.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> My main effort at this point was in trying to work something out with <span class="italy">Maxim</span>.  There was no way for us to crack into Germany, and <span class="germany">Peter</span>'s fleets and units were clearly not moving in a friendly direction toward <span class="england">Nicolas</span>.  I seem to remember this was when <span class="england">Nicolas</span> and I regretted not attacking <span class="germany">Peter</span> earlier.
<br> I would be curious as to what "principled resolution" I was offering <span class="italy">Maxim</span> at this juncture.  Hindsight will show whether it was truly principled and balanced, or just a negotiated solution that would be to my benefit alone!
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> I was stalemated in the Med with an offer from <span class="france">Bill</span> to leave Tunis to him while I force Vienna and Greece. I didn't want to give up Tunis, but I think I probably should have taken the deal. I think I could have taken Tunis back later anyway. At this point, I should have been crawling my fleet in Nap somewhere and have no idea why I didn't. In the East, I could have taken Bud as well even if I had not accepted <span class="france">Bill</span>'s offer, which would also have been a great help as I could have stalemated the Med while still getting somewhere elsewhere. This was pretty much a wasted turn of missed opportunities for me.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> This rings true. This wasn’t the turn you agreed to it and then did something different, right? That came later?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> Honestly, I am not sure which one that was. There were a lot of such turns.

</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> I knew I had no chance of holding Bulgaria so I figured I'd just retreat back to Gal. It would also bounce Vie if it for some reason decided to go for Gal. Mos to Sev was intended to bounce a convoyed army if Turkey went for it. In the north my memory is starting to get pretty fuzzy but I believe my moves were coordinated with Germany.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> <span class="russia">Farren</span> - What about War to Lvn? An argument could be made for War to Ukr instead.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> I considered the South lost. I told Turkey I was backing off in hopes that he would go elsewhere when faced with a bunch of armies in the Russian heartland that will be hard to dislodge. It also gave me a unit to support Stp with and to try to convoy over if my fleet move didn't go through.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> The moves in Scandanavia were all coordinated with <span class="russia">Farren</span>. The plan is to give up NWY to Russia in order to take NTH and remove the Russian fleet from threatening BAL.

<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> That's right.

<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> Yeah, the Med was stuck with both of us suffering for it. Again, I should have taken <span class="france">Bill</span>'s offer earlier. I don't recall if my purpose for helping Austria was a friendly Austria or easier centers in Vienna and Budapest, but it was probably one of the two. With my wasted turns, <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> was growing far too fast for my liking and I wanted to see some gains myself.

<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Fall and Winter of 04. While England, Austria and Russia get pounded, Italy, Germany and Turkey make significant advances. And France, you ask?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> I was in a bad place. Fortunately, EG were locked in conflict. Otherwise, I might have been eliminated in 2 game years.

</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> My moves were pretty simple. I coordinated with Germany to put me into Norway and I pulled Lvn to Mos to present a stronger front against the Italian/Turkish alliance to the south. I pulled Stp because I didn't want to get rid of the fleet or weaken my position in the south.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> I continued to push hard against Russia while trying to keep my relationship with Italy solid. I also asked Austria to support me into Ionian so he wouldn't tap Bulgaria. I also tried to encourage <span class="france">Bill</span> to do something about Germany's position.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> My moves w.r.t Russia/England were the continuation of the plan hatched in Spring. At some point (I forget exactly which turn, it could've been this one), <span class="france">Bill</span> came to me lobbying for me to order to TYR.

<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> I believe I told <span class="france">Bill</span> I would take his deal, giving up Tunis, if he didn't bounce me in Piedmont. I then bounced Tunis but still took 2 centers in the East.

<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> These seem to be pretty intense rounds with all that's going on on the board. But if everyone sticks to their plans, is there really a lot to discuss? How hectic were the negotiations at this point?

<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> Not hectic for me. I was working with Germany and asking Italy to flip on Turkey.

<br> I figured at this point, if <span class="italy">Maxim</span> got tussled up with Turkey and I grew off of my neighbors, either <span class="italy">Maxim</span> or I would win this thing. We’ll see what happens next, won’t we.

<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> This was definitely the low moment in the alliance.

<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> I think this moment was when I blew an opportunity. I didn't actually expect Italy to cooperate with me so I hedged my bets and slipped into Vienna. Which, unfortunately, also ruined any trust that might have led to a more stable anti-Turk alliance.

Germany was broken and Russia could not withstand against an IT.  So, I either work with England or make a go for him.  There was an opportunity in LVP that he left open to me ... but let's see if <span class="england">Nicolas</span> covers.

<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> It is not that I dont want to comment but I dont really remember the game anymore and don't really feel revisiting that bad game (for me). Until now (the moment I get BEL), I played just badly with the moves that cost me NWY being the worst of the worst. At that point in the game, I was feeling lucky that everyone had turned on <span class="germany">Peter</span> and I was trying to survive, get people involved elsewhere and hope to salvage a half-decent result. The bounce in ENG was the result of <span class="germany">Peter</span> wanting me to support myself to ENG and <span class="france">Bill</span> wanting me to move east. I thought it was a compromise while my other units were doing a whole bunch of nothing.

<blockquote><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Spring 07. England finally starts to take part in the action, while Italy allows Turkey to expand and France narrowly escapes from getting trapped in Kiel. Meanwhile discussions are ... cooling down?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> The writing started to appear on the wall of how this was all going to end. I was dealing with an all out assault from <span class="italy">Maxim</span> and was unable to do very much other than deny him any gains.
<br> On top boards, I feel that you need to balance alliance play with balance of power play - which can be super hard when you’ve been going toe-to-toe with an aggressive neighbor (me).  I tried to pitch this concept to <span class="italy">Maxim</span>, through the whole range of negotiation tactics, but I failed to convince him that - in this situation - I could be trusted more than <span class="turkey">Morgante</span>.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> Discussions were very much becoming settled at this point. My big regret is not moving Nwy to Ska to bounce that move but it wouldn't have changed much in the long run I think.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Is <span class="russia">Farren</span>'s sentiment shared across the board?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> At some point, <span class="italy">Maxim</span> made the decision to preserve his overall finish rather than risk losing places. This is a decision I wish I had made on other top boards (Marseilles, for example) and did here at one point. I whipped out a calculator and figured out I needed X and <span class="russia">Farren</span> needed to be Y and offered to get <span class="england">Nicolas</span> whatever we could as long as I “got mine.”  I think once we’ve reached that point in the narrative, we might have wrapped this up.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> By this point, things seemed pretty locked in. I had a strong ally in <span class="italy">Maxim</span> who had accepted he wasn't going to top, so it was mostly a matter of tactically pushing for as many centers as I could to assure myself the top.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> Yeah, the only drama left in the game was whether <span class="france">Bill</span> or I would get 3rd overall in the tournament and <span class="france">Bill</span> had <span class="england">Nicolas</span> on his side for that.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> At this point I was still trying for a chance at the top through keeping <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> happy while hoping to somehow find a way into French dots. I didn't think it was likely but I thought I had a better shot there than anywhere else. It was only after my failed guesses a year or two later that I didn't see a way there and had my goal change to getting as high of a score in the tournament that I could, which was staying on 3+ dots or getting some really high count that I wasn't going to get.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> I think I then publicly announced there was no way that <span class="italy">Maxim</span> would get a French dot. It took some clever maneuvering and an uncharacteristic throwing of dots on my part, but I “pulled it off.”
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> I think I had a guess on one later on, but I am not certain so I guess we will see later
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> Oh, as you'll soon learn, when <span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span> is pulling the strings, there's no guessing to be had!

<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> The turn of my resurrection as Doug Moore put it. I don't remember exactly my negotiation with <span class="germany">Peter</span>.

Then, <span class="germany">Peter</span> proposed to support me into SWE, I took the support and started thinking whether I should still go for HOL or not.

I could have kept <span class="germany">Peter</span> on my side and <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> may have not reached WAR and MOS in that scenario.

</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> Bouncing the move to Lvn ended up being pretty critical here as it ensured I could take Warsaw and consolidate my control of the Russian centers (besides StP).

</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> IMO The move for <span class="italy">Maxim</span> was to try to take Spain or Marseilles with an army.  Anything else would be indefensible.

</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> I think if I convoy to Spain here I have a guess to keep it or get MAO, but anything else here doesn't get me anywhere with this set of defensive moves.

<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> I'm just trying to cling to my little space of dirt. This turn England was my friend.

<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> I was really hoping that <span class="italy">Maxim</span> would win his guessing game and be able to take centers in France.

<br> I remember the stream in which Ed was saying that <span class="france">Bill</span> was really the leader in our conversations on how to set up the best moves against <span class="italy">Maxim</span>. Now you know why!
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> Hmmm .... that is interesting to hear.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> If <span class="italy">Maxim</span> gets SPA and builds at home, I might have won the game. But I had not cultivated my relationship with <span class="italy">Maxim</span> during the game and I felt that I was not going to convince him with one text message. I should have talked to him every turn after my "resurrection". But I didn't. Lack of energy is my excuse but bad play on my part overall.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> Let's be honest ... if you had been talking with <span class="italy">Maxim</span> every turn instead of lock-stepping with me, I would have probably not been as "on side."  And, if <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> saw coordination between you and his "partner," things probably work out differently in the East and he plays more aggressive (which he could have done).
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> At least a bit of talk and maybe some messaging... But yes, that was the problem, how to play it both ways and that's why in the end I did not pick that path. But that was my only hope.
<br> The blocked convoy to LVN finished my hopes to win the race. So I had to play dirty. Messaging <span class="italy">Maxim</span> to convoy to SPA may have worked. But most probably not. But you don't win if you don't take all your chances.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> Your only hope was to drive a wedge between <span class="italy">Maxim</span> and <span class="turkey">Morgante</span>.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> Tbh, I am still not sure what I should have done, but I believe that was not a 0% position.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> I'm not sure a build for <span class="italy">Maxim</span> would have done that for you. &#128530;
<br> But, you're right - it's not a 0%
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> Maybe I could have sold a "I give you a chance to stick it to France, and you give me a chance to top!" But with no talking to <span class="italy">Maxim</span>, I did not know if he was more into punishing <span class="france">Bill</span> or rewarding <span class="turkey">Morgante</span>. Lack of diplomatic talks always hurts. But doing all that without <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> and <span class="france">Bill</span> knowing is tough...
<br> Anyway, after i saw that he gave up TRI, I was glad that I did not help him against France as he had already decided the endgame. But I believe that my lack of negotiating in 1907-1908 with <span class="italy">Maxim</span> cost me the small chances that I had left.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Interesting discussion. Although <span class="france">Bill</span> now understandably argues against it, it seems clear that he might well have been blindsided had such an information leak taken place.

<b><span class="italy">Maxim Popov</span></b> As I understand it both sides had the same reasoning.

<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> Well, there’s always the human. Plus I’ve known <span class="england">Nicolas</span> for years. If I have the dots that can give him a chance to win and I can’t stop him, I’m better off negotiating with him on the “how and when” rather than the “if he should or shouldn’t.”
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> From my perspective: in my discussions with <span class="france">Bill</span> around 1907 we were trying to find a way to give us both chances to top the board. When <span class="italy">Maxim</span> decided to send everything at <span class="france">Bill</span>, it was clear that <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> was the favorite and that <span class="france">Bill</span> could not grow and at the same time defend against me and <span class="italy">Maxim</span>. That's when he decided to make sure that I would help him finish 3rd of the tournament. that meant for me not to eliminate him and not to keep <span class="russia">Farren</span> alive. Initially, he had told me that 11-6-0  was the way to go (me 2nd and him 3rd and the maths checked out and <span class="russia">Farren</span> 4th). But then in 1909, he told me that 14-3 was still good enough for him to pass <span class="russia">Farren</span> (I had not checked those numbers). So, I went for the greedy grabs.

<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> I am not sure that <span class="france">Bill</span> would have accepted the move to POR as he risks finishing at 2, but I should have tried that. I am more and more realizing that after a few hours in front of the screen my brain really does not work very well. That was not as bad as the DBNI top board, but still...
<br> MUN is at risk so things are not that simple, but yes it looks like this would have given me a chance.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> Yeah, my moves were also clearly not optimal as well. Obviously should have gone to Sev.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> I would not have been as cooperative had you done a move like that.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> I need your help to convoy to POR, since MAO is your fleet.
<br> I had not considered it at the time, just revisiting the position with fresh eyes. Was there a way? I guess that BUR-RUH with the moves to get guesses around WAR/MOS were the best try. At least I would have made <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> work for it.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Fascinating alternative. But personal goals aside it does again highlight Turkey's superior position, as he would always have been able to claim more centers than England if their allies simply walked out.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> When you start growing in 1906, you are not the favorite to outrace the rest of the board. &#128518;

<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> The final turn. Shopping time. The top two grab everything on the shelves. Lots of unused units bouncing on Alb, just for fun. When the final tally is made, they both end equal. The tie breaker being the reverse order in which powers were chosen, means <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> wins the game. Of course, everyone knew that going into this turn. What hopes or anxieties were there?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="turkey">Morgante Pell</span></b> I had some minor fear that <span class="italy">Maxim</span> might have a last minute change of heart and block me out of one of his centers, but thankfully my anxieties didn’t materialize.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> This really was a well played board by all and I was happy that things, and the tournament in general, had gone so well.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> I just wanted to end in a tie so I could complain about losing on tie break. &#128518;
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Thank you all for your cooperation. Any final thoughts about the game as a whole?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="england">Nicolas Sahuguet</span></b> <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> was just a bit more masterful than <span class="england">Nicolas</span>. &#128555;
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="russia">Farren Jane</span></b> I really regret picking Russia. I hadn't been following the tournament and didn't realize that every Russia was having a horrible day. I had fun though!
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="germany">Peter McNamara</span></b> I was very surprised when I heard that Russia had such a bad tournament (especially considering in my three qualifying games they went 0,9,9). I don't think this is relevant for the top board though - I think meta on top boards is often independent of trends within the tounament.
<br> Fall 06: I guess wrong in Scandanavia and for some reason cover DEN from KIE? That's a strange choice because of the French army in RUH, and it ends up costing me dearly.
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="master">Mario Huys</span></b> Why not simply blame Russia for a bad stab that severely backfired and eventually saw you both eliminated?
</p><p class="comment">
<b><span class="france">Bill Hackenbracht</span></b> This was the culmination of three long days of virtual Diplomacy and while the game was stressful and tempers flared, at the end of the day there were no lingering hard feelings.  And while not everyone was happy with their result - I believe that we can all agree that <span class="turkey">Morgante</span> and <span class="england">Nicolas</span> played masterful games and deserved the split top.  For many players, it was their first live top-board.  Probably all of us, if given the chance, would do at least one or two things differently but hindsight always has a way of revealing better moves or negotiation tactics.  And making the top board in a 100-person tournament is a real accomplishment all in its own.  All-in-all, I feel that this game was a fitting end to the largest live event in over a decade and was a watershed for the genre of virtual Diplomacy.  Next year's winter event, which will be the Virtual Diplomacy Championship (VDC), will hopefully have 1.5-2 times the number of players.  And I hope that in the years to come, VDC top boards deliver entertainment on par with this one.
