<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
When Diplomacy was first introduced, the intended form of play was face-to-face
(FTF).  As the game picked up a larger and larger following, postal
'zines started popping up all over the world and the postal Diplomacy hobby
evolved.  More recently, the computer age entered the game (or rather, the
game entered the computer age) and the Internet play-by-email (PBEM) hobby
emerged.  The Diplomacy hobby now consists of these three communities, which
exist with some amount of overlap and varying degrees of polarization in
their membership.
<p>
Most Diplomacy players who are active in the hobby
realize that the postal Diplomacy community is rather extensive and includes
players in countries across the globe.  However, many of them may not realize
the extent of the PBEM Diplomacy hobby.  For them, we present a few starting
facts and statistics.
<p>
Most PBEM Diplomacy games are played using computers
referred to as "judges," which run software that accepts electronic mail
from players.  The judge machines not only serve as a middleman, allowing
players to send messages to other players, but it also receives and automatically
adjudicates submitted orders.  Games may run in real time but more typically
run at a rate of one season to one game-year per week.  At the time of this
writing, there are about ten judges running; over 5400 people have registered
with the most-highly-played judge (although, admittedly, many of them are
no longer actively playing); over 1400 games have been completed using the
PBEM judges and there are well over 450 games currently in progress; many
more games have been played by e-mail informally without use of the judges.
<p>
These statistics should give you a feeling for the size of the PBEM Diplomacy hobby.  This paper, however, does not focus on PBEM Diplomacy,
but rather on an even more recent development in computer technology -- the world wide web -- and its current and potential impact on all the communities
which comprise the Diplomacy hobby.
<p>
<b>The World Wide Web</b>
<p>
This
section gives a brief introduction to the world wide web for those who are
completely unfamiliar with it.  Those who do not fall into this category
may wish to skip to the <A HREF="#next">next section</a>.
<p>
In the beginning
there was the computer, and it connected merely to the wall socket which
provided it with the electricity which is its lifeblood.  Then, sometime
long ago, someone got the idea of connecting two computers to a telephone
line and letting them phone each other and exchange information. But the
world was slow and without form, so, although it was good, it wasn't good
enough.  Technology advanced, and computers began to be able to transmit
and receive information more quickly.  The administrators of a bunch of
military computers got together and decided to break with tradition and
never hang up on each other.  They bought what the telephone companies call
"leased lines" and connected all their computers to each other on
forever-active telephone wire.
<p>
All of a sudden, a computer that was connected (even
by a temporary, soon-to-be-hung-up phone call) to just one of these "networked"
computers could, through the magic of computer communications, send a message
almost instantaneously to any other computer that was on the network.  First
universities and then the real world looked at what the military had done and
decided that they wanted some of this too.  Soon enough, thousands and
thousands of computers were added to the network, now known as the Internet, and
the telephone companies had a field day, making money hand over fist.
<p>
People began to realize that being connected to almost any computer in the
world suddenly made it possible to provide information to the largest audience
ever assembled.  Various forms of electronic publishing were proposed as means
by which information could be put on one computer and requested, located, and
displayed by any other.  The winning information format turned out to be a
language called HTML, the HyperText Markup Language.  Information which is
written in HTML and put on a networked computer in specified locations can not
only be found by any number of publicly available "search engines" but also
displayed in highly readable, attractive, graphical, and "hotlinked" form
(meaning that the document can itself provide "links" -- ways for the reader
to jump immediately by the click of a mouse -- to yet other HTML documents on
any machine, anywhere).  The race then became one to develop the best HTML
browser (i.e. display program), and Netscape Corporation won that battle. Now
it's Netscape which is making money hand over fist.
<p>
The objective behind the development of the world wide web was to come up with
a new way to deliver information using computers.  The key idea here is
delivery.  Before the advent of the world wide web, electronic information
existed in various places but it always had to be retrieved through a variety
of mechanisms such as by typing an "address" that referred to an electronic
document, by copying a file from an electronic archive, or by sending an
e-mail request to have a document sent.  Furthermore, delivery of information
over the web avoids several drawbacks associated with previous distribution
mechanisms by reducing publication time and effort, eliminating the need for
maintaining subscriber lists as well as copying and mailing costs, saving resources by not having to replicate information for each interested person, etc.
Several of these drawbacks apply not only to information distributed on
paper, but to electronic media as well.
<p>
The primary innovations brought
to the mainstream through the web are (1) the use of links to remotely located
files, which can be located in a document and replace manually typed addresses,
(2) local display of information that may be located remotely (without having
to make a local copy) and (3) the HTML language which is used to create web documents (these documents are referred to as pages though they are usually be more than a page long when printed). This language allows web
pages to contain not just plain text, but text formatting, layout formatting,
graphics, links to other pages and more.
<p>
The world wide web consists
of literally tens of millions of pages distributed across several hundreds
of thousands of sites.  Pages exist on virtually any topic you can think
of, from sports to movies to sex to people: everything from aardvarks to
zoology, including, of course, Diplomacy. Not surprisingly, with this amount
of information available, people began to assemble information on a given
topic to make access easier.  The most common form of this is called the
home page, that is, the home for information on a topic.  Along with all
the lesser-important people/places/things such as
<a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/"><b>McDonald's</b></a>,
<a href="http://www.ibm.com/"><b>IBM</b></a>,
<a href="http://www.nbc.com/"><b>NBC
Television</b></a>, and <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/"><b>the White
House</b></a>, <a href="../../../"><b>Diplomacy</b></a> has a home page of its own.
<p>
<A NAME="next"></a>
<b>Diplomacy on the Web</b>
<p>
The page which follows shows the front page of the Diplomacy home page [<i>see
the <a href="../../..">real front page</a> instead of figure</i>], which
is called <a href="../../..">The Diplomatic Pouch</a> (located at <a href="../../.."><tt>http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch</tt></a>).
 Links to other pages are indicated by underlined text.  For example, clicking
your mouse while the pointer is over <a href="../../../Online"><b>online
resources</b></a> takes you to a web page which fronts the online resources
section of The Diplomatic Pouch; clicking on <a href="../../../reviews"><b>accolades</b></a>
takes you to a page which lists some reviews of The Pouch, and some awards
which it has received.  The graphic icons on the page are also links, so
that clicking on the <a href="../../../Welcome.html"><b>i</b></a> icon brings
up a page that gives some background information about The Pouch, while clicking on one of the six larger pencil-sketch icons below takes you to
any of the six main sections of The Pouch.
<p>
So what?  One of the sections
of The Diplomatic Pouch happens to be a 'zine that you view on the computer
instead of on paper.  It looks nice with those graphics and all, but how
is this different from, say, opening a file using a word processor?  As mentioned earlier, what's new is the access to and the method of delivery
of information.  One difference is that the information medium is not linear,
as it is with a word processing file.  For instance, you can read the sixth
article in the 'zine without reading or even scrolling past the first five.
 Another difference is that a reader can browse through and selectively read the 'zine without having to download a potentially large file to do
so.  But these are relatively small differences.  The distributed nature
of information actually has a much greater impact; of much greater significance
is the fact that the web provides instant access to distributed, remotely
located information.
<p>
<b>A Virtual Repository</b>
<p>
Even the use of
the 'zine as an example does not truly illustrate the advantages of access
to distributed information.  Let's instead consider the online resources
section of The Pouch.  The online resources section provides links to over
fifty information sources at over twenty sites spanning nine countries.  From that page, a user is one or two mouse clicks from just about any Diplomacy-related
information available on the Internet, including introductory information
for new players, articles on strategy and improving your game, dozens of
maps for many variants, Diplomacy statistics, reference materials, a half
dozen electronic 'zines and much more.
<p>
This section really is a virtual
repository.  That is, to the user it seems that all that information is available in one place, separated by nothing more than a click of the mouse.
 With the world wide web, access to all this distributed information is seamless.  Aside from an occasional small delay associated with data transfers,
there is nothing to indicate to the user this file is stored in Japan and
that one in Germany.  But having links to all of that information is entirely
different from actually having it all in one place.  The cost and effort
involved with storing and maintaining all that information, and the logistics
of providing access to maintainers would pose a tremendous barrier to that.
 By distributing information, the associated time and costs are distributed
as well .
<p>
<b>The New Nature of Information</b>
<p>
Another feature of
the world wide web is that it removes one of the major boundaries associated
with storing information: its static nature.  When information is archived,
it generally remains in the same state in which it was left.  The fact that
information on the web is distributed allows it to be separately and individually
maintained and updated as necessary.  Some information does not require updating and does remain static.  However, other information may need to
be updated periodically (either at fixed intervals or whenever necessary)
to reflect evolving information on a topic, in this case Diplomacy.  The
update interval can be as long as months or as short as hours: the 'zine
section of The Diplomatic Pouch is updated only five times per year when
a new issue comes out, and at the other extreme, a web-provided list of openings in PBEM games (linked to from The Pouch but provided by a hobbyist
whose computer resides in Norway) is updated every two hours.
<p>
The undesirable
solution to information updating, which was common before the web came about,
was for people to have to re-retrieve files whenever they wanted to make
sure they had the latest version, or to make a "mass-mailing" to all interested
parties whenever information was updated.  Using the web as an information
distribution mechanism, people always have the latest information available.
 Because information that is accessible by everyone is stored in only one
location, it only needs to be updated once, making it simple to ensure that
up-to-date information is available to everyone.  No more out-of-date paper
copies.
<p>
<b>Bridging the Gap</b>
<p>
An interesting consequence of the
world wide web is that this new information medium is creating an interface
between the FTF, PBEM and postal Diplomacy communities.  There can be considerable
overlap between members of these communities.  People who have access to
the world wide web typically have it through a major online service (such
as CompuServe or America Online), a smaller Internet service provider, or
through an Internet account obtained through an employer or, for many students,
a university.  While people who play PBEM Diplomacy have, by necessity, access to the Internet, there are many more people who have access to the
web who do not play PBEM Diplomacy.  The world wide web can serve as an information source for anyone with access to the web, regardless of which
community they belong to.
<p>
With this objective in mind, sections within
The Diplomatic Pouch were created specifically to serve each of these communities.
 The Face-to-Face section provides (among other things) information about
past and upcoming conventions and tournaments for the FTF Diplomacy community;
the Postal section contains a links to electronic copies of lists of player
openings for North American and European postal 'zines; the PBEM section
includes links to information about how to get started playing Diplomacy
by email using the judges.  And in addition, there is in The Diplomatic Pouch a wealth of information that may be of interest to any hobbyist, for
instance links in the 'zine and online resources sections to articles on
Diplomacy strategy, a library of openings, variant descriptions and maps,
and other electronic 'zines.
<p>
An interesting example of bridging the gap between communities is the Backseat Driver Variant.  This variant was
first played by electronic mail, and first described in full in an article
in The Diplomatic Pouch 'zine. This article was read by a person involved
with the postal Diplomacy hobby, who then adapted the variant for postal
play, after which it was published in the postal 'zine Dipsomania.  Since
a significant percentage of the subscribers of Dipsomania are presumably
not part of the PBEM community, the world wide web enabled the bringing of this variant to a group of people who otherwise would most likely never
have heard of it.  There are several other variants, such as modern and hundred, which have been played primarily by e-mail but may find themselves
filtering out into the FTF and postal Diplomacy communities via the web.
<p>
<b>Conclusions and Outlook for the Future</b>
<p>
From the discussion
above, it is clear that the Diplomacy hobby already has benefited greatly
by the advances in computer networking.  It should also be clear that there
appears to be no limit to these benefits.  Electronic communication has enabled people from across the globe to create alliances and stab each other
in the backs every day, and the advent of the web has enabled the fast-growing
hobby to be well-served by easy access to a huge and ever-expanding pool
of resource information.
<p>
The play of Diplomacy will soon be brought to yet another new forum.  From face-to-face, to the corner mailbox, to the electronic mailbox, and soon to the web itself, where web pages will
do everything for the game player, even up to presenting modifiable planning
maps to each player.  Each new arrow he or she draws using the mouse will
be available to an ally instantly. Communication, negotiation, and yes, deception and chicanery via the medium of the web page is just around the
corner.  And wherever the next corner lies, the Diplomacy hobby is sure to be there to take advantage of it.  After all, it is in our nature to take advantage and exploit new opportunities, is it not?
