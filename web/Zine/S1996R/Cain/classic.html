<p>
Diplomacy is by all measures a brutal game, where attacks are often
taken personally (because they may very well be personal) and revenge
is only available to the skilled.  Persuading and deceiving while
guarding against falling victim to the same requires control and
perception. 
Opponents must be quickly evaluated and manipulated using subtle tools
of psychology, combined with strategic and tactical ability.  Mistakes
are often fatal, and grossly humiliating.
<P>
But Diplomacy where opponents never return for a re-match introduces
a final period problem which distorts the control required of a
practical diplomat.  Anyone who has ever made an enemy knows that they
don't simply go away; worse yet, they take pleasure in harassment
and spoiling.  A serious diplomat knows that the best way to deal
with an enemy is to never make one.  But alas, no greater challenge
confronts an aspiring diplomat than trying to placate a Diplomacy player who
has unexpectedly surrendered four centers to your greedy hordes.  A 
diplomat who can accomplish that feat is formidible indeed.  
<P>
I have played Diplomacy for five years now with the community called
Cat23.  Human GM's, weekly turns and a fairly steady membership of
about thirty active players provide an enviroment which many
believe constitutes the best forum, bar none, for facing
diplomatic intrigues of that extreme level.
<P>
When most people speak of Play-by-Electronic-Mail (PBEM) Diplomacy,
they are referring to playing on one of the many Internet judges.
Aside from the use of e-mail to communicate with the other players,
our style of play in the Cat23 community has little in common with
judge PBEM.  What we call "Classic PBEM"
is really more akin to PBM Diplomacy, but at a faster pace.
<P>
As a dynamic group of players and volunteer GM's, a community provides
long-term diplomatic relations which creates a heightened sense of
accountability both in and out of games.  We play against each other
and GM for each other with a regularity that forces consideration of
our fragile reputations when making any move.  As such, NMR's are
infrequent, as are dropouts, and substitute players are not only
easily found, but players actually compete for the chance to be a
replacement.  (After all, there are few easier ways to accumulate
political capital than stepping into a dying spot.)  A game rarely
stalls for more than six hours -- no time at all in the weekly-turn time
frame.
<P>
Playing against some of the same players frequently -- mixed in with a
few new players at the same time -- takes the diplomacy conducted to a
higher level, as the styles and quirks of opponents are taken into
account when framing correspondence and making plans.  We know
something about our opponents, and we use what we know against them,
revealing ourselves in the process.  
<P>
We also pay close attention to what goes on in the other games 
being played simultaneously in the community -- watching players
who may someday be our opponents, cheering on the sudden demise of an
old arch-rival.  Peanut gallery commentary raises the stakes of the
games and heightens the awareness that the game is a community
activity, and that poor play or poor sportmanship will be noticed not
only by the opponents, but by the entire group.
<P>
Orders are collected by human GM's, who take responsibility for
setting and enforcing deadlines, adjudication and posting the
results.   Human adjudication means that variants can be played, and
even created on the fly, merely by agreement of the players.  More
significantly, the players are required to correspond weekly with the
GM, which fosters relationships on that level.  This player-GM
connection makes NMR's and drop-outs a personal affront to the person
running the game, and reduces those discourtesies even further.
<P>
Cat23 plays Diplomacy with one week seasons -- orders are usually due
on Saturday
night, with summer/winter seasons falling on Monday night.  While this
pace may seem slow to those accustomed to the usual 24 hour to three-day
pace of judge
play, and while it may seem quick to postal players, the period has become
one of the hallmarks of
our play.  A week is sufficient time for otherwise occupied players
(i.e., with jobs) to exchange a half-dozen letters to cement plans with
an ally, and two or three letters with every other power.  No stone
goes unturned at this pace, and because the correspondence can be so
heavy, relationships become highly personal, and emotions run strong
when stabs fall.  When one game reaches a quiet endgame, with little
to be said, weekly turns permit joining multiple games with reduced
risk of over-commitment in any one week.
<P>
We are able to play at this pace because of the dedication of the
group -- while new players arrive constantly, some moving along after a
game or two, many remain to play for years and years. We enforce
deadlines and other rules strictly, which appeals to people serious
enough about the hobby to stick with a game until the bitter end,
despite the fact that they have only had one army for six months,
real-time.
<P>
To support our group we have established two specialized listservers
and a growing network of web pages.  The whole community is
exceedingly vocal and has developed a system of play which fosters
excellent Diplomacy, and a strong comeraderie.  The members of Cat23
are among my very best friends, because I respect their skill,
repartee, intellect, and (not least of all) their dedication to the greatest of
games.  On the other hand, I know better than to trust any of them
with an open supply center. Friendship only goes so far.
