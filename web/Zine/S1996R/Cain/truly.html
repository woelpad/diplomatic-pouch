A young diplomat plays a worn card: "Don't take it personally," he
advises, "it's only a game."  If he embraces that position, I've won. 
Diplomacy is only a game, but no game could be more personal.  His
denial of that aspect will give me an edge, as I strive to make the
game as personal as I can.
<p>
Playing skilled Diplomacy lies in the evaluation of the ability,
intentions, and motivations of opponents.  Using this knowledge,
trust is created, strained, and manipulated to achieve strategic 
goals.  The trust involved is not the na&iuml;ve trust of a child for the 
mother, but instead a trust of affection and respect based on 
estimations of the predictability and reasonable self-interest of 
people placed in a situation with opposing goals -- listening with 
swords drawn and with no particular reason to believe.
<p>
To claim this process is at all impersonal suggests that you may as
well begin each correspondence with the greeting, "Dear Enemy."  However,
a diplomat does not
win by reminding foes that the ultimate goal is to destroy them, but
by persuading opponents that there is a common vision of the future,
and that perhaps this diplomat could let affection cloud strategic
decisions -- to produce that same error in the opponent.  As ugly as
it may seem to an outsider, the diplomat creates friendships so that
they may be taken advantage of.

<p>
A diplomat is attempting to create a personal rapport with foes, who 
come in all shapes and sizes.  For one opponent, a personal 
relationship comes from knowing that a curly-headed young man with 
three kids and a cat is sitting at his computer after eating a good 
leg-of-lamb.  Another opponent is drawn into personal relations by 
the common fiction of nineteenth century personas speaking regally 
and passionately of European politics.  Part of the skill of the 
diplomat is making that quick assessment, and using each foe's quirks 
as a tool of persuasion.
<p>
Diplomacy must be conducted on a personal level because there is no
definitive strategy defined by the map which compels any choice of
alliances.  When England chooses Germany over France, it probably
isn't because of geography, but because the PM "believes" that the
Kaiser will make a "better" ally.  If there were a quanititative
method for making those evaluations, the game would be different -- as
it is, diplomats choose an ally because they like that ally better
than another.  One may like another because he shows more skill in
forming tactical plans, or because he is simply more eloquent. 
But, when one is betrayed, there is no recourse to some rule which demands
that an ally be chosen for one skill over another -- a diplomat must,
essentially, be well liked.

<p>
PB(E)M Diplomacy is conducted by letters, each of which consists of
a greeting, a body and a signature.  Since the first shall be last,
I'll begin with an analysis of the final word.
<p>
Many Latin languages have two forms of the word "You" -- a formal 
impersonal form and a a familiar form.  It can be offensive to call a 
person by the wrong one, depending on their concept of the 
relationship.  It can, furthermore, be meaningful to choose one over 
the other, particularly when intended to effect a change in the 
relationship; for example, "I have decided I like you and will therefore 
become familiar," or "You have offended me, and I consider you no 
longer a friend."
<p>
A signature involves the same type of decision, except that instead
of only two forms, there are dozens which are possible.  With each signature
the diplomat expresses an indication of the perceived relationship to 
either convey or intimate the desired state of affairs. 
<p>
By way of example, when I play Diplomacy, I invariably choose a
persona.  For France, my favorite is Cardinal Richelieu+ - Dumas'
Musketeers being a favorite of mine (an excellent novel of diplomacy,
by the way).  As Richelieu+ I will speak for France, Louis, and God in my
attempts to persuade the Kings and Empresses of my vision of
Europe's Destiny.
<p>
With initial correspondence to unknown opponents, I will sign my
letters "Cardinal Richelieu+" gently hinting that familiarity will
at least require a response, and setting a level of respect that
comes from titles.  This signature becomes my formal signature, and
is used to express distance or offense.  I rarely use it after the
first letter, unless I am challenging, threatening or condemning.
<p>
Some players will respond with personas, making references to the 
fiction of Diplomacy.  For them, I sign my letters "Richelieu+" and 
play the game in full costume.
<p>
Other players will reply by signing their letters with their real name.  
It is always dangerous to speak to someone of that nature with the 
cover of a persona always overriding the flavor of letters.  A mask is 
a mask and gives reason to doubt the sincerity of the writer, 
especially when set in the circumstance of dubious moves and other 
players who are not wearing masks.
<p>
On the other hand, I am wary of attaching my own name, which I
cannot drop so easily, from the sometimes inevitable nastiness of
Diplomacy. When a player shows no taste for the persona, I maintain
a strong modern discourse in the body of my letters, while allowing
myself the tiny indulgence of signing "Richelieu+".  I am careful to
call no attention to the signature under normal circumstances.  When
the stab comes, I'll hope they will only remember that it was that
cruel churchman whose real name has been lost in the transom of
time.
<p>
There comes a time in every Diplomacy game, however, when all the 
cards are on the table and a diplomat has no choice but to call in 
every favor, every sympathy, and every trick in their book.  One way 
of showing sincerity under these conditions is to sign a passionate, 
modern, personal communication with an unthinking "David" - showing 
that I have forgotten that this is only a game, and that the results 
of the turn really matter to <strong>me</strong>.  It is a small thing, but the 
sudden contrast created by abandoning a carefully maintained persona 
may be enough to let the personal air cloud the opposition's 
judgement.
<p>
It is true that aside from persuading, a signature can also reveal 
the attitude of the diplomat, and for this reason some would advocate 
choosing a signature and never changing a letter -- a diplomatic poker 
face.
<p>
For instance, if a diplomat signs every letter to an ally with his 
own name and suddenly adopts a formal signature, the ally might 
suspect that a stab is coming, and the diplomat is trying to create 
distance before the betrayal comes down.  That would be an imprudent 
use of signature.
<p>
But persuasion often depends on the risk of revelation.  A carefully
manipulated signature, used conscious of the effect it has, may
work subtle differences into an opponents attitude.
