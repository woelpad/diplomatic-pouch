Normally, when one thinks of the mechanics of Diplomacy, what 
comes to mind is negotiations and tactics. There is however
a third, and very important aspect. The relationships built up
between the players plays a very important role in how each player 
forms a decision. While this process is involved in all games to
some extent, it is most easily observed in the Club (sometimes called
Classic) style of play as opposed to the "Judge" style of play due to the
less infinite pool of players.
<p>
	Because the Club style of play presents the possibility that players
may face each other with a frequency of more than once of lifetime and less 
than every game, the smart player will begin to make a mental book
on the tendencies observed in other players during the course of any 
given game. Examples of some types of notes which a player may make
might include. Evaluation of relative skill level, situations under
which a player might or might not be trusted, reactions to stabs, 
behavior after a stab and so on. Collecting the information however
is one thing, making effective use of it is quite another.
<p>
	While this information is useful in a current game setting, it is
in a subsequent meeting that the full analysis can be put to greatest
use. Consider the following examples.
<OL>
<li>
	You are beginning a game and your immediate neighbor is someone
who you had the opportunity to observe in a prior game a year or so ago.
Your observations at that time were that the player made an alliance
with another player and did in fact pass up a good chance for a stab. 
Will these observations influence your decisions to attempt alliance
with this player this time? Doggone right they will!
<li>
	Two players offer you an alliance at the beginning of a game. One
player you recall from a past game, quit in a snit when things were not
going well. Is this useful information? Absolutely.
</OL>
	There might be a small minority that would call this "Cross gaming", but
in reality, unless one is playing a game with Vulcans, it is not only
not improper, but in fact essential that a player learn all one can
about the opponents. As in most wars, the side with the most accurate
information wins. A friend of mine coined what I believe to be
perhaps most complete and certainly most concise definition
of the game of Diplomacy with the phrase. "Everything counts."
<p>
	Perhaps the most challenging games of Diplomacy I have ever played have been
against 6 other people with whom I have played more than once. Here the 
trick is not only to utilize the knowledge of the tendencies of the other 
players, but to honestly appraise ones own tendencies and attempt to
use this against the other players. Are you known for long alliances?
What better time to lead an opponent down the golden path to a trap.
<p>
	There are those who might feel that Diplomacy is challenging enough with
out having to analyze the other players, but to others, it is just this
diversity that keeps the game fresh. The opportunity to observe and 
participate in this miniature laboratory. A laboratory that combines
seven distinct personalities and then purposely puts them all in conflict
with each other. And the really amazing thing about it all is that in
many instances these people become longtime friends.
