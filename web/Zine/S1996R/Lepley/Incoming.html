Further Reflections from a Diplomacy Newbie

	Our first Diplomacy "club" game mercifully ended.  Germany and
Russia, with a two-to-one advantage over what was left of France, Turkey, and
Italy, were stopped at a stalemate line.  No one was willing to change
loyalties. The game was at a stalemate.  In what is (no doubt) a move
frowned on by the Diplomacy community, I rolled Russia over to Germany
and ended the game by helping Germany take the solo.  Darn frustrating to
have a two-to-one advantage and not be able to crush the enemy.
<P>
	Our second club game is now underway.  This one is an 1898
variation of regular Diplomacy, and is Gunboat.  In the normal Gunboat game,
one must never reveal the fact that they are in the game at all.  Gunboat is
the judge's term for an anonymous game; what the postal world calls "gunboat"
-- the silent game -- is known to the judge as "no-press gunboat".  Gunboat,
then,
means that no one knows each player's name or that you are in their gunboat
game.  
This is all taken care of by the computer.  Any leak from you and you are 
history!  Kicked out of the game.
<P>
	<tt>Club2</tt> isn't your normal gunboat game, though.  We all know each
other's names.
We simply aren't sure who is playing which country.  With several moves
behind us, most of us know who a few players are, and some of us
<em>think</em> that they have worked out who everyone is.  Writing style
is not easy to hide. 
But still, it's "don't ask, don't tell."  We retain a little of the mystery 
of the traditional gunboat.
<P>
	1898 is the variation of Diplomacy in which each player only owns
one of their home centers at the start of the game and thus has only one
unit to move in Spring 1899. The general lack of 1898 strategy information
available may make this game interesting to someone thinking of trying the
variant.
<P>
	The setup of the pieces is well thought out.  It does seem obvious 
that certain countries are so set up so as to encourage them to ignore
their home centers early and go wandering.  England has the only fleet.  
Her move to the North sea puts a number of non-English centers at risk in 
the first year.  Russia has an army in St. Pete, and is clearly being tempted 
to take Norway on the first move (thus risking Russia's traditional 
southern position).  Turkey can move to threaten Sevastopol and take it if 
Russia bites on Norway.  Austria can invade Italy on the first move or 
Germany by move two (if Germany moves west).  Not much of an option If 
Austria invades Italy and is stalemated by the third move.  
<P>
	France, Germany, and Italy don't seem to be quite as tempted to 
wander.  Italy clearly has the fewest starting options and is the only 
country that can't leave home at all in the first year.
<P>
	With a few moves behind us now, the game is shaping up.  Russia did
indeed move on Norway.  However, Turkey did not take Sevastopol. Germany
wound up with Sweden and then took Norway from Russia.  Now Russia only has 
three centers to face the 11 owned by Germany and Austria.
<P>
	England tried but never got that fourth build.  With Germany and 
France moving against England (13 centers to three) she is looking like
the first to be eliminated.  The Russian move against Norway kept England out
of Scandinavia.
<P>
	France, Italy, Germany, Turkey, and Austria have all expanded in 
more or less normal Diplomacy fashion.  They have their home centers and 
usual free expansions. 
<P>
	At the moment, England and Russia look as if they have suffered 
the most in this 1898 variation.  Now that most countries have their normal 
sphere of influence...it is more like a regular Diplomacy game.  
<P>
	I would predict that the biggest effect the 1898 variation had on 
our game was to make it more difficult for England and Russia to survive. 
Mostly because of the Russian move to Norway.  Had Turkey moved on 
Sevastopol, Russia would be nearly gone already.
<P>
More as my life unfolds....
