<b>7 April 1996</b>
<p>
     Welcome to a very special issue of
XENOGOGIC.  Thirty years ago this month I sent out the first issue of XENOGOGIC,
my first attempt at publishing and gamemastering in Diplomacy.  That first
mailing consisted of a single sheet, dittoed on two sides (and so poorly
done it could barely be read), and announcing that I had two regular games
and a couple of screwy variant games open.  It cost me all of 6 cents to
mail one of those first issues, and my total cost for that first mailing
was less than it now costs me just to mail a single copy of one of my recent
WWPDC mailings.  Within two weeks I had both games filled with some of the
top players in the not very large, but ever so enthusiastic hobby of that
day.  Friendships, and rivalries, began then that have lasted to this very
day.
  <p>
   Who would have thought then that thirty years later this issue
would be going out not only by post, but also by simultaneous publication,
by email, on The Net, and on the Web to hundreds of readers in over a score
of countries?  Not I, for sure.  There are only a handful of Dippers still
around from that Golden Age of Diplomacy, and those who have survived have
done so for two reasons: a continued enthusiasm for the game and hobby; and a willingness to adapt to an ever-changing hobby environment. Well, maybe not Dr. John Boardman, but he's a strange duck anyway!
  <p>     I
have no profound words to mark this occasion.  Instead, it's business and
peeriblah as usual.  Whether you see this on paper, as an adjunct to
<A HREF="../../.."><b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b></a> (Contact

or in bits and pieces scattered in <A HREF="http://www.diplomacyworld.net">DIPLOMACY

or <A HREF="http://www.diplomacyworld.net">http://www.diplomacyworld.net</a>),
or some of the hobby's other fine publications; I hope you will stop and
ponder for a moment on a few of the things you read here.  And, with luck,
perhaps share a chuckle or two with me as I turn the peeriscope on our world
and hobby peeriscape.

<b>THAT OTHER ARCHIVES!</b>
  <p>     Potentially
the most important news story in the hobby in many years is that the Walt
Buchanan Collection (aka as The Diplomacy Archives) has been rescued from
the boonies of Indiana, and moved to the suave and urbane state of Ohio!
 The new custodian of Walt's collection (which covers the early years of
the hobby in detail) is Jamie McQuinn (<A HREF="mailto:JMcQuinn@delphicom">JMcQuinn@delphicom</a>).
 Jamie is currently developing plans to put this treasure chest of hobby
lore to work.  Good for him.  I'm not sure whether he plans to begin adding
to the collection in the near future, or even if he will attempt to fill
in the 20-25 year gap between when Walt stopped adding to it and today, but I do know every publisher in the hobby (including those on the Net) should have a contingency plan to provide a copy on disk or a hard copy of each of their publications to The Archives.  
   <p>    The other major
hobby Archives is the one I am custodian-caretaker of.  That Collection is far larger than the Buchanan one, and goes even further along in time;
but it is still incomplete.  At the moment it consists of some 50,000 (give
or take a few thousand, depending on how many duplicates of GRAUSTARK I include) items and makes a stack about 11 stories high.  These are all hard
copies, by the way, with very little in the way of material on disk.  Many
of the oldest treasures in The Archives were done on mimeo and ditto machines
and are now in poor physical condition.  I know Jamie has plans to deal with this problem with his new collection  I have still not made any decisions
in this area.  Anyway, now you know what's there and where it is.
  <p>
<b>A VIRGIN LOOKS AT DIPLOMACY WORLD</b>
  <p>     As hard as it is to believe
there actually are Dippers who have never seen the hobby's flagship publication,
DIPLOMACY WORLD.  One of them is/was Pete Rauch (<A HREF="mailto:73621.1734@compuserve.com">73621.1734@compuserve.com</a>)
who won the contest I ran recently in
<A HREF="../../.."><B>The Diplomatic Pouch</b></a>
dealing with the ten most important spaces on the Diplomacy
gameboard.  Pete's prize was a bag full of back issues of DW, some of them
dating back to the Jerry Jones days, some 14-15 years ago.  Pete has promised
a review of the issues I sent him, and it should be interesting to see what
he has to say.  By the way, I have many back issues from the Jones, Walker
and Peery DW issues; and more recent issues by Hood and Kent are also available
from them.  For more info, query me at <A HREF="mailto:peeriblah@aol.com">peeriblah@aol.com</a>.

<b>WDC VI UPDATE</b>
    <p>   Now that winter is over, at least
for most of us, a young Dipper's interest  should be turning to DIPCON.  It's only three months away, and that's not long if you are coming from
overseas.  I have heard from players in Australia, England, France, Sweden,
and Germany who are planning to attend.  France is sending the current world
champion, as well as several of its top players.  The Swedes will be sending
a team that includes some of their best. 
   <p>     America's reaction is, not surprisingly, to send Edi Birsan, perhaps the greatest Diplomacy
player of all time.  Edi, who owns a game company, isn't going to Columbus
for ORIGINS, the premier commercial gaming trade show.   He's going because
"I haven't played any Diplomacy in a while."  That's a bit like Atilla the
Hun saying he hasn't destroyed any cities lately, so he's off to sack Rome.
 Edi, who goes back to the very beginning of the postal and FTF hobbies,
is one of the few DIPCON originals still around.  He invented the Lepanto
Opening, among others.  He's also one of the few people to win PBM games
playing every one of the Great Powers Course, the Europeans don't think that  Edi's the greatest --- but most of them weren't even born when Edi
started playing and winning.  
  <p>
     I have just checked with some of the site adjacent hotels in Columbus and they still have rooms available,
but I wouldn't wait too long to make a reservation. If you get one of the
postcards from ORIGINS advertising the event, be sure to read the fine print
carefully.  You'll note, for instance, that the Courtyard by Marriott offers
a double room for $74 a night.  However, when you add in taxes the price
rises to $84.65, plus $6.00 for self-parking or $10 for valet parking per
night.  Figure about $50 per person, per night, shared for a close to the
site hotel; half that for a room out of the area. I figure 20,000 gamers
will be chasing 2,000 hotel rooms, so if you get a good price for a good
location, that's worth a dot or two.  Ah, sorry, Henri!  I will shortly have an update available on hostel and university housing for those Interested
in that.  Housing or housing with some meals will run $20 to $40 for one,
per night, at the hostel or university.  If you are coming to WDC VI from
overseas be sure you contact me ASAP for info on discounted admission, inexpensive
housing, etc.  If you act quickly I may be able to get you some good airfares
as well.  Northwest Orient Airlines, and others as well, have just announced
a fare war for summer travel.  Bargains are out there, if you look and act
now. If you are from overseas contact <A HREF="mailto:WDCVI@aol.com">WDCVI@aol.com</a>.

<b>HERE WE GO, BEGGING AGAIN (WATCH OUT FOR JIM BURGESS!)</b>
    <p>   As part of the American effort  to bring WDC VI to Columbus this
summer, I promised the Paris meeting last winter that we would do two things:
1) Provide housing, eats, and run of the house privileges for their champion
coming to America (they would provide transportation); and 2) We would send
our champion this year to next year's WDC site (which will be determined
in Columbus) and, as a quid pro quo, they would provide housing, eats, etc.
  I made this commitment personally and I intend to follow up on it.  I believed then and I believe now that such a commitment, carried over from
event to event is a vital part of any WDC event.  Without this kind of commitment
the event and the title are meaningless.   However, I could use a bit of
help from the hobby in carrying it out this year, and for 1997.  Since DIPCON
and WDC VI are getting no financial support from the host event, or even
any of the registration monies; and the American hobby, unlike some of the
European ones seems unwilling or unable to attract any corporate support;
I don't expect any help from them.  So I'm turning to you.
    <p>   It may be the PBS Syndrome, but I've noticed in recent years that nobody seems
willing to donate just for a good cause.  They've got to get something out
of it; whether it's their name on a building, a scoreboard, a golf tournament,
or a freebie.  So, here's my pitch.  You donate and I'll match your contribution
in back issues of DW for you, provided you pay the postage (at express mail
rates domestic or foreign) or pick up the magazines at WDC in Columbus.  Here's how it works.  You send me $20 for the fund, and $3 for postage and I'll stuff an envelope with $20 worth of back issues of DW, and send
them off; or you can pick them up in Columbus and I'll put the whole $23
toward the fund.  Back issues are from $4-$10 in value, older or rarer ones
being worth more obviously.  For a $200 donation I'll give you a copy of
every back issue I have multiples of.  That's a good deal.  You can request
specific issues and I'll honor those as I can.  No guarantees, however.  If you are interested in Anthologies, I have an even simpler idea.  You
donate $100 to the fund and I'll give you the Anthology volume of your choice,
subject to availability.  For what's available and details contact me at
<A HREF="mailto:WDCVI@aol.com">WDCVI@aol.com</a>.

<b>A RESPONSE TO
A QUESTION FROM ROLAND ISAKSSON</b>
    <p>   Roland (<A HREF="mailto:roi@algonet.se">roi@algonet.se</a>)
is planning on bringing a Swedish team to WDC VI.  He told me that they will have two weeks in America: one week for Columbus and one week to see
another American city.  He asked me which city I would recommend to them,
and why.  It wasn't as easy a question to answer as I thought it would be,
especially since I don't know what the interests of the Swedes are, or how
they will be travelling.  Having a car is almost mandatory in the USA, unless
you plan to spend the week in one major city (or resort).  Travelling by
bus or train isn't a good option for such a short period of time.  Given
those limitations, here are my suggestions:
<OL>    
<LI> SAN FRANCISCO  (The Paris of North America) - If you liked Paris, but hated the French,
you'd love San Francisco.  It's a beautiful city, with lots to see and do.
 The food is great, and fairly cheap, since almost everybody eats out a lot of the time.  The people are both warm and sophisticated.  I spent a
lot of time up there during the 1960s, and then stayed away for some 25 years.  Unlike most places, when I returned three years ago I found it had
changed very little from what I remembered.
<LI> BOSTON (Where it all began!)
- Boston is an American historical center, and a typical college town. One
out of every ten residents is a full time student at a local university.
 Unfortunately, eight out of the other ten residents are "red-necks."  How
they get along is a fascinating example of American culture.
     <LI> WASHINGTON,
D.C. (For museum lovers!) - I spent seven weeks in D.C. while Richard Nixon
was president.  Even that wasn't enough to see all of it.  I've been back
a few times since; and always enjoyed my visit.  It has a fairly good metro
system for getting around.  The food is improving, but Washington still has no night life to speak of.  Still, you can watch our government work
(well, when they're working...), and the whole history of the country is
there in one form or another.  No matter how jaded you are, you can't help
but be moved.
    <LI>  NEW ORLEANS (Just because...) - It's unique, it's
fun!  The food is great and if you like music, you'll love the jazz!  It's
also a walker's dream.
     <LI>  DRIVE ABOUT (if you like to drive and know how!!) - Renting and operating a car in the States is not difficult.
 It's a lot cheaper than in Europe.  You can cover an amazing amount of territory if you want, or just drive about a given area.  Three or four people in a mid-sized car can do it very reasonably.  One trip might be to fly into San Francisco, drive down to Los Angeles, visiting various California
sites (there are many, many of them) on the way; and then fly home out of
Los Angeles.  Another possibility is to fly into some spot in the West and
do a tour of some of the National Parks.  These are treasures of America
that no other country in the world has.  There are hundreds of them, some
big and famous and crowded.  Some just as beautiful but hardly known.  If
you love the outdoors or nature, this is for you.  you can also do the camping
bit, if that's your (sleeping) bag.  
     <LI>  SAN DIEGO (Remember, I've
been almost everywhere and this is where I choose to live) - If you just
want to relax and see that very endangered species, the native Californian
in his natural habitat, then San Diego is for you.  It has the sea, surf,
sun, mountains, deserts, and (groan) Mexico!  And it doesn't have all the
Brits you'll find in Orlando!  From my patios I can see 2,000 meter mountains,
the Pacific and a foreign country!  What can you see?  (<A href="http://www.sandiego.org">http://www.sandiego.org</a>)<p>
<i>[Editor's note: In addition to the San Diego link provided above, <A href="http://www.yahoo.com/">Yahoo</a> has information links for all the
cities listed.  Just do a search by city name.]</i>
  </ol>
   So, as you
can see, you won't be able to see it all, but you'll have plenty of excuses
to come back again.       
<p>
<b>DIPPING THROUGH THE TULIPS WITH BERRY!</b>
 <p>    The Diplomacy hobby in the Netherlands has never been very large;
but over the years it has produced some outstanding players, publications,
and events, including the first ever EURO DIPCON.<p> 
     Things have been
quiet in the Netherlands lately, but perhaps that is about to change.  A
new Dip zine, THE BLUESMOBILE, has been announced by Berry Renken, who can
be reached on the internet at: <A href="mailto:berry.renken@cool.xs4a11.nl">berry.renken@cool.xs4a11.nl</a>
He has openings for two games, one using American style season breaks and
one using the British system.  If you don't understand the difference, perhaps
you should sign up for both.  There is no gamefee, but he's looking for reliable players.  Who isn't?  Anyway, it sounds fun if you're an email Dipper.  Drop him a line and tell him I sent you.
<p>
<b>WHAT'S A VIKING
DOING IN EGYPT, ANYWAY?</b>
   <p>  As I write this I am thinking about the Cunard Viking liner that just ran aground somewhere off Egypt's coast.
 Ever since Cunard announced they were putting the line and its ships up
for sale they've had nothing but problems with their boats.  Last month it was one that had engine failure in the Pacific.  Sigh...
 <p>    Anyway,
don't let that deter you if you are planning on visiting Europe this summer
(as some 9 million Americans plan to do, I hear).  Why not plan to attend
the EURO DIPCON championship in Oslo the weekend before WDC in Columbus?
 It's not as crazy an idea as it sounds, if you haven't maxed out your credit
cards.  For info on that contact <A href="mailto:Borger.Borgersen@snett.telenor.no">Borger.Borgersen@snett.telenor.no</a>.
 It would be nice to have a few good American Dippers show up at a European
event for a change.  
  <p>   And while we're in Scandinavia, there are a number of good PBM Diplomacy (and other gaming) publications put out by
them.  One of my favorites is Per Westling's LEPANTO 4-EVER.  He has lots
of Dip and variant openings.  His gamemastering is impecable, as is his English.  He looks like a Swede should, unlike most of them who look like
Belorussians after a weekend at a Chernoybl health spa.  In fact, he only
has one fault --- he's a bridge player.  Contact him at <A href="mailto:Per.Westling@bms.se">Per.Westling@bms.se</a>
and ask for a copy of issue XLIII; which has a lot of reviews of other Scandinavian
pubs; and the next one; which may, or may not, contain some of my recent
effort, LEPANTO 2-MUCH.  
<p>
<b>WWPDC UPDATE</b>
 <p>    Hard as it is to believe the WWPDC (Worldwide Postal Diplomacy Championship) is four years
old this month!  And it is only in 1902.  Whether the WWPDC will be remembered
as a monument to my determination or my stupidity is still undecided.  <i>[Editor's
note: and we thought our real-real-time game DipPouch with one game year
per calendar year was bad!]</i> However, the event is under way.  If you
aren't familiar with it, the WWPDC consists of 7 regular Diplomacy games
being played by mail (although about half of the participants have email
access).  There are seven teams playing in the event and each team consists
of seven players and from zero to two stand-bys.  The teams are from the
United States, Austria, Sweden, France, Italy, the Commonwealth, and one
polygot group from all over.  Here's a report on the situation at the end
of 1901.
 <p>    Here's a Power by Power over-view of the current situation
at the end of 1901 (games are listed in order from 1 to 7):<br>
     Austria:
5, 5, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5<br>
     England: 5, 4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4 <br>
     France:
3, 6, 5, 5, 5, 4, 3<br>
     Germany: 4, 4, 4, 5, 3, 5, 5<br>
     Italy:
4, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 4 <br>
     Russia: 5, 4, 6, 4, 6, 6, 6<br>
     Turkey:
4, 4, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4<br>
<p>The numbers represent the number of supply centers
held.  Each Power seems to be having one poor game, and each team also seems
to be having one poor game, although the two don't always coincide.  
 <p>
   Here's a team standings over-view: (first number is the number of units
on the board at the end of 1901, second number is the number of centers held at the end of 1901):<br>
     Austria: 34/34; <br>
     Barbarians:
34/34; <br>
     USA: 32/34; <br>
     Sweden: 31/31; <br>
     Commonwealth:
29/30; <br>
     France: 28/30; <br>
     Italy: 25/28.  <br>

<b>WOMEN AND DIP! (IS IT REALLY BETTER THE SECOND TIME
AROUND?)</b>
  <p>    One of my first projects when I took over DW back in 1985 was to do an all women's issue.  Kathy Byrne Caruso, one of the top female Dippers of her day, helped out with that project.  I was thinking
about  that project a few days ago while working on a new women in Dip feature
(more on that below).  That led to another thought, and that leads to another
contest!  All Dip publishers are encouraged to reprint this contest in their
zines.  Submissions may be sent by regular or email, but must be in English.
 Humor is particularly welcomed!  The deadline for entries is 1 July  The
prize will be, surprise, a bag of back issues of DW!!  Now, here's the question.
 Who is the best female Dipper you have ever played with?  Why?  Or, what
woman that you have known would have been a great Dipper? Why?  And yes,
you can use famous female historical figures if you wish.  Entries can be
sent to me at <A href="mailto:peeriblah@aol.com">peeriblah@aol.com</a> or
the postal address given above.
<p>
<b>MICHAEL HOOD VISIT</b>
  <p>   One
of the secrets to being any good in Diplomacy, as a player or as a hobbyist,
is that you have to genuinely like people.  I know there are a few people
in the hobby who don't like people.  I've never understood that.  Why do
they bother?  Anyway, if you do like people and enjoy meeting them this is a great hobby.  One of my joys in running the WWPDC has been the opportunity
it has given me to meet Dippers from all over the world.  In just the last
week or so I have had letters, email, and phone calls from Dippers in ten
different countries.  It doesn't surprise me any more to come home and find
messages from five or six countries on the computer (and that's not counting
those damn ads!).  Still, when you get to meet someone FTF for the first
time, especially from a foreign country, that is always special.  That's
one of the big appeals of WDC, I believe.  Anyway, in recent months I've
been lucky enough to meet two of the members of the Commonwealth team, Brendan
Whyte (<A href="mailto:whyte@geog.sscnet.ucla.edu">whyte@geog.sscnet.ucla.edu</a>)
and Michael Hood (<A href="mailto:MHood@fcl.corp.co.nz">MHood@fcl.corp.co.nz</a>),
both from New Zealand.  Brendan is here for a term, supposedly going to school.  He seems to be spending most of his time proving, on the Net, that
some Kiwis have absolutely no sense of humor.  Michael, on the other hand,
was here for just a few days, on business.  Some business!  I only had a
few hours to enjoy his company, but he was a perfect living example of what
the Golden Age of Dip was and is.  He started playing Diplomacy some 25 years ago, and he's still at it.  He is obviously the kind of person who
enjoys people, and he certainly seems to enjoy the game.  He's also one of the few people in the hobby<p>  I have met who can out peeriblah me!
<p>
<b>ANOTHER CRAZY PEERIDEA FOR A VARIANT</b>
 <p>    Here's an idea for
a Diplomacy variant, especially if you like Monopoly and crossword puzzles
as well.  It's a simple idea, see if you can make something out of it.  The idea came to me while reading a Reuters report on expensive commercial
real estate on a street by street basis.  Here's a list of the world's most
expensive streets:<br>
     1) New York's Fifth Ave.<br>
     2) New York's
57th Street.<br>
     3) Tokyo's Ginza.<br>
     4) New York's Madison Ave.
and 69th St.<br>
     4) San Francisco's Post and Stockton Streets.<br>
     6) Paris' Champs Elysee.<br>
     7) Geneva's Rue de Rhone.<br>
     8) Paris' Place Vendome.<br>
     9) London's Bond Street.<br>
    10)
Singapore's Orchard Road.<br>
    11) Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills, California.<br>
    11) Rome's Via Conditti<br>
<p>My idea would be to construct a square
(or hex) matrix laying out these streets as in a crossword puzzle.  Where
the streets cross each other would be supply centers, etc. etc.  Well, you
do get it, don't you?
<p>
<b>PIGEONS OF THE WORLD --- SHIT!</b>
 <p>    What with all the news about mad cows and TB pigs (Who would have thought
that all it would take to drive the Royals off the front pages of the London
tabloids would be a few mad cows and TB pigs?), you may have missed the flock of stories about the world's pigeons problems lately.  
<p>     Both
Paris and Venice have reported major problems caused by an over-population
of pigeons lately, including some dieased ones.  One proposed solution was
to catch them and send them to Brussels, Belgium, where pigeons are considered
a culinary delicacy.  That got the animal activists in a uproar, of course.
 <p>    Now we hear that the pigeons in Trafalgar Square are disappearing
at an alarming rate, apparently being bird-napped by pigeon-snatchers, who
are scooping up the birds 40 at a time and taking them off in a large box
 At first authorities thought they were being used for races, but now suspicions
are centered on London's Greek community, where pigeons are considered a
delicacy.  
<p>     Don't worry, we'll be keeping an eye, carefully, on this story.
<p>
<b>THE PEERY LINE</b>
 <p>    It may be difficult, even impossible, for some of you to believe but I have actually been busy writing
about something more important than Diplomacy.  What subject could that be, you may ask?  Me, of course.  Well, not just me, but my family.  The
Peerys have established an on line home page (actually several of them) devoted to the Peery family.  My contribution isn't quite done.  When it
is, I'll let you know.  
<p>
<b>WHAT'S NEXT?</b>
  <p>   	Here's a preview
of some of the things I'm working on at the moment  You may find them in
upcoming issues of DW (next issue due out in a few weeks, right Doug?), or in TDP (latest issue just out), in LEPANTO, in DIPSOMANIA (<A href="mailto:Jef
Bryant at 100415.2220@compuserve.com">Jef Bryant at 100415.2220@compuserve.com</a>).
 Alas, you won't see them in PERELANDRA, because PJ's (<A href="mailto:gaughan@netcom.com">gaughan@netcom.com</a>)
folded it (again).  But don't worry, I'd bet PJ's weight in potatoes that
he'll be back
<p>
<b>WOMEN DIPPERS FOR REAL!</b>
  <p>   I mentioned women
Dippers up above, and your mind probably went right to the gaming table.
 However, there is another brand of woman dipper --- the real one.  I remember
the first woman diplomat I ever met, Eleanor Roosevelt.  Then it was Shirley
Temple Black (and who was that Norwegian making a big deal out of woman movie star as president?); both cameo roles on the world's diplomatic stage.
 Not any more.  Women have taken stage center on the world's diplomatic front.  Jeane Kirkpatrick started the trend, I suppose, and now we have Madeleine Albright at the UN, when's she's home.  And have you noticed that
she looks better in combat boots than most women do in heels?  Coming down
the pike is a rather fascinating look at three women diplomats who have or are shaping our world of  real time, on-line diplomacy. We have a native-born
Brit representing the United States in Paris, Pamela Harriman.  We have a native-born Brit representing the Empire to the world, Lady Thatcher.  And we have Madeleine, representing the liberated woman to the world!  Anybody want to guess where Madeleine was born? They're all different in
substance and style, but we'll be discussing diplomacy with them.  Stay tuned.

<b>WHO IS VINTON CERF AND WHY SHOULD WE CARE?</b>
 <p>    If anyone is interested I have an interview with Mr. Cerf for publication.  If you don't know who he is, you'd better find out.  Fast.  Icons disappear
fast in this hobby.

<b>PEERY ON THE LIGHTER SIDE</b>
 <p>    No, that
wasn't me on the cover of TIME magazine's 4 March issue but, yes, that was
me inside on page 72.
  <p>   And yes, that was Mike Collins (<a href="mailto:Mike_Collins@npi.co.uk">Mike_Collins@npi.co.uk</a>)
showing off his latest suit of armor, on the cover of the March issue of
US NAVAL INSTITUTE PROCEEDINGS.
  <p>   Europeans have never been crazy about American style football, and even less interested in America's national
pastime, baseball.  Obviously, because it's too cerebral a sport for them.
 That may be changing soon, however, as the San Diego Padres have just re-signed
their "most improved team/manager", Bruce Bochy, who just happens to be from France.  Who would have thought?

<b>30 YEAR WRAP UP</b>
 <p>    So, after 30 years in the hobby what advice do I have to give to Berry Renken and those who will come after him?  It's simple.  Don't try to read
it all, learn it all, do it all, go everywhere, or please everybody.  I know.  I have.  Instead; sample, dabble, find a cause or two, and leave yourself room to grow.  You, and the hobby, will be the better for it.

<P>
