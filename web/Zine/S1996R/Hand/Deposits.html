Hi again, everyone.  Well, there's a bit better news to report concerning the
amount of mail (fan and otherwise) which we received here at The Pouch.
Indeed, even my "let's talk about build waiving" plan generated a correspondent
(see below).  But I'm not going to get off your back entirely yet, though;
let's stick with the build-waiving topic a while longer.  Send me your war
stories and all your nefarious reasons for builds held in reserve.  I ask not
only because the topic hasn't been properly explored in these pages yet, but
because I am too busy to stop and think of a new topic.
<P>
So what do you say?  Let's see a Deposits article next issue which is
absolutely filled with build-waiving comments, okay?  Is that too much to ask?
<P>
Stab you soon,

<H3>From <a href=mailto:elm@peg.apc.org>elm@peg.apc.org</a></H3>
Here is a reason for waiving a build.  In the Youngstown variant, as
a colony power (England, France, Italy), you may find that you need
two (or more) builds in the East, so you will have to build them
one at a time. If you can see you're not likely to get a build next year,
you can waive one from this year to be sure to get the second unit in the
East.
<P>
<strong><em>[Editor's response:  Hallelujiah!  Someone reads my
writing!  This is indeed a good reason to waive a build, and it applies to
the standard game as well.  If you're Austria and you need fleets, or if
you're Russia and you want to build two fleets at the north coast of
St. Petersburg, taking your builds one at a time works well.]</em></strong>

First, I just want to thank you for the work you've put into the Diplomatic
Pouch. The whole layout is great and I know how much work keeping something
like that in place can me.
<P>
Second, I do want to offer one suggestion. There is an entire arena of
Diplomacy that you guys are missing. In addition to FTF, PBM and
PBEM/Internet, many games are being played by E-mail within the commercial
online services. America On Line has a very active Diplomacy area. I've heard
the other services have areas as well, though I can't speak about them
personally. I've been involved in AOL games for several years and I find it
the best place to play: more practical than FTF and move satisfying than
Internet PBEM. If you could add something on non Internet PBEM, you'll be
making what is already a great resource even more complete and useful.
<P>
Thanks for listening,
<P>
<strong><em>[Editor's response:  We at The Pouch are certainly interested in
covering all of the methods of play, and we readily acknowledge that we aren't
doing as well in the coverage of some of them as we are with others.  The
DP Councillors are primarily Internet players, and given that our real lives
are packed end to end, it's not feasible for us to supplement our knowledge
base very easily.  However, we would be happy to have anyone with knowledge
of the different modes of play which we are neglecting out of ignorance or
time constraints, step forward and help shoulder the load here.  As a
matter of fact, as is apparent in this issue of the Zine, a couple members
of the community which Bill spoke of above have started to make their presence
known by submitting articles!  So it is my hope that these such failings of
The Pouch will work themselves out on their own.]</em></strong>

Just wanted to say I enjoyed the Winter issue..I don't think I ever got around
to viewing it until today.
<P>
We should write an article on how hard it is to get people to write articles!
<P>
Sometimes I wish I didn't have my monthly Dip zine to do, because it takes a
lot out of me and I have less energy left for Diplomacy World.
<P>
<strong><em>[Editor's response:  Hear, hear!  Actually, we here at The Pouch
were seriously considering going without a Spring 1996 Retreat issue.  As I
discussed in <a href=About.html>the "About" column</a>, my life was busy
preparing for the conference
I attended, and there were no articles in evidence even up to a week before
the publication date.  All of a sudden, the floodgates opened (thanks,
everyone!) and articles started pouring in.  We're still delayed, but articles
magically (at least this time) turned out to be no problem!  Let's hope this
continues in the future.]</em></strong>

In the course of looking up a word, the dictionary opened to

Is this a subtle plug for us to write more for you?

The Dip Pouch is awesome.  Thanks for providing it.  The Sherlock Holmes deal
this issue is pure genius.  How long did it take to come up with all those
anagrams?  Wow.  Keep up the great work.
<P>
<strong><em>[Editor's response:  Credit for the amazing anagram work goes to
Simon Szykman.  He wrote the story and I wrapped a mystery around it.  I
second your congratulations to Simon for a truly incredible piece of work.
Glad you liked it.  Now if we could only get the readership to try their
hand at solving the mystery.  See <a href="/Zine/S1996R/Holmes">this issue's

Well done.  We certainly could use more levity in the Dip populace...

Dear diplomat,
<P>
I read with extreme care your article about "North Sea to Picardy"; you showed
to every diplomat that the question is far deeper than the common player could
imagine. Your arguments were clear and brought light to many unknown faces of
this so underevaluated subject.
<P>
Unfortunately, in the big city of your ideas there was an awful miss, like a
stellar black void in a common garden. I explain: you didn't write anything
about a move so closely connected to your subject that I ask myself if you
did it on purpose or not (and then why?): what about Picardy to North Sea?
I think you'll feel completely confused for some time before you entirely
recover after such a mistake.
<P>
The long road to perfect understanding of Diplomacy is a narrow path, but I am
sure you will add this remark and keep going on the right way.
<P>
Diplofriendly yours.
<P>
<strong><em>[Editor's response:  Leave it to the world champion to find me out!
I was keeping <tt>Pic-Nth</tt> in reserve, as a secret move which I hoped no
one would see, and then I was going to pull it out of my sleeve when it was
least expected; perhaps at the upcoming World DipCon, and perhaps to vanquish
M.  Giraudon and take the World Dip Cup from him.  I guess we see why he is the
World Champion.  You can't get anything past him!]</em></strong>

The article North Sea to Picardy was the stupidest thing I've ever read
in my life.  It wasn't funny, it was a waste of time.
<P>
<strong><em>[Editor's response:  I'm sorry you didn't like it.  The article
grew out of a typo I made in a posting to
<tt><a href=news:rec.games.diplomacy>rec.games.diplomacy</a></tt>.
Perhaps you had to be there.  Anyway, thanks for the comments, and -- this
is for everyone now -- the best way to avoid publication of stuff you don't
like is to submit for publication stuff you write yourself
(hint hint).]</em></strong>

<H2 align=center>Mail Concerning
<a href=/Zine/S1996M/Hand/Essay.html>"The Greatness of the Game"</a>
Article</H2>
<H3>From Alexander Woo
(<a href=mailto:Alexander.K.Woo@williams.edu>Alexander.K.Woo@williams.edu</a>)
</H3>
Just a short note about what you've said about lookahead:
<P>
Yes, it's usually impossible to look ahead more than two or three turns on a
tactical level.  But being able to lookahead four to six years on a strategical
level is an important Diplomacy skill.  A good Diplomacy player should
be able to say: "Italy will be eliminated or left completely impotent in
three to five years according to current trends" or "France will be at
10-12 SC's in five years according to current trends."  Most importantly,
we use this information to check if current trends benefit us or harm us.
If they benefit us, we try to preserve status quo; if they harm us, we
frequently have to do something dramatic to break them.
<P>
<strong><em>[Editor's response: Good point, and well-said.  On a strategic
level, lookahead is indeed an important talent, and I completely agree that
its mastery is key to becoming a better player.  Indeed, I almost wonder if
the acquisition of this particular skill and the proper application of the
knowledge it imparts as the game goes on is the most difficult and most
important game skill to learn.]</em></strong>
