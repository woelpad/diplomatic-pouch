<H2 align=center>Egypt: The Beast of the Modern Variant</H2>
<H3 align=center><em>Rick Desper</em></H3>
OK, so you're Egypt.  Congratulations.  You only have two neighbors,
Italy and Turkey.  All you have to do to survive until the midgame is
avoid a concerted, undistracted effort upon their part to rend you to
pieces.  It's easy!  Why?
<P>
Egypt has a tremendous defensive advantage in Modern.  He has an
excellent corner position which can easily defend against any but the
most persistent and drawn-out attack.  The disadvantage of this
position, though, it its lack of access to a large number of SC's, and
the implied slow rate of growth.
<P>
Let's look at likely positions for Egypt after the first year.  You
start with Army Aswan, Fleet Cairo, and Fleet Alexandria.  You can do
any combination of the following:
<blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Eastern Sahara<BR>
Army Aswan -> Cairo
<P>
Fleet Cairo -> Eastern Mediterranean<BR>
Fleet Cairo SUPPORTS Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Mediterranean<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Red Sea
<P>
Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Mediterranean<BR>
Fleet Alexandria SUPPORTS Fleet Cairo -> Eastern Mediterranean<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Libyan Sea
</tt></blockquote>
Your targets are the neutral SC's of Israel, Saudi Arabia, and Libya.
Also, if you achieve the Eastern Med, you could take a shot at Izmir
or Adana.
<P>
You must judge for yourself the risk of losing the Eastern Med in the
first year.  A rule of thumb for nopress games would be to send at
least one fleet there.  After all, the Eastern Med borders three
"natural" Egyptian SC's (Israel, Cairo, and Alexandria).  And the last
thing you want to do at the start of the second year is face a Turkish
fleet in Cairo.  Even if you dislodge in the Spring, it could
conceivably retreat to the Red Sea!
<P>
The problem with taking Saudi Arabia is that you are almost forced to
do it with a fleet.  Actually, you could convoy across in the first
year, but that seems to be a waste of a force.  A natural set of
orders is <tt>F&#160;Cai&#160;-&#160;Red</tt>,
<tt>F&#160;Ale&#160;-&#160;EME</tt>, <tt>A&#160;Asw&#160;-&#160;ESah</tt>,
but this leaves the
army in Africa, and orients the fleets towards the Middle East.
<P>
This is exactly how you don't want things to be.  You want the army to
be in the Middle East, and the fleets to be in the Med (except maybe
one fleet to help attack Iran).
<P>
Now, let's talk about your neighbors, Italy and Turkey.  Italy has
access to a hoard of SC's in the Balkans.  Also, France is not a
terribly strong country, and often ends up tangled with Spain and
Britain in the early game.  So, Italy often turns into an early
monster.  This is a problem.
<P>
On the other hand, Turkey has an awful position.  Trapped between a
Ukraine which has to reach the Med if he wants to win and an Egypt
which has to go North if he wants to be important, Turkey is a
tempting target for an early sandwich.  Russia is a wildcard.
<P>
Expect to have two builds and control of the Eastern Med by the end of
the first year, and a sixth force by the end of the second year.  What
next?
<P>
If things are going well, Iran and Adana are vulnerable.  Tunisia is
also vulnerable to a sneaky land attack.  (Note that Libya borders
Algeria, so outflanking Italy is easy.)  The key is "getting the
fleets out."
<P>
Suppose the worst happens -- Italy and Turkey ally, and are
undistracted.  Well, you can sit on your haunches and wait.  A force
in the Eastern Sahara will strengthen Libya, and a few fleets will
make the Eastern Med at worse a continually contested space.  Invading
the Arabian peninsula from the North with only armies would appear to
be a formidable task.  An Eastern fleet would stop such an attack
cold.
<P>
Of course, should they have complete resources and time, you will
eventually be cracked.  But, as nuts go, the Egyptian one seems the
hardest to crack, in any variant I've seen.  Even if Libya is lost,
Italy can be stopped cold at Eastern Sahara/Eastern Med.
<P>
Furthermore, should you ever manage to escape the box and grab Asia
Minor, there is an easily held minority stalemate line once you reach
the other side of the Black Sea.  Do you see it?  Once you grow this
large, you can coast to a draw.
<P>
As for winning...well, the variant is still young, and to my knowledge
has yet to be won by anybody, so we don't know much about the endgame.
One possible algorithm might be:
<ol>
<li>Take out Turkey (with Ukraine's help?) while Italy is distracted.
Seize Asia Minor and push into Greece.
<LI>Send five fleets at Italy.  Seize the boot.
<LI>With two flanks on the Balkans, push into Bulgaria, Serbia,
Croatia.  Take over the Black Sea basin
<LI>Blast through the Ukraine, march through Russia.  Take Morocco and
seal the Med.
<LI>Take Iberia if possible (but highly unlikely).
<LI>Storm Russia and Poland for a victory.
</ol>
All of the above is predicated upon war with Turkey.  War with Turkey
is likely to be long and drawn-out.  Though it would appear to be a
necessary precondition for victory (by definition!) you may choose to
at least delay the inevitable.  Feel free to pursue the ET alliance.
The two of you will quickly cruise through the Balkans and Italy.  The
long-term prognosis, though, is uncertain.
