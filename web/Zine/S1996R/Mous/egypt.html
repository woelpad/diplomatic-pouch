Alexandria Rises Again
</H1>
<H2 align=center>Egypt in the Modern Variant</H2>
<H3 align=CENTER>
<em>Vincent Mous</em> 
</H3>
<H3>Brief Introduction</H3>
This is the third article in my continuing series about the Modern variant.
In 
<a href=../../W1995A/Mous/Modern.html>the first article</a>, you got an
introduction to the Modern variant (played on the
<a href=../../../Online/maps/modcolor.gif>modern map</a>, which is available
here at the Pouch), as well as some info on how to get
started playing it, and in <a href=../../S1996M/Mous/Modern2.html>the previous
article</a>, I discussed the various opening tactics and strategies for
Britain.
<P>
  Since that issue, the number of active modern games has grown from 15 to 
23 (with an extra two waiting for the injured USCA judge to be revived), and
the first modern game has ended! 
<tt>Blitzz</tt>, an NMR, no-press, 12-hour deadline game, ended with a
three-way draw 
between Britain (Mikko Laitinen), Egypt (Erik Stensland) and Poland (Joseph 
W. Carl, Jr.) in 2017. There has not been a solo victory yet; do you think 
you can meet the challenge?
<P>
    Well, back to the article.... This time we will be looking at Egypt!
Toby Tyrell, who gave each power in the Modern variant a mark of from one
to ten for potential in a no-press game, listed Egypt third (with a mark
of eight) only slightly behind Britain.
<P>
This time we have an additional treat in that Rick Desper has provided a
<a href=desper.html>full-length treatise</a> giving his thoughts on Egypt!
<P>
  In this article, as I did for Britain, I provide a list of the different
openings used for Egypt in the 
modern games that have been played until now, as well as a few more that 
may be of interest. As I am the GM of many modern games, and an observer in 
many more, I asked players for their opinions on strategies for the various 
powers in the modern variant, but also to propose some openings and to 
suggest a name for them -- the winning name and the name of the person 
suggesting appear along with every opening.
<P>
By the way, I am still looking for comments about strategy and opening names
for the remaining countries (everything except Britain and Egypt), so feel free 
to send your thoughts and suggestions to me at
<a href=mailto:vim2@rocketmail.com>vim2@rocketmail.com</a>. The next article will 
be on France, so I am especially interested in your thoughts on it.

<H3>List of Openings for Egypt</H3>

<dl><dt><strong>Desert Lion</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Eastern Sahara.<BR>
Fleet Cairo SUPPORT Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Mediterannean.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Mediterannean.
</tt></blockquote>

Simon Withers writes: "Forcing East Med increases Egypt's offensive options
against Turkey in the Fall. The East Med is attacked by Alexandria leaving
Cairo free to take Israel in the fall, while Aswan looks for a build in Libya."

<P><dt><strong>Tunisian Gambit</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Eastern Sahara.<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Israel.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Libyan Sea.
</tt></blockquote>

<P><dt><strong>Mediterranean Offensive</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Eastern Sahara.<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Israel.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Mediterannean.
</tt></blockquote>

Says Simon Withers, this opening "gives up on the chance in Saudi for a
possibly lesser chance in Libya, but takes Israel and defends the Eastern
Med.  If the Eastern Med is a bounce, Israel can support the move in the fall."
<P>
Craig Thomson believes that this is Egypt's "<strong>securest opening</strong>.
Two builds guaranteed and the ability to backstab Turkey or cut his builds
or at least bounce and prevent his ownership of the Eastern Med.... Eastern
Med is guaranteed in Fall."

<P><dt><strong>Southern Steamroller (Craig Thomson)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Eastern Sahara.<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Red Sea.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Cairo.
</tt></blockquote>

Craig calls this Egypt's "<strong>best opening</strong>. Three builds possible
but open to a Turkish backstab.... Great with a Turkish alliance."
<P>
Stephen Breininger, though, argues as follows:
"The problem with trying to pick up three supply centers is that it leaves your 
forces in the wrong places.  An army in Libya; <em>yuck</em>! It would take
two years to move it to where it belongs (attacking Turkey). And a fleet in
Saudi Arabia; almost as bad.  And consider how this play falls apart if Turkey 
decides to move his fleet into the Eastern Mediterranean Sea."
<P>
Rich Desper chimes in, noting that "actually, one nice thing about an army in
Libya is that you'll have great counter-attacks even if you should be
dislodged.  The problem is that you really need three armies in the East."

<P><dt><strong>Middle-East Trident</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Eastern Sahara.<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Red Sea.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Mediterannean.
</tt></blockquote>

Simon Withers notes that this opening is "not so anti-Turkish with the move of
only one fleet on the Eastern Med. Could be purely defensive, [but still] a
potentially dangerous opening. Only one of Israel and Saudi Arabia is
guaranteed, but the chance of a three is there."

<P><dt><strong>Turkish Offensive</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Cairo.<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Eastern Mediterannean.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria SUPPORT Fleet Cairo -> Eastern Mediterannean.
</tt></blockquote>

James Gemmill feels that this opening is "to be used only if you know Turkey
is hostile, and you feel control of the Eastern Med. is paramount to survival,
or at least its vacancy. The army in Cairo can be convoyed if the possibility
presents itself, or can move to Israel to gain the build. Very defensive."

<P><dt><strong>Mediterranean Gambit</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Cairo.<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Eastern Mediterannean.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Libyan Sea.
</tt></blockquote>

<P><dt><strong>The Sphinx (James Gemmill)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Cairo.<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Red Sea.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Sahara. (Desert Variant)<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Libyan Sea. (Naval Variant)
</tt></blockquote>

James Gemmil thinks this "will probably become the most common Egyptian
opening, as it allows the greatest amount of SC's to be grabbed the first
year. Will placate Turkey and Italy as it can be interpreted in many ways
diplomatically. Offers much diplomatic flexibility. Weak if Turkey opens to
the Eastern Med., [as this] can cause you to lose 2 builds in a defense of
your home SC's."

<P><dt><strong>Middle-East Defense</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Cairo.<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Red Sea.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Mediterannean.
</tt></blockquote>

Simon Withers comments that this "gives up on the chance at Libya to guarantee
one in Israel or Saudi, also sends more units at Turkey, which is probably a
good thing."
<P>
Says Stephen Breininger:
"During the Spring, If your fleet bounces with the Turkish fleet in the 
Eastern Med., you've just saved yourself from a Turkish invasion. Chances 
are, you'll sail safely into the Eastern Med. From there I'd attack Turkey. 
 If you are lucky, you will slip into either Adana or Izmir. I'd base this 
decision on the location of the Turkish troops."

<P><dt><strong>The Pyramid (James Gemmill)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Cairo.<BR>
Fleet Cairo -> Eastern Mediterranean.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Sahara.
</tt></blockquote>

James Gemmill remarks that "this opening is weak if Turkey opens to the
Eastern Med. as well, but can offer flexibility for the fall if you catch
the Turk unaware. Note the possibility of a convoy from Cairo, though this
is definitely a risk. You will gain two builds."

<P><dt><strong>Sea Lion</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Aswan -> Alexandria.<BR>
Fleet Cairo SUPPORT Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Mediterannean.<BR>
Fleet Alexandria -> Eastern Mediterannean.
</tt></blockquote>

Simon Withers notes that the Sea Lion "gives an identical defensive position
[to the Desert Lion], but gives up the chance at Libya for a stronger push
into Turkey.  Cairo can take Israel, while Alexandria is convoyed across
the Mediterranean."

<H3>Strategy for Egypt in Modern Games</H3>

  Egypt's position in Modern is similar to Turkey's position in the 
standard game. He holds an easily defensible corner of the map, has 
relatively few neighbors (Turkey and Italy), and does not have to worry 
about his back.  Egypt can pursue the option of starting with a few easy 
gains which do not make any enemies or friends. His love-hate relationship 
with Turkey is even similar to the Turkey-Austria relationship in the 
standard game.
<P>
  There are some differences however. In Modern, Egypt has more 
opportunities for growth in the first year, being able to double in size. 
On the other hand, the large number of centers one needs to take to win in 
Modern makes a corner position a more serious handicap for growth. Egypt is 
also quite vulnerable to Turkey in the first year and a surprise Turkish 
attack, while not immediately fatal, would make Egypt an also-ran in the 
early years, if not the whole game. If combined with a hostile Italy, a 
quick exit from the game is a strong possibility. Fortunately, the main 
difference between Modern and standard is the number of powers, and Egypt 
can usually count on one of Italy's many neighbors to keep him busy, as 
well as help from Ukraine or Russia against Turkey.
<P>
  In the first season as Egypt, you face two important decisions - how to 
balance security and growth, and how to position yourself for the second 
and following years. The decision between security and growth is 
essentially a tradeoff - security <strong>or</strong> growth. Security
primarily means 
preventing Turkey from entering the Eastern Mediterranean, which borders 
two of your home centers and Israel. A bounce here is well worth it, but 
gives you one less possible build - possibly two fewer if Turkey moves his 
army in Adana to block you from taking Israel or Saudi Arabia in the fall. 
If you move to the Eastern Med. and Turkey doesn't you can always head on 
to Israel and still get three builds if you moved Cairo to the Red Sea and 
Aswan to the Eastern Sahara. This could help patch things up with Turkey, 
but it may be worth it to try capturing one of his home centers instead - 
always a risk as a bounce means an angry Turkey and one less build for you.
<P>
  Of secondary concern to you is your security after the first year. If 
Turkey is hostile and sends a fleet south, he can still easily get 3 builds 
with his other units. Meanwhile, you he limits you to two at most. This means 
you could be facing a seven unit giant to your north while only having 4 or 5 
units yourself! A David and Goliath battle! The best defense may then be a 
good offense in the first year. You can support yourself into the Eastern 
Med. right off the bat, and launch an attack on southern Turkey with your 
fleet or even convoy your army there. You could also move to the Eastern 
Med. and Israel with your fleets, and support yourself into the Eastern 
Med. in the fall if you didn't make it in the spring. Unfortunately, these 
involve giving up some growth for better attack potential the second year. 
But there is also security in numbers, right?
<P>
  This brings us to positioning for the second year. Egypt is a bit unique 
in that the centers it gets in the first year are very spread out. Libya is 
2 provinces west, while Saudi Arabia is 2 provinces east and only if using 
a fleet and getting to it via the Red Sea. This means you have to plan 
carefully how to position your forces in preparation for the 1996, the 
second year.
<P>
  A first concern is where to send your lone army. If you send it to the 
Eastern Sahara and Libya, you then have the advantage of being able to 
attack Tunisia by moving from Libya to Algeria and moving a new unit into 
Libya, thus bordering Tunisia with two units from Africa. Combined with a 
fleet cutting a possible Maltese Sea support and you should be able to take 
it while Italy is distracted elsewhere.  Another advantage is that an army 
can defend Libya better than a fleet. If you are attacked by Italy in 
Libya, you can retreat to Algeria and have a chance of retaking Libya. 
Otherwise, Italy can easily block any attempt you may make to retake Libya 
by simply supporting Libya from Tunisia.
<P>
  Tunisia is precious little gain for making a powerful enemy like Italy 
though, so unless defense is your reason for moving the army to Libya, you 
should be very sure of your alliance with Turkey or things could turn ugly 
soon. Another alternative for your army is to move it to Israel, thus 
taking Libya with a fleet. By moving the army to Israel, you can move on in 
the Middle-East to Syria and perhaps Iraq, and be able to put pressure on 
Turkey's eastern front at the same time as you launch an attack from the 
south. If you are planning to attack Turkey, you almost have to attack by 
land as well as by sea, since otherwise you are only threatening two of his 
centers and he will have enough units to keep you at bay.
<P>
  Another tactic is to move a fleet to the Red Sea in the spring of 1995 
and convoy your army to Saudi Arabia. The following year, you can move your 
fleet to the Arabian Sea as you move to Iraq from Saudi Arabia. This gives 
you two units bordering Iran in the fall of 1996 and if you are lucky, you 
will be able to take it from Turkey. This probably involves giving up Libya 
(though you could wait to take Israel instead), but if you let Italy take 
Libya, you may gain an ally against Turkey? Or an enemy on your western 
flank.
<P>
  Finally, you should also think before sending a fleet to Saudi Arabia in 
1995. If you move it there, it will take all of 1996 to get it back to 
Cairo and for it to be of use in the Mediterranean. It may be better for 
you to force your way into the Eastern Mediterranean right in the spring of 
1995 and launch a preemptive strike on Turkey. Still, if you go for Saudi 
Arabia in 1995, you get an extra unit to compensate for it and you can use 
it to pressure Iran, or at least keep Turkey out of Saudi Arabia, so in my 
opinion, it is usually worth it.
<P>
  What should you do beyond the first few years?  Egypt has the choice 
between going north and west. There are 33 centers bordering the southern 
seas, from Gibraltar and Morocco in the west, to Rostov, Georgia and Iran 
in the east.  This is probably what you have to aim for to win the game. It 
is possible to get centers north of the Black Sea, especially since Egypt 
has a quick route north through Iran and Kazakkstan, which can often catch 
a northern power off-guard. Egypt can establish a small early presence 
there in the guise of helping Russia, Ukraine or Poland against one of the 
others, and then move in in full force once Turkey is taken care of. Any 
center you capture there is one less you have to capture in the Western 
Med.
<P>
  As for how to move west, that is tough as well. This is where the army in 
Libya comes in handy, as you can move west and then get that extra support 
into Tunisia and hopefully break into the seas west of Italy. It is hard to 
replace a fleet in Libya with an army though once Italy is defending itself 
against you, because doing this could allow him to capture Libya. It is 
unfortunate, but your best chance for getting an army into Libya is in the 
very first year of the game. You can still make it through, especially if 
the west is not united under one power. You should therefore strive to have 
Italy and Spain, or some other naval power, remain relatively deadlocked in 
the west while you take out Turkey. This can be hard to do since Italy is a 
natural ally against Turkey. For those reasons, the best ally for Egypt, in 
my opinion, is Ukraine, with Russia as a back-up if Ukraine falls early in 
the game.
<P>
  All these strategy suggestions assume that you will attack Turkey first 
and not Italy. It is possible to pursue an alliance with Turkey though, and 
this alliance can be really strong. Your strength as a corner power is 
extended to your ally, Turkey. You can easily make gains against Italy and 
Turkey can be devastating in the north and in the Balkans. For this reason, 
I would say that a Turko-Egyptian alliance is potentially the strongest in 
the game (witness the Lyon game on USEF for the best example).  Where the 
alliance breaks down though is in your vulnerability to each other. This is 
because the Eastern Mediterranean borders three Egyptian centers (including 
Israel) and two Turkish ones. For this reasons, it should be an obvious DMZ 
between you. Furthermore, under no circumstances should you let Turkey 
build more than the two fleets he needs to occupy the Black Sea.  If Turkey 
is allied with you, he does not need more fleets, as you will be the naval 
power protecting him from Mediterranean enemies. Have him concentrate on 
the north, and keep him happy by staying out of the Eastern Med.

<H3>Allies for Egypt in Modern</H3>

   Who should you ally with as Egypt in Modern? As I stated in the strategy 
section, Ukraine, or possibly a strong southern Russia, are your best 
choices for an ally in the early game, and even in the mid game (but don't 
completely rule out Turkey and Italy). This gives you a chance to take out 
Turkey. You don't want to be at odds against Italy though, since a united 
Turkish-Italian front means all your neighbors are against you. Being 
allied with Italy is not so good though, because he will soon get in your 
way and may decide to take you out. The best option is to keep him involved 
elsewhere. This makes the dominant force in the Western Med., be it Spain, 
France or Britain, someone you want to talk to.
<P>
  Once you grow to a comfortable size, you will have to decide whether you 
want to win by taking over Ukraine or Russia, or by moving west of Italy. 
Your allies should then be a logical step forward at that point. If Poland 
is still around, you could talk him into attacking Ukraine or Russia along 
with you, similarly, you could talk Britain into attacking Spain or France 
if they are the strong power in the west. Chances are that Britain will be 
around at the end if you still are, and even that he may be your main 
rival, so tread carefully if you don't want someone else to win!

<H3>Player Comments on Egyptian Security</H3>

Rick Desper feels that "Libya is weak, and probably can be taken by a
concerted Italian attack in the second year (but) I would still think the
most concerted attack would take at least five years to take out Egypt."
<P>
According to Mikko Laitinen, "(Egypt) appears to have a rather weak starting
position, but it has a 
benefit of easily defensible home centers. If he survives the first year 
fight against Turkey, Italy is next pounding on his door.  If he survives 
that also, it usually means Italy is being killed by someone very powerful 
and it's a bit late for Egypt to make any run for a solo anymore.  But it 
can be a very interesting position to play anyway."

<H3>Player Comments on Egyptian Unit Positioning</H3>

Stephen Breininger believes that, "in order to be successful, Egypt has
to occupy the Eastern Mediterranean Sea," adding that
"if Egypt is only going after 2 supply centers, then he should go after 
Israel and Saudi Arabia? During the next year I'd move
Army Israel to Syria and Fleet Saudi Arabia to Iraq.
This would allow you to turn your useless fleet in Saudi Arabia into a 
useful defensive line by having your army in Syria support your fleet in 
Iraq. Then with the rest of my forces, I would continue my naval assault on 
Turkey."
<P>
Cautions Simon Withers, "an enemy fleet in the East Med is very, very bad."

<H3>Player Comments on Egyptian Strategy</H3>

Brian Burkhart is of the opinion that
"the Egyptian opening is essentially one dimensional.  It allows for the
capture 
of Saudi Arabia and Libya without opposition and either with a compliant Turkey
or strong early moves, Israel can be attained as well.  After that, the 
moves progress westward to eventually capture Tunisia when continental 
pressures forces I to give up support in the south.  Early alliances in the 
north will spell doom for the Egyptian offensive if Italy has faithful allies.
An I/T alliance with a helpful Israel is death to Egypt."
<P>
Bob Shepard adds that
"with Egypt, the first year usually involves gently picking up Libya, 
Israel, and Saudi Arabia, all without disturbing anyone else, all without 
having to commit to anything concrete."
<P>
Writes Rick Desper, "If Ukraine is gone and Egypt holds Rostov, three forces
(Rostov, 
Caucasus and Iran) will hold the East.  Ankara and Izmir support Istanbul, 
Alexandria supports Eastern Sahara, and two fleets support Fleet Eastern 
Med.  Eleven forces supported by 12 SC's."
<P>
James Gemmill feels that "Egypt should seek two partners rather than one, and
those partners should be along the southern or eastern side of the board,
taking advantage of Egypt's corner position."
<P>
"(One) option is to attack Turkey by land," says Stephen Breininger.
"But I think this plan has 
flaws. First it will take a while to move the armies into place. And 
second, your fleet in Saudi Arabia is out of place. Sure, it can help 
attack Iran from the Persian Gulf, but then it is even further from where 
it belongs, which is back in the eastern part of the Mediterranean Sea.  If 
you insist, build your armies and see how long your homeland stands up to a 
naval attack!"

<H3>Player Comments on Allies for Egypt</H3>

<H4>Turkey</H4>
James Gemmill speaks from experience here.  "Having played Egypt, it is my
feeling that under no circumstances should a 
long-term alliance with Turkey be pursued. While possible, it offers the 
most limited range for expansion and the greatest exposure to a stab, as 
your lines of communication along the African coast will be
long."
<P>
Brian Burkhart feels that "the E/T alliance in modern is potentially the most
lethal.  However, I've 
seen numerous times that as Turkey approaches 10 dots, Egypt is usually
smaller, at eight or so.  Inexorably, Turkey goes after Egypt and the alliance
breaks down. However, 
if left alone, Egypt can eventually make tremendous progress against Israel
and Italy. Eventually, Egypt will make a landing in Italy and drive up the
peninsula to hook up with Tuerkey.  This final E/T alliance can proceed easily
to a two-way, and with reasonable diplomacy one of the two will make the
essential stab on the other in late endgame to get the solo."
<P>
Simon Withers notes that "Egypt has to go through Turkey if Egypt is to get
to any SC's" and Stephen Breininger adds: "you know that Egypt and Turkey will
be at war soon enough."

<H4>Italy</H4>

Italy, says James Gemmill, "can make a good ally if Tunisia and Libya can be
resolved. It is perhaps 
best to concede TUN as it is difficult to defend vs. the Italians, and 
often Italy will concede LIB for the same reason. In an anti Turkish 
campaign, Italy can make a good, if limited partner, rarely able to provide 
substantial help, but then rarely able to feast on the Turkish prize. Watch 
out for his Navy!"
<P>
Stephen Breininger says,
"the Italian player will probably want Egypt and Turkey to have a 
long-drawn out battle. A quick and decisive victory by either Egypt or 
Turkey will mean trouble for Italy! [Egypt] could possibly offer Libya to 
Italy as a peace offering."

<H4>Ukraine</H4>

James Gemmill feels that the Ukraine is
"definitely a nation whose friendship you wish to (initially) pursue. Can 
provide a good counterweight against Turkey, and can provide a virtually 
stab proof alliance if you occupy Istanbul. With Turkey out of the way, you 
can continue on with Ukraine vs. Italy or you can make contact with Russia 
and try and force the Black Sea for a conquest of Ukraine."

<H4>Russia</H4>

Russia is "of interest early on only to maintain the security of Ukraine."
James Gemmill also adds that Russia "can make a good mid-term ally."

<H4>Triple Alliances</H4>

James Gemmill writes:
"In combination with (Spain and) Italy, you can divide up the map board three
ways on a north-south axis into spheres of conquest. This troika I think is 
Egypt's best strategy, as you can write it into your alliance that if one 
stabs the other 2 will punish. Thus, Egypt and Spain will gain security vs. 
Italy, while Italy, admittedly the weakest in this arrangement being in the 
middle, can gain some security as well. Can be easily hidden via false 
bounces in the Med., and Egypt may be the slowest to grow, but does provide 
ample opportunity. The post Turkish conquest period may pose a problem in 
forcing the Black Sea with a fleet. The other East-West combination - 
Russia, Ukraine and Egypt - is possible too."
