Good luck,
I applaud your effort and your energy, you really have a good zine 
there.  If I end up doing the paper I want next fall on rational 
choice and perception, I will try to get that prof (he's a different 
one) to let me do in with Diplomacy, and then you'll have your part 
two.  I will be back in the States next Tuesday for a month, and my 
e-mail will be forwarding from here to various places, making me less 
than fully reachable.  Take it easy, and keep it up...
