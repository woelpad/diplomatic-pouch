(or The Importance of Switzerland in the Standard map)
</H3>
This issue I am pulling back from variant land and returning to the theme of
in-depth discussion of a single map province.  However, since variance is a
way of life (tm), I'm going to discuss the most unusual province on the
standard map - Switzerland.  Most Dippers I talk to never give any thought
to Switzerland.  The general thought seems to be...you can't move there, so
why worry?  Well, let me tell you....
<P>
Switzerland is the point around which central Europe pivots.  It acts as an
anchor for France, Germany, and Italy.  Without it, those countries would be
adrift in the resulting morass.  If Switzerland were a normal province, each
of those countries would immediately have a potentially new enemy or an
increased likelihood of attack by an existing potential enemy.  The decision
to include Switzerland as a province and make it impassable colors every
aspect of French, German, and Italian relations.
<P>
Consider the following table:<P>

<tr><Th>Power  <th>Front   <th>Potential Enemy/Ally
<tr><th>Turkey <td>Northern<td>Russia, Austria
<tr><th>       <td>Western <td>Italy
<tr><th>Russia <td>Southern<td>Turkey
<tr><th>       <td>Western <td>Austria, Germany, England

</table></center>
<P>
What we see is that the perimeter powers (Turkey, Russia, and England) with
their natural map edge anchors have only two fronts, with only three potential
enemies or allies (Russia has four but is compensated by getting the extra
starting unit).  Austria has four (!) fronts and four potential enemies and no
anchors but also has immediate access to the four Balkan SC's.  Germany also
has four fronts with four potential enemies but can be sure of one (and often
two) of the Denmark and Lowland SC's  France has three fronts with three
potential allies but usually has the luxury of tapping the Iberian SC's.  Weak
sister Italy has only two fronts with three potential enemies but has only the
Tunis SC as a
lock.  Note again, how Switzerland acts as an anchor for Germany, France,
and Italy.  All in all, this represents a fairly equitable situation, with
Italy getting the slightly short end of the stick.
<P>
Now, make a tiny little change to the map...just a little one...make
Switzerland a normally passable province.  What happens?  Disaster for
France and Germany, that's what.  Each is burdened with a new front or an
expanded existing front and, thus, a new or empowered potential enemy.
Italy suffers, too, but perhaps not as much.
<P>
For France, Italy now has the potential to attack by land from the south
(through both Piedmont <strong>and</strong> Switzerland) instead of just by sea,
and, all of a sudden, Italy
has more options than stabbing Austria or doing a Lepanto.  Worse yet, Germany
can now
bring three units to bear on Burgundy (Ruhr, Munich, and Switzerland), which
means continued French possession of Belgium is not likely.
<P>
For Italy, the Paris army is no longer a distant friend since it can be
assisting the Marseilles army in an attack on Piedmont as soon as Spring
1902.  And, disastrously, Germany is now a real threat to aid France or
Austria in Italian conquest since he now has a wider direct route to the
peninsula from Munich.
<P>
For Germany, the converse of both of the above is true.  France can vie for
possession of Switzerland in 1901 and, if he enlists Italian or Austrian
aid, can seriously threaten Munich regardless of German supports.
<P>
Strangely enough, though Italy is also threatened by a newly passable
Switzerland, he is also emboldened.  Since Switzerland doesn't border any
Italian SC's but does abut those of both France and Germany, Italy would
become the <em>de facto</em> power broker in the arena.  Better yet, in
order for him to protect his own interests in the eyes of France and
Germany,
he has a completely legitimate reason for entering Piedmont or, with
Austria's approval, Tyrolia.  Ultimately, Italy receives more of a boon than
a bane from this change.
<P>
France would be significantly hindered by the change and would be much more
difficult to play.  No longer could France safely assume a neutral neighbor
in Italy and focus his efforts and attention primarily on England and
Germany.  Nor could France count on being able to take both of the Iberian
SC's easily since the Marseilles army might never be able to head west.
France becomes a much weaker power as a result of this change.
<P>
Germany, however, suffers the most.  He ends up with five fronts and five
potential enemies.  Worse yet, the change strongly encourages France to ally
with England against Germany, not to mention the fact
that Italy and Austria now have some incentive to head north together as
well.  In my estimation, Germany would in all likelihood become unplayable
if Switzerland were passable.
<P>
I hope I've made it clear that, though Switzerland appears to be a lowly
little province that you can't even get to from here, in fact, it plays a
pivotal (yes...pun intended) role in the balance of the standard game.
However, you don't have to take my word for it.  You can check it out for
yourself.  Grab a history from any judge games playing Vince Mous' Modern
variant.  Though the map is very, very different, the central European
region is close enough to the standard map to illustrate my point.  I've
played or observed several Modern games and, in every one, Italy, France,
and Germany have become entangled in and around Switzerland.  The temptation
is just too great.  (This is no criticism of the Modern variant, by the
way...the other map changes balance this effect to make it a very enjoyable
variant.)
<P>
'Til next time.
