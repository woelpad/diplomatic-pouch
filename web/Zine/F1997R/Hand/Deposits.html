<H3>Let's Get Right to the Mail....</H3>
I am always wanting to give this column a theme of its own by the
presentation of a topic for discussion, so here's a quick one.
Let's say that in a standard game of Diplomacy, a power owns
ten supply centers.  Send in a piece of mail that specifies a power
and says how many of the ten units you are entitled to are armies,
how many are fleets, and how many you would like to have waived.
A wide field, yes, and of course the necessary situation specificity is
not provided, but perhaps we can see how "naval" each power is
generally considered to be.  What do you say?
<P>
Beyond that -- my latest attempt to start a dialogue here -- I see no need to
preface any further the incoming communications that appear below, so here
they are.

<H3 align=center>Mail Received Concerning
<a href="/Zine/F1997M/Mayer/Payola.html">Overheard at the
Ministry of Finance</a></H3>
<HR>
<H4>From Doug Essinger (<a href=mailto:revref@nb.net>revref@nb.net</a>):</H4>
I have read your article about the relative costs of each supply center,
and your comments about designing a variant based on this information.
<P>
In giving your comments some thought, I have come to the tentative
conclusion that setting a supply center's revenue generation value on
its cost of maintanence is not realistic, and provides little in the way
of creating new reasons for going after a center since the costs of
acquisition and maintenance is directly proportional.
<P>
However, I think that to base the supply center's revenue generation
value on its attractiveness (which seems to me to be well defined by
your "silver" metric) would add a very interesting dynamic. And I think
that the "financial" dynamic of which supply centers to conquer can be
enhanced by a second, simple addition: increase the value of home supply
centers for their original owner. Let me explain.
<P>
First, I would take your "silver" metric and use it to assign generic
revenue generation values to each supply center. This should relatively
well reflect the attractiveness of ownership. Then I would add another
bit of revenue generation value to the home supply centers of each
country <B>for that country only</B>; I would also have the country's
capital generate a bit more revenue than the other two centers.
<P>
An example: the "silver" metric assigns a revenue generation value of eleven
to Trieste, nine to Vienna, and ten to Budapest. (These are just numbers
pulled out of the proverbial hat.) That would be the revenue generated
for any country other than Austria that controlled these centers. For
Austria, I would add another one AgP to Vienna and Budapest, and two to
Vienna for being a home supply center.
<P>
As I thought about the schemes, it seemed to me that this scheme "reflected real
life" better; in real life, citizens would generate more revenue for
their own rulers than for foreign occupiers.
<P>
In addition, I feel that this scheme will provide some interesting game
dynamics. First, I believe the higher country-specific revenue
differential for a capital SC would mimic the emotional ties to a
capital which seems to exist in real life by giving a greater financial
payout for the capital than for the other centers. Second, I believe
that the country-specific differential would create a pull toward a
country trying to defend its own territory by giving a greater reward in
higher income for a home center than for a neutral.
<P>
What do you think?
<P>
<B><i>[Author's response:
Thanks for your comments regarding modifying the SC payoff in Payola.
<P>While there is good basis for concluding that an adjustment is necessary,
I have to agree with you that the alternative of making the SC payoff proportional
to the Hand values is not perfect, and the discussion of how the adjustment
is to be made is really fully open.
<P>In your message, you suggested an alternative SC-payoff scheme with
two components:
<UL>
<LI>a 'generic value' based on the attractiveness of ownership, for which you
would propose Silver could be used</LI>
<LI>a value adjustment so that each countries home centres have an increased
payoff for that country alone, with possibly a capital HC having an even
higher country specific differential.</LI>
</UL>
One thought that occurs to me, is that the second point would likely increase
the initial survivability of each power. In Payola we have seen that Austria
is frequently at a disadvantage. One of the goals in any change to SC payoff
would be to correct this. Your scheme might
help by making it harder for Austria to be surrounded and swallowed right
at the outset.]</i></b>

Nothing personal, but since you're already using your computers for PBEM, why not use a map program that can be downloaded?  
<P>
It is easy, paperless, and pretty good.

I just read the interesting article on keeping track of 
games in the Fall '97 Zine.
<P>
My own solution has been quite a simple one. For each 
of the games I'm playing, I have set up a Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheet. I then put in a .bmp of the relevant Map as 
a background.
<P>
For Fleets and Armies, I have created small drawing 
objects in appropriate shapes and colours. I then move them
around the board as needed (Copying and deleting to show 
removals and builds.
<P>
I find this method very convenient not just for keeping 
track of games, but also for playing around with possible 
next moves.
<P>
I would guess that a healthy proportion of e-players 
have access to Excel or similar, so this solution should 
also be possible for them.

Leif,<P>
Thanks a lot for your great article on winning with Italy in the
Diplomatic Pouch.  Last weekend we played FTF just after I read your
article, and by pure luck I drew Italy.  I decided to give your strategy
a try, and it worked like a charm!  England, France and Germany got
involved in a long indecisive battle in the north, while Russia and
Turkey were both into taking out Austria, who died in Fall 1902.  I then
turned on Turkey with Russian help, while England and Germany were
pressuring Russia in the north to keep him from getting too big (and
thus he was dependent on my help!).  When Turkey was down to two I
stabbed Russia to jump to 12; meanwhile France was nowhere near the
Mediterranean as he stabbed Germany.  I was then able to turn west and
pick up the SCs I needed for the guaranteed victory in 1908.
<P>
My SC gains were as follows:
<ul>
<li>1901 - Greece, Vienna
<li>1902 - Trieste
<li>1903 - Tunis (stab Turkey and gain Russian trust)
<li>1904 - Serbia
<li>1905 - Budapest, Bulgaria, Constantinople, Smyrna (stab Russia)
<li>1906 - Ankara, Rumania (while moving west)
<li>1907 - Sevastopol, Marseilles, Spain
<li>1908 - Portugal
</ul>
So a hearty endorsement from me.  If you have any tips for the other
countries, let us in on them!

Larry, reading your article in the latest Issue of the Pouch came at a
time when I really needed it. There's a few paragraphs below explaining
why.
<P>
I've put a lot of work lately into trying to get The Auckland Diplomacy
Club up and running. When the second meeting feel on it's face due to
insufficient numbers I really questioned whether it was worth it or not.
I was able to more than satisfy my desire to play
over the net, and I guess that first stomach-knotting feeling of failure
got me down, and wondering whether it was worth struggling on.
<P>
Your article started a train of thought that has rekindled my commitment
to The ADC. I read your article, and thought 'Some day I'd like to think
I might be able to say I'd earned one of those' (A Doctorate in
Diplomacy), and while it's a long way of yet, I figured growing the ADC
from nothing to a full blown New Zealand National Diplomacy Network
would be a step in the right direction for the 'services to the hobby'
requirement.
<P>
Then I stood back and realised that was a pretty selfish reason to
continue. At that time I read Jared Fleshers: Baby Steps article, and I
e-mailed him welcoming him to the hobby. In that email I pointed out he
was one of the lucky ones who found the hobby early. One of the guys I
work with only 'found' Diplomacy when I taught him to play earlier this
year, and he commented that he rued not having found it 20 years ago.
<P>
That's when I realised that selfish reasons or not, I had to forge
ahead. If I didn't, who knows how many young Kiwi diplomats might never
find The Great Game?
<P>
So with my enthusiasm rekindled by you Larry, and also in no small part
by the efforts of Manus and everyone who makes the Pouch what it is, I
hope to have many more reports from the ADC for all to read.

<HR>
<H4>From Vincent Mous (<a href=mailto:vim2@rocketmail.com>vim2@rocketmail.com</a>):</H4>
I liked your account of the World Trip to Sweden. It was
fun to read about our John Adams dinner and the dip games you
played in. Have you come up with a solution to the early posting
of results which led to your not doing so well in the team competition?
<P>
  I'm not sure that Leif's argument was good. Actually, perhaps it
was, but he didn't carry it far enough. I ended up as second best
England during the tournament, with 14 SCs (during the team
competition, even) - but I didn't know how big the biggest England
was (15 SCs). I actually asked Leif a few years before the end
and he said he thought it was 11 SCs. If I had known, I might
have stabbed my ally earlier to have a better chance of taking
the best England prize.
<P>
  Well, one can always complain.

  What a wonderful site!  I introduced Diplomacy to all of my classmates at
the Defense Language School years ago ('88) and haven't really made time to
play since.  I am excited to be involved again, and want to thank you and the
staff for making that possible.
<H4>From Dan<!-- Abbott (<a href=mailto:abbott@dakota.net>abbott@dakota.net</a>)-->:</H4>
I would like to congratulate you on the new index page for the
Diplomatic Pouch.  While the site has always been of great use to
diplomacy players, the new, cleaner layout makes it more visually
appealing.
<P>
Congratulations.
