Hiya!  Glad to see another issue!

A couple of things.

1st, on the on-line survey, I get an error message saying the url is not
available.  I guess a new url is needed now that the zine has moved?

2nd, on lack of material.  You know I can sympathize on this subject!  I
get the same problem every issue.  All I can do is beg and whine, and
somehow the articles I need arrive at the last minute.  I haven't had to
skip an issue yet, but it may happen!

3rd, what do you think about moving the online version of DW onto the DP
site somehow?  As we all can see, when it comes to setting it up in an
attractive fashion I am all thumbs and not too interested in doing the
work.  However, if we could keep the delay factor where the articles
don't show up on-line until say 6 weeks after an issue comes out, I'd
love to discuss making on-line DW a sub-zine or sub-section of DP...we
could then move all the back-issue articles into an area as well.  I'd
just prefer it remain a sub-section so that people can be advised how to
subscribe to the print version (circulation has to be kept up or else it
won't be worth it, and if the print version died the non-emailers
wouldn't bother writing articles)...and I'd still want to leave out a
few of the articles each issue to motivate people to subscribe.  I
haven't given too much thought to this idea - I just came up with it
today - but if you have an interest I'd love to hear your thoughts.

I don't agree with this.  Let's say you are France and I am Germany.
You have stabbed me and I have fought back and now I am in Paris.  Now
we make peace with each other and agree that we'll work together to send
Paris to Burgundy.  We say that we'll spend 5 silver to do it, and that
you will spend 1 of the five and I will spend 4.  Here is what I would
put in:
    4 : A PAR - BUR
    5 : A PAR - BRE
This way, if you are screwing me and you do NOT put in your 1 AgP for
Par-Bur, I will go to Brest.  But if you do, I will go to Burgundy as
we planned.  If the bribe with the higher value always had precedence,
there would be no way to do this kind of contingency planning.

As it is, the system is the best of both worlds: I am ALWAYS able to make
the bribe with the highest value have first precedence if I want it to be
(by putting it highest in the list), but I am also always able to give
a DIFFERENT (lower valued) bribe precedence (as in the example above).

In fact, this is a good example of Payola strategy; it should make it into
your article series sometime.

That's the thing, though -- I can find Clancy Brothers stuff all over the
place.  I've found Dubliners on only two occasions: one on a CD of "Irish
Drinking Songs" which was a compilation of the Dubliners and the Clancys,
and a double-CD that I couldn't afford at the time and haven't seen since.

I'll certainly consider it; I've got lots more time coming up, as they
finally hired more people at work, so I'll be doing some more writing,
although I'm not sure just at the moment what I'd write about.

I had intended to do more with the musical, but ran short on time and
creativity.  Of all the things that I've ever put in my zine, though,
that's the one I got the most comments on. :-)

Manus,

I have just completed another paper on Diplomacy.  It is not the 
"perception theory" one promised in the first article, but instead a more 
theoretically informed discussion of Game Theory to the game.  I think it 
several orders of magnitude better than the first (for one thing, there 
are no direct references--and thus no glaring errors such as my confusion 
on the HoF versus the skills index--to PBEM).  Unfortunately (or 
fortunately) there is a very large and rather import embedded Word 6.0 
graphic, so dumping you the text is not an option.  Is there some way to 
translate this to a usable format, or would you be able to do this?  And 
when is the next issue of the Pouch due out?

Yours,

--dcr

Calling Stephen Agar, calling Stephen Agar...

Well, he may check in, but here are a few of my thoughts
(from the general to the particular):

1) Worry about the stalemate lines!  A lot!!  you need to decide
up front whether you want to try to avoid stalemate lines
altogether (generally thought to make an unbalanced game)
or to try to have roughly the same number as the current board.

2) Look at the ratio of supply centers to total spaces.  The
Dip board has (I believe) 75 spaces and 34 dots.  The general
rule of thumb from my point of view is to keep the ratio below
50%.  Otherwise, things get too crowded.  If it gets as low
as a third, then you have too much wandering around -- looking for battle.

3) Look at the average number of connected spaces for each space.
I like a lot of variation (even to the extent of the
famous Colonial Sakhalin example where the answer is one), but
you  need an average around four to avoid creating too many
stalemate line possibilities..... I forget what the Dip board
number is here, someone will remind me.  I say DON'T block
everything the same though, then there are no "terrain features".

4) Make your terrain interesting.  Make it have a reasoning or
purpose, whether it be historical or whatever.  If mountains 
are to be hard to cross, put lots of spaces there.  Make plains
large.  What about sea spaces and coasts?

That's all I have to say... but designing variant maps is  generally
understood to be very, very difficult.  And it may have a whole
lot to say about how yur game is to play, much more than your
little rules variations.

Good luck!
Jim

	Hi there.  How are you?  How did the perl-based judge project ever work out?

	I've been thinking about writing an article for the Diplomacy Pouch, and I
wanted to see what you think of the idea.  The basic premise of the article
is a historical argument.  I don't know how much historical stuff you have
in the pouch, I don't remember  reading much, but tell me what you think of
this.  

	I will argue that those that believe that World War I started "by
accident" or because people lost control of the situation are wrong, but
that it was a calculated effort by Germany alone that the Germans,
military, civilian, and Kaiser all together, consciously started in 1910
for reasons that are not only reasonable but also proved to be correct.

	Perhaps an article like this can be instructive for Pouch readers, perhaps
just an item of passing interest, but tell me what you think of the idea.
Hope you like it!

Oh, the shame.

It's just a matter of definition, I guess.  I was defining NOT as a
bid on everything except the indicated bid.  You defined NOT in a
different way (namely as a bid to hold plus bid on any other MENTIONED
bid).  That is a fine way define it.  I do think the new not will be
a more useful shorthand, though.

Cool trick you can do with the old ! bid (did I think this up on my
own, or did you tell it to me?)

Let's say that Russia has promised that he's going to bid 7 Ag to
clear Austria out of the way by moving from Ser-Alb (just
hypothetically, you understand).  I want to find out if he's lying.

I bid:

30 ! A Ser Hold | -Gre | -Bud | -Bul | -Tri | etc
(the not of all moves except Ser-Alb)

The thirty here is just to represent some number that is big enough
that I think it will outbid the opponent.

If the Russian hasn't bid on Ser-Alb, then my bid fails (and costs me
nothing).  Under the new system the Ser-Alb move would be considered
regardless, and I would have no indication of the fidelity of my ally.

	Well ... this was my idea for a column, which I'd be happy to
organize.  We've recently had some really funny press in a game I'm in and
I thought it would be cool to encourage the players and masters to send us
the "best of the broadcasts".  They could send it to me directly and I
could send it to you guys as an article after editing.  This would
hopefully be a very entertaining column and show the lighter side of
diplomacy. :) 
	I have in fact anothe specific game from a couople years ago which
I have in mind.  Fake press was allowed and the beginning was absollutely
hilarious.  Sorry for the typos ... experiencing some bad lag.
Unfortunately, I forgot the game name but I was in the game as Germany
(address bitn@midway.uchicago.edu, persona kaiserette Charlotte) and I
know the game was eventually won by Germany, at least in part.  Can you
possibly give me a suggestion as to how to find it.  It was on the
original morrolan judge (eff) I believe.

	This section looks like it would be particularly intersting.  What
would be involved in "maintaining" it?

Thanks,

Thanks!  Publish, publish, publish.  It's the price we engineering
research-types have to pay for having a job that lets us avoid 
doing *real* engineering :-)

But Manus, I'll always envy you for having a technical conference
publication on the subject of Diplomacy.  Nothing's better than
being able to combine work and your hobby.

	*blush*  Thanks. :-)  I've already started editing for one game
... I'll probably make a post to r.g.d. asking for good press too.

	BTW, I need the history for stab!   er, that's "stab!" ... it's

Subject: Nuclear Diplomacy
Status: RO

Greetings,

As an avid Dipper on Aol for about a year, I decided to sit down and write a
new variant that would include the use of nuclear weapons in the regular dip
game.  I'm currently (GM'ing) play-testing my first game and have some very
interesting things happen within the first three years.  So far
Austria/Hungary has nuked Vienna and Venice while a dying Russia tries to
deploy nukes as a last ditch effort for survival.

As a GM of other regualr dip games, I have not seen such an enthusiastic
crowd of players which write volumes of press....demanding the destruction of
the "evil weapons".  Unlike other games, there is an excitement in the air
which gives players with a dying country some real consideration before they
go down.
Players have told me that negotiations have become very tense as to who will
build or wont etc....

So what is this all about?  Allow me to give you some of the basic rules to
Nuclear dip.  Each nation is permitted to build four nukes throughout the
entire game in order to limit players from going crazy.  The new unit (nuke)
which is built during the normal builds and disbands phase carries many
responsibilities and careful consideration.  While on the ground(not
launced), the nuke carries no power and always loses to conventional combat
(support can be transfered through other units to the nuke giving a power of
one).  When the nuke IS launched, it only has a range of one with the
following result....destroys supply center for the entire game, destroys any
unit in that territory, and makes that territory impassable for one season
following the nuking.

I have of course left out many of the rules.  I had to go back and rewrite
the rulebook in order to avoid picky players from shooting holes through it.
 So far, the players have been very careful about the usage of nukes and seem
to be enjoying the game for which has had no bugs thus far.  I've tried to
keep the game as simple as possible without changing the fundamental rules of
the game.  

If you think you would be interested in more details, I would be happy to
send them along....thanks for taking the time to read this note.  

Nukem!

Bob

H.M.!!

If you're serious about using that little "rule of thumb" of yours in
the DP, why not say that my question was a "letter to the editor"?  Only
thing is, I don't want my name attached (since the player - my ally -
potentially could read the letter and know what I was thinking).

I did a similar study a while back, referencing about 70 PBEM judge
games.  We agree on 3 of the 5 least-occupied provinces, although I find
it hard to believe that Eas Med could be one of the five.  Maybe your
F2F
games had a lot of strong Turkeys.  Here are the comprehensive results:

The following list is taken from 70 standard Dip games, and the total 
number of seasons that are examined to determine occupancy or vacancy 
for a given province is 1906. This includes all seasons from Winter 
1900 until the final season of the game.  There are two seasons per 
year, with the exception of 1900 and possibly the final year. The table 
lists all provinces with the occupancy rate (the 83.3% for the North 
Sea means that the North Sea isoccupied at the end of 83.3% of the 
seasons in this study). On the right are listings for Seas, SC's, and 
other provinces.

The average occupancy rate is 42.4%. This is slightly lower than 34/75 
= 45.3% because there are fewer than 34 units on the board for the 
first few years of each game. This also implies that there are an 
average of 31.8 units on the board at the end of each season.

Next time I play Turkey, I'm opening Smy-Syr, just to catch everyone 
off guard. ;-)

-- Not as funny as you think. Sending garbage-looking Partial-Press
messages which are actually encrypted *can* have diplomatic value.

For your reading pleasure, attached is an excerpt from my most recent
End-of-Game-Statement. I was Turkey. Enjoy.


	My original plan was to stab Austria only, and hope Russia will
continue to "go-with-the-flow" and continue to forgive all my
infraction. Given that Austria, very publicly, didn't allow me to
eliminate Russia when the two of us (AT) could have safely divided the
Russian centers, one would expect Russia to be loyal to Austria
subsequent to a Turkish stab. However, I figured I knew Russia longer,
and that as long as he is under no immediate threat, he would more
likely side with me than go down in flame with Austria. That plan
changed, when one of my "change of orders didn't reach me in time"
allowed me to remain in a Russian center in the Spring, I figured I
might as well not take the chance and just fry Russia as well.

	Throughout the game I have sent a huge number of pieces of "useless
information", chats, jokes, smalltalks, etc. NONE of it was ever idle.
There was always some reason, some impression I wanted to create, some
long-shoot plan to seed, etc. The various stories about my profession
were examples. Almost always, nothing came of those - but heck, there is
no Diplomatic cost to spreading those seeds - but if something did come
up it would have been significant. At this juncture, one of my more
creative (if I may say so myself) little exercises came about. A message
sent after I talked England to swap a fleet into StP, 2 seasons before I
stabbed Austria, but while I was in the thicket of laying the groundwork
for that stab, before I changed the plan to also stab Russia. This
message attracted the attention of the Master. Read the message, see if
you can see what's going on and why, and then read my explanation of the
plan to the Master:

Message from Turkey to Russia in 'front':

Decoded by the Turkish defense ministry using powerful computers, world
class number theorists, psychics, and the fact that whoever wrote the
message forgot to take off the post-it with the cipher-key written on.

Decoded version: Moneypenny has been transferred to MI5. Period. Her new
duties include harassing posters to rec.games.diplomacy. Period. A small
change in the spelling of her name has been authorized. Period. This
will
help mask her new identity. Period. This message is classified top
secret, level three-black-diamonds. Period.


White Turkey.


(Around that time, some nut posted to RGD, among many newsgroups, his
claim that MI5 heads a huge conspiracy to harass him and drive him
insane. In most newsgroups, such paranoia is ignored or responded with a
concerned "this man needs help". In RGD, the combination of paranoia and
British intelligence is just too much not to have started a long thread
of "in" jokes. The "Decoded version" was making a distant reference to
that thread).

	The "Decoded version" is a red herring. If you haven't already, try
decoding the message yourself. It's really a simple code (answer at the
end of the EoG). Here is the explanation I gave the Master at the time
(read after you have completed decoding the message):



Message from Turkey to Master in 'front':
[...]
The objective is to get Russia on my side after I stab Austria. Here are
the details.

England has written to me that he will stab France. I have also lied to
France that the reason for his poor outcome last turn was that England
betrayed their plans. The truth is that AIRT had a very good plan as it
was, and in addition France goofed (or EF miscommunication, etc). It is
always easier for a player to believe that the reason for a poor turn is
the treachery of his allies than his own goofs. Given that, if EF will
ever fight each other, I expect it to happen this year. Everyone else
seems to believe that as well, although I have been loudly "arguing"
that this is all a ruse (and hence AIR need to continue to selflessly
allow Turkish units through their lines to fight the EF threat).

I pressured England to swap a fleet into StP/NC, so as to give me a free
hand in the North. I made it clear I won't stab my allies before I see
that happens. After much discomfort he says he will do so.

Several years ago, I told Russia I am working on a plan to give him back
"life". No such plan existed, but it prepared the ground for me to offer
such a plan at a later time in case I needed to. When Russia was about
to go down to one unit (last turn) I resurrected that "plan" and -
without giving any details - encouraged him to take WAR (I suspect he
didn't need much). I figured that after I stab Austria, I rather have
the WAR center feed a Russian unit (which may or may not be friendly)
than an Austrian one.

Now, if everything goes according to the plan; in the Spring I will do
the alliance moves; EF will start fighting, and England will swap a
fleet into StP. In the Fall, when Austria reaches maximum
stab-vulnerability - I will stab him as hard as I can. If he follows my
plan exactly, I'll take RUM+BUD+TRI. If he follows it partially, I won't
take TRI. If Italy joins in (I have been slowly hinting that I'll be
receptive to doing so, and he is finally taking the bait!), then he will
get TRI (regardless which plan Austria follows in the Spring).


The difficult time would be after the stab. With Italy, I will have the
leverage of a legitimate alliance between two viable powers. From
Austria, I expect nothing but hostility (although, I will try - just in
case - some Diplomacy, apologies, etc. with him; to ease the process of
eliminating him). The question is how to get Russia to be on my side
instead of Austria's.

This is where I shall return to the old plan-to-give-Russia-life story.
I will point out that it was me who pressured England into swapping the
fleet into StP as part of the plan. I will suggest that he join me in
getting his share of Austria (VIE? BER?). With my SEV army away (in
RUM), and nothing of mine (or England) threatening Russia proper, this
will look like (and be) his best chance in years. The problem is how to
convince Russia that the English fleet swap was really part of my
pressure and a long complicated plan (to give him life) - as opposed to
me just taking post-facto credit for English action. (Especially if
England has already told Russia - as a sign of "friendship" or something
- that he intends to so do.

That's when I'll spring on him the correct decoding of the message. It
will prove that the plan has been there all along, and that credit for
the English fleet swap belongs to Turkey.

{Just for amusement, when I claim credit for the English swap, I will
make it a long crowing type letter attributing everything to Moneypenny.
Russia, if he continues to be as predictable as ever, will express some
skepticism at all those claims - and won't forget to make some sniping
remark about how come Moneypenny is back on the job. This will set
things up, just beautifully, for me to reveal the coding of the message.
(I'll still let Russia do the decoding, it's simple enough). I'll point
out that Moneypenny never left the job, and that she has the perfect
proof that she planned everything all along.}

If things don't work out as planned, I can always forget the whole
affair and never tell Russia a word about it. Alternatively, if at a
later time England does swap the StP fleet, I will be able to spring the
coded message up as needed.

This coded message, the "get-Russia-life" "plan", my press with Italy
about how Austria isn't a team player, and many others like it serve as
"freebies". If I need them later, I put them into use - having the
groundwork already prepared. If I don't, I forget about them.


The down side is if Russia guesses that he should decrypt the message. I
think it's unlikely. (That's why I put random digits for blanks. If I
used anything consistent, especially blanks, the coded message might
have looked like words and invited a decoding attempt). If he does,
there is still a chance he won't warn Austria. If he does warn Austria,
there is a chance Austria won't believe him. If he gives Austria a copy
of the message, it will look very weird and thus not very credible. (If
I'm confronted with the "evidence", I'll point out that if I wanted to
tell Russia about a stab I would say so plainly, and if I didn't I
wouldn't - why would I tell him in an encrypted message?). In any event
the stab isn't this turn but next so the warning would be mis-timed.
[...]



	The stab worked exactly as scripted. Russia was reduced to one unit,
Austria to 3, 2 of which in Germany. Italy and I were both growing, RFA
collapsing. Austria, just as expected, declared a holy suicide war on
me. I wouldn't have stabbed if I wasn't willing to face that.

	As it turned out, the opportunity to spring up the coded message never
materialized. England didn't swap a fleet into StP (he "tried" but
"failed"), I decided to stab Russia as well, and  - in any event - the
one-unit Russia, as expected, immediately went on to offer to work for
me.

.........................................................
The coded transmission of 1909:
"Turkey is pressuring England to swap a fleet into StP so Russia
can have a free hand to fight Austria after I stab next turn!
you should have tried decrypting it yourself"
.........................................................

You can relax, you are a proud member of MANSA, and your trademark is an
excellent quote. I would be happy if you write something about MANSA in
TDP. 

I have an article for you. It is about swedish Diplomacy history from
1972-1997. I will send it to you when it is done. But you will have, I
promise (!).

Manus,

This is a copy of an e-mail I sent to Jamie McQuinn.

Nic Chilton of the Gentle Art of Making Enemies gave me your name and e-
address and recommended that I let you know that a new issue of Mission
>From God is now out.

It's been 18 months since the previous issue, so in case you have
forgotten what it is, it is the listing of all known UK postal gaming
zines, most of which, of course, are Diplomacy based, although En
Garde!, United and multi-game zines are also listed.

The issue, which runs to 34 pages and lists over 140 zines, costs 1
pound including postage to European subscribers, 2 pounds including post
to non-European subscribers (sea-mail rate) or 3 pounds if they want to
receive it air-mail.  Cheques (in sterling) should be made payable to
me, John Harrington, if ordering direct or American subscribers can send
the equivalent amount in dollars to Jim Burgess, 664 Smith Street,
Providence, RI 02908.  Jim handles the US end of the International
Subscription Exchange.

As well as listing UK zines it has a few European, North American and
Australian zines too and I'm hoping to expand coverage of these in the
next issue, due in the second quarter of the year.

I'm hoping to get Mission From God on the WWW in February.  It will be
on http://www.fiendishgames.demon.co.uk "real soon now".  I'll let you
know when it is up there.

If you want any more details please let me know.

Regards

-- 
John Harrington

        We do have an article ready for you. The name is Mean, lean or
killng machine and is basicly about diffrent players approch to the game. I
think it's a wery good article on the diffrent aspects and it's defenatly a
good description on the "Swedich" approch to the game. The article is
written by Nils Lindeberg, my favorit for the titel in Gothenburg. No harm
ment to Pitt but he is defenatly the best allround player i ever faced in
DIplomacy. I hav much knowledge to thank him regarding the game.
I will also investigate the possebilitis to translate other articels for TDP.
I can do it myself, but will defanatly need a person (you?) to edit the text
into readably englich.
Happy salut.

COMMENTARY
----------

Another busy two months with 5 new judges going public: USUW, USMA,
USTR, USCT and FROG.  All of those except USMA are basically test
judges and do not carry many games yet, and yes, there is again a
judge in California.  The bad news is that the games from the old USCA
judge will not be continued.  However there is still hope that the
data can be retrieved for statistics (Hall of Fame !!) purposes.
Unfortunately USMA already had to be relocated to a different site and
is now hosted on the same site as USIN.

At the time of this writing NOTR is still down.  ZAPT is still waiting
to be relocated.

Again a new all-time high of ongoing games has been hit.



THE DIPLOMACY ADJUDICATORS
--------------------------

(Note: the number of games shows only the listed games, hence it may be off -
especially when a judge comes back up after a longer downtime a reasonable
number of games will be unlisted and not be reflected in the total.)

> >Thank you for writing back. I just wanted to know your opinion of each
> country. Which is your favorite?
>
Well, I guess I'm partial to England.  You get a lot of warning when someone
is coming after you and I just love the whole idea of convoying.  You can
really pull a lot of cool moves when convoying.

Turkey and England are known as the witches of Diplomacy.  Both are tough to
take down.  The thing about Turkey is that it may start slow, but if you can
break out, Turkey is about the toughest country to be put down.  Turkey has
to be played aggressively, because it does have that excellent defensive
position to fall back to if things go bad.  It can survive in its shell for
a long long time, so it is usually advisable to go for broke every chance
you get to get out of the shell (as long as you're sure that if you're beaten
back you can get to the safety of your home).

> Austria-Hungary has 4 potential allies or enemies
> so it would be a great country to play only if you are very skilled.
>
Austria is widely (and rightly) regarded as the toughest country to play.
Austria is too easily eliminated early.  The big thing to remember about
playing Austria is talk talk talk.  Talk more than you have ever talked
before, and if you can pull it off, you'll be in good shape.  When Austria
is played well, it takes solo wins more often than most every other power.

> Italy seems to be hard to enter, but also hard to expand from.
>
Italy is another tough one.  It usually starts slow (like Turkey) but the
thing is that it CONTINUES slow, and you have to just play it that way.  The
key to Italy is patience, patience, patience!  Italy has to let the world
fall apart around him while he is at peace with everyone and stuck on four
or five or maybe six supply centers for a very long time.  If you can play
Italy patient and peaceful, you will be rewarded for it in the end.

> If France can
> secure an alliance with either Germany or Italy, then it seems to have a
> good chance.
>
I've always liked France a lot, and an E/F (the "steamroller") is among my
favorite alliance structures.  Like Russia, France is situated across the
main stalemate line of the board and has a lot to say with how the game
goes.  Because it is positioned as it is, with lockable lines below and
above it, it makes France a bit tricky to play.  France has to maintain
good strength against England and Italy both, or risk losing the power
to control the west end of the line.  Any overextension toward one usually
invites the other into the MAO.  And any push into Germany might invite
them both.  The key to France is an iron-clad alliance with either England,
Italy, or both, and the ability to keep units at home to guard the MAO.

> Germany seems to grow quick, maybe to quickly for its own good.
>
Good analysis.  Germany is like Turkey and Austria rolled together.  It can
afford to be played aggressively, but it is very important to talk more than
other players, perhaps, and make a lot of friends.  Germany probably has the
most workable alliances on the board, and usually profits more than any other
country by the alliances it is in.  Austria talks and talks to get alliances
that secure it defensively.  Germany does the same but for OFFENSIVE alliances.

> England is hard just because it is an island.
>
Well, as I said, I actually like England and the fact that it's an island
(although your point of view is more prevalent than mine).

> Although I am tempted to think
> that Russia has a great initial position (if for no other reason than the
> fact that it has 4 supply centers), it can be ganged up on easily.
>
Russia usually does very well.  Some people condier it the easiest country to
play, while others disagree.  It is true that it can be stonewalled at the
beginning (and in my opinion, it usually does not, but of course this is
up to the diplomat in St. Pete), but if this doesn't happen, Russia is a
genuine power to contend with.  Russia is the one power that has to plan for
two very separate fronts right off the bat.  It's important to broker peace
in either the north or south and then work on expanding using the other one.
Like France, you must maintain both the north and the south, however, so as
not to lose the stalemate line.

> What do you think?
> 
Well, there you have it.  I'll be interested to hear your opinions.

To whom it may concern,

My name is Michael Guenter and I have a wonderful variant of standard
diplomacy that I would like to get on the judge.

In short, in this variant, the minors have units that can be
"influenced" by any major power that does not have a unit adjacent to
the minor`s SC.  The players are not allowed extra orders.  If they have
only three SCs the can only submit three orders - however, if they
choose to use any, or all of their orders on influencing the minors,
they may do so. ...

I would be happy to explain this in much greater detail, as well as
submit a set of the rules to anyone who may be interested in this
version.  In the meantime, I would just like to know whom I might
contact regarding the programming of a new standard variant.  

Your cooperation and time is greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,
Michael Guenter
