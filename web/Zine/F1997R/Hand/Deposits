Hello Doug!

Thanks for your comments regarding modifying the SC payoff in Payola.

While there is good basis for concluding that an adjustment is
necessary, I have to agree with you that the alternative of making the
SC payoff proportional to the Hand values is not perfect, and the
discussion of how the adjustment is to be made is really fully open.

In your message, you suggested an alternative SC-payoff scheme with two
components:


   * a 'generic value' based on the attractiveness of ownership, for
     which you would propose Silver could be used
   * a value adjustment so that each countries home centres have an
     increased payoff for that country alone, with possibly a capital HC
     having an even higher country specific differential.

One thought that occurs to me, is that the second point would likely
increase the initial survivability of each power. In Payola we have seen
that Austria is frequently at a disadvantage. One of the goals in any
change to SC payoff would be to correct this. Your scheme (do you have a
name for it?) might help by making it harder for Austria to be
surrounded and swallowed right at the outset.

Was this what you were thinking?

Frank,

I have read your article about the relative costs of each supply center,
and your comments about designing a variant based on this information.

In giving your comments some thought, I have come to the tentative
conclusion that setting a supply center's revenue generation value on
its cost of maintanence is not realistic, and provides little in the way
of creating new reasons for going after a center since the costs of
acquisition and maintenance is directly proportional.

However, I think that to base the supply center's revenue generation
value on its attractiveness (which seems to me to be well defined by
your "silver" metric) would add a very interesting dynamic. And I think
that the "financial" dynamic of which supply centers to conquer can be
enhanced by a second, simple addition: increase the value of home supply
centers for their original owner. Let me explain.

First, I would take your "silver" metric and use it to assign generic
revenue generation values to each supply center. This should relatively
well reflect the attractiveness of ownership. Then I would add another
bit of revenue generation value to the home supply centers of each
country **for that country only**; I would also have the country's
capital generate a bit more revenue than the other two centers.

An example: the "silver" metric assigns a revenue generation value of 11
to Trieste, 9 to Vienna, and 10 to Budapest. (These are just numbers
pulled out of the proverbial hat.) That would be the revenue generated
for any country other than Austria that controlled these centers. For
Austria, I would add another 1 AgP to Vienna and Budapest, and 2 to
Vienna for being a home supply center.

What do you think?

Doug

First things first -- no, I haven't thought of a name for this scheme.
Give me some time, though, and I might be able to do so. 

Second, you are correct in deducing that **one** of the reasons for
suggesting this scheme is to increase the initial survivability of each
country. (I am currently playing in my first Payola game -- as Austria.
And I will confirm your observations that it is very difficult to
survive as Austria!)

However, there was another reason for this suggestion. As I thought
about the schemes, it seemed to me that this scheme "reflected real
life" better; in real life, citizens would generate more revenue for
their own rulers than for foreign occupiers.

In addition, I feel that this scheme will provide some interesting game
dynamics. First, I believe the higher country-specific revenue
differential for a capital SC would mimic the emotional ties to a
capital which seems to exist in real life by giving a greater financial
payout for the capital than for the other centers. Second, I believe
that the country-specific differential would create a pull toward a
country trying to defend its own territory by giving a greater reward in
higher income for a home center than for a neutral.

Toward giving my thoughts greater clarity, would you be able to send me
the details of the "silver" metric you and Manus originally created?
With that in hand, I could shape a specific proposal for my idea (and
probably have thought of a name for this in the process).

Doug

About the pins and magnet article.  Nothing personal, but have people thought that if they are already using their computers for PBEM, that they can use a map program that can be downloaded?  

It is easy, paperless, and pretty good.
