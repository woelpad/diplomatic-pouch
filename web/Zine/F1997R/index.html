<i>Your Publisher:</i>
<A HREF="Hand/About.html">About The Diplomatic Pouch</A></b><dd>
Yeah, it's just another "About" column.  No big surprise here.  (Well, actually,
that's a lie.  There is at least one big surprise, so check it out....)
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Smithson/seaart.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Bif Smithson:</i>
<A HREF="Smithson/seaart.html">The Sealion Opening in Action</a></b><dd>
Have you been wondering whether the "Sealion" opening, described in these
pages by Edi Birsan earlier this year, works?  If so, Bif's article
should either convince you that it does, or scare you away from it.  Or both.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Holmes/borders.html">

<i>Jonathan McCue:</i>
<A HREF="Holmes/borders.html">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Diplomat</a></b><dd>
Since Moriarty escaped their snares, Holmes and Watson have the time to
discuss how they decided to stalk him where they did in last issue's "Case
of the Missing Border."
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Hand/Deposits.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Deposit.gif"></A>
<i>The Editor and the Readership:</i>
<A HREF="Hand/Deposits.html">Pouch Deposits</a></b><dd>
Even the most casual reader knows this is the letters column.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Richardson/cuttwo.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Tim Richardson:</i>
<A HREF="Richardson/cuttwo.html">The Unkindest Cut of All</a></b><dd>
In this second article of his series, Tim continues exploring the delicious
act of unprovoked betrayal that we all so affectionately refer to as the stab.
This time he discusses not stab-related strategy, but who is to blame for a
stab and what exactly a stab is.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Szykman/DipSearch.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/History.gif"></A>
<i>Simon Szykman:</i>
<A HREF="Szykman/DipSearch.html">Supply Centers, Anyone?</a></b><dd>
Ever have trouble locating just one more center for that elusive success?
Well, as long as your spelling and eyesight are in good shape, you should
be able to reach 18 and more in Simon's word search puzzle.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Glasson/Cat23.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Caitlin Glasson:</i>
<A HREF="Glasson/Cat23.html">All About Cat23</a></b><dd>
Cait is one of the leading lights in the Cat23 community of players.  Here
she (diplomatically, of course) "builds a bridge," offering a little history
and a description of the group.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Makin/conceal.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Wes Makin:</i>
<A HREF="Makin/conceal.html">Concealing Your Identity in the Press</a></b><dd>
Why play anonymously if everyone can tell who you are?  Wes offers some
pointers to keep yourself <i>incognito</i>.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Holmes/sultan.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Holmes.gif"></A>
<i>Manus Hand:</i>
<A HREF="Holmes/sultan.html">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Diplomat</a></b><dd>
Their last case behind them, Holmes is just settling in for a relaxing
evening when another Diplomatic conundrum is brought to his attention.
Luckily (as you know), these are just his fort&eacute;.  How about you?
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Windsor/lawdip.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Paul Windsor:</i>

<i>Tarzan:</i>
<A HREF="Tarzan/SailHo.html">The Sail Ho! Variant</a></b><dd>
Who can resist a variant with an exclamation point in its name?  If you're
a fan of fleets and convoys, chances are that your answer is, "Not I."
