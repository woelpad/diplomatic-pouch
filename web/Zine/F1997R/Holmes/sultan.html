<p align=justify>
My friend Sherlock Holmes and I were reclining in the quarters at Baker Street.
Holmes had just finished trimming the ferns that he tends so meticulously --
a weekly duty that interests me but very little.  He had taken a pipe from
the stand and a book from the shelf when the bell rang.  Lord Fortescue, the
Foreign Secretary, was announced and at once Holmes and I sprang to our feet;
I in deference to the man and his high office, and Holmes in smiling
expectation of a task we both suspected was to be laid for him.
<P align=justify>
We had realised from the calendar that the clever Diplomacy player, the Sultan
of Suwat, was overdue in demanding the annual payment to extend the lease on
the oil-rich port of Suwat.  Those readers who have been following my humble
writings are aware that Holmes had already -- by cleverly unraveling the
Sultan's cryptic payment terms -- <a href=../../S1995M/Woolley/Puzzle.html>secured</a> and
<a href=../../S1996M/Holmes/>once extended</a> this lease for the British
government.
<P align=justify>
Stepping quickly in, Lord Fortescue wasted no time in confirming our fears.
It was indeed a packet delivered by the Suwati ambassador that had
caused the Foreign Secretary to seek out my friend so hurriedly.  Laying 
papers from the packet onto the table,
<!--
Fortescue said that
the Suwati ambassador made quite a point of apology for the delay in
getting the documents to the British government, saying that he had been on
holiday and that he had only just returned to London via a fleet from Rome.
At this, Holmes' eyes lit up and -- even before having read the documents --
I had the feeling that my friend had already put in place a small piece of
whatever puzzle lay before us.
<p align=justify>
Lord Fortescue thereupon -->
Lord Fortescue explained that one of the documents -- the
official lease extension -- came direct from the Suwati capital,
but that the others came from the mysterious Sultan himself, who is apparently
travelling abroad.  With the air of a beaten man, Fortescue said that the
Sultan's terms of payment amounted to an
impossible chore.  Not only this, but the documents required that the chore be
accomplished very quickly, with the penalty being that the lease
on the Port of Suwat would otherwise be revoked.
<P align=justify>
We bent over the table and read silently.  Holmes occasionally paused to
stand erect and work at getting his pipe properly lit, and this enabled me
to finish reading the documents roughly simultaneous with him.  The first of
the documents -- a letter addressed from the Sultan to the very sovereign of
our nation -- read:
<blockquote><i>
Your Majesty:
<P align=justify>
Enclosed you will find the official Suwati state document that will extend the
lease held by Your Majesty's government on the facilities at Port Suwat.
Before this extension can take effect and before your payment therefor can be
received into my treasury, however, the extension document must be signed by
myself and by two of my ministers, each of whom is currently visiting one of
the many facilities that my government maintains around the world.
<P align=justify>
According to the lease agreement jointly negotiated by our two governments, I
am required to set the terms for annual payment on the lease.  Therefore, I
request and require that your agents should deliver the unsigned lease document
to me, and that they deliver to my ministers the letters I have
enclosed for them.  These letters, as you see, instruct my ministers
to join me here for the purposes of signing the document.  Once the three
signatures are affixed thereto, the lease will be declared extended.
<P align=justify>
With the greatest esteem for Your Royal Majesty and your subjects, I remain,
<P align=justify>
The Sultan of Suwat
</i></blockquote>
<p align=justify>
The state document that was contained in the packet was exactly as described.
It was quite a dry piece of work, with the obvious marks of having been
subjected to revision after revision by Great-Britain's best and most
verbose negotiators.  A page appended to the main document described the
extension of the lease presently due, and this specified a date -- only a
fortnight hence! -- by which the extension document must have obtained all
three required signatures, or the lease would be considered void.  The three
signature lines were marked for use by the Suwati Territorial Minister, the
Minister of the Treasury of the Sultanate of Suwat, and the Sultan himself.
<P align=justify>
The final two documents from the packet also bore the official seal of the
Sultanate, and these proved to be the letters that the Sultan had wished to have
delivered to his two ministers.  The two letters were identical to one another
in every respect, and they ran as follows:
<P align=justify>
<blockquote><i>
To the Ministers of Territory and of the Treasury:
<p align=justify>
As you are aware, the extension of the lease entitling the kingdom of
Great-Britain to the use of the oil facilities at the Port of Suwat requires
your signatures and my own before it can take effect.  I therefore instruct
that you both join me by the most immediate possible route, and together we
shall give the document our separate marks of approval.
<P align=justify>
As is customary for official business, all travel should only be undertaken
with the benefit of military escort.  I am notified that at each of your
locations stands the same type of military unit, ready and available for your
use.  Since peace yet reigns -- no mobilization of forces has been reported --
I am confident that you both can be fully accommodated for travel.
<p align=justify>
I had considered directing that the signing take place at one of your two
offices rather than here at my own location.
Despite the fact that one of you could indeed reach me faster than he could
reach the other minister, it is true that it will take more time for the pair
of you to join me here than would be necessary for you two to meet without me
at one of your two offices.
However, because my own signature is also required and since I cannot reach
either of your offices more quickly than you can come here,  no time could be
saved over holding our meeting at my location.
<!--
However, because the signatures would need to be
delayed until my own arrival, no time could be saved over holding the gathering
here where I am.
-->
<p align=justify>
So in the end -- although I myself am also attended here by a capable
escort -- I have decided to direct that you both should make the journey to
my location.  I am happy to know that you should arrive simultaneously, so
that neither of you will be bothered awaiting the other.
<P align=justify>
The Sultan of Suwat
</i></blockquote>

<!--
<p align=justify>
Beneath his signature on both letters, the Sultan had personally penned the
following post-script:
<blockquote><i>
<p align=justify>
On re-reading this letter, I see that I have forgotten to tell you my own
location and that of your fellow minister!  Happily, though, I also notice
that, if you know how long your journey to the other's location would
take is sufficient information for you both to positively
determine the other's location.
</i></blockquote>
-->

<p align=justify>
"Ludicrous!" I burst out, when I finished reading.  "The Sultan has indeed set
an impossible task this time, Holmes!  How can anyone possibly be expected to
deliver two letters without knowing where either of the recipients are located?"
<P align=justify>
"Not two, Doctor, but <i>three!</i>" Lord Fortescue exclaimed, "You see, we
have no information as to the whereabouts of the Sultan himself!  You are
perfectly echoing the thoughts of the government.  From Whitehall to
Downing Street, we all stand completely perplexed.  The sentiment is 
overwhelming that Mr. Holmes is once again the only hope for securing
the extension of the lease."
<P align=justify>
Holmes calmly lifted his eyes from his pipe-bowl (which was stubbornly refusing
his attempts to light it).  "Tut tut.  You give me far too much credit for
what are, in fact, simple feats of observation and deduction.  Why, it is
inconceivable to me that I am the only person in England who can so plainly
see where the Sultan and his two ministers are located."
<P align=justify>
Fortescue and I were astounded.  "What so, old man?!" Fortescue asked, aghast
and excited.  "You know where they are?"
<P align=justify>
"But of course, milord."  Holmes paused and chuckled.  "Clever chap, that
Sultan," he said, more to himself than to we who were now hanging on his
every word.  While Fortescue and I stood speechless, a smiling Holmes worked
on his pipe.  When it finally lit, he drew on it strongly a few times
before telling Lord Fortescue:  "I should imagine you would be anxious
to heed the Sultan's instructions and send these documents straightaway
to...."

<P align=justify>
Lord Fortescue was in such a rush to dispatch royal messengers with the
Sultan's documents that, after sputtering a genuine expression of gratitude
to Holmes, he left without even asking the great detective how he had arrived
at his conclusions.
<P align=justify>
(I am sure I need not record here the well-known fact that Holmes' advice was,
of course, correct, and that the all-important lease was extended with the
three signatures, exactly as prescribed by the Sultan.)
<P align=justify>
So it was that the Foreign Secretary left me alone in
the company of my friend, where I stood completely befuddled.  Holmes was
reluctant to explain his feat completely without Lord Fortescue's presence,
but I was able to get him to explain some of the initial points of the
puzzle to me.  This resulted in my spending the remainder of the evening
staring at the Diplomacy board, with fountain pen and paper, busily listing
routes from one space to another.  All the while, Holmes read silently and
every so often paused to smilingly inquire how I was doing.

<p align=justify>
I felt that I
was finally beginning to make some progress when I was suddenly called
away -- to attend to the unfortunate victim of an overturned hansom cab -- so
I too had to wait to conclude the adventure until the morrow broke.
<P align=justify>
Early the next morning, Fortescue returned to Baker Street.  He reported that
he had been unable to find sleep, so consumed was he with curiosity as regards
Holmes' methods.  Thereupon, Holmes satisfied us both with a lucid explanation
of his reasoning.  Someday soon I intend to find occasion to chronicle his
fascinating exposition in these very pages.
