<H2>More Hints for The Dead-Letters Affair</h2>

"It is quite elementary, Watson!  To begin with, you surely see which type
of units (armies or fleets) must be at the ministers' locations.  Given the
three clues you placed at the end of your list, they could only be armies,
since every fleet in any set of two can obviously reach the other's location
in exactly the same number of moves.  (Except the fleet at St. Petersburg, of
course -- many non-Russian fleets could reach the north coast before the
Russian fleet from the south coast could make the reverse journey.  However,
as you surely see, other requirements of the Sultan's letter rule out this
possibility.) Since this much was doubtless already clear to you, this
certainly is not the next deduction that you are seeking."
<p align=justify>
I just nodded silently (I had not made the deduction Holmes had recounted,
but now that he had explained it, that much <i>did</i> seem, as he said,
elementary).
<p align=justify>
Having determined that I wished to proceed beyond that issue, Holmes
continued.  "Simply think about what your final three clues there are telling
you about the <i>number of moves</i> it takes each minister to reach the other.
Surely you can see <i>precisely</i> how many moves the trip takes in each
direction."
<p align=justify>
Surely I didn't.  After a few minutes thought, however, I understood what
Holmes was saying.  Those three clues did indeed tell a lot about the travel
time not only from each minister's location to the other, but from each to the
Sultan's site!  They specified that one minister could reach the other faster
than he could reach the Sultan, but that the other minister was in the
<i>opposite</i> situation (able to reach the Sultan quicker than he could
reach the first minister).  Combined with the fact that both ministers could
reach the Sultan simultaneously, I was able to conclude

much about the locations!
<!-- that it would take one
of the ministers no less than <b>two</b> moves longer to reach the other
minister than it would take that other minister to make the reverse journey!
-->
<p align=justify>
Obviously, the two ministers were not in adjacent locations (such as Munich
and Berlin), for then each would only take a single move to reach the other's
location.
<p align=justify>
<!--
It quickly also became apparent that
-->
I then considered whether the shorter trip could be a mere two
turns in length. A bit of investigation and thought showed me that if an
army (at the outset of the game) can reach another's location in two moves, the
longest it could take to make the reverse trip is only three moves.  For
example, the army in Budapest needs only <i>two</i> moves (and aid from a
Black Sea fleet) to reach Constantinople, but the army at Constantinople
requires <i>three</i> moves to reach Budapest when the game begins.
<p align=justify>
I had just set out to determine whether the ministers could indeed be located
at such a pair of locations (that is, a pair having just such a "two moves in
one direction, three in the other" relationship to each other).  Something in
the back of my mind was bothering me about this possibility, but before I
could lay my finger on it,

<!--
From this, I realized that the shorter of the two journeys would require
precisely <i>three</i> moves, and the longer journey would take <i>five</i>
moves.  (I knew that they could take no longer, because Holmes allowed that it
was "quite obvious" that the speediest route an army could take from any supply
centre to any other was never more than five turns in length.)
<p align=justify>
This also concluded for me the fact that the Sultan was <i>four</i> moves
distant from each of the ministers!
<p align=justify>
Excited, I sat to begin my investigations to locate the sites
that fit the requirements.
<!--
After an hour of this, though, I was crestfallen,
for I had found more than the single set of sites I had expected.  I approached
Holmes with my problem, explaining my approach and asking if it was in error.
<p align=justify>
"Not in error at all, Watson!  You are working well toward the solution."
Looking at my notes on the table, he added, "I see you are wasting a lot of
time unnecessarily trying to locate the Sultan, when it would be far more
efficient to first completely concentrate on the ministers' locations, but
other than the time wasted on this, you are proceeding quite nicely."
<p align=justify>
"But Holmes," I protested, "don't you see?"  Pointing at my papers, I said,
"the trio could be here, here, and here, or on the other hand" -- pointing
elsewhere now -- "there, there, and there, or...."  Exasperated, I looked to
Holmes for assistance.  "Surely I must have made a wrong turn somewhere to
have found more than one possibility."
<p align=justify>
"No, Watson, you have not erred.  Keep right on with listing the possibilities.
As you'll find, they are very small in number.  In fact, you will <i>need</i> to
have such a list at your disposal in order to work the Sultan's final clue."
<p align=justify>
"Final clue?" I asked, disappointed that I had missed something in my
initial distillation of the puzzle.
<p align=justify>
"Oh yes, Watson, his final clue -- cleverly concealed in the little postscript
he appended to the ministers' letters.  With that clue and with your list,
the ministers' locations are obvious, and from there, the Sultan's site is
quite easy to determine."  Holmes returned to his chair, obviously intending
that I set myself back to the task.  He was secure in the knowledge that I
now had all I needed to finish.
<p align=justify>
As I recounted, I didn't get the chance to finish this effort.  A

a messenger
from my office arrived and I hastened to dress the wounds of an
accident victim.  I did not get back to the Sultan's puzzle until the next day.
