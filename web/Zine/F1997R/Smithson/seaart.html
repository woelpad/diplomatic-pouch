<B>Introduction</B>
<P align=justify>

I don't know about the rest of you, but if I had to list the <i>main</i>
reason I read The Pouch, it is to get ideas for future Dip games.  Therefore,
I was very interested to read Edi Birsan's 
<A HREF="../../S1997M/Birsan/Sealion.html">The 
Sealion Opening</a> in the Spring 97 Movement issue.
<P align=justify>

Fortuitously, Edi's theme also happened to coincide with my own preferences:
that France and Germany's best interests are served when England dies 
quickly.
<P align=justify>

Not to say that I was buying into Sealion without reservations.  Edi didn't 
go too far in covering English responses, nor did he investigate how Italian
and/or Russian intervention might affect the plan.
<P align=justify>

I decided that I had to actually try out the Sealion myself.  A few weeks 
later I signed up for a new game and asked for France as my first preference,
with Germany second.  
When the game filled up, I found I was France. I resolved to write to Germany 
first, and ask if he was interested in the Sealion.  Much to my surprise and 
delight, less than two hours after countries were assigned I got a letter from 
Germany listing the URL to the Sealion article, asking if <i>I</i> wanted to try 
it.  Needless to say, I wrote back immediately stating that I had had the same 
idea, and committed to the Sealion.

<P>
<B>Pre Game Maneuvering</B>
<P align=justify>

With the main decision already made, the rest of the pre-Spring 1901 time period 
was given over to misdirection.  I asked Italy to DMZ Piedmont, and said that 
if it worked out, we could also DMZ North Africa, the Western Med, and the Guld
of Lyons.  Italy agreed to the 
DMZ with no conditions attached.
<P align=justify>

England was trickier, if only because I was lying to him from the word go.  We 
decided to DMZ the Channel, and England stated that he wanted to work with me 
to take out Germany.  However, nothing progressed beyond this statement -- we didn't 
even discuss who would get Belgium in Fall of 1901.  I must confess with some guilt that 
I didn't <i>want</i> to write a lot to England.  I intended to use the lack of 
writing as a partial excuse for my forthcoming move into the Channel.

<B>The Game</B>
<P align=justify>

Spring 1901 arrived with only one problem -- Italy moved to Piedmont.<BR>  
<P align=justify>
<A HREF="seamove.html#Spring 1901"><B>Actual game moves</B></A><br>
<P align=justify>

I decided to use my army in Spain to defend Marseilles, risking the chance of not gaining 
Spain if Italy stood pat.
<P align=justify>

England wanted to know why I had sent a fleet to the Channel after we agreed to DMZ it.
As planned, I told him that since we hadn't written that much, and no firm plans were 
made, I hadn't been sure if he was serious about an alliance, or if he had been setting 
me up.  I also said that I had heard a rumor that <i>he</i> was going to the Channel, but 
implied that Italy had sent me the rumor in order to set me up for his move of <tt>Ven-Pie</tt>.
<P align=justify>

Spring 1901 also brought the first "what-if" of the Sealion.  In our game, England 
opened <tt>Lvp-Edi</tt>.  This meant that London could only be covered by the fleet in the North Sea; he could not 
order the fleet to Belgium <i>and</i> cover London, as would be the case if he had ordered 
<tt>Lvp-Yor</tt>.
<P align=justify>

Hindsight is 20-20, but if the Sealion becomes the Opening <i>du jour</i>, I think that more 
Brits will order <tt>Lvp-Yor</tt> in the Spring, and <tt>Yor-Lon</tt>, <tt>Nth-Bel</tt> in the Fall.
<P align=justify>
<A Name = "PostF01"></A>
The Fall move was perfect; Germany and I dislodged the North Sea fleet, and my order of <tt>Spa-Mar</tt> bounced 
Italy's <tt>Pie-Mar</tt>.  Germany built two fleets, I built two fleets, the English built a fleet in London, and 
Italy built a fleet in Rome.  <b>That</b> was unusual, because the Russian had gotten into Vienna in 
Fall of 1901, and I had thought that after bouncing in Marseilles, Italy would give up the 
anti-French campaign and go help Austria (in fact, I wrote Italy and mentioned that).  
<P align=justify>
<A HREF="seamove.html#Fall 1901"><B>Fall 1901 moves</B></A><br>
<P align=justify>

Russia had three builds and built an army in St. Petersburg.  This was the second "what-if."  Despite 
the very good Russian start, it was obvious that Germany and I were allied -- I had 
supported the German move to the North Sea, after all.  It seems to me that a fleet 
build in St. Petersburg (on either coast) would have been a better decision.  The fleet 
can be brought into play against a strong F/G alliance faster than an army could.  
<P align=justify>

The Sealion calls for a double convoy of <tt>Bel-Wal</tt> and <tt>Hol-Yor</tt> in Spring of 1902.  Germany 
and I agreed to keep on with the plan.  I had my army in Spain and my fleet in Marseilles to hold the 
Italians at bay, with my Brest fleet free to go to either front as required.  Germany was slightly 
worried about <tt>War-Sil</tt>, and so was I, truth be told.
<P align=justify>

<A Name = "PostS02"></A>

England pulled out probably his best possible move in Spring of 1902, and used two 
fleets to dislodge Germany from the North Sea.  In doing so, though, he left Edinburgh open, and that's where the 
German fleet retreated.  Italy ordered <tt>Pie-Mar</tt> for the second straight turn, along with 
<tt>Tun-Wes</tt> and <tt>Rom-TyS</tt>.  My thought at the time was that he decided against helping
Austria.   My convoy to Wales succeeded.  The feared Russian move to Silesia did not 
materialize.
<P align=justify>

<A HREF="seamove.html#Spring 1902"><B>Spring l902 moves</B></A><br>
<P align=justify>

In Edi's article, he says that no matter what happens in Spring 1902, one convoy will 
go through, and England will be destroyed.  From <i>my</i> perspective, I was much less 
enthusiastic about the situation.  True, one convoy (mine) <b>had</b> succeeded.  On the other 
hand, Belgium was open, and the only unit to cover it was my English Channel fleet, itself needed for the 
attack on London.  Also, England had very viable defense options.  He could order <tt>Nth S F Lon</tt>, <tt>Yor-Lvp</tt>, which would successfully defend both his centers no matter what I did.  
He could order <tt>Nth-Bel</tt>.  I was afraid that England would concede Edinburgh to Germany, and 
concentrate on sandwiching me with Italian help.
<P align=justify>

In fact, England did have plans along these lines.  He wrote me and said that he was in a 
good position for defense, and that he had every intention of sticking it to either me 
or Germany.  It was implied that I would be better off changing my course of action;
nothing specific, merely hints.
<P align=justify>

This was another "what-if," this time for me.  England's letter displayed a certain 
<i>je ne sais quoi</I>, if I may use that overworked phrase.  Reading between the lines,
I felt that if I abandoned the Sealion I would be able to trust England and we could make
an E/F alliance work.  Let me state that I had total trust in Germany.  If I got out of the 
Sealion, it would be because of Italy, not a lack of faith in Germany.  Italy refused to 
answer letters and had sent three units against me.  Should I cut my losses and abandon the 
Sealion?  Germany had three fleets and only his army in Holland was anywhere near France.  If 
I left the Sealion, there would be no immediate retribution, and I could concentrate on Italy.
<P align=justify>

If there is one thing that I've learned about Diplomacy, it is that there has to be overwhelming
concerns before you change course 180 degrees.  Abandoning Sealion meant no gains and at
least a year redeploying <tt>F Eng</tt> and <tt>A Wal</tt> to the Mediterranean.  I wrote to England and explained
that I had a certain investment going, and I needed to go a bit further before I left it.
However, I left the door open, and explained that if circumstances changed, I was willing
to explore an alternate course of action.  I also thanked him for keeping the lines of
communication open.  I was totally honest about this -- if my invasion of England stalled,
I would want a truce in a hurry, and it would come faster if we had been talking all along.
<P align=justify>

Sending in orders for Fall 1902 was the period of greatest doubt and apprehension for me.
I had decided to issue unsupported attacks on London and Liverpool.  I left Belgium
<b>wide</b> open to the English in the North Sea -- I almost never leave centers open to enemies.
A letter was sent to Berlin making sure that the North Sea fleet would <i>not</i> be dislodged by
German fleets.  The last thing I did before the deadline was to play the Russian card.
<P align=justify>

Prior to the Spring, the Russian had sent out anti-German feelers, but at that time I told 
Russia that I had England and Italy to deal with.  Then, in the Spring, Germany had ordered 
<tt>Ber-Bal</tt>, and the Tsar appeared <i>more</I> worried.    Again, the Tsar wrote to me, asking 
about Germany.  With crunch time against England coming, I had to do something.  I told the Tsar 
my hands were still tied with England and Italy.  I <b>did</b> ask that Russia use his armies in St. Petersburg 
and Sweden to take Norway, using the old "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" rationale.  
Russia agreed to help out in Norway to speed the English demise and free up my forces.

<p align=center><b>Edi's Comments</b>
<p align=justify>
All openings done by Edi have as their basis the domination of the player
through diplomacy tied with a tactical offensive flare.  The fact that Bif was
able to pull off the Sea Lion as France while having to fend off Italy and while
Germany was making the provocative and unnecessary play to the Baltic at
the same time does go far to validate the opening as another viable
alternative.
<P align=justify>
What this means is that the English players who have overwhelmingly gotten
lazy in their consistent play of Army Liverpool to EDInburg have another
option to consider.
<P align=justify>
Further, note that even with the Franco-German cooperation in Fall 1901,
diplomatically the French and the Germans can still maintain fairly viable
diplomatic approaches to the parties that could otherwise disrupt the
operation.  With the Russians, the French can apply the concept of "Germany is
between us, let us make this go away."  And for the German there is the
approach of "our backs are clear, let us move south together."
<P align=justify>
The idea that everyone on a board who sees the Sealion should stop what
they are doing and jump on F/G is false advice.  The issue, as in all
Diplomacy games, is what are the players up to.  What can be gained by the
fall of England and what is the nature of the structure of relations
between F/G. 
<P align=justify>
The real problem for the Sealion on a diplomatic front is that the F/G do
not neutralize the Russians or get them to turn vulture on the North.
Russian intervention to support England is the most dangerous to the goal
of the plan to take the English out.
<P align=justify>
Again it comes down to diplomacy ...which is the name of the game.

Fall 1902 saw the Germans ejected from Edinburgh, while I took Portugal and Liverpool, and
Russia grabbed Norway.  Italy bounced in Marseilles for the third straight turn (kids, don't 
try this at home), and also dislodged my Gulf of Lyon fleet -- I retreated it to Tuscany. I held onto Belgium. The 
Supply Center count was eight for Russia, seven for me in France, five for both Germany and Austria, four each for Turkey and Italy,  and two for
England.

<i>Now</i> I was prepared to say that England was mortally wounded, although there were still 
places where we were in danger.  Russia had a build and St. Petersburg was open.  I could lose 
Marseilles to the Italians, although Italy would lose Rome in the process. With Marseilles at 
risk, I built an army there, so I could retreat it if necessary.
<P align=justify>

Russia again built an army in St. Petersburg; don't ask me why.  True, I did write and
tell Russia that I would be very upset if he built a fleet, but my nearest fleet was still in the Channel
and there was nothing I could do to Russia if he <b>had</b> built a fleet.  
<P align=justify>

Prior to 1903, Italy finally wrote and started negotiating for a deal.  I was rather abrupt
and told him that since he was the aggressor, he would have to pull back before I would deal.
Amazingly, he did just that.  Not only that, but he pulled back in such a way that I 
would be guaranteed either Rome or Naples.  Remember what I said about changing course
for no gain?  Italy not only had to stop his French offensive, but would have to remove
a unit at the end of 1903.  That was a <i>very</i> big break for me.
<P align=justify>

With no outside assistance, England could do nothing to stop Germany and me
from taking London and Edinburgh in 1903.  At the end of 1903, the Supply Center chart
read: Russia and France 9, Germany 6, Turkey 5, Italy 3, Austria 2, England 0.

<b>Conclusions</b>
<P align=justify>
Does the elimination of England in 1903 in an actual game validate the Sealion?  I would have 
to agree that it was a spectacular success.  However, the other players had numerous opportunities
to band together and stop us.  The Sealion requires F/G to declare their alliance in Fall 
1901 and the other five players should start in Winter of 1901 to try and stop F/G.  Russia should have 
built a fleet in St. Petersburg, and should have ordered <tt>War-Sil</tt> in Spring of 1902.  Italy sent a lot of units west, 
but shouldn't have kept bouncing in Marseilles for three turns.  Italy and Russia had armies
in Tyrolia and Bohemia at the end of Spring of 1902, but they were used that Fall to attack Austria.
Those armies should have been used in a supported attack to take Munich.  In writing to
me in 1903, the German said that he thought the biggest threat to Sealion was Russia allying 
with England, and I have to agree with that.
<P align=justify>

Edi's article was succinct, but he explored the issue <b>only</b> from an offensive standpoint.
In the end, I'd have to say the Sealion will work, but not if you are not faced with 
savvy players.  If I saw two players trying to pull off a Sealion, I would drop everything
and try to organize the other five players to stop it.
