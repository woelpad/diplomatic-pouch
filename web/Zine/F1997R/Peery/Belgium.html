Hi Manus!

Here's a start.

Did you get a homongus file from Berry Renken with my Netherlands 
article?  That should go in the next TPD as part of XENO.

Attached to this is the intro to my next series on Belgium.  It won't 
make a lot of sense to you right now, but it will soon.  There's just all 
kinds of good things happening.

I'm also attaching the Afterword to the Netherlands articles that 
appeared in BLUES MOBILE.  This should also go somewhere.  It doesn't 
look like it but it pertains to WDC VII.

These should both be ascii files now.

And speaking of which I see the Mrs. won't be going.  Sorry to hear that.
I trust she's better real soon.

And speaking of That.  I was supposed to have my cutting session with the 
doctor on Thursday.  He got half done and quit, so now I must go back on 
the 26th or something.  Groan...

Regards,

Larry

ON THE ROAD WITH PEERY:
BELGIUM

By Larry Peery

INTRODUCTION

	Belgium.  
	It just sits there between the North Sea, The Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and France.
	It's enough to make a Dipper's heart go pitter-patter.
	And so it has.
	Mine.
	Nothing I have ever contemplated writing for the Diplomacy press, or about this game or hobby, has filled me with as much anticipation as this project.  
	Why?  After all, it's only one dot, but that is like saying the Hope is just another diamond.
	OK, that's cliche number one.  Somebody keep count, will you?

	When I first thought of writing a series of articles about my various Diplomacy travels; I faced all the usual journalist/travel writer questions: Who, What, Where, When, Why, How, How Much, etc. that every travel writer thinks about.  Well, that didn't last long.  Instead, I just decided to tell as good a story as I could; somewhat between what Charles Kuralt (On the Road With ...) and Rick Steves  (Europe Through the Back Door...) would do.  Diplomacy was a theme, but not the focal point of the article.  The focus was on the places I visited and the people I interacted with. The reception The Netherlands article got suggests it was the right way to go.

	I had decided way back when that my next port of call would be Belgium.  It seemed a natural follow-up to The Netherlands and I was just itching to do something to one-up Manus Hand's article on Picardy in THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH.  Why?  I have no idea, but it seemed like a good one at the time.

	For the last several months I have putting my ideas down on paper: collecting bits and pieces out of my memory bank pertaining to my weeklong visit to Belgium back in 1989, but NOT referring to my travel diary or my original notes; reading or rereading some of the limited literature available here on Belgium; visiting the various Web sites devoted to Belgium and related subjects; and trying to keep up with the flow of news from AP and Reuters dealing with Belgium.  I've even watched some of the old movies that had a Belgian subject or theme; and listened to recordings by Belgian composers and performed by Belgian artists.  About the only thing I haven't done, yet, is dive into a bowl of Chicken Waterzooi or some mussels and frites!

	 During my research I learned a great deal about Belgium, but what I I really discovered was how little I knew about the country and its people; and how much more there was to learn.  

	That made me hungry to know more and inevitably I found myself seeking out more information and personal contacts with Belgians, both Dippers and non-Dippers, who could answer my questions.  These contacts, and the interactions they generated, led to new ideas and even more contacts.  Even as I sought to put down on paper what I wanted to write about Belgium, I found my ideas were changing constantly.

	A month ago it seemed that this essay on Belgium would be much like the one on The Netherlands; essentially a travelogue with some history and Diplomacy tidbits tossed into the pot.

	But things have been happening in the past month.  Indeed, just in the past week or so things have been happening at a pace faster than I can keep up with.  In the last few weeks  I have had more than 100 email messages from people in Belgium that will, in one way or another, shape how this series of articles developes.  My travelogue has become a trip in itself.  Instead of writing about past history, we will be observing it being made, or perhaps making it ourselves.

	I cannot at this time tell you what lies ahead.  
	I cannot at this time tell you where we will go.
	I cannot at this time tell you who will be with us as we make this trip.
	I cannot at this time tell you when we will be arriving at our desination.
	However, I can at this time tell you why I want to do this.  This land, this Belgium, begs to tell a story, a story not often heard on this side of the Atlantic.  It is a story that lends itself to my story.  In theory and in practice it is a story of diplomacy and Diplomacy, but it is much more then just that. 
 
	This story began as a travelogue, and a travelogue it will be.  But more, much more than that, it will be a story unlike any I have ever  experienced or told before.  In addition to the travelogue and Diplomacy, I'll be offering what will be in effect a do-it-yourself course in Belgian history and culture.  Many of the most interesting parts of this series won't even be written by me but instead will be based on contributions from a wide variety of Belgians. 

	What does this mean?  Quite simply, it means that what was originally one person's story of a week-long trip to Belgium eight years ago has become something more; an event that had its beginning in one sense nearly one hundred years ago, and in a different sense over a quarter century ago; and in yet  another sense only a few days ago; an event that has grown to encompass scores of contributors from all walks of life, both in and out of Diplomacy.  In fact some of the most important people in this story have probably never heard of Diplomacy, but are very real diplomats in another world.

	I call it The Belgian Phenomena, for want of a better name.  I'm sure it has another, more proper name, but for our purposes TBP will do quite nicely.  Each original idea has led to an action; and that action has led to somekind of interaction; which in turn has led to yet a new idea; and so on.  What has a resulted is not simply a chain of events linked by a common narrative, but a whole crystalized structure that continues to grow even as I write this.  Where will it end?  Some place in...

	Belgium.

	In the months, even years, to come you will have a choice of several venues to follow this story.  If you want, you can read it in highlighted and serialized in BLUES MOBILE.  Or if you like you can follow it in more depth on the Web in THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH.  And for you old-timers, at least portions of it will be published in hard copy form in DIPSOMANIA.  When it's done; I may even publish the whole thing as a single work.  Why so many venues?  Because each of these publications draws a different audience, and I believe that each audience will have a difference response to what they read.  


	BELGIUM will be divided into many parts and I am sure that not every part will be of interest to all of you, so feel free to pick and choose what you read from among the various options my publishers and editors give you.  However, I do promise you that if you stay the course you will finish it knowing more about Belgium than most Belgians.  And, of course, I hope for your feedback and interaction.  Like you see on many web site page screens, this is indeed a "WORK IN PROGRESS."  In fact, it will always be a work in progress.

	Like Belgium.

Next time...

	Plotting our path.

AFTERWORD: COMING FULL DOT

	I hope you have enjoyed our trip together to The Netherlands.
	Early on in our visit to The Netherlands we dropped in on perennial student Jaap Jacobs at the University of Leiden, one of the oldest universities in Northern Europe; so it seems only appropriate that we end our journey by dropping in on perennial professor Arend Lijphart at the University of California, San Diego, one of the newest major universities in the world.
	When I was a student myself some thirty years ago I was exposed to the work of many famous political scientists: Almond, Daalder, Dahl, Deutsch, Easton, Laski, Lipset, Polsby, and Truman among them.  Most of these people were, for my taste, too much into the "science" of politics and not enough into the "art" of politics.  Dean Truman, among others, gave me the courage to strike out on my own path, and for that I am forever grateful.
	Arend Lijphart wrote two major works during that period that I read as a student.  I'm sure I did.  One or another of my professors would have required it.  One dealt with the politics of The Netherlands.  The other dealt with the politics of Belgium.  Neither made much of an impression on me at the time.  More time changes things.  I have just finished rereading THE POLITICS OF ACCOMMODATION: PLURALISM AND DEMOCRACY IN THE THE NETHERLANDS.  Originally written in 1968 and revised in 1975, much of this book is out of date in terms of modern political science, even in a country as slow-moving as The Netherlands.  
	However, there is one chapter, the seventh, "The Rules of the Game," which I think is very timely for us Dippers, and especially when it is used to shed some light on what has happened, and not happened, to the World Diplomacy Convention / Organization over the past ten years.  This is one of those cases where something written about one subject can be applied directly to another.  At least I think so.  
	If you are not a political scientist or a student of Dutch politics, reading this chapter of this book probably won't do you much good  IF you try to use it to understand either the subject as political science or as an explanation of Dutch politics.  However, if you read it as a student of the diplomacy of Diplomacy; you may find some insight into our own little world.  At least I have.
	The game that Lijphart describes in terms of Dutch politics is the exact same game that we Dippers have been playing for the last ten years.  The only difference is that the Dutch were much better at it then we were.  The game, one of the politics of accommodation, was governed by a set of seven "rules" which all the players followed.
These Rules kept the Dutch political system moving, even when it didn't want to.  I will simply list the Rules and hope that that will be enough to persuade you to track down a copy of this book and read it for yourself.  Otherwise, we'll be here for another six months if I try to draw you a picture.  
	Rule 1: Politics should not be regarded as a game at all.  Politics is a business. The bottom line is everything.
	Rule 2: It is pragmatically accepted that ideological differences are basic realities which cannot and should not be changed.
	Rule 3: The more serious the political question that is at stake, the higher will be the elite level at which it will be resolved.
	Rule 4: The rule of proportionality is a simple procedural device capable of solving a host of troublesome problems.  
	Rule 5: Sensitive political issues are neutralized through a system of depoliticization.
	Rule 6: The process of accommodation must be shielded from publicity.
	Rule 7: The rulers must not be harassed.  
	I know this all sounds esoteric and most of you are probably wondering what it has to do with Diplomacy.  Trust me, quite a lot.  But before we can discuss it any further you need to do your homework.  Read this book.  You should be able to find it in a good library.
	But don't worry too much, if you missed it this time around you'll run into it again on our next journey.  Professor Lijphart also wrote a book on Belgium politics, and we'll be talking about that eventually.  
	The bottom line here, and it is exactly the same bottom line I intend to present in Goteborg, is that we need to find a way to create a working political system to govern the WDC on behalf of our various national hobbies.  I believe Lijphart has, in these books (and the other 12 he has written since during his distinguished career),  given us a viable role model to work with.  God knows we need one.  We have tried the British method, the Ami method, and the French method with little results.  Perhaps it is time we tried the Dutch method.  What a treat it would be if it worked!
	In addition to his other areas of expertise Professor Lijphart is unqestionably, perhaps unknowingly,  a master of the diplomacy of Diplomacy.
	Jaap took great pride in showing me the famous lecture hall at the University of Leiden that dates from the 1500s.  If he came to San Diego I would take equal pride in showing him the famous Library of the University of California at San Diego, the one that looks like it is about to take off into space at any moment.  And no doubt Dr. Lijphart would enjoy the relative merits of both of them.
	From San Diego to Leiden, and now back to San Diego; we've come full dot.
	Next time, Belgium.
