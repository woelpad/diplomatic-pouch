Hello Again (and Hi Simon)!

Would you believe Togo is only 20% through on the printer?  That's how far 
behind the printing was.  I must have a couple of hundred pages of stuff to 
print.  

Anyway, here is my stuff for the next TDP.  I want to get it done now so I 
can focus on getting ready for Goteborg (and all the medical crap coming up 
in the next few weeks).  

What I am doing is a bit different.  I hope it is easier for you and me.I 
also have Simon for a witness (:-) that I sent it.

There's a lot of stuff but I am covering the period since Columbus, and I've 
been busy!  Basically, what follows is a series of more or less independent 
paragraphs.  Each one will have a .WRI file or something to go with it.  I 
will send the .WRI files attached to this message or separately.  Most of 
them are intended for other pubs.  It has become obvious to me that TDP 
reaches a bigger and more varied audience then any other Dip pub, so I might 
as well dump it all here for the world to see. Snicker.

Oh yes, if you see a ##### somewhere in the text that means you can insert a 
link to the other site, or whatever you do to make these things fancy.

Anyway, enough of that, on with the show.

NB: And now Togo is done and I'm printing an equally long message from 
Stephen Agar about his Archives.

*************************************************************************

Greetings and Welcome to the latest XENOGOGIC!

	This issue covers the period since last summer's WDC VI in Columbus, 
Ohio.  As you will see, I have been busy.  Depending on how clever (or bored) 
Manus and Simon get you will either have to read through all this nonsense or 
you will be able to skip from topic to topic as your fancy dictates.  I do 
hope you'll take at least a moment to look at each topic.  Some of them may 
be obscure, but they are important.  At least I think so.

WORLD DIPCON VI FOLLOW-UP

	WDC VI is history.  You can read all about it in THE PROCEEDINGS. If 
you would like to order a copy of that let me know.  
	A few of us spent some time during the XTRA-DAZ part of the Con 
talking about the role of women in diplomacy & Diplomacy.  Little did we know 
how relevant our discussions would be.  We talked about Mrs. Bhutto, the 
former premier of Pakistan.  She wanted to play diplomacy, a man's game in 
Pakistan, so they treated her like one; and kicked her butt out!  We 
discussed Pamela Harriman, the late US Ambassador to France.  She went out in 
the kind of grand style that only a woman of her class could or would.  On 
the one hand she confessed in her "friendly" biography that her greatest fear 
was having to live "on only $500,000 a year."  On the other hand, she had no 
qualms about leaving her interest in an $80 million Van Gogh to the National 
Gallery.  One of the great women of this century!  And Madeleine!!  What a 
long way she has come since last July.  She's left her bully pulpit at the UN 
(and isn't the Russian ambassador happy?) and taken her show on the road as 
the new US Secretary of State, the highest office any woman has ever held in 
the US.  She's had more front page photographs in the major US newspapers 
since the last election then Clinton.  It must be the nose.  
	Enough of the women.  Just this week we learned, finally, of the 
death of Chinese Premier Deng Xiaoping, the last great relic of the Mao 
Dynasty. How important was Deng's passing?  Well, the LOS ANGELES TIMES spent 
more pages on his obits then they did on the verdict in the second OJ trial. 
My favorite Deng quote, of course, was "It doesn't matter if a cat is black 
or white, as long as it catches mice."  Not a bad way to sum up the career of 
one of the key players on this century's stage.  The French, who have been 
very unhappy at the constant reminders that Chirac once worked at a HoJo's, 
rushed to point out that Deng had once worked at a Renault car plant.  No 
less an expert that Dr. Bruno-Andre Giraudon observed, "While there Deng 
churned out a communist journal, Red Light, earning the nickname, "doctor of 
mimeography."

WORLD DIPCON VII PREVIEW

	If you are still thinking about going to Goteborg over Easter NOW is 
the time to act!  Airfares are half of what they would normally be, and 
American Airlines is offering some good vacation package deals if you want to 
make a holiday of it.  Thank you, Mr. Crandall, you arrogant SOB!
	Plans and preparations for the upcoming WDC event are well under way. 
GOTHCON#####, the host event, and the WDC event organizers#####, both have 
their own Web pages up with all the info you need.  If you want more 
information about the event, Goteborg, or taking a holiday in Scandinavia you 
can check out my PEERY'S GUIDE TO WORLD DIPCON VII.  Ask me how to get a 
copy.  It's free to any Ami Dipper going to WDC. I plan to spend a total of 
two weeks in Scandinavia (unless my money runs out sooner) visiting 
Copenhagen and Stockholm after the Con.  You're welcome to tag along.
	So, the big question is, "Who is going to win?"  I know.  In fact I 
have sent Manus a picture of the person I expect to win the individual title. 
It should be in here somewhere.#####  Will it be an Ami, you ask?  It is very 
possible.  For the first time ever the US is sending a strong team to an 
overseas WDC event.  Brad Pitt, ah, I mean Pitt Cranlemire (See what happens 
when you've been on the PC for seven hours and are typing along at 120 wpm!),
last year's winner, could repeat, although it doesn't seem likely. Edi Birsan 
wants a WDC title.  Don't let him make you think otherwise.  Why not?  He's 
won everything else.  Dan Mathias is big and loud, and a good player.  Tom 
Corbin is small and quiet, but also a very good player. Must be the Armenian 
blood in him!  As for me, I have a secret recipe that is going to do wonders 
for my performance this year.  It uses equal parts of Absolut and prune 
juice, plus a secret ingredient!  The real fun will come if some of the 
better players from countries that have not previously participated in WDC 
appear.  That will make for an interesting mix!

EMOTIONS SURVEY RESPONSE

	Last issue Manus posted my Emotions Survey form, probably wondering 
what craziness I was up to now.  Well, a lot of you seem to have been 
interested.  At least you responded.  A whole lot of you.  The comments have 
ranged from, "This is great.  I learned a whole lot about myself...to...Why?" 
I appreciate your responses and the results should be fascinating.  If you 
haven't responded yet, please do.  I'm sure the survey is still in here, 
somewhere.  As far as I can recall, the whole subject of "emotions" in 
Diplomacy is one that has never really been explored.  Amazing, isn't it?  
It's such an important aspect of the game.
	"Lovestruck."  That's the one that seems to have caused the most 
bewilderment among the respondents.  Don't worry. I'll explain all.



                    ***********************************

FACTOID: I have received over 600 email messages since 1 December, 1996.  
Twenty percent of them were bad (junk mail, returned mail, etc.) and eighty 
percent of the remainder came from overseas.  The largest number of messages 
came from Roland Isaksson.  The largest volume came from Berry Renken. The 
highest quality came from Borger Borgersen.

                    ***********************************

 
ON THE ROAD WITH PEERY: THE NETHERLANDS

	My long-running serial in Berry Renken's BLUES MOBILE##### has ended. 
 Now you can read the entire article in  THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH.  One of the 
big pluses to a zine like TDP is the fact that it can provide this kind of 
back-up publication service to smaller hobby publications.  A few dozen 
people saw this essay in BLUES MOBILE, and Berry gets a lot of credit for 
publishing it (and other articles like it), but now thousands of Dippers (and 
Dutchmen) can see it in TDP.  
	The article is about The Netherlands as I experienced in during my 
1989 Grand Dip Tour and about the Dutch Diplomacy hobby.  The reception was 
quite good, even among the natives.  But time moves on and the series is 
moving with it.  On to Belgium...

WWPDC UPDATE

	This unique event (Now, tell me, why would I do anything that wasn't 
unique?)is now into 1905.  The first four game years are over and the results 
continue to get more and more fascinating.  Think of it like this.  Imagine 
putting seven teams of Dippers from seven different countries (Well, six 
countries and one mishmash.) into a seven game event being held in a postal 
venue (with Roman amphitheater overtones)where half the players have email 
capabilities.  Put an idiot in as GM.  Throw in the incompetence of the 
Italian post office to handle results distribution.  Voila!  You have the 
WWPDC!  The next results are due out about the time of WDC VII.  Rumor has it 
that one team is offering the GM a huge bribe to reveal the results at the 
event.  Heh, heh...

GOODIES FROM THE DIPLOMACY ARCHIVES

	One of the smaller hobby crowns I wear is that of King Stephen (no, 
not the late King of Hungary, but Agar!).  I am the custodian of The 
Diplomacy Archives, the largest and most disorganized of all the hobby's 
Archives.  This is a huge collection dating back to the beginning of the 
hobby.  How big?  Bigger then the other three hobby Archives put 
together...and doubled in size.  Alas, most Dippers rarely get to see it.  
After all, I only the doors to The Archives once ever generation (The next 
time will be this coming July, if you are interested.).  However, Rod Walker, 
one of the grand old farts of the hobby, recently donated another few 
thousand copies of old Dip zines to The Archives.  In one of the boxes I 
found a set of 15 treasures that Rod had apparently intended to publish in 
DIPLOMACY WORLD during his tenure as DW Editor (e.g. 1980-1985).  I 
immediately sensed the value of these goodies.  Why even the pigeons refused 
to do their natural thing when I laid them out in the patio to scrape the 
mold off of them.  So, I have sent them off to Doug Kent to form the basis of 
a series of articles that will appear in DIPLOMACY WORLD##### during the next 
few years under the general title, "FROM THE ARCHIVES: TREASURES FROM THE 
GOLDEN AGE OF DIPLOMACY." Included will be articles by authors like Allan 
Calhamer, Edi Birsan, Don Miller, Jared Johnson, Ted Holcombe, and Dick 
Shultz; every one a major writer in the hobby's early days.  And, amazingly 
enough, not a bit of Peeriblah in the lot!  Well, except for the 
introductions. You'll learn a lot about the hobby as it was in the beginning 
from these articles, and you'll learn even more about how far we've come in 
the last third of a century.  Scarey thought, huh?  Remember, you can read 
them, but only in DIPLOMACY WORLD.

DOES THE HOBBY REALLY NEED ANOTHER ORGANIZATION?

	Yes, I think so.  And this time I only have to persuade three other 
people to agree with me.  And, as I write this, one of them has.  And not 
only that he has volunteered to run it!  Glory be!!
	I mentioned above the fact that I was custodian of The Diplomacy 
Archives.  That wasn't a job I wanted.  It was dumped on me back in 1985 when 
my predecessor's father was threatening to dump TDA into the family 
fireplace.  I can understand that now.  After seventeen years TDA now fill my 
garage, my home office, my living room, my dining room, and, on good days, my 
patio.  It is a huge collection.  It deserves better care.  It deserves to be 
used.  This is a thought that has occurred to me at least once a year (or 
whenever it threatens to rain) for the last sixteen years.  My dream was that 
I would give up all my other hobby chores and devote myself to taking care of 
TDA.  Alas, reality caught up with me first.  Now I find myself in the same 
boat (sort of) as Jamie McQuinn, the custodian of the Buchanan Archives.  
Jamie is a real librarian and archivist.  Well, I'm not a librarian, exactly, 
but I am a "paper shuffler and archivist" of some of my company's treasures. 
In fact, it is getting to the point where I have to check twice to see if the 
incoming faxes are company or hobby related.  The dateline may be Moscow, 
Warsaw, or Sevastapol --- but I don't know if it is about black dots or 
nuclear power plants.  
	Anyway, something needs to be done.  The worldwide hobby now has four 
major quasi-hobbywide/public collections: mine, McQuinn's, Agar's (in the 
UK), and the new kid on the block, The Committee of Six's (in Belgium) which 
I will henceforth refer to as the Bryant collection since I expect Jef is 
going to be the primary "mover and doer" in that group.  
	I have sent a proposal to these three folks (McQuinn, Agar and 
Bryant) suggesting we form an informal organization of "archivists" to begin 
the process of getting our collections in order and, equally important, 
getting them in shape so they can be used for the benefit of the hobby.  
After all, that is what they are supposed to be for, right?  	
	A copy of my proposal is attached.##### If you have or are thinking 
about establishing an Archives, or merely have a collection of old zines 
you'd like to get rid of, please let one of us know.  

THE LIESNARD COLLECTION / THE BELGIAN DIPLOMACY ARCHIVES

	Michel Liesnard and I go back a long way.  Twenty-five years to be 
exact.  When he left the hobby he kept a large (forty boxes worth) collection
of Dip zines from the hobby's Golden Age.  They sat in his basement for a 
long time.  By now, or very shortly, they will be out of the basement and 
into the fresh air of the Belgian Diplomacy hobby.  The implications of this 
for the future of continental European Diplomacy are significant.  How it all 
came to happen is a story you can read about in the attachment.#####

BELGIUM ON MY MIND

	Well, it's not Tuesday yet, but Belgium is a subject that has been 
very much on my mind recently. I intended to follow up my Netherlands 
travelogue with one on Belgium since that was the next place I visited during 
my 1989 tour.  Researching that led to the recent EDC V, held in Namur, 
Belgium the last weekend of February.  It also led to contacts with a variety 
of Belgian Dippers and, of course, the episode with the Liesnard collection. 
I am still working and will probably be working on my Belgian Diplomacy etc. 
series for sometime.  In fact, I expect it to run into 1999!  But you will be 
able to access the whole story in all of its various aspects in one of three 
places: in THE BLUES MOBILE##### on the Net, in Jef Bryant's DIPSOMANIA in 
hard copy, and in THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH.  I suspect the first two will only 
carry highlights and summaries, but I hope TDP will carry the entire series. 
For more information, check out #####.
	As I wrote elsewhere, this, for me, is the most exciting thing I will 
be working on for the next several years.  

PEERICON XVII INVITATION

	If you are in the area, or have a few free hours on the Net/Web, you 
are invited to stop by on 25- 27 July, 1997 for PEERICON XVII.  This year 
there will be no Diplomacy played.  Instead, we'll be rummaging around in The 
Archives reliving the Good Old Days!  

THAT'S ALL FOLKS!

	I hope to see many of you in Goteborg.  If not, next time in TDP.
