<P align=justify>Superman.  Spider-Man.  Batman.  What do these three
crusaders for good have in common?  (Other than a non-Newtonian, let
alone Einsteinian universe?)  Why, secret identities, of course!  And why
do these heroes hide their identities?  To protect their loved ones
primarily, but also, to only a slightly lesser degree, to protect themselves.
("Fellow Arkham escapees, it looks as if Bruce Wayne is the
keynote speaker at a charity function tonight.  If we blow the building
up, <b>no more Batman!</b>")

<P align=justify>And what, dear reader does this have to do Diplomacy?

The simple fact that many of us play games under the guise of an
alter-ego.  Not just the Kaiser So-and-so type of alter-ego's, but using
the Gunboat variant, full and complete anonymity.  (For purposes of
clarity I must mention that when I talk about Gunboat in these
paragraphs I use the electronic definition of the term, as opposed to the postal
definition -- which as I recall is equivalent to the e-mail game's "no-press.")
Personally, I
usually play Gunboat games because that's what the opening was for when
I was looking for a game.  But I know that there are players that prefer
to play in Gunboat games for some reason or another.  One assumes that a
large subset of these players do so because of reputation (good or bad)
and the probability that extra attention will be focused on them, even
before the game begins.

<P align=justify>So, since no one (other than the game's moderator)
knows the true identities of the players, these concealed players
have nothing to fear.  They can play out the game without their
reputation preceding them, right?  <B>Wrong!</B>  There are players out
there, and I'm probably one of them, whose identities can be easily
determined by their opponents if those opponents know what to what look for.

<B><FONT SIZE=4><P>It's All a Matter of Style</P></B></FONT>

<P align=justify>Disregarding mistakes (signing press with the wrong
name, forgetting an "endpress" and letting a <tt>.sig</tt> file slip through),
players' secret identities run the risk of exposure for one reason:
writing style.  Authors are tempted to write under pseudonyms, but
more often than not these attempts at going <i>incognito</i> fall quickly
apart.  An example;  I had the opportunity to read <U>"The Running Man"</U>
before it was revealed that Richard Bachman was an alias for Stephen King.  The
pen name didn't matter.  My overwhelming impression as I read the book
was akin to, "This guy writes just like Stephen King."

<P align=justify>If King was a member of the Diplomacy community, and if
he wrote reasonably long press, I'd guess that there would be a strong
chance that people could ferret him out in Gunboat games.  And if he was
a particularly strong (or weak) player, that knowledge would color the
detectives' attitudes toward him and his game.  It's not just famous
novelists who can be recognized from their writing style:

<blockquote><tt><i>

&gt;All right!  I got my unit into [that space]!<br>
&gt;<br>
Excellent!
<P>
&gt;Fellow allies, we've pretty much got our foe trapped.<BR>
&gt;<BR>
Indeed!
<P>
&gt;and, since Ally #1 is such a good plan maker,<BR>
&gt;<BR>
I'm blushing.
<P>
&gt;I'm going to let HIM think about it.  (Etcetera)<BR>
&gt;<BR>
I'll look at a map and get back to you soon about the Fall.
</i></tt></blockquote>

<P align=justify>Any guesses as to the identity of Ally #1 (the
responder?)  Up until this exchange, there wasn't a truly distinctive
style to his writing.  Oh, his plans were well thought out and in-depth,
but stylistically there were no red flags; he had gone to great pains to
make himself as undetectable as he could.  But upon reading the above
toss-off response, I would have been certain (and I would have been correct)
that the responder was none other than our beloved publisher, Manus
Hand.  One single message, written off the cuff (as opposed to thought out and
planned) and I know the identity of a power.  And be sure, having been
stabbed by Manus and his oh-so-logical sounding arguments, I would
definitely treat Ally #1 with a critical eye.

<P align=justify>Now Manus isn't the only Diplomacy player out there
whose style I'm likely to recognize.  He just happens to be the one who I
consulted about this article and who was kind enough to send me a whole mail
folder full of press from one of his gunboat games for me to analyze.  And
in talking to Manus, he has
seen a large amount of Gunboat press whose author he recognizes as well.
(Including, I'm sure, mine.)
<p align=justify>So the question becomes, how do you avoid
being obvious in your press style?  By taking the time to examine your
press, and see what traits you consistently have.  In preparing to write
this article, and discussing it with Manus, I have come up with a list
of things that either Manus or I (or, in some cases, both of us!) tend
towards in our press:

<ol>
<li>Trailing thought pattern, usually set off with ellipses (...)
<li>Side comments, with lots of parentheses.
<li>A consistent style of noting orders when discussing plans ("<tt>a mun m
ber</tt>," for example.)
<li>A tendency for very long press, or for very short.
<li>Responding notation.  Many of us have the "greater than" symbol as
the default setting for noting the original text.  If your default is
different, it stands out.  How you use the notation is important also.
If you are <b>very</b> consistent in how you set up the spacing when you
reply, you are leaving clues.
<li>A standard beginning or conclusion to your messages.  If you start your
messages in each game with the same "Howdy!" you will be detected if you do
so in your Gunboat games.
<li>Writing style.  Do you always paragraph the same?  How is your
grammar and spelling?  What is your language usage like?
Capitalization?  This category probably stands out most when one is reading a
message in one's native language, from another person with the same first
language.
</ol>
And that's just a sampling.

<P align=justify>None of the above style-clues alone is enough to pinpoint
your identity in a gunboat game.  But when they start being combined,
they can become as distinct as fingerprints.  How can we as players
avoid broadcasting our identities when we're trying to remain anonymous?
Most simply, by waiting an extra minute or two before responding to
another power's press.  And by thinking out, and planning our press,
instead of typing it up as we're thinking about it.
