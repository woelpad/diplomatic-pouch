<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">James Mackintosh raises a good question on the RT (Russia and Turkey) Juggernaut and it's effectiveness in standard diplomacy against the experienced and educated Pouch audience.  Conservatively speaking, the average  player is able to recognize the signs of an RT Juggernaut by the end of Spring 1902.  The experienced and devoted (Pouch reader) sees the RT a year sooner yet, novice and expert players alike try to play the alliance.  Why?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Assuming two equally matched players agree to form an RT alliance, is one power better than the other?  Does Russia have more leverage over Turkey in such partnership and if so, why should Turkey agree to coordinate with a stronger power?  The opposite also applies.  Why should Russia agree to such alliance?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Consider an RT alliance the cause.  Is a western triple the effect?  How does Italy and Austria fit into the equation or should these powers surrender to the two super-alliances immediately?  Why not?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let the Pouch know what you think.  Email the Zine at <A HREF="mailto:dippouch@devel.diplom.org">dippouch@devel.diplom.org</A>.
