<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some readers may remember my article
<A  HREF="/Zine/F1999M/Cohen/warrior.html">
"<I>Diplomacy and the Way of the Warrior</I>,"</a> which appeared previously in the Zine.
In that article, I discussed the applicability
of Miyamoto Shinmen Musashi’s writings to the play of Diplomacy.  The
book I discuss now comes out of that same Japanese martial tradition.
Yagyu and Musashi were contemporaries, and the Book of Family Traditions
was written approximately eleven years earlier than the Book of Five
Rings.  I do not believe that either man read the work of the other,
especially since Yagyu advises specifically in his book that his teachings
should remain, "in the family."  One exception to this was that in addition
to being the head of the Shogun’s Secret Police, Yagyu was the martial
arts instructor to the Shogun and the Shogun’s family, so that while
his writings were not widely disseminated in his time, they were certainly
very influential.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I
will try to stay away from direct comparison of the two works.  Though
readers are welcome to compare the two, either through reading my other
article or by reading both texts in their entirety.  In fact, the two
works have been published together in one volume more than once.
I must say Yagyu’s writing is just as heavily influenced by Zen philosophy
as Musashi’s and just as Musashi did, Yagyu concludes that there is
no irreconcilable conflict between Zen Buddhism and the study of the
martial arts.  For this article, I will mostly de-emphasize the Zen
philosophical aspects of the work, and concentrate more on the application
of the precepts of the book to the play of Diplomacy.  I will also take
Yagyu’s teachings out of the order in which they are presented and
arrange them to increase their relevance to Diplomacy players.
The book is divided into three parts, "The Killing Sword," "The Life-Giving
Sword," and "No Sword".  Each symbolizing respectively the use of force, the
ability to anticipate problems and prevent them, and finally the ability
to influence events without the use of force by employing other resources.
In Diplomacy terms, mastering the teachings of the "Three Swords," is
equivalent to mastery of tactics, strategy and communication, which
are all vital to the play of the game at the highest levels.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One
thing that must always be kept in mind when reading the <I>Book of Family
Traditions</I> is that Yagyu consistently equates individual combat with
grand strategy and considers the mental side of the art of war more
important than the physical side.  "Just as one faces off with two swords,
executing most ably the well thought out plan of combat, using one’s
hands and feet skillfully so as to gain victory, in the same way the
martial art of the commander, properly speaking, is to successfully
employ all forces and skillfully create strategies so as to win in war."
The equivalence works in Diplomacy as well.  The units represent hundreds
of thousands of troops each, together with the associated materiel.
Yet the factor of overriding importance in Diplomacy, just as in combat
is the mind of the opponent.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Among
the mental aspects of the art of war stressed by Yagyu is the necessity
of always thinking about not only one’s own
plans but the plans of the enemy.  While combat itself is "a matter of course... One who is a commander
pitches two battle formations in his chest, mentally leading a great
army into battle."  Knowing the mind of the enemy is vital.  "To see
with certainty how an adversary’s sword is working, how he is handling
it and to discern what is on his mind… When you know your opponent’s
moves and manners well, you can make your own maneuvers freely."  Obviously,
in Diplomacy if you know your opponents and can use that knowledge
to help predict their strategy and tactics, you have a large advantage
over another person who lacks such knowledge.  See if they have written
anything on the subject (Though it won’t do you any good against me!)
including any End-of-Game Statements, observe games where they are presently
playing, and ask around with regard to their past games.  Always attempt
to determine the intent of the other players.  "Footwork and disposition
of the body should be such as not to miss the location of the quiescent
sword," with "location of the quiescent sword," meaning the intent of
the opponent.  The exposition of the vital importance of perception
of the abilities and intentions of opponents forms a large part of the
Life-Giving Sword book.  Just as it is important to use deception and
subterfuge it is equally important to cultivate the ability to see
through the deception and subterfuge of opponents.  "If you misperceive
the... abilities and perceptions, even if you use a hundred techniques
to the fullest, you will not attain victory."  To succeed in Diplomacy,
concentrate on being able to see your opponent’s situation from their
point of view.  The more you are able to predict the moves of your opponents
with accuracy the easier it will be to turn in the best possible set
of orders.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just
as you need to determine the intent of your opponent, it will help if
you are able to conceal your own intent.  In the context of Diplomacy,
your arsenal of deceptive tactics may include (but should not be limited
to) the spread of disinformation to third parties, seemingly odd or
useless orders (i.e., "To do something unexpected as a ploy to startle
an opponent is also an appearance concealing an ulterior intention,
an art of war."), intentional misorders, multiple feints, sustained
and detailed negotiations with players you intend to attack, and to
the extent the house rules of the playing forum and GM permit, attempted
deception as to your identity in both public press and private communication.
The emphasis on the dichotomy between thought and action continues throughout
the book.  Yagyu’s next point could be taken directly from a Diplomacy
handbook: "Appearance and intention are fundamental to the art of war.
Appearance and intention mean the strategic use of ploys, the use of
falsehood to gain what is real.  Appearance and intention inevitably
snare people when artfully used, even if people sense there is an ulterior
intention behind the overt appearance.  When you set up ploys and opponents
fall for them, then you win by letting them act on your ruse.  As for
those who do not fall for the ploy, when you see they will not fall
into one trap, you have another set up."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, too much of a good thing in Diplomacy, just as in combat, can be
bad.  Do not become overly fixated on concealing your intentions.  To
do so may cause you to misjudge the intent of another player, since
they will constantly be responding to your feints and ruses.  Indeed
you may lose a potential ally, if you make them too nervous, or unsure
of your true intentions.  Obsession about anything, whether it be deception
or any other particular tactic, offense, defense, revenge or anything
else is a weakness.  By freeing the mind from such obsessions and refraining
from becoming fixated you can act freely and you will not prevent
yourself from finding the best plan of action.  Perhaps the most common
obsession in Diplomacy concerns the stab.  Obsession with the employment
of the stab is the greatest failing of many players, with another popular
flaw being the obsession of obtaining revenge after a stab.  When a
player can keep these obsessions from influencing their play, effective
play becomes much easier, especially if a player acts in an unexpected
manner, given the "natural" response of most players after being attacked.
Of course, revenge often coincides with the best course of action but
that is not always the case.  The opposite tendency, obsessive maintenance
of alliances, is also a hindrance to superior play.  To Yagyu, part
of the art of war is, "knowing when there will be disruption, and preventing
disturbance before it happens," which leads to a discussion of group
dynamics quite familiar to any Diplomacy player who has witnessed an
agreement faithfully continued by one side and broken by the other:
"mindfulness to observe the dynamic of situations in a group is an art
of war.  If you do not see the dynamic of a situation, you may remain
too long in company where you should not be and get into trouble for
no reason."  You must constantly observe opponents, directly and through
information from third parties, and look for signs of change in intention.
If your opponent is not fixated on keeping agreements and you are, the
results are almost inevitably disastrous for you.  If you slavishly
adhere to agreements, even if you are lucky enough to have found someone
as maniacally faithful as yourself, you will likely pass up opportunities
for victory, unless you are willing to break agreements at the opportune
moment.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The
importance of the concept of not becoming fixated or obsessed (important
enough when fighting an opponent or opponents of equal or lesser strength)
becomes crucial when facing a more powerful opponent.  "The important
thing is what happens when you are hard pressed... make sure you do not
get caught in a pinch, unprepared... This is the concentrated attention
you exert at such times as when you are being attacked with your back
to the wall.  It should be understood as a most critical and difficult
situation."  Therefore, the "margin of safety is quite impossible to
maintain if you fix your eyes upon one spot, let your mind linger in
one place, and fail to keep up sustained watchfulness."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Much
of the discussion in the book concerns a related topic, the subordination
of mood to will.  By that, Yagyu means that outward statement, whether
physical or verbal, should be subordinate to the inner attitude.  He
writes, "It is essential to control your mood by means of your will,
calming down so that your will is not drawn by your mood."  A fighter
should always try to remain calm, not excited and always try to plan
strategies, tactics and observe the enemy with a normal state
of mind.  Applied to Diplomacy, the superior player playing either face
to face or by written communication, is not ruled by emotion but by
the ultimate objective, to win.  Emotion or at least the appearance
of emotion, is merely another tool to influence the adversary.  You
can have the appearance of being angry, happy, worried and so forth
but you should not let your emotional state influence your planning.
The point is extensively elaborated upon in several sections of the
<I>Killing Sword</I> book.  It is not a problem to have emotions.  Emotions
only become problems when they steer a player away from the best plan
of action.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yagyu
is generally in favor of letting an opponent take the initiative but
he does not mean this in the way it is ordinarily understood.  The opponent
is allowed the initiative only to the extent that they make the first
move.  After the opponent has made the first move and therefore committed
to a course of action, it is time to counterattack.  Once the plans
of the other player or players are known, the superior Diplomacy player
will then seize the initiative and successful strategies can more easily
be formulated.  In Diplomacy, this type of play is most often seen in
the opening phase of the game.  Some players may make various non aggression
pacts and alliances which require no immediate positive action, spending
the early game picking up neutral Supply Centers and setting up flexibly,
so that their next course of action is not obvious.  If a patient player
is not immediately attacked, and the other players commit to particular
courses of action, that player can jump in at an advantageous time in
one or more conflicts.  "A hasty attack is an exceptionally bad thing.
The thing is to press aggressively only after having properly prepared
yourself mentally, and after having observed the situation thoroughly."
Sometimes, of course, opponents may need to be encouraged to commit:
"When opponents are secured in a passive or waiting mode… implement
strategic maneuvers with covert intentions, inducing adversaries to
tip their hands, and thus using this to enable you to gain victory."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yagyu
feels that flexibility, the antithesis of obsession, is a key to success.
Once an attack is begun, it is important to remain attentive to the
target of the attack, since you will become the focus of your opponent’s
attention, and may encounter massive, even irrational opposition.  You
must be prepared either to press home the attack while the opening can
still be exploited, to shift the attack to another area, or to abandon
the attack completely.  To know when to change direction, in Diplomacy
just as in combat is, "a supremely effective state of mind."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just
as it is important to be able to refocus in attacks, to remain
tactically flexible, it is also important to maintain flexibility in
overall playing style.  Then, opponents cannot predict your moves because
they may categorize you as a daring or conservative player.  In addition,
reflexive adherence to the "usual" or "ordinary" is bad.  Masters of
the martial arts know when to depart from standard thought patterns
and practices so that, "People who have attained supreme mastery are
beyond them; they act freely and independently."  For example, attempting
to obtain good position with the Spring move, in order to capture Supply
Centers with the Fall move, is often a wise guideline to follow but
if an opponent leaves an opening and you calculate that gains from
the attack would be sustainable, a Spring attack on Supply Centers may
be the best move.  Similarly, a move for position in the Fall can be
worthwhile as well, if the positional advantage leads to later material
or strategic gains, as is demonstrated by the enduring popularity of
the Lepanto and Sealion openings.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Though
there are often numerous tactics that can be employed in a given situation,
through study, practice and game experience, finding the best tactic
becomes almost automatic.  "There may be a hundred stances and sword
positions, but you win with just one."  This is the essence of the "Great
Learning," a guiding principle of Zen Buddhism.  When someone has, "learned
all there is to learn," the optimum strategy and tactics often come
without effort, almost instinctively, and it will become difficult for
others to guess in advance the strategy and tactics you will employ.
Yagyu concludes that this is the ultimate level of mastery in the art
of war.  In Diplomacy, frequent practice and positional analysis, along
with extensive game experience can lead to a similar result.  Some experienced
players can take a position in at a glance, grasping the tactical possibilities,
thinking multiple turns ahead.  For example, such a player may move
to circumvent a possible stalemate line before others even consider
attempting to form one.  This can be a vital advantage in face to face
Diplomacy, where a superior player would have options worked out quickly,
leaving more time for negotiation.  Conversely other players need more time
at the board to plan their moves and therefore will have less time
available to communicate with and influence others.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I
hope that you will think of the various bits of advice I have related
here as an integrated whole and apply the advice to all facets of
the game.  A player who does not perfect their knowledge and use of
strategy, tactics or negotiation skills will never be able to play Diplomacy
at a consistently high level.  If Yagyu were a Diplomacy player and
was asked to give one brief piece of advice, he would probably say:
Be sneaky, be observant, be calm, be flexible and be all of these as
often as you can.</P>
