<H3>The First Word</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I'm a relative newbie to Diplomacy, having first learned of Diplomacy in December of 2000, but when I first saw it I was in
love. I was determined to make my first game a memorable experience for the others. Devouring all the advice I could online
about tactics was easy enough. Positioning and the purely tactical were based on easy to understand rules. But the Do's and
Don'ts of writing press were much harder to grasp. Everyone puts it in terms of what you have to accomplish ("Make sure 
England leaves the Channel alone until 02".) This put me at a loss on how exactly I'd approach my enemies and potential allies in
negotiation.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That's when I finally found out. <B>You have to lie!</B> How delightful!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That's what I determined diplomacy to be all about. Lying to get exactly what you want. But then an article later, to my great
benefit, I had read that you must be truthful and as honest as possible. Lying should only be done the moment before a stab.
What a way to confuse the newbie. Fortunately this article deals neither with lying nor telling the truth. Merely the method of
how you approach them.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All these interesting thoughts of truth and lies were in my mind as I prepared for my first game. In it I met a veteran who was
Russia while I was Turkey. I opened with two things: politeness and honesty. I told him upfront that more than likely one of us
will end up dead, but before that, let's kill Austria. During the game, our press was frequent and very good at building trust.
Every move he said he'd make he did, and I reacted in kind.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Then we got a replacement Germany, who saw the Juggernaut with fresh eyes. Germany demanded that all powers stop
fighting to stop the Juggernaut or else he'd give up the game to us. I panicked upon hearing this demand. Since it was so
truthful that I thought for sure the rest of the world would buckle down and stomp us. Especially Italy, who I wasn't in a very
good position against.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So I sent out my reply press privately to the other powers. I pleaded innocence with Italy and got Italy to realize that I was
being victimized by a Germany who was just power hungry.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My press worked. A year later Italy fell to my convoyed armies and a year after that I was stabbed by my Russia ally and he
went on to solo (but entirely in the north, he didn't capture a single center past Budapest though I lost Vie and Bud).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even though I lost the game, I learned huge lessons from it. And the interactions I had during that game forever shaped my
future in gaming.<BR>

<P><H3>The Question Word</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><I>Why do I trust people (even to my better judgment) and perhaps more importantly, why do others trust me (even when
all signs point to a stab)?</I></B>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think what it boils down to most is the tone of your press. Short, terse press may get the point across just as well as one that is
more wordy, but the more wordy and polite one may convince your ally to trust you "one last time." Some of you may be
unconvinced. Why on earth would it matter how you say something as long as the offer makes sense? If you're attacked by a
salesman who wants to sell you something, which works better on you? A salesman who is rude, yet has a good product/offer
or a salesman who is polite and soft-spoken?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What about right after a stab, what is the most seen press? I have seen most press to be angry scalding replies that leave me
feeling justified in stabbing the ally I had worked with so well up until then. The few times I've received polite letters
complimenting me on my stab and an offer of one or two more centers with the promise of help against another enemy I have
usually accepted them (sometimes to my own demise).

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What's worse is that this rudeness in press is not merely limited to stabs. I will let some heated press slide if it follows a
particular vicious stab. But nowadays, it seems being polite and good spirited in your press is too much for some people.
Whether they think it's part of the "fun" to take on the persona of a dictator who views all others as lesser, or if they are
themselves like they present themselves I don't know. But I do know that it's time for people to think a little before sending out
press that is less than polite.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How many times have you gotten press (or a broadcast) from a power criticizing another power's decision, or about how
"blind" or "foolish" someone is for not doing as you say. Do those press come off as polite? Can press that is insulting come off
as polite? Certainly. Ever hear of constructive criticism?<BR>

<H3>The Example Word</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Which of these sounds more persuasive?

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR="BLUE">"Dear France,<BR><BR>

I am distressed to see you've chosen to break our previous DMZ of Ruhr and moved your armies into striking distance of my
home centers. It's not yet too late to swing your forces south against the growing Italy who will likely look to you after he and
Russia finish off the last of Turkey. That fleet in Rome especially doesn't seem too friendly.<BR><BR>

If you move south now, you will also free me to move east against Russia, and that will help us both in the long run, since a
strong Russia is no friend of France or Germany.<BR><BR>

Let me know if there is anything else we can discuss to defuse this potentially catastrophic situation in Ruhr.<BR><BR>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><FONT COLOR="BLUE">"Dear France,<BR><BR>

I can't believe you are ignoring Italy's power and attacking me! Are you blind to the threat or do you think the fleet in Rome is
going to move against Turkey? If you do, you either don't know anything about this game or are just throwing the game away!<BR><BR>

Move your forces south! It's the only option!<BR><BR>

Do as I say or else you doom us all!<BR><BR>

Germany"</FONT>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Granted, the second is a little extreme. But I'd be surprised if any of you haven't had a press like the 2nd. It's not so much as
what Germany is saying to France is so harsh, since the points in both are the same, but the tone comes off completely different.
Some people may see both of these examples and say there is no difference, both are acceptable. I take a different stance.
While I will not say the 2nd example is as rude as it could be to considered abusive, it is borderline. And we shouldn't have
borderline press in Diplomacy.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This doesn't mean we can't threaten other powers (Whether or not threats are an effective tactic is another article entirely) in
game! Not at all. In fact, threatening becomes much more fun. For example, let's say we play hardball with Italy, we have two
examples, which sounds more threatening.

Leave Ion now or else I'll roll over your puny country and leave the remains for France. Don't test your luck, I'm impatient
enough with your moronic moves these past few turns.<BR><BR>

I've given some thought to your occupation of Ion, and quite frankly we will not be able to continue peacefully if you remain
there. I have two builds coming up this next turn, and your moves will greatly influence how I use those builds.<BR><BR>

<H3>The After Word</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Post-Victory statements are also very important, in my mind, to continuing to the show of good sportsmanship and respect
that's sometimes so desperately lacking in this game. Just because you are anonymous online does not mean you have free
rein to insult the other players, whether they won or lost! If I were in charge of all of diplomacy, I would make insulting
press one step below cheating. Perhaps a year ban from Diplomacy would straighten these people out. I will give one example
of a press sent by a loser at the end of a game I GM'ed. It was no-press and didn't count for stats on <A HREF="http://www.dipbounced.com">BOUNCED</a> and was
soloed by France. In the interest of privacy, I'll only highlight parts of one paragraph:

<UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><I>I should have realized that both [Powers omitted] were brain dead from the start.<BR>
[Power omitted] you summed up well, and your effort was gutless, timid and grossly inept.<BR>
I've seen better efforts from 10 year olds.</I></B></UL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am not taking this much out of context and it was quite shocking to see such a high ranked player make such abusive
comments. I broadcast the press hoping to get the player to apologize or better yet, change his nature and turn over a new leaf.


<H3>The Last Word</H3>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This game we play is suppose to be fun. When we have a lack of respect for one another we lose that fun. And when a game
isn't fun anymore, it's time to stop playing. It's easy to forget to show respect in a game over the Internet.  After all, you're not
sitting across from the other person - you don't know the other person. Perhaps the only way we can show respect is by
remembering there are real people behind the powers on the board and we don't know whether they like being told bluntly that
they aren't playing well.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In conclusion, next time you prepare to send out some press, think it over a bit and remember, respect your fellow players and they will
respect you. And as any good diplomat knows... respect can give you a huge advantage.
