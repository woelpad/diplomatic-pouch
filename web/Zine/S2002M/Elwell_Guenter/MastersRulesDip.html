<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While there are myriad variants out there, many of which have appeal, it is the elegant simplicity and familiarity of the traditional classic game of Diplomacy that still keep it in a class by itself, as one of the greatest
pastimes ever devised.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, one of the reasons so many variants have been inspired is because the classic game, which portrays so much so well, does not
represent some of the most important phenomena of international power and
intrigue.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The challenge, then, is to add to the historical range and depth of Diplomacy, without sacrificing the simple, elegant concepts and mechanics
that set it apart from so many bookkeeping-ridden "simulations".  We seek
to achieve this with the following six optional rules.  Playing with them
is what we call Masters Rules Diplomacy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The foundation of Masters Rules Diplomacy is the "empowering" of all Supply Centers (similar to what is done in the "1913" Variant).  Playing with
armed "Minor Powers" heightens the realism and challenge of the opening
game.  Providing the Great Powers with influence (Variable Control) over
the units of these Minor Powers very tangibly extends their influence
across the board and in this way, transforms the depth and reach of
players' strategy, tactics, and intrigue. Woe to the player who relies on
brute force alone, or who fails to start negotiating in Spring 1901!
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rebellion, Annexation, Disarmament,and Foreign Aid fill out the Masters Rules with representations of important historical phenomena using the
original concepts and mechanisms of classic Diplomacy.  None of these rules
involves money, chits, or random elements, but only the original Map Spaces
("Provinces"), Armies, Fleets, and Supply Centers.  In a face-to-face game,
of course, some sort of tokens will be necessary to represent the units of
the Minor Powers.</P>

<H3>Masters Rules Diplomacy</H3>
Conceived by Mark G. Elwell and Christopher G.W. Dale<BR>
Prepared and Edited by Mark G. Elwell and Michael E. Guenter
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following rules may be used singly or in combination, with the proviso that some of them presuppose the use of Minor Powers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rules of the standard Diplomacy board game are assumed to be in force, except where and as these rules supersede them.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When using any of these rules, units for which no orders are submitted are presumed to Hold, and are eligible to receive Support.
<H4>MR1.  Minor Powers</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><UL>
a)  Supply Centers which are not part of a Major (player) Power at the
start of the game comprise independent Minor Powers, each with one Army.<P>
b)  The original Supply Centers of Minor Powers are considered to be their
Home Supply Centers.<P>
c)  For the purposes of the game, Minor Powers are considered always to be
in Civil Disorder.<P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><I>NOTES:</I></B> The simplest and most fundamental of the Masters Rules - every dot
starts with a unit.  This Rule replaces the unrealistic scramble to grab
undefended dots, with the need to actually defeat native Armies - Armies
that may even receive Support from one's rivals.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Even if all the other Masters Rules are found to be too exotic for one's taste, this one should be used always.
<H4>MR2.  Variable Control</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><UL>
a)  In addition to his own Great Power, a player is eligible to write
orders for the units of Powers in Civil Disorder, so long as no unit of
his own Power occupies or is adjacent to any Supply Center owned at that
time by the Power or Powers for which he writes such orders.<P>
Adjacency is determined in the same manner as for Support; a unit which can
physically move into a Space in a single turn is considered adjacent to it.<P>
b)  This rule does not enable a player to write more valid orders in a
turn than the number of Supply Centers his Power owns.<P>
c)  A player may submit the same Variable Control order more than once in a
Spring or Fall turn.  This rule does not, however, enable a player to write
more valid orders in a turn than the number of Supply Centers his Major
Power owns.<P>
d)  Notwithstanding b), any player eligible to write for a CD Power's unit
may write one Retreat or Disband order for each such unit which is subject
to Retreat or Disband, without regard to the number of Supply Centers or
units he owns, or influence upon any Retreats or Disbands of his own units.<P>
e)  Similarly, if CD Powers for which a player is eligible to write are
subject to Adjustments, a player may write one construct or lose order for
each such Adjustment, without regard to, or influence upon, his own Power's
Adjustments.<P>
f)  Players may not use Variable Control to order CD Powers to themselves
write Variable Control orders for yet other Powers.

<B>EXAMPLE</B>: In Fall 1901<BR>
<UL><P>France writes:
F Gas -S- (A Mar-Spa)<BR>

Portugal A Por -S- (French) A Mar-Spa<BR>

</UL>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">France writes for Portugal to support his invasion of Spain, but both Germany and Italy write for Portugal to oppose it (Italy writing twice, in
case France received assistance from another Power).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The result is that Portuguese A Por Supports Spanish A Spa, which repels the French attack; Spanish independence is preserved, and Germany owes
Italy something, which he can repay without undue cost or risk to himself.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><B><I>NOTES:</I></B>  What the original Diplomacy rules do to represent the Armies and Fleets, this rule does to represent ambassadors, agents, military advisers, and local puppets - the means by which Great Powers influence Minor Powers
to do their bidding.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Minor Power Forces by themselves add, for example, to the already great difficulty of Italy to grow as easily as other Great Powers.  The ability to
submit orders for Minor Powers, however, enables him to exert the sort of
muscular and far-reaching influence of a Cavour.
<H4>MR3: Rebellion</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><UL>
a)  A player due to construct one or more units for his own Great Power in
an Adjustment phase may choose instead to construct one or more Rebel units
in the Supply Centers of other Powers.  Rebel units are presumed to be in
Civil Disorder, and may therefore receive orders by Variable Control.<P>
b)  A Supply Center is eligible to have a Rebel unit constructed in it if
it is neither occupied by, nor adjacent to, a unit of the Power which owns
it.<P>
Adjacency is determined in the same manner as for Support; a unit which can
physically move into a Space in a single turn is considered adjacent to it.<P>
c)  In the case of a Home Supply Center, if a valid order to construct a
Rebel unit conflicts with a valid order to construct a unit of the Power
which owns the Supply Center, neither order is followed unless one is
written a greater number of times than the other.  For this purpose, a
player may choose to write the same construction order more than once,
instead of writing separate construct orders to which he is entitled; even
if successful, this of course results only in the construction of a single
unit.<P>
d)  A Rebel unit, being constructed after determination of ownership of
Supply Centers, does not immediately own the Supply Center in which it is
constructed.<P>
e)  A Rebel unit is initially named by its type and the Supply Center in
which it is constructed.  It is subsequently referred to as Rebel (unit
Type) (Space Occupied), until such time as it gains ownership of, and
identity with, a Supply Center, or it is Disbanded.<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>EXAMPLE</B>:
<UL>After Fall 1901:<BR>
Russia has units A Gal, A Rum, F StP(S), F Sev, and is entitled to construct one unit.<BR>
Turkey has units F BlS, A Bul, and A Smy, and is entitled to construct one unit.<BR>
Germany has units A Hol, A Ruh, and F Kie, and is entitled to construct one unit.
</UL>
<UL><P>In Adjustments 1901:<BR>
Russia writes: build A Mos<BR>
Turkey writes: build Rebel A Mos<BR>
Germany writes: build Rebel A Mos
</UL>
In this case, a Rebel Army is raised in Moscow.
</BLOCKQUOTE></UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B><I>NOTES:</I></B>  While in no way necessary to the enjoyment of Masters Rules
Diplomacy, this rule provides a way to represent the sort of uprisings that
often bedeviled the Powers historically when they paid too much attention
to military adventures far from home.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The victim of a Rebellion, of course, has a year to make sure the Rebels don't gain ownership of his dot (if playing, as recommended, with Variable
Control, he is even eligible to write orders for the Rebel unit before it
can do so).  This will ensure a tidy end to most uprisings - unless, of
course, they receive guidance from hostile (and rich) Great Powers.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In practice, astute players will leave garrison units placed so as to deter insurgencies (e.g., a Russian Army in Moscow prevents Rebellion in any of his Home Supply Centers), but if a Power's far-flung empire starts
suffering losses, the masses may rise up...
<H4>MR4:  Annexation</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><UL>
a)  A player due to construct one or more units for his own Power in an
Adjustment phase may choose instead to Annex a Supply Center which his Power
owns, and which it owned in the previous Adjustments phase.  If eligible,
more than one Supply Center may be Annexed in the same Adjustment phase.<P>
b)  Annexation may take place regardless of whether the Supply Center in
question is occupied at the time.<P>
c)  Once annexed, a Supply Center becomes a Home Supply Center and the
owning Power may construct units there, beginning with the Adjustment phase
following that in which the Annexation takes place, so long as the Power
still owns that Supply Center.<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>EXAMPLE</B>:<BR>
Austria-Hungary takes Serbia in Fall 1901, and owns five dots,
including Serbia, and four units (thus eligible for a build), after Fall
1902. He writes: Adjustments 1902 Annex Serbia<P>
Serbia is now a Home Supply Center of Austria-Hungary.<P>
Come Adjustments phase 1903, if he still owns Serbia and has more Supply
Centers than units, and if Serbia is unoccupied, Austria may now write: Adjustments 1903 construct A Ser
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B><I>NOTES:</I></B>  This rule allows the game to portray the historical phenomenon also
known as Statehood, Dominion, Anschluss, and so forth.
Balance is provided by the need to own a dot for at least two years before
you can build on it.
<H4>MR5:  Disarmament</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><UL>
a)  In the Adjustments phase, a player may voluntarily Disband any or all
of his own Power's units.<P>
b)  Since determination of unit Adjustments precedes actual construction or
loss, a Disband under this rule does not enable immediate construction of
another unit.<P>
c)  This rule enables only the disbanding of a player's own units, and may
not be used to disband units of a Power in Civil Disorder through Variable
Control, beyond any losses that are required normally.<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>EXAMPLE</B>:<BR>
For Adjustments 1901, England owns three units and four Supply Centers, and writes:  Build F Lvp Disband A Yrk
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B><I>NOTES:</I></B>  Ease tensions with mutual arms reductions, or quell another Power's
fears by unilateral disarmament, and reap the "peace dividend". Or, simply
disband that Army you don't need, and build a Fleet instead next year.</P>
<H4>MR6:  Foreign Aid</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><UL>
a)  For each construct order to which a player Power is entitled, but does
not submit, in a particular Adjustment phase, a player may write one valid
order to Aid another Major or Minor Power, or a Rebel unit.  An eligible
donor may submit multiple Aid orders for a single recipient, or for more
than one recipient.<P>
b)  The recipient of a valid Aid order may construct a unit, avoid loss of
a unit, or Annex a Supply Center precisely as if the recipient Power or
Rebel unit had owned one more Supply Center at the start of the current
Adjustment phase.  Valid Aid may be received from any number of donors in
the same Adjustment phase.<P>
c)  The effects of Aid last only to the end of the Adjustment phase when it
is granted.  This rule, therefore, does not affect the number of orders
either a donor or a recipient of Aid may write in any Spring or Fall turn.<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<B>EXAMPLE</B>:<BR>
France owns eight dots and six units in the Adjustment phase of
1905. He writes:  <tt>Aid Italy</tt> and <tt>Aid Rebel A Arm</tt><p>
Italy owns four dots and four units.  Anticipating France's Aid, he
(successfully, as it turns out) writes:  <tt>Build A Ven</tt><p>
Likewise, the Rebels in Armenia, who would otherwise have been eliminated,
fight on into 1906.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
<B><I>NOTES:</I></B>  Foreign Aid, also known by such names as fraternal solidarity,
development assistance, and Lend-Lease, of course adds to the historical
depth and range of the game, but it can also be very powerful in play.
Just imagine: you think you've finally eliminated that doughty enemy Power
- or those pesky Rebels - only to have some meddler keep them in the field
with a timely infusion of supplies!</P>

<H3>Conclusion</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These rules grew out of efforts by one of the authors, dating
back some twenty years, to develop a game representing worldwide military
and diplomatic strategy in the decade 1935-45.  After setting up - and
knocking down - structures that always turned out unwieldy, it all boiled
down to a realization that nothing can improve on the basic streamlined
concepts and mechanics of Diplomacy.  These can simply be extended to
cover whatever phenomenon players wish to include, which is what we have
done here.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This of course means that, while the Masters Rules are not themselves a variant, they can be played with other maps and variant rules.  Existing automated adjudication programs should also accomodate these rules quite
easily.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Masters Rules have been refined and tested over the past ten years by dozens of players in both face-to-face and refereed e-mail games (many of
whom said they could "never go back").  It is the intent of this article
that many more players will try them, and discover the enormous power and
realism they add to the classic game of Diplomacy - without adding clutter
to, or taking anything away from, this greatest of games.
