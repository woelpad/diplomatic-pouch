<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A year ago, when this feature first appeared in The Pouch Zine, I indicated that it would be a regular feature. Well, despite our absence in the last issue, I wanted to renew this promise. With a new editor at the helm of the Zine, and with something of a renewed focus here at the Face to Face desk, I think that the Zine is back on schedule. Since this is the first issue that The Pouch has released in a while, I thought that I should catch everyone up on what's going on in the world of face to face Diplomacy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">First off, belated congratulations should go out to at least two players for roughly equivalent accomplishments.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2001 North American Diplomacy Grand Prix, which recognizes the player who performs the best at all the tournaments he attends over the year, was won narrowly by Jerry Fest of Oregon over Spencer Bernard now of Texas. The award wasn't wrapped up until the last major event of the year, when both players played at "The Tempest in a Teapot," in Washington D.C.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The 2001 Bismark Cup, the Australasian equivalent to the
North American Grand Prix (and, in fact, its inspiration), was won by Tristan Lee of Victoria. Tristan's accomplishment was perhaps even more impressive as he won four of the six tournaments he attended.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Getting back to current events, I had hoped to get some reviews of WDC XII into this issue of The Pouch, but I'm told that most of the participants are still either hung over, or jet lagged, or both; so that will have to wait for the Retreat issue. Ken Sproat, who I'm told did an excellent job running the event, was good enough to get the results out within a week of the event, which is about the fastest I've ever seen for an event of that size. Manus did send his own
reflections on his play at the tournament, and these appear underneath the
box scores below.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I imagine you all know by now, Australia's Rob Stephenson walked away from the event as the new World Champion. Although a lot of our European and American readers may not know about Rob, I'm sure his victory was no surprise to anyone down under. The new World Champion has won at least ten Diplomacy tournaments since 1995, and perhaps more. A truly astounding number when you think about it. Hopefully Rob will be available to defend his title next February in Denver!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As promised above, The Pouch's Fearless Leader, Manus Hand, did report
on his near miss at Worlds:
<blockquote><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>I co-led the tournament after round 1.  I took a three-way draw as a 14-center
Russia.  People (like David Norman) who looked at the board told me I shouldn't
have agreed to the draw and could have solo'ed.  Who knows?  I prefer to think
that (a) maybe I couldn't have (b) maybe a time-draw would have kept me from
it anyway and (c) even if I could have, soloing in round 1 would be like
yelling to all the other players to come and kill me.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I led the tournament all alone after round 2.  In round 2, I was a 15 center
England and once again was told by some players that I shouldn't have accepted
the three-way draw.
My mistake here was in taking Tunis from my French ally
on the final turn.  If I hadn't "stabbed" France for it, he and I would have
been okay to continue our alliance and perhaps I could have soloed.  But
taking Tunis put him on the other side of the board, and he, Chetan Radia,
and the others would have been able to make sure that I couldn't have soloed.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Leading the tournament as I was, I was targeted in round three.  I was targeted
by Dominick Stephens -- I sure wish I had known </i><u>his</u><i> results going into the
round -- he was right behind me!  I was Italy to his Germany, and William
Attia (who I </i><u>knew</u><i> was right behind me) was in France.  William and I were so
concerned about each other that Dominick (who neither William nor I knew
was right there with us in the top three) took advantage and both William
and I were dispatched basically by the rest of the board.  Dominick agreed to
the draw as soon as I was all the way out -- William held a single center
so he got three more points than did I; I think Dominick didn't know where
William stood.  <img src=/Zine/Common/smiley.gif>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So I came out of my third game in third place.  In one of the rounds that I (along
with 80% of the other players) didn't play, Rob Stephenson solo'ed, putting him
in the lead (for good, as it turned out).  I needed a 15 to overtake him
in my final game.  I was told that all of the other tournament leaders had
crappy final rounds, so it could have been done.  I was on nine with what I
think I could have easily played to a sure 12 or more when I misplayed.  I
stabbed England (sorry, Doug!) when I shouldn't have, which let Turkey
(Andrew Cheevers -- another guy whose position in the tournament I should
have scouted!) out of
his box, and I ended the game on six.  Until my mistaken stab of Doug, I
honestly felt like I was playing one of the best games of my life.  I had
successfully parried an opening onslaught by a united Italy/Austria (Steve
Gould and Jason Whitby) alliance, outguessing them even with unwanted supports,
etc., and forming a line against them while keeping a very solid E/F/G
together.  I shouldn't have stabbed England -- at least not until Austria was
finally dead and the line against Turkey was completely solid.  That is the
mistake that, I think, cost me my shot at the top spot.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As it is, I came home with the sixth place trophy, one point out of fifth place,
and eight points back of Rob, our new World Champion.  I also took Best
England and tied for Best Russia (which went to the other guy on a tie-break,
using a method that the Aussies -- and, from what David Norman tells me, the
Brits as well -- call "on countback").
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I returned with the best of impressions about every one of the players I met
down there, and I hope that the bonds we formed at the board and the bar-rails
will continue and grow forever.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Manus</I></blockquote>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well, that should about do it for this issue. I'd encourage anyone who has observations about tournaments they've attended to send them to The Pouch, and I hope to see you at a tournament very soon. For my part, I'm off to look for cheap flights to DixieCon for the 2002 North American Championships!
