<a NAME="Intro"><hr><h3>Introduction</h3></a>


<p>This is the second article in a series discussing the Payola Diplomacy
variant.  The first article,
<a HREF="../../W1996A/Tarzan/Basics.html">Bribery
Basics</a>, provided a high-level overview of the basic mechanics of the game
from the player's perspective.  This article will discuss some of the more
complex tools at the player's disposal as well as some strategy and tactics.  A
future article will discuss more advanced strategies as well as some coming
changes to the game itself.</p>

<p>The current article assumes that the reader is familiar with the Diplomacy
rules as well as the basic Payola rules as described in this series' first
article, <a HREF="../../W1996A/Tarzan/Basics.html">Bribery Basics</a>. 
The reader should clearly understand the "Simple" Bribe as
well as how the Acceptance List is utilized.</p>

<p>The complete annotated Payola rules can be found in the
<a HREF="../../W1995A/Payola">Winter 1995 Adjustment issue of
<i>The Pouch</i></a>.</p>

<p><a NAME = Howmany><hr><h3>How many different Bids should I make for
the same unit?</h3></a></p>


<p>This is a simple question with some subtle intricacies.  While each
situation will vary, a good rule of thumb is to "make a bid for <b>each
and every</b> order that you are willing to accept should it succeed." 
You might think that this strategy is wastefull, but keep in mind that
each unit can only issue <b>one</b> order.  Therefore, even if you make
10 different bids for the same unit, you can rest assured that at most
only one of them can succeed!  Furthermore, remember that 0 AgP bids
cost you nothing!  These, seemingly insignificant, bids can come into
play in the event of ties (see <a HREF = #ZeroAgP>below</a>).</p>


<p><a NAME = OrderPriority><hr><h3>Putting your bids in Preference
Order</h3></a></p>


<p>When considering a certain army or fleet, a Payola player will often
know exactly what he wants that unit to do.  His only decision is how
much he's willing to pay for this prospect.  Consider your opening
orders playing as France in a standard Diplomacy game.  Say you decide
that you want the order Fleet Brest -> Mid-Atlantic Ocean to succeed and
that you would be willing to pay 7 AgP for this outcome.  This can be
easily represented as a "simple" bribe as follows:</p>

<p><center><table>
	<th><p>France</p>
	<tr><td><tt>7 : F Bre-Mid
</table></center></p>

<p>Unfortunately, life (and Diplomacy) is not always this easy. 
Consider the "German Army in Burgundy" dilemma for France in the opening
scenario.  There are many different approaches to this problem. 
However, for our purposes, let's assume that the least desirable order
is A Mun-Bur (the last bid below).  Here's one way of handling the
bidding:</p>

<p><center><table>
	<th><p>France</p>
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun-Sil
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun-Ber
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun-Boh
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun-Tyr
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun S A Ber-Sil
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun HOLD
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun S A Ber
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun S F Kie
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun S A Par-Bur
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun S A Ber-Kie
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun-Ruh
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun-Bur
</table></center></p>

<p>Notice that only one of these bids can succeed (that is, A Mun can
only select one order).  Therefore, for a price of 5 AgP A Mun will
"choose" one of these orders (depending on how other players have bid). 
Furthermore, note the order in which these bids are listed (from highest
to lowest priority).  France has chosen to list bids for A Mun heading
eastward first amongst the various bids for this unit.  In the event of
a tie the order in which the bids are listed becomes important.  For
this reason it is important to <b>always</b> place your bids for the
<b>same</b> unit in order of preference, <b>regardless of the AgP
amount</b>.</p>


<p><a NAME = Priorities><hr><h3>Don't confuse bids' Monetary (AgP)
Amounts with a Unit's Order Preference</h3></a></p>


<p>In the above example, France (correctly) listed his bids in priority
order (from most to least desirable).  However, from a monetary
perspective these bids all paid the same amount of AgP.  In essence
France was saying, "these bids are all Monetarily equivalent to me." 
Usually, this is not the case.  A Payola player may find more than one
order "acceptable", but may have a definite preference for how much he'd
be willing to spend for this order.  Modifying France's bids could
produce the following list of bids:</p>

<p><center><table>
	<tr><th><p>France</p>
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun-Sil
	<tr><td><tt>6 : A Mun-Ber
	<tr><td><tt>7 : A Mun-Boh
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun-Tyr
	<tr><td><tt>4 : A Mun HOLD
	<tr><td><tt>4 : A Mun S A Par-Bur
	<tr><td><tt>2 : A Mun-Ruh
</table></center></p>

<p>Here, France is stating that he is willing to spend more AgP for
certain orders for A Mun than for others.  This is indicated by the
bribe amounts.  However, he <b>still</b> lists the bids in order of
preference!  Notice that it is possible to have a higher preference bid
offering <b>less</b> AgP than a lower preference bid.  Let's continue
evaluating this scenario looking at Germany's bids:</p>

<p><center><table>
	<th><p>Germany</p>
	<tr><td><p>ACCEPTANCE LIST:  GFAITRE</p>
	<tr><td><tt>5 : A Mun-Ruh
	<tr><td><tt>2 : A Mun HOLD
	<tr><td><tt>7 : A Mun-Bur
</tt></table></center></p>

<p>The bidding results can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p><center><table BORDER = 1>
	<th>Order<th>France<th>Germany<th>Total
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Mun&nbsp;->&nbsp;Sil
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>5 AgP
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>5 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Mun&nbsp;->&nbsp;Ber
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>6 AgP
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>6 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Mun&nbsp;->&nbsp;Boh
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Mun&nbsp;->&nbsp;Tyr
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>5 AgP
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>5 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Mun&nbsp;HOLD
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>4 AgP
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>2 AgP
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>6 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Mun&nbsp;S&nbsp;A&nbsp;Par&nbsp;->&nbsp;Bur
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>4 AgP
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>4 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Mun&nbsp;->&nbsp;Ruh
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>2 AgP
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>5 AgP
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Mun&nbsp;->&nbsp;Bur
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
</table></center></p>

<p>In this case a tie occurs (7 AgP for both A Mun-Ruh and A Mun-Bur). 
In order to resolve this tie Germany's Acceptance List is consulted. 
Since Germany is first on his own Acceptance List we consult his own
bids for A Mun.  Of the two tying bids, A Mun-Ruh appears <b>first</b>. 
Therefore, this is the order that succeeds!  The fact that Germany bid
more for A Mun-Bur than for A Mun-Ruh is immaterial.  The <b>preference
order</b> (represented by the order of the bids submitted for A Mun) was
the deciding factor.  Had Germany placed his bid for A Mun-Bur
<b>before</b> his bid for A Mun-Ruh, then A Mun-Bur would have
succeeded!</p>


<p><a NAME = ZeroAgP><hr><h3>Don't underestimate the power of 0 AgP
bids</h3></a></p>


<p>Zero AgP bids can become important in the event of a tie.  For
example, consider the scenario of a French Army in Burgundy.  Let's
assume that the following bids were made for this unit:</p>

<p><center><table BORDER = 1 ALIGN = CENTER>
		<th>France <th>Italy <th>Germany
		<tr>
			<td><tt>3&nbsp;:&nbsp;A Bur&nbsp;->&nbsp;Bel
			<td><tt>4&nbsp;:&nbsp;A Bur&nbsp;->&nbsp;Mun
			<td><tt>2&nbsp;:&nbsp;A Bur&nbsp;->&nbsp;Mar
		<tr>
			<td><tt>3&nbsp;:&nbsp;A Bur&nbsp;HOLD
			<td>&nbsp;
			<td><tt>3&nbsp;:&nbsp;A Bur&nbsp;->&nbsp;Par
		<tr>
			<td>&nbsp;
			<td>&nbsp;
			<td><tt>1&nbsp;:&nbsp;A Bur&nbsp;HOLD
		<tr><td COLSPAN = 3 ALIGN = CENTER><tt>FRANCE'S Acceptance List:  FIATERG
</table></center></p>

<p>The bidding results can be summarized as follows:</p>

<p><center><table BORDER = 1>
	<th>Order<th>France<th>Italy<th>Germany<th>Total
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Bur&nbspHOLD
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>3 AgP
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>1 AgP
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>4 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Bur&nbsp->&nbsp;Bel
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>3 AgP
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>3 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Bur&nbsp->&nbsp;Mun
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>4 AgP
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>4 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Bur&nbsp->&nbsp;Mar
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>2 AgP
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>2 AgP
	<tr>
		<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Bur&nbsp->&nbsp;Par
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td>&nbsp;
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>3 AgP
		<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>3 AgP
</table></center></p>

<p>In this scenario a 2-way tie has occurred between A Bur HOLD and A
Bur-Mun.  Therefore, as with all ties, we consult the appropriate
Acceptance List.  Since, France is first on his own Acceptance List, we
first look at the French bids.  We find A Bur HOLD.  However, A Bur-Mun
does not appear on France's bid list!  The result is that the A Bur HOLD
bid succeeds!!  Had France added the following bid the outcome would
have been different:</p>

<p><center><tt>0 : A Bur-Mun</tt></center></p>

<p>By adding this (seemingly insignificant) 0 AgP bid to France's list
of bids, A Bur-Mun would succeed!!  (note:  this bid would have to
appear <b>before</b> the A Bur HOLD bid on France's bid list)  France's
mistake was that he did not include the A Bur-Mun order on his bid
list!</p>

<p>This example again emphasizes the important principle of issuing a
bid for "<b>each and every</b> order that you are willing to accept
should it succeed."  Furthermore, this example demonstrates the power of
the 0 AgP bid.</p>

<p>The 0 AgP bid principle can also be applied to foreign units, but is
somewhat more limitted (since 0 AgP bids by a foreign power for his own
units will "override" your 0 AgP bids for his units).  However, when a
foreign power makes the mistake of not adhering to the "each and every
acceptable order ..." principle your 0 AgP bids for <b>his</b> units can
have a profound effect on the orders <b>his</b> units issue!</p>


<p><a NAME = Eggs><hr><h3>Where to put your "Eggs" or "To Hedge or not
to Hedge..."</h3></a></p>


<p>One of the questions that comes up when playing Payola is, "Should I
only bid for the one order I want the unit to choose, or should I bid
for all acceptable orders for that unit?"  Consider your opening orders
playing as Austria in a standard Diplomacy game.  Let's look at the
options for Army Budapest:</p>

<p><center><table>
	<th><p>Austria</p>
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest HOLD
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest -> Vienna
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest -> Trieste
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest -> Galicia
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest -> Rumania
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest -> Serbia
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT         Army  Vienna
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT         Fleet Trieste
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT         Army  Vienna -> Trieste
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT         Army  Vienna -> Galicia
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT ITALIAN Army  Venice -> Trieste
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT RUSSIAN Army  Warwas -> Galicia
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT RUSSIAN Fleet Sevastopol -> Rumania
</table></center></p>

<p>Of all these possible orders, let's assume that Austria eliminates
the undesirable orders and ranks the remaining orders in the following
priority (from highest to lowest):</p>

<p><center><table>
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest -> Serbia
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest -> Rumania
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT Army  Vienna -> Trieste
	<tr><td><tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT Army  Vienna -> Galicia
</table></center></p>

<p>Now that Austria has narrowed down the choices, all that remains is
to draft the appropriate bids.  The real decision is what monetary value
to assign to each bid.  There are many different possibilities, but
let's consider three special cases:</p>

<p><center><table BORDER = 1>
	<th>"All or Nothing"<th>"Hedged"<th>"Balanced"
	<tr>
		<td><tt>5 : A Bud-Ser
		<td><tt>5 : A Bud-Ser
		<td><tt>5 : A Bud-Ser
	<tr>
		<td><tt>0 : A Bud-Rum
		<td><tt>5 : A Bud-Rum
		<td><tt>3 : A Bud-Rum
	<tr>
		<td><tt>0 : A Bud S A Vie-Tri
		<td><tt>5 : A Bud S A Vie-Tri
		<td><tt>1 : A Bud S A Vie-Tri
	<tr>
		<td><tt>0 : A Bud S A Vie-Gal
		<td><tt>5 : A Bud S A Vie-Gal
		<td><tt>1 : A Bud S A Vie-Gal
</table></center></p>

<p>The first case is an "all or nothing" approach.  Either A Bud-Ser
succeeds (and 5 AgP is paid) or it fails.  This strategy has the
advantage of not spending money on less desirable orders.  However, the
drawback is that if Austria is outbid, then he effectively has little
(or no) influence on what this unit will do.</p>

<p>By the way, if you're wondering "are those zero bids necessary", the
answer is yes!  They could come into play in the event of a tie
(depending on the bids of other players).  Remember, if you do
<b>not</b> list an order as a bid, then it may <b>never</b> have a
chance to be considered!</p>

<p>The second case is a "hedged" approach.  Here Austria will spend 5
AgP for any of the listed orders.  With this strategy Austria is using a
more defensive strategy.  Should his first choice (A Bud-Ser) be outbid,
he still has 3 backup bids.  The advantage here is that even if
Austria's first choice is rejected, he still can affect what this unit
will do through his other bids.  The disadvantage is that this strategy
is wasteful.  The same monetary amount is spent even if a less desirable
order is chosen.</p>

<p>The third case is a "balanced" approach.  Austria is still making a
strong commitment to his first choice (A Bud-Ser), but is "hedging" his
bid by offering some backup bids.  These backup bids, however, are for
less AgP and are, therefore, less effective.</p>

<p>From this discussion you may be tempted to always use the "balanced"
strategy; however, this is a mistake!  Often a player has to choose
between conserving AgP and defensive bidding.  Each scenario must be
carefully evaluated on an individual basis.  At different times each of
the 3 strategies are appropriate.</p>


<a NAME = Conclusion><hr><h3>Conclusion</h3></a>
