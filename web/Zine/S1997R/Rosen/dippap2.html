This paper will explore the application of Game Theoretical concepts

the paper will discuss to what extent Diplomacy conforms to the methodological
requirements of rational choice analysis and Game Theoretical analysis,
and discuss where problems arise.
The paper will then discuss what kind of <EM>game</EM>
Diplomacy is best described as, suggesting that its overall

<B>Note from the author:</B>
This paper does not provide the promised sequel to my
<A HREF="../../S1996R/Rosen/dippap.html">first article</A>.  
That is it will not cover non-game theoretical approaches in IR 
(such as Robert Jervis' Theory of Misperception). It will instead be 
just another game theoretical paper.  But it is in my opinion far 
better than the first. That early assay into unknown waters 
displayed some interesting failures to grasp basic concepts.  
Informed by a year of hard-core Rational Choice courses, this one 
should promise more.

<H4>Introduction</H4>
The game Diplomacy, in its standard form as sold by Hasbro,
is a seven-player strategy game played on a map of pre-First World War Europe
<A HREF="#footnote2"><SUP><SMALL>2</SMALL></SUP></A>.
In Diplomacy, there are no dice or other instruments of chance;
the outcome of every move is determined by a combination of each players
actions, or, in the games' terms, their <EM>orders</EM>.
The object of the game is to expand to control more than half the
<EM>power centers</EM> on the map.
For practical purposes, winning is only possible through cooperation
with other players
<A HREF="#footnote3"><SUP><SMALL>3</SMALL></SUP></A>
- each of whom seeks the same goal.
While draws are possible, and unavoidable in stalemate positions,
winning is the goal
<A HREF="#footnote4"><SUP><SMALL>4</SMALL></SUP></A>.
There is thus a basic tension in <EM>Diplomacy</EM>: cooperation is all but
essential to victory, but victory is only possible at the expense of those
whose cooperation the would-be winner seeks.
<P>
The objective of the game, and its condition of systemic anarchy (there is no
higher power than the players beyond the technical rules of the game)
provide a Hobbseian condition undoubtedly purer than the international 
<EM>reality</EM> deduced by the harshest of neorealist theorists
<A HREF="#footnote5"><SUP><SMALL>5</SMALL></SUP></A>.
Moreover, the lack of the status quo as a preferred final outcome for any
player (as opposed to in the real world)
<A HREF="#footnote6"><SUP><SMALL>6</SMALL></SUP></A>
coupled with a normative environment
that typically admires guile, deviousness and ruthlessness, drastically
limits the power of moral constraints in mitigating the state of nature.
Keeping in mind that as in all zero-sum games, others' gains and losses effect
the relative position of each player, the simplifying assumption of egoism
requires little justification in <EM>Diplomacy</EM>.

<H4>Diplomacy and the Methodological Postulates of Rational Choice Theory</H4>
Before plunging into a detailed discussion of how Game Theory can be used
to understand strategies and tactics used within <EM>Diplomacy</EM>, it is
first desirable to ascertain to what extent the game conforms the necessary
methodological assumptions of Game Theory and its parent,
Rational Choice Theory. To the extent that does not, all such analyses will
risk a <EM>priori</EM> invalidation.
<P>
The two fundamental underpinning assumptions of Rational Choice are
methodological individualism and purposeful action
<A HREF="#footnote7"><SUP><SMALL>7</SMALL></SUP></A>.
Methodological individualism simply means that outcomes can be understood by
reference to individual preferences and choices, rather than through
institutional characteristics or collective units of analysis.
To analyze real political events with Rational Choice Theory, making this
assumption necessitates coming down firmly on one side of a great
methodological debate; to so analyze <EM>Diplomacy</EM>, no such commitment
is necessary.
Players are individuals, and though decisions as to which orders to give may be
influenced by other players, the institution that provides the basic level of
input which leads to outcomes on the "macro" scale of the game is the player.
The analyst will find no barrier here to further examination of
<EM>Diplomacy</EM>.
<P>
Purposive action is simply the assumption of rationality itself.
Actions are aimed at achieving outcomes, and all outcomes have transitive
preference relationships to each other. A rational player will always choose
those actions that he believes will lead to the outcome that he most prefers,
of those possible. <EM>Diplomacy</EM> players on the whole (there are always
exceptions of course) would seem to offer little difficulty to the rationality
assumption, assuming reasonably that they have read the rules well enough to
understand which actions lead to which outcomes.

<H4>Game Theory and the Game</H4>
The main characteristic of a case suitable for Game Theoretical analysis is
that outcomes are determined by the actions of a player and the actions of
other players (and possibly of nature). Particular payoffs/outcomes correspond
to each combination of the players' strategies.
The further assumption is made, a corollary to the purposive action of Rational
Choice, that players try to maximize their payoffs, and that <EM>they</EM>
assume that other players do the same. Nothing here violates either the design
or practice of <EM>Diplomacy</EM> play. It is this basic interaction between
the actions taken by each player and the outcome experienced by all players
that make <EM>Diplomacy</EM> a fit topic for Game Theoretical analysis.
<P>
However, there may be a problem with transitivity when applied to the
expectations of a player in assuming the motivations of other players.
Given that each player knows the other players' preference rankings and has
a preference ranking which is known to all other players (and that each player
knows that the others know that player's preference rankings, and so on)
- possible outcomes and payoffs are <EM>common knowledge</EM> -
a Game Theoretical analysis is possible.
While all rational players should have transitive preferences, problems arise
if one or more players have non-standard preference rankings (i.e., other those
stipulated by the rules). Though a player with non-standard preference rankings
will still likely conform to the rationality assumption necessary for Rational
Choice analysis (the non-standard preferences may still be transitive, and the
players actions will still aim to achieve the best possible outcomes as he sees
them), the effect will hinder the attempts of other players and of the analyst
to analyze the behavior of the player. The standard preferences are as follows:
<OL><EM>
<LI>Winning
<LI>2 - way draw
<LI>3 - way draw
<LI>4 - way draw
<LI>5 - way draw
<LI>6 - way draw
<LI>Survival
<LI>Elimination
</EM></OL>
However, although the official rules state that the object of the game is to
win, individual players may prefer a long-lasting alliance that culminates in
a draw, ruling out actions that would lead to even certain victory. Since there
is more than small incentive for a player to give the impression that one is
such a player, most other players assume that all player's have the standard
preferences. The nature of the game is such that the presence of a
draw-preferring player (a <EM>"carebear"</EM> in the hobby's jargon) will
violate the rationality assumption at least insofar as other players would
analyze his behavior. For his actions, rather than being aimed at achieving his
"most preferred" outcome (as others will see) will in fact be aimed
at achieving a "lesser" outcome.
<P>
Even if this player declares his true preferences, the others will assume,
as well they might, that the true carebear is just another <EM>"cutthroat"</EM>
like themselves. Thus although a player with non-standard preference rankings
will not be irrational from his own perspective, the nature of the game will
confound the attempts of other players - and the analyst - to predict his
behavior. The practical effect is the same as if the player was actually
irrational as that player's actions will not be aimed at achieved at aiming
what others' expect to be his most preferred outcome - winning. Of course, it
might be possible for players to incorporate the probability that other players
have non-standard preferences into their considerations. But this, while not
making analysis impossible, makes it extremely complex. For the purposes of
this paper, the models given assume that all players have standard
preference rankings <A HREF="#footnote8"><SUP><SMALL>8</SMALL></SUP></A>.
<P>
Another requirement of standard Game Theory is that preferences remain fixed
throughout the game. While the actions of others interacting with the actions
of the player must effect the outcome for Game Theory to be applicable
<A HREF="#footnote9"><SUP><SMALL>9</SMALL></SUP></A>, actions of other
players should not effect the <EM>preferences</EM> of the player.
Game Theoretical analysis will be distorted if a particular player's
preferences change in the course of game due to the actions of others.
This typically happens when a player holds a grudge, or suffers from 
"sour grapes" syndrome. For example, if player A attacks player B,
and player B's preference rankings change so that B prefers elimination to
surviving if this survival involves Player A's victory (or even survival), the analyst
is stymied.
<P>
Again, there is some incentive for every player to give the impression that
his preferences will change in just this way, to make threats credible in the
common cases where carrying out threat will lead to the threatener's
elimination. Thus the presence of a grudge-holding player - given that true
preferences at variance with the standard preferences are unlikely to be
believed - frustrates rational analysis in the same way that does the presence
of a player with constant but non-standard preferences. And again, the models
here assume players with constant preference rankings.

<H4>What Kind of Game is Diplomacy?</H4>
First and foremost, if players accept the official objective of winning,
<EM>Diplomacy</EM> is a zero-sum game. Only one player can win, and if he does,
all others lose. The specific assets by which victory - and capabilities -
is determined, power centers, are of a fixed and limited number (34 on the
standard map). Except in the beginning, when some power centers are neutral,
the gains of one player directly translate in the losses of at least one other.
Even in the beginning, struggles over neutral centers, at least when looked at
from the perspective of all players, are of a zero-sum character (e.g.,
if France gets Belgium, this means that Germany or England does not).
<P>
However, though <EM>Diplomacy</EM> is in fact a zero-sum game, it is not a
2-person
zero-sum game (unless all other players but two have been eliminated).
This significantly limits the predictive power of the analyst, and of the
players. All 2-person zero-sum games have equilibria in pure or mixed
strategies. Moreover, all equilibria are equivalent and interchangeable
<A HREF="#footnote10"><SUP><SMALL>10</SMALL></SUP></A>.
This does not hold for n-person zero-sum games
<A HREF="#footnote11"><SUP><SMALL>11</SMALL></SUP></A>.
First, many equilibria may exist for which the results of each are not
equivalent to the other. Second, the particular strategies that lead to a
given equilibria will not be the same as those that lead to another.
Since players have no way of determining which equilibria will be reached,
they have no way of knowing which strategies will lead to an equilibria, and
will in most cases have no way of determining with certainty which strategy
would maximize their utility given the strategies of the other players.
Thus, while describing <EM>Diplomacy</EM> as an n-person zero-sum game is
accurate,
this offers little more than the possibility of making broad generalizations
of little use to players or analysts wishing to make predictions.
<P>
Rather than end the discussion on this note of futility, it may be possible to
move forward with Game Theoretical analysis by making an assumption. This is
that the whole of game <EM>Diplomacy</EM> can be usefully broken down into a
set of
sub-games that in themselves differ from the characteristics of n-person
zero-sum games. In the interactions between subgroups of players, strategizing
may be functionalized by reference to other sorts of games - 2-person zero-sum,
2- and n-person games of conflict and cooperation, even 2-person and n-person
games of coordination. All manner of games be taking place
<EM>simultaneously</EM>, bearing in mind that they all fit together under and
are constrained by the overall n-person zero sum game.
<P>
In <EM>Diplomacy</EM>, outright conflicts with other players have the aspect
of 2-person zero-sum games. The efforts of two wary players to form a new
alliance often follow the pattern of iterated cooperative games, where
reciprocity - or outside threat - may succeed in building trust to the point
where two allies can
coordinate their moves in order to make the best use of all their units.
For example, Turkey might consider his dealings with an attacking and
uncommunicative Russia as a two-person zero-sum game, while attempting to
overcome Prisoner's Dilemma logic in establishing an alliance with Austria.
Meanwhile England - facing elimination - might feel the need to coordinate
perfectly his moves with Germany and Italy against an ascendant France.
And yet the overall structure of the n-person zero sum game holds dynamics
which often lead to players reconsidering which sub-games they are playing in
reference to the overall situation. So Turkey may pause in his successful
campaign to gain at Russia's expense if this will lead to Austria's victory,
and England, once secure, might change from coordinating moves with Germany to
plotting against him, once the threat from France has been beaten back, and
Italy may re-frame his understanding of cooperative agreement with Austria
after the Kaiser's armies begin pouring over the border into a 2-person
zero-sum game of minimizing losses.  
<P>
What makes a good player, or a good analyst, of <EM>Diplomacy</EM> is the
ability to
ascertain which sub-games are appropriate for understanding and thus
strategizing in a given game situation. To act as if you are in a game of
coordination with a neighbor when in fact he is thinking in zero-sum terms,
with your losses being his gains, is to invite disaster. Conversely, failing
to see that another player is about to achieve victory might cause one to
continue falling into the trap of Prisoner's Dilemma logic with those with
whom the best and most urgent strategy would call for coordination.
<P>
The appropriate games to be played are a function of expected benefits of
strategies, given which games other players are thought to be playing for that
game turn. In certain situations, such as when one player is about to win the
game, the sub-games are clear, and players tend to coordinate against the
pretender, while the would-be victor attempts to maximize his chances of
victory utilizing mixed and pure strategies within the context a 2-person
zero-sum game of him against a grand coalition. The pretender often holds an
advantage aside from any positional details in that he need only coordinate his
side of the zero-sum within his head, while those that would prevent his
victory must play a game of coordination with each other at the same time as
they <EM>as a group</EM> must face the pretender. On the other hand, a group,
given the
inherent limitations in analyzing often immensely complicated possibilities,
may hold an advantage in that many minds may find solutions that one may miss,
especially under time constraints that exacerbate bounded rationality.

<H4>Some Game Theory Models of Diplomacy</H4>
The ways of using Game Theory models to analyze situations in <EM>Diplomacy</EM>
are all
but infinite. One of the simplest could examine mixed strategy calculations
designed to overcome frequent situations where no one strategy dominates others
in a 2-person zero-sum tactical situation. Mixed strategies are generally
superior to pure maximin strategies in the tactics of <EM>Diplomacy</EM> as
they tend
provide higher benefits. For example, a rare but occasional opening order set
for Italy includes a move from Venice to Piedmont, threatening Marseilles and
leaving France with a quandary, especially if he has opened with the very
common move from Marseilles to Spain. France risks losing Marseilles, but if he
simply moves back using Maximin logic, a laughing Italy can hold his army and
watch as France loses the opportunity to gain Spain in the first turn, and
loses the possibility of building in Marseilles in order to launch a
counter-attack. Limiting the analysis to the two units concerned, and assuming
(as is reasonable after a surprise attack by Italy on France in the first turn)
that both players view the game as a 2-person zero-sum game offers a simple
example of how mixed strategies add to a player's chance of success in
<EM>Diplomacy</EM>. The payoffs given are arbitrary, but in relative terms
hopefully do
not stray too far from the actual consequences of the various outcomes. The
number reflects the payoff to France, the opposite of which is for Italy:
<CENTER><TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH ROWSPAN=2 COLSPAN=2>Orders:</TH><TH COLSPAN=2>Italian Army in Piedmont</TH></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=CENTER>To Mar</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>Holds</TD></TR>
<TR><TH ROWSPAN=2>French Army in Spain</TH><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>to Mar</TD>
	<TD ALIGN=CENTER>0</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>-2</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>Hold</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>-5</TD><TD ALIGN=CENTER>0</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER>
<P>
If France holds to a pure strategy maximin strategy and simply orders back to
Marseilles, and Italy expects this, Italy can simply hold to guarantee a payoff
of 2. Yet France will not profit by simply flipping a coin: if Italy perceives
this strategy, he will surely order to Marseilles as the expected payoff is
2.5 [1/2(-5)+1/2(0)], even higher than if France had followed a pure-strategy
maximin strategy. Yet the simplicity of 2-person zero-sum games with only two
options for each player allows for the best strategy to be determined
algebraically (more complicated situations can be solved with calculus).
From France's point of view, his losses are minimized if he moves to Marseilles
with a probability of P, and probability P is maximized in respect to Italy's
possible options. 
<center>
<IMG SRC="Pgraph.gif">
</center>
On the graph, lines derived from the strategy sets intersect over the best
strategy for France, which is that he should move to Marseilles 5/7 of the
time:
<P><CENTER><TABLE>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>0P -2(1-P)</TD><TH>=</TH><TD ALIGN=LEFT>-5P+0(1-P)</TD></TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN=RIGHT>P</TD><TH>=</TH><TD ALIGN=LEFT>5/7</TD></TR>
</TABLE></CENTER><P>
This strategy yields an expected value to France of -10/7, no matter what
strategy Italy follows. However, Italy is, faced with this logic, is best
advised to move to Marseilles 2/7 of the time (the game is symmetrical), for if
France anticipates that Italy will choose another strategy, France will have
incentive to change to a pure strategy. For example, if Italy decides to move
to Marseilles 1/2 the time, France can achieve an expected payoff of -1 if he
moves to Marseilles with a probability of 1 [1/2(0)+1/2(-2)].
<P>
Although the previous model may be of use to players in maximizing their gains
in uncertain situations (of which <EM>Diplomacy</EM> is full), the model is
not very
interesting for the analyst. It would be much more interesting to derive a
model that went some way toward understand the basic flow of <EM>Diplomacy</EM>
from
opportunistic alliance to back-stabbing to last-ditch efforts at coordinating
against a would-be winner. To do so in anything near a complete manner would
take more paper than exists, as the possible permutations involved in just one
<EM>Diplomacy</EM> move stretch into the trillions. Something in between the
simple
model that explains little more than a tactical technique and a complete one
that explores the full strategic dynamics of the game is therefore needed. By
limiting the players to three (which occurs if four players are eliminated, as
well as with some <EM>Diplomacy</EM> variants)
<A HREF="#footnote12"><SUP><SMALL>12</SMALL></SUP></A>,
and the action sets to strategic
decisions, even limiting these to less that than the conceivable at four, a
model is presented that, while only scratching the surface of the games' logic,
may illuminate.
<P>
Consider a game of <EM>Diplomacy</EM> between players A, B, and C, each
controlling
powers in symmetrical positions. The following strategies <STRONG>for player A
</STRONG> against players B and C to be played simultaneously:
<P>
s<SUB><SMALL>11</SMALL></SUB>=Hold (attack nor support neither opponent)<BR>
s<SUB><SMALL>12</SMALL></SUB>=Support B against C, Attack C<BR>
s<SUB><SMALL>13</SMALL></SUB>=Attack B, Support C against B<BR>
s<SUB><SMALL>14</SMALL></SUB>=Attack both<P>

For player B:<P>
s<SUB><SMALL>21</SMALL></SUB>=Hold (attack nor support neither opponent)<BR>
s<SUB><SMALL>22</SMALL></SUB>=Support A against C, Attack C<BR>
s<SUB><SMALL>23</SMALL></SUB>=Attack A, Support C against A<BR>
s<SUB><SMALL>24</SMALL></SUB>=Attack both<P>

For player C:<P>
s<SUB><SMALL>31</SMALL></SUB>=Hold (attack nor support neither opponent)<BR>
s<SUB><SMALL>32</SMALL></SUB>=Support A against B, Attack B<BR>
s<SUB><SMALL>33</SMALL></SUB>=Attack A, Support B against A<BR>
s<SUB><SMALL>34</SMALL></SUB>=Attack both<P>

The expected values of attacking are in an arbitrary but ranked relatively
scaled point system as follows:
<P>
<CENTER> 1 + 2 if supported - 1 if facing a reciprocal attack.</CENTER>
<P>
As the game is zero-sum, gains by the attacker are equal to losses by the
player attacked. For example, with the strategy set
{s<SUB><SMALL>13</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>22</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>34</SMALL></SUB>} the result
for A is 0 (1 for attack against B -1 from attack by C), for B is -3 (-1 from
attack by A, 0 from attack on C, -2 from the supported attack by C), and the
payoff for C is 3 (1 from the attack on A, 2 from the supported attack on C).
<P>
With even this limited set of strategies, there are 64 possible outcomes. This
is barely manageable in extended form (see picture below). An analysis of the game
tree provides some insights into the basic logic of a <EM>Diplomacy</EM> turn.
At any
point on the tree, the dominant strategy for each player is to attack both of
the others. As the game is symmetrical, this results in an equilibrium strategy
set of {s<SUB><SMALL>14</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>24</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>34</SMALL></SUB>} yielding a payoff to
each player of 0. Yet this is not a
better outcome than what can be achieved by two players working in concert
against the third. For example {s<SUB><SMALL>12</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>22</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>34</SMALL></SUB>}
yields a payoff of 2,2, and -4
for A, B, and C respectively. However, any attempt to cooperate is hindered by
fears that the other player will take advantage of the support to make an even
larger gain.  If player B plays s<SUB><SMALL>24</SMALL></SUB> instead of s<SUB><SMALL>22</SMALL></SUB>
the payoffs will change to 0, 3, -3, and of course player B
rationally prefers 3 to 2. The temptation to defect exists for all would-be
coalition partners. It is not possible to overcome this Prisoner's dilemma
logic in a one-shot, or rather a one turn game, since normal methods of
escaping the problematic, such as moral constraints or intervention of a
super powerful actor (e.g., the state), are not available within the context of
<EM>Diplomacy</EM> (and such things would ruin the game or at very least
change it beyond recognition).

<CENTER><IMG SRC="tree.gif"></CENTER>

However, <EM>Diplomacy</EM> games do not typically begin and end in non-stop
stalemate. The fact <EM>Diplomacy</EM> is played over many turns
(typically between 8 and 20 game years, each consisting of 2 movement turns),
allow for the Prisoner's
Dilemma to be escaped at least temporarily. Most import in this context is
perhaps the concept of reciprocity you help me this turn, I help you the next,
and so forth. 
<P>
Another concept that may enable cooperation is the existence of heuristic foci
that experienced players may use to reduce the uncertainty of picking which
players will make reliable allies. This can simply be reading the way someone
speaks, or perhaps more reliably, taking a good look at the map. The designers
of standard <EM>Diplomacy</EM> have evidently placed much effort into making the
positions of each power roughly equal. Even so, certain relationships are more
natural grounds for alliance than others, especially in the beginning of the
game. For example, Italy and Austria make natural allies. Austria faces all but
certain elimination at the hands of Turkey and Russia if he attacks Italy at
the start. Italy, though he may make quick gains from a quick stab of Austria,
will soon face the same problem in protecting his winnings. As the benefits of
stabbing each other are in this manner less than going against others, there is
an inherent trust possible in an early Austro-Italian alliance.
<P>
Finally, this model assumes powers in symmetric positions, something that is
fairly rare in <EM>Diplomacy</EM> play. Actually, when they do occur, the game
often
ends in a draw, as players calculate the benefits of a 3-way draw compared to
the chances of attacking for a win and risking elimination. In many situations,
however, unequal power distributions can lead to greater possibilities for
cooperation. Particularly when one power is about to achieve victory, the
incentive for cooperation and even detailed coordination of moves becomes much
greater.   
<P>
To see this in terms of the model, consider a situation where Player C will win
in the next turn if he receives and result better than -3. This could be a
reflection of greater power and a small leap needed for victory. In terms of
the overall game, players A and B lose more in any outcome set that involves a
result for C better than -3, <EM>than any payoffs A or B can gain</EM>, since
they lose the game. In this situation, the strategy set
{s<SUB><SMALL>14</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>24</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>34</SMALL></SUB>} is no longer an equilibrium.
Rather, in this case {s<SUB><SMALL>12</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>22</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>34</SMALL></SUB>} becomes
the equilibrium with
payoffs of 2,2,-4. If either A or B deviates from this strategy set, the result
is a victory for C. For example,
{s<SUB><SMALL>12</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>24</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>34</SMALL></SUB>} leads to -1,3,-2. This is
understandable in reference to the overall preference ranking in
<EM>Diplomacy</EM>, where
all outcomes save elimination are prefered to survival (the usual result of
losing without elimination). However, if for example player A faces elimination
if he receives some result lower than 3,
{s<SUB><SMALL>12</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>22</SMALL></SUB>, s<SUB><SMALL>34</SMALL></SUB>} is also no longer 
an equilibrium. In this case, player A may choose to cooperate with C (which C
has an incentive to offer since he need only receive a result higher than -3)
to achieve survival over elimination even if this leads to C's victory.

<H4>Conclusion</H4>
This paper attempts little more than analysis of a board game, and even here
only scratches the surface of set of endless puzzles. Yet in the process two
points may have been gained. The first is that complicated situations may be
modeled in useful ways at the risk of oversimplification but with the possible
gain of insight. <EM>Diplomacy</EM> unlike chess, cannot be solved, but there
are
resources - for instance experience, guile, and not least of the ability of
rational calculation - that enable players to play better and occasionally win.
The second point is more a caveat for the first. Rational analysis may be
useful, but it always requires assumptions about preferences and human nature
that may be misapplied or even flat-out wrong. The analyst, whether examining
tic tac toe or the Cuban Missile Crisis, must always tread with caution, and
keep in mind that formal symbols and mathematical arguments are built on
assumptions - which have no more <EM>a priori</EM> claim to truth than other
assumptions.
Assumptions for the purpose of explanation should be made as cautiously as
possible, and should be the first points of reflection when analysis fails to
predict <A HREF="#footnote13"><SUP><SMALL>13</SMALL></SUP></A>,

	The Usenet newsgroup devoted to the <EM>Diplomacy</EM> hobby,
	(<A HREF="news:rec.games.diplomacy">rec.games.diplomacy</A>) has seen
	nearly perpetual debate between those that would have cutthroat (standard)
	preference rankings be the only accepted norm for the play - charging that
	variation from this "spoils" the game - and those that assert that any
	objective that forwards enjoyment of the game is acceptable. Particular
	game masters of play-by-email games have disallowed draws in games where
	a stalemate position had not been achieved. Perhaps the inability to
	analyze others' behavior brought about by this phenomenon is what has
	frustrated the "cutthroats" - it certainly has frustrated this
	analyst/player.

	If actions of the player effects outcomes without interaction with the
	actions of others, Game Theoretical analysis is not applicable. Rather,
	the decisions of a player are analyzable with the more general concepts
	of Rational Choice Theory.

	Playing <EM>Diplomacy</EM> has given me practical experience in this matter.
	On one memorable occasion, after basing my diplomatic efforts and my
	tactical planning on the assumption that one of the other two remaining
	players would prefer to win than draw, and to draw rather than to be
	eliminated, I was eliminated forthright after failing (inexplicably it
	seemed to me at the time) by a two allies who happily enjoyed a draw
	over my dead body when either one could have achieved a full victory
	with stab of the other.
