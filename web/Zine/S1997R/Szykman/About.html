<p>
Welcome to the Spring 1997 Retreat Issue of the Diplomatic Pouch. Once
again I apologize for the  delay in getting the issue out.  This delay
ran even longer than usual.  Due to the oddest coincidence of timing,
both Manus and I started new jobs at almost the same time, he with a
new employer and I with the same one.  And of course, with our
friend Murphy enforcing his laws as best he could, this happened
right when we should have been working on production for this
issue of the zine.  And on top of that, we had an unusually high
number of submissions for a Retreat issue, which is generally
smaller than the Movement issues of the Zine.
<p>
However, we finally did manage to get the issue out, thanks to the aid
of a few people who helped out with HTML formatting of four or five
of the articles (the long ones, at that).  I'd like to thank
Charles E. Carroll, Thomas Kuhlmann, Calvin MacGillivray, and Oliver
Mailes (and my apologies to anyone
else who helped with the formatting that I may not have mentioned --
somebody else was coordinating things before me and since a couple of
things were done by the time I got involved, they may have been done
by somebody other than these gentlemen).
<p>
Sorry for spending so much time on apologies (it's a joke, get it?),
but on to other things...
This issue brings a very nice mix of content.  We've got articles on
variants, a convention report, survey results, a guide to GMing, and
more.  We also bring you new installments a several ongoing serieses
of articles: Vince Mous' Modern series, Joseph Wheeler's "On
Diplomacy" strategy series, "Tarzan" with another article on the Payola
variant, and David Rosen with another article on
game theory.
<p> And aside from the Zine, The Pouch continues to grow.  We are
now hosting the openings list
(thanks to Bjoern Tore Sund for maintaining it as long as he did,
and thanks to Hans de Graaff for picking up the torch by getting it
up and running and taking care of maintenance here at its new home.
The maps and variants pages are by far the most often-updated parts
of The Pouch.  We're nearing 150 maps, and have links to over 85
variants.  We're also making other enancements here and there, such
as letting you do a limited search from the search page of just the
Zine instead of the entire site.  Earlier this month the 200th Game
Queue diplomacy game was started -- an average of more than one per
day since the queues went up.  We're always open to suggestions,
so if there's anything else you'd like to see, let us know.
<p>
Well, enough propaganda.  I'll let you get on to more important
things, like this issue of The Pouch.  I hope it was worth the wait!
