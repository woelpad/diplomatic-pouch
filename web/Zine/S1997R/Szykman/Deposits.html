Welcome to the Spring 1997 Retreat Issue Pouch Deposits.  In the
last issue, I put out a topic of discussion regarding openings.
Specifically, I challenged readers to come up with openings where
two powers ally and gang up on a third to eliminate him as quickly
as possible (you can read additional details in
<a href="../../S1997M/Szykman/About.html">last issue's column</a>).
<p>
I only got one reply, but it was a good one.  I expected a brief
list of moves, but the reply I got included a pretty in-depth
analysis of the moves and the corresponding problems that might
accompany it.  It isn't included
in the Pouch Deposits below because it will appear as a Zine
article in the next issue of the Zine.  Instead of setting forth
a new topic, I'll let the same one stand and hope for a few more
submissions.  I'd like to see what other people come up with, and
I'd also like to come up with one of my own if I have the time
(yeah... right).  Give it a try and email me your thoughts.

Blast from the Past</H3>
<HR>
<H3>From Bill Quinn
(<a href="mailto:wcqdds@mcia.com">wcqdds@mcia.com</a>)</H3>
How pleasant to wander across your zine. Allow me to introduce
myself. I am Bill Quinn, former BNC, former recipient of the Don Miller
Award, former PBM player. Several years ago I lost my zest for the game
and decided that it was better to drop out than play poorly. However at
times I am tempted to play just one more...but I fear that would be like
giving a recovering drunk his first drink in years.
<P>    As BNC I was the dastardly villan who ruled that PBEM games were
"different" from PBM and refused to rate them against the PBM games but
was happy to report them and their players in "EVERYTHING...". At that
time the speed and ease of email and it's rising popularity would
certainly be the death knell of PBM I thought. Surprisingly PBM still
exists. Perhaps email was not the asteroid I believed it to be, sending
the PBM dinosaurs to extinction. There is something about the
handwritten word in the game that adds another dimension. I frequently
consulted with an ameateur handwriting analyst to uncover the true
motives behind the words. I never trusted someone who typed their
letters. It was like playing against a machine, or dealing with someone
who always wore dark or mirrored glasses so that you couldn't see their
eyes.
<P>    In your constellation of PBM players don't leave out Doug Beyerlein
who published, played (one story is that he rallied an abandoned 1 unit
Italy to victory), GM'ed and served as BNC over the course of 15 or so
years. There are others too but his star was brighter to me.
<P>    Good luck in Diplomacy. Watch your back and all that. Perhaps one
day I'll rejoin the hobby. Don't look for me soon.
<P>                            Sincerely,<br>
Bill Quinn

<HR>
<H3>From Brahm Dorst
(<a href="mailto:brahm@mortimer.com">brahm@mortimer.com</a>)</H3>
I read and enjoyed Matthew Self's "Library of Diplomacy Tactics"  and I puzzled long over your question about when the rule that a unit can not cut an order for it's own support, can be used to ones advantage.  Anyway, in Problem
2, part 3, Matthew makes an oversight.  I tried to contact him but his Email address seems to have expired.  The long and the short is that I found a better (or at least alternative solution) to one of his question.  Maybe you can
figure it out.  Here's the challenge:
<p>
Given: France F Mar, F Spa(SC), F MAO, F Port, A Bur, A Gascony<br>
Can you think of a way, that Italy can set up a stalemate line to block France from entering Pied, GoL, Wes, NAf
Using only three fleets and two armies?  (ignore Tyrolia)
<p> <b>[Editor's note: "ignore Tyrolia"
means that one should assume that France is not going to come around Swtizerland
to attack Italy from the North.]</b>
<p>
<b>[Editor's reply: Matt's email account vanished quite a while ago, and we haven't heard
from him since.  Great puzzle!  I've done Brahm one better -- I've come up with two
different solutions to it, one slightly better than the other.  I'm not including them
here so that our readers can give the puzzle a try.  If you
can come up with a solution, email it to Brahm.  The solutions will apear in
the next issue of the Zine.  If you want to read
through the problem from the Tactics Library that Brahm is talking about, you can find it

Spring vs. Fall Stabs</H3>
<HR>
<H3>From Larry Peery
(<a href="mailto:peery@ix.netcom.com">peery@ix.netcom.com</a>) (via rec.games.diplomacy)</H3>
My comment deals with Manus's discussion of stabs in the Spring vs.
stabs in the Fall seasons.  This is really a more complicated question,
I think.  One of the big shocks to all the players at the early WDC's was
the fact that there were two very different schools of thought on
"stabbing."  One group of players, mostly the Brits and Americans, thought
stabs should only come at decisive moments in the game, and then only to
achieve big results.  The other, usually called the Dutch philosophy
(for some early Dutchman who practiced and preached it) was that one
should stab fast and often, even for just one center, or, worse, even
just for the hell of it!  It makes for a very different style of play.
That, combined with the short games often played on the continent, made
Diplomacy a very different game when played in Europe.  Today, most
players have adapted to either style, and a third, so far nameless,
hybrid seems to be coming into vogue.
<p>
<b>[Editor's reply: I've always found players from the
<i>stab-for-little-gain</i> and the <i>stab-for-the-hell-of-it</i> schools a bit
frustrating, because they are generally unpredictable and hard to defend against.
In other words, it's much easier to keep a position where an ally can't stab you
for 3 SC's than it is to keep a position where an ally can't get a single SC from
you.  Furthermore, defending like that is counterproductive since you use all
your forces protecting yourself against an ally, leaving you with nothing to
attack your enemies with.  In my experience, the gains from these stabs are
usually minimal for the stabber, and I've never found them to be worth it when
compared to the big decisive stab.  However, I can see
how that might not be true in the European tournament style where games are
played only to a certain year instead of to completion.  Other opinions are
welcome.]</b>

&gt;&gt;  I know that sometimes you see you are dealing with a complete jerk and<br>

&gt;&gt;  playing and not from disagreements or lack of trust?
<p>
Shlomi is on record as suggesting a Spring 1901 attack on Austria is Italy's
best option in nopress games. The article appeared last fall on the rtdip
mailing list, I believe.
<p>
&gt; Speaking from the perspective of Austria, I have found the following to<br>
&gt; work nicely:<br>
&gt; <br>
&gt; Form an AIR alliance against T, when T is almost gone then you attack I.<br>
&gt; Austria's advantage in this regard is that, while a build in Venice<br>
&gt; usually warns Austria of an impending attack, one in Trieste is more<br>
&gt; subtle.
<p>
But a fleet in Trieste is anything but subtle. Nevertheless, it works very
nicely here. During the late stages of a Lepanto, there will be Italian
fleets in and around Turkey, and one Italian army convoyed there. One fleet,
typically in TyS, and one army, typically in Tus, are left to defend the
homeland. The new fleet moves to Adr, with A Vie moving to Tyr and A Bud
moving to Tri, and Venice will fall in fall. Aeg (or Gre) moves to Ion, with
success leaving Italy's southern forces completely cut off. If TyS is used
to prevent that, Ven-Apu and Adr s Tri-Ven next spring ensures that Rome is
the next victim.
<p>
The recent discussion of Fall versus Spring stabs didn't seem to cover this
frequent occurrence: the Winter stab.
<p>
&gt;                              Needless to say, in a game I once played<br>
&gt; using this strategy, Russia actually stabbed me at the same time as I<br>
&gt; stabbed Italy. <br>
<p>
Heh, such is life.
<p>
As Russia, I would tend to do this when I saw you attacking Italy. I would
know I have an Italian ally, and with Turkey seriously weakened, success
should lead to a breakout into the Med and likely victory. So, as Austria,
you can't stab Italy until Russia is either weakened herself beyond being
able to damage you, or tied up in the north by England and/or Germany (if
he's fighting France, an attack on Italy is likely to produce a French
victory).

I wish to congratulate you on your magnificent job maintaining the Email
section of the Diplomatic Pouch, it is very good and has been very
helpful for getting myself into the PBEM Diplomacy Hobby.  I would also
like to suggest that you increased the choices of the Game Queue to
include other variants of the game, it is dificult to find openings in
most of them and your queue system has worked very nicely for the
Standard and Standard Gunboat games.
Again congratulations on your excellent work.  Keep it up.
Greetings,
Macario Reyes
<p>
<b>[Editor's reply: Thanks for all the positive feedback.  Regarding the
last letter, now that the Game Queues have gotten pretty popular, we
are giving stronger consideration to adding additional games to the queues.
The one issue holding is back is that we don't want to overburden the GMs
who are helping to keep the Game Queue system running smoothly.  We also
need to find out which non-standard variants GMs are interested in GMing
so that we don't end up with queues for games that nobody wants to run.
We'll be working on this.]</b>
