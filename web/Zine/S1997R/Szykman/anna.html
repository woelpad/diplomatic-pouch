<td>In case you missed the <a href="/Zine/S1997M/Szykman/anna.html">explanation
(and photo)</a> in the last issue, it was suggested to me by Larry Peery,
that my daughter might be more fun to look at than me in a photo
accompanying my Zine articles, so I'm putting a new picture of her in
each issue.  If you think I'm cuter than she is (!?!), let me know and I'll
go back to a picture of me.  Anna was born on March 6th, 1996; this photo
was taken in mid-May when she was about 14 months old.
