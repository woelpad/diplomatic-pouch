<P>
I still consider France the hardest power to play in Modern - the number of
eliminations speak for themselves. I managed a 3-way draw as France, in
Dickens, but it was tough and I only had 5 SCs by game's end. No France has
even gotten beyond 20 SCs, though I believe that if one does, they will have
reached critical mass and do very well.
<P>
It's interesting to note that France's fate seems tied to Russia's. Russia won
day2day and will almost surely win aurora, and in both games, France is a
strong second place. Russia also participated in France's other 3-way draw,
despair, in which France had 16 SCs. Ukraine may also have the same effect -
though it hasn't done as well as Russia, it is dominant in details and
frontlin, in which France is also doing quite well. This could be because a
large Russia or Ukraine threaten Germany, Italy and Egypt, giving France much
more room to maneuver.
<P>
French players have used an even wider variety of openings than those playing
Egypt. The clear favorite has been the Helvetic Attack, which has also given
France one of its two 3-way draws and its two top placings in ongoing games.
Still, France has been eliminated 4 times out of 10 using the opening, so it
might be that the success of the opening is simply due to the number of times
it has been used.

You can read about French openings in my previous article on France,
<A HREF="/Zine/F1996M/Mous/Modern.html">The Fifth Republic</A>.
Of those, the Tour de France, the Cheese and Olives, the Basque Offensive,
the Lowlands, Napoleon's Revenge, the Latin Offensive, and William the
Conqueror openings have never been used. Openings not mentioned in the
article are given below.
<H4><A NAME="camembert">Camembert, Atlantic Variant</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
France: Army Marseilles -&gt; Monaco.<BR>
France: Army Paris -&gt; Picardy.<BR>
France: Fleet Bordeaux -&gt; Bay of Biscay.<BR>
France: Army Lyon -&gt; Switzerland.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Bordeaux is moved to the Bay of Biscay instead of remaining in port. Other
than that the opening is the same as the standard Camembert opening.
<H4><A NAME="navarra">Guns of Navarra</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
France: Army Marseilles -&gt; Monaco.<BR>
France: Army Paris -&gt; Picardy.<BR>
France: Fleet Bordeaux -&gt; Navarra.<BR>
France: Army Lyon -&gt; Auvergne.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
France foregoes Switzerland for an early attack on Spain. If cooperating with
Britain, Spain will not be able to get more than one build in 1995, perhaps
none at all. If cards are played right, Germany will take Switzerland and let
France take Belgium instead. This could create peace on France's eastern border
while giving it as many SCs as otherwise would get.
<H4><A NAME="shuffle">Lyon Shuffle</A></H4>

France: Army Paris -&gt; Lyon.  <BR>
France: Fleet Bordeaux -&gt; Bay of Biscay.<BR>
France: Army Lyon -&gt; Switzerland.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
France opens by making sure to take Switzerland unless Italy and Germany
cooperate, while being able to subsequently move to Monaco. The move of Paris
to Lyon rather than Alsace allows France to support Switzerland without
antagonizing Germany.
<H4><A NAME="delight">Diplomat's Delight</A> (by Jeff Serandos)</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
France: Army Marseilles -&gt; Monaco.<BR>
France: Army Paris -&gt; Alsace.<BR>
France: Fleet Bordeaux -&gt; Navarra.  <BR>
France: Army Lyon -&gt; Switzerland.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
France moves to take Switzerland and Monaco, it's two natural neutrals. Paris
moves to Alsace to either threaten Munich, support Switzerland or keep the
German out. Unless it is pre-arranged, the move will almost certainly annoy the
Germans, just as the move to Navarra will annoy the Spanish. In a game with
press, this will certainly lead to a lot of negotiation and a delight for any
diplomat!
<H4><A NAME="midi">Midi Offensive</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
France: Army Marseilles -&gt; Piedmont.<BR>
France: Army Paris -&gt; Lyon.<BR>
France: Fleet Bordeaux -&gt; Navarra.<BR>
France: Army Lyon -&gt; Switzerland.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
France can only get Monaco by moving the army in Piedmont back, but perhaps a
bounce was arranged with Italy and this is an appropriate way of ensuring an
empty Piedmont in the fall, taking Switzerland and making sure to keep it. If
not the move to Piedmont and Navarra is likely to annoy both Spain and Italy,
making France's life quite difficult in the south, or Midi.
<H4><A NAME="olive">Olive Branch</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
France: Army Marseilles -&gt; Monaco.<BR>
France: Army Paris SUPPORT Fleet Bordeaux.<BR>
France: Fleet Bordeaux HOLD.<BR>
France: Army Lyon SUPPORT Spanish Fleet Barcelona -&gt; Switzerland.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
A very peaceful opening - France holds out an olive Branch to all its
neighbours. The only unit that moves is Marseilles towards Monaco. A special
gesture is made towards Spain, which is seen by some as a natural enemy for
France in Modern. With France unable to make a supported attack into
Switzerland in the fall, it will most likely only gain one SC in 1995. Those
olive branches better bear fruit!
<H4><A NAME="zurich">Zurich Alliance</A></H4>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
France seeks a close alliance with Germany against Italy by offering him
Switzerland, likely in exchange for Belgium. Piedmont can go on towards Milan
with German help, but probably better is for Germany to try taking Austria
while France moves Piedmont to take Monaco and Lyon into Piedmont for a
continued attack on Italy in 1996.

"I've read all three of the opening surveys for Modern. I was disappointed at
the name of one French opening, the French Fashion Tour! I would have called it
Diplomat's Delight (or maybe Negotiator's Nightmare) since the first turn moves
to Alsace and Piedmont require lots of diplomacy! I doubt you could consider
this opening in a no-press game."
</CITE><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>- Jeff Serandos</DIV>
<P>
If I had received the suggestion before the article, I might have used it.
Diplomat's Delight is a good anem. As it is, I try using a name from everyone
who contributes one. The opening was named French Fashion Tour by the player
who suggested it, because the units go in many directions - into Italy,
Switzerland and towards Germany, <EM>'exporting French culture and fashion'
</EM>. Myself, I thought it was quite funny! I used your suggestion for another
opening above, in which France moves towards both Germany and Spain ...
