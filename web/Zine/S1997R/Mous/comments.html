<H3><A NAME="general">General Comments About Modern</A></H3>
There have been over 50 Modern games started on the different judges since the
variant appeared in late 1994/early 1995. That is quite a lot, considering that
a typical game lasts over a year. During that time, I have been collecting
comments that players have sent to me about the modern variant. Some have been
in response to the articles I've written; some were sent as comments to the
Modern home page; others still were sent by players in games that I mastered.
Whatever the method, I thought you might be interested in some of the
spontaneous messages I have received.
<P><CITE>
"The two most immediate and obvious differences between the modern variant and
the original game are:<OL>
<LI>There are 10 players instead of 7.
<LI>There are a great deal more supply centers."

First, I received a lot of comments about the size of the variant. Sure,
Youngstown also has 10 powers, but the configuration of powers is very
different. In Youngstown, the standard map has been extended eastwards, while
in Modern, the standard map has been packed with 3 extra powers. The proximity
of powers is therefore greater, and there is more of a crowded feel to the
variant, but with twice the SCs.
<P>
For example, France has all its standard neighbours PLUS Spain. Russia has been
split into three powers - Poland, Ukraine and Russia. Austria-Hungary is now a
battlefield and not a great power, but Turkey is still kept busy with Egypt,
while it faces both Russia and the Ukraine to its north ...
<P>
<CITE>
"10 POWERS! Damn, this is beyond my ability to compute; I feel I am stretching
my brain beyond my grasp."

"With 10 players, you have 9 other random variables to deal with instead of 6,
a 50% increase. This makes diplomacy easier and more difficult at the same
time. On the one hand, having more players makes it more difficult to talk to
everyone. Developing a good diplomatic relationship takes some effort, which
in turn takes time. You always feel the need not to exclude anyone, and yet
there is a limit to how much meaningful discussion Egypt and Britain can have
at the beginning of the game. Also on the bad side is the fact that with more
neighbors, you have more people who may attack you. It is more difficult to
keep a consistent story (assuming you are not being 100% honest in all your
diplomatic negotiations), and also more difficult to please everyone. The only
saving grace to all of this is that all the other players suffer it equally.
<P>
On the good side, having more players allows for well developed alliances to
be formed more easily. Not having every player right in your immediate battle
allows for a period of discussion with far neighbors where information and
comments can be exchanged, such that when it does come time to coordinate
movements and (hate to do it) actually rely on somebody else, you have already
established a good diplomatic relation with them, you feel you know them a bit,
and it becomes easier to trust them.
<P>
Another good thing about having more players is when you really piss somebody
off (either by stab, making an error, or just shooting your mouth off), there
are more players to turn to for possible alliance against that player. I can
remember several alliances where I didn't stab an ally simply because I hated
everyone else on the board."

<H3><A NAME="SCs">The Number of SCs in Modern</A></H3>
As Robert mentioned, another big difference between the Modern variant and the
standard game, is the number of supply centers. There are almost twice as many
centers in Modern as in the standard variant. Even though the variant still
takes place in Europe, this isn't as bad as it sounds as there is a
corresponding increase in non-supply center spaces.
<P>
Actually the ratio of non-supply centers to supply centers in Modern (77/64) is
greater than in standard (33/34). This gives more territory to defend per SC,
and increases the vulnerability of powers, while reducing the chances of
stalemate lines. The sheer number of units also provides many more
possibilities, making it more difficult to predict what will happen.
<P>
Alexander K. Woo disagrees with me:<BR><CITE>
"Well, I'll say it again as I see another endgame. Modern has too many SCs on
the board and therefore it is far too easy to form stalemate lines. I think the
main reason that draws are more rare in Modern is that players know the
stalemate lines less well. Wait until a bunch of people compile stalemate
databases for DipPouch and players get more and more familiar with it. Then, I
think Modern will turn out more drawish than Standard, though not nearly as bad
as Youngstown."</CITE>
<P>
But others agree:<BR><CITE>
"I've found one of the really appealing aspects of the variant is that there
are so many options, and so much more room for making trouble."
</CITE><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>- Matt McLeod</DIV>
<P><CITE>
"Another great strategy article! The more I play Modern, the more I like it.
It is sort of an Advanced Diplomacy in that the strategic considerations are
much deeper and much more varied than in the Standard game."
</CITE><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>- Jeff Serandos</DIV>

"Having more centers also seems to change the game quite a bit, in that
tactical decisions become both more and less important. They are more important
because with more units comes more decisions. You have greater flexibility in
concentrating your units, or spreading them out more. Obviously it is best to
concentrate all your forces on one other player, but with so many neighbors, it
is hard to ever feel secure enough to do so. On the other side, with more
units, a single bad unit move is less damaging. Forgetting to move a unit or
making an unwise decision will have less of an impact when there are 64 units
on the board as opposed to 34."

<H3><A NAME="balance">Comments about Naval and Land Balance in Modern</A></H3>
Alexander K. Woo also sent me an interesting comment about the balance of
the use of armies and navies in Modern:<BR>
<CITE><OL>
<LI>"16 out of 64 SCs are landlocked. This is a higher proportion than the
5/34 in standard. In addition, there are 5 landlocked neutrals,
as opposed to 1. This makes, especially in the opening grab for
neutrals, armies much more important.
<LI>Naval power is more diffuse. There are 4 potential naval powers in
standard. There are 5 or 6 in Modern. This means that 1 or 2 of the
potential naval powers, if it gets lucky, can virtually sit out the
naval war and concentrate on land."
</OL></CITE>
<P>
While it may be true that more SCs are landlocked in modern, there are also
more SCs which are either on islands (Ireland), or can be easily be blocked
against a land-only force. If one tries to take Spain, the Middle-East, Italy
or Egypt from the north with only armies, then one can easily be stopped by but
two units. The same goes for taking Scandinavia from the south. Even capturing
or holding such areas as the Balkans and Germany or Poland is made much easier
with the use of fleets.
<P>
I also believe that access to both seas - the Atlantic and the Mediterranean -
is much more important in Modern than in standard. This access gives a much
greater chance of winning once one has over 20 or so supply centers. This gives
Russia, France, Spain and to a lesser extent, Britain, a good advantage in the
end game - an advantage which has been balanced however by a more problematic
starting position.

Being modest, I saved this part for last ... A series of compliments about
Modern! Keep them coming!

<CITE>"I know I've only played a few moves so far, but I have to tell you this
is far and away the best map I've ever played on. Absolutely ruthless! Are all
Modern games this cutthroat? Thanks again for creating such a fascinating map."
