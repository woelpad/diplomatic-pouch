<P>
Though Britain has not had any wins until now, it is also not the least
successful power in Modern. That title belongs to Germany and Ukraine.
Britain also has a chance of winning in a few games and will surely get more
draws in the near future. An interesting thing is that Britain has never built
in Gibraltar in any of the finished games, but it has managed to do so in at
least 3 games currently being played - gun1994, modsquad and frontlin.
These are 3 of the current games in which Britain is doing best.
<P>
The opening situation for Britain is quit clear-cut, with over 75% of games
using one of the two most popular. The fact that Britain did not use these
openings in any of the 3 games it managed to build in Gibraltar may be telling.

You can read about British openings in my previous article on Britain,
<A HREF="../../S1996M/Mous/Modern2.html">Modern English</A>.
Of those, the Andalusian Defense and the North Sea Fork have yet to be used.
Openings not mentioned in the article are given below.

<H4><A NAME="channelA">Channel Crossing, Atlantic Variant</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Britain: Fleet Liverpool -&gt; North Atlantic Ocean.<BR>
Britain: Fleet Edinburgh -&gt; North Sea.<BR>
Britain: Fleet London -&gt; English Channel.<BR>
Britain: Fleet Gibraltar -&gt; South Atlantic Ocean.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Essentially the same as the Channel Crossing, Irish Variant, discussed in
<A HREF="../../S1996M/Mous/Modern2.html">the original article</A>.
Liverpool moves to the North Atlantic instead of the
Irish Sea. This allows Britain to forego Ireland in 1995 and move to the
Norwegian Sea to put extra pressure on Scandinavia should Russia move to
block Britain from taking Norway.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The IRA attacks and manages to sabotage the British fleet in Liverpool?
Why else would Britain not take Ireland in 1995? In any case, Ireland will
still be British, and though this will slow Britain down, the damage caused
wont be permanent. Maybe Britain can bargain for both Belgium and Norway
since he wont be getting Ireland? Maybe his neighbours will consider him more
fallible and thus less dangerous to ally with?
A good diplomat can turn anything into an advantage.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Britain: Fleet Liverpool -&gt; Irish Sea.<BR>
Britain: Fleet Edinburgh -&gt; North Sea.<BR>
Britain: Fleet London -&gt; English Channel.<BR>
Britain: Fleet Gibraltar HOLD.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Unlike the Spanish Fly, this is a blatant attempt by Britain to keep Gibraltar.
The Channel fleet will almost surely go south the Mid-Atlantic to provide
support. If Spain doesn't move Barcelona to Andalusia, then Gibraltar will
remain British. Britain however will almost surely not be able to build there
in 1995, making the position quite vulnerable in 1996. If Spain does move to
Andalusia however, the Rock will be lost, and Britain wont even get Morocco
as compensation...

<H4><A NAME="fly">Spanish Fly</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Britain: Fleet Liverpool -&gt; Irish Sea.<BR>
Britain: Fleet Edinburgh -&gt; North Sea.<BR>
Britain: Fleet London -&gt; English Channel.<BR>
Britain: Fleet Gibraltar -&gt; Straits of Gibraltar.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<CITE>"An insect, also called blister brittle. When dried and powdered, the
Spanish fly has long been used as blistering agent or irritant, but also as an
aphrodisiac, or love potion".</CITE> - C.H. Curran, Collier's Encyclopedia.
<P>
With the opening move of Gibraltar to the Straits of Gibraltar instead of the
South Atlantic, the British can pursue an alliance with Spain. The moves to the
Channel and the North Sea could well ensure that France cannot take Belgium.
Spain and Britain can then take on France full-force starting in 1996.
<P>
Instead of the love potion, the Spanish Fly opening can be used as an irritant
towards Spain. Straits of Gibraltar could move back to Gibraltar, bouncing a
now trusting Spain and allowing a British build there. The English Channel
fleet, instead of going for Belgium, can also be sent south to the Mid-Atlantic
to help protect Morocco and the South Atlantic, while applying pressure on
Portugal. If the Gibraltar maneuver works and Britain builds a fleet in the
South, Spain will be in real trouble.
