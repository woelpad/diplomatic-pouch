Germany's record is the worst in finished games to date, tied with Ukraine
behind France. Nonetheless, I think Germany has a good position on the board,
and this was just the luck of the draw. If one looks at ongoing games, Germany
is doing well indeed. I wouldn't even be surprised to see 3 German wins in the
near future.
<P>
Even more than France, Germany has seen a large variety of openings. In all
games but one in which Germany has tied or is currently in first place though,
Germany has started off by either attacking Italy (moving Munich to Austria) or
France (moving Munich to Alsace). Does this mean an aggressive Germany has more
chance of success in Modern?

You can read about German openings in my previous article on Germany,
<A HREF="/Zine/W1996A/Mous/Modern.html">The Fourth Reich</A>. Of those,
the Pax Germanica (Coastal V), the Franco-German Accord (Rhine V),
the Atlantic Wall (Danish V), the Keg, the Schleiffen Plan (Coastal V), the
Rhine Charge, the Czech Gambit and Barbarossa openings have never been used.
Openings not mentioned in the article are given below.
<P>
Please note that the Anschluss, Baltic Variant, opening has been removed, as it
is the same opening as the Keg, Baltic Variant. The corrected Anschluss opening
is given below as well.

"A strong push east might be interesting, but doesn't seem to offer many
rewards. It might start with an Anschluss of Austria ... This might alienate
Italy, Poland &amp; Russia, so France &amp; Britain would be good allies."

<P>
Germany moves Frankfurt to Hamburg instead of the Ruhr, enabling her to support
a move into Denmark instead of Belgium. Germany could also take Denmark and
bounce Russia out of Sweden, so this opening is somewhat anti-Russian.

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Germany moves to three neutral spaces that surround it (Heligoland, Bornholm
and Ruhr) as well as one of Switzerland and Austria. This leaves Germany with
many options in the fall. Ruhr can go to either Belgium or Holland, or defend
Munich. Bornholm Sea can move back to Berlin or on to Denmark or Sweden, either
to block Russia, or take it if Russia didn't move towards it. Likewise, Hamburg
can take either Holland or Denmark. A defensive opening which can still allow
Germany to take 4 SCs in 1995.

Germany: Fleet Berlin -&gt; Hamburg.<BR>
Germany: Army Munich -&gt; Austria.  <BR>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -&gt; Denmark.<BR>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -&gt; Saxony.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Germany moves Berlin to Hamburg instead of the Bornholm Sea. This will allow
her to move the fleet on towards Holland rather than launch a supported attack
on Sweden. Russia can still be bounced out of Sweden, so this opening is still
slightly anti-Russian, but less so than the double move to Bornholm Sea and
Denmark of the original Naval Variant.
<P>
<CITE>
"The Split (so-called because of the general movement of units in opposite
directions).<BR>
This pro-French opening is a bit risky. If France opens to Alsacia and
Switzerland, the Fall could see Britain order the North Sea to Holland, and
France order Alsacia to Munich with support from Switzerland, but by
leaving Belgium wide open, Germany hopes France will try for that center
rather than attacking an anti-Italian Germany. The move to Saxony could be
interpreted as hostile by Poland, but since a fleet did not enter the
Bornholm Sea, Poland should not worry. The fleet in Denmark can support Russia
to Sweden in the Fall, setting up an anti-Britain coalition if Russia
makes a strong move north/west with his opening."

<P>
Three German units remain within Germany in the spring of 1995 as Germany opens
neutrally and vies to take Holland and Denmark, while defending itself from a
possible initial Polish attack by moving to Berlin.

Germany: Fleet Berlin -&gt; Hamburg.<BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Germany moves the Hamburg fleet to Denmark instead of Holland ensuring the
capture of Denmark instead of Belgium. Holland is still a sure thing, as Berlin
and Ruhr can support each other in, but Ruhr can be bounced out of Belgium by
either Britain or France.
