<P>
Egypt has had a surprisingly low number of eliminations in Modern. Meanwhile,
it also has one of the best records, only surpassed by Italy and Turkey.
Perhaps this is the power to play for those who want the greatest chance of
playing for into the mid and endgames?
<P>
Unlike Britain, there is a much bigger diversity of openings used for Egypt in
Modern. None is a clear-cut popularity winner among players, though to date the
Sphinx (Naval V) has had the most success. It has produced 3 draws for Egypt
and only one elimination. Time will tell if this was just a fluke or not.

You can read about Egyptian openings in my previous article on Egypt,
<A HREF="/Zine/S1996R/Mous/egypt.html">Alexandria Rises Again</A>.
Of those, the Turkish Offensive, the Sphinx (Desert V), the Pyramid and the
Sea Lion have never been used. Openings not mentioned in the article are
given below.
<H4><A NAME="fortress">Coastal Fortress</A></H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Egypt: Army Aswan -&gt; Eastern Sahara.<BR>
Egypt: Fleet Cairo -&gt; Israel.<BR>
Egypt: Fleet Alexandria HOLD.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This opening defends Egypt's north coast as well as possible while taking
Israel and not threatening Turkey. Meanwhile, unless Italy is foregoes Tunisia,
Egypt will take Libya with the army and be sure of getting two builds.
If Turkey did not open to the Eastern Med, Egypt can launch a supported attack
on it in the fall, or even wait til the following spring, when 3 or 4 of its
fleets will be bordering it.
<P>
The Coastal Fortress can be countered if Turkey opens to the Eastern Med and
supports Israel back to Cairo, or if it moves Adana to Syria and then supports
the Eastern Med fleet to Israel. With Turkey having to worry about Ukraine and
Russia to its north, this is not likely to happen.

"The army does not move west. Why tempt a war with Italy over a center
that does Egypt no good since the unit it provides must attend to its defense?
With any luck, Italy will use the extra center to build an anti-turkish unit.
<P>
All units will begin toward Turkey. This will not result in drawing Turkish
blood unless Ukraine is swooping down from the north, but hopefully Turkey
will be distracted enough to allow Egypt to pick up Saudi Arabia in 1996."

</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Egypt takes Israel, and by moving to Cairo, makes sure it keeps it, while
keeping all its SCs bordering the Eastern Med well defended. If Turkey moves
to the Eastern Med, Egypt can move back to Alexandria from the Libyan Sea or
self-bounce there if Israel is not in danger. Otherwise, Libya can still be
taken, letting Egypt grow to five SCs, while sending the army to Sinai on its
way to Saudi Arabia. Egypt could also try taking the Eastern Med while moving
the army to Israel, though this would probably antagonize Turkey without
gaining any clear advantage.

"I read the stuff concerning Egypt. Only two openings in a no-press game
seem sensible, the Middle-East Defense (Asw-Cai, Ale-Eme, Cai-Red) and the
Turkish Offensive (Asw-Cai, Ale S Cai-Eme, Cai-Eme).
<P>
Basically, if you lose Eastern Med you die. It takes on the same importance as
the English Channel or the Black Sea. Going to Libya is nice but since your
growth has to come at Turkey's expense you have to go to him. I don't like
Cairo-Red, but if it gets to Saudi Arabia, and Iran, then it's not bad.
The supported move into Eastern Med guarantees it to you but also telegraphs
your move. If you go in without support you may get a Turkey who will look
the other way while you slip into Adana."

"One thing that bothers me when reading about Egypt is why no one has talked
anything about the possibility to open F CAI -&gt; ISR!? Is this not allowed
or what? Or is it considered suicide?"
</CITE><DIV ALIGN=RIGHT>- Klas Forsberg</DIV>
<P>
Those openings were not used in the first games and I overlooked them as well.
Both the Jihad and the Sinai Defense described above used the Fleet Cairo to
Israel move. While Egypt was not too successful to date in the games which
used this opening, they seem quite reasonable moves to make.

"I don't know if you are up to modifying old treatises - such as on Egypt
... I have to admit the nation is a favorite of mine ...
<P>
I was just reading the article and noted that it was said:<BR>
Simon Withers notes that "Egypt has to go through Turkey if Egypt is to get
to any SCs" and Stephen Breininger adds: "you know that Egypt and Turkey
will be at war soon enough."
<P>
I find that a long-term Turkish / Egyptian alliance offers strength to both
nations. It requires a weak and divided Italy to make this possible and
expansion via Italy onto the continent and through Spain into the west."
