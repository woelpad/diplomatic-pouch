A Question of Style
</h2>
I'm back this month with a slightly more scholarly (or so I hope) look at
the Great Game.  In fact, this article was originally written as a thesis
of sorts as qualification for a Doctor of Diplomacy award from The
Institute of Diplomatic Studies.  (So now it's Dr. Dipper to all youse
bums...;-)  Anyway, the topic this month is an analysis of the stylistic
differences between Face-to-Face and Play-by-Email Diploamcy.
<P>
I am aware of work by at least one hobby veteran who has visited a related
topic (Jim Burgess, In Search of the Cult of Personality Part 5 -
Play-by-Mail Diplomacy vs. Play-by-Electronic-Mail Diplomacy: Some
Differences in Style and Feel, Diplomacy World #79).  However, my focus
here will be on stylistic differences between Face-to-Face (FTF) Diplomacy
and Play-by-Email (PBEM) Diplomacy.  Moreover, while I am undoubtedly
influenced by my knowledge of the experiences of other players who have
both FTF and PBEM experience, I wish to make it clear that the arguments
and conclusions I make are uniquely personal and based almost entirely on
my own experience, as will be seen through the comments and examples I
cite.  Further, though my experience in PBEM is greater than most, my FTF
experience is more limited.  Yet, at the same time, to the best of my
knowledge, there are few players who have any significant experience of
both areas, at least at the higher echelons of play.  To what extent, if
any, that qualifies me to embark on this thesis, you, gentle reader, will
have to decide.  In any event, I hope to describe and explain a phenomenon
which will speak to all hobbyists.  Nonetheless, caveat lector (let the
reader beware).
<p>
<h3>
DEFINITIONS
</h3>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>Style</b>
<p>
<dd>
What is style?  The American Heritage Dictionary defines style as follows:
<p>
Noun -
<i>
The way in which something is said, done, expressed, or performed: a style
of speech and writing.
</i>
<p>
That seems a quite apt definition, particularly the example noting
differences of speech and writing.  These are the characteristics which are
most directly involved in stylistic differences between FTF and PBEM
Diplomacy.
<p>
<dt>
<b>Face-to-Face</b>
<p>
<dd>
The American Heritage Dictionary defines face-to-face as follows:
<p>
<i>
In each other's presence; in direct communication: spoke face to face.
</i>
<p>
The most important part of the definition is "in each other's presence".
There a number of ways to engage in direct communication through remote
methods but, at present, none of them offer the immediacy and visceral
presence that FTF contact does, nor do any of them require the control over
physical cues and actions necessary to ensure that the medium doesn't
become the message in FTF contact.
<p>
<dt>
<b>Play-by-Email</b>
<p>
<dd>
I can find no handy dictionary definition of play-by-email but, then, I
think we all know what it means, don't we?    Well, perhaps we do but I
think it best if we be specific.  The best way to do that is to break the
phrase down into its constituent parts.  Thus, mail is defined as
<p>
Noun -
<i>
Materials, such as letters, handled in a postal system.
</i>
<p>
Electronic mail further refines the definition:
<p>
Noun -
<i>
Mail delivered by use of a computer network in electronic form, i.e. not
physical, and usually characterized by rapid, near instantaneous delivery.
</i>
<p>
Thus, PBEM could reasonably be defined as:
<p>
<i>
Use of an electronic mail system to exchange text-only messages in the
conduct of a game.
</i>
<p>
</dl>
<h3>
DIFFERENCES TO CONSIDER
</h3>
Now that we've defined our  terms, we need to outline the important
differences that follow by virtue of the specific characteristics unique to
FTF and PBEM Diplomacy.
<p>
<h3>
Face-to-Face
</h3>
The significant characteristics of FTF communication are as follows:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>- Communication is uncensored and interactive</b>
<dd>
While thoughtful consideration prior to communication is certainly possible
it is not practical to routinely anticipate all of the potential, or even
likely, responses or reactions you may encounter when diploming.  As a
result, you are frequently required to "wing it", formulating plans,
answering queries, and lying outright without opportunity to fully prepare.
The duplex (2-way simultaneously) nature of the communication ensures that
your opponent will have ample opportunity to interact with your comments
and responses as you are making them, further limiting your ability to
present a fully prepared, duly considered presence.
<p>
<dt>
<b>- Communication is immediate</b>
<dd>
No matter how prepared you may be, you will still have to follow through on
your plans.  There's considerable difference between planning on lying to
an ally, for example, and actually doing so successfully.  It's much more difficult to
overcome our cultural conditioning against lying when doing so in-person than it is to
do so in a carefully crafted letter.
<p>
<dt>
<b>- The medium can become the message</b>
<dd>
Every aspect of your physical presence communicates something to your
opponent.  Your body language, tone of voice (anger, frustration, doubt, etc.), and
speech characteristics (hesitation, repetition, etc.) all play a part.  Additionally,
when communicating in-person, you have the opportunity to draw physical connections between
your speech and playing aids, i.e. maps.
<p>
</dl>
<h3>
Play-by-Email
</h3>
The significant characteristics of PBEM communication are as follows:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>- Communication is rapid but not immediate</b>
<dd>
Even in situations where both players are sitting by waiting for an incoming message and
then respond forthwith, there is no opportunity for one player to observe the reaction of
another.  Nor is there any opportunity to speak or act in a way which will elicit an
unconsidered response from another player.
<p>
<dt>
<b>- Communication is censored and considered</b>
<dd>
While email communication is interactive in that players exchange multiple
messages on the same topic, it is simplex (1-way at a time) and it is not real-time.
This allows for an opportunity to consider and reject any number of potential plans
and responses at leisure before deciding on the ultimate action.
<p>
<dt>
<b>- Communication lacks depth</b>
<dd>
Written communication has no body language, tone of voice, or speech characteristics
to convey subtle meaning.  The analogues that do exist tend to be manufactured (smileys
or emoticons, for example) or more prone to misinterpretation.
<p>
</dl>
You may have noted that I've described most of the characteristics of PBEM
Diplomacy in terms of a lack of something; lack of immediacy, lack of
subtlety, etc. The overriding factor in PBEM communication is that it is
written text only.  By virtue of this fact, it is inherently more limiting
than the richer, more varied FTF communication.  This is not to say that
detailed, subtle communication is not possible via email but, rather, that
is much more difficult to achieve.    Moreover, for the most part, it is
extremely difficult to form the subtle impressions of intent and character
in an email message than it is via a FTF conversation.
<p>
<h3>
EXAMPLES
</h3>
<h3>
Face-to-Face
</h3>
<p>
I played in the FTF Colonial variant championship at WDC VI.  In my game,
as Holland, I established an early non-aggression pact with Japan (which I
didn't violate until he couldn't do anything about it) and a strong
alliance with France.  At the same time, I laid the groundwork for an
alliance with Britain, since I didn't know how things would work out with
France and Japan.  As the game progressed, however, I consistently lied to
Britain, never once following through on my promises, though I didn't
actively attack him.  Nonetheless, he continued to work with me well past
the point where I was in position to make a direct stab, which I ultimately
did with great success.
<p>
Now, you might write this off as the actions of an inept player but, in
fact, this player was reasonably skilled and did well in the overall
tournament.  So, why then did he continue to trust me and let me set him up
for a stab?  I discussed this with him after the game.  He said that there
were two factors that lead him to continue to trust me.  One, he was in a
tough spot on all fronts; Turkey was bumbling about and acting threatening,
France was overtly hostile, and China and Russia were preoccupied with each
other.  As a result, he was receptive to any friendly overtures.  Two, even
after I had failed to meet my commitments several times, I had not actively
attacked him.  Moreover, I almost always spoke to him first after each turn
processed, I was frequently up front about my inability or unwillingness to
take actions he desired, even when this might gain his enmity, I always had
a reasonable excuse for my apparently unfriendly actions, and I always had
ready answers to his hard questions, even if those answers weren't always
to his taste.  As a result, even though he recognized the precarious nature
of his position, he felt that I was his best chance.
<p>
The key aspects of FTF play that worked to my advantage here were:
<dl>
<dt>
<b>- Immediacy of the communication</b>
<dd>
He didn't have time to stew over my unfriendly actions because I was alway's
pulling him aside to explain them and plan for the future with him.
<p>
<dt>
<b>- Use of physical presence</b>
<dd>
I was able to "read" him fairly well and I could tell when he was upset or
unsure.  I used all my diplomatic skills and charm to allay his concerns
and put his mind at ease.  This required good plans and reactions, of
course, but, most importantly, it required the opportunity and ability to
see and feel how he was reacting, something that is rarely possible in PBEM.
<p>
<dt>
<b>- The medium can become the message</b>
<dd>
In my profession (I'm a private investigator and security consultant), I am
frequently required to dissemble and act.  Whether engaged in an undercover
investigation or interviewing a potential suspect, it is important that I
successfully play a role and, when necessary, mislead or just plain lie to
one or more of the parties involved.  As a result of this experience and my
own innate ability (he said immodestly), I'm quite good at it.  Therefore,
it's relatively easy for me to do the same in a game of Diplomacy  (exactly
how is a topic for another thesis).  The British player in this game said
he never had any idea when I was lying and when I was telling the truth.
This ability is much, much easier to exercise face-to-face.
</dl>
<p>
<h3>
Play-by-Email
</h3>
I recently completed a PBEM game for experienced players where the
difficulties of PBEM communication (or my inability to overcome them)
significantly hampered my ability to take advantage of a significant
strategic opportunity and, ultimately, cost me a shot at a solo victory.
<p>
In a nutshell, I formed an early alliance with England and we all but
eliminated Germany by 1903.  At the same time, Austria and Russia went
after Turkey, while Italy just sort of tooled around in the Mediterranean.
Shortly thereafter, however, Russia stabbed Austria with Italy's help.
Italy was convinced that I was friendly and had thrown everything he had to
the east, including sending his two fleets towards Turkey in order to get
in on the action there.
<p>
The situation that developed was that England and I were in need of
selecting new targets.  I wanted to send most of my forces southeast
towards Italy and I asked England to go northeast after Russia.  At the
same time, we would both move east through Germany and see what happened.
England agreed in principle but then got hung up on the disposition of
Brest (he wanted a commitment that I wouldn't build there at all) and
Belgium (he wanted me to move my army in Belgium east and leave it vacant
thereafter).  I wasn't happy about the request not to build in Brest but I
said I would consider it if he wouldn't build in London.  I also said I
would happily vacate Belgium if he would vacate Holland or the North Sea.
<p>
It was all down hill from there, believe me.  We went through a number of
counter-proposals, none of which were acceptable to both of us.  More
importantly, the whole process of trying to decide these issues put a
serious strain on our relationship and, ultimately, lead to the dissolution
of the EF alliance.  In the long run, the game ended in an EFIR draw.
<p>
At the time all this was happening, I didn't know the identity of the
English player because it was a gunboat game.  After the game ended, I saw
who it was and, since I knew him, I gave him a call to discuss what had
happened.  It turns out that both of us were, in fact, seriously committed
to the EF alliance at the time.  Moreover, while both of us would have
happily taken a gift solo, we both were willing to play for a 2-way or
3-way draw.  It hadn't happened because we both had misinterpreted each
other's intentions and goals expressed through our email.  Had either of us
been able to better express our goals, recognize the level of distress
caused to the other before it was too late, and put the other at ease, we
might well have ended in a 2-way EF draw.
<p>
The key aspects of PBEM play that worked to my disadvantage here were:
<p>
<dl>
<dt>
<b>- Communication is rapid but not immediate</b>
<dd>
I had no opportunity to discern his real intentions through direct observation.
<p>
<dt>
<b>- Communication is censored and considered</b>
<dd>
While this can often be a good thing, in this case it worked against us.
We both gave a great deal of thought to our replies, offering detailed
plans and suggestions.  The end result was an overwhelming amount of detail
presented in a somewhat lifeless manner.
<p>
<dt>
<b>- Communication lacks depth</b>
<dd>
This was the real crux.  If either of us could have simply seen the other
and experienced the manner and intent in which the plans were being
offered, we would have immediately understood that they were not really
threatening.  We could have then hammered out a workable plan and moved on
to other goals.
</dl>
<p>
<h3>
SUMMARY
</h3>
While it is not possible to draw a final conclusion regarding the merits
between FTF and PBEM Diplomacy due to the differences in ability and
temperament from player to player, it is possible to draw two important
conclusions.
<p>
One, FTF offers a broader spectrum of communication opportunities.
<p>
Two, PBEM offers a greater opportunity for more thoughtful, considered action.
<p>
Which style is preferable will depend your own strengths and weaknesses.
For me, there's no question - FTF is my forte.  However, advances in
electronic communications will likely complicate the issue even further.
What will be the effects of videoconferencing or virtual reality modes of
play on Diplomacy?  Will these pseudo-FTF methods offer the benefits of
real FTF?  What disadvantages will they have?  At present, I have no idea
but, if they become readily available, I'll be playing them and another
article on the topic won't be far behind.
<p>
In the meantime, I'll leave you with these thoughts on style.  Take what
meaning you can find.
