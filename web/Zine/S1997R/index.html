<i>Dean A. Gordon:</i>
<A HREF="Gordon/GMguide.html">In Control - The Penultimate Guide 
to Being a GM</a></b><dd>
My pet project down the tubes, because Dean beat me to it.  Here's
a guide for aspiring GMs to help get them started with all the GMing
basics.  Penultimate, eh?  That means second-to-last, so maybe there's
still room for one more GM guide.

<A HREF="Peery/Emotions.html">Results of the Diplomacy Emotions Survey</a></b><dd>
From <i>lovestruck</i> to <i>suspicious</i>, here are the results of the 
Diplomacy Emotions Survey that was circulated through the PBM and PBEM 
Diplomacy communities.  Hint: if you've ever been lovestruck while playing
Diplomacy, you're in the minority.  Kinda hard to fall in love when there's
a knife in your back (not to mention the dearth of women in the hobby).

<i>Larry Peery:</i>
<A HREF="Peery/wdcVII.html">World DipCon VII Report</a></b><dd>

<A HREF="Rosen/dippap2.html">Diplomacy and Game Theory Part 2:
Rational Choice</a></b><dd>
If you've never thought about Diplomacy in the context of game
theory, here's a good start for you.  My only question is: how
can I find some of those rational people to play with?

nice family game we all know and love.

<i>"Tarzan":</i>
<A HREF="Tarzan/new_interview.html">An Interview with Manus Hand</a></b><dd>
Diplomacy Legend Manus Hand (I had to say that or he'd fire me) revealed!
Sorry, if you're looking for nudie pix, you're in the wrong place...
we charge for those.  But if you've never had the opportunity to get
to know Manus, here's a way for you to begin.
