Holmes looked up from his armchair at me.  I was engaged in a heated
discussion across the room with his dear brother, Mycroft.
Holmes took his pipe out of his mouth, put it back, and returned to his reading.
<P>
I was visibly upset.  "Confound this NMR rule, Mycroft! A chap misses
a single deadline and he's eliminated -- in 1901 to boot!  Look at this."
<p>
Pulling the battered Diplomacy set from the bookcase, I set up
the pieces in their familiar starting configuration. I then wrote out 
a set of orders, saying "A reasonable enough opening, eh?"
"Now I think of it, weren't you at the Calhamer Club that night, Mycroft?"
<P>
Mycroft peered at my scrawl.  "Indeed I was!
I believe you requested my advice regarding
the opening moves on this occasion,
as I was playing the same power as you were in another room.  It looks
that from the offers you have written, evidently you took that advice."
<P>
"Yes, and a lot of good it did me!" I growled.  "Here are the
other orders."
<P>
Mycroft waited as I pushed pieces
around the board, and then exclaimed, "Remarkable!  The identical openings
for all the other powers occurred in my game as well.  This situation
requires urgent negotiations, Watson.  You need only make your
neighbours aware of the logic of the position and an excellent Fall
awaits you".
<P>
"Perhaps," said I, "but you'll recall that that very night we were
called urgently away to that business on Dartmoor.
When we returned to the Club the Fall moves had already processed: in our
absence that infernal NMR rule was enforced. All
my units had been ordered to hold while all the other powers' units had
moved out of their home countries. The other powers had
each taken two neutral centres and four of them had invaded me! 
My 1901 elimination was unavoidable. That has never happened to me before,
and it is in no small measure due to your foolish opening." 
<P>
"A sorry tale, Watson, but you really should look to your negotiations
for blame rather than to the opening I suggested:  I also missed the fall
deadline and had my forces declared
in civil disorder.  Before I left I took some elementary 
precautions.  As a result of skillful diplomacy on my part, the Fall moves
in my game were considerably different from those in yours.  On our return,
I found myself in a position to capture three new centres in 1901."
<P>
"Well, Mycroft," I complained, "I definitely could have used those additional
supply centres after seeing the Russian-English alliance that showed itself
when England supported the Russians into Kiel and Holland in Spring of 1902."
<P>
At this point, Holmes again looked up from his book.  "You know, Watson,"
he began, "Mycroft is quite right.  Had you negotiated arrangements for
different Fall moves from the other powers as he did, you would have been
in a much more favorable position."
<p>
"Holmes!" I exclaimed, "I hardly think you are in any position to
comment on either your brother's openings or my negotiations.  You have
been sitting at the other end of the room reading; you don't even know
which power we played, let alone what our opening moves were!"
<p>
"On the contrary, dear Watson.  Not only do I know the power you played
<i>and</i> your opening moves, I can even tell you what your board looked
like at the end of 1901."  Holmes nodded to his brother, smiled at the
both of us, and drew on his pipe as he returned to his book.
