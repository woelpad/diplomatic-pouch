 FELLOW GMs)</B></I></A></P>
<B><I><P>&nbsp;</P>
</I><P>INTRODUCTION</P>
</B><P>This is the penultimate guide to being a GM - gamesmaster -
 because there will always be somebody brighter with better ideas to come
 along and make this guide look like the scribbling of a raving lunatic.</P>
<P>Why a guide to being a GM? Well, for a couple reasons. First and foremost
 is that when I first started being a GM a year ago, the resources available
 were hard to understand and tough to follow. The only guide to being a GM
 was written by Daniel Loeb in 1991, and while an excellent resource, it
 does not cover a lot of Judge specific items.</P>
<P>What this guide will do is set up an actual game, step by step, allowing
 potential GMs to see just how easy it is to set up a game, and then
 pre-empt any questions that may arise along the way.</P>
<P>Many thanks should go out to those cool GM dudes at <A
 HREF="mailto:rcchat@uib.no">RCCHAT</A> and my fellow GMs who volunteered
 to proofread the drafts. Without their suggestions, guidance and knowledge
 this guide would not have been possible. </P>
<P>Of course special mention should go to my dog Skippy.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="s1">BECOMING A GM</A></P>
</B><P>Why do you want to be a GM? If your answer is to help out the
 Diplomacy community, then you be a winner. Without people wanting to be GMs
 there would be no games for people to play. </P>
<P>With that in mind it must be noted that GMing is not for everyone. The
 best advice is to try one game and if you like it and feel comfortable then
 try another. Is there a limit as to how many games a person can GM? Yes,
 but we are all different. To some GMing three or four games is too many or
 just right while to others it is a walk in the park on a midsummer's day.
 You know yourself better than anyone - give yourself a realistic limit as
 to how many games you can GM not only based on your present situation, but
 also for the next six months.</P>
<P>If you find that being a GM fulfills a nurturing side of you that you
 were unaware of, by all means go ahead and create some more. A word of
 advice is to spread your games around to different judges. That way, if a
 judge crashes your headaches are limited to only one game or a handful
 rather than all of your games.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>WHAT'S A GOOD GM?</P>
</B><P>There is a plethora of opinions as to what constitutes a "good" GM.
 Some prefer activist GMs who monitor the game closely, prompting late
 players and answering all questions put to them and in short guiding the
 game like a protective mother. Other GMs take a more detached view to the
 game, setting them up and making sure they run all right, but generally not
 prompting players and the like. Some GMs are quite strict about language
 use and decorum while others run games that would make a bartender
 blush.</P>
<P>Perhaps the simplest answer is that a good GM is one who is fully versed
 in all the rules and can answer and help out his players when they have
 non-strategic problems.</P>
<P>The best way to find out what kind of GM you want to be is to think back
 to a game you played where the GM did a good job in your opinion. Use that
 as a template to finding your own style. The only advice I could give in
 this regard is to be flexible enough to change and grow as a GM.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>WHO OWNS THE GAME?</P>
</B><P>The most important question you have to ask yourself as a GM is who
 owns the game? Whose priorities should be placed first and foremost, the
 players or the GM? I believe that a game belongs to the players and that I
 am there merely to help them play a game. If I can stand on my soapbox for
 a second, as a GM and as a player, I would prefer that you choose a
 different avenue than Diplomacy if you have to work out any delusions of
 grandeur or aspirations to Godhood.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>GM RESOURCES </P>
</B><P>If you have any questions as a new GM, ask a GM in one of your games
 or one that you respect. In most cases, they are more than happy to pass
 down accumulated years of wisdom. Another good idea is to subscribe to a GM
 discussion group. The only current one that I am aware of at the moment is
 <A HREF="mailto:rcchat@uib.no">RCCHAT</A> at rcchat@uib.no. To subscribe,
 send a message to <A HREF="mailto:majordomo@uib.no">majordomo@uib.no</A>
 with text of "subscribe rcchat". All subsequent correspondence is then sent
 to <A HREF="mailto:rcchat@uib.no">rcchat@uib.no</A> as regular email. The
 group is diverse enough to have a wide range of opinions, allowing you as
 the new GM to find what is right for you. Chances are that your fellow GMs
 have solved any problem you have. They are your greatest strength and
 resource.</P>
<P>There are a few non-human resources you'll need as well. The most
 important are the EP House Rules and the Rules Exceptions and
 Interpretations. They are as sacrosanct as anything handed down from The
 Mount. You will also need the Command Index, a comprehensive guide to all
 the commands accepted by the judge. As a GM, your players will most likely
 ask you technical questions. The files Help Information, Syntax for Orders,
 Press, Deadlines and Draws should be handy to refer to them when a player
 asks you what the syntax for retreating is or how to setup an account.</P>
<P>All these files can be retrieved from the judge using the GET command (GET
DRAWS, GET DEADLINES, etc) or can be downloaded from the <A
 HREF="/DipPouch">Diplomatic Pouch</A> at
 http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch. In fact, a good strategy is to
 bookmark the site, as you will be referring to it often in the course of
 your GM life. Players will ask you how to register, where to get maps,
 strategy advice and a million other questions, all of which can be answered
 at the Dip Pouch.</P>
<P>Note1: as mentioned, <A HREF="mailto:rcchat@uib.no">RCCHAT</A> is the
 only current GM discussions group that I am aware of. There is the
 GMS-Mailing List at <A HREF="mailto:gms@diplom.org">gms@diplom.org</A> but it
 is not active.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693113">RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE GM</A></P>
</B><P>The EP House Rules lists three main responsibilities of the GM. They
 are important enough to repeat here. Consider them carved in stone. They
 should never, ever be broken.</P>
<OL>

<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><LI>GMs are to remain scrupulously impartial in
 all matters</LI>
<LI>GMs should not change the parameters of the game after players start
 signing up for the game unless the players unanimously vote to do so. This
 includes changing the deadline calculation, victory conditions, press
 flags, etc.</LI>
<LI>GMs may not play in their own game.</LI></OL>

</B><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><B><P><A NAME="S">STEP 1 - CREATING A
 GAME</A></P>
<P><A NAME="_Toc388693115">FINDING A JUDGE</A></P>
</B><P>Lots of judges to choose from. Mail the JudgeKeeper - JK - a note
 asking him if its all right to set up a game on his judge. In most cases
 they will say sure, but it is still polite to ask first. If you are unsure
 of what judge to use, a list of all the judges is available at the <A
 HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/registration.html">Dip
 Pouch</A> at http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/registration.html.</P>
<P>In setting up your first game, a good strategy is to find a game that you
 liked as a player and reproduce it. Get a listing of the game and reproduce
 the game using the format that I've outlined below. This is how I setup
 my first game as a GM.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693116">OVERVIEW</A></P>
</B><P>Let's setup a game called Express1 on the USIN judge. When we are
 done the game will look like this:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>: Judge: USIN Game: Express1 Variant: Standard Gunboat<BR>
: Deadline: S1901M Wed Dec 31 1969 18:00:00 CST <BR>
Game 'express1' hasn't started up yet.<BR>
You'll be notified when 1 more people sign on.<BR>
Game 'express1' is waiting for 1 more player to sign on.<BR>
The parameters for 'express1' are as follows:<BR>
Move clock 1410 min 12.00 next 72.00 grace 48.00 delay 0.50 days -mTWTF-<BR>
Retreat clock -1 min 0.00 next 23.00 grace 48.00 delay 0.50 days -mTWTF-<BR>
Adjust clock -1 min 0.00 next 23.00 grace 48.00 delay 0.50 days -mTWTF-<BR>
Access: Different-site, Level: Any, Moderated, Dedication: 100.<BR>
Variant: Standard, Gunboat.<BR>
Flags: NoNMR, NoProxy, DIAS.<BR>
Press: Grey, No Partial (except to Master).<BR>
Winning Centers: 18.<BR>
Index: 0 <BR>
This game is a 72hour grey press no partial standard gunboat game for<BR>
experienced players. It will be interesting to see if experienced
 players<BR>
can coerce, manipulate and otherwise control and dominate other
 experienced<BR>
players the way they do some hapless newbie. The dedication floor is set
 at<BR>
100 but can be lowered upon request.<BR>
If this were a newbie game there'd be rules aplenty here. It's not so
 the<BR>
only rules are common sense and courtesy. I plan to be as invisible as
 possible.<BR>

<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693117">GAME CREATION</A> </P>
</B><P>Let's go line-by-line as to how the game Express1 was setup.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>create ?express1 password standard gunboat<BR>
become master<BR>
set nolist</P>
</B></FONT><P>The first line in the game creation is the command line and
 lists the game title, your password and the variant info of the game. There
 are a lot of variants to choose from, so choose a variant you are familiar
 with. </P>
<P>REMEMBER YOUR PASSWORD. If you forget your password you will have to
 write the JK and sheepishly ask him to send it to you. </P>
<P>When you create a game you have to include the ? at the front of the game
 name, much like signing on, as you have not become the master of the game
 yet. On the second line you become the master of the game. The third line 
 SET NOLIST is important as it keeps the game off of the openings list
 until you are finished setting it up. </P>
<P>Note 1: Remember to SET LIST after you are finished setting the game up
 and the judge has confirmed the game creation. </P>
<P>Note 2: Changing your password as a GM is the same as changing it as a
 player. </P>
<P>Note 3: You can change the variant of the game but you can only do so
 BEFORE the powers have been assigned and the requisite number of players
 for the new variant type have signed on by using the command SET VARIANT
 [variant and options]. For example, you can change a Modern game (10
 players) to a Standard Game if an eighth player has not yet signed on.</P>
<P>Note 4: If you hate the game that you have setup and wish to terminate it
 before players signon, send the JK a note asking him to kill the game. DO
 NOT send the command TERMINATE or RESIGN. Note that any parameter including
 the variant info can be changed prior to game start.</P>
<P>Note 5: When naming the game try to avoid using common names or
 Dip-related expressions. Having ten games named "Gandalf" or "Express" is
 just silly and complicated.</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693118"></P>
<P>GLOBAL GAME SETTINGS</A></P>
</B><P>The next commands we are going to setup are the global game
 parameters.</P>
<P>Note1: The descriptions of each command can be also read in the MASTER
 Command Index or the Command INDEX.</P>
<P>Note2: Many of the commands listed below do not need to be sent (you will
 see a "This is the default setting"). I have included them in setting up
 Epress2 for the sake of showing you all the possible options when setting
 up a game.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set noproxy<BR>
</B></FONT>This command sets or clears the flag which allows one player to
 give control of one or more of his units to another player. This is the
 default setting.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set nonmr<BR>
</B></FONT>No orders can be processed unless all powers have submitted
 complete and error free orders. This is the default setting.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set dias<BR>
</B></FONT>Enables the requirement that any Draws must Include All
 Survivors. This is the default setting</P>
<P>Note: All three of these commands can be also set PROXY, NMR and NODIAS,
 but since we are setting up Express1, they are set to NOPROXY, NONMR and
 DIAS. A lot of players refuse to play NMR games as they are ineligible for
 HOF points and statistical comparisons, so I prefer as a GM to set all my
 games as NONMR.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set moderate<BR>
</B></FONT>Tells the judge that yes, you will be GMing this game. This flag
 is set automatically when you send the become master command.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set reveal<BR>
</B></FONT>By setting this the player list will be revealed in the summary
 listing after the game is over. SET NOREVEAL is useful in tournament
 situations where players are in multiple games and who played which power
 should not be revealed until all games are over. REVEAL is the default
 setting.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set centers 18<BR>
</B></FONT>This sets the number of centers required to win the game. This
 flag defaults to the standard number of winning centers for the
 variation.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set dedication 100<BR>
</B></FONT>Restricts access to the game to those players who have a
 dedication level above the dedication level you have set as the floor.
 Note: the level you set can not be higher than your own. You may get player
 requests asking to be let into the game but their dedication level is too
 low. If you decide to take pity on these poor unfortunate wretches, you can
 lower the dedication floor by sending the SET DEDICATION command. After
 everyone is signed on you can raise it back. The default is -10.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set level any<BR>
</B></FONT>This restricts access to the game to a particular level of
 player. When registering for a judge you are asked to choose a level that
 you think you are at - novice, amateur (allows novice or intermediate),
 intermediate, advanced (allows intermediate or advanced) or expert. As of
 this writing there is no deity or god level yet. Setting the level any
 means that any player - hence the term "any" - can play in this game.
 This usually ensures a good mix of veteran players and victims, er,
 rookies. Players can change their classification by <A
 HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/registration.html">re-registeri
ng with the judge</A> at
 http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/registration.html. The default setting
 is any.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set access different<BR>
</B></FONT>This is the default setting on the judge. You could also have set
 it ANY or SAME.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693119">PRESS SETTINGS</A></P>
</B><P>Make sure you have read and fully understand the judge file PRESS. It
 will explain in detail all the myriad press options available to you as a
 GM. Best advice is to pick those options which you as a player liked the
 most and recreate them. For Express1 the options I chose were:</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set press grey no partial<BR>
set nofake</P>
</B></FONT><P>Note: I could have also included the line SET ALL PRESS which
 allows me to read all partial press in the game. The default setting for
 the GM is normal press, meaning that only game results, press sent to the
 GM and broadcast press is sent to you. Setting the game all press is a good
 way of seeing strategy from another's point of view and an excellent way
 to improve as a player. Why did I not set all press for Express1? Good
 question. At the time I was really, really busy as a player and life kept
 intruding on my fun.</P>
<P>Note2: To turn ALL PRESS off, send the command SET NORMAL PRESS. Do not
 send SET NO PRESS as that will turn off all the press in a game.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693120">DEADLINE SETTINGS</A></P>
</B><P>Make sure you have read and fully understand the judge file
 DEADLINES.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set moves next 72.0 grace 48.0 delay 0.5 days
 -mTWTF-<BR>
set retreat next 23.0 grace 48.0 delay 0.5 days -mTWTF-<BR>
set adjust next 23.0 grace 48.0 delay 0.5 days -mTWTF-</P>
</B></FONT><P>Moves controls the deadlines regarding movements phases,
 retreats for retreats phases and adjust for adjustment phases. Next
 controls the time between moves, grace controls the grace and delay refers
 to the minimum time between the last error-free and complete move being
 submitted and the judge processing the moves - the default is 0.5, which
 is half an hour (30 minutes). </P>
<P>Days controls which days of the week deadlines will fall on. A dash [-]
 gives the command that no deadlines will occur on that day. A lower case
 letter [m] gives the command that deadlines will not happen before noon on
 that day. </P>
<P>When setting your grace periods take into account that judge outages do
 occur. No bigger headache for both the GM and the JK than having to deal
 with five abandonments because the judge crashed and your game only had
 24hour grace periods. Making your grace periods 48hours or even 72hours
 will eliminate this headache in case of short judge outages.</P>
<P>Another parameter GMs can control is what time a deadline will be set,
 represented in minutes past midnight. The default is 1410, which is 11:30pm
 LOCAL JUDGE TIME. Retreats and adjustments have a default time setting of
 -1 which means that deadlines can fall at any time. To change the time
 deadlines fall on the command CLOCK is used: SET MOVES CLOCK 600 for
 example sets a deadline of 10am.</P>
<P>As setup, Express1 is a 72hour game with a 48hour grace, weekday
 deadlines only.</P>
<P>Note: In setting up deadlines for your game, use the deadlines in your
 favorite game as a player and substitute them in. Sometimes you will notice
 that deadlines are set to one hour less than a full day, i.e., 23, 47 or
 71hours. The reasoning for this is that the delay parameter and other
 normal judge delays may cause the move to be processed a little after the
 deadline. If this happens, the deadline may actually be one extra day due
 to the CLOCK parameter.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693122">COMMENT SETTINGS</A></P>
</B><P>These commands control what a player will see when the game is
 listed. </P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>SET COMMENT </B>This is a 72hour GP-NP

</B></FONT>This command will set the comment that appears in the brief
 listing. Anything after the SET COMMENT up to 60 characters will be
 included. The command is terminated by pressing [RET].</P>

 is the last command you send.</P>
<P>Note: Use the Comment section to list your house-rule or any special
 information that prospective players should know. It will avoid problems
 that will occur later on.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693123">A NOTE ABOUT HALL OF FAME
 ELIGIBILITY</A></P>
</B><P>A lot of gamers like playing games that will be eligible for Hall Of
 Fame points. Some don't care about the HOF at all. A good strategy for a
 first game, as you are an unknown as a rookie GM, is to make your games
 appeal to the widest possible audience. I try to ensure that all my games
 are HOF eligible. There are many conditions that cause games to be
 ineligible for HOF points. Letting Jeff and his Mom play in the same game
 or playing in your own game will cause <A
 HREF="mailto:nfitz@sentex.ca">Nick Fitzpatrick</A> the HOF Keeper to punt
 the game. The most common reasons for game ineligibility are NMR games,
 games with one player playing multiple powers and same-site or any-site
 games where many of the players are from the same location. More
 information about the HOF and HOF eligibility is available at <A
 HREF="http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/HoF/">http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/HoF/.
</A></P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="S2">STEP 2 - GETTING
 PLAYERS</A></P>
<P><A NAME="_Toc388693125">LISTING THE GAME</A></P>
</B><P>When you are happy with the game you have set up, send it off to the
 judge. Wait a bit and then the judge will send you confirmation that the
 game has been created. Check over all the parameters of the game carefully
 - a good way to do this is to LIST the game. If you are not satisfied
 with something change it. If you are satisfied and everything is
 hunky-dory, send the command SET LIST and wait for players to signon to
 your game.</P>
<P>Congratulations! You have just setup your first game as a GM.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693126">THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH GAME QUEUE</A></P>
</B><P>Sometimes a game does not fill up as fast as you want. There are two
 great resources for prospective GMs to troll for players. First is posting
 a message at the rec.games.diplomacy newsgroup. A much better way to get
 players is to go to the <A HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/DP-cgi/setqueue">DP
 Game Queue</A> at http://devel.diplom.org/DP-cgi/setqueue. There you can
 request as many names of players who want to get in a game as you think you
 will need to fill your game.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>MASTERING FROM THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH GAME QUEUE</P>
</B><P>Rather than creating a game from scratch there is a way to jump into
 the GMing word without too much fuss and muss. Access the <A
 HREF="/DP-cgi/setqueue">DP Game Queue</A> system at
 http://www.diplom.org/DP-cgi/setqueue. From there you can join the Master's
 List and start a generic game - six categories to choose from -
 immediately or join the GM line and a generic game will be created for you
 automatically when there are enough players and when your turn comes up.
 </P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="S3">STEP 3 - THINGS A GM HAS TO
 DO AND KNOW</A></P>
</B><P>Allrighty then. You are a new GM. Now what?</P>
<P>Well, each game experience is different. Some games flow smoothly and
 some are bitter nightmares that shake your whole core belief in humanity as
 a kind and compassionate race and changes it to one of a firm belief that
 <A HREF="http://www.lfcity.com/hobbes.html">Thomas Hobbes</A> was right
 and that the best thing mankind could do is nuke itself. Not that I'm
 bitter about a game or two or anything.</P>
<B><P>COMMANDS A GM SHOULD KNOW</P>
</B><P>There are a few commands you should know.</P>
<P>Note: All these commands and many more can be found in the Command INDEX
 file.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>clear</P>
</B></FONT><P>This command clears any phased orders. It is a good idea to
 inform all replacement players to clear any orders the previous occupant of
 the office left behind.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set deadline</P>
</B></FONT><P>Changes the deadline of the current phase. You will be asked
 to do this a lot. To change the deadline send the command SET DEADLINE MAR
 31. The deadline will now be March 31.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set grace</P>
</B></FONT><P>Similar but different to the set deadline. It changes the
 grace of the current phase.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>set wait</P>
</B></FONT><P>By setting this command you are ensuring that the turn will
 not process until the deadline.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>iamalso</P>
</B></FONT><P>Registers a new email address. This is a judge-wide command
 which affects all the game the player is in.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>summary</P>
</B></FONT><P>This will give you a report on the game including the complete
 listing of who is participating in the game. You must signon as master to
 see the complete GM listing. Otherwise you will see the generic game
 summary the same as the players.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>whois [user]</P>
</B></FONT><P>Retrieves registration information for a particular
 player.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>whogame </P>
</B></FONT><P>Retrieves registration information on every player in the
 game.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>whogame full </P>
</B></FONT><P>Retrieves registration information on every player and
 observer in the game.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>history</P>
</B></FONT><P>Retrieves the history of the game for the specified time
 period. </P>
<P>Example: history express1 from Jan 1 1997 lines 500000000</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>become [power]</P>
</B></FONT><P>This allows you to submit orders for a power who can not
 submit them do so themselves for some reason or another. In my opinion it
 is more trouble than it is worth. It is much simpler to just extend the
 deadline a day or so until the player can get his orders in. If you really
 want to do this for a player, pick up the judge file MASTER which has a
 lengthy explanation as to how to submit orders for wayward players. You may
 have to use this command if forced to use the ROLLBACK command (see
 below).</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>process [phase]</P>
</B></FONT><P>The process command forces the judge to process orders
 immediately. This is most useful when combined with the ROLLBACK command.
 </P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>rollback [turn]</P>
</B></FONT><P>This command allows you to rollback the game to a specified
 turn in case the judge hiccuped or some other act of god screwed the game
 up. </P>
<P>Note: For a detailed explanation of both the PROCESS and ROLLBACK
 commands see the MASTER file. To this date I have been extremely fortunate
 to not have dealt with the headaches caused by using either command. If for
 some reason you have to process or rollback a game, ask around from other
 GMs for help or as a last resort ask your JK for advice.</P>
<P>Note2: I would also make sure you read and re-read the DRAW file until
 you know it cold You will be asked about it in a game. Most likely several
 times.</P>
<P>Note3: Use the BECOME command when a player has lost or forgotten his
 password. Signon as master and do a BECOME command. The judge will send you
 his password and send the player a copy as well.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693128">GRANTING PLAYER EXTENSIONS</A></P>
</B><P>As a GM this will be your most frequent exercise. Players will ask
 you for extensions. If they are for a short period of time, grant them. If
 a player continually asks for deadlines, then use your judgement as to
 whether it would be more preferable to seek a replacement player (see
 General Rule #6 in the EP House Rules). I often ask players to submit
 phased orders if possible. I tend to frown on granting extensions over ten
 days. If the player has to leave the game for a few weeks, then asking him
 to find his own replacement who will play in his absence is a good idea.
 That way, the original player can retake the position when he returns. If
 this does happen, you should inform your players of the situation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693129">REPLACEMENT PLAYERS</A></P>
</B><P>Unless you are very fortunate, you will have to deal with abandonment
 or a player who has to leave your game. Finding a replacement is easy. The
 Judge does it for you. As long as the LIST flag is enabled, the game will
 be listed in the <A
 HREF="/DipPouch/openings/openings.html">Judge Openings
 List</A>. If the flag is disabled, then SET LIST will enable it. </P>
<P>In Loeb's 1991 guide he writes, "although it is preferable to get new
 people as backup players, it is permissible to have a player that has been
 eliminated return as a backup player". I disagree. Loeb's guide predates
 the EP House Rules regarding Player Replacement, which states that:
 </P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>"players may not reenter a game as a different
 power under any conditions". </P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B></FONT><P>The demand for games far exceeds the supply giving no reason
 to allow a player to play multiple powers. You may have to wait a day or
 so, but you will find a replacement.</P>
<P>When a power goes abandoned without warning, write a letter to the player
 asking him what's happening. Chances are the player either has ISP
 [Internet Service Provider] problems or the deadline slipped his mind.
 Disable the list flag by sending the command SET NOLIST and give the old
 player a few days to respond to your personal email. Tell the other players
 in the game what is happening. If after an adequate waiting period the
 player has not responded to your personal email then declare the position
 open and enable the list flag by sending the command SET LIST. If a
 replacement signs on while you are waiting for the old player, SET WAIT and
 make sure the old player has a chance to respond to you. If no response is
 forthcoming, then let the replacement player take over the position.</P>
<P>Note: If the player continually goes abandoned then you should consider
 replacing him out of fairness to the rest of the players.</P>
<P>If the player you replaced comes back and wants to get back into the
 game, generally it should be granted provided that the position has not
 changed much and that the replacement player has not invested a significant
 amount of time. Write both players and explain the situation. Of course
 each situation is different and the ultimate decision is yours as GM.</P>
<P>Loeb's 1991 Guide mentions that GMs should replace players who are no
 longer following the game. I disagree. It is not the job of a GM to
 arbitrarily decide who is playing the game properly and who is playing the
 game improperly. If a player submits ludicrous orders, that is his right.
 The game belongs to the players. </P>
<P>There is one additional reason why a GM should replace a player other
 than connectivity problems or extended absence from the game and it
 pertains to the General Rules in the EP House Rules:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#008080"><P>4) Players are expected to treat each other
 with dignity and respect. Abusive language or behavior is frowned on,
 unless clearly in character in a roleplayed game.</P>
</B></FONT><P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693130">PLAYER-GM DISSENTION</A></P>
</B><P>Sometimes players will not agree with your decisions. As a player,
 the decision of the GM is final in all cases except one. If all the players
 unanimously agree they can overrule the GM. After all, it is their game. If
 this is the case, then the GM should contact the JK to step in and make a
 decision regarding the situation. If the JK votes in favor of the players,
 the GM should acquiesce to the majority. If this is the case the GM is
 under no obligation to continue running the game and a replacement GM can
 be sought out.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693131">PLAYER POLLS</A></P>
</B><P>A word from Loeb's 1991 Guide is worth mentioning here:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<P>"Note that the GM never gives the players a chance to vote. While voting
 for house rules is allowed BEFORE the game begins questions and proposed
 changes are not allowed to be voted [on]. The job of the GM is to decide.
 Not to take opinion polls. Otherwise, one can imagine that a losing
 alliance might enact rule changes to achieve a victory that would otherwise
 be impossible".</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<P>I agree that polls should not be done on contentious issues such as
 player behavior and the like. There is only one situation where a GM is
 obliged to poll his players about proposed changes and this pertains to the
 GM Rules in the EP House Rules:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>2) GMs should not change the parameters of the
 game after players start signing up for the game unless the players
 unanimously vote to do so. This includes changing the deadline calculation,
 victory conditions, press flags, etc.</P>
</B></FONT><P>&nbsp;</P></DIR>
</DIR>

<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693121">A WORD ABOUT GM WRITING PRESS</A></P>
</B><P>Don't. </P>
<P>In Loeb's 1991 GM Guide he wrote "in theory, the GM can also write
 press". I disagree. As Loeb points out, it is unlikely or nearly impossible
 for a GM to write press that is not biased. You may also inadvertently
 release information about another player's moves. It is simply not worth
 the risk. If you really have a need to write press, than I suggest finding
 another press game to satisfy that itch.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693132">A WORD ABOUT SUBMITTING ORDERS FOR PLAYERS
 </A></P>
</B><P>Don't.</P>
<P>As noted above in the BECOME command explanation, it is simply not worth
 the trouble in case you make a mistake. If a player is experiencing email
 or connection problems, then extend the deadline a day or so. If that
 player's problems are ongoing, then replacing that player may be the
 solution. Entering a player's orders gets you way too involved in a game.
 It also opens up a Pandora's box of questions regarding impartiality.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693133">PLAYER DEDICATION ADJUSTMENTS</A></P>
</B><P>Occasionally, a player will ask you to adjust his dedication rating.
 Maybe his server died and he went abandoned or something along those lines.
 What you should do is send a WHOIS [PLAYER NAME] to the judge to get the
 player's ID number. Then send a note to the JK telling him the ID that
 needs adjusting and by how much.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>A WORD ABOUT GUNBOAT VIOLATIONS</P>
</B><P>The EP House Rules state that:</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#008080"><P>3) Players may not communicate with each other
 directly (ie, through a mechanism other than the judge) in games where the
 identity of other players is concealed, or at all in games where
 communication is barred. The potential for this arises if they guess at
 another player's identity or if the player's identity is accidentally
 revealed.</P>
<P>3a) Players in gunboat games may not make any claim, true or false, as to
 their real identities.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B></FONT><P>If a player willingly violates gunboat rules he or she should
 be removed from the game. If a player contacts another player outside the
 judge in a gunboat game that player should be removed. </P>
<P>The only time a gunboat violation should not result in an expulsion from
 the game is when it is clear that it was an accident. In that case, the GM
 has to decide whether to replace the player or not. If the accidental
 broadcast resulted in minimal possible damage to both sides, then the
 player should stay. A note to all parties concerned not to send press to
 each other outside the judge mechanism and to ignore the accident should
 also be delivered. Obviously all cases will be different. That is why you
 are sitting in the big chair.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>PLAYER REPRIMANDS</P>
</B><P>Occasionally there will be a crisis that demands your swift
 attention. If the game is a press game, take the matter off the board.
 Handle it privately between yourself and the player(s) involved. If any
 player intentionally - note the word intentionally - violates the rules
 and/or the spirit of the game and you are notified about it from a player
 who has a concern, then it is up to you whether to reprimand that player IN
 PRIVATE, or to ask for his resignation if the matter so warrants.
 Reprimands should NOT be aired in an open forum</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693134">WHAT TO DO WHEN THE JUDGE DIES</A></P>
</B><P>A GM's worst nightmare is when the judge his game is on crashes and
 is unrecoverable. Ugh. That means that you as the GM have to move the game
 or convince a JK to help you recreate the game on a new judge. This is not
 a regular experience, but a good GM is like a Boy Scout - be prepared for
 anything. In that regard, you should keep a copy of the list of players and
 all the results of the game. A JK will need this information to recreate
 the game.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693135">A NOTE ABOUT BOARDMAN AND MILLER
 NUMBERS</A></P>
</B><P>If you GM a newbie game, you will be asked about them. <A
 HREF="mailto:nfitz@sentex.ca">Nick Fitzpatrick</A> sets both numbers. You
 do not have to worry about them. If a player asks about them tell them not
 to worry and ignore it. That's what I always do. If they are still
 curious, have them check out the <A
 HREF="http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/mnc.html">E-mail MNC Home Page</A> at
 http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/mnc.html.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>A WORD ABOUT JKs</P>
</B><P>As a GM you are going to be talking to the JK a lot more than you
 were as a player. Unless you know him personally, write to the JK using the
 official JK addresses. Keep in mind that these individuals devote a lot of
 their time to running their Judge and have a lot of GMs to deal with. So if
 they do not respond to your letter immediately don't send another letter
 reminding them. Wait a while. They will get around to it when they can.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P>DRAWS AND THE THREE-YEAR RULE</P>
</B><P>In the EP House Rules regarding Draws and Concessions it states
 that</P><DIR>
<DIR>

<B><FONT COLOR="#008080"><P>4) The GM reserves the right to terminate a
 game in a draw involving all the remaining powers if it is clear that the
 position on the board has reached a stalemate (determined by no changes to
 province ownership for the last three game-years). The GM must announce
 their decision to start the three game-year clock one season prior to doing
 to. If a player objects to the termination and can convince the GM that
 there is still play in the game then the game will continue.</P></DIR>
</DIR>

</B></FONT><P>Two things must be noted. First, the clock has to be announced
 ahead of time. Second, it is up to the GM to decide if and when the clock
 is to be started. GMs are not required to start the clock if a player
 requests it nor are they required to withdraw the clock if a player
 objects. It is your decision and yours alone. If the situation warrants it,
 you may solicit opinions from the players in order to make your decision,
 but it is your decision.</P>
<B><FONT COLOR="#ff0000"><P>You are also under no obligation to announce
 draw proposals.</P>
</B></FONT><P>&nbsp;</P>
<B><P><A NAME="_Toc388693138">CONCLUSION</A></P>
</B><P>There you have it. If you follow this guide you should have no
 problem in joining the illustrious ranks of Diplomacy Gamemasters. Enjoy
 being a GM and remember that the more good GMs there are the more good
 games are available for people to play.</P>

<P><A name="appendix"><A NAME="S4">APPENDIX A - GENERAL GM ADVICE
 (FROM FELLOW GMs)</A></A></P>

<UL>
</B><LI>Be consistent. </LI>
<LI>Be responsive. If you are not available once a day, tell everyone your
 schedule. </LI>
<LI>Don't overdo it. It's preferable to have GMs that do this for years
 then one who overdoes it for a few months and then disappears. </LI>
<LI>Never overestimate your own importance. Always remember that a GM is
 there for the players, not the other way around. </LI>
<LI>Your responsibility is to the players as a group, to help them have an
 enjoyable game. Don't worry overmuch about being fair to a troublemaker in
 your game. </LI>
<LI>If you have the time, SET ALL PRESS and read it. Listen to what your
 players are saying to each other, and then see the results that
 follow--there is no better way to improve your own game than by having an
 omnipresent view of things. </LI>
<LI>Know the rules of the game, both EMAIL specific and basic game rules.
 </LI>
<LI>Be impartial, this is the cardinal rule. NEVER favor any player for any
 reason! </LI>
<LI>Don't submit orders for a player or go into the orders to clear a flag
 or fix a spelling mistake. Extend the deadline or send the player a note
 but NEVER go into a player's orders. It's just not worth the trouble if
 you make a mistake in syntax or spelling and the player suffers from it.
 </LI>
<LI>The PERSONALITY of the GM shouldn't be utterly banned from the games
 but should be reflected in them, and should enhance them! </LI>
<LI>It is as bad a form for a GM to be 'involved' in a game as it is for a
 referee to be 'involved' in a football game. </LI>
<LI>Be clear about your rulings. If you want people to not swear, speak
 French or bark in your games you have to make this clear in advance. Making
 arbitrary rulings mid-game will only make players mad at you. </LI>
<LI>You are the GM. The game belongs to the players. But this does not mean
 the players should run the game. You should uphold the rules. The EP house
 rules and your rules. They are there to protect the players. When the rules
 start going out the window, it becomes very difficult to be the
 rule-keeper. </LI>
<LI>If you want a rule that anyone who is late X number of time will be
 replaced, ask yourself if you are really willing to do the work of tracking
 how many lates players have and if you are willing and prepared to replace
 a player late in the game because of accumulated lates. </LI>
<LI>Be careful with press options and the Gunboat variant. No-press games
 necessitate the game be Gunboat, as does a broadcast only game. </LI>
<LI>If you want to avoid deadline misses as much as possible, broadcast on
 the uses of "how to phase orders." </LI>
<LI>It is a good idea to contact players directly at their email addresses
 when a power goes CD - the judge occasionally doesn't send the proper
 messages. </LI>
<LI>Never make a snap decision. If you think you need more information to
 make a decision, make a broadcast asking players to send you their
 arguments and then make a decision. </LI>
<LI>As a GM, never *ever* let yourself get tricked into helping one of the
 players with any scheme of his/hers, in order to try to fool any other
 player(s). If you allow some special trick of the trade - for example
 letting someone resign and then signon again or using another signature in
 a gunboat game - let the player know that if the other players ask the GM
 about it you will tell them the truth. </LI>
<LI>Do not let someone get you into a broadcasting flame-war. Try to keep
 your "official" answers as polite as possible. If the player insists on
 broadcasting the flames, reply by telling everyone that you will only
 answer with partial press </LI>
<LI>If you are going on a holiday or have to be away from the game for a
 while, set the grace period far enough ahead to avoid problems. Better
 still, find a replacement GM who will shepherd your game in your absence.
