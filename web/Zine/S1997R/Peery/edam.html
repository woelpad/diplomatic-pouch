I know this meeting took place.  I think I attended.  But it was so late/early on Saturday/Sunday night/morning that I don't remember.  This is a pity since I am, as the "official" Ami observer, supposed to report to the Ami hobby on what happened.  Alas, I can't, until I get some input from those who were more alert than I.  All I do remember was how well-behaved Xavier Blanchot, who presided in the absence of Francois Rivasseau, was.  Or perhaps I was just dreaming!
