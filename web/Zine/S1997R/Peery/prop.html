<H2 align=center>World Diplomacy Federation Proposal</H2>
<hr><p>
Sensing perhaps that there was no strong support for his idea of establishing a World Diplomacy Federation; Bruno-Andre Giraudon, France, did not appear in person to offer his proposal to the meeting.  (He was grabbing a bit of rest, something all WDC champions have learned to do when the opportunity offers.) Therefore, no discussion of the subject was held.

<p>

	My feeling is that what we need are not more events or more organizations in the hobby, but more players and workers.

<p>

	However, as a matter of principle I support any effort or project that potentially increases positive interaction among the national hobbies.  That includes the WDF proposal.
