As part of our on-going program to promote hobby growth and improvement the IDS presented a total of five "Doctor of Diplomacy" diplomas at this year's WDC.
<p>
Earned diplomas went to Pitt Crandlemire, USA, and Bjorn von Knorring, Sweden, who submitted evidence of their playing skills, samples of their previous game and hobby writings, and an original essay on an assigned subject.  Both of the essays will be attached to this complete report.
<p>
As part of the "train the trainer" program, diplomas were awarded to Edi Birsan, Francois Rivasseau, and Larry Peery based on their prior hobby records.
