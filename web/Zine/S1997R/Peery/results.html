<hr><p>
The Ami players did well in the early rounds, at one point holding four of the top twelve slots in the individuals, but they didn't stay there, slipping in the last round as the combination of jet lag,  not enough rest, and too much partying  took its toll.
<p>
The concept of team play is still a foreign one to most Ami players, but I think that is changing and will change more once word of this year's results get out.
<p>
Until I get more detailed results here are the ones from Per.

The prizes and awards were presented on Sunday afternoon following the end of play as part of the GOTHCON awards.  I wasn't present for that since I was spending some time on another of my loves.  Yes, strange as it is to believe, there are things more important than Diplomacy to me.  While the festivities went on downstairs; Henrik Holmgren and I were upstairs looking at airplane and air show photos!
<p>
However, I understand Cyrille got the "royal treatment," complete with crown and robe, as part of his victory.  Plaques and trophies were passed out liberally to all the winners.  Ironically, after struggling with the getting the Rivasseau-Peery Cup to Goteborg, I found myself with an even heavier monster cup, the team championship Cup, to drag around Scandinavia and take home.
