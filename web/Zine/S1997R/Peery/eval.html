<H2 align=center>Larry's Evaluation</H2>
<hr><p>
An event as complicated as a WDC cannot be evaluated simply.  There are a wide variety of elements that must be evaluated before any kind of overall evaluation can be attempted.  Consider the following:
<p>
(1) Pre-event Planning, Promotion/Publicity, and Preparation. From an overseas visitor's perspective I would give this event a *** rating (using a * star, low, to ***** star, high, system).  On the plus side were the use of Net/Web sites by both the host event, GOTHCON, and WDC. On the negative side was the lack of accurate and timely information on logistical matters.
<p>
(2)  Logistics. ** rating. Again, a lack of accurate and timely information caused needless aggrevation.  I suspect this first-time experience in dealing with large numbers of foreign visitors will result in better future efforts in this area.
<p>
(3)  Events. **** rating.  They didn't do a lot in the way of bells and whistles and extras, but what they did they did very well; and you can't get into a lot of trouble when you focus on the essentials.
<p>
(4)  Gaming. ***** rating.  By and large it went as well as possible given the circumstances.  I only saw one real snafu in the gaming (see my report on my round four game).  I offer the following suggestion for future events who are dealing with the time/year limitations vs. open-ended games dilemma.  Instead of having five rounds over three days, offer the following options: Day One: Round I in two sittings: an AM game with no set limit and going on as long as needed,  or an AM and PM game of eight hours or nine game years.  The player could either play in the long game, or in one or two of the limited games.  Day Two: Round II as on Day One.  Day Three: Round II with one single game of a specified duration.  Players could thus either play in two long and one limited games, or some combination of the four limited games and the one limited game.  Is that clear?  Probably not, but I'm too tired to elaborate further at the moment.
<p>
(5)  Education. **** Good for hobby development. Not so good for player recruitment.
<p>
(6) Bonding. ***** If you didn't, it was probably your fault, not the event's.
<p>
(7)  Post-event. Jury's still out on this one.
<p>
(8) Hobby Promotion. *** It will probably be a year before we can really say if this event did anything to promote the hobby in Sweden or elsewhere.  However, unlike some earlier events, I see no sign that hosting it hurt the host hobby or event.
<p>
In summary, as I have already said, "There is no doubt in my mind that this was the best WDC event yet, and it sets a high standard for Chapel Hill and Namur to surpass, let alone meet."  I think that says it all.
<p>
One thing that Columbus had that Goteborg lacked was a post-event feed and get together of all the foreigners.  Instead, everyone went off and did their own thing.  Having had a total of about ten hours rest, and precious little sleep, over the past three nights; I decided to get a good meal and go to bed at a reasonable hour.  I found a nice little Chinese restaurant not far from the hostel, chowed down on various goodies (deep-fried bananas?), and called it a night at 2100.  While some WDC attendees fiddled and tried to burn town the city; I slept the sleep of the innocent and the victorious.
