<P><i>[This
article was prompted by<a href="/Zine/S1997M/Szykman/About.html">Simon Szykman's request</a>, in the Spring 1997 Movement issue of the Zine, f or
people to submit ideas for "double-barrelled shotgun openings"in which two powers harmonise their openings in order to cripple or even eliminate
a third power at an early stage. I corresponded with Edi Birsan about this
idea for an opening. Some of his comments are included in the discussion
below.]</i>
<p><b>Name Dropping....</b>
<p>An opening consists of a tactical
concept embedded in a diplomatic framework.  In general, an opening should
not backfire. It is not pleasant if after a spectacular jump-start, everybody
agrees you are both "good" and "dangerous." Similarly, it is not desirable to
show off the efficiency and effectiveness of your alliance. Not only would
this cause oooh's and aaah's, but you and your ally will likely become the
couple
to beat. So, besides avoiding an outright enemy in 1901, I suggest to hide
intentional alliance and avoid intricate international supports as long as
possible, but definitely in 1901.
<p>Edi Birsan is known, among other things, for a famous opening that falls
under the description of a double-barrelled
shotgun opening: the Lepanto. In the Spring 1997 Movement issue of the Zine,
he offered an analysis of the
<a href="/Zine/S1997M/Birsan/Sealion.html">"Sealion"</a>.
This combined opening boils down to the following: Given a neutral Russia
and a friendly Italy, France and Germany join forces to acquire the English
Channel and the North Sea. Once F/G rule these waves, they have their way with
England.
<p>I thought the article was very interesting. It seems to be a sibling of
the Lepanto. As with the Lepanto opening, it deals with taking
out one of the witches at an early stage of its development. Like Lepanto,
the opening consists of two phases: acquiring the appropriate sea provinces,
followed by the actual invasion of enemy territory.
<p>In this article, I suggest an alternative for the Sealion, in case the
diplomatic scenario is different.  The opening boils down to the following:
<p><dl><dd>Given a friendly Russia and a
<b><i>hostile</i></b> Italy, Germany opens <i>seemingly</i>
anti-French, while France rushes south. By 1902, France and Germany join their
navies to acquire the English Channel and the North Sea. Once F/G rule
the waves, they have their way with England.</dl>
<P>
Although, like the Sealion, it is also based on a FG->E scenario,
it is not just a variation on Edi Birsan's opening; it is an
altogether different opening.  A different diplomatic framework requires
the tactical concept to be adjusted. At least, that is my claim.

<p><ul><li>Russia is a friend, so maybe Germany should not annoy the Czar
with Fleet Kiel-Denmark in Spring 1901. It is essential to move the fleet
in Kiel towards the North Sea, not to acquire Denmark. So give the Czar a break and open to Holland.
<li>Italy is hostile, so France needs force
in the south to fend off the pillaging Roman hordes, while confederating
and protecting Iberia.</ul>

England rules the waves, and might not even be aware of an
anti-English opening.
In Spring 1902, France takes Spain, and has a decent defense in Iberia. In
Fall 1902, England is going to face four enemy fleets, and that is
too much. F/G first takes Ech and then NTS. Acquiring NTS, England
might recapture
Ech, but then the fleets retreats to Wal/Iri. In 1903, the English line of
defense is cracked. In 1905, England should be down and out.
<p>The pivotal
unit here is the first German fleet. Instead of annoying Russia by sending
it to Denmark, we send it via Holland to Belgium. That has several
advantages:<p>
<ol><li>In Belgium, the fleet has leverage on both target sea provinces.
<li>The fleet blocks a hypothetical German invasion into France; it has no
leverage on Burgundy, or Paris (if moved to Picardy). France will
feel comfortable.
<li>Some players think F Kie-Hol (and especially Hol-Bel) is anti-French.
If that thought sinks in around the board, fine!
<li>Germany need not use his third build (perhaps he may not even take Holland);
he can offer to waive his Munich
build for the alliance (or to use the army south to aid against the Italian).
</ol>
<p>Note that after crippling England, Germany cannot build
fleets without losing French trust. Therefore, Germany might want to build
two fleets in W1901A.
<p><b>Name Calling....</b>
<P>Edi Birsan decided to call his suggested opening the Sealion,
after a German plan to invade England in World War II. So the opening I suggest
could be called the Flemish Sealion. Flemish, because the fleet in Belgium
plays a pivotal role. Also, the Flemish Lion is a well known heraldic
symbol. Since I claim the opening is not a variant, but an opening in itself,
maybe the name should not refer to the Sealion. (Besides, I don't like the
name Sealion too much.) Unlike Lepanto, the name does not refer to an alliance,
and it was not historically successful either. Call me superstitious, but I
think that is a bad omen.
<p>What about: "William and Mary"? They started in Holland,
embarked their army in Flanders, and invaded England, pursuing King Charles
II deep into Ireland. So they did not only plan to invade England, they also
might be considered to have succeeded; and they were a couple....
<p>Edi Birsan had some useful comments that shed some light on the specifics
of the opening.
<blockquote>"A fundamental problem of the
opening is that it requires that France accepts the concept that the German
will be building three and the French only one. This in itself demonstrates
a diplomatic dominance of the French player by the German player that will
send shock waves around the board.  I doubt that the results of the Fall
moves would not bring in Russia or some other eastern power to help offset
the German advantage. Further, the alliance provides the French player with
nothing of substantial material gains.  You have to discuss the division
of spoils and when you do this, you get a situation where it becomes less
of a German advantage to complete the conquest of the English since he would
have to give the majority of the spoils to the French unless the French player
is for some reason unconcerned with his own supply center count.
The advantage of the Sealion approach is that the French
and the German both build two in the first year; they also both
get two centers
out of the English and as such, as a combined force, are balanced and can
provide a counterpoint to each other in their diplomacy with the other players.
 The Flemish Lion opening would make Germany the big guy on the block and keep
him firmly in the spotlight."
</blockquote>
<p>My comments:
<ol><li>In a healthy F/G alliance, Germany should be (a little) stronger,
because it is the more vulnerable of the couple. True, it is hard to convince
France of this, because a lot of people do agree that the vulnerability
gap exists, but do not agree not with the principle of compensating for it.
However, with a hostile Italy and a German fleet in Belgium obstructing a
supported attack out of Germany into Burgundy,
France might be convinced and see the light.
<li>If the rapid growth of Germany
provokes a hostile Russia, then that should be fine with France, and rather
something for Germany to worry about.</ol>
<P>
I feel that the William and Mary opening is a legitimate alternative to
the Sealion.  Perhaps, using this opening, France need not necessarily abandon
a wish to open
against the island nation just because the Italian is poised to move west.
