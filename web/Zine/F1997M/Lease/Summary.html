The game was won by Turkey.
This game is a 48.0 hour standard gunboat game with what I think is an interesting
twist.  You will have a spy to monitor the partial press of your opponents.  The spy
will be limited to only incoming or outgoing press from only one opponent/ally.  The
spy's press will be sent only after a fall phase but before the builds.  This will give
you time to adjust your builds or disbands according to what you may have found out.
The desire for a spy's assignment will have to be communicated to me before the builds,
and at the beginning of the game.  To setup your spy just press me(master) with who you
would like to monitor and whether you would like to get his/her incoming
messages(messages the opponent gets) or outgoing messages(messages the opponent sends).
I will keep them all for compiling to you at the end of each fall phase.  You can
change your spy any time before the next build.  If you don't change it, it stays the
same for the next year.
I signed on to a game a few months ago that tried this variant by trying to add it to
the judge for automatic compiling.  Evidently he couldn't get it done because it never
happened.  I thought it was a great idea, so I will try to adjudicate the spy press by
hand.
This is an experiment so please have patience.  I will extend builds on occasion to make
sure this goes smoothly.  I am committed to this experiment to the end.  In order to
make it happen I ask that you don't send in orders too late too often.  And stay in the
game once you've committed.  It takes a lot of commitment and memory on my part, please
do yours.
Thanx for you cooperation and let's see how this works!!!
