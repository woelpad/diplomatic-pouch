<P>As master, I know that I am pledged to be impartial in the matter of the
game.  But since the game is over I would like to editorialize in the
spirit of EOG rhetoric.</P>
<P>This game was special to me, since it was a pilot of a fairly new and
constantly evolving variant.  As such, 7 talented players signed on to
play.  The game proceeded skillfully forward, with the balance of power
ever shifting.  An early France lead, yielded to a strong Turkey which
then became England's brief advantage.  The balance of power was always
changing because of one central desire; to win the game.  Not one of
them were going to give it away to anyone else.  Malice and revenge were
not on their minds only tactics, skill, diplomacy and comradarie.  All
these the mark of skilled and virtuous players.</P>
<P>All of a sudden a new player joins and throws the game to the one player
that can win it in one turn, thereby drawing a close to the game.
<P>I can't find where this shows any appreciation for the game or human
character.
<P>IMHO,<br>
Master Bob</P>
