<P>

<P>Since I wasn't in the game for long, I'll keep the EOG brief.</P>

<P>First off, Congrats to Turkey.  I will always think that the conscripted members of my former army were the true driving force behind your victory. :-}</P>

<P>I have played Austria MANY times over the past few years and have grown tired of the usual AR and AG alliance.  I thought I'd try something new this game:
AT.  I had attempted this once before, but that game stalled due to a downed judge.  This game seemed like a great experiment.</P>

<P>I immediately contacted the Sultan and began setting up Russia for a quick fall.  My spy went to Turkey so I would have all the info on who was trying to
recruit him against me.  This spy turned out to be quite worthless!</P>

<P>Things went great for the first 2 years.  Turkey and I grew, Russia was being forced back, and Italy was leaving me alone.  I figured Turkey and I would run
rampant and sew this game up quickly.  However, it was at this point that the Sultan decided not to shoot up thrugh Russia, but to stab me instead.</P>

<P>A perfectly timed stab, as well.  I was moving hard aginst Germany and Russia, and had no way to protect my Southern flank.  I was dead inside of 2 years.</P>

<P>I made a classic blunder.  I threw all my faith in Turkey's loyalty.  Diplomacy is not a game of friendships, it is a game of distrutful alliances.  I knew
this, but ignored the facts anyway.</P>

<P>My main reason for trusting Turkey outright was that if I didn't, then the AT alliance could not work.   In order for us both to grow without stepping on
each other, I was forced to move to Germany.  Turkey saw this opportunity, and before damaging Russia to the point of "no forgiveness", changed sides and
wiped me out.  Nice play!</P>

<P>As for whether I should have kept my spies or not, I agree with England.  I lost the game, I had no reason to spy on anyone.  So be it.  If you want to
keep using your spies, stay alive!</P>

<P>Master Bob:  I liked this variant very much.  However, with the current spy rules, the spies are rendered almost powerless.  I believe the spies should
be able to read messages throughout ALL phases of the game.  There is too much of a window for press to pass through right now.</P>

<P>Good game to all of you.  Hopefully I'll get the chnce to play with/against you in the future.</P>
