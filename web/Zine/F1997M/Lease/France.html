<P>Oh, you all whine like mules. Russia, England... you should never count on the little country to do exactly as its told. As I explained, I was done for no matter what. If I sided with England, I would have been squished between Turkey and England. If I sided with Turkey (but not given him victory), I would have been squished between  him and England. If you want to blame victory on someone, you have only yourselves to blame.</P>
<P>England - You blindly trusted me when you should never have done so. Your first priority should have been to prevent the win rather than try to help me. You could have saved Spain by defending it rather than trying to move eastward. That's one supply center... enough to keep Turkey from winning.</P>
<P>Russia - You could have defended Warsaw... that makes 2 supply centers. Keeping Turkey two centers short of victory.</P>
<P>Don't try to blame your loss on me. I simply played the game making it come out as best I could for the position I took over. In my case, that was getting on the winning side and playing a key role in that victory.</P>
