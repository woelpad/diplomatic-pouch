<P>I was initially very pleased to have drawn Russia for this game. I figured that with our spies being active there would be more truthful press than in a normal diplomacy game. With the number of neighbours Russia has I thought it would be an advantage. But I, like Master Bob, underestimated the amount and effects of the no-spying time.</P>
<P>My initial plan was to work towards peace in the north and join with someone in the south. Unfortunately neither happened. My position was still decent as England was an ally in the north and I could still influence the south. I did blunder in thinking I could get one of TA to help me and needlessly gave up a center to them combined with taking Sweden and helping E to Denmark started the avalanche of press between the Kaiser and myself.</P>
<P>After this I was simply playing to have part of a draw which lead me to betray England for one center. I regret my action now but at the time I felt it was essential to gain a unit and I was a little paranoid. As it turns out I think I could have trust Castleberry since his loyal and peaceful play allowed Turkey's stab of Austria to move Turkey past England. I am still surprised that the Sultan stabbed Austria but I suppose he felt they would have to fight at some time.</P>
<P>Another major turning point was France's choice to build in Brest and Paris, and leave Marsailles open. I really wanted for an FER to form and I think if there had been a build in Mar I could have convinced Castleberry to go along.</P>
<P>The final year: While it is true that I could have regained Moscow, I only regret that not doing so ended the game. If I the choice to make over, I'd do the same thing. As it was we (FER) had 17 centers and they were 17 that we could hold. Throughout the game I've been consistent in that I didn't care how many were in a draw as long as I was. Plus I felt an affinity for the other small fry in the game. I figured as long as remained at 17, England could take no chance in trying to eliminate France as Turkey would surely win. Unfortunately France didn't see things that way and I respect his right to be wrong.</P>
<P>I was proud to have survived this game, set up a stalemate line against Turkey, and stalled England's solo bid ( although France had more to do with this). Embarrassed to have helped the Kaiser, betrayed Castleberry.</P>
<P>Regarding this variant,
I really enjoyed having the chance to read other people's press. I was disappointed that it didn't prove as effective as I thought it would. This was due to the large diploming taking place during the adjustments. Although the press was entertaining I think it only affected my actions once. But at the same time I was much more catious about what I would say in press. Plus secret key words, I only set them up once, or more appropriately Lord Castleberry set them up for us and they only lasted for a year still it was fun and I'd probably try to use this tactic more if I was to play again.</P>
<P>I also wish I had monitored more of the Sultan's press as he seemed most willing to say anything during the spying sessions and I think it would have been good reading. </P>
<P>I would have to say that either press should be monitored all the time or that no press should be allowed during adjustments. I think my favorite form of this variant would have to press immediately sent to you by your spy. I've been looking over the judge code for some time just out of curiousity and I'm going to start looking if that could be implemented. In the meantime, I'd like to GM a game similiar to this except that the spies would send their reports at the end of every phase. Let me know if any of you would be interested.</P>
<P>Oh yes, and I have more comments on eliminated players retaining spies. Since it wasn't specified at the start of our game, I feel we made the proper choice for this game. But if its specified at the start of the game I have no problem with players keeping their spies. It would be nice to have the ability to extract more revenge than simply giving centers to another power.</P>
<P>Thanks to Bob for orgainizing this game. I really enjoyed it. Part of that was the players, I've been really blessed lately to have games where people generally get their orders in on time and the games fly by.</P>
<P>Thanks everyone!</P>
