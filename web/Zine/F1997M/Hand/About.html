About The Diplomatic Pouch

<P>
Well, here we are again.  Before turning you loose to dive into the fine
assortment of articles we have this issue, there are a few things to report
in the way of progress.  So let's get right to them and dispense with the
preliminaries as quickly as possible, shall we?
<H3>Here at The Pouch...</H3>
As you may have noticed, the Pouch has changed just a little bit.  Starting with
the front page, a few little graphic changes were made here and there.  Just
a mini-facelift.  Not
a lot, but we hope you like the new look.
<P>
We've also started to put some serious effort into the other sections of
The Pouch.  For example, look for the unveiling of World and Continental
championship tournament results from past years -- coming soon.  We're also
looking to finally get the Showcase section moving.
<font color=red>
<b>Anyone who wishes to volunteer to be the councillor for the Showcase section
is welcome to apply.</b></font>
We can provide you with instant fame, fortune, and
editing tasks.  Well, okay, no fortune, but two out of three ain't bad,
right?
<H3>Elsewhere...</H3>
Between issues, I was able to spend some time putting together what I call
<a href="../../../dpjudge/?variant=payola">"Payola Central"</a>
(I'm not crazy about the name), the Website for information on and for the
players of the Payola variant.  If you get a chance, check it out.  It
completely automates the play of the variant, which not only took a load of
work off my (and other Master's) shoulders, but, well, makes me feel real
good.  I spend a lot of time at the site (for no particular reason), and it
proved a valuable resource for <a href=../../F1997M/Mayer/Payola.html>the first article
in Frank Mayer's
new column series</a>, which you can find in  this issue of The Zine.
<H3>Hobby Awards</H3>
I was honored earlier this year to be put onto the Hobby Awards committee.
(As if that wasn't honor enough, I can now say that I've received mail from
hobby legend Melinda Holley, the chairperson of the committee.)  The first
order of business after I joined was the taking of a number of votes, some
of which concerned how the awards committee should consider the PBEM hobby.
<P>
The hobby awards had always been PBM-centric (until last year, when I
was completely shocked to be nominated for and then actually to receive
the Don Miller Memorial Award).  I found that the other committee members
were still very much in the dark when it came to PBEM Diplomacy.  In fact,
this was one reason I was asked to sit on the committee.  I had to correct
an unfortunate misapprehension that there is no literary contribution by
electronic Zines.  I like to think that the Zine you see before you is a
very strong counter-example.
<P>
The result of the votes was that PBEM hobby activity will be eligible for
certain of the awards (most notably, the Rod Walker award for literary work)
beginning next year.  In the meantime, the nominations for the current
year came out and all the Rod Walker nominees were for articles in
<i>Diplomacy World</i>.
<P>
Personally, I still feel that both hobbies would be served well by the addition
of some new PBEM-only awards, and I hope to create such a set soon.  Not to
distance the PBEM hobby from the PBM hobby, but to ensure that those who
contribute to the hobby at large have ample chance for recognition.
<P>
I've been over this once before, in a previous "About The Pouch" article,
so at least the thought is still alive.  Someday, hopefully soon, you'll
see some action from me on this point.  Anyone who is interested in helping
is invited to drop me a line.
<P>
On a related note,
I confess that I don't understand the Runestone Poll, since The Pouch made
a respectable debut appearance last year (surprising me by even being on the
list) but doesn't show up anywhere this year.  Perhaps
there is a nomination process I don't know about, or perhaps the Runestone
Poll has decided to concentrate only on all the fine work being done in the
Postal 'zines.
<H3>The Pouch's World Champ</H3>
A couple weeks ago, DipCon XXXI was held in Seattle (look for the results, to
be posted in the Face-to-Face section soon).  A new North American Champion,
Chris Mazza, was crowned there, meaning that Pitt Crandlemire, The Pouch's
"Big Dipper," no longer holds that title.  (His hold on the World Championship
expired in Goteborg -- read about <a href=WDC7.html>my own experiences there</a>
elsewhere in this issue).
<P>
Pitt would have been on-hand to defend his North American Championship in
Seattle had he not been laid up by ill health.  At the time of this
writing, Pitt is still recovering with some difficulty (you will notice
that there is no "Big Dipper" column in the current issue).
<P>
<font color=red><b>
What I would like to ask is that each and every Pouch reader -- and there are
thousands of you -- flood Pitt's e-mail account with your best wishes for his
speedy return to health.</b></font>
Let the past World and North American Champion
know that the hobby's thoughts are with him.  Pitt's e-mail address is
<a href="mailto:pittc@syncon.com?subject=Get Well Soon!">pittc@syncon.com</a>,
and I would greatly appreciate your sending him a note.  I know he will too.
<H3>And Finally, the Usual</H3>
Thanks once again to Simon!  I found myself overly busy last time around,
and the best I could do for the last issue was hunt down a pack of
volunteer editors and mail Simon every so often while he published the
issue.  I know you've all heard many times that I honestly couldn't do
what I do without Simon's help, and this is proven once again by the fact
that he often does it all and I do very little.  This was the case last
time and I truly can't thank him (and the volunteer editors) enough.
<P>
I'm glad to be able to climb back in the publisher's chair that he kept
so warm for me last time, and, as always, I hope you enjoy the latest issue of the
Pouch Zine.
