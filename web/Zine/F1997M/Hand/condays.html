<H3>Goteborg</H3>

The flight from Stockholm to Goteborg, which took about an hour, was my
first flight on a non-American airline.  It was quite an experience listening
to all the in-flight announcements in Swedish.  If I remember right, all the
important ones were also repeated in English, but one incident in particular
pointed up the language difference.
<P>
The landing in Goteborg was without question the scariest of my life.  I have
been on planes that were met on the ground by fire engines, and on which
we passengers
had to land with our head between our knees, but I had never been on a landing
like the one at Goteborg.  I am positive that the cause of the trouble in
the landing was wind shear.  The tail of the plane just swung wildly to and
fro as we descended.  It was truly worrying.  Once the pilot managed to
land the plane despite the apparent lack of horizontal control, the passengers
erupted in spontaneous applause.  Then the pilot came on the public
announcement system and said something in Swedish that made everyone laugh.
Not just a small laugh, either -- everyone had a very good belly laugh.
Everyone except me, of course.  I imagine he said something like, "The
flight attendants will be around shortly to collect the airsickness bags"
but I'll probably never know for sure.
<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 border=3 src=GOTEBORG.JPG>
Twenty minutes after landing in Goteborg, I met Pitt Crandlemire, as
pre-arranged, at the international arrivals gate.  We struggled with a map
for a while and then set off on bus for the youth hostel that was to be our
home.
<P>
When we arrived at the hostel (in fine cool weather) we found that it was
not what we both had feared.  It was not an old ship, and it was not a
warehouse.  It also was not open for business.  With a few hours to spare until the hostel
opened (for those, like us, without keys), we visited a nearby restaurant
to have a bite of lunch, catch up with each other, and play a bit of the
game we've created.  The restaurateurs were very patient with us -- we were
there for a very long time playing a strange game of cards -- but had some
trouble communicating with us.  I thought I ordered one of the two options
given me, but was brought the other.  I also learned that "water" in Sweden
is always bottled, sparkling water.  Yecch!  I've never been able to get a
taste for that stuff.  Why ruin perfectly good water by putting bubbles into
it?
<P>
Once the hostel was opened, we dragged our luggage up the stairs from the
restaurant and got checked in.  We were put in a four-bunk room with Edi
Birsan.  Larry Peery was also to stay in the room, but he had earlier
had himself moved elsewhere.  Probably (if you ask Edi) because he knew
that my snoring the first night would keep him up  -- for I am told this it did
for Pitt and Edi; luckily for them (and me), I was able to avoid repeat
performances on the subsequent nights.
<P>
With our luggage in our room, Pitt and I continued the game we had started
at the restaurant.  We did so in a common area that was set up with tables
perfect for game playing.  Before too long, our fellow Diplomats started
arriving.  The French contingent and the rest of the Americans: Larry, Edi,
Dan Mathias (with his wife), and Tom Korbin.
<P>
Then came the salmon.  Wow.  You know the stereotype that the French are
good cooks?  Well (in my limited experience) it's true.  The French
attendees set a table for all of us and cooked (in the hostel's kitchen)
a large salmon with all the fixings.  It was indescribably good.
<P>
After playtesting our game for a while with Edi in our room (getting some good
feedback -- thanks, Edi!), it was time for sleep to prepare for the early
morning start at the tournament.  I slept very well (as Pitt and Edi can
attest, since they were wide awake while I was doing so).
<P>
When morning dawned, it found us eating a breakfast set out by the kind
lady at the hostel.  We Americans didn't quite know what to make of some of
the food.  I understand that a thick white liquid that none of the rest of
us would dare touch was poured by Dan Mathias over his cereal (he thought it
was milk).  He ate it not to be rude, but apparently the gel-like substance
was some kind of yogurt that no one with tastebuds would consider mixing with
the Swedish equivalent of Cheerios.  There was some confusion about money
due the hostel for breakfast, and then we were off on foot to the convention
site at a high school campus.
<P>
Pitt, Dan, his wife, and I set out for the high school together, but I had
forgotten my hat and gloves (the morning was cold) so I returned to get them,
then had to run a mile or more to catch up with them (I swear they were trying
to ditch me -- I have no idea how they got so far ahead of me in that span of
time).
<P>
The convention site wasn't all that close to the hostel, and we determined
that public transportation, rather than the foot, should be the rule
henceforth.  Tired and sweaty, though, we arrived at the high school,
asked at the main registration desk for directions to the building and floor
that was allocated to the Diplomacy tournament, and soon enough were ready to
play.

<H3>The First Round</H3>

I had no particular ambition or hopes for the tournament, so when I drew
Italy in round 1, I was not disappointed by what some would consider a tough
draw.  Edi Birsan was France, Larry Peery in Austria, and Bjorn von Knorring
played Russia.  With three Americans at the table, I was in for an awakening
as to the difference between the European and American game.
<P>
Larry and I worked well in a Lepanto encouraged by Edi, and Turkey's Russian
ally didn't defend him perhaps as well as he could have, ending up with a
couple of the prizes himself.  Before Turkey was completely dispatched,
however, Larry stabbed me, taking Venice from Trieste.  I immediately
made peace with the Turk, who convoyed my army back from Greece to Naples,
and soon I had driven Larry back and followed him into his homeland.  With
help from all around, Larry was eliminated.
<P>
The clock was running.  The game was going to end (as they do in Sweden)
after the 1909 moves, and so right about this point, everyone realized that
there were only three more moves to be made.  Everything totally broke down
as everyone tried to grab centers without regard for alliances.  There was
no longer any need to talk to anyone, since each player's best moves, completely
self-interested, were obvious to everyone else turn after turn.  My big
talking point was to try and take second place in the game (players were ranked
according to SC count at the end of the game) by besting Bjorn by a single
SC.  It was not to happen, though, and we both ended up tied behind Edi.
<P>
In his game, Pitt fared poorly, but he expected to, because of his reputation.
As the defending World Champion, some said he didn't stand a chance.  Those
who said so turned out to be correct.  Players wouldn't even consider talking
to him or working with him.  Not just in the first game but in every game
he played.  Very sad, but he had expected it.
<P>
Pitt and I had hooked up with Vincent Mous (he of the Modern variant, among many
other things) and David Norman, and together we took lunch at the cafeteria.
We found that the movie "Kelly's Heroes" is apparently a popular role-playing
game, because the cafeteria was full of people engaged in that activity
while the movie was being played on two televisions.

<H3>The Second Round</H3>
The second round was held in the afternoon and evening of the first day,
so when we finished our meal, we trundled back upstairs to the boards.
This time, I was given France among a sextet of Europeans.
<P>
The German approached me before the first turn saying he was decided to
go against England and nothing would convince him otherwise.  What can
a Frenchman do but agree to go along with a mind like that?  We set the
Englishman up perfectly for the Sealion opening I suggested, and he was
on the ropes fast.  The Englishman had only lukewarm support from Russia,
and the Italian was very friendly with me, moving everything eastward.
<p>
That is, until he decided otherwise.  The Italian stabbed me and stabbed me
good right when I was beginning to administer the death blows to England.
Despite pressure from Germany to continue my English attack, I realized I had
to completely back out of the north to deal with the Italian.  I disengaged
quickly, making sure England would not follow, and found that the Italian
couldn't back his forward units.  After a short time, the Mediterranean was
not quite mine, but obviously would be soon.
<P>
What had happened when Italy swung west, however, was a massive Russian
expansion.  He stuffed himself into Germany and all but finished off Austria
(who played with a single unit for a long time) after taking Turkey (and
then the Italian holdings there) out single-handedly.
<P>
So at this point, I decided that Italy and I should set aside our differences
so that the Russian threat could be dealt with.  I organized everyone on
the board into an anti-Russian coalition and we all moved eastward.
<P>
Russia's size was such that even a concerted attack could not put him out of
the game by 1909 -- not even close.  But Russia realized that his only hope
of keeping
his position was if I stabbed the coalition from behind to slow them down.
Russia and I talked quite a bit about this, and I kept assuring him that
I would do so.  He said that the game was obviously a two-way race between
the two of us, and we should both start grabbing dots to see who would win.
<P>
That's kind of what I did, but I made sure that the coalition wouldn't break
as I did so.  I only took SC's with the owner's foreknowledge, and after
making the necessary plans with him to ensure the loss of the SC wouldn't
hurt at all.  I made sure that everyone in the coalition realized that
the only chance to keep Russia from getting first place points was to give
them to me.  Basically, by continually reminding my allies of Russia's
earlier expansion,
I made them consider my own slow and arranged expansion somehow "nicer."
I effectively kept the Russian's early leader syndrome from being transferred
to me.
<P>
With about two years to go, the Russian had calculated the worst case, and
determined that it was going to be a tie.  He moved to avoid the tie, and I
was able to play on that to have my allies move  such that his worst case
was miscalculated.  On the last turn, Venice was one of the swing SC's.
Both Russia and I could take it from Italy, who wanted my support in holding
it.  I tried and tried to find a way to accommodate him, but I needed to
attack him so that the Russian, in Trieste, would be kept busy.
He would either have to support the Italian or bounce my attack to keep me
from gaining the extra SC.  If he thought I would support my Italian ally,
he could take Serbia and break the tie.
Italy was afraid that my attack would succeed and he would drop into fourth
place, but I couldn't do anything other than attack him.
<P>
As it turned out, the Russian bounced me, but it also turned out that the tie
was not a tie after all.  A few moves before the end of the game, I had played
the game out in my mind and saw that the edge was actually mine.  For all
those turns, I kept talking loudly and to everyone like I would either be
second or tied. This both reinforced Russia's thought that the worst that
could happen to him was a tie and also reinforced my allies' determination
that doing as I asked would actually split the first-place points and not
really benefit me as much as they would otherwise have been afraid.
<P>
As I say, though, I found a way to squeeze an extra SC out, and with a
certain surprise move made by the single-unit Austrian on the last turn, a
move that landed him in Warsaw with my support, Russia had to settle for second to my
France.  I professed shock at the result, but had known for at least two
years that the single SC edge could be mine.  (I promised to buy a drink
for the Austrian, but I haven't yet made good.  Next time I see him, I
promise to treat him to a double.)
<P>
Pitt, whose game had ended earlier than mine did, hung around and watched my
victory, which made me quite happy.  I had watched his successes at Columbus
and I was real proud to be able to repay the debt.  I couldn't tell Pitt
while the game was ongoing that I knew the win was mine, but I told him on our
way back to the hostel that all my "I hope for a tie" talk (talk that even he
had overheard) had actually been a ruse.
<P>
Frankly, I was amazed at how different my second game was from my first.
In my first game, I was struck by the fact that negotiations completely
ended about three moves before the end of the game.  That never happened
in my second game, in which every player always had a lot of negotiation
to do all the way through the game.  Pitt and I discussed this, and I
decided the reason was that my second game was full of Swedes, while my
first game was full of Americans.  The Swedes know how to play time-limited
games, but we Americans do not.
<P>
In talking about this, Pitt and I pooled our experiences at the various (okay,
two) World
DipCons and came up with some broad conclusions about the style of play of
people of each nationality.  Since Pitt has promised to write an article for
The Pouch on this subject, I won't go into it in any detail, but it is
relevant here to point out why a game, played to a 1909 time limit, plays
so much differently when populated by Swedes than it does when populated by
Americans.
<P>
Swedes, as a rule, don't hold a grudge.  When a Swede is stabbed, he is just
as likely to cooperate on the next turn with the person who stabbed him as he
is to work with his best friend.  I have come to understand this instant
forgiveness easily.  To a Swede, each time the board positions change, it
is a brand new game.  All history is thrown out, and each player looks to
find his best advantage, regardless of with whom that would mean he works.
It is as if every player is replaced every turn with a new player.  This is
a novel concept to the American, who tends to think of the longer-term
because they are used to games without time limits.  Why should I help
my invader immediately after he stabs me?  To an American, there is no
reason to do so.  To a Swede, the answer is "why not?"
<P>
In order for an American to train himself to play properly against Swedes,
it would be ideal to play a game in which, after every single
movement phase, all the players' power assignments are randomly shuffled,
with no one playing the same power two turns in a row.  I honestly think
that this would be a good training situation:  the player would be forced to
take a fresh perspective each turn -- meaning a nation's policies and alliances
are prone to changes that American players usually do not consider --
and yet he would retain and be able to use
his knowledge of player personalities in negotiating.  As a matter of fact,
I'm so enamored with this idea that I'm going to stake a claim to it and
egotistically (who, me?) call it the Hand Training Method, or something like that.

<P>
As I say, this is only one of the many observations that we made about
the playing styles evident in the various European communities, and I won't
steal Pitt's thunder any more than I already have.  (Maybe Pitt will
introduce the "Crandlemire Training Method" for preparation for play
against French or UK players.)  My point here was
simply that game mechanics get interesting and differences are easily noted
when these multiple schools of thought are represented.
<!--
In round 1, with the game heavy on Americans, the 1909 time
limit was a mystery and the game played out poorly.  In my second round,
with the game made up mostly of Swedes, it played out correctly.  In my
next game, about which you'll read later, there was a mix consisting of
American (me), Swedish, French, and English players. 
-->
<P>
Pitt and I then made our way back to the hostel.  We wanted to take the
streetcars, but the hour was so late that the one we wanted no longer ran.
Had we known how to read Swedish, we'd have been able to choose its
night-time substitute, but alas! we ended up walking the first and last
third of the way, hopping a bus for the middle third.  Along the way,
Pitt started saying that with a second and a first in the two rounds, I
stood a chance at the title.  This scared me no end, and I hoped for a
poor showing in the next round, so that I wouldn't have the pressure of
the finale game.  I just didn't have the competitive spirit, I said.  (Later,
I found out that I was lying to myself about that.)
<P>
Pitt and I, working from the bookcase in the hostel library, made up a
trivia game based on the Swedish translations of the titles of well-known
English books.  Pitt may use this in an upcoming issue of his <i>Pragmatic
Iconoclast</i> postal subzine.
<P>
I decided to read for a while before turning in (one reason I had was that I
wanted to ensure that Edi and Pitt could get some sleep), and I actually fell
asleep on the couch, to be awakened after a couple hours by the arrival of the
French contingent, Tom Korbin, and Larry Peery.  I remained only half-awake at
best
while talking to them and they probably thought I was drunk.  (I learned later
that perhaps some of them actually were.)

<H3>The Third Round</H3>
The third round was held early on the second day.  Most competitors decided
not to participate in the third round, opting for sleep.  The way the
tournament rules were, everyone was forced to sit out one of the five rounds.
Because the fourth round was the team championship round, over 80% of the
competitors sat out the third round.
<P>
Pitt and I were among that 80%, but Edi was in the minority who rose and played
the third round, sitting out the fourth.  With the American representatives
a limited quantity, and needing to form a couple of three-person American
teams, we couldn't really understand Edi's decision.  As it turned out, I now
know why he made his decision, and why it was the right one.  As you'll
see, Edi's experience as a tournament-goer served him well.

<H3>The Fourth Round</H3>

The fourth round was the team tournament.  I was initially intent on being on
an American team, but things got shuffled and David Norman, Vince Mous, and I
formed what we called the "Internet team."  We didn't show too well.
<P>
You see, after the second round, the rankings of the players was posted
on the walls.  I was in seventh place.  Had there been no fourth round, I
would have been at the final table playing for the World Championship.
But there was a fourth round, and the players in it went in with the
foreknowledge that if they wanted into the final table, they would have
to beat me.  I didn't stand a chance.
<P>
I drew Austria, and my one (thankfully, gamelong) ally, a British player playing Italy,
noticed
that once we players exchanged names, some players checked the rankings to
determine the caliber of their competition.  He told me that, having noticed
my position, they had slated me for the noose and that there would be nothing I
could do to convince them to ally with me.  This proved to be precisely true;
I was
frozen out immediately.  I don't want to sound like I'm complaining, but
throughout the game, I felt like I was playing a game with only about
three players in it.  None of my logical arguments could convince the
coalition against me to break; they were after my spot in the tournament
rankings, not after any in-game result.
<P>
With help from Italy, who reluctantly started chomping on me just to keep
the enemy from taking all of me, I managed to survive for a long time with
a single unit.  I never had anyone to talk to, and I actually found myself
longing for elimination.  Finally, though, I managed to get word to Turkey,
since I had nothing else to do with my lone unit one turn, that I would
support him against Russia.  He could use it or not.  I didn't expect him to
use it, despite his saying he would, since he had lied to me at every
opportunity.  But he did, and this finally broke the R/T juggernaut, leaving
me in an important enough position that no one could afford to eliminate me.
I survived with that single unit (in either Serbia or Greece), retreating it
in fact on the last move to an open SC.
<P>
With such a poor finish, I dropped from seventh on the rankings to
twenty-eighth, which is where I finished.  Though I'm far from ashamed of
finishing twenty-eighth, I'll always remember that bright and shining moment
when I was one of the top board-worth of Diplomacy players in the world.  I'll
also always believe that the posting of the rankings on the wall doomed me to a
lower rank than I perhaps deserved.  For me, it tainted the whole event, and
I find it hard to believe that only the best players can survive to the final
table when attacks are decided upon based on current rankings.  It would
seem that this conspires to advance the lower-ranked players above those
ranked higher, regardless of the negotiation skills of each.
<P>
I was, to be blunt, hopping mad about this during the fourth round.
And anyone who knows me knows that I rarely get mad at all, let alone
hopping mad.  To my own surprise, I guess I did want to have a chance to
win the tournament after all.  Anyway, virtually friendless in the game
despite all attempts, I had the time to rant and complain to the
tournament organizers.  After the game, I had calmed down a bit, and Leif
Bergman (who I humbly call my friend, and who did a great job directing
the tournament) talked to me about the posting of the rankings.  He had a
reason for posting them that
I admit I didn't consider.  He pointed out that some people are going to keep
track and will know the results from the various games, and it would be unfair
not to level the field by providing the same information to the other players.
I had to agree, but (and this, I'm sure, has been much-discussed among
tournament organizers and scoring system creators) I couldn't help but think
that there must be a better way.  But of course, I couldn't think of one
(there probably isn't one)
and I had by then resigned myself to the <i>fait accompli</i>.

<H3>The Final Day</H3>

Deciding we had little reason to play in the fifth round, Pitt and I slept in.
Edi, however, had a spot at the final table, so he was up and out of the room
long before Pitt and I roused ourselves.  One thing Edi consciously did
to ensure his spot at that table -- after his successes in the first and
second rounds --
was to play in the sparsely-attended third round, when those who would
decide alliances based on the tournament rankings were yet to be heard from.
I understand that Edi was not the only one at the final table who had
wisely hit upon and used this tactic.
<P>
<img border=3 align=left src=AWARDS.JPG hspace=5>
Pitt and I, after rising, toured the streets of Goteborg (at a mall,
Pitt stocked up on games) and then we
showed up at the convention site for the WDC Society meeting and the awards
ceremony.  Shown here, in a photograph that didn't turn out as well as
I had hoped, you can see the World Dip Cup (the Rivausseu-Peery
trophy) changing hands.  Pitt (left), the 1996 Champion, hands the cup to
Cyrille Sevin of France, the new World Champion, while Leif (far left)
looks on and applauds with the assembled crowd.
<P>
After the ceremony, Pitt and I set up and played the game we'd created,
getting a lot of interest (and even advance orders) from bystanding players.
The other members of my team joined in and helped to playtest for the
rest of the evening, for a time at the hotel where the UK players were
staying, and we worked a dinner in there as well.  Determined to reset
our body clocks, Pitt and I stayed up all night (we had early morning flights
homeward) with Tom Korbin to playtest some more.
<br clear=both>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
I kept (for the most part) to the subject of 
Diplomacy in this section of the article, but in so doing,
I left out some unforgettable moments.  Like the hot dog stand where Dan,
Pitt, and I stuffed our faces at three in the morning.  Like that same hot
dog stand the next day, when we could have sworn we were waited on by the
same lady, only to find out it was her daughter.  Like the memorable hours of
conversation I shared with Pitt, David, and Vince over what I've come to
remember as the "John Adams" dinner. (The main topic of our conversation
was the role of government, as seen through American and European eyes.
This was truly interesting for me to hear the European point of view on
individual freedoms and on taxation systems.)  And like the dinner we
obvious Americans shared at a restaurant that served both alligator
and kangaroo (I believe I had the chicken).
<P>
I suppose you can tell, just from the length of this narrative, that I enjoyed
myself immensely in Goteborg, and although (as face-to-face events do) it
left me a little burnt out on Diplomacy for a short while afterwards, this
quickly passed, and I soon found myself (as I am while writing this) anxious
to renew my international frendships at World DipCon VIII at DixieCon next year.
<P>
See you there.
