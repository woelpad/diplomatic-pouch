We only have a few deposits to lay before you this issue, so rather than
bothering to set up a
new topic for future discussion, I'm going to forego that and
let you get right to the letters.  This doesn't mean that I don't want
you to go back and look at <a href=/Zine/>the previous issues</a> and
send in your contributions in response to the discussion topics offered
in earlier Deposits columns.  Quite the contrary.  I'm hoping that by
cutting to the chase this time, you might be all the more encouraged to
do just that.
<P>
As you'll see, the deposits below cover a wide variety of topics, and
they're all well worth reading.

<H3 align=center>Mail Received Concerning Brahm Dorst's Challenge<br>
in the <a href="/Zine/S1997R/Szykman/Deposits.html">S1997R Pouch
Deposits</a></H3>
<HR>
<H4>From Simon Szykman:</H4>
Brahm had challenged people to come up with
the solution to a stalemate line puzzle.
According to Brahm, there were between five and seven correct
submissions sent to him.
<P>
In the last Deposits column, I had said that I found two solutions
to the puzzle.
Unfortunately, I later found a slight error in one of my
solutions, so I only know of one solution.  I then confirmed
with Brahm that this was the same one he found.  For those
who were interested, the solution is presented below.
<P>
Who knows...maybe there is, indeed, a
second solution and some determined strategist might
figure it out.  If not, my apologies for any frustration
incurred by anyone looking for a second solution that
wasn't there to be found.
<p>
<b>Solution:</b> The setup for Italy is
F Wes, F NAf, F GOL, A Tun, A Pie, and the moves are as follows:
<blockquote> <tt>
A Tun - Wes - Spa<BR>
F Wes C A Tun - Spa<br>
F NAf S F Wes<br>
A Pie - Mar</tt></blockquote>
<p>
The convoyed attack to Spa and the attack
on Mar cut support for an attack into GOL, so GOL is safe.  The support
of Wes guarantees that Wes is safe.  Neither NAf nor Pie can be
dislodged.
<p>In this case, GOL is free to support the convoyed attack to Spa.  If France
plays correctly (by supporting Spa or having a supported attack into
Spa using Por and Gas), the supported convoy will fail.  However, if
France makes a mistake and the convoy succeeds, Italy has destroyed a
French fleet.  If this happens, the stalemate line is lost, but Italy can
again restore it by convoying Spa back to Tun via Wes the following move.
Furthermore if Spa was taken in a Fall move, France can't rebuild for another
year even if he retakes Spa in the Spring.  This may or may not give
Italy some room to work against France in the coming year, depending
on what other units Italy and France may have.
<p>
Also note that using F NAf-MAO instead of F NAf S F Wes does <i>not</i>
yield a solution to the
puzzle because the convoy to Spa does not cut support for an attack
on Wes since that fleet is being used in the convoy.  Therefore, with
F Naf-MAO, France could get through with F MAO-Wes, F Spa S F MAO-Wes.

Mail Received Concerning the Issue of Stabs and Timing,<BR>
Raised in an Earlier Pouch Deposits Article</H3>
<HR>
<H4>From Chris Martin
(<a href=mailto:TremewanC@aol.com>TremewanC@aol.com</a>):</H4>
Just catching up on the Pouch articles, and I noticed the discussion about
stabs.  Something often overlooked, I feel, is a stab for position.  A one
center stab which opens up your enemies rear, or flank -- especially when he
is thouroughly engaged elsewhere -- is, I think, often overlooked as "not
being worth it".
<P>
I can think of a number of examples, but very recently I stabbed Russia for
Sevastopol in the fall, forcing him to disband a unit, after a pretty good
R/T alliance.  He was heavily engaged in Germany, while France and England
were both still around 5/6 units.  If he turned to face the threat in the
rear, he'd lose his gains in the east.  England smelled the Blood in the
Water (Diplomacy players are better than Sharks at that!)  and came after him
as well.  As of this writing, the game is still in progress, but so far it's
worked out pretty well.
<P>
Just my two cents!  Love the Zine!

<HR>
<H4>From Andy Schwarz
(<a href=mailto:schwarz@haas.berkeley.edu>schwarz@haas.berkeley.edu</a>):</H4>
I am in the process of reading your article "Diplomacy and Game Theory" from the
Spring Retreat issue of Diplomatic Pouch.  Since this looks to be an academic
paper, I hope you won't mind me asking you some
questions and making some suggestion, as one budding game theorist to another.
<P>
In the section "What Kind of Game is Diplomacy?"  you state (by footnote 10),
that all equilibria in two-person zero-sum games are equivalent and
interchangeable.  Do you mean that the are not pareto rankable?  I do not have
access (here at work anyway) to the source you cite on this.
<P>
By the way, I study Game Theory within an economic context.  It looks like you
are  a political scientist.  I wonder if "equivalent and interchangeable" is
just Poly Sci jargon for "The Pareto frontier" or non-Pareto rankable, or if we
have fundamentally different concepts of ranked equilibria.
<P>
Oh, and do you mean this to hold for only static games or dynamic games as well?
I think looking at Diplomacy as anything but a long finitely repeated game (or a
game with a certainty of ending but with only a small probability of doing so at
any given turn, so it acts quasi-infinite) misses the boat.
<P>
I notice that in Footnote 12 you mention my little
variant called "Hundred."  it might please you to know that this game was
developed, in part to allow for some experimental game theory work which I have
yet to tackle.

I'm writing mostly because I'm finally back online and itching to play
weird variants again.  Any progress on Time Travel/Deja Vu Diplomacy?

my mind.  Maybe by broadcasting my failure to make it anything else, I'll
be inundated with questions and forced to take some action.  Or maybe not.</i>

I see that Payola has grown and prospered, and
I never lost interest in Prime Minister Lynley's Texan variant, I hope you know.
<blockquote><i>Lynley was one of my roles in the PBEM game I mentioned.
A royal personage in the game mistook Paris, France for Paris, Texas, and
soon a wild hair got into someone and a variant was created.</i></blockquote>
Out of my own self-important curiousity, I ran a search for
<a href=/DipPouch/Zine/S1996M/Shoham/IFCOS.html>ICFOS</a> on
r.g.d. from your incredibly great site, and found that someone was
actually pulling together a game around the end of last year -- but the
judge that it was forming on crashed. Do you think there might be
interest out there if I were to start one up myself?

I bet so.  Dan Shoham gave ICFOS a great plug in the his Diplomacy Academy

I hope all is going well....from all appearances, you've carved out a

<H3 align=center>A Report from AvalonCon<br>
From The Pouch's Own Simon Szykman</H3>
<HR>
<P>
I tied for first in the gunboat Diplomacy tournament, as Italy
no less.  I shared a two-way draw with another person, just as I did at
the WDC gunboat tournament in Columbus last year, but unlike there, this time
the
next best result was a three-way, so we won the tournament.  Unfortunately,
it was only a demonstration tournament, meaning that there were no
awards or plaques given.
<P>
Italy is never a great power to play, but at least with press you can
negotiate and/or lie your way to a good position.  I find Italy hard to
play in gunboat games since you can't talk your way into peace with
anyone.  I decided take a chance and bolt out of the starting gate with
an aggressive opening.
<P>
I opened with Ven-Tri, Rom-Ven, Nap-Ion.  As luck would have it,
the gamble paid off and not only did he move out of Tri, but he moved
Vie-Bud as well.  Since my army in Tri could retreat to Vie if
dislodged, this meant that I didn't need to protect Tri,
which also meant that I could move Ven-Tyr.  That left Ven open for a
build (putting three armies on Tri in S1902) and left Austria with
no builds in 1901.
<P>
Still playing riskily/aggressively, I decided not to take Tun in 1901,
since I was getting a build anyway, so that I could use the fleet in
Ion to move to Gre and bounce Turkey there.  A strong Turkey was my
biggest threat, knowing that Austria was already limping in 1901.
The bounce left Turkey with only one build in 1901 instead of two.  I
was hoping that a weak Turkey would be an appealing target for Russia,
who would then attack.  That didn't happen, but because he only got
one build, I was able to keep him bottled up in the Eastern Med for
several years.
We both built a second fleet in 1902, whereas if he had built two fleets
in 1901, he'd have forced his way out before I could stop him.
<P>
France waited a bit too long to decide that he had to stop me or the
game would be over.  In fairness to him, it's risky to abandon one
front for another in a gunboat game since you can't tell your enemy
that you want to make up to stop the big guy from winning.  In this
case, it wouldn't have mattered too much.  His enemy, instead of
realizing that he should back off to let France attack Italy, took
advantage of the opening and attacked, making it hard for France to
stop me when he otherwise might have had a shot at it.
<P>
I fully acknowledge a fair amount of chance was involved in the first
couple of years, but I'll take a little credit for playing a pretty good
game.  I got to 11 SCs before I went a year without a build.
<P>
As for the regular tournament, I had two eliminations and a one-center
survival.  Well, that's an improvement over my three eliminations at
WDC.  At this rate of improvement, I should be a Diplomacy Champion in
four or five decades!  Maybe I
should stick to gunboat Diplomacy.  It was fun, though.  Sorry you
couldn't make it, and I'm looking forward to WDC VIII in Chapel Hill,
which I hopefully will make it to.
<P>
AvalonCon was very underrepresented by PBEM people.  Actually, there
were a lot of PBEM people, but they were all from the CAT23 Diplomacy
community and not the r.g.d./judge community.  I sort of wish that
some of those people would get more involved with the newsgroup.  It's two
very similar communities of people who don't really talk to each other,
and I think it's a pity.
<P>
I met our friend from The Pouch, Tim Richardson,
who, incidentally, won a best Italy award.  I also met Rick
Desper, who was a very nice guy.  It was nice to finally attach a name
to the face, but I had to go and replace the mental image I had invented
since he didn't look anything like that (though I have no idea why not).
I met a couple of people whose names I recognized but just from browsing
Dip-related web pages when I check out the search engines, not from
actual correspondence via email or r.g.d.  A couple of people recognized
my name from The Pouch, but not nearly as many as knew yours.  Whenever
I mentioned The Pouch, I'd hear "Oh, Manus' site!"
<P>
Speaking of which, I wore The Pouch T-shirt for the gunboat tournament.
It didn't draw as much attention as I had expected.  I had expected to
have a few people come up to me and say something about it, but they
didn't.  I didn't want to wear it for the regular tournament.  I figured
that if I'm trying to convince somebody to be my friend, the last thing
he sees as I walk away should definitely not be the words "Stab you soon!"
<blockquote><i>
Two other reports from AvalonCon can be found elsewhere in this current
issue, so you may wonder why Simon's report is here in the Deposits.
I put it here because he raised a few points that I thought merited
comment.  First, the description of his game as Italy is reminiscent of
Leif Bergman's, <a href=/Zine/F1997M/Bergman/Italy.html>Go Fasta Go Fasta
Go Fasta</a>, also located in this issue.  Second, Simon mentions the Cat23
group, who just happen to be well-represented in this current issue as well.
(I too wonder why the two PBEM communities [judge and non-judge] are not
closer to each other, but happily I believe they are coming closer together.)
And finally, although I'm proud that my name is known for my humble
contributions, I'm a bit unhappy that Simon's isn't equally well known.  I
couldn't do it without him!

<HR>
<H4>From Jeff Serandos
(<a href=mailto:jserandos@pipeline.com>jserandos@pipeline.com</a>):</H4>
I had an idea for an interesting Payola
variant.  Call it the The Incorruptible Man.  At the start of the game, each
player can secretly tab one admiral or general as unbribeable.  As long as
the unit survives, it does not accept any bribes and instead moves as
ordered by the player.  That's essentially it, although there can be plenty
of variations on the theme.  What do you think?  Is there a Payola variant
like this?
<blockquote><i>
This is a new one indeed, and I like it.  Perhaps, however, each player could
select a single Incorruptible Man on each turn, rather than be limited to
only one at the start of the game.  For some reason (and since the theme
seems to be references out of these Deposits to elsewhere in this issue), this
idea brings to mind Simon's <a href=/Zine/F1997M/Szykman/Arpiesse.html>Arpiesse
Diplomacy</a>.  Check it out and maybe you'll see why my tired mind made
this connection, because at the time of this writing, I am too tired to
figure out why.

Mail Received Concerning
<a href=/DipPouch/Zine/W1995A/Tactics>The Library of Diplomacy Tactics</a>
</H3>
<HR>
<H4>From Graeme Ackland
(<a href=mailto:gja@ph.ed.ac.uk>gja@ph.ed.ac.uk</a>):</H4>
I was just reading through the tactics problems and found the
one that Manus calls his favorite --  asking why anyone would ever
order thus:
<blockquote><tt>
Country1: Unit A SUPPORT &lt;something&gt;.<BR>
Country1: Unit B -> A.
</tt></blockquote>
The answers so far related to nullifying an unwanted support or trick
an enemy.  Here's another one:  to establish a convoying fleet.
<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>
England:
<td><tt>F lon<BR>
A Edi<BR>
F Iri<BR>
F nth
<!tr><th align=left valign=top>
France:
<td><tt>F eng <BR>
F Bre<BR>
A pic<BR>
F por
<tr><th align=left valign=top>
Russia:
<td valign=top><tt>F NWS
<!tr><th align=left valign=top>
Germany:
<td><tt>F ska<BR>
F nwy
</table>
</blockquote>
England knows that Germany is about to attack Nth, that France will
support but at not at the risk of losing Eng.  Russia won't help
Germany but  is likely to try a sneak attack on Edi. Given this, it's not
hard to see that the enemy moves will be:
<P>
<blockquote>
<table>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>
Germany:
<td><tt>F ska - nth<BR>
F nwy SUPPORT  F ska - nth
<tr><th align=left valign=top>
France:
<td><tt>F eng CONVOY A pic - Lon<BR>
F bre SUPPORT F eng<BR>
A pic - Lon
<tr><th align=left valign=top>
Russia:
<td><tt>F NWS - Edi
</table>
</blockquote>
What can England do to save Nth and hang onto Edi?
<P>
Iri is useless, and Edi cannot risk moving, so the only support
for Nth is from London. But this is cut <b><i>unless</i></b> Nth
is a "convoying
fleet."  This can (only?) be achieved by:
<blockquote><table>
<tr><th align=left valign=top>
England:
<td><tt>F Lon SUPPORT Nth<BR>
A Edi -> nth -> Lon<BR>
F Iri HOLD<BR>
F nth CONVOY A Edi - Lon
</table>
</blockquote>
An alternative that maintains position is F nth CONVOY A Edi-Edi; A Edi-Edi
(I can't see any rule against this).
<blockquote><i>
I was an observer in game "goofy" on the USEF judge, where it
was conclusively proven that Edi-Edi is a valid convoy.  In point of fact,
the players executing the convoy sent the army completely around the island
no less than six times (the judge wouldn't go for more -- it's line length
was reached) before landing it back where it started.  Actually, the
</i>piece de resistance<i> was that the player making the move also ordered
<tt>Lvp-Edi</tt>, so the whole convoy bounced.  I don't know when I laughed
harder at a Diplomacy move.  If you ever have a chance, pull up a history
of game "goofy"; I highly recommend it. --Manus

<H3 align=center>From David Caldwell's e-zine <i>Festina Lente</i>,<br>
an excerpt from his personal history with Diplomacy</H3>
Around Christmas, (my family) received our regular dose of family
letters from around the world.  One such letter from a bunch of friends
down in Texas mentioned in a sentence buried within the letter, Diplomacy
and the Internet.  My family had only recently gotten Internet access
within the last month or so, so I went online and in the Alta-Vista web
browser, typed in "Diplomacy."  Within seconds, hundreds of links appeared
pertaining to the game.  Choosing one randomly, I chose the "Diplomatic
Pouch."  Accessing its <a href=/DipPouch/Online>Online Resources section</a>,
I went to the e-zine bank and
e-mailed Rich Goranson, who as the GM and publisher of <i>That's Armageddon</i>.
That was December 31.  On January 1, he e-mailed me back and I got into my
first PBEM game (Modern) and later signed up for African and Standard
gunboat.  As quickly as I had signed up for the games, I showed this
newfound treasure to the FTF club and they were fascinated.  Almost every
night I was online looking at Diplomacy stuff on the Net.  I ran across
past issues of The Diplomatic Pouch's Zine, past issues of <i>Diplomacy
World</i>
and the <i>Spring Offensive</i>.  Every time I came across a strategy article, I
would print it off.  So, at the end of January, I took all the articles and
made a book out of it, which I donated to the club (it sits in a five-inch
D-ring binder) and it is used to teach new players.  It holds
information from the fundamentals of Diplomacy, three "Openings" articles per
country, the Diplomacy Hit Parade, stalemate stuff and the poem
<a href=/DipPouch/Zine/W1996A/Wolf/poem.html><i>Juggernauty</i></a>.  I was
even more interested, more like fascinated by, the hundreds of variants
catalogued on <a href=/DipPouch/Online/variants.html>The Pouch's variants page. </a>
