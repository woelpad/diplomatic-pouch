<tr><td>In case you missed the <a href="/Zine/S1997M/Szykman/anna.html">explanation
(and photo)</a> back in the Spring 1997 Movement issue, it was suggested to me by Larry Peery,
that my daughter might be more fun to look at than me in a photo
accompanying my Zine articles, so I'm putting a new picture of her in
each issue.  Anna was born on March 6th, 1996; this photo
was taken near the end of July when she was about 16 1/2 months old.  She's got quite a sense of curiousity
