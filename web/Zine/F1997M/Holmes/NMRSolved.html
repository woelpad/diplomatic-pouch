I wasn't sure which brother amazed me more.  Mycroft,
for his insane claim that he picked up three centers in 1901,
despite having failed to submit Fall orders, or the great
detective, for his statement that he knew the position of
every unit at the end of 1901, from <a href=../S1997R/Holmes/NMR.html>
the little information we had given him</a>.
<p>
"But...how..." I managed to sputter out.
<p>
Holmes looked up from his book, with just the
slightest trace of impatience, it seemed.
"It's really quite elementary.  In Spring 1901, you moved your
fleet to Albania,..."
<p>
I cried, "That's right, I did!  But how did you know?
How did you even deduce which power Mycroft and I played?"
<p>
"Perhaps I should take it more slowly."  He set aside
the book, drew on his pipe, and slowly exhaled.  "You will
recall from <a href="../../S1995M/Woolley/Puzzle.html">The
Double Elimination Conundrum</a> that
there are only three powers which can be eliminated
in 1901: Austria, France, and Germany.
<p>
"The only way Germany can be eliminated in 1901 is
if the German fleet is involved in convoying a foreign
army to Kiel; otherwise, no foreign unit can reach Kiel
in 1901.  But as you fell into Civil Disorder in the
Fall, you could not have been eliminated that way.
<p>
"You cannot have been France, either, for you stated
that each of the other six powers picked up two neutral
centers in 1901.  But no power other than France can take
Spain and Portugal in 1901, unless convoyed by a French
fleet.  Thus, you must have been Austria."
<p>
"Yes, I guess that is simple," I admitted, "but the
entire board position!  Really!"
<p>
"The simple application of logic is all that is
required," explained Holmes.  "Let us begin with
some simple facts.  First, which powers must
have occupied which neutral centers?  All twelve
were taken after 1901, two each by the six other
powers.  Only France can have taken Iberia, and
only Italy can have taken Tunis.  Further, note
that the Italian fleet must be involved in capturing
Tunis -- either directly, or by convoying, and given
that, Italy cannot have taken Greece in 1901 (since
the Italian fleet would also be required for that).  The
only other neutral in Italy's range is Serbia, taken
by a Key Lepanto-like sequence of Venice to Trieste
to Serbia.
<P>
"Since Italy did not take Greece, Turkey
must have done so.  Turkey thus took only one of Bulgaria and
Rumania, with Russia taking the other; we will
leave the determination of which gets which for the
moment.  Of Scandanavia and the Low Countries, Russia
took one center, Germany two, and England two.
Likewise, we will leave this for the moment."
<p>
Holmes emptied his pipe and got up to pour himself a drink
as he continued.
<p>
"Let us turn our attention then to the units that
participated in your elimination.  There are only
four units that can occupy Austrian home centers in
1901: the German army in Munich, the Russian army
in Warsaw, and the two Italian armies.  The Italian
army which starts in Venice, as I have already pointed
out, must proceed to Serbia, so the army in Rome must
take Trieste; the German army must take Vienna, and the Russian
army must take Budapest.  Warsaw must therefore have moved to
Galicia in Spring 1901, and Munich to either Tyrolia
or Bohemia.
<p>
"We then analyze what we know of Mycroft's game.  The
position was the same as in your game after Spring 1901, with
Mycroft also playing Austria; yet he managed to pick
up three centers despite the Civil Disorder that he also
suffered in the Fall moves."
<p>
"But how can that be possible?" I blurted out.
<p>
"Really, Watson, I am surprised at you," chided Holmes.
"Have you forgotten that there is a phase between movements
and adjustments? Since Austria (or any power,
for that matter) cannot occupy three foreign home centers
or neutral centers in Spring 1901, his units which were not
so placed after the Spring moves must have been helpfully
dislodged by other powers, in such a way that they could
retreat into those centers."
<p>
"You will recall," added Mycroft, "that the business
on Dartmoor did not take long, and we returned in time
to retreat our dislodged units."
<p>
"Fat lot of good it did me," I mumbled.
<p>
Holmes sipped at his drink and continued.  "The army in Budapest can
take Serbia or Rumania easily enough in the Spring;
but the army that starts in Vienna -- which cannot in a single move reach
a supply center that would gain the Austrian a build -- will have to be
dislodged in the Fall.  This also applies to the Trieste fleet
for the following reason: because we
know that Italy's Venice to Trieste succeeded, Trieste
cannot have taken Venice in the Spring.  Additionally, we know
that the fleet cannot have been moved to the Adriatic, since
there cannot be two fleets adjacent to dislodge it.  So it must have gone to
Albania.
<p>
"But then, which two units <i>did</i> dislodge the fleet in
Albania, so that my brother could take Greece in the
Fall?  We know there is an Italian army in Trieste
which can move into Albania (in fact, the army <i>must</i> vacate Trieste to
ensure that Mycroft gets three builds).  But which unit supported
it?  The only possibility is the Italian fleet -- which
must therefore have been in the Ionian, and not the
Tyrrhenian, after Spring 1901."
<p>
"Astounding, Holmes!" I exclaimed.
<p>
"What, then, of the army that started in Vienna in
Mycroft's game?  Where did it go in the Spring?" Holmes asked
rhetorically.  "Galicia and Trieste are both occupied by other
units.  It can go to Budapest, but the only
units that can possibly dislodge it from there are
the armies in Galicia and Trieste, and we have
already seen that the army in Trieste was acting
in Albania.  We know, then, that the army cannot have been dislodged
from Budapest and thus, it must instead have been moved either to Bohemia
or Tyrolia.  (Recall that we know from your game, Watson, that the
German army in Munich must have occupied the other of these two spots.)
From either of those locations it might have been dislodged to
take a foreign center.
<p>
"That is all we need to learn from Mycroft's game,
and we now return our attention to yours..." began
Holmes.
<p>
But I had to interrupt.  I had been trying to think ahead to see
where Holmes was going, but I had run into a wall.  "I can see how
you might determine the actions in the North, since I
did mention the odd Spring 1902 moves there, but how
will you possibly deduce the French moves from what
we've said?  There are several different ways by
which France might take Spain and Portugal!"
<p>
"Quite right," replied Holmes, "except that you mentioned that
you had been invaded by <em>four</em> other powers in 1901.  We
have seen that Italy, Germany, and Russia each took one
of your home centers.  But while Turkey is considered
a close neighbor to Austria, the fact is that Turkey
cannot reach any Austrian province in 1901.  The only
other power that can do so is France, by moving Marseilles
to Piedmont and then to Tyrolia.  In fact, from this we can
deduce that you moved to Bohemia and Germany to Tyrolia,
and not vice-versa.  All other units adjacent to Tyrolia -- the
German army and two Italian armies -- were otherwise occupied
in the Fall, and cannot have supported a French attack there.
Given that Marseilles moved east, France must have moved
Brest to the Mid-Atlantic and then to Portugal, while
Paris moved to Gascony and then to Spain."
<p>
"What about my army that started in Budapest?" I challenged.
"You still haven't figured out whether I moved it to Serbia
or Rumania."
<p>
"<i>Au contraire.</i>  To whichever of the two you moved, your army must
have been dislodged, since
you did not survive 1901.  The Italian army in Trieste
moved into Serbia; but this could not have been a supported move,
since the Turkish army in Bulgaria had, in your game, to moved to Greece.
Therefore,
you moved to Rumania.  Since the Russian army in Galicia took
Budapest in the Fall, the two units that dislodged you were the two
fleets; the Russian in Sevastopol, and the Turkish in
the Black Sea.  The Turk supported the Russian, and not
vice versa; otherwise, the Turk would either have picked
up three neutral centers or Bulgaria or Greece
would have remained untaken; both of these are contrary to your
statements about the game.  Additionally, you stated that all units of
the other six powers had taken leave of their home countries
by the end of the Fall moves, so Sevastopol could not have simply 
supported the attack.
<p>
"And thus we return to the Low Countries and Scandanavia,
which we neglected earlier.  Recall that Russia will
take one of these, and Germany and England two apiece.  You
did mention the unusual Spring 1902 moves, wherein England
supported Russian attacks on Kiel and Holland.  How can
such a situation have arisen?  The Russian army that starts
in Warsaw is now, as we know, in Budapest.  So the
northern Russian fleet and the army that starts in
Moscow must be the units involved in the attack on Germany.  Now, an
army can be convoyed, but a fleet cannot, so the Russian
fleet must be adjacent to either Kiel or Holland after
Fall 1901.  The only way this can happen is if it is in
the Baltic Sea."
<p>
"I admire your use of five consecutive two-letter words starting
with <i>i</i>," I teased Holmes, "but aren't you neglecting the
possibility that Russia might have built an army in St. Petersburg,
and used it in one of the attacks?"
<p>
"Not so.  If such an army were to be convoyed into Kiel,
it would have to be via a Russian fleet in Bothnia and
a German fleet in the Baltic; but since the German army
in Munich took Vienna, the German fleet must have occupied
a neutral centre at the end of 1901.  Conversely, were the
army to be convoyed to Holland, it would have to be via
the Barents Sea; but the only unit that might be there
is an English fleet, and we know that both English fleets
had to have been involved in taking neutrals in the Fall
(meaning they could not be present in the Barents Sea at
the commencement of the Spring 1902 moves).
<p>
"Since the Russian fleet was in the Baltic, the northern
neutral obtained by Russia had to have been Norway, taken
by the army that started in Moscow.  The only remaining
unit that can have reached Sweden is the German fleet.
<p>
"The German army starting in Berlin cannot have reached
Belgium, so England must have taken it; England and
Germany thus split Denmark and Holland. From this we can
conclude that England's fleets moved into the Channel and the North Sea in
Spring 1901.  Holland or Denmark had to be taken
by the English <b>army</b>, since the North Sea fleet
stayed there to convoy the Russian army into
Holland the following Spring, and
the Channel fleet moved to Belgium."
<p>
"But which was it Holmes?" I asked, goading him,
"Denmark or Holland?"
<p>
"Denmark, of course.  You stated that England supported
Russia into Holland and Kiel in Spring 1902.  The
North Sea fleet was convoying, so the Belgium fleet
provided support into Holland, and the army in Denmark provided
support for Russia's fleet move into Kiel.
When you say that England supported Russia into Kiel,
I take that to mean a successful support; if the army
had been in Holland, its support would have been cut
by the convoyed attack of the Russian army from Norway."
<p>
"Quite incredible!" I praised Holmes, "Not only do you
know the entire board position after the Fall moves,
as you claimed, but after the Spring 1901 moves as well!"
<p>
But Holmes merely said, "Hmm..." and after a moment went
on.  
<p>
"Still, Watson," he admonished, "in spite of my
brother's success with it, I would hardly call Trieste
to Albania, Vienna to Bohemia, and Budapest to Rumania
'a reasonable enough opening.'"
<p>
But at this point Mycroft, Sherlock's older brother (and, according to my friend,
the more intelligent of the two, although I confess I have never been able to
tell the difference) interjected.  "He's not the
only one who's been exaggerating.  After all, you stated
you could tell us 'what the board looked like at the end
of 1901.'  Now of course you cannot deduce the builds from
what we have told you...."
<p>
"I shall call that 'the beginning of 1902,' not 'the end of 1901,'"
objected Holmes.
<p>
"Semantics," said Mycroft.  "But even so, you do not know
the state of the board following the retreats, for Watson
may have retreated his dislodged unit either to Galicia
or Ukraine."
<p>
"You have me there," conceded Holmes with an amused grin.

<p>
As for me, I was furious with myself for not realizing
that Mycroft could capture centers in the retreat phase and
for not conducting any diplomacy to cover the possibility of Civil
Disorder.  I did not delude myself into thinking that I
would have done as well as Mycroft, but at least I might
have survived a few years.  I vowed to do better in
the future, both at playing and at analyzing the
cases on which Holmes' assistance was sought.
<p>
The former I did the very next week at the Calhamer Club,
joining in a two-way draw in 1914 with a fine chap
by the name of Steven Kucera<a href="#sk">*</a> (although neither of
the brothers were playing at my board).
I had a chance at the latter several months later, in an adventure known as
<a href="Borders.html">The Case of the Remaining Border</a>....
