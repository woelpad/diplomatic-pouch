<P>
Perhaps a great many articles have been written by newbies
regarding their introduction into the world of Diplomacy.  Since I
haven't been around long enough to find many of those articles, I
decided to write about some of my own first impressions.
<P>
I may be a little unique to the hobby because of my young age.
By the time this article is published, I will have just turned
fifteen.
I have long liked playing games of all sorts, but have always had trouble
finding someone to play with.  Being a teenager perhaps a little too
concerned with my image,  I never joined one of the (considered by
outsiders to be nerdy) gaming clubs at school where I could possibly
find someone to take on.  It wasn't until <i>[a certain collectible
card game -- name removed by the editor]</i>
came along that a game was considered to be something cool
to do.
<P>
Realizing this was my chance to shine, I became one of the
founders of the hobby at my school.  The revised edition had just
come
out, and I bought up cards like crazy.  And for months, the game
thrived
and I loved it.  I knew what every card made was and did, and
understood
every compexity of the game.   Then, <font size=-2>Wizards of the Coast</font>,
the company
that gave life to the game, killed it.  I suppose  they wanted to make
even more money, so they came out with some so-called "expansion
sets."
I tried to keep up with the first one, but expansion after expansion
came and blew me away.  Soon the game I had understood
completely
was foreign to me.  I quit.  And again I was a gamer without a game.
<P>
After this, I forgot about games for a year, and concentrated on
other hobbies I had.  My family always had a computer, but I never
learned the ins and outs of it.  I sat down and started editing config
files, and before I knew it I was hooked.  The thing that intrigued me
most was this "Internet" thing that had suddenly become the craze.
I
live in one of the very rural
sections of New Jersey, though, and each call to a service provider
would
have been a toll call.  So I went without.  Then one day a little
package with a disk came in the mail announcing that Sprint was going
to
become a local service provider in my area.
<P>
I convinced my parents to sign up for a month, and began my
first baby steps into the land of the Internet.  At first I delved
into
the sports and teen places on the 'Net.  It was all fascinating at
first,
but eventually I began to think that the Internet was a useless tool
after all.  There wasn't much except getting information that it was
good
for.  So I began to run down the category listings on Yahoo where
maybe
I could find something interesting.  When I got down to the games
button, I clicked on it, but didn't expect to find much.  At first I
went to the games I knew.  I liked Risk, but there were
never enough players around to get a good game going, plus too much
luck
was involved.  I liked Axis and Allies, but there were far too many
pieces
to worry about.  There was also a game named Diplomacy listed that I
had
heard a little about.  A game with no luck, one that involved negotiating.
Sounded good to me.
<P>
A whole bunch of Diplomacy pages appeared when I made that
fateful double-click.  I believe I started from the alphabetical beginning:
Annund Rannestad's "Diplomacy Central."  I read the first few introductory
lines
and thought, "Oh great, another good game that I don't have enough
players for."  But then it mentioned something about play by e-mail,
and
of "judges" set up all over the 'Net to host games.  I was interested.  I
delved further, and found strange disscusions on how to join a judge,
and things looking like "F&nbsp;Ank-Bla."
<P>
That night, my family took a trip to a nice little town called
New Hope, across the Delaware River.  There was a store there called,
"Toys for Men." It turned out not to be some X-rated store, but a
place
that sold all kinds of strategy games and such.  I went in and
searched
for Diplomacy.
<P>
I found it, in both a deluxe and regular version.  The back of
the box described it as a game of international intrigue.  I was
certainly intrigued.  I decided to buy the deluxe version, even though
it was twenty dollars more. It said it came with a lengthy rulebook
that helped with important strategies.
<P>
When I got home, I tore open the plastic and opened the game box.
I took everything out.  It contained a gameboard, some wood pieces,
stickers, and a rulebook.  Was this what I had just paid fifty bucks
for?
A little disappointed with the lack of "stuff" that came with the game,
I
delved into the rulebook.
<P>
Almost instantly I was hooked.  Most games that claimed to
involve lots of strategy had rules that were impossible to learn.
Most
games that claimed to be easy to play turned out to be no fun.  But
Diplomacy seemed to have it all.  Simple rules that I understood fully
after the first reading of the rulebook.  In addition, the game involved
interaction with the other players, something I had always considered
to
be the thing that made a game fun.  Before Diplomacy, Risk had always
been my favorite game.  Not that it was so
great, but I enjoyed making treaties with other players, then taking
over Australia anyway.  But the rules of Diplomacy blew away Risk.  No
luck, and plenty of negotiations.
<P>
The  next morning I got on the Internet, intent on finding out
exactly what these play-by-email games were.  I soon discovered there
were two types of e-mail games, ones operated by judges, and ones GM'ed by
real
humans.  Knowing that I would surely have lots of questions to ask
someone, I opted for a human-run game.  The first site I came across
that
ran the types of games I wanted was "Cat-23."  They had an introductory
paragraph at the top of their frontdoor page, describing themselves as
a
community of gameplayers, who play hard and fierce, but who also have fun
and
who got to know each other.  This was exactly what I was looking for.
<P>
Here I am, a few weeks after subscribing to the Cat-23 listserver.
I have entered a new game as Turkey, and I'm loving it.  I even think
I'm
doing quite well so far.  I managed two builds the first year after a
heroic takeover of Sevastopol that got me a permanent Russian enemy.
Of
course, my supposed allies may turn on me any time now and crush me,
but
that's what makes me love this game.  I try to write interesting
letters
to all the other players, and I think it may be one reason why they
write me back.  After Russia moved his fleet into Armenia the first
turn
(provoking my own attack on Sevastopol) I even made a public
Declaration of War against the Russians, describing all the unjustices they
were
commiting.  I never got to do that in Risk!
<P>
I would like to thank all the people who created and who support
this hobby
on the Internet, and who set up places like Cat-23.  When school starts
again, I'll still keep a low profile about my love of gaming, but now
there's a place where I can have the ultimate gaming experience of my
life in the secrecy of my own home.  The Internet has created at least
one new Diplomacy player for many years to come.
