<H3>Introduction</H3>

I decided to write this article because I've played quite a few Colonial
games now, face to face and e-mail, and I've only seen one article dealing
with strategy for Colonial, so I feel confident enough to give my own
opinion.  I've played every power at least once, and I've won with Britain,
Japan and Holland.
<P>
Generally, any Diplomacy player can easily adapt to Colonial -- all the
same rules apply.  In addition, the judge does not currently support any of the
optional rules included in the boxed game.  However, Colonial does tend to
slightly favor a more aggressive, tactical style of play because of the low
ratio of centers to open spaces, and the greater separation between powers.


<H3>Ranking of the Powers</H3>

Unlike original Diplomacy, the starting positions of the different
powers are not balanced, or even close.  Nevertheless, it is still possible
to win as each power, and it still takes superior strategy
to do so.
<P>
The table below is a rough ranking of the powers by growth and security and
overall.  Growth is the ability to increase the number of units.  Security
is the likelihood you will survive to the end of the game.  In the overall
category, solo victories are valued most, with consideration for draws.  I
have not drawn upon statistics to support this guide -- it is purely opinion
of the author.  It assumes a white/partial press game and an absence of the
TSR and the other optional rules.  In a nopress game, security would be more
highly valued.

<H3>Britain</H3>

Britain starts the game with the most units and the greatest potential for
growth.  In fact, Britain usually gets four builds in the first year.  But
don't assume that Britain is leading the game, even if it has a large
superiority in units.  Britain usually has a tough time in the mid-game, and
I even consider it one of the more vulnerable powers.  But if it does make
it through the mid-game with its superiority of units intact, it has an
excellent chance at a solo victory.  Pay special attention to Holland - it
is usually the power that delivers the critical blow to Britain.  One more
note: don't build in Singapore or Hong Kong unless strongly allied with
France.

<H3>China</H3>

China may seem like a powerful country because of its five starting units
and a wealth of nearby centers.  But do not be deceived.  China suffers
because of its central location and because it's the usual target of
 Japan,
an enemy it cannot defeat, only divert.  China has an upward battle the
whole game.

<H3>France</H3>

You may look in dismay at your three starting units, but don't despair.
France can usually get two builds in the first year, and with a little luck
can get two more the next year.  After that, gains are much more difficult.
But France is a survivor and can get a break.  Diplomacy is by far its most
effective tool.

<H3>Holland</H3>

When played properly Holland can almost always do well because both of it's
immediate neighbors, Britain and France, should want peace.  Holland can
then walk into four open centers (Sarawak, New Guinea, Davao and Cebu)
without opposition.  However, it is important that Singapore is dealt with
early, because it is a constant source of aggravation.  Keep in mind that a
conflict with Britain is almost inevitable, even if an early peace is
advantageous for both powers.

<H3>Japan</H3>

There is no excuse for doing poorly as Japan.  Japan is in a corner position
almost impenetrable to outsiders, and it has excellent potential for growth.
Japan can usually take three centers unopposed -- Sakhalin, Formosa, and
Fusan.  When playing Japan, aggression is rewarded.  While Japan is a naval
power, it is important to build armies and have a substantial presence on
the mainland, because if Holland and France form a solid block, as they
should, Japan will not be able to make much progress in the South.

<H3>Russia</H3>

Unfortunately, Russia is irreparably divided by the absence of the Trans
Siberian Railway.  In the East, the situation is barely salvageable.  Under
rare circumstances, an alliance with Japan may work, at the expense of
China.  But I would give China Vlad and Pt. Arthur for Mongolia.  If China
declines, support him just to slow down Japan.  It is in the West that
Russia makes its gains.  A profitable campaign against Turkey is very
feasible.  Followed by a timely stab of Britain, Russia will be in an
excellent position for the rest of the game.  But it is a feat easier said
than done.

<H3>Turkey</H3>

If you have read everything up to this point, you probably know my opinion
about Turkey.  The only way Turkey can conceivably do well is if it allies
with Russia.  Unfortunately, Britain is a much better ally for Russia.
However, there is a small flicker of light at the end of the tunnel --
 Turkey
can be quite difficult to kill once it gets six or more units.  That's
assuming you can convince Britain and Russia to keep their distance for the
first few turns.  Good luck.

<H3>Conclusion</H3>

You may think that this article is a bit narrow-minded in its advice.  I
agree.  I wrote this article to be a general guide; to tell you what to look
for when playing one of the powers in Colonial Diplomacy.  Of course there
will be circumstances that raise argument against some the advice given, but
I believe that it will do more help than harm, even if it only encourages
people to study the board.  I would be happy to write more in-depth articles
if there are players that are interested.
