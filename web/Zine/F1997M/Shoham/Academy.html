<H3>Introduction</H3>
This issue I present the game <tt>gnat</tt>, the very first e-mail
diplomacy game I played (in 1992). I won as Russia in 1905.  As usual,
you can get an idea of how the game went by looking at the
<a href=summary.html>game summary</a>.  Gnat was
played on the (late) University of Washington Judge, and since I have preserved only
my own End Of Game statement, we can get right to it.

<P>
Well, hello everybody and thanks for a fine - and fast - game.
This was my very first PBeM Diplomacy game, and my first dip game in some
years. I was quite gratified to win it. The experience of PBeM turned out to
be quite different from FTF, I think PBeM is superior (I think I would
have held that viewpoint even had I done poorly). The game proved to be
a learning experience, with many PBeM-specific technique and strategies
making themselves apparent only by mid-game.
<P>
Since the game was short, I might as well make the end-of-game report long.
When the game began, I decided to lobby all-out for a three-way alliance
with Austria-Hungary (AH) and Germany. These two oft-eliminated powers
would be happy to have the Russian bear off their back and concentrate
on the outside powers (where many supply centers are to be found). An
ulterior motive I had was to divide the war to two fronts: Balkan (where
I and AH fight the Turks, and maybe the Italians) and Atlantic (where
Germany and I fight Brits and      French). If supply centers are to be
divided "equally" in each front, than I would grow twice as fast as my
allies. I could even afford to be generous and take slightly less than
half the spoils in each front. I was happy Germany and AH joined such an
alliance. We called it the Central Alliance.
<P>
The alliance was to be <b>very</b> tight. We would keep all border provinces
demilitarized.  We freely make deals with the enemies "against" other
alliance members, but we keep our allies fully informed of our communications
with the enemies!!! The other four powers are to think that the alliance is
extremely fragile, with its members constantly looking for backstab
opportunities. That way, we do not deter our enemies from infighting
amongst themselves, from allying with some of us against others, from
revealing their plans against one alliance member to another, or from
panicking when we grow too fast (since we "counter-balance" each other).
<P>
I "published" the "Central Alliance Gazettes," a newsletter summarizing events,
strategies, outlook, etc. on every turn. The Gazettes even had an editorial and
a humor section. I spent all my diplomatic energy maintaining the alliance.
<P>
Just to make sure my allies had no second thoughts, I encouraged their neighbors
to attack them. I "signed" a non-aggression pact with Turkey that kept the
Black Sea and Armenia a demilitarized zone and promised not to interfere with
Turkish control of Bulgaria.
<P>
With all my fronts peaceful, and needing to find outlet for my aggressive
capabilities (tendencies?) I sent England a threatening letter to stay away from
Norway. England (properly) did not heed my warning and took Norway, using a
second fleet (that could have harassed Germany) to support the occupation.
<P>
The first year results were quite encouraging for the Central Alliance: we all
kept our word religiously, we all kept each other fully informed of our
communications with the enemies, we each gained two supply centers (SC)
as opposed to one each for our four enemies. The alliance was at 16 SC,
the same as the other four powers. Turkey was isolated, and ripe for
destruction; Italy and France where hostile to each other. The only
serious resistance was offered by the Anglo-French counter-alliance.
<P>
The second-year plan was for me and AH to destroy Turkey (easy) and for me to
pin down (75% of) the British war machine in a Scandinavian stalemate while
the Germans, with the (welcomed, but not counted on) help of the Italians,
fight the French.  The Western front
would more or less stay static while Turkey was destroyed -- decisively
tilting the SC count in favor of the alliance.
<P>
But then I got a surprising letter from Turkey. In it he outlined a message he
got from AH that -- in general terms -- described the coming attack on Turkey.
As this letter used some of <b>my</b> lingo, it was clearly not a "lucky-guess"
fabrication by Turkey, but a true AH leak. At that moment I decided that AH
could never again be a trusted member of a tight alliance and should be
extinguished as rapidly as possible. A quick stab with Turkish help should
restore the alliance (minus AH) supply center count rapidly.
The only worry I had was how to stab AH without worrying Germany out of
continued cooperation. Without revealing the source of my suspicions, I
asked Germany (with whom I had very frequent communications throughout
the game) if AH was "still with us." He had no reason to think otherwise.
Concluding that the Germans had too much resistance on the Atlantic
front to co-conspire with AH against me, I told Germany of my worries.
Now he would not be surprised when AH is backstabbed. The backstab
went well, except that AH proved loyal to the Central Alliance after
all! His message to Turkey was a true ruse that he failed to inform the
alliance about (or changed his mind about -- thinking the whole thing was
a harmless aside)!
<P>
On the western front, England failed to heed my continuous stream of hostile
messages and did not support their Norway army -- it was destroyed.
All this gave me plenty of wiggle room. 
<P>
On the Atlantic front, I offered peace to England (now that I got Norway)
and asked if I could join the anti-German coalition. I carefully haggled over
my price, gave sound tactical advice, suggested to start the alliance with
a few trust-building measures, before going gung-ho and "allowed" myself
to be convinced to skip that stage. All that time, I was keeping Germany
<b>fully</b> informed of my communications!
<P>
England was totally spoofed. The Germans knew all their moves in advance, and
they believed all the moves I told them the Germans are about to make, and the
support I was to give them. Results: England went from four to two SC, and
isolated units (leading to an abandonment).
<P>
On the Balkan front, I apologized to AH for the backstab, explaining the way
it came about (and pointing out the dangers in not keeping your allies informed
of ruses you may be planting with the enemies). I told him the move that Turkey,
Italy, and I were planning to do (which was accurate -- in case he got
verification from someone else), and that I intend to <b>follow</b> it. I
also gave him the <b>only</b>
set of counter-moves that would sabotage our moves. I said that if he
followed that counter-move (and hence proved to be reliable, while
still having some firepower), the Central Alliance would be
reestablished. I asked Germany to lobby AH on this plan's behalf. Having
convinced AH to do as I suggested, I went on a total offensive against
Turkey. AH could hardly complain that I did not do as I promised, since
he got a SC he did not count on, and was about to get a second. (This
was a rather unusual Diplomacy situation: I deliberately promised an
ally <b>less</b> than I intended to deliver -- for fear of a leak.)
<P>
Spring of 1903 was a turn during which I dictated the moves of all seven powers!
With AH's full trust regained, and with AH not having the firepower to
both advance on Turkey (keeping with the "renewed" Central Alliance) and
watch his back, I backstabbed him again (recall, I decided never to
trust AH again) while continuing (with AH help) the anti-Turkish
offensive. I also landed an army in England. Making all the guesses
right, I reduced England to a single SC, and AH and Turkey to two SC's each
while getting five builds! (AH abandoned, soon followed by Italy.)
<P>
The only thing that could stop me now is if <b>all</b> six other players
allied against me <b>very tightly</b> (i.e., allow each other to pass
through their home SC's!).  To make
sure that (unlikely anyhow) did not come to be, I began a systematic leaking
campaign. Not so much to keep Germany (the only other Power with a sizable
force) busy, as to make sure deep trust could never develop among the other
powers if they become aware of each other's treachery. (I would suggest to power
A a ruse against country B, and warn country B of it. Both countries now trust,
but fear, me. Neither country now trusts the other.)
<P>
Well, the Germans were kept busy and could not contemplate any backstab. I was
able to (using routine moves) finish off Turkey, AH, and England to get the
victory condition! (Promising separately each of those mini-powers that I
would spare them if they cooperated -- since all they had to lose was a turn -- I
finished them off a turn early!)
<P>
On the very last turn, when a <b>forced</b> win (in fact, a forced win with
19 SC's, and three 50% chances for additional SC's) was available, Italy
suggested that it would be funny if he ended the game with his units at their
starting positions.
<P>
Building on that idea,
I pointed out that if we all cooperated we could have an unusual ending
for everybody. Well, everybody did cooperate except for France,  who
spoiled some of the fun -- <b>shame on you France!</b>
<ul>
<li>Austria ended up with a supply center, but no units and no build center!
<li>France would have ended up the second most powerful power in Europe with no two adjacent units, and with all other powers (that have units) occupying
French soil; but he didn't cooperate, so it didn't happen.
<li>Germany would have had the spectacular fall from eight to one supply
center in the last turn, but he only lost five (some due to French lack of
cooperation, one due to me goofing when I gave the set of moves).
<li>Italy failed to regain its original position because of French
non-cooperation.
<li>Russia (myself) won in five years, with 21 SC. It would have been 22, have
I not goofed, or even 23 had the French cooperated.
</ul>
All in all, this was a very lively game. I tried to make it even more lively
with the CNN spoofs in the first few turns (CNN style coverage of the fighting,
complete with "on the scene reporting," interviews with generals and
politicians, background reports, newsflashes, technical difficulties,
commentary by analysts, and reactions in the U.S.). The Italian player
joined in the fun by providing transcripts of the Pope's speeches as did an
Observer (who is a personal friend of mine) who provided Reuters style
coverage.
<P>
Well, thanks again for playing.
