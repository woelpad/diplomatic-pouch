Over recent months I've been amassing a list of contacts of people
interested in playing face-to-face Diplomacy in Auckland, New Zealand, with a
view to forming The Auckland Diplomacy Club. Things started reaching a
critical mass in June, with enough interest to get our first game
scheduled. This was in no small measure due to the help from a couple of
people who I would like to thank.
<P> 
<a href=mailto:bobblanchett@iname.com>Bob Blanchett</a> is an Aussie Dipper
who set up
the OzDip mailing list and the private ANZAC judge AUME. The mailing
list is for the discussion and organisation of the hobby 'Down Under'
(Australia and New Zealand primarily). The list has been invaluable in
providing me with a network of contacts, and some wise veterans of the
hobby in Australia to bounce ideas off. Thanks to "the Mafia" for their
input and polite tips. AUME is a private judge that runs games that are
restricted to ANZAC players only. This so we don't have the problem of
not being awake at the same time as all the players stateside or in
Europe. If anyone is interested in the mailing list, email Bob, or me
we'd be happy to get you involved. A <B>big</b> thank you to Bob for the effort
he's put in to set up both the list and the judge.
<P>
The OzDip list is can be subscribed to by sending mail to
<a href=mailto:majordomo@thingy.apana.org.au>majordomo@thingy.apana.org.au</a>
with the message body "<tt>subscribe ozdip-l</tt>".
<P>
Secondly, Brendan Whyte, the publisher of <i>Damn the Consequences</i> also
furnished me with a list of contacts that I think will form the core of
the Auckland Diplomacy Club. A great zine, Brendan, particularly the
quizzes! Thanks for your help too.
<P>
Now -- with those important formalities out of the way -- a review of our
first meeting. We met in the lower common room at the University of
Auckland on Sunday, June 29 and set up in a corner that the Strategists
and Tacticians Guild were not using. (I am in negotiations at the moment
with the Auckland Chess Club to share their facilities for future
meetings.) Present at this auspicious occasion were Bevan and Leon
Quidding, Andrew Ward, Daniel Hurley and his friend Simon, myself, and a
friend of mine, Brian Wolstenholme, who was playing his first game of
Diplomacy.
<P>
After drawing for countries, we got going. Playing France, I got three
builds: Spain, Portugal, and Munich! Oops! Tall Poppy Syndrome followed.
Austria (Andrew) and Italy (Brian) seemed to have agreed to co-operate,
while Turkey was playing cautiously in the early going. Bevan (as
Germany) was pushing for a Sealion opening, but I was keen to keep
Daniel the Englander on my side and attack Germany. Leon (Russia) opened
with A&nbsp;MOS-STP, F&nbsp;STP(sc)-FIN!, A&nbsp;WAR-GAL (and he got it!)
and F&nbsp;SEV&nbsp;H. He followed this with F&nbsp;FIN-SWE, A&nbsp;STP-FIN!!!
Then he built A&nbsp;STP!!!! I can safely say I've never seen that before.
<P>
Later, in discussion on the OzDip mailing list, Ken Sproat aked why the
initial move from St. Petersburg to Finland.
<P>
That question was on my mind too. I'd grown up with the attitude
"Give me one good reason not to go to Gulf of Bothnia." In fact, my attitude to
Russian Openings, until Leon played this, was
"nine times out of ten you order F&nbsp;STP(sc)-GOB, and on the tenth occasion,
you go to the Gulf of Bothnia instead." Having spoken to Leon about his
opening briefly though, I've been converted to his line of thinking. Not
as a staple approach to Russian openings, but as a valid option to
consider. His reasoning (possibly somewhat modified by my views by now)
was this:
<blockquote><i>
Often people ask, "Why go to Finland or Livonia, when everything you can
achieve from there you can just as well achieve from the Gulf of Bothnia,
and more?" Interestingly, the reason is the very
"and more!" bit that was central to the questioner's reasoning! As
Russia, one of you're objectives in the first year is to try and swing it
that Germany does not bounce you in Sweden. I approached Germany
before the Spring 1901 moves and said this: "If I go to the Gulf, you then
have to worry about me refusing the bounce in Sweden and going for the Baltic
instead and encouraging England to move F&nbsp;NTH-DEN at the
same time, right? Well, if I go to Finland instead of the Gulf in the Spring,
you're relieved of that implied security threat. In return, how about you
either agree not to bounce me out of Sweden or even not take Denmark until
the Fall (if England opens south or west; this will relieve my own concern
about the bounce)?"
<P>
Now I'm not saying that's going to work every time, and that you're
never going to get burnt by Germany saying, "Yes, yes! Go to Finland!"
and then bouncing you in Sweden anyway. Few openings, if any, are
guaranteed in Diplomacy and this is no exception. It relies on you
judging Germany right. If you think the offer of one fewer threat is
likely to tickle the Kaiser's fancy I reckon this is a good tack to try.
<P>
Certainly if you pull it off it garners a good degree of trust with
Germany, who I say (as a disciple of Stephen Agar) is your number one
target in the midgame; sow the
seeds of trust early, and reap the benefits of a well timed scything stab
at harvest time.
</i></blockquote>
Not a lot developed over the next couple of years, as England and France
pressed Germany to the point of elimination, and Russia grew alarmingly.
Brian, the newcomer, was making steady progress as Italy, and by the lunch
break had eight units, holding Italy, Tunis, Spain, Portugal and Marseilles.
Needless to say, I wasn't prospering as France. Faced with attack from
the Italians, I made peace with Germany. About this time Austria imploded
and a strong R/T alliance emerged. I tried to get a Western Triple together to
hold off the threat from the east. Italy kept growing, and made an
alliance with Germany. Yep, I was toast! Germany and Italy both grew, and
when we had to call a time draw, Italy had 11 units and was holding a
stalemate line (just) against the Turk (seven SC's) and the Russian (who had
grown to nine SC's). Germany was holding the Russian north of Switzerland,
with the help of England and my sole surviving French unit in Berlin.
<P>
What would have happened if the game had been played out was anyone's
guess. Alliances had been very fluid -- probably a result of seven relatively
unacquainted players. Germany had gotten me back for taking Munich in 1901,
and Italy had finally realised the importance of heading east. Leon (the
Russian player) was looking quite good for further expansion in
Scandinavia, but was sure to be fiercely opposed by his brother and his
German forces. Sultan Simon had flourished after a slow start, and was
eagerly pressing Italy from Greece, the Aegean, Eastern Mediterranean, and
Trieste, the two of them swapping the Ionian Sea between their equally
equipped navies. We all had a ball, and we left looking forward to our second
meeting at the end of July.
<P>
Anyone in the Auckland area keen to join us in our fledgling club is
most welcome. We intend to get together every four weeks, and I hoped to
have enough faces for two boards at our July meeting.
