Avalon Con was a load of fun.  I have never before played that much
Diplomacy in one weekend.  Three full-length games, plus one Gunboat game
on Saturday evening.
<P>
My first game went pretty well.  I landed Germany, one of my better
countries.  I got to meet Simon Szykman, Pouch publisher and Dip
presence, who was playing Italy.  I'm not so great at remembering names:
Mike Tibbs was Russia, Austria and Turkey were Mark and Vince.
I don't remember England's name (he didn't last long), and France was
Rex Martin.  Had I known at the beginning of the game that Rex was one of
the original designers of the game, and an employee of Avalon Hill, I probably
would have been even more nervous than I was when I started.  Nervousness
exacerbates a tremor I have, so at the beginning of the game I am convinced
everybody thought I was nuts.
<P>
The game went pretty well, with E/F, R/T, and central powers scrambling.
Due to some unusual builds (only one fleet for England and zero for
France in 1901), England was quickly overwhelmed.  A/I stalemated R/T until
the Russians landed in Ankara, broke the A/I alliance, and overwhelmed
Austria.  Italy kept France in check until the Turks broke lose.
Austria went nuts and tried to invade Germany, but had his supply lines
destroyed, so only one army made it.  I abandoned the Vaterland and started
sinking Russian fleets in Scandanavia (one...two...three...)
<P>
The game was timed to end after between 6 to 8 hours, at which point any
coalition that controls 29 SCs can decide who shares the draw.  As we passed
the 7.5 hour mark, France, Russia, and Turkey were working together to
get me down to five SC's so that they could exclude me.  Austria and Italy (1
SC each)
were trying to help me stay at six for grins and giggles.  The very last move
consisted of the Austrian Army in Ruhr moving to a vacant Holland (my SC) while
my fleets in Denmark and North Sea cut the possible supports (from the Russian
Army Kiel and the French Army Belgium) so that neither could make an attack
stronger than the Austrian attack.  I survived the year with six SCs, and time
was called less than a minute later.  So I got a share of a four-way draw.
<P>
My second game, the next day, featured a Rick & Rick alliance between
my Russia and Rick Copeland(?)'s Turkey.  We were doing crazy things
in the Balkans, but we missed out when we took Greece instead of the
Ionian in 1902.  Italy replaced lost forces with a couple of fleets and
Turkey was boxed in.  In the West, a Sealion crushed England in three
years, but this was followed shortly by a stab by France of Germany.
I was attacking Germany, sort of from necessity, but he had attacked me
in Scandanavia, so my SC's stayed even.   Just as my armies were about
to swing into Bohemia and Tyrolia, though, which would have crushed Austria
completely,
the smooth Austrian talker convinced Other Rick to stab (a decision he
later admitted was wrong).  Italy was playing a meta-game strategy: to
try to ensure that his France from the previous day ranked well, he
abandoned the boot in order to surround France with three fleets.  Austria,
Germany, and I were mucking about in Germany while I was telling Other
Rick "Look, you can
take Sevastapol, but not anything else, so why not stab Austria and go
for the big gains?"  He eventually did this, as France carried secret messages
to me to ensure that Austria was surprised.  The final move saw Italy wiped
out as A/I grabbed the boot, Germany wandering around away from the homeland,
and my army taking Rumania with Turkish support.  At this point, England
and Italy were dead, Germany was a wreck, and although Austria and I each
controlled 6 SC's, neither of us had a single fleet.  We called it a two-way
(FT) and hit the bar early.
<P>
The gunboat tournament was okay, but a bit too slow for my tastes.  I'll let
Simon describe the game if he chooses.  His Italy did much better than my
France.  There were a lot of miswritten orders, as two of the players were
simultaneously playing in the Machavelli final, and some of us have gotten so
used to the Judge's parsing as a crutch to ensure that every force has an
order written.  (Gee, how did those Germans get into Burundy anyway?)
<P>
I was going to sleep late Sunday and just come in for the awards but I
woke up at seven so I went in for the final round.  I landed Austria,
which fit my crazy mood well.  I was hoping for best stab.  My first
instinct was to go Key Lepanto, but Italy was very new to the game, so
I offered to let his fleet land in Greece as long as my fleet was let
into the Ionian.  The idea was to forego the build in favor of the
position.  With Russia and Turkey bouncing the Black Sea, this seemed
like a risk I could afford.  Well, there was a miscommunication that I
interpreted as a stab, and Italy took Greece with an army, leaving me
with no second build and no decent position.  In 1902, the Russians started
invading.  Having just slugged through three games where I was sweating
through on my tactics, I decided "oh, screw it!" and tried to slam into Italy.
It would have worked had I not been lied to by both France and Turkey on the
same move.  I went down to one SC, just as Russia was taking Vienna,
Budapest, and Norway, and making a fleet move to Armenia that completely
hosed the Turk.  Carl(Turkey) convinced me not to become a Russian lackey,
so the next year the anti-Russian coalition of IAT held the line at
Trieste/Serbia.
The following year, however, the Italian turned, and I popped.
<P>
The rest of the session I alternated between watching the Russian win my
game and watching the "Show me the Love" table.  I can't really explain
that one -- I think you had to be there.
<P>
On the whole, I was extremely pleased by the large number of very good players.
Only in my last game did I run into a newbie.  Even when I was being attacked,
I was having fun.  I remember Rick Mannus's (Russia) explanation for his
army in Galicia  ("They're going to Italy" - "That's ridiculous!" -
"I know, I don't even believe it myself!").  I probably gave Russia more grief
than he deserved just because his lies were so poor.
<P>
On the whole, the Dip tournament was a lot of fun.  I really hope I have
the time to make the trip from Jersey next summer.
