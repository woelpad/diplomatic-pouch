<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Payola is a Diplomacy variant popular with a
growing group of enthusiasts. In addition to the familiar military units,
each player manages financial instruments (silver pieces) that are used
to bid for control of units. As a player acquires more supply centres, he
gains access to more silver pieces. As in other Diplomacy variants, a
power wins when he controls a certain number of supply centres at the end
of a Fall campaign. The complete, annotated Payola rules and a general
introduction are available in <a href=/DipPouch/Zine/W1995A/Payola>an article
in the Winter 1995 Adjustment issue of The Pouch</a>.
<P>
The single focal point for all Payola games is the Website
<a href=/dpjudge/payola>Payola Place</a> (part of
The Pouch's Web- and Email-based
<a href=/dpjudge>DPjudge</a>).

<I><FONT SIZE=4><P><b>Graduates of the Bill (&quot;Okay,
so I did inhale&quot;) Clinton School of Diplomacy</P></b></font></i>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While each player is primarily concerned with moving
his own units into supply centres (SC's), there are a variety of reasons
why he might attempt to gain control of foreign units through a hostile
bid. Hence, it sometimes occurs that field commanders disobey
orders. To the observer, it may appear that the powers were acting &quot;under
the influence&quot; to occasionally issue inconsistent or even self-destructive
commands. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a curious observer trying to penetrate the
mysteries of Payola, I approached Manus Hand, creator and owner of the
variant, asking whether I should be alert to the occurrences of any
patterns. He responded typically:  &quot;How about together
we look, and if we find some, I'll expect an article from you for The Zine.&quot;
Since that time, we have made enough observations to support some guesses
as to
what those inebriated diplomats might be doing. Even if we don't reveal the
secret of how to gain a solo in your next game of Payola, we hope that by
presenting our results, we'll be offering some insights into typical strategies
and their applicability. </P>
<i><FONT SIZE=4><b>We Hold This Truth to be
Self-Evident: That all Supply Centres are not Created Equal</b></font></i>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our first observation was that average acquisition and
maintenance cost differs by quite a bit from SC to SC. Trieste, for
instance, is a border SC accessible to both fleets and armies. It has a
central location in a region rich in SC's and has a large number of access
paths. This practically guarantees a high level of contention.
Ankara, on   the other hand, is typically &quot;behind the lines,&quot;
and a successful attack
on Ankara typically requires coordination of units (an even harder feat
to accomplish in Payola than in standard Diplomacy).
<!p align=justify>
Is it any wonder then,
that   the average spending to control Ankara during the course of a game is
typically lower than that for Trieste?</P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4><b>Numbers, Please! </b></font></i>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Having made these observations and found plausible
explanations for their occurrence, the next step was to quantify the
results. What we were after was an answer to the question: how much would
I typically expect to pay in order to gain and maintain control of a
given SC? I am going to tell you about two attempts we made at this and
what we learned in the process.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our first attempt was a metric we called &quot;Silver.&quot; This
metric incorporated various aspects in assessing the value of given SC:</P>
<OL>
<LI>whether it is could be reached by fleets only,
armies only, or both fleets and armies</LI>
<LI>how easy it is to access</LI>
<LI>how rich a neighbourhood it was in</LI>
<LI>whether it was a home SC or a neutral SC
</LI></OL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second criterion above -- &quot;accessibility&quot; --
incorporates the notions
of centrality as well as connectivity. Thus Portugal, being in a corner
with two neighbours, has a lower accessibility (in both respects) than
Munich with its seven neighbours and central location. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third criterion -- &quot;neighbourhood richness&quot; -- reflects
the fact that areas rich in SC's would likely be more contentious as they
would attract a large number of units. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;Silver&quot; produced some interesting results that
confirmed our observation that the spending varied significantly between
SC's. For instance, between the cost of acquiring and maintaining the most
and the least expensive SC's (Trieste and Portugal respectively), &quot;Silver&quot;
predicted a ratio of 4.2:1. However, &quot;Silver&quot; led to some conclusions that
seemed to be at variance with experience, notably that the German home
SC's should be among the most expensive to hold.</P>
<I><FONT SIZE=4><b>Is this Silverware Pure or Just
Plated?</b></font></i>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That &quot;Silver&quot; predicted a high cost for maintaining the
German SC's is not surprising. The German SC's are located in a fairly
rich, central area with high connectivity. So why does Germany usually wind
up with one of the larger treasuries in Payola?
<p align=justify>
I believe that the inadequacies of &quot;Silver&quot; arise from
neglecting the fact that each power generates units at fixed home centres
located in close proximity to each other. Although the operations of
individual powers
may be less localized than in standard Diplomacy, the fully distributed
operations modelled by &quot;Silver&quot; remains inappropriate for Payola.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this point it dawned on us that the best method for
determining the average cost for acquiring and maintaining SC's would be
to analyse the actual spending from the games played to date. So we
started down this path only to learn that the task was more daunting than
we thought. How can one tell, for
example, whether a fleet moving from London to the English Channel is
destined for nearby Belgium, distant Spain, or was simply ordered out to
make room for an enemy convoy into London from Norway? Perhaps different
powers   representing varied intents were responsible for the move, or
perhaps the fleet
isn't headed for anywhere in particular, but was ordered to move simply
to upset an alliance. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These difficulties were initially intimidating. We saw
little hope of being able to sort out nebulous intents and despaired of
our hope to create a simple program that could calculate centre values from
the bid
sheets. However, we continued despite these setbacks and eventually arrived at
an empirical metric, called &quot;Hand&quot; (yes, Manus implemented it, but no, he
didn't name it).  The calculated "Hand Values" relate each supply centre with
the percentage of total money spent in a game that was expended to take or hold
that centre:
<!--
While we know that &quot;Hand&quot; is still
imperfect, we think it provides a reasonable guide as to the attribution
of total spending for acquisition and maintenance of each
SC:

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Hand" was calculated by averaging data from each Payola game played to
date. Just as each game has its own unique character, the degree of
vigour with which the the ownership of each SC is contested varies from
game to game as well as from season to season. Nevertheless, the
geographic distribution of "Hand Values" has implications for the
choices available to each power. In the remainder of this article, we
shall seek to illustrate this by examining a "prototypical" Payola game
in which the "Hand Values" apply.
<!--
The calculations for &quot;Hand&quot; were made by averaging
data from each Payola game, and thus do not reflect any specific tactical
situation.
Preliminary analysis indicates that a (slim) majority of SC cost may be
attributed to factors that are repeatable from game to game. We can
claim with full confidence that the cost for SC's with distinctly
different Hand Values (for instance Trieste and Ankara) will, in fact,
conform to the relative ordering predicted by "Hand."  However,
the relative ordering of cost for SC's with more closely matched "Hand
Values" is more difficult to predict. For instance, we might find that in
30% of all games that the maintenance costs for Serbia exceed those for
Spain.
<p align=justify>
With that very important caveat, however, a player could use &quot;Hand&quot;
(with what he knows of his game situation and mechanics) as a general guide,
for instance, in
deciding whether his fleet in the English Channel might be better off on
a mission to conquer London or Belgium.
(Of course, using the information
this way might tend to skew any future re-computations of &quot;Hand&quot;
that take into account the bribes from the game in question.)
-->
<I><FONT SIZE=4><P><b>
Can We Afford It? What Happens When Rent Varies
</P></b></font></i>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Note that the SC's above the 3% threshold may in fact cost more in upkeep than
they deliver in revenue.  Without concerning ourselves overly much with the
decreasing revenue scheme of Payola (wherein a power earns a diminishing value
for each SC he takes), it follows that, with 34 SC's on the map, each SC pays
out 1/34th of the total revenue each year (roughly 3%). Again, not getting too
fussy, if we assume that by the end of the game everything that has been paid
out has been spent, then the value attributed to the average SC should be 3%
of the whole.  Therefore, those SC's with &quot;Hand Values&quot;
of less than 3% are net revenue generators, those SC's with values
greater than 3% are net revenue consumers.
<p align=justify>Another interesting
comparison is Turkey's advantage over Austria. According to &quot;Hand,&quot;
while all of Turkey's home centres are in the &quot;revenue generator&quot; category,
all of Austria's are in the &quot;revenue consumer&quot; category
(meaning he typically must use his diplomatic wiles to seek out financial aid).
In fact, the
upkeep cost for the Turkish home centres is only roughly <i>half</i> that of the
Austrian home centres. This corresponds with the experience of many an Austrian
struggling to gain control of his disobedient units. Austria's
predicament is well described in the Austrian End of Game statement of
the game Dinero:</P>
<blockquote><I>&quot;...I spent the vast bulk of this
game
wondering what the </i>heck<i> was going on. Chaos as near as I could tell. My
units never seemed to do anything at all, except for occasionally helping
the enemy...."</i></blockquote>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concerned player signed his statement with the
eponym &quot;the eternally confused.&quot;
</P>
<!--
<p align=justify>
An alternative computation of &quot;Hand&quot; can be made which sums the total amount
of money spent on each SC in every game and compares this to the total
amount spent overall.  This computation differs from that presented above
in that the figures in Table 1 are obtained by taking the percentages spent for
each center in each game and averaging these percentages together, with
equal weight given to each game. For example, spending on Sevastopol in one game
might be 5% and in another only 1%; the formula used above would value
Sevastopol at 3%.  The data below, however, takes into account the total funds
spent in each game. Perhaps due to the length of a game,
the 5% figure might actually represent a
smaller total outlay than the 1% figure and should be given lesser weight in
determining an overall result.

and &quot;capitalism,&quot; for reasons I now will describe.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Simply put, socialism is an adaptation chosen when the
resources needed for growth are hard to come by and therefore in need of
protection. Capitalism, on the other hand, is more appropriate when the
focus of concern is on how to quickly acquire and exploit resources that
are readily available. Socialism operates in static fields of endeavour
where productivity depends on joint effort. Capitalism operates in new
fields of endeavour where productivity critically depends upon the
performance of a small number of creative individuals. Socialism is ready
to accept some limitations in the performance of the most capable
individuals and capitalism is ready to accept the full loss of the
potential of a larger number of less capable individuals.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To see how this applies to Payola, consider two
paradigms: Turkey and Germany. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turkey benefits from its defensive position but
suffers from limited access to resources. Turkey's corner location and
the limited connectivity of its home centres <!-- (typically four nearest
neighbours) --> makes it difficult to gain an involvement in remote areas.
Turkey's growth path is to retain the SC's already in his possession and
to slowly expand. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Turkey typically maintains his units in a cluster
and limits the rate of advance at the front to avoid foreign penetration.
Like a good socialist subsidising a dying industry, Turkey is willing to
pay more in rent for certain SC's (including all the SC's within two moves
journey of any of his home centres)
than they typically deliver in revenue.
He has means to do this because it allows him to book a good profit from
his interior SC. In this respect, Turkey's position is analogous to that
of a state monopolist.
Furthermore, Turkey has little alternative to operation of these
unprofitable resources near his homeland, as their control is necessary
for his further expansion and self-preservation.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In contrast, Germany has excellent access to resources
but is vulnerable from all sides. Munich, for instance, has seven immediate
neighbours; is within two moves of nine neutral or foreign SC's, and is
located midway between Edinburgh and Smyrna, Portugal and St.
Petersburg. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Germany's growth path is to widely distribute his
units, collect up-to-date information about the cost of operations in
each region, and use his superior mobility to quickly redirect his units
as appropriate. He might fully neglect his units located in less
interesting theatres. Like a good capitalist, indifferent to the problems
of a dying industry, Germany will accept the frequent loss of SC's. By
abandoning resources that have become too expensive, he is better able to
concentrate on acquisition of cheaper resources readily at hand, while
effectively raising the operating costs of his competition. A
successful Germany is opportunistic, changing his friends and enemies as
often as is needed. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a final illustration of these strategies, consider
a map from the game Quisling, showing
the capitalist and socialist strategies in action: </P>
<center>
<table border=3>
<caption><b>Example from the Ongoing Game

<P align=justify>
In order to grow along the socialist path, Turkey has been forced to abandon
his initial position as a likely net earner.  To see this, let us consider
the &quot;Hand Values&quot; computed earlier.
<!--
<i>(Although the two computations that were presented would provide us with
very similar results, we will use the values presented in Table 2.)</i>
The average &quot;Hand Value&quot; of the SC's
currently in Turkish possession has grown (from its initial value of
only 2.2%) to over 3.1%, which is marginally above the
break-even point. In this position, we might suppose that Turkey would
do well to apply his financial reserves to quickly finance the next
stage of growth.
<p align=justify>
At first glance, it might appear that the capitalist's ability to scout
out and contest the lowest priced SC's would provide him with an advantage
in earning potential. This seems to be confirmed in the illustrated
case, in which Germany is in possession of SC's with an average &quot;Hand
Value&quot; of 2.8%, very similar (actually a little <i>better</i> than) his
initial situation (which was 2.9%).

possession of SC's with an average &quot;Hand Value&quot; of 2.8%, very similar to his
initial situation (which was 2.7%).
However, we must
consider that the SC's that are the least expensive to capture and hold
are distributed throughout Europe and
change constantly with the political situation.
Therefore, the capitalist powers may
need access to a hefty travel budget to fund
long journeys not foreseen by &quot;Hand.&quot;
Indeed, there is anecdotal evidence that the capitalist powers should
abandon any pretension of long term planning and be ready to "go with
the flow," so as to let other powers pay at least part of their fare. An
excerpt from Germany's End of Game Statement in "Dinero" is enlightening
(Germany won in 1910):
<blockquote>
<I><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At one point, somebody gave my Munich army an
involuntary shove into Burgundy .. so I launched a preemptive attack [on
France].  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When somebody sent my armies into Scandinavia, with
Russia already weakened...I continued there, picking up SC's and their
annual income whenever I could do so efficiently.</I>
</blockquote>
<!--
We can relate this map to our notion of &quot;Hand Values&quot; for
the various SC's.  If we examine the values of the SC's owned by Turkey and
Germany (we will use data from the second computation given above), we see
that the eight German centres, altogether,
account for 22.7% of game spending, while spending for the six Turkish
centres sums to 18.8%.
[Notice that even if Turkey, rather than Germany, owned Smyrna,
the seven Turkish centres would still average 3.14% to maintain, while
the seven German centres would average only 2.82%.]
<p align=justify>
Since, looking at the map, the German centres are relatively trouble-free,
capitalist Germany is able to safely use his position as a revenue-generator
either to fund some fishing expeditions (Clyde, Finland, and Smyrna, for
example) or not be bothered too much if such things are funded for him by
foreign interests.  On the other hand, Turkey's new status as a
revenue-consumer is
only compounded by the fact that his usually inexpensive but ever-crucial
home centres (Constantinople and Ankara) are probably going to need
greater funding than normal if they are to remain Turkish.  This once
again points up that socialist Turkey must expand in a close-knit
fashion to prevent an enemy from slipping through to harass the profitable
centres he depends upon to fund his growth.

In conclusion, then, you can see that the Payola player can serve himself
well by considering not only which path of expansion his power should
most wisely pursue, but also the operating costs he can expect to incur
during that expansion and how to modify and manage them.
<!--
The adroit player
can know when to call on his allies
to beg for money, and when to stab them in the back for that plum
revenue-generating centre.
