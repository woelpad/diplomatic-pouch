AvalonCon has come and gone again. While it may not be the biggest or best
known Diplomacy tournmant, It has become the yearly FTF gathering for a
number of the players who call CAT23 their Internet Diplomacy home. I go as
much to play Diplomacy as I do to socialize once a year with people with whom
I only communicate via email.
<P>
In brief, CAT23 is an Internet Diplomacy organization or club which
currently counts approximately 200 players worldwide in the open general
membership and another 60 in the invitation-only CAT23 Academy of Diplomacy.
More detail can be found at <a href=http://www.acronet.net/~mczet>the
CAT23 front page</a>.
<P>
Before the reader gets the impression that this article is a trumpet for my
success at AvalonCon, let me shoot that particular horse right in the rump. I
did not do well. I never do well at AvalonCon in fact. I think I'm a pretty
decent player but in FTF games I fill the room with as much glory as a dead
skunk. This is not to say
that I did not distinguish myself however. I did receive an award and a rather
distinctive and unique one at that. I received the "Hammered" Award.
<P>
The Hammered award is an interesting thing. It is given to the player
who got clobbered worst, the quickest. As the recipent of this rather
dubious award I had the distinction of losing six centers in one year.
How one acquires this honor must be first prefaced with a bit of
background.
<P>
As in any tournament, the goal of winning the game is secondary to
fullfilling the goals required by the tournament rules. At AvalonCon,
the tournament structure was set up so that it was best two out of
three rounds. 30 points for a solo victory, 10 for a two-way draw, six for a
three-way draw and I forget how many for other results but it was
insignificant.
<P>
Now thirty points is a great deal and could very well determine a winner.
Thirty points plus a three way would probably win. But a large two-way with a
three- or two-way is a great deal easier to accomplish and
affords enough points to beat a solo win that does not share in any
three-ways. Such was the case at this Con in fact.
<P>
I point this out to illustrate the that overall style of play is
predisposed to try and gain as many points through the safest method
of play. This, of course, is the draw.
<P>
The normal course of events in a tournament round was for two or
three players to form a strong alliance. To illustrate: in round one
I played England and allied with France all game long; we participated in a nice three-way with Turkey.
<P>
As far as I know, on all other boards, this was the trend for the
whole Con. Free-for-alls do not normally exist. Stabs, while not
absent, are not a common event. Even when they do happen, they are often
less a stab than a slow shift of power. Most games only go to about
1908 after eight hours of play. With drastic action being rare, most
games tend to be a stately progress of alliance politics. As the
deadline approaches, the surviving players sort things out and
decisions on "who's in the draw" are made.
<P>
Now this has no direct bearing on the Hammered Award, but when I
examine just how I played my rounds, it does shed considerable light
on how this acheivement was made. In round one, I allied with France and
stayed allied all game. I had chances to stab, but did not and got a
three-way. In a game two I was Turkey. I allied with Austria of all
people. I attacked Russia with some success (Rum and Sev) right off the
bat, but I stabbed Austria about 1904 when our offensive bogged down a
bit. By the end of the game I was reduced to five and excluded from the
three-way. In round three I drew Sandy Wibble (last year's winner) as a neighbor and my
Germany and his France attacked England. We did not gain spectacular
success but neither were we failing. But again, as things looked like
they were stalling, I up and stabbed Sandy. I got to eight centers but
by 1906, as I was pushing German fleets into the Mediterranean to keep things
from stalemating, my English ally clobbered me for four SC's and Sandy's
raiders grabbed two.  Can you say "decapitate"?!
<P>
So anyway, I'm sitting there thinking ('cause it seems I have some
spare time to do it). "Why did I do so crappy again this year?" I did
well in round one by playing a conservative, uninspired, by the book
game. But in games two and three, I did not have any patience. I grew
bored with the game as soon as the excitement of the opening moves
turned to the early mid-game and it's "sit around and wait and see" phase.
Without even thinking I, engaged in a bold move figuring that if
someone moves first, someone else surely will make a move themselves.
But no one ever did. And I should have known they would not. I've
been to AvalonCon three times now. I know how things flow. Bold moves
are only made towards the end, when one alliance is ended and three
players have negotiated a three-way game.
<P>
So, in retrospect I should not at all be surprised to have received the
"Hammered" award. My style of play was in direct contrast with the norm
being used in the tournament. By stirring things up early I only
called attention to myself, a bit of a sin on a board full of
experienced players. It was really only a matter of time before I got
truly clobbered.
<P>
Am I disapointed in the way the tournament went for me? Perhaps a little,
but really only in that I needed to be hit over the head 99 times to
realize the real game being played. I will display my "Hammered" plaque
prominently, and next year I will sit at the tournament tables and be
rather bored in the mid-game. But I probably won't get clobbered and
in fact I'll probably do pretty well. Perhaps even a top ten finish.
