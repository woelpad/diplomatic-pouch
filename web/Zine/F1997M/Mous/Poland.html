<H3>Brief Introduction</H3>
Welcome to the eighth article in my continuing series about the Modern
variant. In <a href=/DipPouch/Zine/W1995A/Mous/Modern.html>the
first article</a>,
you got an introduction to the modern variant, as well as some
information on how to get started playing it.
In the next five articles I discussed the opening strategies for
<a href=/DipPouch/Zine/S1996M/Mous/Modern2.html>Britain</a>,
<a href=/DipPouch/Zine/S1996R/Mous/egypt.html>Egypt</a>,
<a href=/DipPouch/Zine/F1996M/Mous/Modern.html>France</a>,
<a href=/DipPouch/Zine/W1996A/Mous/Modern.html>Germany</a>,
and
<a href=/DipPouch/Zine/S1996M/Mous/Italy.html>Italy</a>.
Then I took a break and conducted a
<a href=/DipPouch/Zine/S1997R/Mous/NewOpenings.html>review</a>
of those six articles.
<P>
In this article, I return to examining the openings for powers in
Modern. In the pole position of the second
half of powers -- alphabetically, at least -- is a small power that
recently emerged from the Warsaw Pact, a
power caught between the larger powers of Germany and Russia, a power
trying to assert itself:  Poland.
<P>
Though Poland is small and centrally located, these weaknesses can be
turned into strengths by the skilled
diplomat, and I believe Poland is one of the most interesting powers to
play in Modern.

<H3>Recently Finished Modern Games</H3>
As always, I'll take a look at recently finished Modern games. Don't
forget, however, that you can get the
latest on the variant at
<a href=http://www.dragonfire.net/~Cyberia/modern.htm>the Modern
Variant Homepage</a>. Check it out if you
haven't already! For some games
finished in 1997, you can see a graphical summary of each game. Let me
know what you think. If the
feedback is positive, I might do the same for other games too.
<P>
An incredible eight games finished since my last article was written.
If I had to pick a common theme, it
would be German solos, and draws figuring Egypt and Spain. In the first
of those, Academy4 (USEF,
nopress), Egypt, Italy and Spain (Kevin Chin, Jody McCullough and Wes
Hansen) settled for a three-way draw
and continued their strong showings in the power rankings. Egypt and
Spain (Kent Liljegren and Stephen
Breininger) repeated their success in the next game, Milan (USEF,
nopress), sharing a draw with Britain
(Klas Forsberg).
<p>
The next game to finish, Thisthat (USEF, press), saw a new star
appearing among the powers. Germany
(Morten Wolf) took its first solo win in Modern, quickly followed by a
four-way draw in Nato (USIN, press) and
another solo win in Gun1994 (USEF, nopress).  The draw in Nato was shared
by Egypt, Germany, Russia
and Spain (Doug Gray, Vincent Mous, Andre Verweij and Gilad Greenberg)
after a long battle between a Russo-Egyptian alliance on the one side,
and a triple alliance between Spain,
Italy and Germany on the other. It is
interesting to note that the German solo in Gun1994 (Ian York) was a land
victory, with Germany taking all the SC's
to its east, reaching Kazakhstan and the borders of Greece, but not
taking any British SC's nor more than half of
France. In Thisthat, on the other hand, Germany reached Portugal, but did
not manage to capture all of Ukraine,
Russia or the Balkans. These first two German wins in Modern proved its
flexibility, and catapulted it to the top of the
rankings for powers in 1997.
<P>
Odessa (USEF, nopress) ended next with another 3-way draw involving
Egypt and Spain (Rick Desper and Mike
Linakis). This time Poland (Doug Gray) shared the honors in what was
perhaps the longest lasting Modern game to
date, ending as it did in 2022.  This momentarily put Rick Desper at the
top of the overall standings in the Modern
Hall of Fame, but the very next day Eric Person took his second Modern
victory, this time as Russia in aurora (YUBG,
press), to claim the spot for himself. Finally, breaking Egypt and
Spain's combined draw streak were Germany,
Turkey and Ukraine (Simon Withers, Petar Mimica and Michael North) in
Minsk (USEF, press). This was another
strong showing by Germany, which reached 29 SC's before being stopped by
the strong U/T alliance.
<P>
Anyhow, on to the subject at hand. I'll be looking at Polish openings
and strategies, and will then, as
usual, include a section of player comments on Poland in Modern.
<H3>List of Openings for Poland</H3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Teschen (Earle Ratcliffe)</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Lithuania.<br>
Army Warsaw -> Bielorussia.<br>
Army Krakow -> Czech Republic.
</tt></blockquote>
Earl Ratcliffe, who gave the opening its name, says it was
"named after the minor war Between Poland and Czechoslovakia over the
Teschen coalfields after WWI," and notes that it is
"probably to become the standard Polish opening.  It allows for a possible
three   builds without offending
anyone."
<p><dt><b>
Polish Horse
</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Bielorussia.<BR>
Army Krakow SUPPORT Army Warsaw -> Bielorussia.
</tt></blockquote>
This is the most popular choice for opening. I got many name suggestions
for it as well. Since Eric Person
won using this opening, I used his name for this one, and used the other
names for openings that did not receive any suggestions.
<P>
Says Murray Grelis:  "Ideally on the next turn you can order A Krakow-Czech Republic and gain
three builds."
<P>
"The opening guarantees Bielorussia in the spring," says Toby
Tyrrell, "and it moves the
fleet to Lithuania, ready for a move on Russia in 1996.  Krakow should still be able to take
Czechoslovakia in the Fall, since it is
"obviously" a Polish centre.  Perhaps most importantly, the moves are
inoffensive to
all your neighbours (except perhaps Russia), and will hopefully keep you
free of enemies and free to
choose your own target (probably Russia) in 1996.  They give a good
chance of getting three centres in
1995."
<P>
Jeff Zahnen "used this and was able to take Czech in the fall, and double in size
very quickly."  He says that although it was a no-press
game, Germany and Poland respected the Pru-Sil area and left each other
alone, which allowed him to
quickly eliminate Russia.
<P>
Derek Carlson advises that
"in a no-press game, I would certainly consider going for the Balkan SC's,
because Poland could secure its back with
diplomacy.  In a no-press game though, Poland cannot afford to let its
guard down with Ukraine or Russia,
as they could easily turn on an exposed back.  This opening is a safe
route in a no-press game and sets
up a front with Russia while still being in position against Ukraine."
<P>
Eric Person thinks "that the best opening for Poland is easily this one.
Nobody can touch Lithuania in the first year except for Poland (well,
actually Russia can reach it
by fall, but I can't <b>ever</b> imagine Russia moving Moscow-Latvia in the
first spring...). Thus,
taking Lithuania _could_ wait 'til fall if Poland wants to flex muscle in
the Baltic Sea. But there's
no good reason for Poland to potentially make enemies early.
In press games I can see other openings having merit, but in a no-press I
think the above
opening is the only smart choice.
I like to call it the "Polish Horse." Why? Well, for one, I used it
when I had the pseudonym "the
Horse of Poland" in one game. But that's a bad reason. I also like the
nickname because the
opening reminds me of a horse's kick: A <b>strong</b> kick to the rear
(Bielorussia) in the spring,
followed by a weaker front-hoof stretch (Czech Republic) in the fall. Did
wild horses used to roam in Poland? I believe this is true."
Chris Barnes makes a number of points about the opening.
"Russia and Ukraine will need a strong alliance to keep Bielorussia from
Poland.
Working together, they <b>could</b> keep both Lit and Bie from
Poland,  but they would each have to commit two units for a full year to do
so.
That should not be feasible in any game.
The Czech Republic remains a possiblity for Poland given the right
diplomacy.
Or, Poland can play kingmaker in the Czech Republic (more likely in a press
game, I think)
in return for a useful alliance with Germany or Italy.
The opening should make no particular enemies.  The
Lithuania/Bielorussia units
are defensively strong, but poorly coordinated to move further East.  And
even with
three builds, Poland need not worry about being branded an early leader,
so grabbing Cze won't start trouble unless it was coming anyway.
Since Germany starts out with two fleets, the German border is the
natural one to leave open.  Good Polish diplomacy will include discouraging an
army build in Berlin in 1995 and will also include either a strong alliance
with Germany or with France against Germany."
<P>
Richard Horton calls the Horse "one of the few safe moves the Polish player
has to begin with.  As long   as Ukraine and Russia are
not allied together (which should be pretty rare), this will result in a
gain of at least two centers in 1995.
There is the possibility that Krakow could move into the Czech Republic
if Bielorussia is not under
immediate pressure, thus netting three centers right off the bat.
Once again a German incursion into Prussia would be a grave problem but
it wouldn't destroy the Polish
positions.  The diplomatic position after this move is also very open.
It isn't necessarily hostile to any one
power, and gives Poland some leverage in its dealings with Russia and
Ukraine."
<p><dt><b>
Balkan Rush (Earle Ratcliffe)
</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Krakow.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Slovakia.
</tt></blockquote>
Earl Ratcliffe calls this opening "Anti-Italian, pro Urkaine.
The Slovakia army can move on to Hungary, while
Kra goes to Cze or supports Krakow
into Cze for an attack into Austria in 1996.  Another strong Polish
opening."
<p><dt><b>
John Paul II (Murray Grelis)
</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Krakow.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Czech Republic.
</tt></blockquote>
Murray Grelis call this "How to get a Pole into Rome.
You then move A Krakow-Slovakia and try for   as many of the Balkan
centres as possible. Very messy and risky in a no-press game, though."
<p><dt><b>
Breadbasket (Earle Ratcliffe)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Bielorussia.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Podolia.
</tt></blockquote>
Earl Ratcliffe says, "This puts immediate pressure on Ukraine.  Bielorussia is
probably a
bounce, but you can support War-Bie
in the Fall.  If War-Bie is successful in the spring, then
Podolia can attack any of Hungary,
Rumania, Odessa, or Kiev.  If Krakow doesn't make it to Podolia, then you
can usually take Czech in the
Fall."
<p><dt><b>
Silesian Adventure
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Silesia.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Czech Republic.
</tt></blockquote>
Poland turns his back on Russia and Ukraine, letting them fight over
Bielorussia, and probably hoping
that they bounce there in the spring of 1995. Instead, Poland moves west
against Germany, with the
Czech Republic guaranteed P{olish and with pressure put on Berlin.
<p><dt><b>
Vodka Tonic (Earle Ratcliffe)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Bielorussia.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Czech Republic.
</tt></blockquote>
The Vodka Tonic is identical to the Teschen opening, except that the
fleet is moved to the Baltic Sea. This
may provide extra diplomatic leverage with Russia, providing a tonic to
its strong power, while still
allowing Poland to take Lithuania in the fall.
<p><dt><b>
Russian Crush (Derek Carlson)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Bielorussia.<BR>
Army Krakow SUPPORT Army Warsaw -> Bielorussia.
</tt></blockquote>
Similar to the popular Polish Horse opening, the Russian Crush instead
moves the fleet to the Baltic Sea
in the Spring of 1995. Poland could conceivably move Warsaw to Lithuania
and Krakow to Bielorussia in
the Fall and take a shot at Sweden, perhaps with German help. Otherwise,
Lithuania and Czech are still
there for the taking.
<p><dt><b>
Hungarian Gambit
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<br>
Army Warsaw -> Lithuania.<br>
Army Krakow -> Slovakia.
</tt></blockquote>
Poland gives up Bielorussia to Ukraine or Russia, as well as the
security that goes with occupying it, in
exchange for a shot at Hungary. That shot is tenuous at best, but
probably works best if Bielorussia goes
to Ukraine, as that should mean only Italy could stop Poland from taking
Hungary. This is a poor cousin to
the Balkan Rush.
<p><dt><b>
King of the Slavs (Richard Horton)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Krakow.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Slovakia.
</tt></blockquote>
Richard Horton likes this opening.
"As a general strategy, this seems to be the strongest Polish move.  It
offers a lot of room for maneuver,
both diplomatically and militarily. The opening allows Poland to have at
least a say in Scandanavian
affairs, and does leave the option of picking up Lithuania in the first
year. Any division in the entire area,
including the Balkans, will have Polish influence. If Poland can reach an
accommodation with Italy this could
be especially lucrative. A solid move."
<p><dt><b>
Bear Hunt (Murray Grelis)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Krakow HOLD.
</tt></blockquote>
Instead of making a play for Bielorussia in the spring of 1995, Poland
stands firm, moving his fleet to the
Baltic, and an army to Lithuania. Bielorussia or Czech could still be
taken in the fall, but if Russia or
Ukraine is in Bielorussia, it is probably best to do a self-bounce in
Warsaw. The opening could potentially
be used to launch a strong anti-Russian move in the fall of 1995.
<p><dt><b>
White Russian (Earle Ratcliffe)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Bielorussia.
</tt></blockquote>
Richard Horton calls this "the most anti-Russian move.  It requires that Germany and
Ukraine are at least neutral to Poland.
If Ukraine is allied with Poland this can be a devestating opening to
Russia.  On the downside, it assures
Poland of only one build, although two are possible.  It also leaves the
Czech center open to invasion.  Hard to
recommend."
<P>
Earl Ratcliffe, however, finds this opening attractive.
"The Baltic fleet can help Germany take Sweden, and the armies take a strong
position into Russia.  Alternatively,
Bielorussia can try to move on to Moscow. I prefer to open strongly
against Russia, either to finish him
quickly, or to push him into an alliance against Ukraine. If you support
Germany into Sweden in the fall of
'95, Cze should remain uncontested in '96."
<p><dt><b>
Solidarity
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Czech Republic.
</tt></blockquote>
To Earl Ratcliffe, this is "an option with a strong German alliance.
Now you can influence the fate
of Bie, Swe and Aus in the very
first turn!  Fall 1995 should prove to be very fun as everyone clamors
for your favours to support them in
the various different regions."
<p><dt><b>
Podolian Offensive
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<br>
Army Warsaw -> Lithuania.<br>
Army Krakow -> Podolia.
</tt></blockquote>
A seldom used, but potentially strong opening for Poland. Poland has not
yet finished with less than a seventeen
SC five-way draw using it.  The Czech Republic is given up for an early
attack on Ukraine, from which
Hungary, Rumania, Kiev, Kharkov and Bielorussia are threatened if Poland
makes it in. If not, the Czech
Republic and Bielorussia are still available to take and Ukraine might
not make it into Hungary in 1995,
leaving a possible extra SC open for Poland in 1996.
<p><dt><b>
Great Eastern Push
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Bielorussia.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Podolia.
</tt></blockquote>
Moving all Poland's units eastwards, the Great Eastern Push is probably
an attack against Ukraine, though
a bounce could have been arranged in Podolia.  Though this opening has
not been used, this is probably a
better option than the Podolian Offensive, unless Russia was promised
Bielorussia, as it does not give up
claims to that important neutral SC.
<p><dt><b>
Polish Strongpoint (Chris Barnes)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<BR>
Army Warsaw HOLD.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Czech Republic.
</tt></blockquote>
Poland takes a sure SC in the Czech Republic, but otherwise makes no
move towards either Lithuania or
Bielorussia. This opening will therefore seldomly be used, but does allow
Poland to support himself into
Lithuania in the fall of 1995, and so is not as bad as it first appears.
If Russia or Ukraine manages to take
Bielorussia in the spring however, Poland will be vulnerable. Keeps
Poland's options towards Ukraine and
Russia open though.
<p><dt><b>
Snowshoes (Richard Horton)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Baltic Sea.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Gdansk.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Bielorussia.
</tt></blockquote>
Richard Horton says,
"I would love to see this opening tried, but I do not think it likely to
occur. It would seem that any posturing
towards getting involved in Scandanavia will be dependent on a friendly
Germany or possibly Russia.
Krakow could move to Warsaw instead, and then on to Lithuania."
<p><dt><b>
Retribution (Richard Horton)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk SUPPORT Army Warsaw -> Prussia.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Prussia.<BR>
Army Krakow HOLD.
</tt></blockquote>
A weak opening against Germany, probably only to be used if Germany has
been making anti-Polish
noises. This would effectively counter any early German strike, while not
appearing too hostile and not
letting all defenses down against Russia and Ukraine. Two of Bielorussia,
Lithuania and Czech are still
possible.
<p><dt><b>
Das Schutzenfest  (Earle Ratcliffe)
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Prussia.<BR>
Army Warsaw -> Silesia.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Czech Republic.
</tt></blockquote>
Unused as of yet, Earle Ratcliffe calls this opening
"decidedly anti-German. It leaves   Poland's back open to Russia.  A
strong alliance with Russia is a must, as you will need to pick up Lith
in 1996.  Probably only one build in 1995."
<p><dt><b>
Minsk Alliance
</b><dd><blockquote><tt>
Fleet Gdansk -> Lithuania.<BR>
Army Warsaw SUPPORT Ukrainian Army Kiev -> Bielorussia.<BR>
Army Krakow -> Czech Republic.
</tt></blockquote>
Poland gives up Bielorussia to Ukraine in exchange for a strong
alliance against Russia. If Ukraine also
opened Kiev to CRP, it could support itself into Moscow, while Poland
moves in behind to take Bielorussia
anyhow.

<H3>Strategy for Poland in Modern Games</H3>
Of the three three-center powers in Modern, only Poland does not hold a
corner position on the map. What's
more, it has Russia for neighbours the only five-center power (Russia) as
well as three other four-center
powers. Despite this, Poland has not been the least successful power in
Modern. It holds the record for the
fastest win (38 SC's by 2004), and has drawn a respectable number of
times, placing it in the top half of
powers to date.
<P>
Why is this? Poland does have some advantages. It has access, though
not immediate, to the large
supply of SC's in Central Europe and the Balkans as well as to the North
Sea area and the neutral SC's in
the Lowlands and Scandinavia. In the immediate vicinity, it has access to
Lithuania, Bielorussia and the
Czech Republic, allowing it to grow to a respectable size by the end of
1995. Finally, and perhaps most
importantly, because of its small size, Poland does not seem as
formidable as its neighbours, and will less
likely be the target of an initial assault, allowing it, more often than
not, to choose its allies.
<P>
So, what should Poland's initial considerations be? The first question
you must ask yourself is probably
what to do about Russian and the Ukraine. Which should you ally with and
which should you attack? Or
should you perhaps leave them to their own devices and head in another
direction? As Lithuania and
Bielorussia, both of which can probably be considered natural Polish
neutrals (though Bielorussia will be
more hotly contested) are in the direction of Russia and the Ukraine,
Poland will probably want to get
involved. Not to do so would involve giving up too much - the neutral SC's
as well as the security they
grant.
<P>
What are the advantages to attacking Russia instead of Ukraine? For one
thing, Ukraine doesn't have a
port in the north, and will not be able to threaten Poland that way once
Russia is gone. For another,
Ukraine doesn't hold a corner position, and will be easier to handle when
large, hopefully with Turkey's
help.  Finally, splitting Russia with Ukraine will naturally lead Poland
to a position from which it can stake a
claim on Scandinavia.
<P>
What then of the opposite choice, attacking Ukraine with Russia? This
is a trickier deal to pull off, as it
will put Poland in a potentially dangerous position, with an ally at its
back.  Still, as Poland and Ukraine
seem like more likely allies, Russia may be willing to give enough to
Poland to make an alliance
worthwhile.  This could include agreeing to concentrate its efforts to
the south (Ukraine and Turkey), and
helping Poland into Scandinavia. This could alleviate many of Poland's
traditional concerns. Furthermore,
with Ukraine gone, the door to the Balkans will be open for Poland, which
could easily take Hungary and
Rumania, and perhaps move down to Serbia and Croatia.  This is a strong
position from which to take
Austria and move on towards Germany. Finally, unlike Ukraine, Russia can
keep moving its forces in the
same direction - south - once Ukraine is gone. Ukraine would have to turn
them back out of Russia and
away from Poland, making a stab quite likely at that point. Therefore,
while an alliance with Russia is not
for everybody, it is still quite a viable option.
<P>
No matter which target Poland chooses, Bielorussia and Lithuania are
vital for Poland's defense.
Lithuania is a given, and Bielorussia can be taken with support, unless
Russia and Ukraine cooperate.
This opening (the Polish Horse) will probably not be seen as aggressive
by either Ukraine or Russia.
The fleet in Lithuania does pose a severe threat to Russia, as it cannot
move inland. An army, on the other
hand, if pushed into Latvia, would threaten both St. Petersburg and Moscow
(as in the White Russian).
Similarly, a Polish army in Bielorussia, while a nuisance, does not pose
a serious threat to Ukraine, while
an army in Podolia (see the Podolian Offensive or the Great Eastern
Push), bordering
Kharkov, Kiev, Rumania and Hungary, would.
<P>
Poland must therefore strike a balance between the advantages of an
early attack on its chosen enemy
and of biding its time by opening in a neutral fashion and letting the
natural animosity between its
neighbours play itself out at the risk of pushing them into cooperating
with each other. As the neutral
openings keep Poland's options open, I would tend to opt for one of them
unless an ally needs to be
reassured by a more aggressive opening. An interesting option is the
possibility of sending Poland's fleet
to the Baltic Sea instead of Lithuania in the spring of 1995. Lithuania
should still be Poland's especially if it
supported itself into Bielorussia (see the Russian Crush) as Russia will
only seldomly open Moscow to
Latvia. The Baltic Sea position can then be used to buy favors by
influencing the fate of Sweden, or can
take Lithuania anyhow if that is deemed more worthwhile.
<P>
What about Poland's relationship with Germany? Separated by three
neutral provinces, Prussia, Silesia
and Saxony, it seems natural for the two powers to declare them as DMZs.
An offensive by one on the
other seems hard to launch by land or sea only, and therefore without
control of Sweden and Austria.
Poland must therefore tread carefully if Germany gains control of both of
these -- though an attack need by
no means be imminent, Poland should not be caught unawares.  Austria and
Sweden are also the gates
through which contact with Italy and Britain are made, so if it is not
possible for Poland to control one of
these, it can probably be arranged that Germany not control both of them.
<P>
How should one try to win as Poland? Winning in Modern is no little
accomplishment, but it is easier with
some powers than others. How does Poland fare? While Poland does have
direct access to Central
Europe and the former East Bloc, as well as secondary access to the
Balkans, it is unrealistic to think that
Poland will get into Turkey, Iran or beyond, though it has been done on
occasion. Poland <b>must</b> therefore
break out into the North Sea if it is to have a chance of winning. That
is a difficult thing to achieve, as
Poland, unlike all other powers, can only build one fleet a year.
Furthermore, just on the other side of
Denmark and Norway, and sometimes in them, is the strongest naval power
in the game -- Britain -- which
can easily lock up the North Sea and mount of blockade of the continent.
Just ask any German player.
There is no specific formula on how to break out of the Baltic Sea, and
the solution is probably different in
every game, but it seems likely to be easier if Britain is distracted by
a large Mediterranean power trying to
break out into the Atlantic, and if achieved by surprise, meaning without
too many fleets built.
<P>
Almost all games with successful Polands have ended with a strong Spain
or Italy as well as a strong
Egypt or Turkey. These are the most distant powers to Poland, and perhaps
this seems like a natural
result of a strong Poland. It is impossible to tell if this is the case
however, or if they are the <b>cause</b> of a
strong Poland. Perhaps, as one last word of advice, a Polish player
should attempt to strengthen these
powers from afar, and so, help himself?
<H3>Player Comments about Poland</H3>
Chris Barnes says that
"with only one ally among Italy, Russia and Ukraine Poland will have
trouble.
Any two of these will be sufficient for a very safe opening that should
allow
Poland to catch up with the four-center powers."
<P>
Derek Carlson thinks that "Poland sits in a position similar to Austria in
the   standard game.  Germany is separated by
neutral territories and I think is obvious for both countries to look
elsewhere.  The knot of Balkan centers
beckon in the south and Poland has two obvious allies to choose from
(Ukraine and Russia) as Austria has
Turkey and Russia.  The danger of course is that Ukraine and Russia ally
and walk all over Poland, its SC's
and gateway to the Balkans.  However, I do not think Ukraine can hope for
as many gains or easy ones
against Poland, so Poland is the natural ally."
<P>
From another player:
"The environment is really difficult: Poland has 6 neighbors is has to
worry about -- Germany, Britain, Russia, Ukraine, Turkey, and Italy.  She
can, if she keeps her wits about, build three very quickly;  but the next set
of SC's is difficult;  faraway.  It takes
a year just to get in their vicinity.  The CRP Complex (CRP borders on
Moscow, Kiev and Kharkov, and
Bielorussia, which is the gateway to Poland) is a nightmare.  I thought
playing Italy and Austria in plain
vanilla was hell because of the Trie/Ven complex;  but <b>this...!</b>  This is
pure devilry! You knew what you
were doing, did you not?"
<H3>Comments on the Importance of Bielorussia to Poland</H3>
Tom Potocki advises that the Polish policy should be that "<b>nobody</b>
is allowed into Bielorussia. Threaten and promise <b>anything</b>
to   make sure nobody
else gets there."
<P>
Paul Rosenzweig agrees.
"Bielorussia is the absolute key for Poland.  How he handles it is
intricately tied up to his
diplomacy with Russia and Ukraine.  If Poland cannot answer the Bie
question before the first
turn, he is in poor shape."
<P>
Eric Person is of the same opinion:
"To me, Bielorussia is absolutely vital to Poland, easily the most
important territory on the board (aside from home centers, of course).
Also, in my limited experience with the Modern variant, one clear victor
from the RPU triad always seems to emerge as a competitor in the endgame.
Bielorussia is the crown jewel of the R/P/U victor's crown. It borders home
centers for all three of these powers (<b>two</b> home centers for Poland),
and
so its importance cannot be overstated. As long as at least two of R/P/U are
alive, Poland should defend Bielorussia well if he owns it and
attack it ruthlessly with total abandon if he doesn't."
<P>
Chuck Carroll also prefers a Polish Bielorussia.
"This is likely to be a point of contention in the P/R/U triangle, but
Poland should push strongly for
it, as it borders two Polish home centers (and only one each of Russia
and Ukraine).   Most likely Poland will
have to agree to DMZ it eventually."
<P>
"Whether I go after Russia or Ukraine," says Derek Carlson, "Bielorussia is
a key staging   ground and I feel the support
into it is necessary since either Russia or Ukraine could bounce out an
unsupported unit."
<P>
John Pitre calls Bielorussia "your big decision.  If you are going for a corner
position, then you take it.  But you
are going to have to trust Germany (probably not a problem) and you
should have Ukrainian
support."
<P>
Earle Ratcliffe says that
"with Poland starting out the smallest of the three nations bordering
Bielorussia, it seems more
likely to be a natural Polish center.  Any assault on Russia must include
Polish control of Bie, as
it's the shortest overland route between Russia and Poland.  Only give it
up to gain concessions
elsewhere, such as in the Balkans or Scandinavia."
<H3>Comments on Polish Handling of Lithuania</H3>
About Lithuania, Earle Ratcliffe advises,
"Take it in the first year.  I prefer to take it with the Warsaw army (than
fleet Gdansk), as it's much easier
to move on to Latvia, which threatens Moscow and St. Petersburg, while a fleet
threatens neither."
<P>
Tom Potocki says,
"Offer it to Russia in exchange for Bie, if you have to, but best of all
grab it yourself."
<P>
Eric Person says that since
"it's essentially impossible for other powers to
reach Lithuania in the first year, even the worst clod of a ruler can
trip into Lithuania with that Gdansk fleet. Tactically, Lithuania is an
excellent place of support for Bielorussia, although if the heat is off
then Krakow/Warsaw can do an adequate job and Lithuania could then be
emptied or fleeted--although an ideally placed Polish fleet should be in
the Baltic,
both for excellent defense and excellent aggressive potential."
<P>
Writes John Pitre: "It surrenders Scandinavia, but...."
<H3>Comments on Poland and Central Europe</H3>
John Pitre says, "My first priority - now - would be to head west and try to 'squeak' into
Central Europe (Czech Republic, Austria, Hungary)..."
<P>
Eric Person, however, says that
"Central Europe is not as important as securing Bielorussia and the
Baltic Sea. To become a great power, Poland needs either to overrun
Russia or take a healthy bite out of Central Europe, but this scenario
only comes into play once Poland is defensively stabilized. The Czech
Republic
should by all rights be Polish territory, but losing it due to a taxing
Russian/Ukrainian campaign or an aggressive Germany does not spell doom.
What's interesting about the Czech Republic is that I think it's a good
barometer
for  the relationship between Germany and Poland. I think Germany is
vital
as a Polish ally -- Poland <b>needs</b> the Prussia/Silesia DMZ in order to
be able to adequately handle the threats in the east. If Germany is an
ally, then CZE will almost certainly be Polish; if Germany is an enemy,
then CZE will likely be lost."
<p>
According to Chris Barnes,
even if Poland doesn't move to the Czech Republic in the Spring of
1995, "note in particular that Italy
gains no centers by Aus-Cze in Fall of 1995.  Italy's only motivation for
this move is to put the screws on
Poland.  Similarly, Germany can expect to find better uses for her armies
than fra/mun-sax-cze
(*bounce*)."
<p>
Paul Rosenzweig's advice to the Polish policymaker is
"Czech is yours.  The rest is negotiable."
<P>
Murray Gelis believes that "the Czech Republic isn't worth going to war with Germany for, unless
Ukraine and Russia are
fighting each other."
<P>
Earl Ratcliffe says, "Poland obviously should get Cze, and Hun is not out of the question by
'96.  By moving to Cze,
you can determine who gains control of Austria in 95."
<P>
Tom Potocki'sadvice is to
"move in right <b>before</b> Russia is killed.  There's that moment when
she is almost dead,
and will be dead no question.  That's when you stab Ukraine and grab for C/E.
I   am guessing that this
is going to be simultaneous, because if the P/U is killing Russia
successfully, that probably
means that Ukraine has the time and energy and units to get strong in CE as
well."
<P>
About Chuck Carroll's only game as Poland, he reports:
"I took the Czech Republic in 1995, but now I   think
this might have been a mistake.  Since Poland's first target is probably
Russia or Ukraine,
sparing the forces necessary to defend Cze is really hyper-extending
oneself.  I now think
it would be better to offer Cze to Germany (if he wants it, although his
attention may be occupied
elsewhere) or possibly Italy in exchange for peace."
<H3>Comments on Poland and the Balkans</H3>
Says Eric Person
"Poland will only get to the Balkans if Ukraine is trounced in some way.
With Ukraine out of the way (or at least weakened), then the Balkans will
normally fall to Turkey or Poland. (Russia and Italy can get to 'em too,
but only if
they're monstrous in power). If Turkey threatens to take the Balkans,
Poland needs to step up & keep it from happening--otherwise, Turkey's
going to be a guaranteed endgame threat."
<P>
Earle   Ratcliffe says that
"it depends on the relations with Italy and Ukraine.  I'd rather shore up
my defenses closer to
home before rushing off to the Balkans.  There's enough centers nearby to
grow before straying
too far from home.  Perhaps you could negotiate Hungary in 96, but
otherwise leave the Balkans
alone until you've eliminated either Ukraine, Russia or Germany."
<P>
John Pitre says to move into the Balkans only
"after one of Russia or Ukraine is gone...."
<P>
Tom Potocki says that the
"east is more important.  Grab what you can there.  In the Balkans, try
to play off U/I/T to make
sure nobody gets upper hand.  If you can spare a unit or two to support
one side, then the other,
all the better.  You can't easily grab it, but you should make sure that
you are the king-maker
there. Of course, if the other guys in the Balkans (Italy, Ukraine, Turkey)
are woosies,   take what you can <b>fast.</b>"
<H3>Comments on Poland and Scandinavia</H3>
Earle Ratcliffe thinks Scandinavia should be handled
"same as the Balkans.  Use your small naval presence in the Baltic to
gain friends by supporting them into Scandinavian centers.  Make sure no
one comes to dominate them, or you'll never get a piece.  Poland's naval
potential is too small to take on a powerful opposition in Scandinavia,
so play balance of power until you're ready."
<P>
According to Tom Potocki,
"it's difficult for Poland to take Scandinavia quickly.  The objective
here should be to make sure
that there's a war in Scandinavia (a three-way war:  E/G/R) for as long as
possible.  As long as those
guys are busy in Scandinavia they will not spend their time sailing up
and down Polish coast."
<P>
Paul Rosenzweig calls Scandinavia
"secondary to the Eastern question.  It should follow along as soon as Poland
has resolved that issue."
<P>
Eric Person writes:
"Poland's great vulnerability is on its landward sides -- control of the
Baltic Sea can easily stifle
waterborne predators. Scandinavia only becomes an issue if Poland is at
war with Germany
and/or Russia. I think a war with Germany is doom for Poland unless it
occurs late. A war with
Russia is an excellent idea early in that Poland can hollow out a corner
position and then begin
to assail Scandinavia.
But in general, Scandinavia seems a secondary objective, and should only
occur once Poland is
strong and secure on its landward borders. An attack there is likely
fruitful if the area is owned
but lightly defended by Germany or else inhabited by a dying exiled
Russia.
If Britain has Scandinavia, forget it. It's hard for Poland to hurt
Britain, and there are way too
many avenues of growth on the landward sides already."
<H3>Comments on a Polish Navy</H3>
John Pitre says that
"Poland needs a strong navy -- not necessarily that many units, but enough
to keep the
Baltic (all of it) free of threats.  If Poland loses Gdansk, they are
sunk (no pun intended)."
<P>
Earle Ratcliffe notes that
"Poland is mainly a land power, so fleets are not as vital as they are
for most other powers. It
doesn't need much of a navy at all.  The only real centers Poland can
take with fleets ar
the Scandinavian ones.  By endgame, you'll probably only need three or four at
the most, enough to
take Scandinavia, and maybe one or two more to try to break out of the
Baltic. Poland is a land
power, perhaps more than any other country in the game of Modern.  It's
the only country with
only one port, and the vast majority of centers lie inland from the
Polish home centers."
<P>
Chuck   Carroll says,
"Poland is like Austria in standard, in that it is the only power which
can build only one fleet per
turn.  But there is one important difference: Austria's one coastal
center is along a little-used
waterway -- about the only time you'll see a fleet in the Adriatic is in an
Austrian attack on Italy
or vice versa.  The Baltic Sea in Modern, however, is quite important,
and cannot be neglected
in the same way in which Austria can neglect the Adriatic.  If Poland
tries to take an almost-exclusively land-based strategy (such as Austria is likely to in
standard), it will not be long before
he finds either Russian fleets moving westward, or British or German
fleets moving eastward.  I
haven't played enough to figure out how Poland should handle this; I'm
just aware of the
problem.  Perhaps Poland should try to maintain a balance of power (but
not an alliance!)
between Britain and Germany, so their fleets are occupied there."
<P>
Tom Potocki advises that
"Poland <b>must</b> make sure that there are no other navies in the Baltic.  This
should be her goal from
day one.  It is difficult to achieve early, but should be a very
important principle.  It's like
Germany in the standard game:  once England gets into the Baltic,
Germany's dead.  In Modern
substitute Poland for Germany...."
<P>
Eric Person counsels against a large navy.
"A very small navy can do just fine. In Spartiku <i>[author's note: Eric
achieved Poland's only solo
victory to date in Spartiku]</i>, I didn't build my second fleet for years.
With a Polish fleet in the
Baltic, Poland  is safe from the North. With an enemy fleet in the
Baltic, Poland is dead in the
water, so to speak. So Poland should build only enough fleets to
maintain control of the Baltic
Sea and no more. Again, there's just way too much real estate by land
that needs to be reckoned
with. Poland generally needs as many armies as possible. Only the Baltic
is an important water
position -- too many fleets means a certain death by land."
<H3>Comments on Initial Polish Strategy</H3>
Derek Carlson says,
"The first thing I want as Poland is non-agression with Germany."
<P>
Eric Person orders his priorities as follows:
"1) Secure Bielorussia
2) Secure the Baltic Sea
3) Do just about anything to become allies with Germany
4) Make sure that Russia and Ukraine don't become fast friends.
Those are the Big 4, in that order."
<P>
John Pitre's opening "advice would be go after Russia...."
<P>
Earle Ratcliffe says,
"gain an ally, and fast.  By gaining an ally, try not to anger anyone
else until you're a little
stronger.  By being a three-center power, without a map edge nearby, you
start in a precarious
position.  The most favourable scenario would be to make peace with all
but one of your
neighbors, and then hit that one hard and fast."
<P>
Murray Grelis notes that
"Poland's major limitation is dictated by Russia's major limitation; that is,
for Russia to expand she
must go through either Poland or Ukraine. Poland can't ignore this and
should therefore take
Bielorussia and Lithuania at once."
<P>
Paul   Rosenzweig would have you
"make one of Russia or the Ukraine a friend, with a slight preference for
the Ukraine.  Do
anything humanly possible to prevent a Russo-Ukrainian alliance."a
<P>
Tom Potocki counsels for a big start.
"Poland should grab Lit, Bie and Cze in 1995.  She must use whatever
diplomacy and opening
which will achieve this purpose.  Poland has only three SC's, so her ability
to build later in the game
are limited.  She is also a central power, so she must get big and tough
qickly or she will be
lunch. Three builds right off the bat are essential."
<H3>Comments on Winning as Poland</H3>
To win, Tom Potocki says, a Pole should "take out Russia and Ukraine.
Then turn west."
<P>
Eric Person's ideal strategy to win as Poland is as follows:
<ol>
<li>Make Germany your closest ally of the game. A big fight between B & G
is great for Poland, and a lot of beautiful cooperation is possible
in Central Europe. Offer Austria to Germany in exchange for Hungary
a year later.
<li>Split Russia and Ukraine. Promise them both the moon--do whatever
it takes to get 'em after each other. Once they've committed to a war,
first side with Ukraine, then get in cahoots with Turkey and take
out Ukraine. The true challenge here is not to let Ukraine take too
much of Russia and not to let Turkey take too much of Ukraine. To me,
this challenge is the most difficult one of the game.
<li>Always be buddies with Britain and hope that they follow Modern
tradition and fizzle in growth during the middle game.
<li>Take out Turkey and fight to attain Izmir/Adana/Iran.
<li>Expand West, either into Italy or into Germany (stabs). Only stab
Germany when you think you have a real shot at the solo."
</ol>
Says John Pitre,
"Go after Russia, then Germany (if weakened) or Ukraine.... From a strong
corner position, break
out to Britain and France...."
<P>
Earle Ratcliffe says the Pole can win only
"with great difficulty.  You need to play balance of
power.  Make sure no one
grows faster than you, and that you don't grow too much faster than
anyone else (which means
be prepared to be a bit smaller than anyone else).  Don't be afraid to
take risks, or you'll be going
nowhere fast."
<H3>Comments on Poland's Starting Position</H3>
Tom Potocki warns that Poland is
"a center power -- surrounded! and a perfect morsel over which Ukraine and
Russia can do a deal.  The
possible R/U deal is the most deadly thing that can happen. A R/U war is
a <i>sine qua non</i>."
<P>
According to Earle Ratcliffe, Poland's starts in
"a precarious position that can turned into an advantage.  It has
access to the Balkans, as
well as a port in the north, which gives it access to Scandinavia.  There
are several natural allies,
and most of  your neighbors probably aren't going to see you as much of a
threat (at least
compared to their other neighbors).  This means that you can often choose
your allies,
something no other country can do regularly."
<P>
John Pitre comments that
"Poland is central, so it's position isn't great, but it has a couple of
pretty certain
builds.... If it can cut down the number of enemies surrounding it, has a
strong position."
<P>
Eric Person's analysis is as follows:
"Poland is truly a land power, and thus it's vulnerable early and often.
Poland is small and surrounded, and so in the early game Poland doesn't
scare anybody. So, in my mind we have an interesting situation: Poland's
early position is so weak that it's actually a strength.
You see, other powers have more dangerous enemies to worry about than
Poland, and so Poland is rarely a big target early on. For example, Russia and
Ukraine are more dangerous to each other than is Poland, and so more often than
not Poland is the deciding factor over who comes out on top between R/U.
And, as long as the Baltic is secured and Bielorussia well defended,
Poland is a reasonably tough nut to crack.
Poland's big Achilles heel is Germany. If Germany attacks early, Poland
dies, one way or another. If attacked from the west, Poland won't
have the resources to defend Bielorussia, which then becomes easy
pickings
for R/U, who can launch quick strikes from home territory.
Thus, Poland's relationship with Germany is the big key to how it can
fare in its position."
<H3>Players Choose the Three Most Important Spaces for Poland</H3>
To Eric Person, the choices are easy:
"1) Bielorussia, 2) Baltic Sea,
3) Prussia/Silesia (consider it one territory)."
<P>
Paul Rosenzweig lists them as
"Bielorussia, Podolia, and Silesia."
<P>
John Pitre's list is
"Gdansk Gdansk Gdansk -- you <b>have</b> to have fleets. Fourth
would be Bielorussia -- if you lose it or Silesia, you
are can start writing your EOG. Fifth would be Silesia."
<P>
Earle Ratcliffe takes a "home sweet home" attitude and lists the three as
"Gdansk, Warsaw, and Krakow obviously.  Aside from those?  Hard to say.
I'd say Bielorussia for
sure.  It borders on two Polish home centers, as well as the natural
neutral of Lithuania.  Slovakia
would be next, as it's the gateway to the Balkans, which you need to come
to dominate in the
mid/end game to have a chance at winning.  It also borders on the home
center of Krakow, and
the natural neutral of Czech.  The last important space would be the
Baltic Sea.  It borders on
two Polish centers (Lith is naturally Polish), and is the linchpin of any
northern moves.  A fleet
Baltic can move to Bhm to attack Germany, or to GOB to attack Russia.
It's also the shortest
route into Scandinavia."
<H3>Comments on Poland's Relationship with Russia</H3>
Eric Person calls Russia Poland's "best candidate for an early
aggressive attack."
<P>
About Poland and Russia, John Pitre says that he
"cannot see them getting along.  Very much like Russia/Austria in
standard Dip. Poland's
first move has to be to cripple Russia.  If they can survive to the
midgame together they can be
valuable allies, but early on they are going to be at odds."
<P>
Tom Potocki says,
"Kill Russia ASAP."
<P>
Earle   Ratcliffe says the relationship is
"Strained at best.  If this alliance is successful, it becomes
problematic, as Russia has nowhere
else to go.  It usually means cooperation against Ukraine and Germany.
Look at the map.  From
Ukraine, Poland will probably get Hun, Rum and Ode.  From Germany, Berlin
and maybe Fra
and/or Ham.  Russia would get Sev, Kie and Kha from Ukraine, and Den from
Germany.  The
new Polish empire extends from the Baltic to the Black, leaving Russia
nowhere else to grow.
Turkey is a possiblilty, but is either very strong, with its own share of
Ukraine,  or it's been
eliminated by Egypt, who will seal off the Med from any Russian fleets.
Either way, any further
growth by Russia will be slow, so he'll look the the path of least
resistance, the Pole.  Of course,
from a Polish standpoint, R/P is much preferable to R/U."
<P>
Toby Tyrrell calls Russia
"the weakest nation in the game and is all that stands between
Poland and an edge of
the board.  It must be a natural target."
<P>Comments on the Polish Relationship with Ukraine</H3>
Earle Ratcliffe likes the alliance.
"Poland-Ukraine is strong, and Russia seems to be Poland's natural
enemy."
<P>
Eric Person calls Ukraine a
"Good candidate for early friendship, but also for an early stab."
<P>
Tom Potocki's advice is to
"make sure that Russia and Ukraine do not do a deal.  Use Ukraine to kill
Russia.  Then kill  Ukraine."
<P>
John Pitre agrees.
"If Ukraine is supporting Russia you have a problem.  You have to work to make
sure that the two of
them are fighting. If not..."
<P>
To Earle Ratcliffe, Ukraine is
"probably a better alliance choice than Russia.  There isn't as much overlap, as
Ukraine has no northern
fleets.  Ukraine can more easily turn south after Russia is done with, as
Ukraine has two ports on
the Black, as well as access to the Balkans for further growth.   In this
case, Bielorussia should
definitely be Polish, as it would be very awkward for Polish armies to
march around it into
Russia."
<P>
Chuck Carroll
"tends to prefer the P/U alliance over P/R, at least in part
because of the naval problem --
since Ukraine can't build fleets in the north, that's one less northern
naval power Poland has to
worry about.  Also, in a P/U alliance, after Russia is defeated Ukraine
still has Turkey and Italy
to worry about, while if Poland and Russia take out Ukraine, Poland will
look very tempting to
Russia."
<H3>Comments on the Polish Relationship with Germany</H3>
John Pitre calls the Polish-German relationship
"tricky. You have <b>got</b> to get germany on your side and get the GP frontier
declared a DMZ. If
they are attacking you, you have a big problem.  At the same time, you
dont want them in the
Baltic."
<P>
Eric Person finds the relationship essential:
"Friendship with Germany or death for Poland. A German ally can also help
pave the way for
growth into Hungary and beyond."
<P>
Derek Carlson considers
"going after the German foolhardy, similar to Germany and
Austria's standing in the
standard game.  The gains just aren't there are you are giving up key
SC's to Russia or Ukraine
and then you would have a formidable enemy on your back."
<P>
According to Earle Ratcliffe,
"Poland should never go to war with Germany in the early years.
Neutralize Prussia and Silesia
(and Saxony if you can), and go east."
<P>
Tom Potocki says:
"Ally with Germany.  Direct German military ambitions West.  Put together
an anti-German F/B
alliance in the West to keep Germany busy, then offer Germany whatever he may need as
she is your ticket
into the Balkans and Scandinavia! Just make sure she stays busy in the
West."
<P>
"Attacking Germany in the homeland does not look too attractive" to
Chris Barnes.  "Poland
would have to maintain a unit in Silesia for survival's sake until Berlin
falls, and even without Berlin Germany still has plenty of fight left in
her.  Most likely Poland would need so much help that the other powers
would
get most of the German centers.
What could be very attractive, though, is to provoke German-French
problems.
Anything that assures that Germany will stay out of silesia is good."
<H3>Comments on the Polish Relationship with Italy</H3>
"Italy can't hurt Poland much," says Eric Person.
"It's great for Poland if Germany & Italy are
at war, and in order to promote this war as well as cultivate friendship
with Germany, Poland should do everything possible to help Germany in an
anti-Italian campaign."
<P>
Tom   Potocki calls for
"peace over Cze/Aus.  Just don't let Italy win Central Europe or dominate it.
If he gets too strong
there, aid his enemies.  If he is taking a drubbing, aid him."
<P>
John Pitre says that Italy can be helpful.
"If the two of you can be friendly then Italy may throw a center
or two in Central Europe your way...."
<P>
Earle   Ratcliffe says that
"Italy makes a good ally, as it can help against two of Poland's enemies:
Germany and Ukraine.
But it really depends on your ally.  If allied with Ukraine, you want
Italy to build fleets and head
off to the Eastern Mediterranean to distract Egypt/Turkey.  If allied with Germany,
you want the same thing,
but maybe for him to head west instead.  Make sure he doesn't try to
bounce you in Cze if you
didn't go for it in Spring of '95.  Any war between Italy and Poland is going
to be long, probably more
of a border skirmish, due to the distance of home centers."
<H3>Comments on the Polish Relationship with Britain</H3>
John Pitre says the relationship with Britain is one of
"long range distrust: he has fleets; he will be in scandinavia - that
can't be good."
<P>
Eric Person characterizes it as
"distant friendship. Promote a B/G war, but make sure you do nothing to
annoy Germany. Britain
can be a great ally against Russia."
<P>
Earle Ratcliffe says that
"like Italy, Britain makes a good ally, and can help against two of
Poland's enemies: Germany
and Russia. Britain isn't a great threat to Poland, as fleets can only
take two Polish centers
(Gdansk and Lithuania).  Once he gets a few armies on the continent, he's
trouble.  By then, his
position will be unassailable, and he'll be very difficult to stop.  At
any rate, he probably won't
make it very far inland against you, as there are easier gains elsewhere.
Make sure he doesn't
come to dominate Scandinavia, perhaps more than anyone else, because if
he does, you're not
getting one little bit."
<H3>Comments on the Polish Relationship with France</H3>
Eric Person hopes for distant friendship with France.
"It would be nice to make sure that France and
Germany don't become <b>too</b> cozy together -- that could spell a German
explosion eastward."
<P>
John Pitre would like the French "to keep Britain busy."
<P>
Says Earle Ratcliffe:
"It depends on your relations with Germany.  If Germany's hostile, then
France makes a great ally.  If Germany's friendly, you want him to head
off into Spain, while Germany takes on Britain."
<H3>Comments on the Polish Relationship with Turkey</H3>
Eric Person's advice is to look for
"dormant friendship early, then a strong active one to take on Ukraine.
A T/E war is nice."
<P>
Says Earle Ratcliffe:
"Turkey makes a good long-term partner for Poland.  You can both benefit
from a long Ukrainian/Russian war, perhaps one taking one side and the
other taking the other side.  Information exchange is vital, to maximize
both Turkey's and Poland's gain, and when Russia and Ukraine have
sufficiently weakened one another, Poland and Turkey can pick up the
pieces."
<P>
John Pitre notes that
"you would like them to put pressure on Ukraine, but until you get into the
Balkans, Turkey is only your enemies' enemy."
<H3>Comments on the Polish Relationship with Egypt</H3>
Eric Person says,
"promote an Egpytian war with Turkey, not Italy. Italy will hopefully have its hands
full with Germany/France."
<P>
Earle Ratcliffe wonders,
"what relationship??  Well, if Italy is hostile, he can open a second
front, but it will take a year at
least to do any real damage.  You want Egypt to leave your Turkish ally
alone as much as possible."
<H3>Comments on the Polish Relationship with Spain</H3>
Eric Person says the Pole should
"hope that Spain, Britain, and France all keep each other busy and
achieve only stagnant growth.
Spain, Britain, and Egypt are all nice for information sharing purposes,
as Poland can't really touch any of 'em until the endgame. This distance
often promotes mutually beneficial info sharing."
<P>
Earle Ratcliffe refers to his own advice on Egypt.
"Basically, it's all the same, just replace 'Turkish' with
'French.'"
