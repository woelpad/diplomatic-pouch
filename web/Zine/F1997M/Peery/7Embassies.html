<B>Introduction<BR>
</B>
<P>
Okay, so you've just gotten suckered into your first PBEM Dip game
that features huge amounts of press; and you've suddenly realized
that you know absolutely nothing about the country you've been
assigned to play.  What do you do?<BR>

<P>
Panic?  No!  <BR>

<P>
You could do what Manus does, appoint a committee to find a solution
to your problem.  Or you could do what Simon does, pass the buck
to Thad Black.  Or you could do what Vincent Mous does, con somebody
else into writing your press for you.  Or, if all else fails,
you could adopt a Peericratic approach to the problem.  Here's
what I would suggest.<BR>

<P>
Take advantage of the power of the Net and make it your own. 
Each of the seven powers of the regular Diplomacy game have Web
addresses for their embassy in Washington (and probably in your
country as well unless you are in The Maldives or Vanatu) and,
usually, a separate one for tourist
information (a few combine both into one site). Check
out the site, find the appropriate official, and send him/her
an email and explain your situation.  Ask them for information.
 Believe me, you'll get more than you ever dreamed of.  <BR>

<P>
<B>Background<BR>
</B>
<P>
I started doing this when I was in high school back in the early
1960s (Long pause for shocked silence, followed by gasps, and
then &quot;My God, is he really that old?  --- The answer is yes.
 How old?  Old enough to have advised God on the creation of <i>le
monde</i>.)
<P>
During my days as a Model United Nations participant (along with
other local Dip legends Rod Walker, Conrad von Metzke, Hal Naus,
<i>et al.</i>)  I regularly wrote various embassies and UN delegations
asking for help.  I always got something.  The quantity and quality
varied greatly but I always got at least an interesting letterhead
for my collection.  The most personal response I got was from
the Ambassador to the United Nations from the Maldives who also
served as that country's ambasador to the USA, Canada, Mexico;
and Foreign Minister.  He was the brother of the elected Sultan
who ruled The Maldives at that time.  He sent me a hand-written
note on what looked like a brown bag from Sammy's Deli in NYC
and an invitation to contact him with any questions.  Questions
and answers followed and I actually got to meet him (no brown
bag lunch, however) years later.  The French UN delegation, on
the other hand, sent me boxes of information, press releases,
background notes, pictures (including an 8 by 10 inch glossy of French
President Georges Pompidou), and put me on every mailing list
in France.  I was still getting their newsletter when I finished
my university studies six years later!

<P>
Today it is all much easier, of course, you can just crank out
a form letter and send it out by email; and you'll get a lot of
form letter responses.  But if you take a few minutes to write
a letter that can't be answered with a form letter, and address
it to a person (even the wrong person) by name, you'll probably
get a personal response and personal help.  I have experienced
this recently with some communications with the Belgian Embassy
in Washington.  It took six people to provide the information
I had asked for, but they did it.

<P>
Here's a bit of background for you U.S. players. Most embassies in Washington,
D.C. are located along and around Massachusetts Ave.  They range
from old mansions to ultra-modern buildings, and some have both.
 Staffs range from a few dozen to over a thousand people.  Technically,
the embassy exists to support one person, the ambassador to the
United States from that country.  In practice, the embassy is
a living organism with its own unique character because individual
ambassadors come and go, although a few of them have been in Washington
almost forever.  Today most ambassadors are professionals, although
Washingtons still attracts (and sends) a few political appointees
to choice spots.  Each ambassador is supported by a team of experts
(who are supported by their own experts and specialists) covering
a variety of fields: political affairs, military affairs, economic
affairs (now perhaps the most important sub-field), cultural affairs
and, of course, intelligence.  All embassies worthy of the name
have a resident spy or two.  Normally the spy in charge is a second
secretary or counselor, and the grunts, so to speak, are found
among the embassy's chauffeurs and support staff.  An area that
is getting more and more attention from embassies (and national
tourism offices) is tourism.  It can mean big bucks to a foreign
country.  Your initial query will probably go to the embassy's
press and information office; which handles most incoming mail.
 From there, with luck, it will go to the appropriate office or
official.

<P>
Keep in mind that each embassy reflects the current status of
the relations of that country with the United States.  Information
on that subject, among others, can be found in
<a href="http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/index.html">The
Department of State's Background Notes</a>.

<P>
It also helps to know something about the current situation in
the country.  For general background information on countries,
<A href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/inatl/front.htm">The
Washington Post's International site</a> can't be beat.
<P>
For the latest news on a specific country consult a wire service,
such as <a href="http://www1.netcom.com/bin/webnews?World">WebNews
- Up-to-the-minute news</a>

<B>The Diplomacy Embassy Grand Tour<BR>
</B>
<P>
So, let me take you on a personal guided virtual tour of eight
(Eight?  Yes, eight!) key Diplomacy &amp; diplomacy embassies
in Washington and related sites.  You may wish, as we go along, to check out each
site on the Web.  I've provided a URL (and Simon, clever guy that
he is, has no doubt put in a direct link for you to use) so you
can find them.  I wanted to list them in order by the date of
accrediation (which determines the hierarchy and pecking order
in Washington protocol), but I couldn't find that information.
 Instead, I'll use the traditional Diplomacy ranking.  <BR>

<P>
For each site, I'll provide a list of the most important types
of information it provides, a numerical ranking (from 1, low,
to 5, high), and perhaps a comment on the over-all impression
I got of the site.  <BR>

<B>Austria</B>

Washington, D.C.</a>

<a href="http://www.austria.org/">Austrian Press and Information
Office, Washington, D.C.</a>
<dd>
The Austria of today is a far cry from the Austro-Hungarian Empire
of WWI days.  Since then Austria has managed to rid itself of
all of its problem children and retains only the most important
parts of its former empire: The Vienna State Opera, the Hotel
Sacher and its torts, and Hamel's coffee shop.  Despite, or perhaps
because of, its shrunken size, Vienna is a major player in today's
international diplomacy.  Vienna is second only to New York in
its number of UN employees, for instance.  There are more than
100,000 foreigners in Vienna working for various international
organizations and corporations.  And 
Vienna claims, with some justification, to be the &quot;capital
of Eastern Europe.&quot;  It is appropriate then for the Austrian
Embassy's Press and Information Office to be our first stop.

<P>
The hardest thing for any Dipper or diplomat to do in Austria
is to get behind the surface veneer or mask of whipped cream that
Austria uses to hide much of what it is thinking.  Most Dippers
and many diplomats think that all of Austria is just like Vienna,
and that is a big mistake.  Vienna is no more Austria than New
York City is the United States, as many UN delegates assume. 
There is another Austria.  To understand it you have to brush
up on your 1930s Austrian history and take a look at current domestic
Austrian politics.  If you do that, you'll see that there is much
more to the Austrian psyche than just whipped cream and pastries.

<P>
The Austrian Embassy site is a barebones site for essential information
and contacts only.  However, their Press & Info site includes everything
except a recording of The Sounds of Music.  Very nicely done with lots
of info: home page, news, tourism, history, cultural, staff, and other
organizations.  It also includes a variety of links to sites in Austria.

<a href="http://www.embassy.org/embassies/gb.html">British Embassy,
Washington, DC</a>

<a href="http://britain.nyc.ny.us/">British Information Service</a>
<dd>
Surprisingly, the British Embassy's site in Washington was the
hardest to locate on the Net.  I tried several searches and failed
each time.  As I tried and failed I kept telling myself that they
had to have one, but maybe it was a secret.  Eventually I did
find it and when you study the address you'll see why it was so
hard to find.  Leave it to the Brits.  As you would expect from
our best friend and worst enemy overseas, the Brits have a killer
presence in Washington.  Their Embassy is only slightly smaller
than the White House, and the British Ambassador lives better
than the Queen.  So what does this site have to offer us?

<P>
Britain is going through another of her occasional post-midlife
crises.  For years the Brits have preoccupied themselves with
The Royals and a variety of sitcoms as a means of diverting themselves
from the real problems that face them.  Now, with Tony Blair in
charge of a massive Labor majority in the Commons, Britain is
making up for lost time.  For better, as some think, or worse,
as some fear, Blair is moving Britain into the 21st century. 
One thing is certain, Britain will never be the same.

<P>
The British have followed the Austrian example.  The actual Embassy site
is pretty basic, but the Information Service site is filled with lots of
goodies: home page, news, tourism, history, staff, other organizations
and more.  I loved the graphic that combined the British and American
flags.

Again, not surprisingly, the French Embassy's site is one of the
most sophisticated, computerwise, on the Net.  The French don't
make it easy to use, however, if you don't speak French.  But
if you stick to it, and make use of all their links to other organizations
and publications, you will eventually find what you want.

<P>
France is another major European power that is undergoing a stressful
period.  Most of the French believe it is possible to have both
a Big Government and The Good Life.  They are unwilling or unable
to accept the notion held by some other Europeans that that is
not possible in an integrated Europe.  The conflict resulted in
the overthrow of the old regime and a shift toward a more socialist
one, a trend seen recently throughout Western Europe.  France
has still not come to grips with some key internal problems: reforming
its education system, dealing with a large immigrant population
of Arab muslims, and finding a proper balance between the needs
of Paris and the demands of out-lying cities and regions.

<P>
But here too there are signs of change. France has changed, at
least on paper, its policy in Africa. France is reforming its
military. And France is trying to find a way to rejoin NATO, now
that NATO is more of a European police force and less an anti-Russian
Empire military force.  Still, when all is said and done, the
French will do it in their own good time and in their own way
and, as always, with style.

<P>
The French Embassy site is technically the best of all of them,
but it does have some problems (e.g., I couldn't access it at all
on a Friday afternoon during the busy summer season.). It includes
all the basics: home page, ministry, news, tourism, cultural,
staff, and other organizations links, but I found that many of
the sites I picked led directly to French language only sites.
 Lots of information available, but not always user-friendly.
 <p>
I tried twice to access the French Info site and couldn't get through
either time.  They seem to be very popular.  Maybe Simon has some info
on it?

<dd>
Germany is in the midst of a three-way dilemma that has caused
some real angst at home.  First, the absorption of the former
East German states has not gone as smoothly as Bonn would have
hoped.  The initial euphoria of being &quot;one again&quot; quickly
wore off as both west and east Germans realized that there were
real differences between their peoples and their economies.  The
recent flooding in eastern Germany has helped restore some of
that old &quot;oneness&quot; spirit.  We'll see how long it lasts.
 Second, Germany is in the process of reevaluating its past/current
orientation toward Western Europe, and particularly its close
ties with France (coming at the same time that the French are
becoming more and more preoccupied with their internal affairs,
this is a problem for all Europe). Third, Germany is trying to
decide whether to turn, once again, to the east and fill the power
(this time economic) vacuum left by the collapse of the USSR and
its Eastern European empire.  Finally, the power of the German
mark and its general economy will determine the fate of the new
single currency, the Euro.  And on the success of that may well
depend the future of Western Europe.  
<P>
A very well done site with home page, ministry, news, tourism,
cultural, staff, and other organization links.  Very thorough
and well organized.
<p>
There is also a second Embassy site that includes some information on
the new German embassy in Washington with details on everything, except
the keys to the wine celler. It was interesting to me to note that the
new site and building cost just over $18M.  By comparison, the land
alone that the US embassy in Tokyo sits on is worth about $200M!
The German information site is typically efficient and informative, just
what you would expect from the Germans.

<B>Italy</B>
<br>
<a href="http://www.italyemb.nw.dc.us/italy/">Embassy of Italy,
Washington, DC and Italy Info</a>

<dd>
Italy is another country with serious problems, although the average
foreign tourist doesn't see them, and the average Italian doesn't
seem to care about them.  Still, the signs are there.  The division
between the wealth of the north (centered in Milan) and the poverty
of the south (centered in Naples), with Rome stuck in the middle
somwhere; continues to divide the country.  Whether Italy really
is a country is another matter. Regional loyalties and rivalries
are as strong as ever.  Perhaps the one thing that unifies all
Italians is their common dislike for the central government's
bureaucracy.  Italy continues its long term love-hate relationship
with the Mafia and despite some notable successes the Mafia isn't
going to go away until something better comes along to replace
it.  Italy is finally coming out of its self-imposed isolation
in foreign affairs and recently participated in a peace-keeping
(or peace-making as it is becoming known) police action in Albania.
 Unfortunately it wasn't a sterling performance by the Italian
military.  The flagship of the Italian Navy went aground during
one phase of the operation; and some soldiers of one of Italy's
Army's elite fighting units got into trouble with civilians, resulting
in the resignations of several generals.  For some reason civilian
government authorities seem unable or unwilling to understand
that soldiers do not make good cops, unless they are properly
trained.  On the other hand, I don't think I would want members
of the NYC Police Department doing a police action in Haiti after
reading the papers recently.

<P>
The Italian Embassy site looked good until I started trying to
access the individual pages.  A lot of them aren't connected.
Still, the basic information is there: home page, news, tourism,
 and cultural links.  They say the site is in an &quot;experimental&quot;
state; an Italian euphemism for &quot;it probably won't work.&quot;
 However, the audio version of the Ambassador's Welcome and the
National Anthem came through loud and clear.

<dd>
Russia finally got a Net site.  After the collapse of the USSR
it was questionable when or if it would ever happen.  Today, instead
of dealing with one centralized government of the USSR, Washington
has to cope with embassies from all kinds of new republics. <BR>

<P>
What can I say about Russia in this limited space?  Not much,
except to say that in my opinion as a student of Russian affairs
for the past thirty-five years, Russia is going down the tubes
fast.  If you want my views on that, you need to check out my
own <a href=http://www.geocities.com/~peery>Dip&amp;dip home page</a>.
I have been
trying desperately to find something good to say about Russia's
current situation because I want them to make  good on this, their
first real experiment with democracy.  Unfortunately,  I can't
find anything favorable to report.  And, even worse, Russia's
past history offers no encouragement at all.  As for Russia's
future, I am completely pessimistic.  The Russians have always
lived on hope.  Now even that is gone.  Or it would be if they
really knew how bad off they are.

<P>
The Russian Federation site was done by a contractor and contains
only the bare points information: home page, news, tourism, staff,
and (!) some history.  That last link shows courage given the
current situation in Russia. The Russia info site is barebones and
mostly relies on email links to various other sites. It's a start.

<dd>
Turkey also has its problems.  Although it is a republic and a
democracy, Turkey is still a unique country in that it is partially
European, partially Asian, and partially Middle Eastern.  This
has both blessed and cursed it.  Currently the blessings flow
from Turkey's popularity as a reasonably priced tourist mecca.
 The tourists and their marks and dollars continue to flow into
Turkey, bringing a lot of  benefits to the country.  One important
by product is the growth of contacts between Turkish citizens
and foreigners of all kinds.  For better or worse, Turkey has
become a part of the western world. The curses come in the divisions
among its leaders fed by political rivalries and fueled  by religious
zealotry.  While the government's factions fight among themselves
in Ankara; the Army is waging its own war against Islamic extremists;
which the military sees as a threat to the democracy it guard;
and against the Kurds in its southeast and neighboring Iraq. 
<P>
The Turkish Embassy site was very basic: home page and staff.
The Turkish info site is a pleasant surprise.  It is not quite as fancy
as some of the others, but the information is well presented and very
comprehensive.  One treat I discovered was the ability to send a virtual
postcard by email from a Turkish city.  I sent 6 to friends in Israel
and they all got there!  Maybe there's something to be said for the

<dd>
I would bet money that the Swiss embassy in Washington has had
more Internet hits on its web site in the last month or so than
all the other embassies I have mentioned combined.  Why, you ask?
 Because of the posting of the list of  Swiss bank accounts that
may have belonged to victims of Nazi Germany, I reply.  One look
at this site will tell you that in normal times the Swiss embassy
is preoccupied with economic affairs.  Now, it is obviously devoted
to damage control over this highly sensitive issue.  You won't
find all the information on this subject on this site, of course.
 For that you need to look elsewhere as well.  But you will find
the official statements of the Swiss Government, and those are
quite revealing in their own way.

<P>
The Swiss Embassy site was one of the best with a home page, news,
tourism, history, cultural, staff, and other organizations links.
 It also offered a good source of news and documents on the Swiss
role in WWII, including the Gold.

<B>Conclusion<BR>
</B>
<P>
I know I have painted a pretty dark picture, especially in light
of some of the pie-in-the- sky sentiments currently being put
out by the mass media, but that is my peerispective;  and from
a national perspective that's the way it is.  Does this mean Europe
is going to take its diplomacy into a Diplomacy game scenario?
 Not necessarily.  Although the individual nations of Europe,
including the traditionally most powerful ones, are having some
serious problems, many of the mid-sized and smaller countries
are playing a bigger and bigger role in moderating European affairs.
 In addition, many international and European organizations are
assuming a greater and greater responsibility for Europe's external
and internal affairs. (All of these organizations have Web sites
of their own if you are interested.)  If individual nations cannot
solve their foreign and domestic problems, perhaps the collective
nations can.  A wide variety of economic, cultural, social, and
even political organizations are taking more and more power from
the traditional states.  Even NATO has a new lease on life with
its recent expansion into Eastern Europe (even though I oppose
it, it may be good for the Europeans) and a new role as Europe's
policeman on the beat.

<P>
I can't tell you what will happen to our contemporary Diplomacy
board next.  I doubt if anyone can.  But I do know that the changes
aren't through yet.  However, if anyone can give you some of the
information you need to keep track of what is happening in today's
European Diplomacy and diplomacy, these embassy sites can.
