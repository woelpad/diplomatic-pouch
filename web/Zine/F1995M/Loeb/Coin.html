<h1><center>Flipping a Coin by E-Mail</center></h1>
<HR><P>
Each player secretly picks either
<UL compact>
<LI>two 150 digit prime numbers, or
<LI>three 100 digit prime numbers
</UL>
and then multiplies the chosen numbers together.
<p>
Then, each player sends the result (each a 300 digit number) to the
other player via e-mail.
<P>
Notice that even with a very powerful computer, the receiving player
can not factor the player's 300 digit number, <b>nor even determine how
many factors it has.</b>
<p>
When both e-mails have been received, each player then announces to the other
the factors which were multiplied to form the product.
It is "easy" to check that the factors do indeed multiply to form the
announced product, and that the factors are really prime (using a
probabilitic primality test available in <i>Maple</i> or <i>Mathematica</i>,
for example).
<p>
<ul compact>
<LI>If one number is the product of two prime factors and the other is the
product of three prime factors, say the result is "tails."
<LI>Otherwise (if both numbers have the same number of factors), say the
result is "heads."
</ul>
