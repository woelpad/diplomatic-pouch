<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The <i>Art of War</i> was written about 2,500 years ago in China by Sun Tzu.
It is not one of the most famous books ever written -- the average person has
probably never heard of it (though probably many Diplomacy players have).
But it is one of the most famous military treatises written because it is the
oldest surviving one and quite possibly the first one ever written.  For
interested readers, the <i>Art of War</i> is available free online through 
<A HREF="http://jg.cso.uiuc.edu/pg/lists/list.html">Project Gutenberg</A>.

In my opinion, a good player of the game of Diplomacy must not only be a good
diplomat, but a good strategist.  I also believe that a successful military
leader (in the <i>real</i> world) must be not only a good strategist, but a
good diplomat as well.  Because I see the two as being strongly enmeshed,
when I heard about Sun Tzu's <i>Art of War</i>, I was very interested in
reading it to see if I could find principles that apply to the game of 
Diplomacy in a 2,500 year old document.
<p>
The <i>Art of War</i> is divided into thirteen chapters.  Because Diplomacy
is limited in scope, some of the chapters such as <i>Terrain</i> and <i>The
Attack by Fire</i> do not apply (though they still make for fascinating
reading).  Others are very relevant.  It is these that I will focus on and
add some of my own thoughts to.  I welcome any comments or stories of
situations where the applying (or not applying) the principles discussed
below have affected the course of a game you played in.  These will appear
in next issue's Pouch Deposits, or if I get enough of them I'll print them
up in a followup column in the next issue.
<p>
Sun Tzu was unknown by his comtemporaries until after he wrote the <i>Art of
War</i>.  The treatise brought him to the notice of King Ho Lu, who appointed
him as a general, and his military genius led to his becoming a legendary
figure.  Sun Tzu was not giving advice to strategy game enthusiasts, he was
fighting wars in ancient China.  Yet many of the strategies that we Diplomacy
players have discovered and rediscovered, on our own or from watching and
listening to other players, are by no means novel.
<p>
2,500 years ago, these principles were novel.  War was more or less a
disorganized free-for-all, and as far as is known, organized principles
of military strategy did not exist (at least in written form) until The
<i>Art of War</i>.  It is said that Sun Tzu, commanding an army of 30,000
men, defeated an army of 200,000.  Had Sun Tzu's opponent known of those
principles, or had a similar set of principles of his own, the outcome
would most likely have been different.
<p>
Many of the points that I focus in on may seem obvious.  While the novice
Diplomacy player may come away from this article with some knowledge that
will improve play, many players will not.  If you are looking to improve
your game and are not a novice, this article probably won't be of much help.
I found it interesting that I could read principles of military tactics
that were put to paper (parchment?) two and a half millenia ago, and
find familiarity in them.  If you do as well, please read on.
<p>
<b>The <i>Art of War</i></b>
<p>
In the <i>Art of War</i>, Sun Tzu says: 
<p>
<UL><i>
The art of war is of vital importance to the State.</UL></i>
<p>
Perhaps this is self-evident.  He also says: 
<p>
<UL><i>
The general that hearkens
to my counsel and acts upon it, will conquer.... The general that hearkens
not to my counsel nor acts upon it, will suffer defeat.</UL></i>
<p>
What he's really saying with these two statements is &quot;you've got a
really important problem, and I'm the one who can tell you exactly what
to do about it&quot;.  Pretty bold words considering he wasn't appointed
as a general until after he wrote the <i>Art of War</i>.
<p>In a chapter called <i>Laying Plans</i>, Sun Tzu says:  
<p>
<UL><i>
According as circumstances are favorable, one should modify one's plans.
</UL></i>
<p>
This is really one of the key points to being a good Diplomacy player:
flexibility.  It doesn't mean one should play haphazardly.  Rather, it
means you shouldn't stick to a plan to the point where it interferes
with your play; don't exclude potential opportunities to improve your
situation purely because it would mean changing your plan.  Of course,
changing your plan may have other costs which need to be taken into 
account.
<p>
I used to have a problem with this.  I would make a strong commitment
to an alliance and receive one in return.  I would then abandon the
border with that ally to use my units to attack somebody else.  As you
would expect, I got stabbed.  Twice (in two games).  By the same person
- Mike Frigge.  How does that saying go &quot;stab me once, shame on 
you, stab me twice, shame on me&quot;? 
<p> I have since learned better.  
Mike already knew better.  He didn't make the alliances with the
specific intention of stabbing me, but when I left him a with an
undefended or underdefended border, he changed his plan and attacked
me.  The obvious lesson I learned from those games was not to leave
borders open, even with allies.  But the meta-lesson, and the more
important one, is to remain flexible and always be willing to shift
tracks if you have something to gain from it.
<p>
Sun Tzu also had the following to say:
<p>
<UL><i>All warfare is based on deception
Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we
must seem inactive;
Hold out baits to entice the enemy.  Feign disorder, and crush him.
If he is secure at all points, be prepared for him.  If he is in superior
strength, evade him.
If your opponent is of choleric temper, seek to irritate him. 
Attack him where is is unprepared, appear when you are not expected.</i></UL>
<p>
This is one of the key distinctions between Diplomacy and other strategy
games.  In many games it is to one's advantage to hide one's intentions,
or even to distract an opponent's attention from what is really going 
on, but only in Diplomacy are trickery and deception key tactics used
actively and offensively to get what you want.  The game of Diplomacy
requires skill not just in negotiating peace or a plan for attack with
player A on player B.  You need to be able to mislead others, let them think
you are doing one thing when you are doing another.  A good Diplomacy player
can get another player to do things his way.  An excellent player can
manipulate an opponent into doing things his way, while convincing the
opponent he is getting things done his own way.  Dan Shoham mentions some
of these points in his <A HREF="/Zine/F1995M/Shoham/EOG.html">column</A> in this issue.  
<p>
Sun Tzu calls these methods &quot;indirect methods&quot; in a later chapter
(<i>Energy</i>), and goes on to say:
<p>
<UL><i>In all fighting, the direct method may be used for joining battle,
but indirect methods will be needed in order to secure victory.</i></UL>
<p>
Examples of indirect methods are: hiding order beneath disorder,
simulating fear, keeping the enemy on the move, holding out baits to 
manipulate an opponent's actions - just the kind of tricks a Diplomacy
player may use.
<p>
Another relevant point made is:
<p>
<UL><i>Now the general who wins a battle makes many calculations in his
temple ere the battle is fought.  The general who loses a battle makes but
few calculations beforehand.</i></UL>
<p>
Okay, so perhaps the word &quot;temple&quot; doesn't quite fit in these 
days, but the idea does.  In Diplomacy, you can gain a tremendous advantage
by playing out the possibilities into the future.  Try to predict what
the other players will do.  When deciding on your own moves, consider 
not just what will happen this move, but also the next move or two after
that, and try to estimate how others will react in response to each of those
moves.  Determine the worst thing your opponent can do and consider
the chances of him doing it.  Do you play conservatively or take risks?
Do you assume worst-case, or try to determine the most-probable moves 
which may not be worst case?  It's all a big numbers game, and the more
calculation you do, the better off you'll be.
<p>
Sun Tzu has the following to say in the chapter <i>Attack by Stratagem</i>:
<p>
<UL><i>Supreme excellence consists in breaking the enemy's resistance without
fighting.  Thus, the highest form of generalship is to balk the enemy's
plans; the next best is to prevent the junction of the enemy's forces;
the next in order is to attack the enemy's army in the field....</i></UL>
<p>
Here, I believe that Sun Tzu was stating the above ranking in terms of
minimizing the cost of war (military expenses, lost lives, etc.), in
which case it is preferable to not engage the enemy in actual fighting.
But you can look at this also in the context of Diplomacy.  Why else do
we set up DMZs or arrange for non-agression pacts with neighbors?  You
have a limited number of units to use against opponents.  It requires
fewer units to disrupt an opponent's plans (say, by convincing his
neighbor to attack him) or to keep enemy units at a distance by bouncing
them than it does to defend against supported attacks.  Any place you
reduce the need for the presence of your units means you have more units
to concentrate elsewhere, against other enemies.
<p>
<UL><i>If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result
of a hundred battles.  If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every
victory gained you will also suffer a defeat.  If you know neither the
enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.</i></UL>
<p>
In Diplomacy, the above applies not just to your enemies, but to all
players; even an ally is an opponent in terms of the game.  The more you
know about your opponents, the better will be your chances of outguessing
them, predicting their moves, deceiving them and manipulating them.
<p>
Most players have at some point been in a situation where they knew or
could guess what another player would do, from
watching their style of play or through press, and used that knowledge
either to attack them or successfully defend against an attack.  It is
also quite probable that somebody has successfully predicted what you
were going to do in the same manner.  Thus, if you assume other players
have the same goal, the above quote has an obvious corollary: don't let
your opponents know you.  For some reason Sun Tzu's two separate
statements of this corrolary appear only several chapters later:
<p>
<UL><i>Let your plans be dark and inpenetrable as night...</i></UL>
<p>
and 
<p>
<UL><i>Do not repeat the tactics which have gained you one victory, but let your
methods be regulated by the infinite variety of circumstances.</i></UL>
<p>
In <i>Tactical Dispositions</i> Sun Tzu says:
<p>
<UL><i>The good fighers of old first put themselves beyond the possibility
of defeat, and then waited for an opportunity of defeating the enemy.
To secure ourselves against defeat lies in our own hands, but the
opportunity of defeating the enemy is provided by the enemy himself.
Thus, the good figher is able to secure himself against defeat, but
cannot make certain of defeating the enemy.  He wins his battles by
making no mistakes.  Making no mistakes is what establishes the certainty
of victory....</i></UL>
<p>
Two important lessons for Diplomacy players: to make yourself as
invulnerable to attack as possible, and to not make mistakes.  If there
is the possibility for you to be attacked, there is the possibility for
you to lose.  It's usually not long before players achieve understanding
of the concept of stalemate lines.  Once your position is secure, you 
have much more freedom to plan your moves and look for an opening for
an attack of your own.
<p>
Not making mistakes is perhaps obvious, but that doesn't stop people.
That includes myself as well.  I recently was in a game where I had
set up a stalemate line and guaranteed a win though it would take me
a while to get the last SC.  To hold my stalemate line, I had one unit
that could either support another unit of mine or attack a neighboring
enemy unit.  I accidentally made a mistake with my orders and attacked
my own unit, letting my two opponents take that SC.  I reestablished
the stalemate line, but without that SC, the game will now end as a
3-way draw instead of a win.  Some bad moves are not recognized as 
such until after the fact, but considerable effort should be made to
avoid making outright errors such as this.
<p>
Another piece of advice from the <i>Art of War</i>:
<p>
<UL><i>There are [several] dangerous faults which may affect a general: 
(1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction; (2) cowardice, which
leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by 
insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame</i></UL>
<p>
These are things to avoid in yourself, and things to encourage and
take advantage of in others.  I've mentioned a couple of these points
above.  Dan Shoham spoke about hasty tempers in his
<A HREF="/Zine/F1995M/Shoham/EOG.html">column</A>, and the idea of honor
has come up countless times in discussions on whether or not stabbing
is right or wrong, fair or unfair.  The question of honor came up in
Stephen Lepley's <A HREF="/Zine/F1995M/Lepley/Incoming.html">column</A> as well.
<p>
I'll just close with another quote from the <i>Art of War</i> which I
happened to like and which I think sums things up nicely:
<p>
<UL><i>The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the
enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not in
the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have
made our position unassailable.</i></ul><p>
