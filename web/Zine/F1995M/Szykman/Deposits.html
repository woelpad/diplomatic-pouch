<p>
In the last issue of <B>The Diplomatic Pouch</b>, Manus lavished
copious praise on Andy for putting in so much effort for mastering
the game DipPouch.  After helping me out by formatting the Pouch
Deposits and a column in HTML, Andy suggested I might want to do
the praise thing again.  But I thought about it for a while and
decided that the amount of work he puts into the game is so
monumental compared to a little HTML coding and that such lavish
praise now would only take away from the praise received before.
And I couldn't do that so such a nice guy, could I?  (But thanks,
Andy!).  I added a few late arrivals, so any mistakes are probably
mine.
<p>
In keeping with Manus' original idea for the Pouch Deposits, I'll
bring up another topic for people to think about and reply to.
Since as I write this my own article isn't finished, I won't be
writing a column on the subject - I'll just throw it out for
discussion and we'll publish any replies in the next issue:
<p>
The topic: play-by-Email Diplomacy vs. face-to-face Diplomacy.
What do you see as the merits and disadvantages of one versus the
other?  Which are you more involved with?  Which do you prefer
and why?  Feel free to discuss postal Diplomacy as well, though
I supect that readers of this publication will be more heavily
involved with PBEM and FTF Diplomacy than postal play.  You
can send replies using the &quot;Dear DP...&quot; form or by
Email directly to me or Manus (see the bottom of this page for
addresses and a link to the form).  
<p>
I'd also like to take this opportunity to start a new addition to
the Pouch Deposits section that will appear when there's material
to put in it.  It's called the <i>Rants and Rave Reviews</i> section
and will contain kind words, positive feedback, criticism and
lunatic ravings that we receive by E-mail.  This issue's section
contains one item from the first category and one from the last.
Boy, I just love that second one.  It's just close enough to English
that you can tell it's a compliment for The Pouch, but not so 
coherent that you'd mistake the writer for somebody sane.  That 
person perfectly captured the subtle line between English and 
jibberish, and walked it like it was a tightrope.  Keep those rants
coming. We can't promise to print all the ones we get, but I'd love
to feature a few of the best ones.

</H3> <B>Regarding the Greatness of Diplomatic Pouch when viewed
via Netscape 1.1:</B> I finally managed to gain control of a
Netscape copy at work and of course the first [<I>to be honest,
the third</I> :-) ] WWW home page I tried was The DipPouch.<P>
You may remember that I complained about having only Lynx to
read it and that I asked to provide the unlucky non-WWW-surfing
world with a text-only ftp-able version. While I still think
that this would be a good idea I have to admit that the DipPouch
looses <B>a lot</B> by looking at its text only. <P> Looking at
it with Netscape is like changing from hearing to viewing!<P>

Congratulations on the great work which I hope to be able to
enjoy a long time<P>

<h3>From Jonathan S. Tan (<A
HREF="mailto:jontan@mit.edu">jontan@mit.edu</A>)</H3> Ok. Here
are my thoughts about Tyrolia, which you may wish to include in
the next issue of DipPouch.<P>

<DL>

<DT><B>(1) Tyrolia - used by Italy to attack Austria</B><P>

<DD>As a beginner, I always thought that <samp><B>A
Ven-Tyr</samp></B> and <samp><b>A Rom-Ven</samp></B>, followed
by an attack on Austria, was Italy's best strategy.  Even though
this plan usually works in gaining Trieste and Vienna, Italy's
mid-game is short-lived.  With just Russia, Turkey, and Italy
left in the east, Italy is naturally the next power to get
eliminated for a number of reasons:<P>

<UL>

<li>Russia & Turkey have a natural division of centers which
gives Russia Rum, Bud & Vie, with a continuing alliance.</LI><P>

<LI>An IT alliance gives Turkey easy control of the east, where
Italy will be the next after Russia to be eliminated.  The IT
alliance is good for Italy when it is necessary for IT to grab
the eastern stalemate line to prevent a solo-win of one of the
western powers (or to stop a western alliance from entering the
east)</LI><P>

<LI>The IR alliance is very difficult to maintain.  Once Austria
and Turkey are eliminated, it is almost natural for war to break
out between Italy and Russia along their newly created long
border of abundant supply centers.</LI><P></UL>   <P>

In conclusion, my advice for beginners playing Italy is
<B>not</B> to attack Austria 1901.  The only time I have seen a
successful early attack on Austria by Italy is when Austria was
a gullible beginner and Italy suckered Austria to attack Russia
and Turkey while marching into Vienna, Trieste & Greece in 1901!
Another interesting consequence of the Italian opening of
<samp><B>A Ven-Tyr</samp></B> and <samp><b>A Rom-Ven</samp></B>
is that if Germany suspects that Italy will attack Austria in
this way, and Germany wants to help Austria, then <samp><B>A Mun
H</samp></B> followed by <samp><B>A Mun-Tyr</samp></B> will make
Italy look rather foolish.  Germany can then help Austria gain
back anything that is lost.</LI>

<P>

<DT><B>(2) Tyrolia - used by the AI alliance to balance the
western powers, provide defense, and allow flexibility.</B><P>

<DD>Tyrolia can have a very useful purpose for the AI alliance
in the beginning of the game.  The immediate goal of an AI
alliance is to eliminate Turkey while maintaining the status quo
in the west.  The opening move <samp><B>A Ven-Tyr</samp></B>
(with <samp><B>A Rom-Apu</samp></B> and <samp><B>A
Nap-Ion</samp></B>) achieves this in a rather subtle way.  When
the western powers ally against each other 2 on 2, then the
power allying with Russia is at a disadvantage of one unit.
<B>Aha!</B> The Italian army in Tyrolia can provide the balance
and keep the status quo in the west while Italy and Austria
attack Turkey. For example:<P>

<UL><LI>If EG have FR outnumbered, then Italy's army in Tyrolia
can be used to harass Munich or provide French support into
Munich.</LI><P>

<LI>If EF have GR outnumbered, then Italy's army in Tyrolia can
provide support for Munich, or swing over to Piedmont to harass
Marseilles.</LI><P>

</LI> <LI>The only 2 on 2 combination that Tyrolia becomes
useless against is FG vs. ER, but then Tyrolia can always be
used to stab Austria or move up to Boh and maybe beyond to help
AI attack Russia.</LI><P>

<LI>If the western powers ally 3 against 1, well then you can
just hope the alliance breaks apart and you can reestablish the
balance of power.</LI></UL><P> 

The opening move of <samp><B>A Ven-Tyr</samp></B> is also very
useful for defense in the AI alliance.  It is good protection
against an early western triple and prevents <samp><B>A
Mun-Tyr</samp></B> and <samp><B>A Mar-Pie</samp></B> from
gaining a supply center.<P>There is an even more subtle
advantage of the opening move <samp><B>A Ven-Tyr</samp></B>.  If
Turkey does not trust Russia and orders <samp><B>A
Con-Bul</samp></B>,<samp><B>F Ank-Con</samp></B>, and <samp><B>A
Smy H</samp></B>, then Italy can forgo Tunis and Austria can
loan Vienna with the fall moves <samp><B>F Ion-Aeg</samp></B>,
<samp><B>A Tyr-Vie</samp></B>, <samp><B>F Con-Aeg</samp></B>,
and <samp><B>A Smy-Con</samp></B> leaving Ank open for Turkey's
build even when Russia and Turkey are allied!  <I>(The initial
purpose of <samp><B>A Smy H </samp> </B>  is that if Russia
moves to the Black Sea, then Turkey can build F
Ank.)</I><P>Finally, if Italy and Austria are counting on
Russia's help in attacking Turkey then Austria can order
<samp><B>A Vie-Bud</samp></B> and the move <samp><B>A
Ven-Tyr</samp></B> can help Austria defend Vie and Bud in case
of a Russian stab with <samp><B>A War-Gal</samp></B>.</LI></UL>

<P><DT><B>(3)  Tyrolia - key to the last eastern stalemate line
in the endgame.</B><P>
<UL> Tyrolia is the key to the last eastern stalemate line (all
17 eastern supply centers minus Mos, War & Tun).  Oftentimes,
one or two eastern powers must jump to the stalemate line or
grab the stalemate line when a western alliance is attacking the
east. Tyrolia is one of the key provinces in this battle.  If
the western alliance can take and hold Tyrolia, then the eastern
powers are without a stalemate line for their defense.</DL><P></UL>

So, in conclusion considering <B>(2)</B> and <B>(3)</B>, Tyrolia
can be a very strategic province in all phases of the game.<P>

<HR> <center><H2>Mail Concerning Danny Loeb's Diplomacy
Programming Project</H2></center> <H3>Exchange Between Danny Loeb (<A

and Simon Szykman
(<A HREF="mailto:simon@diplom.org">simon@diplom.org</A>)
</H3> <B>Regarding the Diplomacy Programming Project:</B> 
<P><b>DL:</b> It has come to my
attention that the "refined evolutionary search" described in my
S1995M DPP article in DP is a special  case of the technique of
simulated annealing used in artificial intelligence.
<P><b>SS:</b> Did you mean genetic algorithms?  I'm pretty familiar
with both genetic algorithms and simulated annealing,
and what you described in your column sounded more
like the former than the latter
<P><b>DL:</b> Tell me a little about both and I'll let you know.
<P><b>SS:</b> Okay.  MAJOR simplifications here, just to give you the idea.
<P>
With Genetic algorithms, you encode a state in a simple representation
(such as but not necessarily a binary string).  You have a population
of a number of such states.  You then evaluate them according to some
fitness function that says which are good and which are bad.  You have two
different operators which act on these states.  A recombination operator
takes pairs of strings, splits them up and recombines them into two new
strings which replace the previous two (i.e. the two parents have 
passed on their genes to a new generation).  The likelihood of a state
being chosen as a parent depends on it's fitness function value, so that
the higly ranked (most fit) have a higher probability of passing on
their genes.  As this process repeats, the average fitness of the
population because the most highly ranked are the ones that tend to
contribute to subsequent generations.
<P>
The second operator is a mutation operator, which takes some aspect of
a state (such as one binary digit in the binary string) and tweaks it
(with a binary string, a 0 would be changed to a 1 or vice versa).  This
introduces a random element in the process.  Statistically, mutations
that improve fitness tend to get passed on and those that reduce fitness
tend not to, because the probability of passing on genes is based on
the fitness of each state.
<P>
Simulated annealing:  you have an initial state and a set of operators
that can perturb that state to give you a new state.  You also have an
evaluation function that lets you evaluate them (the fitness function
above is essentially an evaluation function as well)
<P>
The algorithm is as follows.  Apply an operator at random and evaluate
your new state.  If it's better than the previous one, you automatically
accept it.  If it's worse, you may accept or reject it according to
some probability.  This probability is a function of a parameter called
temperature.  The temperature starts out high and decreases with time,
and therefore the probability of accepting a step to a worse state
starts out high and decreases with time.
<P>
Genetic algorithms are based on evolutionary concepts.  The population
improves because the best designs contribute to subsequent generations
and inferior ones tend to die off.  Simulated annealing is based on the
annealing of metals, in which a metal is heated to a high temperature
and is slowly cooled to eliminate internal stresses.  The probabilistic
behavior of the state in simulated annealing is similar to the motion
of molecules in metals in real annealing.
<P><b>DL:</b> Very interesting.
Funny thing is I guess I was aware of the work on genetic algorithms
done by some graduate students while I was an undergrad at Caltech,
but I seem to have not made the connection.
(They were working with Turing machines.)
<p>
In any event, my "Refined Evolutionary Search" is essentially
Simulated Annealing (except that I didn't call the mutation rate
"temperature"). 
My Strategy Finder does not consider more than one set of orders at a
time for any alliance.
<p>
On the other hand, your genetic algorithms sound like an even better
idea. Especially when searching for moves for a large power/alliance.
When doing recombination, I would tend to keep orders for neighboring
units and coordinated orders "together". 
That way a good attack from one set of orders and a good attack for
another, could be combined to make a set of orders with 2 good
attacks.

<B>Regarding Danny Loeb's Diplomatic Pouch Contributions in
general:</B> Danny,  Congratulations on your great achievements
for the Hobby. I am already addicted to your 'papers' in the
Diplomatic Pouch.  I wanted to write to ask you for two older
articles you wrote, according to <cite>Diplomacy, A-Z</cite>.  
One was the <cite>Openings Library</cite>, but I reckon it is <A
HREF="../../S1995R/Library/Openings.html">the one I just read</A>
in the DP. Right?<P>

The other is about the game <SAMP><B>Fontenoy</SAMP></B>, in
Issue 300 of <cite>Chapter Two</cite> (1992).   Can you tell me
whether this is still available, and where? I do love the Chaos
variant. It reminds me of Middle Ages history, when feudal
regions were slowly welded into national states. Is that what
your article is about? If not, I'll write one!<P>



<B>Danny Loeb's response:</B> I can't find issue 300 of EPC2.
Please tell me if you can find it.  <I>(Manus, could you put out
a request for people to find these back issues... Thanks.)</I>
My article was an End of Game statement for the first Chaos game
run on a judge.  Why don't you write such an article, I'd love
it. I'd also like to see a survey of the various Chaos game
played so far on the net.<P>



<B>Marc continues:</B> I used to make computations about the
number of possible openings in a standard game of Diplomacy. I
soon abandoned the task as a hopeless waste of time. Most such
'openings' had no diplomatic pertinence, and I had no objective
criterion to decide which were to be incorporated, and which
not.  I think the first thing to do is make clear what you are
looking for. I did it in a game-theory setting, to build the
payoff matrix of the normal-form game.<P>



<B>Danny's response:</B>



I suppose you saw  <A
HREF="../../S1995R/Misc/Blast.html">the article</A> (reprinted from EP)
about the total number of
openings for each country. I counted 2 openings as being
different if there was the possibility of some moves by the
other 6 players such that the 2 openings would lead to distinct
final positions.  This number is just a matter of trivia, so I
didn't eliminate any "stupid openings".<P>   The normal form of
the game of diplomacy is even bigger than what you estimated.
The payoff matrix is a 7 dimensional matrix indexed by different
strategies. A "strategy" is a rule which says what a player does
in every possible legal situation (the number of military
situations was counted in another EP article, and is a REALLY
huge number, the number of situations including the history
leading up to it is of course infinite). The extensive form of
the game is a type of tree structure. This is probably what you
are referring to.<P>

<B>Marc continues:</B> Problems were:

<UL><LI> How to measure the gain in the long-term.</LI><P>

<LI>How to incorporate the negotiation element in the strategy
vector.</LI><P>

<LI>How to estimate appropriate subjective prior probabilities? 
Manus Hand's <I>(is this a pun, or what?)</I> proposal to
compute the number of A01 positions seems easier; but the use
for a game theorist is naught.</LI><P>

 <LI> And... are you French or American (or some place
else)?</LI></UL>

 

Any answers?<P>





<B>Danny's response:</B> In the normal form of the game, the
gain can be measured by the end result, and translated into a
number using for example the hall of fame's scoring system.
However, what you want to indicate is the approximate heuristic
value of a position AFTER ONE MOVE. (Just like chess programs
use static evaluation on the leaves' of their search tree, you
propose estimating the position after one move for the purposes
of creating a game matrix.)<P> My Bordeaux diplomat contains a
static evaluation module as part of the strategy finder.
However, you should be aware that even very small changes in the
estimated values of the resulting positions may cause huge
changes in the Nash equilibria (optimal strategies). (Barney
Pell and I observed similar behavior while analyzing the game
Stratego.)<P>

I'm not sure what you mean by strategy vector.  Of course, there
may be multiple Nash equilibria. Negotiation will hopefully
allow a player to choose a strategy corresponding to a favorable
Nash equilibrium.<P>I'm American but I live in France<P>

I've been told that my article on the Backseat Driver variant has

who publishes a postal 'zine called <b>Dipsomania</b>.  Jef will
be running a game of this variant in his 'zine.  Given the frequency

</H3> <B>Regarding Manus Hand's article on Missing Man
Diplomacy:</B> 

I  forgot to congratulate on such an interesting site - and I'm
not even halfway through.  Regarding your most enlightening 

<A
HREF="http:../../S1995M/Hand/Missing.html">Missing Man article</A>,
two more thoughts popped up in my mind:

<OL><LI>Have everyone give orders for the MM, and select one set
at random every turn (increases playing time, though). Nobody
can be sure of an MM suicide then.</LI><P>

<LI>Have everyone give orders for the MM, and select the set
that will result in the MM occupying the most supply centers
after adjudication, or failing that have its units adjacent to
the most supply centers. This requires experienced players,
though, and might be helped by computer support</LI><P></OL>



<B>My response:</B> <OL><LI>Yes, but the MM rules I described
have the advantage that everyone knows whom to conduct diplomacy
with on each turn and also the very interesting and deep
subplots of trying to make sure that this or that player does or
doesn't get control of the vacant power for a certain
phase.</LI><P><LI>Ooh!  I like this.  Great idea!  Actually, it
would be as if the Game Master were playing the vacant power,
and he only writes the orders for these powers after knowing
what the other powers are doing.  (<I>Well, that's going a
little far - or is it - will this be a guaranteed win for the
Master?  I actually think not.  Certainly worth a
playtest!</I>)<P></OL>


<HR> I tried to come up with something more eloquent than Manus' closing
comments last issue, but I couldn't.  So here they are again:
<p>Well, there you
