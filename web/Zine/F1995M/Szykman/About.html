<H3>Where's Manus and Who's this Simon Guy?</h3>
Manus has been completely swamped with work and was unable to complete the 
publication of the Fall 1995 Movement issue of <b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b>.
Rather than risk the possibility of a delay in publication of several days,
he enlisted my aid in order to get the issue out only a couple of days late.
I seemed like the prime candidate for help, having been appointed &quot;all
around good fellow&quot; in the last issue.  With Manus' plug for me:

<UL><i>In fact, it looks like I can continue to count on him for all of this.
He's kind of my co-publisher.  (Yes, this clinches it:  he's beyond hope.)</i></UL>

I certainly couldn't say no.  (It's almost as if he knew back then...)
<p>
Manus hopes to have the word &quot;weekend&quot; back in his vocabulary 
sometime in the near future, and will hopefully be back in our little 
corner of the world soon.  In the meantime, I hope I can do justice to
<b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b>, Volume 1, Number 3, Fall 1995 Movement.  
<p>
Finally, I'd like to thank all our contributors and acknowledge the help of
Andy Schwarz for HTMLizing the Pouch Deposits and a column, and Stephen
Beaulieu for converting several text tables into nice-looking (for Netscape)
ones and translating some files in Mac format into ones that we could work
with.

<H3>New Blood!</H3>
In this issue, we have two new columnists debuting.  We welcome new regular
and non-regular contributors, so if you have any interest in writing for The
Pouch, see the <A HREF="../../About.html#Contributing">procedures for submission of articles</A>.

<H3>Late Breaking News: New Distribution Medium for The Pouch On Horizon</H3>
Stephen Beaulieu has announced that he is going to be setting up an automatic
mail server to allow people to retrieve text versions of articles appearing in
<b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b> via email.  The system is still being set up, but
look for an official announcement shortly.<p>
Once PouchCorp builds up enough of a financial base, we will again
begin dropping copies of the 'zine from airplanes, in order to
expand distribution to people without access to the Internet.  However, since
there is no charge for subscriptions to The Pouch, it is as of yet unclear 
where this financial base will come from.  We are hoping to catch the eye of
a rich philanthropic Diplomacy enthusiast.  Until then, we will remain an
electronic publication.  Although The Pouch will soon be available to people
without access to the web, our attorneys assure us that we can continue to
call <b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b> the first Diplomacy 'zine on the web.
