<center><H1>Incoming!</H1> <H2>Further Reflections from a
Diplomacy Newbie<p><i>Stephen Lepley</i></H2> </center> <HR>
Having played miniatures and board games with others as
a youth, I did not feel prepared for Internet Diplomacy.  In the
final analysis, Diplomacy has a lot to do with interpersonal
relations/communications and only a little to do with the board.
One must admit that "Diplomacy" is well named.<P>
The integrity disputes in the game and on the newsgroup are a
little surprising.  Knowing that lying is a legal part of the
game, it is remarkable that people get upset about the Diplomacy
lie.  It seems, however, that integrity disputes will always be
associated with Internet Diplomacy.  As long as people have
emotions, feelings are going to get hurt and disappointment will
lead to verbalization.  Months of game play followed by a lie
and stab easily turns into a real dispute.  By the way, it seems
to be good policy to side (in a minor way) with someone in one
of those disputes.  They so appreciate your understanding of
their positon that they give you just about anything you want.
Well, at least it worked that way when I tried it.<P>
I feel a sort of remorse when helping to wipe out another
player.  You get to know the guy, even a bit about his personal
life.  Then, you wipe him out and he is gone!  If you only play
a few games a year like most of us, you never see him again.
Did he give up Diplomacy in utter disappointment?  Will you ever
see him?  Was it worth it to try to understand him so well, just
to see him disappear into the net?  Does he now hate you and is
he seeking revenge someday? <P>
As game two was wrapping up, I reevaluated my desision to play
Diplomacy.  More than once in the past, I felt as if I would
quit for good. There is another challenge left for me though. I
mean, besides getting that first solo victory.  The thing I like
most about the game is getting to understand the tactics and
personality of my opponents as well as the social aspects.<P>
Some of you may recognize me as the individual trying to start a
fixed Diplomacy group.  Well, I did.  We finally got 8 players
together and our first game is underway.  Most of us are
middle-aged with all the numerous responsibilities that come
with time.  I look forward to analyzing the play of these
fellows over time and learning how to get what I want out of
them.  Not only that, I am hoping to build some real friendships
as we play.  Maximize the social value of the hobby.<P>
This is not simply another Diplomacy experiment. I am hoping to
eventualy wind up with a group of guys that will play Diplomacy
over the years.  Share their games and lives. This group is my
final Diplomacy challenge. I'm looking for that feeling we had
when we went over to our friends house and spent the night
playing in giant "miniatures" games, eating pizza, drinking soda,
and having a good time.  I never will understand why that one
guy marched his camel corp right into my heavy riflemans'
killing zone. "Pete" was his name.  I used to love
outmaneuvering Pete.  He took it so badly!  Miniatures teach one
to play your advantage for all it's worth while keeping the
opponent from exercising his advantages until it's too little
and too late.  I once caught a group of heavy knights in a swamp
with my archers.  Wow, half way across they were routed.  When
they turned and ran, none made it out of the other side!  Don't
come sneaking up the backside of my castle!<P>
I'm going to stick with Diplomacy for awhile now.  By limiting
the number of games I play to only one or two at a time, the
load should remain bearable. Now, If I could only figure out why
that Turkish player wants me (Russia) to let him into the Black
sea on the first turn? Egads, could he possibly be trying to
outmanuver me?  Nah! :-)  Wait a minute!!! Pete, Is that you?<P>
