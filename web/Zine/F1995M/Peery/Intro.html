<p>Greeting!
<p>
I want to begin by telling you a true story.  
<p>
Sometime back in mid-1993, or was in 1989, because it could have been either;
or perhaps it was both: I was writing an article for a zine and in it I made
a reference to the painting of the Mona Lisa.  As I was writing an image of
the Mona Lisa flashed into my head, just as it probably did when you read
that name a nanosecond ago.  For some reason a question popped into my mind,
&quot;What color eyes does the Mona Lisa have?&quot;
<p>
It wasn't an earth-shaking question, but it continued to bug me.
<p>
I looked in my art books, but they couldn't tell me.  I called the Library
and talked to the art librarian.  She said she would get back to me on that
one.  
<p>
A few hours later she did.  &quot;I looked at eighteen different fotos of the Mona
Lisa,&quot; she said, &quot;but not one of them clearly indicates the color
of her eyes.  I'm sorry, we can't help you.&quot;  She was clearly embarassed.
<p>
&quot;No problem,&quot; I said, &quot;I've been looking for an excuse to go to Paris,
anyway.&quot;  
<p>
And so I went off to Euro DipCon l.  
<p>
I did get to the Louvre and I did see the Fair Lady (for the second time,
actually).  Ironically, even standing in front of the portrait you couldn't
tell what color her eyes were.  It's actually quite a small painting.
<p>
It was a quiet, weekday morning, no big crowds, although the Mona Lisa always
attracts a crowd.  The whole room will be empty, but there are always a
half-dozen or so people gazing on her gentle face.
<p>
But for once, I had her to myself.  I did what anyone would do.  I leaned
forward, across the guard rope, and peered (!) more closely through the
bullet-proof glass that covers the painting.  I guess I peered a bit too much
because all of a sudden the alarms went off.  I had crossed the invisible
death-ray guarding her.  
<p>
Within ten seconds I was surrounded by guards.  Obviously, the question was
 &quot;What are you doing?&quot;  I produced my passport, my press ID, and, much to his
embarassment, my host, who just happened to be a member of the French
President's personal security detail.  Much French (not mine) and much
hand-waving (not mine) and (I did get this much) , &quot;He's a very important
American Diplomat.&quot;  
<p>
I explained, as best I could, that I was just trying to determine the color
of her eyes.  I asked the guards, et al. &quot;What color are they?&quot;  Puzzled
looks, head-shaking, raised eyes, shrugged shoulders, and &quot;'eh?&quot;  Was the
response.  More French flew across the by now rapidly growing group in front
of the Mona Lisa.
<p>
Finally, a curator was called.  He looked just like what you would expect a
curator in the Lourve to look like.  Depardieu he was not.
But he listened to the guards, and my host, and looked at me, and smiled.
&quot;Good question,&quot; he said in excellent English, &quot;let's look.&quot;
He reached into his pocket, fiddled with something, and then moved the rope
aside.  
<p>
Cheek by cheek we moved closer to her.  No alarm.  Finally, perhaps six
inches from the glass, we stopped.  We both peered.  
<p>
&quot;Brown.&quot; he said.<br>
&quot;Hazel.&quot; I said.<br>
&quot;Brown!&quot; he said, a bit more firmly.<br>
&quot;Hazel!!&quot; I insisted.<br>
&quot;Why?&quot; he asked.<br>
&quot;Because.  My mother had exactly the same colored eyes and she said her eyes
were hazel, just like her name; and that was why they named her Hazel.&quot;
&quot;I see,&quot; he said.  &quot;Well, two beautiful women must be right.  They are
hazel.&quot;
<p>
So, although I didn't play very well in the European Diplomacy Championship
event, I did capture the Mona Lisa.  Beats the hell out of any black dot I
ever captured..
<p>
Please accept the above as any one of the following:<br>
     1) A thank-you note for the first two issues of TDP<br>
     2) A submission for a future issue.<br>
     3) A sample of my writing, as part of a solicitation to become one of
your contributors (for further references you may check with Conrad Minshall
or Cal White.  Both know me).<br>
     4) A random act of Peeriblah as part of my 30th anniversary in the
Diplomacy hobby.<br>
     5) All of the above.<br>
<p>
I recall some time ago you, or one of your people, sent me a query about TDP.
 I replied, saying that if you published a couple of issues, I would review
your efforts and let you know what I thought.
<p>
I have seen a small part of what you have done.  Only a small part because my
modem is very slow and it would take forever, and cost an arm and a leg, to
download and print all of your stuff.  Pity, because I would like to see
more.
<p>
But that will have to wait until we get a faster modem.
<p>
In the meantime there are things going on here that may be of interest to
your readers.
<p>
First, the WWPDC.  This is a seven game tournament in team style with some 60
participants from 10 countries.  The teams represent the United States,
Austria, France, Italy, Sweden, the Commonwealth, and a motley international
collection.  It is just getting going.  About 25 of the participants are on
The Net.  
<p>
Second, I am in the process of trying to organize a meeting on The Net of
international hobbyists interested in setting up an international Diplomacy
organization of somekind to assume responsibility for the World Diplomacy
Con, among other things.  I could use some help on that one.
<p>
Third, I probably know as much about the international Diplomacy hobby as
anyone.  
<p>
What else?  Peeriblah, I suppose.  However, if you want me to help I will
revive my original zine title for a column for you.  That was XENOGOGIC,
first published on 1 May, 1967, as a Diplomacy zine, and first published as a
column back in mid-1963.  <br>
<i>[A piece entitled XENOGOGIC appears in this issue. -Ed.]</i>
<p>
When we finish up-grading our systems here I will be glad to make somekind of
contribution to your effort.  Right now I'm trying to catch up with the rest
of you.
<p>
Regards, good luck, and much success.
