<b>Executive Summary</b>
<p>
     Last weekend Diplomacy hobbyists from both the PBM and PBEM communities
gathered face-to-face in San Diego, California and on The Net for a
discussion of two important hobby issues: WORLD DIPCON V; to be held in
Paris, France this coming fall; and a possible proposal for a World Diplomacy
Organization.<p>
     Taking part in this historic hobby first were Diplomacy fans from the
United States, Sweden, England, the Netherlands, Italy, and New Zealand;
including many well known publishers and players from both the PBM and PBEM
hobbies.

<p>
     Several hundred messages flowed back and forth as the participants
exchanged views and tested The Network's potential as a forum for future
hobby meetings.
     A complete report follows...

<p>
<b>WDC/WDO Internet Meeting Report</b>
<p>


  <b>   Introduction</b>
<p>
          When Mark Nelson called it "a typical gradiose (sic) Peeriblah
project" I knew I was on to something Hot!  But what better way to celebrate
one's birthday, host a Diplomacy convention, and enjoy a beautiful summer
weekend in San Diego, California; than with a few close Dippy friends (as
well as some total strangers)?  Especially if they happened to be scattered
all over the world?
<p>
  <b>   The Idea</b>
<p>
          At first it seemed like a simple idea, to gather interested
Diplomacy hobbyists from around the world for an on The Net discussion of the
World Diplomacy Convention (WDC) to be held this coming November/December in
Paris, France; and an exchange of ideas about a potential "World Diplomacy
Organization (WDO)."
<p>
   <b>  Pre-Event Planning</b>
<p>
          As far as I knew nothing like this had ever been attempted in the
hobby before, certainly not by me.  All I had to guide me in planning the
event was my past experience in hosting FTF Diplomacy event, my very limited
exposure to the PBEM Diplomacy hobby, my even more limited exposure to The
Net; and Mike Maston's advice on AOL.
<p>
          It took me all of one afternoon, if that, to broadly outline what I
wanted to do.  Part of the choices were based on how I conceived the event,
and part were dictated by the real and imagined capabilities of our hardware
and software.  As I thought about it I kept telling myself that this was just
a one time expeeriment to see if an event like this would work.
<p>
          I decided to limit the event to a single three day period of time,
to coincide with this year's PEERICON, to be held from 28-30 July.  I also
decided to limit the participants to people I thought would be proactively
interested in the subject matter; and who wouldn't be intimidated by the new
approach I was trying.  My first two emailings went to some 39 individuals
drawn from the Worldwide Postal Diplomacy Championship event who I knew had
an email capability; and PBM Diplomacy publishers listed in the latest ZINE
REGISTER (available from Pete Gaughan if you don't have one) as having email
addresses.  The names were about half and half, from each list; and also,
about half and half, in prior email contact with me.  I designed what was
probably an overly complex system for keeping the on-going discussion under
control and moving.  I was determined that things wouldn't get out of control
or bogged down as they have at many Diplomacy conventions I can remember.
 Above all, I wanted to keep things moving forward.  
<p>

          I could tell, looking over my notes and outline, that I was trying
to do too much too fast.  The challenge of developing a new procedure and
making substantive progress on issues of importance, and controversial issues
at that, was too much.  I decided to focus on getting the procedure down
first, and put aside any hidden agenda I might have for this event.  My role,
this time, would be to guide and observe, not mobilize the troops.
<p>
  <b>   Event</b>
<p>
          Once I had a plan on paper, I sent off a very rough proposal to a
couple of hobbyists whose opinions I value.  I was looking for someone with
more experience than I to run the event.  Alas, no volunteers.  Still, the
first feedback was sufficiently positive to keep me going.  With less than
two weeks to go, I had a pretty good outline of what I wanted to do.  The
question was, would anyone be interested?
<p>
          On Friday, the 28th, in the afternoon I sent out the first
announcement on the event, and immediately followed it up with the second,
more detailed, set of instructions on how to participate in the event.  Most
of those who got the announcements had no idea they were coming.  It was a
random broadside, partially because time was short, and partially because I
wanted to see how fast and how efficiently this email system could work.
<p>
          To summarize: of the thirty-nine or so original names I sent the
first two messages to: 6 were returned by servers for one reason or another;
16 did not respond; 5 sent "regrets" and 12 responded in one or more messages
over the next sixty hours, during which time the event went on.

<p>
          A total of approximately 160 messages were sent out (mostly in four
large mass messages to all thirty-nine names, even those who didn't reply
immediately continued to get the key event messages).  Approximately 22
messages of substance were returned to me and, to some degree, circulated
among those participating.
<p>
          If you are interested, I guesstimate we used about 6 hours of on
line time (at US$6 per hour) for this project.
          What I know now, but did not know at the time, was that we were
using the wrong software to achieve our goal.  The AOL "carbon copy" feature
limits the number of names in any given address book to 10 or so.  So, I had
4 different lists to deal with, and the lists were not connected.  As a
result each participant could send and receive messages only to and from
those in his group, not all thirty-nine names.  As a consequence, some people
got very little mail.  This was the biggest single snafu of the event.  Had
we had a better mailing list program we would have been far better off,
although I might well have been over-whelmed by it all.  
<p>
          Most messages were short, less than a page.  Only one or two were
more than two pages long.  Most of them were well written.
<p>
          In terms of substantive content I detected a certain amount of
curiousity about the event itself (Would it actually happen?  Would anybody
participate?) combined with more than a little positive support.  Perhaps,
for once, Peery had had a good idea.

<p>
          The discussion of the two major subjects was, as one might expect,
not as explosive as recent face-to-face or postal debates.  Mostly we got a
rehash of the same old views, from those who had any; a few new thoughts from
people who hadn't been involved in the discussion before; a frequently
expressed desire for more information about both topics; and a frequently
expressed and growing frustration with the French organizers  over their
handling (or non-handling) of WDC V, combined with a continuing loyalty to
the WDC concept.
<p>
          There was practically no real discussion of the WDO topic, perhaps
because it was too nebulous a concept, and partially because no one proposed
any "action items" to get people's blood flowing.
<p>
          With only one or two exceptions, the give-and-take and
follow-through I had hoped for never happened.  Considering the problem with
the address books and message distribution it is no wonder.
<p>
          The botton line, I guess, is that while what we had was good, there
wasn't enough of it to feed the hungry masses.  They all seemed to want more.
 Or to use a different metaphor, although critical mass was achieved, a
sustained chain reaction was not, or was it the other way around?
<p>
          For the record, the participants (in widely varying degrees) were:
Thomas Pasko, Paul Bolduc, Andy York, Pete Gaughan, Edi Birsan, Doug Kent,
and Jim Burgess from the United States; Per Westling and Roland Isaksson from
Sweden; Peter Sullivan from England; Lex Pater from the Netherlands; Davide
Cleopadre from Italy; and Brendan Whyte from New Zealand.  TDP was well
represented by Manus Hand, Mark Nelson, and Dan Shoham (in person, no less!).
 In addition, Ron Cameron (USA) and Francois Rivasseau (France) checked in on
the phone.
<p>
          Special thanx to Mike Maston and Esmeralda for their help in the
Control Booth.  Apologies to Mike Nagel and Tom Carlson who had to serve as
eyewitnesses to history, instead of makers of it.  Remember guys, "They also
serve who only watch and wait."
<p>
  <b>   Post Event Evaluation</b>
<p>
          Despite the obvious flaws in design and execution (only two weeks
prior notice, for a few; and only a few hours notice for many; and the use of
4 different address books), the event still got a 50% response; and drew many
highly favorable comments.
<p>
          The potential is there.  This kind of event, properly done, could
be a useful tool for the hobby.  People seem to be willing and able (in
various degrees) to use it.  The question is, what for?
<p>
 <b>    Recommendations</b>
<p>
          For myself, or any one else contemplating a project like this, I
have five specific recommendations:
<p>
               1) Provide more advance notice of the event's dates in both
hobby PBM and PBEM outlets.  Three months for the PBM community and one month
for the PBEM hobby should be sufficient.  Remember, no one date will satisfy
everybody.
<p>
               2) Allow a longer time frame for the event.  Sixty hours, or a
long weekend, isn't enough, especially because so many PBEM and email Dippers
apparently rely on their work or school email systems; and those seem to shut
down on the weekends, or aren't accessible.  I suggest a full week to allow
both groups ample time to have their say, collect input, and revise their
views.
<p>
               3) Try for better interaction.  It is obvious, but not to a
novice at this, that one's hardware, software, mail distribution system, and
service site need to be up to the job.  In particular you need a speedy
modem.  2400 baud isn't going to do it very well.
<p>
               4) Refine procedures.  Ideally they should be both
standardized and flexible.  If I have learned anything from this project it
is that the PBEM and email Diplomacy hobbies (I distinguish between the two
because some email users don't play PBEM Diplomacy.) are fragmented by
divisions caused by different hardware, software, and (gasp!) time zones.
 The Simultaneous Real Time of the Cyberworld runs head on into the Real Time
Real World of Eat, Sleep, and Work.  No one procedure is going to cover the
whole group.
<p>
               5) Tighten up your agenda; and allow participants to extend
and revise their remarks later.  A strict agenda will keep the discussion
focused and moving.  But also be sure to allow time at the beginning and end
of the event for participants to wind down and engage in casual chat.  Give
the contributors a chance to edit their own remarks before you publish
anything on or off line.  AND KEEP A HARD COPY OF EVERYTHING!
<p>
  <b>   Observations</b>
<p>
          For years I've listened to Mike (N6OPH) on the radio talking to
other amateur radio operators all over the world.   The first thing you hear,
always, is "Hello!  Hello?  Can anybody hear my radio?"  It wasn't any
different on The Net.  Just a different kind of static.
<p>
          As a Net Novice to both it was interesting to see the differences
between the PBEM and email Diplomacy hobbies.  I'd always assumed they were
the same.  They are not.
<p>
          It's more a "spider web" than a real "net."  They may call it
"snail mail" but 99.95% of it eventually does get through if it is properly
addressed.  Email loses 15% right off the top.  And don't forget about all
those "delays."  They are real and they are frustrating and they don't go
away.
<p>
          PBEM and email Diplomacy aren't as scary as the PBMers say; nor as
great as the PBEMers say.
<p>
          It was interesting to watch the interaction between the US and
overseas Dippers, and between the PBM and PBEMers.  I just can't decide who
the real foreigners are.
<p>
  <b>   Conclusion</b>
<p>
          I'm sure other Diplomacy hobbyists, from the PBEM or email groups
if not the PBM crowd, could have done this project better than I did (and
will now proceed to tell me so and how...).  Alas, nobody else seems to have
had the idea, or wanted to try.  Now, perhaps, others will.  If not, I may
give it another go myself.  Why not?
<p>
          Which brings us to my last thought.  Where do we go from here?
<p>
          Perhaps another one time, date specific, given subject with limited
participation event?
<p>
          Or perhaps something more, an on-going, open-ended, wide-open
discussion group for all hobbyists; or at least those willing to venture a
first tango in Cyberspace.
<p>

          Whichever, wherever, and whenever: if you'd like to participate in
the next WDC / WDO INTERNET MEETING drop me a message at PEERIBLAH on AOL, or
<A HREF="mailto:peery@ix.netcom.com">peery@ix.netcom.com</A>,
or send a real piece of mail to me at 6103 Malcolm Dr.,
San Diego, CA 92115, USA.  Sooner or later it's bound to happen, and I have a
feeling it is going to be sooner rather than later.
<p>

<hr>
<p>
Greetings!
<p>
I have just finished sending out the report on the first WDC/WDO Internet
Meeting to all who participated.  In addition, I have carefully reviewed your
feedback since last weekend.  Finally, I have given considerable thought to
the desirability of holding another WDC/WDO Internet Meeting.
<p>
In the balance, I have decided to give it another go.
<p>
Taking into account what the report says, I have or will make the following
changes:
<p>
1) The next meeting will be held from Saturday 0800 (my time), 28 October to
Sunday 2000 (my time), 5 November.  That should give everyone plenty of time
to participate regardless of their computer/network access schedule, or
personal affairs.
<p>
2) One mailing list will be used so everyone interconnects.  All who
pre-register to participate will get a list of participants before the first
session starts.
<p>
3) The agenda will not change (e.g. WDC and WDO, and Other). Anyone is
welcome to submit a pre-event position paper on either topic for
distribution.  The results of the meeting will be sent to the WDC attendees
in Paris.  If...
<p>
4) The same discussion format will apply.
<p>
5) Now that you all have plenty of warning about what's going on, I urge you
to publicize this meeting in your various PBM and PBEM publications.  I will
accept written, mailed statements sent to me, Larry Peery, 6103 Malcolm Dr.,
San Diego, CA 92115, USA so long as I receive them before 28 October.  Again,
only these topics should be addressed.
<p>
6) The whole point to doing this is to allow those hobbyists who are
interested in these two subjects but who will not be able to attend the WDC
in Paris to express their views and, equally important, have them presented
in Paris.
<p>
OK, the dot is in your space.
