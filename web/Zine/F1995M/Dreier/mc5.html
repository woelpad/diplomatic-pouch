I suspect you Candidate Masters worked it out. If you were playing France,
what would
you do? An answer like this is acceptable: "I would play FS for a whole lot
of moves. If
Austria <i>ever</i> played AC, I would win. If he kept playing AD, the position
would not
change. After many moves, I would try to sneak in an FA. Unless Austria
guessed almost
psychically, he would not play his AC exactly at the moment I played FA. So
I would win,
either with one of my many FS's against an AC, or with my one FA against
one of
Austria's AD's."
That is a good answer. Practically speaking, you can do extremely well that
way. Now
let's compose a proper, rigorous answer to the question. (This <b>is</b> a Master
Class, after all.)
<p>
Players choose moves. They choose their moves based on the position on the
board, of
course. They also choose moves based on their views of other players'
psychologies. But
we do not need to speculate about psychologies for our analysis. In the
world of game
theory, players choose Strategies. Some strategies are moves, but some are
not. A <i>Mixed
Strategy</i> is a probability distribution of moves. For example, here is a
mixed strategy for
Austria: Play AC with probability .5, otherwise play AD. That strategy can
be implemented
by flipping a coin and playing AC if it comes up heads, AD if it comes up
tails. Let's write
Mixed Strategies like this: [S1, .7; S2, .3]  We mean that the move S1 is
played with
probability .7, and the move S2 is played otherwise, with probability .3.
(Note for
cognescenti: we are using an oversimplified notion of a Mixed Strategy
here.)
<p>
We can specify an extremely good Mixed Strategy for France: [FS, .9; FA,
.1] Then
Austria can do no better than to play AD on the very first move (that is,
there is no Mixed
Strategy that does better against the given Mixed Strategy for France). And
this gives him
only a .1 chance of reaching a draw. Of course, there is an even better
mixed strategy for
France: [FS, .99; FA, .01]. And a better one than that. Is there a <i>best</i>
strategy for
France? Simply playing FS with probability 1 is <i>not</i> a best strategy for
France. For in
that case, there is a sound reply by Austria: he plays AD with probability
1. And then the
game drags on ad infinitum. There is no best strategy for France. But,
France can make her
probability of winning as high as she likes, up to but not including 1.
This is the sort of
situation that I call a "virtual force." One side can choose from a menu of
strategies, and if
patient can bring the chance of winning as close to 1 as desired.
<p>
Thus endeth the lesson. The particular endgame position I chose seems to be
fairly common. But of course, the main ideas generalize to other endgame
positions. I am always interested to see examples, so let me know if you
run across one.
<p>
<b>Two possible topics for another class:</b>
<p>
Mixing elements of chance into an endgame position. Do you have a .5 chance
of winning? How can we measure precisely?
<p>
Second-order virtual forces (a discovery of Dan Shoham's, developed by me).
Exotic topic, not terribly practical but theoretically beautiful. In
theory, but not on the Diplomacy board as it is currently known, there are
also higher-order virtual forces.<p>
