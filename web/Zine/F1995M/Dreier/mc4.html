All of this is quite interesting. But in point of fact, we don't really
need to analyze the 
French Berlin position to evaluate the French Munich position. Does this
surprise you?
<p>
FA is certainly one of the crucial sets of orders for France. And, we may
comfortably 
conclude, AC is one of the crucial sets of orders for Austria. For
consider. There is really 
no other set of orders for Austria that can counter FA. (There are minor
variants on AC, of 
course, but we will treat those as the "same move" as AC.) Straying in any
significant way 
from AC will leave Austria in a very bad position if France does order FA.
(A student asks: 
"What about the move fragment, Ber-Mun, Sil S Ber-Mun, Boh S Ber-Mun?" This I
am 
considering a "minor variant" of AC. The only reason I get to count it that
way is that it 
does not give results different from AC's in any relevant combination of
French and 
Austrian moves. Good question, though. Please verify my claim for
yourselves.)
<p>
A good general plodding sort of attack on endgame problems is this. Find a
plausible move 
for one side. (If there is an obvious "attacking" side and "defending"
side, look for the good 
attack first.) Find the best countermove for the other side. Then see
whether there's an 
obvious, all-around plausible move for the first side that trounces the
countermove. That's 
what we'll do now. We want to find a move for France that will outright win
against AC.
<p>
Now, there are many of these. AC is a very risky move. If France could just
hold Munich, 
by supporting it in place, and still have his double attack on Berlin,
using Baltic and Kiel, 
he would have his 18 centers. ("But what if it's a Spring move?" That
doesn't matter here. 
Once taken, Berlin and Munich will be easy for France to hold. Really, are
you sure you 
belong in this class?) Does it matter which one we choose? A bit, yes.
Since we have some 
choice in the matter, let's think for a moment about what other desiderata
there are.
<p>
Many seasoned endgame analysts, no doubt including many of you, will always
try to find 
the treasured "Safe Move." A Safe Move cannot lose ground against any
opposing move. 
A really good Safe Move should itself make some progress under some
(plausible) 
circumstances. And France, to her delight, has one of these. And it is one
of the moves that 
wins instantly against AC. So let's give her that move now. At a loss for
any creativity at 
the moment, we shall call it
<p>
<b>French Safety:</b>

A Lvn H,

<p>
Two of the Austrian armies bordering Munich are attacked by armies other
than A Mun, 
and Mun is twice supported. A Lvn is twice supported. No French unit can be
dislodged. 
So 'French Safety' is properly named. But against AC, French Safety (ok,
let's call it FS) 
wins immediately. For the resulting position holds Berlin and Munich, thus
18 centers, 
indefinitely, against <i>any</i> Austrian attack.
<p>
We now know of two French moves and one Austrian move. FS wins against AC.
FA 
leads to a yet-unevaluated position against AC. France seems to have so far
no reason to 
play anything but FS. If we can give him no reason, the position is very
dull. Can we? 
Sure. FS clearly does not force a win. Austria has a perfectly good reply,
in fact, many. He 
has to defend Berlin adequately; then there is no change in position after
the move. If 
Austria could actually make progress, dislodging A Lvn or even taking
Munich, the move 
that would do it would be a critical one. But there is no such move. As we
noted, "French 
Safety" is correctly named. So we need to find an Austrian move that leaves
the position 
unchanged when played against FS. These are a dime a dozen. I leave their
discovery as an 
exercise. Pick your favorite, call it AD (for Austria Defends).
<p>
Now we have two moves apiece. Let's chart the results of interactions
between pairs of 
moves in a little matrix. 
<P>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<TR><TD><TD><B>AD</B><TD><B>AC</B></TR>
<TR><TD><B>FS</B><TD align=center>-<TD align=center>w</TR>
<TR><TD><B>FA</B><TD align=center>w<TD align=center>?</TR>
</table>
</center>
<p>
The entries in the four cells in the table evaluate the results of pairing
the moves in 
question. The "w" stands for French Win. The dash means No Change. The
question mark 
is there because we have not evaluated the French Berlin position. Now, you
might expect 
that we couldn't evaluate the initial position at all until we can evaluate
French Berlin; but as 
I said, that's wrong. We don't have to evaluate French Berlin. The position
is a virtually 
forced win for France. How do we know?
<p>
To simplify, assume the worst for France. Assume that French Berlin is an
absolutely 
drawn position. (It isn't). Even in this worst case, France is sitting
pretty.

Now stop for a 
moment and figure out why. You needn't look at the map at all, just look at
the matrix.
