Austria's best reply seems to be what we will call "AC".

Verify that Austria takes Munich and Livonia, loses Berlin, and otherwise
the position is
essentially the same, with a couple of backrank units replacing forward
ones that have
moved up.
<p>
The new position we can call the "French Berlin" position. France has
traded Munich in on
Berlin, and lost his advanced army in Livonia.

Now, we could assess this position (though in point of fact, we will not).
Think for a few moments: is this position an improvement over France's
earlier position, which we may call "French Munich"? If you think of the
Mun-for-Ber swap as being a wash, then surely France's position has
deteriorated a bit, since she has lost her foothold in Livonia. But you may
think that she could regain that foothold, eventually, without any real
risk. (You'd be right, too.) Is the Mun-for-Ber swap a wash, is it a
positionally even trade, or is it better for France to be in Berlin, or worse?
