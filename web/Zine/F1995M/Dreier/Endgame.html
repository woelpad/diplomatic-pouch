Myself, I was looking forward to Dan Shoham's column. Then I discovered
that it would consist of a selection of his EOG statements. Disappointing.
I'd been hoping that he'd give some lessons. What's worse, Dan has
disappeared, so even the EOG statements are not to be expected for
near-future issues of The Diplomatic Pouch. So, I says to myself, "Stop
whining and do something about it." Here's what I decided to do about it.
<p>
Diplomacy players are full of advice (among other things). But not a whole
lot of it is terribly useful. Not very much Diplomacy advice generalizes to
principles that you can use in games. What little there is has been
assimilated by most reasonably advanced players, say, those who designate
themselves Experts (and some who too modestly register as Intermediates).
<p>
Herewith, a bit of endgame analysis that does generalize, and is useful. It
is intended for experienced players who are looking to add another arrow to
their quiver. I've somewhat whimsically called this a "Master Class," and
I'll be pretending (?) that readers are eager analogues of what the chess
world calls "candidate masters." From time to time, I ask you to stop
reading and consider one or another aspect of the situation I describe,
asking you to solve a certain problem or just answer a little question. I
think it's worth working through the article this way.<P>
<p>
<b>As a prelude....</b>
<p>
Sometimes, occasionally, rarely, you may reach a position from which you
have a forced win. Now, a strict forced win is a position from which you
will certainly win with a particular set of moves, even if everyone else
guesses right every time. Even if the other players could actually see your
moves before they entered theirs, you'd still win. Such positions are rare,
and they are fairly easy to spot when they arise.
I am interested (both in practice and in a theoretical way) in a "virtual
force." This article explains virtual forcing by an example. It's rather
too complicated to explain in this prelude. So, on with the Master Class.
<p>
Here is a position that arose in actual play. In fact, I will give only
half of the position, and
some stipulations about the rest. The stipulations are not thoroughly
realistic -- in the actual
game, the position southwest of Switzerland was somewhat more complicated.
For the
purposes of this "class," I have to strike a balance. I do want to stress
the realism of the
situation; this isn't a pure exercise in logic, but a crucial part of
endgame tactics. On the
other hand, for this lesson I want a position that has what I call a
"virtual force." Generally, in a real game there will be some unforced
elements.  I am trying to isolate the forced elements. In the game from
which this position was taken,  there were some chancy, unforced elements
southwest of Switzerland. Combining forced elements with probabilistic
considerations is for another class (preferably one conducted by someone
else).
<p>
<b>The position:</b>
<p>
AUSTRIA:
A Tyrolia,
A Bohemia,
A Berlin,
A Silesia,
A Prussia,
A Moscow,
A Warsaw,
A Trieste,
A Vienna,
A Budapest,
A Galicia.
<p>
FRANCE:
A Munich,
A Kiel,
A Ruhr,
A Burgundy,
A Piedmont,
A Marseilles,
F Gulf of Lyon,
A Livonia,
F St. Pete(sc),
A Fin,
F Norway,
F Gulf of Bothnia,
F Baltic,
F North Sea,
A Holland,
A Paris.

Further features of the positon:
Italy and Austria are allied in trying to prevent France from winning the game.
France has captured Tunis, and is in position to hold it come what may.
(Since this is a
Master Class, I don't need to explain how this is possible!) There is no
chance of
penetration in either direction in the Mediterranean. The sole channel of
intercourse
between the two sides south of Switzerland, is the Piedmont-Tyrolia connection. We
shall stipulate
that Italy and Austria are unable to drive the French Army Tyrolia out of
there.
<p>
France and Austria have as many units as they need. The relevant part of
the board is full,
with all spaces occupied.
<p>
France now owns 17 supply centers. (Again, all Candidate Masters will be
able to see
which centers those are.) She has only one chance at an 18th center:
Berlin. Only one of
her centers is even marginally at risk, given any moderately realistic
move: Munich.
France's object is to capture Berlin while retaining Munich. The Allies aim
to hold on to
Berlin, or capture Munich, and set up a position from which France can
advance no
further. (This is not a further stipulation. It follows from the position
and the prior
stipulation about the Mediterranean. Once more, all Candidate Masters may
easily verify
this fact.)
<p>
In short, France has to take Berlin without losing Munich, or take Berlin
while losing
Munich but then recapture Munich without losing Berlin, or the like.
Austria/Italy have to
somehow seal up the position in Germany so that Austria permanently holds
Munich or
Berlin (or both!), or possession of Berlin and Munich alternate ad
infinitum. Since Italy's
moves play no role in the forthcoming analysis, I will call the southeast
alliance "Austria"
from now on.

Before reading on, look over the position, and
consider what
plausible sets of orders each side has. Note the French army in Livonia,
and the one in
Piedmont. What are their roles? Consider Austria's defensive possibilities.
Does he have
offensive chances at all? Under what circumstances?
