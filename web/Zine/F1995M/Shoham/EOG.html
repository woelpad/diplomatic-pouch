<H3>Introduction</H3>
First, a personal note. In the months since the last issue I have
changed jobs -- moving from the defense industry to the civilian
economy, and relocated -- from Boston to San Diego. As a consequence,
I did not (and still do not) have much time and net access to devote to
the hobby. I have not played in any judge game and I have no access
to <tt>rec.games.diplomacy</TT>. I do have Email 
(<A HREF="mailto:shoham@hnc.com">shoham@hnc.com</A>), and --
within reason -- respond to questions and provide input when asked.
I hope to return to higher levels of activities when I'm more
established in my new life. In the meantime, I'm making an effort
to keep my committment to this column.
<p>
For the second installment in the Diplomacy Academy series, I've chosen a
game I lost: "<tt>fresh</tt>". The Fresh End-of-Game statement is, perhaps, of some
"historical"; significance. It is the first place where the concept of
<i>The Diplomacy Academy</i> was pronounced -- although not particularly defined.
<p>
At first, it may appear that <tt>fresh</tt> is not a good choice for the Academy:
I didn't play from the start. By the time I joined, the endgame was already
commencing. What's more, most players by then have lost much of the fire in
their game, and were willing to accept a loss. Furthermore, the final outcome
had one such player deliberately hand the game to another player.
<p>
While such playing conditions and outcome can not but be discouraging,
and while it is quite tempting to dismiss a loss under such circumstances
as "unrepresentative," "unavoidable," and "excusable," I do not view
it in this manner. A good Diplomacy player should be able to operate
and win under whatever playing conditions prevail. A good player does
not grumble when a player hands the game over to someone else, but
must ask himself questions like "Why did he do it?", "Could I have predicted
or prevented it?", or better yet "Was there something I could have done
to have him hand the game to <B>me</b> instead?".
<p>
I do not view myself as playing an acceptable game when I play emotionally,
or toward any objective other than maximizing my outcome. I do, however,
find it quite acceptable to subvert other players toward emotional and other
non-maximizing plays, and to take advantage of it when it happens.
This is somewhat akin to what citizens expect of their government at time
of war. As a citizen, I would be quite outraged if I found out that my
national leader has allowed a burst of rage (or any other emotion) to
interefere with military or diplomatic decisions. On the other hand, I would
be quite happy to find that my leadership has manipulated the leader of the
opposing nation into emotionally-driven mistaken decisions.
<p>
While in game <tt>fresh</tt> I did not commit the sin of emotional play, my
inexperience in playing a game dominated by the need to understand
other's motives and emotions kept me from playing by solid rules of
thumb and guidelines which I should have developed early on. This failure
allowed a blindspot to develop into a loss.
<p>
In keeping with the analogy to national governments and what their citizens
expect of them (i.e., no excuses!), I wrote the End-of-Game statement
to <tt>fresh</tt> in the format of a report by a commission of inquiry (which
presumably would be appointed through the pressures of citizens outraged
by their government performance and excuses). The governmental structure
reflected through the report would be typical of a modern state with
checks and balances, separation of powers, civilian rule, etc. The various
departments and sections refered to in the report are a way of representing
various ideas, thoughts, and plans which I had at the specified times (which
may or may not have been put into practice).
<p>
To help keep the context of the game, I've placed the EoG's of the other
players first (in the order they were produced), and my own last. Given
this EoG's format, I did not have an opportunity -- within the EoG -- to
congratulate the winner, thank all players, the GM, and the judge keeper. 
I shall do so now.
<p>
Enjoy.
