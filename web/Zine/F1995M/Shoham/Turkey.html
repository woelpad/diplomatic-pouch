<H2>Turkey's End of Game Statement from Game "Fresh"</H2>

Broadcast message from johnc@gdstech.grumman.com as Turkey in fresh:
Well I came in late in this game as Turkey but I must say it was one
of the 'funnest' games diplomatically. Everyone was such a good sport.
Let me recap a few notable things I remember:
When there was a GE alliance, when I first joined the game, I was
shuffling press from one alliance to another as a sort of double
agent. It turned out not to really have much impact on the game but it
was alot of fun. Boy I had to do some talking when people started to
get the hint of what I was up to, especially Italy. He was the shrewd
one. I don't know if this helped cause the GE breakup. After the GE
breakup I was firmly committed to the GARTI alliance from that point
on.
I thought it was funny when Italy got all bent out of shape, and
rightfully so, for my botched moves in the Med. Sorry that was a
mistake but your reaction was priceless. Also, I loved when Italy was
getting pissed about the alliance's decision to give concessions of his
property to the English. He's a good player, just in a bad spot.
I really liked the original German player. Alot of spunk don't you
think? He was eating up the whole thing with the shuffled messages.
Austria was a riot in the beginning when he's all over the board and
considering sacrificing himself for the alliance. This alliance (ARTI)
was pretty comical, we couldn't seem to get anything right yet we
somehow held it together.
Russia, what can I say, shuffling one unit back and forth for like 5
years. That player should get +500 dedication points.
The new Germany is another fine player but I must admit he confused me
after a few moves so I ended up just trusting him, which was fine.
England and Austria, you ended it at a good time. I think we were all
starting to get a bit tired of it.
Thank you players of fresh for a memorable email Diplomacy match.
