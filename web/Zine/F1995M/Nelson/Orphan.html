<H1>What Effect Does the Orphaning Process Have Upon Games?</H1>
<H3><i>Mark Nelson</H3></i>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
In <a href="Dropout.html">an earlier article</a>, I analyzed completed regular Diplomacy games reported in
<i>Everything</i> #85 (May 1992) through <i>Everything</i> #88 (September 1993).  The
games were divided into games played postally and games played over the
CompuServe network.  In order to compare postal games to CompuServe games,
I used three indicator functions: the percentage number of games
finishing in a win (the WIN number), the average number of dropouts
per game (the DROPOUT number) and the average length of a game (the LENGTH
number).  The dependence of the WIN number upon the DROPOUT number was also
examined.
<p>
By an "orphan" game I mean either a game which moved from one 'zine to another,
usually with a
change in GM, or which had a change in GM while remaining in the same
'zine.  In <a href="Dropout.html">the earlier article</a>, orphaned games were
discarded from my datasets
because "these processes often cause dropouts."  The purpose of the present
article is to compare indicator functions for non-orphaned games to
orphaned games in order to determine what effect, if any, the orphaning process
has on a game.  This article considers only postal games because the number
of orphaned games on CompuServe (6) is too small.
<p>
Glancing through back issues of <i>Everything</i>, orphan games appear to
belong to one of two distinct categories.  Frequently, a couple of players
will drop out in the period in which the game is being orphaned and when
the game restarts the remaining players from the original 'zine will either
agree a draw or a concession.  Alternatively, new players may enter
the game and their enthusiasm ensures that the game continues for many
more years.  When games finish shortly after restarting, it is natural to
ask if this result is the "right" result.  Does orphaning affect the
game result?  Does orphaning affect how long the game will
last?
<p>
To examine these questions we will use a naive approach:
a game is either orphaned or not orphaned.  A more sophisticated
approach would try to measure the "completion index" of a game
at the time of the fold.  By "completion index," I mean a measure
of how near the game has come to finishing. The variation of the indicator
functions with completion index would then be analyzed.  A more sophisticated
approach might also examine the effect of multiple orphaning and,
perhaps most importantly, any effect that the time-delay between a
'zine folding and ita games restarting might have on the indicator functions.
Do "smooth" folds have less effect on games than "poor" folds?
<p>
Games reported in <i>Everything</i> #85 (May 1992) through <i>Everything</i>
#91 (March
1995) are considered.  During this period there were 181 non-orphaned
games reported and 67 orphaned games.  Of the orphaned games, two were games
in which there was only a change in the GM. I have discarded these games from
the survey.
<p>
<H3>Statistical Analysis</H3>
<p>
Of the 247 regular postal games reported in this three-year period, 65
(26.4%) of them were orphaned.  In other words, one in four reported games
were orphaned.  Is this a
historically low, average, or high value?  Is it an acceptable rate?  By
examining back-issues of <i>Everything</i>, I hope to answer the former question
at a later date.
<p>
Table 1 shows what values the indicator functions take on the
two datasets.  I am very surprised to discover that the average
year of finish between non-orphaned and orphaned games
is indistinguishable.  This in itself doesn't mean much. It could be a
fluke, in the sense that orphan games are on the whole either much shorter or
considerable longer than non-orphaned games and the figures average to
the non-orphaned value.

Table 2 shows the percentage of games finish
in a given year or spread of years.   Although the sample size is
small, the
the standard deviation for non-orphan and orphaned games are similar,
and it appears that the orphaning process has <i>no</i> effect on the game-length.

As expected, and as predicted in <a href="Dropout.html">the earlier article</a>,
orphaned games have more dropouts than non-orphaned games.  On average,
there are 1.25 more dropouts in orphaned games than in non-orphaned games.
<P>
The tendency for
more dropouts to occur in orphaned games is also demonstrated in
Table 3, below: nearly 50% of all non-orphaned games have two or fewer,
dropouts, whilst the corresponding figure for orphaned games is only
17%.  Finally, observe that
the WIN number for orphaned games is approximately 125% greater than
the corresponding number for non-orphaned games -- orphaned games are
more likely to finish in a win.

When non-orphaned games are analyzed, there is a (non-linear)
relationship between the number of dropouts and the chance that the
game finishes in a win.  This is most easily seen when the data is
presented as a rolling average.  Is the same phenomenon observed
in orphaned games? Are orphaned games with few dropouts more, or less,
akin to their non-orphaned counterparts than those games with many
dropouts?  Table 4 provides some inconclusive answers.
<p>
<center>

of the Rolling Number of Dropouts</caption>
<tr><th>Dropouts</th><th>Non-Orphaned</th><th>Orphaned</th></tr>
<tr><td align=center>0 to 2</td><td align=center>44.1%</td><td align=center>63.6%</td></tr>
<tr><td align=center>1 to 3</td><td align=center>43.1%</td><td align=center>70.8%</td></tr>

<tr><td align=center>5 to 7</td><td align=center>53.4%</td><td align=center>61.5%</td></tr>
</table></center>
<p>
Regardless of the number of dropouts, orphaned games are more likely
to end in a win than their non-orphaned counterpart. Surprisingly, this
trend is more distinctive for games with fewer dropouts than for games
with more dropouts.  This is a tentative result, since the survey sample
for orphaned games with few dropouts is small.
<p>
We have noticed that orphaning affects the WIN number.  Does it also
affect the type of draw?  To answer this question I have devised the
DRAW SPECTRUM.  The DRAW SPECTRUM is the percentage number of drawn-games
which finish in a n-way draw.  Before examining the data presented in Table 5,
recall that the sample size of drawn orphaned games is very small (22 games).

<H3>Discussion</h3>
In this article, non-orphaned and orphaned postal games reported in
<i>Everything</i> $85 (May 1992) through <i>Everything</i> #91 (March 1995) have been
analyzed, with the following results:
<UL>
<li>One game in four (26.5%) that has been reported has been orphaned.
<li>The orphaning process does not, on average, effect how long a game
takes to play.
<li>Orphaned games have, on average, 1.25 more dropouts than non-orphaned
games.
<li>Only one orphaned game in five (17%) has two, or fewer, dropouts.
<li>Orphaned games are more likely to finish in a win and this
relationship holds regardless of the number of dropouts.
<li>There haven't been enough orphan drawn games to compare the effect
of orphaning on the type of draw.
</ul>
<H3>Notes</H3>
<ol>
<LI>When the change in the name of the zine was considered to be "cosmetic,"
games in that 'zine were not treated as orphans.  A cosmetic change means that
either that the editor changed the name of the 'zine, but nothing else
changed, or that the editor folded the 'zine but continued to
run games by flyer without a noticeable break.
<li>The following name changes were considered to be cosmetic:
<i>The Boob Report/The Abyssinian Prince, Cathy's Ramblings/Rambling
By Moonlight,  Dipadeedoodah!/</i>flyer<i>/Akrasia, Penguin Dip/Black Tie Affairs,
Vertigo/Meet George Jetson</I> and Don Del Grande's various 'zines.
