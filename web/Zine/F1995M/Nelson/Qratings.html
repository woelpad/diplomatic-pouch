<H1>Q Ratings for Zines</H1>

<p>

   In Everything 90 (October 1994) I introduced the concept of 
a Q rating for zines.  The Q rating is an attempt to find the 
zine which runs, or rans in the case of folded zines, the `best' games.
There are many ways in which `best' may be defined.
 Considerations such as
game-fee, cost of zine, frequency and reliability of zine and quality of
GMing are important factors which can be quantified.  Considerations
such as non-game content (letter column, articles, games other than diplomacy
on offer) are personal considerations which can't be quantified.
The Q rating is an attempt to find the `best' zine by calculating a
number.
<p>
   One way to quantify which zines offer `good'
games of diplomacy is to examine their dropout rate.  Zines with
low dropout rates are more likely to contain enthusiastic players.
You may be less likely to win if you
play in these zines (is this true?!) but
you are more likely to enjoy the game (unless, of course, winning is the
sole criteria for judging your enjoyment of the game!).
<p>
   If the average length of a game in two zines differs then comparing
the average number of dropouts would be meaningless because the longer a
game lasts the more dropouts you expect. Hence zines which have longer games,
which would also seem to be a good indication of quality,  might have a higher
dropout rate than zines with shorter games.
Instead of quantifying zines by their average drop-out
we quantity them by their 
average drop-out rate per game-year played (Q).  This is defined as the
ratio of average game-length to average drop-out rate and has non-SI units
of years per drop-out (!).
<p>
   Hence to calculate the Q-ranking the average number of dropouts
and the average game-length are required for each zine in the survey.
There were 181 non-orphaned regular diplomacy games reported in
Everything 85 (May 1992) through Everything 91 (March 1995).  These
181 completed games were played in 45 zines.  For the 
North American Hobby we have
<p>
Q(Postal) = 10.42/2.75 = 3.80 years per drop-out.
<p>
   Table One contains contains statistical information on the 15
zines which ran five, or more, games to completion and their Q
rankings.  These zines account for 126 (69.6%) of the games reported
and can be reasonable considered as the `backbone' of the
postal diplomacy hobby throughout this period.  note that of the
15 zines, 8 have a Q ranking lower than the hobby average.

more, non-orphaned games to completion.  (1) CCC is Carolina Command 
and Commentary.  (2) TCD is The Canadian Diplomat.

<p>
   Although zines which have a reputation as places to play good games
of diplomacy also have high Q-values too much emphasis should not be
placed on the ranking of zines by Q-value;
the sample size is small and the standard deviation in the number of
dropouts and gamelength is large.  A GM
that has a solid core of players that play in a couple of games with a
torpid turnaround could show up very highly in this survey, this would
not necessarily be a place to play.
Let us mearly
note that Boast and Graustark appear to the `best' zines to play in, followed
closely by CCC, Cheesecake and Hoodwink and then Maniac's Paradise.
<p>

  Remember --- The Q ranking is a guide, it does not
provide the definitive answer to finding the zine which runs the `best'
games in the hobby!
