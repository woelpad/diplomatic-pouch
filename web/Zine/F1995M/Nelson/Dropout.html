<H3>Introduction</H3>
<p>
Dropouts are the bane of Diplomacy.  Rare, but not unheard of, in tournament
games, they are more common in social games ("Most of the
face-to-face games I was in before I took up play-by-mail had dropouts!" --Eric
Brosius, 8th
August 1994) and they have been a "feature" of postal Diplomacy
since the earliest days.  Dropouts surely disrupt the flow of a game since the
replacement
player is under no obligation to follow the policies of his or her predecessor, but
do they affect the game <i>result</i>?
Is the dropout rate uniform across the hobby or are there
"quality zines" with "quality players" running "quality games"?
<p>
Before examining the effect of a low (or high) number of dropouts, we need to
identify the base figures.  We use three "indicator functions":
<ul compact>
<li>the percentage of games finishing in a win (the WIN number),
<li>the length of an average game (the LENGTH number), and
<li>the number of dropouts in the average game (the DROPOUT number).
</ul>Our datasets comprise games played in
the North American postal hobby and over the CompuServe network.
CompuServe games are typically run to fortnightly deadlines and one of their
attractions is the speed at which they are run, but are they "better" games?
<p>
In order to answer these questions, datasets containing these games and
the games listed
in <i>Everything</i> #85 (May 1992) through <i>Everything</i> #88 (September 1993) were
set up.
Games which were orphaned or had a change in GM whilst remaining in
the same 'zine were discarded from the datasets
because these processes often cause dropouts.
After this process, the datasets contained 112 postal games
and 28 games played over the CompuServe network.
In the following analysis the postal and CompuServe games are treated
as <i>distinct</i> groups; at no point are they combined.
<p>
The CompuServe sample is small and the analysis of games played on
CompuServe should be treated carefully.  How about the postal size?
At a latter day we intend to examine the
historical variation of the three indicator functions.  Are there more
dropouts today than twenty years ago? Is it easier to win a game today than
ten years ago?  Has the slowing down of the postal hobby -- a decrease in average
'zine frequency -- resulted in a change in the average length of a game?
Bearing in mind that there roughly 120 game starts a year throughout the
1980's we believe that a dataset of 112 games is a reasonable one.
<p>
<H3>What is Meant by "Dropout"?</H3>
For the purpose of this article we are
interested in the number of <i>original players</i> who drop out, not the total
number of dropouts.  If a standby player drops out this fact is not
considered in the following analysis.  The number of <i>original
players</i> is taken as the basis for our definition  because,
although it is preferable to play in 'zines which use standby players, we
view Diplomacy as a game between seven players, rather than a game between
seven nations, and our sense of game quality and enjoyment comes from contact
with the original players; an alternative approach would be to use
the total number of dropouts.
<p>
A feature of American 'zines <i>is</i> this use of standby players.  Yet few
'zines will use a standby player for every position; a small power may (will) be
placed into civil disorder if its leader drops out.  In this study we assume that
the placement of a power into civil disorder, rather than using a standby
player, has negligible effect on the values that the indicator functions
take.  The standby policies of CompuServe GM's vary from GM to GM,
but the standard policy is to call a standby if the vacant
position either has more than two centres or if it is part of a stalemate line.
We assume that the practice of putting one- or two-center positions into CD
has negligible effect on our indicator functions.
<p>
In comparing figures based on North American postal games to games
played over CompuServe we assume that Diplomacy games are
homogeneous and that there were no important differences
in the way that they were run, between CompuServe and the postal hobby.
We make a similar assumption when comparing figures based on games
played in particular 'zines.
<p>
<H3>Survey of Games Reported in <i>Everything</i> #85 through <i>Everything</i> #88</H3>
<p>
Of the 112 postal games, 55 (49%) finished in wins.
Table 1, below, shows the distribution of games with "n" dropouts and how the
percentage of games finishing in a win varies with "n".

The average number of dropouts per
game is 2.86 +/- 1.65.
The first row gives the number of games which finished with
"n" dropouts.  The second row expresses this data as a percentage
of the total sample size (112).  The third row  gives the number of
games with "n" dropouts which finished in a win or draw and the
fifth express the win number as a percentage of the total number of
games with "n" dropouts.

In order to make
the data in this last row more clear, this data is presented as a rolling average in Table 2,

<p>
From the data in Tables 1 and 2, we see that the typical postal
game has 3 dropouts, but the standard deviation is large, and just under
three in every five games played
have three, four or five dropouts.  There is also a
correlation between the number of dropouts and the result of the game.
Games with few dropouts (0-2, 1-3) are less likely to end in a win
than the hobby average, and games with a middling number of dropouts
(2-4, 3-5, 4-6) are
more likely to finish in a win than the hobby average.  Games with
a large turnover in original players (5-7) finish in a win in accordance
with the hobby average.
<p>
Of the 28 games played over CompuServe,
13 (46%) ended in wins.  Since the sample size is small I shall regard
this figure as being the same as the postal figure (51%).  For instance,
if the next three reported CompuServe games in <i>Everything</i> end in wins,
the CompuServe average will be 52% (16/31).
If we view the percentage of games that end in a win
as a crude measure of the standard of play,
assuming that as the standard of play decreases the percentage of games
finishing in
wins increases, then we conclude that the standards of play in the
North American Hobby and over CompuServe are identical.
<p>
Table 3 shows the distribution of games with "n" dropouts and how the
percentage of games finishing in a win varies with "n". This data is
then presented as rolling averages in Table 4.

<p>
From the data in Tables 3 and 4 we see that the
the average number of dropouts per CompuServe game is 2.07 +/- 1.36.
That is, the typical CompuServe game has 2 dropouts and the standard deviation for the number
of dropouts in a CompuServe game is
smaller than that for postal games.  Just over seven in every ten
(71%) CompuServe games
have no, one, or two dropouts.  The sample size is not large enough
to see if there is a correlation between the number of dropouts and
the game result.
<p>
We have already seen that the average game played over CompuServe
is as likely to finish in a win as the average postal game.  Further,
there are far fewer dropouts in CompuServe games, suggesting that
CompuServe games are more stable (and hence more enjoyable?).
<p>
We have examined the effect of the number of dropouts on the result
of the game and calculated the average number of dropouts per game.  There
is one more "fundamental" quantity: the length of the game.  Do
postal games finish "prematurely"?  Postal players might not want to
play to the bitter conclusion because the four or five game-years that are
required for the game to reach its "logical conclusion" may
easily take a year of real time.  Four or five game-years on CompuServe
might only take a couple of months.  Is the average length of a game
dependent on the mode of playing the game?
<p>
Tables 5 and 6 show the distribution of game finishes for postal
and CompuServe games.

<p>
From Tables 5 and 6 we see that there is very little distinction in
average game length between CompuServe and the North American postal
Diplomacy hobby.  The average game-year of finish for a postal game is 1910.00 +/- 3.45,
while the average game-year of finish for a CompuServe game is 1909.75 +/- 3.44.  From this we can
conclude that postal games do not seem to end "prematurely."
<HR>
We now consider postal games in more detail.
Which are the best 'zines to play Diplomacy? The answer to
this questions depends on your definition of "best."  Considerations such as
game-fee, cost of 'zine, frequency and reliability of 'zine and quality of
GM'ing are important factors which can be quantified.  Considerations
such as non-game content (letter column, articles, games other than Diplomacy
on offer) are personal considerations which cannot be quantified.
What if your sole concern is to play in a "good" game of Diplomacy?  This
is something which is not easily quantified, although certain 'zines have
established a reputation as places for serious Diplomacy players to
play.
<p>
It has been noted that standby players interrupt a
game on a strategic and tactical level, and there is something
intrinsically unsatisfying in playing a game which has a rapid
turnover in players.  One way to quantify which 'zines offer "good"
games of Diplomacy is to examine their dropout rate.  'Zines with
low dropout rates are more likely to contain enthusiastic players.
You may be less likely to win if you
play in these zines (is this true?!) but
you are more likely to enjoy the game (unless, of course, winning is the
sole criteria for judging your enjoyment of the game!).
<p>
If the average length of a game in two 'zines differs, then comparing
the average number of dropouts would be meaningless because the longer a
game lasts the more dropouts you expect. Hence 'zines which have longer games,
which would also seem to be a good indication of quality of play, might have a higher
dropout rate than zines with shorter games.
Instead of quantifying 'zines by their average drop-out
rate, a more useful quantity is the
average dropout rate per game-year played (Q).  This is defined as the
ratio of average game-length to average dropout rate, and has non-SI units
of years per drop-out (!).  For the North American Hobby we have

<p>
These figures reflect our earlier finding that CompuServe games
suffer from fewer interruptions than postal games.
<p>
Table 8 contains a breakdown of 'zines in
our sample.  In the survey that follows, we have arbitarily decided that
the minimum number of games required to have run to completion in a
'zine in order to calculate <i>Q</i> for that zine is five.

<p>Games played in the following pairs of 'zines

ran five or more games.
Three of these 'zines have lower values for
<i>Q</i> than the hobby average: <i>Maniac's Paradise, Rebel,</i> and <i>The Home Office</i>.
It should  not be surprising that <i>Rebel</i> has a lower <i>Q</i> value
than the hobby average because <i>Rebel</i> has always attracted
a large number of novices and it is well known that novice players
drop-out at a higher rate than non-novice
players.  Since the dataset for the other 'zines is small, one or two rogue
games exert considerable influence; for example, two of the six games to have been finished
in <i>Maniac's Paradise</i> finished in 1903 and 1905.

<H3>Discussion</H3>
<p>
In this survey we compared "basic Diplomacy indicators," the percentage
of games finishing in a win, the average number of original players who
drop from a game, and the average game-length, for CompuServe
and postal games.  We then examined the dependence of the WIN number
on the DROPOUT number.
<p>
Conrad Minshall has suggested that variations due to dropouts might
be more pronounced in the number of powers eliminated from a game, rather
than the win percentage.  If this true -- and the datasets are not (yet!) setup
to investigate this possibility -- then we might see a difference in the <i>type</i>
of draw agreed to in high-dropout games; are 2-way and 3-way draws more
pronounced in high dropout games than in low dropout games?  We suspect
that 2-way and 3-way draws are more common amongst <i>orphaned</i> games
(as it isn't
uncommon for the players that don't drop after orphaning to agree a draw
amongst themselves),
and that the variation in draw type with dropout number in non-orphaned
games is slight -- having discarded details of orphaned games we now find
that they need to be examined after all!
<p>
We presented the variation of the WIN number as a rolling average of
the number of dropouts.  The resulting data suggests
that if you are an original player then your chances of winning the game
increase as more original players drop.  However it could be the case
that players dropout when they consider a win to be unstoppable, so the nearer
to a win you are the more likely it is that players will drop.  We believe
that the former is the correct interpretation (because we would like to believe
that players don't drop because they think that another player is going
to win the game).
<p>
There is one fundamental factor which may affect all of the
indicator functions: DIAS or
no-DIAS.  Dick Martin has suggested that an analysis based on DIAS and no-DIAS
lines is worthwhile.  This task requires reading the houserules for the 'zines
listed in Table 7.  If someone reading this is in a position to carry
out such a survey, let me know the results! (<i>Graustark</i> and
<i>Retaliation</i> are the only 'zines I know of which run DIAS.)
<p>
Although 'zines which have a reputation as places to play good games
of Diplomacy also have high Q-values, too much emphasis should not be
placed on the ranking of 'zines by Q-value;
the sample size is small and the standard deviation in the number of
dropouts and gamelength is large.  A GameMaster
who has a solid core of players that play in a couple of games with a
torpid turnaround could show up very highly in this survey; this would
not necessarily be a place to play.
<P>
Let us merely
note that <i>Boast</i> and <i>Graustark</i> appear to the "best" 'zines
to play in, followed
by <i>Carolina Command & Commentary</i> and <i>Cheesecake</i>.
<p>
At the core of this survey is the assumption that the number of dropouts
is an important parameter in determining how "good" a game of Diplomacy is.
Perhaps a better parameter would be the number of NMRs in a game; that is,
what is the effect if a player who NMR's every other turn but is not
replaced?  Unfortunately, a survey based on NMR's can not undertaken based
on information presented in <i>Everything</i>.

<LI>Provided that "too many" of the original players don't drop
out, the percentage of games finishing in a win increases with the number of
original players that drop out
<li>The average
strength of players is the same in the postal and CompuServe hobbies
but CompuServe games have a higher Q-value
<li>The 'zines with the highest Q-values are
<i>Boast</i>, <i>Graustark</I>, <i>Carolina Command & Commentary</i> and
<i>Cheesecake</i>.
