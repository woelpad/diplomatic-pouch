<H1 align=center>An Introduction to the South America Variants</H1>
<H3 align=center><i>Erlend 'Joe' Janbu</i></H3>
<HR>
Probably many of you have had the creativity bug sneak up on you, grab
your attention completely, leaving you feeling like making something
new. I've had this feeling many times, and the result of one such experience is what I'm about to talk about. I bet some of the other variant
designers out there wish they had as much spare time as I had during
high school to design variants - I can only admit I was lucky, and now
I feel like sharing my creation with all of you.
<p>
I hear you ask... why South America? This wasn't really what I
initially thought of. Some of you may have seen or played in my World
variant (created back from 1996 to early 1998), and noticed that there are a few
similarities between the South America map in the World variant and the map of the South America variant (version 3.2).
Sure, it is indeed from there that it evolved. I found South America a very
interesting part of the map I'd created. [The World variant was my first Diplomacy
variant and I aimed to create a variety of dilemmas to make the game
interesting - rather than balance it. So, it is unbalanced, there are
numerous stalemate lines, and as the research of the countries' military
was minimal, incorrect powers have been chosen here and there.] I began
tweaking it, and as you can see from the current version number,
I've had quite a revision frequency. [psst, Joe, why South America?]
Oh, well... first of all, it's circumnavigable - an interesting feat.
Next, it's a region not used in many Diplomacy variants. And finally,
I've always liked the Spanish and Portuguese words - future revisions
will probably not have English named territories.
<p>
What did I want to achieve with South America? Well, I've had three
major aims: one, to create a game that was very balanced, not to the
artificial level of Chromatic or Migraine, but in a way that there would not be
a power that nearly noone wanted to draw. Two, to create a variant
where there are no stalemate lines. This is a matter of personal preference - some
like the tactics of stalemate lines (finding a way to cross a stalemate line
and maintain the bridgehead), some don't.  Few variants are stalemate-free. Three, to create powers with a very distinct feel - to appeal to various types of players. Playing Chile in South America is very different from playing Colombia.  The same can be said for other pairs of powers.
<p>
<b>1. The Balance</b>
<p>
So far it looks good. Argentina has most solos and Colombia the most
survivals. I have limited data about SC counts, but what I have tells
me that Brazil has the most centers. However, Chile is the most
wanted power (flexibility, interesting to play) so far - and has,
interestingly, been part of every declared draw so far. Argentina has
less than 50% more solos than the one with least solos (Chile), and
also interestingly has the most eliminations, 20% more than Colombia, the least eliminated nation.
<p>
<b>2. The Stalemate Lines (or Rather, the Lack Thereof)</b>
<p>
I don't know whether there is one, but I and others have searched, and
after 100 games, no game has ended in a stalemate. That's good enough
for me, even if there should turn out to be one. I am aware of the Colombia
gridlocks in Galapagos Sea and when fighting for Caracas - but there
are way more than 12 centers outside this "stalemate" and both cannot
successfully be held at the same time with the centers within, thus this is by definition not a stalemate line.
<p>
<b>3. The Differences Among Powers</b>
<p>
So, what's so different about these powers, then? Let's take them
alphabetically.
<p>
Argentina: the most vulnerable of the powers. Has two coastal centers,
a neutral that is guaranteed (Uruguay) but must rely on negotiations
with Brazil to avoid bounces in Paraguay and Islas Malvinas. Shares a
long land border with Chile - and has a very soft spot in Pampas,
bordering all it's home centers. Only has access to one sea
space (Coast of Argentina).
<p>
Sounds like a difficult country to play? Indeed - what are the good
sides, then?
<p>
Apart from Pampas, Chile can only threaten one home center with each
army (Mar del Plata from Patagonia and Santa Fe from Gran Chaco),
which means that if Argentina keeps Chile out of Pampas, then Chile's attack
will be predictable and most likely futile. If Brazil bounces
Argentina in both Paraguay and Islas Malvinas, he is likely only to
gain Guyana the first year, conceding Caracas to Colombia, bordering
everyone with no decent defense in either direction. This is, most
often, a losing position for Brazil. If Argentina can convince Brazil
of that, he could be looking at 3 builds the first year (but to pick up
three, he needs to play Mar del Plata to Buenos Aires in the first
turn, thus risking Pampas to Chile - unless a bounce is arranged from
Santa Fe or he can snatch a Chilean home center!). A good thing for
Argentina is that there is no border with Colombia. Thus, no fight
will arise between Argentina and Colombia before either Chile or
Brazil is reduced to a relatively small size. In this way, Argentina
is an edge power - but does not have the long distance to supply
centers like Colombia has.
<p>
Brazil: the geographically largest power, both in home centers and, on
average, during the game and at the end. However, it is hard to solo
with Brazil. Brazil has two soft spots, Roraima and Pernambuco, both
bordering three home centers (both Brasilia and Belem, and then Manaus
and Rio de Janeiro respectively), as well as several vulnerable
fronts. Brazil will border all the other nations, has two interior
home centers, and except Guyana, every reachable supply center is
contested. Apart from Guyana and Caracas, Brazil cannot support himself
to a neutral the first year without risking a home center.
<p>
Again, sounds like a difficult country to play? Myself, I find Brazil
the most challenging country to play - especially in no-press games. It is a
really high press country; in press games, you must negotiate a lot or
you will suffer. But, Brazil does have it's good sides too:
<p>
Brazil is the only country to start with four units. That is not merely a minor
advantage. This means it can reach <i>eight</i> supply centers the first
year, in a variant where 13 centers is a solo (congratulations to Knut
Eivind Brennhaug for pulling off the only 8 in the first year, to date).
Brazil can reach seven neutral centers and two home centers first year
(although Arequipa, Antofagasta, Santa Fe, Uruguay and Islas Malvinas
are very unlikely). All other powers must consider Brazil in their opening strategy - if someone is unduly hostile the first year, Brazil can do
some severe damage (but of course, Brazil itself may suffer in the process). Brazil
can within two years guarantee Caracas, and if Colombia realizes this and does not make an attempt to take it, Brazil might get it in the first year (home + Crc + Guy = 6 already, which is the maximum size for any other country after the first year).
<p>
Chile: this long, thin country... it must be vulnerable, right? Well, it
certainly does have it's soft spots. Southeast Pacific borders all the
home centers, plus the three most likely neutrals for Chile - Lima,
Arequipa and Islas Juan Fernandez! In short, don't let someone else into
Southeast Pacific. In addition, there's Patagonia and Gran Chaco, which
both border two of Chile's home centers. However, if Chile wants to have a
hope of three builds, it must either leave Argentina completely alone
and have Argentina return the favour, or he must manage to sneak into an
Argentine home center. The likelihood of that is not good - Argentina
will have them all covered, and you've gained yourself an enemy which has
all his units within three moves of your home centers. In addition, it
is likely to face the Colombian navy in the Pacific, and this ties up
valuable resources.
<p>
Now, then how would you win with Chile? Chile has a very special chance of gaining momentum in the first year. He can
strike Argentina with San-Pam in spring, he can strike Brazil in fall with
Are s Ant-LaP (after San-Ant and Ant-Are in spring), or strike Colombia with
F Con-SEP-GAL the first year, perhaps even accompanied by Ant-Are-Mnt and
San-Ant-Are. There will be SCs to pick up the next year (Jua, Lim) and you
are practically already in Colombia's backyard. These options make Chile a
very interesting country to play - nobody knows where you'll end up.
Fighting Brazil for a long time over La Paz can end up being counterproductive -
you are both bordering Argentina and Colombia, but Argentina and Colombia
don't border each other. If things go wrong, Chile has another
advantage - Islas Juan Fernandez. If two large countries are battling for
dominance, it can be a real pain for them to manage to take out your last
bastion in the sea there - and if they can't, you're part of the draw!
It can be useful for Chile to point out to the weaker of the two powers fighting for dominance that no draw has ever been declared without Chile (though he may also take that as a motivation to try to be the first do do so).
<p>
Colombia: All alone in the northwestern corner of the board lies Colombia.
The board seems vast, the centers so far away you can hardly see them. And
to get to them, well... a fleet in Galapagos Sea will have severe trouble
getting into Southeast Pacific. You'll need to put armies into Montana and
Amazon Basin to make any headway against Chile. Then there's the eastern
front - unless Brazil is occupied in the south, you won't get into Caracas.
And even if you do, there's little chance he's going to let you into Mid
Atlantic, Roraima or Guyana, right?
<p>
Well, the thing is, you might be able to send them the other way. After all,
even if you can't make any headway against them, they can't make much
headway against you either! You start out with two free neutrals (Ecuador and
Maracaibo), and you can gain significant territory if you play for
position - F Baranquilla to Panama in the spring gives you Galapagos Sea  the spring the second year at the latest (if Chile bounces you in the fall of the first year, you can build a fleet in Medellin and force your way in). You don't have to pick up Ecuador the first year, but can move Ecuador on to Montana. If Brazil is friendly and has decided to let you into Caracas, you don't have to pick Maracaibo the first year either, but can steam into Montana and Amazon Basin the first year. And as you are so far away from the action, chances are they will start squabbling with each other rather than with you.  Unprotected backsides never proved hard to invade!
<p>
Intrigued yet? I sure hope so! When time allows, the South America homepage
will include extensive information about openings and perhaps other
statistics.  More articles are on their way. Early next year, I'm planning a no-press team tournament! If you are interested, please check in at the
<a href=http://www.geocities.com/southamerica_dip/>South America homepage</a>
More information will soon be available there.
<p>
Want to get into a game right now? As of the time of this writing, there are games forming on the openings list for both version both 3.2 (a 4-player version) and 5.1 (a 5-player version) - take your pick!
