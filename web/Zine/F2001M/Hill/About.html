<hr>
<P>Hello once again Pouch readers!  It's been a loooong time since the last
issue of the Diplomatic Pouch, but I think you'll find this one well worth the
wait.  We have a wide range of topics this issue, including several new
promising variants.
<P>We have several articles that we are going to turn into a Winter Adjustments
issues as soon as we possibly can, so for those of you who have sent us 
submissions, don't worry if it's not in this edition.  Also, that means a bonus
to all the readers: another issue in the new few weeks!
<P>I would also like to thank co-Guest Editor Tim Miller for helping with much of
the file conversions and proof-reading, while I was trying to avoid illness.
<P>Hope you enjoy,
<p><h2><center><a href="../../F2001M/">On to the articles</a></center></h2>

<b>Enjoy The Pouch,</b>
