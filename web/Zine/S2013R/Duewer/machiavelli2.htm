<blockquote><i>This article is <a href="/Zine/F1999R/Duewer/tyrant.html">a reprint</a> from
 <a href="/Zine/F1999R/">the F1999R issue</a>. It is the second in a series: the first article, 
"</i><u>Machiavelli - State of the Art of the State</u><i>", is currently being updated, and we
 hope to present it in the Fall 2013 Movement issue. However, you don't need to have read the
 first article to be able to enjoy this one!</i></blockquote>
<p>There are eight powers at the start of a game of <b>Machiavelli</b>. Just as in standard
<b>Diplomacy</b>, there
are certain conflicts that appear natural, and occur in many games. In
<b>Machiavelli</b>, however, the pairings are more obvious and less matched. Instead
of everyone worrying about a R/T alliance, they simply worry about Venice --
for as long as there is no organized resistance, Venice can win any war against
his choice of neighbor, sometimes two neighbors. Also unlike standard, it is
possible to lose on the very first turn of the game if you make a critical
error. This article seeks to explain enough of this type of <b>Machiavelli</b> lore so that
a new player can get through the opening phases of the game in one piece,
and without accidentally creating a monster in the process. This is all
knowledge with parallels to concepts and situations in standard <b>Diplomacy</b>,
like knowing that A/I make
good allies &#8212; there are always exceptions, of course, but there is also the
generally accepted base of knowledge.</p>
<P>One way to think of the <b>Machiavelli</b> powers is as a set of four groups of two. Generally,
there is significant conflict the two powers in each group, although when
differences are put aside each pair can act as a strong team. Indeed, it is
the very strength available to that consolidated position that makes absorption
of the other part of each group so tempting, and war so likely. Of
course, there is much more to one's opening than this, but before one learns
to multiply, one learns to add. Before one learns how to conquer Florence
with Turkey, one needs to know how to do it with the Papacy.</p>
<H3>Naples and Turkey</H3>
<p>The first pair we look at is Naples and Turkey. These two powers together control half the
fleets on the board at the start, and generally build more as quickly as
possible. Barring outside intervention, the fight between these two powers
is fairly balanced. Often
it will come down to the relative tactical skills of the powers; sometimes
a famine in a key city will give one power or the other the edge.</p>
<P>Alliance
is made difficult by the division of the Turkish home area to two corners
of the board, making guarding against a stab sometimes troublesome. If
you're playing Turkey, watch out for famine or plague in Tunis &#8212; you can
lose your most lucrative city quickly if you only have one unit in the
west and it gets killed there. Since Turkish units can't go anywhere else
without going by Neopolitan home cities, Naples also worries about a Turkish
stab.</P>
<P>
Still, I've won games on both sides of an N/T alliance, and have have
used an early N/T war to good effect as well. Just don't leave yourself
too open, and be careful not to use your borrowing too early. While both
powers have good long term chances if played carefully, getting too
badly hurt in the early war can leave you vulnerable to players from other
areas like Venice, France, or the Papacy. In fact, France can be invited
in as kingmaker and take the kingdom if the battle is ugly enough and he
has time to bring up enough force.<P>
<H3>Milan and France</H3>
<p>The second pair is Milan and France. These powers may appear not to be as likely
to fight each other early on &#8212; if you're playing France you definitely want to convince
Milan that this is so! There is a rich clump of neutral supply centers between France
and Milan, including the pseudo-nation of Genoa, which has a variable income
attached to it. France starts weak but can grow explosively from his corner
position using this clump of centers. Often one can secure Savoy/Turin, take Saluzzo
at leisure, let someone (often Milan) do the work of laying seige to Genoa, then
drive in when the time is right.</p>
<P>
From Milan's point of view, the key here
is to convince France that the sea is the way to go. A joint assault on
Austria may appear tempting, but it just increases your long term vulnerability
unless you have such a combination of luck and skill as to get the entire
Austrian home area for yourself &#8212; and even then you may be in trouble. If France gets
the whole clump of neutral centers while you're taking Austria, France may still outclass you,
especially with Venice as a neighbor with a wide border. So get France
to go to sea, and make sure that Montferrat is yours and that you cover your french
border adequately. France can do well at sea, and needs to maintain a sea
presence as a screen if nothing else, so this is not an unreasonable thing
to ask of him.</P>
<H3>Venice and Austria</H3>
<p>This looks like a massive mismatch in strength. It is. Austria as David
can sometimes hit Goliath, but really, Austria needs to enlist help from
the outside. Milan is a natural ally for Austria, and may be willing to
send help out of self-interest. After all, Milan's worst nightmare is to
have a large border with a Venice who has absorbed Austria. Turkey is another
possibility &#8212; that army in Albania can cause Venice fits, and if Turkey
isn't in a deathmatch with Naples he can profit nicely from damaging Venice.
He certainly doesn't want Austria to get swallowed.</p>
<P>
The Papacy can be a big
help as well in tying up Venetian forces, but is slower to cause real damage
to Venice in most cases. His fleet in Ancona can limit Venetian logistical
options at the beginning by bouncing in UAS a while, and he'll usually
do this for his own defensive reasons. No one wants Venice too close to
them. But the Pope has a lot of trouble taking more than Ferrara from Venice
(who usually secures Ferrara at the start).</P>
<P>
Venice, of course, wants to be
on good relations with as many neighbors as possible, while eating the
others. If the other players allow it, Austria makes an excellent target,
providing Venice with a corner from which to work, with an excellent position for an
assault on
Milan if he chooses, with security for some neutrals, and with an excuse to
build up forces. Venice can't be killed ever if he is careful, since his
capital only borders one sea zone, and a garrison there cannot be defeated
by conventional means, while requiring twice as much as a normal unit
to disband. Of course, sometimes Venice will choose to be less than careful for
a little while for the purposes of saving money, but if he has time he can always withdraw
to the isle and live there comfortably off his variable rolls. If Venice
has an elite professional garrison at home, he isn't going to be destroyed
until the game is basically over anyway.</P>
<P>
Of course, it is possible V/A will
make peace, and in this case, Austria should insist on at least two of the neutrals
available (Trent, Croatia, Carniola). Sure, Milan has some claim to Trent,
but compared to his other concerns it's usually in his best interest to
back Austria's claim. Even if at peace with Venice, I don't think Austria
should attack Milan &#8212; in this case the general wisdom from standard <b>Diplomacy</b> about
A/I wars applies. In fact, there's not much for Austria to do in this
case except keep an eye open for a good chance to invade France or send
a risky expedition down to Turkey. The latter is likely to do more harm
than good most of the time, unless an N/T alliance is in evidence.</P>
<H2>The Pope and Florence</H2>
<p>Now for the most bloody of pairs: P/L. You need to know the first turn takeout
moves for killing Florence, just as every good <b>Diplomacy</b> player should know
the Lepanto. If you're playing one of P/L, you need to know it much better
than that. Here it is, minus the loans (since this will depend on starting
cash):
<ul><tt>
<li>e1 : 18d [or more] Buy Army Florence</li>
<li>e2 : 12d [or more] Disband Army Arezzo</li>
<li>Perugia - Arezzo</li>
<li>Florence - Pisa</li>
<li>Bologna - Pistoia</li>
</tt></ul>
<p>This can not only kill Florence if he moves out of Pisa, but gives
the Pope control of the home area since it takes Pistoia as well. Sure,
the Pope sacrifices a lot of leverage over Ferrara/Mantua, but who cares?
He instantly jumps ahead of even Venice in income.</p>
<P>
Can you say "Early Leader
Syndrome"? Well, yes, this could be a problem, but only if the board remains in a position to respond.
If the Pope lays the proper diplomatic groundwork, he can hold off the
reaction long enough to pay that debt. Of course, if Florence knows what
is up, he can take precautions. Such as the oft-ignored Pisa Hold order.
Or the more expensive large counterbribe to Florence or Arezzo. Florence
has the advantage of a compact and wealthy nation &#8212; if the Pope tries the
knockout and fails, the Pope is in deep trouble. Florence can use some money
to regain some lost territory and remove the Pope's means to pay the crushing
debt.</P>
<P>Because of this, trying for the knockout is a dangerous move if Florence
suspects anything. And a good Florence <i>always</i> suspects something. So the
Pope and Florence will usually talk to each other friendly for a while,
take precautions, and then one will jump on the other if they perceive
a weakness.</P>
<P>Sometimes they actually manage to work together. Usually this
involves the Pope helping check Venetian growth and trying to get the neutral
block to the north, while Florence works to rule the seas. If they resist
the temptation to fight long enough, the strategic importance of the
units that the other is deploying actually decreases the chance of a stab. Since
P/L are in the middle, such units sometimes hold the balance of power; and
since a P/L alliance generally tends to provide a balance of power, this
means that the pair can reach a point where even the ability to quickly swallow
the other is unimportant since such an attack would help someone else more than
it would help the person doing the swallowing.</P>
<H3>Outside Your Area</H3>
<p>So what should you do outside your own area? Well, everyone but Venice
and perhaps France would prefer that Venice is contained. You might
want to spend a little time diplomatically trying to encourage this. Remember:
Venice can't be hurt too much at the start of the game. You want to make
some friends everywhere, so do a lot of talking. Look for the powers who
can most help you with your own situation. For example, France and Florence
can swing the balance in a tough N/T war. Florence and the Pope can both
be players in the Genoa game if they make it a priority in their opening.
Generally, it is in your interest to develop slowly except
where you are making gains, so keep that in mind. Don't neglect to consider
the possibility that one or more pairs may put aside their problems &#8212; make
the proper contingency plans to so that you can form a large alliance against
a group that comes after you, and be willing to join a group to help
a friend. Pay attention to how things develop at sea, and don't use
up your money too quickly.</p>
<H3>Money!</H3>
<p>In my next installment, I'll talk about the bank, basic financial strategy,
and how to avoid premature assassination. I'll also talk about how
to bend the odds in your favor if you know you will default.</p>
