I was recording for the full negotiation time each season, so probably one per? I think 16 minutes is on the long side for this, but even so I cut out some really juicy stuff!

Chris Martin: I think if you are enjoying it, others will pick up on that and enjoy it as well. One of the things that encouraged me to start online play was reading the <a href="http://diplom.org/Showcase/ghodstoo/">showcase game "ghodstoo"</a> on the Diplomatic Pouch . I didn't understand half of what I was reading at the time but I knew I liked it and it encouraged me to dig deeper into the hobby. I suspect this could have that same impact for face-to-face games.

They really are great and there's not much else you can do about the background noise (which is the only difficult part). As Mr. Cooley notes, you are only one person, so you got what you got. I like the basic style of your commentary and BECAUSE the background noise is so bad, you might do better to tell us more of what they just said that we are having trouble hearing.

The only thing that stops them from being even better, well, two things: 1) Money; 2) Time. <br>
I was talking to someone today about mobile microphones. Less than $400 for one that is "okay." So, putting one on each player . . . $2700? Then you need a sound board, digital recorders, and, oh yeah, more cameras and camera people. So, until ESPN sees the light . . . <br>
And, if it's tough editing now, imagine what it would be like with MORE video/audio. <br>
Anyway, with the limits you are working under, these are remarkable.

Thank you very much for the captioning. <br>
However, I do think the captioning of the players names/countries is unnecessary. If someone has gotten this far into the game and can't sort that out, well . . . they need to work harder. ;) <br>
Very nice analysis. If there was a pro league, you could do this for a living (but, I think you know that).

Oh, please don't misunderstand me. I think it's fine. However, if it adds to the workload substantially, I'm saying that by the end of '02 anyone who is working through the videos ought to be able to keep it straight by that time. Plus, Chris' commentary shows the players positions, so I am just offering the opinion that (after an hour of video between the four turns) it doesn't add that much. <br>
On the other hand, the closed-captioning is invaluable.

Okay, crazy idea time (then again, it IS me!) <br>
So, with all the tech that you can (masterfully) pull off, what about letting the players review the moves of every turn, watch the vids, then give you "what I was thinking" videos that you could also edit in? These would be recorded before you released the videos. <br>
Am I making sense? Inow, yes, great to have Yeargin's insights, but how much better to splice them in during your analysis of the turn? <br>
Clearly, that would not work for this year. And, again, I think you should get some kind of award for this series. It is spectacular. I will be posting them--are they all at a singular youtube address?
</p><p class="comment">

I don't expect there to be many K-POP drama fans out there but I was just thinking that their system for handling prepping domestic series for foreign markets might work. In brief: each project has a team captain who puts together (from a list of volunteers) a team of timers, translators, caption writers, etc. who work together on a project from beginning to end. That way no one person has to try to do it all and the risk of burn out drops. Just an idea.

Correction, the Diplomatic Pouch would like to do so. Diplomacy World isn't into multimedia projects AFAIK (preferring a printable magazine), whereas we've been including videos in almost every issue for the past year.

Does anybody have an idea of how long it will take to watch all of these so far? I'm thinking seriously about having a marathon session to watch them all at once. If I can do it with 54, 45 min Korean historical dramas I can sure do it for something important like this? Chris, any predictions on how long the whole series will run?

I guarantee the series will not run past 1909. <br>
I'm going to try to put together a master edit, that could be shown at a film festival, maybe, once they are all in the bag.

All the ones released so far amount to about 4h20
</p><p class="comment">

Each is around 30 min, so a bit less than 6 hours.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Early ones a bit shorter, and I really really try to keep them under 20 minutes.
</p><p class="comment">

They're too short - take a look at what the NFL is doing with instant replay and ads, we could easily stretch each season to an hour!
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
My initial thought was that no one would watch them if they were longer than 15 minutes. You know I don't have a problem with talking more.  :D I could definitely see Siobhan and I doing a Video Podcast where we broke things down in greater detail.

Depends on whether the subject is cut off as [interesting discussions] or the full [[interesting discussions between Doug and I]. I'd probably argue it's a compound subject... but I'd probably argue more strongly that it doesn't matter. ;)
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
It's Yoda-speak anyway. "Missed are interesting discussions" vs "interesting discussions are missed". Anyway, relevant XKCD: <a href="http://xkcd.com/1735/">Fashion Police and Grammar Police</a>.

<b>Chris Barfield</b>
Well played, I'll go back to to trolling my less competent friends.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
Chris Barfield: Trolling competent friends are the most fun, you don't get witty comebacks otherwise. Similarly, the only reason it's fun (for me anyway) to comment on Andrew and Peter's play like I did this turn is because I respect them and am interested in their response. Wouldn't bother to take the time or think about the board if they were bad at the game.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Shucks. FWIW I think you're offering some fine thoughts, Jared. And Chris... I'd stop and listen to what you're saying any day - it's been way too long!
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
Andrew Goff: I felt obligated to make that clear because otherwise it's just a nonstop flurry of criticism from a guy who's never been on a top board
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jay Heumann</b>
One small point--Ruh supported Tyr-Mun, not Mun-Kie. (You said it wrong but looks like you got it right in the interface.) Either that, or all 7 players missed that there should be a French army in Kie but not Mun.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Yeah, that was my bad on the narration - caught it later but too much trouble to go back and fix. We'll get it in Post!
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jay Heumann</b>
Haha, I hope "we'll get it in post" is a reference to what I think it is...
