Very cool! Are you planning one video per season or will it eventually get down to one per year?

<span class="master">Chris Martin</span>: I think if you are enjoying it, others will pick up on that and enjoy it as well. One of the things that encouraged me to start online play was reading the showcase game "<a href="http://diplomatic-pouch.org/Showcase/ghodstoo/">ghodstoo</a>" on the Diplomatic Pouch. I didn't understand half of what I was reading at the time but I knew I liked it and it encouraged me to dig deeper into the hobby. I suspect this could have that same impact for face-to-face games.

Ok. Maybe a "consider as you watch..." approach :) <br>
As you watch my negotiations, consider what I was trying to achieve in the west. It's almost the opposite of <span class="austria">Yeargin</span>! And yet we rapidly agreed on our collective orders and first target. I think this gives some great insight into the difference between strategy and tactics.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="germany">Douglas Moore</b> 
Likewise to what <span class="russia">Andrew</span> said (no spoilers)... I spent my time in '01 working to set the stage. I'm playing Germany, which I love, but both <span class="england">Adam</span> and <span class="france">Nathan</span> will be leery (to be fair, we're all leery of each other). So, I want to talk to <span class="russia">Andrew</span>, because as former World Champs, we are targets. If we can work together, and we can be on the same page, that's critical for my position -- more so than anything that happens with EF. Otherwise: I like working with <span class="france">Nathan</span>, will France go north, or is he conservative? What does <span class="england">Adam</span> want to do with England? How fast? Can I get <span class="italy">Chris</span> to go west?

All I can say is: MORE! <br>
Would it even be better if you could have recorded every conversation and chosen which were key/critical? Sure, but given that you were one dude doing all that one dude could do (channeling Robert Downey Jr. from that movie about Vietnam I never saw), it's fantastic. I'm basing this on Spring 1901 only. Haven't watched this one yet. However, I'm confident I'll feel the same. You are a master, analyzing and drawing out other expert players.

Very nice! Especially like the way (if memory serves) every clip featured one of the players from the previous clip.

This is good stuff -- it's the first time I've ever seen someone try to cover a game of Diplomacy this way. I tried watching with closed captions (automatically generated by Google) on, but it's a mess. Legit captions for the negotiations would be sooooo helpful.

<b>James Burgess</b>
They really are great and there's not much else you can do about the background noise (which is the only difficult part). As Mr. Cooley notes, you are only one person, so you got what you got. I like the basic style of your commentary and BECAUSE the background noise is so bad, you might do better to tell us more of what they just said that we are having trouble hearing.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Ok, I have heard a lot about closed captioning - its a lot of work but maybe I can try something for the next one.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Doug Massey</b>
I might-could help with that (might-could = my new NC accent!). I could first-draft something for you if you have a way to add in the captions?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
It would involve a re-edit, but a pretty simple one. If you want to take a crack at it, please be my guest!

If you have an advance copy of S1902 you want to send me, just email me a link.
</p><p class="comment">

Unfortunately, I just have raw footage. But if you want to take a run at S or F 01, I could re-edit them to incorporate CC.

<b>Peter J McNamara</b>
These are great videos. Really well done and love the commentary. Your commentary is what makes it great.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
The only thing that stops them from being even better, well, two things: 1) Money; 2) Time. <br>
I was talking to someone today about mobile microphones. Less than $400 for one that is "okay." So, putting one on each player ... $2700? Then you need a sound board, digital recorders, and, oh yeah, more cameras and camera people. So, until ESPN sees the light ... <br>
And, if it's tough editing now, imagine what it would be like with MORE video/audio. <br>
Anyway, with the limits you are working under, these are remarkable.

Awesome videos. I just rewatched Spring 1902, and what I would like to hear from players (if possible) is why didn't Eng-Ger get together after Sp02. <span class="france">Nathan</span> screwed <span class="england">Adam</span>, and <span class="russia">Goff</span> screwed <span class="germany">Doug</span>. Was <span class="england">Adam</span> still so scared of <span class="germany">Doug</span> that that didn't happen? Seems like the moves are there.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
You get a little more insight into this in the Fall 1902 I think - but my sense is that they never got on the same page. To <span class="france">Nathan</span>'s advantage, of course. <span class="germany">Douglas</span>, we talked about that earlier, didn't we?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="germany">Douglas Moore</b>
<span class="master">Chris Martin</span>: Yes, indeed. <span class="england">Adam</span> isn't on facebook, so he can't reply. But, if you go back, you'll see that when those opportunities were there, we couldn't/wouldn't make it happen. Believe me, I made the case more than once.

I think it is fun and instructive to analyze a game, see some of the other diplomacy, and not be in a "post-game" mode, in which we are all tired, emotional, and sometimes defensive.

Minor suggestion, if you are able to put graphics on top the videos. Put a country flag on the left and right of the screens, for each player in the negotiation. Ideally also include a list of each player's current units and their locations.

Not gonna be a critic (since they all played better than I did), but <span class="england">Adam</span> might have been well-served to build F Edi rather than F Lon. That would have ended the whole Channel discussion. Sure, <span class="france">Nathan</span> could have gone to the Channel anyway, but <span class="england">Adam</span> could have at least made a compelling anti-German case instead of the (rather weak) offer to put a fleet in Bel. <br>
Excellent insights for beginners, intermediate, and even advanced players, <span class="master">Chris</span>! The discussion of tempo is often overlooked. You highlighted it after the turn--<span class="austria">Yeargin</span> and <span class="england">Silverman</span> accomplished nothing in a very pivotal turn. Well, they did pick up additional threats, but that's not in category "good."
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
I think <span class="england">Adam</span> suffered from being rushed at the end in this particular turn; He might have been better off just saying "OK" when <span class="france">Nathan</span> suggested putting the army into Berlin. Even if he loses the tempo from F London for a season, that would have cemented the alliance. <span class="france">Nathan</span> could have moved his fleets to MAO/Spa(sc), and things proceed differently. But I don't think <span class="france">Nathan</span> was ever really sold on English Army Belgium.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
Since I can critique you (gently): the one part of the negotiations I found really lacking between EF was that this was a spring move. You did say that they both were afraid to commit. I agree. I'd take it a step further: they both were afraid to offer ideas. <span class="germany">Doug</span> is a great player and it's going to take more than a lame Spring agreement on Belgium to take him down. So, why not start with "Do you think I could get into Helgoland?" If <span class="england">Adam</span> even feigns a willingness to commit, he might well get something going. <br>
The rushing at the end is all true. Memo to all players: write a set of orders early. You can change them. But, "drop dead" is what is sounds like: unforgiving, as in you don't get orders in on time, you can "drop dead." <br>
Eh, I guess I did critique <span class="england">Adam</span>. Then again, he's not on the Facebooks. :)
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="germany">Douglas Moore</b>
The analysis on the SKA bounce is spot on. It was a critical move, and had repercussions throughout the rest of the game -- no spoilers, but I'll comment again on it after later posts. <span class="russia">Andrew</span>'s (Russia) bounce there was a straight stab (a good one, too), since we'd discussed this move separately. Switching gears, <span class="master">Chris</span> couldn't be everywhere at once and see every negotiation, but in reality, I never got anything pro-active or positive from <span class="england">Adam</span> (England) in any Dip phase. I wasn't convinced he didn't want to work with me or that he wanted to attack me because of <span class="austria">Peter</span>, but rather his diplomacy and approach from the start. In S1901, for example, he talked to every other player before he spent a token amount of time talking to me (in all of '01, I think we spent less than a minute talking). Through this point, as a consequence of <span class="england">Adam</span>'s approach and the signals he gave (as I interpreted them), I've done virtually everything I could have done to get <span class="france">Nathan</span> (France) on board with FG.

<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
It's good to see these, <span class="master">Chris</span>. It's nice know that even this early in the game <span class="austria">Peter</span> and <span class="germany">Douglas</span> have already commented on the "show" I may or may not be putting on for the board. Not every artist gets this kind of feedback. It's also really funny to see that I got to repay <span class="turkey">Maletsky</span>'s "Rando Barnes" comment by calling him wild card that might randomly throw dots to <span class="italy">Chris</span>. <i>Touch&eacute;</i>.

With <span class="england">Adam</span>'s effective NMR, it's very hard to read <span class="france">Nathan</span>'s move here (unless you're party to his negotiations) - those moves could easily have been with <span class="england">Adam</span>'s agreement (e.g. with a move to Hel and Lon-Nth)

Thank you very much for the captioning. However, I do think the captioning of the players names/countries is unnecessary. If someone has gotten this far into the game and can't sort that out, well . . . they need to work harder. ;) <br>
Very nice analysis. If there was a pro league, you could do this for a living (but, I think you know that).

Keep the names and countries for people who have been out of the hobby for ten years!

Oh, please don't misunderstand me. I think it's fine. However, if it adds to the workload substantially, I'm saying that by the end of '02 anyone who is working through the videos ought to be able to keep it straight by that time. Plus, <span class="master">Chris</span>' commentary shows the players positions, so I am just offering the opinion that (after an hour of video between the four turns) it doesn't add that much. <br>
On the other hand, the closed-captioning is invaluable.

Okay, crazy idea time (then again, it IS me!) <br>
So, with all the tech that you can (masterfully) pull off, what about letting the players review the moves of every turn, watch the vids, then give you "what I was thinking" videos that you could also edit in? These would be recorded before you released the videos. <br>
Am I making sense? I know, yes, great to have <span class="austria">Yeargin</span>'s insights, but how much better to splice them in during your analysis of the turn? <br>
Clearly, that would not work for this year. And, again, I think you should get some kind of award for this series. It is spectacular. I will be posting them--are they all at a singular youtube address?

Yep, you can get the playlist <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLbwng27eI0e3O9rIFcXp_Bvr97TNgAsQw">here</a> - and that link will work for all the videos I add in the series.

I don't expect there to be many K-POP drama fans out there but I was just thinking that their system for handling prepping domestic series for foreign markets might work. In brief: each project has a team captain who puts together (from a list of volunteers) a team of timers, translators, caption writers, etc. who work together on a project from beginning to end. That way no one person has to try to do it all and the risk of burn out drops. Just an idea.

That turn makes me sad. Everyone else's moves were great for me, but I screwed it up. I remember very clearly thinking to myself "well, you blew it. No championship for you". Particularly frustrating because the order for Venice should have been set at least 10 minutes earlier.

</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jay Heumann</b>
<span class="italy">Chris</span>, this game is such a throwback to some of our house games in Vancouver, where someone (usually John but I think you and I were guilty of this at times) would make moves that looked bad at the time but then it turned out they'd never come back to haunt the player. Watching the video, having not watched Spring 1903 yet, I can tell this will be the case here. Even though you lost "tempo" by that unordered support, not only are you OK going forward because of the other Eastern orders, but you also accidentally kept Germany out of Tyrolia, which has got to be good for you.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
Keeping <span class="germany">Doug</span> out of Tyrolia was certainly not a bad thing, it's true. The main thing that kept my chances alive, though, is probably that <span class="austria">Peter</span> and <span class="turkey">Dave</span> didn't manage to work together
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jay Heumann</b>
Agree, that's more important. But still, I looked at your orders not thinking "Wow, that was a bad misorder, he's going to collapse now" but instead "That's probably the least amount of damage possible from a misorder like that".
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Actually <span class="italy">Chris</span>, I think this was the turn that cost *me* the championship. Despite your protestations, I still rate it a 50/50 that your disorder was intentional! <br>
I was trying to set up a horse race between me, you, and <span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span> - and I would've got away with it too if it hadn't been for those meddling kids! Everything changes for me as a result of this turn. But... no spoilers :)
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
I don't see much point in continuing any deception past the end of a game myself :-) I can't say that I remember for certain what I was thinking when I wrote my orders but I can say for sure that I was very disappointed with myself when they were read, so I'm 99% certain that it was not deliberate. I suspect that I messed things up as a result of last-minute discussions with <span class="turkey">Dave</span> - I have been known to make mistakes when changing my orders in the last few seconds before a deadline.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Seriously, can <span class="austria">Peter Yeargin</span> chime in here on what the heck he was thinking this turn? What is the reasoning behind promising <span class="turkey">Dave</span> those supports, and then not giving them? In your mind, is there a secret tunnel from Tyrolia to Galicia? We want answers!
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Really? I think it was genius.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
I can't tell if you're serious. If so, it would only be genius if it gained something, right? It gained no dots and alienated (to some degree) all three neighbors. <br>
I chuckled when I read your comment because I took it as sarcasm. I am guessing that <span class="austria">Peter</span> thought he *had* to do as he did and lied last second never thinking that <span class="turkey">Maletsky</span> would go for it. I think he was maybe hoping to get an RT war going and build to stave off Italy. However, you (R) would believe <span class="turkey">Maletsky</span> about the deception and would likely use <span class="turkey">Maletsky</span>'s trademark revenge mode to your benefit.

So... I will decline much comment here, waiting for the next one. Other than to say, sometimes when it is 2v1, the right move is to make it 3v1. <span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span> was in the driver's seat in the west.

Yes, I know. It's why I knew I was in deep trouble in S02, and again when you put the army down. As I said in the F02 commentary though, joining and creating a 3v1 was a strong move for you. It becomes particularly strong given that it isn't you who initiated my struggles.

</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jay Heumann</b>
The way I read the move was: you had just cut deals with Austria and England to target Turkey and Germany, but your agreement with Austria meant that your armies in Gal and Mos would not be moving south (because Rum wasn't moving). So the most obvious strategy in light of your negotiations was to use them in the north--and set yourself up to place those two armies in Sil and Pru in the fall, assuming all your negotiations worked out in the spring. So if I have that part right, then in my opinion Mos-Lvn is better than Mos-War, because you don't need to be next to Sil with both armies and this way you are next to StP in case something goes wrong with your England deal.

Yes. Correct statement. I wouldn't have taken a chance like that on purpose... Especially on a top board. <br>

I wish I could remember the specifics of that game better.

Hi <span class="russia">Andrew</span>, any comment on why you and <span class="italy">Chris</span> didn't just scoop three from <span class="austria">Peter</span> this turn? Tyr S Tri - Vie, Ven - Tri, Gal - Bud, Con S Rum - Bul, Ion - Gre? It's so clear that <span class="austria">Peter</span> believed you both. Is it because you were afraid of France getting too big? <br>
I especially ask this because the chance of losing Sweden was pretty obviously high and picking up another dot or two would have been really helpful. Bud / Bul would allow you to build in Stp despite losing Sweden. Was <span class="italy">Chris</span> not willing? Or you? Or both?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Some of it is stylistic: I don't like stabbing and that tends to make me more reactive than I should be. But there is a bigger picture here too: if <span class="italy">Chris</span> and I stab <span class="austria">Peter</span>, then I don't see how we finish with anything other than EF (with a co-operative German) v IR (with an angry Turk and Austrian). From that position, The West will finish with 20 centres to our 14, so the World Champion is not coming from the IR side of the board. <br>
(That was my thinking, right or wrong)
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span>: That is a great point, though I'm not sure I follow the 20 vs 14 count. <span class="italy">Chris</span> will be able to hold Tunis easily, and you might lose StP but you're keeping War / Mos. 17/17, no? That said, the video doesn't make clear whether you knew <span class="england">Adam</span> was going to take Sweden. Your logic makes a lot more sense if you expect to keep Sweden, but given that you finish the year down 1 as played I sort of think you need the centers; two from Austria allows a build in StP even losing Sweden. Your logic makes a lot of sense but it might be the best of a bad situation given that you got bounced out of Pru and Sil in the spring - as soon as that happens you're in a lot of trouble in the north regardless. <br>
My thinking anyway. I've never been on the top board of a WDC before, hope my rambling makes sense :)
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
No, I see what you mean Jared, but I think the Nuance that you are missing is this - it isn't really IR vs FE - its IR vs FEGAT - and I think <span class="russia">Andrew</span> is arguing that if he took the time to start in on <span class="austria">Peter</span>, he'd be stuck there defending those dots against the remains of A/T, while G was pushing hard on Warsaw, and England takes Swe/StP any time they want. France could swing three fleets into the Med in S05, to the Italian two - which means that unless help gets there soon, Tunis falls. Yes?
</p><p class="comment">
<b>John Jamieson</b>
To what extent did <span class="austria">Peter</span> know of <span class="russia">Andrew</span>'s thinking?
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="master">Chris Martin</span>: You can't put three on Tunis without Tys. The moves I describe has Venice bouncing in Trieste which means that Russia would have A Bud A Gal A Rum F Sev, Italy would have A Tyr A Vie A Ven F Nap (Vienna) F Ion; Austria would have "pick two" of A Gal A Ser F Gre (Bul is destroyed, Vie can only retreat to Gal, and I assume he'd lift Boh when his only centers are Ser and Gre), Turkey would have F Aeg / F Ank which can't even work together to retake Con without allowing a Con - Smy retreat (and even that lets <span class="russia">Andrew</span> into Bla). Anyway all this means is that the only thing <span class="austria">Peter</span> would have adjacent to Tri is Ser, which means Ven (or even Tyr) can probably move to Pie making Mar - GoL a lot riskier. <br>
Also your logic assumes that <span class="england">Adam</span> would not stab <span class="france">Nathan</span>, which is a pretty huge assumption, especially if it looks like <span class="austria">Peter</span> and <span class="turkey">Dave</span> are doing a good job being a nuisance and are hard to fully eliminate. <span class="england">Adam</span> has no interest in letting France get deep into the Med, especially if France is fully committed to Naf / Wes / GoL. If I know <span class="germany">Doug Moore</span>, he's suiciding to <span class="france">Nathan</span> RIGHT NOW but if <span class="france">Nathan</span> takes his foot off <span class="germany">Doug</span>'s neck, he's going to "stab" (is it really a stab if it's a home center?) back into relevance as soon as he can. <span class="germany">Doug</span> isn't any more eliminated than <span class="austria">Peter</span> would have been or <span class="turkey">Maletsky</span> is.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Jared - No, I'm just trying to clear up your question about the decision making process <span class="russia">Andrew</span> describes. We could get into a sandbox over on Backstabbr and play out some scenarios if you want, (you take I/R, I'll take everyone else - might be interesting) - but the real issue is that under the time constraints, you have to make a snap call - and you see that <span class="austria">Peter</span> worked HARD to get <span class="russia">Andrew</span> on board, and even to get <span class="italy">Chris</span> back on board after he took Trieste. That kind of psychological momentum is difficult to just overturn. <span class="italy">Chris</span> is (as I read it) counting on getting <span class="turkey">Dave Maletsky</span>'s help to profit more from the coming attack on <span class="austria">Peter</span> than <span class="russia">Andrew</span> would - why divide a pie equally now, when you can get more of it later? Then I have the advantage of editing the S05 press right now so I know some stuff that isn't out there yet. It's a great question though! I think <span class="russia">Andrew</span> expected that <span class="england">Adam</span> would stick with him for another year, since <span class="france">Nathan</span> had positioned aggressively and <span class="russia">Goff</span> was the one who put him in Denmark. In fact, I BET that if <span class="england">Silverman</span> had come to <span class="russia">Goff</span> and said "Look, I need to build another fleet to get tucked into <span class="france">Nathan</span>, so I'm going to take Sweden - can you pick up a dot somewhere else?" Things might have gone very differently here indeed ...
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
What exactly were the timing rules? I know <span class="italy">Chris</span> had the misorder turn, IIRC <span class="england">Adam</span> had one too so far? I know it's drop dead but I don't know the length of the clock. I agree if the clock is too short it's a lot easier to just go with the previous plan rather than considering a stab. <br>
I really wish there had been some negotiation from <span class="england">Adam</span> in this video, I don't think he's in the best position on the board but it's certainly a very interesting one. I think stabbing <span class="france">Nathan</span>, finishing off <span class="germany">Doug</span> and stabbing <span class="russia">Goff</span> are all reasonable plays, and he certainly had the freedom to make his own decision: <span class="france">Nathan</span> didn't have an effective stab and <span class="germany">Doug</span> was really mad at <span class="russia">Andrew</span>. Looking forward to some of England's perspective in 1905. <br>
Re: sandbox on Backstabbr: I think it would be hard to do it justice, because <span class="germany">Doug</span> and <span class="turkey">Dave</span> are too unpredictable in this situation, neither are playing to win anymore. <br>
Man, I just saw something: Austria totally has the ability (in 1904) to stab for Rumania while simultaneously DESTROYING the fleet in Con, giving <span class="turkey">Dave</span> 3 fleets and an Austrian build in Vienna (Vie - Bud, Gre - Aeg, Bul S Ser - Rum, Boh - Sil or even Boh S Germany - Mun)? That would probably be enough for <span class="turkey">Dave</span> to forgive him for now because even though <span class="russia">Andrew</span> would be in Bla, he'd be down two and <span class="turkey">Dave</span> would have two fleets on Bla in S05. He's still down Trieste but he'd have 6 Centers with Boh / Vie / Bud / Rum and a crippled Russia. Wouldn't that have been an exciting twist.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
No spoilers rules. But the short version is: I think StP/Mos/War are absolutely gone in this scenario. That's 15 to 19. The other way you take Tunis is if Aegean or Greece cuts Ionian. So that's 14-20. I can't imagine I or <span class="italy">Chris</span> would have got &gt;10 of those 14, so it makes no sense to stab. <br>
But again, style comes into it too. This is just not a stab I would ever make: I'm not over the line so I'm not stabbing. Perhaps that is a weakness in my game? <br>
John Jamieson: What do you mean? <span class="austria">Peter</span> knows I would not naturally stab in this position.

I don't remember to what extent (if at all) <span class="russia">Andrew</span> and I discussed attacking <span class="austria">Peter</span>, sorry. If I had to guess, I'd say "little, if any". I was *extremely* confident at this point that <span class="turkey">Dave</span>'s 2 fleets were effectively mine (that comes across to some extent in the video, I think), so I was thinking about how to get more than my fair share of Austria. To some extent there's an advantage to keeping <span class="austria">Peter</span> "off balance", too - if I just attack him continuously, he's going to defend against me. If I switch between attacking him and working with him, he has to guess correctly which turn I'm doing which - I'm not sure that that was a conscious thought at the time, but if it wasn't, it should have been :-)

Great answer, <span class="italy">Chris Brand</span>! Funnily, while you clearly think about dip the same way I do (savage cunning), you don't **come across** that way AT ALL - something I fail to accomplish when I play. People know I'm a pragmatic, manipulative mercenary. You, on the other hand, always have a big smile on your face seemingly happy to do what everyone else wants. You are clearly a very dangerous player and deserve the title :). Well done.

<span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span>: I completely agree with what you are saying, and I think you are right not to stab. It's not close to the end of the game, and you still have opportunity to change the dynamic. Stabbing locks that dynamic in but doesn't put you in position to win.

What I find fascinating: Up until this turn, <span class="france">Nathan</span> (F) has been pursuing a strategy which I've come to think of as "the python" because he's worked with neither E or G for long and was a direct threat (until Eng-MAO, MAO-Spa (sc) to choke them both out. Even after he took Munich, <span class="germany">Doug</span> (G) was determined to get revenge on <span class="russia">Andrew</span> and not on <span class="france">Nathan</span>. <br>
While I know the outcome, at this particular point I really like <span class="france">Nathan</span>'s position. I do wish he'd taken <span class="germany">Doug</span>'s offer of support into Sil. It would have bounced, but that's better than having Russia in Sil. <br>
<span class="france">Nathan</span>, though, has played his way to a very strong position here. None of his neighbor's are upset with him and he's got the ability to go after either Italy or England.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
Going to be a lot harder to go after <span class="england">Adam</span> now. Note that I do not know the result other than the ultimate winner of the board, there's a lot of different ways to get to that result from this position though. Though I agree that stabbing <span class="england">Adam</span> for zero centers on a turn where <span class="england">Adam</span> was guaranteed to build at least one is extremely silly, so I'm not sure if <span class="france">Nathan</span> had a chance. He missed his window to convoy Picardy to Wales a few turns back.

True enough, for now. But, as <span class="england">Adam</span> continues east he's going to be tying up his units to hold dots. Meanwhile, <span class="france">Nathan</span> is taking German dots and Germany is going to help him. Italy is focused (still) in the east. <br>
Right now, the country no one wants to attack is France.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="master">Chris Martin</span>: Certainly doesn't mean I don't expect <span class="france">Nathan</span> to stab <span class="england">Adam</span> at some point! I just totally agree with the decision NOT to do it in fall 1904. Spring 1904, on the other hand (Pic - Eng - Wal, Mao - Iri...). And if you're not going to stab in Fall 1904, then there is no valid reason to stay in Eng now that <span class="germany">Doug</span> is crippled so his fleet movements are pretty much required. Can't wait for the next one!
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
Ideally (and in hindsight) I would have stabbed <span class="england">Adam</span> in the spring rather than trying to sell the Eng-MAO misorder. Sadly in the spring I wasn't 100% sure <span class="germany">Doug</span> would be broken, so I hedged to avoid creating an EG. Because of that hedge, I had to shift out of the Channel to get <span class="england">Adam</span> to head east and make sure his build would not be pointed in my direction. Also had the added benefit of showing <span class="italy">Chris</span> I was serious about the consequences of violating our non-aggression understanding in Mun. <br>
As for stabbing <span class="england">Adam</span> earlier, that wasn't an option while <span class="germany">Doug</span> was viable. I couldn't give him any room to breathe. The pressure is on him from S1901. I've been on the board with <span class="germany">Doug</span>'s Germany 2 times before this game. One ended at 14 centers the other at 17. People know he's good at Germany, but I've seen it first hand and barely stopped him soloing. There was no question in my mind that <span class="germany">Doug</span> had to be taken out of the running if I was going to have any chance at winning.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span>: Thanks for sharing your thoughts. I've never managed (or tried, really!) to have an "EF" with a french fleet in Eng for so many game years, I'm super impressed that you managed to keep him happy for this long. I also definitely agree with not stabbing in Fall '04, or the turns before that... Spring '04 was the only true turn to do it, IMO. <br>
<span class="germany">Doug</span> is a very scary player (I've played with him - and <span class="austria">Peter</span> and <span class="turkey">Dave</span>) but <span class="russia">Andrew</span> has got to be equally as scared of <span class="germany">Doug</span> as you are and honestly I'm just not afraid of EG with a preoccupied Italy and a French army in Britain, no matter who controls the pieces.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
Oh, sorry, I should have been more clear. The EG concern is about momentum and board dynamics, not an actual threat to my security. If my play in Germany doesn't pan out in Spring and I stab <span class="england">Adam</span> and an EG forms, not only is my momentum shot, but eastward pressure is gone. <br>
Those are bigger concerns here because it's a timed game. It's a race. If I get stymied for a season or two, I'm out. I have to not only get big, but I have to work to keep other powers clamped down - so it's important that there is pressure on <span class="russia">Andrew</span> so he doesn't just balloon up by plowing into <span class="austria">Peter</span>. <br>
There's also a dynamic on top boards that <span class="master">Chris</span> has already started to allude to - when people know they are out of the running, they start deciding who the winner will be. My entire strategy involves not allying with <span class="germany">Doug</span> or <span class="england">Adam</span> because I can't have parity or near parity with another power in my theater. I need to take an early lead, do everything i can to keep powers in the east small, and convince the board that I'm the WDC Champ and they should just accept that EVEN THOUGH they could do things to stop it. It comes soul crushingly close to working.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
I've never thought about it that way! Though France at 7 and England at 6 with a near lock on STP and Denmark easy to defend is basically parity... Capitalizing on <span class="germany">Doug</span> kingmaking you though is a play I never would have seen if I had been playing.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>

<span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span>: It's always easier in hindsight -- the time pressure was real, and this is when we couldn't hear out in the hallway. <br>
Jared Martin: If you've followed the game, it shouldn't be too tough to see why I'd support <span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span>. While <span class="france">Nathan</span> is certainly part of the reason I'm toast, I thought he was playing well -- I might disagree with what he's doing (attacking me), but his decisions make sense when I take my own interest out of it. I respect and understand that. Second, <span class="russia">Goff</span>'s bounce of me in Ska and helping <span class="england">Adam</span> take Den crushed my position, which is a poor reward for giving him Swe. I had to punish that, so all my dip was bent to getting <span class="england">Adam</span> to attack Russia and help <span class="france">Nathan</span>.
</p><p class="comment">

<span class="germany">Douglas Moore</span>: Makes sense - "<span class="france">Nathan</span> and I never really worked together, he just tried to grow but at least he was consistent; whereas <span class="russia">Andrew</span> betrayed me".

</p><p class="comment">
<b class="germany">Douglas Moore</b>
Jared Martin: Three reasons: 1. I'm not saying anything he hasn't heard from me, but <span class="england">Adam</span> is tough to work with. He tends to focus on a center or centers rather than position. 2. <span class="england">Adam</span> took Denmark. 3. If you look at one of the previous videos, I also pushed him hard to make moves against Russia and work with me -- he declined.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
1. This makes the most sense to me. 2. <span class="france">Nathan</span> took Munich. 3. <span class="england">Adam</span> just took Sweden and is pretty obviously going to take StP next, which is more damage to <span class="russia">Andrew</span> than <span class="france">Nathan</span> has done all game. <br>
Still, I'd like to figure out what it is about my diplomacy game that is so different from all of you resum&eacute;d top players. I've soloed online more than once, I've won a small local tournament, but the few serious tournaments I've played in my results have been basically dreadful. Clearly the sentiment among players better than me is that stabbing <span class="austria">Peter</span> is wrong here but I can't quite put my finger on what I'm missing. It must be that leap from playing with inexperienced players to playing the best players in the world - I suppose I just need more practice with y'all. <br>
Thanks again to all of you for answering all my questions!

Jared Martin: My #1 objective is to see Russia not win. Also: If you look back, I didn't contest Munich. <span class="france">Nathan</span> didn't do anything this season (or last season) that I didn't know about.

But please, please keep in mind that at Top Board this is a very specific type of game and things that happen on a timed Top Board don't always work in a regular game. <br>
A lot of the goals are different and player's assumptions have changed. For instance, there are ways of pacing your growth that can yield big results that are just not an option; no one is playing with an eye for 18; you have a much bigger stick of taking people out of the running to win the tournament than you do normally (it only takes a small knock to throw you off). The list goes on. Objectively speaking, it doesn't really matter how secure your position is at the finish line. Normally take a hit and recapture the next season or make bigger gains a year down the line, which is a tactic many of the best players will use. It doesn't work well on boards like this.

And I concur with <span class="germany">Doug</span>. I wasn't so much pulling the wool over his eyes as being in the right place to make gains off him after the Ska bounce. While my initial goal was to take <span class="germany">Doug</span> out of the running, I can also work with <span class="germany">Doug</span>, so if my high risk strategy doesn't pan out (and it was highly likely it wouldn't) I could switch gears pretty easily and smash into <span class="england">Adam</span>. <br>
I should note that my approach would be far less tolerated on a normal tournament board. Very likely EG would have gotten tired of my antics and forced me to pick a side before 1904.

Yeah, put the same players in the same powers in round 1 of the tournament and it's very unlikely that the game would have developed the same way.

I have a minor suggestion. Given the importance of the timed end to this game, it would be nice if you could mention where we are relative to that clock (I can probably figure it out, but I don't know that everyone watching it would be able to). Timing is such a huge factor in this game...

I don't think you need time stamps--I just think you'd need to, at some point in the video, remark on how far away we are from the cutoff where the game could have been called at any point. If memory serves that started at either 1pm or 2pm...

Not really.

Oh, you thought the question was cold?

Fwiw, I thought it was bold--and the exact right play. I'd say that might work on 90% of players in the time-pressured situation you all were in. <br>
And, I don't blame <span class="russia">Goff</span>. First, he's a great player. Second, Russia can grow rapidly. Maybe he can get <span class="england">Adam</span> to spin around and work FOR him, or ... who knows? Here's what <span class="russia">Goff</span> does know: even a player as gifted as he is only gets so many direct chances at a WDC, so why not?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Steve Cooley: No point leaving anything on the field on a top board at a WDC. <br>
<span class="master">Chris Martin</span>: So want to do spoilers. Not going to do spoilers. <br>
<span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span>: My play over this and the next few turns is so unorthodox that even if you'd been on fifty boards with me I'm not sure it would have helped. To comment on my mental state is always fraught (;)) but at the start of this turn I thought all was lost, and by halfway through my negotiations I'd stopped being on tilt and was very much focussed again. <br>
To all: I think a trait of all the very best players is that they can go through the emotional upheaval (for good or bad) and then refocus on the new position very quickly. You can do a little victory dance or have a little tantrum, but if it defines you and your game it hurts you Diplomatically and psychologically.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
<span class="russia">Andrew</span> - I'll believe your "it was true when I said it!" re: this exchange. I had assumed you were just being agreeable.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
It was true when I said it and it is true now. There was NO WAY I was going to let <span class="england">Silverman</span> (specifically) win the WDC after he stabbed me. NO. <br>
I thought you and <span class="austria">Peter</span> were the only two likely to win from this point (I was wrong). I would have been very happy for you to be the World Champion - I thought you'd played the better game (nothing against <span class="austria">Peter</span> :)). And I *NEVER* ruled myself out - I (from memory) always prefaced my statements with "assuming I can't". <br>
Your mileage, of course, may vary :)
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
I think your exact words regarding your chances of winning were it won't happen "barring a complete catastraphuck" - and yes, I may have just transcribed that moment tonight. F05 should be up Friday or Saturday!
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
Definitely agree with <span class="russia">Andrew</span> about being able to move on from what happened last turn and play the board as it stands.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
So to answer your questions on "Why not <span class="italy">Chris Brand</span>?" - at this point there were two things I had assumed that turned out to both be wrong. <br>
a) <span class="italy">Chris</span> would not accept any offer of help from <span class="turkey">Dave</span>. <br>
b) <span class="france">Nathan</span> was going to hit <span class="italy">Chris</span> HARD this turn and that would end his tournament, as <span class="england">Adam</span> hitting me had ended mine. <br>
I thought that left <span class="austria">Peter</span> in a position to take 4 of my centres, one or two of <span class="italy">Chris</span>' and finish on 12. I thought <span class="france">Nathan</span> and <span class="england">Adam</span> would share 20 of the others and there would be spare change for Turkey, me, or <span class="germany">Doug</span>. <br>
So my thinking was heading toward a showdown over War/Mos/Mun/Rom/Ven/Bel/Hol/Lon. No spoilers :)

Hey <span class="germany">Douglas</span>, I would have thought that you would prefer to have <span class="france">Nathan</span> use your units as they exist to support his position, after all he can always take your dots later. Did you tell him to move into Hol and Kie? Plus him not taking your dots now gives you the option to maybe get a support into Munich later and build a second fleet to try to retake Denmark. Did this sort of thinking ever enter your mind in 1905, or was it all "I want to have <span class="france">Nathan</span> get big as fast as possible because the game can end at any time."
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="germany">Douglas Moore</b>
Sure, I would prefer that, because it gives me a chance to possibly get back in the game and have a chance to possibly win. And that's just one reason why <span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span> had to take one or two from me. He also has to factor the possibility that <span class="england">Adam</span> and I combine to drive him back and he needs to grow in order to be in position to win. It's a good play by him, and certainly didn't upset me.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
<span class="germany">Douglas Moore</span> was not throwing his dots to me. He didn't come to me and say "I'm not defending these, go ahead and take them." I took them without telling him and <span class="germany">Doug</span> is right that I needed to take them for the reasons he stated. In addition, I'm building 3 this turn and it's purposeful - I want to appear inevitable and like the game is over. <span class="master">Chris</span> already hinted at what my strategy will be at the end of his video: try and convince everyone to give up. <br>
In another game I might not have taken two off <span class="germany">Doug</span> at this point.

What is the strongest move on this board in Fall '05: 1) Con - Bul/sc 2) Con - Bul/ec 3) Deliberate misorder (I can think of at least two reasons why this might be done purposely, but I won't say them now for cognitive bias reasons)

I just realized that if Bul had supported Gre, it would not have been cut and <span class="austria">Peter</span> loses nothing. Though since Gre moved, <span class="austria">Peter</span>'s moves would have had to be completely different.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
My sense from <span class="austria">Peter</span>'s negotiations following the Spring was that he thought <span class="turkey">DAVE</span> was getting supported into the dots, which is why he had Greece down as a complete loss, no point in trying to support it to hold. <br>
That being said, EC is much stronger than SC from this position. You already own Greece, and need to be able to influence Rumania/Black Sea.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
I think EC is stronger of the two coasts. But once again - a misorder that happens to leave <span class="italy">Brand</span> in the best position possible. He can make the move in fall, requiring <span class="turkey">Dave</span> to use Bla to support it, and thus gives <span class="turkey">Dave</span> no option of growing. If it was deliberate, it was genius.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span>: Eh? This was a fall turn. next chance to fix the misorder is Spring '06. Am I missing something? <br>
The reason EC is not super useful is that it can only be used to attack Rumania, a Russian Center. That would be pretty difficult to negotiate with <span class="russia">Andrew</span> the following turn, which is one of the reasons I think a misorder might make sense. <span class="italy">Chris</span> really doesn't want to be in Bul with anything but an Army; once he has a fleet in there, how does he get it out? Whereas south coast he can at least get it out (Aegean)... but while the misorder costs him a build, next turn he can support Greece in... meh, I'm not sure these reasons aren't worth the dot.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Sorry - that should have been fall next year. He slows down <span class="turkey">Dave</span>'s ambitions by a year and keeps the door open to negotiating with me. Which could be important......
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jay Heumann</b>
My initial reaction was that I'd think SC is best and intentional misorder is worst, but I also want to see if I'm proved wrong by the next couple game-years.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Mario Huys</b>
A deliberate misorder is highly unlikely. <span class="italy">Chris</span> wanted those two builds, because he feared <span class="france">Nathan</span> supporting himself into Tys. With only one build it becomes hard to defend the homeland, let alone beat back France.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
I haven't watched the video yet, but I do remember that turn fairly well :-/ It wasn't a deliberate misorder. I *think* I was still deciding which coast to go to (there are pros and cons to each, for sure). Having said that, whereas my F02 misorder felt disastrous at the time (I was thinking "well, that's the turn you killed your world champion run"), this one didn't feel nearly as bad - I felt that I was still in with a chance. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
Wow. That was a huge turn. I did enjoy <span class="russia">Andrew</span>'s "I want to shout at <span class="italy">Chris</span> for a moment". And yes, this is where I started to actually talk more rather than mostly listening, because rather than just picking which of other people's plans suit me best, I'm instead pushing them to accept (and support) my worldview. You do see some of the time aspect here, too. It was really difficult to keep track of time out in the hallway where most of the negotiations were happening.

<span class="turkey">Dave</span>'s moves were excellent here. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
. <br>
Either <span class="italy">Chris</span> keeps attacking <span class="austria">Peter</span>, in which case both <span class="turkey">Dave</span> and <span class="italy">Chris</span> advance, or <span class="italy">Chris</span> stops, and totally crushing his own position. I wish we had seen whether there had been a second followup conversation between the two.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
Dammit, <span class="master">Chris</span>, you're giving away my secrets here! Your analysis feels spot-on. Moscow of course can cover Sev.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
It seemed obvious to me that Moscow was not to be adjacent to StP but rather to cover Sev while putting pressure on Ank. Though I still don't really understand why everyone wants <span class="turkey">Dave</span> dead so badly. <span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span>, your reasoning in the last game turn or two seems to be "we have to stop <span class="france">Nathan</span> from winning, nothing else matters but stopping <span class="france">Nathan</span>, except oh yeah we have to kill <span class="turkey">Dave</span> too". Is the idea that <span class="turkey">Dave</span> wouldn't respect a stop the leader alliance if he's left alive? Or that his dots are needed to fight <span class="france">Nathan</span>?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
I made a number of overtures to <span class="turkey">Dave</span>, all of which were quickly rebuffed.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
Yeah, I don't know what it was between the two of you, but the two of you never even seemed to come close to considering the possibility of not fighting. Not bad for me, but still odd...
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
The whole "we have to stop <span class="france">Nathan</span>" thing was to get everyone's units moving away from me as well as cutting him back. <br>
I'm walking a very fine line here... I want to pick up Nwy, StP, Ank and I'm on 8. <span class="france">Nathan</span> loses two (Lpl and Mun) and <span class="italy">Chris</span> gains zero (+Bul, -Gre) and I am the world champion. <br>
You're correct, Moscow was to cover Sev, not to stay adjacent to StP, which I had no intention of taking until the end-of-times.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
If you can pick up Ank, you can end up with Con and Smy too without too much difficulty, especially if <span class="austria">Peter</span> would support an <span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span> bid for world champion. It's not like Italy has fleets to come from behind right now to win that race. <br>
I certainly think that you (<span class="russia">Andrew</span>) have the third best bid for world champion on this board after the spring '06 moves, with <span class="france">Nathan</span> #1 and <span class="italy">Chris</span> #2. Sitting on just 5 seems bad, but <span class="france">Nathan</span> has a very committed <span class="england">Adam</span> to stop him and <span class="italy">Chris</span> has a very committed <span class="austria">Peter</span> to stop him, but you have no one.

I must admit, I thought I was back in it after these moves. No spoilers though!
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
I don't know as barging into a conversation between AIR is awkward so much as a necessary part of my bid. Trying to disrupt them from coordinating - especially since I am fairly confident that my moves with <span class="austria">Peter</span> are going to go - is in my best interest. All part of the game!
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Oh, yes. Not awkward for YOU.  :)
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Bryan Pravel</b>
The mid-game is my favorite phase of most Diplomacy games. Balancing the tightrope of helping others while still giving yourself chances becomes *so* difficult. This is where understanding the motivations of other players becomes so important. I think the video captures all of this quite well. Thanks, <span class="master">Chris</span>!

He didn't own Liverpool yet?

Liverpool was French.
</p><p class="comment">

Yes - so, he's committed to taking Liverpool from <span class="france">Nathan</span> - he can't do it without using the Army, right? Cant take Denmark AND Liverpool if he puts the army in Denmark.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>John Jamieson</b>
I get that, but if the choice is between "Take Liverpool and give up the North Sea" or "Don't take Liverpool, bounce in the MAO and put an army in Denmark" I'm convoying to Denmark.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Sure - but then you have to convince <span class="russia">Goff</span>y of that plan, right? Might be a harder lift than saying you were going to put down two fleets? <span class="england">Adam</span> isn't on the facebooks, unfortunately, but I'll ask him.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>John Jamieson</b>
<span class="russia">Goff</span>y started the dialogue over Denmark, with "can I get Denmark?" That makes it harder to get from fleet into Denmark to army into Denmark.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
John Jamieson: I was late with the camera, but I _think_ the original ask was from <span class="england">Adam</span>, and <span class="russia">Goff</span> was like: "Yeah... No, why would I do that?" But you might be right. Army Denmark would definitely have been superior if he could have made it happen.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="england">Adam</span> had Nth S Eng - Bel, would have worked too, only possible cut was from <span class="germany">Doug</span>. I think Denmark is better though. Bel is really crappy to take with a Fleet if you're England.

I can only imagine what's going through <span class="austria">Yeargin</span>'s mind here. <br>
"Okay, so I'm supporting <span class="italy">Brand</span> to Trieste with Serbia... <br>
Hang on. I don't have an army in Serbia. <br>
Never mind, I'll build there next turn." <br>
As <span class="master">Chris</span> mentioned in the video, that top board pressure must be insane!

<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
And this is where I blew it. Let me explain my thinking - I thought <span class="italy">Chris</span> was lying to me. I expected Bla - Sev and that <span class="italy">Chris</span> would crunch Austria this turn. I got it TOTALLY wrong. <br>
If I had not let my paranoia get the better of me, Arm - Bla, take two centres in the north, tell Germany to take Kiel with the fleet and support it in with Berlin. And I win the game from there. I pride myself on poise and patience (even if the Diplomacy is fiery sometimes), but I failed on both this turn - the pressure was IMMENSE. (You can even tell from the swearing).
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>

I try to match the flavour of the game when it comes to saltiness. But here it was just frustration :(
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
But fascinating to hear that - it totally explains why you didn't take advantage of knowing <span class="turkey">Dave</span>'s moves.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
That's a good plan, but I don't know if I'd trust <span class="germany">Doug</span> to do a plan where you gain an effective French center (Kiel to Germany, Denmark to England, Norway to you) when he can keep the center being <span class="france">Nathan</span>'s by just holding. We haven't seen <span class="germany">Doug</span> on camera in a while, I actually expected <span class="germany">Doug</span> to do Den s Ber - Kie so he could try to build in Berlin, but I strongly doubt <span class="germany">Doug</span> would do Den - Kie. If you thought he would, though, I suppose it's still good, but I don't expect <span class="england">Adam</span> to continue his single minded crusade once you stab him.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
FWIW, <span class="germany">Doug</span> DID do Den -> Kiel.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="master">Chris Martin</span>: I know, but without Berlin's support. I doubt he expected it to work. Or maybe he thought he might get Russian support into Munich, and he was trying to keep Kiel vacant once he had Mun / Ber / Den. Or maybe he thought Mun - Boh was happening and he could surprise <span class="france">Nathan</span>.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Kiel was French at this point. no point keeping it open.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
Not keep Kiel vacant to build there, keep Kiel vacant to make it easier to attack if Ber - Mun did work.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
*shrug* Better to have France out of place in the centre than having options to support. But 6 of 1....
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="germany">Douglas Moore</b>
Yes, <span class="master">Chris Martin</span>, it was part of our conversations. Basically, if I recall correctly, it was 'we can determine who wins this board, it could still be anyone.' They were *very* interesting conversations.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="germany">Douglas Moore</b>
Also, in order to make that move worthwhile, I need to clear Berlin to build. I figured <span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span> would move north, but he couldn't support both. I wasn't sure what he'd do, so I picked Ber-Mun, asking for the support from Sil (which was offered by <span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span>).
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
You thought I'd lie to you? Weird....
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
I think <span class="russia">Andrew</span> is not taking his winning chances here seriously; this is backed up by the way he talks to <span class="austria">Peter</span> about it. I totally support his play to give Denmark to <span class="england">Adam</span>, but he's going to need StP if he wants to top this board, not with the intention of stabbing <span class="england">Adam</span>, but just because he will need to build there once <span class="france">Nathan</span> is stopped, so he needs it to be his AND he needs it to be vacant. Compounded with the fact that F Edi is just not going to be that useful, AND the fact that he knows exactly what <span class="turkey">Dave</span>'s moves are, I think the play here is to tell <span class="england">Adam</span> he's going to take StP while also supporting him (<span class="england">Adam</span>) into Den, and then offer to try to give <span class="england">Adam</span> a dot the following season, either another build in London or a build in Liverpool if possible, both of which would be much more useful, and promise to build an army in Warsaw which would be a lot more useful for fighting <span class="france">Nathan</span> than F Edi. <br>
In a similar vein, as <span class="austria">Peter</span> I probably would have made some totally different play knowing all the moves like Vie S Bud - Tri, Gre - Ser, and then made a case about home centers and how it left the center counts the same but it restored a home center (and allowed a build in Budapest); it sounded like they were pretty sure he was backing out of Tyrolia but I don't know how sure that was. <br>
*shrug* I always take home centers very seriously and a #1 priority, but it really seems like for all the actual players the count matters a lot more than home centers. Especially strategic home centers like the only place that Russia can build a northern fleet and the only place that Austria can build a fleet, at all. Thoughts?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Hi Jared - I made mistakes this turn, but a northern Russian fleet does not help me get any centres at all in the timeframe for this game, so StP was not a priority - as explained elsewhere, I prioritised covering Sev over StP. Being told a person's orders is not the same as knowing them. I had no reason at all to trust <span class="italy">Chris</span> this turn, and it was on his word alone I knew Turkish moves.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
I wish I knew more about the timing. Were you in the mode where the game could end at any moment? It seems to me like a second northern fleet helps you get Nwy (if England manages to get stronger it's no longer a lock), Den, Baltic for a support into Ber... if your plan is to grow past 7 centers (home, Nwy Swe Rum), what's the 8th going to be? If you say Ank, fine, but what's the 9th? A center from <span class="austria">Peter</span>? Con? If you can't attack Italy or Austria then you need another Northern fleet to have any chance to keep growing. Unless you expect to be able to stab <span class="austria">Peter</span> and then have the game called before <span class="france">Nathan</span> punishes you for doing so. Maybe 8 would be enough for world champion, but I don't think so. Someone needs to own the German centers and its unlikely to be <span class="germany">Doug</span>. Will <span class="austria">Peter</span> or <span class="italy">Chris</span> just give them to you?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Jared Martin: Game can't possibly be called on time before 2pm, and its around 12:30 during these moves.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
(So thinking: 2 more years - StP, Ber, Nwy, Ank. Remember I win ties against Austria, France, and England - so trying to set up a magical 7-7-7-7-6 result is sufficient for me... Home, Rum, Swe, Ank... plus Berlin maybe? Plus Norway maybe? But if I start looking like I'm ahead <span class="austria">Peter</span> or <span class="england">Adam</span> will gut me. It's not as simple as that, but I hope that is some insight into my thinking?)
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
But how does France get back down to 7 without <span class="england">Adam</span>'s full cooperation?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Which is why I'm not taking StP and I'm giving him Denmark.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
I meant in your "I decide not to be paranoid" scenario.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Ah - but then I'm on 7 aiming for 10. Entirely different scenario - racing against <span class="france">Nathan</span> and <span class="italy">Chris</span>. Which I should have been  :(
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
Oh, I guess in that scenario you DO have StP and you can build another fleet :) Derp!
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Yes. Although even then there's some interesting thoughts as to whether a second A War is more critical (obviously, my builds if I took StP And Nwy, were A War and A Sev)
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span>: Piece of advice that has served me well in the past, which may or may not be relevant here, you tell me: If I am in a scenario where I have reason to be paranoid, but actually being paranoid will result in 100% chance to lose, and trusting will result in < 100% chance to lose if not stabbed, then I jump off the cliff and trust. <br>
Seems to me that either going the whole hog here (Nwy and StP) or some shenanigans with "I want my home center back but I'm still supporting you into Denmark and Nwy is safe and I'll help you build in Lvp later" was needed here, thus my earlier comment that I guessed you were underestimating your chances to win. When in reality you just were being paranoid, same result... I think a 7-7-7-7 tie or an 8-8-8-8 tie is too unlikely, the goal needs to be 10-12. My arrmchair quarterbacking again.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
If I lose Sev, I'm cooked no matter what. and given I genuinely think F Bla - Sev, my moves make sense.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
Unfortunately <span class="russia">Andrew</span> played this right by not hassling <span class="england">Adam</span>. If he had taken StP and/or Nwy right now there is a decent chance that the outcome of the game could have been different.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
If you genuinely think Bla - Sev, then just use Arm to cover, no? You could even do Rum - Sev, Arm - Sev; I don't think you care that much if <span class="austria">Peter</span> drops Bulgaria (which would require <span class="italy">Chris</span> to stab along with <span class="turkey">Dave</span>, because Gre S Bul).
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span>: Because <span class="england">Adam</span> plays differently (mad at <span class="russia">Andrew</span>) or because <span class="england">Adam</span> needed the Edi build?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
<span class="england">Adam</span> has a purpose right now and if <span class="russia">Andrew</span> just takes centers off him, it's going to do one of a few things. <span class="england">Adam</span> is probably going to be reduced to threatening the board that he's no longer going to stop me from winning. Or he will actually help me. If nothing else it gives me something to work with diplomatically, which is much more than I have now. <br>
Way better for <span class="russia">Goff</span> to just point <span class="england">Adam</span> at me and focus on the East.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span>: That's why I think the play is to make the case for just StP and tell <span class="england">Adam</span> he's doing it while giving him Denmark. <span class="england">Adam</span> might not agree with the "Home Centers are sacrosanct" mentality but it's at least understandable. "I'll take StP now and use it to build A War and give you Kiel"
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
I really wish that would have happened. It would have made <span class="england">Adam</span> pause and consider what to do about <span class="russia">Andrew</span>.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="france">Nathan Barnes</span>: While I 100% agree that it increases your chances of being world champion, it ALSO increases <span class="russia">Andrew</span>'s. Your best chance to be world champion is to break <span class="england">Adam</span>'s single-mindedness, or beat the board tactically until time is called (very difficult in this position with only 9 centers - counting Lvp - arguably impossible). <span class="russia">Andrew</span> doing this really helps with the former, true, it creates a chink in the armor. But if you don't top, and <span class="russia">Andrew</span> doesn't take StP, it's going to be <span class="italy">Chris</span> or somehow maybe <span class="england">Adam</span>. But some crazy 7-7-7-7 tie is not going to happen. So making the thread and needle play is <span class="russia">Andrew</span>'s only one, increasing your chances and his own at the expense of (mostly) <span class="england">Adam</span> and a little bit of <span class="italy">Chris</span>.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
I'm not arguing - I was really relying on <span class="russia">Andrew</span> taking the approach you're suggesting.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
Regarding <span class="turkey">Dave</span>'s moves, I was the only one he'd actually told them to, I believe, so everyone else is relying on <span class="turkey">Dave</span> having been honest with me, me reading <span class="turkey">Dave</span> correctly and me not lying to them. One thing I've noticed over the last few videos is that I was 100% confident that <span class="turkey">Dave</span> was being straight with me, but I had to work hard to convince anybody else of that.

Chris Barfield: Trolling competent friends are the most fun, you don't get witty comebacks otherwise. Similarly, the only reason it's fun (for me anyway) to comment on <span class="russia">Andrew</span> and <span class="austria">Peter</span>'s play like I did this turn is because I respect them and am interested in their response.

Yes, I was expecting Sil s Ber-Mun, and not expecting support for <span class="england">Adam</span> into Den. I wanted to take a crack at what was a pretty chaotic situation to get back into the mix, and it would also have helped <span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span> as well.

It would have been *crazy* to look at your orders, right? It's okay. "Mistakes" happen from time to time--just another example of what I like about not having a UI to input orders: "mistakes" are part of the game. ;)

</p><p class="comment">
<b>Chuck Spiekerman</b>
I am interested in this comment. What would be the reasoning as to why allowing for misadjudications would be good for the game? I guess it would reward the player who is facile enough to catch misadjudications relative to the person who is not as good, who might not be able to catch the glitch that burned him/her. Should the ability to catch conflicts between the written and adjudicated moves be a skill that differentiates players' standings?
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
For me, I think going to a UI would remove the "human element"--the foibles and errant play. I think being error-free and tracking movement on the board are skills that should be "rewarded."
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Chuck Spiekerman</b>
OK, so if being able to catch mismoves is important, is the corollary that one should be able to intentionally mismove to test the other players' ability to catch him/her? <br>
Is that fair play? Somewhat akin to taking what the ref will give you in soccer or baseball?

Dees misorders, mang. <span class="italy">Chris Brand</span> why go for GoL before Pie? If you don't agree to the Bohemia gambit you can put two on Pie and two on GoL (and in this case would have gotten both, and would have destroyed one of <span class="france">Nathan</span>'s units (they can't both retreat to Mar). And then, if <span class="france">Nathan</span>'s orders had been adjucated correctly, you would have had Spain forced this season (so much for attacking <span class="austria">Peter</span> being faster).
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
<span class="germany">Douglas</span> described my reasoning perfectly. I was far more interested in the dots in the east than in the west. I may have been able to get away with not ordering Tyl as well as Tri, though, which seems like a better position. "How much can I get away with without scaring my ally too much?" is always a fun game...
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
<span class="italy">Chris</span>, if <span class="russia">Goff</span> were on board I totally agree with killing <span class="austria">Peter</span> first, but since he's not, and given that you're sending all those fleets west, you're not actually outnumbering <span class="austria">Peter</span>. You can't really use Venice precisely because <span class="france">Nathan</span> is in Pie, which leaves Boh and Tri and a really far away Smy to fight <span class="austria">Peter</span>. Don't get me wrong, it's certainly possible, but it would require a perfect outguess / knowing <span class="austria">Peter</span>'s orders in the fall. <br>
*shrug*. With this many units committed West, and with <span class="england">Adam</span> fully invested West, it seems like you could try to pick up three dots from <span class="france">Nathan</span> and then head east with a position on the good side of a stalemate line.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
I don't remember my private negotiations with <span class="russia">Andrew</span> at that time, so I can't say whether he was on board with the idea or not. <span class="austria">Peter</span> *is* his most likely source of dots, though, so at the very least it does sound like a plan I could convince him was wise...

No spoilers. But at the end of S1907 I was not on board with it. Why? Because that's a horse race I lose.

Also, remember my theory: 8 or 9 centres is plenty: 5+Ank+Ber+StP... Austria on 6; Italy on 7; France on 7; England on 6. That's my narrow path as I see it at this point.

Seeing that order set of mine now, it seems extremely risky. Not sure whether that's just because of <span class="master">Chris</span>' commentary :-) I was obviously (correctly) very confident that I knew what <span class="austria">Peter</span> was ordering (despite my not having moved Trieste as we'd agreed last turn). Lots of hold orders with the fleets because (a) they weren't going to succeed in taking anything anyway and (b) to try to convince <span class="france">Nathan</span> that <span class="england">Adam</span> was the one he needed to worry about, not me.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
Could have dropped a support of Nao - Mao, not sure if you want <span class="england">Adam</span> going faster here, but it's something that had a chance of working. Also you never know, just because someone has an uncuttable support doesn't mean they won't misorder or forget to write an order down, especially in this game :D (obviously, <span class="france">Nathan</span> can't both cut Wes and also guarantee keeping Spain).
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
My reasoning was that the diplomatic benefit of making <span class="france">Nathan</span> feel like I'm not much of a threat in the Med far outweighs the long shot of taking a dot from him
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
I really thought <span class="austria">Peter</span> wouldn't stab me. Because he's a very good liar, but also because every centre he takes <span class="italy">Chris</span> just takes one off him - to see the negotiations and him actually giving that away... oh well. <br>
For those watching at home... stay tuned to this right here.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
There is absolutely no reason, in my opinion, for <span class="austria">Peter</span> to say to <span class="italy">Chris</span> "I want to stab <span class="russia">Andrew</span> and also I'll give you a center". Italy has plenty of centers, and also a strong ally (for now anyway) with <span class="england">Adam</span>. Why not just go Vie - Tyr, Bud - Rum, Bul - Ser, Gre S Bul - Ser, and plant both Armies? If he has any hope of taking the title for himself, he should be thinking about how he gets Trieste back, not about stopping <span class="france">Nathan</span>. <span class="france">Nathan</span> is already stopped. <br>
Maybe it doesn't work in this group, but I have, in the past, seen great success with "I would love to ally with you but I can't abide you owning my home center. I am not talking about stabbing you, I am telling you to your face that I would love to work with you but the only way it can work for me is to return my home center." It doesn't work (and I wouldn't try it) if the person I'm talking to is well positioned to attack me, but it almost always works if the person I'm talking to would really rather be fighting someone else. "I'll put an army in Tyrolia and I'll help you take Pie and you can treat it as your unit, give it whatever orders you want, I'll support you into Munich, but I need my home center back." Perhaps better players wouldn't go along with this?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Jared Martin: That is an interesting line. I don't see it playing with this crowd, though - a dot's a dot, and if we're working together, heck, that's a dot I can't stab you for. <br>
I can't speak to <span class="austria">Peter</span>'s state of mind here, but he probably expected the game to go on longer, and was worried that if he didn't keep <span class="italy">Chris</span> on board, he'd just run in on him.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
From what we saw of the negotiations, <span class="austria">Peter</span> never *offered* the dot, he agreed to my request for it. And of course every request is a veiled threat...

</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
<span class="austria">Peter</span> was in a very tough spot. He's doing what he has to do to try to get some momentum which I'm sure felt really really close. You can see him trying to wiggle out of his earlier commitment to give a dot to <span class="italy">Brand</span> for Rum, and <span class="italy">Brand</span> very pointedly doesn't give him the out. He wants to know exactly which dot. It's good Diplomacy on his part. <br>
My growth ended when <span class="russia">Goff</span> let <span class="england">Adam</span> off the hook. All the East's talk of stopping me is just a foil for trying to figure out how their theater is going to shake out. They're well aware they don't need to come up the middle and <span class="italy">Brand</span> is moving fleets my direction halfheartedly because he doesn't really want to go in that direction. Dots come much faster in the East. <br>
No one is playing for a solo or the optimal position to grow long term.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Will Black</b>
A couple of things that spring to mind. Top boards are not standard games, and time. Time is probably the main factor. As the players know that time will be called at some point, so having one more dot now is better as the time draw may occur and that one dot could cost you the title chance.

Yeah, <span class="england">Adam</span>'s moves are surprising.

Speaking for myself, I sent fleets west almost entirely to help my diplomacy in the east. A secondary consideration was that doing so made it more likely that <span class="england">Adam</span> could take something from you, and a distant third was the possibility of picking up a dot from you myself.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
I think <span class="italy">Chris</span>' non-action against <span class="france">Nathan</span> was superb. He breaks down <span class="france">Nathan</span>'s position and <span class="england">Adam</span> is a HUGE threat. He lets them duke it out and it's the perfect result for him.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
There's a definite contrast between what we see of <span class="england">Adam</span>'s negotiations with <span class="france">Nathan</span> and his moves. Of course there could be plenty we aren't seeing, but it certainly seemed that <span class="france">Nathan</span> failed miserably to convince <span class="england">Adam</span> to turn around. <br>
Two fairly subtle things that I liked from that one: <br>
1) <span class="france">Nathan</span> getting the SC ownership wrong hurt his credibility with <span class="england">Adam</span>. If he'd said "you have one easy dot in Sweden versus a chance to get one from me", <span class="england">Adam</span> would have been much more receptive. Never suggest moves to someone and try to sell them with "you can take X" if they already own X :-) <br>
2) Kind of similar with <span class="austria">Peter</span> and <span class="russia">Andrew</span> - if <span class="austria">Peter</span> had started with the plan that gets them both to 7, <span class="russia">Andrew</span> may have been more receptive. You definitely have to push to do better than your ally out of any deal you make, but you have to be very careful where you pick as your starting point. <br>
Bonus #3 - you can see from <span class="russia">Andrew</span>'s negotiations here why he's won WDC twice :-)
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
And, <span class="russia">Andrew</span> was clearly being transparent with you. If I've learned one thing about <span class="russia">Goff</span> over the past few months it's this: he really likes good play, even if it's against him. However, he loathes bad play, particularly when it's against him. He made it pretty plain he was not a fan of <span class="austria">Yeargin</span> one-dotting him. Further, <span class="austria">Peter</span>'s explanation--that he had to stab <span class="russia">Goff</span> for one to set up a really BIG stab of you doesn't hold water. He could have had you for a couple of dots, but went after <span class="russia">Goff</span>. No explanation was going to ameliorate that.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
<span class="england">Adam</span> and I talked a lot more than what's here. Mostly only talked to <span class="italy">Brand</span> and <span class="england">Silverman</span> with a little talk from <span class="germany">Doug</span> this round. And remember, <span class="germany">Doug</span> also leaned on <span class="england">Silverman</span> to turn around.

I really think <span class="england">Adam</span>'s price for backing off needed to be something like Hol / Kie / Ber (otherwise I'll take Brest), with a Holland convoy in Spring of this year.

Another good webisode. For you fans at home, synching your internal clock is sooooooo important.

I think you're being too harsh on yourself over distracting <span class="france">Nathan</span>. Potentially the most important move he could put in (the Tyrolian support) he got in, and it's hard to imagine he hadn't thought that through beforehand. As for other moves - from how I see the board, anyhow - he's locked into a position where he essentially has to hold, due to the English pressure from the north and the Italian pressure from the south. <br>
What could he have done this phase? Taken Berlin maybe, but since <span class="germany">Doug</span> is fairly solidly aligned with him right now that just takes a friendly unit out of Germany and puts it into France - that only helps if he frees up Bre for a fleet build and doing so would be fairly risky. The unit in Mun is really the only one that could be justifiably doing something else - but what, exactly? <br>
I don't think the number of hold orders is entirely down to the clock here. If I had that position, I'd be struggling to think of a decent moveset anyhow.

Don't be too hard on yourself re <span class="france">Nathan</span>. He could have said, "Not now, <span class="master">Chris</span>. I have to write orders."
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
I think this is right. We were all well aware that helping you make these videos was a lower priority than actually playing the game, and I don't think any of us would have shied away from telling you to go away. Not even <span class="france">Nathan</span>, reserved though he is.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
Btw, I loved that turn from <span class="russia">Andrew</span>! He did lose War, but it was a calculated gamble intended to keep him in the game. His analysis of the players and pieces is spot-on right now (in the game).
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
At this point I'm just tactically fighting everyone next to me on the board. I'd say however good my turn was here, there has been a catastrophic failure of negotiation up to this point on my behalf.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
<span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span>: I'm not convinced that the choice not to take at least one - StPete, Norway - from <span class="england">Adam</span> was the deciding factor?
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
Not to pile on, but I thought leaving both was *very* generous. <br>
Even so, the way you are playing at this moment of the game is so good. If <span class="austria">Yeargin</span> had not matched your skill (in guessing Warsaw), you'd still have an outside chance.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
!!! I strongly disagree with <span class="austria">Yeargin</span> matching my skill this turn. Warsaw was a terrible move for him; one I was 100% happy for him to make and [spoiler alert].
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
As for StP and Nwy... hindsight is what it is. If I'd taken one and he'd collapsed to <span class="france">Nathan</span> then we'd be having the discussion in reverse... but given I now know how he plays I would have taken StP. My only regret in this game, other than [spoiler alert], was that I didn't get to [spoiler alert].
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
A War is definitely little use to <span class="austria">Peter</span> in the final position.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
<span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span>: I should have been more clear: I was referring to the guess. 90% of players would figure you would cover War with Sil. <br>
Personally, I think going after you was a strategic mistake on his part. <span class="italy">Chris</span> was obviously the bigger threat and I think he had more to gain working with you than against you. So, my comment about "matching" was meant to be restricted only to the taking of Warsaw--whatever the disadvantages of it were, it was a dot. <br>
I'd go so far as to say <span class="austria">Peter</span> burned his bridge with you almost completely this turn for very little to no gain. (Although you already weren't buying his diplomacy, this turn just showed there was no reason left to do so.)
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
Steve Cooley: Not convinced by your "90%" :-) Holding War isn't particularly useful for <span class="russia">Andrew</span> at this point.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
Spot on, <span class="italy">Chris</span> - I'm just thinking now and I think I actually prefer him in Warsaw to Galicia. I think his best move was to cover Vienna... but with that French support.... didn't matter. <br>
Steve Cooley: <span class="austria">Peter</span> was a dead man walking the moment he attacked me, so burning bridges this turn was fairly not a consideration on his behalf. I actually think he realised that attacking me was no good as soon as he saw he couldn't hold Sevastopol (Although one interesting thing that hasn't been raised yet is that he could have been in Sev with a retreat to Armenia... which would have been an almighty mess to clean up). To his credit he made efforts to patch things up with me... but [spoiler alert again].
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
I was surprised that he walked back to Rumania, but if he had a hope, it was to get the build from War/Sev and <span class="france">Nathan</span> helped him hold Vienna. In that world, he might have had a [spoiler alert].
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
<span class="master">Chris Martin</span>: Not with me coming for him [no spoiler at all].
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
He could have ended up owning Vie/Bud/Rum/Bul/Gre/War/Sev for 7, no? Or at least 6 of those, which is in the running.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
I question your math there, <span class="italy">Chris</span>. 7 with only four powers left is not enough to win.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
(Or <span class="germany">Doug</span> and I on 1 each.)
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
I stand by the idea that 7 at the end of 1908 is "in the running". From there he picks up Mos and/or Ser, maybe Tri...
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
<span class="italy">Chris Brand</span>: Okay, not saying it was a "good" move. I am saying that most players wold not look at Warsaw with three Russian units next to it and think, "I'm taking Warsaw."
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Jared Martin</b>
I'm sort of stunned that <span class="england">Adam</span> thinks <span class="austria">Peter</span> is a bigger threat than <span class="france">Nathan</span> or <span class="italy">Chris</span> here. Or maybe that was just a strategic line.
</p><p class="comment">
<b>Steve Cooley</b>
It's interesting how different players can see the map differently. It's hard to see how <span class="england">Adam</span> could have believed that--and maybe he didn't. But, sometimes you run into situations wherein a player gives you his/her assessment and you want to ask, "Are we still in the same game?"
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
He didn't believe it.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
Thanks for denying me the World Championship, <span class="master">Chris Martin</span>. It was definitely your fault for talking to me for 30 seconds. Not <span class="russia">Andrew Goff</span>'s perfectly-sound-but-exceedingly-inconvenient-for-me approach to dealing with England. And besides, what are the odds that I am just putting on a show because I've decided that injecting drama would help me next season? Seems slim.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="master">Chris Martin</b>
Hey - not interfering with the game was a big concern of mine. I know you can haz drama!
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
It's a valid concern. I am just saying it had a minimal impact here. I would probably have been out there talking to someone at that point regardless. I clearly missed the 2 min and 1 min warnings already and thought I had more time.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="russia">Andrew Goff</b>
<span class="france">Nathan</span>, I think we can both agree that we lost the championship because of <span class="england">Adam Silverman</span>.
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="france">Nathan Barnes</b>
I 100% agree with that <span class="russia">Andrew</span>. It's all on video! It's demonstrably true. All I am saying is you COULD have decided to make me the belle of the ball rather than that poopy old <span class="italy">Chris Brand</span>. Instead I'm stuck with yet another Miss Congeniality not-even-a-real-tiara. Again.

At least you got a tiara. All I got was [Insert Cards Against Humanity Card].

<span class="italy">Chris Brand</span>: Looks like you didn't do the "always stab on the last turn" move set. Can you speak to the probability of the game ending, whether you factored that in, or whether there were other reasons for not attacking in all directions like a Sharpian Hedgehog?
</p><p class="comment">
<b class="italy">Chris Brand</b>
The key factor is that we didn't know the game was ending at this point (in fact it ended very early in the window when we were told it could end). I didn't think I needed more dots right then. Essentially, I was playing this turn to "stay ahead and have options for continuing to grow in the future as needed". Last thing I needed was to annoy everyone and then have to fight them all off for two years...
