<p><p>Abraham Lincoln&rsquo;s Gettysburg Address included the phrase &ldquo;&hellip;of the people, by the people, for the people&hellip;&rdquo;. Lincoln was describing the normative nature of government, but I want to steal the expression to speak about <em>The Zine</em>.</p>
<p>The e-publication is <em>for</em>, <em>of</em>, and (and should be) <em>by</em> readers &ndash; <strong>Diplomacy</strong> fans and players, <strong>Diplomacy</strong> widow(er)s and orphans.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is not enough <em><strong>by&hellip;</strong> </em>We need more writers! We need more editors!</p>

<p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so pleased to see and read Zachary Jarvie&rsquo;s by-line. I predict he&rsquo;ll be a force in the game, and <em>The Zine</em>.</p>
<p>This is my close as an HTML editor. It was tedious work at times &ndash; but worth it. I find inspiration in the workload Mario Huys carries, and the professional attitude he has about Excellence. </p>
<p>And too many of the late players we have recently memorialized were much younger than I am.</p>
<p>Additionally, I <em>believe</em> - although I can&rsquo;t prove it - <em>you</em> enjoy<em> The Zine.</em></p>
<p>So this is a recruitment call to lend a hand with this e-publication. There are a number of ways: 1) Submit an article. You know you&rsquo;ve thought &lsquo;I <em>gotta</em> do that!&rsquo; We&rsquo;ll use a pseudonym if you&rsquo;re shy. 2) Submit photos (and Internet memes) that would be of interest to your <em>cohorts</em>. 3. If you can speak &ldquo;HTML&rdquo; you are needed to assist and convert text. Zachary submitted his piece in Word, and HTML. He included his own images. It&rsquo;s a pleasure to work with a young writer/player like him.</p>
<p>I sincerely thank you all. As Gen. Douglas MacArthur said, &ldquo;Old soldiers never die. They just fade away&hellip;&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote><i>Kevin is a fan of the <b>Machiavelli</b> variant, writing columns on it, organizing games and tracking down all related articles. In fact I suspect that's what led him to the Zine. He has lightened us up with his peculiar style of humor and contributed many new ideas. The <a href="../../W2015A/special.html">Christmas special</a>, where his input is most prominent, was his idea. But the most enduring is his <a href="../../About.html">style guide</a> for Zine articles. We're all indebted to him and I the most. [DH]</i></blockquote>
