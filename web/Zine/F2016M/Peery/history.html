<p><b>History of diplomacy</b>
<ul><li> F. Adcock and D. J. Mosley, <b>Diplomacy</b> in Ancient Greece (1975)
The only full length study of this subject. Extremely valuable
<li> M. S. Anderson, The Rise of Modern <b>Diplomacy</b>, 1450-1919 (1993)
A solid historical treatment by a former Professor of International History at the LSE.
<li>Sonia Anderson, An English Consul in Turkey: Paul Rycaut at Smyrna, 1667-1678 (1989)
A very illuminating window on mid-seventeenth century consular work; superbly researched.
<li>Barber, Peter, <b>Diplomacy</b>: The world of the honest spy (1979).
An authoritative and richly illustrated, brief history of diplomatic practice from about 1400 to 1900. It was designed to complement an exhibition on this theme held at the British Library (which, regrettably, I missed) but, as the author says in his Preface, presents 'a coherent survey of the subject which stands quite independently of the exhibition.'
<li>G.R. Berridge, Diplomatic Classics: Selected texts from Commynes to Vattel (2004)
There is a description of this book on the Palgrave page.

<li>Adda B. Bozeman, Politics and Culture in International History, 2nd ed (1994)
A most important book, with very interesting sections. 9 and 13 on Byzantine, Venetian and modern European diplomacy
<li>Gordon A. Craig and Felix Gilbert (eds), The Diplomats, 1919-1939 (1953)
<li>Gordon A. Craig and Francis L. Loewenheim (eds), The Diplomats, 1939-1979 (1994)
Two well-known collections of essays by major writers. Mainly dealing with important ambassadors (esp. the first volume), they also contain chapters dealing with foreign ministries, political figures who made a major impact on the foreign policies of their states, and more general issues
<li> G. P. Cuttino, English Medieval <b>Diplomacy</b> (1985)
By the author of English Diplomatic Administration, 1259-1339, 2nd ed (1971), published by Oxford Univ. Press. Authoritative. The earlier book is now out of print. For this, try www.abebooks.co.uk.
<li>J.G. Dickinson, The Congress of Arras, 1435 (1955)
An authoritative and most illuminating account of medieval multilateral diplomacy, drawn to my attention by Anne-Brigitte Spitzbarth (University of Lille III).
<li> Simon Franklin and Jonathan Shepard (eds), Byzantine <b>Diplomacy</b>: Papers of the Twenty-fourth Spring Symposium of Byzantine Studies, Cambridge March 1990 (1992)
A comprehensive collection of essays of a uniformly high standard.
<li> L. S. Frey and M. L. Frey, The History of Diplomatic Immunity (1999).
<li> Grenville-Murray, E. C., Side-Lights on English Society, or Sketches from Life, Social and Satirical (1881), vol. 1, pp. 151-254 ('On H.B.M.'s Service').
A satirical treatment of British diplomacy in the mid-nineteenth century, often highly amusing. The engravings, however, are disappointing. G-M deals with each position in the diplomatic service according to his view of the order of precedence, starting with ambassadors &ndash; and putting ambassadresses last, after messengers and interpreters.
<li> Isobel Grundy, Lady Mary Wortley Montagu: Comet of the Enlightenment (1999)
Bags of detail; an exhaustively researched biography. Excellent value in paperback from first class publisher (OUP).
<li> Keith Hamilton, Bertie of Thames: Edwardian Ambassador(1990)
Lord Bertie (pronounced 'Bartie') was British Ambassador to France from 1905 until 1918 and after the First World War was widely held to epitomize the 'old diplomacy'. This is a formidably researched and polished account of his diplomatic career, focusing chiefly on his Paris embassy, by an author who was a full-time academic before becoming an FCO historian. This is a model for ambassador studies. Keith Hamilton is also co-author of the textbook noted below.
<li>Keith Hamilton and Richard Langhorne, The Practice of <b>Diplomacy</b>, 2nd ed (2011)
A very valuable historical account of the evolution of diplomatic practice but &ndash; unlike Anderson's book &ndash; goes back further (to Ancient Greece) and comes up much nearer to the present. I recommend this textbook to my students as one that is complementary to my own.
<li>David Jayne Hill, A History of <b>Diplomacy</b> in the International Development of Europe, vol. 1 (1905)
<li>David Jayne Hill, A History of <b>Diplomacy</b> in the International Development of Europe, vol. 2 (1906)
<li> David Jayne Hill, A History of <b>Diplomacy</b> in the International Development of Europe, vol. 3 (1914)
<li>Hopkins, Michael F. et al (eds), The Washington Embassy: British ambassadors to the United States, 1939-77 (2009).
Eleven good essays with a conclusion by me and John Young.
<li>Raymond A. Jones, The Nineteenth Century Foreign Office (1971)
Ditto.
<li>Raymond A. Jones, The British Diplomatic Service 1815-1914 (1983)
A generally sound, well-organized account.
<li>Mario Liverani, International Relations in the Ancient Near East, 1600-1100 BC (2002)
An immensely authoritative work by the Professor of History of the Ancient Near East and Director of the Inter-University Research Centre for Saharan Archaeology at the University of Rome. It is a revised version of a book originally published in Padua in 1990 as Prestige and Interest.
<li>Garrett Mattingly, Renaissance <b>Diplomacy</b> (1955)
The widely acclaimed classic account of the birth of the resident embassy in Renaissance Italy. A superb book. Should be read in conjunction with Donald Queller's splendid The Office of Ambassador in the Middle Ages, though this is now out of print (find it second-hand via www.abebooks.com).
<li>Markus M&ouml;sslang, Chris Manias and Torsten Riotte, British Envoys to Germany 1816-1866: Volume 4, 1851-1866 (Camden Fifth Series) (2011)
<li>Markus M&ouml;sslang, Torsten Riotte and Hagen Schulze, British Envoys to Germany 1816-1866: Volume 3: 1848-1850: 1848-1850 v. 3 (Camden Fifth Series) (2006)
<li> Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, The Turkish Embassy Letters, intro. Anita Desai (Virago ed. 1995)
Lady Mary was the highly intelligent, adventurous, and unconventional wife of an early eighteenth century British ambassador in Istanbul. These famous letters, extracted from the complete collection, are essential reading for anyone interested in women and diplomacy.
<li>David Paull Nickles, Under the Wire: How the Telegraph Changed <b>Diplomacy</b> (2003)
The first full-length study of this important subject. Recommended by the State Department's historian.
<li>Donald M. Nicol, Byzantium and Venice: A study in diplomatic and cultural relations (1988, PoD edn 1992)
I started to skim this for passages dealing with Byzantine diplomatic method but got hooked and read it from cover to cover. It manages to be rich in detail without obscuring the main themes. A brilliant and sometimes quite gripping historical narrative. Also particularly good on the role of the Venetian baillie. Devotees of the historical novels of Dorothy Dunnett (esp. the House of Niccolo series) should read this book. Fact really is stranger than fiction.
<li>Harold Nicolson, The Evolution of Diplomatic Method (1954)
A well-known account, with which all historians of diplomacy need to be familiar. It is superficial but elegant and sharp, and provocative in a way beloved by those searching for good quotes.
<li> D.E. Queller, The Office of Ambassador in the Middle Ages (1967)
A great book, full of wisdom and learning.
<li> William St. Clair, Lord Elgin and the Marbles (1983)
Elgin was by no means the first or the least scrupulous British ambassador in Istanbul to arrange for the removal of priceless sculptures from the Ottoman Empire, particularly from Greece; he is however the most controversial. This is a lively, entertaining, authoritative, and beautifully written account of this episode. One ends up almost feeling sorry for him.
<li>Sarkissian, A. O. (ed), Studies in Diplomatic History and Historiography in honour of G. P. Gooch, C.H. (1962), esp. the ch. by Rohan Butler on 'Paradiplomacy'
<li>Young, John W., Twentieth Century <b>Diplomacy</b>: A case study of British practice, 1963-1976 (2008).
A first-rate work by one of the leading scholars of British diplomacy and recent diplomatic history. It is unique in so far as it shows how each of the main modes of diplomacy (resident embassies, special missions, bilateral summits, and so on) were employed by one state over one relatively short period. It is also based on the official papers which were the latest to be de-classified at the time of writing
<li>A.N. Yurdusev (ed.), Ottoman <b>Diplomacy</b> (2004)
A collection of essays on an intriguing subject, well edited by Nuri Yurdusev of the Dept. of International Relations at the Middle Eastern Technical University in Ankara. Contains two of my own pieces, so I could hardly leave

<li><a href="https://bookstore.usip.org/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=238601">Diplomat's Dictionary</a>, Charles W. Freeman, Jr., November 1, 1994, DIANE Publishing. This dictionary grew out of the experiences, readings, & reflections of a career diplomat well versed in the arts of persuasion, diplomacy, & discretion, & tested during times of crisis. An invaluable storehouse for those called upon to serve as mediator, negotiator, governmental officers or business leaders. During his many years of foreign service, the author collected many fragments of classic wisdom, cautionary advice, urbane observations, & witty insights on the art of diplomacy from numerous cultures & eras, often translating them from the original languages himself. Extensive bibliography. Index.
