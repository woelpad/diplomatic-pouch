<p>As we're close to the end of an election cycle, you might be excused for no longer remembering the biggest event of this Summer. The Olympic Games in Rio? No, seriously, does this look like a sports magazine to you? It's of course the World Diplomacy Championship 2016 in Chicago, which doubled up as this year's WeaselMoot.</p>
<p>We will mostly focus on the Top Board in this issue with some tremendous video footage and masterful commentary. But let's not forget that there are 4 preliminary rounds to whittle down the field. Remember Toby Harris, who won the WDC 2015 in Milan? As promised he crossed the pond to defend his title, but didn't make it to the top board. There's a video out there that shows one of his games, answering the one question that everyone is curious about: "How many (former) world champions does it take to tie down Toby Harris?" (Two.) Toby ended the tournament in eleventh place, just behind John Gramila, the only person with a solo who didn't make it to the top board. There's a link to the standings at the end of the tournament report by Jim O'Kelley. Fun fact: Doug Moore ended with more points than the winner, whose name is ... No, if you don't know that yet, I'll let you watch the videos first.</p>
<p>We're a bit late with this issue for various reasons. One is that I'm slashing the retreat issues for the foreseeable future to give me more time to work on other things. With Kevin no longer there to help out (I hope he continues to contribute to the Facebook page), the cutback might seem inevitable. But if you check the index of all issues, which I cleaned up a bit, you'll notice that skipping the retreat issues has been pretty common in past years. We'll enter another such period, with the next Winter issue slated for the end of January. Keep the articles coming.</p>
	<h3>Enjoy the Pouch!</h3>
