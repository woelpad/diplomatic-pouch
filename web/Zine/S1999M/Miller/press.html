<H1 align=center>Grey, Broadcast Press</H1>
<H2 align=center><i>Tim Miller</i></H2>
Hello everyone and welcome once again to my abode.  Before we get
started, I would like to thank the players and observers of the white
broadcast game <tt>Tim06</tt> and the grey broadcast game <tt>Tim02</tt>.
These games
provided a lot of good material for my last article and this one.
Everyone who was involved, including Dave Kleiman, on whose judge <tt>Tim02</tt>
was played, and Larry Richardson, whose USEF we played <tt>Tim06</tt> on, has my
deepest gratitude.
<P>
This will be the final article in my series on press (no cheering,
please).  I have already
written an introductory article, two articles on white partial press,
and one article on white broadcast press. This final article deals with
one of the most interesting types of press in judge games, grey
broadcast only.  As a quick review, grey press means that the sender of
the press is not revealed, and broadcast only press means that everyone
in the game reads every piece of press sent.  Combining these two
features leads to some very interesting and intense game play.
<P>
A grey broadcast press game has the <i>potential</i> to be very different
from a white
broadcast press game and to be much more exciting than a grey partial
game.  The reason for this is what happens when anonymity and broadcast
press are combined.  In grey broadcast games it is possible for players
to usurp each other's identities and create a large number of different
characters.  The wonderful thing about grey broadcast is that no one
knows exactly who is writing the press.  The saber-rattling German
Kaiser may in fact be the sly English PM looking to foment a
Franco-German war.  The impartial observer may be a puppet personality
of one of the players trying to subliminally influence his opposition.
One would think that this kind of excitement would carry into grey,
partial games, but from everything I've seen and heard it does not.  The
reason for this is that because players can talk privately, the usually
set up a complex system of passwords and phrases to identify themselves
to others.  Hence for all practical purpose -GP- games often revert to
simple W-P- games in all but name.
<H3>Strategies for Success</H3>
Having looked at what makes grey broadcast games so interesting, let us
now consider
what it takes to use this press medium successfully.  It is surprisingly
easy to do once one realizes the advantages and disadvantages of this
press setting.  The disadvantages are obvious.  Not only does everyone
see what you are saying, they cannot even be sure of who is saying it!
The advantages are more subtle.  They include the creation of multiple
personalities that can be used together to confuse opponents.
Furthermore, the ability exists to incite opponents into big wars
without taking any diplomatic hits yourself.  Lets take a look at these.
<P>
<ol>
<li><b>Giving yourself Multiple Personality Disorder (and liking it!)</b><br>
In grey broadcast games, you can create personalities at will.  One or
two, however, is
enough.  The key is not to create 921 different characters, but to
really develop one or two into a character <i>that the other players can trust
and that they think is a real player.</i>  This is, of course, in addition to developing your
own power's personality.  It is silly to develop a foil without having a main
character with whom you can "conduct negotiations."  Therefore, concentrate on
establishing your main character, giving only minimal attention to your
secondary personalities.
<P>
By now you may be screaming in disgust, "But Tim, if you are spending
most of your time on your main character, you don't have much of an
opportunity to develop convincing fakes." You are right in one sense,
but wrong in the other.  The optimal "fake personality" often does not
try to imitate another power, but an observer.  It is possible for
personalities to be "burned" if they fake other nations (I discus how to
do this later in the article), so this is not a good idea.  It is true
that having a personality "burned" does not really hurt, but it does not
help your cause, either.  The reason for this is that a personality is
only believable if it is established at the start of a game.  No
one will believe that a new player or observer showed up in 1906 and
started sending broadcasts (unless, of course, there is a replacement or
they got a message that a new observer signed on). Hence, once a
personality is "burned," it's gone and it is very hard to create a new
one.  In addition, you can use a wider range of diplomatic approaches
with an observer.  Powers often negotiate in set patterns (requesting
alliances, negotiating DMZ's, etc.)  Observers, though, react
differently.  They are cool and analytical whereas most players are
irascible and reactive. Rob Addison <!-- (ravgames@oxford.net) -->
pointed out a
good way to use this in the following letter:
<blockquote><i>
In grey broadcast game "Brewer", a Shift_Left game on USEF, I took
advantage of the grey setting to successfully developed two
personalities:
"Ferdinand," Archduke of Austria; and "The Wanderer",  asupposed
"observer"
who constantly made predictions and passed judgment on most moves and
all
players.
<P>
Ferdinand was calm and genteel, never promising much to his allies,
always
ready with a polished excuse if a promised support or move "fell
through."
The Wanderer was grating and crass, always ready to point out flaws in
people's plans and encourage disruptions between allies.  Most players
(maybe all of them?) in Brewer expressed surprise when the game ended
and
they found out that Ferdinand and the Wanderer were one and the same.
<P>
I think the dual persona worked because I also let the Wanderer poke fun
at
Ferdinand and even try to encourage others not to trust him.  It seemed
the
more the Wanderer tried to make Ferdinand look like a potential stabber,
it
made Ferdinand look that much more reliable when he didn't stab.  When
the
time came for Austria to produce a real stab, Turkey had been lulled
into
such a false sense of security that he walked right into it.  I ended up
in
a three-way draw with Germany and Italy.
<P>
None of this "Wanderer" business could have been carried off in a WG or
WGP
game, I don't think.  Not enough credence would have been given to the
Wanderer's grey press.  I find that grey broadcasts are largely ignored
by
players in WG games, passed over as snipes or jokes; but that <b>all</b>
messages in grey broadcast games have to be given a certain amount of
weight, no matter who the sender identifies himself as.
</i></blockquote>
Rob is very correct here, and this teaches a very important lesson about
grey broadcast games. That is to scrutinize every message, for even the
most innocent one could have a hidden agenda. Think about who the
message supports or attacks, and who gains the most benefit from this.
<p>
<li>
<b>The Big Kaboom</b><br>
As I mentioned in my article on white broadcast games, due to the
nature of broadcast
press, simple minor conflicts between powers (for example, Russia and Germany on
the Sweden issue) can turn into board consuming wars.  In grey broadcast
games, this is even more unavoidable, particularly within the first few
years, when no one knows who exactly they are dealing with.  I find that
as grey broadcast games progress, they tend to settle down a bit.  The
opening, however, is rife with forged press and threats.
<P>
As I have previously advocated, the trick for survival is to stay out
of any board-wide
fracases.  In year one I look more at the moves than the press being
sent, as it is often hard to determine what is real and what is not.  I
try to pick out the best tactician from my neighbors.  I also figure out
who has not picked up an obvious allies in the course of the first
year.  Using this information, I can then pick my first ally and my
first target.  I look for a solid tactician to ally with against a power
who does not have many friends.  The initial centers from this attack
should get me rolling.
<p> I realize that picking the best tactician from the opening moves is a tough task, so I can not be too stringent.  Basically, I look for a solid player I feel I can work with.  In addition, if there is a player among my possible targets that I fear due to aggressive play or a strong commitment to wipe me out, I would attempt to find the most natural player to ally with
against him.  In short, your immediate goal in a grey broadcast game
should be to survive into the mid-game with enough centers to be a major
player.  From there, the game should quiet down to some extent and
decisions become somewhat more straightforward, even if more critical.
<p><li>
<b>Detecting and Getting Rid of Fakers</b><br>
As I have indicated, forged press is the major problem confronting grey
broadcast players. In this section of the article, I want to put forth
some suggestions for figuring out what press from other countries is
real and what is not, and how to get rid of players faking you.  A
"faker" is defined as someone who forges press from other nations.  This
can make the conduct of diplomacy a real mess, but fortunately there are ways to detect
these characters.
As Rob Addison pointed out to me, fakers usually try to inflame
passions to their own
advantage.  As a result, their press will tend to be more hotheaded than
press a normal country will make.  For instance, if, in turn one, you
see a message saying, "Hi, this is France. Germany, let's band together
and beat up England," you can be pretty sure it's a faker.  I think a
lot of players underestimate their opponents.  Think, when you see each
press, if it's plausible that the player whose signature is at the
bottom actually sent it.  Does it help his country?  Would it make any other
powers likely to attack him?  Asking questions like these can often
point you to whether the message is real or not.
<P>
Sometimes, though, fakers act and behave just like regular powers, and when
you adopt your false persona, you should be careful to do the same.
These are harder to detect.  Indeed, one of the most fun things about
grey broadcast press is that you're never sure who is real and who is
not.  Your best guess, when confronted with two equally plausible
personalities, is to negotiate with the country they claim to represent,
not the personalities.  What I mean by this is direct proposals to the
country.  See which leader snaps on them, and decide if that's what you
would do if you were playing that power.  You can also send out a false
proposal that would hurt the power in question.  If one of the
purported leaders goes for it, you can be reasonably well convinced he's
a fake.  Note that this works well only for powers adjacent to
yourself.  For distant powers, it's best not to even try to find out at
first, and let the situation on the board reveal which personality is
the speaker of truth.
<P>
There is nothing more frustrating in a grey broadcast game than being
faked yourself.
Fortunately, there is a reasonably foolproof way to get rid of any
fakers by 1902.  The trick to this is that, while fakers may pretend to
be you, you have control over your units.  If you are stuck with a
persistent faker, find a unit that does not have to move or offer vital
support in the upcoming move, and broadcast your intention to hold it,
offer some weird support, or do something else that your faker has not
offered to do with it.  This trick works better with fleets, as you can
use them to do weird convoys.  This action will make it clear to
everyone else that you are the person moving the units, and your fakers
will disappear into the woodwork from whence they came.
<P>
Of course, even after "burning" your fakers this way, the persistent
faker will continue to "smolder."  This is done by simply adopting <i>your</i>
personality and signature and claiming to actually be you.  Some
players even prefer to play this way (use other people's signatures) right off
the bat, rather than wait to be "burned."  Both methods are bothersome to
the power being faked, and it is really up to you to decide which kind of
aggravation you want to give him first.  Why not both?
</ol>
<P>
Well, that about wraps it up for this article and this series.  It's
been fun, and I hope that
you, dear reader, have learned a trick or two about press along the
way.  Remember that good negotiations are the key to winning games, so
don't wimp out on them.  Unless you're playing against me, of course...
