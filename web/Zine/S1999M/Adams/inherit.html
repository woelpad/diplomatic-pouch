<H1 align=center>We'll Inherit The Earth</h1>
<H3 align=center><i>Richard Adams</i></H3>

This article is inspired by Richard Mulholland's article in the Fall 1998
Movement issue, which concerned replacement 
players (<a href=../../F1998M/Mulholland/oops.html><i>Oops! I Didn't See
That Coming. Now What?</i></a>). It was a good 
article, but what struck me as odd was that it is the only one I've ever seen 
on the subject. Maybe there are others somewhere in cyberspace, but I've never 
seen any.
<P>
And that's strange. Almost every game of Diplomacy -- whether e-mail or snail 
mail, but especially e-mail -- involves replacement players. I don't know if 
there any statistics on the subject, but my guess is that the average PBEM game 
has around three or four replacement players joining it during its lifespan. 
That makes dealing with replacements a very common experience, but one that's 
rarely dealt with in these pages or elsewhere. It is also how a lot of new 
players start playing their first games. So, following Richard's lead, this 
article
presents some thoughts on playing as replacement, how it differs from play
as a non-replacement player, and how to 
deal with these differences.
<P>
The title and the sub-headings in this article are all song-titles by a 
post-punk era U.S. band called The Replacements. Their spirit was very "live 
fast, die young." But the band in fact did better than most replacements, and 
lasted for nearly 11 years (that's 22 movement phases), from 1979 until they
distintegrated around 1990.
<P>
<H3>1. Learn How to Fail</H3>

I love playing as a replacement. The reason I like taking on sometimes hopeless 
positions is that it appeals to my romantic side -- like the lone gunfighter, 
taking on the bad guys, or the small band of warriors in the movie
<i>The Seven Samurai</i>.
I also play far more aggressively, on the grounds that I have less to 
lose; I'm less psychologically attached to the power since I haven't nurtured 
it from its birth in Spring 1901. (After reading Richard's original article
we exchanged 
thoughts, and he said he reacts the opposite way: he plays much more cautiously 
taking over an abandoned position than when playing from the start.)
<P>
To me, getting knocked out as a replacement player doesn't feel as bad as
being a 
starter. It's like baseball: if the starting pitcher loads the bases, does 
anyone really blame the bullpen for any ensuing runs scored?  (Well, at least
not the first two or three.)

<H3>2. Love You Till Friday</H3>

"The other players will be grateful for you keeping the game going." Oh yes. 
And the length of time of their gratitude is one of the shortest periods known 
to mankind -- often too small to be measured -- after which they resume
plotting as if 
nothing had happened. In fact, after about one or two moves, they forget that 
you were ever a replacement player, and they blame you for whatever bone-headed 
foolishness the previous player(s) had committed.
<P>
Playing in one game, as a replacement Germany, after a couple of years I 
offered a sensible alliance to Austria. He refused, because of an earlier 
stabette performed by the previous German player. When I pointed out that it 
wasn't my fault, he replied, "it doesn't matter; you Germans are all the same"! 
I thought often of that as I watched him being crushed by Italy and Russia.
<P>
(Usually Austrian players are most likely to be mad, for some reason. Has 
anyone else noticed that Austria players are often not the sharpest knives in 
the drawer? Maybe it is just me. And are they bonkers before they play Austria, 
or does the country do that to them?)

<P>
The answer is to keep reminding them that you aren't the same player that 
stabbed them back in 1902. You're new. You're different. You're older and 
wiser. And you won't make the same mistakes that fool made, that's for sure.

<H3>3. Johnny's Gonna Die</H3>

The reason it doesn't hurt so bad being killed off, of course, is that most 
replacement players take over positions that have gone sour on the original 
player. In my slim experience, players drop out or are ejected at two points 
early on. The first is at the Spring 1901 move. (These are people that sign
on to 
games and then decide they don't have time or whatever. They will go to Hell.)
<P>
The other major date is (roughly) 1904. That's when starting players who are
at risk
lose interest because the game's not looking too good for them. Alliances are 
forming against them, they have just been stabbed, they can't understand why 
everyone hates them, whatever. They cut their losses and run (like the yellow 
dogs they are).
<P>
In passing, Richard Mulholland summed it up well: "In face to face games, 
there always was a loser who got himself killed in the first couple of turns. 
Essentially these guys were just a bunch of extra neutral supply centers. In 
e-mail games you have fewer of those guys, but instead you get these guys 
who drop out early.  At least we can replace them with a decent player and 
continue."
<P>
The next main drop-out zone seems to vary by date, but roughly it's when the 
game has been pared down to three or four powers, all biggish, and the starting 
player realises he's unlikely to win or be in the draw (or has been stabbed by 
his best buddy in the game who is now going to do one of those two things). 
That's the often attractive-looking replacement positions you regularly see on 
offer: "S1908M Turkey 8/8!!". Before you make those Homer Simpson-style "Mmmm, 
Turkey" noises, you'll probably shout "D'oh!" when you see that Russia has 12 
centers, and France has 14 and has just convoyed an army to Armenia or 
something.
<P>
And of course there's the traditional just-about-to-die position, of only one 
or two centers. They come up at any time throughout the game. They are 
generally hopeless. A good way of gaining dedication points. But not one to 
lose sleep over.

<H3>4. I Bought A Headache</H3>

These positions are all different, and so are most of the methods of dealing 
with them. Taking over a 1901 power is pretty much the same as starting a game, 
except you have to be careful that the other players haven't had plenty of 
diplomacy time between them. You are still the newcomer, and it can take some 
fast talking to even find out who's ganging up with who.
<P>
But what all three positions have in common is that you are invariably the new 
kid in town. I don't know how many of you moved to a new town and changed
schools half way through as a child (I did, aged 12). Its tough, not knowing
how to react, while all 
the other kids eye you suspiciously. Being a replacement is much the same. The 
other players have fed this game and watered it from a small seed in the games 
queue, and now you come along. Especially if you upset the already established 
order:
<blockquote>
"Player X was a complete bozo, we were going to wipe him out. Then this new kid 
arrives, he's much smarter, makes some interesting proposals.... but we are 
still going to wipe him out because we've invested too much in the plan now
to change course!"
</blockquote>

This happens a lot. Player X was either:
<ol>
<li>An idiot ("Greetings from Herr General Lord Sigismund the Third of 
Australia-Hungaria!")
[I tend to find that players who use elaborate royal 
titles and olde-worlde style forms of address, even if they do get
the name of their nation right, are often nuts, and 
tend to drop out quickly. And it's a good thing too.]
<P>
<li>Hyper-aggressive ("Listen creep; touch the English Channel and you are dead 
meat, you worthless piece of dirt. P.S.: can you please support me into
Belgium?")
<P>
<li>A newbie ("Hi! Turkey says I should attack Germany like all the good
Russian players..."), or
<P>
<li>Used impenetrable English ("Hello, ally you I attack yes, now?").
</ol>
So everyone else lines up to attack Player X just to get rid of them, through 
sheer annoyance.
Player X then does the smartest thing he does in the entire game, and resigns. 
That's where you take over.

<h3>5. Stuck in the Middle</H3>

Once an alliance has been formed and set in motion, once that French fleet is 
in the Irish Sea and Germany has taken Norway, it takes on a momentum that is 
very hard to stop.
<P>
This is where Richard Mulholland's earlier article was spot on. Think where you 
are going to be if the worst happens and the two nasties keep coming at you. 
The answer may be "eliminated." So in that case, you have nothing to lose. My 
response is to go for broke and take big risks that offer big returns (as 
opposed to goofy-style moves). Cause havoc.
<P>
But this is also where Richard and I differ slightly. He thinks that when a 
replacement comes in, the game is in a fluid situation similar to the start of 
the game. I disagree. The game already has a history, a record, a past. 
Relationships have been formed and even broken. That's a very different 
position to pre-S1901M.
I say: exploit that past.
<P>In conclusion, here are my two cardinal rules
for replacement play:

<ol>
<li>
Familiarize yourself with the game's history.
Immediately call up the back moves of past 
years and old broadcast messages. Become very familiar with the record.
After all, every one of your opponents has an intimate knowledge of the
game's past, and you will be hindering yourself if you don't close this
knowledge gap as much as you possibly can.  See who stabbed who and when.
Rub that in where useful. Play dumb where that's useful.
<P>
<li>
Exploit your supposed ignorance.  That ignorance is the biggest
advantage you have, even as a one-center 
no-hoper. Play the "honest broker," the "detached, objective viewer." Encourage 
other players to re-evaluate their current positions. The mantra I repeat to 
myself and other players is: "Look At The Board." Come in and give an honest 
judgement of where you see the game going if it were truly unencumbered by
past feuds and squabbles.  Then stress to the other players that the
power or powers who you see as benefitting the most surely have this same
detached view
of the board, and that they are probably behind every single skirmish that has
so far directed the game his way.
So often replacement players come into a game where the situation is blindingly 
obvious -- one player or alliance is cruising to a win, while the others 
conduct a petty squabble (usually in the Balkans) and miss the big picture. 
Well, paint it for them and see what happens.
