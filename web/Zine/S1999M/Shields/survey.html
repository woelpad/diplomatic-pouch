<H1 align=center>A PBEM Tournament Survey</H1>
<H3 align=center><i>Matt Shields</i></h3>
A few months ago, I started searching in earnest for an organized
Diplomacy Convention in my area. Much to my dismay, I found that there
seems to be surprisingly little going on anywhere within 1000 miles of
where I live (and unfortunately, I'd have some difficulty convincing my
wife to schedule our vacations around Diplomacy Tournaments!). Around
about the same time, I was playing in a little 7 person, 7 game
mini-tournament over a judge. That experience got me seriously wondering
why it is that I've never seen anyone run a real Diplomacy tournament
over e-mail.
<P>
Well, I could imagine some logistical difficulties with it, but nothing
that couldn't be dealt with. The biggest question in my mind was exactly
what kind of a format would be most popular, and draw the most
participants. I figured that the best way to find out would be to write
up a little survey, and see what players had to say.
<P>
So far, I've been pleased with the response I've gotten to it, but I
couldn't imagine that I would have an adequate idea of what the
Diplomacy community thinks, until I'd sent it in to The Pouch!
<P>
Below you will find the survey which I have written to help evaluate the
feasibility of forming a PBEM (Play By E-Mail) Diplomacy tournament, to
be played over a judge. If you could spare five minutes to answer these ten
questions, it would be greatly appreciated.
<P>

All players should play in an equal, predetermined

All players should play in an equal, predetermined

Players who perform poorly in earlier games should be eliminated,

option given in question 6), what do you believe is the minimum
number of games that a player should be allowed to participate in before
being eliminated?

All games should be played in English
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
<input type=radio name=LanguagePreference value=PlayerList>
</td><td>
Players should inform the tournament director of the languages which
they speak, and he should attempt to group players in games together
based on the languages they are comfortable speaking.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
<input type=radio name=LanguagePreference value=NoLanguageRule>
</td><td>
Language should not be a consideration at all.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
<input type=radio name=LanguagePreference value=NoPress>
</td><td>
All games should be NoPress to eliminate this problem.

this survey, and other information regarding the formation of a PBEM
