<H3>Is It Spring Yet?</H3>
Yes, Spring has finally sprung here at The Pouch.  Just in time, too,
because the Spring <i>Retreat</i> issue is already right around the corner.
Want to know why this issue is so late?  Or does it not matter to you?
Either way, here's the long story made very short: I just plain didn't have
or make the time.
<P>
<i>"So what happened to your grand plan to get a lot of other suckers to do your
work, then, Manus?"</i> I hear you asking.  Well, I am happy to report that
I received a very respectable number of e-mails from people volunteering
to help edit The Pouch.  The reason this issue is so late has nothing to
do with those people, whom I truly appreciate.  Instead, it has to do with
the fact that I was so busy that I never even got around to telling those guys
what needed to be done and how to do it.
<p>
As a result, I decided to edit this issue myself, simply because it
was already so late and I didn't want anyone else to share the blame for its
excessive tardiness.
So late it is, and the fault is entirely mine.  Sorry everyone, but better
late than never.
<H3>So Shall We Dispense With the Preliminaries?</H3>
I'll step out of the way real quick here and let you get to the articles.
I only have three things I wanted to say here, and I'll get right to them.
<H3>A Bumper Crop</H3>
I believe that you'll find the articles in this issue are well worth the
wait I put you through.  I'm especially pleased that we have not one,
not two, but <i>three</i> separate articles on the diplomatic (player
interaction) aspects of the game.  This is a topic to which I have always
wanted to provide more space in these pages, and here all of a sudden
come three excellent efforts to do so.  I'm real happy with this, and
I believe you, like me, will learn a lot about yourself and your fellow
player from the articles in this issue.
<P>
And by saying this, I certainly don't mean to slight the <i>other</i>
articles.  By my estimation, you will find yourself
well entertained, informed, and educated by <i>everything</i>
in this issue.  From top to bottom, it's a high-quality issue (in my
opinion).
<P>
In the main, this is a good thing, but every silver lining
has a cloud....
<H3>The Crops Need Rotating</H3>
To create this issue, I've harvested just about everything in the ground.
I say "just about" because I did hold back a <i>couple</i> of articles for the
next issue.  <i>[For example, you might notice that there's no Sherlock
Holmes article this issue.  Look at it as an extra month to solve Holmes's
latest puzzle.]</i>
<P>
But the sad fact is that it <i><u>is</u></i> only an extra month.  Less than a month,
in fact, because the Spring Retreat issue is slated to be published on
the 31st of May.  Less than three weeks from the date of this writing.
We'll see how close to that date it actually makes it to your screen,
but my point is that to make it a decent-sized issue will require a lot
of you to take up pen and ink (well, finger and keyboard) and write an
article for publication.  Quickly.  How about it?
<H3>Now, A Teaser</H3>
One of the articles scheduled for publication in the next issue is
something I believe everyone in the hobby will be interested in reading.
Our own Simon Szykman will hopefully be interviewing a key man at
Hasbro Interactive.  And by "key man," I mean a man
responsible for the development of Diplomacy
at its new home.
<P>
So with that to look forward to, I'll now turn you loose to....
<H3>Enjoy The Pouch!</H3>
