living at a new address.  Here it is:
<a href=mailto:judge@emwave.ee.ntu.edu.tw>judge@emwave.ee.ntu.edu.tw</a>.
Thanks for the update, Solomon!

I blush at the credit Manus gave me for my work on the Fall 1998 Movement issue.
<P>
I must admit to a certain amount of pleasure being labelled as the hero of
someone so reknowned in the hobby (and me practically a Diplomacy neophyte).
<P>
As some of you know, I'm a writer by trade, and so the editing and HTMLifying of
some articles, here and there, is well within my capabilities and expertise.
<P>
However, it would be a shame to allow Manus to get away with his claim that I
"completely took over the editing duties last time and this time." You're too
modest, Manus.
<P>
While I did lend a hand to edit some of the articles for the 'zine, everyone
should know that you and Simon did the lion's share of the work. I'm happy to
continue to help out, but I think the Dip world should know (they likely already
do) about the amount of time and effort that you put in every issue (and Simon
as well).
<P>
Still, thanks for the kudos: I remain ready to do my part for the hobby at
large--in the vain hope that it'll improve my game play <!img src=../../Common/smile.gif>.
<p>

Aw, shucks.  Well, I'll publish it, but I'll modestly stuff the praise

Hahahahah!
Perhaps we can string this into a running joke! How long do you think
we can get away with kicking our heels with our toes, and nodding at one
another before the Pouch's readers write in to tell us to shut the heck up?

While I agree that using multiple email accounts to play as several powers cheapens the game, I certainly would not support banning 'free' email accounts.  There are quite a few people who use free accounts as their primary non-work email addresses.  To ban them would be to punish a moral majority for the crimes of the immoral minority.

What has happened to Dan Shoham? Quite frankly, one of the
things that got me so interested in the hobby was his fascinating articles
in the early history of The Pouch. I'd really like to see Dan return with
his in-depth technical analyses of games.
<p>
And if not him, then <i>somebody</i> who could do that kind of job. (I'm nowhere
<i>near</i> good enough a player to do it myself, and I think Dan's gift was that
he was a very good player, <i>and</i> a reasonably good writer, and I wonder how
many of those there are out there.)

From Thaddeus Black

In your article, you wrote,
"The goal was to eliminate Russia and have A/I/T stalemate F/G.
The AIT alliance sounded good on paper, but things weren't working out
the way I thought they should."  In my opinion,
this is what the Austrian and the Italian deserve, for agreeing
to try for a useless draw, instead of playing to win. Do you disagree?
<blockquote><i>
<b>Author's response:</b>
You're missing the point of the strategy on several levels.
<P>
First, and it seems almost tautological to point it out, neither
Austria nor Italy could win if France or Germany wins first. Since F/G had a
combined 17 dots to five for Austria and four for Italy, and Germany was
playing and diploming like a genuine carebear, it would be pure fantasy to
suppose that even the most legendary of Dippers could play Austria or Italy
and beat France or Germany to 18 dots in a pure race without defending
against them. "Playing for the win," in this case, absolutely dictates,
first, arresting the progress of the F/G alliance. Imagine this exchange:
<P>
Turkey to Italy and Austria: "Why didn't you stop all of those French fleets
and German armies from crossing the stalemate lines and attacking your home
centers in 1905 when you had the chance?"
<P>
Italy and Austria reply to Turkey: "Because we were playing for the win."
<P>
Turkey: "!?!?"
<P>
Second, who said anything about a draw? I said the goal was to stop the F/G
alliance's progress with an AIT defense of the stalemate line. I did not say
the goal was a five way draw. Once F/G is stalemated by AIT, the most likely
continuation is that a new phase of diplomacy begins--one which will feature
shifting alliances, as each of the remaining powers seeks to cut a deal with
someone on the other side of the stalemate line in order to break the stasis
and seek a new route to expansion and, ultimately, victory. So we see that
this is an excellent strategy for someone "playing for victory." Referring
back to my first point, the only other option was to continue useless
infighting while F/G units poured across the stalemate lines in the upcoming
year. How likely would A/I chances for victory be in that scenario?
<P>
Third, discarding the notion of playing defense in the name of "playing for
the win" is misguided pedantery masquerading as philosophy. There is an old
addage in sports that "offense wins fans, but defense wins championships."
No strategy game in the world worthy of play, including Diplomacy, has a
path to victory which affords you the luxury of ignoring the notion of
defending against the other players. If you're falling behind, there comes a
point in any strategy contest where the only sensible strategy, if you are
to have any hope of winning, is to give your greatest effort to playing
defense.
<P>
Finally, and related to the third point, there comes a point when victory is
simply reasonably impossible. I'm not saying that the game was at that point
for Austria and Italy, but to choose an extreme example, persisting in the
notion that one must "play for victory" while a power several times one's
own size is gobbling up one's home centers is simply ludicrous. At some
point, a secondary goal to personal victory has to come into play in order
for the game to have any meaning. The most sensible secondary goal I'm aware
of is playing for a draw.
</i></blockquote>
At another point, you wrote how
"Austria was throwing himself into the battle against Russia, but he
would not discuss a split of SCs north of Sevastopol and he stubbornly
refused all of my attempts to discuss moving his army away from
Bulgaria."
The Austrian was in a tough spot, Paul.  I'd have done the same as he did.
<blockquote><i>
<b>Author's response:</b>
Really? Austria quit negotiating with me. When the going gets tough you quit
negotiating with your own allies? Somehow, I don't think that's quite what
you meant.
<P>
Perhaps you meant that you wouldn't take the tactical pressure off of the
Turk. Well, let's review the threat assessment from a tactical view. South
of you, a five SC Turkey is splitting his forces between three armies
heading into Russia and two fleets sitting bottled up in his home centers
because Italy won't let them go anywhere. North of you, an, eight center
Germany (with six armies) is slicing into Russia and preparing to rain black
armies on your head through the barren zone. Which of these powers has the
greatest potential to ruin your day?
<P>
A Dipper in a tough spot has to make tough choices. Committing units to
harrassing the borders of a weaker power trying to ally with you, while a
much more powerful threat grows virtully unchecked is not my vision of a
wise choice in the situation. I certainly don't see how allowing Germany's
unrestrained expansion into the barren zone is consistent with "playing for
the win". When mistrusting Turkey leads to certain distruction at the hands
of the German, then it's time to start trusting the Turk. That doesn't seem
like a difficult formulation to me.
</i></blockquote>
Finally, you said that the Italian's
"<i>modus operandi</i> was going to be to stab first and
ask for negotiations later.  I find this very, very interesting.
And he won, eh?
<blockquote><i>
<b>Author's response:</b>
Indeed he did. It really was an interesting display. Italy seemed to have a
knack for, first, inciting a neighboring power to attack himself then,
second, inviting the power on the back side of the attacking power to strike
at the undefended flank of the attacking power. His positon was teetering on
the brink on more than one occasion when a (from Italy's point of view)
well-timed stab of Italy's enemy from across the board saved the day.  Italy
was quite adept at arranging that sort of thing.

From Jonathan Dean
(<a href=mailto:nshade@psn.net>nshade@psn.net</a>):
</H4>
I liked your article.  Very entertaining.  I have two stories where I used
"Chainsaw Diplomacy."
<P>
The first I was playing Austria, and late in the game France decided to
breach our agreed DMZ.  It wasn't a serious violation, but I knew he was
itching to make a dash to 18.  I was busy fighting Germany at the time and
didn't really want to deal with France.  So I sent him a letter, detailing
how, earlier in the game, Italy had stabbed me by surprise, got nowhere and
was destroyed by
me.  I pointed out that I knew he was coming, and there was no way he was
going to breach my defenses with the units I thought he was deploying
against me.
<P>
He meekly retreated back to his territory.
<P>
The second example I have came when I was playing France in an EFI vs. RT game.
We had locked up
Turkey tight, and had an active defense against Russia.  Though it took
a while, we finally convinced Russia to go with a draw.  We concentrated on
him first as he had the position which could possibly breach the wall we had
<b>if</b> he fully committed himself to the task.
I felt that Turkey would be a shoo-in to accept an offer of
a part of a draw, once Russia was on board especially, as he
had no options.  Boy, I was wrong about Turkey.  His response to our first inquiry was
that he had <b>never</b> been in a draw, and never would be.  He would rather let
Russia win.  He sent that to everybody.  Russia took him up on the offer, as
with no need to guard against his ally he did have the units to breach our
line.
<P>
Unfortunately, his "chainsaw" message backfired.  We (EFI) were livid that
Turkey forced a draw into what looked to be a very long game.  As Russia
gained momentum, Turkey complained to me that we were not defending the
Juggernaut equally, while our line against Russia was collapsing, our line
against Turkey was rock solid.  I politely (barely) pointed out that Russia
didn't piss off everybody, and made it very clear that as France my last
units would be standing on the line against Turkey and by the time he could
make any gains at all, Russia would indeed win as he seemed more than
willing to allow.
<P>
He evidently didn't want to simply hand the game to Russia as he tried to
stay even (grabbing one of Russia's SCs).  I broadcast to everyone just
how profoundly upset I was that he had stabbed Russia.  I pointed out that
Turkey had said he was willing to give the game to Russia, and I had no
problem with that.  However, Turkey needed to stop pretending to be an even
partner, step down and accept the loss with at least some dignity.  This
really ticked off Russia and Turkey (mostly at each other), and the whole
Juggernaut collapsed the following season.  With barely a message, England,
Italy, and I agreed that Turkey simply had to go.
<P>
Unfortunately, the judge (USCA) crashed, never to return, so we never
actually got to take our revenge out on Turkey.
<blockquote><i>
<b>Author's response:</b>
Excellent stories! The second one is a good illustration of why chainsaw
press had better have a specific purpose. If all it does is alienate your
fellow players, you would have been better off not negotiating at all.

You are right, up to the fact that people tend to keep their own
