<H1 align=center>German Army to Silesia</h1>
<H3 align=center><i>Greg Brown</i></H3>

	German Army to Silesia.  What are you, nuts?  You upset the Russians and
miss out on the Lowlands.  You can't defend yourself against an Anglo-French
onslaught.  Anyone dumb enough to do that deserves to get
trounced.  Yes this is possibly true, but the fact of the matter is
that Germany is usually destroyed either
by English convoys or Russian armies.  And this generally happens when the
German
back is turned.  These are the great worries for a German Kaiser in
1901.  
<P>
Instead of just blindly arguing against the move, let's take a critical
look at times <i>when</I> and reasons <i>why</i> people might counsel
you not to move to Silesia in Spring 1901.
<ol>
<li><b>Friendly Russia</b><br>
Nope; move to Silesia!  Russia is lying through his teeth, even if he
doesn't know it.  There is no such
thing as a pro-German Russian.  If he grows at all he will be in Berlin quicker than you can say
Ivan the Ter....  See, told you.
<P>
<li><b>Austro-Turkish Alliance</b><br>
Nope; move to Silesia again.  Try to get your piece of the Russian action
while there's some to be gotten!  Warsaw, Sweden, and maybe
something else.  An Austrian army in Warsaw is worse than a Russian one
because it's got no where else to go but west.
<P>
<li><b>Russo-Turkish Alliance</b><br>
<i>Run</i> to Silesia!  A German army in Silesia coupled with two Austrian
builds can
hold out a long time against a juggernaut.  The bounce in Sweden will
help lots too.
<P>
<li><b>Austro-Russian Alliance</b><br>
My advice: move to Silesia.  This one has its ups and downs.
But anything that makes
for a big Russia is bad news.  A Turkey-Italy-Germany Pact is not bad and
hopefully will offset the Austrians-Russians enough to make some
gains.   You were supposed to be buddies with the Austrian anyway, what
happened?  Can he honestly think that cozying up to the Tsar is good for
the hun to his north?  Do what you can to make the Tsar a bit less cozy.
<P>
<li><b>French-English Alliance</b><br>
Doesn't matter, if they're dead set against you and you engage them in
battle, you may as well quit.
Everything you read tells you that to have hope you need to get one of them
to be your ally.  Some, but not many, tell you that they both should be trying
to befriend you, too, and if they're not, you either need a lot of help or a lot
of persuasive arguments to use against them.  What better way to ensure that
they're <i>not</i>
dead set against you than to head for Silesia, let them have their little
party in the Lowlands, and show them that you are insterested in active
cooperation and expansion from the western triangle area instead of getting
involved in long wars in the west.  If you can convince France that you are
not going to be anywhere near Burgundy and that he can have Belgium,
that is pretty good.  He may take your side.  Offer England Belgium and
St. Petersburg and no Russian fleets in the north.  Not bad.
Anglo-German alliances, I am told, favor the English.  I assume that is if
the two sides have an equal number of centers. The idea, then, is that you
will need to be the larger of the powers in any alliance arising from the
western triangle.  These extra centers would be
Russian, and how better to start getting them than by starting to move toward
them?   So if you plan to have any
hope for an English ally, you had better look to move on Warsaw before
England gets the jump on you and unbalances the alliance.
</ol>
So, you see, if you have any of the above situations in your game, a move
to Silesia, I argue, is in order.  And if you <i>don't</i> have any of the above
situations in your game, then chances are you don't have <i>any</i> situations
yet.  Everyone is still fumbling around,
sitting on their hands, claiming to "just be worried about the neutrals
for now,"
wanting to see what breaks before they pull their heads out of the sand.
Well, this means that <i>some</i>one has to break <i>some</i>thing.  Why not
you?  Move
to Silesia and I bet you will actually <i>cause</i> one of the situations
described above.  And then you're on track.  A man with a plan.
<P>
The whole idea here is to do it to Russia before he does it to you.  A small
investment of an army in Silesia and a bounce in Sweden makes life
difficult for any Tsar in any situation.  Limit your meddling westward
to Denmark and Holland.  You get your two builds and are
less of a threat to the powers in the west.  This is good.  The English
alliance can last but the Russian one is a lie from the beginning. 
Don't do it.  Russia and Germany will certainly go to war in the middle game if
Russia is a viable power.  Therefore, make that move to Silesia and
watch the nasty mail roll in.
