Why is it that so often Germany and Russia clash in the first year of the game
over Sweden?  Why do we so often see England make a play for Sweden as soon
as he can?  How can it be that in a quick sampling of the games I currently
Master, no less than six of the seven powers is in possession of Sweden?
What makes Sweden so darned popular?
<P>
The answer is obvious.  Players want their units to reach Sweden so that
they can receive the excellent Diplomatic advice offered by Agnetha,
Benny, Bj&ouml;rn, and Anni-Frid, also known as ABBA.

Oh wait.  It seems that ABBA only provided the <u>music</u> for the lyrics
you're about to read.  The words themselves seem to be merciless
replacements by Jack Rudd, a.k.a. "The Karaoke Kid."
<P>
So it must be the meatballs.

Gimme, Gimme, Gimme (An ally this autumn)</H3>
<H4>To the tune of <a href=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~wingnut/gimme!g!.htm>Gimme, Gimme, Gimme (A man after midnight)</a></H4>

Spring '03, and I'm guarding the Black Sea<br>
With my life on the run<br>
How I hate to be defending on my own...
<P>
All my armies must guard Constantinople<br>
And I'm feeling so distraught<br>
There is no-one who will give me some support.
<P>
There's not a soul out there...<br>
No-one to hear my prayer...<br>
<P>
<u>Chorus:</u><br>
Gimme, gimme, gimme an ally this autumn<br>
Won't somebody help me keep the Russian at bay?<br>
Gimme, gimme, gimme an ally this autumn<br>
In exchange I'll help you any possible way!
<P>
I can't stop them from making the breakthrough<br>
I succumb to their advance<br>
The Italian is more concerned with France.
<P>
I despair as I look around the hall<br>
And there's no-one on my side, no-one at all.
<P>
There's not a soul out there...<br>
No-one to hear my prayer...
<P>
(Repeat Chorus)

Do you know of the Lepanto?<br>
I remember long ago a game in Michaelmas Week Ten,<br>
On a Monday Night, Lepanto...<br>
You were moving into Greece while I took the Ionian Sea,<br>
We had planned to take out Turkey by the summer of 03.
<P>
We were playing the Lepanto;<br>
I had an army Tunis going through the Eastern Med.<br>
What a brilliant Lepanto,<br>
All our plans were going forward just exactly as I'd said.<br>
We took all the Balkans and I thought the Turk would soon be dead.
<P>
<u>Chorus:</u><br>
There was something in the air that night,<br>
The game was right,<br>
Lepanto!<br>
It was going well for you and me,<br>
For Italy,<br>
Lepanto!<br>
Though I never thought that we could lose, there's no regret;<br>
If I had to play the game again,<br>
I'd play the same<br>
Lepanto!
<p>
Now we've finished that Lepanto,<br>
It would all have gone so well if I had only got the chance<br>
To go through with that Lepanto...<br>
I lost half my home SC's while I pursued with that advance,<br>
I'd completely overlooked that utter backstabbing from France.
<P>
(Repeat chorus)

<H3>Back On Her Word</H3>

I have a very good friend<br>
A girl against whose play I cannot defend<br>
She has a personal style<br>
Some people like it, others tend to go wild
<P>
You hear her voice everywhere<br>
Taking the chair<br>
She's a leading lady<br>
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
<P>
<u>Chorus:</u><br>
Back on her word<br>
Stabbing your back<br>
Suddenly launching a surprise attack<br>
She's a girl with a taste for the world <br>
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)<br>
---<br>
Back on her word<br>
Winning the game<br>
Being the leader in the Hall of Fame<br>
She's extreme, if you know what I mean
<P>
Her play is what I admire<br>
She's great at tactics and a brilliant liar<br>
Each time when you try to stab<br>
She's there before you on that one-centre grab  
<P>
And then she smiles so sweet<br>
Moving her fleets<br>
Into your home centres<br>
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
<P>
(Repeat chorus.)
<P>
You hear her voice everywhere<br>
Taking the chair<br>
She's a leading lady<br>
And with no trace of hesitation she keeps going
<P>
Back on her word<br>
Breaking her way<br>
Suddenly launching a surprise attack<br>
She's a girl with a taste for the world <br>
(The world is like a playing-ground where she goes rushing)<br>
---<br>
Back on her word<br>
Winning the game<br>
Being the leader in the Hall of Fame<br>
She's extreme, if you know what I mean <br>
(She's just one of those for whom an act of mercy's simply absurd)<br>
And she goes<br>
Back on her word<br>

<H3>Stab! Stab!</H3>
<h4>To the tune of <a href=http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~wingnut/ringring.htm>Ring Ring</a></h4>

I was sitting in Trieste<br>
I was moving further west<br>
With the juggernaut I was feeling happy and trusting<br>
I had no idea at all<br>
That the moves you'd make that Fall<br>
Would give all my chances a real downwards adjusting
<P>
I could only watch in pain<br>
At your massive centre gain, oh,
<P>
"Stab! Stab!" I cried as your knife hit my back<br>
"Stab! Stab!", you suddenly switched your attack<br>
"Stab! Stab!", as you moved your fleets through the Black<br>
And I sit in my chair unhappily<br>
Wondering what made you start attacking me, so<br>
"Stab! Stab!" I cried as your knife hit my back, oh,<br>
"Stab! Stab!" I cried as your knife hit my back.
<P>
Through the game you'd been my friend<br>
But those moves caused this to end<br>
I just can't believe I could have been so badly mistaken<br>
Was it me or was it you?<br>
Tell me, are we really through?<br>
Now you've taken Ankara my whole position is breaking
<P>
And despite the press I send<br>
I just know I can't defend, so:
<p>
"Stab! Stab!" I cried as your knife hit my back<br>
"Stab! Stab!", you suddenly switched your attack<br>
"Stab! Stab!", as you moved your fleets through the Black<br>
And I sit in my chair unhappily<br>
Wondering what made you start attacking me, so<br>
"Stab! Stab!" I cried as your knife hit my back, oh,<br>
"Stab! Stab!" I cried as your knife hit my back, oh,<br>
"Stab! Stab!" I cried as your knife hit my back, oh,<br>
"Stab! Stab!" I cried as your knife hit my back.<br>
