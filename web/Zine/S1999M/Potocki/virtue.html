<H1 align=CENTER>Are You Man Enough?</H1>
<H2 align=center>The Virtues That Make A True General</H2>
<H3 align=center><i>by Tom Byku Potocki</i></H3>

<P align=justify>A number of essays have been written recently on Sun Tzu's <i>BingFa</i>
("Soldier's Methodolody," usually rendered in English as "Art of
War") in connection with the hobby of Diplomacy. Invariably the
authors zeroed in on the practical advice of technical nature. <!/P>

<P align=justify>This is not surprising. We live in a technical age that values
specific skills far more than general qualities of the spirit. We are
far more concerned with the proper response to <tt>F&nbsp;LON-ECH</tt> than with
the issues of our own innate abilities and those of our enemies. We read and
write articles which discuss <i>ad infinitum</i> various openings and
counter-openings. In this case, should we support or attack? In that
case, should we convoy or support? The gunboat game, with its total
absence of press, is the ultimate achievement of this kind of
thinking: "Never mind the interaction of personalities, never mind
the individual qualities of the general involved. Let's see what
the orders are and divine truth from there." True to this spirit,
countless statistical analyses are made to find the powers that win
(or lose) most frequently, the frequency of various openings, and the
like.<!/P>

<P align=justify>We are of course wrong.<!/P>

<P align=justify>Because the game of Diplomacy is a game reflecting above all the
personalities of the players, the technical analysis, of the sort
most useful in chess, is of limited use in this game. In chess to
ask: "what is the correct response to the opening Nf5?" is to ask a wise
question. The game is played sequentially, there are only two
players, objectives are unambiguous, only one player can win the game
and therefore the other must lose. Personalities do not count for
much. And it is always possible to calculate the one move that is
the best out of the universe of possibilities. Given enough computing
power, it is always possible to calculate the list of moves that will
draw the game.<!/P>

<P align=justify>Not so in Diplomacy. To begin with, goals vary: some players
prefer to win gloriously or die trying, others will take survival and
a draw instead of the risks involved in a solo attempt, and still others
become consumed with the need for revege, and like it that way. Secondly,
no player is
powerful enough in the first three to five game-years to be able to
fool-proof draw the game: the game uses simultaneous moves by many
players and almost any one of them can do something detrimental to
any other at any time. Third, personalities, something well beyond the pale
of exact computing, account for almost everything in the game.<!/P>

<P align=justify>And it is personalities, of course, which make for the most
interesting aspect of the game.<!/P>

<P align=justify>This is what makes Sun Tzu's little book so germane to the
topic of the game of Diplomacy. Yes, he does give practical advice
("choose your ground carefully," "treat your troops well but not too
well," etc.). He is not above noticing that knowing your openings and
being able to choose wisely between a support and a convoy is
important. But above all he focuses on the <I>personal qualities</I>
of the generals involved in the conflict: what the Chinese called <I>juei</I>,
and what the Romans
called virtue. (Interestingly, the Latin word <i>virtu</i>
also
means "manhood"; does this mean that "virtue" may also be rendered
as -- to now switch to Spanish -- <i>cajones</i>?). Sun Tzu recognizes that given equal skill levels, the
virtuous (ballsy?) man will win.<!/P>

<P align=justify>Here's a little table I have made based on all the references to
the general's character in Sun Tzu's work. It lists the virtues and
the corresponding vices.<!/P>

</center>
<!/P>

<P align=justify>I will take a few minutes to discuss each of these
characteristics.<!/P>

<H3>Courage</H3>

<P align=justify>Sun Tzu places this at the very top of the list. In his day, when
generals had to brave slings and arrows, it made a lot of sense to
put this quality there. But this quality is also needed in drawing
rooms, conference rooms, and at the diplomatic table. In order to win
the game we have to be prepared to run risks. Not wild, stupid risks:
we do not need to be reckless and without fear. Our courage must be
tempered by a healthy dose of fear (I will come back to this later).
But no matter how tempered it should be, it still must be the successful
player's <i>single greatest quality</i> at the
Diplomacy board.<!/P>

<P align=justify>We need courage for at least these purposes:<!/P>

<OL>
   <LI>In order not to despair when faced with superior forces bent
   on our destruction. When this happens, this is when we need our
   faculties the most; and to keep a clear head in such circumstances
   we need courage: "a certain insensitivity in the face of danger,"
   as Joseph Conrad calls it.</LI>
   
   <LI>To be able to stare down an opponent; sooner or later somebody
   blinks and plays a defensive rather than offensive hand; once your
   opponent does this, if you are playing courageously, he is doomed.
   This is strictly a test of courage; a game of chicken.</LI>
   
   <LI>To be able to take a small hit in order to enginneer a
   diplomatic breakthrough.</LI>
   
   <LI>To make a statement of public policy (as in "I am going to
   attack Russia now") when we are still in the running for the solo.
   (I am not talking about the, "I will attack Russia now"
   announcements which begin revenge-motivated exit-rampages. Those are
   not acts of courage, but mere dressing of suicidal cowardice).</LI>
   
   <LI>To be able to offer a just and equitable peace to a defeated
   enemy when we need him now as a friend; grand gestures to our
   former enemies require more courage than most would think.</LI>
   
   <LI>To forego an easy gain and allow another to build when that is
   required. To allow our ally to get ahead of us when that is to our
   advantage.</LI>
   
   <LI>To negotiate truthfully. Men perceived as courageous are
   believed when they threaten and believed when they spurn a threat.
   To be able to pull off a <I>non, a la</i> Charles de Gaulle, we
   must be seen as willing to stand behind our words with all our
   faculties.</LI>
   
   <LI>To fight on to the bitter end.</LI>
</OL>

<P align=justify>These are all uses of courage. There are more. At the Diplomacy
table there are no slings and arrows, but courage is still the
essential and basic virtue of a warrior.<!/P>

<H3>Consideration/Etiquette</H3>

<P align=justify>The Chinese have one word for both qualities. In the West we
distinguish them: the former includes our "true feelings" whereas the
latter is merely an outward expression with or without the said
feelings. The Chinese do not distinguish between these two qualities,
in the observation, correct in my opinion, that if your etiquette is
great people will <i>think</i> you considerate -- and that is all that
matters.<!/P>

<P align=justify>One way or another, these two, and especially etiquette, are
important. In Diplomacy no player can win by the force of arms alone.
Even in the final stages of the game we usually need somebody's help
to win. Sometimes it may even be someone we have just stabbed or defeated.
Therefore, it is exceedingly important to be courteous. When you
stab, apologize for it. It means nothing, and everybody knows it, but
it sure is a nice thing to do. When you get stabbed, tell your attacker that
you are angry, but that you do not think them worthless humanoids.
When engaged in a war, try sending sportsmanlike messages: "we are
now enemies, of course, but in real life we are friends and
comrades." You need their goodwill: you never know when it
will come in handy. You can only keep it by being courteous, so smile even as
you turn the blade in the wound or as you feel it turn inside you.<!/P>

<H3>Humility</H3>

<P align=justify>This virtue stops you from thinking too highly of yourself. Never
underestimate your enemies, never overestimate your skills, and never
allow yourself to grow complacent. Reinforce alliances <i>constantly</i>,
bury your defeated enemies repeatedly. Check and recheck. The man who
works the hardest, wins. The man who is never convinced of his own
superiority or his predetermined success is the one who works
hardest -- and he who works hardest is usually the one who wins,
too.<!/P>

<P align=justify>Humility is important in another way: it is an essential tool for
keeping our personality in balance. (See below).<!/P>

<H3>Balanced Personality</H3>

<P align=justify>Sun Tzu lists critical faults of generals: <!/P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>There are &#91;several&#93; dangerous faults that may
   affect a general: (1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction;
   (2) cowardice, which leads to capture; (3) a hasty temper, which
   can be provoked by insults; (4) a delicacy of honor which is
   sensitive to shame.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P align=justify>Note that all these qualities are qualified. "Sense of honor" is
not bad. It is the <I>delicate</I> sense of honor which is bad, not
because of the honor, but because of its delicacy. It is this delicacy
that allows an honorable general
to be easily offended. A delicate honor may lead a player to break
off all diplomatic contact with his enemy whern the first insult is
hurled at him. Because this closes  whole
realms of possibilities, such as an unexpected peace, it is a
dangerous development and can only be brought about by being too
delicate. A delicate honor may make a player feel that it is
incumbent upon him to seek revenge for a lie or a stab. Nothing can be
further from the truth: revenge is bad business and nobody makes
money in it. Yet only one whose sense of honor is <i>not</i> overdelicate can
avoid these traps. When you are insulted, rejoin with self-deprecating comments;
agree in humorous prose with your tormentor to
show that your sense of honor is not so delicate that it cannot survive the
little stuff.  You will be surprised how much higher you will stand
in the eyes of your enemy, even if he is completely and unalterably devoted
to seeing to your elimination.  And the higher esteem you can give yourself in
his eyes, the better position you are in.  The enemy succeeds if he damages
your sense of honor, for then you can be made to appear to all other players
rash, easily offended, and given to emotionalism.
<!/P>

<P align=justify>A hasty temper is bad, not because temper is bad (good generals
use anger -- theirs and their enemies -- to get at their objectives),
but because of its hastiness. That hastiness could lead us to
decisions of war and peace before all pros and cons have been
properly weighted. Anger could drive us to say something we will
later regret. Sun Tzu is not saying: "do not be angry;" rather, he is saying:
"do not be angry in a hasty manner." <!/P>

<P align=justify>As temper is only bad in excess, the same is true of fear.
And cowardice is nothing
but <I>excessive</I> fear. Fear in itself is good because it
checks recklessness. Recklessness is bad because it is
<I>excessive</I> daring.  Daring (courage), tempered by healthy fear, is
one ingredient that wins many wars. (It is important to avoid the foolhardy
assumption that daring in itself wins wars).<!/P>

<P align=justify>There are other personality traits that when strong and healthy
are good and constructive but in excessive amounts are detrimental,
and most are not mentioned by Sun Tzu. So how do we know them and
understand them? How does one develop a balanced personality? The
answer is: through humililty. Through constant application of sober
self-analysis and the careful weighing of one's actions through the
hard lense of humility. Be humble and you shall see yourself starkly.
See yourself starkly or be killed.<!/P>

<H3>Result-Orientation <i>vs.</i> Humanity</H3>

<P align=justify>Humanity, or charity, is, as Sun Tzu states repeatedly, a fatal
flaw in a ganeral. A true general, he says, does not love the people,
because it makes him weak. For example, if the local population must
be pillaged or uprooted in order to achieve certain war objectives,
the general will have no qualms doing just that. A true general takes
very good care of his army, but he does not love it. He takes care
of his army, because he needs a good fighting tool. But when the time
comes to sacrifice his men's lives for the sake of a well-executed
obfuscation, he will sacrifice them without as much as batting an eye
and he will send them to their deaths in a useless charge toward an objective he
does not even care to take. A true general is not without human
feelings, but he does not let such feelings rule him. This may not be
in line with your idea of virtue. But if it is not, then what are you
doing playing this game? Diplomacy is <b>not</b> a nice game, and if you have
not
noticed this until now, you should.  If you are racked with guilt after
taking an ally's home center, when you know that there is no way to succeed
without doing so, you can be sure that your guilt is not the quality of a
successful general.
Play dispassionately and single-mindedly toward your objectives, or you risk
not achieving them.<!/P>

<H3>Wisdom</H3>

<P align=justify>Wisdom is a virtue in any man, but a true general especially. The
way Sun Tzu uses this word, <I>wei</I>, indicates that his concern is
not with philisophical perceptions but with action. Wisdom, in short,
as he defines it, is the ability to perceive the important from the
unimportant. To see the true goals from the mickey-mouse goals.
Instead of explaining, I will illustrate: <!/P>

<P align=justify>I have recently had the pleasure of substituting for a few turns
for Thaddeo Negro, a.k.a. Thaddeus Black, as England, in a game played
on the Academy server. Before leaving, Thaddeo left me exquisite
instructions. He was a five-center England in alliance with a ten-center
Germany and he was fighting with four of those five units in the
Mediterraenean to capture Tunis. He ordered me to pursue Tunis even
though Germany was about to get more builds. When I questioned his
strategy he explained simply: <!/P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><I>When you play England, Tunis is often your eighteenth center,
   and Tunis can be hard to win when you reach seventeen.
   Therefore, I am going to lock in Tunis
   now and worry about all the SC's in-between later.</I></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P align=justify>Thaddeo went on to win the game. Not because he
locked in Tunis early, which he did, but because he eliminated early
his greatest and most dangerous opponent: Italy. By throwing all his
resources at the man who was his single most dangerous opponent and
the most exerienced player in the game, Edwin Turnage (Italy),
Thaddeo was able to get help
from Turkey and Germany, and thus to defeat Edwin still in the middle
game, long before his solo bid. Thereby, Thaddeo avoided a grand
finale confrontation against Edwin. Such a final confrontation
against Edwin could have been difficult and dicey. But having
defeated Edwin early, Thaddeo made sure that in the grand finale he
faced the other, less experienced players, and those who could not
stop him from taking the centers he considered most difficult to acquire
in an end-game solo-grab as England.<!/P>

<P align=justify>Thaddeo had clearly seen, years in advance, his most important
objectives and his most important enemy. Now, <I>that</I> is
wisdom.<!/P>
<P>
               <HR width=50%>

<P align=justify>All I intended to do in this essay is to turn the discussion away
from the technical aspects of the game and towards the central
-- human -- element of it. The essay is by no means a throrough
discussion of all qualities that make a successful general, and may
contain major omissions or errors. Nor is the essay a full analysis
of Sun Tzu's ideas of what makes a great general. All I wanted to do
is to recommend to all of you generals out there, to practice your
virtue and to use the sharp tool of humility to shine a stark light
on your own qualities, to see those qualities with wide-open eyes,
and to see what needs to be corrected.
We all need to improve our tactics, always. But what we <i>really</i> need
to do is to practice virtue, and to thus improve our gameplay by improving
our <i>selves</i>.
