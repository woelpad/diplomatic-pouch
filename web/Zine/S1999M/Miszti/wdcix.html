    The UK were mounting their strongest challenge<br>
    outside of Britain with 17 players making up the<br>
    British contingent. Three of these players were to<br>
    make the top table, including Ivan Woodward (with<br>
    the glasses on the right) grabbing third place. He<br>
    was joined on the top table by Duncan Adams (the<br>
    guy in the brown leather jacket) as well as the<br>
    erstwhile Dave Horton, who became the second <br>
    highest placed <a href="http://www.diplomacy.org.uk/englandtoo/">England Too</a> player

    8th overall. The England Too team were the <br>

    This is the obligatory 'action' shot taken during my own<br>
    most frustrating game. There were three<br>
	Yanks in the game, including<br>
    Edi Birsan (far right, with beard and glasses)<br>
    and Larry Perry (excellent shot of his back). I was <br>
    France and spent most of the game crawling all<br>
    over England (Edi Birsan). I actually finished on six<br>
    centres (my worst of the weekend) but closest to<br>
    winning. The Dutch lady, the guy with the pony tail <br>
    and the guy at the very back on the left shared top<br>
    spot with seven centres each. I apologise that I cannot<br>
    remember all their names, but I was pretty fed up.</font></td>

    battle with the UK. Leif Bergman (second from the<br>

    On a final note, it was great to see two other players from Cat23 at WorldDipCon. These
    were Stephane Degremont (France - captaining Team Europe in the Team Tournament) and Ron
    Poet (UK - who is not strictly speaking Cat 23, but is playing for Vermont Group in the
    Cat 23 Team Tournament). This was the first face to face tournament that either of them
    have been involved in and I would love comments from both of them - I think they enjoyed
    themselves immensely and Ron even managed to top a board which is a fantastic achievement
    for his first FTF tournament ! As one of the first people in the UK to start playing by
    e-mail but then moving to playing a lot of FTF conventions I have made great efforts to
    bring the two communities together. Up until now I have had more success in bringing FTF
    players to e-mail but I am delighted to see players moving in the other direction. E-Mail
    Dip is great fun but nothing can compare with playing this game the way it was designed to
    be played - FACE TO FACE.

    American buddies at the next WorldDipCon in Baltimore, Maryland next summer. For now.....
    adieu .....</font></p>
