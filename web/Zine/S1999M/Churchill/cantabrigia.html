<dt><B>The time:</B><dd>2000 AD, Start of Lent Term.
<dt><B>The story:</B><dd>Cambridge students, disdaining to visit
the Millennium Dome to celebrate the Year 2000, instead organised one university-wide
party. The alcohol consumption reached excessive levels and a few JCR Presidents
said some things they shouldn't have... The result was no ordinary bar-room
brawl, but outright declarations of war between several colleges. Those
situated geographically close to each other decided to put aside their
centuries-old differences (even Trinity and St John's) and unite under
common banners with the goal of extermination of their mutual enemies.
Many colleges (those with relatively sober Union Presidents) elected to
remain neutral in the conflicts, but the warring students plan to invade
the town centre shops and neutral colleges alike in search of plunder.

<P>The battle plans are drawn. The initial training programmes
are complete. The bazookas and war cycles are ready. And six leaders have
risen, each controlling several colleges' resources, to command the military
actions of the bloodlusting student bands... Rumours of even greater alliances
are rife. Scared first-years are hearing tales that several of the leaders
have been seen sending diplomatic envoys to each other in bids for short-term
cooperation to the extinction of others. And the gates of the warring colleges
are about to open...

Variant Rules</H3>
<dl><dd>
Cantabrigia is basically a map variant, but there are a couple
of special provinces and a couple of terminology changes to make it more
fun. (Very similar to <A HREF="http://www.ftech.net/~monark/dip/octarine">Octarine</A>
in that respect, but only with real appeal to Cambridge students rather
than hard-core Discworld fans.)
<H4><u>Terminology</u></H4>
You could theoretically play Cantabrigia as just a map variant,
and treat the map as just an archipelago of islands with thin straits or
canals between them. However, it'll become obvious on looking at the map
that the sea provinces correspond to roads in Cambridge city centre.</FONT>

<P>The basic premise is that <B>the two types of Diplomacy
unit, Armies and Fleets, have been replaced by Students and Bikes, respectively.</B>
They behave identically to in regular Dip. The main roads (those that aren't
pedestrianised) are treated as sea squares, and built-up areas or pedestrian
regions are land provinces.

<P>The justification for this is that a gang of heavily-armed
students can't cross a busy main road by themselves - it's far too dangerous.
But if a band of bicycles are in that region of the road, they can escort
or "convoy" the students from one side to the other...

<P>The names of the turns have also been modified, to fit
into Cambridge jargon, as follows: <B>The Spring, Autumn (we Brits despise
the term "Fall") and Winter phases are now known as Lent, Easter and Michaelmas,
and the game begins in Lent '00 Movement.</B>

<p>To those who object to starting in a Lent term rather
than a Michaelmas, may I point out that having Michaelmas Term as a Build
phase fits rather nicely with the influx of new students that time each
year, or in the case of disbands, the graduation (or more likely sending
down) of old veterans. And it also means the number of the year stays the
same for the five phases, which makes things more manageable.

<P>The abbreviations for Students and Bikes are (surprisingly
enough) S and B: thus the orders from King's for <NOBR>Lent '00</NOBR>
might be:</FONT>
<PRE>S King's-Clare; B Queens'-Silver St; S Catz'-King's</PRE>
...or using the map abbreviations:</FONT>
<PRE>S Kin-Cla; B Que-SIL; S Cat-Kin</PRE>
If you wish the "convoy" order may be written "e" (for "escort")
rather than "c", but we usually don't bother.

Special Provinces</u></H4>
<dl>
<dt><B><!A HREF="http://www.girton.cam.ac.uk/html/Songs_cover.html">Girton:</A></b>
<dd>This is just a neutral <U>sea</U> supply centre. (The justification
being, Girton College is so far out of the city centre (much further than
the map indicates) that you can't reach it on foot, only by bike...)
Should the occasion arise, it may be convoyed through.

<P><dt><B>The Ring Road provinces (RRA, RRC):</B>
<dd>
These are one province each, which -- due to map constraints -- appear
in two positions, the top-left and bottom-right corners. As indicated on
the map, bikes may move into them from (and out of them to) provinces
at both extremes of the board. They are street provinces (you certainly need
to cycle round the city, you can't walk it...) They may be convoyed through.
The Ring Road Anticlockwise (RRA) borders Ring Road Clockwise, East Road,
Anglia, Fitzwilliam, Churchill, Grange Road North and Wolfson
Court. The Ring Road Clockwise (RRC) borders Ring Road Anticlockwise, Girton, Fitzwilliam,
Kelsey Kerridge, St Andrew's St, and Downing.

<P><dt><B><!A HREF="http://www.robinson.cam.ac.uk/~gaec2/j00kes.htm">Coasted
Provinces</A>:</B><dd>Three provinces have two "gates"
(otherwise known as coasts in regular Dip). These are the University Library - UL(wg) and
UL(eg); the Sidgwick Site - SSi(wg) and SSi(eg); and Christ's College -
Chr(ng) and Chr(sg).
Version 1.032 saw the re-emergence of two uncoasted
provinces (those bordering two bodies of water but treated as uncoasted,
like Sweden or Denmark in standard Dip): Parker's Piece (PPc) and Kelsey
Kerridge (Kel) are assumed to have cycle paths running through them (indicated
by faint blue tracks on the map).

<P><dt><B><!A HREF="http://www.cam.net.uk/home/sail/">The River
Cam:</A></B><dd> After much discussion it was decided
to treat the Cam as bypassable (leave it off the map). Dividing it
into sea squares or coastal would put too much emphasis on Bikes rather
than Students (it's a very coastal variant as it is), and making them land
provinces or impassable would only further the isolation of Robinson Power
(already the only one really unable to reach the city centre).

<H3>Development</H3>
<dl><dd>
The idea for Cantabrigia was raised when a few members of Cambridge
University Diplomacy Society (universally known as DipSoc) suggested that
we could do with a six-player variant, and it would be fun to set it in
Cambridge. I rose to the challenge... 
<P>
A few issues were raised trying to design a fairly balanced Dip variant
with a map based on a town centre. In particular, the topic of what to do
for sea provinces took a bit of thinking about. I thought it would be
boring to make it a land-only variant, but just using the River Cam as the
only sea regions would equally not work. Finally the idea was suggested at
DipSoc that roads could be sea and built-up regions land. This was deemed
sufficiently silly to go along with - it also suggested nicely the
renaming of Fleets as Bikes and Armies as Students.
<P>
Version 1.01 appeared, and after the first face-to-face game was deemed
practically unplayable: very unbalanced, and far too many neutral centres
and neutral regions so the powers took ages to reach each other. This was
because I'd wanted to include all my favourite places in Cambridge City
Centre as separate regions on the map (rueful grin).
<P>
Radically overhauled, 1.02 appeared, and the map hasn't changed much
since. Roads between Newnham and Darwin, Peterhouse and Pembroke, and
Parker's Piece and Kelsey Kerridge vanished: despite being amongst the
busiest roads in Cambridge, I regretfully realised playability had to
triumph over realism. 
<P>
The Great Power originally named after Jesus College was renamed Sidney
after several of the evangelical Christians in the society (myself
included) started feeling that a Dip Power called Jesus ought to win every
game by default... (grin) But the number of starting centres owned by
Sidney Power varied a bit between v1.02 and 1.04. It was too weak with
just three units, but too strong with three bikes and one student. In the end
the starting unit in Jesus College was changed to another student,
somewhat reminiscent of Army Liverpool in Standard Dip (i.e. having to be
convoyed to be used for anything other than defense).
<P>
The only major issue remaining is the advantage Bikes (Fleets) have over
Students (Armies). I'm well aware that Cantabrigia 1.04 is a very coastal
variant - there are only nine provinces completely inland! It's possible
that in a future update some roads will be removed or inland provinces
added to attempt to redress this imbalance. Probably not until after my
exams, though....
<P>
The current adjacencies are more or less:
<pre>
     _T-S_      
   _- | | -_    
- R_--K |  _E -
    --_\|_-     
        P
</pre>
There are some nice symmetrical positions (notably Trinity vs. Kings over
Caius or the 4-way fight over the Market) and fun bits to play, and
generally, I think the variant is actually relatively balanced. Well...
more so than v1.01 was, anyway (grin).
<P>
Any thoughts still welcome! Is it possible for Sidney and Trinity to be at
peace? Is Pembroke too weak? I'm more than open to any comments,
suggestions, exploding sheep, or anything else you want to send me about
the variant.
