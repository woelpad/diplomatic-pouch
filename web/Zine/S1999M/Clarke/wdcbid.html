<font color="#000000">The Australian and New Zealand
Diplomacy Communities would like to invite WorldDipCon downunder in the
year 2002.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">When World Dipcon began in
1988 the original intention was for it to alternate between Europe, North
America, and Australasia. In 1992 WDCIII was held in Canberra, Australia.
However in the mid 1990's a number of prominent hobby members downunder
moved on, and the hobby went through a downturn in numbers and enthusiasm.
Consequently, the Australasian hobby has not bid for a WDC since 1992.
However, the hobby is
on a strong upsurge in Australia and New Zealand, and we feel we could
now hold a very successful and enjoyable WDC in 2002. To ensure a strong
local turnout, WDC would double as the Australian Diplomacy Championships
for that year.</font>
<p><b><font color="#400080"><font size=+1>Travelling,
meeting new people... and stabbing them.</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">We feel having a WDC in the
Southern hemisphere in 2002 would be a great experience for those from
the Northern hemisphere who make the trip. Not only would you get to play
against a whole new group of players, with different ideas and styles,
but you'd get to meet new friends, see new places, and escape a cold northern
hemisphere winter for the warmth of our summer weather. It would also be
good for the hobby here, and world-wide, forging closer ties between the
Downunder hobby and the hobby in Europe and North America.</font>
<p><b><font color="#400080"><font size=+1>Can we do
it?</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">Definitely. We've got a thriving
Tournament scene downunder, with nine established tournaments spread throughout
the year. In 1996 these tournaments attracted 65 players, in 1997 they
attracted 74 players, and last year we had 92 players attend Tournaments
affiliated to the Diplomacy Association of Australia and New Zealand (DAANZ).
The last three Australian Diplomacy Championships have each had increasing
numbers, with 36 players in Canberra this past January. The New Zealand
Championships this year will certainly have 40 + entrants. This growth
is well founded with new players now returning for repeat visits to tournaments.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">If the bid is successful,
the plan is to hold WDCXII at the Canberra RSL, in Canberra Australia over
Easter 2002. The RSL is a private club with function rooms upstairs and
a full bar and Bistro downstairs which serve very reasonably priced drinks
and meals. The Australian Diplomacy Champs have been held there regularly
over recent years in the Australia Room, which will comfortably accommodate
15 Diplomacy tables. There's a big balcony area (which measures approximately
40 feet by 20 feet) off the Australia Room, on which barbecues would be
held. Easter has been selected as the date as airfares from Europe and
the USA are off-peak then, and the timing over a holiday weekend will also
help maximize the local attendance.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">We would intend to run WDC2002
over 4 days. This format has proved very successful at the Australian Championships
where players found there was plenty of time for socializing and playing
other games back at Toad Hall where everyone stayed. Accommodation will
be available for WDC at Toad Hall, which is only 5 minutes walk from the
venue. Final details of accommodation and entry packages for intercontinental
players are yet to be worked out. When finalised they are likely to also
include transport to canberra (which doesn't have an international airport)
from Sydney and/or Melbourne. There will be large numbers of local players
travelling from those cities, and the bid team is currently working through
options such as charter buses.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">More details as to things
like this will be available as they are organised through the bid's website
at <a href="http://www.wdc2002downunder.com/">http://www.wdc2002downunder.com/</a>.</font>
<p><b><font color="#400080"><font size=+1>Stay for a
while... take in the sights...</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">With the large distance involved
in coming to a WDC downunder we imagine that a significant number of Northern
hemisphere players would want to extend their trip to include some holiday
time in Australia and/or New Zealand. There are attractions for people
with all sorts of interests downunder. Great beaches, natural wonders,
cultural attractions of world renown, sporting events, and places to "get
away from it all" and just relax in ways that are not always possible in
other parts of the world - our isolation can be a tonic. And if you're
of the outdoors adventure persuasion, we invented outdoors adventure tourism,
and there's no better place for it than in Australia and New Zealand.</font>
<p><b><font color="#400080"><font size=+1>We'd like
to see you down here.</font></font></b>
<p><font color="#000000">So, in summary, we'd love
to have you come and visit us for a summer of Diplomacy, good food, cold
drinks, and good times. We're confident of a WDC with over 60 local players,
which gives any Northern hemisphere attendees a plethora of new faces to
test their mettle against, and hopefully allow a whole new era of closer
ties amongst the world's Dippers to be forged. For those of you who want
to extend your trip downunder to take in the feast of things to do and
see while your down here we know you won't be disappointed, whatever your
interests.</font>
<p><font color="#000000">So if all that sounds appealing,
and has you thinking that a jaunt Downunder to play Diplomacy, meet new
people, have a great holiday, and see some great places, might be a bloody
good idea, then get behind us and support us in our bid for WDC2002 at
next years WDC in Baltimore. There will be a bid team from Australia and
New Zealand attending WDC X in Baltimore to present our bid in full. We
look forward to seeing you there.</font>
