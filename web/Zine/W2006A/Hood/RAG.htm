<p><i>Originally published in Diplomacy World #50, Spring 1988
<p>EDItorial note:  the debate on various forms of triple alliances has been around for
decades.  The Western Triple, AIR, RAT, and RAG were common points for argument in the
60's as well as from here in the 1980's.   David's article was in response to one by
Mark Berch on the value of the Russian-Austrian-German alliance and touches upon the
philosophy and structure of alliances that I thought would be of interest these days.</i>
<p>When I heard that March Berch was writing on the RAG Alliance, I just had to get my
two cents in.
<p>Personally, I detest triple alliances for three reasons.  First, they tend to slow
down the game and squash the diplomatic fluidity which to me is essential to a good
Diplomacy game.  This is due mainly to the shock effect of seeing three players working
together &#8212 it almost invariably forces a multinational response.  Then you've got a
boring fight for a stalemate line.
<p>Second, there is the ever-present issue of how to coordinate effectively within a
trilateral framework.  In face to face Diplomacy, it is a dead giveaway to the rest of
the board when three people go off to talk together.  And in play by mail Diplomacy (which is essentially a bilateral channel
of communication) the coordination can become even more difficult. [<i>This was
before the advent of email &#8212 Editor</i>]
<p>Now you can always just say that people can talk in Paris with each other to pass on
information &#8212 but then it's not <u>really</u> a triple, is it?  At that point it becomes
what I think it should been all along &#8212 a set of bilateral agreements which, when
taken together, form a three power front.  The essential difference is that the basis
fa√ßade of <u>multilateralism</u> isn't there to cloud people's judgment of the motives of other
powers.
<p>My third problem with Triples is the question of stabbing.  Now we can talk about
trust, playing for an alliance, etc.; but if a triple does utilize speaking in pairs,
then the third party will always suspect perfidy.  Needless to say, triple alliances
often have a problem with alliance stability, given the fact that it is usually easier
to stab in your own Heartland than to continue the triple into the other heartland.
