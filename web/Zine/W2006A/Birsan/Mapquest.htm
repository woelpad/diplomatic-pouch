<p>Over the course of 46 years of production in 7 different languages and about 25 
different editions, the Diplomacy map has seen quite a few unique spellings and 
configurations in both legal and pirated versions.  If Mapquest was to be used there 
would be quite a few interesting oddities. Here is just some of the map insanity that 
has been seen: 

<ol>
<li>Where is Monaco?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot1" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext1">[answer]</a></span>
<li>What sea zone has a supply center?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot2" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext2">[answer]</a></span>
<li>How many supply centers appear on the map?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot3" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext3">[answer]</a></span> 
<li>What is the most misspelled space?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot4" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext4">[answer]</a></span> 
<li>What language is Burgandy in?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot5" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext5">[answer]</a></span> 
<li>Galacia and Galicia both appear - which is correct?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot6" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext6">[answer]</a></span> 
<li>Ukraine, Ukrania?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot7" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext7">[answer]</a></span> 
<li>What provinces are unnamed that you CAN go to?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot8" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext8">[answer]</a></span>
<li>Where can you find two letter abbreviations on an official conference map?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot9" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext9">[answer]</a></span> 
<li>When does the Eastern Mediterranean Sea NOT connect to the Ionian Sea?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot10" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext10">[answer]</a></span> 
<li>What was the most lame excuse ever given for a misspelling by a company?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot11" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext11">[answer]</a></span> 
<li>What province was actually changed to reflect a person's name? (<i>No, it was not EDInburgh &#8212 despite 40 years of lobbying on the issue by your friendly EDItor</i>!)  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot12" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext12">[answer]</a></span> 
<li>What is the greatest original misnaming in the 1961 commercial Games Research edition?  <span class="footnote-ref"><a href="#foot13" onmouseover="this._tip = fntext13">[answer]</a></span> 
</ol>
