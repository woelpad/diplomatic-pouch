<H3>Here's the Mail</H3>
<P>Aside from a letter on Dip AIs from Jason Van Hal (creator of the formidable Albert bot)
and a quick word from our Assistant Editor, our mailbag is kind of empty this time round. Hopefully
that will change next issue &#8212 there have been a lot of good articles to comment on in recent
issues. In the meantime, don't be shy! Send us your letters!</P>

Dear Editor,
<p>What a great, simple yet effective way of evaluating the importance of different
spaces on the map! Once again, a useful concept from Chess has been successfully
adapted to the Diplomacy board. Kudos to Dorian Love!

<HR>
<H4>From <A HREF="mailto:editor@diplom.org">Jason Van Hal c/o The Editor</A>:
</H4>
<P>Edi,</P>
<P>I stumbled on the article regarding artificial intelligence and thought I would write you a quick
email.</P>
<P>I enjoyed the small exposure that DAIDE got, even though I wished DAIDE could get more in general
sometimes.</P>
<P>It was you who had actually got me very interested in Diplomacy playing the Paradox game. Since
then I have pursued 'learning' and then programming AIs for the DAIDE project. Although you want to
'kill' the machine. I have found great enjoyment in making a better machine. In fact I have a fairly
competitive AI (Albert_v1) at the moment that plays only a no-press game, but calculates optimum
moves for all players and adjudicates the turn approximately 75000 times to try an establish a good
distribution of tactical ordersets.</P>
<P>Anyways there is some progress in the AI field, and I would strongly encourage you to look
closely at DAIDE and the state of affairs. Hopefully providing even more exposure for it at the
Pouch in the future.</P>
<P>Your article's focus was on having a fill in player for PBEM games. This would be possible by
David and I would encourage you to encourage him to do so. :o) The RT community is small. And as
someone who is dedicating a lot of time to the creation of these AIs, I want the most exposure
possible, and the opportunity to let the most amount of people enjoy my efforts. :o)</P>
<P>I am focused on programming AIs, but the PBEM interface to DAIDE would need to come from
him or someone with the abilities to program that level of communications.</P>
<P>Given David's PBEM interface, I could even program my bot to read in a profile file of Allies,
Enemies and Neutral and submit orders accordingly.</P>
<P>However, the desire for build priority and removal priority is not something that would be
easily done or desireable. I think at the point someone hands over control to a bot, you really
only should tell it the current state of alliances at most. My bot would likely consider breaking
them after the first turn if in its interest anyways.</P>
<P>Sorry for the ramble. My brain is still suffering from lack of sleep from New Years parties.</P>
<P>Cheers,</P>
<P>Jason van Hal</P>
