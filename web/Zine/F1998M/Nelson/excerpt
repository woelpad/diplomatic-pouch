<p><strong>Q:&nbsp; or will you be retired, sitting in a little room
somewhere, reading through your immense collection of zines, or will you have
given up on the hobby altogether?</strong><br>

I'll probably be dead.  [Long silence]
<p>
Assuming the earthquake hasn't come, which in
California you can never be sure about, there are two
factors.  One is that I'm becoming old.  I've just turned
forty, and in the last year there've been three separate
incidents where I could have been dead in a matter of
seconds.  All circumstances beyond my control.
<p>
I'm now forty-one and I have one living
relative.  My entire generation of my family is gone, as is
the next one.  I have no children and obviously I'm not
going to have any.
<p>
I don't expect to die of AIDS, although
statistically I would be a prime candidate.  If I don't it will
be luck, good fortune, and taste.  That's a factor I have to
look at and let's be honest about this stuff; it's good to
get this down on your tape.
<p>
Bruce wrote to tell me that this year their fund
raising with the Runestone Poll ballot was for Research
Against AIDS, last year it was cancer.  Last year I wrote
Simon Billenness and Bruce.  
<p>
I said cancer is a socially acceptable disease,
the government spends millions on research for it and that
as far as I'm concerned that's fine.  I'm not going to spend
my money on cancer research, I'll spend my money
somewhere where it will do good, in the fight against
AIDS.
<p>
This year they did Research for AIDS, so I am
sure they thought that I would be wildly ecstatic.  In fact,
I wrote them and told them that I was opposed to it.  I
said that I didn't believe it was the Hobby's responsibility
to raise money for AIDS research, that's the government's
responsibility.  The money raised isn't going to amount to
enough to do any good.  It costs fifty thousand dollars to
buy a Chimpanzee for medical research.  You can't get
away with using dogs, cats, and mice for something like
this.  You've got to have something that's approximately
human.  The government is spending a billion dollars a
year now.  If they need to spend more they'll spend more.
<p>
I said that if you're going to raise money and use
it for that purpose put the money where it will do some
good.  I suggested some projects and Bruce wrote back
saying that they'd talk to Steve Hutton about it.  So I
didn't pledge any money this year.  I'm going to do
something on my own, a little different.
<p>
That fact is that the first hobby member, to my
knowledge, has died of AIDS, and I'm sure there's going
to be more.  That's something I think about a lot.
So, 1999 for me is a hope, and as far as what I
might be doing in the world of Diplomacy...probably
shuffling papers.  That's the story of my life!
