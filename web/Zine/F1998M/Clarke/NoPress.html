Further Thoughts
<br>On No-Press Opening Strategy</H1>
<H3 align=center>(The second installment of a rebuttal to
<br>M J Yatchman's "...or Why is Italy Always Such a Jerk?")</H3>
<H4 align=center><i>By Brandon Clarke</i></H4>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<p><h3>Introduction</h3>
<P>This is the third article in what has become a series reviewing NoPress
opening strategy. M J Yatchman penned the <A HREF="/DipPouch/Zine/S1998M/Yatchman/nopress.html">first
article</A> which appeared in the S1998M issue of The Pouch.
Those who read my own article know that I found myself in disagreement
with Yachtman on a few points, and from e-mail correspondences, I
realised that I wasn't
alone in my reaction. So I wrote the <A HREF="/DipPouch/Zine/S1998R/Clarke/NoPress.html">second
article</A> in the series rebutting some of his assertions. It was published
in the S1998R issue of The Pouch.
<P>Since then I've received a number of emails from people, all of whom
have basically said, "I'm glad you took the time to write something
like that. I felt the same way as you when I read the original article,
and was going to write something myself, but never got around to it. Here
are some other points you might like to consider for your second article...."
Consequently, many of the points in the following article are the result
of direct contributions from others, or from discussions I've had with
others. A list of credits follows this article.
<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<p><h3>General Comments and Feedback from Last Time</h3>
<P>One of the most insightful points raised by those who have commented
to me about the articles was this:
<UL>
<LI>
<B>"<I>Its easier to make enemies than friends in nopress, by quite a long
way, so never ever antagonise someone unnecessarily."</I></B></LI>
</UL>
I didn't actually say it in my previous article, but that is the thought
that was behind the core of my objection to M J Yatchman's original article.
This is probably the second tenet of NoPress play; it goes hand-in-hand
with my assertion that:
<UL>
<LI>
<B><I>"on a given front, the side that is able to bring the most
concentrated, co-ordinated force to bear, will win out nine times out of
ten."</I></B></LI>
</UL>
In the original article, M J Yatchman wrote:
<UL><I>The key strategic space for the opening is ENG -- the channel. Let's
get tactical: If France moves to the channel and I don't, I'm screwed! If
I bounce -- well, I was right in not trusting him! And if I succeed I have
the chance to take Brest and really do some damage! Hmmm ... seems pretty
simple -- the only way I end up on the short end is by not moving to the
channel!</I>
<P><I>Moving to the channel will likely destroy any chance of working with
France -- unless of course you bounce, in which case the mutual admiration
may allow other factors to come into play.</I>
<P><I>In summary for Spring, 1901:</I>
<P><I>F LON-ENG (a <b>must</b> move!)</I>
<BR><I>A LVP-EDI</I>
<BR><I>F EDI-NTH (or NWG)</I></UL>
A friend of mine wrote to me, and he prefers to look at it this way: "If
England moves to the channel in S1901M, not intending to attack France, then
well, he will be fighting France soon regardless of whether he wanted to
or not. France won't like it, and England can't explain that he only wants
to be there to influence Belgium, or to prevent a French fleet from being
there, so its going to be war. England moving to the Channel means war
with France, and that means England's going to be tied up focusing on
his southern flank, and not expanding terribly effectively in Scandinavia,
or into Germany...."
<P>M J Yatchman says of German openings:
<UL><I>The key space in the opening is BUR! You know France can't let you
have it, so just take the bounce and work from there. If you do happen
to end up in BUR then you have more of a quandary. But a nice quandary!</I></UL>
In response to this, my friend wrote: "...My response concerning England
moving to the Channel similarly applies to Germany moving to
Burgundy in S1901M. For Germany, all that move is certain to do is gain
you an enemy, and <B>in that bit at the start when every one is deciding
who to attack, the one thing you should not do is antagonise some one unnecessarily</B>.
In the Fall, what will France think when making builds? Germany tried to
get to BUR, or England tried to get to the Channel. So he builds two
armies or two fleets, and he has chosen his enemy. Why risk those two units
being built against you, and all for not much gain? You've got plenty to
be doing as Germany in the first two years without having to divert resources
to holding off a peeved France. Try never to give anyone a reason
to take a dislike to you as they might just use this as a reason to attack
you."
<P>My friend continued his line of thought looking at the relationship
in the early years of a NoPress game between Austria and Italy: "...Likewise,
as Austria, never build a second fleet unless you are going after Italy,
because the chances of him attacking you if you do build it are almost
certain. It does not matter the tactical importance of the unit, don't
build it unless you're attacking Italy. In a press game you can say, "look
we need it, you have no builds, and we must get extra fleets to attack
Turkey as soon as possible, otherwise we will get nowhere." You can explain
your plan in detail, and Italy may come around to your line of reasoning,
and see that it's the best thing to do. In NoPress, though,
you can't explain yourself,
so Italy sees the build, assumes the worst, and then attacks. You don't
need this enemy, so don't build that second fleet unless you're going to
go to war with Italy...you'll be going to war whether you like it or not
if you do build it."
<P>The point is, if you do something in the early years of a NoPress game
that another player <b>might</B> construe as a sign of aggression, then they
<b><i>will</i></b>
construe it that way, and you will have gained yourself an enemy. Because
you can't talk and explain in NoPress you opponents are forced to assume
the worst of your intentions, because as M J Yatchman correctly pointed
out: <I>"In no-press if you show any sign of weakness everyone will jump
on you like vultures!".</I>
<P>My friend continues his lesson, this time illustrating a classic opening
game trap for French players to avoid: "As France, never try a dummy move
to the Mediterranean before attacking England. I have seen this in both Press
and NoPress games. In Press games it's fine, as France can tell Italy it's
a feint, designed to catch England off guard. France may have a fleet in
WME, and one in GOL, and another in SPA/sc, but his intention is to lull
England into a false sense of security, and thus get England to commit
to a northern campaign, safe in the (erroneous) knowledge that he is safe
from an attack by France. Once England is overcommitted in the north, France
can then stab with a move to IRI, and a convoy to the open Liverpool. The attack
on England after this sort of dummy to the Mediterranean is almost always successful
(if timed right). But in NoPress, Italy can not be told that the move is a fake, and
that the fleets will all be gone next season. Instead, Italy is forced
to move to defend, and once his units have been redeployed away from the
potential gains in the east, Italy then naturally attacks France, as France
has given him a reason to attack... ("The fleets are moving that direction,
why should they not continue that way?" reasons Italy). So the dummy fools England,
and leads to a successful French attack on Liverpool, but it also fools
Italy, who attacks France, and who continues to attack, even after he has
realised
that it was only a dummy, and not a real attack."
<P>Among the discussions with the regular players of RealTime NoPress
games, it became apparent that many of them regard <B>F1902M and F 1902B
as the crucial phases of a NoPress game</B>. The sentiment is that events
in 1901 can be written off as mistakes, or as failed guesses due to the
nature of NoPress games, however events of 1902 are conducted with the
knowledge of what happened the previous year. Consequently, if Russia opens
with F SEV to RUM in S1901M, and then orders F RUM C A BUL-TRI in F 1902M,
this is a clear request for an alliance with Turkey. Suppose Turkey ordered
F ANK-BLA in S1901M? That can be written off by Russia (if he's feeling
confident or brave) as a reasonable opening by Turkey that's not necessarily
anti-Russian -- he could have been expecting the bounce after all, right?
However, if Turkey then orders F BLA S F RUM in the Fall, that doesn't
necessarily
indicate he's not anti-Russian either. S1902M is not likely to be much
of a guide either...moving out of BLA to CON would likely be a clear sign
that Turkey wants to accept the Russian offer of alliance, however F BLA
C (Russian) A UKR-BUD in S1902M would not be an unacceptable response
to Russia's offer in F1901M. The crunch comes in F1902M, after the openings,
offers, and counter-offers have been made. Then is the time to see where
everyone really stands. If Turkey attacks Sevastapol, then F1901M and S1902M
were just propaganda. If he now moves out of BLA and works with Russia
against Austria, an alliance has almost certainly been formed that will
likely last some time. The moves of F1902M and the builds in F1902B are
the crunch point. Very rarely will issues like this still be left unsettled
into 1903, and seldom, if ever, into 1904.
<P>In the course of rebutting M J Yatchman's assertion that there is <B>no</B>
substitute for Germany for:
<UL><I>F KIE-DEN</I>
<BR><I>A BER-KIE</I>
<BR><I>A MUN-BUR</I></UL>
I talked about the Baltic opening. Alexander K. Woo wrote to me ecstatic
that someone else had finally given credence to something he'd been on
about for several years. He said:
<UL>"Most people that looked at this idea simply dismissed it as ludicrous
and needlessly antagonizing to Russia.
<P>Now, in a game with press, Russia usually asks Germany not to move to
BAL, and I'd say yes, and find another opening. But in a NoPress
game, without any chance for such a question, it really isn't as hostile.
For one thing, when I've played this opening (which for now includes every
time I play Germany NoPress), half the time (to be precise, when no one
has opened to ENG) my Fall moves include F BAL-DEN; A KIE-HOL anyway.
<P>[However], if England and France go to war and you follow through with
bouncing Russia out of SWE, the correct move in S1902 is not to support
yourself to SWE but rather to convoy to LVN. (alongside MUN-SIL and F
KIE-DEN)."</UL>
There's an alternative for you!
<P>On with the rebuttal of M J Yatchman's original article:<B> </B>I covered
England and Germany in my article last issue. Following the format of
Yatchman's original article, I'll now move on to France...
<P>
<HR WIDTH="100%">
<H3>France</H3>
<P>M J Yatchman wrote of the French opening game in NoPress play:
<UL><I>"with the distrusting vulturous nature of no-press, France often
finds England and Germany heading to the key spaces of ENG and BUR. The
importance of these moves has been discussed from their points of view
above. These moves can easily make France the odd man out -- not a good
place to be! Given that, how can France do anything else but cover those
spaces?"</I></UL>
If you've been paying the slightest attention to the drivel I've spun so
far, it'll come as no surprise to you that I disagree, at least partially
here. France has two guaranteed builds in SPA and POR. Because of this
France can afford to be patient at the beginning of a NoPress game, and
that is a very good thing indeed.
<P>As noted above, there is a bit at the beginning of a NoPress game where
people are "deciding who they are going to attack." Because it's relatively
difficult (but not impossible) to bury the hatchet and kiss and make up
in NoPress play, these decisions have a large influence on how the game
takes shape. Such decisions tend to be relatively long-lasting too. This
is due to the inability to talk to your neighbours and agree to a truce,
and also due to the fact that players tend to commit to a front, due to
my premise "that, on a given front, the side that is able to bring the
most concentrated, co-ordinated force to bear, will win out nine times out
of ten." Once your forces are committed to a front, it often takes a lot
of time to withdraw and redeploy to another campaign, so many times players
push on as they feel they have too much invested in an attack to pull out
now.
<P>So, at the beginning, having the opportunity to sit back, not offend
anyone, and see who bites who is a luxury. Not all powers have this opportunity,
but France most definitely does. Having done so France can then either
swing into the Mediterranean, or join Germany in an attack on England, or vice-versa,
and on the rare occasion that Russia is wading into Germany you can leap
in there too and claim your share of the spoils, or attack England while
propping up Germany until you can get there in force with the builds England
hopefully provides. The point is France has options a plenty. Don't spoil
that by leaping into the Channel, and making an enemy out of England unless
you're going to go all out at England.
<P>The move to BUR is sound. Usually the support from Marseilles is unnecessary,
if you've got a sensible Germany...but that's by no means guaranteed,
and of course you've got no way to tell have you?
It's a judgment call as to how you handle that...accept the bounce if Germany
moves A MUN-BUR? Or, support yourself in there using A MAR S A PAR-BUR?
As long as Italy doesn't decide to move to PIE you can then tootle
off to SPA in the fall, while F MAO takes POR.
<P>There's a bundle of articles out there about French opening theory,
so I won't go on any further here, as I'm specifically addressing the NoPress
aspect of the subject. Take two builds in 1901, and actively try to avoid
getting three, as this will gain you enemies and galvanise England and Germany
against
you. If you want to signal your wishes for an alliance to either England
or Germany, support them into Belgium in the fall from BUR. You may want
to wait until S1902M to do this though, as showing your cards in F1901M
may cause the 'victim' to build in F1901B with a view to fighting you.
Better to keep your head down and jump onto the winning bandwagon after
the crucial year 1902.

<HR WIDTH="100%">
<p><A NAME="Russia"></A><H3>Russia</H3>
<P><I>"The no-brainer move is F STP-BOT, unless you are an idiot or want
to portray yourself as such." </I>- That's the prophet Yatchman again,
and yes, I was literally tearing my hair out at this stage. That's it.
That's the full coverage of your options for F STP/SC.
<P>I'll admit, this order is ordered almost all of the time.
Indeed, Stephen Agar, in his article
<A HREF="http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/russia1.htm">Back
to Basics -- Russia</A> first published in <i>The Spring Offensive</i> #10,
quotes figures from Richard Sharp's issue 15 of <i>The Numbers Game</i> which
show that in 1,887 UK postal games played to 1992 only 1.48% of Russian
openings did not see F STP-GOB. These were made up of F STP-FIN (0.53%), and F
STP misordered (0.95%).
However, <U>that</U>, to me, is the very reason that you should consider your
other options. For now, I will assume that those other options are F
STP-FIN, and F STP-LVN. I will talk about your other options subsequent
to a look at those two options, as they are the most likely options to
appeal in my opinion. In NoPress play you can't talk to your opponents,
and you can't explain your reasons or (more importantly when we're looking
at the openings) your intentions. So, given that people almost always order
F STP-GOB, surely F STP-FIN or F STP-LVN will stick out like a sore
thumb, and convey something to your opponents? And in an environment where
communication is very difficult, I think that immediately begs the question
"Why not order F STP-FIN/LVN?".
<P>To answer that we need to ask "What does F STP-FIN or F STP-LVN
signify to your opponents?" Mark Berch wrote a couple of interesting articles
on this subject, <A HREF="http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/lapland.htm">The
Lapland Lurch</A>, and <A HREF="http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/lunacy.htm">The
Livonian Lunacy</A>, which I think cover this issue in depth. In summary
though, moving to Finland surely is, if anything, pro-Greman? Ask yourself
what can your fleet do in GOB that it can't do in FIN? That's right! It
can move to BAL, so surely, by opening to FIN, you give Germany one less
thing to worry about don't you? The idea is that Germany realises this,
and perhaps is then more disposed to not bouncing you out of Sweden in
F1901M. Also, if you do get bounced out of Sweden in F1901M, you're in
FIN, not GOB. That's not necessarily a bad thing, as an English army that
reaches NWY in F1901M often tries to move to FIN in S1902M, and if you
get bounced again in SWE by the German, England can't sneak through to
FIN to really put pressure on STP. On the other hand, consider the message
that moving to LVN sends...? Why would you move to LVN? What can you do
in LVN that you can't do in GOB? Move to Prussia? If Germany is awake,
(s)he may realise this and order F DEN (?) to BAL... if you then order
F LVN-GOB there's some interesting play coming up as Germany may well
have lost a build over this by moving out of Denmark... Mark Berch's comments
about The Livonian Lunacy don't transfer to NoPress play as well as The
Lapland Lurch does, as the former relies on you saying to Germany "I'm
definitely going to BAL, mate...".
<P>My argument is that F STP-GOB is so typical it doesn't tell anyone
anything about your intentions, and niether does it give anything away.
That may or may not be what you want, depending on your approach to the
rest of the opening of the game. Moving to Finland is definitely worth
considering... think of the messages it conveys.
<P>There are other options with F STP too. You could order it to convoy
someone's army somewhere -- either to Switzerland to indicate you don't
want to fight (I'm thinking England or Turkey here, but maybe even Austria
or Germany), or to a third nations capital to suggest the two of you team
up against that third party. This is, possibly, a rather extreme idea.
You are giving up any hope of taking Sweden, and losing tactical position
for 1902...or are you? Obviously, if you were to pursue this opening, you're
assuming Germany is going to bounce you in Sweden (which is not an unreasonable
assumption, as that is not uncommon). If so, at the end of F1901 your fleet
would be in GOB (or even FIN if you're listening to me). Well, suppose you
opt to stay in STP in S1901M and convoy someone somewhere? In the Fall
you move to GOB, or to FIN, and you're in the same position you would have
been, but with the added bonus of having gained a phase in the 'negotiation'/alliance
offering dance that goes on at the start of a NoPress game. If you convoyed
Germany somewhere in S1901M (s)he may well support you into Sweden in S1902M
if (s)he's agreeable to your proposal. How often do you fluff around trying
to coordinate the Scandinavian theatre in the early years, desperately
trying to forge an alliance (often unsuccessfully). Trading off a low percentage
shot at Sweden in F1902M for an early offer of friendship which could be
crucial in the pivotal F1902M season could be well worth it could it not?
<P>Yatchman goes on to say (with regard to Russian openings):
<UL><I>The key strategic spaces for the opening are BLA and GAL. You already
know you are bouncing in BLA, so only GAL is undecided.</I></UL>
Right! So opening with A MOS-STP has been written
off as an option? Scandinavia is not worthy of strategic consideration?
Really!? Not surprisingly, I disagree.  But let's come back to that later.
<P>So, we <I>"already know we're bouncing in BLA"</I>!!!??? Crikey! I didn't
even know <I>I was going to BLA</I>, let alone that Turkey was too! We'll
look at <A HREF="#Turkey">Turkey's options</A> in time, but for now, let's
consider what we are going to do with F SEV... Well going to the Black
Sea IS an option...not a bad one either. I even advocate it's probably
the default move for this piece - however there are some very worthy options
available to us.
<P>First, if we order F SEV-RUM in S1901M, chances are we will make
it into RUM as Austria opening to RUM is relatively rare. (If we do bounce
we're not too badly off either.) The question is then what to do with F
RUM in F1901M? Well I think this is a perfect opportunity to convoy an
army of either Austria, Italy, or Turkey either to Switzerland or to the
capital of a third party, or to signal a 1902 attack (e.g. F RUM C A
BUL-SER, or F RUM C A SER-BUL). Of course if Turkey is in the Black Sea
one has to decide whether to cover SEV or not, but often I would think
given people are desperate to gain a friend in the early moves, many Turks
who see you not contest the BLA will reply in F1901M with a signal of their
own that friendship is on their minds too. Then again, sometimes in NoPress
play you guess wrong and suck the Kumara, don't you?
<P>Big risks, big rewards, in the Twilight Zone... (any pinball fans out
there?)
<P>Secondly, you could order F SEV S F ANK-BLA. [Remember to breathe now...in,
out..., in, out. Focus your eyes...] Seriously, though, where's the risk? If Turkey
opens to the Black sea you have an olive branch extended, and a good defensive
position should Turkey be hellbent on fighting you. If Turkey doesn't
open to the Black Sea, you've still extended the olive branch, and you're
in good position to take Rumania in the fall (if you open with A
MOS-UKR).
<P>Earlier I said: <B>"in that bit at the start when every one is deciding
who to attack, the one thing you should not do is antagonise some one unnecessarily."</B>
Couple that with my argument that alliances are harder to forge in NoPress
play, due to the difficulty of communication, and my argument <B>"that,
on a given front, the side that is able to bring the most concentrated,
co-ordinated force to bear, will win out nine times out of ten."</B> it should
be clear that if you can forge an early alliance in NoPress play you have
gained an advantage over those who are still trying to communicate and
coordinate their intentions with their neighbours.
<P>Your third option (other than F SEV-BLA) is F SEV-ARM. If you were
to try this, which can't be dressed up as anything other than strongly
anti-Turkish, then you'd have to be looking for an alliance with Austria,
so the natural accompaniment would be A WAR-UKR, A MOS-SEV. Now as
long as Turkey hasn't opened to ARM too you're poised aren't you? Poised
for what is a good question. Let us Assume there's an Austrian army in
Galicia (which is hardly the spookiest eventuality is it?). Unless there's
also an Austrian army in RUM there's not much point covering WAR. If you
opened this way, you're asking for Austrian help. If he goes for WAR, you're
screwed. You're banking on him helping you into RUM, and then fighting
the Turk with you. If Turkey opened with F ANK-CON you're in business,
as you can safely leave SEV open for a second southern fleet build to try
and help you wrest control of BLA and then push into Turkey proper and
out into the Med. A SEV-RUM, A UKR S A SEV-RUM is the go, with F
ARM-BLA. If Turkey opened with F ANK-BLA and A SMY-CON/H I might expect
a slf bounce in ANK, in which case I'd follow up with F ARM S F
BLA-ANK to (a) empty the Black Sea, and (b) fill ANK so it can't be built in.
You can then choose to play it safe, and take RUM with A UKR, or risk F
BLA-SEV and order A SEV-RUM, A UKR S A SEV-RUM. All this is rather
risky business, and shouldn't be tried by players with a heart condition,
but it is an option I wouldn't totally discount.
<P>Back to M J Yatchman's comments:
<UL><I>It makes no sense to make a full blown Scandinavian attack in no-press.
You pass up all the potential supply centers down in the Balkans and it
is just too slow going up there.</I></UL>
While I agree that a Northern offense is not always Russia's best plan,
I've seen solo victories come from it in NoPress play, and I've personally been
stopped on seventeen twice using it, and each time I believe I should have
soloed,
but I made stupid errors in the endgame -- the opening, however,
was very successful.
The downside is that you can indeed get eaten up in the south, particularly if
Turkey starts out with a Russian offensive in mind, and Austria joins in.
But then, no opening in Diplomacy, particularly NoPress Diplomacy, is guaranteed
to work, is it?
<P>I do disagree that a Northern Opening makes no sense, though. If it is the way you
plan to go you're obviously gunning for two SC's (SWE and NWY) by 1903
at the latest. If you can gain and hold RUM in the south, and make a friend
there, then very good things can happen for you from 1903 to 1907 with the
north secured. The three builds generated by a successful plan as outlined
above give you more than enough units to get your share of the Balkans
in the initial divvy up. You don't necessarily pass up anything in the
south if you have your wits about you, and I would say that it's only slow
going in the north if you're not good enough to cut it. I've watched a
player carve Scandinavia up with just two fleets as Russia. (Check out
game ALPINE on <A HREF="judge@thingy.apana.org.au">AUME</A>).
<P>To be fair to Yatchman, he did go on to write something I felt was
very astute and on target:
<UL><I>you know the Austrian is nervous about a Russian move down south,
so VIE-GAL is almost a certainty! How can he let us in to a space bordering
on two home centers? And you <i>really</i> don't want an Austrian Army in GAL!
So WAR-GAL is a must!</I></UL>
Fair enough. A VIE-GAL is the overwhelmingly popular Austrian order,
and he's right, an Austrian army in Galicia is not the most comforting
thing for a Russian after S1901M. You've got to have a pretty good reason
<B>not</B> to order A WAR-GAL.
<P>Two reasons, though, do spring to mind, and both are when you want
Austria as an ally. The
risky option of F SEV-ARM, A MOS-SEV, A WAR-UKR has already been
discussed. However, you might try A WAR S A VIE-GAL. This indicates to
Austria that you'd rather cooperate than niggle, <B>and</B> WAR is safely
covered for F1901M. This could be used either in conjunction with A
MOS-UKR, or indeed with a northern opening (A MOS-STP) with your sights
set on Germany, allowing A WAR-SIL/PRU in F1901M, perhaps with F
GOB-BAL if you're feeling really bold. One English fleet in NWY or NWG (perhaps
England is following Yatchman with LON-ENG, doing the Splits) would
give you the option
of bouncing England out of NWY in F1901M, or, if you're sure of a southern
build, A STP-FIN (for position for 1902, in which case you'd probably
have to try for SWE). Alternatively, you could then use A WAR to move
to UKR for a solid push in the Balkans in 1902.
<P>Yatchman must have really been on a high dosage of caffiene when he concluded
his Russian section, because I found myself agreeing with him twice in
one screen's worth of text! I got a bit worried at that stage...
<UL><I>I have purposefully not even brought up lines such as: WAR-SIL,
MOS-WAR -- the all out attack on Germany. While such moves are interesting,
and can be very effective in press games, they rarely are effective in
no-press. The predatory nature of no-press just makes you too vulnerable
to try such moves. For example, upon seeing these moves you are certain
to be bounced out of SWE and likely to be bounced out of RUM and lose BLA!
Without pre-negotiated alliances such risks are just fool hardy!</I></UL>
Can't disagree with that. Sound stuff.
<P>Here are Yatchman's concluding recommendations with my own comments:

may make sense. Particularly if you want Austrian friendship. Even A WAR

<TR>
<TD valign=top><I>A MOS-UKR (or STP)</I></TD>
<TD valign=top>-Agree -- good options, although I thought Yatchman had
discounted A MOS-STP
when he said: "<I>It makes no sense to make a full blown Scandinavian attack
in no-press....it is just too slow going up there."</I></TD>

<P>M J's opening salvo reads:
<UL><I>So isolated here in your corner of the world. Of course, BLA is
the space of dispute and of critical strategic importance. There is no
real alternative but to bounce, unless maybe you are (unrealistically)
hopefully optimistic about securing a Russian alliance. This is much more
likely to happen due to events out of your control (such as Italy stabbing
Austria), where both you and Russia can reap some of the harvest. So
just bounce in BLA!</I></UL>
My feeling is that this it lunacy. By now you've probably become
aware of my approach to NoPress play:
<UL>
<LI>
Commit to one front with concentrated force.</LI>
<LI>
Don't antagonise anyone unnecessarily in the opening moves when people
are deciding who to attack.</LI>
<LI>
Make an ally quickly if you can.</LI>
<LI>
Take every opportunity to signal your intentions or desires...communication
is difficult in NoPress, and anyone who can begin communicating early with
a potential ally is at an advantage.</LI>
</UL>
Yatchman tells us there is no real alternative but to bounce in the Black Sea.
That, my loyal readers (there <i>are</i> some of you still reading aren't there?),
is the best reason you have <b>not</b> to move to the Black Sea. What does F
ANK-CON say to Russia? Clearly it indicates a desire to move to the Mediterranean.
If Russia wants to be friends (which is not <i>too</i> far beyond the bounds of
possibility, is it?), (s)he just needs to keep out of the BLA and let you
move into the AEG, and a beautiful friendship may just have begun. I've
played several successful juggernaut alliances in NoPress play, and if Russia
just
keeps it's southern fleet in SEV after the initial moves, it can be invaluable
to the alliance, as Russia can use it to convoy Russian and Turkish armies
each turn as a way to signal what (s)he thinks is the best way to go in
the following turn. This can give the alliance a good advantage in coordination
over its opponents.
<P>The drawback is that if Russia <i>does</i> move F SEV-BLA then in F1901M
F CON-AEG could be risky if Russian has grand designs for snatching an
early slice of Turkey. One solution to this quandary is:
<P>S1901M: A CON-BUL, A SMY-ANK, F ANK-CON
<BR>F1901M: A BUL-CON, A ANK-CON, F CON-AEG
<P>This does, however, risk a cunning Russian
ordering F BLA S A BUL-CON!!! (gulp)
<P>Another friend wrote to me following my first rebuttal of Yatchman's
article and said, "When you get to the part on Turkey, here's a move I
just saw for the first time in the last year: Turkey orders Con-Bul, Smy-Con,
<B>Ank S Sev-Bla</B>. I was playing Russia and I immediately caught on that
Turkey wanted to be friends. In Fall 1901, I ordered F Bla-Rum (the Black Sea
was empty the rest of the game), and Austria was toast.
Turkey is safe from a Russian stab by merely ordering Ank HOLD, Con
S Bul in F01. Once Russia sails F Bla-Rum, F ANK is freed
up for Mediterranean duty."
<P>Viola!!! (No, that's not a typo - I meant viola...) How's <B><U>that</U></B>
for a "real alternative" to the bounce in BLA?
<P><I>Penfold: "Good grief, DM! What <i>will</i> we do now!?" </I>- I just found
another instance of me agreeing with the Yatchman fellow! He says:
<UL><I>"CON-BUL is an absolute no brainer here."</I></UL>
Even <U>I'm</U> struggling to come up with viable alternatives here. That
has to be a <b>must move</b>. I challenge anyone to write an article contradicting
that...go on, Manus -- keep the spirit of the Yorkshire Pudding alive!
<P><i>Phew!!!</i> Just when I was getting worried, Yatchman
comes out with:
<UL><I>The swing move here is SMY. If you want to go all out against the
Russian then SMY-ANK is the call.</I></UL>
Ummm, wouldn't A SMY-ARM be a little more "all out" against Russia? I'll
give the benefit of the doubt, and assume that was a typo that slipped
through.
<P>
Then, right when has he got back to making me question me, he comes
up with some more sound advice:
<UL><I>But given the slow developing nature of Turkey and this being no-press
there is no reasonable need for that move at this point. Move SMY-CON and
follow into BUL into the fall.</I></UL>
Good solid stuff, which is then, unfortunately, immediately undone with:
<UL><I>In summary for Spring, 1901:</I>
<P><I>F ANK-BLA</I>
<BR><I>A CON-BUL</I>
<BR><I>A SMY-CON</I>
<P><I>There is <B>no</B> substitute.</I></UL>
There is <i>always</i> a substitute. Well, except in the case
of A CON-BUL in S1901M.

<p><h3>Just To Keep You Hanging....</h3>
<P>Yatchman's article was subtitled "Why is Italy Always such a Jerk?"
Unfortunately, he never really satisfactorily answered that question in
his article.  He
wrote:
<UL><I>Well, I guess I should get back to my original motivation for writing
this brief article -- "Why is Italy always such a jerk?!" After going through
this exercise, the reason has crystalized in my mind! But alas, time is
short, so I'll have to save that for another time!</I></UL>
I was hoping the "another time" was going to be in the S1998R issue of
The Pouch, but alas, it seems the secret vision has remained locked away
in the mysterious confines of Yatchman's crystalized mind. Hopefully
my rebuttal article last issue will have stirred him to retort, and with
any luck you'll find his sage conclusion soon.
No matter, though, I faithfully promise you, my disciples, that I will conclude
this series in the next issue of The Pouch, with my comments on Austria
and Italy, some further discussion of general NoPress theory, and a conclusion
including my <b><i>own</i></b> opinion on "Why Italy is always such a jerk" --
which is <i>another</i> thing
I do tend to agree with my friend Yatchman on. Italy is often a jerk....
but all that next time.
