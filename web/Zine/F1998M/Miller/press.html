Well, I see by the writing on the wall that it’s time for me to
write my third installment to my series on press and that I need to buy
myself some drywall cleaner to get the darn writing off! For those who are
newcomers to my little series or those who have somehow forgotten the
contents of my other two articles, here’s a brief synopsis. In
<a href=/Zine/S1998M/Miller/press.html>my
introductory article</a>, I described press as the most overlooked feature of
Diplomacy and provided some basic rationale behind this. In
<a href=/Zine/S1998R/Miller/Press.html>my next
article</a>, I expanded on this philosophy and provided
some of the common mistakes newbies make when approaching press as a
concept. As a promised at the end of my last article, I am going to
devote this installment to some more advanced techniques in the
use of W-P- press.  As a sidenote for non-judge players, W-P- is the
press identification marker the judge gives to white/partial press games
in its listing. White press means that the sender of the press is
revealed and partial indicated that it can be sent to individuals
without being read by all players.  With that aside, on to the show.
<P>
The first press technique I want to describe is one enumerated
by Paul Windsor, Esq. in his article, <a href=/Zine/F1997R/Windsor/lawdip.html>"Lawyer/Diplomat,"</a> published
in the Fall 1997 Retreat issue of
this illustrious ‘Zine. I would advise everyone
to read it, as it provides an interesting perspective on press as well
as other Diplomacy matters.  The point that Mr. Windsor makes that I
would like to repeat is to always be the first to communicate.  In my
first article, I said that a player must communicate with every other
power on the board to achieve the most success, and now I am saying that
the player should also communicate early in the turn before being
contacted by the other party.  This sets the initiative and allows you
to get a firm grip on the future diplomatic discourse. Obviously France
and Turkey need not exchange messages more than once in the early years
if there is no mutual cooperation at hand, but if the message is
exchanged early in the turn it will indicate that each power takes the
communication seriously enough to make it a high (but not necessarily
top) priority.  This helps foster a trusting relationship as both powers
feel that the other is interested in their well being, which can come in
handy in a pinch if one should need support from the other at a point in
the mid-game.
<P>
Also, communicate early, but put substance in the message.  To
truly drive the discourse, you need to be the one coming up with the
brilliant revalations, and the first spring 1901 letter need not be
different.  From my observations, many players start off games by
writing an informal, “hello, let’s talk some” letter to even the
countries most important to their later progress. This style does have
certain advantages, namely it sets the tone for a later round of
cordial, non-threatening discourse between the powers.  However, it is
my belief that a Diplomacy player must seize every advantage wherever
possible, and thus this type of opening press  is inadequate.
Even the first letter between to adjacent powers should therefore
include concrete proposals, even if they are as simple as proposing a
DMZ, but not necessarily an alliance.  In fact I find it helpful
<b>not</b> to propose an alliance with the first letter, but instead sound out
the other power with proposals such as the aforementioned DMZ
suggestion.  Often I find that my proposals are met with
counterproposals and in this way a rapport can be built up, which can
lead to a fruitful alliance...till one of us decides to stab (more on
the stab in press later).
<P>
Putting substance in early communication with non-adjacent
powers is much more difficult, and I don’t think I myself have mastered
it yet. Nonetheless, I can offer a few hints, that may or may not strike
gold when applied. The first hint is not to become too involved at the
beginning.  It is good that you show interest and offer exchanges of
information, but it is unwise to try to affect alliance structures in
other theaters unless absolutely necessary for survival. I find that
once you have acquired a solid ally and have become a 5-7 center power
you can much more easily and effectively delve into the diplomacy of
other theaters. My next hint is that a player shouldspend a little more
time (but not much) conversing with powers who influence powers adjacent
to himself. For instance, Turkey should talk with Germany a little more
than with France.  The reason being to figure out German attitudes
towards Russia (talking with England also helps some here).  If
Turkey has a choice between Russian and Austrian allies, as he often
does, information about a bounce in Sweden can often be the deciding
factor.
<P>
As I have repeatedly stated throughout this little series, it is
advantageous to talk as much as possible.  Nonetheless, there is the
occasional rare time when a good player should keep his mouth shut
(temporarily).  This situation does not occur often, but it is important
to realize when it does happen.  The primary place not to talk is in a
no-press game (smile).  A time in a press game when communication is to your
disadvantage is when you want to keep a power guessing at your
intentions.  An illustration is a French player who, after the spring
1901 moves is undecided about an alliance with England or Germany, but
would prefer to ally with the Britisher, and has through some means
gotten an army into Burgundy.  Under most circumstances, I would advise
against directly stating to England that you plan to move to Munich and
hoping he will ally with you on this. The reason for this is twofold:
First, it makes you the protagonist in the whole scenario, and
this is one scenario you do not want to be the protagonist of!  Although
I previously urged players to take initiative in press, leading a 1901
attack on another power is too rash a use of this advice.  Unless your
survival depends on it, wait until the players have shown there hands
after the fall movement and builds are revealed. The second reason my
France would not tell England that a move to Munich is that the
Englishmen could go to Germany with the information and thus gain you a
hostile enemy in Berlin, who has England’s support. This is not good.
<P>
This example brings up an important press technique: know when
to evade the issue. The best way is to seize the conversation and steer
it away from any topic you feel you would rather not discuss with the
other power. However, often a topic will come up that you do not want to
discuss.  There are several reasons not to want to discuss a topic. You
do not want to lie to a friendly power, but you also do not want to give
away the fact you are about to stab another power.  Thus, if the
friendly power asks you anything that, in order to give a truthful
answer, would require you to give away important plans, it is best to
skirt the issue. Redirect the conversation with a line such as “Your
query brings up an interesting issue, which I have not fully thought
out. I will get back to you on it.” Then start talking about something
else and most powers will forget their original query.  Remember, take
control of the conversation in any way possible.  Do not try to have a
“regular” diplomatic correspondence in which you and the other
power share equally, steer the conversation towards areas that are
beneficial to you and hide any of your ulterior plots and schemes.
<P>
The third press topic I will cover in this article is press and
the stab.  This is a continuation of my second point, skirting the issue
and being purposefully uncommunicative on it. When a stab is
forthcoming, you obviously do not want to let this on to the victim, so
the above advice must take on a few twists in this situation.
Furthermore, when you stab, you are making a new enemy.  If the player
in your crosshairs is very strong, you will most likely want to
concentrate most of your strength against him.  “Surgical” one center
stabs, unless they give you a win or are performed against a very weak
power often gain nothing more than a new enemy. Thus, before stabbing,
or just after the stab, you will want to bury the hatchet against
unfriendly powers who you may have been previously attacking, and invite
nearby powers to assist you in dismantling the intended victim. Case in
point, in one of my games I played Austria and along with Turkey decided
to attack our Russian brethren.  When the time came to stab Turkey I
enlisted Russia, who regarded his downfall largely as Turkey’s fault, to
help me.  Using emotions definitely helped here and can help you.
Convince powers that they have a grudge against your target (legitimate
or not) and often they are willing to lend you support.
<P>
The other press matter relating to the stab is how to talk to
your victim in the moves right before you drop the ax.  I usually find
it is best to continue the relationship as normal (duh), but to
go ahead and propose new ideas beyond the time of the expected stab.
Again, this proposals should be specific, for if you roll around a lot
of vague proposals with little support or explanation your target will
probably become wise that you are not going to do what you say you are
going to.  This is particularly important when the intended stab victim
is an ally whom you have worked with closely.  If you have been the
dominant power in the press in the alliance (following my above advice)
you should try to avoid changing this because you know your upcoming
stab will end the alliance.  In fact, you should talk up a storm so that
your ally does not notice you slip out the knife. An effective way to do
this is try to go for a joint attack on a position that requires you
to move several units near your allies holdings, leaving him a bit (but
not too much, else he will wisen up) exposed.  If your ally goes along
with you enough , you can even decide to scrap the stab because your
future cooperation will be more valuable.
<P>
Well now that I’ve rambled on a bit let’s open up the good ol'
mailbag and see what letters my readers have been sending. Note these do
not include letters received after the S1998R issue of the ‘Pouch, so
they are only the letters in response to my introductory article. Those
who sent me letters after the spring retreat issue will see theirs
published in the next issue.
<P>
Our first letter is a request from <a href=mailto:FMDesignPE@aol.com>Paul Evans</a>, who writes:
<blockquote><i>
Hi -  Just a quick note regarding your article in the Diplomatic Pouch.  A
topic I'd like to see discussed is the forwarding of text in press.
I've heard some players complain that it shouldn't be done, as in a
face-to-face game you don't go around with tape recorders etc.  I
imagine there's a parallel with postal Diplomacy, where you could xerox
mail from one player (or forgeries thereof) and send it along to another
player.  Anyway it might be interesting to air some views on this in
future articles.  Thanks for your time and keep up the good work!
</i></blockquote>
Thanks, Paul. Okay, this is a subject that occasionally discussed on
rec.games.diplomacy, the Dip newsgroup.  I do not play postal, so I do
not know whether it is common practice for letters to be photocopied,
but I doubt it is.  I also feel that, yes, it can be done effectively, but
not very often. I try not to do it very much for one simple reason, it
hurts your credibility.  If a player unnecessarily forwards a piece of
press to me, then that means that the player is not terribly
tight-lipped, and he could very well forward some of my press that could
be damaging.  Even if the player and I are closely allied I do not like
to see press forwarded directly (paraphrasing is fine; that is, "England said
such-and-so....").  However, forwarded press shows that the player doing the
forwarding cannot be trusted with discretion.  It is a power’s
responsibility to keep some conversation (even with a bitter
enemy) secret so as to build a trustworthy relationship with other
powers.
<P>
However, there are times when forwarding press is okay; basically
when you have no other option.  An example of this would be when Italy,
Russia, and Turkey all gang up on Austria. If the Archduke can somehow
get a western power to send him a message saying that a western triple
will be forming to counter the ensuing juggernaut, then he should
forward this to Russia or Turkey (probably both) to try and get one of
them to break from the alliance. Another strategy for Austria is to
simply warn Italy of the danger of the juggernaut, and try to get him to
break away and fight Russia/Turkey.  Forwarding press in this instance
is preferable to paraphrasing as it creates more of a stir among hostile
powers and is more likely to get attention.  However, in most other I
find paraphrasing press to work just as well.
<P>
Our second (and final) letter comes from <a href=mailto:.judd@xtra.co.nz>Gwynn Judd</a>, who writes:
<blockquote><i>
I am a complete newbie but I thought you might be interested in an
occasion where a piece of press from the person playing Russia in a
recent game to me playing England helped me decide to stab him. Anyway
this is the situation:
<P>
Russia: F Bal<br>
England: F Kie, F Nor, F Nwg, F Nth<br>
France: A Ruh<br>
Austria: A Mun
<P>
Anyway, Russia and I were not enemies at this point and he sent a message
to me politely requesting that I move the fleet from the Norwegian sea
to somewhere less sensitive, and by the way would I be interested in a
bounce in Sweden? Before I could respond he sent another message to me
saying that he had changed his mind about the bounce in Sweden and in
order to stave off the French threat he would support the Fleet in Kiel.
Little did he know that France had sent a message to me saying that in
order to stave off the Russian threat he would also support the Fleet in
Kiel. That sounded fair enough to me so I managed to take Sweden from
Norway (unsupported) while France and Russia simultaneously supported
the fleet in Kiel to hold and I could have taken St Petersburg the next
year if I hadn't been so stupid (but thats what beginners' games are all
about).
<P>
I guess the moral of this story is that you can't be too careful about
what you say, even if its just a "Oh no, I've changed my mind" message.
</i></blockquote>
Gwynn: Thanks for the letter. This is indeed an interesting scenario as
Russia “said too much” to you. Still, you can’t blame him for trying to
meet his objectives (smaller English presence in northern seas) through
his press. You reaped the advantage of having two neighbors asking you
for support in their fight (always a fun situation!). You managed to put
two and two together in press terms and figure out the best tactical play
from that.
<P>
Well, that’s all the time I have for now. I thank you for your time
and ask you to send me some more letters about press. Letters received
after the spring retreats issue shall appear in my article in the fall
retreat issue. Speaking of which, it’s time to pick my next topic. As I
have spent two articles dwelling on white, partial press, I think I’ll
switch gears for next article and talk about white, broadcast only
press.
<P>
Until then best wishes and happy dipping,
<P>
