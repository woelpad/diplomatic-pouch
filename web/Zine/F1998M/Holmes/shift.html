Holmes had scarcely set foot inside the Calhamer Club, where I was
enjoying a glass of brandy at the bar with his brother, when Augustus
Fotheringay bounced across to us: "Sherlock! Mycroft! I had almost
given up hope for our game when Cuthbert left after one year.  John,
let us now continue immediately! All player's units are in supply
centres, I have yet to set sail, and your position is none too bad.
Now, with the Holmes brothers to join us, we have seven players!"
<p align=justify>
The three of us winced at the enthusiasm and false familiarity of the
aristocrat.  Trying to diffuse the situation quickly, I turned to Holmes
to explain, but, unusually, Mycroft spoke first.
<p align=justify>
"Dr Watson has been describing this singular game to me," he began. "It
is a standard game, played by all the tournament rules of the Club.  At a
glance, he says that the board looks like Spring 1901. The board has the same
unit types in the same provinces as in the starting position, and all powers
own the supply centres on which their units rest.  The neutral centres
remain neutral.  But on closer inspection, one finds that the unit colours
are wrong!  Spring of 1904 has just passed, and only three of
the powers still retain ownership of their own homeland."
<p align=justify>
"A curious situation, indeed," said my friend.  "But I am afraid I have not the
time to join your game.  Good day to you, Lord Fotheringay."  And with that,
he turned and left.
<p align=justify>
At Baker Street later that evening, I raised the subject of the game and
asked why Holmes had excused himself from what I had considered an interesting
and puzzling game, without even having so much as seen the board.
<p align=justify>
"I cannot waste my time with such contrived positions," Holmes began.
<p align=justify>
"But surely, Holmes, your brother did not tell you the full history of the
game. I
do not believe that it was even mentioned which four of the seven powers had
shuffled into each other's home centres."
<p align=justify>
"I cannot understand how people can overlook the obvious! Apart from
some trivial details, the complete history of the game should be obvious to
the trained observer and logician," said Holmes.  "For example, when I
arrived at the bar, you sat with a half-smoked cigar and a quarter-full
glass of brandy, talking with Mycroft.  Clearly, you had been at the bar
for more than fifteen minutes and so, as the game was run under strict
tournament rules -- which means fifteen minutes per turn --  you must have
defaulted: all your units must have held in Spring of 1904."
<p align=justify>
I was rather taken aback by Holmes' deduction. I was not proud of
having missed a turn, albeit prompted by the
arrival of one of the club's more noxious members and the departure of
Rev. Cuthbert Codlington.
<p align=justify>
"You will have noticed that Fotheringay's shoes were damp, yet
it had only recently begun to rain.  He could not have been at the
club for more than half an hour and so he himself could only have started
play in Fall of 1903.
<p align=justify>
"Both Mycroft and I were needed to make seven;
thus, the remaining three players and yourself must have started the game
as a foursome, with Rev. Codlington joining only for 1903.  Those were my essential observations,
and the rest is simple logic."
<p align=justify>
Acquainted as I was with the facts of the game, I was reluctant to further quiz
Holmes. His brother had also been able to reconstruct
the game, although I <i>had</i> told Mycroft which power I was playing,
which must
have helped.
<p align=justify>
How Mycroft could reconstruct the whole game is a mystery to me -- it was all
I could do to remember it! And Holmes did the same without even knowing which
power I was playing: all he knew was that Mycroft could do it, which meant
that the problem had but a single solution once the power I played was
disclosed.
