About The Diplomatic Pouch

<H3>Tsk, Tsk!</H3>
You're probably tired of me starting off each issue with an apology for
the lateness of the issue.  So I'll make it short, but I still feel it
necessary, especially since this is the latest the Pouch has ever ever been.
<P>
So I'm sorry, and I want to thank all of you who sent me all those encouraging
e-mail, saying things ranging from "Where's The Pouch?" to "I look forward
to The Pouch; when will it be out?" to "I sure hope The Pouch will be out soon"
to "Hey, hurry up with The Pouch, I'm having withdrawals!"
<P>
Knowing no one really cares about why The Pouch is late, I'm going to go
ahead and tell you anyway.  And you know why?  Because I've decided that
my longstanding rule that The Pouch will only cover 100% Diplomacy and
nothing else is a bit harsh.  I'm easing that restriction back to 99%, and
even that will only apply to me.  It's nice to be the publisher.
<p>
In brief, what I'm saying is that I've learned to appreciate one of the things
that postal 'zines have: a bit of non-Dip banter.  Well, I don't know if
appreciate is the right word, but in postal 'zines, the readership gets to
know the publisher just a little, at least. So, since the delay in
publication was due to the effects of my own real life, I'll discuss it
just a bit here.  Know that I'm doing this in the hopes that it will
be appreciated and not looked on as a waste of valuable space that could be
used for Diplomacy.  I guess that from my sparse experience with postal
zines, I get the feeling that it's actually looked forward to by some
readers.  As for The Pouch Zine, I have always stuck hard to my own
personal preference: give me Diplomacy, the whole Diplomacy, and nothing but
the Diplomacy in a Diplomacy 'zine.
<p>
So don't worry; I won't be long in discussing my real life, and then, down
below, towards the end of this article
(just to make sure you wade through the real life stuff),
I'll pop right back to the important stuff:
Diplomacy and a number of significant happenings in The Pouch world.
<H3>My Real Life (Yawn!)</H3>
So okay, why was The Pouch so late?  What is it in my real life that could
have screwed up my priorities so much?  Surprisingly, it was a number of
things (I say "surprisingly" because even I am surprised that I have so much
of a life outside Diplomacy).
<P>
First, there's the usual stuff, which I won't go into: work and health. I am
enjoying my job a lot and find myself spending off hours with it.  I had a
spat with some flu-like thing for a while, and though I only missed a
few days of work, the fact was that I was pretty much useless for around
three weeks.  Bored yet?  If not, I'll also toss in the fact that a lot of
the late night hours I usually devote to The Pouch were being used up by a
ravenous appetite for books.  I went to Las Vegas for a weekend (won a few
bucks on the Denver Broncos, while there) and took a book with me.  Beginning
then, I found
myself raging through book after book, pulling them out of my library down
in my basement, etc., etc.  Doing a lot of reading.  It's another usual thing,
but I'm doing more of it than usual.
<p>
Now the more unusual stuff.  For one thing, there's my new electronic keyboard.
I find myself spending a heck of a lot of time with it, banging out
tunes, putting together MIDI files to make the thing play songs much better
than my two-fingers worth of talent could ever do without help from the
computer.  I can tell a computer how to play pretty dang good music; I just
can't teach my hands (or
I no longer see a need to).  In fact, one major reason I'm able to get this
article written is that right now there seems to be something wrong with
the power cord for the keyboard.  Otherwise, I'd be sitting here (as I've
done countless times) staring at the screen that should be busy editing Pouch
articles, while my fingers jump around on the ivories and ebonies until the
hour is so late that I have to go to bed (well, they're not really ivories
and ebonies -- they're all plastics, of course -- but you get my point).
<p>
For another thing, my
<a href=/manus/Presidents>Dead Presidents</a>
Website has gotten popular again.  I was featured in the New York Times Magazine
(the interviews, and photo prep for which took a surprising amount of time)
and then this got picked up by some local press as well.  I'm still waiting
for the call from David Letterman, but the New York Times guys say its a
bigger possibility than ever....  A few years ago, I had a spate of
publicity for the Website -- I was on The Discovery Channel at the height
of the publicity -- and now history seems to be repeating itself.
<!--
<p>
Speaking of history, I'll now admit that by far, the biggest reason that The
Pouch is so late is the events going on in Washington, D.C.  I'm an American
history junkie -- especially presidential history -- and to have impeachment
proceedings beginning against the President, I have been literally glued
to the television and the various news sites on the Internet virtually
non-stop since mid-August.
-->
<H3>Okay, Enough of That, Now Back to the Diplomacy</H3>
Well, as everyone knows, one of the biggest events in the history of the
game itself
transpired between the publication of the last Zine issue and this one:
the gaming conglomerate Hasbro bought Avalon Hill
and the U.S. rights to Diplomacy.  We in the hobby are looking forward to
what we hope and believe will be a dramatic push of support for The Game.
Some initial contacts have been started to connect the hobby with Hasbro,
let them know about us and the agreements we have with Avalon
Hill. You can be sure that The Pouch will keep you up to date on anything
that comes down the pike.
<P>
<H3>Events In Pouchland</H3>
Despite the appearances of stagnation between issues, much has happened
here.
<P>
First, Jamie McQuinn has retired from the DP Council, after two years of
hard work maintaining the Postal Section.  Stepping in to replace him is
one of the biggest names in the postal world; indeed, in the hobby itself.
We welcome Stephen Agar to the Council, and he has already started updating
and tailoring the Postal Section.  Check it out and look for more updates
as time goes on.  Stephen has already bounced some of his plans off me, and
I think postal players are in for a treat.
<P>
For another thing, Eric Hunter has taken over control of the YARS rating
system currently used to rate PBEM players (in the E-mail section, of
course).  Thanks very much, Eric!  I am perhaps the happiest person in
the whole hobby to have you on board for this effort.
<p>
Oh, and speaking of PBEM ratings systems, the EIDRaS (Elo-inspired) system is
still in the works (right, Tony and George?)
<P>
<H3>Okay, I Think That's It</H3>
If I think of anything else, I'll cover it in the Pouch Deposits column.
So off you go, like good Pouch readers, who have been so cruelly starved for
your fix.  I'll just leave you with this piece of good news, and that is
that the <i>next</i> issue of The Pouch is due out very soon.  I can't promise
that it'll be on time, but it sure won't be <i>this</i> late!  Believe it or
not, I've already edited much of it. <i>(Any authors who expected
their contribution to appear in this issue will probably see them in the next
one.)</i>
<H3>Enjoy The Pouch!</H3>
