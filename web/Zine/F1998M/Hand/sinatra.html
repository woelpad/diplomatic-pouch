Whenever Pouch editing time comes along, I say to myself, "This will
finally be the issue when I'll have time to write something myself,
for the first time in I don't know how many issues."  Well, all my good
article ideas are still up in my head instead of on your computer
screens, though, because time has just not been kind to me.
<P align=justify>
So why, you ask, when I finally decide to force myself to write up an
article (making the issue's publication all that much later), do I
choose yet another humorous one instead of all the dang good serious ideas
I have?  Oh, I don't know.  But that's what happened.  So you'll just
have to keep waiting
to get anything from me that is meant to make you think
rather than smile.
<P align=justify>
<img hspace=5 vspace=5hspace=5 vspace=5  src=sinatraa.jpg align=left>
Because what we have here is my personal tribute to one Francis Albert
Sinatra, who passed away, of course, earlier this year.  (You may also
look at this as a tribute to Phil Hartman, whose humorous impersonation of
Sinatra is also very missed.)
<P align=justify>
I am very
happy that Sinatra lived long enough for me to come to appreciate his
talent; as someone raised on rock, I always saw Sinatra as the ultimate
square.  It's only in the last year or so that I came to realize why he
was and still is so very popular.  The guy had quite a voice.  In fact, as they say, he had <i>The</i> Voice.
<P align=justify>
I don't know if Sinatra ever played Diplomacy.  I kind of doubt it, since
some of the people he hung around with weren't exactly the diplomatic
type, if you know what I mean.  But until he cut Peter Lawford out of
<i>Robin and the Seven Hoods</i>, his rat pack included the brother-in-law
of the Kennedys, and Jack and Bobby were Diplomacy players.  So you never
know.
<P align=justify>
<img hspace=5 vspace=5hspace=5 vspace=5  src=sinatra125.jpg align=right>
And so, what you'll find below are a number of Sinatra standards, with
the words changed to portray old blue eyes not just as the Chairman of
the Board, but as the Chairman of the <i>Diplomacy</i> Board.
<P align=justify>
The idea isn't exactly original with me, though.  In a game in which I was
involved, James McKay
once broadcast some "mid-phase comments from uncle Frank," little lyrical
excerpts that show how Sinatra would have been thinking musically had he
been playing a few of the powers in the game.  
<P align=justify>
Just so you know, I butchered the songs below with one rule in mind:  none of
the title lines
(or the titles of the songs) have been changed.  Why I made this rule for
myself, I don't know, but I did.  It kept my murderous hands off of songs
like, "New York, New York" and "Young at Heart," but there are
plenty of Sinatra songs where even the title lends itself to a Diplomacy slant.
In fact, some are just <i>so</i> easy that I didn't even bother.  For example,
take the song <a href=http://www.vex.net/~buff/sinatra/cgi/arch.cgi/How_Could_You_Do_a_Thing_Like_That_to_Me><font color=cyan>"How Could You Do A Thing Like That To Me"</font></a> --
change the word "Baby" to "Turkey" and the word "Ma'am" to "Turk" and you'd
basically be done!
<P align=justify>
Here are a half dozen of the slightly less easy pickings, though.  Enjoy, and
maybe we'll see some more of these.  (Reminder -- next issue will see the
second annual <a href=../../W1997A/Various/carols.html><font color=cyan>Pouch Holiday
Song</font></a> festival.  Hopefully this puts you in the mood -- maybe you can help
by putting new words to some old carols.)

<H2 align=center>It Was A Very Good Year</H2>

<p align=center>
When I had three SC's<BR>
It was a very good year<BR>
It was a very good year<BR>
For neutral dots<BR>
And secret allies<BR>
We'd hide from the light<br>
And aim to please<br>
When I had three SC's
<p align=center>
When I had eight SC's<br>
It was a very good year<BR>
It was a very good year<BR>
For alliance play<br>
With open attacks<br>
And all those stabs in the backs<br>
And fleets in the seas<br>
When I had eight SC's
<p align=center>
When I had twelve SC's<br>
It was a very good year<br>
It was a very good year<br>
For out-and-out lies<br>
And independent thought<br>
Once my lies were bought<br>
No more allies to tease<br>
When I had twelve SC's
<p align=center>
And now their talks are short<br>
We're in the autumn of the year<BR>
And I think of my game<BR>
As vintage wine<br>
I drank it all in<br>
From oh-one to the forced win<br>
It poured sweet and clear<br>
It was a very good year

<H2 align=center>My Way</H2>

<i>
<p align=center>
And now, the end is near<br>
And I submit my final orders<br>
My friends, my friends so dear<br>
You've done me in, I'm drawn and quartered
<p align=center>
I've played a game that's short<br>
I fairly dealt with every guy-way<br>
But lies, no more than lies<br>
Were all thrown my way
<p align=center>
Supports, I've had a few<br>
But then again, too few to mention<br>
I did what I said I'd do<br>
Supported you, without redemption
<p align=center>
I planned each charted course<br>
Each careful step, so I wouldn't die-way<br>
But lies, no more than lies<br>
Were all thrown my way
<p align=center>
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew<br>
When your lies were more than I could chew<br>
But through it all, when there was doubt<br>
I ate it up, you spit me out<br>
I faced it all, and slammed the wall<br>
That you threw my way
<p align=center>
I've bounced, retreated, held,<br>
I've had my fill; my share of losing,<br>
And now, your plans have jelled<br>
You find it all so amusing
<p align=center>
To think I did all that;<br>
And may I say, not in a cry-way<br>
You rats, you dirty rats<br>
You threw lies my way
<p align=center>
For what am I now, what have I got?<br>
Except for Smyrna, I have naught<br>
You called me friend, made secret deals<br>
And kept the truth so well concealed<br>
The record shows I took the blows<br>
And went on my way

<H2 align=center>Strangers in the Night</H2>

<p align=center>
Strangers in the night,<br>
Exchanging glances<br>
Gunboat in the night<br>
What were the chances<br>
We'd be sharing dots<br>
Before the game was through
<p align=center>
Something in your eyes<br>
Was so inviting,<br>
Something in your smile<br>
Was so exciting<br>
Something in my heart<br>
Made me hope France was you
<p align=center>
Strangers in the night, two silent players<br>
Playing gunboat in the night<br>
Up to the moment<br>
When you entered Rome that Spring<br>
How you made me think:<br>
"Stalemate line's a year away<br>
I hope he knows to clear the way!" and
<p align=center>
Yes, you saw the light<br>
You moved Rome south-east<br>
I built fleet Rome to fight<br>
You convoyed to Greece<br>
It turned out so right<br>
For strangers in the night

<H2 align=center>This is the Beginning of the End</H2>

<i>
<p align=center>
This is the beginning of the end,<br>
I can read it in your press, in everything you do,<br>
And you're too weak to tell me that we're through<br>
But I can tell when hearing from you.<br>
This is the beginning of the end,<br>
You just give yourself away with everything you say,<br>
And though you never told me we will fight,<br>
Still I can read between the lines you write<br>
Why is it now when I read your plans<br>
There is some little something that they lack?<br>
What has happened to the length of your mail?<br>
And where is that little dagger for our ally's back?<br>
This is the beginning of the end,<br>
Our alliance now is gone, why let it linger on,<br>
Why lie to me and say it isn't so?<br>
'Cause now I'm ready; I'll stab you first, so<br>
That this, this is the beginning of the end

<H2 align=center>All The Way</H2>

<i>
<p align=center>
When somebody stabs you,<br>
It's no good unless he stabs you -- all the way<br>
You can let them near you,<br>
As long as you're sure they fear you -- all the way
<p align=center>
Fall or Spring, just one SC is<br>
No loss to really feel<br>
Deeper than just two SC's is<br>
How deep it goes -- if it's real
<p align=center>
When somebody trusts you<br>
It's no good unless he trusts you -- all the way<br>
Through the good or lean years<br>
And for all the inbetween years -- come what may
<p align=center>
I know where that road will lead you<br>
Even most fools would say<br>
That if you'll let me stab you<br>
It's for sure I'm gonna stab you -- all the way<br>
All the way

<H2 align=center>Something Stupid</H2>

<i>
<p align=center>
I know I stand in line,<br>Until you think you have the time<br>
To do some talking with me<br>
And when we go someplace to talk,<br>I know that by the clock<br>
You won't be allying with me
<p align=center>
And next season we drop into a quiet little place<br>
And have a word or two<br>
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid<br>
Like "I trust you"
<p align=center>
I can see it in your eyes<br>That you will tell the same old lies<br>
You told the year before<br>
And though they're all just lines to you,<br>For me they're true<br>
You never seemed so bright before
<p align=center>
I practice every turn to find some clever lines to say<br>
To hide my intentions from you<br>
But then my mind just goes, right when the deadline gets close<br>
And I'm alone with you
<p align=center>
The time is right, your lies fill my head, my army's dead<br>
And now our orders are due<br>
And then I go and spoil it all, by saying something stupid<br>
Like "I trust you"<br>
("I trust you, I trust you,...")
