<H3>Here We Go....</H3>
Just a couple of things, this time, before we get to the mail.  In the
last issue, two articles in particular inspired no letters (at least
none that I will print here), but <i>did</i> inspire action in the readership.
Tony Nichols' description of the coming Elo-inspired rating system has
got a lot of people excited, thinking that with a chess-like system,
the hobby will perhaps have "arrived."
<P>
Second, Kevin Worth mailed me to say that an e-mail game was started using
David Norman's variable length rules, presented in last issue as a way to
limit the length of a game without adversely affecting the play of the
participants.  I myself am quite taken by the scheme, and can see it
becoming the worldwide standard (wouldn't that be nice?!) method for
face-to-face tournament play.
<P>
Another thing I'd like to mention here is that Brian Kieslich's
"Black Spy" story, "A Cryptic Postcard," generated one of the highest
response totals.  So I feel like I owe it to the readership to say
that the solution to that puzzle will be published in the next issue.
I feel bad about delaying it, but well, I just plain
ran out of editing time.
<P>
And now, with no further ado, on with the letters.

I just read your article, "Cassia at the Diplomacy Table" in the latest
issue of DipPouch and I found it to be one of the best articles I've
ever read.  I played tournament chess and a lot of Diplomacy about 20
years ago, but life intervened and I have only recently come back to
the
gaming fold.  (I still don't have time for chess tournaments).  I am
playing an e-mail Dip game with some friends and I find myself using the
strategic analysis that you mentioned -- particularly the notion of
tempo.  I am playing England and am attempting to ally with Germany against
France.  France only had one build in 1901 and so is behind in development.
Austria and Turkey have started an attack against Russia. But, Italy stabbed
Vienna. The Turkish attack will get no further than Sevastopol.  My key
argument to Germany is that we can take out France before T/A can take out
Russia, and then turn eastward.  But even as we do this, I am keeping
up good relations with Austria so that I can enlist him in a stab of
Germany after 1904.
<P>
You are correct that few Dip players bother to think beyond the year.
I always try to think what effect my current move has on the "shape" of
my forces.  Pawn "shape" is another useful concept from chess,
although
it is harder to use in Dip, given the terrain differences.
<P>
Anyway, thanks for a great article.

<b>Author's response:</b>
Thank you for the compliments. Glad to hear that my thoughts hit home
with
a fellow chess player. It makes me think one or two of them might
actually
be right. <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif> I like the way you are using whole board tempo analysis in
the game you described. Sounds to me like you're on the path to victory
(but watch out for those knives!).
<P>
Funny you should mention pawn structure. I agree that it has application
to
Dip as well. I had tried to develop a section of the article on that
concept also, but I just couldn't manage the translation from chess terms
to Dip concepts. Maybe someday . . .
<P>
No time in my life for chess tournaments either, but there are many
thriving chess communities on the web. If you haven't looked for them, go
ahead and give it a try. The level of competition at many of them is very
good.

Bravo!
<P>
Easily one of the best written articles I've ever read at The Pouch.
There was one a few issues back that rivalled...something by some guy
who thought you should approach negotiations in Diplomacy like you
approach negoatiating a legal contract...
<P>
Keep up the good work, Paul. Another super effort.

I am blushing, and honored by your generous praise. Not sure what else to say.

appropriate thing to do is smile and say 'thank you.'"

Again, an excellent, well thought out article!  As a "Garden Variety
Chess player" myself, I found your insight into the similarities of the two
games quite intriguing.  I am a profesional ballroom dancer, and it was my
experience in the competitive aspects of that profession that led me to
many of the same conclusions, which I employed quite handily at WDC8!
<P>
Fascinating how good thinking lends itself to many different fields.  If
you are looking for good games, with intelligent players who don't take
things for granted, please allow me to recommend the e-zine The Old
Republic, run
by Tim Richardson, keeper of the Face-to-Face Section of The Pouch.
<P>
I would be interested in discussing this, and other Diplomacy matters at
greater length with you.  Do you play Face to Face?
<P>
Again, an excellent article.

I read with interest your article about applying chess
principles to Diplomacy.  Being a long-time, if somewhat
out-of-practice chess player myself, I noted with interest
that you repeatedly referred to Germany "sacrificing an SC."
<P>
However, since it was not really Germany's SC at the time,
I was surprised to note that you didn't mention Tartakover's
axiom that "it is always better to sacrifice your opponent's
pieces"...  <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>
<blockquote><i>[<b>From the author:</b>
Heh heh. Good point. You're right, I should have remebered that one.]
</i></blockquote>
Anyhow, thanks very much for a great article, which I'll have
to remember when I start playing in serious e-mail games...
or, at my next ftf game next weekend, assuming that the game
doesn't die around 1906 from the stabbed players whining
excessively...  You didn't mention the best way to
deal with a piece behind your lines...convince your opponent
that he'd be better off attacking a common neighbor, then
get him to allow you to disband it...it worked as
Turkey; a three-unit Italy was getting pounded by Austria
but managed to get a fleet to Syria.  Actually, it was he
that suggested that Italy stab Austria, but...and then Austria
quit because he wanted to play Starcraft...of course, his
real mistake lay in giving up Greece in 1901 without any
argument whatsoever...
<blockquote><i>[<b>From the author:</b>
An excellent point. I tried to remember to tie the tactics into diplomatic
strategies, but it can be hard to remember to do that all throughout a
tactically based article. Naturally, if the piece behind your lines can
bury you, the thing to do is look for a diplomatic solution rather than a
tactical one. That's superior advice.]

Thank you for a most enlightening and thought-provoking article, sir.
Much of
what you said has shed new light on some problems I have had in the past.
I
was pleased, however, to notice that the section regarding strong and
weak
pieces is something I had figured out on my own. There is yet hope for
this
humble beginner! May the gods of dipdom continue to smile upon you.

Hi. I've just read your excellent article "Caissa at the Diplomacy
Table" in the DipPouch.  Being a chess player myself, the mode of
thinking you describe is the natural and instinctive one for me -- what
I found really instructive was the fact that you indirectly highlight
how (most) other Dip players think, and how to approach the task of
getting one's own 'chess-like' thought patterns across to them.
Finally, also, an article that discusses <u>real</u> strategic thoughts by
means of concrete examples -- I wish I had access to this when I was a
newbie. <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>
<P>
Keep up the good work!

Father Hand, I come before you to confess my sins mortal and venial. It
has been two months since my last confession.
<P>
Today, with full knowledge, complete understanding, and willful intent, I
did use your world-class web site "The Diplomatic Pouch" for work during
work hours. I confess that I knew I needed to find out some information
on the international employment laws. I was advised to seek the websites
for the embassies of both Germany and England/Great Britain/United
Kingdom/whatever-they-call-it-now. I remembered an article reviewing the
web efforts of the Diplomacy countries ("Seven Embassies for Seven
Dippers" by Larry Peery),
so without any shame or hesitation I found the article, surfed
over to the aforementioned embassies and got what I needed, <b><i>all on
official company time.</b></i>
<P>
Yes, Father Hand, I got paid for making an official work visit to The
Pouch. I know that it isn't supposed to be like that. I know that I
should have used a search engine. I confess my trespasses, and I ask
forgiveness, promising never to use The Pouch for work again.

David's article is interesting, but I believe that in the last sentence
he exposes his own problem without knowing it.  He says in a three-way EIR
such as he describes it, Italy would be better off allying with one
or the other of ER and calling it a two-way...unless each "alliance" was
equally rewarded.  So he concludes with the decision that each "alliance"
should be equally rewarded.  By this same logic, each of the five powers
in the alliance against France in the six-way is better off declaring himself
to be his own alliance than he is to admit to being part of the anti-France
coalition.  Unless there is some set way to determine who is actually in
an alliance with other powers even if they don't want to admit it (and I
don't think this is necessarily all that easy, but maybe it is), the fact
is that all games would break down just the way they are now -- each power
in a six-way would get equal credit.  Just like Calhamer wanted.

I have been having a ball reading commentary from WDC in the latest issue and <b>boy!</b> am I glad that I decided to hold off on commentary. There are a few things people need to hear about from my games that directly affects others' comments from this issue!

(The most interesting so far is that Chris Martin has pegged me as playing Austria in one of the games he was in. I will accept the compliments graciously, but I probably <b>do</b> need to tell him that John Quarto did not play Austria the entire weekend nor was he ever in a game with Chris that weekend!)

Hello, there ... finally had the time, inclination, and address present
all at the same time to visit The Pouch ... of course, it's wonderful
for an old hand like me to bang around in here, especially after hearing
so damn much about it.

Anyway, within a few mouse clicks of hitting the Pouch, one simply must
visit the Registry to see if one is listed.
To my surprised delight, I'm already in there!  Thanks for being so on the
