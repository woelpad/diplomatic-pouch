   This summer has been full of surprises in both the world of Diplomacy and the
   world of diplomacy! And it isn't over yet.
  <p>
   By now everybody knows Hasbro has taken over the rights to Diplomacy. I
   really don't see what the big deal is all about, but then I remember when
   Avalon Hill took over the rights from GRI, and we all thought that was the
   greatest thing to happen since the invention of the TV dinner!  The bottom
   line, I think, is that the game will survive as long as somebody can make
   money off of it; and the hobby will survive as long as players care.
  <p>
   It was interesting to see the way the various Diplomacy sub-hobbies responded
   to the word that Diplomacy had been taken over by Hasbro. Each of the
   sub-hobbies went its own way, doing its own thing; and all the "movers and
   doers" as well as the few remaining true "hobby old farts" did just what you
   would expect. Again the bottom line, life goes on.
  <p>
   I managed to raise the hair on a back of a few necks by saying I was unhappy
   with the fact that none of this had been openly discussed at this year's
   Chapel Hill WDC event when the 2000 site was being selected. I felt and I
   feel that anyone putting in a bid to host the 2000 event on behalf of AH
   and/or AVALONCON should have known about what was going on at AH, and should
   have brought it out. Not knowing, to me, suggests something even worse, an
   appalling lack of preparation by the bid presenters, who have been working
   hand-in-hand with AH and their event ever since it started. But again, I'm
   not surprised, but I am going to be watching developments closely. Heh,
   heh...
  <p>
   Closer to home. My write-up in the last TDP on the Chapel Hill event got a
   few comments: Chris Martin complained I didn't write more about the games!
   Why should I?  He won the event!  That's his job. :-) But I did get a nice
   note from a young lady who enjoyed my Thomas Wolfe quotations. My ideas for a
   Diplomacy chat room got almost no response, except from Ry4an Brase, who told
   me I should do it an entirely different way. That's cool, but I have no
   interest in doing it that way, and I certainly lack the technical skills for
   doing so. So, I'll leave my Dip chat room on my home page; and let Ry4an set
   up something else for TDP.
  <p>
   In case you hadn't heard, Doug Kent, who has done a great job as publisher
   and editor of <i>Diplomacy World</i> for the last several years is turning the
   hobby's postal flagship publication over to a new publisher after he
   publishes his next and last issue. One thing I will be doing, in an effort to
   raise some money for the new publisher, is having a sale on back issues of DW
   that I published (basically 40-59), as well as some of the old Jerry Jones
   and Rod Walker issues that I have. The price is $1 per issue (to the new
   pubber) and postage (priority mail rates). For $25 to the new pubber and $10
   to me for postage you get one of each. You can request specific issues and if
   I have them, you'll get them. After this sale, I will be disposing of all the
   back issues I have. Frankly, I'm tired of looking at them. If you're
   interested send me an email. My mailing address is 6103 Malcolm Dr., San
   Diego, CA. I'll accept US postage stamps or US funds, or Belgian francs!
  <p>
   However, that doesn't mean the information in them will be lost. Since I am
   one of the very few people in the hobby that has a complete collection of DW,
   I hope to scan the early issues and the best articles from later ones, and
   post them on my Dip home page. Obviously, that is going to be a major, major
   project since DW has published over a thousand articles by several hundred
   authors over the last 24 years.  Yes, next January marks DW's 25th
   anniversary!
  <p>
   But before I get to that there is the matter of the World DipCon Shrine
   that I have put up on
   <a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/7969">my Dip page</a>.
   That site includes info
   on all the past events, and future ones as it becomes available. I'm looking
   for info on those WDC events I didn't attend (Canberra in 1992 and Paris in
   1995). Sometime in the next week, I'll have the first info up on the 1999 WDC
   event in Namur.  In the meantime, here's some preliminary information.
  <p>
   World DipCon IX will be hosted by DIPLONAM, The Belgium Diplomacy
   Championship event. You can learn more about that at
   <a href="http://www.gauss.ficsgrp.com/lar/diplonam.htm">this web site</a>
   (written in French). It will be held in Namur, a university town in the
   French-speaking area of Belgium, about a half-hour train ride from Brussels,
   and an easy connection to other major international airports in the
   area. Belgium and Namur are great tourist destinations. You can do a web
   search on either the country or city and find a lot of information in both
   French and English. The event will be held at Eastertime, next year, 2-4
   April. The main tournament usually lasts two days. For more information you
   can contact either
   <a href="mailto:nukeall@geocities.com">Jean-Louis Delattre</a>
   or
   <a href="mailto:bberken@colipa.be">Bruno Berken</a>.
   There are no registration fees for foreigners and there will be help with
   housing. You'll find Namur is much less expensive than most of the major
   cities. So, check to see if your passport is up-to-date and start packing.
  <p>
   So much for the world of Diplomacy. How about world of real diplomacy?  It's
   been an equally fascinating summer. The President of Belarus has been trying
   to get rid of foreign embassies since he doesn't much care for
   foreigners. The US didn't have an ambassador to our most important neighbor
   for months because Jesse Helms didn't like his pro-pot policy.  Apparently
   Helms also doesn't like ham, since he's held up the appointment of a Hormel
   to be our ambassador to Luxembourg!

   And while the Chocolate Wars (now in
   their 20th year) go on in Europe, the USA is now at war with one man!
   Actually, if you read the history of our relations with the Barbary pirates
   this may seem like old history reinterpreted by CNN and Wolf Blitzer! Yes,
   sometimes there is a better way than diplomacy!  Ecuador and Peru, the Congo
   (for the third time in my life), and The Balkans --- who says what goes
   around doesn't come around?
  <p>
   Anyway, if all else fails, try Tom Clancy's newest. He needs your
   money to pay his divorce settlement.
  <p>
   Have a great summer!
