<i>Your Publisher:</i>
<a href=Hand/About.html>About The Diplomatic Pouch</a></b><dd>

<i>Manus Hand:</i>
<A HREF="Hand/sinatra.html">The Pouch Salutes The Chairman of the Board</a></b><dd>
The world goes on without Frank Sinatra, but not without his music.  And now,
because apparently I must have something against the world, it won't be able to go on without
this collection of Sinatra songs, given fresh new lyrics that only the
Diplomacy player could learn to love.

<i>Heath Gardner:</i>
<A HREF="Gardner/reflections.html">Reflections of a Teenage Zine Publisher</a></b><dd>
Heath went from player to subscriber to publisher in a surprisingly short
time.  Some in the postal community call him a hero for launching a new
'zine.  Others (like me) call him a fellow fool for publishing anything at
all.  Here, he himself reflects on the how and why.

<i>Cameron Moser:</i>
<A HREF="Moser/wrath.html">The Wrath of the Diplomacy Gods</a></b><dd>
Every so often (but not <i>very</i> often), some things actually override the
importance of playing a game of Diplomacy.  Sad, but true.  And in these
circumstances, often only divine intervention can re-adjust priorities.

<i>Bjorn von Knorring:</i>
<A HREF="vonKnorring/mansa.html">The MANSA Charter</a></b><dd>
Read the charter for the first worldwide organization of Diplomacy players.
