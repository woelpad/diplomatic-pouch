<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the year post 9/11; &nbsp;2002 was supposed to be the year when everyone postponed their travel plans and elected to vacation somewhere close to home.  No ferries through the Straits of Dover, Juan de Fuca, Cabot or Cook.  Disregard tours to Oslo, Copenhagen, Stockholm, Helsinki and back.  Forget about visiting Recife, Cape Town, Lisbon, Paris, London, Amsterdam, Odesa, Newcastle or Wellington until next year.  Cancel all flights over the English Channel, Tasman Sea, Rockies, Appalachians, Pyrenees, Alps and Carpathians.  If the destination wasn't within driving distance, it wasn't on the travel agenda.  Yes, this was supposed to be the year when hobby enthusiasts worldwide flooded the internet and judges with long notes to FRIGATE promising nothing but perpetual support and asking how the weather was "over there".
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Instead, something happened that proved indicative of our very nature.  Instead of hiding behind our computer monitors and under our Hasbro boxes in mass proportion, Diplomacy players from all around travelled posting attendance records at face-to-face tournaments worldwide.  Instead of bowing to threats and real life saber rattling, players bonded together and travelled outside their comfort zones.  It's okay to threaten someone over Belgium or Greece but threaten our very way of life, noooo way!
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So in the midst of a real life threat, even I find myself asking the question - why?  Exactly why do men and women travel so far, spending personal resources to see, in some instances, total strangers or people they've only met <I>online</I> just to play a board game? &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;It's not like our hobby communitee consists of desperate, socially inept, sweaty armpit, sword touting, costumed, computer geeks who enjoy standing in cramped rooms talking to each other for hours on end. To the contrary, Diplomacy players are exceptionally intelligent.  [<I>Well, maybe most are.</I>]  There are a multitude of cutting edge people like lawyers, doctors, professors, counselors, teachers, computer networkers, undergrad and graduate students, politicians [including U.S. Presidents], etc.  So again, why do we play this game we play?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some may choose to debate the issue with me but I believe it's because of the relationships we sow that keep us coming back for more.  This year, I heard a player [<I>one that I now consider a close friend -- EH</I>] &nbsp;say, "Some of my closest friends are Diplomacy players."  Now wait a minute.  I can already hear the groans.  Don't start spouting carebear expletives at me.  Just pause to think about it for a moment ... &lt;pause&gt; ... and then read Jim Yerkey's article, "<A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Yerkey/deLove.html">Where's&nbsp;the&nbsp;Love</A>".
<H3><FONT="Arial">World Dip Con 2003</FONT></H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is it! Whether you're an <I>Ã¼ber</I> ftf-phile who thrives on stabbing with a smile, or a newbie who thinks North Africa is adjacent to Spain, WDC is the event of the year.  Players local to international flock to WDC like an annual pilgrimage, yearning to compete against some of the finest this hobby has to offer.  Where else can you interact with scores of tactical, strategic and diplomatic geniuses who not only know their stuff but they're often the ones who helped shape the hobby into what it is today?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So perhaps you've only heard about WDC, read about it in various articles or you just haven't had the incentive to plan the trek.  If that's the case, then my question to you is, when was the last time you actually attended the "Woodstock" of Diplomacy? &nbsp;[<I>You can actually order a tie-dyed or plain white WDC2003 <A HREF="/armada/2003/gear.html">t-shirt</A>.  Contact <A HREF="mailto:manus@manushand.com?subject=WDC_Tshirt">Manus</A> to place your order.</I>]  What are you waiting for!?! &nbsp;There's still time to mail in your pre-registration.  For more information on pre-regs, contact <A HREF="mailto:heisler@attbi.com?subject=Pre_registration">Kris&nbsp;Marquardt</A> at 303-680-7824 or via email at heisler@attbi.com.  Another option is to visit the WDC2003 host's website at <A HREF="/armada/2003/">www.diplom.org/armada/2003</A>.  If you <I>still</I> can't find the answers to what you're looking for, then contact <A HREF="mailto:manus@manushand.com?subject=WDC">Manus&nbsp;Hand</A> for more information.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For those planning to attend, the "The Committee to Subvert Manus" have published a player's guide to the ARMADA system.  Read, study, and sleep with "<A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Committee/armada_system.html">Ways To Play Diplomacy In Denver When You're Not Dead</A>", if you want an edge over other players all competing for the World Championship title.  "You will be better prepared than those who don't, so ignore it at your own peril."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Diplomacy is gaining momentium in name and tradition.  Chess has Bobby Fischer, baseball has Barry Bonds, basketball has Michael Jordan, while we have names like Allan Calhamer, Edi Birsan, Richard Sharp, Manus Hand, Yann Clouet, etc.  While I can't guarantee all of these men will be in Denver, February 14th - 16th, their names, work and influence will be as it permeates through the whole event.  Don't miss out.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Congratulations to the 2002 Grand Prix winners: &nbsp;Rob Schone (Bismark Cup), William Attia (European Grand Prix), and Andy "Buffalo" Bartalone (North American Grand Prix).  Talk about frequent flier miles.  These guys probably know the airline security procedures better than the airline employees.  Enjoy the honor gentlemen.  Kudos to you all.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To all North Americans, effective immediately, Edi Birsan will assist Buz Eddy as the new NADF Ratings Administrator.  Face-to-Face game reports should be submitted to <A HREF="mailto:edi@mgames.com?subject=NADF">Edi</A>, not Eddy.  Edi is not replacing Eddy and certainly should not be confused as the same person.  Edi will merely shoulder some of the NADF reporting responsibilities as point-man while Buz Eddy will loom in the shadows and focus on other NADF initiatives.  Please feel free to contact <A HREF="mailto:edi@mgames.com?subject=NADF">Edi</A> or <A HREF="mailto:buzeddy@aol.com?subject=NADF">Eddy</A> for more information.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Speaking of the NADF, if you're gearing up to compete and win next year's North American Grand Prix title, you'll want to pay close attention to two significant changes taking effect in 2003.  Other minor changes have been made as Jeff Dwornicki works to "<A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Dwornicki/GrandPrix.html">Update&nbsp;the&nbsp;Grand&nbsp;Prix</A>".
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other news, the A.S.G.S. proudly announces the EDC 2003 (European Diplomacy Convention) in San Marino, Italy, May 1st - 4th, 2003.  Visit the San Marino 2003 <A HREF="http://web.interpuntonet.it/ASGS/index.htm">website</A> for <A HREF="http://web.interpuntonet.it/ASGS/prenotazioni.htm">pre-registration</A> and travel information or contact <A HREF="mailto:gceccoli@omniway.sm?subject=EDC2003">Ceccoli&nbsp;Giancarlo</A> for more information.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Not only is this the last issue of 2002, it's also the last issue to feature game or <A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Committee/armada_system.html">tournament</A> winning articles before the big party in <A HREF="/armada/2003/">Denver</A>.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So you've drawn France but soon discover you have no friends.  Is it time to <A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Panic/Panic_Opening.html">panic</A>?  Dominik doesn't think so.  What if you're in the east and think the RT is too trite?  Need a breath of fresh <A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Birsan/AIRheads.html">AIR</A>? Here's your chance but whether you find yourself in the east or west, you better know your <A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Asal/Stalemate_Lines.html">stalemate&nbsp;lines</A> and <A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Cohen/Going_Coastal.html">coastal&nbsp;specifications</A> or you could find yourself on the <A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Schoenhardt/Losing.html">losing</A> end of the game.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perhaps standard isn't your cup-of tea.  There's aways <A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Powell/1900_Germany.html">1900</A> or the <A HREF="/Zine/W2002A/Janecek/Argentina.html">South&nbsp;American</A> variants.

<H3><FONT="Arial">The Zine in 2002:</FONT></H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reflecting back, the year ushered in a new article look-and-feel, new Pouch members, a new editor [<I>that's me</I>], new authors, <B>61</B> new articles, new champions, new variants, and a new server.  Following the lead of the DP Face-to-Face section, I also worked to make the Zine more international with a continued proliferation of articles from Australia, the U.K. and an introduction of native German articles -- 2 are featured in this issue. This also turned out to be the first complete Zine volume since 1999.  Who would've guessed?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now before the high-fives start let's also be honest here.  The Zine ended the year like it began -- behind schedule.  I understand no one is placing blame but if some of you are still disgruntled by years past, you better roll up your sleeves and register your complaints through me, because I'll look you in the eye and challenge <I>you</I> to write an article, enriching the Zine all the more.  Constructive criticism is welcomed but also keep in mind that the Pouch staff have voluntarily worked hard all year long to deliver a dip-centric product and service to all who visit.  We do our best but we also know our priorities.  Contrary to popular belief we're not a bunch of geeks!  [<I>Okay, maybe </I>I am<I> but... oh wait, did I say that out loud?</I>]
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes, there is always room for improvement and here's where you can help.  Watch for on-time Zine issues in the coming year, don't be affraid to <A HREF="mailto:dippouch@devel.diplom.org?subject=Broken_Link">report</A> any broken links, submit your comments and articles, and anticipate the same 2002 look-and-feel to be populated throughout the whole Zine.  Please feel free to let the Zine and its editor know what you thought about <A HREF="mailto:dippouch@devel.diplom.org?subject=The_Pouch_in_2002">the&nbsp;Pouch&nbsp;in&nbsp;2002</A>.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In closing, I don't want to forget to extend credit where credit is due.  A wave of people helped me in my first year as editor.  Special thanks go to a few mentioned here who assisted [<I>or "gently" nudged</I>] me along the way:  Stephen Agar, Edi Birsan, Jim Burgess, Brandon Clarke, David Hood, Buz Eddy, JT&nbsp;Fest, David Kovar, Andy&nbsp;"Satan"&nbsp;Marshall, Chris Martin, Doug Massey, Millis Miller, Timo MÃ¼ller, Larry Peery, Matt Shields, Jim Yerkey and the list goes on.  <!-- [If your name doesn't appear here it's not because I'm dissing you, I just didn't want to list your name!] -->  Let's see, did I forget anyone else....... oh yeah, and Manus Hand!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img src=/Zine/Common/smiley.gif>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Join me and the DP Council in Denver, February 14th - 16th, 2003, as we renew old friendships and build new ones face-to-face.
