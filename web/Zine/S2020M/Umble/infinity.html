				In comic book lore, the infinity stones represent ultimate power. If one person possesses them, then his every desire will be realized with just a snap of his fingers. Disney brought in nearly 5 billion dollars based on the villain Thanos acquiring these stones in the last two Avenger movies.  Does such a power exist in the diplomacy world?  I don&#8217;t want to overstate my case, but I believe there are skills that will help you influence the board in a powerful way that might even seem godlike to some.
			</p>
			<p>
				Tactics and strategy are vital in high level play but there is another ability that will separate your play from others: learning how to weaponize other people&#8217;s emotions.  Unlocking them rests in understanding human nature and how to discern what motivates each of the players on the board.
			</p>
			<p>
				Admittedly, some of these motivations are more powerful depending on their context.  In the quick deadlines of face to face play, you&#8217;ll find some emotions are hard to manipulate because of lack of time.   The less personal nature of online play also presents unique challenges.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="right_image" width="15%" src="../images/InfinityStones.jpg">
				This is a series for those that go into games looking to solo. Finding an ally, getting to 8-9, and then turtling is a way to play.  But&hellip;you don&#8217;t become Thanos by racking up draw after draw.  This is for people that want to win and be in control of the levers of power.
			</p>
			<p>
				Just as there are six infinity stone, there are six emotions we will be looking at over the course of this series.  Players who understand these emotions don&#8217;t usually need to lie.  Instead, they can manipulate through insinuation and suggestion.  They become a master of whisperers that turn their rivals&#8217; heads wherever they want.

				<img class="right_image" width="15%" src="../images/Greed.png">
				An overarching theme of Sun Tzu&#8217;s Art of War is that anger and greed are the fundamental causes of defeat.  When it comes to high level play, greed is one of the most powerful emotions in your arsenal of manipulation.  Your best players are constantly looking for avenues of expansion.
			</p>
			<p>
				If you can show them a better path, they usually will agree even if it means betraying their ally.  In fact, most alliance shifts can be boiled down to someone wanting to grow in a faster way than their current alliance.  Be aware when a greedy player&#8217;s growth is slowing down.  This is the likely time when a stab will come.  To maintain an alliance you need to continue to offer better paths of expansion.
			</p>
			<p>
				<img class="left_image" width="30%" src="../images/GreedFallMap.png">
				Pay close attention when a greedy player asks for one of your centers.  They often will ask in the spirit of wanting to keep the alliance balanced but know this&hellip;it is not a request.  In a recent tournament game, I (France) was allied with Germany.  He began requesting Belgium, but I explained there were better opportunities.
			</p>
			<p>
				He agreed, but then I heard he was planning to take Belgium with England&#8217;s help.  With only a short time before the deadline, I told him he could have Belgium if he promised to attack Russia and support me to the North Sea.  This was the defining move of the game, and I eventually soloed and secured my place on the final board.
			</p>
			<p>
				This illustrated another great strategy: hold off offering a center until shortly before the deadline.  If you have determined that this person is motivated by greed, he&#8217;ll often jump at the opportunity and not realize that his backstab is really only a short term gain.  
			</p>
			<p>
				Understanding greed should help you anticipate moves.  Greedy players will always make the move that locks in quick gains.  Learning how to manipulate the greed of other players will lift your game to another level.  Master its use.   
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>In the next part of the series, we will look at using fear and empathy.</i>
