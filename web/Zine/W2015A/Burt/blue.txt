As the Belgian detective Hercule Poirot might say "It's best to compose
when the little grey cells are awake".

Second verse of Blue Christmas:

Oh there're kingdoms of red
And grand duchies of green
It won't be the same, Nick
If you're not on my computer screen

I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
