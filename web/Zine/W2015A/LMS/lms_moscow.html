<b>Looking ahead</b>

<p>With the Winter season setting in across the Northern hemisphere, with
promises of record snowfall in many places due to our ever warming globe
(presumably all that melting  ice on the Poles is converting itself to
snow?), it's pretty appropriate that we move our focus to Russia. Moscow
has the distinction of being the only other Great Power capital that enters
the final year with just 3 units. The formation is a particular one, with
all 3 armies starting on a Russian home center. To reduce this to one is
fairly straightforward. Could it have been all 4 home centers? And how did
the first 3 years develop?</p>

<p>For the second puzzle the final destination becomes St. Petersburg, the
Tsar's winter capital. I'll take the liberty of letting another unit
triumph, otherwise you would accuse me of being a cuckold Anglophile. Fear
not, my world view is wider than that. Remember, I'm Belgian. And while we
might be extremely friendly to our Muslim brothers (I mean "unfriendly" if
we are driving them to extremism as some analysts suggest), we love our
French retreats. For Belgians and Muslims alike France is the number one
touristic destination, with Paris and the C&ocirc;te d'Azur (Marseilles) at the
top of their list. Which is why for this second puzzle a French army has
the honor of relieving the Liverpudlian. But which one? In fact army
Liverpool might as well die during the first Winter. But will he? Study the
map well, showing the final situation. There's a lot of commonality with
the Moscow map, but it's the small differences that are most revealing.

<b>Army Berlin to Berlin</b>

<p>Last time I challenged you to guide a German and a Russian
army towards Berlin as the Last Man Standing. We will start with Army
Berlin.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/lms_ber-ber17.gif" target="_blank"><img src="images/lms_ber-ber17.gif" width="50%" alt="Army Berlin to Berlin, After Winter 1904"/><br/><b>Army Berlin to Berlin, After Winter 1904<br/><i><small>Click to enlarge in separate window</small></i></b></a></p>

<p>Remember that A Ber is the first German unit to be removed in the
Baron's game, in Winter 1902 after the loss of Paris to A Lvp. To prevent
the capture we can move A Lvp to Gascony instead. This means there's one
more German unit in play in 1903 and potentially also in 1904. Is this a
problem? Not really. Four can still be reduced to one in the final year.
Where this unit needs to be in Spring 1904 however requires some careful
study.</p>

<p>The location of 2 of the 4 units are immediately clear. Munich and Kiel
remain English and Turkish respectively, therefore they are occupied by A
Lvp and A Con as in the original solution. F Stp is still the remaining
sniper, but with 4 units it cannot remain in Livonia or the Gulf of
Bothnia, as it must be able to support the first dislodgement in Spring and
the second (to Berlin) in Fall. It must therefore already be next to
Berlin. Being a fleet this can only be in Prussia or the Baltic Sea. Berlin
itself is another option, but as it turns out not a good one, as it would
block anyone from entering the city.</p>

<p>In Spring one of the raiders must move to Berlin, while the second
raider gets dislodged. Since Munich does not border the sea, A Lvp must
enter the capital, while A Con is driven from Kiel. This requires F Stp to
be in the Baltic Sea and A Ber in Ruh, since neither can be on a center
after Fall, given that capturing neutral centers is forbidden. The map thus
looks like this:</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/lms_ber-ber13.gif" target="_blank"><img src="images/lms_ber-ber13.gif" width="50%" alt="Army Berlin to Berlin, After Winter 1903"/><br/><b>Army Berlin to Berlin, After Winter 1903<br/><i><small>Click to enlarge in separate window</small></i></b></a></p>

<p>How do we ensure our two snipers to be where they are supposed to be?
Easy enough for F Stp, who only needs to swap with F Kie. Whereas before
they simply needed to move out to sea to be ready for the Fall 1902
dislodgement of F Edi and the subsequent Spring 1903 convoy from St.
Petersburg to Kiel, they now need to move around each other. This can be
accomplished in 2 turns if F Stp first moves to Livonia and F Kie to the
Baltic Sea. And we have 3 movement turns (4 for the fleet in the Baltic
Sea), so still plenty of time.</p>

<p>For A Ber however we need to be more careful. This army already comes
into action in Fall 1901 when it attacks A Vie in Bohemia supported by A
Ven in Tyrolia. In 1902 it supports twice the unit coming from Venice to
Tyrolia, meaning it's still in Bohemia when A Ven moves to Munich in Spring
1903, prohibiting A Ber from reaching the Ruhr. A Ber could move to Munich
on the first turn and support A Ven to Bohemia against A Vie. But that
would break the chain that was running from Rome to Bohemia that enabled us
to reduce the units there to just one, A Rom, in 1902. Or the support could
be given the other way around, helping A Vie to Tyrolia against A Ven. But
then Italy would have only 2 units left and therefore would not be able to
disband F Nap. Come what may, we're stuck with one extra unit to the right
of Switzerland that will probably still be there a year later.</p>

<p>Let's reconsider our options. Instead of requiring the right side to be
reduced to one unit, let's reduce the left side to just A Lvp. That means
getting rid of A Par in 1902. As this originally was the last surviving
French unit, we'll make sure that A Mar is among the remaining 2 on the
right. But A Par was also instrumental in removing F Lon in Fall 1902. To
clear that hurdle, we divert F Lon to Kiel, where no less than A Ber will
attack and dislodge it, supported by F Stp in the Baltic. That extra sniper
unit really proves to be useful.</p>

second German army, we can just as well let A Ven capture Munich, leading
to:</p>

<p>The final year. What looked like some deceptively simple variation,
turned out to be quite a mindbender, involving over half of the units on
the board. And that while the final map only differed in two places (Berlin
and Paris) from the original one. Just compare the After Winter 1902 maps
of this and the Baron's solution.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/lms_lvp-ber9.gif" target="_blank"><img src="images/lms_lvp-ber9.gif" width="50%" alt="Army Liverpool to Berlin, After Winter 1902"/><br/><b>Army Liverpool to Berlin, After Winter 1902<br/><i><small>Click to enlarge in separate window</small></i></b></a></p>

<p>On the surface this is the same combination of units as in the original,
i.e. a grand total of 8 units, the only pair being German. True. But many
of these did not start in the same home centers and are now in different
locations. A clear demonstration of the kind of flexibility and creativity
needed to solve this sort of puzzles.</p>

<b>Army Warsaw to Berlin</b>

<p align="center"><a href="images/lms_war-ber17.gif" target="_blank"><img src="images/lms_war-ber17.gif" width="50%" alt="Army Warsaw to Berlin, After Winter 1904"/><br/><b>Army Warsaw to Berlin, After Winter 1904<br/><i><small>Click to enlarge in separate window</small></i></b></a></p>

<p>The groundwork for this solution was given to me by Graeme Ackland. He
attempted to solve the very first version of the puzzle, which was simply
to make A Lvp become the Last Man Standing in Berlin with no neutral
centers captured and all powers still having a unit going into 1903. How
close did he get? Extremely close, as you will notice. As this is not my
own solution, let me get off my cathedra and explore the solution as it
unfolds itself.</p>

<p>The first year sets the stage. We see Russia moving on Turkey and
Austria, England on France and Germany, and Italy even in three different
directions. But the movement of the sniper countries is just as important.
Russia loses both its fleets to German and Turkish sharpshooters. France
and Austria act like mirror images of each other, both losing 2 centers,
but capturing one, and sending their fleet into the Med. The significance
of this will become apparent later.</p>

</p>

<p>Again France and Austria lose 2 and capture 1. At this rate they will be
both out of the race by the end of the third year. Which is exactly what
will happen. Notice the location of their last center. Indeed, each took a
German home center, leaving Germany with only Berlin. Meanwhile England
lost its two fleets, one in Kiel like in the previous puzzle (you see where
I got the mustard), one in Picardy by way of a German army coming through
Belgium, as if doing a historical reenactment. A War crosses into Italy.
More units are destroyed in Turkey, even if the dislodgement of the second
Turkish army is overkill, since Turkey loses a second home center anyway.
But why wait until Winter? F Bre finally arrives at the scene. 9 units
left, all colors still present.</p>

<p>A War moves again through Austria to reach Germany. You could have
expected A Lvp to dislodge A Ven, but that's not happening, because A Ven
is the only raider that can reach Kiel. Both Kiel and Munich need to be
captured to be able to disband the French and Austrian fleets in the
Mediterranean. Two sweepers rounding up units far away from the goal. Rings
a bell? Indeed, it's the same principle underpinning the Russian sweep of
Turkey in the Baron's game, except that this is happening in 1903, not
1902. As a consequence more units can be killed off. This is actually so
powerful that it will be used in many more Last Man Standing puzzles. And
we have Graeme to thank for it.</p>

<p>A Ber, the last remaining sniper, is well positioned in Silesia, a
non-center province bordering both Munich and Berlin, to assist A War to
victory. A Lvp admiringly lasted until Spring 1904, but has no choice than
to give way to A War, as the latter starts out 2 provinces away from the
target, Berlin.</p>

<p>The open question now is: Can this be improved upon? Can, with some
minimal adjustments, A Lvp become LMS while retaining the overall flow of
this solution? This might be hard to answer, which is why I challenge you
to find out for yourself and formulate a proof, positive or negative. If
you have one, please share it with me.</p>

<b>The aftergame</b>

<p>A typical LMS game ends with a board where one or more powers have been
eliminated, a few powers are hanging on with very few centers and the rest
having a decent number of centers, if perhaps not all their home centers.
The power owning the Last Man Standing could be in either of the latter
situations, as demonstrated by the two games above. This might sound like a
typical mid-game situation, except for the lack of units and the fact that
all neutral centers remain uncaptured.</p>

<p>How will it go from here? To answer that I'm going to create for each
solved LMS puzzle, starting with ber-ber and war-ber, a game on UKDP that
starts where the puzzle ends, in Winter 1904, with a single unit on the
board and all remaining powers ready to build. Small powers will be teamed
up with big powers in order to create some rough balance. A typical game
consists of 3 to 5 players vying for the solo, based on the sum of your
team's centers. Most games will be No Press, unless requested otherwise.</p>

<p>If there's a puzzle that you particularly liked, or you like the
alternative starting position, or you're just as curious as I am about the
continuation, sign up. Don't fret if it takes a bit longer for the game to
fill up. You're part of a piece of art.</p>
