<H1>A HOLIDAY POEM</H1>

<center><p>Here we're sitting, weak and weary, eyes bloodshot and vision bleary,
<br>Staring at all the pieces scattered on the Diplomacy board.
<br>Our game plans had a fatal flaw, the game has ended in a draw,
<br>All of these things I'm sad I saw from exile on Africa's shore.
<br>I did this when I could have just gotten up and walked out the door
<br>Because the game was not a bore.

<p>We had gathered 'round the table to be civil while we're able,
<br>Reaching deep into a bag to pick the powers that we would play.
<br>When it was time for the reveal, I looked down and made a loud squeal.
<br>The army's colour was not teal, it was the red that wrecks your day.
<br>There was cruel laughter when I begged "Anybody wanna trade?"
<br>My dreams of victory decayed.

<p>I thought I would curry favour with my lovely Russian neighbour
<br>Whose eyes were the colour of glacial ice and just as cold.
<br>She thought that I was a newbie she could influence with boobies
<br>And the promises of whoopee, but I could tell, if truth be told,
<br>I would get screwed, but not in a way that would make me feel less old.
<br>With a polite bow, off I strolled.

<p>If my neighbour, the Turkish gent, could to my purposes be bent,
<br>I could save my fat ass and have someone with whom I could collude.
<br>I made to him an offer fair, which should cause Russia to despair,
<br>But all I got was a blank stare, and I was sure then I was screwed.
<br>Though all their initial promises had verisimilitude,
<br>My only hope was the Italian dude.

<p>My western neighbour, Italy, did seem as friendly as can be.
<br>Which, in the world of Diplomacy, means that I should run like hell.
<br>I tried to sell him on a plan to put Turkey into the can.
<br>Can we do it? Oh yes we can! I enthused that it will go well!
<br>Despite my efforts, I could see that my great plan was not a sell.
<br>My doom was sealed, this I could tell.

<p>The time has come to write orders, to send units past their borders.
<br>It isn't paranoia when you KNOW they are out to get you.
<br>My only hope is the Hedgehog. Without it I'll be a dead dog.
<br>I could not sit by like a log while all my plans got turned to goo.
<br>"I will survive!" I roared, and opened up and downed another brew.
<br>"A war with Austria you'll lose!"

<p>The sordid details of the game would cause most players endless shame,
<br>And I'm not proud of the things that I had to do to just survive.
<br>To end the game with Tunis fleet needed much bluster and deceit
<br>And backroom bargains most discreet that I could skilfully derive.
<br>I was a key part of the stalemate line that kept myself alive.
<br>One of remaining players five.

<p>The draw agreed, we stood and stretched. We knew more beers must now be fetched.
<br>Of all of us, the most in need was my exhausted, burnt-out self.
<br>I grabbed my cold and frothy mug and tipped my head back for a slug,
<br>Was interrupted by a tug from a cutie dressed as an elf,
<br>"We need an Austria and no-one plays it better than yourself!"
<br>Why do I do this to myself?

<p>Thank God this was a different game, whose outcome was not the same
<br>As the cutie who dragooned me learned in a most personal way.
<br>With her as friendly Italy, we crushed all players we could see,
<br>We worked well so naturally, that next year on our wedding day,
<br>I told our crowd of gamer friends that playing Austria CAN pay.
<br>I would have it no other way.</center>
