<br>Silent friend, holy crap
<br>I walked into his trap
<br>Round my units he's moved all his troops
<br>The only word that he says now is "oops"
<br>Maybe there's help from the east
<br>Maybe there's help from the east
<br>
<br>Silent foes, holy...uh...spit
<br>It looks like this is it
<br>No one's talking to me anymore
<br>My game-long ally was bad to the core
<br>It's time to fall on my sword
<br>It's time to fall on my sword
<br>
<br>Silent board, holy hell
<br>I threaten to throw; they say "oh well"
<br>They'll just give eighteen to my old ally?
<br>I can't even pay him an eye for an eye?
<br>Now what the heck should I do?
<br>Now what the heck should I do?
<br>
<br>Silent end, holy...uh...truck
<br>I guess I was a sitting duck
<br>I prayed while the orders were all read out, but
<br>Each of my hopeless supports was just cut
<br>Handshakes and bar-time for me
<br>Handshakes and bar-time for me
