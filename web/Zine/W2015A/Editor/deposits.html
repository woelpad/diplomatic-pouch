<H3>Here's the Mail</H3>
<p>Mail takes on many different forms these days. Tweets, chats, comments on
pages, &hellip; It all makes it harder to stick an e-mail address on the person.
Sometimes we resort to asking for one.</p>

<H3 ALIGN="CENTER">Mail Received Concerning<BR>DO REAL DIPPERS READ REAL BOOKS
ABOUT REAL DIP ANYMORE?
</H3>
<HR/>
<H4>From Larry Peery (<A HREF="mailto:peery@ix.netcom.com">peery@ix.netcom.com</A>): 
</H4>

<p>We're looking for contributors for a new TDP feature. We need people who
write books, read books, and like to write about books. The books can be about
<b>Diplomacy</b> (the game) or diplomacy-related books that might be of interest to
Dippers.
Solo efforts, by writers or reviewers, are welcome and group efforts (e.g.
multiple reviews of the same book) are equally welcome.</p> 

<p>If you were (or are) a fan of Brian Lamb's long-running C-SPAN series,
BOOKNOTES, then you should be writing for and reading this new and, hopefully,
regular TDP series.
If you've got a book you've written and want reviewed or a book you've read
and want to review, drop me a line.
The worst thing I can say, "I know you can do better. Write, or read, it
again!" :-)</p>

<p>Larry</p>
