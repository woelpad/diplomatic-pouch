<p>This is the fifth and last issue in my first year as editor-in-chief of
the <b>Diplomatic Pouch Zine</b>. And what an issue it has become. Not only
did we create a complete <a href="special.html">Christmas special</a>, but
we also have a good number of theme-related articles, puzzles, poems,
letters and more. The revived <b>Diplomatic Pouch</b> <a href="
https://www.facebook.com/The-Diplomatic-Pouch-124997820183/">Facebook</a>
page is now really buzzing and a great way to
communicate with our readers, either through posts or through Facebook
Messenger. Don't hesitate to join in and challenge us in any form.</p>

<p>The theme for this issue was engendered by the events in November with
the terrorist attacks in Paris. A French 9/11, but let us not forget,
Lebanon, Libya and elsewhere in the world, happening at or around the same
time and ever since then. It was interesting to observe how the debate
quickly shifted from an "All Muslims are terrorists" stance to "IS is not
Islam"; that the war they're fighting is not one of East versus West (good
for propaganda and recruitment though), but for a state of their own,
displacing Shiites, Kurds, Turks and any other of the multitude of
ethnicities in the area. Among their preferred tactics, like many invading
armies in the past, are fear and terror. And that became the theme: "Fear,
Terror and the City of Lights", as adopted to the game of <b>Diplomacy</b>.
Because, coincidence or not, in just the same weekend and not far from the
places where the attacks took place, the FDC tournament was held in Paris,
part of the European Diplomacy Tour. You can read plenty about this event
in this issue.</p>

<p>But what if we apply this to the Game? Fear to me is what you try to
instill in others to get them on your side and try (but often fail) to see
through when you're the target. Terror is the terror of the clock, the
approaching deadline when your orders are still in flux. But the two could
go hand in hand when manipulated by a master player. More can be said about
this, so if you have any ideas, take your electronic device and start
typing or swiping. And the City of Lights is Paris, capital of France,
highly ranked as an excellent power to play, whether by beginners or
experts, as it often does well in openings and has one of the highest solo
averages. Toby Harris has devoted an
<a href="../Harris/france.html">Experts</a> article to this Power.
Certainly worth the read.</p>

<p>There's also a small improvement to the Zine itself. Clicking the icons
in the table of contents will bring you to the list of articles in the same
category as the article following the icon. E.g. if you want to read
more humor articles, click on the mask in front of Harold's poem on the
<a href="../index.html">index</a> page.
This change has two advantages: It improves navigation for the
reader and it forces us, the editorial staff, to update the page with the
full list of aricles. Since this has been neglected in the past, it will
take a while to sort it all out for previous issues. But this and future
issues should behave correctly.</p>

<h3>Enjoy the Pouch!</h3>
