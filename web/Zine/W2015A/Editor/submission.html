<p>
    I have read and understand <em>The Diplomatic Pouch Zine</em> Submission Guidelines.
</p>
<p>
    What does this mean?
	<em>The Diplomatic Pouch Zine</em>
    strongly welcomes submissions from authors and <strong>Diplomacy</strong> players. We especially encourage new players, and young people.
</p>
<p>
    Submitting on or before the deadline allow the editors to&hellip; edit. At a minimum, if you are somewhat gifted in HTML, the text will be applied to our page
    template.
</p>
<p>
We prefer submissions in English, but accept a good range of other commonly spoken languages in Western-Europe that we'll help to translate. Place foreign language words in <em>italics</em>. Contact our multi-lingual    <a href="mailto:editor@diplom.org">Editor</a> for guidance.
</p>
<p>
    The first line of your article should read: I have read and understand the <em>The Diplomatic Pouch Zine</em> Submission Guidelines.
</p>
<p>
    If possible please spell-check, grammar-check your article.
</p>
<p>
    We can accept almost all formats of text (Word, rich text, plain text, etc). We prefer HTML.
</p>
<p>
    Provide the proposed title in ALL CAPS. Proposed subtitles should be in normal punctuation preceded by a colon. TITLE: Subtitle
</p>
<p>
    <em>The Zine</em>
    will not publish potentially libelous material. <em>The Zine</em> will not publish <strong><em>plagiarized</em></strong> material (simply include the
source). <em>The Zine</em> discourages anonymous articles, but will consider pen names (<em>noms de plume</em>) under certain circumstances. Ask the    <a href="mailto:editor@diplom.org">Editor</a> in advance.
</p>
<p>
    Provide the "byline" you prefer in normal text - (e.g. by Larry Q. Period). Tell the <a href="mailto:editor@diplom.org">Editor</a> if using your e-mail
    address is okay.
</p>
<p>
    All use of the word <strong>Diplomacy</strong>, referring to the board game, should be in bold / strong text.
</p>
<p>
    Paragraph headings / subheadings should be in <strong>bold</strong> normal text, <strong>Like This</strong>
</p>
<p>
    We prefer at least one image to accompany the submission. Provide that image, and a url address or "link" if taken from the Internet for copyright
    protections. We prefer no more than five images. Contact the <a href="mailto:editor@diplom.org">Editor</a> if more are integral to the article.
</p>

</CENTER></p>
<p>
    In submitting the article and image (s), you attest they do not infringe on copyright protected material.
</p>

<p>
Links are embedded, i.e. they are readable text that have a link on them, not plain url's, e.g. <a href="/Zine/About.html">About the Zine</a>. If you use a document type that doesn't allow embedding the link, put them between brackets after the text describing them, e.g. About the Zine (/Zine/About.html).
</p>

<p>
    Quotation marks are used to show that you are quoting what someone else said. Whenever you use quotation marks, you're showing <em>exactly</em> what
    someone said or wrote. For example:
</p>
<p>
    "The secret of politics? Make a good treaty with Russia," said Otto von Bismarck. Include the first name the first time you quote him. Note the comma
    inside the quote.
</p>
<p>
    Use <em>italics</em> for Books, <em>War and Peace</em>; Plays, <em>Julius Caesar</em>; Newspapers, <em>The London Times</em> (note the The); Magazines (and
e-zines), <em>Newsweek</em> (January 1, 2004), <em>The Diplomatic Pouch Zine </em>(Retreat, 2015) [include the date]; Movies, <em>Berlin Express</em>; Television and radio shows,    <em>The Man in the High Castle</em>; Computer and video games, <em>Grand Theft Civilization</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Italics <em>whisper,</em> bold <strong>shouts</strong>.
</p>
<p>
    "e.g." equates to example given; "i.e." - that is to say.
</p>
End your submission with a brief biography.
<p>
    Too Picky? Our readers - such as you - deserve the highest quality we can possibly provide. Don't let them stop you from submitting your article - that's what editors do.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Pay</strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Editors are volunteers, and when they get paid, they will have an expense-paid meeting in an exotic location (i.e. the tropics in winter) to discuss pay.
