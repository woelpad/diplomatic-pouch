<br>The dot stands out on its own, no doubt,
<br>Not an army to be seen.
<br>So splendid in isolation,
<br>And it begs me: "Take me in."
<br>
<br>The stab is building like this burning itch inside,
<br>Couldn't keep it in, heaven knows I tried.
<br>
<br>Don't send them on, don't let them come,
<br>Be the carebear you always were to them.
<br>Conceal, don't spill, don't let them know.
<br>Well, now they'll know!
<br>
<br>Let them go! Let them go!
<br>Can't hold them back anymore.
<br>Let them go! Let them go!
<br>Turn away and hit the floor!
<br>
<br>I don't care
<br>What you're going to say!
<br>Let the fleets move on!
<br>The splash never bothered me anyway.
<br>
<br>It's funny how a solo
<br>Makes every virtue fall.
<br>And the fears that once controlled me
<br>Can't get to me at all!
<br>
<br>It's time to see why I not grew,
<br>To test the defense and break through.
<br>All right, no wrongs, no lies from me.
<br>Trust me!
<br>
<br>Let them go! Let them go!
<br>Say 'Hi' to my stab and die.
<br>Let them go! Let them go!
<br>I want to see you cry!
<br>
<br>Here I'll stab
<br>And this I'll grab!
<br>Let the fleets move on!
<br>
<br>My power worries my opponents to the bone.
<br>My count is spiraling in a dozen centers all alone.
<br>And one thought terrifying, but I think 'Blast!'
<br>I'm never going back.
<br>The past is in the past!
<br>
<br>Let them go! Let them go!
<br>I'll rise to the top of the board.
<br>Let them go! Let them go!
<br>The Devil is my new Lord!
<br>
<br>Here I stab
<br>In the light of day!
<br>Let the fleets move on!
<br>The splash never bothered me anyway.
