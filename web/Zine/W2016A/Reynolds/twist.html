		<!-- Content Body -->
			<p>
				<span class="game_name">Diplomacy</span> is a game <br/>
				Where no two outcomes are the same. <br/>
				Kind of like a game of chess <br/>
				With seven players under stress. <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				Pieces scattered all about <br/>
				Were making grown men scream and shout. <br/>
				Former allies, glaring death <br/>
				Cursed their foes with their dying breath. <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				That's to say, a normal day <br/>
				In a tourney where Dippers play. <br/>
				But not all games were routine. <br/>
				Like this game that I wish you'd seen. <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				Chance brought us to the table, <br/>
				All opponents were quite able. <br/>
				We sat down and had to stare <br/>
				At the lovely lass who was there. <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				Bright blue eyes and winsome smile: <br/>
				I'd sooner trust a crocodile. <br/>
				Neighbour boys were all smitten, <br/>
				Asses ready to be bitten. <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				I, however, wasn't fooled. <br/>
				From hard lessons, where I'd been schooled. <br/>
				"You!" I growled, not in a daze. <br/>
				"Guys, don't believe a word she says!" <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				Stupid neighbour, early stab, <br/>
				Seeking SCs that he can grab. <br/>
				She was ready, and the lout <br/>
				Saw his charge turn into a rout. <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				I moved fast to grab my share <br/>
				Ignoring blandly her cold stare. <br/>
				(Never miss the chance to gain <br/>
				At the expense of someone's pain.) <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				Her blue eyes had hypnotized <br/>
				Another stooge who was not wise. <br/>
				"Against them we all must band!" <br/>
				Said I, not mentioning my plans. <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				I am innocent!" she cried. <br/>
				"Look what HE did to THAT poor guy!" <br/>
				"Clearly SHE's the greater threat! <br/>
				"She'll crush you next, it's safe to bet!" <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				One guy made a grunting noise. <br/>
				"You two are frauds! Let's get 'em, boys!" <br/>
				Bitter rivals, instant friends; <br/>
				It's funny how some games will end. <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				I fought her and she fought me, <br/>
				We fought them into history. <br/>
				Fought with tooth and fought with claw... <br/>
				It ended in a messy draw. <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				All the others slouched away, <br/>
				In quest of beer to end the day. <br/>
				We stood up. I heard her growl, <br/>
				"I did want you dead so you'd howl!" <br/>
			</p>

			<p>
				"In my eyes, you're the winner. <br/>
				Let's go home, I'll make you dinner." <br/>
				It's a story in my life, <br/>
				To tie a <span class="game_name"> Dip </span> game with my wife. <br/>
			</p>
