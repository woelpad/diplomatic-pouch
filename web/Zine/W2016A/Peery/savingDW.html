<p>
I remember agonizing for months watching DW <i>(<a href="http://www.diplomacyworld.net">Diplomacy World</a>)</i> slide down the hill (Rod Walker was publisher/chief editor and I was assistant). Finally, I couldn't stand it any more. The zine was hurting and so was Rod. So I contacted Buchanan and some of the key figures in the DW family and proposed that I take over as publisher and editor. They agreed. I called Rod and told him what was going on. I'll never forget his reaction. I could hear the joy in voice as he said, "Thank you. Thank you."
</p>

<p>
Within a week he had arranged to give the printed back issues he had, a couple of hundred in stamps, some unpublished articles, and the mailing list. Oh, and sub commitments for some $4K that were due to subbers. I used the stamps and mailing list to send out a letter to every DW subber and trading partner (there were 80 or so of those).  I told them that DW was bankrupt and they had two choices: 1) take back issues in lieu of future ones if desired, or 2) forgive future issues owed to them and re-sub anew. Oh, and if they were serious about saving the zine I needed an article from them for the future and I wanted it now.
</p>

<p>
Then I waited anxiously to see how the hobby would respond. Well, it did, magnificently. Within a week I had over a hundred new paid subs, forgiveness of most of the back issues due and, surprisingly a lot of sales of back issues that brought in some much needed cash. Perhaps most encouraging, I got some really good articles, enough for a couple of issues worth.
</p>

<p>
While all this was going on I wasn't the only one trying to save DW. John Caruso and some of his friends put out a counterfeit issue of DW that looked more like the Walker version than what I was doing. Then, a few days later, my first issue, #40, appeared.
</p>

<p>
We eventually got it sorted out.  DW had its problems since then but it was never again in such a serious danger of collapse. The hobby had come together to save its flagship and that effort went a long way toward ending The Great Feud.
</p>

<p>
So, saving TDP <i>(<a href="/">The Diplomatic Pouch</a>)</i> can be done. It might not be on the same scale of effort but doing it online is a lot easier than dealing with hard copy issues and licking all those damn stamps! Trust me.
