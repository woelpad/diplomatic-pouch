<P>
If you figure out how and why the Sultan is in Greece only after having
learned his location from this page, please 'fess up when submitting your
answer -- you still get partial credit for that.
<p>
You should be aware that your reasoning may be different from Holmes's.  There
are two unique and independent ways to determine from the evidence that the
Sultan is in Greece.  Perhaps only Holmes, with his forward-looking mind, sees
the second set of clues.  (Or perhaps <em>you</em> do....)
