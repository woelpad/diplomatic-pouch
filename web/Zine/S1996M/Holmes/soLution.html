<h2 align=center>The Solution to The Hunt for the Venison Camper</H2>
<PRE>
For the first puzzle, we find 68 of the province names.  The locations which
are not found are the Sultan's possible vacation sites.  These are:
Brest, Berlin, Clyde, Galicia, Greece, Moscow, Ruhr, and Smyrna.

1.  The Sultan says that he is on the European continent.  This eliminates
    Smyrna and Clyde.
2.  He states that he has the pleasures of Port Suwat (meaning he's on a
    coast), but none of the problems of urbanity (so he's not in a city).
    This leaves Greece, where the Sultan awaits payment.

For the second part of the puzzle, the following information can be gleaned
from the cover letter:

1.  The Sultan says that it is the turn of the century, so we know that the
    units available to the King of England are as at the beginning of the
    game.
2.  The emissary is to visit the locations which the Sultan did not choose en
    route, so to make a report on them to the Sultan.  However, we know that
    the Sultan wished to vacation "on the continent of Europe" so we can
    eliminate Clyde and Smyrna from the places which the emissary must visit.
3.  A military general is to accompany the emissary, meaning that he will
    travel with the army currently in Liverpool.
4.  Only one build center is functional, and we don't know which one.  We
    are told, though, that there will never be a need (nor an opportunity)
    to build more than one unit a year.
5.  The emissary is fond of sailing, and he must be convoyed whenever this
    will not extend the trip length.
6.  The trip to Greece via the other sites must be accomplished as quickly
    as possible and with the least wasted effort.  (From this, we can also
    determine that the build center which can be used is Liverpool.)

Holmes then works through a number of problems, finally coming up with the
following and single best itinerary for the emissary.  He shall be sent to 
Liverpool where he shall be met by an army commander.  The two shall then
proceed as detailed in the first line below.  He has alternatives at
three points of time (Edi/Yor, Hol/Bel, and War/Ukr).
