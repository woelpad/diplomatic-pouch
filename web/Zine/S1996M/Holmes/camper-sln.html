The events of that evening certainly did not go as I had expected.  The 
<font color=blue><strong>basic tale</strong></font> begins abruptly, but the events which preceded the
start of this narrative are rather dull and of little interest.  It was
near the end of December, 1900.  We, my
fiancee, Anna, and I, had just been announced and walked, arm in arm, down
the large marble staircase at the <font color=blue><strong>diner's waltz</strong></font> which
followed the
reception for the new graduates -- a fresh new set of members of Her
Majesty's Navy.  No sooner did we unlink our arms, move apart, and come
back together to begin our first dance, when I felt a tap upon my shoulder.  
<p>
"Captain Paul?  Captain <font color=blue><strong>A. Paul?
I</strong></font> have a message for you, sir."
<P>
"I am he.  Who is inquiring?" I asked, looking at the
small bespectacled young man in front of me.  
<p>
"Seaman Peters, sir.  Sorry about the lack of uniform, but I was off duty
when I was called in by Admiral Knauer and told to come here to request
your presence in the Admiral's office as soon as possible."  Peters gave 
a push to his glasses, which had been sliding down his perspiring nose.  He
was visibly nervous, uncomfortable both with his lack of uniform and his
having to bother me in what was obviously an off-duty situation.  
<p>
"And what matter is this in regards to?" I asked.  
<p>
"Sir, I really haven't the slightest idea, but we really must hurry, he
stammered.  "The admiral promised to demote me <font color=blue><strong>a rank a</strong></font>
minute for every minute past nine o'clock we arrive." 
<p>
"Darling," I said turning to my fiancee, "I hope you will accept my apologies
but I must go."
<p>
Anna curtsied.  "Of course, Andrew," she said with an unhappy smile.  Despite
her obvious disappointment, her voice, <font color=blue><strong>coy, sang</strong></font> to me.  "But I
won't be held responsible if I should happen to find a new fiancee at the
ball who is not already married to the Navy."
<p>
I glanced around at men ranging from the newest graduates to the
<font color=blue><strong>old non</strong></font>-commisioned officers to the high-ranking ones, all
wearing
starched uniforms.  I looked back at her and replied "I
believe, my dear, that you are in the wrong place if you are in the market
for a different sort of man."  I bowed, and took my leave, following 
seaman Peters, hearing in the background <font color=blue><strong>a violin</strong></font> playing
the song
which should have been my first dance with Anna.
<p>

<p>
Peters was noticably relieved when he saw that we arrived before 
his deadline (eight fifty-three, to be precise).  "I brought him
<font color=blue><strong>up, sir, as</strong></font> quickly as I could, sir," he offered.
<p>
"Come on!" said Admiral Knauer gruffly, not acknowledging the fact that
Peters had spoken.  I followed, as he left his office, at a distance of three
paces with Peters an equidistant three paces behind me.  The Admiral
turned to Peters and said "Seaman!"  
<p>
Peters stopped instantly and began stammering "
<font color=blue><strong>ark... erg... ask....</strong></font>"
He looked as if he wondered whether the Admiral would let him
<font color=blue><strong>live or lop</strong></font> off his head the next instant.
<p>
"Dismissed!" commanded the Admiral.
<p>
Peters stood in his place as we
continued on, and whether he went on his own way or fainted to the ground
after we had rounded the corner, I do not know. I would say the chances were
about even either way.  Having long known Admiral <font color=blue><strong>Knauer, I</strong></font>
was well aware of his ability to strike fear into his men without having to
<font color=blue><strong>raise his</strong></font> voice.  It <font color=blue><strong>pains</strong></font> me, yet at the
same time amuses me, every time I witness this.
<p>
I followed Admiral Knauer to what looked like <font color=blue><strong>a lab in a</strong></font> part
of the building which I had never noticed before but which at a second glance
was extremely well guarded.  I watched him walk down the
<font color=blue><strong>hall, nod</strong></font> to the guards, causing them to immediately step
aside and let us pass.
"Captain Paul, you are about to see a sea ship such as you have never seen
before, something unheard of except to readers of an adventure story written
by Jules Verne back in the seventies."  I looked in the direction in which his
arm swept, and saw a strange ship, with no deck.  The ship was in a drydock,
right next to a water-filled canal that led into a tunnel.
<p>
"What you see before you," said the Admiral, "is a ship that travels
not only on the waves, but beneath them!"  My jaw hung open, incredulous.  
"The ship <font color=blue><strong>is bare</strong></font> by Navy standards.  Along the center of
the ship, the
<font color=blue><strong>aisle is</strong></font> barely wide enough for two people to squeeze past one
another.  The spartan inside is necessary
to keep the ship light, ensuring that it would be buoyant enough to return to
the surface.  For the same reason the engines are not the largest ones we had
available.  While they are effective, this ship will not be winning any speed
contests.  That steel member you see jutting out from the rear of the ship
is what we call a "<font color=blue><strong>land fin</strong></font>," those
<font color=blue><strong>loops stave</strong></font> off weight
shifts and prevent the ship from falling over when it's in drydock.  It does
not remain with the ship once it's placed in water.
<p>
"The armaments consist of <font color=blue><strong>ringed hub</strong></font> of special cannons we
have developed
for underwater firing, located at the front of the ship.  Each of these guns
fires a cylindrical charge with a <font color=blue><strong>mined top</strong></font>.  They activate
upon firing,
after which they explode on contact with a target.  The
<font color=blue><strong>"politest" cannon</strong></font>
aboard fires charges that are two inches in diameter, and the most
powerful gun fires charges that are six inches in diameter."  Again for weight
considerations, there are only two <font color=blue><strong>units</strong></font> of ammunition for
each gun 
in the hub, so there aren't too many chances at destroying a target.
<p>
I listened in <font color=blue><strong>awe, reasoning</strong></font> that a ship such as this could
revolutionize
warfare.  It was a truly amazing thing.  The Admiral interrupted my thoughts
by saying "It's yours."
<p>
"What?" I asked, incredulous.
<p>
"Time is short, and there isn't enough of it to provide an explanation.  Your
crew is already aboard and trained in the operation of the ship."  He signaled
to a man off to the side whom I had not seen until now.  The man pulled a lever
and the <font color=blue><strong>polar tug</strong></font>, a complex system of weights and pulleys
commonly
referred to by seamen as a <font color=blue><strong>big mule</strong></font>, swung the ship off of
its drydock
and lowered it into the water.  "Here are your orders," the Admiral said,
handing me an envelope.  "The canal before you runs through that tunnel and
leads to the bay outside.  Get aboard, get your ship moving out of port, and
read them when you have a chance."  When the Admiral says "Jump," you jump. 
I jumped.

<p>
<center><b>* * *</b></center>
<p>
Once we exited the tunnel, I gave the order to submerge.  I stared out a
porthole, mesmerized.  I glimpsed a giant luminescent snail
<font color=blue><strong>shell, enhancing</strong></font>
the fact that now underwater, we were in a different world.  By its glow, I
caught site of a manta ray that lay on the sea bottom, undoubtedly waiting for
a meal of some sort.  That <font color=blue><strong>ray is</strong></font> five feet long if it's an
inch, I thought to myself.
<p>
My thoughts returned to my mission.  I saw the last of the glow in the porthole
<font color=blue><strong>run by, dug</strong></font> from my pocket the sealed envelope of orders the
Admiral
had given me and turned it several times in my hands. I bent the wax
<font color=blue><strong>seal back</strong></font> to open it and read: "Captain Paul, you are to
proceed to the
following location: [A set of longitude and latitude coordinates were given.]
Once there, you are to wait.  At some time between three and four o'clock in 
the morning, a ship will pass nearby.  This ship is called <em>The Venison
Camper</em>, and is carrying enemy spies back to their homeland, an
<font color=blue><strong>acclimated nation</strong></font>
in the Middle East.  Once there, these <font color=blue><strong>tense Arabs</strong></font> will meet
with representatives of several nations' <font color=blue><strong>armies, sell</strong></font> the
secrets stolen
from The Crown, and put the security of our nation in danger.  Your orders
are to destroy it before it can reach its destination.
<font color=blue><strong>We send</strong></font> you,
our must trusted captain, with this ship, our most secret weapon.  We hope
for the rapid return of both.  Good luck."
<p>
Following the <font color=blue><strong>clean chart notation</strong></font> I read from the orders,
Jameson, 
the first mate, got us to the specified location.  Once there, we emerged from 
beneath the sea and Jameson and I went above with my spyglass.  It was dark, 
but the deck of the distant ship was well lit and I quickly found it as I 
scanned the horizon.  Lanterns by the side of the ship allowed me to read the 
name on the hull.  I glanced up at the flag, acting <font color=blue><strong>like</strong></font> a
<font color=blue><strong>vane in</strong></font> the wind which was clearly blowing in from the
south.  The scoundrels were flying 
under a British flag!  I handed the spyglass to Jameson and asked him to 
confirm.  "<em>The Venison Camper</em>, sir."  We went below and submerged as
our target approached our location.
<p>
<em>The Venison Camper</em> was nearly upon us, and I began issuing orders to
prepare to fire.  Jameson passed these orders on to the other seamen.  From a
distance 
I watched a discussion ensue and Jameson returned, looking a little nervous.  
"Sir, I've made a dreadful mistake.  I mentioned the flag I saw through the 
spyglass and now the
<font color=blue><strong>seamen want entries reread</strong></font> from the log to confirm 
that they are being ordered to fire on a ship flying our flag.
<p>
"Blast you!"  I growled.  <!-- <font color=blue><strong>Buffoons alight</strong></font> in this man's
Navy, I thought to myself...they --> What <font color=blue><strong>a buffoon!  Light</strong></font>
would be my task if only the Navy would recruit in the right
quarters.  They should never have let those
<font color=blue><strong>trainee tradesmen near sea</strong></font>
ships of any sort, let alone one such as this.  I had no doubt 
that my expression would <font color=blue><strong>evince</strong></font> my frustration and
said no more.  Time
was rapidly passing and it was nearly too late.  I reconfirmed my entry in the 
log and started ordering the crew about, bypassing Jameson out of anger and to 
save valuable seconds.  "<font color=blue><strong>Aim! Oh be</strong></font> quick about it," I
shouted.  "We 
haven't much time -- just let the <font color=blue><strong>fool gun fly</strong></font>!"  He took
<font color=blue><strong>aim near</strong></font>
the front of the other vessel, anticipating where it would be in just
seconds and fired.  Despite his self-imposed calm, because of the rush his
aiming was simply a
<font color=blue><strong>bad setup</strong></font>.  The other ship veered slightly in its course
at the last possible second; the charge missed, the <font color=blue><strong>shot near</strong></font>,
but not near 
enough, to the other ship.  It sank, whereupon it exploded upon contact
with the sea floor.
<p>
We had now informed them of our presence.  <font color=blue><strong>Wary, on</strong></font> alert,
they ran their 
engines at full power and began to pick up speed and pull away from us,
although 
they undoubtedly had no idea from where the attack was coming.  The captain of
<em>The Venison Camper</em> started to <font color=blue><strong>steer it</strong></font> erratically,
hoping to prevent
any subsequent attacks from being successful.
<p>
"With the engines we have aboard, the enemy ship will certainly outrun us," I
said.  "We've only one <font color=blue><strong>more</strong></font> chance.  As they
<font color=blue><strong>run, aim a</strong></font> barrage of
shots from all guns, to be fired on my word."  I didn't know how many direct
hits this ship <font color=blue><strong>gets per burst</strong></font> of the whole array of cannons,
but it was our
only chance.  I waited a few seconds until <em>The Venison Camper</em> stopped
accelerating, having reached its maximum speed, and yelled "Now!"
<font color=blue><strong>A slew</strong></font> of charges exploded at the same time, and several of
them struck home.  
<p>
We surfaced and I once again went above, knowing that in the dark
I would not 
be spotted.  I was glad that Jameson remained below as I was still fuming from 
the near-failure of our mission.  I saw the ship come apart; steel
<font color=blue><strong>panels</strong></font> would <font color=blue><strong>rip as</strong></font>
if made of wood because of the stress on the hull,
<font color=blue><strong>much in</strong></font>
the same way as a sheet of paper parts much more easily once a small tear 
is started.  A <font color=blue><strong>shiny tear near</strong></font> the name of the ship on the
bow was visible, 
from which an <font color=blue><strong>oily tar</strong></font>-like substance was leaking and
bubbling in a
<font color=blue><strong>frantic hoar; any cuts</strong></font> or breaches in the ship's hull were
clearly beyond repair.  
<p>
As I watched I knew that as the last part of the ship sank 
beneath the waves, <font color=blue><strong>a noise in</strong></font> a few minutes would mark
the end of <em>The 
Venison Camper</em> and its crew of treacherous <font color=blue><strong>dark men</strong></font>.
I heard a <font color=blue><strong>cry, paid</strong></font> heed to by nobody, which stopped
abruptly.  I felt my tension
<font color=blue><strong>ease, an age</strong></font> went by, and then with a gurgle the ship was
gone.
<p>
<center><b>* * *</b></center>
<p>
We sailed back home, returning from our <font color=blue><strong>sorry hike</strong></font>
out to sea and
leaving the <font color=blue><strong>headlong blight</strong></font> at the bottom of the
ocean, far behind us.  Within hours I was back in Anna's arms, telling her all 
about the events of the day that passed since I had last seen her.  The taste
in my mouth was <font color=blue><strong>acrid as I ate</strong></font> a dinner for which I was not
particularly
hungry.  Upon expressing my regret at having taken the lives of innocent people
who had been aboard <em>The Venison Camper</em>, Anna said "It sounds as if a
<font color=blue><strong>war was</strong></font> averted by your actions...surely they were
justified".  I agreed,
but was not particularly assuaged.  I apologized for not eating much of the
meal she had prepared and went off to bed, still in a melancholy mood, a
<font color=blue><strong>glib aura</strong></font> about me.
<p>
It was only the next morning that I thought putting my thoughts down as words
might help me feel better.  And so I sat down and began to write:
<p>
