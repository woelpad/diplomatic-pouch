A full year had passed for my friend Sherlock Holmes and I since
he had so expertly secured for his country the coveted prize offered
by the Sultan of Suwat, when once again we found ourselves confronted
by a diplomatic conundrum.  The year had been spent quite busy, dealing
with such incidents, as was my friend's wont, as murder, thievery,
and the protection of Crown secrets.  However, in quieter moments,
our attention was often consumed by the finer points of the game of
Diplomacy, and we began to frequent the Calhamer Club.
<P>
Being such a shrewd judge of human nature, and with a mind for the
details which escape other men, Holmes was naturally a formidable
opponent at the Diplomacy table, and indeed he frequently excused himself
from the Club's regular games; while I took what was quite often an all
too briefly held seat at the gaming table, Holmes would position himself
in one of the Club's most comfortable easy chairs, from which he
steadily surveyed the game and the participants, his lips pursed,
smoking his pipe silently.
Simply by watching the communications between the players, Holmes
would often predict without error every one of the 34 orders issued
on a turn, so astute is my friend at the art of observation and
detection.
<P>
Ever since the Sultan's puzzle, the game of Diplomacy had served only
to provide Holmes and me with a welcome diversion from the difficult
and dangerous work with which we were so often engaged.  That was
to change one quiet evening, when the great Holmes was called back into
service to decipher a cryptic message.
<P>
It so happened that Holmes and I were just embarking for our regular
Wednesday visit to the Calhamer Club when we were stopped by a breathless
Lord Fortescue, he of the Foreign Office, who had, he later said, rushed
straight over to Baker Street when the problem which faced him was first
presented to him.
<P>
"What so, Milord?" asked Holmes. "Not wishing to concede so early, I trust?
Why, the game is not yet afoot!"
<P>
The Foreign Secretary, however, was not in the mood to smile.  "I am afraid,
Mr. Holmes, that the subject of my visit concerns a concession of another
sort.  Quite another sort, indeed!"
<P>
Obviously, our visit to the Calhamer would have to wait.  Holmes called for
a messenger to inform our fellows at the Club of our predicament, and we
repaired to the
drawing room to learn what had worried Lord Fortescue so.  Once there, the
Foreign Secretary addressed us.  "I'm afraid, Mr. Holmes, that the Sultan
of Suwat has struck again with a puzzle that confounds both the FO and
Downing Street.  As you remember, precisely one year ago, Her Majesty's
government received a longterm lease on the deepwater facilities of Port
Suwat."
<P>
"Quite so," I began, "In fact,
<a href="../../S1995M/Woolley/Puzzle.html">I chronicled the event</a> in
the pages of..."
<P>
Holmes stopped me short. "Watson!  Pray allow the Foreign Secretary to
continue."
<P>
"Well, Mr. Holmes, the first annual payment on the lease is now due, and
the Sultan has requested payment using another puzzle.  I'm afraid
I must ask you to give it a look and offer assistance."
<P>
"Indeed!" Holmes seemed genuinely happy.  "This is excellent!  I was tiring
of base knavery."
<P>
"I am not sure that this is much different, Mr. Holmes.  You see, the
unusual request I speak of has been brought to England personally by
a special emissary of the Sultan, and if we do not meet the request for
payment, the terms of the lease will be broken, and the Port of Suwat may well
be transferred into the hands of unfriendly nations."
<P>
"But surely the terms of the lease were negotiated to prevent premature
calls for payment!"  I said.
<P>
"The payment has not been prematurely called, Doctor.  Rather,
you see, the
lease states only that the Crown is obliged to meet the terms of any timely
request for payment.  Never in our wildest dreams did we imagine that the
terms would be so cryptically stated."
<P>
Holmes could not suppress a smile, but I was a bit indignant at government
ineptitude.  I burst out, "Lord Secretary, do you mean to say that after the
puzzle -- a
two part puzzle at that -- which was posed by the Sultan, the negotiators
of the lease did not realize that the young man was prone to setting arbitrary
terms?"
<P>
The Secretary wrinkled his nose, "Not one of our better efforts, I'm afraid.
However, we're only just realizing that now."
<P>
Holmes spoke up.  "Now Watson, the new Sultan may be unconventional, but,
given the mystery he
posed for us when he ascended the throne, I would hardly call him arbitrary.
I am sure that this latest puzzle has a quite logical solution."
<P>
"I'm not so sure, Holmes.  Have a look."
<P>
Lord Fortescue was correct, for when he laid out on the table the very message
in question, and when we bent over it, I found myself utterly confused.
Although (happily for me) it was written in English, it bore the seal of the
Sultan, and Lord Fortescue assured us that the Sultan's emissary himself
had broken the seal when presenting the message at the Foreign Office.  As we
stood staring at the official document, addressed to the Queen herself, here
is what we read:
<blockquote>
Your Majesty,
<P>
Per the terms of the lease concluded between our two governments by our
representatives during
April of last year, I hereby request payment of the annual fee for the use
of the deepwater facilities at Port Suwat.  The terms which I impose on
this payment are detailed herein.
<P>
You will find that since our last communication, I have come to fancy myself
something of an author, and I am providing you with my most recent effort
at constructing an entertaining fiction in your most agreeable language.  I
trust that my story will aid you in meeting my conditions of payment.  I
implore you to offer me your expert literary criticism, as I imagine you
will find yourself more interested in what I have neglected than in what
I have written.
<P>
Your language is quite different from Suwati, and I find that most of my
creative time is spent in the exercise of spelling words.  Quite by accident,
I often misspell entire passages, only to notice and correct my error.  I
trust you will overlook or understand any such mistakes which may remain.
<P>
As you know, I have caused this message to be delivered to
you under seal by my most trusted emissary. He is to return to me with
the full amount of the lease payment, in pounds sterling, and
I require that your government should arrange for his return transportation.
It is imperative that you keep him and the lease payment safe under close
guard, using only your most capable military general and an armed unit.
Know that my envoy is quite seaworthy; in fact, he is somewhat disconcerted
by travel over land and wishes to travel by sea whenever possible.  I
trust that you can accomodate him.
<P>
You should know that I myself am presently not in Suwat; rather, I am
enjoying a European vacation.  As you will note after finishing my little
story, I had a number of fine locations on the
continent from which to choose, and I must say that I find myself quite
happy with my choice.  I find that I am able to enjoy the pleasures of my
home by the sea, yet what is missing -- the hectic urban life of Port Suwat
-- is not missed at all!  My emissary has been commanded not to
reveal my location to you or to your government, and so I request as a term
of payment that you independently determine my whereabouts, so as to properly
conduct my emissary to me with payment in full before the advent of the
deadline set forth in the lease.
<P>
My emissary shall also report to me the ways and means by which you have
located me.  Although I have gone to some pains to remain incognito here,
I am quite confident in your government's ability to determine my location
by means other than those I intend, and so I caution you not to return my
emissary without sufficient cause and preparation.
<p>
I am already planning my next vacation, which I have decided will be at one
of the locations that I did not choose.  Accordingly, it is my hope that
my emissary might visit these locations so that he may
find the one which best suits me.  I need not inform you that speed is of the
essence, your Highness; any lost moment or unnecessary action will surely
forfeit your fine nation of the generous lease.  I look very much forward to
receiving my emissary upon his arrival via the fastest possible route, subject
to the other conditions outlined in this letter.
<P>
On a more personal note, I wish to console you, your Highness, on the recent
disasters which have afflicted your military industrial sites, though
fortunately I am given to understand that the units which were in occupation
at the time of the mishaps were unaffected.  While I
am pleased to have learned that one such site has now been reopened, I was
sorry to hear that the damage at the others was so severe that they will not
be able to resume operations for close to a decade.  I have no doubt that your
talented engineers will be able to employ the single production site for all
of the resources your government can support while returning my envoy to
me.
<P>
As the new century dawns before us, I look forward to enjoying a long and
friendly alliance with you, etc.
<P>
The Sultan of Suwat
</blockquote>
Such was the first page of the message.  What followed, the
literary attempt by the Sultan himself, was what caught our eye.  Handwritten
by the Sultan himself came the strange narrative which I append here.
<A NAME=story>
<H3 align=center><IMG hspace=5 SRC="../../Common/Article.gif">
<a href=camper.html>Read <em>The Hunt For The Venison Camper</em></a>
</H3>
Immediately upon finishing the Sultan's story, I entered into a conversation
with the Foreign Secretary on the
ludicrousness of what was spread before us on the table.  Heatedly, we began
to debate the Sultan's sanity, and we also discussed the mood at the Foreign
Office.
I learned that some of the clerks were for setting into motion the covert
operatives in and around Europe who so proudly and humbly serve the kingdom,
so as to
locate the Sultan and enable an attempt to work backwards through his strange
tale of <em>The Venison Camper</em>.  Others there favored attempting to bribe
the Sultan's emissary.  All, of course, were behind the Secretary's decision to
take the problem to my friend in Baker Street.
<P>
During our conversation on these points, Holmes remained strangely quiet, and
eventually he asked us to cease and desist such that he could better
concentrate.  From that moment, Lord Fortescue and I contented ourselves with
our brandy, cigars, and some books we'd pulled from the shelf.  We watched as
the great detective set to work.
<P>
Sherlock Holmes drew deeply from his pipe and took the first page from the
story with him to a chair on the far side of the room.  Adjusting an oil lamp
to help him, he slowly
read and re-read the page.  Before long, he sprang to his feet, which startled
both the Lord Secretary and myself, but as it happened, this was only to
grab another page from the story and return to his chair.  Later, his visits
to the table were for the purpose of acquiring paper from a writing
tablet or a refill of ink for his pen (for he had taken to circling portions
of the story and scribbling some sort of notes as he worked).
<P>
From time to time, Holmes would mutter in the negative, but soon enough
occasional sounds of triumph were mixed in and I could actually see the
Foreign
Secretary relax in his chair and smile to himself.  The Sultan's puzzle
was in good hands.
<P>
This was proven after a time (the precise span of which I cannot accurately
recall, other than to state that Fortescue and I had started on a new bottle
of cognac), when Holmes slowly rose and announced that the lease was safe.
<P>
"Indeed?" I asked.  "How in the world could you have determined the Sultan's
whereabouts from that silly story?"
<P>
"Watson, I am surprised at you.  Why, it was elementary to determine how to
find the Sultan.  All that remained was a bit of untangling."

[<em>Editor's Note:</em> No credit for the answer unless you

</strong>
<P>
"Excellent, Holmes!  You never cease to amaze."  I simply could not contain my
excitement.  "If you gentlemen will forgive me, I
must begin making my notes,
so to faithfully reproduce this event for posterity!"  With that, I made
to leave.
<P>
The Secretary, too, having grabbed Holmes's arm and shaken it
wildly, was -- while still
in the midst of offering his profound gratitude -- gathering
up his hat and topcoat, anxious to set in motion the Sultan's wishes
and to secure for another year the rights of the British Crown to Port Suwat.
<P>
At that moment, however, a smiling Holmes softly spoke, stopping us both in our
tracks.  "Although the Sultan is surely awaiting payment there, you would be
unwise to send it directly to him."
<P>
"What?!"  Lord Fortescue and I erupted together, taken completely aback by
Holmes's words.
<P>
"I believe that delivering the emissary and payment via the correct route
is also a condition set forth by the Sultan," replied Holmes, matter-of-factly.
<P><IMG align=left hspace=5 SRC="../../Common/stopsign.gif">
<strong>What instructions did Holmes give to Fortescue to deliver the emissary
to the Sultan according to the terms of the Sultan's letter?

[<em>Editor's Note:</em> If you are still stuck on the previous puzzle and
are unwilling to work yourself unstuck,

the explanation of how Holmes arrived at the solution) is available.]</strong>
<P>
The lease, of course, was extended another year, and the Foreign Office
rewarded Holmes handsomely for his evening's labor.  The kingdom was
saved from untold expenses and, most importantly, from the loss of the
all-important Suwati port.  My friend had triumphed again.
