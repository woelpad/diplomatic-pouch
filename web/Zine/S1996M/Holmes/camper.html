The events of that evening certainly did not go as I had expected.  The
basic tale begins abruptly, but the events which preceded the
start of this narrative are rather dull and of little interest.  It was
near the end of December, 1900.  We, my
fiancee, Anna, and I, had just been announced and walked, arm in arm, down
the large marble staircase at the diner's waltz which
followed the
reception for the new graduates -- a fresh new set of members of Her
Majesty's Navy.  No sooner did we unlink our arms, move apart, and come
back together to begin our first dance, when I felt a tap upon my shoulder.
<p>
"Captain Paul?  Captain A. Paul?  I have a message for you, sir."
<p>
"I am he.  Who is inquiring?" I asked, looking at the small bespectacled
young man in front of me.
<p>
"Seaman Peters, sir.  Sorry about the lack of uniform, but I was off duty
when I was called in by Admiral Knauer and told to come here to request
your presence in the Admiral's office as soon as possible."  Peters gave
a push to his glasses, which had been sliding down his perspiring nose.  He
was visibly nervous, uncomfortable both with his lack of uniform and his
having to bother me in what was obviously an off-duty situation.
<p>
"And what matter is this in regards to?" I asked.
<p>
"Sir, I really haven't the slightest idea, but we really must hurry, he
stammered.  "The admiral promised to demote me a rank a
minute for every minute past nine o'clock we arrive."
<p>
"Darling," I said turning to my fiancee, "I hope you will accept my apologies
but I must go."
<p>
Anna curtsied.  "Of course, Andrew," she said with an unhappy smile.  Despite
her obvious disappointment, her voice, coy, sang to me.  "But I
won't be held responsible if I should happen to find a new fiancee at the
ball who is not already married to the Navy."
<p>
I glanced around at men ranging from the newest graduates to the
old non-commisioned officers to the high-ranking ones, all
wearing
starched uniforms.  I looked back at her and replied "I
believe, my dear, that you are in the wrong place if you are in the market
for a different sort of man."  I bowed, and took my leave, following
seaman Peters, hearing in the background a violin playing
the song
which should have been my first dance with Anna.
<p>

<p>
Peters was noticably relieved when he saw that we arrived before
his deadline (eight fifty-three, to be precise).  "I brought him
up, sir, as quickly as I could, sir," he offered.
<p>
"Come on!" said Admiral Knauer gruffly, not acknowledging the fact that
Peters had spoken.  I followed, as he left his office, at a distance of three
paces with Peters an equidistant three paces behind me.  The Admiral
turned to Peters and said "Seaman!"
<p>
Peters stopped instantly and began stammering "
ark... erg... ask...."
He looked as if he wondered whether the Admiral would let him
live or lop off his head the next instant.
<p>
"Dismissed!" commanded the Admiral.
<p>
Peters stood in his place as we
continued on, and whether he went on his own way or fainted to the ground
after we had rounded the corner, I do not know. I would say the chances were
about even either way.  Having long known Admiral Knauer, I
was well aware of his ability to strike fear into his men without having to
raise his voice.  It pains me, yet at the
same time amuses me, every time I witness this.
<p>
I followed Admiral Knauer to what looked like a lab in a part
of the building which I had never noticed before but which at a second glance
was extremely well guarded.  I watched him walk down the
hall, nod to the guards, causing them to immediately step
aside and let us pass.
"Captain Paul, you are about to see a sea ship such as you have never seen
before, something unheard of except to readers of an adventure story written
by Jules Verne back in the seventies."  I looked in the direction in which his
arm swept, and saw a strange ship, with no deck.  The ship was in a drydock,
right next to a water-filled canal that led into a tunnel.
<p>
"What you see before you," said the Admiral, "is a ship that travels
not only on the waves, but beneath them!"  My jaw hung open, incredulous.
"The ship is bare by Navy standards.  Along the center of
the ship, the
aisle is barely wide enough for two people to squeeze past one
another.  The spartan inside is necessary
to keep the ship light, ensuring that it would be buoyant enough to return to
the surface.  For the same reason the engines are not the largest ones we had
available.  While they are effective, this ship will not be winning any speed
contests.  That steel member you see jutting out from the rear of the ship
is what we call a "land fin," those
loops stave off weight
shifts and prevent the ship from falling over when it's in drydock.  It does
not remain with the ship once it's placed in water.
<p>
"The armaments consist of ringed hub of special cannons we
have developed
for underwater firing, located at the front of the ship.  Each of these guns
fires a cylindrical charge with a mined top.  They activate
upon firing,
after which they explode on contact with a target.  The
"politest" cannon
aboard fires charges that are two inches in diameter, and the most
powerful gun fires charges that are six inches in diameter."  Again for weight
considerations, there are only two units of ammunition for
each gun
in the hub, so there aren't too many chances at destroying a target.
<p>
I listened in awe, reasoning that a ship such as this could
revolutionize
warfare.  It was a truly amazing thing.  The Admiral interrupted my thoughts
by saying "It's yours."
<p>
"What?" I asked, incredulous.
<p>
"Time is short, and there isn't enough of it to provide an explanation.  Your
crew is already aboard and trained in the operation of the ship."  He signaled
to a man off to the side whom I had not seen until now.  The man pulled a lever
and the polar tug, a complex system of weights and pulleys
commonly
referred to by seamen as a big mule, swung the ship off of
its drydock
and lowered it into the water.  "Here are your orders," the Admiral said,
handing me an envelope.  "The canal before you runs through that tunnel and
leads to the bay outside.  Get aboard, get your ship moving out of port, and
read them when you have a chance."  When the Admiral says "Jump," you jump.
I jumped.
<p>
<center><b>* * *</b></center>
<p>
Once we exited the tunnel, I gave the order to submerge.  I stared out a
porthole, mesmerized.  I glimpsed a giant luminescent snail
shell, enhancing
the fact that now underwater, we were in a different world.  By its glow, I
caught site of a manta ray that lay on the sea bottom, undoubtedly waiting for
a meal of some sort.  That ray is five feet long if it's an
inch, I thought to myself.
<p>
My thoughts returned to my mission.  I saw the last of the glow in the porthole
run by, dug from my pocket the sealed envelope of orders the
Admiral
had given me and turned it several times in my hands. I bent the wax
seal back to open it and read: "Captain Paul, you are to
proceed to the
following location: [A set of longitude and latitude coordinates were given.]
Once there, you are to wait.  At some time between three and four o'clock in
the morning, a ship will pass nearby.  This ship is called <em>The Venison
Camper</em>, and is carrying enemy spies back to their homeland, an
acclimated nation
in the Middle East.  Once there, these tense Arabs will meet
with representatives of several nations' armies, sell the
secrets stolen
from The Crown, and put the security of our nation in danger.  Your orders
are to destroy it before it can reach its destination.
We send you,
our must trusted captain, with this ship, our most secret weapon.  We hope
for the rapid return of both.  Good luck."
<p>
Following the clean chart notation I read from the orders,
Jameson,
the first mate, got us to the specified location.  Once there, we emerged from
beneath the sea and Jameson and I went above with my spyglass.  It was dark,
but the deck of the distant ship was well lit and I quickly found it as I
scanned the horizon.  Lanterns by the side of the ship allowed me to read the
name on the hull.  I glanced up at the flag, acting like a
vane in the wind which was clearly blowing in from the
south.  The scoundrels were flying
under a British flag!  I handed the spyglass to Jameson and asked him to
confirm.  "<em>The Venison Camper</em>, sir."  We went below and submerged as
our target approached our location.
<p>
<em>The Venison Camper</em> was nearly upon us, and I began issuing orders to
prepare to fire.  Jameson passed these orders on to the other seamen.  From a
distance
I watched a discussion ensue and Jameson returned, looking a little nervous.
"Sir, I've made a dreadful mistake.  I mentioned the flag I saw through the
spyglass and now the
seamen want entries reread from the log to confirm
that they are being ordered to fire on a ship flying our flag.
<p>
"Blast you!"  I growled.  Buffoons alight in this man's
Navy, I thought to myself...they should never have let those
trainee tradesmen near sea
ships of any sort, let alone one such as this.  I had no doubt
that my expression would evince my frustration and
said no more.  Time
was rapidly passing and it was nearly too late.  I reconfirmed my entry in the
log and started ordering the crew about, bypassing Jameson out of anger and to
save valuable seconds.  "Aim! Oh be quick about it," I
shouted.  "We
haven't much time -- just let the fool gun fly!"  He took
aim near
the front of the other vessel, anticipating where it would be in just
seconds and fired.  Despite his self-imposed calm, because of the rush his
aiming was simply a
bad setup.  The other ship veered slightly in its course
at the last possible second; the charge missed, the shot near,
but not near
enough, to the other ship.  It sank, whereupon it exploded upon contact
with the sea floor.
<p>
We had now informed them of our presence.  Wary, on alert,
they ran their
engines at full power and began to pick up speed and pull away from us,
although
they undoubtedly had no idea from where the attack was coming.  The captain of
<em>The Venison Camper</em> started to steer it erratically,
hoping to prevent
any subsequent attacks from being successful.
<p>
"With the engines we have aboard, the enemy ship will certainly outrun us," I
said.  "We've only one more chance.  As they
run, aim a barrage of
shots from all guns, to be fired on my word."  I didn't know how many direct
hits this ship gets per burst of the whole array of cannons,
but it was our
only chance.  I waited a few seconds until <em>The Venison Camper</em> stopped
accelerating, having reached its maximum speed, and yelled "Now!"
A slew of charges exploded at the same time, and several of
them struck home.
<p>
We surfaced and I once again went above, knowing that in the dark
I would not
be spotted.  I was glad that Jameson remained below as I was still fuming from
the near-failure of our mission.  I saw the ship come apart; steel
panels would rip as
if made of wood because of the stress on the hull,
much in
the same way as a sheet of paper parts much more easily once a small tear
is started.  A shiny tear near the name of the ship on the
bow was visible,
from which an oily tar-like substance was leaking and
bubbling in a
frantic hoar; any cuts or breaches in the ship's hull were
clearly beyond repair.
<p>
As I watched I knew that as the last part of the ship sank
beneath the waves, a noise in a few minutes would mark
the end of <em>The
Venison Camper</em> and its crew of treacherous dark men.
I heard a cry, paid heed to by nobody, which stopped
abruptly.  I felt my tension
ease, an age went by, and then with a gurgle the ship was
gone.
<p>
<center><b>* * *</b></center>
<p>
We sailed back home, returning from our sorry hike
out to sea and
leaving the headlong blight at the bottom of the
ocean, far behind us.  Within hours I was back in Anna's arms, telling her all
about the events of the day that passed since I had last seen her.  The taste
in my mouth was acrid as I ate a dinner for which I was not
particularly
hungry.  Upon expressing my regret at having taken the lives of innocent people
who had been aboard <em>The Venison Camper</em>, Anna said "It sounds as if a
war was averted by your actions...surely they were
justified".  I agreed,
but was not particularly assuaged.  I apologized for not eating much of the
meal she had prepared and went off to bed, still in a melancholy mood, a
glib aura about me.
<p>
It was only the next morning that I thought putting my thoughts down as words
might help me feel better.  And so I sat down and began to write:
<p>
<blockquote>
<H5>The events of that evening certainly did not go as I had expected....</h5>
