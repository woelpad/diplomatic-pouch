<H3>1.  Introduction</H3>
<p align=justify>
    Jamie Dreier suggested I pen an article on the relatively infrequently
    used move "North Sea to Picardy."  I felt that this would be an excellent
    idea, since, for all my years in the hobby, not only have I never seen a
    decent article on this topic, but -- when I stopped to think about it --
    I have never even seen this rare move tried.  A proper treatise on the
    subject, therefore, seems long overdue.  And I am certainly the one who
    should write it.  So here goes.

<H3>2.  The Geographical Situation</H3>
<p align=justify>
    As we all know, the North Sea is a very important plot of muck, what with
    it bordering on both Scandinavia and the east of England.  It is important
    to note, though, that while it does border on the Low Countries, it does
    not border any German home provinces.  This is an important point to which
    we might return later in our discussion (but I doubt it).  For now, make a
    note of it.
<P align=justify>
    Picardy, meanwhile, is important geographically because of its adjacency
    to both Brest and Paris, as well as to Belgium.  Rarely entered lightly
    by France (usually only preparatory to an attack on or defense against
    England or in necessity in the heat of a battle against Germany), it is
    more often entered by a non-French power intending to invade Brest or
	Paris.  Make another note of this.
<P align=justify>
    Concluding, then, our discussion of the geographical situation, let's
    review what we have.  We see that we have two notes.

<H3>3.  The Political Situation</H3>
<P align=justify>
    To discuss the politics of the situation in which the move North Sea to
    Picardy could come about, it seems to me that we'll need to make a couple
    more notes.
<P align=justify>
    Start with this interesting observation.  The areas North Sea and Picardy
    are neither one of them supply centers.  This means that occupying either
    (or both) of these spaces (even if on a Fall turn!) will not increase (or
    even assist in maintaining) the supply center count of the occupying
    power.  However -- and this is important -- occupation of these areas
    <strong>also</strong> does not <strong>detract</strong> from the supply
	center count (one measure of political power) of the occupier.  Make a
	note of this.  Now crumple that note up.  We won't need it.
<P align=justify>
    To further discuss the politics, we must look at the different powers who
    are likely to occupy the North Sea.  Surveying the standard board, we see
    that the field is limited to only seven such powers, to wit:  England,
    France, Germany, Austria, Italy, Russia, and Turkey.  Make a note of this.
<P align=justify>
    Notice, however, that if a power has been eliminated from the game, then
    this power would not be eligible to occupy the North Sea, and this would
    tend to disqualify this power from making the "North Sea to Picardy" move
    with which we are concerned.  So all that can be said is that in a
    standard game, the number of powers eligible to enter the North Sea is
    a <em>maximum</em> of seven.
<P align=justify>
    Interestingly, the minimum number of powers eligible to do so is only two.
    The reasoning behind this is left as an exercise for the reader.  Make a
    note of this (the fact that it's left as an exercise, not the fact that
    the minimum is only two, since this is a total nonsequitur which
    will not help us at all; I don't even know why I brought it up).
<P align=justify>
<img hspace=8 align=left width=176 height=267 src=nthpic2.gif>
    Delving deeper into the discussion of which political power might be
    in the North Sea, we find a startling fact, and one which has a direct
    bearing on our further investigation into this issue.  We find that
    at any particular time, one <strong>and only one</strong> power can be
	in occupation of
    the North Sea.  It is utterly impossible, under the rules of the game,
    for two (or more) units to occupy the North Sea simultaneously.  Make a
	note of
    this.  (Whether this is a requirement unique to the North Sea or not is
    beyond the scope of this article, and determining the validity of any
	conjecture on this point would
	surely require a more detailed investigation than we can hope to
	undertake, at least without introducing a serious diversion from the
	task at hand.
    Thankfully, the answer does not affect our current discussion.)
<!br clear=left>
<P align=justify>
<img hspace=8 align=right width=176 height=267 src=nthpic3.gif>
    The North Sea could, we also notice, be vacant.  Indeed, in the admittedly
	small sample of games
    that I studied for this article, the North Sea was invariably vacant
    before the first move.  This serves as empirical proof of my point, that
    it could, indeed, be empty.  As you can see if you print this article on
	paper, I have provided ample whitespace below, which you can use to make
	a note of this.
<!br clear=right>
<br clear=left>
<P align=justify>
    Now that we've discussed which political entities can occupy the North Sea,
    let's cover the varying political reasons for this occupation.  First of
    all, Diplomacy is a game.  This means that every move of a piece, if the
    game is played correctly, should be made for the purposes of advancing
    the player toward a satisfactory conclusion to the game.  This means that
    the unit is there either for offensive or defensive reasons.  Although
    this nicely explains why someone would want to occupy the North Sea, it
    seems like a totally useless piece of information -- pure drivel, as a
    matter of fact -- so don't bother to make a note of this.
<P align=justify>
    At this point, we note one important thing which will narrow our
    quest down, and that is that the order "North Sea to Picardy" is indeed
	to be
    entered for the unit in the North Sea.  So we can feel justified in
    skipping a few steps and answering our question as follows:  the
    political reason why there is a unit in the North Sea is so that this unit
    can be issued the order "North Sea to Picardy."  Make a note of this.
<P align=justify>
    This concludes our discussion of the different political climates which
    could bring about the order in question.  Looking back at what we have,
    we see that it comes to a goodly number of notes, none of which will
    do us any good, so trash them.

<H3>4.  The Diplomatic Situation</H3>
<p align=justify>
    There seem to be three distinct possible diplomatic situations which
    could surround the North Sea to Picardy order.  I will label these,
    for lack of better names, <em>Situations A</em>, <em>B</em>, and <em>3</em>.
<p align=justify>
    In <em>Situation A</em>, also called "<em>Situation X</em>" or the
	"<em>Open (or Closed)
    Situation</em>," the power with a unit in the North Sea will issue the
    following piece of diplomatic press:
	<blockquote><em>
          "I think I will order North Sea to Picardy."
	</em></blockquote>

    In <em>Situation B</em>, also known as "<em>Situation X (but not the same
	X as that
    last one)</em>" or as the "<em>Ancient (or Modern) Situation</em>," a
	power <strong>other</strong> than
    the power who occupies the North Sea issues the following piece of
    diplomatic press:
	<blockquote><em>
          "Hey, how about if you order North Sea to Picardy?"
	</em></blockquote>

    It is possible, though extremely rare, that <em>Situation B</em> can
	actually
    cause <em>Situation A</em>.  This may be the reason why both of them are
	also
    known as "<em>Situation X</em>" (but not the same <em>X</em>).
	However, since I just made
    all these situation names up myself only a minute ago, I kind of doubt
	that it has anything to do with it at all.  So never mind.
<p align=justify>
    Situation 3, also known as "<em>Situation J</em>" and also as
	"<em>Situation j (lower case)</em>," is marked by a lack of diplomacy.
	In essence, no one knows that
	the order will be issued except the owner of the unit.  This is why the
	name "<em>Situation J</em>" was chosen.  "<em>J</em>" for "secret."
	Some people might wonder
    why not "<em>S</em>" for "secret."  Because then, that wouldn't be much
	of a secret, would it?  Get a clue.
<P align=justify>
    That's about it on the diplomacy of the situation.  There are variations
    to each situation, like for example, in <em>Situation A</em>, the owner
	of the unit
    might broadcast his intentions to enter the move in question (rather than
    just telling one or two other players).  Another variation actually has
    the owner of the unit announcing the move North Sea to Picardy and then
    <strong>not doing it</strong>.  Basically, this would mean he was lying.
	Or, at the very least, sorely mistaken.
<P align=justify>
	To recap, here is a handy diplomatic situation matrix which can be used
	to chart game situations.
<P align=justify>
	<center><table border cellpadding=3>
	<caption><b>Table 8.  Pertinent Diplomatic Situations</b></caption>
	<tr><th>Situation Name<th>Description
	<tr><th>3<td>No diplomatic information is available
	<tr><th>A<td>North Sea occupier admits NTH-Pic is coming (see note)
	<tr><th>Ancient<td>See the correct Situation X (be careful here!)
	<tr><th>B<td>Some other player suggests NTH-Pic to North Sea occupier
	<tr><th>Closed<td>See Situation A
	<tr><th>J<td>See Situation j
	<tr><th>j<td>See Situation 3
	<tr><th>Modern<td>See Situation B
	<tr><th>Open<td>See Situation A
	<tr><th>S<td>There is no such situation
	<tr><th>X<td>See Situation A (or B)
	<tr><th>X (a different X)<td>See Situation B (or A)
	<tr><th colspan=2>NOTE:  In Situation A, it could be a lie!
	</table></center>
<P align=justify>
    So we see that many diplomatic situations could surround the "North Sea
    to Picardy" move.  Recapping what we've learned in this section, we see
    that we haven't learned a darn thing.  One good thing, though, is that
    at least we didn't make any notes.

<H3>5.  Move Results</H3>
<P align=justify>
    The move North Sea to Picardy, as you can see from the discussion of the
    geographic importance of both areas, is a move which would quickly
    transfer pressure from Scandinavia and England to France.  We also see
    from our discussion of the politics, that Germany, while it touches
    neither the North Sea nor Picardy, is indeed eligible to be in the North
    Sea (although -- and if you hadn't thrown your notes away, you'd know
	this -- <strong>not</strong> at the same time as any other power).
<P align=justify>
    So a hypothetical scenario would seem to be as follows:  Germany gets a
    fleet into the North Sea, posing a threat to England and Scandinavia.
    At this point, England initiates a "<em>Situation B</em>" diplomatic
	approach,
    politely suggesting to Germany the "North Sea to Picardy" move.  As noted,
    it is possible for Germany to then respond to England with a "<em>Situation
	A</em>"
    response (though we did remark that he could be lying when he does so).
<P align=justify>
    By far, however, the most common response of Germany in this situation
    would be to laugh out loud at the "<em>Situation B</em>" message from
	England.  We
    will now look, in deep detail, at the reason for this.
<P align=justify>
    Let us assume, first, that the move North Sea to Picardy is indeed issued.
    The result of the move will be that the unit in the North Sea does not
    move to Picardy, since the North Sea is not adjacent to Picardy.  At the
	same time, any support which might have been given to the order "North Sea
	to Picardy" is rendered void.  Also, all support given to the unit in the
    North Sea, had it stayed where it was without attempting the folly of
    moving to faroff Picardy, is deemed void as well.  And finally, any
    foreign unit in Picardy which is in the act of supporting some other
    order will <strong>not</strong> have its support cut by the "North Sea
	to Picardy" move.
<P align=justify>
    These reasons offer compelling evidence that the common reaction -- to laugh
    at the suggestion of issuing "North Sea to Picardy" -- is only as popular as
    it is for good reason.

<H3>6.  Conclusion</H3>
<P align=justify>
    So now that we have looked at every aspect of the order -- geographically,
    politically, diplomatically, and at the possible results of the order --
    we see that the order "North Sea to Picardy" is among the worst order
    choices that any power could make.
<P align=justify>
    What we can do with this information is limited, but it is my theory that
    this total uselessness is one reason -- and while I am tempted to say that
	it is the <em>major</em> reason, I am not as confident as I would
	like to be in the
    depths to which I investigated -- why "North Sea to Picardy" is so rarely
    used in modern games.
<P align=justify>
    Make a note of it.
