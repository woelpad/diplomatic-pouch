<H1 align=center>The Greatness of Diplomacy</H1>

<HR>
Who knows why Diplomacy is such a great game?  We all have
our favorite aspects of it, so I am certainly unqualified to speak for all
my fellow players.  However, I wish to expound on some of the things that
I feel make Diplomacy different from other games, and to interject some of
my own feelings on why our favorite game actually <em>is</em> our favorite
game.
<p align=justify>
I was first introduced to Diplomacy in high school, way back in the late
1970's.  It was just one of the many games that my friends and I took up.
But of these games, Diplomacy always seemed special to me.  Where some of my
friends would prefer to lay out huge hex maps, throw twenty-sided dice, and
try to move little cardboard "chits" that would annoyingly shift position
everytime you breathed, I was much more comfortable, then and now,
contemplating North Sea convoys.  Why is this?
<p align=justify>
To answer this, I plan to delve into what I call "The Seven S's" -- seven
aspects about Diplomacy, each of which I have contrived to describe using a
single word beginning with the letter "S."  In the course
of listing and writing on these seven characteristics, I will also take up
a couple of other discussion points, points unique to Diplomacy, that are
near and dear to my heart.
<p align=justify>
I know that for much of this text, I'll be preaching to the choir, as it were,
but I hope that in this essay each reader can find for himself some small new
insight into the beauty of the game.  And so, if someone would kindly
volunteer to steady my soapbox, I'll mount it and begin.

<DL>
<DT><H3>1.  Skill</H3>
<DD><p align=justify>First of all, because Diplomacy lacks any random element,
it is separated from a whole class of games in which one or more
rolls of a die can determine a player's fate.
<p align=justify>
While it is true that the more
die rolls that occur in the game, the less dependent on chance is the
ultimate outcome, still you can never truly approach the independence of
chance that
Diplomacy affords.  In a game with a lot of die rolls, the chance of one
unfortunate roll deciding your fate are minimized, but runs of good and bad
luck are far from unheard of.  Even in a game such as backgammon, a player
who should win can make all the correct moves and still lose.  While some would
argue that it might be lifelike, even the <i>possibility</i> of losing through
no fault of your own makes a game, in my mind, inferior to a chanceless game
like Diplomacy.
<p align=justify>
Simply by virtue of being chanceless, I believe that
Diplomacy leaves backgammon, Monopoly, Scrabble (where the element of chance 
is minimized somewhat by the ability to re-use played letters), and other
games with ingredients of chance behind.

<DT><H3>2.  Simultaneity</H3>
<DD><p align=justify>Diplomacy stands above most other chanceless games because of the
simultaneous movement aspect of the game.
<p align=justify>
Although chess, my first gaming
love, is undeniably a great game of pure skill, it is rightly acknowledged
that a chess game between two players of completely equal caliber is white's
game to lose.  There is not quite as much fun in a game if you know that the
person you are playing against has either a built-in advantage or disadvantage.
<p align=justify>
Simultaneous movement is an absolutely perfect gaming concept.  There is no
waiting around for your turn to move, no forced decisions ("will I be allowed
to attack or forced to defend?"), and no uncertainty about what the board
will look like when you next are asked to make moves.  Every player has
exactly the same positional information at his or her disposal for every
decision.
<p align=justify>
Add to this the fact that in every move there is the possibility
of immediate failure.  All of the uncertainty that each of us feels constantly
throughout an entire game is actually manifested only in the brief moments
when moves are adjudicated.  This serves to heighten these feelings of
uncertainty and to force deeper consideration of one's moves.

<DT><H3>3.  Scope</H3>
<DD><p align=justify>Diplomacy is often called a "wargame" by the uninitiated, but that term is
much better reserved for the hex-mapped, table-driven games.  In addition to
the distinctions concerning the random element and simultaneous movement,
there is one other important
difference between Diplomacy and these other "wargames."  Simply, the scope
of Diplomacy is vastly different.
<p align=justify>
Where the so-called "wargame" can concern itself with even such details as
when a particular soldier needs to pause to rest or to use the latrine,
Diplomacy cares
only about the single action taken by an entire army or fleet.  
Personally, I vastly prefer this to being
intimately involved in the toilet habits of every bleeding infantryman.
In my opinion, the fact that small details need not be attended to affords more time
to the game player for consideration of the proper course of action.
<p align=justify>
In fact, the sweeping scope of Diplomacy is all too often misunderstood.
It is common to hear players speak of their armies and fleets as if they
truly were just a bunch of tanks and soldiers or battleships and sailors.  The
player would do well to remember that what is represented by the little
blocks on a Diplomacy board is actually something a bit different --
something more fitting to the scale of the game.
<p align=justify>
A typical question posed by players with the misconception I speak of
surrounds the convoy: "How can an army that takes six months to move from
London to Wales travel from London to Smyrna in the same amount of time?"
One result of this thinking is the so-called Army/Fleet variant rule, which
provides that armies cross bodies of water by piggybacking on the top of
fleets (which
move at "normal" Diplomacy speed).  However, the question posed above is easily
answered by remembering that Diplomacy is a <em>campaign</em>-level game,
and by realizing what this means abouabout the units on the board.
<p align=justify>
Diplomacy units represent influence more than they represent military power.
Indeed, the military power that is represented by a unit is best thought of
as <strong>potential</strong>, not actual, might.  Does the fact that
there is an army unit in Picardy really mean that there is a group of military
men in residence there?  You may be surprised by my answer, which is
"Maybe not."
Even if it <em>does</em> represent a bunch of armed soldiers, I argue that
this is only a small part of what it represents. Does an army unit in Picardy
mean that the number of soldiers there is equal in number to or that the
soldiers are equally well equipped as, say, those in the foreign army unit
that sits across the border in Belgium?  Probably not.
<p align=justify>
"Wait a minute!" I hear you say.  "Are you saying that an army in Belgium is
in any way not equal to an army unit in Picardy?"  No indeed, far from it.
What I am saying is that the two units are entirely equal because each
represents the <em>influence</em> of their owning country in that location.
If Picardy moves into Belgium but bounces, this is not the failure of a
bunch of soldiers.  This is the failure of the war council that planned the
attack while sitting at home.  It is <em>your</em> failure.  
<p align=justify>
Perhaps on a certain turn a bounced Picardy-to-Belgium move represents a
failed propaganda effort made by
underequipped covert French operatives who came up short in their attempt
to peacefully overthrow the Belgian
government (or at least failed to make the Belgian government become more
pro-French in its policies)
because the Belgian populace didn't fall for their rabble-rousing.
At the same time and on the same turn, an attack from St. Petersburg into
Norway might be a true
epic armed conflict with dead bodies scattered from the Winter Palace to Oslo,
and perhaps elsewhere around Europe and the world wherever Russian and
Norwegian interests clashed.
Both of these moves (<tt>PIC-BEL</tt> and <tt>STP-NWY</tt>)
were made on the same turn.
Both took the same amount of time (six months) in their planning and execution,
but both were radically different, if we choose to speculate on what the
actual mechanics of the "attack" may well have been.
<p align=justify>
I'm not saying that all attacks from Picardy to Belgium represent little
sabotage crews; on some turns, a full-scale bloody battle would be a better
analogy.  By the same token, every move from St. Petersburg to Norway does
not represent the shifting of massive amounts of troops.  What <b>is</b>
true is that both orders, whenever in a game they are issued, represent the
same amount of
<em>influence</em> shifting.  It matters not to the player, who takes the
role of a campaign planner, what the low-level details are that determine
<i>how</i> that influence shift is to be accomplished (or at least attempted).
<p align=justify>
I believe that my point can be made even better with fleets than with armies.
Does the fact that there is an English fleet unit in the North Sea really
mean that some number of English battleships, destroyers, and cruisers are all
sitting in the North Sea for six solid months?  No, it doesn't.  Instead,
it represents the understanding of the international community that England
<em>"controls"</em> the North Sea; that any attempt to move there (or even
to claim that any other power's <i>"control"</i> might be superior there)
will be met
with resistance.  Just as an army unit in Belgium does not necessarily
mean armed resistance, however (remembering my example that the failure of
Picardy to Belgium might not have been a military failure but one of
propaganda), the resistance
met by a German fleet moving from Holland into an occupied North Sea might also
not be military.  Yes, it <i>might</i> mean that English fighting ships, from
wherever they may happen to be (I speak here of ships that are
<b>un</b>represented on the board) mobilized to repel a true movement by German
vessels.  However, just as realistic is the prospect that <tt>HOL-NTH</tt>
could have failed <i>politically</i> rather than militarily; the "bounce"
representating simply England's (and the international community's)
condemnation of German speechmaking and sabre-rattling about that nation's
claimed control of or influence over shipping in the North Sea.
<p align=justify>
Looking at it this way, it is easy to see that a convoy is a six month affair,
just as an army move is.  Does a convoy truly represent an army getting on
and off one ship and then another, in a long chain from St. Petersburg
to Syria, and then setting foot on
ground on the other end?  No indeed.  A convoy, like any Diplomacy move,
represents a conscious decision to weaken the influence and control that
a nation exerts in one location in favor of establishing it elsewhere if at
all possible.
<p align-justify>
If you crave some human point of reference, rather than this
abstract campaign-level explanation of what is going on, you can indeed
formulate one (or many),
but you should do so knowing the underlying truth
of what a unit on the Diplomacy board truly represents.  It can represent
everything from soldiers and sailors to paper-pushers and administrators to
politicians and the press, or some combination of these.
In fact, especially in the fog of war, perception often becomes reality, and
so it is most important to
realize that a Diplomacy unit can even represent <i>none</i> of the above, but
instead be simply the <em>threat</em>, or <em>claimed ability</em>
to exert some form of nationalist
influence.  A Diplomacy unit may represent no men at all in a given location,
and instead just a fiction -- just an empty threat to unleash well-armed
soldiers, or disgruntled civilians, or sharp-tongued journalists, or any
number of other things, to exert your
influence.
<p align=justify>
Diplomacy is a game of shifting
influence, not of shifting machine-gun toting men.  While men with machine guns
are one important way in which control over a location can be represented,
threatened, and established, they are not the <em>only</em> tool of the
influence
shifter, and by realizing this, many otherwise mysterious aspects of the game
come more clear.  Why is it as easy to conquer Spain as to conquer Clyde?
Why does it take as long to travel the thousands of miles from St. Petersburg
to Norway as it does to go from Venice to Trieste?  The answer to both of
these questions lies in the fact that what a Diplomacy player does, and what
he or she should always remember as being his or her one and only role,
is to plan what a nation's resources should be used for during the upcoming six
month period.  What these resources are and where they are actually located
geographically (if in fact, they exist at all) are things that truly don't
matter.
What matters are the pressure points, represented by the units on the board.
How these pressure points are pushed around to exert one's control is all
that Diplomacy is.
<p align=justify>
All that is important is the campaign.  A Diplomacy player plans campaigns,
not battles.  It is one of the few games that is played on this level.

<DT><H3>4.  Strategy</H3>
<DD><p align=justify>What is the basic difference between tic-tac-toe and chess?  Both are
two-player games, with no element of chance, played on an unchanging board,
in which play alternates from one player to the other.  In both, a perfectly
played game between players of the same skill level will result in a draw.
In many things, tic-tac-toe and chess are very similar.  So why is chess a
better game than tic-tac-toe?
<p align=justify>
The answer actually lies below yet another
similarity.  To become proficient at either of these games requires the
ability to "look-ahead."  An adult can beat a child at tic-tac-toe regularly,
but only until the child learns to "look-ahead" one single move.  This same
adult can beat a child in a game of chess only until the child's "look-ahead"
capability meets or exceeds that of the adult.  Chess not only requires the
ability to look ahead as far as or further than your opponent (whereas
tic-tac-toe requires only the ability to look-ahead one single move, regardless
of the skill level of the opposition), but the board and pieces offer a
depth of complexity to the look-ahead process that tic-tac-toe does not
provide.  To become proficient at tic-tac-toe requires little brainpower; to
become a master at chess requires a trained and analytical mind immersed
almost completely and obsessively in chess knowledge.
<p align=justify>
Where does Diplomacy fit in here?  I would argue that Diplomacy has achieved
the proper equilibrium between these two extremes.  Perhaps on rare occasions
it is possible to envision a grand scheme, a plan for global conquest that
will take your Diplomacy power a decade or so to implement; however, the fact
is that even the best Diplomacy player can not reliably look ahead more than two
turns and even then only regionally.  The game itself enforces this.  First of
all, since every one of the pieces could move on every turn, the ability to
reliably look ahead becomes impossible very quickly.  Secondly, the game is
divided into
game-years, and the adjustment phase acts as a sort of "reset".  It is quite
extraordinary when a player has looked ahead beyond the next adjustment phase
of a game of Diplomacy,
other than, perhaps, to make his own initial, but far from confirmed plans.
<p align=justify>
I contend that the ability to "look ahead" in Diplomacy (and this only
regionally) is fairly static in
players of all skill levels, that it extends to somewhere between one
and two turns at most, and
that the genius of Calhamer put the adjustment phase where it is in order to
return all players to the same "look-ahead" level.  A player with a steel trap
positional mind would be hard-pressed to use it as an advantage in a game of
Diplomacy, since the nature of the game dictates that it would have to
<em>far</em> exceed the standard brainpower level to have even the smallest
positive effect.

<DT><H3>5.  Simplicity</H3>
<DD><p align=justify>Diplomacy is a simple game to learn.  Its mechanics are even simpler than
chess.  Where chess has six types of pieces, each with a unique way of moving,
Diplomacy has two, and other than the convoy order, both Diplomacy unit types
move the same simple way.
<p align=justify>
Because Diplomacy is more than a contest in tactics, but a contest in wills
and influence, the fact that the game is so simple to learn, tactically, is
a great plus.  A new player is quickly up to speed and testing his or her other
abilities -- those that truly determine victory -- with the rest of us.
Imagine if everyone entered the chess hobby at an equal tactical level
(on second thought, don't; you simply can't)!  The simplicity of the rules
of Diplomacy is a great equalizer.
<DT><H3>6.  Subtlety</H3>
<DD>
<p align=justify>
I am, of course, aware that the simplicity is a bit deceiving (like everything
else in the game), and that there are a good number of subtle tactical tricks.
However, no one would argue that even given these, Diplomacy is an exceedingly
easy game to learn.

The rules of Diplomacy are simple, and the board is also simple enough.
But put them together, and add some of the other ingredients of Diplomacy,
and some of the beauty of the game immediately comes out.
<p align=justify>
How many times have you played Turkey, and wished for England to assist
in an attack on Russia?  All of a sudden, you could find yourself trying to
ensure peace between France and England.  To do so, you foment war between
Italy and France, but to make this happen, you must stop Austria from
attacking Italy.  But Austria doesn't have anything else to do, so you
encourage Germany to head south and make Austria busy.  Germany can't
do so, because he's too busy fighting Russia.  So Russia will have to make
peace with Germany before you feel like you can take on the bear.
<p align=justify>
That may be a bit exaggerated, but we all know it's not far from the truth.
Sitting in Portugal with a single unit, the most important thing to you
might truly be what the Moscow army does.  The topology of the board is
tailored to enhance the interaction between players, and to force every player
to have complete interest in and a total view of the board at every turn.
The best chess players work not regionally, but positionally, on the board
as a whole.  Sure, each chess move is made by repositioning one piece
from one of the 64 squares on the board onto
another, but the best chess player has an intimate understanding of exactly
what that move
means to every other piece everywhere on the board.
In Diplomacy, obtaining this global view is also a learned skill, but the
learning of it is virtually forced by the game itself, not self-trained by
repetitive exercises and intense studies in pattern matching, memorization,
and deep-level forward-thinking.

<DT><H3>7.  Sneakiness</H3>
<DD><p align=justify>What can I say here, other than that I left one of the most important
aspects of the game until last?  As I've said, Diplomacy is a battle of
wills; each of the other six qualities I have mentioned acts to equalize
the game in each and every possible way, leaving only the player's wills
to duke it out.  Perhaps sneakiness is the wrong word, but the fact that
the wills of the players are being tested against each other is somehow
admitted by this word.  You don't need to be sneaky to win, but it doesn't
hurt.  You need to be influential, but influence can only go so far.  You
need to be trusting, but at the same time, you need to be defensive.
<p align=justify>
A debate flares every so often regarding the DIAS (Draws Include All Survivors)
rule.  Adherents of Calhamer, with whom I count myself, argue that
DIAS is the only acceptable conclusion to a game other than a solo victory.
This is because if any one player fails to win, all other players, from the
smallest to the largest, surely share the credit for denying the victory to him.
Even the single-unit power who only exists because of the kindness of a
stranger, and who has had no front with or effect on any other player,
deserves to share equally in any draw, since it was obviously a considerable
and important accomplishment for him to reach this situation.  Had he been
eliminated, or had his unit been located anywhere else on the board,
it is not unlikely that one or more of the other powers would have been
mispositioned to prevent a victory, or that some extra mistrust would have
developed between two or more other players, seriously affecting the balance
of power that brought the game to a conclusion without a solo.
<p align=justify>
There are others, though, who argue that the DIAS rule does as much to
penalize good diplomatic skills as it does to reward them.  They contend
that if a player can convince any other player to concede
the game to an alliance of his opponents,
that this is a diplomatic feat that should be allowed.  The
DIAS rule, of course, forbids this.  Consider a player who, by force of will,
convinces another player (who has a very playable position) that the
situation is hopeless, and that he should surrender the game to a set of
three other powers.  In a DIAS
game, this could never happen, and the player who otherwise might have
conceded must play the game out (and could even win or at least share in
a draw).  If Diplomacy is truly a
battle of wills, however, opponents of "DIAS-only" contend that
the ability to influence a player to give up the game to a group of opponents
should be allowed and rewarded.  I must confess that the logic of this
argument is quite convincing on its face.
<p align=justify>
Notice, however, that the DIAS rule does not forbid concession of the game
to a <em>single</em> player by <em>all</em> of the others.  Rather, it simply
outlaws concession of the game to <em>a group of two or more players</em>.
If you
think about this, the logic of the DIAS rule becomes obvious.  If two players
have worked throughout the whole game, ostensibly for a two-way draw, one
of the two players (if the DIAS rule is not used) could call for the other
players to concede to the two-way before their final elimination.  The other
player involved in this two-way alliance,
though, may have been secretly harboring an intention to stab his ally and
go for the solo victory.  Simply the ability for one player to call for a
draw may force the otherwise would-be winner to accept the unwanted draw
rather than go for his solo.
<p align=justify>
By way of example, consider a 16-center
power which is allied with a 14-center power (and has been all game), and
consider the only other power in the game as having 
four units, all in hopeless spots.  The
14-center power, if the rules allowed it, would be well-advised to call
for a two-way draw, and if the vote failed, the 16-center power would have
a hard time trying to
claim that the four-center power was the party that voted against it.
The defenses of the 14-center power, which had been lowering all game
due to the yeoman diplomatic work done by the 16-center power, are suddenly
raised again by the failure of the draw vote, and the solo victory is
snatched from the deserving would-be backstabber.<!--  It is for this
reason that I remain strongly in favor of the DIAS rule. -->
</dl>
<p align=justify>
Because so much of what it takes to be successful is embodied in this single
quality of exerting one's will via diplomatic influence, this paradoxically
leads to the one and only shortcoming of the game,
which is that is that a two-player game of Diplomacy is completely impossible.
It is hard to be sneaky when it is obvious to the other player that you're
out to get him.  It is hard to influence his moves if he knows that whatever
you want him to do is <em>de facto</em> against his best interests.
<p align=justify>
In his genius, Calhamer acknowledged this weakness by making a two player
game nearly impossible to reach.
Since Diplomacy doesn't work with two players, the standard game of
Diplomacy really is never played with two players.
Only by evenly splitting the board and
becoming exactly evenly matched can only two players remain.  If this state
is ever reached, the game is over either immediately or very very shortly.
<p align=justify>
There have been a number of efforts to create a two-player Diplomacy
variant,
but so much of the game is lost without a
third player that these efforts have only met with limited success.
I'm presently working on a two-player Payola
variant, which will at least introduce some of the uncertainty regarding
the opposition, but, unfortunately and unavoidably, the diplomatic aspect
can never be replaced without adding another participant.
</OL>

Well, there you have it.  A very wordy discussion on a number of the
strengths of the great game of Diplomacy, including a lengthy lecture
on the campaign-level aspect of the game and the re&iuml;nforcement of
the sneakiness factor by the DIAS rule.  I'll leave you with
one more
thought, which is that although each of the qualities of the game is very
important in and of itself, taken together they achieve something 
special.  The whole becomes greater than the sum of the parts, and the
result is that the game is <em>balanced</em>.
<p align=justify>
A player can be very good in the tactical and strategic skills of the
game, but can be lacking in diplomatic skills.  Another player might
be strategically weak but be an excellent diplomat.  Still another player might
have passable but unremarkable skills in all three areas.  Even though one
of these players might lose miserably to another of them in a game of Go,
that same player might beat the others handily in a game of poker.  One
can argue, however, that these (or any other) three players,
with their different talents so
varied, are still somehow evenly matched when they face each other over a
Diplomacy board.  And that's just another miracle of <em>The Game</em>.
