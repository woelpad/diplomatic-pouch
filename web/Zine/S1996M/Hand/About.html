About The Diplomatic Pouch

Here is where, according to my partners in crime, I am to "write something so
witty we'll wish we were never born...."  Far be it from me to make anyone
wish such a thing -- we all saw the grief which this caused James Stewart in
"It's a Wonderful Life" -- so I'll do my level best to avoid the dangerous
trait.
<P>
In fact, there's not much at all to report in this issue regarding the recent
history of your favorite Webrag.  Simon, Stephen, Matt, and I (collectively
known as the DP Council) all took a long and well-deserved rest after the
completion of the herculean effort which resulted in the remodeling of the
Pouch, and only recently have we come back to life other than to routinely
maintain the site.  A new issue of the Zine will do that to you.
<P>
Since I mentioned it, I will note that the various sections of The Pouch have
indeed been maintained and upgraded.  Since the last issue, a
<a href=/Zine/Registry>player registry</a>, a
<a href=/Zine/Face/maps.html>maps page</a>, a
<a href=/Zine/Face/maps.html>welcome page</a>,
and an <a href=/Zine/reviews>accolades page</a> have been added,
as has much new content in the
<a href=/Zine/Face>Face to Face</a> and <a href=/Zine/Postal>Postal</a>
sections.  Sadly, some of the grander goals for the outlying
sections of the site are no closer to completion than they were when you
first read the W1995A issue of the Zine, but we'll get to the promised land
sooner or later.  The delay is mostly due to my own overwhelming need to
rest, and so I have not followed up on the many offers I've had for help,
including everything from offers to assume the leadership of the Postal
Diplomacy section to actually physically moving the Pouch to donated space
(a must so that fancy things like the registry -- the way the registry
<b>should</b> work -- will be possible).  To those awaiting my attention,
I offer my continued apologies.
<P>
This is not to say that I haven't been busy.  I have decided that The Pouch
will someday (soon?) contain a play-by-Web section, and I've begun in
earnest to code a Web-based judge.  I've gotten pretty far, but have had to
put this effort on hold to publish this issue.  Stephen Beaulieu is also
hard at work on a companion effort, the goal being to provide some good
presence at World DipCon VI (in Columbus, Ohio this July -- I hope to see
you there!)  In fact, Stephen has provided an article for this issue on this
very subject.
<P>
The <strong>next</strong> issue of the Zine, in fact, is shaping up to be
thematic -- it will contain a lot of articles on judge coding.  In addition
to my own efforts, which I hope to complete in time for the Spring 1996 Retreat
issue, Danny Loeb's installment of his regular column for the Retreat issue
will also be on computer adjudication of moves, and Stephen will surely be
back with an update.
<P>
But enough about the future -- you're wondering what you're in for in
<strong>this</strong> issue of the Zine.  Well, okay, I'll tell you.  This
issue is also a bit thematic.  Since the Spring Movement issue is published on
or around April Fools' Day, we thought we'd have a little fun this time
around, and I trust that you'll find a few laughs scattered here and there
among the more serious efforts.  Enjoy!
<P>
<strong>Before I let you go, there is one request in particular which I would
like to make of you -- please do read the <a href=Deposits.html>Pouch
Deposits</a> column.</strong>
