It is Spring, 1915, and
the recent history of the game is as follows:
<UL>
<LI>Russia and Turkey had an ongoing alliance, by means
of which all other powers but France were eliminated. Russia and
Turkey were growing evenly. But last turn, Turkey snatched Vienna,
which Russia had left unguarded.
<LI>Turkey built three units, Russia built two (you can
see where).
<LI>The game is nopress gunboat.
</UL>
Here is a fairly obvious gloss on the position:
<ul>
<li>Turkey is a real threat to win, but he has no Sure
Thing. None of the players seems to be "crazy"; they have all
played reasonably competently, and seem to be playing "to win"
(or get into the best draw they can). Of course, you never know
what motivates people.
<li>There is a pretty obvious stalemate line that France
and Russia could shoot for, but on the other hand there are three
centers that are the obvious choices for Turkey to add this year,
and if he gets those three and doesn't lose any of the ones he
has, he'll win at the end of this year.
</UL>
Your assignment, class, is to submit moves for each power. Since the
powers cannot
communicate with each other, you are not to coordinate the moves
you submit.
<P>
I will tabulate the results of submissions. The Official
DP moves for each power will be determined by a kind of "plurality"
voting. You may, if you like, submit <I>partial</I> sets of orders; in this
case, your orders get counted toward the family of orders that
agree in all respects with yours, and a set of orders from within
the plurality family is determined without your "vote."
<P>
You should submit a single set of orders for each of the three powers in
the game; however,
<B>only one of your three order sets will be counted</B>. This selection
procedure ensures that there is no advantage to coordinating (for example)
the moves of France and Russia in your own set of orders. Your
choice of Russian moves should reflect what you think most other
people would do as France and Turkey; likewise, your choice of
Turkish moves should reflect what you think most other people
would do as France and Russia; likewise for your Russian orders.
<P>
Please don't discuss your moves with others, especially
if they are submitting orders of their own, or if they are discussing
the problem with others who are submitting orders.
<P>
Results of the tabulation will appear in the next
DP. Then each of you can see how well your orders did against
the "Average" Player.
<P>
Obviously, this is an experimental sort of puzzle.
It may fail abysmally in ways I cannot foresee. But it might be
very interesting, too.
<P>
You now have your assignment, class.  Get to work on it.
