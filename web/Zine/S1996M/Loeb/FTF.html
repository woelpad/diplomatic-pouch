As everyone knows, <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a> is
an exciting seven-player 
game played over <a href="mailto:">electronic mail</a>. Last year,
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>
heard about the 
<a
href="../../../Face/results/WDC.html">5th
World Diplomacy Convention</a>
which was being held in <a 
href="http://www.paris.org">Paris</a>.  Since <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>  was going to be <a
href="http://www.paris.org">in town</a> anyways (despite the 
<a href="http://www.paris.org/Kiosque/Greves">nationwide strikes</a>)
in order to give a series of <a 
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb/trips.html#cams">talks</a>
 on <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb/pull">Richman Games</a>
and
<a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb/stable">Stable Winning
Coalitions</a>, <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>
thought this might be a good opportunity to see <a
href="../../F1995R/Self/pbem.html">some
Diplomacy players</a> 
instead of communicating merely by <a href="mailto:">electronic
mail</a>. Perhaps the 
<a
href="../../../Face/Peery/WDC.html">convention</a>
would give <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">me</a> a good opportunity to recruit
<a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb/stud.html#sgi">volunteers</a>
for the 
<a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb/dpp">Diplomacy Programming
Project</a>. Best of all, the <a
href="../../../Face/Peery/WDC.html">convention</a>
was <a href="http://www.olsen.ch/cgi-bin/exmenu/pathfinder">free to
foreigners</a> like 
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">myself</a>.
<p>
Due to <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">my</a> <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb/trips.html#cams">other
commitments</a>, <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>
was only able to show up Saturday evening. 
The <a
href="../../../Face/Peery/WDC.html">conference</a>
was in a most appropriate location: the International
Confererence Center of the <a
href="http://www.france.diplomatie.fr">French Foreign
Ministry</a>. Even the <a
href="http://www.a-ball.com/tips/tips.html">bathrooms</a>  were
fancy-schmancy with <a
href="http://astrosun.phy.ulaval.ca/lmt/lmt-home.html">mirrors</a> all 
over the place.
<p>
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> was surprised
when <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> arrived in
the main hall. All the 
<a
href="../../../Face/Peery/WDC.html">conference</a>
participants were seated together in groups of seven around small
tables. On each table was placed a large reproduction of the 
<a href="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Maps/ColorMaps/standard.GIF">Diplomacy conference map</a> with a number of plastic
pieces on top of it. 
Were they playing some kind of game?
Intrigued, <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>
approached a table for a closer examination. The people 
crowded around the table were writing <a
href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/syntax.html">Diplomacy
orders</a>. But they 
didn't have a computer. Instead they wrote the <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/syntax.html">orders</a> directly on a
piece of paper. These papers, one for each great power in <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>,
were collected by one player. As he read the <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/syntax.html">orders</a>, the players moved
around the pieces on the board, and <!a href="judge.html">determined
the results<!/a> of the 
<a
href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/syntax.html">orders</a>
<b>manually</b> -- without the aid of <a 
href="mailto:ken@cac.washington.edu">Ken Lowe</a>'s <a
href="/DipPouch/openings/shortform.html">Diplomacy
Adjudicator</a>.
<p>
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> looked around
some more and located a long table at the end of the 
room with some computers, and people busy typing away. At last
something that <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>
was familiar with. <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> headed over to talk
to the 
people there. As they explained to me, the people at the small tables
were in fact playing <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>.
However, it wasn't the usual <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a> that
you and <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> love, but
a <a
href="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/variants.tar.Z">variant</a>
which they call  
<a
href="../../../Face">Face-to-face
Diplomacy</a>. 
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> thought that at
least the people at the computer were playing 
<b>real</b> 
<a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>, but
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> learned that this wasn't the case either! The computers were not
connected to <a
href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">internet</a>,
but served only to assign players to particular 
tables, and keep track of results. 
<p>
The organizers told <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">me</a> to have a look around. In the next room, they
had a <a
href="http://www.cnam.fr/wm/paris/hist/louvre-museum.html">small
"Museum"</a> in honor of the French <a 
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>
Hobby. Among other things they had a large collection of <a
href="../../../Postal">French Zines</a>.
These <a href="../../../Postal">Zines</a>
are pretty 
similar to the <i><a 
href="../../..">Diplomatic
Pouch</a>,
<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/spoff">The Spring
Offensive</a>, <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/DiplomacyWorld">Diplomacy
World</a>, <a
href="http://pages/prodigy.com/koehler/diplod.htm">Diplodocus</a>, </i>and<i>
<a href="http://www.iglou.com/nations/league.html">League of
Nations</a></i> 
which we are familiar with on the <a href="http://www.ncsa.uiuc.edu/General/Internet/WWW/HTMLPrimer.html">Worldwide Web</a> except that 
absolutely nothing would happen when <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> clicked on highlighted items.
(Must be a <a href="http://www.kremlin.su/~kgb">defective link</a>
somewhere...). 
These <a
href="../../../Postal">Zines</a> run games
similar to <b>real</b> 
<a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>
except the <a
href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/syntax.html">orders</a>
are submitted by regular mail to a <a
href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/how2gm.html">human
GM</a> rather 
than by <a href="mailto:">electronic mail</a> to the <a
href="/DipPouch/openings/shortform.html">Diplomacy
Adjudicator</a>. One particular <a
href="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/variants.tar.Z">subvariant</a> of <a
href="../../../Postal">PBM Diplomacy</a>
was so complicated that the <!a href="judge.html">adjudication<!/a> of each movement took a
hundred or so typewritten pages! The entire record of the game stood
as an impressive tower on the table reaching several feet in the air.
<p>
Back in the game room, the organizers of the <a
href="../../../Face/Peery/WDC.html">convention</a>
asked if <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> would like to join in.
<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/england1.htm">The English player</a> had to <a
href="../../F1995M/Nelson/Dropout.html">quit</a>
and <a 
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> could replace him. 
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> am always
interested in trying out new <a
href="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/variants.tar.Z">variants</a> (heck, there is even 
<a
href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/info.loeb9.html">a
variant named after</a> <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">myself</a>), so <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>  said yes.
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> returned the following day, and played two full games. Once as
<a href="http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~diplo">England</a> again, and once as <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/russia1.htm">Russia</a>.

<p>
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> am not the world's authority on <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>, but
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>'ve played 
<b>real</b> <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a> for
many years, and have tried many <a
href="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/variants.tar.Z">variants</a>. 
By no standards do <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> consider <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">myself</a> a pushover.
<p>
Boy, was <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> in for a surprise.
There are  several important differences between <a
href="../../../Face/">Face-to-face</a> <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>
and <b>real</b> <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>.
<p>
The biggest difference is the time limits: Whereas <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> usually have a
few days to a week to think 
       out a move (or, in the case of <a
href="../../../Showcase/dippouch.html">DipPouch</a>,
six-months), here each 
       move had to be negotiated, written, and <!a
href="judge.html">adjudicated<!/a> in only 15 minutes. 
       (Ten minutes in the case of the last game which started late.)
<p>
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>'m used to negotiating with everyone on the board nearly every turn.
Even if <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> am at war with someone, it is in our mutual advantage to
know how each other is thinking and to keep on good relations in case
something develops which give us a chance to work together.
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> always take not hearing from another player as a very troubling
omen. 
Yet here there simply wasn't time to talk to all <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">my</a> neighbors, let 
alone everyone on the board.
<p>
In the first game, the previous <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/england1.htm">England</a> had allied with France.
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> saw that France
was benefitting from the alliance more than <a href="http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~diplo">England</a>, 
and might soon be in a position to stab <a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/england1.htm">England</a>, but <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> had to submit
<a
href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/syntax.html">orders</a>
immediately. France kept on talking with me. And <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> didn't know 
how to talk to <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany.
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> couldn't imagine
stabbing France without 
at least some token reassurance from <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a>, yet turn after turn
France purposely wasted all the negotiation talking to me, or at least
staying near <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">me</a> talking to third parties. If <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> couldn't talk to
<a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a>, perhaps <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> could at least slip him a note. <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> wrote "Please
support Ruh-Bur", and focused on trying to slip him the note without
France seeing. <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> wasn't able to do it that turn or the next, but
finally <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> did succeed during a moment of inattention by France. <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> was
so happy until <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> saw the perplexed look on <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a>'s
<a 
href="../../../Face/">face</a>. <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> then 
turned back to the board. <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a>
had been driven back so far that he 
was no longer in any position to support a move of mine. France was
now poised to finish off <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a> and stab me.
<p>
As in <b>real</b> <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a> the
players came from all sorts of 
countries, mostly France, but also Sweden, Spain, <a
href="http://www.agora.stm.it/Ed.Mattei/home.htm">Italy</a>, <a
href="http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~kebl0110/Diplomacy">England</a>, etc. 
However, without the
<a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/syntax.html">standard
notation</a>  imposed by the <a
href="/DipPouch/openings/shortform.html">judge</a>,
everyone 
spoke a slightly different dialect of "<a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>".
And without the 
leisure of having a long time to digest a diplomatic missive, it was
difficult to understand the other players references to "the 'Ilands"
(Clyde) or "Benelux" (Holland and Belgium). <a
href="../../W1995A/Sund/foreign.html">These
misunderstandings</a> 
not only were a waste of time, but also sometimes led to involuntary
nonverbal cues that could be misinterpreted as signs of
treachery.
<p>
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> often felt that
any hesitation on <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">my</a> part could be
seriously 
misinterpreted by <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">my</a> negotiating
partners. 
<p>
Another difference is that due to tournament time constraints,
all games are concluded in  1906.
Obviously this greatly changes the nature of the game.
To take an analogy from <a
href="http://www.cs.ruu.nl/~hansb/d.chessvar">chess</a>, this is like
having a chess tournament in which all game are terminated after 10
moves for each side and points are attributed to each player according
to how many pieces he has left. At the end of the game, <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>  might
capture a protected pawn with my queen knowing full well that my
opponent wouldn't have time to capture it.
<p>
One of the nice paradoxes in <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a> is
how you can't get anywhere 
without an alliance, but every alliance is doomed to break down at
some point, since only one player can win.
In a six-year game, the point at which allies are forced to turn
against each other might never be reached, so there was a fair amount
of "<a href=
"../../S1995M/Shoham/CBRus.html"
>Care-Bear</a>"
play.
<p>
On the other hand, standings are determined by the momentary supply
center placement at the end of 1906. Thus, it is perfectly reasonable
to stab a player for one-center in 1906 even though he would be
capable of inflicting far greater retaliation in 1907 were the game to
continue.  The last year of the game did in many ways look like a
free-for-all, including transfers of supply centers between "<a href=
"../../S1995M/Shoham/CBRus.html"
>Care-Bear</a>" allies to maximize their total score / tournament rank. 
<p>
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> have the habit of taking over very weak abandonned positions
and turn them around by taking advantage of the balance of power to
keep the game going long enough for <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">me</a> to catch up.
Here, balance of power considerations simply did not exist.
<p>
After two poor performances as <a
href="http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~diplo">England</a>, <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> was happy to draw <a  
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/russia1.htm">Russia</a>
for 
the third game. Perhaps <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> could try the <a
href=
"../../../Online/Openings/Russia.html#rus-northern"
>Northern
Opening</a> that had been used against <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">me</a> in the previous game.
Since play started late, there was discussion of shortening the game
to 1905. <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>
suggested stopping the game immediately so that <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> would be 
the winner with four supply centers. In the end, it was decided to
maintain the original length but with shorter negotiation periods.
<p>
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> was immediately approached by a very aggressive <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a>.
He demanded loudly that <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> <a
href="../../../Online/Openings/Russia.html#rus-northern">commit
two forces to 
the North</a> and prevent 
<a href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/england1.htm">England</a> from taking Norway, otherwise he would stop <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">me</a> from taking
Sweden. Despite his aggressive tone, <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> said <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>'d try assuming <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> could
arrange a suitable security arrangement in the South. He took up a lot
of <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">my</a> time, but
eventually <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> got 30
seconds to speak to <a
href="http://www.agora.stm.it/Ed.Mattei/kaus.htm">Turkey</a> and  
arranged <a
href="../../S1995M/Pitt/BigDip.html">a
DMZ</a> with him.
<p>
1901 turned out to be a disaster. <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> was attacked by all
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">my</a> neighbors 
and end up with only three supply centers (and it could have been two
had Austria guessed correctly concerning Rumania).
<a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> never recovered from this dreadful start.
<p>
<a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a> continued to
deceive <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">me</a> turn after turn usually to little point. Once, while
reading <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/syntax.html">orders</a>, <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> saw that Austria had supported a <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">German</a> move against
me. <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> asked <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a> if he had actually made the <a href="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/syntax.html">order</a> which had been
supported. He said no and approximately two seconds later it was
revealed that <a
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a> had indeed ordered that move.
<p>
My situation more or less <a href="../../S1995M/Mous/Survival.html">stabilized</a> after <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> ceded Sevastopol to
<a href="http://www.agora.stm.it/Ed.Mattei/kaus.htm">Turkey</a> in
exchange for peace. However, <a
href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> kept on reeling from
one 
crisis to another, and in 1906, <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> was everyone's favorite choice when
looking for an extra center to help them in the standings. At
least in the end <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a>
was able to  help <a href="http://sable.ox.ac.uk/~diplo">England</a>
against <a  
href="http://ourworld.compuserve.com:80/homepages/spoff/germ1.htm">Germany</a>.

<p>
Oh well, it was an interesting <a
href="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/variants.tar.Z">variant</a>,
but <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> think <a href="http://www.labri.u-bordeaux.fr/~loeb">I</a> am going to stick with <b>real</b> <a
href="../../.."><i>Diplomacy</i></a>.
