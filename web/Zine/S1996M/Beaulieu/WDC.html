<h2 align=center>The Diplomatic Pouch and<BR>World Diplomacy Convention VI</h2>
<h3 align=center><em>by Stephen Beaulieu</em></h3><hr>
<p>This year's <strong>World Diplomacy Convention VI</strong> in Columbus, Ohio
should be the first WDC
to enable the electronic Diplomacy community to check up on it, and in some
cases even participate, while in the comfort of their own presumably distant
homes.  We will
achieve this goal through the medium of the Internet, allowing us to
provide Web based and e-mail updates of the goings-on in Columbus as well as
enabling us to introduce PBEM play to postal and face-to-face players.  We plan
on having a small suite of computers available on site, providing access to the
<strong>WDC VI</strong> Web pages, and to the Web and e-mail based Diplomacy
adjudicator we will
bring with us.  The goal is to showcase a limited number of Internet games
between members of the convention and fellow dipsters unable to attend, for both
the enjoyment of the participants and for the instruction of those unfamiliar
with or unaware of PBEM diplomacy.

<p>The services we hope to provide are:
<ol>
<li>A <strong>Diplomatic Pouch</strong> special website for <strong>WDC
VI</strong> that will include updates on
the progress of each face-to-face game played at the convention, especially
the Championship games.  The website will also detail upcoming events of the
player's groups meeting at the Convention.
<p>
<li>A daily newsletter listing the day's achievements and the next day's events
for
game participants, interviews with the participants and sponsors, and anything
else deemed important.
<p>
<li>A network of computers allowing participants to explore the
<strong>Diplomatic Pouch
WDC VI</strong> website, and even contribute to the <strong>WDC VI Web
Journal</strong>, a special series of
daily articles concerning the convention.
<p>
<li>A fast e-mail and Web based Diplomacy adjudicator running several showcase
PBEM
games, and introducing realtime Web-based diplomacy games to the Diplomacy
community.  Possible showcase games include: standard realtime, nopress games
between convention goers and outside participants, a Payola variant game, and
(if all goes well) a standard nopress game involving Danny Loeb's Bordeaux
Diplomat,
a computer Diplomacy player.  Depending on availability, interest and bandwidth,
many other games may occur.
<p>
<li>Listserver and e-mail versions of the <strong>WDC VI</strong> website
articles and the daily newsletter.
<p>
<li>Whatever else for which we can find the time, energy, and volunteers.
</ol>
<p>To make all of this happen we are depending on loans of the computer
equipment
from other dedicated Diplomacy fanatics in and around Ohio.  If you are such a
person, please <A HREF="mailto:hippo@mail.utexas.edu">contact me</A> at your
earliest convenience.

<h3>The Judge</h3>

<P>Those of us from the PBEM diplomacy community are already very familiar with
Ken Lowe's Diplomacy Adjudicator.  The Judge is a fundamental part of our 
dip experience.  But it does have it's limitations.  Currently the judge does
not support access to games over the World Wide Web, only through e-mail.
While it is true that many people who take part in judge games 
might not have the bandwidth to particiapte via the Web, many do.  Increasingly,
people have expressed interest in the Web as an appropriate venue for Diplomacy.

<p>The members of the DP Council agree.  So much so, in fact, that separately we
are in the process of writing two new judges that will support Web based
Diplomacy.  These judges will allow players to use either the Web or e-mail to
get
current game status, send moves, press, and (hopefully) receive press via the
Web.
<p>The two new judges will both support identical user interfaces, so that
knowing how to use one judge will allow you to use the other.
<p>The two judges being worked on are:
<ul><li><strong>The DPjudge</strong><br>Written by <A
HREF="mailto:manus@manushand.com">Manus Hand</A>.  This judge uses the cross-platform
<A HREF="http://www.python.org/">Python</A> interpreted language and will be
useable on any machine for which a Python interpreter exists.  Currently this
includes many UNIX, Macintosh, Windows, and LINUX systems.<p>
<li><strong>The BeJudge</strong><br>Written by <A
HREF="mailto:hippo@mail.utexas.edu">Stephen Beaulieu</A>.  This judge is for the
new BeBox computers from <A HREF="http://www.be.com/">Be, Inc.</A>, and will
take
advantage of it's completely multithreaded, multiprocessing, realtime operating
system.</ul>
<p>We should be using a version of the BeJudge to run the games associated with
<strong>WDC VI</strong>.
<p>These judges, along with Danny Loeb's Bordeaux Diplomat and others, will be
the main topic of discussion for the Spring 1996 Retreat issue of the Pouch.  Be
sure to check in on us in June to learn more details.
