The Payola Variant -- Put Up or Shut Up
</H2>
This issue, I'm going to continue examining interesting variants which are
implemented on the Internet judges (or, if not fully implemented, at least
supported in some fashion).  One of the newest, and most enjoyable, variants
is Payola.  I had the good fortune to playtest this "pay for play" variant
in the eponymous game 'payola' on the USEF judge, and I am also GMing the
ongoing game 'arnold' on the same judge.  The variant has been revised and
updated several times since its inception and is now very robust.  Payola
can be implemented as an adjunct to any other variant; one of the best
(though most demanding on the GM) is the Tin Can variant combining the Blind
variant with Payola.  You haven't lived until you've tried to bribe units
you can't see and aren't even sure exist...
<P>
The single focal point for all Payola games is the Website
<a href=/dpjudge/payola>Payola Place</a> (part of
The Pouch's Web- and Email-based
<a href=/dpjudge>DPjudge</a>).
<P>
(Disclaimer:  neither the fact that Payola is the brainchild of this
publication's august editor nor the fact that I owe him large sums of money
and he recently sent a few "friends" to visit me at my home has anything
whatsoever to do with the fact that I'm discussing Payola or any nice
comments I might make...honest.)
<H3>Overview</H3>
The basic thrust of the Payola variant is simple: you have to bribe units
to perform actions.  If yours is the highest bribe, the unit will perform
the order you give.  If you bid too low, you lose control of the unit.  You
can make offers to any unit on the board; yours as well as your allies' and
enemies'.  By the same token, they can make offers to yours with results
that may not be pleasing to you...  The bribing process only applies to
movement phases.  Retreats and adjustments are handled in the normal fashion.
<H3>Income</H3>
Your bribes are made in silver pieces (AgP) and come from the bank account
maintained for you by the GM.  You accrue monies to your account by virtue
of the supply centers you own.  Deposits are made to your account once a
year, after the Winter Adjustment phase.  There are two sub-variants of
Payola which determine how money is accrued.  In the original, Fixed Income
sub-variant, you earn 7 AgP for each SC you own.  In the newer (and more
common) Diminishing Returns sub-variant, you earn 17 AgP for your first SC,
16 for the second, 15 for the third, and so on.  Thus, in the Fixed Income
sub-variant, England starts with 21 AgP, while he'd start with 48 AgP in the
Diminishing Returns sub-variant.  However, as England grows to, for example,
10 SC's in the Fixed Income sub-variant, he grows at a steady 7 AgP per SC
rate for a total of 70 AgP income, while he'd receive proportionately less
per SC in the Diminishing Returns sub-variant, receiving a total of 125 AgP
at 10 SC's.
<H3>Bribing</H3>
Now that you have money, you have to spend it in order to make more money.
The neat trick of the Payola variant is that you get to bribe your
opponents' units, too.  Or, at least you get to try...
<P>
In the original variant, bribes were simple -- I'll pay you this much to do
this order.  That worked well enough but it was somewhat limited.  So, Manus
spake and lo! different types of bribes were bestowed upon us.  Now we
could really get tricky.  The format of the bribe offer is:
<blockquote><tt>
<strong>&lt;Amount of AgP&gt; &lt;Bribe Type identifier&gt; &lt;Order&gt;</strong>
</tt></blockquote>
The various types of bribes are:
<UL>
<LI>Affirmative Bribe: I'll pay you to do this order.
The bribe type identifier for this type of offer is
'<tt><strong>:</strong></tt>'
<LI>Negative Bribe: I'll pay you to do anything except this order.
Type identifier is
'<tt><strong>!</strong></tt>'
<LI>Move Bribe: I'll pay you to do this order or any other order which is
<strong>not</strong> a Hold, Support, or Convoy.
Type identifier is
'<tt><strong>></strong></tt>'
<LI>Hold Bribe: I'll pay you to do this order or any other order which is
<strong>not</strong> a movement order.
Type identifier is
'<tt><strong>@</strong></tt>'
<LI>Gift Bribe: I'll pay you to do this order or any other order you feel like
doing.  Type identifier is
'<tt><strong>*</strong></tt>'
</UL>
<H3>Order Resolution</H3>
Okay, so now you know how to earn money and how to spend it.  How do the units
decide what to do?  Simple.  Bribe offers are submitted as press to the GM
and he runs them through an adjudication program. The adjudicator compares
all offers, combines multiple offers from different players for the same
order (e.g. if France and England both offer <tt>F&#160;ENG</tt> 6 AgP to move
to <tt>NTH</tt>, the
total offer is 12 AgP), determines which offers are the highest, and then
issues appropriate orders to the units.  These orders are sent to the judge
and processed as normal (keep in mind that just because a unit accepts an
offer to perform a certain order doesn't mean that the order will succeed
when all orders are processed -- in the example above, <tt>F&#160;ENG</tt>
may try to go to <tt>NTH</tt> but it could still bounce with another unit
trying to go there).  This
process of sending offers to the GM as press and running them through the
adjudicator is being automated and will soon (we hope) be handled directly
by the judge.
<P>
The above is a brief overview of the Payola variant, and while it covers the
essential points, the interested reader is encouraged to take a look at the
<a href="/Zine/W1995A/Payola">official rules of the variant</a>, which were
published in the Winter 1995 Adjustment issue of the Zine.
<H3>Strategy Tips</H3>
Now that the mechanics of the variant are clear (they are clear, right?),
I'm sure you're all waiting with bated breath (and, phew!, some of you
should change the bait!) for ideas on How to Baffle your Enemies and
Impress your Allies (tm).  Well, far be it from me to disappoint you.
Keep in mind, however, that Payola is a relatively new variant and I make no
claims to an exhaustive analysis.  Anyway, here goes.
<H3>What's the Point of all Those Different Types of Bribes?</H3>
The Affirmative bribe is simple and straightforward.  It works best when
there is only one thing you want a unit to do and you are sure you have
enough cash to make it happen.  It is the most commonly used bribe, both for
your units and those of your opponents.
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border>
<caption><strong>Affirmative Bribe Example</caption>
<tr><th>England<td><tt>5 : F ENG H
<tr><th>France<td><tt>2 : F ENG - LON
<tr><th>Germany<td><tt>2 : F ENG - LON
</table></center>
<P>
England's greater expenditure on the affirmative bribe ensures that
<tt>F ENG</tt> will hold.
<P>
The Negative bribe is also simple and straightforward.  It is used when you
don't care what a unit does as long as it doesn't do the one thing that will
mess up your plans.  It works best when the unit you're trying to bribe is
also likely to be offered multiple bribes from other players, ensuring that
your negative bribe will be enough to put one of those over the top.
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border>
<caption><strong>Negative Bribe Example</caption>
<tr><th>England<td><tt>5 : F NTH - ENG<BR>6 ! F BRE - ENG
<tr><th>France<td><tt>8 : F BRE - ENG
<tr><th>Germany<td><tt>3 : F BRE S A BEL - PIC
</table></center><P>
England's negative bribe to <tt>F BRE</tt> was sufficient to ensure that
Germany's offer succeeded even though England may have had no idea what
Germany's order was.
<P>
The Move bribe is a bit more complicated but not extremely so.  It is used
primarily when you want to prevent a unit from holding, convoying, giving
support, or receiving support.  If you have a wish to invade an occupied
space, bribing the unit which is currently there to move out (allowing you
to move in without support) is an effective tack.  Again, this bribe type
is most effective when the unit
you're bribing is likely to be receiving multiple offers and yours works to
favor the bribe type you want.
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border>
<caption><strong>Move Bribe Example</caption>
<tr><th>England<td><tt>4 > F ENG - BRE
<tr><th>France<td><tt>8 : F ENG C A BRE - LON
<tr><th>Germany<td><tt>5 : F ENG - MAO
</table></center><P>
England's move bribe was sufficient to ensure that <tt>ENG</tt> did not
convoy <tt>BRE&#160;-&#160;LON</tt>.  It did not succeed in ordering
<tt>ENG&#160;-&#160;BRE</tt>, however, since Germany's was an
affirmative type offer for
<TT>ENG&#160;-&#160;MAO</tt>, which was the order that
<tt>F&#160;ENG</tt> would have received.
Also, note that England would have failed in stopping the convoy if Germany
had instead offered
<tt>4&#160;:&#160;F&#160;ENG&#160;S&#160;A&#160;BEL&#160;-&#160;PIC</tt>
since that would not have been a movement offer by Germany.
<P>
The Hold bribe is sort of like the move bribe, except in reverse.  It is
used when you don't care what the unit does so long as it doesn't move.
There are times when you very much need a unit to stay where it is, either
to gain control of a supply center, hold a line, or to receive support.
As with negative and move bribes, it works best when the unit is receiving
multiple conflicting offers and your hold bribe is designed to favor the
success of the bribe type you desire.
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border>
<caption><strong>Hold Bribe Example</caption>
<tr><th>England<td><tt>4 @ F ENG - BRE
<tr><th>France<td><tt>8 : F ENG - LON
<tr><th>Germany<td><tt>5 : F ENG S A PIC - BRE
</table></center><P>
England's hold bribe coupled with Germany's support bribe ensure that
<tt>ENG</tt> does not move to
<tt>LON</tt>.  Since Germany's bribe will earn the unit nine pieces of silver
and England's would earn it only four, <tt>ENG</tt>
will be supporting <tt>PIC</tt> to <tt>BRE</tt>.  Note, however, that even
if England's offer had been for a greater amount than Germany's offer
individually, ENG would still end up supporting <tt>PIC</tt> to <tt>BRE</tt>
since the affirmative bribe offered by Germany does not add its amount to any
order other than the offer listed, but the hold bribe does.
<p>
The Gift bribe, at first glance, appears to be sort of silly and have no
practical use.  However, in reality, it functions as a proxy order and can
be extremely useful in no-press games or in any game where proxy is not
otherwise enabled.
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border>
<caption><strong>Gift Bribe Example</caption>
<tr><th>England<td><tt>2 : F BRE - PIC
<tr><th>France<td><tt>1 * F BRE - ENG
<tr><th>Germany<td><tt>2 : F BRE - MAO
</table></center><P>
Both the English and the German offer have a total value
of 3 AgP (since the French silver piece will be given no matter what), so
what will <tt>F&#160;BRE</tt> do?  Well, that depends on how the
owner of the fleet in Brest (let's say it's France) set his
"acceptance list."  And what is an acceptance list?  Each player must submit a
acceptance list at the start of the game and may update it at any time.
The acceptance list is submitted in the same
format as a <tt>SET PREFERENCE</tt> command, and it is used to break
ties on offers.  If
France's acceptance list was set to <tt>FEGIATR</tt>, England's offer would take
preference over Germany's and the unit will be ordered to move to Picardy.
<H3>But How Much Should I Spend?</H3>
Yeah, I know, you've got all this money and great plans for spending it, but
you don't know how much to spend now and how much to save for later.  If you
spend too much now, you'll end up with too little at crunch time.  If you
spend too little now, you'll have lots later but nothing useful to spend it
on.  In order to decide how to spend, you need to keep two things in mind.
<P>
First, you and everybody else will be getting more money each year or, rather,
you will if you still hold any SC's.  Thus, your primary goal is still the
same -- get those SC's.  If you save 5 AgP's this year but fail to get the
extra SC that would have earned you an additional 10 AgP's, you haven't
spent wisely.  When in doubt about spending a few extra AgP's, ask yourself
if spending them will take or protect an SC.  If so, spend them.
<P>
Second, the amount of money in circulation.  You can never know exactly how
much money is in circulation except prior to the first turn.  However, if
you pay close attention to how much you have to spend in order to
successfully bribe your own units, how your attempted bribes of other units
are accepted or rejected, and how much others spend to bribe your units, you
can get a very good sense of how much your opponents are spending every
turn.  This, in turn, gives you an idea of total cash still in circulation,
as well as the current bid break points.
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border>
<caption><strong>Expenditure Example</caption>
<tr><th>You started last turn with...<td>40 AgP
<tr><th>For your own three units, you bid an average of...<td>5 AgP
<tr><th>For your own units, your success was...<td>2 out of 3
<tr><th>For two opposing units, you bid an average of...<td>5 AgP
<tr><th>For opposing units, your success was...<td>1 out of 2
<tr><th>Money paid by other(s) to your rebellious unit was....<td>7 AgP
<tr><th>So you offered a total of....<td>25 AgP
<tr><th>And ended up spending....<td>15 AgP
</table></center>
<P>
From this, you can reasonably determine that
<ul>
<LI>Your 40 AgP is about average (maybe a little less than average) for
all bank balances at the start of last turn,
<LI>Five silver pieces is a little low for bid break points, while six or
seven AgP is about right and eight AgP should work on just about anything,
and
<LI>At least some of the other players now have less money than they did
(since two of your offers were rejected).
</ul>
A general rule of thumb in the early game is to spend everything you have,
every year.  This is particularly important when lots of unclaimed SC's are
up for grabs and will probably be cheaper to get than when they are owned by
someone else.  A corollary to this rule is to spend half of everything you
have in the Spring, and half in the Fall.  One common error is to spend just
a little in the Spring with the intention of spending big in the Fall.  The
problem with this is that you can't spend usefully in the Fall if you're not
in a position to take any SC's.  Spring phase is actually more critical than
Fall because you must have a dominant position after the Spring in order to
be effective in taking SC's in the Fall.
<H3>Overspending (or Living Happily Beyond Your Means)</H3>
One interesting rule which is very important to note:  you are allowed to
make bribe offers for more than the amount you have in the bank.  The reason
for doing this is to allow you to anticipate the fact that some of your
bribes may be too low to be accepted.  If you bid too low on one bribe, all
of the funds targeted for that bribe will sit idle during that phase.  On
the other hand, if you assume that some bribes will fail and you feel able
to guess the amount of those which will fail (if not the specific offers),
you can still make large bribes for all units to ensure that those that
succeed will be the highest bid.  For example, examine these two different
sets of English offers:
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border>
<tr><th colspan=2>English account balance: 21 AgP
<tr><th>Offer Set 1<th>Offer Set 2
<tr><td><tt>6 : F ENG - NTH<BR>
5 : F LON S F ENG - NTH<BR>
5 : F HEL H<BR>
5 : F WAL - ENG
<td><tt>7 : F ENG - NTH<BR>
7 : F LON S F ENG - NTH<BR>
7 : F HEL H<BR>
7 : F WAL - ENG
</table></center>
<P>
In the first example, England has spent exactly what he has in his account.
If all of his offers are the highest bids, he's in good shape.  However, if
one of them fails, he has lost the use of those funds for that turn and,
since he didn't allocate extra funds for the other offers, he increases the
chances that they will also be too low and will fail, as well.
<P>
In the second example, England has overspent, assuming that one of his
offers will fail.  If he's right that exactly one of them is doomed to failure,
he still uses all of his available funds and is more likely to be the high
bidder on the other offers since he has spent more on them.  Unfortunately,
if he's wrong and all of his offers are accepted, he will overdraw his account
and all offers will be reduced one silver piece at a time until they are low
enough to not overdraw his account.  In this case, his offers
would first be reduced from 7 AgP each to 6 AgP each, and then all the units
would look again to decide if this is still the best offer on the table.  If
so, the Englishman would still overdraw his account (paying four bribes of
six silver pieces each), so they would all be reduced yet again, now down
to five silver pieces each.  <strong>All</strong> offers
are reduced equally, not just enough of them to get below your bank balance;
that's the penalty for guessing wrong.
<H3>The Power of One</H3>
Have you ever found yourself wishing in a standard game that you could
control just <em>one</em> of your enemy's units?  Just make that <em>one</em>
unit do your bidding because it would bollix up <strong>all</strong> his
plans?  Well, in Payola you can do just that.  This one factor changes the
entire strategic concept of the
game.  It is critically important that you consider this point when planning
your offense and defense.  For example, examine the following position:
<P>
<table cellpadding=3>
<tr><td><img src=map1.gif>
<td>
Normally, Russia would be in a world of hurt, but in Payola, all the Russian
player needs to do is control the German <tt>A&#160;SIL</tt>.  If he is able
to get that unit to <tt>HOLD</tt>, none of Germany's other armies are going
anywhere.  Better yet, if Russia can be sure he controls <tt>SIL</tt>, he also
need only control <tt>F&#160;LVN</tt>, not <tt>A&#160;WAR</tt>.
If <tt>A&#160;SIL</tt> and <tt>F&#160;LVN</tt> both <tt>HOLD</tt>, then
<tt>A&#160;WAR</tt> can roam without concern for Warsaw's safety.
<P>
Germany, on the other hand, must not only control <tt>SIL</tt>, he must also
control <tt>WAR</tt> and <tt>BER</tt>.  Although his position is tactically
superior, the mercenary effect of bribes in Payola puts him at a significant
strategic disadvantage.  He'll need a large bank account to roll over Russia
from this position.
</table><P>
Two interesting side-effects develop from the ability to control key opposing
units (and your opponents' ability to control yours).  Let's take a look at
these.
<P>
First, since your own units can be used against your interests if you don't
control them, it is often wise to waive builds.  If a new unit will not
immediately assist in gaining and holding SC's and if its presence could be
used to block your desired movements, don't build it.  For example, examine
the following position:
<P>
<table cellpadding=3>
<td><img src=map2.gif>
<td>
If Turkey has a build pending, he should waive it.  If we assume that he
desires to take Sevastopol, any build in Ankara (his only available home SC)
could be
used against him by blocking <tt>SMY&#160;-&#160;ARM</tt>.  If he builds in
Ankara, he needs to control <strong>both</strong> <tt>SMY</tt> and <tt>ANK</tt>
to ensure he gets <tt>ARM</tt>.  If he waives the build, he needs to control
only one unit to achieve the same goal.  Since he'll be
trying to control the units from the same limited supply of funds and since
the extra unit doesn't really help him take or defend an SC, he can save
money by waiving the build so that he doesn't have to spend to control the
extra unit.
</table><P>
Second, there are no stalemate lines in Payola.  Since any unit will act on the
highest bid, no unit can be trusted to hold a stalemate line.  The net
result of this effect is that Payola games are much more likely to end
in solo victories.  <em>[Editor's note:  at
the time of this writing, every Payola game ever played has ended in a solo
victory.]</em>
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
Well, there you have it.  A (not so) brief and (not so) thorough examination
of the Payola variant.  In case my fondness for the variant hasn't been made
clear yet, let me tell you that I've been playing in at least one Payola
variant game ever since the variant's inception.  I've yet to hear any
significant negative feedback and I've noted that most players who try it
once will return for further Payola games at the first opportunity.  I strongly
encourage you to give it a try.
