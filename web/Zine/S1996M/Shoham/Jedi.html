Broadcast message from J-Jedi Knights in hgwells:
End of Game Summary
Game:    HGWells, USNM Judge.
Variant: It Came From Outer Space II, Anonymous.
Outcome: J Win in 1907.
Power:   J-Jedi Knights, from start.
I've won HGWells by focusing on the distinct topology of the map and the
role-playing potential of the variant.
When Dan Percival first told me about the ICFOS variant, what appealed to
me most about it is it's inherent fairness. All players start out equally.
Furthermore, at a later stage, the game becomes much like a normal game
with the same map and same legal moves (I later discovered that this is
not true). I helped Dan sharpen the variant definition and clarify the
text (with minimal, I hope, interference with the basic concept of the
variant - which I considered brilliant). I also modified the prologue and
some of the terms used (introducing, for instance, the term 'colonization').
Naturally, I joined HGWells as soon as it was formed.
Being a Star Wars fan, I was certainly going to have a Star Wars name.
Now, "everyone knows" that Darth Vader has the best lines ("I'm altering
the deal. Pray I don't alter it any farther", "Perhaps you think you're
being treated unfairly?", or "I find your lack of faith disturbing").
However, since I never underestimate the propaganda value of the good
side :), and since I value winning more than having great lines, I "settled"
for the Jedis. Much to my delight I discovered that someone else has
assumed the role of the Evil Empire. Better yet, his first broadcasts
indicated extensive familiarity with the Star Wars universe. I knew there
is now someone whom I can have a common language with. The Diplomatic
course of the game became instantly obvious. Role-play with the Empire
while maintaining official hostilities for the benefit of everyone else
until there are (effectively) only the two of us left, and then stab
for the victory. The first part was so obvious, that even before I had
a chance to suggest this to the Impies, he had already suggested it to me!
A sub-plot of this strategy was that I should gradually "lose" the
role-played game. At first Luke would give tentative signal that he isn't
quite sure about which side of the force he is on (like an "inadvertent"
signing of a message as "Luke Vader"), and later the outright conversion
of the princess to the Dark side. It looked like a good deal to me: I'll
"throw" the role-play game and in return win the Diplomacy game...
Tactically, three observations struck me as significant. The first is the
relatively small number of players. It suggested that there would be
several seasons of "expend-as-fast-as-you-can-into-neutral-centers"
before players are forced to fight it out amongst themselves. The second
was the likely dearth of fleets. None to begin with, and only a few likely
to be later built. The third was the fact that through the connectivity
of orbits, far away segments of the boards are actually well coupled. These
three observations drove me to employ a strategy I was sure others would view
as unsound: I was going to drop my three armies far apart. Specifically,
I dropped them at SMY, TUN, and StP. (As a side benefit, this may have
helped create an impression that I'm not exactly an expert player).
I knew those beachheads wouldn't be endangered by anyone during the
early fast-expansion stages. Why would anyone attack occupied
centers and make enemies while there are plenty of free neutral around.
(It will only slow his and his victim's growth while everyone else cheers.)
After this early expansion, each of these beachheads would have several
units to help. Despite the apparent isolation and hence weakness of these
beachheads, they would actually be well connected to the rest of the
Jedi force through the orbit. Throughout the game I made sure that there
was almost always at least one army in orbit, and hence flexible amongst
the beachheads.
Another benefit of this "beachheads which look isolated and weak" strategy
was that I could surge into the lead with less fears of suffering from the
dreaded "Early Leader Syndrome". In each beachhead region I could play the
role of a junior "helping" partner - sharing in the gains without threatening
the leader.
Also, I placed a priority on shipbuilding. The ships would round out the
defenses of my beachheads and eventually provide an offensive option. With
the overall dearth of fleets, they provided me with a flexibility unavailable
to the other players.
Since each beachhead - in itself - was weaker than the powers it bordered,
the Defensive deployment of the beachheads was a high priority.
This deployment rested on four mutually reinforcing pillars:
1. Garrison armies were left behind to defend the beachheads perimeter.
2. Fleets stayed near the beachheads to block naval invasions and,
more commonly, to help secure the beachheads perimeter garrisons.
3. Heavy colonization defended the perimeter from any spaceborne invasion.
Often a province would be colonized repeatedly to prevent any chance of
someone else decolonizing it (in any event, the garrison armies and nearby
fleets usually had nothing better to do).
4. Orbital units were on standby to come to the aide of any attacked beachhead.
None of the beachheads was ever seriously challenged. Perhaps it was
because of Diplomatic accomplishments, but I'd like to think that the
multi-faceted defenses of the beachheads also played a (deterrence) role.
I was happy to see that none of the other players noticed the inherent
logic of spreading one thin in this game. Each one has landed in a
compacted region. The Terrans in England, the Empire in Austria, the
X's in the Balkans, and the Berserkers in France. It was furthermore
clear to me that each of them would try to spread out in a contiguous fashion.
This prediction proved valid with the exception of the Terrans who hopped
over directly from England to Russia (obviously 3 armies in England would
have to expand non-contiguously, but I expected them to head for some
Western shoreline - like the Lowlands). My Tunis beachhead should be able
to take much of Italy, my StP beachhead take much of Scandinavia, and
my Smyrna beachhead take much of Turkey - before any serious fighting
started. These expectations mostly came to pass, with only the Turkish
beachhead pressed into battle prior to fully establishing itself (see below).
'X', aka "The Psychic Physicists from Planet Cosine X", for some reason
totally unfathomable to me, have decided to pick a fight with the Empire.
Soon after Vader announced his intent to land in the Balkan (too
close to Turkey for my comfort), X insisted he get this region.
Why couldn't he just choose any of the vast unclaimed regions on
the board? I've no idea. At first I thought he might be trying to carry
favor with ME - given the "known" hostility of Jedis and assorted Evil
Empires. However, he never said a word of the kind to me, so I dropped
that speculation. I suggested to the Empire that he land in Austria and
that we crush the psychos (a "derisive" term I've used for X when
communicating with the Empire) between his Austria and my Turkey (never
pointing that "his Austria" is his entire empire, while "my Turkey" was
just one unit!). While this forced my Turkish unit to fight a little
sooner than I hoped, I judged this to be a good development. The
Jedi-Empire alliance would be cemented over the ashes of X, while
still not being TOO overt. Also, I would get a disproportionate part of
the booty when one considers the amount of forces invested.
(In other words, by splitting the looted X centers anywhere near
evenly with the Empire - the deal would be much to my advantage
since for him this will be [nearly] all of his growth, while for me
it would be the exploits of but one of my three beachheads).
It worked. By the time Planet X was being finished off, in 1903-4,
I gained control over all of Turkey, all of Scandinavia, half the Balkans,
and most of Italy. In addition, I had naval exclusivity in the entire
Mediterranean, and naval "sufficiency" in the Scandinavian region.
I was also heavily colonizing in the regions I controlled.
It was time to move on.
The Berserkers and the Terrans have started a war (actually, the
Berserkers started it) just as EJ were preparing for new conquests.
(*begin evil laughter voice*) How convenient? (*end voice*)
The Empire and myself agreed to continue our policy of secret cooperation
while publicly propagandizing against each other. I would "ally" with
the Berserkers, and the Empire would "ally" with the Terrans. Each
of us will gain at the expense of the other's ally. To help smooth
my performance, I also lied to the Terrans (by obtaining "permission"
before sending units to "help" them defend England). It worked quite
well. The Empire was growing, and I was growing even faster.
In my communications with the Empire - which were always role-played -
I begun to seriously "lose" to the Dark Side of the Force. The princess
has wholeheartedly embraced the Dark Side of the Force and with her
much of the rebel fleet turned to aggression and savagery. This was in
preparation for the next stage of the game: Open coordination with
the Empire. This stage arrived in 1905.
Tactically, the position was not one that would easily lend itself to a
two-way draw. I had a multitude of distinct advantages over the Empire.
Not only did I have 3 more units than the Empire, but I also had a much
higher colonization rate, a navy (in fact, I held naval supremacy in all
seas!), and much of the edge of the board at my back. The position was akin
to a noose tightening around the entire board. (This is a position which
could not normally develop in a standard Diplomacy game and hence debunked
my expectation that the late game will be very much like a standard game).
I have thus presented the appearance of one who is so tied down
to the role-playing aspect of the game as to forego any victory chances
that may be present. The twist on the Star Wars story of the Princess
turning to the Dark Side (which wasn't far from happening in the real
story) and then joining her father in destroying the Emperor (who has
foreseen that *a* "young Skywalker" would destroy him) to rule the galaxy
like father and daughter seemed compelling enough. I would have to look
like this *is* my goal in the game.
An ultimatum was presented to all players to accept a 2-way draw between
the Empire and the Jedi. Naturally, I voted AGAINST this draw every season.
The Berserkers have desperately tried to get me to fight the Empire again.
Perhaps the intent was to get me to stab pre-maturely and then give him a
chance to ally with everyone in a stop-the-Jedis coalition. I responded in
more role-playing talk about an internal Luke-Leia conflict which is rocking
the rebel alliance. The effect of it is that I'll give him the chance
to confront the Empire while consolidating my position in his area (and
even colonizing some of his centers without taking them). Perhaps the
anti-Imperial actions of the Terrans of the last year of the game
represented a similar, although not explicitly spelled out, policy.
Taking advantage of the tacit help I was getting from the Berserkers,
and the Empire's being completely lulled (or at least acting that way),
I was setting everything up for a stab-to-win in the Fall of 1907. The
lack of ANYONE doing ANYTHING at all to check my progress in the Spring
of 1907 meant that the Fall victory was forced, and that in fact I won
with two spare centers.
On the whole, the game was fun. I had a chance to show off my Star Wars
familiarity, and to add-lib Diplomacy relevant messages into SW dialogs.
I also composed a few stories that involved other themes (Hamlet [Michael,
want to comment on that one?], and during the Christmas break, A Christmas
Carol) imported into the SW universe. It was fun and challenging
to play the game without once leaving the role-play mode. I was glad
this style was reciprocated by most players most of the time.
As far as the variant goes, I have a few comments. First let me say
that it is a great variant and I wish it be coded :). I think that the
rule change that allows beam-down on top of hostile forces is an
improvement. I also think that the rule de-colonizing the provinces of
a dead empire is bad and should be rescinded. Also, I see no reason to
limit the capacity of "orbit" to three armies. Other than these VERY MINOR
tinkering, I think the variant is great. I'd certainly play it again.
I'd like to thank Dan Percival for introducing this variant, for
generously listening to my suggestions and modifications to it -
including some that can best be characterized as "whim", for moderating
this game by hand, and for keeping it moving. I even feel a little guilty
for not moderating an ICFOS game myself as to allow Dan to play (sorry,
I don't do hand-moderation. I'll be glad to moderate a game if [when?]
ICFOS is judge-coded). I'd also like to thank Dan for not getting
discouraged as I kept pointing move-resolution errors to him :-(
I would also like to thank the other players for keeping the game
moving and the role-playing lively and well. I'm sure that if Dan was
reading the partial press, he would have found it time well spent.
When the players list was made public, I was rather surprised to find
that I've played with and privately conversed with every single one of you.
I've even meet one of you in person (Hi!). Particular thanks go to Eric,
the Psychic Physicist, for also being the keeper of this judge. (I now
understand why HGWells didn't apply for EP status. I certainly don't
need a proof, but if anyone does, the fate of Planet Cosine X makes it
obvious that there were no problem with Eric in this game).
Dan Shoham, Jedi Knight.
