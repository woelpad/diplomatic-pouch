Broadcast message from E-Galactic Empire in hgwells:
Why am I not surprised that Dan was the Jedi?
I too would like to offer my thanks and congratulations to
Dan Percival; this is an exciting variant, even in 1901 (something that
is rarely the case in standard games), and one that offers very strong
role-playing possibilities.
Actually, it was this latter point that drew me to ICFOS in the
first place.  As at least Dan Shoham can attest, I am an inveterate
role-player, and always find myself looking for good opportunities
to indulge this hobby.  ICFOS was a natural variant for it.  As I
told Dan Percival immediately when I joined the game, I wanted to be
the Galactic Empire from Star Wars.  Personally, I have a tendency to
like the villains from space fantasy.  I won't cite any further
examples in case we have another gunboat ICFOS in the foreseeable future!
I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised that someone else
chose a Star Wars persona as well, given the intense popularity of the
films when they were released.  The initial rivalry between the
Empire and the Jedi was genuine, though, and for this reason I was
glad to see the Jedi spread out thinly.  I decided it would be some
time before I would have to worry about a serious threat from them.
In this I was right.  I had to wait until 1907 before this was the case.
My concentration in Central Europe was fairly straightforward;
I wanted access to the Balkans in a hurry.  I also felt that keeping
my forces together would be better than spreading them thinly, as
the Jedi did, because I anticipated more of an attempt to eliminate
some players while they were weak, despite the availability of free
centers.  While this did not happen on a wide scale, something like
it did occur between Eric and me.  Given our proximity, and
Eric's limited opportunities for growth, I would not have been
surprised if outright war would have resulted shortly, in any case.
When one of my forces couldn't land, of course, a German landing
was the next best thing.  It was completely open, on the one hand, and
yet close enough that I could build up a decent defense before someone
else came exploring.  Once I had secured a place on the planet, I
had to take care of my first concern -- the Cosines.
Working with the Jedi seemed the best opportunity.  Few would
expect it, on the one hand, so he seemed like the ultimate choice for
a long-term secret alliance.  On the other, he was the only one who could
assist me against the Cosines, who did have more forces than I did in
the Balkans.  Given that I had more to lose in the battle against the
Cosines, I was willing to gain a little less than I might have insisted
on in order to secure it.  The plan whereby the Jedi would build most
of the fleets also seemed like a good idea at the time, reflecting
the very common arrangement where Austria builds only armies and
Turkey only fleets.  Since I was a Central European Power, there was
less of a direct threat.  Furthermore, once the Terrans began to beam
into Russia, I thought the Jedi might actually be slowed down
somewhat in their expansion.
As we proceeded to endgame, however, I began to be concerned
about the Jedi's numerical superiority.  Not only did he have more forces
than I, but he was also in a much better position to stab.  This,
paradoxically, is why I never tried to coordinate with the Berserkers
against the Jedi.  While the Berserkers' fleets were busy in England,
and his armies were stuck with me between him and the enemy, the
Jedi could snipe at me at will, and win shortly.  In addition, I could
not rule out the possibility that the Berserkers might try to give
the Jedi the win, after I had attacked Venice.  So, I had to try to
wipe them out as soon as possible.  Unfortunately, this made it
necessary for me to behave as if I trusted the Jedi more than I did.
Several times I almost sent Vienna to Budapest or Galicia, only to
decide against it, in case such action might prove counter effective,
provoking the stab I hoped to avoid.  I also considered getting
involved in Russia, when the Terrans were still strong enough to
be a factor, in the hope of prolonging the Jedi's progress towards 18,
but again, such an action would at best show my hand as far as my
unease was concerned, and at worst, would be seen as interference that
could provoke retaliation.  So, I was left with the option of trying
to take down the Berserkers as soon as possible, and only hope that
I could do so before a Jedi attack.  In the end, I expected it least
when it actually occurred, only because the successful Jedi colonization
on Berserker territory could just as easily have been an attack.
I find it interesting to note the Jedi policy of "losing the
role-playing game to win the Diplomacy game".  I will say that I
certainly enjoyed the role-playing aspects very much, but in itself
it didn't convince me of a solid alliance.  Actually, Leia-converted-to-
the-Dark-Side would be more likely to betray an ally than Luke-remaining-
true-to-the-Bright-Side!  But on the other hand, looking at the two
games separately, the role-playing aspect didn't work out badly for
me, at least.  Earth is peanuts for the Galactic Empire.  The Emperor
is dead, so it seems fair to guess that Vader is in charge.  The war
with the Rebellion goes on, but who knows how it ends?  Incidentally,
Dan's policy in the role-playing side reminds me of an old issue of
the Star Wars comic book, back from around 1980, when Leia went to a
Switzerland-like planet to get a loan for the Rebel Alliance, using
the Crown Jewels of Alderaan as collateral.  Vader arrived, to prevent
the loan.  In the end, Leia beats Vader, gaining the loan and providing
evidence that he had a weapon on his person, which would get him
kicked off the planet.  But Vader walked off with what he was REALLY
after -- he stole the Crown Jewels themselves!
By the way, no comment about Hamlet -- those were two entirely
different games!!
And now, I should probably conclude with a final message in
the Vader persona, since this was what I originally joined the game for:
Vader stood by the console, seething as he watched the course of
the battle.  "So, Luke has had his hand in this all along...."
Turning to Admiral Piett, he said, "There is no further point in
staying here.  Begin preparations for a mass evacuation."  Turning then
to General Veers, he added, "I want to leave nothing but scorched earth
when our forces leave.  Destroy everything of value that we cannot
take.  I will not contribute any more to the economic strength of
the Rebellion."
Upon hearing that the Terrans supposedly hijacked a Death
Star, he approached Captain Jerjerrod, asking, "What is it that they
have actually taken control of?  We do not *have* any Death Stars at
present."  Tracing through several screens, Jerjerrod replied, "It
would seem that they've captured their own moon.  It's strange that
they, of all people, should make that mistake."  "True," Vader
responded, "but it suggests a course of action.  I believe that it is
time that we constructed another Death Star.  Properly this time.
I am appointing you its Moff; planning will begin immediately.
However, we will not use the ideas that Palpatine was considering
before he died.  Security must be our highest priority.  We can worry
about trapping the Rebels after it is completed."
And then he walked back to his private quarters, musing, "And
the Rebels will find it more difficult to remain in complete concord,
now that the character of its leadership has changed.  Leia will find
that the Dark Side has a way of keeping those who turn to it.  It is
easier to resort to deception and betrayal than to turn away from it.
Sooner or later, she will be back...and she will be on our side!"
