<H2 align=center>...It Came from Outer Space!</H2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
 
I have been involved in a couple of discussions about whether or not
the Diplomacy board is naturally biased to certain powers and alliances.
The Pure variant is an attempt to make a perfectly even game, but a wrong
guess can mean a very short game for a particular player.  Besides which,
we don't get to play on our favorite game board....
<p>"...It Came From Outer Space!" is an attempt to make a completely level,
unbiased game that still brings to play all the subtlety and manuverings
of the Standard board.  Another advantage it offers is that it may be
played by an unlimited and unspecified number of players greater than one.
 
 <H3>Premise</H3>
<p>The time is 6782 nanorotations of the galaxy since the first spacefaring
 creatures reached a tentative tentacle to grasp for the stars.  The passage
 of time since then has been marked by peaceful colonization and expansion,
 punctuated by the occasional disputed claim.  Effective cloaking devices 
 have made warfare in space impossible, and the rare wars that have been fought 
 have taken place on the surface of the various disputed planets.  Barren
 planets -- the only
 kind ever found -- are plentiful and not usually worth fighting for; the 
 process of making them habitable is so costly that the resources extracted 
 barely recover the expenses.  Additionally, the populations that such
 planets can support are negligible.
<p>The various galactic empires, with their populations bulging, are in
 serious danger of decline and fall.  All are sure that the first empire to
 discover and colonize a habitable planet will be well positioned to
 reverse its decline and soon dominate the galaxy....
 
<p>On one small and otherwise nondescript planet, the population is celebrating
the dawn of a new
 century.  Certain inventors are just beginning to dream of atmospheric
 flight, and others have begun to experiment with electricity and
 radio.  Little do they know that these experiments are being detected deep in
 space and are attracting attention.  The chance to colonize a habitable planet
 is more than any race can afford to pass up, and it should be no wonder that
 races from all across the galaxy are converging on this planet called Earth
 with colonization plans and armies to enforce them.  Some races plan to
 cooperate, while others are preparing for all-out war....
 
 <h3>Rules</h3>
<dl>
<DT><strong>1.  Scope</strong>
<DD>
<li>All rules, including victory conditions, are as in standard Diplomacy,
	except as follows.
<li>Any number of players may play the game, each taking the role of the
	leader of a Galactic Empire.
<li>The game starts with an empty standard game map.  In addition, each
	Empire possesses one spacecraft in orbit, bearing three armies.
	<P>
<DT><strong>2. Spacecraft</strong>
<DD>
    <li>A spacecraft in orbit may contain up to three armies at any time.
    <li>Spacecraft may only contain armies of their own empire.
    <li>Armies occupying a spacecraft in orbit may either hold or beam
		down to any land province.  No other order is allowed.
    <li>An army beaming down may be supported by other units. If other
       units are attempting to enter the province, the unit with the
       most uncut supports get through. In a tie, all units bounce.
       (Same as a normal Diplomacy movement.)
    <li>Armies on a land space may beam up to a spacecraft
		during the movement phase.
    <li>Fleets may not be beamed (battleships are just too heavy).

<P>
<DT><strong>3. Colonization</strong>
<DD>
  <li>Natives of the land provinces may be introduced to the alien race
	  culture, industry, and technology. This process is called
	  <em>colonization</em>.
  <li>A unit may be ordered in the movement phase to colonize
       either the land province it is in or any land province to which it
	   could legally move.
  <li>A colonization attempt succeeds if the province in question is
       occupied by the colonizing empire at the end of that turn.
  <li>A colonization attempt also succeeds if the province in question
       is vacant at the end of the turn and no other empire attempted
       colonization or movement into that province that turn.
  <li>Once a colonization effort succeeds, the province becomes a colony
       of the colonizing empire. It loses all colonial attachments it
       may have had in the past. This is the only way (other than elimination
	   of the colonizing power) to destroy a colony.
  <li>The colonize order does <strong>not</strong>
	   change the ownership of a supply center for counting up centers for
	   growth.
<P>
<DT><strong>4. Jamming</strong>
<DD>
  <li>Armies may <strong>not</strong> attempt to beam down into provinces
	   that are colonized by other empires.  Only an army owned by the same
	   power to have colonized a province may attempt to beam down to such a
	   province.  This is known as "jamming."
  <li> Units that are not protected by being in a jamming colony may be
        attacked from outer space.  Any support being offered by the unit
		being attacked will be cut per standard Diplomacy rules.
<P>
<DT><strong>5. Retreats</strong>
<DD>
  <li>Armies may retreat only to orbiting spacecraft or to colonies of
	  their empire.
  <li>Fleets may retreat only to sea zones or to colonies of their empire.
<P>
<DT><strong>6. Adjustments</strong>
<DD>
  <li>Supply center ownership is determined after each Fall season in the
	usual way, and units are built or removed according to standard rules
	as modified here.
  <li>New units may only be built in unoccupied supply centers that are
       both owned <strong>and colonized</strong> by the building empire.
   <li> When an empire is eliminated, any colonies it owns revert
        to their original neutral status (that is, all empires may beam
		down into them, and no empire may retreat to them).
  <li>The colony status of a supply center province does not affect
	  ownership, but it is important to realize that if an Empire has
	no colonized supply centers, it cannot build, regardless of how many supply
	centers it owns.
<P>
 <dt><strong>7. Notes</strong>
<dd> 
<li>One quirk of small (2-6 player) games is that growth tends to be
 exponential until room on the board starts to run out.  Thus, it is very
 important to get a quick hold on supply centers and colonize them early
 on to give yourself a stable base to work from.
<li>It is impossible to have more than three armies after the growth phase
 of the first year.
<li>For purposes of writing orders, spacecraft in orbit are designated as 
 Orbit or ORB.
<li>The Colonize order (also known as "brainwash" or "assimilate") can be
abbreviated as COL.
