Broadcast message from T-Terran Undergrnd in hgwells:

Nice stab, J!

Summary of my participation in the game: An experimental strategy for
a new game...eventually it failed, so I went out in style (or tried to).

I thought that if I secured an area from beam-downs, then I would be
safe.  I forgot about attacks from the water, and that the time I spent
securing my area meant less builds, while everyone else was busy snatching
up the real estate.  I *definitely* did not expect to be attacked by
B and J at the same time!  Fortunately, I was able to slide to my new
Russian holdings, and die slowly...by the time I was done, the game was
over.

(And the Terrans aren't too bad off...they've traded a planet for a Death
Star.)
