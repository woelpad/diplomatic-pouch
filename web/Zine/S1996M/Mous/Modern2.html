<H3>Brief Introduction</H3>

  In the <a href="../../W1995A/Mous/Modern.html">last issue</a> of the Zine,
  you read about the background to the Modern variant, the 
reasons I created it, and a brief introduction on how to get started playing 
it. Since then, there have been at least half-a-dozen new modern games 
started on various judges, from the Yugoslavian judge to the one in 
Indiana. Most games are still on USEF, so that is perhaps the best place to
look if you are thinking of trying it out.
<P>
  Part of the fun in playing a new variant is the unknown aspect of a new 
battlefield, with new alliances, balances of power, and a myriad of 
positions. You can prove your worth as an innovative tactician, a brave 
pioneer in this new world, leaving your mark forever in the annals of 
Diplomacy. This is a place where your true worth can be tested, where you 
can only rely on yourself, not on what others have done before you.
<P>
  But perhaps you find yourself overwhelmed by the many possibilities? 
Perhaps you would like a guide to show you where to start? Or maybe you 
would just like to see some ideas so you can think them over, play with 
them in your mind, and formulate a brilliant plan which will take you all 
the way to victory?
<P>
  I have therefore decided to compile a list of openings for all the powers 
in the Modern variant. These will include both those used in actual judge 
games, and those I have come up with myself or that I have used or seen
used in 
face-to-face Diplomacy. As the variant is still young, it is hard to say 
which opening is the best, or even if the best opening (if there is such
a thing) is in the list that I will present,
so keep your eyes and minds open for new possibilities.
<P>
As the GameMaster of many Modern games, I asked
players for their opinions on strategies for the various powers in the modern 
variant, but also to propose some openings and to suggest a name for them.
  The subject of this article, then, is a list of the different openings
 and some strategies used for Britain in the 
Modern games that have been played until now, as well as a few untried
openings and strategies that may be of interest.
The winning name and the name of the person suggesting the name both appear
along with each opening.
<P>
  I am still looking for comments about strategy and opening names for 
the countries other than Britain, so feel free to send your thoughts and
suggestions to me at <a href=mailto:vim2@rocketmail.com>vim2@rocketmail.com</a>.  Find yourself
and your ideas included in a subsequent article or update in this series.

<H3>List of Openings for Britain</H3>

<DL>
<DT><strong>Mornor Opening (Mark Sawicki), also known as the "Classic"</strong>
<DD>
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Liverpool -> Irish Sea.             (Irish Variant)<BR>
Fleet Liverpool -> North Atlantic Ocean.  (Atlantic Variant)<BR>
Fleet Edinburgh -> Norwegian Sea.<BR>
Fleet London -> North Sea.<BR>
Fleet Gibraltar -> South Atlantic Ocean.
</blockquote></tt>

About this opening, Mikko Laitinen says, "This is a straight-forward way to
assure two sure builds for the winter; 
Ireland can be taken  from Irish Sea, Norway with a combination/support of 
Norwegian Sea and North Sea, and Morroco from South Atlantic Ocean. 
 Gibraltar will most likely go to the Spaniards, especially in no-press 
games.  With press I would be tempted to exchange Morroco for Gibraltar but 
I have no ideas how this is likely to succeed."

<P><DT><strong>Channel Crossing</strong>
<DD>
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Liverpool -> Irish Sea.<BR>
Fleet Edinburgh -> North Sea.<BR>
Fleet London -> English Channel.<BR>
Fleet Gibraltar -> South Atlantic Ocean.
</blockquote></tt>

Mikko Laitinen comments, "This is a viable opportunity when one wants to go
anti-French and has a 
support from Germans to take Belgium.  Otherwise Germany can get a 3 units 
to support his own move to Belgium so there is little point in fighting 
with him of it.  The fleet is more needed in the north, where together with 
a Fleet in the Norwegian Sea they assure Norway."
<P>
Simon Withers remarks that "the (Channel Crossing) risks not taking Norway
in exchange for added influence in Belgium. Not worth it in my opinion."


<P><DT><strong>The Rock (Simon Withers)</strong>
<DD>
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Liverpool -> Irish Sea.<BR>
Fleet Edinburgh -> Norwegian Sea.<BR>
Fleet London -> North Sea.<BR>
Fleet Gibraltar HOLD.<BR>
</blockquote></tt>
This is an attempt to keep the Rock, Gibraltar, while foregoing the chance 
of taking Morocco in the first year. It will work if Spain assumes that 
Gibraltar will move out and doesn't move the Barcelona fleet to Andalusia. 
 The northern part of the opening ensures the capture of Norway and 
Ireland. This is a conservative opening - keep the home centers and be sure 
of taking what you attack. Even if the defense works however there is no 
chance of a build in Gibraltar.


<P><DT><strong>House of Lords</strong>
<DD>
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Liverpool HOLD.<BR>
Fleet Edinburgh HOLD.<BR>
Fleet London HOLD.<BR>
Fleet Gibraltar HOLD.<BR>
</blockquote></tt>
A strange opening which doesn't get much done. Thus, the name.

<P><DT><strong>North Sea Fork</strong>
<DD>
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Liverpool -> Irish Sea.<BR>
Fleet Edinburgh -> Norwegian Sea.<BR>
Fleet London -> English Channel.<BR>
Fleet Gibraltar -> South Atlantic Ocean.<BR>
</blockquote></tt>
Britain foregoes the North Sea to move to the Channel and Norwegian Sea 
instead, and on to the Mid-Atlantic and Norway. With this opening, Britain 
tries to get cordial relations with his northern neigbours of  France, 
Russia and Germany while moving for a quick attack on Spain.


<P><DT><strong>Andalusian Defense</strong>
<DD>
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Liverpool -> Irish Sea.<BR>
Fleet Edinburgh -> Norwegian Sea.<BR>
Fleet London -> North Sea.<BR>
Fleet Gibraltar -> Andalusia.
</blockquote></tt>

Another opening in which Britain attempts to keep Gibraltar. It will work 
if Spain moves its fleet to Andalusia but does not support the move. Once 
again, this is probably because Spain is assuming that the Gibraltar fleet 
will move out, but is still taking some precautions. Unlike the Rock, this 
defense gives a chance for a build in Gibraltar - if the move to Andalusia 
works but Spain did not move to Gibraltar in the spring. The chance would 
have been just as good by moving to the South Atlantic Ocean or the Straits 
of Gibraltar, and Britain would be able to pick up Morroco.


<P><DT><strong>Gibraltar Sidestep</strong>
<DD>
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Liverpool -> Irish Sea.<BR>
Fleet Edinburgh -> Norwegian Sea.<BR>
Fleet London -> North Sea.<BR>
Fleet Gibraltar -> Straits of Gibraltar.
</blockquote></tt>

Says Mikko Laitinen, "Fleet in Gibraltar could move to Straits of Gibraltar
also on their way to 
Morroco.  But the Atlantic gives an opportunity to take a shot at Seville 
or Portugal, if Spain fumbles with his opening."


<P><DT><strong>Belgian Waffle</strong>
<DD>
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Liverpool -> Irish Sea.<BR>
Fleet Edinburgh -> North Sea.<BR>
Fleet London -> English Channel.<BR>
Fleet Gibraltar -> Straits of Gibraltar.
</blockquote></tt>

A combination of the Channel Crossing and the Gibraltar Sidestep, this 
opening combines the weaknesses of both. In a press game, this may indicate 
an alliance with Spain as a move to the South-Atlantic is more aggressive 
than one to the Straits, but Britain still gets Morocco.  Because of this, 
it is more likely that Britain try for Belgium than when using the Channel 
Crossing, in which the Channel fleet may simply move to the Mid-Atlantic 
and south towards Spain.

<H3>Strategies for Britain in Modern Games</H3>

  Britain's starting position in Modern is split between north and south. 
The northern part, the British Isles, is safe from immediate attack as none 
of Britain's neighbors has enough fleets to launch an attack, and also 
because they have more pressing concerns. His southern outpost, Gibraltar, 
is on the other hand very hard to hold. The starting strategies are 
therefore split between those that attempt to keep Gibraltar, and those 
that give it up entirely.
<P>
  If Britain wants to keep Gibraltar, he can either move to Morocco in the 
spring of 1995 and bring a fleet south from Britain, or he can try holding 
on to Gibraltar. If Spain supports his fleet into Andalusia in the spring 
however, there is no way Gibraltar can be held.  Spain might assume Britain 
is moving out though and send his fleet to the Western Mediterranean or the 
Gulf of Lyon. In that case it is possible for Britain to keep Gibraltar in 
1995, though still without a build.
<P>
  An alternative is to move to the South Atlantic Ocean in the spring of 
1995. From there Britain can support France or be supported by France into 
Portugal, he can threaten Seville and he can even bounce  Spain in 
Gibraltar if Spain is not already there and be able to build there (Britain 
was able to do this in Odessa, the only game until now where Britain has 
built something in Gibraltar). If Spain moved an army to Portugal and 
another to Gibraltar in the spring, he may try covering Seville from a 
British attack by bouncing with himself. Britain can then support 
Gibraltar's move to Seville, thus ruining Spain's tactic and keeping 
Gibraltar.
<P>
  The most commonly used tactic for Britain in the south however, is to 
make a run for Morocco in 1995. It is possible for Britain to send a fleet 
to the Mid-Atlantic in the first year (either from Liverpool or London), 
but he can also wait a season or two to decide whether he wants to fight in 
the south or simply give up and concentrate on the north.
<P>
  If Britain forgets about the south, he can concentrate all his forces on 
the north and perhaps have better luck. It is generally accepted that no 
matter what, Britain will send his Liverpool fleet to Ireland in 1995. 
After that, it can be sent to either the Channel, the Norwegian Sea or the 
Mid-Atlantic and arrive in the fall of 1996. The choice depends primarily 
on what else Britain has done in the north in 1995.
<P>
  Other than Ireland, there are two main targets for Britain in the north 
in 1995, Norway and Belgium. As in the standard variant, Britain can ensure 
that he takes Norway by moving to the North Sea and the Norwegian Sea from 
his eastern ports. The only threat to Norway is Russia and then only if he 
moves from Murmansk to Lapland, and then only if he is sure Germany will 
not try to keep him out of Sweden. If Russia does not move there, Britain 
can try to keep Germany out of Denmark or Holland, or attempt to take 
Belgium, maybe even getting some help from France or Germany.
<P>
  Unlike in the standard variant, Britain can move to the Channel in 1995 
without making France his sworn enemy. This is because France's Atlantic 
port is no longer in Brest, but south in Bordeaux. By moving to the Channel 
as well as the North Sea, Britain has a very good chance at taking Belgium, 
especially if he gains support. Even without support, he can usually get it 
unless Germany and France are cooperating. This is because Germany will 
likely move from Hamburg to Denmark in the spring of 1995 instead of 
Holland (otherwise Britain might be able to keep Germany out of Denmark). 
Also, by moving this way, Britain still keeps his options open for Norway 
and can still take it if Russia did not move to Murmansk, sneaking into 
Belgium without support at the same time.  France and Germany are unlikely 
to oppose the move to Belgium unless they have equal or superior force 
since moving otherwise will give them an enemy and not much else.

Comments on Gibraltar</H3>

<strong>Brian Burkhart:</strong>
"Forget Gibraltar in the early years, you can't hold it.  But you can hang 
on pretty good in Morocco until you get reinforcements there."
<P>
<strong>Mikko Laitinen:</strong>
"Hmm, only way for Britain to protect Gibraltar, or at least his southern 
fleet would be to send the fleet from London to Mid Atlantic in the first 
year. Then, even with Gibraltar gone he could  probably defend against 
Spain in South Atlantic.  I don't know how this would work out in the long 
run though."
<P>
<strong>Simon Withers:</strong>
"Gibraltar is a crap shoot.  Guess how Spain wants to take Gib, and act on 
it."

Comments on the North</H3>

<strong>Michael Artz:</strong>"The French/English alliance
is particularly strong."
<P>
<strong>Mikko Laitinen:</strong>
"Ireland could be taken from North Atlantic also (instead of the Irish Sea) 
so there's no real difference.  Maybe only in case there is a real threat 
from France to move to English Channel in the autumn and Germany to try for 
the North Sea at the same time.  Very unlikely scenario."
