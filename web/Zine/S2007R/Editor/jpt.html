<h2><IMG SRC="/Zine/Common/Just_Passing_through.jpg" NAME="Graphic3" ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH=274 HEIGHT=407 BORDER=0>Diplomacy World is back!</h2>
<p>After a year-long hiatus, Diplomacy World has returned!
<p>Past-and-current DW Editor Douglas Kent has put together a very good <a href="http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/dw97.pdf">Spring 2006 Issue</a> (PDF format), with a contest to boot! He's also created a Back Issues section on his <a href="http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/">Diplomacy World Web site</a>, with issues going back to Diplomacy World #73, all downloadable in PDF format.
<p>If you're interested in giving him feedback, contributing, or even participating in the contest, write him at <b><a href="mailto:diplomacyworld@yahoo.com">diplomacyworld@yahoo.com</a></b>.

<h2>HuskyCon</h2>
<p>HuskyCon is still in the offing, and it's taking place just before our upcoming F2007M issue comes out:
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'><i>HuskyCon V
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Friday 17th August 2007 - Sunday 19th August 2007
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Stony Brook, Long Island, New York, United States
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Contact: Conrad Woodring<br>
Website: <a href="http://www.huskycon.com/">http://www.huskycon.com</a>
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>HuskyCon is a unique event in that the entire event is held at a
private residence, and that room and board are free. The Woodring
household is large enough to comfortably provide lodging to a large
group of people. Food and drink is also provided free of charge by
the Woodring family.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>The event is a favorite among regional players and is characterized a
laid back, very social atmosphere. Players have brought families and
spent part of the weekend swimming off of the Woodring's dock, or
simply sitting on the edge of the cliff enjoying the beautiful views
of Long Island Sound. There is also quite a bit of side gaming that
goes on during the tournament.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>So please, visit our website. Feel free to bombard us with any
questions you may have. We look forward to seeing you in August.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Thank you,
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Conrad Woodring</i>
<p>The Editor recommends checking out that site and looking for pictures of the gigantic Diplomacy board the Woodrings have!
<h2>Last Chance to come to World Dip Con!</h2>
