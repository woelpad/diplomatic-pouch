<blockquote><i>Last issue we resumed Baron Powell's discussions of powers in his <b>1900</b> variant, which had begun with <a href="../../S2002M/VonPowell/1900_Intro.html">a general introduction to 1900</a> in the S2002M issue. In the S2007M issue, we continued the series with Baron's observations on <a href="../../S2007M/Powell/1900_Italy.html">Italy</a>.

<p>This time he looks at Russia, discussing the aspects that make it such a powerhouse in standard <b>Diplomacy</b> and the steps taken in <b>1900</b> to mitigate the Tsar's power to even out the contest. As with previous articles in the series, we're sure you'll find his remarks interesting whether you play <b>1900</b> or not!</i></blockquote>

<p>In most of the previous chapters, the chapter on France being the exception, I argued that I made the
subject Great Powers stronger than they are in <b>Diplomacy</b>. Further, I stated that this newfound muscle
translated directly into a more balanced game. I won’t make this same claim for Russia. In fact, I’ll state
up front that I worked to make Russia <u>weaker</u> in <IMG SRC="1900picru.gif" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="471" BORDER=0 ALT="1900: Russia" ALIGN="RIGHT" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10"> <b>1900</b> than it is in <b>Diplomacy</b>. What I intend to
do in this chapter is explain why I felt it was
necessary to weaken Russia, describe all of the
actions taken to make Russia an "average"
Great Power, and demonstrate that the Russia of
<b>1900</b> is still a formidable opponent.

<p>Why would I attempt to curb Russian strength?
For starters, there are historical reasons for
doing so.

<p>Paul Kennedy, in <u>The Rise and Fall of the Great
Powers</u>, provides interesting commentary on
Russia at the turn of the century. To begin with,
Russia had the most men under arms
(1,162,000) of any European Power. This figure
put it well ahead of second place France
(715,000). Next, Russia had the third largest
navy in terms of tonnage behind Britain and
France. Russia’s population was larger than that
of Austria-Hungary and Germany combined
(136,000,000 to 103,000,000). Also, several
key economic indicators showed that Russia
was enjoying incredible economic growth.
Given all of these numbers, it’s not surprising
that Russian power was feared in Berlin,
Constantinople, London, and Vienna.

<p>These impressive figures do not tell the whole
story, however. Despite its advances, Russia
was still a comparatively backward nation with a predominantly agrarian economy, an inadequate
transportation network, and an illiterate population. Russia’s small industrial capability, 48% of Britain’s
and 67% of Germany’s, could not keep pace with the shock and strain of a major war of more than a few
weeks duration. Though the army was large, it was under-equipped and poorly supplied. Worse still,
officers and NCOs generally lacked adequate training. Internal cohesiveness in society at large and in the
military in particular was weakened by the many non-Russian nationalities (e.g., Finns, Poles, Tartars,
Lithuanians, Ukrainians, Armenians, Latvians, Georgians, Estonians, etc.) that chaffed under St.
Petersburg’s "Russification" policies. The appalling conditions the average peasant or worker dealt with
every day contributed directly to ever increasing social unrest. Kennedy reports that troops were needed
on over 114, 000 (!!!) separate occasions in 1908 to keep the peace.

<p>An indicator of Russia’s war readiness was provided in the 1904-05 Russo-Japanese War. All of Europe
anticipated a quick and decisive Russian victory over the stereotypical "inept oriental." Such was not to
be the case. The Japanese army handily defeated its Russian counterpart in Manchuria and the Japanese
navy destroyed Russia’s Baltic squadron at Tsushima, though the fact that the ill-fated Baltic squadron
made it all the way to Tsushima in the first place was somewhat miraculous. Even as the reality of
complete defeat in the Far East sank in, open rebellion broke out in the European portion of the Empire.

<p>For a brief period, it looked like the Tsar’s rule might come to end. Though the government’s authority
was eventually restored, Russian society remained a powder keg. WWI proved to be the match that set
off the explosion. It should not be surprising to anyone upon reflection that the first Power to drop out of
the conflict was Russia and not one of its supposedly weaker neighbors.

<p>Historical considerations aside, there is another important reason to bring Russia back to the pack: Russia,
like France, appears to be too strong in <b>Diplomacy</b>. Looking at the numbers in <a href="../../S2002M/VonPowell/1900_Intro.html">the introductory article</a>, Russia ranks
as the strongest of the Great Powers by a comfortable margin. Its 449 solos out of 3723 games played
easily outdistance the 364 solos accumulated by second place France and are more than twice the paltry
221 solos that pathetic Italy has managed to scrape together. The one seeming dark spot on Russia’s
otherwise bright record is that it either wins outright or it loses. Russia participated in fewer draws (531)
than any other Great Power. By comparison, Italy has the next lowest draw total with 534, while France
has the highest draw total with 751. Certainly, these figures suggest that Russia’s "Do or Die" reputation
is very much deserved. Still, on the strength of its solos alone, Russia is clearly a Great Power to be
reckoned with.

<p>Why is this so? To answer this question, I think we have to look at the game dynamics that exist in
<b>Diplomacy</b>. Where these dynamics appear to work against Italy, they seem to generally work in Russia’s
favor.

<p>Let’s start by stating the obvious: Russia is part of the eastern triangle (A/R/T). If we assume the A/R/T
triangle is balanced, Russia should have an ally in the east, either Austria-Hungary or Turkey,
approximately two thirds of the time. An eastern ally allows Russia to compete for a Bear’s share of the
Balkan supply centers (SCs) and also gives it access to a portion of the SCs controlled by the "odd Power
out" (OPO), the Power that doesn’t have an ally within its triangle at game-start. "So what?" you say.
"This situation is hardly unique to Russia." Yes, this is true. All of the Great Powers except Italy are
members of a triangle and can theoretically follow this same formula to success. Russia’s record is
superior because it enjoys advantages within its triangle that the other Powers don’t enjoy within theirs.

<p>Consider:
<ul>
<li>For starters, I contend the A/R/T triangle is not balanced. Instead, Russia is the ally of choice within
the eastern triangle. By this I mean that the two alliances involving Russia, A/R and R/T, occur more than
the expected two-thirds of the time. I don’t have statistical evidence to support this claim, but I’m willing
to bet that A/T occurs less frequently in games than either A/R or R/T. In the original <i>Gamers’ Guide to
Diplomacy</i>, Rod Walker states that A/T is rare and uncomfortable for both partners. This is because
Austria-Hungary effectively constricts Turkey’s best expansion routes. Control of Greece, in particular, is
often a major source of friction between Vienna and Constantinople. Rod suggests that the strongest
argument in favor of A/T is that it may catch the other Powers by surprise simply because it is so
unexpected! It’s possible that A/T is not as unusual now as it once was and I’m sure that good diplomats
can make it work, but it does seem that A/T has more obstacles to overcome than either A/R or R/T (i.e.,
the vaunted Juggernaut). If I’m correct, Russia will have a partner in more than the expected two thirds
of all games started. This is a tremendous advantage!<br><br>
<li>If an A/R is in place at game-start, Russia appears to have the superior position. Even after Turkey is
dispatched, potentially covetous neighbors will still surround Austria-Hungary. The Archduke will have
to use a combination of diplomacy and military deterrence to prevent an invasion from the west should he
want to turn on his Russian ally. The Tsar, on the other hand, with a secure eastern flank and a southern
flank that is much less of a danger once the Ottoman menace is eliminated, can focus on pushing his
forces outward from the edge of the map without fear of being hit from behind. Then there are naval
considerations. The Dual Monarchy’s navy is likely to be of limited utility in an Austro-Russian conflict,
while Russia, with its iron grip on the Black Sea, has a base of naval operations that can be useful both
offensively and defensively against Austria-Hungary in the Balkans or Northern Anatolia. Finally, if A/R
continues after the fall of Turkey, newly built Austro-Hungarian units will usually march away from
Mother Russia to get to the front while newly built Russian units will generally flow past Austro-Hungarian home SCs to get into the action. Given these dynamics, it is easier for the Tsar to orchestrate a
devastating stab of the Dual Monarchy than it is for the Archduke to fatally wound the Russian Bear.<br><br>
<li>If an R/T is in place at game-start, the balance of power between the two allies is more equal, at least
initially. Turkey is a much more difficult nut for the Tsar to crack than Austria-Hungary is. As will be
discussed shortly, though, Russia enjoys far greater offensive potential than its southern neighbor does.
Even as the Sultan is slogging his way through the congested Mediterranean, Russia is often exploding
into the center of the board. Since an expanding Russia can be difficult for Turkey to stab, Russia can
potentially race off to victory before the Sultan can react effectively.<br><br>
<li>While it’s true that Russia’s defensive position is not nearly as strong as the corners inhabited by the
two Wicked Witches, its offensive potential is arguably second to none. Russia alone among the Great
Powers starts with four units. These units enable the Tsar to dedicate three units to southern operations,
thereby matching the forces that any one of his potential opponents can bring to the fight, and still have a
unit, F St. Petersburg, available to meddle in the affairs of the western triangle. F St. Petersburg claims
Sweden in the majority of games played. This is due to the fact that many Kaisers, their attention focused
on events in the west, are loath to hinder Russian expansion for fear of angering the Bear. Even if
Germany does block Russian entry into Sweden in ’01, England may be happy to support Russia into
Sweden in ’02, if Albion is at odds with the Reich. To borrow a metaphor, once the Bear’s nose is in the
cabin, the rest of him is likely to follow. If the build resulting from control of Sweden is dedicated to
business in the north, the Tsar may find himself in a strong position to sell his services to the highest
western bidder. It’s also worth noting that Russia sits astride the primary stalemate lines. As Walker
points out, once those white blocks start rolling, they can be very hard to stop.<br><br>
<li>As discussed in Chapter 6, Italy is not truly a member of either triangle at game-start. If the Pope
looks east, the one member of the eastern triangle that does not have to worry about immediate Italian
designs on its home SCs is Russia. Far from being a direct threat, Italy provides Russia with an
outstanding mid-game ally. After Russia and its initial partner dispatch the OPO in the east, the Tsar can
work with the Pope to crush Russia’s erstwhile ally. The end result of such a strategy is often a very large
Bear that can be quite intimidating.

</ul>

<p>Given all of these advantages, why does Russia draw so infrequently? Good question. I think there are
two answers. The first is because Russia wins so often. Its offensive potential is so vast that it either
crushes its early allies outright or leaves them in its wake. The second is that Russia, as much as any
other Great Power, is extremely vulnerable at game-start. None of the advantages I describe above are
decisive or guarantee Russian success. Despite its position on the edge of the map, Russia has no
shortage of neighbors. Unless Italy intervenes on Russia’s behalf, an A/T should quickly eliminate Russia
as a factor in the eastern triangle. Likewise, if an E/G forms in the west, the Tsar’s dreams of a
Scandinavian empire will probably go unfulfilled. Worse still, northern Russia itself may soon have to
deal with an Anglo-German assault. Good diplomacy, sound tactics, and some luck are absolutely
necessary or the Bear’s head will be mounted on someone’s wall. Over a large number of games,
however, a competently played Russia should do well. The data available seem to confirm this
supposition.
<p>The Great Power that appears to suffer most from Russia’s success is Austria-Hungary. Russia’s three
other neighbors all perform about where we would expect "average" Powers to perform, but the Dual
Monarchy clearly has an inferior record. One of my challenges while designing <b>1900</b> was to figure out
how to level the playing field between Austria-Hungary and Russia without ruining balance elsewhere.
Let’s take a look now at how I attempted to accomplish this objective (and recount the missteps along the
way!).

<p>Russia itself underwent only one change, but that change is generally considered significant. The
Moscow space is now split into two spaces: Moscow, which remains a Russian SC, and Siberia, a new
space to the east that touches St. Petersburg, Moscow, and Sevastopol. I borrowed this idea from Stephen
Agar who discussed it in his article "New Improved Diplomacy?" in issue #80 of Diplomacy World. The
primary reason Stephen championed this change to Russia’s internal organization was to help defeat the traditional stalemate lines that exist in <b>Diplomacy</b>. Since elimination of stalemate lines has always struck
me as a worthy goal, Siberia made its appearance on the <b>1900</b> map.

<p>The addition of Siberia by itself, however, was unlikely to alter play balance between Russia and Austria-
Hungary. To accomplish this, I looked elsewhere.

<p>For starters, I worked to ensure Russia lost its "Most Favored Nation" status by removing or minimizing
the sources of friction that make A/T cooperation so awkward in <b>Diplomacy</b>. I’ll address this aspect of
the variant design further in the chapter on Turkey. Suffice it to say here that the goal was to make A/T
just as workable as A/R or R/T and, therefore, just as likely. Initial game results suggested that the A/R/T
triangle was fairly well balanced. This meant that the question of which eastern monarch didn’t have a
chair to sit on when the music stopped playing was settled primarily by their respective diplomatic skills,
which is as it should be

<p>Next, as mentioned in the chapter on Austria-Hungary, two changes were made to the Dual Monarchy that
impacted directly on Austro-Russian relations. The first was that A Trieste replaced F Trieste. The
second was that Galicia no longer touched Vienna. Together, these two changes significantly alter the
balance of power between the Dual Monarchy and Russia. Every Archduke and Tsar will almost certainly
notice that A Trieste makes the competition for Rumania far more intense than it is in <b>Diplomacy</b>. This is
because the Dual Monarchy can now arrange to capture Serbia and attack Rumania with support in Fall
’00 without any difficulty. At the same time, a Russian invasion of Galicia, a major concern of Archdukes
in Diplomacy, is easily shrugged off in <b>1900</b>. As a result, A Vienna, a unit frequently used purely for
defensive purposes at game-start in <b>Diplomacy</b>, is now available to do other things in <b>1900</b>. Because
Austria-Hungary can bring more firepower into the fight against Russia, the Tsar may find that his
opening options have become more limited. Both A Moscow and A Warsaw will probably be required in
the battle for Rumania and to discourage an all-out blitz on Russia itself.

<p>Another design change intended to help Austria-Hungary and slow down Russia involved the
strengthening of Germany. Germany has relatively little to do with the Dual Monarchy early on in a
typical Diplomacy game, but normally interacts with Russia in Scandinavia right away. As I’ve
explained before, I felt that a more powerful Germany might distract Russia enough to compensate for the
Dual Monarchy’s inferior position vis-à-vis its eastern neighbor. In the chapter on Germany, I pointed out
how the Reich is much more muscular in <b>1900</b> than it is in <b>Diplomacy</b>. With an expectation of three
builds in ’00 and a total of seven units on the board when ’01 begins, the Kaiser is unlikely to lose much
sleep over Russia’s reaction to a bounce in Sweden. In fact, if the Tsar protests too loudly, the Kaiser may
respond by sending his army and navy eastward to teach the Tsar manners. Then again, the Kaiser may
send his army and navy eastward in any case. This is particularly likely to occur if Britain and France are
at odds in the west.

<p>Clearly, if even a few German units are sent to the eastern front in ’01, they could prove decisive in an
Austro-Russian war. Should the Archduke and Kaiser decide to go Bear hunting right away, things could
get ugly for Russia in a hurry. If the Archduke successfully orders A Budapest to Galicia, A Vienna to
Budapest, and A Trieste to Serbia, while the Kaiser orders A Berlin to Prussia and A Munich to Silesia
(the Connor-Greneoux Gambit), A/G has three units on both Warsaw and Rumania. The Tsar can be
forgiven for breaking out in a cold sweat at the mere thought of such a scenario. In fact, the original
Connor-Greneoux Gambit was so potent that it was the driving factor in the decision to separate Vienna
from Galicia by enlarging Bohemia. This historically justifiable change, while making a Russian invasion
of Galicia far less threatening to Austria-Hungary, also works to prevent the Archduke from forcing his
way into Galicia against Russian resistance by ordering A Vienna to Galicia supported by A Budapest.

<p>Of course, A/G is not the only alliance involving Germany that the Tsar needs to be concerned with. If
Britain and Germany work together, the implications for Russia are potentially serious. While the
dispersion of British units at game-start (i.e., only F London and F Edinburgh begin the game in Britain itself) probably means that Britain’s northern position will take slightly longer to develop, increased
German strength more than compensates for any British weakness. Once B/G has France under control,
the two western allies are likely to turn their full attention to Mother Russia. Unless the Tsar has enjoyed
considerable success against Austria-Hungary or Turkey, he may have a difficult time stemming the B/G
tide in the north.

<p>Something I had not intended, but which proved to be the case, was that the Tsar could not count on Italy
distracting a hostile Austria-Hungary or Turkey at game-start. While Italian intervention in the east early
in the game remains a possibility, the tense nature of F/I relations usually results in France and Italy
getting caught up in a war soon after the game starts. If Russia is the OPO in the east, the Pope is
unlikely to be the white knight the Tsar needs.

<p>When commenting on how to play Russia early in the life of the variant, one <b>1900</b> player stated, "This
looks real hard!" Game results over time seemed to justify his pessimism. <b>Diplomacy</b>’s Great Bear had
been seemingly rendered toothless. After forty-six games had been played to completion, Russia was
limping along with a horrific Great Power Rating (GPR) of 8.74 (an average GPR is 25.71) and was the
only Great Power that had not soloed. Meanwhile, Austria-Hungary (GPR of 29.09 and four solos),
Germany (GPR of 34.43 and four solos), and Turkey (GPR of 33.00 and six solos), were all playing at a
level well above average. In those forty-six games, Russia reached thirteen or more SCs only four times,
the worst showing of any Great Power, while it had been held to seven SCs or less thirty times, which put
it next to last. Ugh! While forty-six games represented too small a sample size from which to draw any
firm statistical conclusions, enough games were in the books for me to start worrying that I had shifted
the balance of power in the east too far against Russia.

<p>So what went wrong? At first, I blamed Russia’s poor record on "uninspired" play by many Tsars and
something I called the "Diplomacy Hangover." It was clear that many players new to <b>1900</b> relied on their
understanding of a "typical" <b>Diplomacy</b> game to determine how they were going to proceed. For Tsars,
this frequently meant trying to play <b>1900</b>’s Russia using strategies that are generally successful in
<b>Diplomacy</b> and discovering that those strategies don’t work as well against <b>1900</b>’s stronger Austria-
Hungary and Germany. Archdukes and Kaisers often looked at Russia, saw the bully that dominates
<b>Diplomacy</b>, and figured it was their turn to get even. They quickly found clever ways to use their new
units and exploit the <b>1900</b> map to make the Tsar’s life short and miserable. Initially, I was confident that
game results would even out and Russia would end up somewhere in the middle of the pack. Some
strong showings by Russia in the first few <b>1900</b> games played encouraged such thinking. As more game
results came in, however, I increasingly came to believe that my confidence had been misplaced. Far
from getting better, Russia’s record went from bad to worse. Though Russia did enjoy some truly
excellent campaigns, such performances were the exception to the rule. Clearly, some serious study of
the situation was in order.

<p>When defending Russia from its critics, I had taken solace in the fact that Russia managed to keep pace
with the other Great Powers after the first game year. The table below shows how frequently,
in terms of percentages, a Great Power had five or six units at its disposal after the Winter ‘00 builds:

</center>

<p>Based on the numbers above, I thought is was hard to argue that Russia was at a disadvantage relative to
the other Great Powers. Indeed, when compared to the other members of the traditional eastern triangle,
Austria-Hungary and Turkey, Russia appeared comparatively well off. Unfortunately, this quick analysis
ignored a few important considerations.

<p>While Russia was indeed more likely to have five or six units entering ’01 than Austria-Hungary, Italy, or
Turkey were, this did not mean that it enjoyed good growth prospects. After all, Russia started the game
with four units so getting to five or six units should not have been nearly as great a feat for the Tsar as it
was for the Archduke, Pope, or Sultan. Based on fifty-seven games, Russia averaged the worst first year
growth of any Great Power (Germany 2.84, Britain 2.00, Austria-Hungary 1.63, Italy 1.51, France 1.42,
Turkey 1.12, and Russia 1.02). In those same fifty-seven games, Russia was kept to zero builds or
actually lost ground in 24.6% of the time. Clearly these numbers suggested that Russia had trouble
getting out of the blocks.
<p>Even as Russia was mobilizing slowly, its greatest enemy, Germany, always got off to fast starts.
Germany never failed to get at least two builds in ’00. The Reich started ’01 with three builds a
staggering 75.9% of the time and four builds 7.4% of the time. Unless Germany was facing an Anglo-
French alliance in the west, something we would expect to occur about one third of the time, those
"extra" black units were likely to head east as the Kaiser searched for new worlds to conquer. For several
reasons, Kaisers almost universally chose to open the second front against Russia instead of Austria-
Hungary. Those reasons included the extremely high level of friction between Germany and Russia, the
belief that more SCs and a superior position were available if Russia was taken down, the "Diplomacy
Hangover" mentioned earlier, and the reluctance to help the edge Powers by attacking a fellow center
Power. Perhaps most significant, however, was the fact that Russia was generally unable to put up an
effective defense against a German invasion while heavily engaged in the south.
<p>This last point is key. Despite bordering the map’s edge, Russia still has abundant neighbors, a lot of
ground to cover, and too few units with which to accomplish everything. As mentioned earlier in this
chapter, these are not great problems in <b>Diplomacy</b> where Russia often faces a weak and distracted
Austria-Hungary, and a four or five unit Reich that is normally preoccupied with events in the west. In
<b>1900</b>, where Italy tends to look west, Austria-Hungary frequently has five armies at its disposal after
Winter ’00 builds, and Germany is typically bristling with weapons of war entering Spring ‘01, Russia’s
far flung frontiers and paucity of units created a dangerous situation for the Tsar.

<p>In most <b>1900</b> contests, Tsars sent both A Moscow and A Warsaw south in Spring ‘00. Moving A Moscow
north or A Warsaw west at game-start, though not unheard of, was generally considered risky since doing
so raised the potential of the southern campaign being stopped dead in its tracks. Of course, when A
Moscow and A Warsaw were sent south, F St. Petersburg was left all alone to champion the Tsar’s claims
in Scandinavia. After Winter ’00 builds, Russia was likely to have only this fleet and one other unit
available to campaign in the north and center. Even if Russia was fortunate enough to get two builds in
‘00, its troops were often divided evenly between the north and south, and little was left to defend the
middle. Not surprisingly, opportunistic neighbors frequently exploited any weaknesses in Russia’s
position. Given its troop dispositions, Russia was often forced to give ground somewhere critical. Quite
regularly, any success enjoyed on one front was offset by setbacks on another front. As a result, Russia
had a tough time getting beyond the five to seven SC range over the course of a game.

<p>For me, the most obvious indicator that Russia’s poor record might be a design flaw was that Russia took
Rumania first in thirty-five of fifty-one games, almost exactly the ratio we would expect, but had
considerable trouble holding on to it. Russia lost Rumania within two years in fifteen contests or in 43%
of those thirty-five games. Because Russia is unlikely to get Rumania at all if it is the OPO in the eastern
triangle, the implication was clear: the Tsar’s game-start ally was likely to stab Russia extremely early in
the contest. In most instances, it is rare for a game-start alliance to break down so quickly since the initial
OPO is usually still viable and, theoretically, available to work with the stabbed party against the openly
perfidious ally. Clearly, however, this was not too much of a concern for the Archduke (nine quick stabs)
or the Sultan (six quick stabs) in <b>1900</b>. Why was this so? I believe two key factors were involved.
<ul>
<li>First, when examining Austria-Hungary’s unit locations after the Winter ’00 builds, it became clear
that the Dual Monarchy was usually in superb position to take Rumania from Russia and then hold it.
Almost always, a five SC Dual Monarchy had three units directly adjacent to Rumania (A Budapest, A
Bulgaria, A Serbia) and at least one army, usually two, that could march east if needed. Though Russia
normally had three units itself in or next to Rumania, those units were usually moving to continue the
attack on Turkey or were being cut by a Turkish attack from Black Sea or Armenia. The seizure of
Rumania left the Dual Monarchy in an easily defended position with a build on the way, while Russia had
to deal with both the loss of a unit and, usually, a heated war with Turkey.<br><br>
<li>Second, and arguably more important, the Germans were usually distracting Russia to such an extent
that Russia’s game-start ally felt it could stab without much fear of reprisal by the Tsar.
</ul>

<p>Naturally, once Rumania was taken, Sevastopol was just a short march away. With Germans pushing
east, a traitorous ally moving up from the south, and, quite often, the British laying claim to St.
Petersburg, it is small wonder that Tsars often felt the world was against them.

<p>Having identified a possible problem, the question then became what to do about it. Finding a solution
involved a lot of thought and numerous discussions with <b>1900</b> veterans. Several interesting proposals
were put forward, but the idea that appealed to me most was one submitted by Aki Halme. With only
slight modifications, Aki’s idea became the Russian Steamroller Rule (hereafter simply Steamroller).
Basically, the Steamroller allowed Russia to have “n+1” units as long as it controlled “n” SCs and one of
those SCs was a home SC. The extra unit needed to be built following normal build rules (i.e., during a
Winter turn in an open home SC). If, after a Fall turn, Russia lost all four home SCs, it could only
maintain one unit for each controlled SC. If an extra unit was on the map, the Tsar had to disband
something to meet this provision. Russia was entitled to an extra unit once again if it reclaimed a home
SC, but the extra unit had to be built.

<p>I liked this proposal for several reasons:

<ul>
<li>It was historically justifiable. As addressed at the start of this chapter, Russia was the most populous
nation in Europe and had seemingly endless reserves of manpower. At the turn of the century, the leaders
in Berlin, Constantinople, London, and Vienna all worried about Russia’s hordes, while the leaders in
Paris saw their Russian ally as the “Steamroller” that would crush the Germans should they be so bold as
to attack France. The Russian general staff maintained large garrisons across the length and breadth of
the Empire to cow local populations into submission, break up anti-government gatherings, defend the
borders, and take advantage of opportunities that might be found across the frontiers. Russia also had the
vast resources of Siberia at its disposal, though exploiting them was often problematic for a nation with a
primitive transportation infrastructure and limited industrial capacity.<br><br>

<li>It didn’t require any map revisions or adjustments to at-start forces that might have had unanticipated
consequences on play balance.<br><br>

<li>It seemed likely to impact directly on those nations that most benefited from Russian weakness:
Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and, especially Germany. A stronger Russia would probably turn the east into a
more evenly balanced quadrangle. Instead of viewing Russia primarily as a delicacy to be consumed,
Germany might instead give more serious consideration to a partnership with Russia, particularly if
Austria-Hungary or Britain was proving troublesome. Meanwhile, both Austria-Hungary and Turkey
might not find an early stab of their Russian ally quite as inviting and instead remain faithful on a more
consistent basis.
</ul>

<p>Shortly after I introduced the Steamroller, I got a message from a veteran <b>1900</b> player, Bill Leake. He
agreed that Russia needed a boost, but he would have preferred that the fix didn’t involve strengthening
Russia’s offensive capability. Results since the Steamroller was introduced show that Bill was on to
something. In the seventy-one Steamroller games that have been completed as of this writing, Russia’s
GPR was a smashing 42.21. Yowza! Where Russia had not soloed at all prior to the Steamroller, it
suddenly boasted twelve solos. Perhaps most remarkable, when Russia captured two SCs in ’00, as it did
39.4% of the time (more on this in a bit), it had a GPR of 80.04.

<p>Honestly, as I watched this trend develop, I found myself astounded. Initially, I was at a loss to explain
things. How could a Power that couldn’t gain traction prior to the Steamroller become so fearsome? One
unit couldn’t make that much difference, could it? It turns out it could. But how?

<p>The key to solving the mystery revealed itself when I looked at Sweden. Prior to the Steamroller, Russia
captured Sweden first in 54.4% of the fifty-seven games started, while Germany, as befitting an arch
nemesis, captured Sweden in 42.1% of those games. The Steamroller dramatically changed this ratio.
Russia took Sweden first in 73.2% of eighty-two games, while Germany only claimed Sweden 17.1% of
the time. Hmmmmm... Since the extra Russian unit wasn’t on the map yet, why would the situation in
Sweden change so drastically? The answer was that Kaisers took one look at Steamroller Russia, saw a
potential monster in the making, and regularly decided it wasn’t worth the hassle of taking on. This
meant that Russia frequently captured both Sweden and Rumania in Fall ’00. With three builds that
Winter, Russia was usually off to the races.

<p>Naturally, this had implications on both sides of the map. In the east, the lack of German pressure
allowed the Tsar to easily hold out against A/Ts. Most Archdukes and Sultans perceived this possibility
because A/T became scarce. Russia was once again the ally of choice on that side of the board. As a
result, Austria-Hungary’s overall performance declined from a GPR of 29.09 to 24.55, while Turkey took
a huge hit, dropping from a GPR of 33.00 to a measly 16.69. In the west, all those German units that had
previously been used to attack Russia had to go somewhere and most of them ended up in France or Italy.
Contrary to all of my expectations, a stronger Russia actually led to a less effective France and Italy.
France’s GPR dropped from 27.78 to 18.55, while Italy’s GPR declined from 21.98 to 17.28. Curiously,
both Britain and Germany performed much the same as they had prior to the Steamroller.
These were not satisfactory results at all and I decided that something had to be done. After soliciting
comments from Chris Dziedzic, Aki Halme, and Christopher McInerney, all of whom took interest in
Russia’s performance, it seemed obvious that the solution involved following Bill Leake’s advice. A
change was made that helped Russia defensively, but did not give it the considerable offensive boost the
Steamroller did. After much dithering, I decided to call the new rule the Russian Emergency Measures
(REM) Rule.

<p>As described in the first chapter, the REM Rule assumes that Russia reacts with desperation in the face of
a crisis (much like it actually did in 1916 after the catastrophes of 1915) by better managing its resources
and industrial capacity. In this case, the crisis is the loss of a home supply center. Whenever Russia
possesses at least one, <u>but not all four</u>, of its original home supply centers, it is entitled to maintain one
extra unit on the map (i.e., one more than the number of supply centers it currently controls).
Additionally, while Russia is in this condition, the Tsar may use Siberia as a build site during the
adjustment phase, if Siberia is unoccupied. Should Russia fail to possess at least one home supply center
<u>or</u> should it regain possession of all four of its home supply centers, the ability to maintain an extra unit is
lost and any excess units must be disbanded during the subsequent adjustment phase. Further, Siberia
reverts to its normal status (i.e., it is no longer a build site). Note that Siberia, while it may become a
build site, never attains supply center status.

<p>Now that we’ve covered how and why Russia got to its current state, it’s time to show what the Tsar can
do to ensure Russia doesn’t follow down the path of its historical counterpart and bow out of the war
early.

<p>To begin with, the Tsar must realize that Russia is extremely vulnerable at game-start. Though Russia
begins the game with four units just like Britain, France, and Germany all do; the Bear is a mere cub
when compared to the “Big 3.” In fact, the Tsar will probably feel that his four units are totally
inadequate for the tasks required of them. Even with an additional unit or two due to conquests in ‘00,
the Tsar probably cannot expect all gaps to be filled by an influx of new units. To compensate for
Russia’s military shortcomings, the Tsar must be active diplomatically. More than anything else, Russia
needs friends and it needs them in both the east and the west. It is absolutely critical that the Tsar talks
with everybody, not just with the Archduke and Sultan. Only by communicating with everyone will the
Tsar be able to determine what is most likely to happen and what areas he needs to focus on. He can then
allot his units accordingly.

<p>Naturally, the Tsar’s first priority should be to secure an alliance with one of his neighbors. <Duh!> If he
fails to accomplish this, he might as well board the next train to Siberia.

<p>Not surprisingly, an alliance with Turkey works well for Russia in <b>1900</b>, just as it does in <b>Diplomacy</b>.
With Russia’s eastern flank against the map edge and its southern flank secured by treaty, the Tsar can
concentrate on pushing his forces westward as quickly as possible. Any builds obtained by Russia as the
Juggernaut rolls over the Balkans and Dual Monarchy can be used to reinforce the center or strengthen
the north depending on the situation in the west. The appropriate Russian moves in alliance with Turkey
appear to be A Warsaw to Galicia, A Moscow to Ukraine, and F Sevastopol to Rumania. [In almost every
situation, it is probably best to open with F St. Petersburg (sc) to Gulf of Bothnia.] This opening gives
Russia its best chance of securing Rumania in Fall ’00 regardless of what the Austro-Hungarian enemy or
the Turkish ally do.

<p>If the Dual Monarchy is fighting on its own or German intervention in the east is only half-hearted, R/T
should be well on its way. If, however, the Archduke and Kaiser work together closely in the east right
from the start, the situation for Russia becomes far more difficult. The Russian moves listed above will
slow down the aggressive Connor-Greneoux Gambit discussed earlier, but Russia will struggle to do
much more than hold its own against A/G. Most likely, a Western Power will break any deadlock
between A/G and R/T. This means that the Tsar must strive to ensure any intervention in eastern affairs
by the Western Powers works to Russia’s benefit. This is an extremely complex proposition, but in
general the Tsar wants the following:

<ul>
<li>He wants the Prime Minister to respect the Norwegian/Russian border. British intervention against
Russia in the north would likely cause the chain of dominos to start falling in a way detrimental to the
Tsar’s plans. Ideally, the Tsar can work out a deal with the Prime Minister to cooperate against the
Germans in and around Scandinavia, the Baltic Sea, and northern Germany.<br><br>

<li>He wants the Kaiser to be sufficiently distracted so that he is unable to focus his powerful military
machine against Russia, but not so overwhelmed that the Reich collapses quickly UNLESS Russia is in
position to pick up the majority of the German spoils.<br><br>

<li>He wants Turkey kept in check enough so that the Sultan continues to believe that alliance with his
neighbor to the north is his best option. Should the Ottomans start to pull ahead of the Russians, the
likelihood increases that the Sultan will leave the Tsar to his own devices or turn on him. Actually, given
that the Sultan may see A/G pressure on Russia as an opportunity to grab Russian SCs and gain complete
control of the critical Black Sea space, the Tsar must work hard to ensure Turkey remains loyal and
dedicated to the fight against Austria-Hungary.
</ul>

<p>What if, instead of fighting the Dual Monarchy, Russia enters into an alliance with Austria-Hungary?
Such an alliance has a lot going in its favor. In particular, A/R is well positioned to conduct operations
against the overbearing Prussians to the west. This is something an alliance with Turkey doesn’t offer.

<p>If the Germans are preoccupied in the west, A/R can safely adopt a “Turkey First” policy. If they do so,
the advantage of Austria-Hungary’s A Trieste becomes apparent. The optimal Russian moves (from St.
Petersburg’s perspective) are probably F Sevastopol to Black Sea, A Moscow to Ukraine, and A Warsaw
to Galicia, while Austria-Hungary moves A Budapest to Rumania, A Vienna to Budapest, and A Trieste to
Serbia. Regardless of what Turkey does, Russia should take Rumania in the Fall for one build, while
Austria-Hungary gets Serbia and Bulgaria for two builds. Since the most logical division of SCs places
Bulgaria and Rumania under the Dual Monarchy’s control while Constantinople and Ankara go to Russia,
the two allies will need to work out when and how to transfer SCs between themselves.
There are two potential problems with the moves suggested above:

<ul>
<li>First, the Archduke may balk at the idea of his Russian ally “invading” Galicia and prefer A Warsaw
to Ukraine and A Moscow to Sevastopol. While this option works just as well against Turkey as the
moves given above, it forces the Tsar to correctly guess what Germany is doing. If the Tsar placates the
Archduke and an A/G is in place, Russia is probably in deep trouble. Unless the Tsar is comfortable that
Germany is not heading east, I feel the Tsar should press for A Moscow to Ukraine and A Warsaw to
Galicia. He should point out that the Dual Monarchy is in no danger from his army in Galicia, especially
since Galicia no longer borders Vienna. Also, moving A Warsaw to Galicia allows A/R to maintain the
illusion of conflict, something that might be useful in getting information from Germany and Turkey.
Should the Archduke continue to protest, the Tsar needs to decide whether to give in or try working a deal
with the Sultan.<br><br>

<li>Second, if Germany, on its own, moves to Prussia or Silesia in Spring ‘00, Russia may have to use A
Galicia (or A Ukraine) to defend Warsaw. If Turks are threatening Sevastopol at the same time by having
ordered A Damascus to Armenia in the Spring, the capture of Rumania may have to wait until ’01. Even
though Russia would not lose a unit with the loss of Sevastopol due to the REM Rule, there is no need to
risk giving the enemy a build in ’00.
</ul>

<p>When allied with Austria-Hungary, the Tsar needs to be especially mindful of the possibility of treachery.
The temptation to grab Rumania while Russia is engaged with the Turks, and possibly the Germans too,
may simply be too much for the Archduke to resist. To mitigate against Habsburg perfidy, I like the idea
of a more aggressive approach for A/R. If the situation appears to be shaping up favorably, Austria-
Hungary and Russia should seriously consider taking on Germany and Turkey at the same time. Under
this scenario, Russia orders F Sevastopol to Black Sea, A Moscow to Ukraine, and A Warsaw to Silesia or
Prussia while Austria-Hungary moves its three armies to Tyrolia, Bohemia, and Serbia respectively. As a
minimum, each ally should get one build apiece. If the Kaiser is caught by surprise, the Dual Monarchy
should be able to take Munich in the Fall and eliminate any concerns in St. Petersburg of a German
invasion. Such a bold opening is risky, but probably not as perilous as it may appear at first glance.
Turkey should be isolated, and Britain and/or France should be quite willing to join the anti-German
crusade. Even better from St. Petersburg’s point of view, the Austro-Hungarians are unlikely to cast
covetous glances toward Russian SCs while engaged hammer and tong with the Germans.

<p>What about alliance with Germany? Since Germany is very much a part of the eastern equation, it makes
sense that the Tsar should explore this option. Friendship between Germany and Russia actually does
offer both parties quite a lot. From the Tsar’s perspective, a G/R probably ensures that Russia will capture
Sweden and get at least one build in Winter ’00. Next, if an A/T is in place, any Austro-Turkish advance
northward is likely to move along at a snail’s pace, if that fast. The Archduke and Sultan are probably not
going to make any real progress into Russia itself unless Britain intervenes in the north. By that time,
however, the Tsar may be able to exploit his attackers’ frustrations and get them to turn on each other in
alliance with Russia. Finally, if the units can be spared from the south, Russia can work with Germany to
solidify the Tsar’s grip on Scandinavia and then take the war to Britain. Then again, instead of attacking
Britain, the Tsar might decide to work with Britain against the Reich.

<p>This last point underlines the difficulty of a G/R. There is a great deal of inherent friction between the
two Powers, second only to the friction between Britain and France. However, while Britain and France
can and do cooperate quite successfully, true G/R cooperation is rare. The simple truth is that Germany
and Russia find themselves competing for many of the same SCs and growth for one usually comes at the
expense of the other. As each Power expands, the Kaiser is likely to feel increasingly surrounded by his
Russian ally, while the Tsar may get more and more uncomfortable with the powerful German mailed fist
pointed at Russia’s vulnerable middle (i.e., Warsaw and Moscow). While determined and skillful
diplomats can make peace between Teuton and Slav last and I’ve seen contests where Germany and
Russia have worked together successfully to their mutual benefit, games results suggest that in most cases
the two empires will be foes sooner or later.

<p>In this entire chapter, I’ve barely mentioned France. This is somewhat ironic considering that the Franco-
Russian Entente was the historical counterweight to German power. The sad truth, however, is that
France and Russia can do little for each other at game-start except exchange information. This should not
be too surprising, however, given historical events. Militarily, France could do little for Russia during
WWI either, though the French expected the Russians to do a lot for them by distracting the Reich. This
does not mean the Tsar should ignore France as the game gets underway. Like Italy, France makes an
outstanding mid-game ally. Cultivating friendly relations with Paris early in the game may pay handsome
dividends later as both Powers work together to bring down an enemy located in-between.

<p>In summary, the key differences between Russia in <b>Diplomacy</b> and in <b>1900</b> are as follows:

<ul>
<li>Moscow is divided into two spaces: Moscow and Siberia.
<li>Russia is no longer the ally of choice in the east due to the lessening of tension between Austria-
Hungary and Turkey.
<li>Austria-Hungary and Germany are much better able to stand up to Russian aggression. This works
as a constraint on Russia’s offensive potential.
<li>If Russia comes under attack and loses a home SC, but not all four home SCs, it is able to build and
maintain an extra unit. Further, while Russia controls at least one, but not all four, of its home SCs,
Siberia is considered a build site.
</ul>

<p>The bottom line is that Russia is less formidable than its counterpart in <b>Diplomacy</b>, but still quite capable
of being a contender. The latest iteration of Russia, REM Russia, has more defensive power than pre-
Steamroller Russia, but less offensive capability than Steamroller Russia. The end result of all this
tinkering should be that Russia’s chances of winning are now on par with the chances of the other Great
Powers.
