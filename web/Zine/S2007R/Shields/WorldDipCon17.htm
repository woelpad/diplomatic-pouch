<p>How quickly two years goes by!  <br></p>
<p>In the summer of 2005, the 
face to face Diplomacy hobby gathered on C Street in Washington DC for 
the 15th World Diplomacy Convention. Somewhere in between Frank Johansen 
embarrassing the other 85 of us Friday evening, and Frank Johansen continuing 
to embarrass the other 85 of us Saturday morning, the assembled masses 
decided that when WDC returned to North America in 2007, it should be 
held in Vancouver, Canada. This will make WDC 17 both the first to be 
held in Canada and the first on the Pacific coast of North America.  <br>
</p>
<p>We tried to get all the basic 
information about the event out to everyone in a concise and yet visually 
appealing manner such as: <br></p>
<center><p><b>World Diplomacy Championship 
17</b><br>August 9<sup>th</sup> – 12<sup>th</sup>, 
2007<br>University of British Columbia<br>Vancouver, Canada</p>
<p>For more details check out: <a href="http://www.vancouverdiplomacy.ca/" target="_blank">www.vancouverdiplomacy.ca</a> <br>
</p></center>
<p>But the people wanted more, 
so pretty much immediately the questions started. Over the last couple 
years Nathan, Mike and I have tried to respond to a lot of questions 
from Diplomacy player about what they should expect this summer in Vancouver. 
So, when Charles asked us to write this article, I though this would 
be a good opportunity to go back through my inbox, and share some of 
this information with the Pouch’s loyal readers. <br>
 <br></p>
<p><b>C.W. in Istanbul writes – </b><br>
</p>
<p><i>“What’s the best way 
to get to Vancouver, and how can I do it as cheaply as possible?”</i> <br>
</p>
<p>When you’re looking for plane 
tickets check prices both directly to Vancouver, and if you have a little 
bit of extra time, into Seattle. Some of the players who’ve already 
booked found that Vancouver was cheaper, but others were able to save 
a lot of money by flying to Seattle. It apparently depends on where 
the place ticket pricing ouija board lands that day. As long as you 
arrive in Seattle by the morning of Thursday August 9<sup>th</sup>, 
we can get you a ride to and from Vancouver, which is 2.5 to 3 hours 
by car. Just make sure you have plenty of time before your return flight, 
as there can be significant delays at customs driving back into the 
US.  <br> <br></p>
<p><b>B. In Washington DC writes 
– <br></b></p>
<p><i>“What are the accommodations  
like and do they include, for example, some kind of a door that I could 
close so that I don’t keep my roommates awake all night?”</i> <br>
</p>
<p>Yes they do! Rooms are available 
to players in the Gage Residence Hall. We have currently reserved two 
full floors of dorm rooms. The rooms are arranged in a 6-pod room structure 
that share a bathroom and common space, but provide each person with 
their own small bedroom. We encourage you to get together with friends 
and book a pod yourselves. Early booking is always best, so that we 
are able to expand our reservation if needed. The cost to say in the 
dorms is about $42 CAN per person per night. While other options are 
available, the dorms are significantly cheaper and probably serve most 
players needs very well.  <br> <br></p>
<p><b>D.N. in England writes – </b><br>
</p>
<p><i>“What’s the deal with 
this schedule? And who came up with this amazing scoring system? It’s 
the cat’s pyjamas!”</i> <br></p>
<p>Um. Right. The basic scoring 
system is the same style as the one used at WDC 2006 in Berlin, as well 
as at ManorCon and at WAC in Seattle. The schedule is a little different 
than what some people are used to. We will run 6 rounds, starting on 
Thursday night with 2 rounds each of Friday and Saturday, and then a 
final round on Sunday. Although this number of rounds has seemed daunting 
to some players, the fact that we’ve added an ante component to the 
scoring system means that while there is an advantage to playing more 
rounds, the advantage is relatively small, giving players the freedom 
to skip a round or two if they wish.  <br></p>
<p>Part of the thinking that went 
into the decision to start the event on Thursday rather than on the 
traditional Friday, is so that players could make more of a vacation 
out of visiting Vancouver. We encourage players to bring their family, 
and to make the experience not only an opportunity to play some great 
Diplomacy, but also a chance to get to know the Diplomacy community 
a little better by playing tourist and visiting what is truly one of 
the world’s great international cities.  <br></p>
<p>Some of our Canadian hosts 
are already working on some fun non-Diplomacy activities for players 
and their families.  <br> <br></p>
<p><b>E.B. in California writes –  </b><br>
</p>
<p><i>“What’s the venue like 
and what services are available on site?”</i> <br></p>
<p>The convention is being held 
in the Student Union Building on the UBC campus. Since it’s summer, 
there’s less traffic on campus than during the school year, but most 
campus services are open all summer. There are a large number of dining 
options, from fast food to formal dining, to pubs just two floors down 
from the “Party Room” where the games will be held. Stores and other 
dining options are also available just off campus. The Student Union 
Building itself is only about 1 block away from the dorms.  <br>
 <br></p>
<p><b>D.L. in London writes – </b> <br>
</p>
<p><i>“Is there any possibility 
the French won’t win again? I’m just not sure I could take that.”</i> <br>
</p>
<p>Not really. But just go on 
talking in that warm silky voice that we all love. It won’t help, 
but it makes the rest of us feel better no matter what’s going on.  <br>
 <br></p>
<p><b>B.E. in Seattle writes –  </b><br>
</p>
<p><i>“Is there any kind of 
a pre-con for players who want to start their Diplomacy vacation early?”</i> <br>
</p>
<p>Why, yes, there is a pre-con! 
Buz Eddy, who has run Dragonflight for years, is currently planning 
to run a tournament in Seattle the weekend before WDC. Exact details 
are still being worked out, but let us know if you’re interested and 
we’ll point you in the right direction. The Pre-Con is a great opportunity 
to visit what is a WDC-worthy city in its own right, before joining 
up with some of the players from this part of the world for the trip north 
to Vancouver. <br> <br></p>
<p><b>D.M. in Washington DC writes 
– <br></b></p>
<p><i>Dear Sir, I was formerly 
the Finance Minister for the Republic of Togo. I was told by a mutual 
friend that you were someone who could help me to transfer approximately 
$50 million into my US account. If you can simply provide me with your 
bank account number, I will gladly offer you a 10% commission.</i> <br>
</p>
<p>Glad to help! But don’t forget, 
I’m still waiting on that check you said I’d received from the Omani 
Oil Ministry. <br> <br></p>
<p><b>C.S. in France writes – </b><br>
</p>
<p><i>“Is my trophy ready yet?”</i> <br>
</p>
<p>No, but it’s due back form 
the engraver on Tuesday. Sorry about the delay&#8230. <br>
 <br> <br></p>
<p>Well, that’s all we have 
time for in this issue. If you have any question we can answer about 
this summer’s World Diplomacy Convention, drop me an email, or check

<p>See you this summer! <br>
