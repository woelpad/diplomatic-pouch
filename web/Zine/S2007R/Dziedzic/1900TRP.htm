<center><h1>TRIPOLITANIA IN 1900<br>The Keystone 
to North Africa</b></h1>
<h2>by Chris 
Dziedzic</h2>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH=100% SIZE="-1" COLOR="GRAY"></center>
<p>One of the first things I was 
taught about critical and analytical thinking as a freshman at my old 
alma mater was to recognize and identify the biases and latent preconceptions 
that any and every author brings to a piece of writing. With that in 
mind I think it only fair to lay my cards on the table before we get 
into the substance below. <br></p>
<p>First, I have a strong attachment 
to <b>1900</b>. In my years in the hobby, I have come to love this variant 
designed by Baron Powell. It does live up to its attempts to improve 
play balance, to increase player interaction, and to be more historically 
accurate. I relish that players assigned to play neither Austria-Hungary 
nor Italy are resigned to a quick elimination. I love playing Britain 
and hearing more from the Sultan than initial pleasantries. I appreciate 
the historically accurate alterations&#8230 All these things have led me 
to become a pretty strong proponent of <b>1900</b>. In fact, I hope 
strategy articles like this encourage more people to take a turn playing 
a game of this variant.  <br></p>
<p>Second, I have developed a 
passion for utilizing the Caissic analysis promoted by Paul Windsor. 
I still remember the first time I read Paul’s articles on the Diplomatic 
Pouch.  It was a true epiphany in my recreational life. It was similar 
to one I had years ago. When I was a younger baseball fan, I was first 
exposed to Bill James’ writings and the sabermetric analysis of baseball. 
It had the same impact as my introduction to Paul Windsor’s writings 
and Caissic analysis for <b>Diplomacy</b>. In both cases, the writings 
and the ideas they contained threw back the curtains and revealed a 
more thoughtful &#8212 and a more beautiful &#8212 game than I had seen before. 
Paul Windsor went on to ask “Indeed, why stop with the standard map? 
There are many popular map variants out there.” I would like to in 
part take up the idea of applying Caissic analysis to <b>1900</b>. Therefore, 
you will notice sprinklings of Caissic analysis in this article. <br>
</p>
<p align="center">*****
</p>
<p>One of the lessons I have learned 
from playing, GMing and observing games in the hobby, is the danger 
that comes from an over-reliance on supposed conventional wisdom. What 
can be just as risky is when a player enters a game of <b>1900</b> with 
the intellectual baggage of conventional wisdom from standard <b>Diplomacy</b>. 
Baron Powell termed it the “Diplomacy Hangover.” Specifically, many 
players of <b>1900</b> have relied on their conventional wisdom from 
numerous experiences of <b>Diplomacy</b> games and drew upon those experiences 
to determine strategy and tactics on the new field of play. While there 
are many affinities between <b>Diplomacy</b> and <b>1900</b>, making 
it less alien to new players than some other variants, there are significant 
differences. The alteration of the North African portion of the map 
is one of those changes.</p>
<center><p><img src="tripoli.gif"></center>
<p>Let us start by comparing and 
contrasting the status of the Tunis supply center in <b>Diplomacy</b> 
with the Tripolitania supply center in <b>1900</b> in the larger North 
African geography. On the <b>Diplomacy</b> map, there are two land spaces 
at this southern edge of the board, the neutral supply center named 
Tunis and the large province to its west called North Africa. On the <b>
1900</b> map, Baron Powell has extended the map further allowing the 
coastline of the continent of Africa to extend all the way to the eastern 
side of the board. This larger land area is divided into seven land 
spaces. From east to west along the seacoast, those spaces are: the 
supply center Egypt, the province Cyrenaica, the supply center Tripolitania, 
the province Tunisia, the supply center Algeria, the supply center Morocco 
and lastly the landlocked province Southern Algeria.  
</p>
<p>Some suggest Tunis is a backwater 
on the standard <b>Diplomacy</b> map. Tunis is the only neutral supply 
center that is not adjacent to any other supply center, being the only 
supply center in North Africa. With only this single supply center, 
this portion of the map only contains 5.56% of the eighteen supply center 
total needed to win a game of <b>Diplomacy</b>. Why invest multiple 
units and great time in convoys or redirection from other operations 
when the rewards are so meager? This isolation certainly reduces the 
strategic priority of Tunis for every power other than Italy at the 
start of the game. Neither Britain nor France will be highly concerned 
with the disposition of Tunis until a mid-game Mediterranean campaign 
is afloat – until then there are greater priorities. At first glance, 
only Italy will give significant immediate consideration to Tunis in <b>
Diplomacy</b> because this is the one uncontested neutral for guaranteed 
first year Italian growth. </p>
<p>Even Italy, however, may make 
the acquisition of Tunis a secondary consideration.  In fact, one 
could argue that the continued availability of Tunis could reduce its 
priority for some Italian players.  Tunis’ isolation requires 
the use of extra tempi in the conquest and then the redeployment of 
the unit(s) used in the conquest. If one uses a fleet to take Tunis 
in <b>Diplomacy</b>, it leaves the Ionian Sea unoccupied for a season 
and thus loses influence over the Adriatic Sea, Albania, Greece, the 
Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea until the fleet returns. 
If one uses a convoyed army to take Tunis, it requires the commitment 
of a precious second unit early in the game, when units are at a premium. 
Since the further uses of that army in Tunis are negligible, another 
season is needed to convoy that army to another theater of operations, 
like the Balkans. While it can be argued that this situation supports 
the rapid conquest of Tunis as early as possible to speed the redeployment, 
there are some Italian players who will treat their units and their 
tempi preciously, especially in the early going. Those players will 
prefer to project their limited force to points of conflict on the board, 
much as some French players in a game of <b>Diplomacy</b> will prefer 
to send their first units to the battle lines against England or Germany, 
leaving uncontested neutrals in Spain in Portugal for latter built units. 
As one example, Leif Bergman relegated Tunis to a third year conquest 
in his strategy for successful Italy play in the Fall 1997 Movement 
issue of <i>The</i> <i>Diplomatic Pouch 
‘Zine </i><a href="/Zine/F1997M/Bergman/Italy.html">Go Fasta, Go Fasta: Winning with Italy the Fast Way</a>.
</p>
<p>In stark contrast, Tripolitania 
in <b>1900</b> is the avenue for three powers, Britain, France and Italy, 
to dominate North Africa. This sliver of Africa is not a backwater on 
Baron Powell’s redrawn map. North Africa is no longer synonymous with 
a single neutral, but instead is the home of four supply centers. That 
represents 22.2% of the centers needed to achieve an eighteen center 
solo victory in <b>1900</b>. No longer are we viewing a negligible part 
of the board. This is a pocket of supply centers, like the Balkans or 
Scandinavia, that is worth investing both time and forces to subdue 
early on.</p>
<p>There is another difference 
between Tunis in <b>Diplomacy</b> and Tripolitania in <b>1900</b>. Tunis 
is exclusively within Italy’s orbit at game start in <b>Diplomacy</b>. 
By design, this was an assured conquest for the green units. This is 
a double-edged sword, however. It does ensure Italy of an early build, 
but it takes away a bargaining chip that Italy badly needs to jumpstart 
significant negotiations with other powers.  This feeds the well-known, 
but unwelcome, diplomatic situation where Italy finds itself outside 
of both of the two great triangles of eastern and western powers. This 
is not the case for <b>1900</b>’s Tripolitania. As elsewhere on the 
map, formerly safe neutrals from <b>Diplomacy</b> have been largely 
replaced by hotly contested battle fronts. With the location of a British 
fleet in Egypt and a French army in Algeria at the start of the game, 
along with the Italian fleet in Naples, all three powers can reach Tripolitania 
by the fall of the first game year. </p>

 <br>
<p>Next to Switzerland, Tripolitania 
might be the most highly contested neutral out of the starting gate 
in <b>1900</b>. Three powers have a strong interest and voice in the 
ownership of Tripolitania in this first game year. As discussed above, 
each of Britain, France and Italy can move a unit to stake a claim to 
this patch of North Africa. Though Turkey has managed to claim Tripolitania 
first on rare occasions, it is really not a threat to control this neutral 
supply center at game start.</p>

<center><blockquote><i>(Statistics 
as of May 2007)</i></blockquote></center>
<p>These statistics show a couple 
of welcome correlations between the game play of <b>1900</b> and historical 
realism. In the time period that is being recreated, Tripolitania was 
still a Turkish province. The Ottomans did not leave until the Treaty 
of Lausanne in 1912. This is reflected in the thin, nominal yellow border 
around the Tripolitania space on the <b>1900</b> map.  The fact 
that Turkey still occasionally, if infrequently, has initial control 
of Tripolitania is a comforting alignment of game play and historical 
realism. A second such instance is the high percentage of Italian ownership, 
just over 50% in the games tracked. In another parallel to the true 
course of history, Italy most often obtains Tripolitania by default, 
in large part because the other protagonists, Britain and France, have 
more pressing concerns.</p>
<p>Tripolitania, along with Sweden 
and Portugal, is often one of the last neutrals to be occupied in <b>
1900</b>. Often this is because of a bounce that develops in Fall ’00 
since none of the three interested powers can put a second unit on Tripolitania 
in the first year, making the disposition of this neutral a diplomat’s 
dream. It is not unheard of for Tripolitania to go unclaimed in Fall 
’01 and even in Fall ’02. As mentioned earlier, Italy often ends 
up with Tripolitania because both Britain and France have more urgent 
needs for their units and simply allow Italy to have it, just as happened 
in our own time line.  </p>
<p>Should ownership of Tripolitania 
remain contested, as time progresses it is easiest for Italy to maintain 
the military pressure and bring further units in after an initial bounce. 
First, both Britain and France will have other pressing issues to address. 
Second, Italy has the closest build center of the three to generate 
new units. That gives it an advantage over its competitors in any war 
of attrition that may develop.</p>

 <br>
<p>One of the most important impacts 
of the new North African geography in <b>1900</b> is that the contention 
over Tripolitania leads to extensive and substantial diplomacy among 
the three interested powers: Britain, France and Italy. Another diplomatic 
triangle is formed by these three powers. This new diplomatic triangle 
(which I’ll term the North African Triangle) supplements the traditional 
diplomatic arrangement of the two great triangles &#8212  Britain / 
France / Germany and Austria-Hungary / Russia / Turkey &#8212 that most 
players are familiar with from <b>Diplomacy</b>. This increase in player 
interaction that Baron Powell instilled in the variant encourages players 
to think outside of the box and consider new strategic possibilities. 
This leads to increases in each power’s diplomatic clout as a variety 
of new combinations among the seven great powers emerge.
</p>
<p align="center">*****
</p>
<p>So, what are the three powers 
in question to make of this new diplomatic triangle? How will each one 
navigate the new political landscape? Each power is going to have different 
priorities regarding the initial acquisition of Tripolitania to fuel 
first year growth. Each power also has different abilities and options 
to take place units adjacent to Tripolitania to affect its allocation.
</p>
<h1><center>BRITAIN</h1></center>
</p>
<p>How does Britain maneuver within 
the new diplomatic North African Triangle as the three powers jockey 
for ownership of Tripolitania? <br></p>
<p>Britain may not have the highest 
priority to occupy Tripolitania to stimulate growth, given that there 
are seven other neutral supply centers within its reach in the first 
game year (Belgium, Denmark, Morocco, Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, 
and Spain). However, Britain has reasons to consider Tripolitania for 
a first year acquisition. Some Prime Ministers believe Egypt to be untenable. 
They see that the Sultan can produce and develop attacking units more 
quickly than Britain can produce and develop defenders in that Middle 
Eastern theater of conflict. Turkey can field newly built units at Damascus, 
which is only two tempi distant from Egypt, while Britain’s nearest 
build centers at Liverpool and London are each three tempi away and 
further require the use of the Suez Canal rules and half strength movement 
from the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. Given this, the idea of trading away one 
non-build supply center for another in North Africa &#8212 thereby shortening 
supply lines and consolidating scattered forces into supportive positions 
&#8212 could be appealing. Baron Powell has already discussed the strengths 
of a pair of fleets should Britain choose to order F Gibraltar to the 
Mid-Atlantic Ocean and then into Egypt in the Fall 2002 Movement issue 
of <i>The</i> <i>Diplomatic Pouch ‘Zine </i>
<a href="/Zine/F2002M/Powell/1900_Britain.html">1900: Britain</a>.
I would urge British players to also analyze the strength of a British 
position in the <u>central</u> Mediterranean when the initial fleet 
Egypt works westward and the initial fleet Gibraltar works eastward 
into a mutually supportive position in the central Mediterranean as 
Britain continues to survey the diplomatic landscape. This is a strategy 
that a Prime Minister should consider. <br></p>
<p>Taking this consolidation approach 
one step further, reflect for a minute on the Caissic analysis of Paul 
Windsor. He wrote eloquently about the power of a forward unit in his 
submission to the Summer 1998 Retreat issue of <i>The Diplomatic Pouch 
‘Zine</i> 
<a href="/Zine/S1998R/Windsor/caissa.html">Caissa At The Diplomacy Table</a>.
One Mediterranean fleet can be a useful weapon for Britain in a war 
against either France or Italy (or both in succession for Prime Ministers 
who are committed to striving for eighteen centers). Most Presidents 
and Popes will expect to wage a war with Britain around the entrance 
of the Atlantic into the Mediterranean. The British have an opportunity, 
by placing a fleet in Tripolitania, to have a unit situated in the middle 
of the opponent’s Mediterranean holding with little work. In a tactical 
struggle that follows, Britain’s opponent will have to expend several 
tempi surrounding and destroying that unit, instead of making tactical 
advances westward towards the Pillars of Hercules. This crippling influence 
on the adversary’s position will be greatly magnified if Britain consolidates 
its two Mediterranean fleets in Egypt and Gibraltar to give it a double-barrelled forward unit in the middle of the Mediterranean theater. Picture 
two British fleets working in tandem against Algeria&#8230 or against Naples&#8230 it is enough to excite the First Lord of the Admiralty.  <br>
</p>
<p>All that theory discussed, 
few Prime Ministers move F Egypt to Cyrenaica in conjunction with F 
Gibraltar moving eastward in a larger neutralist strategy of consolidation. 
Current play trends in <b>1900</b> games tell us that a British Spring 
’00 order of F Egypt to Cyrenaica is almost always anti-Italian and 
pro-French. This is based on a couple of factors. First, Italy is going 
to view Tripolitania as its fair share of the neutrals on the board. 
Unless the Prime Minister has reached an understanding with the Pope 
in which some very lucrative sweeteners have been offered, it is unlikely 
that a move towards Tripolitania could be cast as “neutralist.” 
Second, recognize what Britain <u>cannot</u> do when it chooses to open 
F Egypt to Cyrenaica. A British move of F Egypt to Cyrenaica to challenge 
the ownership of Tripolitania, and forgoing an order of F Egypt to the 
Mid-Atlantic Ocean to challenge the French for ownership of the crucial 
sea spaces in practice most often signals the early formation of an 
Entente Cordiale and thus spells trouble for Italy. The alterations 
from standard <b>Diplomacy</b> give Italy a westward lean, bringing 
it into conflict with France more frequently. Prime Ministers often 
get to choose which side of the war it will take to maximize his own 
options for expansion and conquest. Therefore, from Rome it is going 
to be hard to sell a move in the direction of Tripolitania as anything 
other than anti-Italian and pro-French, as much for what the British 
move does as for what it precludes. <br></p>
<p>With that play history in mind, 
British players need to tread carefully when discussing novel approaches 
to moving F Egypt towards Tripolitania. Certainly, it could be neutralist 
consolidation as described above in depth. True, the British fleet positioned 
in Cyrenaica could be used simply as a way to cover Egypt with a fall 
bounce against a Turkish advance through Palestine, since the Suez Canal 
rules preclude such a defensive bounce at half strength from the Mid-Atlantic 
Ocean, and ordering to the Eastern Mediterranean or to Palestine appears 
aggressively anti-Turkish. Yes, the British fleet in Cyrenaica could 
be used to support the Italians into Tripolitania in the face of French 
opposition in the form of an army posted in Tunisia or Southern Algeria. 
However, many Italian players are going to find those arguments unconvincing. 
They will see that British fleet in Cyrenaica as too close for comfort 
and an unwelcome complication for their own desires for expansion. In 
fact, given the statistics posed in the first half of this article, 
London will often be viewed by Rome as the main rival for Tripolitania, 
adding a level of mistrust in Anglo-Italian relations if the British 
start suggesting they move to Cyrenaica. Prime Ministers are best served 
by allowing their counterparts in Rome to suggest a move to Cyrenaica 
for one of these novel approaches, as opposed to making the suggestion 
themselves, so as not to undermine otherwise benign intentions. <br>
</p>
<p>Britain and France can certainly 
reach an accommodation, along the lines of the Entente Cordiale. This 
alignment will also have impacts on the disposition of Tripolitania. 
On one hand, an easy division of the North African supply centers along 
an east/west fault line presents itself, with Morocco and Algeria falling 
in the French sphere and Tripolitania and Egypt falling in the British 
orbit.  If expecting early conflict with Italy, those two powers 
can order a devastating combination of A Algeria to Southern Algeria 
and F Egypt to Cyrenaica. This ensures the capture of Tripolitania in 
the fall against any Italian opposition. In fact, the prospect of loosing 
an autumn battle for Tripolitania by a 2:1 force ratio may encourage 
the Italian player to instead use its fleet in the Ionian Sea to make 
an attempt at Greece. Taking advantage of the psychological impacts 
of game theory, the Pope may prefer a small chance at gaining Greece 
as opposed to <u>no</u> chance of gaining Tripolitania. The next layer 
of diplomatic manipulation is that Italy may strive to make enough noise 
about the prospect of an order of F Ionian Sea to Greece so as to discourage 
Turkey from wasting a season going for the same neutral but instead 
causing it to consider Bulgaria as its initial Balkan prize. This set 
of developments not only definitely denies Tripolitania to Italy, but 
has the added bonus of also souring Italo-Turkish relations by diverting 
Italian expansion towards Greece. Such diplomatic discord in the East 
will be greatly welcome by British and French leaders working in common. <br>
</p>
<p>The other important option 
for Britain to consider is bargaining away Tripolitania to either France 
or Italy as a way of cementing a bilateral alliance. Given the larger 
number of neutral supply centers that Britain can reach in the first 
game year, eight as opposed to France’s six or Italy’s three, such 
a magnanimous gesture does not cripple Britain’s prospects for growth. 
A superb way to finalize a potential Anglo-Italian alliance, especially 
directed against France, if for Britain to recognize Italian claims 
to Tripolitania and to agree to a DMZ covering Cyrenaica. This gives 
the Pope the peace of mind he needs to gain a first year build without 
British interference and also frees up the British fleet in Egypt for 
adventures in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean. On the other hand, the Prime Minister 
could offer to his French colleague to support his claims to Tripolitania, 
even offering to move the Egyptian fleet into Cyrenaica to be able to 
support the French army into the neutral in the fall in the face of 
the likely attempted Italian landing. Such an opening not only gives 
direct aid to French expansion, but removes the fear that most Presidents 
have of a British fleet poised in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean like a sword 
at the Third Republic’s vitals. <br></p>
<h1><center>FRANCE</h1></center>
<p>How can France best serve its 
interests in the new diplomatic triangle that is formed by Tripolitania? <br>
</p>
<p>Returning to a moment to the 
concept of “Diplomacy Hangover” discussed at the beginning of the 
article, many players come into <b>1900</b> games have the perception 
that France is sitting on top of a gold mine of supply centers in Iberia 
and North Africa. They see Spain and Portugal as the natural French 
gains that they are in <b>Diplomacy</b>, forgetting the British fleet 
in Gibraltar that will contest France for those supply centers. They 
see Belgium and consider it in play for France, oblivious to the fact 
that it is now a safe German build. They see a new neighboring supply 
center in Switzerland, but may not consider German and Italian counterclaims. 
They spot the abundance in North Africa within striking distance of 
Army Algeria, but fail to see the power Britain and Italy can project 
into the region. France suffers from a combination of its fearsome reputation 
from <b>Diplomacy</b> and the further perceived advantages conveyed 
by the alterations in <b>1900</b>. As with other avenues for expansion, 
France must carefully lay the diplomatic groundwork before any military 
strike at Tripolitania.  <br></p>
<p>France can take Tripolitania, 
but the benefits of doing so are rather limited. The North African theater 
is difficult for France to reinforce, especially in the early game. 
Its units are most frequently needed n metropolitan France for home 
defense. L&#39;Armée d&#39;Afrique can only hold one supply center at a time. 
It is arguable that the French starting unit Army Algeria is the weakest 
unit on the board. Generally, a French successful campaign to conquer 
North Africa, including Tripolitania, will not occur until the mid-game. <br>
</p>
<p>Taking all of this into account, 
I believe that it may be in France’s best interest to use Tripolitania 
primarily as a carrot for the British or Italian player and not primarily 
as an opportunity for growth for itself. Because so many Popes consider 
this neutral should be Italian property, a French move toward it can 
often be tantamount to an act of war towards Rome. France should shy 
away from Tripolitania so as to avoid instigating a conflict in the 
first year with Italy. No President should want a Pope looking to spill 
French blood early on. France would have to trust Britain significantly 
for such an aggressive and anti-Italian effort, and in Spring ‘00 
such a secure relationship is not an automatic. <br></p>
<p>To affect the disposition of 
Tripolitania, France can move its Army Algeria into either Southern 
Algeria or Tunisia in Spring ‘00. Given that choice, the French player 
should <u>always</u> choose a move to Southern Algeria over a move to 
Tunisia. As Baron Powell points out in  the Fall 2002 Retreat issue 
of <i>The</i> <i>Diplomatic Pouch ‘Zine </i>
<a href="/Zine/F2002R/Powell/1900_France.html">1900: France</a>,
the move to Southern Algeria is the better alternative because it still 
allows the French player the flexibility to influence events in neighboring 
Morocco. Both moves allow for a defensive covering of Algeria in the 
fall as well as influence over Tripolitania. Moving to Tunisia, however, 
relinquishes any voice over the fall disposition of Morocco. Especially 
early in the game, as players have to figure out whom they can trust 
and build working relationships, a little precaution is excusable. For 
France to protect itself in this very subtle way from British perfidy 
shows prudence, and it keeps options open for the fall. When things 
are as uncertain as they always are in Spring ’00, it can be a disaster 
if France surrenders any influence over Morocco only to have the British 
slide the knife in.  <br></p>
<h1><center>ITALY</h1></center>
<p>And what of Italy and its position 
towards Tripolitania and within the new North African Triangle? <br>
</p>
<p>Italy is going to view Tripolitania 
as part of its fair share of the neutrals on the <b>1900</b> map. Of 
the three powers in question, it has the fewest neutrals available in 
the first year to generate builds. The only other neutrals that Popes 
can reach in the first year are Switzerland, which can be contested 
by both France and Germany, and Greece, which can be contested by Turkey. 
True, this is more than the measly Tunis available in standard <b>Diplomacy</b>. 
In contrast, however, both Britain and France have access to more neutrals 
and assured builds.  Britain’s four dispersed fleets can make 
plays for a variety of coastal neutrals: Belgium, Denmark, Morocco, 
Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, and Spain. Likewise, France’s corner 
position offers a variety of options: Belgium, Morocco, Portugal, Spain, 
and Switzerland. Those in command of the green units will be suspicious 
of “greedy” attempts by either Britain or France to add Tripolitania 
to their domain instead. <br></p>
<p>Italy has a couple of ways 
in which it can take Tripolitania. It can choose to act with either 
with a fleet or with a convoyed army. I submit that it is better for 
Italy to take Tripolitania with an army. To draw upon the Caissic principles 
espoused by Paul Windsor, the use of a fleet in the Ionian to take Tripolitania 
directly wastes a valuable tempo. The movement of the fleet into and 
then out of the supply center to reoccupy the Ionian Sea uses two tempi.  
In the meantime, the use of the fleet to take the supply center relinquishes 
control over a key sea space. The temporary evacuation of the Ionian, 
even for a single season, costs influence over Macedonia, Greece, the 
Aegean Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean Sea. That could be decisive 
should Turkey take immediately to Mediterranean expansion. At bare minimum, 
keeping that fleet posted in the Ionian Sea will give the Sultan pause 
about Greece. Can Turkey waste a season bouncing with Italy in Greece 
or should it instead look to greener pastures in Bulgaria, Rumania and 
Serbia? The Pope is best served by subtly directing Turkish expansion 
northwards in the Balkans, in collision with Austro-Hungarian and Russian 
interests. Evacuating the Ionian Sea to take Tripolitania effectively 
relegates the Greek neutral to the Turkish sphere of influence.  <br>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, by using a convoyed 
army, Italy immediately has a second unit at the point of attack for 
an effective campaign to conquer all of the North African supply centers. 
Since neither Algeria nor Egypt can be used as build sites by France 
or Britain, those powers do not have an option of fielding new units 
directly in North Africa, but instead but have them travel multiple 
tempi from their European possessions. In the critical race for Mediterranean 
supremacy, that single turn might make a big difference. A pair of Italian 
units early in the game, working in tandem along the North African coast, 
can make significant headway against isolated, single units fielded 
by France or Britain in defense. Consider the prospects: F Ionian Sea 
and A Tripolitania forcing Cyrenaica in Spring ’01 and then advancing 
against Egypt, or forcing Tunisia in Spring ‘01 and then moving on 
Algeria and Morocco. As long as conditions along the Alpine frontier 
permit, the Italian player should consider using a convoyed army as 
opposed to a fleet.  <br></p>
<p>When the Pope is setting up 
the convoy to Tripolitania, I submit that a Spring ‘00 order of A 
Rome to Apulia is superior to A Rome to Naples. In case of a Fall ‘00 
bounce, which as discussed previously is not infrequent in Tripolitania, 
Naples should be kept open for a potential Winter ‘00 build. Having 
an army clog up one’s own home supply center during the winter adjustment 
phase drastically reduces the Italian player’s freedom of action. 
Developments elsewhere in the Mediterranean may prioritize a fleet build 
in this most southern Italian home supply center to exert further influence 
on either the Ionian or the Tyrrhenian Seas starting as early as Spring 
’01.  <br></p>
<p>One of the best opportunities 
for Italy to gain Tripolitania is for hostilities to erupt between the 
Prime Minister and the President. This occurs regularly and follows 
the historical path of having British and French priorities shifted 
away from Tripolitania, allowing Italian conquest to go unchallenged. 
Should relations across the Channel be strained, the British are likely 
to open with F Egypt to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean supported by its F Gibraltar, 
while France uses its A Algeria to contest Morocco in the Spring ’00. 
Each of these openings takes the military units of other powers further 
away from Tripolitania, allowing the Italians an uncontested landing 
in the Fall ‘00. <br></p>
<p>Should Italy be faced with 
a French army in Tunisia or Southern Algeria or a British fleet in Cyrenaica 
going into the Fall ’00 turn, all is not lost.   <br>
</p>
<p>One gambit that Italian players 
can consider if faced with the prospect of a bounce in Fall ‘00 against 
a British fleet in Cyrenaica is a flank landing. Instead of a convoy 
bouncing in Tripolitania, a convoy could be made into Cyrenaica or Tunisia, 
allowing Britain to successfully order F Cyrenaica to Tripolitania. 
Such a tactic would temporarily cede control of the neutral to Britain. 
This may not be as significant a reverse, however, as it first appears. 
With two units in adjacent provinces opposed by a single British defending 
unit in Tripolitania, the supply center is certain to fall to a Spring 
’00 attack. Furthermore, the Winter ’00 build Britain would gain 
from the conquest of Tripolitania can only be fielded in the three home 
supply centers in the British Isles. Such a unit is multiple tempi from 
the North African theater, and a much greater threat to be used against 
nearer neighbors such as France or Germany. In fact, Italy may be able 
to use the increasing strength of Britain as an argument in finalizing 
an alliance with one of those two powers. This gambit not only lands 
Tripolitania a mere season later for Italy, but tags Britain as a threat 
to France and Germany with the extra British unit popping up in the 
northwest corner of the map, increasing the palatability of an alliance 
with Italy against Britain for either of those powers. The Pope therefore 
has turned a single short term British victory into a double longer 
term reverse.  Of note is that a choice to affect the gambit by 
convoying to Cyrenaica could well lead to an Italian occupied Egypt 
early on. Chances are the British will usually need the rest of their 
naval might in the various Atlantic sea zones for a conflict with France 
and/or Germany While the Prime Minister could commit multiple units to 
a Middle Eastern offensive, as Baron Powell notes in the Fall 2002 Movement 
issue of <i>The</i> <i>Diplomatic Pouch 
‘Zine </i>
<a href="/Zine/F2002M/Powell/1900_Britain.html">1900: Britain</a>
it is statistically rare in the opening. Furthermore, if Turkey has 
not opened south in Spring with A Damascus to Palestine, again a less 
common opening, the Sultan is probably not in a position to challenge 
Italy for control of Egypt. <br></p>
<p>This gambit is not the best 
tool to work with if Italy is faced with a French unit in Tunisia or 
Southern Algeria. Yes, a spring counteroffensive by two Italian units 
against a single French unit is still a viable option. The resulting 
French build, however, will be made much closer to Italy and can be 
brought into action against the Pope more quickly. That new French unit 
is not going to scare the British or Germans nearly as exclusively as 
the new British unit that must be built in the Prime Minister’s three 
home supply centers. Instead of cementing a larger anti-British alliance, 
using this gambit against France will likely only feed the French war 
machine for when it wants to cross the Alps in thirst for Napoleonic 
glory. <br></p>
<p>Of the three powers, Italy 
has the least difficulty in moving a unit in the spring to contest for 
the ownership of Tripolitania in the fall. Italy’s most natural opening 
order for F Naples is to move to the Ionian Sea. This is one of the 
very few orders in <b>1900</b> that is nearly automatic. As of May 2007, 
the opening order of F Naples to the Ionian Sea occurred in 138 out 
of 142 games, which works out to 97.2%. The extremely infrequent exceptions 
have been aggressive anti-French openings where the Italian players 
opened F Naples to the Tyrrhenian Sea to make a direct first year threat 
to Algeria.    <br></p>
<p>Italy will perceive a large 
threat when it sees another power owning Tripolitania, because that 
supply center most effectively serves as its bridgehead to North Africa.  
A French army moving eastward from Algeria, or a British fleet moving 
westward from Egypt threatens to close Italy entirely out of the North 
African theater.  On a larger scale, Italy will always want to 
have a predominant voice in the Mediterranean, the Mare Nostra. Failure 
to establish a beachhead in North Africa, and instead seeing France, 
Britain or even Turkey consolidate a position there will only mean limited 
horizons for growth and headaches in the mid-game. <br>
</p>
<p align="center">*****
<p>The longer term disposition 
of Tripolitania is different from that discussed by Baron Powell and 
Stephen Miller in the Spring 2002 Movement issue of <i>The</i> <i>Diplomatic 
Pouch ‘Zine </i>
<a href="/Zine/S2002M/VonPowell/switzin1900.html">Switzerland in the 1900 Variant</a>.
Unlike Switzerland, which is contiguous to the home supply centers of 
three powers, Tripolitania and the North African theater is not the 
same immediate security concern. It is possible that after a decisive 
campaign in North Africa, that one of the powers can advance units to 
the next theater of conflict, de-prioritizing North Africa. The “odd 
power out” syndrome discussed by Powell and Miller is less likely 
to take effect. It is not as certain that a game moving through mid-game 
and into endgame is going to witness a significant build-up of forces 
around Tripolitania.</p>
<p>As we conclude, what does all 
this mean for the British, French and Italian players in <b>1900</b>? 
First and most obviously, each should navigate the new North African 
Triangle cautiously.  Tripolitania is an important neutral supply 
center especially in the early going, as discussed at length. The ownership 
of this single supply center, however, is not as important as the successful 
maneuvering within the new diplomatic layout Tripolitania offers. A 
player should use the discussions over the disposition of Tripolitania 
to gauge the other great powers within the North African Triangle, while 
keeping in mind that those same powers are likely using the same opportunity 
to size him up. With a little diplomatic skill, a player should be able 
to find out a lot about the diplomatic style and strategic plans of 
the other members of the North African Triangle. This can not only give 
a player early warning of a hostile neighbor or alliance, but also enable 
him to determine just how trustworthy each of the other two is.  <br>
