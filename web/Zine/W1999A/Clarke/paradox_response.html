<br>Good grief, did this one stir you all up into a frenzy! (Mental note:
Next time Manus asks me if I'll be the Guest Editor for an issue of The
Pouch, before agreeing, check the previous issue to see if there are any
articles about convoy paradoxes... if there are, don't bother saying no,
just begin running for the hills straight away....)
<p>Before we start seeing the plethora of responses regarding the article,
it's interesting to note the statistics of your responses:
<p>A total of 298 people responded to the survey. Of these, 45 changed the
vote that they originally cast after reading the two essays.

<p><i><b>Editor's comment: </b>The first set of replies each deal with
an issue with resolution 2 which Simon overlooked when wording his rule:</i>
<p><b>From Brandon Clarke (<a href="mailto:bjc@stevensons.co.nz">bjc@stevensons.co.nz</a>):</b>
<p>Having finished reading the article, I've voted for resolution 1...
I've always thought the beleaguered garrison bit happens before the convoy
gets through to London, so it's the bit that the resolution of the paradox
has to begin with.
<p>I have a major problem with resolution 2.
<p>As Manus points out it requires two exceptions to the rules.
<p>It also creates a third issue neither of you have mentioned:
<p>Rule IX. The support order, 6. Holding and receiving support. Says:
<blockquote><i>"A unit not ordered to move (i.e. one that is ordered to
hold, ordered to convoy, ordered to support, or not ordered at all) may
receive support in holding. A unit ordered to move may receive support
only for its attempted movement. It may not be supported in place in the
event that its attempted move fails."</i></blockquote>
Simon's proposed resolution takes an Army that was ordered to MOVE (i.e.
a unit which cannot receive support to hold) and changes it's status to
an Army that was ordered to HOLD (i.e. one that can receive support to
hold).
<p>What's with that?
<p>It seems simple enough to fix, and I feel strongly that this must be
fixed, or else you'll end up with someone who adds to the situation with
<p>FRANCE: A GAS S A BRE
<p>GERMANY: A PIC S A PAR - BRE
<br>GERMANY: A PAR -BRE
<p>and since the convoyed army now holds, GAS S A BRE is valid, and means
that the attack from PAR fails.
<p>I suggest you change the wording of Proposal 2: to
<blockquote><i>"If a situation arises in which an army's convoy order results
in a paradoxical adjudication, the turn is adjudicated as if the convoying
army had been ordered to hold, except that that army may not receive support
to hold."</i></blockquote>
Brandon Clarke.
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response:</b> You are correct in what you say
(somebody else caught this as well). That was not the intent of the
rule, but you are right that that is the way it reads. I will be
correcting this in a "response article" in the next issue. My rule
meant for the army to stay where it was, but I had not meant for it to
be able to receive support, though the current wording allows that.
Thanks for the feedback.</i>
<p><i>- Simon</i></blockquote>
<p><br><b>From Rod Spade (<a href="mailto:rodspade@acm.org">rodspade@acm.org</a>):</b>
<p>I just read your excellent article about paradoxes in the Pouch, and
I'm certain you're going to get a lot of feedback on this issue.
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's comment: </b>Ya think!??? You ain't seen nothin'
yet...</i></blockquote>
Manus stated that the 1982 rule introduced new paradoxes. I believe
that the revised rule does eliminate all paradoxes, <b>if</b> you interpret
it as saying that the support is not cut even if the fleet is dislodged.
(This is similar to Manus' proposal for modifying the 1976 rule.)
The 1982 rule is poorly worded, and it does not explicitly say that it
overrides the rule that a dislodged unit can not provide support.
However, it makes sense to give the 1982 anti-paradox rule precedence over
all the other rules, because it was introduced <b>after</b> the other rules
(and therefore supersedes them) and because its wording implies that it
is a very specific rule that overrides the general-case application of
the other rules.
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response: </b>Your interpretation is in direct
contradiction with Section X which states that a support is cut if a unit
is dislodged (Or did that section also change in the 1982 rules?).</i>
<blockquote><b>Rod's reply: </b>That's true, but really *any* interpretation
of XII.5 is a contradiction of X - it is the rules themselves that are
in conflict, not just my interpretation. Even the 1976 rule is an
*exception* to the general precepts of cutting support.</blockquote>
<i>I see no reason for the convoy rule to take precedence over all other
rules just because it was introduced after all the other rules.</i>
<blockquote><b>Rod's reply: </b>Here's another reason: The special
convoy rule is more *specific* than the other rules. The other rules
govern the general case, and the convoy rule overrides the other rules
in the scenarios where it applies. Another argument is that because
XII.5 follows X, it overrules it. (You explain the general rules
first, then introduce the special-case exceptions.)</blockquote>
<i>Somebody buying the game now doesn't know about earlier rule books.
In other places in the rules, if there is an exception to a rule, it is
explicitly stated (such as the section on self-standoff). Otherwise,
the rules are a "set" and there is not supposed to be any precedence or
ordering in their application because adjudication is supposed to be simultaneous.
For somebody who does not know about earlier rule books and convoy problems,
to accept your interpretation is to accept a direct contradiction between
two rules in two different sections, without any explicit indication in
the rules as to which should be applied first or which takes precedence
over the other.</i>
<blockquote><b>Rod's reply: </b>Even if you don't accept my interpretation,
the rules still contradict each other, and you must choose to give one
precedence.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
Manus stated that he dislikes the 1982 rule because it forbids the army
from cutting even more supports than the 1976 rule - that it can not cut
support for or against <b>any fleet in water</b>. However, this is
not wholly accurate - the support is not cut only if it is for or against
a fleet that is <b>convoying</b>. (Of course, we could argue about
the exact definition of "convoying fleet", but that's another matter.)
It is more broad than the 1976 rule, but that is not a reason to discard
the revised 1982 rule. Any rule that resolves all paradoxes <b>must</b>
cover more cases than the 1976 rule, and the 1982 rule is a good solution.
<p>So does the 1982 rule make sense? It implies that support for
or against a convoying fleet succeeds or fails <b>before</b> a convoying
army is able to cut the support. Note that I am not saying that <b>attacks</b>
on convoying fleets occur "before" a convoyed army moves, only that the
related <b>supports</b> are resolved before the army is able to complete
its movement. Remember that a turn in Diplomacy is a six month ordeal,
so if we wish to discuss a "realistic" basis for order adjudications, we
should consider the actions of the units to be processes than span the
course of six months, rather than discrete events that all happen at a
single instant in time. It is not far-fetched to imagine a model
where fleets secure support for/against convoys before convoying armies
land enough forces to cut support. Some may argue that this violates
the "simultaneity" principle of Diplomacy. However, I would argue
that even the normal occurrence of cutting support is not truly simultaneous
- attacks generally cut support <b>before</b> movements succeed or fail.
(All attacks happen "simultaneously" during the six month movement period,
but gathering forces prevent a defender from lending support elsewhere
<b>before</b>
a triumphant army finalizes its conquest of another territory and actually
dislodges the defender.) It has always been true that we must consider
the effects of some moves before finalizing the adjudication of others,
and it is natural to extend this principle to the resolution of convoy
paradoxes. If we accept the underlying concept of the 1982 rule,
then it makes sense to apply it broadly and literally, which precludes
paradoxes.
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response: </b>Even if I buy your justification
based on realism (moves taking six months) and I acknowledge the fact that
one must consider some rules before adjudicating others despite simultaneity,
I still maintain that accepting your interpretation means accepting two
rules that are in direct contradiction, and choosing to give one precedence
over the other without anything explicit in the rules telling you that
one has precedence over the other.</i>
<p><i>I think that the average gamer (not an avid fan of Diplomacy) would
never interpret the rules the way you have, because there is no reason
for it to occur to them to do so given the current wording of the rule
book.</i>
<blockquote><b>Rod's reply:</b> That is true. When I first read the
rule, it seemed so bizarre that I assumed it must apply only to the scenario
spelled out in the example.</blockquote>
<i>The rules do not say "This rule is an exception to the rule on support
by dislodged units and takes precedence over it..." so there is no reason
to think that it should.</i>
<blockquote><b>Rod's reply: </b>If we do not allow the rule to take precedence
over any other, then we must throw it away entirely. Section X says
that an attack (from a space other than the target of the support) cuts
support. We accept that XII.5 is an exception that overrules this.
XII.5 says that in a certain scenario "support is not cut." It does
NOT say "unless the unit is dislodged". The provision about dislodgement
is part of X, and XII.5 overrides X. If XII.5 does not override X,
then XII.5 *never* applies. How can we cut apart the first sentence
of X, and say that XII.5 is an exception to *part* of that sentence, but
another part of the sentence overrules XII.5? Without an explicit
exception to the exception, we must assume that XII.5 means exactly what
it says - the support is not cut. Period. From this point of
view, Manus' proposal is merely a clarification of the existing 1982 rules,
not an actual change. Of course, that's only my interpretation.
:-)</blockquote>
<i>I think it is more likely that Avalon Hill fixed one kind of paradox
without realizing they introduced another, than it is that the really fixed
everything but worded a rule badly (in contradiction to another rule without
pointing out the contradiction, and/or without making a statement of precedence).</i></blockquote>
Regarding Simon's proposal, if an army's movement would result in a paradox,
we pretend that it was ordered to hold. Does this mean that it can
receive support in holding? I suspect that this was not Simon's intent,
in which case perhaps the wording of the proposal should be clarified.
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response: </b>You are correct. That was
not my intent, but that is the way it reads. Somebody else caught
that as well. I'll have to modify the actual wording in the rule
(but the idea behind the rule still remains unchanged).</i></blockquote>
I look forward to reading everyone's replies to your article - it is bound
to be a lively discussion!

<h4>
From Pre (<a href="mailto:pre@dalliance.net">pre@dalliance.net</a>):</h4>
Simon says "The convoyed army is adjudicated as if it were ordered to hold".
<p>I changed my mind during the arguments (while not being completely sure
this isn't some test to see how many people do that or not, but then I'm
distrusting in general). The thing that finally convinced me was wondering
what would happen if the army in Bre were under attack from Par and Pic
and supported to hold from Gas. Does this adjudication really act as if
the unit were ordered to hold? Would a unit which was ordered to move really
still be able to recieve support from a unit to stand still if that doesn't
work? I'm sure the rule change could be constructed to work out that problem
(assuming Simon even agrees it is a problem) too but as it stands at least
it simply doesn't.
<p>Thanks for the great work.

<p>Hi,
<p>Enjoyed the discussion of the two proposed rules. A 3rd possible
rule occurred to me (although I don't know if it would deal with all the
possible paradoxes):
<blockquote><i>"A beleaguered fleet cannot convoy".</i></blockquote>
It certainly deals with the paradox highlighted in the article.

<b>From Rick Desper (<a href="mailto:R.Desper@dkfz-heidelberg.de">R.Desper@dkfz-heidelberg.de</a>):</b>
<p>Regarding the "paradox" and the two proposals..., basically, there is
no real justification to having the army hold. OTOH, there is a justification
to letting the army go through the convoy.
<p>What is this justification? It's a logical outgrowth of the "dislodged
fleets cannot convoy"?
<p>I would prefer it if dislodged fleets could convoy. This would
remove all the problems with paradoxes and so forth. But probably
Calhamer thought that this would make England too powerful, so he put in
the rule about convoys being vulnerable to fleet attacks.
<p>What exactly can we infer as a conclusion from this rule? Well,
if convoys don't happen at all when a fleet is dislodged, it means that
the convoy happens _later_ than the attack on the convoying fleet.
<p>Once you adopt this attitude, everything else falls through nicely.
This attitude is consistent with the rule in the book saying that a convoy
cannot cut a support for an action which contains a convoying fleet.
Why can it not cut this support? Because it's too late! The
convoy didn't start until it determined the route was safe. Once
it's
<br>safe, that means the naval battle is over.
<p>The problem here is that people who have some introduction to mathematical
logic are viewing these events as logical variables which are invariant
in time. E.g., somebody says something like "if the convoy gets through,
the support gets cut, so the fleet is vulnerable and then the convoy doesn't
get through, etc."
<p>But we already know that dislodged fleets do not convoy. What
is the inference? If the fleet is dislodged, the convoy does not happen.
End of story. If the convoy happens, the fleet is not dislodged.
Don't view these things as logical variable. View them as events
that happen in time. Is the army sitting in Brest, calculating its
impact upon the logical structure of the universe before deciding whether
it can sail across the Channel? No! It's sitting there deciding
whether the convoy is safe. Once it is safe, the convoy goes, and
that's the end of it. The convoy doesn't disrupt its safeness.
_That_ would be a paradox.
<p>I really dislike the idea that the army should hold. Replace your
example with an example in which the army is going to Liverpool instead.
) Add a fleet in Irish as necessary). Clearly in that case, the army
goes through, right? So, why then should it not go through to London?
In both cases you have a safe convoy route. In the Lpl
<br>case, the route is clearly to be used. Why, then, not in the
second case? Because the army is worried about destroying the logical
structure of the universe? Such a profound concern is beyond the
bounds of the army. Armies either move when they are ordered to do
so, or they don't.
<p>This reminds me of a typical problem with people who think time travel
might be possible. Movies have this idea that Michael J. Fox can
travel in time as long as he hides in the background and therefore doesn't
meet himself at a period in time in which he met himself. But that's
not how the universe works. The laws of physics do not depend upon
the vagaries of fate. By this I mean, if you let somebody travel
in time, you have to accept that he can then "change the past", since the
"past" is now the present.
<p>Anyway, I digress.
<p>I think you are framing the discussion not quite perfectly. The
dispute here is between two rules, one of which says that a convoy cannot
cut support, and the other which says that a dislodged force cannot offer
any support.
<p>To accept the Proposal 1, all you have to do is say the former rule
outweighs the latter. Jamie Dreier has in the past recommended this
interpretation, as the former rule was added to the rule book later than
the latter rule. Furthermore, adopting this attitude removes all
paradoxes from the game.
<p>The only thing which causes the paradox is the idea that the latter
rule should supersede the former! So, really, this is the case in
which you have two contradictory rules. If you choose one to supersede
the other, you have no paradoxes. If you choose the other way around,
you do have paradoxes. The choice should be clear.
<p>To address a few fine points:
<p>"The rule works fine for getting rid of paradoxes. But it asks you to
accept that a destroyed unit can successfully support an attack. Granted,
a destroyed fleet providing successful support is not a general rule, but
only comes into play in a paradoxical situation in order to eliminate a
paradox. But for me, saying it applies as an exception rather than a general
rule does not make it easier to swallow. To me, a destroyed unit should
simply not be able to successfully support an attack, any attack, at any
time."
<p>Well, you are adding a paradox to the rules by adapting this attitude.
We have already got a rule which specifically says that the convoyed army
does not cut this support. We already know that convoys do not go
through fleets which are dislodged. The minimal-pain interpretation
would be that the time for dislodging the fleet is over, and now we deal
with the effects of the convoy.
<p>"I speak only for myself here, and I have no doubt that there will be
people who feel more strongly than I about this issue of realism, as well
as people who are not particularly bothered by the idea. It's just me."
<p>Well, look through deja.com and search the r.g.d. archive for "Ghost
Ships". I wrote specifically on this topic a few years ago.
I was defending what you call Proposal 2 and Jamie Dreier was defending
Proposal 1. Jamie argued what I say above, a point-of-view that I
have adopted. There is no rule book justification for denying the
<br>convoy. If the convoying fleet is there, the convoy goes.
If the convoy goes, then it dislodges. There is, however, a rule
book justification for not having the support cut. All you have to
do is decide that the convoy/support cut rule supersedes.
<p>BTW, you gloss over the whole issue of the difference between the '76
rules and the '82 rules. I have, this week on r.g.d., argued (forcefully,
I think) that the '82 rules really are necessary. In other words,
you cannot just say that a convoy cannot cut support if the support affects
that particular convoy. You have to say it cannot cut support if
that support affects ANY convoy.
<p>Here's the example:
<p><b>England:</b>
<br>F Edi S Ger F Nth
<p><b>France:</b>
<br>A Bre - Edi; F Eng C A Bre - Edi; F Iri C A Bre - Edi; F NAO C A Bre
-
<br>Edi; F Nwg C A Bre - Edi; A Cly S A Bre - Edi
<p><b>Germany:</b>
<br>A Hol - Lon; F Nth C A Hol - Lon; A Yor S A Hol - Lon
<p><b>Italy:</b>
<br>F Lon S F MAO - Eng; F MAO - Eng
<p><b>Russia:</b>
<br>F Nwy S F Ska - Nth; F Ska - Nth
<p>Let C1 = "convoy Bre-Edi succeeds", C2 = "convoy Hol-Lon succeeds"
<br>Let A1 " "attack Ska - Nth succeeds", A2 = "attack MAO - Eng succeeds"
<br>Let S1 = "F Edi support valid" and S2 = "F Lon support valid"
<br>Use ~ for negation, => for logical inference.
<p>Then, if you view these things as timeless logical variables, you have
C1 => ~S1 => A1 => ~C2 => S2 => A2 => ~C1 and ~C1 => S1 => ~A1 => C2 =>
~S2 => ~A2 => C1
<p>Clearly this is ridiculous. How can we break one of these logical
equivalencies? I think we have to leave in S2 &lt;=> A2 and
S1 &lt;=> ~A1. And the rules clearly indicate A1 => ~C2 and A2
=> ~C1. So, we are left with C1 => ~S1 and C2 => ~S2. They've
got to go. Which is why the rules were changed between 1976 and 1982.
<p>(A side note, I, personally, would prefer to remove the A1 => ~C2 and
A2 => ~C1 connections. But that would be hard to justify with the
current rule book.)
<br>
<p>So, to summarize, I think it is valid to view this problem as the problem
of choosing which already-existing rule supersedes the other, rather than
the problem of deciding how to fix a paradox. If we choose one precedence,
there is no paradox. If we choose the other, there is a paradox.
Then the problem is compounded, as the solution "the convoy holds" is totally
ad hoc, without any rule book justification.
<p>Yes, adoption of Proposal 1 has the downside that you have to accept
Ghost Ships. Well, we already have some "unrealistic" rules.
Why should it take one season for an army to be convoyed from St Pete to
Smyrna when it would take a fleet 4.5 years to make the same trip? How
can a power support an army in Africa if the only SC he owns is Denmark?
(What kind of magical supply lines are involved here?)
<p>Rick
<p>p.s. Thanks for releasing the new issue today! And I thought I
would get some work done. :(
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's comment: </b>And if you think Rick did well,
just take a peek over at the scroll bar on your browser and imagine how
much there is to go!!!!</i></blockquote>
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response: </b>First off, I agree that if you
interpret the 1982 rules as you suggest, there is no paradox. What
you are basically saying is that the rule that Manus suggested does not
need to be added to the rule book, because it is already there. While
it is convenient to take that interpretation, I'm not completely convinced.</i>
<p><i>The "1982 rule" (saying the convoyed army does not cut support if
it attacks a fleet supporting an action into a body of water convoying
an army, etc.) is in direct contradiction with Section X which states that
a support is cut if a unit is dislodged.</i>
<p><i>You argue that the former should take precedence over preexisting
rules just because it was introduced after all the other rules. I
don't buy that argument for two reasons.</i>
<p><i>First of all, somebody buying the game now doesn't know about earlier
rule books. Secondly, in other places in the rules, if there is an
exception to a rule, it is explicitly stated (such as the section on self-standoff).
In the absence of any statement of exception, the rules are a "set" and
there is no explicit justification to put precedence or ordering in their
application. For somebody who does not know about earlier rule books
and convoy problems, to accept your interpretation is to accept a direct
contradiction between two rules in two different sections, without any
explicit indication in the rules as to which should be applied first or
which takes precedence over the other.</i>
<p><i>I think that the average gamer (not an avid fan of Diplomacy) would
never interpret the rules the way you have, because there is no reason
for it to occur to them to do so given the current wording of the rule
book. The rules do not say "This rule is an exception to the rule
on support by dislodged units and takes precedence over it..." so there
is no reason to think that it should.</i>
<p><i>There are two possibilities that I can see here.</i>
<p><i><b>Possibility 1:</b> There was a paradox problem in the pre-1982
rules. They added a rule to fix it. They did not intend for a dislodged
unit to be able to provide support, so there was no contradiction with
section X of the rules. Unfortunately, they did not notice that they
introduced a new set of problems with the new 1982 rule.</i>
<p><i><b>Possibility 2:</b> There was a paradox problem in the pre-1982
rules. They added a rule to fix it. Their intent was that this rule
should take precedence over section X that says no support from dislodged
units. That makes the new rule in direct contradiction with section
X, but they do not point out the contradiction in the rules, nor do they
indicate that the new rule should take precedence over section X.</i>
<p><i>As you say above, it is convenient to look at the current rules and
say "if you interpret it this way, there is no paradox". However,
I simply don't think that is the interpretation they intended. I
think they missed the new problem. If this is not the interpretation
they intended, then interpreting it that way for convenience means introducing
a contradiction that they had not meant to be there. If they had
not intended that contradiction to be there, then your re-interpretation
of the rules changes the spirit of the rules as much as adding a new rule
would.</i>
<p><i>What it comes down to is what their intent was with that rule.
Is it the intent summarized by possibility 1 above, or possibility 2?</i>
<p><i>To me, possibility 1 is much more likely. They meant the rule
the way most people interpret it, and they didn't notice that they were
causing new problems. Why do I think that? For reasons I've
already mentioned. (1) If they were aware of the contradiction and
meant for the 1982 rule to be an exception to section X, they would have
said so explicitly as they do in other exception cases. (2) There
is nothing in the rules to indicate that one rule should take precedence
over the other. If they recognized the contradiction, they would
not have left it open to two different interpretations and left it up to
people to assume which takes precedence over the other. (3) The argument
that the 1982 rule should take precedence over section X because it was
the newest rule is completely weak. In 1982 to 1985, what do you
think the ratio of boxes sold to first-time buyers vs. people who already
owned the game... 10-1, 20-1? They're in the business of marketing
and selling games. They knew perfectly well that a large percentage
of games sold in a given year are purchased by first-time buyers, and people
buying the game for the first time have no idea of earlier rule books.
Again, if their intent was that the 1982 rules should take</i>
<br><i>precedence, it makes absolutely no sense for them not to say it
explicitly and to assume that people will know what they mean because it's
a new rule.</i>
<p><i>I think it is far more likely that Avalon Hill fixed one kind of
paradox without realizing they introduced another, than it is that they
really fixed everything but worded a rule badly (in contradiction to another
rule without pointing out the contradiction, and/or without making a statement
of precedence). While your interpretation is convenient because it
eliminates the paradoxes without adding a new rule, I don't think that's
what they intended, and I also think that interpreting the rules differently
from what they intended to eliminate paradoxes is as much of a change in
the rules as adding a new rule. Either way, your</i>
<br><i>outcome or mine is different from what they meant.</i>
<p><i>Now my argument assumes one intent, yours assumes another.
The intent you interpret has two justifications. The "newer rule
takes precedence" argument doesn't hold water for me. I also think
the "that's what they meant because it eliminates the paradox" argument
is weak, because if they were aware of the contradiction and that's what
they meant, there are plenty of ways it could have been clarified so that
it wasn't so open to misinterpretation. I think they patched one
problem with a band aid, and didn't realize their bandied was defective
itself.</i>

<b>Editor's comment: </b>This discussion spilled over into other forums,
and the result was that numerous others commented on the issues raised
above. Here's some excerpts... but I warn you, the discussion goes back
and forth, back and forth, and it could possibly turn your head inside
out:
<blockquote><b>From: Jamie Dreier (<a href="mailto:James_Dreier@brown.edu">James_Dreier@brown.edu</a>):</b>
<p>Simon (et al.),
<p>I think there are two reasonable principles to use in interpreting the
rules of games. One is the Intent principle: that we should try to figure
out what the authors of the rules intended. The other is the Charity principle:
that we should interpret the rules so that they make as much sense as possible,
consistent with the actual wording (so that vagueness, conflict, unclarity,
and ambiguity should be resolved in the way that makes most sense). Both
of these principles, I claim, support Rick's and my interpretation of the
Convoyed Armies Do Not Cut Certain Supports rule.
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's comment: </b>I must butt in here and state that
I <b>strongly</b> disagree with Jamie here. I have always argued strongly
on this issue that worrying about intent when looking at the meaning of
the rules of a game is very dangerous. Interpreting rules is similar to
statutory interpretation. When I did law intermediate at university (and
I didn't go on to do a law degree, so I'm only too happy to be corrected
by any experts in statutory interpretation, or, of course, even more happy
to be backed up by them...) I learnt the following approach to statutory
interpretation:</i>
<p><i>When looking at a law, the primary consideration when trying to determine
the meaning of the law is the <b>meaning of the words used to phrase the
law.</b> Since the people who wrote the law may or may not be available
to answer questions about their intentions, we cannot rely on finding out
for sure what their intentions were. We cannot attempt to guess at their
intentions either, because that leads to a grey area where you could perhaps
argue vary degrees of intent, or indeed different intents altogether. The
citizen in the street ought to be able to read the law, and based on the
meaning of the words in the law, work out what the law is, and so base
their actions on that interpretation. It is the responsibility of the law
makers to use language accurately when phrasing laws, so that the citizen
in the street can do so.</i>
<p><i>So, what should the law be when the law makers have used language
carelessly? Let's say they have used language which means one thing, when
the intent was clearly another? In that case the law must be what the law
says as it was written, i.e. the law is what the language used actually
means, not what the law makers intended. The law makers have the ability
to amend the law, and when it becomes clear to the law makers that the
law is not what they intended, or, due to the changing nature of language
it becomes clear that the common meaning of the language used has shifted
from the time the law was drafted to the present day, they should amend
the law, using more accurate language, to bring the meaning of the law
into line with their intention. In the meantime however the law will be
at odds with their alleged intentions.</i>
<p><i>When applying game rules the same principle must hold. If the game
rules say one thing, but it <b>seems </b>the intention was something else,
the rule is what the rule says it is, as per the meaning of the language
used. Trying to come to conclusions about intent, or for that matter applying
Jamie's Charity principle is the wrong approach.</i>
<p><i>Even if you disagree with my strongly "Rules lawyer-ish" approach
here, I think it's clear that as well as Jamie's two approaches of Intent
and Charity, there is a third approach which needs to be considered...
that of Meaning.</i>
<p><i>Brandon Clarke.</i></blockquote>
<b>Charity first.</b>
<br>Interpreting the rule in our way removes paradoxes. Other suggestions
either leave paradoxes, or they simply invent rules that are obviously
not written in the rule book. (The 'beleaguered convoys are disrupted'
rule that you enigmatically mention later is in the latter category.) Interpreting
the rules so that they are literally contradictory is about as uncharitable
as you can get. So Charity very strongly supports our interpretation, at
least until and unless someone else comes up with another feasible interpretation
that avoids paradox.
<p><b>Now Intent.</b>
<br>My best guess is that the authors of the 1982 rule did not notice that
the rule contradicts Rule X. It didn't occur to them. So this is *roughly*
your Possibility 1, thus:
<blockquote><i><b>Possibility 1:</b> There was a paradox problem in the
pre-1982 rules. They added a rule to fix it. They did not intend
for a dislodged unit to be able to provide support, so there was no contradiction
with section X of the rules. Unfortunately, they did not notice that
they introduced a new set of problems with the new 1982 rule.</i></blockquote>
Only 'roughly' because I don't agree that this new rule 'introduces a new
set of problems'. The contradiction with Rule X was already present in
the old 'Convoyed attacks do not protect the convoying fleet' rule. Also,
I think it is somewhat misleading to say "they did not intend for a dislodged
unit to be able to provide support," although it is probably literally
true. My guess is that they did not *intend* any such thing, but neither
did they intend the contrary. It just didn't occur to them.
<p>However, I think this doesn't really matter. It is very clear that the
authors of the 1982 rule intended it *to resolve the paradoxes*. They intended
to be writing a rule that resolves the Pandin paradoxes. Following the
Intent principle, then, we should interpret the rule in such a way that
it really *does* resolve the paradoxes, at least if there is any sensible
interpretation of the English wording that succeeds in doing that.
<p>When Intent and Charity conflict, I give precedence to Charity, myself.
But in this case, I don't think they conflict.
<p>There is a secondary issue: when a pair of rules contradict each other,
should the later rule be taken to overrule the earlier one? I say it should.
I will not argue for giving the later rule precedence in general, but only
for this case.
<p><b>Charity:</b>
<br>If the 1982 rule, as written, is not taken to overrule the old Rule
X, then we still have a contradictory set of rules. This is a most extremely
uncharitable reading of game rules.
<p><b>Intent:</b>
<br>Surely the authors intended that, IF the new rule should conflict with
any existing rule left unamended, the new rule should have precedence.
<blockquote><b><i>Simon Szykman responds:</i></b>
<p><i>I disagree here. You are reading into this an explicit intent
for a new rule to have precedence over old ones. I don't agree with
the conditional part of your sentence... the whole "IF" part.
I think their intent was to introduce a new rule to fix paradoxes (period)
without any intent for this rule to have precedence over other ones because
I do not think they explored the possibility of conflicts.</i>
<p><i>I think the way the rules ended up being written implies that they
didn't notice the conflict with rule X. If they had noticed, I would
think something would have been said about it.</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>I agree that they did not notice
it! That's why I'm talking about *conditional* intention.
<p>Imagine that we asked the authors of the rule: On the condition that
this new rule turns out to conflict with some earlier one, do you intend
for the new one to override the old?
<p>So first they say, "Oh, we don't intend for it to conflict any other
rule." "Right," we say, "we know that. Did you hear the 'if'?"
<p>"Oh, ok," they say. "Well then...." Now, how would you complete the
response? Do you think they would have said, "*IF* our new rule conflicts
with any old one, then the conflict is to be resolved in favour of the
old rule"? So, they would be saying that if their new rule conflicts with
an old one, then the paradoxes may not be resolved at all. The whole point
of the new rule would be defeated.
<p>I find that extremely hard to believe, myself.
<blockquote><i><b>Simon Sykzman responds: </b>I don't. I think that
their rule was broken, and they didn't realize it. You are saying
that if it were pointed out to them, they would say it should have precedence
over section X. I disagree. I am saying that if they had realized
that their rule was broken, and that the only way to fix it was to allow
for the possibility of a destroyed unit providing valid support, that they
would have scrapped their broken rule and looked for another solution.</i>
<p><i>Your interpretation of their rule is the only interpretation of their
rule that eliminates the paradox problem. But that rule is not the
only one that can eliminate paradoxes. Other rules can be developed
that have more benign conflicts with existing rules.</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>Absolutely, other rules can be
developed.
<p>BUT THOSE RULES ARE NOT WRITTEN IN THE RULE BOOK!
<p>I may have misunderstood the point of the discussion. I thought the
question was what the rule is now. That's why I mentioned the two interpretative
principles (Intent and Charity). I am claiming only that those principles
are relevant to interpreting what the rules are now. If we're talking instead
about what rules there ought to be instead of the current ones, that's
an entirely different matter.</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i>You can argue your case based on charity if you wish, but I don't
think you can argue it based on intent. Saying "they intended to fix paradoxes
and introduced the 1982 rule to do it" is very different from saying "they
intended to fix paradoxes and introduced the 1982 rule and intended for
that rule to have precedence over other rules." To say that their intent
was to have the 1982 rule override preexisting rules in the case of a conflict
is unfounded. There is no indication that the latter is the case.</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>The whole point of the 1982 rule
is to resolve the paradoxes. That is the intent. There is no possible alternative
explanation for the 1982 rule. According to your interpretation, the obvious
intent of the rule is utterly thwarted. The rule is rendered pointless.
The only thing it was intended to do, it does not do. According to mine,
the obvious intent of the rule succeeds. It does what it was intended to
do. I conclude that my interpretation is clearly, overwhelmingly supported
by the intent.</blockquote>
<i>They tried a fix, and their fix was unbeknownst to them, broken.
You are basing your argument on Charity and Intent. But your Intent
argument seems to say that (1) your interpretation avoids paradoxes, and
that (2) because it does, that implies that they meant for the new rule
to take precedence over others in case of conflict when there is no reason
to think they considered conflicts let alone having an intent over what
the precedence should be.</i>
<p><i>You are taking their broken fix and giving it an interpretation that
fixes paradoxes because you know they wanted to fix paradoxes. I'm not
saying your points are unreasonable, but that sounds a lot like Charity
to me, despite your calling it Intent.</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>Huh? You admit that their intent
was to fix the paradoxes! My interpretation *obviously* accords with that
intent! Yours obviously does not!
<p>Maybe you mean something different by 'intent'. As I use this concept,
when someone intends that P, and one interpretation makes it the case that
P, and a second interpretation makes it the case that not-P, then the first
interpretation better accords with intent. According to that standard,
my interpretation is undeniably the one supported by intent.
<blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman responds: </b>I agree that their *intent*
was to fix the paradoxes. After that our opinions diverge.
You take the view that they succeeded, providing the rule is interpreted
the way you suggest. I take the view that while their intent was
to fix paradoxes, they failed to do so.</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>But hold on. You agree,
don't you, that if the rules are interpreted my way, then the paradoxes
*are* removed? So don't you agree that if the rule is interpreted in the
way I suggest, the authors *did* succeed in their intent ("to fix
the paradoxes," as you have just agreed)?</blockquote>
<i>You say that because their intent was to fix paradoxes, if you give
the rule precedence over section X, it succeeds. I contend that since
a conflict arises that they didn't consider, they failed to accomplish
what they set out to do.</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>I explained what I mean by interpreting
in accord with the authors' intention, right? If the authors intended that
P, then an interpretation according to which P is in accord with the intention,
and an interpretation according to which not-P, is not. Since we both say
that the authors of the rule intended that the rule resolve the Pandin
Paradoxes, and it is indisputable that my interpretation of the rule is
the one according to which the Pandin Paradoxes are, in fact, resolved,
it follows immediately that my interpretation is the one that accords with
the intentions.</blockquote>
<i>I am not convinced that if they did see the conflict, they would done
what you are doing... giving the new rule precedence over section X.</i>
<p><i>You seem to think that if they realized their rule was broken they'd
want to keep it. I think there are better solutions and if they had
realized it was broken they'd have looked for another one. I don't
believe any rule can be developed that will not conflict with existing
rules, but I do think that rules can be developed that have outcomes which
are more acceptable. I am speaking for myself only here, but the
idea of a destroyed unit providing valid support is just too contrary to
my view of how the game mechanics work.</i></blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><br><i>It is much more believable that they didn't notice the secondary
effect of their new rule (a contradiction with existing rules). You
seem to be agreeing that they probably didn't notice the problem with their
rule, and in response I think you are being charitable in saying that's
what they would have meant.</i></blockquote>
Otherwise they would not be sure what rule they were introducing, nor whether
it would have the effect they were aiming for (removing the Pandin paradoxes).
<p>I agree with you (Simon) that the authors could not reasonably expect
the average gamer to know which rules were written or introduced before
which others. I figure that if they had realized that the 1982 rule conflicted
with Rule X, they would have amended Rule X so that it explicitly contains
an exception. (This would be a much more sensible thing to do than what
they actually sometimes do, which is to state the exception only in the
later rule!) Nevertheless, *we* know which rule came first, so we are in
a better position to interpret the rules than the average gamer.
<p>Notice, by the way, that the old "Convoyed attack does not protect..."
rule already conflicts *explicitly* with the original rule on Cutting Support.
This conflict is not mentioned in any of the rules, new or old. I take
it to be quite obvious that the "Convoyed attack does not protect..." rule
was supposed to take precedence over the old Cutting Support rule, even
though it 'comes later' only in the rules, and not in history. In any case,
you (Simon) are mistaken when you claim that
<blockquote><i>Secondly, in other places in the rules, if there is an exception
to a rule, it is explicitly stated (such as the section on self-standoff).</i></blockquote>
There *is* a conflict between the old Cutting Support rule and the old
"Convoyed attack does not protect..." rule, and it is not explicitly noted
in the rule book.
<p><a NAME="example"></a><b>Finally:</b>
<blockquote><i>There is another suggestion that has come up -- adding a
rule that says a fleet in beleaguered garrison has a convoy disrupted.
That results in eliminating paradoxes in all cases, and in all cases results
in the same outcome as the rule I suggested.</i></blockquote>
I don't know what rule you (Simon) suggested. But this rule about beleaguered
convoys does not seem to resolve Pandin paradoxes at all.
<br>Here is an example.
<p>England:
<br>A Hol S A Yor -> Bel
<br>F Lon S F Nth
<br>F Nth C A Yor -> Bel
<br>A Yor -> Bel

<p>Germany:
<br>F Bre -> Eng
<br>F Nwg S F Ska -> Nth
<br>F Ska -> Nth
<br>F Bel S F Bre -> Eng
<p>There are no beleaguered convoying fleets here, so this suggested rule
has no effect. But it is a Pandin Paradox. Of course, our (my and Rick's)
interpretation of the 1982 rule does eliminate the paradox.
<p>Possibly I missed some context that explains what you meant.
<p>-Jamie
<p><i><b>Simon Szykman responds: </b>The beleaguered convoys rule was suggested
by several other people as a solution to the paradox rule. You are
right that it doesn't work in the case you mentioned -- it wasn't
analysed well enough.</i>
<p><i>The problem I have with your interpretation of the 1982 rule is that
it can result in a situation where a fleet is destroyed, and yet its support
is never cut. I just don't find that palatable.</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>If this just means that you would
prefer a different way of resolving the paradoxes, I have no problem
with that at all. (I would like to see a good alternative, myself.)
<blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman responds: </b>That's exactly what I'm saying.
My idea for resolving paradoxes is the following rule:</i>
<blockquote><i>"If a situation arises in which an army's convoy order results
in a paradoxical adjudication, the turn is adjudicated as if the convoying
fleet had not been ordered to convoy but holds instead."</i></blockquote>
<i>This will eliminate paradoxes in all situations.</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>It is not a determinate
rule. It is ambiguous. What is the definition of an order "<u>resulting
in</u>" a paradoxical adjudication?</blockquote>
<i>I admit that this rule is clearly a bandied for fixing paradoxes.
It is a rule that only is active when there is a paradox, and it serves
no purpose other than to eliminate the paradox. But I like it better
because it does not result in any outcomes that go against the grain of
more typical game mechanics (meaning the valid support by a destroyed unit).</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>It doesn't go against that particular
rule, obviously, but it plainly goes against other rules!</blockquote>
<i>An article in the latest issue of The Pouch is comparing the two rules
and asking people which rule they like better, which outcome they like
better. I don't know what the latest count is, but last time I checked,
70-something percent of the people preferred the rule I suggest.
We didn't ask people why they preferred one over the other, but I think
at least some significant percentage of people were bothered by the same
support issue that I am bothered by. I don't think allowing another
rule to take precedence over section X is something people are happy with.</i>
<blockquote><b>Jamie Dreier responds: </b>I find that the large majority
of chess players don't like the *en passant* rule.
<p>I must say that I am not at all attracted to alternative rules with
clauses like "If a paradox would result, then...." They are *so* ad hoc,
and (as I think Rick pointed out) they allow for an unappealing 'action
at a distance', they allow global features of the position to affect the
convoy.

rule, they wrote the 1982 rule. I think it's a very good idea to follow
that one, until and unless some people propose some really compelling
alternative, have it discussed on r.g.d., write up a nice specific clear

<b>From Malcolm Dow (<a href="mailto:malcolm@dowcorp.freeserve.co.uk">malcolm@dowcorp.freeserve.co.uk</a>):</b>
<p>About Rule 1 of the Paradox article at the pouch.
<p>In the paradox article, you point out that the convoying fleet must
be a beleaguered garrison in order to produce the paradox. You could go
on to use this fact to further restrict the application of this rule.
<p>Something which has always bothered me about this rule, (which sounds
like Jamie Drier's interpretation of the 1982 AH rules), is that it changes
some otherwise non-paradoxical cases where a convoyed army is forbidden
to cut a support.
<p>EG: your example
<p>E: F wal -> eng ; F lon S F wal -> eng
<br>F: A bre -> eng -> lon ; F eng C bre -> lon ; A yor S bre -> lon
<p>Move the Germans
<br>G: F pic -> eng ; F bel S pic -> eng
<p>Add the Russians
<br>R: A nwy -> nth -> bel ; F nth C nwy -> bel
<p>Under 1970's rules, bel is cut, and wal dislodges eng. Not a paradox
in sight. Under your proposed rule, and various discussions of the 1982
rules that I have read on r.g.d, bel is not cut, resulting in the paradox
which requires london to be uncut and dislodged.
<p>So add a new clause: "If an army convoyed via a fleet which is a beleaguered
garrison attacks a fleet that is supporting an action in or into a body
of water that contains a convoying fleet, that support is not cut by the
convoyed army under any circumstance (but a convoying army does cut all
other supports normally)."
<p>The above clause restores the old outcome in the case with the russians,
and without the russians, preserves the paradox resolution that you were
discussing,
<p> Malcolm Dow
<p><b>From Darin McGrew (<a href="mailto:mcgrew@stanfordalumni.org">mcgrew@stanfordalumni.org</a>):</b>
<p>I have a couple comments about the paradox article. (Great article,
BTW!)
First, I prefer resolution #2 overall.
<p>However, I disagree with the perspective that this resolution produces
"an army holding for no apparent reason." It makes more sense (at
a gut level) to say that a unit doesn't move when trying to pass through
an extremely chaotic region, than to say that a dislodged/destroyed unit
can still provide uncut support.
<br>I view this anti-paradox rule as just another way convoys can be disrupted.
<p>Your analysis of F vs EG and E vs FG convinced me that the situation
is really a three-way conflict: F vs E vs G. So, from France's
perspective, it's F vs EG. (FWIW, England sees E vs FG and Germany
sees G vs EF.) In such a situation, a "nothing happens" standoff
makes a lot of sense; each force is effectively outgunned. Thus,
I prefer the resolution that allows France's convoy to fail in a new way,
rather than a resolution that allows France's attack to succeed thanks
to support from the destroyed target of the attack.
<p>Darin McGrew
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response: </b>I agree that from a "realism"
point of view, you could argue that the army does not move because it's
trying to pass through a chaotic region. When I said the army holds
for no apparent reason, I meant that from the game mechanics point of view.
There is nothing at all in the current rules of the game that would prevent
that army from attempting to convoy, and yet we are arbitrarily adding
a new rule that forces it to stay where it is. "No apparent reason"
was a comment made in the context of the existing rules, not in the context

a physical army trying to physically be convoyed from one place to another,

<p>Now, am I missing something, or could there be a different small rule
change leading to a THIRD solution? Suppose London is dislodged with it's
support CUT (eliminating the problem of "phantom support"). That means
German F Belgium would dislodge French F English Channel, invalidating
the convoy.
<p>Why not have the convoy succeed AND have F English Channel dislodged?
<p>I imagine it as London's support is cut once a French soldier lands
on English soil taking London, enabling F English Channel to be dislodged.
This wouldn't disrupt the convoy, as it has already succeeded. So could
a new rule say to the effect that in this case and only this case, a convoy
can succeed even though the convoying fleet was dislodged? I admit this
solution has it's own strengths and flaws, and I would appreciate your
input on Resolution Three.

that's just my opinion. Your suggestion is as effective in eliminating
paradoxes as the ones discussed in the article. It just results in

The Germany Fleet successfully moves to the English Channel and the

<blockquote><b>To which Joe replied: </b>No you can't simply reduce Simon's
proposal to that.
<p>Then a non-paradoxical situation would arise and have unsatisfactory
results. i.e. What if the English Channel were convoy to Picardy
instead. Kinda stupid move but you wouldn't want to say it didn't
succeed in this case.</blockquote>
<i><b>Manus's response: </b>Actually, this is indeed what the proponents
of the rule argue. Their point is that the fleet is too busy fending off
multiple attacks to be
able to convoy an army.</i>
<blockquote><b>To which Joe replied: </b>Hmmm, I don't like that at all.
The fleet is not fending off attacks at all. The British and
Germany were fighting all around them while the France deposited the army
in Picardy with no resistance.

the petrified unit in Munich hunkering down and probably quite amazed that
it managed to survive.</i></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
This is the most reasonable adjudication that I could come up with that
is different than the two you came up with.
<p>It seems to make a gut feel sense to me that the cut from the convoyed
army should occur, that the fleet should be dislodged and the convoy does
not happen.
<p>This paradox is resolved if you assume all convoys are secondary effects
of a battle. If and only if the Convoy fleets are not dislodged will
army end up in the proper location.
<p>This seems right on a gut level to me.
<p>Germany isn't working with England or France, but France and England
are clearly opposing each other. It makes sense that Germany succeeds
because he is unopposed while England and France fail because they are
opposing each other as well as Germany.
<p>I believe the end result should be
<p><b>Germany</b>
<br>Fleet English Channel
<br>Fleet Belgium
<p><b>France</b>
<br>Army Brest
<br>Fleet English Channel (*Dislodged*)
<p><b>England</b>
<br>Fleet London
<br>Fleet Wales
<p>Joe Carl
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response: </b>Joe Bronikowski made the same
point. For my reply, click <a href="#bronikowski">here</a>.</i></blockquote>
It now occurs to me there is even a 4th outcome that could be reasonable
argued.
<p>The convoy works and the fleet is dislodged anyway.
<p>The final outcome is
<p><b>England:</b>
<br>F London (*Dislodged*)
<br>F Wales
<p><b>France</b>
<br>A London
<br>F English Channel (*Dislodged*)
<p><b>Germany</b>
<br>F English Channel
<br>F Belgium
<p>This could be argued that if simultaneous results are going to happen
then this is the most simultaneous that can be resolved.
<p>This paradox is eliminated by the following rule. If the convoyed
fleet dislodged had been supported in instead and would have succeeded,
then the convoyed army will succeed regardless of whether the fleet is
dislodged or not.
<p>P.S.
<br>I haven't thought deeply on the rules I suggest for the 2 alternate
paradox resolutions. But these were my initial thoughts, and felt
I should share them and see what comes of it.

<p>I enjoyed your article titled "Eliminating the Paradox in Diplomacy".
<p>I believe that result 2 (convoy fails) is better but for a different
reason (rule) than the one you stated. I don't like the idea that
the French fleet can complete its convoy since Germany attacked the fleet
with more force. The German fleet may not succeed in dislodging the
French fleet, because of the besieged garrison rule. But this should
not prevent the disruption of the convoy. A convoying fleet is by
its nature using its support to convoy the army. However the rules
state that only a fleet that is dislodged prevents the convoy.
<p>I would change the rule for convoying to be: "Even if not dislodged,
a fleet that is attacked by more force is not able to convoy." Therefore,
the convoy is disrupted and the French fleet remains due to the equal forces
attacking it by Germany and England.
<p>What do you think of my solution?
<p>Jeff Chizever
<p><b>From Glenn R (<a href="mailto:MyLittleCAR@aol.com">MyLittleCAR@aol.com</a>):</b>
<p>Greetings and good day to you. I don't play diplomacy much but
I think that you have the better solution to the paradox. The reason
that I think yours is better is because I don't view the army as holding
but as not being able to succeed. Think about a real life example:
Two fleets enter a body of water (fleet being more than one ship), each
supported by another fleet. Now we have three fleets in said body
of water with two fleets gaining support from another. Now the fleet
that is convoying has no unit supporting it to stay, however since it is
the native fleet it can avoid the other two fleets, but cannot make it
through the two fleets. Thereby not allowing the convoyed army to
be able to land. The army on the land that is supporting the convoying
army cannot offer any support to the naval unit to help it navigate.
Now the two fleets that were moving into the sea can't both stay so they
leave and the native fleet gets to stay. I apologize if this is confusing,
I'm not real good at writing what-ifs. But it I think is more true
to real life and to your physics example. (only one body can occupy
one space at one time, or something like that).

crazy to think like this.

<p>Simon, Manus --
<p>Having just read your articles and arguments for each of your proposed
paradox-solutions, I just wished to tell you that I liked both rules, but
that I preferred the second one (the Army Holds one, Simon's) for a reason
entirely different from the ones argued.
<p>It's not a good reason, but it is a reason. I think Diplomacy
moves should have some resemblance to real life. In real life, despite
the beleaguered garrison rule, a Fleet which had been attacked from multiple
directions by multiple forces, even though it was not destroyed, would
not have time or resources to successfully convoy an Army. Therefore,
I like Simon's rule not so much because of the arguments he makes for it,
but rather because it has a more "real life" feel to it. The result
is the same either way, but I think the rule is better not because it forces
the Army to H instead of move, but because it means that the Fleet, though
technically not Dislodged, was under sufficient duress to make it unable
to carry out the Convoy.
<p>Just something else to think about!
<blockquote><b><i>Simon's response (To Jeff, Glenn and Brian): </i></b><i>Your

In their case, they proposed that as an alternative rule. That actually
works well in the situation Manus and I used as an example in the paradox
article. However, there are some situations where you have a paradox
but you have no fleets in beleaguered garrison. The rule proposed
by others breaks down in that case. Similarly, though you didn't
suggest it as a rule, the justification you make won't quite work to justify
my rule in paradoxical situations that don't involve beleaguered garrison.
I believe my rule will still work in those cases, but your justification
for my rule may not correspond to the situation the way it does in the example

<p>Hey Manus,
<br>Just read your article (and Simon's) about the convoy paradox. I think
there is a third possible arbitration of that solution ... here it is:
<br>The French convoy from Bre is broken because the French fleet in ENG
is dislodged. It doesn't matter that the German and English fleet bounce,
the ante for ENG that turn is 2 units, and the French fleet has no support,
so it cannot keep ENG. Do you see what I am trying to say?

<p>I'm not an expert at the rules and have only just begun internet play

me a clearer view. It seems to me that the intuitive result is neither
option 1 or 2 as described. I would think that where 2 powers standoff
against a third and each could clearly have beaten the third (as here in
the channel) that not only should the convoy fail, but also the convoying
fleet should be dislodged (in this case leaving the Channel unoccupied.)
My reasoning is first, that the convoy must occur before the attack, and
secondly, that it makes little sense to allow the incumbent to remain after
being overwhelmed twice from 2 different directions. What the rules
would like implementing this solution, I have not worked out, but they
may offer fewer problems and/or objections than those encountered by you
first 2 options.

<b>From Eric Hunter</b> <b>(<a href="mailto:Elladan915@aol.com">Elladan915@aol.com</a>):</b>
<p>Manus and Simon,
<p>Thank you for the convoy paradox article, it was an interesting read.
I voted in favour of the second resolution, but I would phrase the exception
rule somewhat differently. Since a supported attack on a convoying
fleet would result in the convoy failing, due to the convoying Fleet being
dislodged, and being unable dock to allow the Army to embark, I would argue
that Rule XII.3 DISRUPTING A CONVOY (AH '82) should be revised to read:
"If a Fleet ordered to Convoy is dislodged during the move, OR IS SUBJECT
TO MORE THAN ONE SUPPORTED ATTACK, BUT NOT DISLODGED DUE TO THE BELEAGUERED
GARRISON RULE, the army to be convoyed remains in its original province,
and has no effect on the province to which it was ordered."
<p>This would resolve the same way as Simon's rule in the paradox situation,
but would actually result in more failed convoys, since eliminating EF
Wales, but adding IF Iri S IF MAO -> Eng, would also cause the French attack
on London to fail. This seems to eliminate the paradox, and produce
a consistent rule set, though. Of course, I could easily be overlooking
something here.
<p>Respectfully Submitted,
<br>For Your Consideration,
<p>Eric Hunter.
<blockquote><b><i>Manus' responses:</i></b>
Wow. Yours is the fourth (I think)

in other convoys failing that do not fail under the current rules, in situations

can also be seen as a positive point that this rule is always in effect,

<p><i>Of course, what the beleaguered garrison rule does suffer from, which
both the other rules suffered from, is a direct contradiction with the
current rules. Specifically, the rule in Section XXI.3 that states
"An attack on a convoying fleet which does not dislodge it does not affect
the convoy." So one still has to accept a rule that contradicts the
existing rules. It'll again be a matter of what people find most
palatable, or least unpalatable. From the elegance point of view,
I actually find this rule more appealing than mine. But I still don't
know how I feel about a general rule that essentially says a convoy is

only a dislodged fleet causes a disrupted convoy. I'll have to think

<b>From Tim Yocum (<a href="mailto:darkwolf@communitygate.net">darkwolf@communitygate.net</a>):</b>
<p>Here is an idea that crossed my mind when I saw your discussion on paradox
resolution: It is based on the definition of support and cutting of support.
<p>Why is support cut when a supporting unit is attacked by an outside
unit?
<p>Besides providing a darned nice way of creatively reducing support for
an area you want at the moment, and thus enhancing game play, I believe
I remember correctly that it is analogous to the fact that a unit is too
busy defending itself from said outside attack to support some OTHER unit.
<p>Well, think about the convoy. It is under the same sort of duress
when it is dislodged. Thus its convoy is cut. That is easy
to see. And the rules have decided that a single attack that does
not dislodge is not enough duress to successfully stop a convoy.
Makes sense. Convoys tend to be armed convoys, and thus some ships
are used to transport and others to defend. Easy enough.
<p>But in this case, the paradox comes from the inclusion of the Beleaguered
Garrison rule. France is standing with only 1 fleet there, and had
England or Germany attacked alone, that fleet would have been dislodged
and the army never convoyed (tho some might question due to Pandin's, if
England had attacked alone, did the French army make it across to cut the
support? :) But that is not this case).
<p>In this case you have England and Germany offsetting each other, and
thus the Beleaguered Garrison rule kicks in and says France's fleet is
saved. Since the Beleaguered Garrison rule is in fact a sort of "special
case exception", then in fact, modifying IT, instead of the basic fundamentals
might not be a bad option. Thus in this case I would modify the Beleaguered
Garrison rule to include the following:
<p>"If the unit being beleaguered is a fleet convoying an army the fleet
is NOT dislodged, as per the B.G. rule, but the convoy fails." This
can be analogous to the convoy being overwhelmed and having just enough
troops to keep control of the waters, but not enough to actually move units
across it.
<p>What say ye both? Do I have a suitable option 3? :)
<p>I look forward to your responses :)

<p>Simon
<p>I am not personally happy with the idea of a beleaguered fleet being
able to convoy at all. I understand that a beleaguered garrison may
be able to hunker down (batten down) and hold its ground if only because
the forces arrayed against it are expending some effort fighting each other
for local superiority. Manus' rule implies that a fleet can embark
an army, carry it under a crossfire to a defended coast, and deposit it
there safely. Your solution -- either the army never is able to embark
because of the enemy pressure, or the fleet is "bottled up" close to the
home coast -- makes a lot more sense to me than Manus' does. Perhaps
this could take place if the convoy faced only pressure from one fleet
of each power. But for the paradox to occur, at least four fleets
would have to be fighting for that SLOC. That seems a bit much --
using Manus' own criteria of "gut feel."

<p><i>It would seem unreasonable for F LON not to be dislodged in the first
case (without Eng F IRI) but to be dislodged in the second (where England
has an extra unit in the situation), so that leaves 5 resolutions.</i></blockquote>
<p><br>I'm not exactly sure how you are "counting" resolutions. As
I see it, there are four possible outcomes. Either the army gets
to Lon, or it remains in Bre. Either F Eng is dislodged or it is
not. So the possibilities are: (1) Army stays in Bre, F Eng
is not dislodged, (2) Army stays in Bre, F Eng is dislodged, (3) Army reaches
Lon, F Eng is not dislodged, and (4) Army reaches Lon, F Eng is dislodged.
<p>But aside from that, let's look at rule 1 and rule 2 proposed by Manus
and I. With my rule, there is no problem with adjudicating the above
situation. The army in Bre stays where it is, therefore it never
hits Lon, therefore Wales attacks Eng with strength three (against German
attack of strength 2) dislodging Eng. No problem... no bizarre results,
no paradox. With Manus' rule there is also no problem. The
army trying to reach Lon cannot cut Lon's support, therefore Wal is attacking
Eng with strength three no matter what, the attack succeeds, Eng is dislodged
and the convoy fails. Both rules succeed in eliminating the paradox
and in this case both leave the army in Bre. That is option
2 in the above list of four options.
<p>I don't have any problem with that outcome. If you think a different
outcome makes sense, the trick would be to come up with a rule that gives
you the outcome you want and also is a successful paradox eliminating rule
that works in other situations such as the one presented in the article
Manus and I wrote as well as other classical paradoxical situations. Ideally,
that rule would be simple and concise, and any of the inevitable contradictions
with the current rules will be minor enough so as to be
<br>acceptable.
<p>You seem to be posing a question, but I'm not sure that you are expressing
any dissatisfaction with the current outcome. Personally, I think
that a rule that results in option 4 (allowing the convoy by a dislodged
fleet) wouldn't make sense. We've already got two paradox eliminating
rules that result in outcome 1. If you that outcome 2 or 3 in the
list of 4 makes more sense, and you can come up with a paradox eliminating
rule that produces that outcome, then we can it up for comparison in this
situation and others and see what seems best. I say "seems best"
because as I said in the Zine article, any rule you introduce to eliminate
paradoxes will contradict the current rules, so there is no "right" answer...
it's just a matter of deciding which produces the most appealing outcomes
in a given set of situations. And of course, there will never be
100% agreement, so the best you can hope for is that some kind of consensus
emerges.
<blockquote><i>For consideration, also look at the same situation where
France has another unit:</i>
<p><i>French F MAO S F ENG</i>
<p><i>Does your opinion change?</i></blockquote>
This doesn't really change the situation. As before, with either
rules 1 or 2 Eng is being attacked by England with strength 3, the attack
succeeds, Eng is dislodged, the army stays in Bre. The rules work...
the question is whether you think some other outcome is more right than
this one, and if so, whether you can come up with a simple paradox eliminating
rule that results in that outcome.

<p><b>From Charles-Antoine Allain (<a href="mailto:caallain@arobas.net">caallain@arobas.net</a>):</b>
<p>Hello,
<p>I read the paradox article with great interest. My gut reaction was
to vote for solution no. 2, but I grew dissatisfied with this choice, especially
that I did not find that the case made in the explanation was very good
-- as the author himself seems to acknowledge. Despite the immense respect
that both authors inspire me, I will dissent and offer a third solution,
which I think follows the spirit of the rule more closely that the 2 other
solutions.
<p>If I were to rule on that, I would let Germany enter the English Channel,
disrupting the convoy. And before I explain why, I would like to comment
on both arguments presented.
<p>I believe many Diplomacy rules can be seen as solving a paradox or problem.
And they have been written with the spirit of the other rules in mind.
For instance, rule no. XII.5. (2nd edition), upon which Mr. Hand draws
extensively for his argument, is an extension in spirit of Chapter X. It
only states that a convoying army, for the purposes of cutting a support,
must be viewed as attacking from the space into which the convoy is located.
This can easily be understood intuitively, since otherwise the supports
are always cut by an attack from a space adjacent to them.
<p>But on the contrary, I would argue, not unlike Mr. Szykman, that the
proposed change, an extension of XII.5., goes directly against the spirit
of Chapter X regarding dislodged units. Since I think that, all things
being equal, Chapter X is more important than article XII.5., I think this
is not admissible, or that at least it considerably weakens his argument.
<p>I am not more sympathetic with the Mr. Hand's unit counting approach.
First, I have to point out that convoying units should not be counted for
this purpose, since they add nothing to the force of the attack. Should
France be convoying its army all the way from Tuscany with 4 fleets, it
would not make his position any stronger. In fact, article XII.5. itself
is a good example of this. But anyhow, Diplomacy is full of examples where
a player with fewer units is able to standoff a player with more units
-- one of the signs of a good player indeed, or at least of a good position.
I argue that this kind of point should not be used to settle this matter;
I do not find anywhere else in the rules a trace of such a justification
having ever been used.
<p>As I said earlier, I do not think that the second proposal's case is
much better, although I did vote for it. First, I do not like the way the
new rule is phrased : "a paradoxical adjudication" is a very vague phrase.
All of the other Diplomacy rules are worded quite precisely, indeed that
is why none of the two solutions can fully satisfy them. Were they couched
in such a language that could lead to interpretation, one would get rid
of paradoxes, as it would probably be the case that any situation would
be covered by one or more rules, but it would greatly multiply contradictions
between the rules. Hence, we might very well find that the proposed new
rule would not be satisfactory in another situation.
<p>And, as the author points out, there is no example anywhere in the rules
of an action being annulled because it could create a weird situation.
It is not France's fault that things happened the way they did, and I feel
it is both risky and unnecessary to create a whole new game principle that
would negate him the expected benefits of its actions. In fact, it is possible
to do just that relying on existing principles of the game, as I will show
in a moment.
<p>As I said earlier, my proposal would be to rule that Germany should
enter the English Channel, thus disrupting the convoy. I could extrapolate
on example 10 of chapter X to argue that the support is cut by the planned
attack even though the convoy is itself disrupted to justify myself. However,
I feel that this would introduce a additional element of temporality and
conditionality in the game, and I find that I would not have a very good
case.
<p>But there is another very important principle in the game that amply
justifies my proposition, and it is contained in rule IX.3. Indeed, one
could easily argue that the London support is but an elaborate form of
self dislodgement. The situation is presented quite obviously in propositions
1 and 2 : either the London fleet's actions causes it to self dislodge,
or we need to create a new game principle to resolve the matter.
<p>Since creating new game principles should be avoided when possible,
and because self dislodgement is explicitly prohibited, I find that the
London support is void in and of itself. The English Channel fleet is not
a beleaguered garrison, since the German forces outnumber the English forces.
The German fleet moves and the convoy is disrupted.
<p>One could argue that the position of proposition number 2 could still
be another outcome of this proposition on the basis that the London support
could "still be valid for other purposes". I personally think that you allowing
the fleet to remain means that the London unit is self dislodging (c.f.
article XII.3.) and that there is only one purpose here which is to prevent
that. However, I would be very open to hear what people have to say on
this.
<p>In fact, I would be delighted if you found my proposal interesting enough
that you would take the time to answer me. I enjoyed thinking about this
problem and I hope you enjoyed my thoughts too. Please excuse my lousy
writing, English is not my first language.

<p><b>From (<a href="mailto:steinker@cs.colorado.edu">steinker@cs.colorado.edu</a>):</b>
<p>I just read the article about resolving paradoxes. Here are the points
that I found to be most significant or convincing.
<p>The support of the London fleet must not be cut. Both proposals
agree on this.
<p>The first proposal argues that it doesn't add a second exception while
the second proposal does, but I don't think that's true. Both proposals
add a single exception.
<p>proposal 1: Destroyed units can lend support in this special situation.
<p>proposal 2: Armies ordered to move with nothing preventing their movement
can be made to hold in this situation.
<p>My first gut reaction was that the French army shouldn't move, but when
I read the rationale for the rules I changed my mind. I think I would have
liked that resolution if there were something stopping the French army
other than "to avoid paradoxes."
<p>There are two reasons I like why the French army should move.
One game reason, and one realism reason.
<p>The French army attack on London should be considered as coming from
the English Channel, and so shouldn't cut support. All it needs is
a small exception that the support isn't cut even though the fleet is destroyed.
<p>I don't mind a destroyed fleet lending support in this situation because
of a realism reason. The London fleet is not being distracted by
some other battle, it is being destroyed by fighting in the same battle
where it is lending support.
<p>The Wales and Belgian fleets sail out into the English Channel and the
London and North Sea fleets stay nearby to help. The French fleet
picks up the French army and starts sailing for London. Somewhere
in the middle they all meet. They are three way adversaries and everyone
is firing at everyone else so the French fleet doesn't get run off.
The London fleet fights the French fleet as it sails up to the coast and
drops of ground troops.
<p>As for realism I see this as a single battle off the London coast.
The French have enough armies to drive English ships away from the ports,
but those ships still get plenty of chance to fire at other ships in the
English Channel before having nowhere to run and being destroyed.
<p><b>From (<a href="mailto:alkaline13@yahoo.ca">alkaline13@yahoo.ca</a>):</b>
<p>Once again, the Pouch is a valued part of my year. Too bad it
only comes along only five times...
<p>In regards to the article by Manus Hand and Simon Szykman entitled "Eliminating
the Paradox", perhaps a simpler, common sense approach is needed to solve
the paradox. I agree with proposal 2 (French A Brest holds).
We too often forget that Diplomacy is a war game based (loosely) on historical
events. If the events described in any given game were to have actually
happened at some point (such as during WWI), would the French convoy actually
be able to slip through the Channel to English soil, what with the battles
going on between English, French and German navies in that area?
I would imagine that there would simply be too much conflict in the area
to allow the French convoy to pass. Therefore, I feel the convoy
should fail. But that's only my perspective.
<p>keep up the good work!
<p><b>From Joe Bronikowski (<a href="mailto:jbronikowski@software.rockwell.com">jbronikowski@software.rockwell.com</a>):</b>
<p>I disagree with both your proposed resolutions, and therefore with your
subsequent paradox eliminating rules. I would say that France's army
Brest does cut London's support of Wales - English Channel (because Wales
is not attacking the army), even if the army doesn't successfully attain
London. Therefore England fails to bounce the German supported attack,
so German Fleet English Channel is the proper end result.
<p>I think I can boil this down to a single, simple rule (that admittedly
may effect non-paradoxical situations too):
<blockquote><i>A convoyed army DOES cut a support order for a unit in it's
destination province, even if the convoy is foiled by dislodging one of
the convoying fleets.</i></blockquote>
All other results should follow from this. The only case where this
is not true is when the supporting unit is supporting an attack on the
ARMY's source province, because that basic Dip rule takes over (a unit
can't cut support on an attack of it's own province).
<p>What I don't know is how the Dip rules or the judge implementation handle
disrupted convoys in non paradox situations. I have a feeling that
if the convoy doesn't go through, it can't cut a support. But the
general rule that a dislodged unit can still cut support ("before" it's
dislodged) seems to align with my premise that a disrupted convoy can still
cut support.
<p>Joe Bronikowski
<blockquote><i><b>Manus's response: </b>So you are saying whether or not
a convoy fleet is disrupted, the moves should assume the convoy to succeed
for the purposes of cutting support of any unit at the destination?</i>
<p><i>I will have to think about this one....</i>
</blockquote>
Yes. Actually I think the addition of the German fleets helped crystallize
my thinking on the matter. While England and France are engaged in
a 1 1/2 vs 1 1/2 paradox, Germany's two units should win the day :-)
<p>Joe B
<blockquote><a NAME="bronikowski"></a><i><b>Simon's response: </b>I'd
be interested to get comments from other people to see if this rule holds
up under other paradoxical situations. I have a nagging feeling that
this rule will solve the paradox in the situation Manus and I discussed,
but that it will lead to a new paradox that doesn't exist with the current
rules, in a different situation. I haven't come up with an example
of a paradoxical situation under this new rule, but I just have a feeling
that such a situation exists. I'll think about it some more.</i>
<p><i>Assuming it does hold up, the problem I have with it is how to justify
the rule at all. Either the army reaches its destination, or it doesn't.
Quite clearly, the convoyed army never reaches Lon. One reason it
doesn't is that its convoy was disrupted. The second reason it doesn't
is that if it had, it would successfully take Lon since it had support
for the attack. So given that the army never reaches Lon, on what
basis do you argue that the convoy managed to cut London's support?</i>
<p><i>It's quite clear that this rule is not quite reconcilable with the
current rules without some kind of contradiction, but then again, neither
were my rule and Manus' rule. It again comes down to the point I
made in my portion of the paradox article. Which contradiction are
you most willing to live with to make the problem go away.</i>
<p><i>Possibly a more significant problem is the fact you already acknowledged
above--that this rule will affect other situations in the game. I
think that a general rule which allows armies whose convoys were disrupted
to still successfully cut support at the destination end would certainly
change the resolution of orders in numerous types of circumstances.
The true effect of this rule would be difficult to judge ahead of time.
At the very least, it would change the tactics surrounding situations involving
convoys. Whether such a rule would affect the general playability
of the game would remain to be seen.</i>

<blockquote><b>To which Joe replied: </b>Well, I'm not the "deepest" thinker
when it comes to designing games. It just seems to me that a convoyed
army ought to have the same strength as if the fleet itself were attacking.

convoyed army do the same? I'll leave further investigation in your
hands....</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><br><b>From (<a href="mailto:cgv@penn.com">cgv@penn.com</a>):</b>
<p>Excellent article, and you both have arrived at acceptable and workable
resolutions. I would not object to either one if I were a player
involved in the paradox and you adjudicated it in the manners you described.
<p>Personally, I would tend to fall back on the "realism" idea when resolving
this paradox. The fact of the matter is that an amphibious operation
is one of the most complex tasks that a military force can undertake.
It seems to me that, given this complexity, it should be more easily disrupted
than a simple cross border attack. Therefore, in the paradox discussed,
I would give the benefit of the doubt to the London defenders, under the
guise that the sudden arrival of FOUR hostile fleets would certainly have
<br>interrupted any real life amphibious operation.
<p><b>From Marc L&eacute;otard (<a href="mailto:marc.leotard@fucam.ac.be">marc.leotard@fucam.ac.be</a>):</b>
<p>Actually, the outcome which I prefer is neither of the two you propose.
<p>I consider the French (Yor-Lon) support to be effectively "tying" the
activity of English F Lon, so as to prevent its effective support to F
Wal.
<br>Hence, the English try into the Channel is too weak to prevent the
German to succeed.
<p>So, I consider the German fleet to have succeeded into Channel! French
fleet dislodged, situation in England unchanged.
<blockquote><i><b>Manus's response: </b>So you are saying that the Yor
support should be considered like an attack, such that it cuts the London
support? How would you state this as a rule?</i></blockquote>
I wouldn't say "support is like an attack" in all cases. I would just say
that, *when the rules are not enough* (that is, they cancel each other
out and lead to paradox), then the side with a little more force should
be given credit for it.
<p>Surely, a supporting army does a little of fighting. Paradoxes are not
due to convoys, they are due to the mix of convoys, supports and fleet
dislodgement. I have once written an article (in French, for postal zine
Mach die Spuhl!) where I analysed the essence of paradox and different
ways to come out of it. Basically, the culprit is the possibility of negating
an order, and the vicious circle it creates: Attack negates Support, Support
(by allowing Dislodgement) negates Convoy (and therefore the initial
<br>attack). So you have to bend one of those rules a little. The French
version of Diplomacy (published by Descartes) chose one way out (remove
simultaneity). The 1992 AH rules chose another (convoyed attack does not
cut). I discussed another yet (no dislodgement necessary to cut convoy).
I ended up thinking AH92 to be the best, though some gaps remained.
<p>Now, your paradox also exists when there is no Yorkshire support. AH92
says "support not cut". I agree, my humble opinion is in favour of Standoff:
Fleet Channel remains in place because of an equality of forces. Descartes
or my own try would yield no definitive solution.
<p>The situation you propose is more complex, because: Att negates Sup,
Sup negates Disl, Disl negates Conv (i.e. Att). AH92 does not solve it,
because it doesn't mention supported convoyed attack. Just a matter of
making it explicit: either it also fails to cut the support, or it works.
I feel, in the general standoff created, that A Yor is left to add a tiny
supplement of weight, that effectively crumbles the whole position.
<p>Here, it actually leads France to dig his own grave, but other examples
exist, without paradox, to the same effect. Blame the French player, not
the ruleset.
<p>NOW! How to write it as a rule? I dunno. Though I think it should be
easier to write in code than put in a rules manual...
<p>Marc L&eacute;otard
<p><b>From Eric Amtmann (<a href="mailto:ewa@mindspring.com">ewa@mindspring.com</a>):</b>
<p>Dear Manus and Simon:
<p>You've hidden the best argument in a postscript at the end!
<p>I think Simon is close to a good solution with his "Paradox Resolution
Proposal 2." However, as you state, both Proposals 1 and 2 do result
in a contradiction to the existing rules that would have to be accepted
in the event of a paradoxical scenario occurring. However, I do think
there is an alternative proposal which prevents the paradox, but does not
contradict the existing rules. Even before reading Simon's "Postscript"
and thoughts about "time travel" I had started to think about what constitutes
a "valid order." A related way to phrase it is to say an order is
"void."
<p>The Diplomacy rules are full of descriptions about what types of moves
are allowed for the two types of units. By all accounts in my mind,
and by a wide margin, adding one more of these rules is the "least distasteful"
solution to eliminating paradoxes. In fact, it is not distasteful
*at all* because it does not raise any "special exceptions"
<br>or "contradictions to existing rules."
<p>My proposal is related to Simon's postscript. However, I think
if you discard the time travel stuff, a very legitimate argument can be
made for this sort of new rule, an argument that can go far beyond simply
saying, "paradoxes can't occur."
<p><b>Proposal 3:</b>
<blockquote><i>"Armies may move by convoy unless the move creates an adjudication
scenario with multiple conclusions. Such a convoy order is invalid,
and rendered void."</i></blockquote>
From there, the existing rules take over on how to adjudicate. This
new logic corresponds with the existing rules in two ways:
<p><b>Example 1:</b>
<br>Army Munich -> Switzerland
<p>In FTF, this order would be invalid, but perfectly acceptable to write
down. Army Munich would *not actually move* to Switzerland, but as
it attempts to move, would not be able to receive support to hold.
In contrast to Simon's Proposal 2, there is no need to retract the *move*
order and replace it with a *hold* order. Replacing an order in this
manner could result in an army receiving support to hold when in fact it
attempted to move. It is simply invalid, and is processed as such.
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's comment: </b>As stated in the first set of replies
to the article, Simon acknowledges that the wording for his rule has this
problem with it, and has proposed a <a href="#reworded">reworded rule</a>
which eliminates this problem.</i></blockquote>
In PBEM, the situation is somewhat different with how the judge handles
"invalid" orders. With Manus' DPJudge, the order would simply be
rendered invalid at the time of adjudication as with all other invalid
orders. With the Ken Lowe judge, this "invalid paradoxical convoy"
order would also be rendered invalid at the time of adjudication. Obviously,
since the moves of other players need to be known before the order becomes
invalid, the order could not be refused by the judge at the time of submittal.
<p>Which brings me to Example 2. Why is it logical and consistent
with the existing rules to render a convoy order invalid or void only *after*
all other orders are known?
<p><b>Example 2:</b>
<br>Army Munich -> Ruhr
<br>Army Burgundy SUPPORT Army Munich HOLD
<p>In this example it's obvious that the support order for Army Burgundy
is void. But the key point is that the order is only rendered void
*after* the order for Army Munich is known. Voila! There is
precedent in the existing Diplomacy rules for determining the validity
of an order in consideration of the complete set of orders for all units
on the board.
<p><b>Counterpoint:</b>
<p>Perhaps the biggest argument against this rule questions the justification
of rendering the convoy order invalid. As Simon states in his postscript,
does the proposed rule simply say, "Well you can't order that, because,
well you can't, because it creates a paradox." ? It could be argued
that in the supporting examples I used above, the rules
<br>in question have logical explanations for their justification.
<p>Example 1 has its justification in the fact that in the early 1900's
Switzerland was for all practical purposes physically impassable for large
scale military operations. Therefore, orders to move armies into
Switzerland are invalid.
<p>Example 2 has its justification in the fact that moving armies can't
receive support to hold. This in turn is justified by the logic that
if a unit is attacking somewhere else, it shouldn't be allowed to defend
itself with more than it's own defensive strength - it shouldn't get help
it wasn't prepared for.
<p>At their core, the Diplomacy rules are founded on a framework of logic
that is consistent, and sensible. Once you've got the general hang
of how the rules work, you've got a fair chance at figuring out a rule
you may not be familiar with just based on the system of logic established
elsewhere in the rules. In short, the rules are beautifully simple
because they are predictable and they *make sense*.
<p>That is my response to those who would argue ruling paradoxical convoys
to be invalid is arbitrary. Quite simply, paradoxical convoys don't
*make sense.* That alone is sufficient reason to invalidate them
based on the system of logic constructed through the entirety of the Diplomacy
rules. I submit that rendering paradoxical scenarios as simply disallowed
is quite in character with the overall logic structure of the Diplomacy
rules.
<p><b>Conclusion:</b>
<p>With this new rule, a convoy order may be rendered void during adjudication
when the orders for all units on the board are known. If the convoy
order is rendered void, the army which receives the "invalid paradoxical
convoy" order attempts to move, cannot receive support to hold, but never
actually moves to the destination province, and therefore does not cut
support of any kind in the destination province.
<p>I think this proposed new rule fits into the logic of the existing rules,
does not contradict any existing rules, does not create any new exceptions,
does not change the submitted order for any unit, and works in all cases.
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response: </b>I think your suggestion of making
the army's order void is effectively the same as my revised rule.
Even though it's worded quite differently, it produces the same outcomes
in the same situations. In other words, we each said what we meant
differently, but we both advocate the same
result in the given paradoxical situation.</i>
<p><i>Possibly the one advantage of your rule over mine is that it does
not change the order for any unit. I like that aspect of it as far
as wording goes. The one potential drawback to the rule is
the possible problems in hand-adjudicated games in determining how to treat
a unit that has a voided order. The Diplomacy rules indicate that
a unit that receives an illegal order stands in place. It is
not clear whether that means it holds (so that it can receive support)
or whether that just means it doesn't move but if it attempted to move
it can't receive support. I think the more accepted ruling is that
a unit ordered to move can't receive support even if the order is void
or illegal, but the rules themselves are not 100% unambiguous.</i>
<p><i>As written, your rule runs the risk of being interpreted by a GM
as a unit that stands (as per the rules) and interpreting that to mean
it can receive support even though the more common interpretation is that
it can't receive support. I think your rule should make it clear
that the order is void but that the moving army cannot receive support
since it is attempting to move. Then it works out fine.</i>
<p><i>- Simon</i></blockquote>
<b>From Steve Araps (<a href="mailto:saraps@erols.com">saraps@erols.com</a>):</b>
<br>I just read your joint article from the DP Zine on Resolving paradoxes.
I prefer Rule 2 to Rule 1, but my thinking on all this is a little bit
different.
<p>First of all, I absolutely hate the AH rule to limit paradoxes, you
know the one (XII.5):
<p>"If a convoyed army attacks a fleet which is supporting an action in
a body of water, and that body of water contains a convoying fleet, that
support is not cut."
<p>This of course is in conflict with the support cutting philosophy evident
throughout the rest of the game. I am actually a little surprised that
the Rule 1 argument didn't state that there are no paradoxes with the AH
rules. The above XII.5 *handles* Pandin's paradox. In your example, a convoyed
army (bre) attacks a fleet (lon) which is supporting an action in a body
of water (eng). Since the fleet in eng is a convoying fleet, the support
is not cut per the rules. Convoy succeeds, lon is dislodged/destroyed yet
its support is uncut. Ugly, but it is a solution AH came up with.
<p>Unfortunately, this paradox medicine is also applied indiscriminately
to non paradox situations as well, creating nutty results that never were
controversial in the first place. <a href="http://devel.igo.org/DipPouch/Zine/W1995A/Tactics/section3.htm">Matt
Self's article</a> has a good example of this. So I hate the AH rule and
I hate Rule 1 as well because all this one does is clarify that the AH
treatment applies even when the supporting fleet is dislodged/destroyed.
Add to this the idea that a certain attack cuts support depending on the
type of support. That kind of thinking is foreign to my concept of the
game and its movement. In my view a support is a support, there are not
different types, some immune to being cut, others not.
<p>Imagine the GM's dilemma for this adjudication...
<p>Italy: wed c Tunisia
<br>Italy: ties s wed
<br>Italy: pie s tussle
<p>France: spa(sc) s Leo
<br>France: Leo c anything anywhere (let's say marts, but mar is empty)
<p>According to the rules, everything bounces though most people would
be more conceptually satisfied if the spa support was cut and Leo dislodged.
I know I would be. Is this example contrived? Of course, but it could happen
and here's the why. Italy is worried that wed could get dislodged (assume
F fleet mao in the scenario for this threat), so to avoid it he delivers
the support cut with a convoy. France sees the danger of the convoyed support
cut and the futility of trying to defend Leo or attack wed conventionally.
So he sets up the quasi-uncuttable support by issuing a fictitious convoy
order for Leo. Pretty stupid, huh?
<p>Some may question whether wed should have the privilege of delivering
a support cut while allowing itself to be protected by a support in place.
I don't. It needs two units to accomplish this task (itself and tun). Also,
like it or not, this *is* the game treatment. If spa were ordering spa
s mar, there is no question the support is cut. Why the special treatment
for the support of Leo? The answer is simple: to try to find a way around
convoy paradoxes. Period. This strikes me as a bad reason, since there
are no paradoxes here. All this just begs for a more elegant solution.
In the meanwhile, the GM will need to rule on this Italy/France adjudication
which is likely to be disputed regardless of his decision.
<p>So getting back to the article, I liked Rule 2 better, although it is
flawed in its wording. We certainly would not want the orders to be reinterpreted
as "bre hold." What if there was French fleet pic s bre (normally a void
order!). What if there were also more English fleets: gas s Maori. Now
under the normal rules, units ordered to move cannot be supported in place.
Bre was ordered to move. But the treatment of Rule 2 could be interpreted
so that bre could receive the pic support to hold in place, even though
it was ordered to move. I don't like this too much.
<p>A better wording of Rule 2 would be something like: "If a situation
arises in which an army's convoy order results in a paradoxical adjudication,
all moves by all units involved in the paradox fail." I like this much
better.
<p>Now the main reason I like this (Rule 2a?) best is that it only applies
to paradoxes and does not infect other normal elements of the game mechanics.
For this reason, I would love to see something like Rule 2a replace A's
Rule XII.5. But I also like Rule 2a because the result is easier to conceptualize,
as opposed to uncut support from dislodged fleets. I would even apply a
rationalization that I can readily accept, which neither of the two arguments
really approached. Here it is, in not so brief form:
<p>Diplomacy is a game of simultaneous movements and actions. Most people
accept this at the surface and in most cases that is all that is necessary.
But when paradoxes occur, a lack of full appreciation for simultaneous
actions causes conceptual misunderstandings. In other words, even though
everyone knows Dip is a game of simultaneous movement, I think many of
them mistakenly interpret that to mean 'instantaneous.' That is, even though
a campaign takes a whole 'season' to unravel, people mentally think of
the events happening in no time at all... requiring special rules to allow
them to draw a conclusion they are not able to conceptually understand.
So let's think about what simultaneous can really mean. How about the concurrent
transfer of influence by all elements *over* a period of time. Kind of
like when you push down on a waterbed in one spot, you will see it rise
immediately everywhere else. There's no delay. It happens all at once.
*But* it only rises at the speed in which you push. It does not jump up
to the height it expects it should be when you are done pushing. It happens
over time in a direct reaction to your action.
<p>So let's apply that thinking to the example. Let's say that we picture
the bre fleet just starting to make it across the channel. Like starting
to push down on the waterbed. The effect of this push is that the lon support
must degrade a little because it is in the process now of being dislodged.
So now the strength of the wal attack on eng is getting degraded as well.
This in turn means that the eng fleet, which had begun to acquire a sense
that it was becoming safely beleaguered, now finds it is coming under pressure
from the emerging imbalance in the coincident E/G attacks. That is, G is
starting to win and the eng fleet is in the process of being dislodged.
Now we all know that a dislodged fleet cannot convoy armies, so the bre
army which previously had a sense of just barely beginning to succeed in
its mission, is now hampered and begins to draw back. Even though they
have full support from yor, their own convoy is beginning to fail to the
point that the attack on lon is insufficient due to the German distraction.
Of course, if the bre army must drawdown because of the G pressure on their
convoying eng fleet, the lon support for the wal-eng attack gets a boost.
Now all of a sudden, the tide turns in the sea battle. The G offensive
which was starting to look decisive is now being effectively stood off
by the English attack. Since a beleaguered fleet can still convoy, the
bre army can perhaps renew their assault, with the cycle repeating. And
repeating. And repeating.
<p>Fast forward now to the end of the season when there has been all this
endless probing and false starts. Where should everyone be? Answer: right
where they all started. Nobody moves. From the very beginning, a system
of equilibrium was at work and that equilibrium placed the convoyed army
at its origin in bre. The army in bre can never get to lon because the
moment it begins to make progress in that direction, it is met with an
equal force that resists it exactly. Ditto for the G fleet in bel. It had
fits and starts where it began to get the upper hand against the E attack,
but these advantages always disappeared as fast as they appeared. This
sounds like what everyone knows to be a normal bounce (e.g. sil-gal, gal
hold = bounce). For the bel/wal bounce, this is easy to understand... equal
forces at the same point preventing movement. Like pushing down on a tabletop
instead of a waterbed. Won't go anywhere. The normal conceptual hangup
is with the failure of the attack on lon. People get hung up on this because
the force resisting the movement in a paradox does not reside in the destination
province of the various involved convoys. The force is applied to the convoys
themselves, an element in the movement that does not exist in normal movement.
Maybe it could be thought of as the paradoxical bounce. Instead of a unit
in the destination province *pushing* an attack back, there is a unit acting
on the convoy to *pull* the attack back. Or getting back to the waterbed,
even though you know you have enough strength to push down all the way
to the platform, you never get to apply it because someone else is standing
there holding your hand back. The someone in this case was the German fleet
from bel. Not a normal bounce. A paradoxical bounce. You're not running
into a brick wall...there are no obstacles in your path. But you are restrained
by a tether. That German fleet. I see perfect logic as to how the German
fleet both protects the French fleet involved in the convoy while at the
same time preventing the convoy itself from occurring.
<p>This is an awful lot of words to get across a relatively simple thought.
But since the simple thought runs smack into ingrained perceptions on movement,
it is normally not even considered. In fact, most people, even with all
these words, will reject this rationalization simply because they have
a different concept of simultaneous movement that does not allow for the
type of thinking I apply.
<p>Interestingly enough, I developed some of my own conceptual thinking
of a Diplomacy move from an article Manus wrote (I forget where it is).
In it he explained the campaign concept within a move, the idea that a
move does not occur at a point in time, but takes six months to unfold
with the ultimate result being a determination of who exercises *influence*
within the province. This idea of the passage of time is what I am referring
to, not the other aspects of the article (which suggested conventional
clashes of armies and navies is an overly simplified or narrow interpretation
of actual events that could otherwise involve guerilla fighting, assassinations,
propaganda, that kind of thing). Imagine my surprise when I saw that Manus
was the advocate for Rule 1. I had expected him to hold the other view.
But let's see, Manus has just finished programming the DPjudge. I do suppose
that Rule 1 would be easier to code up than Rule 2... :-)

<p><b>From James North (<a href="mailto:jamesdnorth@yahoo.com">jamesdnorth@yahoo.com</a>):</b>
<p>I am writing this in response to your article. I must tell you up front
that I disagree with both outcomes. However, it may be that I am working
from a different rule book. The Diplomacy I use was published in 1961 by
Games Research. In your scenario you discounted the German fleet and some
subtle rules that are not obvious on first reading.
<p>The rules. There are two parts to a convoyed army. The fact of convoying
and the fact of landing in the target province. If either of these are
not successful, the entire move is voided. Lets look at the landing. It
says in my rule book that you cannot attack a province that is not adjacent
unless convoyed by an joining and adjacent fleets. When the army in YOR
supports the army BRE move to London, the army in YOR is actually attacking
LON not supporting an army convoyed by a fleet in the Channel.
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response: </b>This is not quite correct.
The army in Yor is supporting the army convoyed from Bre to Lon.
To give support, a unit does not have to be adjacent to the unit it is
supporting, it has to be adjacent to the location the attacking unit is
moving to. In this case, Yor is adjacent to Lon, which is where Bre
is moving to, so it's perfectly fine to say that Yor is supporting the
army into Lon.</i></blockquote>
I say this for two reason. First, the Army in YOR is not adjacent to the
fleet or the convoyed army in the Channel. Second, because an army cannot
support a fleet in the water because it could not otherwise move there.
Therefore the landing would be successful because you would have a two
unit attack on a one unit hold (I will come back to this).
<p>The convoy. Because the army in YOR is supporting the Army in in BRE
move to LON the fleet in LON can no longer support the fleet in Wales.
It must theoretically prepare to defend. Therefore, the Fleet in WAL and
the fleet in the Channel are a one unit stalemate, but this nullifies the
convoy so the army stays in BRE. However, because the Army in YOR is supporting
a unit to LON (even if that move is unsuccessful) the Unit in LON still
has its support cut to the fleet that wants to move from Wal to the Channel.
<blockquote><i><b>Simon's response: </b>It is incorrect to say that Yor
is actually attacking Lon. The order "A Yor S A Bre - Lon" alone
does not cut London's support for Wal. If you say that Yor is attacking
Lon, you are saying that the support is being cut. A support order
cannot cut support, only an attack can. I don't think there's anything
in the rules (even the 1961 rules) that says that a support order can cut
another unit's support.</i>
<p><i>Now if I've misunderstood you and you are saying not that the support
order is cutting support but that the unsuccessful attack is cutting support,
that's a different matter. However, therein lies the paradox. If
that's your position, you are correct as far as you went. The army
hits Lon, cuts support, England attacks Eng with 1, Germany attacks
with 2, Germany wins, dislodging the fleet. But if the fleet is
dislodged, then the convoy fails, so there's no way for the army to get
to Lon to cut support, so Lon's support is successful, so the German fleet
does not win the attack on Eng. There's the paradox, which is what
the two new rules are trying to address.</i></blockquote>
My version of the rules imply that the Unit in LON must stop its support
and prepare to defend itself and that is why its support is cut.
<p>Germany: Because French and English troops are at a one unit stalemate,
this leaves the two unit attack from Germany as the victor in this move.
<p>I am sure that you think that my theory is all washed up. And I am sure
that no one would want me to GM. However, my belief is that a troop can
only do one thing and that its first priority is to defend it territory.
Unless it is attack from the province that it is attacking it must stop
and defend itself. The only way to prevent this from happening is to cut
the attack from a different direction before it happens.
<p>Let me know what your thoughts are.
<p><b>From Tarzan (<a href="mailto:tarzan_monkeyman@bigfoot.com">tarzan_monkeyman@bigfoot.com</a>):</b>
<p>In regard to the Paradox article:
<p>I had a different take. I look at it this way. Let's simply
ignore the German units. What would happen? The English Fleet
in Lon would dislodge the fleet in Eng, and disrupt the French convoy.
<p>At this point let's "throw" the German units back into the puzzle.
As was pointed out in the article (argument #1), the German units are neither
clearly pro-England nor pro-France. Thus, IMO the effect of the German
units is merely to bounce England's Lon-Eng move. According to the
current Dip rules this would in effect "undislodge" the French convoy.
So, in effect, Germany's orders "save" the French Fleet Eng from being
dislodged. The only real question (in my mind) is do Germany's orders
also "save" the convoy? My opinion is no (see below).
<p>When faced with dilemmas like this I like to return to the fundamentals
of the actual game of Diplomacy. That is, Diplomacy is not about
units fighting one another (although many players perceive the game this
way), but instead Diplomacy is getting your "neighbour" to "permit" you
to place a unit in a strategically favourable (or unfavourable) location.
Remember Diplomacy takes place PRIOR to any war breaking out (as a matter
of fact, according to the rules, when a player reaches 18 SCs this is when
war breaks out - presumable the 18 SC power at this point feels that he
has the resources to start a war?).
<p>Returning to our paradox situation, France is trying (to England's chagrin)
to strategically place an army in Lon (via a convoy). Meanwhile,
England is trying to strategically place his fleet in Eng (and "kindly"
have the French fleet back off). Meanwhile, Germany is strategically
trying to locate his own fleet in Eng. Continuing the thought process
along these lines, it seems to me that everyone should fail. Thus,
I support rule #2, that is, all units hold.
<p>Lastly, I want to throw one other idea out there. Let's say we
took the same paradox situation and added one extra French unit in Mid
and ordered F Mid S Eng. Well, the results would be unambiguous.
Namely, France's convoy would succeed! That is, both England and
Germany would bounce in Eng (France provided his own support for Eng) and
the convoy would succeed!! Does this make sense in the context I
suggested above? Is it fair? I think the answer is "yes" to
both questions. So, if France adds this extra fleet, then clearly
the resulting adjudication would turn out the same as if rule #1 was in
place. However, without this "extra" fleet, I simply don't feel comfortable
saying that the same outcome should occur. Thus, I support the "all
hold" results from rule #2.

matter which way I voted the first time? I mean, you're obviously

<p>Nicholas,
<blockquote><i><b>Nicholas Robins wrote: </b>I read the article, and your
postscript. My interests here is in your postscript. Have you considered
the possibility of a iterative universe. For a simpler example, lets say
that the time traveller uses his sword to destroy his own sword before
he left (he then has no sword, and so cant destroy it. yada, yada, yada..)
Viola paradox. Unless we look at it in the following way:</i>
<p><i>Man A goes back in time destroys Man B's sword. Man B lives for a
while, goes back in time, and does not destroy Man A's sword. Who then
goes back in time and destroys Man B's sword. All is well. We merely must
separate these two people. By any measure they are not the "same" person.
They have different memories. They consist, at least partially of different
matter, they experience two different subjective realities.</i></blockquote>
I've read stories that are based on a premise like this. The premise
of a multiple universe branching into multiple universes with different
local realities can make the paradox go away, but my understanding is that
the possibility of concept has not yet been reconciled with the laws of
physics as we understand them. Basically, they violate conservation
of mass and conservation of energy. Where would the matter and energy
for two universes come from, when previously there was only one.
<p>Another similar solution is the possibility of multiple universes that
are not different matter as you said, but a superposition of quantum states.
Superposition would allow the two universes to exist as two different quantum
states which exist simultaneously. The problem with this solution
is that superposition of quantum states only works for unobserved systems.
As soon as an observation of the system is made, the system collapses into
one state or the other, and the convenient superposition that allowed both
states to exist goes away.
<p>(Please note that if it sounds like I don't know what I'm talking about,
it's only because I've read enough about physics to be dangerous -- I can
sort of rephrase something I've read but can't repeat the detailed argument
I'd originally read.)
