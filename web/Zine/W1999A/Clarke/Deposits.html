<p>Man alive!!! Do you guys ever write a lot of stuff to Manus! I'm sitting
here with a new appreciation for what he does... when I agreed to be the
Guest Editor for this issue of the Pouch Manus directed me to the Pouch
Mailbag and told me to FTP the file to myself and then "have a go." It
was 2.5 MB of raw text!!!! The mailbag since the last issue was positively
<b>bulging</b>
with your efforts... articles, letters, opinions, responses to articles...
<p>When I sat down to go through the Pouch deposits this morning I thought
it would be fun... eight hours later my head is starting to hurt... Manus,
you are amazing.
<p>In fact, there was sooooooo much mail regarding the "<a href="../../F1999R/Debate/paradox.html">Eliminating
the Paradox in Diplomacy</a>" article Manus and Simon wrote in the last
issue that I've decided to put all of those letters in a separate article
(still in Deposits format) <a href="paradox_response.html">elsewhere
in this issue</a>.

Your Favorite Border</h3>

<H4>From Andrew Goff:</H4>
My favourite border is different from everyone else who
sent one in: it is Tunis-Ionian. Someone mentioned Italy getting into MAO or
Marseilles as "the key," but as France or Turkey, either getting Ionian (as
France) or Tunis (as Turkey)...well... it just makes me excited in ways
I can't talk about in public, okay? A close
second would be Western Med to MAO, with various combinations of Munich,
Tyrolia, Bohemia, Galicia, and Silesia all roughly equal in third.

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<H4>From Jack Brawner (<a href=mailto:TrojanOwl@aol.com>TrojanOwl@aol.com</a>):</H4>
Hello, Paul!  I enjoyed your article very much.  It is kind of funny, though, how
"conventional wisdom" changes over the years.
<P>
Permit me to introduce myself.  My name is Jack Brawner, former
publisher
of PBM fanzine "The Flying Dutchman," former winner (and drawer and gonzo)
of
many mail games, former author of 2 S&T articles in Diplomacy World and many
others in other zines, former Dipcon regular (collecting half a dozen top 10
finishes and close to a dozen best-of-country awards), former this, former
that, etc.  LOL
<P>
I am re-entering the hobby after an 18-year absence, and am in three new
games.  I have definitely noticed form perusing articles and active
negotiations that the E-mail game of today and the snail-mail game of
yesteryear are quite different.
<P>
It was fascinating to read your "conventional wisdom" debunking.
Indeed,
very few of the wisdoms of today were widely held in the 70s.
<P>
The main reason that Edi Birsan consistently promoted the "Lepanto"
option was because most games seemed to begin with an Italian attack on
Austria or France!  Edi never attacked Turkey when <i>he</i> played Italy,
he just convinced the Austrian that he was going to!
<P>
Anglo-German alliances were much more popular than Franco-German
alliances.  The "conventional " wisdom was that France has nowhere to go but
through Germany pretty soon.   Anglo-French were probably second, often
running up against R/G/I walls, while A/T battled.
<P>
Austria-Russia frequently moved against Germany as early as Spring 1902.
Germany frequently moved vs. Russia in 1902.
It just seems like conventional wisdom mutates.....
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b> Thank you for your message! I very
much appreciate hearing from one of the older hands of the hobby. Your
comparison of conventional wisdom from another time and place is, of course,
equally fascinating for me.</i>

Variants and Game Queues</h3>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><b>From David Norman (<a href="mailto:David@ellought.demon.co.uk">David@ellought.demon.co.uk</a>):</b>
<blockquote><i><b>Manus Hand wrote: </b>Yes, I've been requested
many times to add queues for non-standard-map games. My resistance
has been that it would be too many queues and players and the page visuals
would be too overwhelmed.
<p>What I may do (no date attached here) is simply copy the standard
queue page, and make a new one for Modern, another for Aberration, etc.,
etc. Multiple pages, all with the same queue types.
<p>Another issue, though, is I don't know how many GM's would want to
sign up to be in both the standard GM queue and the Aberration GM queue
(...and the one for Modern, etc., etc.).</i></blockquote>
Rather than having a queue for every variant (given that if you include
USTR's variants, there are around 80 of them), why not just group them.
On my variants page, they are grouped into Small, Medium, Large and Huge
variants. These roughly translate to 3-5, 6-8, 9-11 and 12+ players, although
I move them around a little (e.g., Crowded is 11 players, but would still
only be medium, as it is a standard map). Each page could list the variants
which it covers.
<p>Of course, a lot of the variants on USTR are not stable or good enough
to be included, but I'm sure there are a few which are.
<p>Could you make the queues such that masters can advertise a game to
everybody on a queue, and then people sign up and remove themselves, so
that people can choose which games to take?
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's comment: </b>So, variant lovers out there

Run a Diplomacy Tournament - A guide for first time Tournament Directors</a></h3></center>
<hr>
<P>
My article in the last issue could
perhaps more
accurately be described as a guide on how to build up a hobby base
in your area from scratch, with a view to running a tournament. I wrote
this article in response to a request by Manus to share some of the lessons
with him that I'd learnt in building up the New Zealand hobby so that he
could use that to help build up the hobby in the Rocky Mountains with the
<a href="http://www.armada-dip.com/">ARMADA</a>
group he was setting up. The ARMADA is not the only group however that
has sprung up following the article. It seems that there are number of
people trying to grow hobbies in their area at the moment, so I thought
it would be a good idea to publicize their efforts, and the things they've
learnt so that people in their areas can see the work they are doing, and
so that others in other areas can be motivated to do similar things...

<h4>
From Shlomi Yaakobovich (<a href="mailto:shlomiya@yahoo.com">shlomiya@yahoo.com</a>):</h4>
I've read your article in the DP with great interest. I have to say
it came out just in time, since I have began to organize the Israeli Diplomacy
hobby just recently. I made a small attempt last year (somewhere in July)
to find Israeli players, but it was not so serious, and I had less time
and other resources to make it work. I have the needed time, resources
and energy to do it now.
<p>I am going through the judge "get whois" results (I did that last year
too), and I'm also exploring other areas. I seriously doubt there's a postal
Diplomacy
hobby in Israel. I have created a virtual community (that also offers
the services of a mailing list) to gather all the players. It's going pretty
well, we have 26 people there already.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b> Let us all know which areas you
are using... it might help Lex in South Africa too...</i>
<blockquote><b>To which Shlomi replied: </b>Well, my main tool right now
is work. I am connected to the internet all the time, so I spread the word
on IRC, attracting newbies. I thought that in a later stage, I'll post
notes in chess clubs or other places (still need to think about it) and
try and attract those people. I think this game has some similarities with
other games, and those people who play those other games may also be interested
in this game. But not yet, I'm still working on the email/internet/phones
area.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>You're doing the right thing.
The results to effort ratio for the internet over more manual methods of
recruiting is WAY superior. Only worry about pounding the pavements AFTER
you've chased down the bulk of your net leads... the reward for time is
much lower after you start posting notices in games shops/clubs etc. Concentrate
on your recruits' friends too... concentrate on them hard. You can almost
increase your catch by half again by chasing them down.</i></blockquote>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This brings me to my question - when you said "establish a hobby
base", how many people did you mean ? 20 ? 50 ? 200 ?
How many people participated in the tournament - and to count it as a success,
how many people did you need ?
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b> Have a look at the New Zealand
Diplomacy Championships web page at <a href="http://www.stevensons.co.nz/~bjc/Diplomacy_articles/NZChamps.html">http://www.stevensons.co.nz/~bjc/Diplomacy_articles/NZChamps.html</a>
As you'll be able to see in the results from the 1998 tournament there
were 29 players. That gave us four boards per round which I was thrilled
with as a first effort. How many people did I need for it to be a
success? I was hoping for 21 (3 boards) and so exceeded my own expectations.
The 1999 tournament grew to 5 boards. The aim is for 6 or 7 boards in 2000.</i>
<blockquote><b>To which Shlomi replied: </b>I checked out the website.
Cool. I have 39 players listed on the mailing list so far, and some newbies
still not onboard. Growing, growing... We are organising a game on saturday
the 8th of January, so far it's looking good. I am thinking, how should
I use this game to promote the issue ? Some players expressed their
interest but their lack of time currently. I don't want to lose these players
- they might be those who come next time.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>The mailing list is the key. Keep
them on the mailing list. I've got two mailing lists...one for announcements
only which only I can post to... it's for those who don't want the high
traffic stuff but want to be kept informed. Then I have a second list for
the advertising and organising of games, light hearted banter, and the
analysis and review of games. It creates the sense of community. Also,
get snail mail addresses if you can. Once a year, three months out from
your tournament (when that happens) send out a full brochure thing to try
and kindle the interest in those on the margins... take what you can get
for the first year, and then after the first tournament make sure you do
a review...type up a review and post it out by snail mail and email to
all your contacts.... make them see it was a success and make them want
to come next year... in your review explain how to get onto the announce
email list and then make sure you post updates every month.</i></blockquote>
BTW, there was a sort of Diplomacy convention in Israel two years ago,
but it was pretty poor, nor properly organised, and only 13 players, two
rounds (yours truly won the event). I am taking that lesson very seriously,
and I hope to do things better this time.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>Good. People hate getting burnt.
Lots of people will not come to your first effort because they think it
will fail and don't want to invest the time in something they think will
be a flop. Make SURE you shout from the rooftops when it's a success, and
needle them to come to the second one...</i></blockquote>
My strategy here is a little different than yours (I think). I first want
to create the hobby base, and not talk about a tournament. I have learned
that people who don't play regularly (basically every person I know) are
usually reluctant to enter something so formal so early. Talking about
making a tournament will only scare them (even enough to object joining
the hobby base), and I want as many people in the hobby base as possible.
It shows strength to have many members.
</blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>By the sounds of it the Israeli
hobby might be smaller than the New Zealand hobby was. Having said that,
you've got a much less dispersed population to draw on. What's the population
of Israel?</i>
<blockquote><b>To which Shlomi replied: </b>I think we're a small community
of Diplomacy players here. The population of Israel is 6 million people,
including all the non-Jewish citizens (about 20%).</blockquote>
<i>Well there's only 3 million in New Zealand. You're way ahead of me</i>
<blockquote>However, there are many parts of the population that are not
a target crowd: religious people, Arabs, the poor, new immigrants, and
more.</blockquote>
<i>I see....fair call.</i>
<blockquote>I think the average Diplomacy player here (I'll be happy to
be proven wrong) is: non-religious, at least 12 years of school (possibly
also academic degree), a city boy, works in an above average paying job.
Something along those lines. Again, I might be wrong, but all the diplomacy
players I've met are of this kind.</blockquote>
<i>That is the usual profile. Here in New Zealand we now have a pool of
about 15 - 20 women as well.</i>
<p><i>... Once you show them with one or two club meetings that it will
come...</i>
<blockquote>Now that's a good idea. After two games or so I'll announce
the Diplomacy Club of whatever-name, and this could be cool. I see a small
weak point: as long as things are solely organized by me, this might cause
some problems later.</blockquote>
<i>Yes, I had that problem too. I was the organiser, and if I'd disappeared
it would have a ll fallen over. However now (two years later) it's grown
to the point where it operates with only a small amount of effort from
me, and several of the leading club players have started organising stuff...
Grant Torrie ran the second NZDC (with my help) so now if I disappeared
I am confident things would keep on keeping on without me..</i></blockquote>
I am using a very aggressive (probably similar to my style of play) method
for recruiting new members. I look for them in the judges, the ICQ, the
IRC, and players' friends too. I am even making some publicity for the
game in the IRC (when I enter it), and offer to teach this best-ever-board-game
to interested people. I already have two students :-) I also instruct
other Diplomacy players in Israel if they wish to play by the judges. I
think it's important that people play the game, and remember how much they
love it, or else they might lose interest.
<p>We continue to grow, and I am even thinking of making the first game
with these members in two weeks or so. It could be a nice test and see
how this works. I am making a serious effort not to rush things, so people
won't lose faith. If we try to organize a game and fail, it could be bad.
<p>Later I received an update from Shlomi, indicating that things in Israel
are going from strength to strength:
<p><b>From Shlomi Yaakobovich (<a href="mailto:shlomiya@yahoo.com">shlomiya@yahoo.com</a>):</b>
<p>Well, since we've talked, we've had 2 FTF games already! The
first was of a pretty-low level of play, with 3 beginners an unbalanced
board (2 couples played), but it was fun. We didn't finish the game, but
we did get to 1906 when it became obvious that the FR alliance would sweep
the board (I was France...). The second game, which we played yesterday,
had some veterans, and it was much more significant. Not it's result, but
it's essence. I won the game as Austria (a concession in 1909) - I had
17 SCs going for 20 - but that is less relevant. The people who played
in this game were experienced people, who play FTF now and then, but most
of them play on the judge. That's how I got to them.
<p>These people were contacted by me during the last two months, and were
added to the mailing list. Last week I sent a message we're organizing
a game this Saturday, and asked who's interested. Surprisingly, 6 other
guys were interested! So, although we played a game before (players
were guys I knew or their friends), and it was the second game, it was
actually the first game that was based on people coming from the list.
And this game was a big success. Obviously I am happy over my solo, but
I am more happy that the Diplomacy hobby is getting into shape.
<blockquote><b><i>Author's response: </i></b><i>That is fantastic news
mate... really, I'm thrilled to hear it's going so well.</i></blockquote>
We've had some other diplomatic action lately, I thought you might be interested.
<p>I have contacted a group of people in southern Israel, and they have
<i>never</i> played a seven-player FTF game before. They are are newbies to the judge.
So, I created games for them, and one by one they joined the judge play.
They now play Diplomacy by email, and although it's not the real FTF thing,
it keeps them playing, and that's important.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>Absolutely agree... that's superb
news... if you keep them playing by email it increases the chances of one
or two of them deciding to travel to your tournament, and if you can get
even one of them to make the trip, they'll have a great time, and go back
and tell the others how good it was, and next year they'll come in numbers...</i></blockquote>
I am doing it for other guys in Israel too.
<p>I have created the first Israeli-only Diplomacy game played on a judge.
It helps two causes: increase the Diplomatic activity between Israelis,
and help people get used to different kinds of games (email, FTF, postal,
etc.). I think it's important to vary the activity and open the people's
minds, before I announce a tournament. Above that, it allows players to
communicate on the phone, or FTF if they know each other (it's non-gunboat).
<p>I am playing around with another idea: a realtime ICQ/IRC game. It will
help people from other parts of Israel to play. I don't think the time
is right for that yet, though.
<p>That is a problem - the long distances. People don't want to go all
the way from Haifa to Tel-Aviv to play a game. It's a long drive. The two
games were played in the Tel-Aviv area, with player from around Tel-Aviv.
It's in the center of the country. There haven't been any games in Haifa
yet. Or Jerusalem. I may even go there and organize a game myself. We'll
see.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>The distances aren't really that
long. They will think they are at the beginning. I fly to Australia to
play in tournaments. I don't do it</i>
<i>every week or every month, but I do do it. So far a total of four
other Kiwis have flown to Australia with me in the last year.</i>
<p><i>If you start having monthly meetings, you may find that a car load
(say 4 people) will travel down to Tel Aviv once a month... they can make
a weekend of it or something... play Diplomacy... go out for dinner...
party a bit... go to the theatre...whatever turns them on....</i>
<p><i>Have a look at the <a href="http://www.armada-dip.com/">ARMADA</a>
pages... (See Manus' About the Pouch intro in the last issue of the pouch)
- it's sounds like the model they're developing for the Rocky Mountains
area might suit Israel too...</i>
<p><i>The mailing list is the key. Keep them on the mailing list.</i></blockquote>
There are 46 members, things are slowing down a little. I hope to get to
60+ in two months, and then start thinking of the tournament. Somewhere
in September I think, maybe late August. Three rounds is what I have in mind,
I want at least four boards, but I am troubled by the amount of time we'll
need. Well, still time for that.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's Response: </b>Aim for three boards for your
first tournament. If you get four like I did it's a bonus, but three boards
is what you need for it to feel like a</i>
<i>tournament and not just a club meet... four is great, five is amazing...</i>
<p><i>Advertise your tournament internationally - you might find you get
some people from Europe keen to come...</i></blockquote>
<P>
<H4>From Andrew Goff:</H4>
I just wanted to add a little something to Brandon's advice about
setting up and running a tournament. I'm sure Brandon does this too, but it
was strangely omitted.
<P>
Recruit. When you're drinking with friends or having coffee or whatever and
someone asks, "what're you up to this weekend?" tell them, "I'm playing in this
Diplomacy tournament and blah blah blah."
<P>
So many people just go, "oh, nothing much" -- or even worse they treat it
negatively: "Oh - you wouldn't be interested, it's just a board game." This
will kill your fledgling hobby stone dead.
<P>
The easiest way to get new players is to talk to friends/workmates/complete
strangers about it and get their interest up. If they don't like it then you
haven't lost anything. If they do, then they can tell their friends about it
and you're building a hobby that will survive without you having to be there
all the time.
<P>
Brandon is undeniably Australia's best advocate of promoting the game, and I
think he has underestimates his personal magnetism in his article. He's a
champion, and it's well worth a trip to Australia or New Zealand just to
meet him!!! But even if you have the personality of a brick you can still
have success by the methods in the article and the method above.
<P>
Remember that not just people into Warhammer are going to like this great
game. It is something that such a diverse range of people enjoy that you
could find a wannabe World Champion just about anywhere - it's just a matter
of talking them into that first game!

but the only thing I know is the win in WDC-96. That alone hardly qualifies...
Other will have to judge about that. And only two Frenchmen. Well; as far
I think. A good Diplomacy player will have to know how to play as well
1907-games as well as DIAS, no-time-limit-games. The Frenchmen are brilliant
as 1907-games are concerned but weak on endgame. The above players are
really good players no matter system or time limit.
<H4>From Leif Bergman (<a href="mailto:leif@pobox.se">leif@pobox.se</a>):</H4>
<p>Hard question but made me start thinking.
When you do a survey like this you have to put away your feelings about
what right and wrong. Who has achieved the most from his/her diploming.
<table>
<tr><td valign=top>1.
<td>
Adolf Hitler in the early stages of his era was a great diplomat,
setting up a goal and achieving it.
<tr><td valign=top>2.
<td>Stalin: The same there, Poland and all that.
<tr><td valign=top>3...
<td>Now it becomes harder, there are many to pick from. Tito, Churchill, and
Raoul Wallenberg to mention some of them. After thinking for a few moments
I have to say that there are two that stand out (Hitler and Stalin) and after
that it's an even race between many.
</table>
<p>More interesting is the best Game Diplomats.
Having played on the international scene for 6-7 years and attended
well over 60 cons playing Diplomacy I might have some answers to this.
<p>In my book the best <i>Diplomat</i> is Nils Lindeberg, a former Swedish player
who taught me a lot when it comes to talking: every word he says, every
arm moment, every raising of his eyebrow had it's purpose. When he played
Diplomacy he was 100 percent focused.
<P>
Places 2-6 I choose not to rank they all have different ways
and they can't be ranked.
In no particular order, I would list:
<ul>
<li>Bruno-Andr&eacute; Giraudon (France)
<li>Christian Dreyer (Sweden)
<li>Pitt Crandlemire (USA)
<li>Toby Harris (UK)
<li>Emmanuel Lorge (France)
<li>Karl Steng&aring;rd (Sweden)
</ul>
<p>There are many many many more but this is a table I would like to see
some time! There are also many players that are really good at some countries.
When you have Emeric Mitzi (UK) playing England or Henrik Anderson
(Sweden) as Germany or Austria or Bj&ouml;rn von Knorring (Sweden) as France
you have to pay special attention to them. But if you have <i>any</i>
of the above
mentioned players on <i>any</i> position on the board you are in trouble.
They are all great at every power.
<p>In Sweden we have a competition called The Golden Blade Award. It goes
to the player that first takes a solo with each country in an FTF non-gunboat
competition. No one has claimed the trophy yet but Karl Steng&aring;rd only
has Russia to go. I have Turkey and Germany to go. Anyone else out
there who likes to claim the glory?

<H4>From Daniel Kirkwood (<a href="mailto:dkirkwood@ameritech.net">dkirkwood@ameritech.net</a>):</H4>
As always, the Fall 1999 Retreat issue of the Pouch was superb.
My interest was particularly piqued by your challenging your devoted readers
to give their nominations for the ten greatest diplomats (as opposed to
Dip players) of the last millennium. Here are my nominations; others'
mileage, of course, may vary. (Note: I deliberately didn't
list theoreticians, such as Machiavelli or Clausewitz; some may disagree
with my reasoning in not doing so.)
<p>Note to the hypersensitive (though if you are, why do you play Dip?):
<p>This article is about as "politically incorrect" as one can reasonably
get. One of my top ten may in some not-too-distant day be canonized
(in my opinion, rightly so), another's the most reviled figure in modern
history (again, rightly so). Not one is uncontroversial. I
am well aware that, if you choose to publish this (and you probably shouldn't,
because it's very long and rambling, among other reasons), you and I will
probably both need asbestos underwear. Thanks for reading it, anyway.
<ol>
<li><b>Prince Otto von Bismarck.</b> I can't imagine
any reader not listing the Iron Chancellor in their top ten, and would
expect at least half of your respondents to put him at #1. The unification
of Germany under Prussian headship required three victorious wars in under
seven years; in each case Bismarck had to first devise a pretext to fight,
and then win the war quickly in order
to keep other powers from intervening (Britain and France in 1864; France
in 1866; Austria-Hungary in 1870). Having done this, he had
the sense to be content with his gains and make alliances to ensure Germany's
security beyond all question, rather than attempting to conquer Europe.
Aside from all this, he deserves all honour from devotees of the Hobby
for providing the supreme historical example of a stratagem dear to every
Dipper's heart: doctored press. His editing of the famous Ems
telegram provoked Napoleon III to declare the war which overthrew his empire.
</ol>
<p>Bismarck is unquestionably Number One, but I'm a lot less sure about
the order of the rest. In no particular order, here they are.
<ul>
<li><b>Princes Klemens von Metternich and Louis de Talleyrand.</b>
The architects of the system that remade Europe after Napoleon's downfall
deserve joint recognition. Austria had lost every one of her wars
with France except the last one. France, in turn, had stomped over
the length and breadth of Europe for twenty years and lay exhausted and
nearly defenceless. Yet, due to the brilliant performances of Metternich
and Talleyrand at the Congress of Vienna, France was allowed to retain
the status of a Great Power and virtually the same frontiers she had started
with in 1792, and Austria regained all of the territory she had lost in
Central Europe, plus Lombardy and Venetia, and dominated both Germany and
the rest of Italy besides. Their real accomplishment was establishing
a European state-system that survived in its original form until the revolutions
of 1848 and, with some changes that were perhaps smaller than is generally
appreciated, until the outbreak of the First World War.
<p>As A. J. P. Taylor, a superb source for the history which inspired The
Game, put it in the preface to <u>The Struggle for Mastery in Europe</u>:
<blockquote>
<i>"We talk of the ancien regime as though there reigned then a divine
stability. In fact Powers ran up and down the scale with dizzying
rapidity. Of the Powers universally ranked among the Great at the
congress of Westphalia (1648), three -- Sweden, Holland, Spain -- ceased
to be Great and one, Poland, ceased to exist before the close of the
eighteenth
century; their place was taken by Russia and Prussia, two states hardly
within notice a century before. There was no such whirligig of fortune
in the nineteenth century, despite its supposedly revolutionary character.
The five Great Powers who launched the First World War in 1914 were the
Great Powers who had made up the Congress of Vienna in 1814."</i>
</blockquote>
<P>
<li><b>Nicchia, Contessa di Castiglione.</b> Most respondents,
if they'd thought of the unification of Italy at all, would have given
this spot to Cavour. Not me. Italy, unlike Germany, couldn't "do
it herself": Charles Albert of Sardinia tried attacking Austria unaided
in 1848, when Austria was wracked by revolution, and got stomped flat in
short order. While Cavour might well have been able to persuade Napoleon
III to come into Italy, as his renowned uncle had done, he would have had
a much harder time persuading him to leave again if he hadn't had Darling
Nicchia, the most dazzling beauty of her time, available to lead the Emperor
around by the, um, uh, <i>nose</i>.
<P>
<li><b>Queen Elizabeth I.</b> I must apologise to female Dippers
that my two female nominees represent polar opposites in their use of feminine
wiles: Good Queen Bess is perhaps history's ultimate example of the
uses of playing hard to get. The royal houses of Spain, France, and Austria
competed for her hand; she gave encouragement to all and consent to none,
and, carefully gathering her strength, was ready for the Invincible Armada
once Philip lost his temper and launched it. Even her choice of an
heir resulted in a gain for England; by picking James of Scotland she assured
that the British Isles would be united under one head.
<P>
<li><b>Pope John Paul II.</b> Stalin is famously supposed to have
asked: "The Pope! How many divisions has he got?" None at all; but
within less than a decade of Karol Wojtyla's election to the throne of
St. Peter, Stalin's heir felt forced to pay a begging visit to the Vatican,
and a few years after that, Eastern Europe was free and the Soviet Union
had disappeared. Pretty good for a head of state whose army consists
of a few dozen guys with halberds! Of course, communism's inability
to match Western-style prosperity and Reagan's arms build-up had a lot
to do with it too, but the Pope's connection with the Polish people and
his success in covertly persuading the U.S. to help played an invaluable
role. Even in Diplomacy, good guys don't always finish last.
<P>
<li><b>Adolf Hitler.</b> Again, I have to go from one extreme
to the other; first from harlot to virgin, now from saint to devil.
Even so, I am reluctant to say anything about Hitler except for the obvious
fact that he was a murderous bastard. But the fact is that he was
probably the all-time champion at getting other countries' leaders to do
exactly what he wanted them to, against their own best interest.
From the Anglo-German naval treaty of 1935, to the Munich agreement, to
persuading Stalin to aid in the destruction of Poland and stand on the
sidelines applauding as France was conquered and Britain besieged, all
Hitler's opponents (except of course for Churchill, who came to power almost
too late) ended up looking like complete idiots. If his megalomania
hadn't completely overwhelmed his cunning in taking out one opponent at
a time by the middle of 1941, one shudders to think what might have happened.
<P>
<li><b>Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II.</b> The question called for
the top ten diplomats of the millennium, not the last 500 (let alone 200)
years; and if any mediaeval figure deserves the nod, it would probably
be the man his contemporaries called <i>Stupor Mundi</i>, "Amazement of the World."
The most renowned skeptic of his time, he overcame excommunication and
the hatred of almost all orthodox Christians to become the only Crusader
to enter Jerusalem without a fight, and, upon his return to Italy forced
the Pope to yield and remove the interdict.
<P>
<li><b>Emperor Meiji of Japan.</b> In 1853 Japan was a
closed, feudal state; just over fifty years later it had signed an
alliance of equals with the British Empire, the greatest power on earth,
and crushingly defeated Russia, the power everyone else expected to dominate
the Far East. For opening Japan to the West, and not only maintaining her
independence of the Great Powers but growing economically and militarily
strong enough to join their ranks herself, the Emperor deserves most of
the credit.
<P>
<li><b>William of Orange.</b> One might think it odd that a man called
"William the Silent" would be numbered among history's greatest diplomats,
but the fact is that his leadership, uniting Holland and England in his
person, formed the nucleus of the coalition which after his death succeeded
in preventing Louis XIV from conquering all Europe. King William's
foresight made Marlborough's victories possible.

<p><b>From Zep (<a href="mailto:pzaft@servomex.com">pzaft@servomex.com</a>):</b>
<p>Hi Bruce,
<p>I just read your F1999M zine article on the Machiavelli judge implementation
and found it most enlightening. I've only played a handful of judge games
(many of which have crashed) but as a player of the battle line version
from many years back I find the differences interesting but find they do
not detract from playability.
<p>Points of special interest were:
<p>"Special units if attacked have their entire support broken in a normal
manner." I never knew that thought it was only reduced accordingly.
<p>Points I'm still not sure on:
<p>"Transfer of assassination chits can occur at any time. The receiver
is not notified."
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>Thanks for your letter;</i>
<p><i>No one is notified. In fact, since I wrote the article I've had someone
(identity withheld to protect gunboat) write me telling me that on USIN
it doesn't even always show up properly in the listing immediately. I need
to try this next time I can test it without bad game consequences.</i></blockquote>
I guess that means no other power is notified but you never know with all
these bugs. Please confirm, I've been longing to know this as I have a
close ally in one game and we want to swap chits but not if other powers
find out.
<p>"Bribes against units in cities of value greater than 1 cost twice as
much."
<p>I've long wondered about this, the rules say major city garrisons which
suggests fleets and armies are not doubled.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>I didn't word it well. The only
units that can exist in cities are garrisons; they are the only ones for
which the bribes cost twice as much. Armies and fleets are priced normally.</i></blockquote>
"If a power takes control of another home area, from that point on it doesn't
lose control of a home area unless another power gains control of it. Thus,
a power could own nothing, and remain in control of several home areas."
<p>I understand the above but the following just confuses me.
<p>"[Yes, I know that another common ruling is that when one loses control
of all but one home area they are back in the state as if they had only
an initial home area. I feel each choice is somewhat arbitrary, but my
ruling has a little more tradition.]" Please explain further.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>Well, in the case where a power
has taken another home area, simply losing the cities of either home area
does not remove control of that home area from them.</i>
<p><i>The situation I then mention is that when someone _does_ manage to
take control of the home area, does the original power get eliminated if
they lose their home cities? Or are they still safe unless another power
takes complete control of their home area? I tend toward the later interpretation,
but I think both could be justified. I know of GMs who use each, and I'm
not sure exactly how the judge does it (or if the judge does it consistently)
since it comes up very rarely.</i></blockquote>
"Fleets can't carry an army inland, and the convoy cannot jump coasts."
<p>Do you mean to inland or from inland or both? e.g. a fleet in Aquila
cannot convoy A Bari-Aquila-Spoleto or A Bari-Aquila-Capua. But is A Capua-Aquila-Bari
or A Spoleto-Aquila-Bari allowed?
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>I mean that the army must start
in an area with a coast adjacent to the fleet at the start of the convoy,
travel through fleets that form a continuous chain of each legally being
move to the areas the adjacent fleets are in, and end in an area with a
coast adjacent to the final fleet in the chain.</i>
<p><i>So of the examples, all are disallowed. Sorry for the poor wording.</i></blockquote>
I would appreciate your advice on these matters and humbly suggest you
revise your article for the benefit of others.

Hi Paul,
<p>I like reading your articles very much.
<p>In the article you talked about tending to chose allies (and enemies)
because they have a low fear rating. One idea that occurred to me, might
be to focus instead on choosing an ally who shared your same perception
(fear) of a third parties. This seems more natural, as every alliance needs
a good target to stay viable.
<p>It so turns out that the two best candidates for Italy (Russia and England)
are natural allies in both respects, although we see that Russia is more
likely to get distracted by Turkey (who, as you pointed out, is a secondary
concern to Italy early on). If we wanted to generalise your results to
other cases (non-standard maps, redefined midgame fear factor..) differences
may emerge.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>Thanks for your feedback. I'm

<b>From Kevin Hill (<a href="mailto:mdkhill@mindspring.com">mdkhill@mindspring.com</a>):</b>
<p>Hello Mr. Windsor,
<p>My name is Kevin Hill. I'm a relative newcomer to Dip.
<p>Let me begin by saying, I'm extremely impressed with all of the articles
I have read by you. I've read Lawyer Dip, Caissa at the Table, and
now Geography is Destiny.
<p>I'm still rather conservative to try negotiating the way you described
in Lawyer. To me it seemed slightly more aggressive than I'm comfortable
with at this point. That may not have been your intention, just my
interpretation. After reading Caissa, I started an Excel spreadsheet
to track tempo in the 2 games I was playing in. I was very diligent
at it for the first 5 or 6 game years. After that, the units began
to wander and I began to tire of trying to back track each one to it's
starting location. I'm excited to try a strategy based upon the points
you made in Geography. I'm going to try Germany, Austria or Turkey
I hope.
<p>I have a few questions/comments regarding Geography.
<p>Wouldn't it be true, based upon your analysis, that a power should try
to
ally with another power whose fear factor is close to it's own? For
instance, Austria and Russia, Turkey and Russia, and Austria and France
all have identical fear factors. Other than the last, the others
seem to be typical alliances. Anyway, if two powers allied whose
fear factors were very different, for instance Italy and France, the more
fearful of the two, in this case, Italy, would be always worried that his
ally, namely France, would be considering a stab, true? Of course,
a stab is possible in any alliance, but in that case, it would seem more
potent.
<p>Towards the end of the article, you list some assumptions that you think
are untrue. You suggest that Germany and Austria are not natural
allies. I understand that that doesn't mean they should be enemies
necessarily either. However, one of the reasons I've heard that they
should not pursue hostilities toward each other is that each leaves a weak
side if they divert attention away from their traditional enemies, France
and England for Germany, Russia and Turkey for Austria. What is your
opinion on that?
<p>Also, in your specific example of altering Italy's strategy, you propose
attacking Austria first. Or rather, in the first year. From
basically all the articles I've read on opening strategy, it is suggested
that making enemies in the first year is a bad thing. What is your
response to that?
<p>On an off topic, where did the name Caissa come from?
<p>Anyway, this is long, so I'll quit. I think those were my main
questions anyway. Please reply at your leisure.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>Hi Kevin,</i>
<p><i>As always, I appreciate the kudos. Now on to the points of business
you raise.</i>
<p><i>First, as to the "aggressive" nature of lawyer-style negotiating,
I would say that it both was and was not my intent. What I mean to say
is that I never consciously said to myself that I must ensure that anyone
who reads this article will become a more aggressive negotiator. OTOH,
I do think that for most people, that will be the natural result. Since
I also think that most people can afford to be more aggressive in their
negotiations, I don't think that's a bad thing.</i>
<p><i>You make a good point about allying with powers with similar "fear
factors." Your Italy/France example rings true. There are probably a lot
of different ways to view that fear factor analysis and, to be honest,
I'm not certain that I've got it right. Like most people, my opinions about
things like "what's the best way to play alliances?" is in a constant state
of evolution. What I like most about the feedback from this article is
the way people are being spurred to think fresh.</i>
<p><i>You also make a good point that when I say that A/G are not the automatic
natural allies that they are reputed to be, I'm not saying that they are
automatically enemies either. I do think, though, that better play can
be achieved by taking a more balanced view of the A/G relationship. To
return to an observation from my article, Austria, owing to her lack of
fleets, has a greater interest than any other power in getting across the
major north/south stalemate line. I think that better Austrian play would
include an invasion of Germany much sooner than most Austrian players begin
to contemplate such things. I agree with you that the case can seldom (but
not never) be made for such an invasion in, say, the first two game years,
but playing the center powers calls for fluid and flexible strategies (owing
to all of those high fear factors in every direction). It's all well and
good for Austria to team up with Germany in 1901 to ensure that Russia
is denied both Sweden and Galicia, but if 1903 rolls around and Russia
is at 4 SCs and Germany is at 8, in my opinion it's time for Austria to
pursue a new dynamic. Yet, how may times have we been involved in such
a game where Austria refused to perceive the large neighbour to the north
as a threat or, alternatively, said that he supposed it was a threat, but
there was nothing he could do because it was "too early" to contemplate
sending units north? That's the kind of thinking that I'm hoping to encourage
people to rethink.</i>
<p><i>On Italy attacking Austria first: Yes, I generally agree with the
rule that making enemies in 1901 is generally not wise, but every rule
has an exception (except that one ;-)). The unique problem for Italy is
a lack of ability to build an effective strategy based on attacking neutrals
first and other players second. This is a power wherein a case can be made
for the S01 stab strategy. Let me repeat, though, that Italy's S01 stab
of Austria has to be a multi-faceted, long-term strategy which is part
of a grander strategy for playing the whole board. That's a pretty tall
order and you should only violate the "don't attack other players in the
opening" rule if you can fill that order.</i>
<p><i>Other folks have asked where "Caissa" comes from. In chess literature,
Caissa is frequently cited as the goddess/muse of chess. I think there
is even an online chess site called "Caissa's Web" or some such thing.</i>

<b>From Clay Snyder (<a href="mailto:clay.snyder@dinuba.com">clay.snyder@dinuba.com</a>):</b>
<p>I just felt like commenting on Paul Windsor's article
"Geography is Destiny." Actually, it's not so much in response to this
article in particular as it is to a general trend I've noticed in The Pouch
this last year. This may just be my own ignorance coming to bear, but it
seems to me that there has been a great push toward viewing the Powers
in Diplomacy through the lens of their aptitude for "tempo." Now maybe
this isn't as new as I think, maybe I've just not been paying enough attention,
but since when did this become the standard by which we judge the Powers?
It seems that everyone accepts it as universally agreed upon, but
I personally don't put any stock in it at all. I've seen many a game won
by a player who spent the early portion of the game turtled up, whose "tempi"
would have been very low indeed. It just bothers me a little that what
seems to me to be a theory with no base has been so readily taken to by
everyone who writes an article about Dip. Maybe I'm just being obnoxious.
Anyways, I thought I'd get it off my chest. Keep up the good work and thanks
for the time.

<hr>
<h4>
From Manus Hand (<a href="mailto:manus@diplom.org">manus@diplom.org</a>):</h4>
I was looking at the triple, and I think I see a potential problem.
With Germany opening to Prussia, Silesia, and Denmark, Russia has absolutely
no reason not to think that the Den-Swe bounce is coming. So it seems that
BOT-BAL is probably Russia's choice.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>Somebody else pointed this out.
You are quite right that moving to Bal is a better move. It complicates
things, but I don't think the situation is less optimistic for E/F/G.
There will be no setback, only a slight slowing in German advancement.
It is still near-certain that Russia will lose StP in 1902, while Germany
will likely get two builds in 1902. And the situation illustrated
in the map in the article already was conservative in assuming that Russia
would have an army in Ukr to cover War in 1901. Otherwise, Germany
will take War in 1901 and Germany will have a second build in 1901.
And one additional thing to consider is that if Russia is forced to disband
a unit in 1901, he'll need to keep his armies so there's a good chance
that he'll disband the Northern fleet. He could disband the Southern
one instead, but he's more likely to pick up a supply center by keeping
the Southern one. If he's already written off the game in 1901, then
he may keep the Northern one just to cause trouble.</i></blockquote>
Assuming that Russia does defend Warsaw in F01, Germany will get only a
single build (for Sweden) and can only build in one of the vacant centers
(Kiel and Berlin) that are adjacent to the Russian fleet. It would
seem that Germany might have to reverse course from Livonia to cover Berlin.
The Russian fleet is also adjacent to a vacant Denmark. NTH-Den is
probably how E/F/G would handle that while Germany covers Kiel and Berlin,
but now Germany is split in half and Russia in the Baltic has really gotten
to be a thorn in the side and slowed down the shotgun attack.
<p>What do you think?
<p>Manus
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response: </b>True, assuming that Russia has
defended War, Russia can be a bit more of a nuisance by moving to Bal.
But that fleet will only be of nuisance value. There is the possibility
that it would entice an E/F stab of Germany, but if the alliance stays
together Germany is fine and Russia is in serious trouble, regardless of
what Russia does. As I said above, Russia will have losses in 1902,
and the Triple can prevent Russia from making gains in the North to make
up for it. It may slow progress, but it won't set back the Triple
unless it encourages an E/F stab of Germany.</i>

Mail Received Concerning<br>
The Hasbro Interactive CD-ROM</h3></center>

<h4>
From Hayden Lewin (<a href="mailto:HLewin@sanyo.com.au">HLewin@sanyo.com.au</a>):</h4>
Well, I spent the money and purchased the new Diplomacy CD-ROM game.
<p>After parting with my hard earned ($79 from EB) I raced home and put
the disk in the drive. After three installations I finally got the
thing working. I seemed to only like a full install into the default
folder. The opening sequences were nice with period photos of the area
and famous personalities from the warring parties. It was ok but
wasn't why I purchased the game. Finally I arrived at the start screen
and click on single player game. btw there is already a patch found at
the Microprose web site.
<p>Game setup is easy, there are seven lines for the countries and a simple
click will scroll through various levels of computer intelligence (????).
A country can be set to civil disorder, low, medium, high or player.
So I thought, what the heck ill start off on medium setting as France in
a standard game.
<p><b>Enter phase 1 - initial negotiations ....</b>
<p>You are presented with a desk at which all your opponents sit. Background
music is your countries national anthem (cute) ... So I click on the create
room button to enter into a conference room, click on Germany and the send
- inviting Germany to the party ... Negotiations are made up of simple
logical orders which are constructed by clicking on icons, so i enter "Germany"
"Attack" "England" - and send (Start with a sealion) Then "Germany Move
Kiel Holland" to which a reply of accepted pops up. I am midway through
my next order when the kaiser leaves the room (frustrating) ... Anyway
you can construct many types of orders i.e. move, hold, support, convoy,
attack, don't attack, DMZ and can preface anything with hearsay to spread
a few rumours. This is a bit clumsy but how else can you talk to a computer
in a way he
understands... I try and talk to a few more parties in the same way
before clicking on the next phase button .... Warning - click too
early on this and the computer players will not have finished their negotiations
and it is like playing gunboat which is really easy...
<p><b>Phase 2 - movement ....</b>
<p>Click on Paris - click on move - click on Picardy Order entry is very
easy and very logical. When an order is entered a little arrows appear
on the map for movement, plus signs for support and anchors for convoy.
Not much to talk about here, there is also a button to click on that gives
a summary of your negotiations so you can tell which agreements you want
to break...
<br>Click on next phase ...
<p><b>Phase 3 - CONFLICT ...</b>
<br>This is good. Each order is dealt with individually and displayed
on the map. After the orders a listed, each point of conflict is
described and resolved. If you want to skip this, you can just click
on next phase and it skips the detail and you jump to the adjustment phase.
<p><b>Phase 4 - Adjustments ....</b>
<br>As with order entry click on the army/fleet and chose move or disband.
Simple again ... Then click on next phase and go 1-2-3-4 again then
<p><b>Phase 5 - Builds</b>
<br>Again the build interface is good.. Simply click on your home SC and
select either fleet/army ... If you make a mistake click again and select
disband. there was no negotiation here which is a bit of a downfall....
<p>After all builds are complete, click on next and you get a summary of
the game to date - who has what units etc., click on next turn and away
you go....
<p>The gameplay is clumsy in negotiation but is a real winner in the order
construction, conflict, adjustment, build phases... The real falling
is in the level of PC intelligence ... In short there is none. By
1908 I had finished on 22 SCs ... I tried again as turkey on High Setting
and had won by 1911. If you want to play this game by yourself only
then you will be disappointed - AI is simply not good enough ....
<p>I am yet to try a multiplayer game but I think that it will suck in
the negotiation phase and expect that ICQ or the like will be used in conjunction
with the game. However I think that in a real time over the net situation
augmented with ICQ the game will be a winner.
<p>In addition there are several variations included - shift left, shift
right, gunboat, 1898, roman fleet. But only variations based on the
standard map.
<p>In summary - if you are a novice and want to learn the basics of the
game then high level AI on the pc will be a good place to start otherwise
the game will only be useful in a multiplayer situation, only then if you
give the point and click negotiation the flick and use on line chatting....
Graphics and sound are good as you would expect in any new game.
If anyone wants to try multiplayer at any time, send me an email or try
me on ICQ 51550154 ....
<p><b>From Theo Kermanidis (<a href="mailto:theok@eisa.net.au">theok@eisa.net.au</a>):</b>
<p>I finally got myself a copy of the Diplomacy CD-ROM game. Um err...
one question? Was there supposed to be some smarts in the AI or did they
forget to include that with this release? Just for laughs I tried a 1898
variant with gunboat set. I played France and completed the 18 SC conquest
against all high rated opponents with only 2 armies and one fleet. The
graphics are nice, but if the game keeps bombing out... I recommend it
to my enemies, and people I plan to stab real soon.

From Jose Torres (<a href="mailto:r28738@email.sps.mot.com">r28738@email.sps.mot.com</a>):</h4>
I noticed a problem with RT Dip: you always need seven players ready to
go. I looked on the variant list and could not find one like this
<blockquote>
<li>
Use any map</li>
<li>
Three or more players</li>
<li>
Each player starts by submitting a list of SCs that are his first through
Nth preference for SC. Then the initial SC is assigned for each player,
much like power selection is done right now. Ideally there would
be a requirement for a minimum number of spaces between initial home centers,
and that minimum would depend on the number of players playing.</li>
<li>
After each player gets an SC, an adjustment phase begins.</li>
<li>
Finally, the HOME CENTERS could be considered what is owned after three
years or could just permit building in any owned empty center, or any center
adjacent to the home center, etc.</li>
</blockquote>
This is flexible in terms of number of players, solving a frequent issue
for RT dip. And it is a lot like several other variants.
<p>The only names I can think of is RTVariable, Variable, or Flexible Dip
<p>Jose Torres
<blockquote><b><i>Manus replied: </i></b><i>Yes, and I think Edi Birsan's
<a href="../../F1999R/Birsan/escalation.html">Escalation
Diplomacy</a> would make a good RT variant since getting seven people for RT
Diplomacy is often a killer.</i>
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's comment: </b>Hah! Excellent.. .I get to nag
you now Manus... that's a great idea, but of course most RT play is done
on the Judge... so of course we'd need someone to code up Escalation Diplomacy
for a Judge wouldn't we? Oh... my! Look over there... our very own Judge
coder extraordinaire, Manus Hand, with his very own recently lauded DPjudge
to boot... *evil grin* How about it Manus?</i>
<p><i>And before <u>any</u> of you email me, the above paragraph does not
in anyway indicate I approve of variants in any way, shape, or form. Variants
indeed! Pah!</i></blockquote>

General Appreciation of The Pouch (Ego-Feeding)</h3></center>

<h4>
From Rodrigo Rezende (<a href="mailto:rezende@cerradonet.com.br">rezende@cerradonet.com.br</a>):</h4>
I am from Brazil and I've just read an introductory article of yours in The
Diplomacy Pouch and I am really excited to play it!
A long time ago when my English was
not so good (believe or not, it was worse than this) I tried to play Diplomacy,
but didn't because I thought I would have to buy a kind of Hasbro CD to
play it by e-mail, and I've never saw something in my town. But now I see
that there is an excellent support structure to help me play!
<!--
that if someone tells me the rules, I could play it :) I've already played
another e-mail war games, and I think they were similar to Diplomacy, but
I am not sure. So can you help me with a few questions?
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's response:</b> Sure, Shoot. However, if you're
going to play, you really do need to buy a copy of the board game. You
can order it online at several online game stores, and there's also often
second hand games for sale in the rec.games.diplomacy newsgroup.</i></blockquote>
Does Diplomacy have two or more kind of units (like corps (1 supply point)
and armies (2 supple points)) or just armies and fleets?
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's response: </b>Just fleets and armies.</i></blockquote>
When a unit with more power attack one weaker, the weaker surrender and
move to an free area or it is destroyed every time?
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's response: </b>If the attack is successful the
dislodged unit is forced to retreat. Dislodged units may retreat to any
adjacent, unoccupied space that was not the scene of a stand off in that
movement phase, and which is <b>not</b> the space the attacker came from.
Whenever a unit is forced to retreat that player may decide to disband
the unit instead of retreating. A unit with no valid spaces to retreat
to is automatically disbanded.</i></blockquote>
If you can give me some other info I would be very glad too :)
<br>
-->
Thanks for running the DP!!! It is really good!
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's comment: </b>Thanks. Hearing new people in different
parts of the world enjoying the Pouch really is one of the most gratifying
things about being involved with it. Being able to help you into such a
rewarding hobby is a joy. For any questions on the rules and their
nuances it's probably worth checking out the rec.games.diplomacy newsgroup.</i></blockquote>

Some of the Mail Received Expressing<br>
General Appreciation of The DP Judge (Yet More Ego-Feeding)</h3></center>
<hr>
<p><b>From Jeremy Koopmans (<a href="mailto:jeremyk@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca">jeremyk@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca</a>):</b>
<P>Let me introduce myself, I am Jeremy Koopmans. I have long since
been interested in the game Diplomacy. This all started when I found
the actual board game in my parents game closet. I probably never
would have opened it except that I thought it was a game I had played at
my grandparents which had the same type of box. It was not the same
game, but was instead a game which had never been played by my family (I
guess they never realized what a great game they had.) Anyways, I
spent several hours acquainting myself with the game and loved the simplicity
of play and the endless possibilities it offered without using dice.
I managed to convince my dad to play a game with me but the two player
version did not do justice to the game. I tried a three player game
with my sisters but that turned into a two vs
one game invariably. Unable to ever recruit enough players get
a full game going, I have yet to play a complete game. Then, last
year, I went to college and for the first time had easy internet access.
I did a search diplomacy and found the diplomacy pouch. I browsed
around the site and was very interested by the articles that were written.
I even got around to registering with a judge but with all my time constraints
(assignments, midterms, and finals) I didn't feel I had the time to learn
how to use the judge system and be able to complete a game. Now in
my second year of BS degree in comp sci I have decided to take another
look at the game. I read the article about DPJudge and was quite
impressed. Being a programmer myself, I had thought about coding up a Diplomacy
system but I decided that without actually having played the game, I probably
wouldn't be able to do the game justice. Anyways, I think it is great
that you have created this system. I plan to observe a few games
and then start playing them. I was wondering if using DPJudge requires
experience with PBEM systems or if I can pick it up without that prior
knowledge.
