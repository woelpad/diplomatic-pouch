Meta-Gaming?</h1></center>

<h3>
You Wot?</h3>
Meta-gaming. The rights and wrongs of it are a hot topic in Australasia
right now. No one denies that it has always gone on. Few deny that
Diplomacy would
be better without it. The guts of the issue is that it's difficult to police,
impossible to prevent if players <b>really</b> want to do it, and it comes
in so many shades and degrees that it's difficult to draw a line that everyone
agrees to concerning what is acceptable and what is not.
<p>I've just finished reading Stephen Agar's article <a href="http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/ftf/meta.htm">Meta-Gaming
and Diplomacy</a>, in which he quotes Gary Pennington as defining meta-gaming
as:
<blockquote><i>"the process of trying to force someone to behave in accordance
with your wishes by using threats of actions which will be taken or not taken
outside the context of the current game."</i></blockquote>
I read that definition with interest. A less stringent definition might
be:
<blockquote><i>"Bringing into consideration during a Diplomacy game <u>any</u>
factors which are external to that particular game."</i></blockquote>
The ideal is that each game of Diplomacy is as "pure" as is possible, and
is not affected by external issues. Each player plays each game for the
game's sake, and the winner of the game is player who played the best Diplomacy,
not the one with the deepest pockets, or the strongest punch, or the car
that is taking people home, or the one with leverage over another player
due to knowledge they have about them in the world outside that particular
game.
<P>
I agree with that.  And yet, under that definition, I am guilty of
meta-gaming!  In fact,
after the Don Challenge Cup in Melbourne, Australia, on November 26th and
27th, 1999, John Cain, the Tournament Director (and others) commented
to the effect that I <i>"took 'meta-gaming'
to a new level."</i>  A little background
is perhaps in order....</font>
<H3>The Game, The Tournament, and The Cup</H3>
<p>In DAANZ Diplomacy tournaments in Australia
and New Zealand, in my experience, it is common practice for players to
employ meta-gaming (at least) in the final round of a tournament. Often
one player will be leading the race for a best country award and will either
play to prevent the player playing that country in the game he is playing
from doing well, or may even say to other players, "I'll help you get best
Germany if you help me protect my best Austria by heading for Vienna" or
other such deals.
It's also not uncommon for players doing well in the tournament to play,
sometimes overtly, to prevent other players who are doing well in the tournament
from doing well in the final round so as to maximise their own finishing
position in the tournament.
<P>
Most well-respected players (like 1998 World Champion Chris Martin) agree
that winning a tournament is a higher goal than winning or even doing well
in a particular round of the tournament.  These players, then, cannot
adhere to the exact letter of the definition given above.
<p>DAANZ affiliated tournament count for points
towards the Bismark Cup (see my <a href="Bismark99.html">article about
the 1999 Bismark Cup</a>).
This is an award that is competed for across the eight tournaments
in the DAANZ calendar and is awarded to the best <i>tournament</i>
Diplomacy player of the year. Entering The Don Challenge Cup, the last
tournament of 1999,
all I had to do to ensure I maintained my lead in Bismark Cup points was to
either finish ahead of Rob Stephenson and Tristan Lee, <b>or</b>
ensure that neither of them finished either first or second at that particular
tournament. So I played the tournament not caring about my own finishing
position in the tournament, instead trying to ensure that other players
got 18 centre victories (with my help) in the games that I played.
In this way, I stacked
the top of the tournament leader board and made it as hard as possible
for Rob or Tristan to finish in the top two.</font>
<p>Clearly I played with factors in mind that
were not only external to the games I was playing in, but that were also
external to the <i>tournament</i> we were playing in. I didn't try to force
anyone
to act or not act in any particular way. I freely admit, however, that my aim
was to try and get players other than Rob and Tristan to 18 centre victories.
This is clearly
against the spirit of the game, usually. The thing was I wasn't there to
play the game, or even the tournament. I was playing for the bigger prize
of the Bismark Cup.</font>
<p>Later in Stephen Agar's article,
he wrote:
<blockquote><i>That is the difficult question. I think that you really need
to make up your mind on this one – if meta-gaming is okay, then cross-gaming,
bribery, and threats (provided they are within the law of the land) should
be permitted. Therefore, mutual help in different games is okay (though difficult
to achieve in a tournament with a random draw), bribery is okay, and threats
are okay. If you think that the game should only be decided within the
boundaries of the game activity itself, then meta-gaming is not okay,
and neither is cross-gaming, favours or threats.
<p>I don't think it is logically possible to distinguish a middle ground
– if buying someone a pint is an acceptable bribe (&pound;2), why not a
&pound;5 note? If threatening not to give someone a lift home is an acceptable
threat, why not threatening to abuse and/or embarrass him in front of his
friends? If helping another player just because you often socialise with
them at weekends is okay, why not help them just because you're both
English or French or Swedish.
<p>The answer, of course, is that it is not okay. Mark Wightman reminded
me of the following excerpt from Fran&ccedil;ois Rivasseau’s Final Report
on World DipCon V.
<center>
<p><b>Quality of Games and Ethics</b></center>
<blockquote>The quality of the games played was quite high, this being
illustrated by the fact that no 18 centre victory was achieved in either
the WDC or the Nation's Cup competition. Although only playing until 1907
certainly does not help when you play Austria or Italy, it is worthwhile
to note that the best players did get their most significant results when
playing one of these countries: Bruno-Andr&eacute; Giraudon managed to
win with both Austria and Italy, and the number of first places achieved
with central powers was uncommonly high.
<p>Three reasons may account for this satisfactory situation: the general
level of the players, the homogeneity of the level of the tables of each
round (except the first, of course), which was reached thanks to our player
scheduling software, and, last but not least, the ethic of play which we
succeeded in promoting.
<p>One word about this; we made public during the WDC the oath of ethics
designed within the European Diplomacy Association for the next European
DipCon (reproduced below). Every player was warned that the referees would
closely watch the ethical aspect of play and would not accept playing for
others rather than for one's self. Particular care would be given to possible
18 centre victories which could have been attributed to ethical irregularity
in the competition. It was not necessary to do anything; merely making
this announcement proved sufficient. As a consequence, all players fought
until the end as they are expected to do at this level of competition,
and we had no "collective plays" to observe.
<p>The conclusion I draw from this experience is that advising the players
in this manner as to the ethical aspects of the game improves both the
level of the games and the atmosphere of the tournament, particularly for
the travellers who, as a result, should not fear a savage and uninteresting
coalition of local players against them. This is why I personally recommend,
in my capacity of Chairman of WDC V, to the incoming WDC Chairman, to adopt
a similar position regarding ethics in Ohio.</blockquote>
<center><b>EDA Ethics Oath</b></center>
<blockquote><ol><li>You should always play so that you maximise your own
score and ranking in the tournament, or in the game you are playing.
<P>
<li>You should not engage in cross-gaming. That is, you must not give
favours to another player in exchange for assistance in earlier games or
for the hope or promise of assistance in later games. Every game is a new
one and should be treated as such. You should not try to take revenge for
a stab or elimination that occurred in any other game.
<P>
<li>You should act properly when conducting diplomacy with other players
and must not cheat or complain at the least provocation. You should act
the statesman you are supposed to be.
<P>
<li>You should never attack or ally with any other player for purely
ethnical or geographic reasons.</i></blockquote>
</ol>
</blockquote>
Personally, I think the above oath has a lot going for it. I agree
wholeheartedly
with points 2, 3 and 4. However, Point 1 raises an interesting question:
It seems to me that it condones playing in such a way that does not maximise
your score in the current game you are playing, <u>so long as</u> it is
in order to maximise you ranking in the tournament. That is, it is okay to
<b><i>not</i></b>
try and maximise you own score in a given game, if you are playing to protect
your lead or position in the tournament or the race for a best country
(tournament) award. As I said above, my experience is that this attitude is
common throughout all the tournaments I know of in Australasia. By the sounds
of what Fran&ccedil;ois Rivasseau wrote, it's not uncommon in Europe either.
In America as well, it is an accepted precept of the regular tournament player
that the tournament trumps the game.
It seems an accepted facet of tournament Diplomacy play worldwide
that players will play to maximise their position in the tournament.
<p>My question is, if <i>that</i> is okay (and most people agree that it is),
what is the difference between that
and what I did at the Don? Surely my play at the Don was just taking that
principle to the next level... instead of playing to maximise my ranking
in the tournament concerned, I was playing to maximise my ranking in the
Bismark Cup, which is a "tournament" made up of the eight tournaments throughout
the calendar year. To me it's just a question of scale.
<P>
<h3>
Now What?</h3>
Whether you agree with the way I played at The Don or not, it is undeniable
that some players went away from that tournament with a bad taste in their
mouth. That is unfortunate. In a hobby as small as ours in Australasia
(118 players played in DAANZ affiliated tournaments in 1999) we cannot
afford to scare off players over issues like this. So what do you do?
<p>Some players have said, "if you buy an
expensive trophy, honour it with hobby blood and ask people to fight over
it, you'd have to expect someone will do what they can to win it. It involves
doing well and/or stopping others. Usually it requires both; this time
Brandon needed only to do the latter." Others see it very differently and say,
"That's it. Brandon's play was a disgrace, and I'm never playing in a
tournament in which he plays again."</font>
<p>So what <i>are</I> we doing about it? We are modifying
the Bismark Cup scoring system to remove the incentive for this type of
negative play.</font>
<p>Personally, I've experienced a strange change
in attitudes this year. After the Australian Diplomacy Champs in January
where two players meta-gamed to engineer a result that gave one of them
a best country award, I spoke to Rob Stephenson, close friend, mentor and
coach of mine. I said to him that what those two players did was wrong:
they conceded centres, and did not play the position out. I said to Rob
that each game should be played in isolation of the others and what we
should be doing is testing ourselves to see how good we are in each game,
within that game, and only within that game. Rob smiled, and told me he
used to think the way I was thinking, but that eventually he realised that
if you wanted to win anything you had to play them all at their own game.
He predicted I'd come around, and I looked at him and told him I thought
it was he who would come around if he sat down and thought about why we
play, and was honest with himself, then he'd see I was right and change
the way he played. Rob is the best player in Australasia, and I said to
him: "Rob, you're good enough to beat them all without this crap. You ought
to set the example and play properly...everyone respects you enough that
they'll all follow you eventually."
<p>Strangely, Rob and I sat down after the Don Challenge Cup and talked
it over. It appeared we'd both been right. I'd come around to his way of
thinking, played the meta-gaming" game better than the rest of them, and
won the Bismark Cup in doing it. Rob, on the other hand, had changed the
way he played following
our talk in January, and was now telling me I ought to play each game on
it's own merits!
<p>And that to me is the paradox of tournament Diplomacy... ideally, people
like me would refuse to Meta-game. The problem is that others will continue
to do so. Having won the Bismark Cup and possibly lost two good friends
doing it, I doubt I'll feel inclined to play that way again. It's up to
each player to decide for themselves which set of moral standards they
will play by. Until the day we all draw the line in the same place, I think
these controversies will continue to occur. I just hope that if you end
up in a situation like I found myself in this year that you don't lose
valuable friendships over it; that you don't drive people out of the hobby
in your area; and that you don't feel slightly hollow savouring your victory
the way I do. Winning the Bismark Cup should have been the pinnacle of
my Diplomacy career. Unfortunately, while some people have congratulated
me, these moments have been by far drowned out by the bloodletting in the
wake of my win.
