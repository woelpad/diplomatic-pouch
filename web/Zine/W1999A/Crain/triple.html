<h1>
The Triple Alliance Revisited</H2>
<H2>Or, How to Make it a Three-Horse Race</h2></center>

<H3 align=center><i>by Chip Crain</i></H3>
<hr WIDTH="100%">

<p>In Stephen Agar’s article about the <a href="http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/triple.htm">Triple
Alliance</a>, Mr. Agar touched on a strategy but may have failed to see
it through to its logical conclusion. When Mr. Agar suggested an alliance
between Germany, Italy and Austria, he saw the power for the alliance.
However, the wrong assistance from others is suggested in the early game.
The alliance suggested fails to take the advantage further into the late
stages of the game. Here is a possible solution to continue the powerful
beginning that has been established.
<p>The early portion of the game should be dedicated to eliminating two enemies.
The middle game should eliminate two enemies and the end game eliminates
two former friends. Therefore you need to start the game by choosing those
two countries that need to be eliminated first. Allying with your fellow
players in the middle offsets the horror of being stuck in the middle of
the board so that leaves them out (besides it wouldn't be a great article
about the Triple Alliance if you attacked each other to begin the game!).
However, any obvious allied strategy will be seen through. How do you support
each other and attack the two outsiders while maintaining somewhat of a secrecy
about your co-operation between the other two powers?
<p>The answer is to use your enemies against themselves. Align with two
of the outsiders. I know it sounds simple but it really is. The best powers
to ally with are France and Russia. Why? Because the middle countries can
squeeze those two countries once the Witches are disposed of. France is
caught between Italy and Germany and Russia between Austria, Germany and
Italian gains in Turkey.
<p>The biggest threat in the early game for Russia is Turkey and somewhat
England. The biggest threat to Turkey is Russia. They both have a back
door to the others homeland. It doesn't take a lot of diplomacy as Austria
to convince Russia he needs to assist Italy and Austria in ousting Turkey.
Italy tells Russia he is going along until Turkey is gone then ally with
Russia to get Austria. It makes it even easier when Germany drops the hint
that if Russia goes after Turkey then Germany wont make trouble in SWE
and will aggressively attack England.
<p>The same is true of France and England. The channel between Breast and
London is the most tempting of stabs. Simply encourage that mistrust. This
is usually trickier than Russia against Turkey. Germany must ally with
France against England. Don't cover it up at all. Be blatant and honest
with France. Give him Belgium if he insists but insure his attack on England.
It is very helpful if Italy tells France that he will move east if he sees
France going after England. Have Italy tell France that a German attack
would be seen as threatening to Italy since France will be loaded up against
Italian borders and that threat is too big so Italy would defend by moving
to Piedmont. If you can encourage England to attack France as well so much the
better, but it is the F/G alliance that must be maintained not the E/G
alliance.
<p>Why? Once that is done and England is under attack and dying, simply
have Italy slip the knife in France's back.&nbsp; Germany can throw their
hands up and scream about the rotten Italians. France wont view Germany
as the enemy yet. This makes Germany's stab much more effective when it
comes in the next turn. Once you have isolated France from any aid (i.e.
England) then you squeeze him from Italy and Germany. Usually France has
gotten greedy and moved his forces too far north in his battle against
England anyway. French armies on the isles are a beautiful sight when the
stab hits him.
<p>The same is true of Russia. If the diplomacy worked properly, then Russia
probably has his forces concentrated in the south. This leaves the north
open to invasion. Austria's build always provide him defence against a
Russian attack so make sure Austria builds before the stab from Germany.
<p>A possible series of first moves to open:
<P>

<tr><th valign=top><b>Italy</b>
<th><tt>A VEN-PIE<br>A ROM-APU<br>F NAP-ION</tt>
<td width=30% valign=top>Lepanto opening

<tr><th align=center valign=top>Germany
<th><tt>F KIE-DEN<br>A BER-KIE<br>A MUN-RUH</tt>
<td>Blitzkrieg opening, Danish Variant
</table></center>
<p>These openings are basically non threatening to your supposed allies
Russia and France. Instead it shows support for the alliances discussed.
Italy's move can be offensive to France but you simply convince France
you will move back to Venice and do so. Then move back to Piedmont in the fall.
Continue to move this way as long as possible. These series of moves often
can keep France from ever abandoning Marseilles and that will force his naval
wars and subsequent builds north as well.
<p>Italy starts off slow but what's new about that. He always must convince
France that he doesn't trust Austria (which explains the army in <tt>PIE-VEN</tt>).
However, admit you are working with him to get Turkey. Ideally, the word
will get back to Russia and he will want to join in on the feeding even
more if Italy is committed to attack Turkey, but is holding something back
for the inevitable war with Austria. Russia sees the elimination of his
two closest enemies by co-operating on the Turkish battle. By the way, this
is a valid concern if Italy does stab Austria before France. Hence it is
usually easier to convince Russia to attack Turkey. You have less leverage
against France if France is overly concerned about <tt>VEN-PIE</tt>. Italy must
put France at ease so Italy can stab him at some point.
<p>The bottom line is that you can eliminate the four outside powers relatively
easily. Does this lead to a three-way draw. Obviously that can happen. However
the chances for a solo are greater if there are only two strong powers to contend
against rather than five or six. Too many cooks spoil the broth. This article
isn't about the end game anyway. Austria and Germany usually leave the
game early and Italy rarely gets to be a force according to statistics.
This is a way to insure a longer and more powerful position once the real
game gets going.
