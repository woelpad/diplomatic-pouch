</i><a href="Clarke/About.html">About The Diplomatic Pouch</a></b></dt>
<dd>
Guest Editor Brandon Clarke takes you for a quick look at the latest
happenings around The Pouch and the hobby.</dd>
<p><dt>
<a href="Hand/bwl.html"><img SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif" HSPACE=5 BORDER=0 height=45 width=45></a><b><i>Manus
Hand: </i><a href="Hand/bwl.html">The Blue Water Lepanto</a></b></dt>
<dd>
Manus puts pen to paper and details how Austria can play an Austria/Italy
alliance while keeping the reins firmly in his own hands, <i>and</i>
with the added bonus of better prospects for timely gains against the Turk.
<i>(Since
it is Manus's zine, I figured it's only polite to let his article have top
billing.)</i></dd>
<p><dt>
<a href="Kermanidis/lepanto_bluff.html"><img SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif" HSPACE=5 BORDER=0 height=45 width=45></a><b><i>Theo
Kermanidis: </i><a href="Kermanidis/lepanto_bluff.html">The Lepanto Bluff</a></b></dt>
<dd>
Theo continues the discussion of Lepanto-esque openings, this
time with a twist that I'm sure will appeal to those who draw Italy and
whose negotiation style includes a heavy dose of deception.</dd>
<p><dt>
<a href="Martin/toptable.html"><img SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif" HSPACE=5 BORDER=0 height=45 width=45></a><b><i>Chris
Martin: </i><a href="Martin/toptable.html">Martin On Diplomacy:  The Top Table</a></b></dt>
<dd>
The 1998 World Champion starts off what promises to be a very welcome
series of articles, "Martin On Diplomacy." <i>[I'm already calling it "MOD"
for short.  --Manus]</i>  In this first column, Chris gives
us his impressions on the Top Table concept that is widely used in
European Diplomacy tournaments.</dd>

Back From the Dead in Diplomacy</a></b></dt>

Nick seeks your stories about amazing Diplomacy comebacks ... if
you've had an amazing comeback, read this article and send details of your

assassination.</dd>

Szykman: </i><a href="Szykman/buy.html">Where to Buy Diplomacy</a></b>
<dd>
In this hiatus between the Avalon Hill release of the game, and the forthcoming
(but late in arriving) re-issue by Hasbro, one of the most frequently asked
questions we hear is, "Where can I get a copy of the game?"  More frequently
than you think.  (Are you listening, Hasbro?)  Simon does us all a favor
(especially Manus, who has written so many "Hasbro is reissuing it but it's
not out yet, so good luck" messages that his typing fingers hurt) by going
over the currently available options.

<dd>
Chip takes Stephen Agar's <a href="http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/triple.htm">Triple
Alliance</a> article, and extends the concept.  The result
is a strong springboard
start for Germany, Austria, and Italy that will carry them
into the midgame and beyond.</dd>

Pat recently completed his first Judge PBEM game, in which he took Germany

end of 1909, and then to <b>twenty</b> SC's at the end of 1910!

Clarke: </i><a href="Clarke/metagaming.html">Meta-Gaming?</a></b></dt>
<dd>
Following the events of the last half of 1999, the topic of meta-gaming
is very current downunder. Because of this, I decided to look around the web
and find out what other people had written about the topic, and well, it
spawned an article of my own in response.</dd>

<dd>
All by itself, Manus and Simon's article in the last Issue <a href="../../Zine/F1999R/Debate/paradox.html">Eliminating
the Paradox in Diplomacy</a> produced a veritable mountain of mail!
So much so that those letters have got their own article (see
below). Here is the rest of the mail, on a wide and varied range of topics;
some of it very entertaining reading.</dd>
<p><dt>

of the last thousand years.  You can see how some of the readers responded
in the Deposits column, and here is Larry's own list!

An <i>enormous</i> amount of mail regarding Manus and Simon's
article,
<a href="../../Zine/F1999R/Debate/paradox.html">Eliminating
the Paradox in Diplomacy</a>, filled the mail bag to overflowing. Read
the spirited debate, all of it...and there's loads, believe me!

Guest Editor!)</i></dd>
