<H1 align=center>The Blue Water Lepanto</H1>
<H2 align=center><i>by Manus Hand</i></H2>

<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P align=justify>
It is a little bit surprising to me that openings still seem to be
a fertile field for innovations in Diplomacy.  It is even
more surprising that it sometimes happens that I myself have something
to contribute in that field.  I mean, even if there are indeed tactical
openings to be discussed anew, I am no Edi Birsan, whose credits include the
<a href=../../S1998M/Birsan/Lepanto>Lepanto</a> (the prototypical Italian
opening) and the
<a href=../../S1997M/Birsan/Sealion>Sealion</a> (which has become
something of a fad in e-mail play since its initial publication
in these pages).
<P align=justify>
My own contributions to the body of openings knowledge are far
less impressive.  I took it upon myself to completely categorize and catalog the
openings and make them available in <a href=../../../Online/Openings>The Diplomatic
Pouch Library of Diplomacy Openings</a>, and in doing so, I took the liberty
of naming
some of the unnamed openings.  More in the way of original contribution, I
developed the <a href=../../W1996A/Hand/Deposits.html>Slingshot Juggernaut</a>,
a Russo-Turkish feint.
<P align=justify>
I cannot take full credit for the opening that is the subject of
this article.  This opening, which I call the Blue Water Lepanto, was
the result of my study of a position created by others.  In a game I am
Mastering, the Austrian and Italian opened as described below, and I saw
in this an excellent Austrian tactic.  (Or at least excellent fodder for
a Pouch article!)  <i>[As it happened, the Austrian had not contemplated
a plan like I describe below, and so the game did not progress along these
lines, but it didn't stop me from thinking that it could have....]</i>

<H3>Background</H3>
<P align=justify>
For a very long time -- virtually since its development in the 1960's -- the
Lepanto was almost
assumed for Italy.  Every Turk worries about the Lepanto; so much so that
variations (such as the Key Lepanto) have been formulated to hide the Lepanto.
In a sense, the Blue Water Lepanto that I describe in this
article <i>could</i> perhaps be seen as yet another of these variations.
<P align=justify>
Recently, though, Italian opening technique has been studied quite a bit.
The near total reliance on the Lepanto has come under some
scrutiny, and indeed the current trend in e-mail play is away from the
Lepanto.  This reassessment seems to have been spurred by the publication
of Leif Bergman's <a href=../../F1997M/Bergman/Italy.html>Go Fasta Go Fasta</a>
method for winning as Italy, and more recently, Paul Windsor's study of the
board (in his article <a href=../../F1999R/Windsor/dipmap.html>Geography Is
Destiny</a>) reinforced some of Bergman's practices.
<P align=justify>
With the trend, then, towards a quicker-starting Italy, the Blue Water
Lepanto can be seen as a way to counteract this a bit, working in the
interests of the player most threatened by an assertive Italy.  For
the Blue Water Lepanto is not an Italian opening; it is an Austrian opening.
<P align=justify>
Actually, the Blue Water Lepanto (as you may have realized just from its name)
is an Austro-Italian opening, but I call it an Austrian opening because it
is conducted entirely by Austria.  In fact, it is crucial to the opening
that Italy be kept in the dark about Austria's pro-Italian intentions.
<P align=justify>
Yes, that's right.  It's an opening meant to benefit both Austria and
Italy, but one in which all the decisions are Austrian, and Italy
is kept unsure about Austria's true aims.

<H3><!Spring >The First Year</H3>
<P align=justify>

In the Blue Water Lepanto, the first task for Austria is to ensure that
Italy opens with a classic Lepanto.  This is usually not a difficult task,
but it is of paramount importance that Italy agrees to open with
<tt>A&nbsp;Ven&nbsp;H</tt>,
<tt>A&nbsp;Rom-Apu</tt>,
<tt>F&nbsp;Nap-ION</tt> (or any minor variation, such as a Western Lepanto
or an anti-Hedgehog Lepanto).
<P align=justify>
Austria should be talking in very definite terms about a strong Austro-Italian
friendship, promising or at least hinting that he will open with a Balkan
Gambit (<tt>F&nbsp;Tri-Alb</tt>, <tt>A&nbsp;Bud-Ser</tt>).  When the time
comes to move, however, Austria opens otherwise --  with a Blue Water Opening
(<tt>F&nbsp;Tri-ADR</tt>, <tt>A&nbsp;Vie-Tri</tt>)!
<P align=justify>

<p align=justify>
Obviously, Austria will need to come to some arrangement with Russia over
Galicia; vague anti-Turkish talk is a safe course of action for this.  However,
Austria would probably not wish to intimate to anyone on the board that he
will open to the Adriatic Sea.
<P align=justify>
Italy will of course be unhappy at this turn of events, and how Austria deals
with the Italian unhappiness is very important.
<!--
<br clear=both>
<H3>Fall 1901</H3>
-->
<P align=justify>
We see now why this is an Austrian show.  The Austrian holds all the cards
going into Fall 1901.  Italy's moves are virtually forced.  The Venetian
army must stay in place and be supported by the other Italian army.  This
means that Italy must take Tunis with his fleet.
<P align=justify>
Austria will want to discuss virtually nothing with Italy before the Fall
moves.  He could perhaps briefly reiterate that (despite the opening to the
Adriatic)
he still wishes to form a strong alliance with Italy.  However, he should
perhaps do so in such a way that he would not be surprised (or
disappointed) if his words were not believed by the Italian.  The fact is
that Austria <i>wants</i> Italy to be unsure of Austrian intentions.  It
is important that Italy feels forced to defend Venice and vacate the Ionian Sea.
<P align=justify>
Yes, Austria wants Italy to feel forced to defend Venice, but he also wants
him confused.  As I say, diplomacy should be kept to a minimum -- Austria
might even wish to be seen as avoiding conversation with Italy -- but what
diplomacy <i>does</i> occur should perhaps include
lines like, "Why would I convince you to open with a classical Lepanto,
holding in Venice and moving to Apulia, if it was my intention to
launch a supported attack on Venice?"  Italy's answer can only be what
Austria wants it to be:  "Because you thought you could convince me not
to defend Venice that way."
<P align=justify>
There may be other diplomatic concerns.  Italy may dislike the move to the
Adriatic Sea so much that he actively courts Russian, Turkish, and German
assistance against what looks to be a hostile Austrian.  Austria will
need to manage these reactions a bit, but the fact that the game is still
in its opening stages (and assuming Galicia is left vacant) will preclude
Russia and Germany from making any commitments to come to Italy's defense.
<P align=justify>
As for Turkey, we will discuss him in depth a bit later.  If Italy obtains
Turkish sympathy after the Adriatic Sea is occupied, Austria should not
need to be too concerned if things run to plan.
<P align=justify>
As to the Fall moves, Austria follows Italy into the Ionian Sea, moves Serbia
to Greece, and either holds Trieste or moves that army to Albania or Vienna.
<p>

</table>
<P align=justify>
Even now, Italy is probably not ready to embrace Austria.  An Austrian
fleet in the Ionian Sea is something that no Italy is really crazy about.
<P align=justify>
Still, though, Austria does not mind Italian confusion and should do nothing to
help end it.  The reason for this
is simple -- just as Italy's Fall moves were forced, so is his build.  Italy
now has to be concerned about things like the Tyrrhenian Sea, and it has
got to be near the front of his mind to expel the Austrian from the Ionian
Sea.  A new fleet in Naples is virtually forced.
<P align=justify>
As it happens, a fleet in Naples is just the build that Austria wants to see.
Therefore, talking to Italy in concrete terms of what the future holds can
only risk making Italy feel less forced into the build decision.  So, again,
near silence would seem to be the rule -- at least until the builds are
announced.
<P align=justify>
The Austrian build is probably an army in Budapest (or Vienna), but if
Trieste was vacated, Austria can indeed find a Trieste build useful.
However, if the opening develops as described below, 
two Austrian units will be committed to it, with the other two 
left free to defend
the north of Austria and develop separately.  So the build decision
for Austria is not crucial to the opening described here, and can be
based on events elsewhere on the board.
<P align=justify>
It may seem to be rather odd to call an opening both
pro-Italian and pro-Austrian even though the opening nets each party
only a single
build in 1901.  However, Austria has exchanged his often-given 1901 acquisition
of Greece for a very advantageous position.  With an army in Serbia
and a fleet in the Ionian Sea, Austria still has the upper-hand in
the battle for Greece.  Italy, for sure, feels a bit less than secure about
his neighbor, but after the build, Austria can open up about his plan, and
Italy will likely find reason to be happier.

<H3><!Spring >The Second Year</H3>
<P align=justify>
After the 1901 adjustment phase, Austria explains to Italy that his intention
in forcing his way into the Ionian Sea was to make himself part of Italy's
Lepanto fleet convoy and attack plan.  He should make this explanation very
long, detailed,
and convincing (because it's true).  The length of the explanation should
contrast markedly with Austria's recent silence toward Italy, and in this
way Italy
should be convinced of the truth of the words.
<P align=justify>
Making the explanation long should not be difficult, since
there are quite a few good things to say about this plan.  In a standard
Lepanto, Italy must commit both his fleets to creating a convoy chain to Syria.
While this is being done, Austria's fleet (which is near useless
throughout the game) is sitting around watching and doing its best imitation
of an army.  With the
recent articles (discussed above) arguing that Italy should not necessarily
commit so much effort to an anti-Turkish operation early in the game,
Austria's offer to provide half the naval force for such an effort
should be welcome.  Austria
should explain to Italy
that by Austria providing one of the two fleets that will
convoy an Italian army into Asia Minor, Italy can keep his other fleet
nearer to Rome where it is able to defend or wander the west.
<P align=justify>
There is another, equally good reason why Italy should come to welcome
the Austrian fleet's help.
In a standard Lepanto, assuming Turkey builds a fleet in Smyrna (and
most Turks who have been warned of a Lepanto will do so),
Italy must guess in
Spring 1902 whether the Eastern Mediterranean or the Aegean Sea will be
undefended by Turkey.  With Austrian help, though, the guesswork disappears!
<P align=justify>
<table align=left border=5>
<tr><th>Spring 1902</th></tr>
<tr><th><img src=S1902M.gif></th></tr>
</table>
<p align=justify>
Italy uses his fleet in Tunis and his new fleet in Naples to <i>dislodge</i>
Austria from the Ionian Sea.  Austria then gets to use the <i>retreat</i>
phase to move into whichever eastern body of water is left open by Turkey!
And <i>voila!</i> not only is Austria no longer a threat to the boot, but the
convoy chain is ready on the standard Lepanto schedule, and the Turk is
probably very surprised by Austria's choice of retreats.
<P align=justify>

After this move, Italy and Austria can pick and choose their targets.
They should make it a goal to get Greece for their alliance by the end of
1902.  This should not be difficult with the position they have obtained.
Austria could hopefully do so single-handedly (with units in Serbia and
Albania), and if so, the convoy chain can be used immediately.  Alternately,
a supported attack on the Aegean Sea might be in order.
<br clear=both>
<H3>The Turk</H3>
<P align=justify>
How would you, as the Austrian, handle Turkey?  It would seem that there
are many possible answers
to this question, each of which has some good points and bad points.
<ul>
<li><p align=justify><b>Tell him that Italy will open with a Lepanto.</b>  The benefits of
    this approach are that Turkey will feel forced to build a fleet in Smyrna,
	and this will aid you in convincing Italy that he should dislodge you
	from the Ionian Sea in Spring of 1902 (so that you can choose whichever
	forward retreat is available).  The downside is that if Turkey
	lets Italy know that you have spilled the beans about the Lepanto,
	Italy may not open that way in Spring of 1901.
<P>
<li><P align=justify>
<b>Tell him you will open against Italy.</b>  The benefit here is that
	you will gain his trust when you actually do open with <tt>Tri-ADR</tt>.
	This could be important if you are concerned about Italy asking for
	Turkish help after Spring of 1901.  The worst that Turkey
	can do in Fall is move <tt>Bul-Ser</tt> and <tt>Con-Bul</tt>,
	getting two builds
	and allowing Austria to take Greece.  This could be countered by
	<tt>Tri-Ser</tt>, however, and even if Turkey does manage to take both
	Bulgaria and Serbia in 1901, the forward positions that the I/A alliance
	will get should allow the Turk (assuming he has no help from Russia) to
	be cut back down to size.  It's a headache that is best avoided, though,
	so you want to keep <tt>Bul-Ser</tt> out of the question.  Telling Turkey
	about your anti-Italian opening could do this and prevent him from
	having a sympathetic reaction to Italy's cries for help.  The downside,
	again, is the risk that Turkey passes your opening plan on to Italy.
	This is a manageable risk, though. ("Dear Italy, Just to let you know,
	I will be telling Turkey that I am opening against you, but of course
	I am not.")
	
<P>
<li><P align=justify>
<b>Tell him you will support him into Rumania from Serbia.</b>
    Obviously, you won't, but this might prevent Bulgaria from moving
	to Serbia or Greece.  The risk is that word might get to Russia, but
	again, this is manageable through good diplomacy.
<P>
<li><P align=justify>
<b>Tell him you will let him have Greece.</b>
    Once again, this is an untruth.  What you will actually do, of course,
	is bounce him out using <tt>Ser-Gre</tt>.  But promising Greece to
	the Turk is probably a good idea.  It will keep him from moving to
	Serbia and getting two builds.  It will make your "attack" on Italy
	look real, since you will seem to be bribing Turkey not to heed Italy's
	requests for help.  You can even tell Turkey that with his army in Greece
	and your fleet in the Ionian Sea, you could convoy him to such spots as
	Apulia, Naples, and Tunis.
</ul>

<H3>The Russian</H3>
<P align=justify>
To begin the game, the only important issue for Austria to discuss with Russia
is Galicia.  However, if Turkey is to be the target, Russian help should
not be refused, and should probably be solicited as soon as the plan is
revealed.  An Austrian would probably want to talk long-term with Russia
about working together in Germany after Turkey is dispatched, and doing
other things to avoid the possibility that Italy and Russia will share a
sandwich made of Vienna sausage.
<P align=justify>
One of the benefits that a Lepanto brings to Austria
is that Italy gets the eastern position to allow a joint attack on Russia to
follow the Turkish demise.  Without the Lepanto, an A/I/R alliance
almost always cuts out the Austrian.  With the Blue Water Lepanto, Italian
help against Russia is still possible, but the number of Italian
units in the east that can<i>not</i> attack Russia is reduced, and Italy
is subtly encouraged to find his post-Turkish enemy either in Russia or the
west.

<H3>Options</H3>
<P align=justify>
This article presented the Blue Water Lepanto as an Austrian opening that
becomes a joint A/I Lepanto.  However, it is always best, of course, to keep
one's options open.  Although this opening can nicely be used to gain
an eastern position for an Austrian fleet (through a forward retreat),
the fact is that with Austria virtually guaranteed the Ionian Sea by this
opening, he could at least entertain the possibility of working with Turkey
(and France?) rather than with Italy.
<P align=justify>
Even with the Italian informed going into 1902, Austria could choose to
retreat his dislodged Ionian Sea fleet not towards Turkey but to the
Tyrrhenian Sea.  However, this course of action is probably foolhardy (and
Italy should see that, and thus be more secure with the Spring 1902
moves proposed for him) <i>unless</i> significant Turkish and/or French moves
toward Italy can be expected.
<P align=justify>
At the very least, though, an Austrian who is active diplomatically
(and all Austrians need to be) should at least keep his mind open to the
various possibilities.

<H3>Summary</H3>
<P align=justify>
With the Blue Water Lepanto, Austria takes an active role in an opening attack
on Turkey.  By doing so, Austria, the traditional land-power in an
Austro-Italian alliance, gives his armies more mobility by putting his single
fleet into a convoy chain.  By forcing Italy's hand through 1901,
Austria ensures that Italy builds a fleet and therefore sees himself, despite
limited mobility in the east, as a sea-power (which is less of a threat to
Austria).  When the new Italian fleet appears, Austria immediately gives it
something useful
to do (again, reinforcing in Italy that Austria is indeed friendly after
all, and that Italy should concentrate on the sea and not the land).
Finally, the arrangement is good for Italy in that it allows him to commit
less force to the east while offering him the same results.  This in turn can
only serve to encourage Italy to sail west, and Austria can be very satisfied
all around.
