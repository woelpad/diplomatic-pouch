<H1 align=center>Press, By a Newbie and For a Newbie</H1>
<H2 align=center><i>by Jos&eacute; Torres</i></H2>

<p>Writing your first press for a judge newbie is like taking
your first steps as an infant - you feel tentative and wobbly and you attempt
it feeling like anyone around you could just easily knock you onto your
backside.  Personally, mine was
enigmatic.  I had no experience on which to base
my expectation of how it would be received. 
Would people just laugh at it? 
Would I identify myself as easy prey to my neighbors?
  Would I end up antagonizing my neighbors
into attacking me when I wanted an alliance? 
I looked on The Pouch and did not find an instruction manual, and after
complaining to Manus about it, he used his Jedi mind trick and told me that
&quot;those were not the 'droids I was looking for,&quot; and so I began
writing....

<p>Not that I have vast expertise or anything.
  In fact, the one thing I am known for is
being a newbie - see last issue's article. 
So where do I get off writing this article? (Besides Manus’s Jedi Mind
Trick?)  I have been Master for one complete
game and two others, and it is a real education.
Truly.  Every newbie who
is familiar with the judge commands should consider creating a game and using
the <tt>SET ALL PRESS</tt> command, which silently send the Master a copy of every press sent by
anyone.  Then sit back, see if you can
identify the players with real skill, and watch them go to work!


<p>(Incidentally, it takes no real talent to master a
game.  There is
<a href="http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/S1997R/Gordon/GMguide.html">
a Pouch article on
setting up a game on a Ken Lowe Judge</a>,
 so that is not too tough.  The only
real duties are to remember to send in deadline extensions, and to stay out of
the way of the players.  

<p>So what follows is guidelines for writing press,
specifically geared for newbies.  It is
probably of little value to non-newbies. 
Heck, veterans may read it and get a laugh.
Or even decide to comment about how well-intentioned the article
was but how they really disagree and think that I wrote a ton of bunk, and that
one should definitely...whatever. 
Manus would really hate it if The Pouch received many many comments on
this article to put in the readership deposits column, anyway, right?
  So if you have a comment that improves the
quality of the article (or even if you submit a follow-up article better than
mine with the same title), please do so!

<p>For definitions of press types, it is essential to read
<a href="http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/judge/press.html">
the Ken Lowe judge's file on "press"</a>.
Absolutely essential.
  Any e-mail judge will send it to you if you
send a message with <tt>GET PRESS</tt> in the body. 
Save it on your hard drive, you will wish to consult it often.
  Experienced dippers probably have the entire
contents memorized, but then there was an 'expert' in a game I mastered that
didn't know the difference between Grey/White and White/Grey. (worry about that
later....) 

<p>Diplomacy
is not a sequence of tactical maneuvers (<tt>NOPRESS</tt>) but rather a game.
A player with average tactics and superior diplomatic skills should easily defeat one
with superior tactics and average diplomatic skills.

<p>Knowing the tactics of Diplomacy is as essential as knowing
that a full house beats a straight in poker. 
Without knowing the tactics, one cannot have a good grasp of what is
possible in the phase and what is improbable. 
But relying on good tactics and poor diplomacy is akin to expecting to
receive at least two aces every time the cards are dealt.  Because of
this, remember the following:
Your luck <i>will</i> run out.  It always does.
So to make headway, send press.
And send lots of it.

<H3>Advice</H3>

Strategically:
<ul>
<li>Send <i>lots and lots</i> of press.<li> Every turn.
To every country.
Especially to the ones that are attacking you.
And especially to the ones you just
stabbed.  

<li>Generally
be polite and very prompt in returning messages.
Both make you look credible and serious.

<li>There
is a time and a place for a scathing chainsaw press, but the chainsaw will cut
your own head off if used wrong, so wait a while to fire it up.

<li>Pick
a strategy/style/persona for your press, and stick with it until you see you
need a change.
An abrupt change in

<li>Never
ask another power to do something for you. 
Describe what you want them to do and tell them (sell them) on why it is
good for them.

<li>Watch
the style of press that people send you.
Try to mimic their style in your reply – that may be what they respond
to best.  If you typically get a short
two sentence presses from a player, then they might take a dim view of
receiving a four page email.

<li>Never
get caught lying. The simplest way to avoid this is to not commit to anything.

<li>Most
of your press should not be to deceive. 
Deceiving is like crying wolf. 
If you do it too often, it won’t work when you need it.

<li>When
you do want to deceive, leave multiple meanings in your words.
  If, as Russia, you receive press from Germany
complaining about your move from Warsaw to Silesia, and the German asks you to
leave, reply with something like “I will be moving out of Silesia…” which
leaves the door open to move to Munich! (or Berlin, etc.)
  When you have legitimately fooled someone,
they usually respect or have appreciation for it.

<li>
Never
get caught being completely non-committal. 
You look like a weasel.  The
simplest way to avoid this is to commit to everything.

<li>Never
ask what they want you to do, but rather, propose what you want to see happen,
and ask them if they accept or reject it. 
Most people will not counter propose, and thus you have already subtly
influenced their direction.  

<li>Hide
your emotions.  When other players stab
or insult you, never give them the satisfaction of knowing your emotional
state.  In fact, it is best to politely
ask for more insults, and write that you like it.
The whole point of insulting someone is to annoy or upset.

<li>Don't
be afraid to make your press funny, or when the time is right, to make someone
the butt of a joke in a comical broadcast (Grey or White, depending…)
  This is a developing field, but personally I
have been kept in a game because I typically wrote funny press.
  Or I’ve seen players (myself included) be
intimidated out of attacking another player who made glorious fun of his
opponents, just because they didn’t want to risk getting laughed at if they
messed up!  (Besides, the master usually
loves those…)
</ul>
<p>
Tactically:
<ul>
<li>In
your very first press to a power who is your neighbor, you will want to suggest
a DMZ or alliance with them.  If you
don’t send a message to a particular neighbor, they’ll assume you want to
attack them.  Of course, you have to
attack someone eventually, unless you plan on just retreating into 15 or 14
centers. 

<li>Keep
your very first press to each of the other powers succinct.  First impressions are most important, and one of the most important first impressions to avoid is that this game will take up too much time if you are not eliminated.

<li>Everybody
reads whatever you send them, no matter how much they hate you.

<li>Copying
other powers messages verbatim is generally a no-no.
You can get caught doing this, and if this goes against a player's own
opinion of acceptability, you won't be easily forgiven.

<li>If
you can, keep all messages sent for a particular game, and file them in a folder
or something.

<li>When
sending press <i>via</i> the judge to a power, use the subject <tt>GAMEXXXX Austria</tt> or
something, so that the message echo can be easily filed in the <tt>XXXX</tt> folder, and you
know you sent it to Austria, etc.

<li>If
you want to appear to be a Newbie, you might choose to put “end press”
(verbatim) at the bottom of your press message on one line and then “endpress”
on the next.  This makes it look like
you’re stupid, etc.  

<li>If
you’re smart, let everybody know that you’re a genius.
  It will intimidate them. <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>

<li>Use emoticons <i>[by the way, Manus coined that word; honest]</i> --
symbols like <tt>;-)</tt> and <tt>:-(</tt>.  People tend to
react to them emotionally.

<li>Try
not to babble on about your life. 
Generally, don’t include personal notes like “Sorry I was late, I had a
lot of midterm exams” because it reveals too much about you (unless you intend
to give someone a false impression).   Also, no one really cares whether it
was your aunt or your uncle that you were out of town visiting, and how many
cows they have on their farm.
Instead, if you're playing a character, say “We had to hang a traitor for espionage, and I was busy,
etc.”  

<li>Try
to get others to babble, if they will. 
If they babble, it reveals much about their playing style and
motives.  For example, in a press from
Russia to France, compliment the fine wines of Burgundy and Aquataine, and ask
to have your fellow ‘send’ you a bottle of a fine Merlot in exchange for some
exquisite Russian Caviar, etc.  

</ul>

<p>Well, these are just guidelines.
There are times and places to break each and every one.
  And knowing when comes with experience,
which is exactly what each newbie is short on….

<H3>Counter-Advice</H3>

<p>Perhaps the following anecdote is useful in seeing the applicability
of the guidelines…(and when to break them!)

<blockquote><i>

I was playing Russia, and at a whim, I signed my initial
press and every one that followed as Catherine the Great.
  When I got to trusting a particular ally (Or
I wanted him to think so) I signed Catherine, or just Cath.
  Then one player mentioned that he had
midterms and that he liked the Edmonton Oilers, and when I thought about it, I
figured the player was younger than 22 years of age and most likely a college
student.  Bing!
  I had an ‘In’ to getting the player to
identify with me better, by continuing the ‘female’ ruse and talking about the
Oilers and hockey “How do you play?” 
“What is icing?”  “I’ve been to a
game, and it was cool!”.  I babbled on
and on about personal stuff (some of it fabricated), and so did he.
  That game ended in a two way between us, but
he easily could have taken the solo! 
Incidentally, he did think I was female until the EOG.
</i></blockquote>

<H3>A Cheat Sheet</H3>

All right, to get you raw newbies started, here it is: cut and paste diplomacy:
<blockquote>
<tt>
PRESS TO F<br>
Leader of France,

<p>The people of England send this message of goodwill to you
and the people of France.  This is a
time of great conflict among all nations but we English hope to avoid war with
France and therefore would like you to agree to a DMZ in the English Channel.

<p>Furthermore, we see that there are many lands to plunder to
the east of us and that an alliance between our two great nations will
certainly bring security and prosperity to both our peoples.
  We expect that you will comment on both
proposals and anticipate that you will wholeheartedly commit to both proposals
as they are sure to bring peace and prosperity to the peoples of France.
<p>
Your soon-to-be-ally,<br>
England
</tt>

</blockquote>
<p>That should be just enough to get you started!
  Of course, if you copy this exactly,
everyone will know it and will attack you immedately. <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>
