Seeing Is Believing</H1>
<H2>Or, How To Solo Without An Endgame</h2></center>
<H3 align=center><i>By Pat Brennan</i></H3>
<hr WIDTH="100%"></center>
<p>Common traits of successful Diplomacy have been well documented in the
past. Some of these include:
<ul>
<li>
Lots of press</li>
<li>
Get your proposals in first and lead the board if you can</li>
<li>
Have one enemy at a time</li>
<li>
Count where your SC's are coming from the start and keep counting - this
helps determine your alliances</li>
<li>
Try and meet all your allies’ objectives - with moves if you can, with
press at the least</li>
<li>
Talk to everyone, even your current enemies as new alliances will be needed
at some point</li>
<li>
Don't lie to anyone except to your committed enemies, and then only if
you know they'll be out of the game soon and your lie will help make it
faster -&nbsp; tactically it may help, strategically rarely</li>
<li>
See the board as it is, not how its being painted</li>
</ul>
These read as obvious, but it always surprises me how few players actually
implement them throughout a game. Perhaps they’re not sure how to? Or are
dubious on how important they are?
<p>Its often the case that you need to see something in action to work
out how to do it yourself. This year I played in a game called Wave where
putting the above advice into action turned out rather well. I took over
a four centre on-the-ropes Germany, survived, built up through the mid-game
and strategically set up a climactic move to go from 12 SC’s to 20 SC’s
within one year to solo.
<p>To show what kind of results can be achieved by implementing the above
advice, I thought I’d present an adaptation of the Wave end of game summary.
<p>For those who are looking for ideas on how to improve their game, the
eog goes into some mechanics - what kind of press I was sending, what I
was thinking, how the big picture led to the little pictures, why alliances
were formed and changed and the like.
<p>To those of you already converted ... hopefully you’ll find the game
an enjoyable example of setting up the mid-game so as to avoid the end-game
altogether!
<h3>
Fall 1904 - Survival</h3>
When I joined Wave as a replacement in Fall 04, Germany seemed in deep
trouble. France had just taken Holland, Austria was in Munich, England
and Russia were in Skagerrak and Sweden respectively trying to take Denmark, and
Russia was in Bohemia.
<P><center><table border=5>
<caption><b>Position When I Took Over -- After Spring 1904</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src=map1.gif></td></tr></table></center>
<p>Looking at previous moves, it seemed that Russia and Turkey had used
Italy to beat up on Austria (now down to one unit which was in hiding in
Munich) and were poised to launch into Italy’s Austrian gains, into Germany
and into Scandinavia - a Juggernaut in the making. France had meanwhile
started into England (now down to three SC’s). Was the move into Holland the
start of an F-R alliance to take down England and Germany? Was Austria
going to help Russia or France as punishment for previous German actions?
<p>The first step was to find out the diplomatic picture and repair the
damage caused by previous German leaders. Missives were sent to everyone.
<p>From England, Russia and Austria, no reply. Turkey was non-committal.
Italy and France were friendly.
<p>Once the replies started coming in, it became clearer that a Juggernaut
had developed. I developed the 'Moral Rectitude' strategy that carried
me successfully through the game. Broadcasts to EFIA went out stating all
the reasons why a Juggernaut existed (citing past moves), how we were all
kaput if we didn't band together and that we had a moral obligation as
Diplomacy players never to allow a Juggernaut to succeed (a little bit
of theatre never hurts!)
<p>Why would this be tempting to other players? To England, I could promise
Scandinavian centres that he needed to help fight off France. To Austria,
it allowed him an opportunity to reclaim his home centres and survive.
It gave Italy allies to help him keep his Balkan gains and fight off Turkey
who was sending fleets his way. To France, letting England send troops
against Russia kept England’s back door open for France to slip in.
<p>Therefore I requested a beat-up-Russia mission to all players (even
Turkey who seemed wedded to the Juggernaut) and asked for peace from France
whilst he finished off England. France was the big surprise. His mail back
explained that he had had a long alliance with Germany and he wanted it
to continue whilst he finished off England (joy) and that he had covered
Holland from am English North Sea-Holland move for me in the Spring and
was going to retreat Holland to Belgium in the Fall (more joy) now that
England needed North Sea to protect her home centres. And he was true to
his word, for which I felt a deep debt of gratitude which I intended to
repay (more on this later).
<p>Italy was friendly and knew the Russian threat (Russia had just taken
Italy’s Budapest) and was happy to be part of a burgeoning G-A-I despite
the fact that he'd stabbed Austria repeatedly.
<p>The one-centre Austria in Munich played a no-press game (due to other
game commitments we found out later). Through the years, I made sure each
movement plan I constructed and sent out for the G-A-I furthered Austria
getting back home to reclaim his home centres, had Italy helping him against
the common threat, whilst pointing out that Italy needed to go south against
Turkey so there was a place for Austria in the mid-game if he cooperated.
So even though we didn't hear from Austria for some years, he left Munich
and more or less followed each plan.
<p>When the moves were processed, England continued an unsuccessful attack
with Russia on Denmark. I was able to sneak Warsaw from an over confident
Russia, giving me a build when France retreated from Holland as promised.
The first step, survival, was looking ok.
<h3>
1905-1906: The Anti-Juggernaut Alliance</h3>
Then I really went to work on England. As I needed his help in the north
against Russia, I sent joint mails to FE saying the board was consolidated
against the Juggernaut except for England, that he should go to Norway
in the Spring and that I'd support him into Sweden in the Fall (a Spring
support into Sweden would have left Russia with a retreat to Norway). He'd
get an SC, be on the side of right, a temporary truce with France, etc.
Privately I was sending mail to France saying it was a setup - I would
use England's help to diminish Russia and then stab England out of the
gratitude I felt for the Holland retreat.
<p>With England's agreement (he needed the SC's after all to fight off
France), the Anti-Juggernaut Alliance was born.
<p>Each turn, mail would go to England suggesting he support me into a
Russian SC (be it Sweden, or Stp later on) and he'd reply no way, he'd
only continue the Russian fight if I supported him in. And so it was. I
realised that if Russia was defeated, I'd have no one in my rear (a luxury
for Germany) and I could throw all my units north and west against England
and France (which is what I was telling IA) or I could throw all my units
south (which is what I was telling EF).
<p>I'd send joint mails to IA every turn with a plan that tried to meet
both their objectives (For Austria, survival and re-build; for Italy, an
SC to build a fleet to fight off Turkey and then to head off south).
<p>Mail went to Turkey every turn telling him the board was aligned against
the Juggernaut and that a stab on Russia was his only chance for survival.
But he was honourable to the Juggernaut to his credit and never stabbed,
despite my sending detailed plans on exactly how he could do it. I would
send Turkey occasional tip-offs (disguised as thoughts) on what the I-A
moves were going to be to hold up progress in the south a little whilst
I cleaned up Russia. Turkey began to ask advice on what he thought he should
do, to which I replied fairly truthfully as I didn't want Italy to succeed
too fast and I suspected I’d need Turkey’s help in the future.
<p>Within a year or two, I encouraged a peace deal between I and T, which
from the IG side was always a ruse to get Turkey to hold off some and it
was planned that Italy just keep charging forward. The beauty of this was
that it fostered long term distrust between Italy and Turkey which we in
the north (well, England and I) enjoyed immensely as we could continue
without being molested from the south. To Turkey I of course blamed Italy
for breaking the pact, saying how untrustworthy he was, which was the foundation
of Turkey and Germany later getting together. My advice / leaks to Turkey
after this were pretty well accurate. To Italy, it was a plan well executed
as it put Turkey on the back foot somewhat and we congratulated ourselves.
<p>After I took Warsaw in Fall 04, Russia finally opened comms, promising
to go south. Yeah right. I submitted proposals swapping Sweden for Warsaw
for two turns whilst he replaced Swe with Norway, but each turn his acceptance
/ counter proposal arrived minutes before the move results came through
and I'd have to 'apologise' that his acceptance came too late. This showed
to me he was never serious and was just trying to get me to back off so
he could re-take the advantage and come at me in strength. Very poor diploming.
If you're going to try something like that, you needs heaps of early and
detailed mail to get it all fleshed out in time. But my proposals weren't
that serious anyway. I was just trying to keep the comms lines open if
I needed Russia’s help later. I was on a good deal anyway ... just the
one enemy with a lot of allies. I had no reason to make peace with Russia.
<p>So the attack continued.&nbsp; Although I didn't bag another SC in 1905,
I got units into Prussia and Silesia (some tricky stuff holding Warsaw
which required a decision box for the best moves) and Russia lost Swe to
England. At this point he resigned without explanation. My first win for
the game!
<p>Russia disbanding the northern fleet and having a new Russian leader
proved a stroke of luck. It was three armies on three at the time and it looked
like tough going (hence the fear that IA might get SC’s faster than G at
the time). I immediately submitted a bogus peace proposal with a detailed
plan that had him taking on Turkey with the rest of the board while I took
on England and France. Russia did move away, but not as decisively as I
had requested. I'd slipped into Baltic and Livonia whilst England had moved
Sweden to Norway. I apologised to the new Tsar, saying I only moved there
as I didn't know whether I could trust him or not and with a backup plan
in mind, which was to convoy Liv to Swe and move Warsaw to Galicia for
an Austrian assault. I detailed for him the Sev-Black Sea, Moscow-Sev moves
which would convince me he really wanted to take on Turkey. Instead Livonia
supported Norway to Stp and Warsaw slipped into an unprotected Moscow ...
a coup I was very proud of. Russia went from four to two, leaving mop-up left
and my units pretty much free for the next target whilst Italy and Turkey
were still banging heads.
<p>Everytime the G-I-A had a success, I'd make a point of sending a Woo-hoo
mail with some ascii pictures of Russian Vodka six packs, some funny story
of where I'd picked up it up from and then submit a follow up plan for
the next stage. Italy and I had great banter going on for a while over
the green bats induced by the vodka and the like.
<p>Meanwhile, I didn't want France getting the English centres before I'd
diminished Russia, otherwise he'd likely very quickly follow up through
my unprotected western back door. So England and I started hitting it off.
Much mail, detailed. I started becoming a confidante, helping him out with
his defence of England, whilst suggesting attacks to France that I knew
wouldn't work. Not lies mind you, just thoughts and suggestions. All the
time, I was still planning to stab into the Scandinavian SC's (in return
for the Holland debt) so that France and I would finish in the north at
the same time and go south, linking up with Turkey or Italy (whoever was
best placed) for the three-way draw.
<p>Strangely France went quiet for a couple of years - I suspect it was
work, but it was a bad move. He built in Brest despite an agreement to
build his fleets in Mar. France continued attacking England despite the
anti-Juggernaut agreement, which was fair enough (what else does he do?),
but it was one-dimensional stuff. Lots of holding, bouncing and no long
term plan. He kept fleets in reserve against a possible Turkish fleet attack
(which were in Ion/Tys I think) which was ludicrous given the state of
the board instead of throwing everything into a two year plan, getting
an army into England, whatever. Mind you, I was happy in one respect because
his fleets were positioned to go into the Med and England being alive kept
him from launching into me.
<p>Throughout 1906 I asked for Bur to move to Mar, but France refused to
move it. As I kept saying to him, if you're going after Italy next, you'd
have no hesitation moving it. If it remains, you could only be going into
Germany. His explanation was he wanted Mar free to build (despite there
being no way he could get a build that turn). I made it a condition that
Bur-Mar happens before I take Scandinavia. Anyway I helped England into
Stp in order to take down Russia, Bur moved and I apologised profusely
to France about England getting a fourth SC and said that I was ready to take
Scandinavia now that Russia was almost buried.
<p>So with 1906 finished, Germany had gained Moscow and reclaimed Munich,
moved to seven centres with Sev available next year for eight, had no enemies of
consequence, allies everywhere. How to solo from here?
<P><center><table border=5><tr><td><img src=map2.gif></td></tr></table></center>
<h3>
1907 The Betrayal of France</h3>
Spring 07 was a key move on the northern front. I knew England’s Stp was
going to Norway. I submitted a proposal to France that I'd take Stp and
Swe in one swoop and move Mun-Tyr if he made a committed move to Pie and
into the Med with his fleets. No reply. What's the story? The last thing
I want to do is work with a silent ally.
<p>Meanwhile, I had submitted a proposal to England for my Danish fleet
to enter the North Sea to help support the English fleets back home, getting
all our fleets into action. England replied “no risk, no gain, a reluctant
ok”. He was well aware of the risk of leaving Scandinavia unprotected,
but what else could he do with French fleets in Edi and English, etc. England
and I swapped about 10 mails that turn. France none. If he had communicated
I would likely have repaid my Holland debt and taken out Scandinavia and
gone for the F-G-T three-way, the carebear that I am (grin).
<p>At this point, England must have been dreading the move results coming
in given the ease with which I could stab him. But it was becoming clear
I could work with England. He had good tactical and strategic skills and
was very communicative. France had made no progress against him. If I allied
with England he would be sending all his troops west against France in
order to take back the England centres (Liv and Edi had been lost), leaving
those Scandinavian centres behind ready for the taking at any moment without
any defenses. Additionally, both Turkey and Italy wanted me to take on
France to stop him charging into the Med.
<p>The result - charge the new army builds into the Ruhr to take Belgium,
take the North Sea and ally firmly with England!
<h3>
1907 The Betrayal of Austria</h3>
Meanwhile, in the south, Austria had now grown to two units, and had been
promised Rum and Sev (the last two Russian centres) in return for his help.
To finish off Russia in one go, it was arranged that I’d take Sev and give
it back next year (crossed my fingers on that one) and Italy and I would
both help Austria into Rumania. To Austria, I was then promising to head
north and let Austria and Italy clean up Turkey.
<p>I took Sev and made sure Rumania wasn't taken by Austria in the Spring
by leaking the plans to Turkey and getting him to tap Italy's Serbian support.
I then induced Italy to stab Austria, pointing out that where else was
Austria going to grow except by taking Italy's Austrian / Balkans SC's.
And that being the case, how was Italy going to take on Turkey successfully
without some more fleet builds that could only be got with the Austrian
SC's he didn't currently have. I of course also offered to send troops
into Sev / Armenia in the future to support him into Turkey. And there
was no reason not to trust me - we'd worked seemingly superbly to that
point.
<p>This meant I wouldn’t have to give up Sev, my 8th build, and that I
could take a share of other ‘Austrian’ centres without ever having stabbed.
Excellent.

<h3>
1908-1909 The Betrayal of Italy</h3>
After the Italian stab of Austria, I of course exclaimed disgust to Austria
and Turkey re the Italian stab, claiming that it was a moral right to take
down the first person from the AJA (Anti-Juggernaut Alliance) who stabbed
another AJA member. And so the alliance with Turkey, and seemingly Austria,
was born.
<p>I immediately took Rumania off Austria with Italian support (who had
no idea what was coming in the Fall), with appropriate apologies and excuses
to Austria. Turkey convoyed an army into Greece.
<p>In the Fall, I made good my outrage as Turkey and Germany performed
a dual stab of Italy - Germany taking Budapest and Turkey taking Serbia.
It was a wonderful plan that had Italy gasping and left him with no presence
of note in the Balkans. I could now further apologise to Austria and say,
look I really did hit Italy as revenge for you, I just needed Rumania to
do it ;-)
<p>The beauty of the Italian stab was that now I had two allies (England
and Turkey) who were obliged to send all their troops west against their
enemies, leaving gaping holes in the areas behind them. I also had agreements
with both of them that they would only build fleets and (with England)
that I would only build armies. Turkey could build armies with the SC's
taken on the Italian mainland and Tunis, but not beforehand, and that proved
key. I suggested Sev / Bla / Arm as a DMZ on an impulse to keep Turkey
happy and onside. I didn't know whether to regret it or not at the time
because I suspected if I wanted 18 I would want to get armies into Sev
- Arm - Ank/Smy but the Turkish trust I gained was worth it in the end.
<p>During 1909 in the south, I had to finish off Austria's Vienna and support
Turkey's two armies into Tri/Ser/Bul. My plan was to stretch Turkey’s armies
so they couldn't all be protected at once in 1910 (the projected solo year),
especially if I knew how they were moving as we were coordinating plans
against Italy and Austria.
<p>In the north, each turn I continued to send detailed plans for moves
that required me to remain in the North Sea and to help England from there.
North Sea supported England from Norway to Norwegian Sea and into Edi,
I arranged for my armies to tap French support where I could to help England
take Brest, and generally arranged for English fleets to keep heading for
the Med as much as I could saying he needed to take Iberia and get some
of the Italian spoils before Turkey got there. I had options to take Scandinavia
every turn, but suspected my French ally was lost forever at this stage
(he refused to respond to any mail - very poor diploming). The aim at this
point was to stab England when I ran out of excuses for having a fleet
in the North Sea.
<p>My biggest problem by 1909 was that I'd now grown to 11 SC’s whilst
the next biggest were sevens and fives. Lots of press to E and T saying how
I wanted the three-way, and expressing moral outrage regarding France (who
had kept attacking England and so not helping the AJA) and Italy (the AJA
stabber). I discussed how I wanted Paris and Vienna but nothing else, Mar
was English, Vienna was Turkish, etc, trying to reassure both countries
that I wasn't going to solo. Whilst I had the plan and the option, I still
didn't know I was going to go for it until a day before I did it. The plan
had been percolating in my head on how to do it since Sev was taken but
I wasn't sure I wanted to betray England who'd been a great ally (although
circumstance forced the alliance on him in some respects).
<p>In the north in Spring 09, a tricky situation had developed. We had
a French fleet in Yorkshire facing elimination between English fleets in
Lon and Edi with my fleet in North Sea having no reason to hang around
in the Fall if the elimination succeeded. I thought about a Fall stab,
but it would only have given me one centre or none (a convoy to Yorkshire?).
Counting SC's, I was only on 11, Scandinavia would take me to 14, Vie,
Tri and Ser 17. I needed Paris or an English mainland SC as Venice was
marginal and Gre and Bul were protected by fleets. It was still too early
to stab England.
<p>I submitted a plan where the English fleets kept barraging into the
Mao and Brest in a push for the other French centres, and where North Sea
was required to support the Edi fleet into Yorkshire, freeing England’s
London fleet for action to Wales / Channel and pushing the French Yorkshire
fleet to London and then out again. By then Liverpool and hopefully another
French SC would have been taken, leaving France on four or three. When England
agreed, I breathed a sigh of relief as the stab could be put off for another
year - when I’d be in a better position to take the other SC's, especially
Paris.
<p>The additional threat that year was the new French leader (the old French
leader having resigned - a second win!). I opened the comms line with some
alliance suggestions, telling him how vindictive the Englander was against
France. France really had no choice but to ally with England though - to
ally with Germany would have given me the Scandinavian centres immediately
to take me to 15 and I would have build fleets to come after France on
the English mainland.
<p>The big worry in the disbands phase of 1909 was what was France going
to disband. It had to be that fleet in Nao for my Belgium to Norway convoy plan
to work, otherwise my fleet would have had to go to Norwegian to bounce
him out of there - hence no convoy, no quick win. I sent some subtle suggestions
that we could work together again, mentioning possible bounces in the south
against that vindictive Englander that would help France survive and I
ignored mentioning Nao completely (being careful not to talk about builds
and disbands in the builds phase). I don't know if that had any influence
or not, but thankfully Nao was disbanded. I personally would have kept
it to try and get around into the English Scandinavian centres and have
England scurrying around after it.
<p>Not only did the 1909 moves have to ensure Belgium held so that he’d
be free for the Norway convoy, but I also had to ensure that Munich had
a reason to hold so that my army build at the end of the year had to happen
in Kiel to enable it to get to Sweden in two turns. England should probably
have insisted that Kiel was a no-build zone but I was lucky he never mentioned
it. I also had to ensure I could get Paris in Spring 1910 (with England's
Bre-Gas tap) to guarantee that 18th SC. If I didn't get Paris, I needed
Venice (unlikely with Italy’s two armies and fleet support), Bulgaria (impossible
with Turkish fleet support), Marseilles (impossible once a fleet got to
Lyons) or get armies around into Sev / Arm. Paris was critical.
<H3>1910 - The Solo Move</H3>
<p>In 1910, the North Sea again faced eviction - its job was done. I came
up with a plan to send it to Yorkshire to be eliminated in the Fall between
Edi and Lon and replaced with an army build. This appealed to England -
we'd been talking about how to get rid of my fleets for some years and
he jumped at the chance to eliminate it thinking he'd be safe from now
on. Any other move (back to Denmark, etc) endangered his Scandinavian SC's
and we both wanted a North Sea DMZ. I wouldn't allow him to take North
Sea to disband my fleet after all ! This plan had the side benefit of stranding
Edi and Lon in position, helpless - if England had come up with a plan
to protect Scandinavia from that turn on (Edi-Norwegian, Lon-Yor ?), I
would have been bounced from that final SC.
<p>In the south, Turkey was stretched and ripe for the plucking after he’d
chased the Italian centre of Trieste from Serbia.
<P><center><table border=5>
<caption><b>Position Going Into 1910</b></caption>
<tr><td><img src=map3.gif></td></tr></table></center>
<p>So from 12 centres, the solo move was launched:
<ul>
<li>Northern Spring: Belgium convoyed to Norway, Kiel to Denmark
<li>Northern Fall: Norway to Stp, Den to Swe, North Sea to Norway
<li>and all three Scandinavian centre were taken. (12 to 15 SC’s).
</ol>
<p>Paris was taken with armies as England tapped possible French support,
unaware of the Scandinavian stab. (16).
<p>In the south, Turkey had seen danger and tried to alleviate it by asking
for withdrawals. The agreed plan was that my Tyrolia would help Turkey
take Venice, that my Budapest would retreat and that my Rumania would bounce
over an empty Bulgaria with Turkey’s Serbia. That of course meant that
Rumania and Budapest were able to take Serbia (17) and Tyrolia and Vienna
take Trieste (18).
<p>In the Fall, I asked France to help me take Brest from England (as I
put it, in retaliation against England for letting me solo) and he agreed
(19) and I took a pot shot at Venice which worked as well (the 20th).
<p>The Wave Spring 1910 move was certainly one of the more satisfying of
my Diploming career!
<h3>
Summary - Players</h3>
To stop the win, I think the new France had to get more detailed with his
diploming against England when he started. Count out the SC's, show exactly
how I was going to win and force England into the alliance. As England
said to me in press in 1909/10, France offered alliance but there wasn't
anything in it for him. He probably needed to be offered Denmark, to build
and convoy armies into Scandinavia to get into Russia, etc, and show how
long term it was better even though he'd lose some SC's now. I was continually
getting England new SC's every turn - Edi, Liv, Brest, Iberia, etc, with
support from my armies. England had to be shown how the solo was going
to happen to turn him around.
<p>On the other hand, England knew he was playing riskily. I'd had so many
options to stab and never had and he was only one turn away from one of
my fleets being destroyed and being safe. We'd sent so much mail, and I
was attempting to alleviate his fears at every step and continually looking
out for his interests, that I understand why he wanted to continue against
France and go for the E-T-G three-way. Nonetheless, the big mistake was losing
sight of the actual board position and possibly being blinded by the E-G-T
picture I'd been drawing.
<p>An E-T-G three-way is not a natural three-way in many ways. Germany sits in
the middle begging to be squeezed in a two front war. I'd alleviated that
prospect by insisting on fleet builds but it was a long term concern. It
was interesting to see my goals shifted from survival to a F-G-I or F-G-T
three-way, to an E-G-T three-way with prospects for a solo, to a solo.
<p>I think it would have been difficult for Italy to see the stab coming.
When Turkey refused to stab Russia, Italy had no choice but to go after
Turkey. Italy’s mistake was to create too much mistrust with Turkey with
the peace plan and broken promises. If Italy'd managed to attack Turkey
without lying to him, then when it was clear I was starting to dominate
the board when Russia was broken, there should have been the possibility
of allying with Turkey and pressing me from the south. The mistrust probably
spoilt that chance and I always felt secure that once I allied with Turkey,
he would continue to go after Italy in vengeance and because he felt he
couldn't trust you.
<p>The original France suffered from lack of press and by not seeing the
game through his ally’s eyes, doing builds and moves that may have seemed
innocuous for France but were antagonistic to his ally (Germany).
<p>The various Austrian leaders played well in trying to get back to Austria
and build. They played consistently in Austria's best interests rather
than resorting to short term vengeance alliances. Unfortunately, they were
probably always doomed once Russia cracked quickly. Italy and I, and later
Turkey, would have cleaned them up no matter whether they kept true to
the AIG or not - it was just a matter of time. But by playing true to the
AIG they at least stayed in the game and had a chance of getting bigger
if Italy or Germany had been distracted elsewhere (by France say).
<p>To Turkey, probably the same mistake as England re actual board position.
Austria needed protection at the end to ensure I didn't have five armies
on two and there needed to be an insistence that Germany withdraw before
Turkish troops were stretched thin.
<p>Re the Russian leaders ... I found the first one taciturn, a bit arrogant,
demanding and generally a poor diplomer. Not a happy prospective ally.
The second probably needed to have communicated with everyone a bit more
to find out I had engineered an anti-Russian alliance, which may have led
him to not being as gullible.
<H3>Summary - Lessons</H3>
Wave is the game I've enjoyed diploming in most regardless of the victory
- because of the quality and high quantity of the press, the strengths
of the alliances, the cleanliness of the stabs and the fact that everyone
was playing rationally!
<p>The lessons I learnt or verified for myself is that the advice mentioned
at the start works. I had success leading the board, sent lots of press
to everyone, allies and enemies both, and tried to meet my allies’ objectives
with each plan I presented.
<p>Except at the end, I only ever had one enemy at a time, and that was
dictated by counting where my 18 SC’s would come from. I allied with England
because I could take the Scandinavian centres at any time. From France
I only needed two centres (Belgium and Paris) which could be got with English
help. I allied with Turkey over Italy as it meant I could get the Austrian
SC’s and half of the Balkan’ SC’s. Allying with Italy meant giving up some
of these. A lesson perhaps learnt by other players in all this was to see
the board as it actually is, not how its being diplomed.
<p>So whilst this wasn’t an expert’s showcase game, by illustrating an
ordinary game played by mere mortals, hopefully you’ll have found some
insights to enable you to improve against players of all kinds in the types
of games that we tend to play most.
<p>And finally a last thought ... I wonder what the previous two German
leaders who resigned before I joined would be thinking if they saw the
end result? A lesson that no position is unrecoverable!
