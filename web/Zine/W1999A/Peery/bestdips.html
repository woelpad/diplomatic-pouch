<H1 align=center>So Who Were The Greatest "Real" Diplomats<br>of the Last Millennium, Anyway?</H1>
<H2 align=center><i>by Larry Peery</i></H2>


    Several people responded to my query about who TDP readers thought
were the ten greatest "real" diplomats of the last millennium.  I
suggest you <a href=../Clarke/Deposits.html>read what they wrote</a>
before reading what I have to say.  I
was quite impressed with Dan Kirkwood's list, and it makes a good
jumping off point for our discussion. I definitely got a chuckle out of
Theo's rationale for picking Marco Polo as the greatest, and Chamberlain
as the worst, diplomat of the last millennium.
<P>
    Any list like this one, or the thousand others that appeared in
every newspaper, magazine, and web site last December; has to be very
subjective.  I know mine is.  After a few days of thought I narrowed my
choices down to 34 names (one for each SC on the board!).
From then on, it was mostly pick and choose.
You may or not agree with some of my choices, but I'm sure most of us
would agree on the core picks, and Dan did a good job of spotting most
of them.
<P>
    What I found even more interesting than picking the top ten names
was coming up with a criteria for selecting them, and a rationale for
including each of my choices on the list.  That took some thinking.
Also keep in mind that I'm an aging baby boomer from California who
studied political science, history, and religion in university oh,  so
many years ago!  And that's not to mention the influence 33 years of
playing Diplomacy has had on my thinking.
<P>
    Just what is a "real" diplomat?  To keep it as simple as I could I
classified them into three groups:
<ol>
<li>Rulers, such as monarchs or
presidents, who acted as their own foreign affairs department.  These
were the men, or women, who had a vision.
<li>Statesmen, such as foreign
ministers or secretaries of state (although sometimes private
individuals filled this role), who had a plan to achieve the ruler's
vision.
<li>Ambassadors, usually but not always ambassadors (official or
otherwise), who were the technicians that executed the plan that
achieved the vision.
</ol>
Originally, I had intended to include only people
from the third group on my list, but it is almost impossible not to
include the others.
<P>
    Note also how conveniently our three groups fit the traditional
division of diplomacy into its three branches, and the three
corresponding branches of Diplomacy:
<ol>
<li>vision/goal;
<li>plan/strategy;
<li>execution/tactics.
</ol>
<P>
    Traditionally, diplomats have dealt with each other as individuals,
as representatives of various official or unofficial governmental
institutions, or as representatives of a few powerful non-governmental
organizations.  Today, the emphasis is more and more on the first
(personal) and last (NGO) types of diplomacy.  Traditional foreign
ministers and secretaries often get left at home as their bosses go off
to conduct jet-setter diplomacy.
<P>
    Although there are some changes in the details: the rise of high
tech tools and weapons for the modern diplomat; the increasing focus on
economic issues; and the growing emphasis on "cyberspace" as the
diplomatic and military battleground; the basics really haven't changed
much.  Today we talk about Bill Gates' "cyberspace."  Two generations
ago it was Hitler's "living room."
<P>
    No matter how we classify it, or what we call it, we're dealing with
the struggle for order, the classic struggle between the "Old Order" and
the "New Order" that has paved the way to progress. And that deals with
war, peace, the status quo, change, expansion, contraction, and that
perennial favorite of every diplomat, "The Balance of Power."
<P>
    At its most basic, we are left with two groups: the builders and
the destroyers. Sometimes they represented the Old Order. Sometimes the
New. But each of my great diplomats was one or the other, and sometimes
both at the same time.
<P>
    And again, it's all about the struggle for bodies and space.  Sort
of reminds you of Diplomacy, huh?
<P>
    Looking back at the last thousand years I identified five major
events or periods which I consider to be critical moments in diplomatic
history.  Three of them: the Congress of Vienna, the Versailles peace
talks, and the founding of the United Nations; should be well known to
most of you, and the participants need no particular identification.
Suffice it to say that the subjects under discussion and the
participants in the talks were interesting enough to make our list.
<P>
    My fourth choice is really representative of a whole series of
events that came afterwards, usually attended by the same core group of
diplomats.  The founding of the ECSC (European Coal & Steel Community)
brought together France, Germany, and the BENELUX countries in a common
organization focusing on economic issues and one specific, solvable
problem.  It was the point of beginning for modern Europe, I think, and
it proved that men of peace could and would accomplish as much as men of
war.
<P>
    Finally, let's go back, way back -- almost to the half-millennium
point. For your consideration I offer what some consider the greatest
single concentration of high-minded diplomats in history, the early to
mid 1500s. Here were titans like: Francis I of France, Henry VIII of
England, Carlos I and V of Spain, Suleiman I of Turkey, Martin Luther,
Ivan IV of Russia, and Akbar of India.
What other period can compare with them?
<P>
    From my discussion you can see that I was looking for a diplomat who
was a builder, not a destroyer. One who possessed a dream, a plan, and
the skills to make it a reality. A man or a woman who knew the past, but
was prepared to face the uncertain future. And last, but not least, one
who could function equally as well as an individual or as an
institutional representative.
<P>
    Dan offered Bismarck pride of place on his list of ten, but where is
his banker, the guy who financed all of Bismarck's schemes?  I find it
interesting that Bismarck and Hitler, Dan's villain, were the only two
"commoners" on his list. All the others: Metternich, Talleyrand,
Nicchia, Elizabeth II, John Paul II, Frederick II, Meiji and William of
Orange were definitely, eventually from/of a higher strata.
<P>
    My list is a bit more eclectic than Dan's, and some of my choices
are clearly personal favorites of mine but, hey, it's my list!  So, here
goes.
<P>
    From early America I'd have to include Ben Franklin, Thomas
Jefferson, and John Adams. Without them, who knows what would have
happened to a very young and innocent United States of America?  Woodrow
Wilson had a vision and a plan of course, but his technique was
definitely faulty.  Still, not including him would be a bit like leaving
Jesus out of the New Testament.  The United States has been well served
in the last fifty years by a legion of skillful professional diplomats,
some high-minded and some not.  I'd include Henry Kissinger, as our
century's equivalent to Metternich and Talleyrand, but more for his
influence as a teacher and educator than as a practicing diplomat.
Madeleine Albright is everything a diplomat isn't supposed to be, and
yet has been remarkably successful during her service.
<P>
    Albright wasn't the only great female diplomat that came to mind.
In fact, a lot of them demand serious consideration for our list:
Isabella of Spain, who used her credit card with a bank in Siena to
finance Columbus's trips; Margarethe I, who created the Kalmar Union in
Scandinavia; Eleanor of Aquitaine; and, I think, I would include Mother
Teresa on my list as well.
<P>
    Although the pope may not have any legions, as some fool said, he
does have an army of nuncios and Jesuits deployed around the world.
They provide him with the world's best intelligence service, and that's
the key to his power. Was Pius XII Hitler's pope?  And what of Cardinal
Casaroli? Was he the engineer who bridged the gap between Paul VI and
John Paul II?
<P>
    On a more global peerispective, I'd include the following: Rama V,
the king of Thailand who kept his country out of the clutches of the
British and French empires; Ataturk, to bring Turkey into the modern
era; and from the WWII era I'd include Churchill and Smuts; with Tito,
Molotov and Stalin bringing us into the Cold War.  While you have to
link Molotov with Stalin; I don't think you have to link Chou En-lai
with Mao, so I won't.
<P>
    If you ran into me in Namur at this year's WDC, you probably know
who my choice for the "real" diplomat of the millennium is.  If you
didn't, you'll just have to wait until next time. It appears I'm out of
space for this issue.
<P>
    And the winner is......Manus Hand!
