<H1 align=center>If I Build It, Will They Use It?</H1>
<H2 align=center><i>by Larry Peery</i></H2>

    When DIPCON (the North American Diplomacy Championship) began a
third of a century ago no one expected it to become a Diplomacy hobby
institution.  After all, at that time, there was no organized hobby, let
alone any hobby institutions.  It was a diplomatic new world we were
creating. Even the BNC and GRAUSTARK were still new!
<P>
    Nobody bothered during those early years to keep track of what
happened at DIPCONS.  In fact, we were doing good to remember where they
had been held, or when, let alone who attended or what games were
played.  In fact, for at least the first five DIPCONS there were no
organized games. Mostly the guys sat around, played games, and drank
cheap beer.  How times have changed.
<P>
    By the time the first WORLD DIPCON rolled around in 1988, I was
determined that WDC would not suffer the same lack of attention to its
origin and early records.  Other people had the same idea, of course.  I
was just a bit more persistent about it.  As best I could I tried to
bring back from each WDC a collection of documents and memoribilia that
would provide both a record of the event, and give some idea of what its
flavor had been like.
<P>
    With two exceptions (III in Canberra and V in Paris) I have attended
all the WDC events, and today my Archives fills a dozen or so boxes.  At
first I had no plan for the stuff I had collected.  I  was just
collecting to be collecting.  But in the last few years it became clear
to me that this information belonged to the hobby and should be shared
with other WDC participants and Diplomacy fans.  But how?  The solution
has become clear to me over the last two years as I have created various
web sites, including one devoted to Diplomacy.
<P>
    The WDC deserved a web site of its own.
<P>
      I had hoped someone more skilled in the computer arts in the hobby
would step forward and create such a site, but I haven't seen one: at
least one on the scope I was thinking about.
<i>[Editor's note:  Larry's
experience trumps just about everyone's computer arts.  I wouldn't presume
otherwise, so I'll just stick to The Pouch. --Manus]</i>
So, over the past few
weeks I've been working to create such a site.

    You can visit it at
<a href=http://www.geocities.com/wdcshrine>http://www.geocities.com/wdcshrine</a>
<P>
    It's very much a work in progress.  I've tried to build a framework
structure to allow for future additions, as I've explained on the page.
Over the next two years I hope to add more items from my own Archives,
as well as contributions from other hobbyists. Naturally, if you
attended any of the earlier WDC events (especially III and V) I'd love
to hear from you.
<P>
    The WDC Shrine focus is on three areas:
	<ol>
	<li>Creating a permanent
record of past events;
<li> Establishing an information resource center
for future events; and
<li>Providing a venue for a discussion of the WDC
concept and events.</ol>  In time, it may be more than that, but for now I
think those are good areas to concentrate on.
<P>
    Pay us a visit soon, and come back often.  Who knows? You might find
your name in the Hall of Champions next time.
