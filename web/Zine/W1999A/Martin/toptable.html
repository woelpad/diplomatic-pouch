Martin On Diplomacy</H1>
<H2 align=center>I. The Top Table</h2>
<H3 align=center><i>By Chris Martin</i></H3>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p>I had the great pleasure of attending Diplonam in Namur, Belgium last
year. It was a tremendously fun event, with plenty of action and excitement.
But to me, the strangest thing was the idea of a “Top Table”. I had
been told about it, but seeing it in action was a whole different experience.
I thought I'd take a short moment to explore the idea behind it, and see
why it is used in Europe, and not in the USA. One of my personal
difficulties with the world hobby at the moment is the lack of uniformity
in the way that tournaments are run, and it is my hope that through an
examination of the differences, and the reasons for them, we might come
a little closer together.
<p>The idea of a Top Table in a tournament is a simple one. Whatever
scoring system is used, the players with the seven best scores before the final
round are placed on one board, where they fight it out. Additionally,
in the system popular in Europe now, the top three places in the tournament
are reserved for the “winners” of the top table.
<p>Lets look at an example of a tournament with a top table.
<p>Going into the final round of RebelCon, 100 players have finished two
full games. Adam, Bob, Chris, Dave, Ellen, Frank, and Greg have the
best seven scores. They proceed to play the final round as normal, but
instead of being assigned boards randomly they play each other. The
other 93 people in the tournament are assigned their final round boards,
according to whatever system RebelCon is using. They know that
the best they can do, in the Overall Rankings of this tourney, is 4th place.
<p>In fact, with most scoring systems, someone not on the top table <i>will</i>
get 4th place!
<p>The scoring system for RebelCon will be as follows:
<p>Points are awarded on final centre count when time is called – no additional
points will be given for survivals or draws. (This is a very European
system, by the way.)
<ul>
<li>
Best result on board: 50 points</li>
<li>
2nd best result on board: 24 points</li>
<li>
3rd best result on board: 11 points</li>
<li>
4th best result on board: 5 points</li>
<li>
Bonus for Solo victory:  25 points</li>
</ul>
(Yes, very simple. Yes, not really a good system. But hey, it's just used to
illustrate a larger point.)
<p>At the end of two rounds of play, we have the following results for
the top ten:

<p>Round three begins, and the top seven players are all on the same board, while
Harry, Ivan, and Janet all (through a random allocation) end up on different
boards.
<p>Well, the going is tough on the top board, but after a hard fight, Chris
has nine centres (1st place), Ellen has seven (2nd), Frank has six (3rd), Bob has
four (4th), Dave and Greg each have three – Adam (being a target going in) was
eliminated. On the other boards, Harry finished first on his board, Ivan
finished second, and Janet got a solo victory

<p>*You will remember that these three places were reserved for the Top Table,
regardless of overall points!
<p>Ok. So we have the results, and we have the scores. Let's
take a look at things, and see what this tells us.
<p>If you go by scores alone, the rankings end up being very, very different.
Ellen, in 2nd place, drops to 5th. Frank, in 3rd place, goes all
the way down to a tie for 8th! Janet gets 2nd, and Harry 3rd.
What's up with that?!?
<p>The theory, if I understand it correctly, is that the quality of opposition
on the top board is guaranteed to be high. Coming in second
on the "Top Board" is worth more than the same result on any other board,
and there is, I think, some merit to this. Most competitive events work
on the basis that, in the later rounds of the event, the more successful
players will face off against the better players, while the less successful
ones will then play each other. This helps to ensure that no one
gets an easy trip to a high ranking.
<p>How So? In a tournament of any size, there will be:
<ul>
<li>People who are trying out the game for the first time,
<li>People who played in the past and want to play again,
<li>People who have been playing with the local club for a year or three,
<li>Players who do well with country A, C, and E, are ok with Country
F and G, but can't play country B or D to save their life, and,
<li>Sharks. The people who go to Diplomacy Tournaments regularly
with the intention of bloody well winning them I don't care give me Italy
let's <i>go</i>, thank you very much!
</ul>
<p>The Top table will probably have people from categories D and E on it.
Other tables will have the regular mix. So getting that solo victory
on a regular table, while impressive, just isn't as impressive as ending
on nine centres as Austria on the top table! (According to Top Table Theory,
mind you.)
<H3>Ok, That Makes Sense</H3>
There are other advantages to a Top Table. In theory, and this
has happened in the past, a club/group could come to a tournament with
a “champion”.
<p>A Champion?  Yes.
Let's take a look at a fictional scenario. The Arlington Beer
and Dagger Society has decided, as a group, to win RebelCon. Fourteen of
the club members make the trip to Raleigh, North Carolina, and they have
decided that they are going to make Richard Timson the champ. So,
whenever any of them are on a board with him, they will do everything they
can to make him the winner – nothing too obvious, but when it comes time
to stab, he somehow gets all their centres. On other boards, they
play not to win, but to force draws – always ganging up on any leaders,
preventing anyone from getting points. There are 49 people at the con,
seven boards, and the AB&amp;DS members are a significant percentage.
At the end of the weekend, Surprise! Richard has the best score.
The AB&amp;DS laugh all the way home, and next tournament it'll be Morris
Stevens who gets to be champ. Meta-gaming, and I highly approve of it,
in spirit. (In the next installment of Martin On Diplomacy -- slated for the
next Pouch issue -- I will discuss how I feel about playing to win
the tournament, not an individual tournament game!)
<p>But purists cry out, "No fair! I am a better player, but
I cannot win against these allies who are allied before the game begins,
regardless of diplomacy and board position! That's just <i>wrong</i>!"
And indeed, no one could beat them – with regular scoring systems.
The Top Table neatly solves this problem, by forcing Richard to actually
beat six other players’ – six really good players’ -- heads up.
It'll be a lot harder for the AB&amp;DS force a winner when they can't use all
fourteen players to affect the final round! This is, in
<br>fact, one of the principle reasons the Top Table was created in the
first place.
<H3>Okay. What Else is Good About a Top Table?</H3>
<p>Then there is the Excitement factor.  Who will be on the Top Table this
year? Before WDC9, the speculation was rampant – how many players
would the French have in the final running? Would an American be
able to get on the top table, much less win it if they got there?
Who are the "dark horses" who could surprise everyone? Don't forget
the Swedes! Can't win if you aren't on the Top Table!
<p>At the tournament itself, tension mounted as the rounds went by, as
people with good scores desperately hung on to try to get better scores
to make the final table. Stabs in the last season made and broke
championship dreams! Players who had results that wouldn't allow them to
make the top table rooted for their friends and fellow countrymen, as they
played the penultimate round. (Everyone knew that you could still
finish a very respectable fourth place, if only you could do well in the
final round.) Seven players on the top board, and at least three of them
would end up dropping out of the top five!
<p>The seasonal results from the Top Table were posted on a <i>huge</i> board,
so that everyone could come and see who was doing what, during furtive
breaks from their own final games. The tension was palpable as they
went into the final year of the game, and four players were still in the
running! Christian Dreyer pulled it off, at the wire and by <i>one</i> centre!
Beer for everyone!
<p>There is no comparison in tournaments that don't have a top table.
After the final round Sunday, everyone has a good idea who has won it;
it's a simple matter of making announcements, handing out plaques, and
modest applause.
<H3>So Why Doesn't Every Tournament Use a Top Table?</H3>
<p>Now, in all fairness, there are plenty of good, solid reasons why tournaments
in the United States and England don't (as a rule) use a top table.
They like to play longer games, with fewer rounds. In the U.S., at least,
they like to give everyone a fighting chance right up until the very end.
It is hard for people to make every round of a Fri/Sat/Sun convention.
Some people might not play the last round if they know they can't win
the tournament.  Valid objections all.
<p>Longer games mean fewer games, and that means it's harder to tell at
the end of the penultimate round who the best seven players are.
Everyone knows that the random selection of players on a board and powers
has an effect on the outcome. In the end, the cream tends to rise
to the top, but do you really get the seven best at the end of two rounds?
<P>
I think what you get is the seven best of those two rounds. Everyone
knew going in what the stakes were, and had equal chances to get there.
Its easy to argue that the seven people on the top table weren't the best seven
people at WDC9 – in fact those seven did not place 1st through 7th – but
they had the best seven scores going into the final round, and no one can argue
that.
<p>I've noted (and used to my advantage) a tendency to drop the worst score
from a three or four round tournament, or to only count the two best scores.
The theory being, I think, that people who can only make two rounds have
the chance to win as well – something they wouldn't have if there was a
top table. This is a serious consideration – you don't want to exclude
people who can't take Friday off of work to get to the convention in time
to play Friday night. The distances involved in the U.S. make it hard
to rush off to a weekend tournament. This is a good argument against
a top table in a tournament that only has three rounds in it -- one game Friday,
one Saturday, and one Sunday. This probably happens most often when
the time limit on games is long or nonexistent. But many tournaments
could have a game Saturday night as well, which would allow everyone at
least two good chances to make the top table Sunday. Also, when I
competed for the WDC in Chapel Hill in 1998, I didn't play in the last
round because it would have hurt my chances of winning – how is a system
that encourages a player <i>not</i> to play better than one which has
potential rewards for everyone who plays every round?
<p>Plenty of people feel for Janet (remember the example above?) – who,
with a solo victory in the final round, scores points to get to second place,
but has to go home with fourth. It has happened (in Europe) that the
person who won a tournament had fewer points than the person who finished
fourth. Most scoring systems at tournaments that use a top table reflect
and minimize this possibility.
<p>Would Janet really have stuck around to play the last round, knowing
she couldn't win? I'd like to think so. Most people going into
the final round of a tournament can't win – it's the nature of tournaments
that there will be three people from every board who score points, and really
only two of them score points that will probably count in the end.
So why don't four or five people drop out from every board after every round?
Because Diplomacy is a fun game, because they came a long way to play,
and don't get to play a lot
of FTF, because you can always get the satisfaction of a great result
even without winning the whole shebang! There are always “Best County”
awards to play for, as well as the other awards that each tournament has
to reward spectacular play which doesn't make it to the finals.
<H3>Top Tables are Elitist</H3>
Yes, only the best players get there. But
isn't that the point of a Tournament? To find out who, on this day,
is the best player in the room?
<P>
Hmm, Chris. It seems you approve of the idea, then?
Yes.  Yes, I do.  I would really like to see major U.S. tournaments try
the idea on, if
just for size. The advantages seem clear. Results are determined
in a fair and unbiased way, with luck having as little to do with the final
results as possible. Outside manipulation of the scoring system would
be much more difficult. The excitement generated by the Top Table
would be an excellent addition to any tournament. It would bring
the World Hobby a little closer together in the way Diplomacy is played,
at conventions anyway, and maybe then we can work on establishing a regular
time limit for tournament play, instead of the mish-mash of systems we
have now! But that, I think, is another article for another day!
