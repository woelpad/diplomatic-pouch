<p><IMG SRC="./milanmap.png"BORDER=0 ALT="Milan Variant map" ALIGN="LEFT" VSPACE="10" HSPACE="10">The one and only “extension set”
for my <i>Olde Faithful</i> Dip board. The
game is the same, but the map
starts slightly differently to the
regular game, as shown with the
cardboard overlay to the left. I
made seven of these (when first
playing this variant by post) and
sent one to every player. One day
I hope to see this as the standard
map at a f-t-f Dipcon!</p>

<p>These articles were not supposed to touch on Dip variants, but this is the one true variant
which I believe balances the entire game. The Ven-Tri option has now gone, but the Tyrolian
Attack (Rom-Ven, Ven-Tyr) is still available, as is the Munich grab. Key to this variant is the
fact that there are now two French provinces (Bur & Mar) which can be entered from (now)
Savoy. And with Rome being adjacent to GOL, a new fleet there has additional options.</p>

<p>Simply put, this variant prevents France from being the almighty great and powerful one.
And this new alignment of power has a balancing ripple effect across the entire board.</p>

<p>As far as variants go, this really pushes my buttons. It opens up strategy and Diplomacy for
all Great Powers and starts the game in a more balanced fashion for all seven players.</p>

<p>The only time I played this variant was by post (in Brian Frew’s <u><i>Veni Vidi Vici</i></u>). England won
the game. Maybe this variant helps England too much? But the truth is that in that game
Italy did “<b>too many clever things in 1901</b>”. He opened Mil-Tyr, Rom-Sav and grabbed both
Mar and Vie in Fall 1901. Is it any wonder that my England got an easy ride thereafter?</p>

<p>Alternative variants of this game start before 1901; whereby all Great powers discuss with
Italy what choice of unit they should have in Rome. But I view this option as a little too anti-
France; le hexagon is already crippled enough by the Sav / Bur / Mar boundary change.</p>
