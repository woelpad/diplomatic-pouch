<p>Over time and a bit flimsy on the outside. And yet I'm extremely upbeat about this issue in terms of contents. We've taken on some big projects that are gradually coming to fruition.</p>

<p>We have finally started to publish Larry Peery's monumental series on Austria and Germany, something he had announced at the very start of the year. Larry's focus is in particular on the smaller partner in the <i>gro&szlig;deutsche L&ouml;sung</i>. Especially on Vienna, as you will come to discover in the next issues, although he also admits an uninhibited amount of admiration for Angela Merkel, the current <i>Bundeskanzler</i> of Germany.</p>

<p>Furthermore this issue sees the launch of what I plan to be a regularly recurring puzzle corner based on the Last Man Standing formula. If Chess derives part of its popularity from the seemingly inexhaustible amount of checkmate problems and Go from a similar amount of life-and-death problems, there's good hope that LMS might do the same to the popularity of Diplomacy. The key is to reach a critical mass, both in terms of volume and in terms of exposure to the public. We're aiming high.</p>

<p>The cool thing is that LMS has inspired me to adapt the DPjudge to be used for single player games. This was possible before if you made all powers dummies and took the time to log in to every power separately. The improvement I made is to allow everything to be controlled from the Master page, with no need to log in to other powers. This is a nice example of how the Zine drives development of the Judge, when the latter has previously inspired many an article in the Zine. This in turn illustrates why it's beneficial to have both on the same site, even when they are perfectly capable to stand on their own.</p>
 
<p>Since I can pick the theme (or label) for this issue, let it be drive. The drive to write the stories that pique your interest, to teach others the lessons of a lifetime, or to do the things that you think will make a difference. In each of the endeavors on these pages, it feels like there are sparks flying off, if you get my drift. You did? See the pun?</p>

<p>And where is SHCD, you might ask? Well, Dr. Watson's taking an unplanned furlough. But he's sure to come back and finish his story. <i>If</i> he can get over the fact that his best friend appeared in a rival magazine. No matter how hard we try to assure him that it's a great publicity stunt, the good doctor still believes it's an act of betrayal. Let him get over it or we might be forced to contract Holmes for the sequel.</p>

<h3>Enjoy the Pouch!</h3>
