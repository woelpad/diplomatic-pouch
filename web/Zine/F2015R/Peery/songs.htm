<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>This story is part of a series commemorating the 100th Anniversary of World War I that has appeared in previous issues of  <u><i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i></u> and <u><i>Diplomacy World</i></u>.  If the <a href="../../S2015M/Peery/cartoons.htm">Newspaper Editorial Cartoons from World War 1</a> article was a case of “show and see”; then this is a story of “show and hear.”</p>
<p>This article consists of four sections:</p>
<ol type="n">
<li>My background; If you already know something about my personal background you can skip this section. If you don’t it may help you understand my peerispective on what follows.</li>
<li>"Songs of the First World War”; Refer to  Wikipedia for the complete article. A brief back-ground history of the songs of the First World War including a short-list of popular favorites.</li>
<li>"Songs of World War 1”; Refer to  Wikipedia and YouTube for the complete list, this is an extensive, but by no means complete  list of songs about World War 1, both pro and con. The emphasis is on YouTube links to recordings of many of the songs.</li>
<li>“World War 1 Anti-War Songs”: Refer to Wikipedia for the complete list; this is a list of anti-war songs about World War 1 that includes songs written during and even after the War and a wide variety of composers and performers. I tried to pick a variety of songs and focused on the background of the songs, composers and conductors. Most of these are listed in the third section with links to their YouTube videos.</li>
</ol>
<p>This article does not contain a lot of original material since most of that is a matter of public and historical record. What it is is a guide to some online and other resources pertaining to the subject.
Read, Listen, Reflect, Enjoy.</p>

<h1>My Background</h1>

<p>I’m a “hawk” and a” dove,” or a “warmonger” and a “Peacenik.”  I’m also a “baby boomer’ which may explain the contradiction between first two.</p>

<p>I was born just after the end of WWII when kids lived in a world of “duck and cover” and Monday- at noon- tests of the local air raid alarm systems that covered entire cities.</p>

<p>In junior high I was enrolled in the Junior ROTC program because, well, that was the thing to do.  I vaguely remember something called “The Bay of Pigs Invasion,” but it sounded like a joke to me.</p>

<p>Then in high school I was enrolled in the regular Junior ROTC program. I enrolled because it was also the thing to do. I really only remember five things about those years:</p>

<ol type="n">
<li>Learning to fire a real gun; It was an old WWII-era Carbine in an indoor firing range, but it was my first time firing a weapon.</li>
<li>My fellow students and how seriously some of, but not all of them took the course --- especially the cadet officers who spent hours cleaning and polishing their uniform and brass so they could impress the most popular girls in the class.</li>
<li>My instructors: Two WWII vets named Kaltenbach and Musbach who wore a sergeant first class uniform while on their ROTC instructor assignment, but a USA LTC (Reserve) uniform at their retirement ceremonies.</li>
<li>The pictures on the ROTC classroom wall ranging from the President, Secretary of the Army, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Chief of Staff, Sixth Army Commander, Regional officer in command of Army ROTC, and my instructor. The switch from B&W to color photos was a big deal.</li>
<li>I was told that my three years in the program would pay off if I had to join the Army. I would go in as a PFC instead of just a Private. In College I went through the Air Force ROTC program.</li>
<li>In October 1962 the Cuban Missile Crisis: I remember watching the convoy of hundreds of vehicles filled with thousands of Marines roll down the I-5 freeway heading from Camp Pendleton to their ships at the San Diego Navy Station. A few hours later I saw three B-47 bombers with their bomb-bay doors closed sitting at the end of the runway at San Diego’s Lindbergh Field waiting for an order that never came.</li>
<li><p>In June 1963 the visit of President John F. Kennedy to San Diego. I was part of the ROTC honor guard greetings the Commander-in-Chief when he arrived at San Diego State College to receive the first doctorate awarded by any California State University. 37,000 people packed the 18,000 seat stadium to see and listen to him. The parade route from the airport to the stadium was 22 miles long and people stood 3-deep along the whole route; and this in one of the nation’s most Republican cities.</p>
<p>Here’s a historical video of his visit to San Diego:</p>
<p>JFK'S VISIT TO SAN DIEGO (JUNE 6, 1963)</p>

<p>At 5:00 into the tape notice the reference to Crawford High School’s band. That’s my school. Also note the 30 cents a gallon for gas on the station signs. At about 10:00 into the film you’ll see the Air Angels helping Kennedy put on his gown and then the USAF ROTC honor guard. Three years later I’d be a member of that group. At 27:00 note the list of past American wars that Kennedy rattles off. No reference to Cuba or Vietnam yet.</p></li>
<li>In November 1963 the assassination of the President. Anyone old enough to remember has a story to tell about where they were and what they were doing when the heard the news that Kennedy had been assassinated in Dallas. I was in the school newspaper office when I heard the news on my new transistor radio. I went and told my ROTC instructor who went to tell the school principle while several of us changed into our uniforms. When he came we got into formation, marched over to the school flag pole and lowered the flag to half-mast while nearly three thousands of our classmates gathered, many of them crying. These were the same students that had voted something like 80-8 in favor of Nixon in a straw-poll in in their history class a few years before.</li>
</ol>

<p>Time passed. A lot of time. More than fifty years to be exact, but don’t let them kid you --- the passing of time doesn’t heal all wounds. It makes some of them worse.</p>

<p>It was only a few days ago while looking  at the invitation to my 50th high school reunion , my high school year book and the list of members of my class who are already gone; when I realized something that profoundly shocked me. In fact, I’m still in a state of shock. Not one of the Junior Army ROTC cadets from junior or senior high school died in Vietnam, but several of my non-ROTC classmates who served in the Army or Marines were killed on the ground in Vietnam.</p>

<p>In College I went through the Air Force ROTC program.</p>

<p>As I thought about that I thought about my experiences a few years later with the Air Force. There were about 90 of us in my AFROTC detachment at San Diego State. Those who completed the four year program mostly went on to careers as pilots and navigators because that’s what the AF needed at the time. Other specialties, such as intelligence, were only tolerated on an as needed basis. It took me almost 20 years and some FOIA requests and some arm-bending by friends in Washington to learn first the simple fact that nearly half of those 90 young men had died in or as a result of their Vietnam experiences. It took me even longer to get the Air Force to admit that over half of those casualties were due to “friendly” fire, not enemy action. And my unit was fairly typical for what was going on all through the air forces during the Vietnam War.</p>

<p>While I was studying the Russian language, Russian history, Russian government, Russian civilization and the Russian military as part of my political science/history/AFROTC program; Rod Walker was teaching prospective Air Force launch officers the ins and outs of launching a Minuteman missile; and Walt Buchanan was a gunnery officer aboard the aircraft carrier USS Ticonderoga on Yankee Station off the coast of North Vietnam. Among his responsibilities was caring for the one nuclear weapon on board the ship. Even he didn’t know what the SIOP had planned for the weapon but speculation included:</p>

<ol type="n"> 
<li>Taking out Hanoi; </li>
<li>Taking out the Hoa Binh Dam; </li>
<li>Bombing Hong Kong (even though it was a British possession at the time), Guangzhow (the former Canton), or Nanning. The A-3 Skywarriors in their strategic bomber configuration could even have made it to Beijing; and then, hopefully, a friendly base in South Korea or Japan.</li>
</ol>

<p>I was told that my three years in the program would pay off if I had to join the Army. I would go in as a PFC instead of just a Private. In College I went through the Air Force ROTC program&#8230;</p>

<p>Nine years during the most formative years of my life: call it patriotic indoctrination or brain-washing as you will. The end result was the same --- a very intellectually aware but emotionally confused person.
On the other hand, my experiences as a dove were definitely more limited.</p>

<p>I remember&#8230;</p>

<ul>
<li>&#8230; listening to Eleanor Roosevelt say “The US spends 1% of its “peace budget” on the UN in 1960&#8230;.</li>
<li>&#8230;listening to Colonel Irving Salomon talk about his WWII experience as a member of George Marshall’s staff and then, as a UN diplomat, with Eleanor Roosevelt dreaming up the idea of the Peace Corps&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230;listening to Nobel Peace Prize recipient Philip Noel-Baker describe a march by 250,000 mothers and children in prams through London and how disappointed they were that the Queen refused to come out on the balcony of Buckingham Palace to acknowledge their presence&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230;listening as Nobel Prize winners Linus Pauling and Harold Urey; and Jonas Salk debated the pros and cons of The Vietnam War with a bunch of noisy university students in the Salk Institute cafeteria; after which the doctors paid for the students drinks&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230;the  anti-war protests of the Vietnam War at San Diego State in the ‘60s attracted a few hundred anti-war protestors compared to the hundreds of active duty and ROTC cadets on campus. In comparison, a student protest over the raising of parking fees attracted 7,000 students in 1965&#8230;.</li>
<li>&#8230;watching as a sole kayaker used the rules of navigation to attempt to block the USS Kitty Hawk as it sailed into San Diego harbor, until a Coast Guard patrol boat chased it away&#8230;</li>
<li>&#8230;a few years ago  I remember  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton say that all the peace programs of the USA (including the State Department, AID, Peace Corps, etc.) received 10% of the funding the military got. I was surprised to hear it was that high&#8230;</li>
</ul>

<h2>And now it’s time to face the music</h2>

<p>Marches and marching songs go back as long as armies and wars have existed.  In the early days they were used to rouse enthusiasm among the troops and civilian population.  Pro and anti-war songs are of more recent  origin. By the time of the Boer War most war songs were used to incite the soldiers to glorious deeds.  By the time of the First World War, however, the most popular songs, like “Keep the Home Fires Burning” and “I Didn’t Raise My Boy to be a Soldier,” concentrated on the longing for home. Interestingly, during World War II the most popular songs were those written during and after WWI that expressed that longing for home.</p>

<p>But what of WWI?</p>

<h1>Songs of the First World War</h1>

<p>Refer to the complete article by this title in Wikipedia.</p>

<p>The  music of World War I is the music which was composed during the war or which is associated with it.
The article discusses the importance of music halls in the origins and popularity of “pro” WWI songs and why “anti-war” songs were rarely performed in them.</p>

<p>Popular patriotism and an enthusiasm for the war soon gave way to a universal desire to “be home again,” as the tenor of songs changed from the enthusiastic and bellicose to the reflective and melancholy.
Anti-war songs in or out of the music halls did not do well for two reasons: they were truly unpopular with the audiences and they were unprofitable to the hall owners.</p>

<p>It’s ironic that some of the most popular and best songs written about WWI have been written several generations after the fact; perhaps because the horrors of modern war were too terrible to contemplate and it was easier for the composer or artist to help soften their impact by placing their songs in a WWI setting rather than a Vietnam, Iraq or Afghani setting.</p>

<p>Among the most popular of recent WWI songs were “Butcher’s Tale (Western Front 1914)”, a 1967 song by The Zombies, “And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda” from 1972 by Australian-born folk singer Eric Bogle. “No Man’s Land” (also known as The Green Fields of  France and Willie McBride), another 1976 song by Eric Bogle. “Christmas in the Trenches,” written in 1984 by John McCutcheon. “Children’s Crusade,” a 1985 song by Sting. “All Together Now,” from 1990 by The Farm.”1916,” written in 1991 by the group Motorhead. and “Paschendale,” from 2003 by Iron Maiden.</p>

<p>All through the First World War the most popular musical instrument was the human voice; and since gramophones were so expensive and most homes already had an upright piano of some kind; songs were spread by sheet music produced by hundreds of producers working in a four square block area of New York City. A single song usually filled a title page, two pages of music, and a back page ad that often contained a page from another popular hit of that company. Individual copies sold for from 15 cents to, rarely, as much as 50 cents. A very popular tune could sell as many as 500,000 copies and go through as many as ten re-printings over several years. The most popular music hall singers and gramophone recording artists could command fees as high as the most popular opera singers of the day. Only one singer of the time, John McCormack, managed to be a mega-star on both the music hall and opera stages; and attract crowds of tens of thousands to outdoor concerts and war bond rallies across the nation. Fifty thousand people turned out to hear him sing in front of Union Station in Kansas City. Thirty thousand turned out to hear him sing at the Spreckles Organ I San Diego. Even Caruso could not draw these kinds of crowds.</p>

<h1>Songs of World War I</h1>

<p>Keep in mind that at the time of WWI there were still hundreds of thousands of Civil War and Spanish-American War vets alive with their own war stories to share with their children and grand-children who were being mobilized by the millions to fight in “The War to End Wars.” The United States mobilized 4,734,991 forces in World War I. 116,516 were killed or died, and 204,002 were wounded, prisoners or missing. That simple statistic explains the popularity of one of the first true anti-war songs, “I Didn’t Raise My Son to Be a Soldier.”
Keep in mind that songs of World War I cover four distinct periods: </p>
<ol type="n">
<li>The period prior to the entry of the United States into the War,</li>
<li>The period from the entry of the USA into the War to the arrival of US forces in Europe,</li>
<li>The period from the beginning of US direct involvement in the conflict to the Armistice, and</li>
<li>The period from the Armistice until the last Americans were brought home after the conflict.</li>
</ol>

<p>There were literally thousands of songs written during and about WWI performed by hundreds if not thousands of performers in music halls, churches, bond rallies and on gramophone recordings. Both the British Library and Library of Congress in the USA have made extensive efforts to find, record and publish these songs. Much of their work is in the public domain and available online.</p>

<p>The following samples are drawn from Wikipedia, where you can find out more about them. Where recordings (audio or video) are available on YouTube I have so indicated. A “+” in front of the song indicates it was a “standard” of the day. Songs recorded by popular artists often become popular favorites almost over-night as they spread from the music halls to sheet music to families singing gathered around the upright or player piano.</p>

<h1>Anti-war songs</h1>

<p>An anti-war song can fall into one or more of the following categories: 1) it clearly indicates it is anti-war, 2) popular or critical opinion identifies it as being or having an anti-war theme, or 3) it advocates universal peace.</p>

<p>Anti-war songs can do a variety of things: 1) They can comment on the aspects of war, 2) They can satirize war, 3) They can promote peace, 4) They can object to a specific war (such as WWI), a specific battle (such as “Paschendale”), a specific location (such as Belgium, “the trenches,” or Picardy), or even a specific weapon (such as tanks or barbed wire). 5)  They can sing about the physical, psychological or emotional damage wars cause to active, passive or even indifferent participants. </p>

<p>Anti-war songs are generally considered songs of protest and some have been </p>adopted as anthems by various peace movements, activists and causes (“Ban the Bomb”) of one kind or another.</p>

<h2>World War I Anti-War Songs</h2>

<p>It may seem strange that  anti-war songs about World War I were being written a hundred years or four or five generations after the event. Yet the importance of WWI as a symbol (Remember, it evolved from The Great War, The War to End All Wars, to World War I within a generation.) was so great that it stood as a representative icon for any and all wars, both past and present.</p>

<p>The following list of WWI anti-war songs is notable for the span of time it covers, the diversity of its sources, composers and performers; and the while variety of musical styles and instrumentations used.
All of these samples are discussed at length and in more or less detail in Wikipedia and elsewhere and, again, many of them can be found on YouTube, in national archives and other public sources, and even on commercial recordings still available.</p>

<ul>
<li>"1916" – Motorhead (1991) This heavy metal group was inspired by the Battle of the Somme</li>
<li>“1917” – Performed by Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris in 1999</li>
<li>“The Accrington Pals” – Written and performed by British composer and folk singer Mike Harding in 1984, this is a song about a group of British soldiers.</li>
<li>“All Quiet on the Western Front” – Written and performed by Elton John and Bernie Taupin in 1982 this is a good example of a song that was inspired by a contemporary event (The Falkland’s Conflict” but named for a historical one. The song was only performed once live and was not a commercial success.</li>
<li>“All Together Now” – The Farm (1990)</li>
<li>“And The Band Played Waltzing Matilda” – Eric Bogle (1972)</li>

<li>“Butcher’s Tale (Western Front 1914)” – The Zombies (1968)</li>
<li>“Cenotaph” – This Heat (1981) The Cenotaph is Britain’s memorial to its war dead.  Unlike the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in the United States which has remains of “unknown servicemen” from WWI, WWII, Korea and Vietnam in it, the Cenotaph is an “empty tomb.”</li>
<li>“Children’s Crusade” – Sting (1985) This was Sting’s first solo album for which he wrote and performed this song.</li>
<li>“Christmas 1914” – Mike Harding (1977)
<li>“Christmas in the Trenches” – John McCutcheon (1984)
<li>“Decades” – Joy Division (1980)</li>
<li>“Don’t Sign Up For War” – Alistair Hulett and Dave Swarbrick</li>
<li>“Don’t Wake The Lion – (Too Old To Die Young)” – Magnum (1985)</li>

<li>“Harry Farr” – Stray (2009)</li>
<li>”Harry Pitch (In Memory Of)” – Radiohead (2009)</li>
<li>“I Didn’t Raise My Boy To Be a Soldier” – Peerless Quarter (1914) The Peerless Quartet was a popular four-voice male quartet of the time that performed and recorded many of the anti-war songs of the day.
<li>“It Could Happen Again” – Collin Raye (1996)</li>
<li><p>“Johnny Johnson (musical) –Was a 1936 musical with a book and lyrics by Paul Green and music by the classical, stage and song composer Kurt Weill. It is based on one of the first pieces of anti-war literature, Jaroslav Hasek’s satiric novel “The Good Soldier Svejk.; which was published in 1923.</p>
<p>At almost the same time (1933) Sergei Prokofiev was composing music for the 1934 Soviet film Lieutenant Kije  based on the novel of the same title by Yury Tynyanov. A popular suite based on that movie score premiered in Paris in 1937 and was later made into a ballet.</p>
<p>The question; which I have been unable to answer; is were Weill (born in Germany and moved to the United States in 1933) and Prokofiev (born in Russia, allowed to emigrate after The Revolution, but returned to Russia in 1936) aware of each other’s work or did they ever meet. There’s no proof of this but there does exist a 1943 letter from Prokofiev sending greetings to American composers supporting a petition supporting Weill’s claim that he had no nationality but had been born in Germany. Based on the fact that both were internationally famous Jewish composers, although Prokofiev was gay and Weill was not (or he hiding very well behind the skirts of his famous singer and wife Lotte Lenya), it seems certain they were aware of each other’s work even if they never physically met in their comings and goings,</p></li>

After evacuation to Egypt the troops were retrained before being shipped to England and then on to France for combat beginning in 1916. Later forces arriving from Australia and New Zealand, including a camel corps, were used in Egypt, Palestine and Mesopotamia.
<li>“Northwinds” – The Stranglers (1984)</li>
<li>“Nuclear” – Mike Oldfield (2014)</li>
<li>“Oh, What a Lovely War! (musical)” – Joan Littlewood (1963). This musical was inspired by a BBC radio documentary on WWI that was an ironic commentary on the war that included tunes based on songs found in a 1917 book called “Tommy’s Tunes” which had new lyrics written to well-known songs of the time, including hymns and tunes from west end shows. The author’s purpose, she said, “was to have people leaving the theater laughing at the vulgarity of war.”</li>
<li>"Paschendale" – Iron Maiden (2003) This was a progressive rock song performed by a heavy   metal band that quoted from Wilfred Owen’s “Anthem for Doomed Youth.”</li>
<li>“The Price Of A Mile” – Sabaton (2008)</li>
<li>“The Red Clydesiders” – Alistair Hulett and Dave Swarbrick”</li>
<li>“The Rose of York” – Ken Thompson and Lesley Hale</li>
<li>“Scream Aim Fire” – Bullet For My Valentine (2007)</li>
<li>“Some Mother’s Son” – The Kinks (1969) An interesting story by Ed Masley in The Republic         (azcentral.com, May 24, 2014) called “How the Kinks wrote the perfect Memorial Day song” tells the story of how this universal song of mourning was written by a Brit (Ray Davies) in 1969. It was the quintessential anti-war song. The article includes the complete lyrics to the song.</li>
<li>“Snoopy’s Christmas” – The Royal Guardsmen (1967) managed to combine a kid’s story, a real historical event, a Christmas song, an upbeat song and an anti-war song into one.</li>
<li>“The Soldier’s Sweetheart” – Jimmy Rodgers (1927) The singer was a well-known and popular country singer  nearly a century ago. He was among the first country music superstars and pioneers, known for his yodeling and is often referred to as “The Father of Country Music.”</li>
<li>“Stay Down Here Where You Belong” – Irving Berlin (1914) This was a pacifist song aimed right at The Bible Belt. Its anti-war message contrasted greatly with Berlin’s other, pro-war songs. Over the years it was performed and recorded by artists as diverse as Henry Burr, Groucho Marx, Tiny Tim and the New Leviathan Oriental Foxtrot Orchestra.</li>
<li>“Yes Sir, No Sir” – The Kinks (1969)</li>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>As we’ve seen and heard over the last hundred years there have been literally hundreds of songs, both pro and con, written by hundreds of composers and writers, and performed and recorded by hundreds of artists of all kinds in every imaginable location and venue. The stories behind many of these songs are as moving as the songs themselves. I hoped at least a few of these samples have moved you.</p>

<p>My goal has been to encourage you to use Wikipedia and YouTube to explore the songs of WWI and, hopefully, explore the treasures found in national archives and libraries about them.</p>
