<p align="justify">
It was a particularly cold and snowy night in London, and as I entered the
quarters at 221B Baker Street which I share with my good friend Sherlock 
Holmes, I stamped my feet and shook the evening's precipitation from my
trenchcoat before removing it and hanging it upon the hook.  Emerging from 
the foyer and stepping toward the fire to warm my hands, I found my friend
seated at the table, a contented smile upon his face.  "Good evening, 
Holmes," I said.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Indeed it is, Watson," came his reply.  "Pray, come and see what I
have been up to whilst you tended to hangnails and the other assorted 
ailments and complaints of your subscribers."
</p>
<p align="justify">
Rubbing my hands briskly together one final time, I left the fire and took
note of the fact that the cause of Holmes's rather jovial mood was certainly
the Diplomacy set laid 
out on the table before him.  Upon the board stood only a single English army,
planted squarely and proudly upon
the capital of that Great Power which has lately
been the subject of so much press.
<!--
the capital of that most pretentious of Great Powers,
having ambitions matching only those of Great Britain.
-->
I quickly grasped 
something of my friend's afternoon activity, and said, "Holmes! You have been
engaged in a game of Last Man Standing!"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Engaged, yes; but only after the fact, Watson.  What we have here is
indeed the concluding position of a particularly interesting Last Man 
Standing exhibition.  I am delighted to know that you are familiar with
such things; they are admittedly rather frivolous, and a not-inexpensive
diversion for many men."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Certainly I am aware of it, Holmes;
it is presently all the 
rage throughout Europe.  In a Last Man Standing exhibition, 
the exhibitor reduces the number of pieces on the board to one by
reproducing for his audience a game that he has previously concocted,
and whose orders sit in a sealed envelope.
Before replaying the game, it is customary for him to
describe some of its interesting features to his audience, after which
the assembled gentlemen often place wagers amongst themselves concerning
such things as which power will survive, the final position, and any number 
of other events that could transpire as the game is played out.
Obviously, as gentlemen all, every bettor vouches to having never
been made privy to the sealed moves. It is the case, however, as you point
out, that just as often as not a man may be found to be less
interested in the beauty of the Great Game being displayed than he is in
the promise of financial gain to be had through succeeding in these
wagers.
Whilst I have never attended such an exhibition, I do admit that
the idea attracts me &mdash; though I would of course be unable to attend
in any role other than that of a spectator, unless 
the wagers be only for very small
stakes; this separates me, surely, from so many of the game's most ardent
patrons, who, while they may have no more love for The Game than I,
certainly possess much more financial wherewithal!"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Well described, Watson," my friend said.
"Such an exhibition game is, in fact, precisely what we have here.
Are you aware of the
Congress for Permanent Balkan Settlement currently underway in this city?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
The sudden change of subject initially caught me by surprise.
I was indeed &mdash; from coverage provided by <i>The Times</i> &mdash;
familiar
with the fact that
London was presently filled with diplomats from all across the Continent, 
meeting daily at <!-- Westminster --> the Foreign Office discussing the future of that troubled part
of Europe. "Most certainly I am aware of the Congress, Holmes," I answered him.  
When Holmes only puffed on his pipe silently, I continued, rather
mystified, launching into a non-sequitur.
"As Fleet Street would tell it,
the present difficulties in debate concern
<!--
the dangerous calls for Serbian autonomy that some fear will
eventually drag the entire Continent to arms,
-->
the bold reassertion by agitators of the Hungarian Crown's claim to
Transylvania."
<!--
, and allegations of interference in the internal affairs of the Bulgars,
and Greeks by
powers having colonial ambitions in Africa, Iberia, and Scandinavia.
It is also said that the representatives from Low Countries are threatening
to depart the conference, believing that their interests are being
ignored by controlling diplomats from the Great Powers."
</p>
<p align="justify">
-->
I paused once again, and Holmes still kept silent. Searching my mind for another
piece of information about the Congress, I was suddenly struck by the reason
for my friend's question.  "By Jove, Holmes! Is this game the
work of the
great Baron Herv&eacute;?  Did he visit our apartment to-day whilst I was occupied in
my unpleasant drudgery at the chemist's?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"The great Baron Herv&eacute;", as I had referred to him, was of course
Baron Herv&eacute; van Rompuy-Leterme, long the toast of the continent,
and certainly among the most well-respected and
talented men of our age.
A universally acclaimed diplomat in the theatre of European politics,
the baron was also one of the foremost Diplomacy players of the past decades.
Some years ago, citing advancing age, he had 
retired both from politics and from the active play of The
Game.
Of late, however, he had become something of an elder statesman,
both on the board and off.
His ardent passion for
peace in the Balkans had proven sufficient to draw him from his retirement and
place him as the presiding officer of the
great Congress now in session, and his passion for The Game had recently seen
him treating Diplomacy clubs all across the continent to exhibitions of his
keen talents in the construction of Last Man Standing games.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Yes and no, Watson," came the reply. "This game is indeed the work of Baron
Herv&eacute;, but unfortunately, I have not had the pleasure of his company here
at Baker Street.
It seems, happily, that despite his busy schedule presiding over the Congress,
he has managed to make time to entertain
a number of his fellow delegates, also boarded at the Calhamer Club,
as well as some invited members and guests of the Club,
with his skills.  He has, in fact, brought with him from Brussels
his famously large Diplomacy board."
<p align="justify">
Hearing this, and that Baron Herv&eacute; was quartered at our Club, I was delighted.
"So you have been out to the Calhamer Club this afternoon, Holmes?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"No indeed, Watson; I would not presume to venture out in this weather.
<!--
and I was not invited to the exhibition that the baron 
conducted last evening.
-->
The game itself was brought to me, here, earlier to-day, by our friend
Sir Malcolm
Walpole-Price, down from Liverpool for the Congress, who was privileged
to attend the exhibition conducted last evening.
<!-- given last night by Baron Herv&eacute;. -->
Sir Malcolm was in excellent
good spirits, for he had (like many of the others in attendance at 
the club) patriotically wagered on England to win.  In fact, Sir Malcolm was
doubly successful, for he also wagered upon the survival of the army 
that begins the game in his home-town of Liverpool, and, indeed, that unit
did become the Last Man Standing."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I see, Holmes; it sounds like Sir Malcolm had capital fun."
(I groaned at my own pun, but
Holmes seemed to take no note of it.)  "I wish we had been on-hand for 
it.  If I may ask, were you told which 'marvels' the baron exhibited in last
night's game?
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I was.  For one thing, Watson, this final position was obtained after the
conclusion of only four game-years."
</p>
<p align="justify">
It took a moment for my
face to register the surprise I experienced on hearing that such a thing
could be accomplished.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Noting my delayed reaction, Holmes smiled and continued.
"And that is not all, Watson.  The claim was made 
&mdash; and proven &mdash; that not a single neutral centre would be captured,
and &mdash; most marvelous to the audience, in a game that was to achieve 
its <i>d&eacute;nouement</i> after 1904 &mdash; that every one of the seven Great
Powers would survive into 1903.  Those facts, apart from the information that
the Last Man Standing would be found, as you see here,
sitting upon one of the capitals of the Great Powers
of Europe, amounted to the sum total of the baron's description.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"The capital, as it turned out, was one of those captured in the first year, 
and thus no longer belonging to its own Great Power. But the suspense didn't
stop there. 'Imagine this,' Sir Malcolm told me. 'There were just three pieces
left going into the final year. For those among us familiar with the 
mechanics of the game, it was clear that the third unit was just there to do
the offices, and that the battle was going to be between the English and the
Turkish armies. The symbolism wasn't lost on the representatives of the young
Republic of Turkey, who were as cheerful as if 
their admission to the League of Nations had just been confirmed. But the room
really exploded when that army was moved into the capital city first, sealing
its faith for anyone who had been paying attention. But look at the time, I
must really go now.' Upon which he took his coat and left."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Astonishing, Holmes!  As I see the board here in its final position, I must
presume that Sir Malcolm brought with him the litany of the game's 
moves.  Might I see them, and thus do as you and he did, playing the game out
for my own entertainment and amusement?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
Holmes dismissed my assumption with the wave of his hand.  "I suppose that Sir
Malcolm may have had with him a transcribed copy of the game's orders, he may
even have intended to leave such a copy with me; the subject did not
arise, however, and I did not inquire.  Rather, using the details he 
had provided, I considered it an enjoyable diversion to reproduce for myself the
game in its every detail, and that is how I have spent my 
afternoon."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Your skills never cease to amaze me, Holmes!  Simply from the fact that this
sole English army survived, after a theatrical triumph over Turkey in the final year, 
and the three other spare facts you were 
given &mdash; that no neutral centres were taken, that the game reaches this
position before Spring of 1905 is played, and that all powers survive 
into 1903 &mdash; you reconstructed the entire exhibition game?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Quite so, Watson," Holmes said nonchalantly, as if what I had described were
mere child's play.
