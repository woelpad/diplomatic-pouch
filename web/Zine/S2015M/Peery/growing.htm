<p>Imagine growing up and living your entire life with a birthdate that was synonymous with the second greatest military defeat in American history? Kind of makes planning a birthday party difficult, doesn’t it? Especially when you’re ten years old.</p>

<p>Allan B. Calhamer faced that dilemma his whole post-childhood life. He was born on 7 December, 1931, so he turned ten on 7 December, 1941, a “date that will live in infamy.”</p>

<p>I remember talking to Allan about this at the 1972 Chicago DipCon. He told me that having your birthday on the 7th of December after Pearl Harbor was a bit like having it on Christmas, only worse. Not only did you not get to have a birthday party, but everybody was walking around with a sad face. Sort of like the day John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Nobody who was old enough to remember will ever forget where they were on both dates.</p>

<p>I mention this because ever since Allan’s passing I’ve been trying to think of a way the hobby could perpetually honor and remember the man who founded it, but nothing came to mind.</p>

<p>At the same time a different lobe of my brain was trying to think of a way to create a hobby-wide Diplomacy event that would attract all kinds of Diplomacy players all over the world at the same time. It was a mind-boggling idea, but again nothing specific came to mind.
Then, a few days ago I happened to read a media account in The Christian Science Monitor entitled:  “With its famous food in peril, France goes all out on ‘gastrono-diplomacy’,” and everything fell into place.</p>

<p>As I read the story behind the event the French called “Gout de France/Good France” event I thought to myself, “Why can’t we do that?” You can find out more about it via a Google or Yahoo search. Suffice it to say that the French, in typical French fashion decided to promote their declining gastronomical tradition with a giant event that would include 1,300 chefs across five continents preparing a classic “gastronomic” meal for 100,000 clients. Six hundred and fifty guests, headed by the Foreign Minister of France, Laurent Fabius, dined on a seven-meal that included Dom Perigon Champagne, puff pastry of foie gras, salmon tartar topped with caviar and toasted quinoa stew with shaved truffles, fish, suckling lamb, a cheese plate, and a decadent chocolate pudding. Appropriately, the event was held in the Battles Gallery of the Versailles Palace.</p>

<p>So, with the inspiration of Allan’s birthday and the realization of the Gout de France I would like to propose an event I will call “A World Wide Day to Celebrate Diplomacy.” And because this year the 7th of December falls on a Monday, I suggest it be held on the 6th of December.</p>

<p>The purpose of the event is simple enough: to help grow the world wide hobby and to celebrate its fifty-plus years of existence.</p>

<p>Without going into a lot of specifics here is my idea:</p>
<ol type="n">
<li>The event will be held simultaneously on the same day worldwide over a twenty-four hour period (local time).</li>
<li>All events will use a common set of rules for play.</li>
<li>Adjudications will occur simultaneously.</li>
<li>Results will be announced simultaneously.</li>
<li>A common scoring system will be used.</li>
<li>All events will be coordinated by one “command central.”</li>
<li>A common PBEM system using a common scoring system will allow internet play at the same time.</li>
</ol>
<p>At this point I have no specific procedural rules in mind. I just want to find out how much support there is for the concept. If it seems warranted then we can go forward with the nitty-gritty of planning and organizing the event (and won’t that be fun! <img src="../../Common/smiley.gif"/>).</p>

<p>If you like the idea and/or would like to participate please contact me sooner rather than later.</p>
