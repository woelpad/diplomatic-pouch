<p><table>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="red" style="color:white">A</th><td> is for <b>Ankara</b>, next to the Black Sea. When Turks send their fleet out, the Russians won't flee.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="red" style="color:white">U</th><td> is for <b>Uncle</b>, a word that you cry, when neighbours are swarming and no help is nigh.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="red" style="color:white">S</th><td> is for <b>Sinking</b>, a feeling you get, when neighbours conspire and start taking bets.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="red" style="color:white">T</th><td> is for <b>Trusting</b>, which isn't too smart. Your neighbours are liars and make it an art.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="red" style="color:white">R</th><td> is for <b>Rebound</b>. It's what units do, when you move to a space and your neighbour does too.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="red" style="color:white">I</th><td> is for <b>Irate</b>, not the optometrist's fee. It can come from failure of your Diplomacy.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="red" style="color:white">A</th><td> is for <b>Army</b>. You need to have lots, to keep other guys from calling the shots.</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p><table>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="blue" style="color:white">E</th><td> is for <b>England</b>, surrounded by water. He shouldn't be trusted; he can be a rotter.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="blue" style="color:white">N</th><td> is for <b>Nice Guy</b>, which you cannot be, if you want the result to be victory.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="blue" style="color:white">G</th><td> is for <b>Greedy</b>; it's a Deadly Sin. Get overextended and your "allies" move in.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="blue" style="color:white">L</th><td> is for <b>Lucky</b>, which you call their guesses, that give them your dots, and leave you with messes.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="blue" style="color:white">A</th><td> is for <b>Access</b>, which should be denied, to your nasty neighbours who all want your hide.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="blue" style="color:white">N</th><td> is for <b>None</b>, the SCs you're left, after they stab you with moves mean and deft.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="blue" style="color:white">D</th><td> is for <b>Damned</b>, if don't or you do. Yep, no matter what, you're gonna get screwed.</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p><table>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="cyan">F</th><td> is for <b>Fleet</b>. You'll need some, I think. Grab supply centres, so they do not sink.</td></tr>

<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="cyan">A</th><td> is for <b>Allies</b>, who're needed to win. But don't be too trusting or they'll do you in.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="cyan">N</th><td> is for <b>Neighbours</b>, each guy has a few. They are not your friends &#8212; they're out to get you.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="cyan">C</th><td> is for <b>Connive</b>, and double-dealing. Keeping friends happy and bad guys squealing.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="cyan">E</th><td> is for <b>Evil</b> (in others, not you). Lying and stabbing are things you don't do. (<i>Nudge-nudge, wink-wink.</i>)</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p><table>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="black" style="color:white">G</th><td> is for <b>Germany</b>. He might have a chance, if he can get England to start fighting with France.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="black" style="color:white">E</th><td> is for <b>Edinburgh</b>, a city of Scotch. If England has lost it, the game has been botched.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="black" style="color:white">R</th><td> is for <b>Ruhr</b>, an industrial zone. If France invades it, the German will moan.</td></tr>

<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="forestgreen" style="color:white">Y</th><td> is for 'Wh<b><u>Y</u></b> me?', (OK, it's a stretch), you say when you're stabbed and you need to kvetch.</td></tr>
</table></p>
<p><table>
<tr><th>R</th><td> is for <b>Russia</b>, that guy in the East. He pretends that he's nice, but he's really a beast.</td></tr>

<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="yellow">K</th><td> is for <b>Kindness</b>, an admirable trait. Just don't expect others to reciprocate.</td></tr>
<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="yellow">E</th><td> is for <b>Elegant</b>, how you praise your win. Others are hostile and claim it's a sin.</td></tr>

</table></p>
<blockquote><i>And now, the additional Youngstown Great Powers!!!</blockquote>

<tr><th valign="top" bgcolor="magenta">D</th><td> is for <b>Death</b>, which came quickly last game. Here's hoping that this time will not end the same!</td></tr>
