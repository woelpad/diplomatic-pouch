<H3>Getting Right Down To Business....</H3>
We're so late this time that I'm just going to pour the mail out, without
even bothering to make idle conversation with you while I untie the top of
the mailbag.
<P>
Well, here near the top of the pile are some solutions to the acrostic and
cryptic pencil puzzles in the last issue.  Looks like we received solutions from
Bradd W. Szonye, Stephen Araps, Andrew Hejl, and Brett Clegg.
I also see that a number of people said The Pouch should have more puzzles.
We'll do our level best.
<P>
Well, let's see what else we have in here....

I see you took my bait, Manus.  After my jibe about cricket being baseball
for grown-ups, you inserted the editorial comment:  "In passionate defense
of the Great American Pastime, let me categorically state that baseball is
to Americans as the church is to the Pope. And for good reason."
<P>
Absolutely, Manus *chuckle*, and as I said, cricket is <i>still</i> like
baseball for grown ups!
<P>
I love it when Americans try to talk about cricket and baseball and
unknowingly make my point that much more ironic....

As an Aussie who has attended a couple of tournaments in Sydney about eight
years back and who has been living in Turkey for the past
four years I'd like to thank you for an excellent article.
<P>
I've only just got back into playing Diplomacy by e-mail and as for the
cricket, no-one over here has a clue.

Excellent article.

<HR>
<H4>
From Jeff Serandos
(<a href=mailto:jserandos@pipeline.com>jserandos@pipeline.com</a>):</H4>
I must point out one recurring error in the
article.  It states at several points that such-and-such an opening
guarantees Sweden to Russia.  Not true!  Russia is never guaranteed
Sweden
because Germany can put two units on it in the Spring move.  That is one
of the reasons that I am so down on northern strategies for Russia.
<blockquote><b><i>Author's response:
True - Germany could send Hamburg north to Denmark and Berlin
to the Bornholm Sea and then support itself into Sweden. This is
maybe even a reasonable tactic for Germany, so that it can better
control the north and go after Britain. Because of this, however,
Britain is more likely to support Russia into Sweden in 2000,
and it's also easier for Russia to get a third unit on Sweden than for
Germany.
<P>
Germany also has so many other SCs it can take
that annoying Russia in 1999 is probably not his top prority.
But thanks for pointing this out. I guess we should rectify
all those mentions of 'guarantees Sweden' to 'almost
guarantees Sweden.' [Editor's note: that change has now been made.]
</i></b></blockquote>
It was a thoroughly enjoyable and informative
article - as usual.
Another great article.  I wanted to thank you for the fine editing job
you did on my comments.

Thanks again, and thanks for your comments. The articles
wouldn't be the same without all the player comments.
I think Manus deserves some of the credit too, for the
final touchups and layout.
<P>
Editor's comments:
Well, my editing of the Modern articles does suffer in that when I choose
to call myself done, what we have is a very huge single file.  In the
course of editing, I kind of trample on Vince's well-thought-out divisions
of where useful hyperlinks would send the reader to shorter passages.
This has unfortunately become a tradition since the first time I edited
one of his submissions -- I must have procrastinated and been under a
time crunch, and never went back to give it his more sensible presentation.
Subsequent articles in his series were done the same way for consistency,
but on the proverbial "someday," it sure would be nice
if I would go back and reorganize all of his articles so that they are split
into subject-related pieces, with links.  The article in the current issue
(<a href=/Zine/S1998M/Mous/Spain.html>"The Spanish Armada"</a>) is a bit of a departure.
Because of the lateness of the issue publication, I chose to adhere more
closely to
Vince's original rather than to be consistent with the other published
articles.  It's still a single page, but it's a bit easier to navigate.

<H3 align=center>Mail Received Concerning
<a href="/Zine/W1997A/Kermanidis/super-al.html">Super-Alliances in Modern Diplomacy</a></H3>
<HR>
<H4>
From an anonymous someone:
</H4>
In a recent game of Modern I played, one mass alliance seemed to do quite well (while it lasted); this was in fact a four-player alliance: Russia/Ukraine/Turkey/Egypt (a sort of mega-juggernaut; luckily, I was Spain). There were several consequences of this alliance; the most notable being that Turkey got <i>four</i> builds in 1995.
<P>
The alliance broke down with a Turkish stab of Egypt, as well as a Ukranian stab of Russia.

I have to congratulate you on the Dip Pouch. It is by far the
best page on Diplomacy on the net, you have done a great job.
<P>
Again, I thank you for the great effort you have put into the development
of Diplomacy through your Internet site. I'm crazy about the game myself
and I'm playing a bundle of games as well as mastering many others and
would like to contribute an article to The Pouch some time in the future
if you allow me to do so.

ROFLMAO! Beautifully done, sir.       I haven't been snowed by an
April Fool joke in years,   and may I add that The Pouch is my very favorite
web-site.

I am writing to express my appreciation for a <i>perfect</i> hoax! It made a

<H4>From David Lay
(<a href=mailto:dave@netc.net.au>dave@netc.net.au</a>):</H4>
As a big fan of April Fool's on the 'net, I was having a rather
disappointing day this year.  The day had almost passed without a single
incident.  But then, as I went to check the game queue at the DipPouch, I
got my fix.
<P>
Excellent choice of fooling material given the current wave or corporate
crackdown on non-revenue generating web sites.
<P>
The giveaway, for me, was the failure to name the sender of the cease
and desist letter and the plea to extinguish flames against Avalon Hill.
Nevertheless, there's something strangely satisfying about the
shock to realisation to ROTFL cycle.
<P>
Please pass on my thanks to The Council for making my April Fool's Day,
1998.

You really stabbed me!
It's the first joke I've fallen for in years but this time I wasn't even
close!
Nice work. With lies like that I understand why you're such a good player.
Signed, A smiling Kent.

Absolutely wonderful.  It's currently 11:57 pm, and I hadn't been
fooled by a single thing today, and was worried that I'd get through
with only the law school newspaper prank issue.  (Which had a
revealing photo of our dean and Sandra Day O'Connor that looked like
they were making out, with the headline "Smokin': Sexton caught in
liplock with Supreme Court Justice."
<P>
That had me going, since it was so believable and done in the writing
style that I have come to expect from the Pouch.  The checkers part
threatened to give it away, but I chalked that up to resigned wishful
joking.
<P>
Great job!

Thanks for your work on The Diplomatic Pouch. It is very useful, and it
would be horrible if it left us (<i>please</i> don't scare us with another
April Fool's joke like that again!).  Well laid out.
