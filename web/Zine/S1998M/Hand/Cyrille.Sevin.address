 Hello Manus,

 -=> Quoting Manus Hand to berry renken <=-

 MH> I just read with alarm at the events that have befallen our
 MH> world champ.  Would you be so kind as to pass his address
 MH> along to me.  I will publish it in the Pouch so that the best
 MH> wishes of the community can make it to him.

 I'm as worried as you are, all I know is that the accident must have
 happened a little less than a month ago, after which Cyrille has been in
 a coma for two days. Reportedly he has been recovering thereafter but is
 still in the hospital. I can only hope there are no lasting consequences
 for Cyrille. Have you heard more about his present condition?
 
 His E-mail address is <sevin@math.jussieu.fr> but I think it unlikely that
 E-mail would reach him at this point, his home address is
 
 M. Cyrille SEVIN
 12, rue des 3 mousquetaires
 95220 HERBLAY
 France

 I would think mail sent there will be forwarded to Cyrille by his
 girlfriend.
 
 MH> Thanks (and see you at Chapel Hill!)

 I'd love to come but there's no way to get there from here that I can afford
 at this moment. And US customs might not let me in. About 6 years ago I
 stayed in the US for 8 months, during 6 of which I had a job in New York and
 I only had a tourist visa (which lasts only 3 months and doesn't allow
 taking a paid job). Anyway, good luck there!


 All the best,

 Berry
