I would like to start off this article with a warning.  This is
not about tactics, super alliances, or a guaranteed method for winning
as Germany by 1904.  I will not promise to make you a better Diplomacy
player (but if  I do, I want some of the credit), and I will not show
you any fancy opening combinations with names such as the "Llama
Lepanto" or "Piccadilly Prance." Note, if anyone actually HAS named an
opening combination the "Llama Lepanto," I would not be overly
surprised.
<p>
So, I bet now I have everyone wondering just what the heck this
article is actually about. It is about the most vital and yet most often
overlooked aspect of PBEM diplomacy- press.  I can already hear the
gasps of shock from the great tacticians in our audience, but before
everyone bails out in disgust to go read the <a href=../../S1998M/Hand/deposits.html>Pouch
Deposits</a>, I ask
that you, dear reader, let me explain my position.
<p>
With the exception of no press games, which have a completely
different system of communication, press plays a vital role to every
Diplomacy game. Alliances can only be formed through a rapport of press
between two or more powers.  In most of my games I do not overtly ask
for alliances with other powers, but instead talk to everyone and
nurture relationships with powers that I see have the same general goals
as myself.  Often, the other player realizes this as well, and
a full fledged alliance forms.  This could only be possible through the
press we started off sending. Also, stabs are much more effective if you
have secured Diplomatic fronts through press. An example of this is how
one time I was playing France and was stabbed by a German.  However,
the German also lost some ground on other fronts, and so wrote a note
saying how sorry he was for the stab etc.  He also included a plan where
he would withdraw from my territory and proposed a scheme that I thought
would assure my safety.  Instead, the Kaiser lent unwanted support to
one of my units and marched into Paris that turn.  The point of this was
that even after the stab, the wily German was able to use press to his
advantage.
<p>
This is meant to be an introduction to a series of 3-4 articles
in which I discuss different press settings, the most creative uses of
press, and various other topics that I can come up with. I would very
much like all the DipPouch readers who have an interesting story (or
two, or three)about press and how they used it against someone/someone
used it against them to please send it to me and I will include the most
interesting in future articles in this series. In my next article, I
will discuss plain ol' W-P- press.
<p>
Finally, as a sidenote, I would like to explain how I got so
interested in press.  In my last two or three games, the level of press
has been rapidly declining, and I think this may be true throughout
Dipdom.  I, for one, like getting and sending press to all the countries
on the board, as it makes the game livelier and more fun, and I hope
this series of articles will help shed some light on press and encourage
some new and interesting uses.  Secondly, I was hooked by a r.g.d thread
about gray broadcasts, and immediately set up a gray broadcast game
(tim02 on USIN) to see what this press variant is like.  When the game
ends I will be writing up player comments and my own thoughts about gray
broadcasts in an article.
