<p>
For all those who enjoyed the cryptic in last edition and now want to
practice those new skills and warped thought patterns on a somewhat
more demanding puzzle. Crank the grey matter's starter motor and take
a look at the grid below.
<P>Oh and if you know what's good for you, read
the questions and answers below.<P>

<H3> Questions and Answers </h3>
<dl>
<dt><b>Hey where did the black squares go?</b><br>
<dd>
Well, I didn't want to waste all your printer toner. No seriously,
because many of the answers are dip provinces giving the length
of the answers makes it too easy. Trust me, on seeing a 15 letter
answer starting with C would you really need to read the clue before
entering constantinople? So you have to work out which squares are
blacked out.
To make things easier the clue numbers above are correct and the
crossword has the usual 180 degree rotational symmetry. Hence if (x,y),
denoting column x and row y is black then (16-x,15-y) is also black.
Alternatively keep rotating
the grid through 180 degrees and ensuring it looks the same.<br><br>
<P><DT>
<b>How do I solve it if I don't know where the answers go?</b><br>
<dd>
Best method is probably to go through all the clues and solve as many
as possible and then figure how the answers can be fitted together. To
give you a start 1 down is very easy.<br><br>
<P><dt>
<b>That reminds me I can't solve the clues either, how do they
work?</b><br>
<dd>
Cryptic clues come in two parts, one of which will always be literal,
i.e. will mean the same as the answer. The second part may also be
literal
so <b><i> Rear end of Queue(4) </b></i> is "back", which means both rear
and
end of queue. Alternatively the second part of the clue can be cryptic,
with
two elements, itself; the clue and a bit telling you how to solve it. An
example <b><i> Four week period when normal hunt is sabotaged
(5,5)</b></i>
answer: "Lunar month", literal clue: 4 week period, cryptic clue: normal
hunt  and solution keyword: sabotaged, meaning the cryptic clue is an
anagram. Note these 3 parts can come in any order. Alternative cryptic
types are soundalikes (words spelt differently
but phonetically indistinguishable), reversals (words backwards) and
containers (short words in longer ones).<br><br>
<P><DT>
<b>How did you design a Diplomacy crossword with symmetry?</b><br>
<DD>
Thanks for spotting that it can't be easy, so you'll hopefully excuse the
fact I cheated. Cheats it's helpful to know about are:
<ul>
<li>A few clues have nothing to do with Diplomacy whatsoever.
<li>Other clues use the three letter province abbreviations. This is
only when the abbreviation is the first three letters of the province
name. It is obvious from the clue whether I've abbreviated even before
calculating the grid. Two examples: <b><i> Steer it erratically toward
the Adriatic coast</b></i> is Trieste [thanks to Gary Kennedy] in full
because all letters of the anagram are given while <b><i>Majority take
tea East of Russian capital</i></b> is Most, meaning majority, with T
after
(or east of) Mos. Here the answer obviously isn't Moscowt because it
isn't a word and certainly doesn't mean majority. Yes I know this clue
is awful, nothing in the puzzle is so bad, honest, well maybe just the
one.
<li>A couple of clues also relate to variants although they are not
impossible with no variant knowledge. No knowledge of pbem or judges
is assumed and the crossword is international (no answers are spelt
differently by people on different sides of the Atlantic -- or should that
be "spelled" differently?).
</ul>
<P><dt>
<b>Okay, I've read all that but still can't get anywhere, please
help?</b><br>
<dd>
Practice makes perfect, so try <a
href="/DP-cgi/cryptic">last
seasons puzzle</a> which now has answers online in <a href=/Zine/S1998M/Szykman/solutions.html>this issue of the Zine</a>.
This doesn't really attempt to follow the cryptic conventions outlined
above so, for the really stuck, I'd recommend trying the
<a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/">Daily Telegraph Crossword</a>
(a non-Pouch site that sadly also requires a short registration) and
returning tomorrow to get the answers and then work out how it's done.
You can also e-mail me but I won't give out help until sometime in May so
that people who are able to solve the puzzle without help will have had
the opportunity to do so and submit solutions to The Pouch.  If I
of similar requests I'll post to rec.games.diplomacy in May.<p>
</dl>
Good luck and let us know how you get on.
