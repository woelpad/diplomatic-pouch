Laying Out The Great Disarmament Conundrum
<HR>
</H2>
<! ------------------------------------------------------------- >
Back at Baker Street,  Holmes lit a pipe and asked whether I had any
pressing business that wanted attending.  As it happened, my mother was slightly
unwell, and I was pleased to take the chance to visit her.
<P>
When I returned,  the sounds of Strauss echoed down the stairwell.
I passed a tall stranger on the way out, who remarked in a heavily
accented voice how welcome Holmes had made him.
Holmes was standing by the window playing his violin, admiring the seven
fleets on the Diplomacy board.
<P>
"I deduce that the disarmament problem is solved, Holmes.  Though I cannot
see how you did it."
<P>
"On the contrary, Watson.  You have seen everything that is needed for
the solution. You need only to organise the data, and the solution
becomes apparent.  What do you know about the Foreign Secretary's dilemma?"
<P>
"Well, naturally it is a Diplomacy problem," I began.
<P>
Holmes smiled.
<P>
"We need to find a set of 1901 moves that leaves all countries
with the same number of fleets and armies at the start of 1902, and a
subsequent set which leaves each holding no armies and exactly one fleet
after 1902?"
<P>
"Precisely, Watson.  And you will notice I have taken a little
extra insurance in the cause of European peace."
<P>
