        The Great Disarmament Conundrum
        <HR>
</H2>
<! ------------------------------------------------------------- >

After receiving more help from Holmes than I cared to admit, I was
finally able to put to paper the <a href=solution.html>solution to
the Case of the Suwati Refugee</a>.  But overall, solving that puzzle
was a small achievement, for both Holmes as well as I (despite the
fact that it required considerably more effort for me to do so)... unlike
the one I am about to describe. 
<p>
Of all Holmes' triumphs, I have left this one unchronicled for the longest.
In his cerebral way, Holmes regards it as a mere bagatelle among cases:
True, the solution is not unique and many more difficult puzzles have been
cracked by that great intellect, but the impact of his finding a solution was greater
than in any other case.
                             <P>
It was October of 1900.  The Indian summer of September was turning to a damp
Autumn.  Holmes was at the peak of his powers, little knowing that his
denouement with Professor Moriarty lay only a few months ahead of him.

    <P>

With our acquaintance, both personal and professional, with the Foreign
Secretary, Holmes and I had become
well known and rather frequent visitors at the Ministry of War.  So it
was not unusual to find ourselves, summoned once more to the
oak-panelled offices of Lord Fortescue.  More
unusual was the company we found there.  The two most prominent
military men in the realm --  Admiral Sir Charles Farquharson and General
Sir James Roylance, whom I had not met before but whose faces I
recognised -- were seated in one corner, and we were welcomed not by Lord
Fortescue, but by the Prime Minister himself!
The atmosphere was clearly tense.
      <P>
Ushering us in, Lord Fortescue introduced us to the knights.   
      <P>
"I really cannot see what this amateur policeman has to offer us, sir," said
Sir James.  "Your ridiculous government has returned from the summit
with an agreement which nobody could possibly implement.  But go ahead
and ask Mr. Holmes -- if he has anything like the intelligence you credit him
with he will surely tell you the same thing."
          <P>
"Aye, the lowest cabinboy could see it," said Sir Charles.
<P>
"Well, gentlemen," began the Prime Minister.   "As you may know I have
recently returned from a meeting with the heads of the six other Great
Powers of the continent.  We are all deeply concerned about the build-up
of military forces in Europe at a time of growing diplomatic tensions.
However, I am delighted to say that the negotiations were successful."
<P>
The General drew breath sharply, and Admiral snorted loudly.
<P>
"The Seven Great Powers are now committed to a policy of disarmament.
According to our treaty, at the end of next year, each will reduce its forces to identical
strengths, and by the following year all armies will be disbanded.  In order
to maintain our colonial responsibilities, we have agreed that each power will retain 
a single fleet."
<P>
I was delighted, and honoured to be party to such an auspicious moment
in European history.  Holmes, however, was frowning deeply.  Addressing 
the prime minister, he enquired  as to the plan for disarmament.

<P>  
The Prime Minister answered, "I have left all such details in the capable
hands of Lord Fortescue, while the 
Admiral and the General will implement his instructions.  Fortescue will 
provide you with more information -- I must be attending to more important
business."
<P>
Fortescue let the PM out, then turned to us. "So there you have it, gentlemen:
with no thought for the practicalities, we are commited to pan-European 
disarmament.  The problem is that we have no idea how such a thing could 
be achieved."
<P>

I usually allow Holmes the chance to respond first, but on this occasion
he was preoccupied with a careful study of the ceiling.  "I'm sure we'll
do our best, sir," I bluffed, being quite uncertain of how to begin. 
"What say you, Holmes?"

<P>
My question snapped Holmes out of his reverie.  "Yes indeed, Doctor, 
just how many options does the PM need?"  With a smiling eye turned toward
the military leaders, Holmes added, "I presume we cannot rely on our
own forces to leave our shores."
<P>
The admiral and general both went pale with disbelief that Holmes
even considered the disarmament possible.  For his part, Fortescue
simply smiled and replied,
"Just one will suffice -- what do you have in mind?"
<P> 

"It is an interesting conundrum, indeed.  With your permission, milord, I
will retire to my apartments and examine the possibilities."
