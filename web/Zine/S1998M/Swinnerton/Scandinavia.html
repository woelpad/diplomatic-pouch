<p>
<P>Germany is my favourite country to play. Apart from the obvious reasons
of the tight knot of supply centers and the ability to explode in any chosen
direction, something about the black pieces really appeals to me.</P>
<P>In 1992, at World DipCon in Canberra, Australia, an eccentric Frenchman
played Germany in a game in which I was Russia, and he pulled off an opening
that left me gasping for air. I can only remember the rest of the game vaguely,
but I'll never forget how I felt when I saw the black menace move in 1901.
I don't know whether the opening has a name, or who might have invented it,
but I've used it since and have delved into the negotiations and mindset
required to make it work. I have not seen the moves discussed in any articles
on the web, so I hope to make a contribution with these writings.</P>
<P>My first piece of advice is: Draw Germany. What I'm about to discuss just
won't work with any other nation.</P>
<P>Okay, so now you're Germany.  Who says you have to get involved in
a full-on western war? Don't fall into the mindset that says that you must
choose an enemy from either England or France then enlist the other to be your
partner. You've got to be very balanced with your two neighbours here.
Ideally, get them fighting each other and get involved on a minor level.
Sometimes
(depending on the ability of the players you face) an EFG can work. It's
a balance thing. A good Italian player will keep an average French player
busy without getting major gains, although France is the one with whom you
will eventually seek alliance. An average English player may not appreciate
that he has to choose another victim once St. Petersburg is captured. Your
call. I usually work to get them bouncing in the channel. </P>
<P>Know what is going on around you also. The old "central powers stick
together" motto will usually
give you honest appraisals from Austria and Italy. If you can get Austria
or Turkey antagonistic to Russia, this is good -- but an A/T alliance proper
is not. If Russia is under pressure elsewhere, he is going to be forced to
agree with your plans.</P>
<P>Now, how to handle the Russian?  Be friendly and receptive. Don't offer
alliance -- that always smells fishy to a Russian. Rarely do R/G alliances
form, or if they do are not long lived. Simply do the usual -- DMZ Prussia
and Silesia and promise Sweden. Say you are going to Denmark from Kiel, but
that you will definitely
allow Russia to pick up Sweden (after all, maybe you two can co-operate against England). Make sure Austria and/or Turkey deny Rumania to the Russian.</P>
<img hspace=10 align=left src=scan1.gif>
<P>Your Spring 1901 moves are completely neutral:
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Kiel to Denmark<br>
Army Berlin to Kiel<br>
Army Munich to Ruhr
</tt></blockquote>
<P>Everyone on the board now says: "Ah, a sensible German player. Didn't
do anything crazy," and they will all be likely to trust you somewhat.</P>
<br clear=both>&nbsp;<br>
What your neighbours did will obviously be of
great interest to you. If you did not misread the situation and things have
occurred in the basic pattern you had hoped for, you can move onto the next
step.</P>
<P>Let France and England know that you're having a crack at 3
builds. You're after Belgium. Now this may cause some dissension and the
cries of "Germany on six at the end of 1901! That's too dangerous" and cause a consortium to form against you. So be very careful. If England and France have
bounced in the channel in 1901 and no French army is in Picardy or Burgundy,
you don't have to say anything -- they can't get Belgium (well, England
can, but if he's uncertain about you he'll definitely go for Norway).
The point is, if you can make them both think it's pointless to try for
Belgium and that their units have other things to do, that is good. Let them
know that if they leave Belgium to you, you'll look very favourably upon
allying with either of them.</P>
<P>Restate to Russia that Sweden is his. Hopefully, you can see that Rumania
will not fall into Russian hands and that at least someone in the
south is anti-Czar.</P>
<P>At this stage you haven't done anything to upset
anyone else, and if things look like your plans will be upset, you can pull
out without anyone being the wiser. Plus you could get three builds.</P>
<P>Here it is necessary to raise the subject of "limited conflict".
Just because you take a center from someone, it doesn't mean that you are
at full scale war with them -- especially if this center is a neutral. Home
centers are somewhat different -- stealing them usually generates a rather nasty
response. But a neutral that hasn't been held for long can be a different
story. Get your head around it because you have to sell this to the Russian
after this move. And you have to believe it -- because, in the words of George
Castanza, "If you believe it Jerry, it's not a lie." And in all probability
it is not a lie either (but keep your options open).</P>
<img hspace=10 align=right src=scan2.gif>
<P>Your Fall 1901 moves are:
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Denmark to Baltic Sea<BR>
Army Kiel to Denmark<BR>
Army Ruhr to Holland
</tt></blockquote>
<P><i>Ay caramba!</i> Now it's nasty. <i>Now</i> you see why Russia must be
under pressure elsewhere. You have just overtly stated your intention to annex
Sweden in Spring of 1902. And that is what you're going to do.</P>
<br clear=both>&nbsp;
<br>Now you have to sell
the limited conflict story to Russia. Yes, you want Sweden, but no, you don't
want full scale war with Russia. The fight stops there. After all, he's busy elsewhere and can't fight a two front war, especially after facing a remove
at the end of 1902. This will be hard (the aforementioned Frenchman
didn't manage to sell it to me when I was Russia, and I got Rumania and I
built Fleet St. Petersburg (south coast) but it is important. If you can do it,
you should
ask the Russian to retreat the Swedish fleet to Skaggerak in order to help
a sneak attack by you into England.</P>
<P>Hopefully you have orchestrated
continuing conflict between France and England. Because now you're going
to choose the French side. Build a fleet in Kiel and an army in Munich (this
will make Russia a bit happier with you). Aim to annex Belgium also in Spring
1902.</p>
<img hspace=10 align=left src=scan3.gif>
<P>Your moves could be thus:</P>
<blockquote><tt>
Fleet Baltic supports Army Denmark to Sweden<br>
Army Denmark to Sweden<br>
Fleet Kiel to Denmark<br>
Army Holland to Belgium<br>
Army Munich to Ruhr
</TT></blockquote>
<br clear=both>&nbsp;
<br>If you've
managed to get Russia back in camp and have him retreat to Skaggerak (for
those of you who say you'd never do this as Russia, just remember, you're
not playing Russia --
I've managed to pull this off twice) you now have two fleets on the North Sea, and England would not be expecting co-operation between your fleet in Denmark and the Russian fleet in Skaggerak.</P>
<p>So if you've
worked hard, pulled out some aces, and have been just downright lucky, you
could have a Fleet in the North Sea at the end of 1902 and be up to seven units.
Enough to handle England yourself.</P>
<P>In 1903 you should plan to capture
Norway (with or without Russian help; <tt>BAL-Swe</tt> and <tt>Swe-Fin</tt>
should do the trick) and have a good balance of fleet and
army power. Once you've participated
in a dissection of England, other circumstances will dictate your next victim
-- why, it could be your long suffering Russian friend; after all it's not
fair to keep them suffering so long.</P>
<P>As with all opening strategy
in Diplomacy, you have six wild cards that ultimately influence the success
of your plans -- the other six players. The best laid plans can come
unstuck at the most crucial times, but I think this opening is worth it purely for the Fall 1901 shock value.</P>
