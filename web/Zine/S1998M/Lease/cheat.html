Recently, there has been a rash of incidents of cheating
on the judges. This appears to be due largely to the availability of
"freemail" accounts, such as Hotmail, Rocketmail, etc. What happens is
that someone gets the bright idea of registering on the judge with
multiple accounts, giving false information for some or all of them.
Then he/she either goes out and find a game to join, with one or two
guaranteed "allies", or he/she creates a game and becomes its Master
and also takes one or two positions as a player. In the former case, it
"merely" creates a situation in which the unsuspecting players are
outnumbered by the one taking multiple positions; in the latter case,
the cheater gets the opportunity to see the orders submitted by the
other players in the game before submitting his/her own.</P>
<P>My primary and immediate reaction to this is, "What is the
<B>point</B>?!?" What has the player proved by "winning" the game in
this manner? That a man can win a fight if his opponent's arms are
handcuffed behind his back? Well, <B>duh</B>! Tell us something we
don't know! "Winning" in this manner demonstrates nothing about a
player's abilities as a diplomat or as a strategist. An unfair
victory is meaningless to the "winner", and is a complete waste of time
for the players who tried to play fairly. They invested time and effort
into trying to make alliances and plan strategy, all the while not
suspecting that two or three of their opponents were really one and the
same, or that their moves were previewed by their opponent.</P>
<P>There are those who would ask, "What do you mean, cheating?  Isn't
Diplomacy all about lying and cheating so you can win?"  No.  It's
about playing within the rules of the game, which allow you to <I>lie
to the other players</I>, but do not allow you to deceive the GM.  The
object is to persuade other players to help you and that you will help
them, even if the latter isn't really true.  But once you introduce
factors outside of the rules, it isn't really Diplomacy anymore. </P>
<P>Why do people do this? I think there is a combination of factors at
work here. First, there is the feeling of cleverness that comes from
figuring out how to "beat the system". These people probably figure
that they're the first ones ever to come up with the idea, and think
it shows they are "k00l". Ha! There have been several people over the
past several months who have been caught at this, and the reaction has
been the same. The cheaters were banned from the judge/s where they
were caught, and the affected Judge Keepers shared the cheaters'
identities so they could be banned from other judges. </P>
<P>Second, I think there are people who feel they have to win at all
costs. They have some kind of ego problem that requires victory to
feed, it just doesn't occur to them that their "victory" means
nothing.</P>
<P>Third, as I mentioned above, the appearance on the Internet scene of
freemail accounts have contributed to this. It is trivially easy for
one person to get email accounts that appear to be different people,
and register on the judges as different people. </P>
<P>What can be done about the problem? There was a rather heated
discussion on the judge-maint list (a mailing list for people
interested in working with the judge software, etc.) about the
possibility of implementing assorted technical and non-technical
solutions, ranging from banning all freemail accounts from the judges
to assigning someone to register people by snail-mail. However, we
pretty much reached the conclusion that there was no system that
couldn't be beaten by someone determined to do it, and the challenge
of trying to beat it might actually attract the interest of certain
types of people. So, I think the solution is to lay out the problem,
and try to convince people to play fairly. That is what I'm trying to
do with this article, and if I can convince one person who might
otherwise have tried to cheat, then I think this article will be well
worth it.</P>
<P>If you have thought about the possibility of joining a game using
multiple identities, please think again. First of all, you will be
wasting the time of the other players, the GM, and the Judge Keeper
(who may have to get involved in determining whether or not you've
been cheating). Second, any victory you gain this way will be
meaningless; if you really think about it, how can you get any
satisfaction from beating up on other players who never had a chance to
begin with? Third, if you get caught, you will lose the opportunity to
play on the judges. The Judge Keeper will bar you from playing on his
judge, and share your identity with other Judge Keepers so they can do
the same. Is it really worth it? Those who cheat aren't being clever
or cool; they're simply being nuisances to the community. It is so
much more satisfying to win when you have done so through your own
efforts at diplomacy and strategy.</P>
