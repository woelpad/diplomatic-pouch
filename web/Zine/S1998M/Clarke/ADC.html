dialect' might be a bit mystifying</i></H3>

<p>


<P>Brandon wondered:
<BR>>
<BR>> So??????????
<BR>>
<BR>> How did the ADC go?

<P>Doubtless others will produce a more fact-based summary, but I can fill
you in on a bit of gossip and innuendo if you like.
Hmm.&nbsp; I'd love to hear you *say* innuendo.

<P>Oddysey began with Bill, Jason and myself heading off in Bill's car
on Friday morning.&nbsp; Got McDonalds and petrol in Albury (you
have to wash it down with something) and got to Canberra at about 4:30.
At this stage South Africa after plundering the attack early
were slowing down a bit. <I>[The first of many references to the cricket
in this article. Cricket is not a sport, it is a religion in this part
of the world.]</I>

<P>Went to Cancon headquarters to enrol.&nbsp; Insulted by two Convention
Organisers (not just me, hobby at large).&nbsp; Told we'd been
relocated from the main building to somewhere else entirely. <I>[The
ADC is held as part of CANCON, a large games convention held in Canberra
every Australia Day long weekend.]</I>

<P>Went back to Toad Hall to find half the hobby playing Junta in&nbsp;
40 degree heat and drinking heavily. <I>[That's 40 degrees Celcius, which
is over 100 degrees in Yankeespeak.]</I>&nbsp; Australia batting by this
stage, Ponting is a legend.<I>[cricket again...]</I>&nbsp; Ken and I go
looking for pizza. Canberra doesn't seem to have any idea about pizza.&nbsp;
They sell it from the back of a video arcade and don't know what Cappriciosa
means. The "not very hungry" Rohan Keane makes his first stab of the weekend
and eats four of the six pizzas.

<P>Moved downstairs to slightly cooler TV room.&nbsp; Australia snatch
defeat from the jaws of victory.&nbsp; Rob Stephenson owes almost
everybody a slab of beer. <I>[SLAB: n. 1. A tray of beer, consisting
of two dozen cans. 2. Enough beer for two people for an afternoon.]</I>
Complete evening with a game of Shark.
<H3>
Day One</H3>
Bright and early start after an appalling night trying to sleep in a Toad
Hall bed in heat and noise and bright light.&nbsp; GM Ken
looking worse for wear but relatively good for him.&nbsp; He is wearing
a blue vest with a big red S on the front.&nbsp; SuperKen is born.&nbsp;
Off to
venue via McDonalds.

<P>Venue eventually found.&nbsp; Very hot outside, very cold inside.&nbsp;
Ill-advised idea to base game names on pizza varieties (possibly my
fault).&nbsp; 4 boards redrawn as 5 boards when a few stragglers wander
in. 30 players and 5 GM positions.&nbsp; I am happy with England.
On another board, Rohan is much happier with Italy.&nbsp; Likewise
on a third for Craig and Germany.&nbsp; Two wins narrowly averted. Low
rumblings about scoring system begin. <I>[A new scoring system is making
it's debut on the Australian Tournament scene...]</I>

<P>Mid afternoon we find out that our amusing Convention organisers have
not booked us in for the whole day.&nbsp; Forced to move to a
corridor with no air-conditiong for round two.&nbsp; Dinner at McDonalds
on the way.&nbsp; I am happy with Turkey but unhappy with Harry.
Rohan is on a roll and again has to be stopped from a win with Russia.&nbsp;
33 centres in 2 games.&nbsp; The day goes late, with the last
game time drawing at almost 11pm.&nbsp; Round included a (non-playing)
cameo appearance by Neil and Marion Ashworth, hobby
legends at large. Everybody too tired by this time to complain about
the scoring system.

<P>Back at Toad Hall we play Shark and learn about the effects of Sambucca
on the devout.&nbsp; Several of us pronounced "terrible".
Possibly true. A game of Junta begins at 3am.&nbsp; I decline.&nbsp;
Not much easier to sleep, the heat noise and light being joined by little
plastic pieces dancing around behind my eyelids.
<H3>
Day Two</H3>
A much appreciated late start.&nbsp; We began with the DAA AGM at 11ish.
<I>[DAA = <A HREF="http://thingy.apana.org.au/~ozdip/">Diplomacy Association
of Australia.</A>]</I>&nbsp; In with the old, out with the new.&nbsp; Anticipated
appearance by Friends of the DAA guerilla group fails to eventuate.&nbsp;
Our esteemed figurehead retains his figure but the functional positions
are landed on new suckers.

<P>Round three sees me unhappy with Austria and even less happy with the
direction of the game.&nbsp; I am reminded that only 3 of the 4
games count to your final score and proclaim this one Numero Quattro.
Rohan Flavelle is incomprehesibly put on the Novice Board
and is narrowly prevented from a win as Austria.&nbsp; Andrew Goff's
16 as France is found to score less than Harry's 13 as France, and
this decides the Best France trophy. Protests about the scoring system
start in earnest.

<P>It's raining in Sydney, and nobody is playing cricket.&nbsp; The tournament
retires to Goff Mansion to enjoy the remarkable hospitality of
Andrew and Chris' mum.&nbsp; Family Business is played, much food and
alcohol consumed, The Piano is watched with the sound down
and Ken commentating. Ken and Rob dance to Peter Allen, as performed
by Ken.

<P>Later in the evening after a pitstop at Toad Hall the revelry sets out
to conquer Greater Canberra.&nbsp; Dance floors take a beating,
policemen take a pounding, and good sense takes a holiday.&nbsp; Rob
Stephenson and James "You're TERRIBLE" Bounsall narrowly
avoid going home in the back of a divvy van <I>[For an explanation
of what a 'divvy van' is, <A HREF="../../W1997A/Clarke/Don.html#divvy">click here</A>
to go to my article reviewing my recent trip to Australia to play Diplomacy
and watch cricket which was published in the winter adjustments issue of
The Pouch.] </I>(by in fact *asking* a policeman if they could, while punching
him...).&nbsp; Bottles of the World's Cheapest Sambucca are bought and
consumed.&nbsp; Back at Toad Hall it is discovered that there are slightly
more people than rooms.&nbsp; The fish-gutting Sambucca-chugging tournament-leading
Keane is assigned the common-room floor.
<H3>
Day Three (Australia Day)</H3>
I awake at about 8:30, surprised at the lack of noise (the round is supposed
to start at 9 sharp [hoho]).

<P>I step over Rohan and knock on a few doors to see if in fact the tournament
is still on.&nbsp; Ken doesn't look sure but says, probably,
yes. He steps over Rohan and goes to get ready.&nbsp; Rob who is theoretically
driving to the venue <i>and</i> back to Melbourne that day
wanders in with his eyes apparently unable to open.&nbsp; He steps
on Rohan.

<P>Rob's car has apparently been hitting the piss all night as well.&nbsp;
It refuses to start.&nbsp; After much cajoling and more swearing it finally
relents and we head off.&nbsp; SuperKen has by this time lost the draw
and has to redo it.&nbsp; At the venue we discover enough players for
an extra board.&nbsp; SuperKen does the draw again.

<P>I am unhappy with Italy, even less happy with the alliance which had
squashed me the day before reappearing as Russia and
Turkey, but my mood is somewhat improved by their apparent desire to
kill eachother. Harry's England receives a Frenchman in the
Channel and a German in the North Sea.&nbsp; Harry is narrowly prevented
from an 18.&nbsp; Seriously.

<P>Calculations take a little while, during wich people amuse themselves
by criticising the scoring system.&nbsp; The final places will
doubtless be published, but Rohan Keane is the new National Champion,
quite&nbsp; comfortably ahead of last year's winner Harry
Kolotas.

<P>Most people depart after the tournament is finished.&nbsp; See you all
in Melbourne at Easter guys.&nbsp; A few of us with a bit more time on
our hands go back to Toad Hall to watch Australia keep South Africa
to a reasonable total. <I>[More cricket.]</I> Another trip to McDonald's
for tea is followed by a walk around Canberra in anticipation of the big
Australia Day celebrations.&nbsp; Our nation's capital seems to have other
ideas, as the people are substantially outnumbered by tumbleweeds and the
footpaths have all been rolled up.&nbsp; Typically, the fireworks start
when we aren't watching and finish just as we find out where they were.
Meanwhile Australia are successfully chasing the South African total. Gillo
and Ponting are legends. <I>[Gillo &amp; Ponting are Australian cricket
players...obviously doing well at this juncture...in Dugal's humble (humble?)
opinion.]</I>

<P>The next day Jason, Andrew Goff and I join Bill for the trip home.&nbsp;
Once again we stop for McDonalds and petrol at Albury.
Unfortunately our attempts to listen to the deciding cricket final
just outside of Euroa seem to anger the car gods and the timing gear
in Bill's engine spontaneously rusts.&nbsp; My opinion of mobile phones
is somewhat improved as Andrew's allows us to call for a tow.
Luckily the problem only required a few hours work so we spent the
afternoon playing cards and pool and watching the cricket in
Euroa's pub.&nbsp; Home by 10, just in time to watch the last two overs
of <b>AUSTRALIA'S MAGNIFICENT WIN IN THE CARLTON AND
UNITED ONE DAY INTERNATIONAL SERIES!</b></p>
