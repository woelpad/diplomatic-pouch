<blockquote><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> While the original version of this case was already presented in an earlier issue, new research has provided a better solution than the one that was originally offered. We therefore are publishing this interesting tale from Watson's memoirs once again, and invite our readers to deduce the new improved answer, if they can!</i></blockquote>

"It is indeed  good to be back," I remarked to my friend Sherlock Holmes.
I had just returned to the city after a week spent caring for an
acquaintance of mine who had taken ill on his country estate, and Holmes
had welcomed me back by inviting me along on a visit to the Calhamer
Club.  The great detective had been summoned to dine there by a mutual
friend.  Given that the topic of their discussion was to be the care and feeding
of potted ferns (a subject in which I held no interest), and as my
stomach was still somewhat unsettled&nbsp;&mdash; a result of the ride back to
the city&nbsp;&mdash;
I informed Holmes that I would be more than happy to accompany him to the
Club, but that I would insist upon excusing myself from sharing his meal.
I was looking forward to a relaxing hour or more, spent in the library
of the Club reading or conversing with some of my fellow members.  Perhaps,
I thought, once Holmes had satisfied his appetites for vegetation (both
culinary and conversational), a game of <b>Diplomacy</b> could be played.  It
seemed just the thing to calm my mind after the jarring ride through the
countryside.
<p align=justify>
As it was mid-day, the Club was nearly deserted, and what few gentlemen
were afoot were escorting business companions to lunch in the expansive
dining room.  Holmes and I walked through the empty <b>Diplomacy</b> rooms, and as
we passed a
gaming table, I heard Holmes mutter to himself:
"Interesting position."
<p align=justify>
Wishing to see what had inspired this thought, I paused to look at the board
that Holmes had found so remarkable.
<P>
<center><table border=5><tr><td><img src=map.gif></td></tr></table></center>
<p align=justify>
I felt obliged to stop my friend in
his tracks.
"Why, Holmes!" I exclaimed. "This game has not even begun!  What can possibly be
so interesting about the position?"
<p align=justify>
Holmes smiled.  "Ah, yes.  You have been tending to your profession, and are
not acquainted
with the latest dispatch from our friend the Sultan of Suwat."  Checking his
pocket-watch, Holmes saw that he had sufficient time to explain what I had
missed while I was away from London.
<p align=justify>
"The Sultan, as you know, is fond of setting interesting terms for the
British Crown to meet in order to continue the lease that His Majesty's
government holds on the valuable naval station at the Port of Suwat.
The terms always
involve the Sultan's favourite pastime, the game of <b>Diplomacy</b>."
<p align=justify>
"Yes, I am well aware of all this, Holmes.  In fact, I have
written many times of the assistance you have rendered to the Foreign Office,
in tales I have entitled
<a href=/Zine/S1995M/Woolley/Puzzle.html><i>The Double-Elimination Conundrum,</i></a>
<a href=/Zine/S1996M/Holmes><i>The Hunt for the Venison Camper,</i></a>
<a href=/Zine/F1997R/Holmes/sultan.html><i>The Dead-Letters Affair,</i></a> and
<a href=/Zine/W1997A/Holmes/refugee.html><i>The Case of the Suwati Refugee.</i></a>"
<p align=justify>
"Quite so, Watson.  Well, as it happens, the position on this board matches
the position in the Sultan's latest directive to His Majesty, and contains
a fair amount of interest indeed."
<p align=justify>
"Perhaps news travels slowly outside the city, Holmes, but I was not aware
that the Sultan had once again made a demand for the extension of the lease."
<p align=justify>
"It is not general knowledge, Watson.  A courier has been sent to secure
the extension by obtaining the Sultan's signature. I am sure that once
this has been accomplished, the members of the press in Fleet Street
will be informed.  However, the
Foreign Office found itself unable to determine from the Sultan's
instructions exactly where the courier should be sent.  Perhaps if I give
these same instructions to you" &mdash; Holmes once again checked his timepiece &mdash;
"you might find it entertaining to preoccupy yourself with them while I take
my sustenance."
<p align=justify>
Still wondering what possible problem concerning the initial game setup had
apparently confounded no less than Lord Fortescue, the Foreign Secretary,
I eagerly
accepted what amounted to a challenge from my friend.
<p align=justify>
Holmes turned from the
entrance to the dining hall and joined me at the table where I stood looking
at the <b>Diplomacy</b> board.  "While I would agree, Watson, that the best evidence
would indicate
that the game we find on this table has yet to begin, we can of course
only draw such a conclusion from induction.  There is, after all, nothing that
definitively establishes that the game has not progressed beyond the first
move.  That is, we cannot say with any degree of certainty &mdash; we cannot
deduce &mdash; that this game has not already begun."
<p align=justify>
I furrowed my brow.  "I suppose not, Holmes.
I suppose that for all we know,
the game-year could be 1915, and each power has issued <tt>HOLD</tt> orders
for the first fourteen years.  While I do not see why such a thing
might have taken place, I am forced to admit that it is a possibility."
Holmes nodded silently as I went on.
"Another possibility is that the
powers have not simply held their places; that some movement has
occurred, and the powers have perhaps even
taken possession of some neutral supply centres, but have all, for whatever
reason,
returned their pieces to their original sites and have chosen not to
exercise their rights to build."
<p align=justify>
"Yes, Watson, we cannot say that this board has not come to rest in this
position in exactly that way.
However, what if I were to give you &mdash;
just as the Sultan (in his usual cryptic way) gave the Foreign Secretary &mdash;
<!-- (in the usual cryptic way that the Sultan has, of course) -->
the following facts about this game?
<ul>
<li>First, that every home supply centre now contains
a different piece than was positioned there at the beginning of the game.</li>
<li>Second, that no neutral supply centre is yet owned, and every power
owns all of its home supply centres.</li>
<li>Third, that the next turn for this game will be the earliest possible
turn in which the two conditions I just described could possibly hold true."</li>
</ul>
<p align=justify>
I stood looking at the board and I believe a smile came to my face.
"Fascinating, Holmes!  An interesting position, indeed!"  After a short
pause, I had an insight.
"Ah!" I exclaimed. "I believe I am on to the old Sultan's trick!
This could be a variant game; perhaps an
1898 game, in which the players start out with only one unit on the board
and each must take possession
of his own home centres before earning the right to build!"
<p align=justify>
"Very good, Watson.  However, although (as you say) the game we
see on the table before us could perhaps be a variant,
the game that the Sultan described is indeed a completely standard game
of <b>Diplomacy</b>; it is not a variant in any way."
<p align=justify>
"I see," I said, a bit dejected, but beginning to take a keen interest
in how the feat Holmes had described could be accomplished.  "I presume
that the Sultan's instructions involved delivering to him some intelligence
about the moves leading to this position."
<p align=justify>
"Quite so, Watson.  The Sultan informed us that he would be expecting His
Majesty's courier to convey the lease extension to the Suwati embassy that
is located at the one space on the board into which a unit was
retreated.  It is there that the Sultan will affix
his signature to the instrument.
As I mentioned, Lord Fortescue requested my assistance
in determining where the Sultan awaits."
<p align=justify>
"Interesting, indeed, Holmes!" said I, as I pulled a chair up to the
<b>Diplomacy</b> table and bent my head to a study of the board.
Knowing that Holmes would
be forced to take his leave soon, I hoped to make my first deductions while he
was within earshot, and I began to reflect aloud on the problem, as much to my
friend as to myself.  "The requirement is to place into every one of the
home supply centres a piece different from &mdash; but of
the same type and nationality as &mdash; the piece that started the game there.
Additionally, when this position is reached, all supply centres must be
owned and unowned just as at they are the game's start.  This must all be
done as quickly as possible."
I glanced at Holmes to make sure that I understood the problem well.
He nodded, indicating that I had indeed.
<!-- adding, "incidentally, Watson, two of the powers must accomplish
the feat one year sooner than do the other five." -->
<p align=justify>
I continued my examination of the board.
"It seems to me that the most time-consuming task will be swapping
the position of the two Russian fleets.  The time it takes to do so will,
I imagine, give me the timespan in which the feat must be accomplished.
The quickest sail from Sevastopol to St. Petersburg (or vice-versa) will take"
&mdash; I paused to count the spaces &mdash; "thirteen moves."
<p align=justify>
Holmes was smiling, but
I could not discern whether it was a smile of amusement
or if he was actually pleased with my initial effort.
"Without passing judgment on your intrepid beginning, Watson, might I say
simply that I believe you will have quite a busy hour."
<p align=justify>
With this, and with a final look at his pocket-watch, Holmes turned and
started again for the dining hall.  "There is one more detail, Watson," my
friend said over his shoulder, "A rather important detail, in fact.
The Sultan specified not only that the
conditions must be met as quickly as possible, but with as many
dislodgements as possible.
You see, in order to secure the extension of the lease, our courier
must accurately report the total number of dislodgements to the Sultan."

{
alert("\"Watson,\" remarked Holmes, \"although the Sultan did not\n" +
"make any requirements of these details, I did find some\n" +
"facts surrounding the solution most interesting, and I\n" +
"imagine that you will as well.\n\n" +
//		"\"Two units could conceivably have retreated without\n" +
//		"making the position unattainable.  The Sultan, of course,\n" +
//		"informed us that only one unit did so.\n\n" +
"\"Firstly, it is the case that no supply centre ever changes\n" +
"hands throughout the course of the puzzle.\n\n" +
"\"Additionally, at the conclusion of the puzzle, three powers\n" +
"no longer possess even a single one of their original pieces.\n\n" +
"\"Further, one of the powers may actually have reached\n" +
"its final position a full game-year earlier than the others.\n\n" +
//		"\"In fact, one of the powers, at one point in the game, had\n" +
//		"absolutely no units on the board!\n\n" +
"\"Finally, as many as three of the powers actually may have\n" +
"failed to submit orders during a movement phase, suffering\n" +
"all of their pieces to HOLD, while all of this was accomplished.\n\n" +
"\"Quite an interesting position, indeed!\"");

Can you beat Dr. Watson to the solution?
Your task is to exactly recreate the starting position
of the game, without a single unit in the same location where it began
the game.
How quickly can it be done, and how many dislodgements can be made in the
process?  Equally important, where oh where is the Sultan waiting?

...If you feel it would help you, Holmes did briefly step away from the table to
