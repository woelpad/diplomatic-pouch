<p>Recently I’ve been making my inevitable relapse, I mean return, to the <b>Diplomacy</b>
game and its community. This time the addiction was reactivated by playing a Face
to Face game with a friend who has recently discovered the game.</p>

<p>That friend, Victor, and his roommate Jim &#8212; in addition to being a blast to play
with (I was France in a 6-player game that ended a bit too early to see what would
ultimately happen) &#8212; mentioned that they were playing online. And it was through a
site that I’d never heard of.</p>

<p>Now, I’ve been around in the online <b>Diplomacy</b> scene. I discovered the judges in the
mid-90s, when one could suggest they were at a peak. I also played real-time games
on AOL (and via the judges) and used some <b>Diplomacy</b> computer game that came
out in the late 90s to play real-time games that way. In the 21st century, I’ve tried
some of the websites that were out there &#8212; and never really felt “grabbed” by any of
them.</p>

<p>What I found at PDO was a site with an awesome interface &#8212; something that was
fully clickable, on which I could update orders AND diplome with my smartphone.
The only downside to the site seems to be that the player traffic is pretty low!</p>

<p>It’s a shame, because this is the best non-judge-related web-based <b>Diplomacy</b>
interface I’ve ever played on. (I still maintain you’re ultimately better off with
something like USAK , but that’s only because Chris Babcock bribed me to include
that statement in this article.)</p>

<p>I spoke (virtually) with Jon Grover, one of the site’s three developers. When asked
why his team felt the need to create a new way to play <b>Diplomacy</b> on the web, Jon
said, “I think the thing that really drove us to make our own version was a feeling
that none of the current big versions had very much in the way of what you might
call "Web 2.0" sensibility.”</p>

<p>And that sensibility is there in a big way. Today, waiting on my wife at a doctor’s
appointment, I got a whole “round” of <b>Diplomacy</b> in! Granted, it was riddled with
autocorrect fails and half baked thoughts, but it was still a cool experience!</p>

<p>Jon and his team &#8212; consisting of himself, Toby and Lee &#8212; say that they
are “headquartered at any bar with free wifi in Seattle, WA.” They built the site over
three or four years by way of weekly “Hack Nights”.</p>

<p>Jon says he likes the traffic they’ve been getting, but that they would like a lot more
&#8212; and their server could handle it.</p>

<p>As for how my game on the site is going, don’t ask. It’s a cruel thing to re-addict
a man to <b>Diplomacy</b> and then let terrible, terrible things happen to him! But I
absolutely love the interface and while I will continue to make judge games my main
medium of play, I will absolutely keep a game going on this site at all times.</p>

<p>I want to quote a few of my friends on what they like about this site.</p>

<p>Old friend and <b>Diplomacy</b> buddy (we discovered the game together) Aaron Dixon:</p>

<blockquote><i>

<p>The interface is very modern and intuitive; I don't think I've ever clicked anywhere for
a task and got an unexpected result.</p>

<p>The map is simple, yet includes all the information you'd need, all in one place. It
would be nice to be able to type orders instead of having to click, though.</p>

<p>I also wish orders and press could be submitted via email &#8212; having to log into the site
for this isn't always ideal, especially from a smartphone. I can't really comment on
the players' experience/skill, as I'm only one season into the game. If I get stabbed,
though, my analysis will be that they all suck.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Victor Larsen, the guy that rooked me into this whole mess:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>[Another major web-based interface <b>Diplomacy</b> server he’s played on has] bad
interface for checking current moves, reviewing past moves, and entering moves. Press
interface was also frustrating, and press wasn't locked during phases in which it was
supposed to be locked.</p>

<p>[PDO’s] map feature is really clean, and the arrows make reviewing moves easy, the
red outlining of failed moves makes reviewing past moves easy, and the build/disband
interface makes it super obvious what options are available. I like that press is locked
during phases that disallow press.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>Jim Munch, the guy that discovered the site with a very solid Googling effort:</p>

<blockquote><i>
<p>There are some problems with the interface but I guess what I like is that it functions.
It has problems with not providing feedback on unintentional moves (I understand
that it is "part of the game" to put in bad moves on purpose, but sometimes its not
intentional, and I have already run into one instance where I have input something
incorrectly. It didn't cost me anything but it is still frustrating). The press is nicely set
up and is anonymous if you want to keep it that way when playing with friends. My
only beef is that you cant scroll down the press window while keeping the map visible
at the top of the page. I'm sure this is something that could be fixed in time.</p>
</i></blockquote>

<p>These guys are all very tech-oriented guys and would be very discerning about what
venue on which they played the game. So you can definitely take them at their word.
Come join us &#8212; we’re all waiting for you at PDO, <strong><a href="http://playdiplomacyonline.com">playdiplomacyonline.com</a></strong>!</p>

<p><b>Postscript:</b></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Despite the fact that this article was written at a low point, I actually ended my game 
in a 3-way draw as Austria&#8230; following a nasty Italian fake-Lepanto stab which claimed TRI,
 GRE and SER early. The story of how I managed to live to eliminate him is for my next article! ;-)</p></li>

<li><p>Let the buyer beware: PDO's interface does not allow press during retreat or adjustment phases. 
Since writing this article, I have had complaints from at least one player (an established member 
of the Hobby, so I can't ignore him) about the enforcement of this rule, which was arguably designed 
for Face-to-Face expediency.</p></li>
