<p>Welcome to the Fall 2012 Retreat issue of the Pouch!</p>
<p>I'm sure you're as happy as I am to see that we've managed to gather enough articles to publish a Retreat issue, 
due once again to the efforts of Chris Babcock. This time we're also greatly indebted to Larry Peery, who was kind
 enough to supply us with many of the articles. He was even editor for the issue 59 of <u><i>Diplomacy World</i></u> that provides us with a reprinted article on playing France!</p>
<p>To recognize the contributions of these two stalwart supporters,  we're officially revising the editorial lineup of the Pouch Zine to reflect the duties they have each taken on:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>Editor</b> &#8212; Chris Babcock</p></li>
<li><p><b>Managing editor</b> &#8212; Charles Roburn</p></li>
<li><p><b>Contributing editor</b> &#8212; Larry Peery</p></li>
</ul>
<p>And of course, we're grateful to the other contributors who have provided articles for this issue. It looks like
 the Pouch may be gathering steam once more! </p>
<p>I'm greatly heartened by the way everything has come together this time round. However... (and I bet you know what I'm going to say!), the continuance of the Pouch Zine depends as much as ever on YOU (yes, <b>YOU</b>, sir or madam! <b><u>YOU</u></b>!!) and your contributions to it.  I hope the fact that we seem to be back on track will encourage you to submit your own articles for the next issue (that's Winter 2012 Adjustments, if all goes well!), and for the issue after that, and after that... help us continue to maintain the Pouch Zine as an excellent online resource for avid <b>Diplomacy</b> players!</p>
<h3>Enjoy the Pouch!</h3>
