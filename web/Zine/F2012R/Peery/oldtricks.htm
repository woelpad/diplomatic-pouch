<p>I’ve been playing <b>Diplomacy</b> since 1965, although not much recently. If
you want to know the whole sorted story you can do a Google search on
my name and the word Diplomacy. And then get out of the way because
it’s quite a list, so make sure your printer is full of paper.
<p>Let me let you in on a little secret. As Edi Birsan, Walt Buchanan,
and other real hobby Old Farts will confirm, I am the worst <b>Diplomacy</b>
player of all time, certainly among the old timers.
<p>In all those years of playing all over the FTF, postal, and tournament
hobbies I’ve managed: 
<ol type="n">
<li><p>Two FTF wins: one against such hobby legends
and top players as von Metzke, Rod Walker, Hal Naus, etc. That was in
the mid-1960s; and one against the members of the LTA, a San Francisco
bay area <b>Diplomacy</b> group, that included players like Charles Turner,
James Justin Dygert, and Brian Bailey.  What was memorable about that
game was who was there but wasn’t playing: Issac Asimov and Ray
Bradbury, among others. How decisive was my win? Well, Brian was so
upset he said he’d never play again and took off for Papua New
Guinea’s highlands were he devoted himself to converting the
headhunters to Christianity; and then taught them how to play
<b>Diplomacy</b>.</p></li>  
<li><p>Perhaps a few PBM wins (Most of the early ones got
tossed by Conrad von Metzke when he was BNC), but nothing memorable
comes to mind.</p></li>  
<li><p>Tournament games? I remember two wins that I was
proud of. The first was at a DipCon played in Toronto, Canada where I
actually managed to beat Jerry Falkiner, then one of the best Canadian
players. For once my strategy, tactics, and diplomacy were first-rate.
The second was being part of a three man team that won the World
DipCon Team Championship in Sweden.   If my memory serves, I tried to
play in one of the first PBEM games and was gone in a micro-second. It
just wasn’t my format. What I do know from all this playing over the
last 45 years or so is that I spent a huge amount of time, energy, and
money on the game and hobby. In fact, I calculate that for each supply
center in one of those victories I spent a good part of a professional
lifetime and about four thousand dollars.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>And what do I have to show for it? A garage full of junk and a lot of memories.
Strategy and tactics were never my fortes in <b>Diplomacy</b>. For that
matter, neither was diplomacy, and I wasn’t a terribly good smoozer
either, but when it came to Peeriblah, nobody could sling it as well
as me. And here’s a sample.</p>
<p>Most players make diplomacy and <b>Diplomacy</b> too complicated. It really
isn’t; which is why the game has lasted, remains popular with a
certain kind of person, proves addictive, and drives people nuts.
Let me share this with you.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Strategy is about what you want to do. First, and most obviously, you
want to win. Second, you want to get past that stalemate line. Once
you’ve done that, victory is yours.</p></li>
<li><p>Tactics is about how you achieve your strategic goals. How do you win
and how do you get past that stalemate line?</li>
</ul>
<p>But wanting to win isn’t enough. You also have to want to keep the
other six players from winning. A two-way or a three-way draw isn’t
acceptable.</p>
<p>Getting past those stalemate lines isn’t easy, but it isn’t as
difficult as some people think. But first you have to know what they
are. Do you? If you know each of them, and how to set one up or break
one down, especially if you’re opponents don’t, puts you way ahead of
the game. So, learn the basics, study the maps, and figure out how to
do those two things: how do I set up a stalemate line and how do I
break through one?</p>
<p>And no, I’m not going to tell you either. It’s something you need to
learn for yourself. And by the time you do, you’ll be good enough to
achieve that first goal, winning.
<p>Tactics is how you achieve your goals. Most newbies think that tactics
means how you move pieces around the board. That’s true, but there’s
more to it. A sound knowledge of tactics is what will help you
over-come your opponent(s) strategies and diplomacy. Remember, you’re
playing a game that not only involves moving pieces around a board,
but also involves manipulating other players (solely and in
combinations).</p>
<p>Tactics, especially when it comes to getting past stalemate lines, is
a matter of mechanics. Diplomacy, if there are other players involved,
is also important, but the key factor is mechanics. More players fail
to prevent the establishment of a stalemate line or fail to break
through one because of mechanical errors than any other single cause.
And what do I mean by mechanical errors? Not reading the map correctly
is one. Mis-writing orders is another. Not seizing the key space(s) in
the stalemate line is yet a third. Stalemate lines are all about real
estate, and as any real estate salesman will tell you, the secret in
real estate is “location, location and location.”
<p>This is something you can’t learn from reading articles (like this
one). It’s something you learn by playing or at least reading game
reports (moves, analysis, and press).</p>
<p>It’s impossible to write about S&T without mentioning diplomacy. Good
diplomacy can off-set weaknesses in S&T, but it alone won’t get you to
those first two strategic goals. Good diplomacy may not win you the
game, but bad diplomacy will surely keep you from winning it.
When you’re playing a game you need to push on all three fronts:
strategy, tactics, and diplomacy; and push hardest where you’re being
successful. If one player doesn’t have a solid concept of what a
victory entails, push there. If another doesn’t seem to have a good
grasp of game tactics, push there; and if a third doesn’t seem to be
talking much, push (hard) there.</p>
<p>I can’t guarantee that following these precepts will win you a game,
but I can and do guarantee that following them will help you be a
better player than I am.</p>
<p>Trust me.</p>
