<p>Most readers of The Diplomatic Pouch know what a diplomatic pouch is
but it’s not something we think about every day.  Interestingly, if
you do a Google search on “The Diplomatic Pouch”  this magazine comes
up first. If you do a search on “the diplomatic bag,” the other kind
comes up first. And if you do a search on “ the diplomatic pouch,” the
magazine still comes up first. Aren’t algorithms wonderful?
<p>But, as always, when all the peeriblah is revealed, there’s more to
the story than that.
<p>As Wikipedia says,</p> 

<blockquote><i>“A diplomatic bag, also known as a diplomatic
pouch, is a container with certain legal protections used for carrying
official correspondence or other items between a diplomatic mission
and its home government or other official organizations. The
physical concept of a "diplomatic bag" is flexible and therefore can
take many forms e.g., a cardboard box, briefcase, duffel bag, large
suitcase, crate or even a shipping container. Additionally, a
diplomatic bag usually has some form of lock and/or tamper-evident
seal attached to it in order to deter interference by unauthorised
persons. The most important point is that as long as it is externally
marked to show its status, the "bag" has diplomatic immunity from
search or seizure, as codified in article 27 of the 1961 Vienna
Convention on Diplomatic Relations. It may only contain articles
intended for official use. It need not be a bag; in fact, no size
limit is specified by the convention. It is often escorted by a
diplomatic courier, who is similarly immune from arrest and detention
If you’ve ever flown out of Dulles or JFK airports on an American or
foreign airline you may have seen a courier carrying his bag(s).
</i></blockquote>

<p>Not
all couriers are carrying diplomatic bags, however. As Wikipedia says,
diplomatic bags are clearly marked and extremely sensitive materials
are usually hand-cuffed to the courier.</p>
<p>Wikipedia goes on to list some of the more interesting cases
where diplomatic bags weren’t carrying what you might expect,  “Some
countries with corrupt governments have allegedly used diplomatic
immunity to smuggle drugs, which was mentioned by English journalist
Tony Thompson in his book <b><u><i>Gangs: A Journey into the Heart of the
British Underworld</i></u></b>.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>During World War II, Winston Churchill reportedly received
shipments of Cuban cigars by this means.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1964, a Moroccan-born Israeli double agent named Mordechai
Ben Masoud Louk (also known as Josef Dahan) was drugged, bound, and
placed in a diplomatic bag at the Egyptian Embassy in Rome, but was
rescued by the Italians. The crate that he had been placed in
appeared to have been used for a similar purpose before, possibly for
an Egyptian military official who had defected to Italy several years
before but then disappeared without a trace before reappearing under
Egyptian custody and facing trial.</p></li>
<li><p>During the 1982 Falklands War, the Argentine government used a
diplomatic bag to smuggle several Limpet mines to their embassy in
Spain, to be used in the covert Operation Algeciras, in which
Argentine agents were to blow up a British warship in the Royal Navy
Dockyard at Gibraltar. The plot was uncovered and stopped by the
Spanish Police before the explosives could be set.</p></li>
<li><p>In the 1984 Dikko Affair, a former Nigerian government
minister, was kidnapped and placed in a shipping crate, in an attempt
to transport him from the United Kingdom back to Nigeria for trial.
However, it was not marked as a diplomatic bag, which allowed British
customs to open it.</p></li>
<li><p>In 1984, the Sterling submachine gun used to shoot dead WPC
Yvonne Fletcher from inside the Libyan Embassy in London was smuggled
out of the UK in one of 21 diplomatic bags.</p></li>
<li><p>In March 2000 Zimbabwe created an international incident when
it opened a British diplomatic shipment.</p></li>
<li><p>In May 2008, a replacement pump for the toilet on the
International Space Station was sent in a diplomatic pouch from Russia
to the United States in order to arrive before liftoff of the next
shuttle mission.</p></li>
<li><p>In 2012, a 16 kg shipment of cocaine was sent to the United
Nations in New York in a bag masquerading as a diplomatic pouch.
<li><p>In January 2012, Italy detected 40 kilograms of cocaine
smuggled in a diplomatic pouch from Ecuador, arresting five. Ecuador
insisted it had inspected the shipment for drugs at the foreign
ministry before it was sent to Milan.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>But the story doesn’t end there. It never does.
<p>Just this past August it was revealed that a diplomatic bag had been
found in the French Alps after 46 years. The bag was on an Air India
flight that crashed on Mount Blanc. The bag and other debris were
found on the Bossons glacier (Do a Google search for more information
and some pictures of the glacier and mountain), apparently uncovered
as the glacier melted due to global warming.
<p>As for the accident, a Boeing 707 operating Air India Flight 101
crashed into Mont Blanc on Jan. 24, 1966, as it was en route from
Mumbai to New York with several scheduled stops en route. The flight
was headed from Beirut to Geneva, Switzerland, when the crash
occurred. The death toll from the crash included all 106 passengers
and 11 crew.

PARIS &#8212; As the Alpine glacier melted, a curious discovery emerged
after decades beneath the ice: a plane wheel, a shoe – and an intact
pouch of Indian diplomatic mail from 1966.
<p>It all appears to be part of the wreckage from an Air India plane
crash that hikers and a rescue worker found this week on the slopes
beneath Mont Blanc.
<p>News reports said, “Rescuer Arnaud Christmann said the hikers alerted
the tourist office in Chamonix that they had seen something beneath a
glacier that looked like a wheel. He went to investigate and found
pieces of the plane and "a gift from the mountain," a bag containing
Indian and English newspapers, including a copy of the first issue of
an American Diplomacy journal named XENOGOGIC  from 1966 and other
documents, labeled "diplomatic mail; as well as a Mount Blanc pen in
perfect working order.
<p>Who knows? Perhaps as the ice melts further we’ll learn more about the
plane’s crash. Intriguingly, on board the plane was Dr. Homi J.
Bhabha, known as “the father of Indian nuclear programme” or “India’s
Oppenheimer.”
<p>What we do know is that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan, known as Dr. A. Q.
Khan, whose named in Urdu means “Savior of Pakistan,” and colloquially
regarded as the founder of HEU based Gas-centrigue uranium enrichment
programme for Pakistan’s integrated atomic bomb project, and who is
regarded as “a serious proliferation risk” by the US Government
cancelled his flight from Islamabad to Beijing on China Southern
Airways Flight 007, with an on-going flight to Pyongyang, North Korea
scheduled for August 23, 2012. Not confirmed yet is a report that the
CSA flight would have been carrying a courier with a diplomatic pouch
from the Chinese embassy in Islamabad to Beijing. Perhaps Dr. Khan
knew something we don’t.
