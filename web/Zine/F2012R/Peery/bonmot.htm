<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>If you’re not familiar with my “dip & Dip” writing a word of
explanation may be in order. For nearly fifty years I have been
intrigued or at least fascinated by the twin worlds of “real
diplomacy, aka Henry Kissinger’s Realpolitik,” and “<b>Diplomacy</b>,” Allan
B. Calhamer’s classic game. My writings are usually devoted a subject
drawn from one or the other, occasionally both, which can be very
simple or very complex, as a Google search, or a look through The
Diplomacy Archives, TDP, or DW will show.  As I age I find I’m drawing
less and less on my memory and more and more on Google and Wikipedia
for background information,  although my personal  <b>Diplomacy</b> archives,
library, and input from others, and current events also heavily
influences my writing. By the way, I won’t make it easy for you by
providing all the links to items I found online. I want you to get
used to doing your own searches. You’ll find a lot more interesting
stuff that way.  So, on with this story.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve always been interested in greatness in diplomacy and <b>Diplomacy</b>,
particularly the human side of it.  How real diplomats practice their
trade, how Dippers play the game, and those rare occasions when one
person does both fascinate me; and hopefully they will you to.  As I
often do when beginning to write an article I did several searches on
Google  using different word combinations to see what would come up.
 <p>For example:
<p>A GOOGLE SEARCH ON SECRETS OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL DIPLOMATS,
CHARACTERISTICS OF GREAT DIPLOMATS, and WORLD’S GREATEST DIPLOMATS;
led to the following conclusion: GREATNESS REVISITED, OR HOW I TOPPED
THE GOOGLE LISTINGS, The last search led to the following article, SO
WHO WERE THE GREATEST “REAL” DIPLOMATS OF THE LAST MILLENNIUM, ANYWAY?
Which was the first article listed.  That article appeared in winter
1999 issue of TDP. <a href="../../W1999A/Peery/bestdips.html">You might want to read it 
before going further</a>. Got it?
<h2>I'll Let You In On A Little Secret Henry Kissinger Taught Me&#8230;</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>TIME FOREIGN RELATIONS: WHAT IS A DIPLOMAT?</b>

<p>Time magazine’s website links to its archives which is a valuable
research tool for anyone interested in diplomacy. My search came up
with FOREIGN RELATIONS: WHAT IS A DIPLOMAT? From August 1957 which
included the usual Machiavelli, Talleyrand, and John Foster Dulles
(the US Secretary of State at that time) quotes.  My favorite line in
the story was, “Also last week he learned that he was the object of a
nightclub torch song called I Made a Fool of Myself Over John Foster
Dulles. Singer: pert Texas Redhead Carol Burnett (Yes, THAT Carol
Burnett!), 24, at Manhattan’s Blue Angel. Check out the story for
sample lyrics or Wikipedia.
<li><b>STEPHEN COYEY’S “SEVEN SECRETS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE”, 1989,</b>
<p>Any author who can sell 25 million copies of a book in 40 languages is
worth a read, and will no doubt attract imitators and critics. Covey
still manages to do both over 20 years later.
<li><b>THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DIPLOMATS</b>, by Quentin E. Hodgson, 2008
<p>Hodgson reviews a new book by Dennis Ross offering a Bush and Clinton
era look at the effectiveness of American diplomacy.
<li><b>MANAGEMENT GURU STEPHEN COVEY DIES AT 79</b>, by Valli Meenakshi Ramanathan, 2012
<p>Ramanathan reports Covey’s death from complications resulting from a
bicycle accident at age 79. What a way and time to go.
<li><b>SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE DIPLOMATS</b>, by Parag Khanna, The New
American Foundation, 2011</b>
<p>Khanna sounds like a Henry Kissinger or Fareed Zakaria wannabe. His
article retools Covey’s  self-help strategies for those seeking to
influence global affairs: 1) Be Proactive, 2) Begin With the End in
Mind, 3) Put First Things First, 4) Think Win/Win, 5) Seek First to
Understand, Then to be Understood; 6) Synergize, 7) Sharpen the Saw.
Khanna is a senior research fellow at The New American Foundation.
Never heard of it? Neither had I. But it’s worth checking out its
website and especially taking a look at where its money is coming from
and how much some of those people, businesses, or groups are donating
to it.
<li><b>MOSH PIT DIPLOMACY</b>, by Stephanie Giry,  NY Times, 2011
<p>There aren’t a lot of articles online criticizing Khanna,  but there
are some, and this is one of the firey ones . Stephanie  Giry, from
Foreign Affairs magazine, goes after Khanna’s two highly successful
books, “The Second World,” and “How to Run the World.”  For some
reason whenever someone tries to combine an academic and populist
approach to diplomacy they get shot at.

<li><b>THE SEVEN ELEMENTS OF CHARISMA</b>, West Side Los Angeles Toastmasters
<p>Quick, name a Dipper who has charisma. My first choices were Conrad
von Metzke, Rod Walker, and Edi Birsan. No surprises there. Then I
decided that Chris Martin also had it. In fact he was the perfect
example of a charismatic Dipper in his prime. The others are all well
past their prime. Well, maybe except for Edi. Charisma, by the way, is
a noun defined as “a personal attractiveness that enables you to
influence others.” Westside Toastmasters lists these seven elements of
charisma: 
<ol type="n"><li>Presence (refers to the quality of commanding respectful
attention) <li> Regal Bearing (The manner in which one carries or
conducts oneself), <li>Manner (A way of acting or behaving), <li>Finesse
 (Refinement and delicacy of performance, execution, or artisanship),
<li>Enigma (An action, mode of action, or thing, which cannot be
satisfactorily explained), <li>Diplomacy (Tact and skill in dealing
with people, subtly skillful handling of a situation involving
others), <li>Allure (The power to entice or attract through personal
charm). Does that sound like you? If so, you have charisma; and
chances are you’re a good Dipper. I highly recommend this article to
you. Oh, by the way, Chris Martin is NOT a member of Toastmasters, but
Edi Birsan is.
</ol>
</ul>
<h2>Characteristics of a Good Diplomat?</h2>
<p>One of those “ask us stupid questions” sites came up with the
following characteristics of a good diplomat: Patience, Sharp
intellect, Strong will, Good poker face, Ability to hold one’s drink,
and not bothered by cigar smoke. Former US Secretary of State Warren
Christopher is universally regarded as having the best poker face in
modern diplomacy. Somebody once said if World War III broke out and
told Christopher he’d probably blink once. If the world was going to
end within the next 24 hours and told him, he’d probably blink twice.
Another good line, “Otto von Bismarck” insisted that German diplomats
practiced drinking champagne and chain smoking cigars so as to get
used to the atmosphere and conditions of international diplomacy. This
still holds good today – Russian, Chinese, and other Asian politicians
are all heavy smokers and drinkers.” Which raises an interesting
question, “Why haven’t we ever had a DipCon event in Bismarck, North
Dakota?”
<ul>
<li><b>COMMON DENOMINATORS OF GOOD AMBASSADORS</b>, Karl Gruber, ediplomat website, 2012
<p>Karl Gruber served as Austrian Foreign Minister and Austrian
Ambassador to the United States, Spain, Switzerland, and West Germany.
And yes, if you’re wondering, one of his ancestors helped write Silent
Night. Gruber lists the following positive common denominators for
diplomats: good communicator, effective habits of cooperation,
thorough knowledge of their own country and the country of their
assignment, well-rounded view of the world, precision,  a sense of
humor, a sense of discretion, good judgment, and the following
negative ones: provincialism, ethnocentricity, inability to understand
nuances in foreign countries, and the belief that one’s own country is
the best in everything are handicaps which, after a certain age, no
amount of training r experience can overcome.  Sounds like a formula
for success in a <b>Diplomacy</b> tournament, doesn’t it?
<li><b>THE SEVEN HABITS OF HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL UNDER SECRETARIES</b>, by Brian
Carlson, Public Diplomacy Council, 2012
<p>This article, highly recommended, offers an insider’s view of what
makes a high-ranking diplomat (an under  secretary is the second
ranking person in the State Department and is often the highest rank
career diplomat) successful: Habit 1: Remember that it is all about
“the field.” Habit 2: The most important thing the Under Secretary can
do for the field is --- are you ready? Can you guess?---“send money.”
Well, to be accurate, “send resources.” Habit 3: The next most
important thing the Under Secretary can do for the field, and
therefore for public diplomacy, is to restrain Washington. Habit 4:
The Under Secretary’s target audience is at the other end of
Constitution Avenue. That is, on Capitol Hill. Habit 5: that
discussion of chutzpah and being proactive leads to a mini-analysis of
the State Department’s organizational culture. Habit 6: Mention of the
military reminds that the State Department does not own “public
diplomacy. Habit 7: Lastly, in the inter-agency, you can lead, but you
cannot direct.
<li><b>THE GREATEST UNDERSTATED U.S. DIPLOMAT</b>, by Nikolas Kralev, 2011
<p>The author offers William J. Burns, deputy secretary of state, an
interesting example of what a modern State Department bureaucrat
should be.
<li><b>ZHENG HE: ANCIENT CHINA’S GREATEST DIPLOMAT?</b>, by Kunming College of
Eastern Language,  2012
<p>To be honest, I’d never heard of Zheng He until I read Gavin Menzie’s
two books 1421 and 1434 (Check out his web site for more information),
but afterwards I was fascinated by  Zheng  He. You may be as well
after you read this article, especially if you’ve been following the
recent news about China’s first aircraft-less aircraft carrier and its
rapidly expanding Blue Water navy. Read the Zheng He story and then
compare it with Chou En-lai and you decide which was China’s greatest
diplomat ever &#8212; not to mention what kind of Dipper they would have
made.
<li><b>ABOUT DIPLOMATS</b>, by Lesley Barker, eHow Contributor
<p>This brief “about” article covers History, Significance
Identification, Function,  and Considerations for diplomats. For
instance, it refers to the Vienna Convention treaties of 1961, 1963,
and 1969 which, among other things covered the use of diplomatic
pouches (See my article elsewhere in this issue.). Or it offers
tidbits like, “What’s the difference between an embassy, a chancery,
and a diplomatic mission? Do you know? Well, find out!
<li><b>HONORARY CONSULS BOOST DIPLOMACY</b>, from Korean Times, 2012
<p>Honorary counsuls do serve a real purpose, although it might not be
obvious at first. I remember the first one I met vividly. His name was
Jean  Louis Paris and he ran a French restaurant in San Diego. His
primary job was hosting a host of Bastille Day parties and
occasionally entertaining French VIPs passing through town. Today, of
course, it’s all about business.
<li><b>FACTS AND FIGURES</b>, DiploFoundation, 2012
<p>The DiploFoundation is an interesting organization and its website is
worth a look. I can’t decide if it’s a legit academic institution or a
money-making degree mill, like some American “for profit” educational
schools. Check it out and let me know what you think, or if you’ve had
any experience with it.
<li><b>INSTITUTE FOR DIPLOMATIC STUDIES, CAIRO, EGYPT</b>, from Ministry of
Foreign Affairs website
<p>When I first heard of it, I was shocked to discover that there was
another IDS. After all, I had established my IDS in 1971. Over the
years I’ve kept in touch with the Egyptian one, as well as several
other, similar institutions in other countries. Just recently I
checked out its website and found, to my shock, that most of the site
is down and there’s no mention of a current director or staff. I hope
they’re OK.
<li><b>“Great Negotiations: Agreements that Changed the Modern World,”</b> by
Fredrik Stanton, as reviewed in Political Bookworm by Steven
Levingston
<p>There aren’t a lot of books published on diplomacy, theoretical or
practical; perhaps one for every fifty published on military affairs
(See my article in an upcoming issue of DIPLOMACY WORLD on diplomacy
and <b>Diplomacy</b> libraries), but Stanton’s book is a good one. He
examines six case studies of real diplomatic moments, the “highest
stakes poker games in history,” as he calls them: The Franco-American
Alliance of 1778;’ The Louisiana Purchase; The Congress of Vienna; The
Treaty of Portsmouth (Read James Bradley’s The Imperial Cruise for a
different take on that event and what led to it. Superb.);  The Cuban
Missile Crisis; and Reagan and Gorbachev at the Reykjavik Summit.
<li><b>BOOKS FOR DIPLOMATS</b>, list from  eDiplomat.com, 2012
<p>A good reading list of 23 titles dealing with all aspects of
diplomacy. Some are well known, others less so, but all worth a look.
Many of them can be found used on Amazon.com. There are also many
magazines and journals that deal with diplomacy. The Library of
Congress and State Department also have specialists who can answer
specific questions. They’ve been very helpful to me over the years.
</ul>

<h2>What Happens When a DIPPER Becomes a dipper? Or Vice-Versa?</h2>
<p>Certain people just stand out in your memory. For me, among Dippers I
would have to include Von Metzke, Walker, Naus, Birsan, and Calhamer;
and I could fill a couple of pages with other names. Among diplomats,
and I’ve met many over the years two stand out. 
<p>The first, of course,
is Henry Kissinger. Who doesn’t know of him? Rarely has a diplomat
been so respected, so admired, so feared, and so hated by so many. The
other is a name most people wouldn’t recognize and yet he was a real person:
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philip_Noel-Baker,_Baron_Noel-Baker">Philip Noel-Baker</a>. 
No one else in the world’s history has ever done what he did. He
won an Olympic medal in the 1920 Antwerp Olympics and won the Nobel
Peace Prize in 1959. His biography is available on Wikipedia. I met
him in 1968, as I recall. He was so modest I didn’t have a clue as to
who he was or what’d he done. An excellent model for any dipper or
Dipper. Both men were at least aware of <b>Diplomacy</b>, as was Ambassador
Alejando Orfilia, who served as Argentine ambassador to the United
States and later as head of the OAS. He’s now retired and devotes his
time to running a highly successful vineyard over the hill(s) from
where I live. 

<p>Jamie Young went the other way. When I first met her she
was just starting her career in diplomacy as a bureaucrat at ACDA, the
Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. She was a participant in the
above-mentioned Reykjavik Summit because of her knowledge in weapons
systems and her linguistic skills in Russian and Chinese. Her
<b>Diplomacy</b> career began at DipCon V in Chicago many years ago. After 33
years in the State Department her career is winding down as a
counselor to the secretary of state (equal in rank to an
under-secretary). Way to go, girl! After retirement she’ll be joining
the faculty of Georgetown University.

<p>I met Francois Rivasseau in 1989
at the first Euro(Dip)Con in Paris when he was a mid-level French
foreign ministry bureaucrat. Today he serves as the deputy chief of
the EU delegation in Washington. He’s right on track to fulfilling my
prophecy that someday he would be France’s Foreign Minister. I hope to
see him in November at the French national <b>Diplomacy</b> championships.
The amazing thing about Jamie and Francois is that both of them are
the personification of the qualities I have mentioned above in
describing the perfect diplomat and Dipper. They have proved that you
can do it. 

<p>So why haven’t you?

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>So, what have we learned? The personal characteristics of a solid
diplomat or Dipper are listed above and include truthfulness, calm,
accuracy, patience, good humour, modesty and loyalty. Yeah, right.
More precise and workable skills like self-control, an ability to
formulate one’s thoughts, an ability to read a situation, an instinct
for discreet flattery and a talent for making contact are also listed.
And what of the pastry forks? I leave you with this story.</p>
<p>Rank within the diplomatic culture or <b>Diplomacy</b> world is not merely
indicated by how the diplomat holds him or herself; nor by the number
of games or tournaments son. There are many signs that a trained eye
will pick up upon to determine a diplomat’s or Dippers rank. It is not
just the salary grade and title, or the number of Cons attended or
t-shirts collected, that are changed when a diplomat is promoted or a
Dipper rises in the hobby’s pecking order. There is also a change in
the number of rooms and bathrooms in the home and contents of drawers
and cupboards, all in line with the Ministry’s strict rules. According
to the Danish Foreign Ministry, the embassy counselor must have
eighteen stainless steel pastry forks of the Erik Rosendahl A/S brand.
A commercial counselor need only have twelve pastry forks, while an
attaché is provided with eight. The most distinguished ambassadors
have three pepper pots while the others must be content with two.
<p>Among Dippers the Oldest Farts have at least one GRI <b>Diplomacy</b> board.
Mid-level players have an Avalon Hill version (preferably one piece),
later players may have an Avalon Hill triparte game board, and newbies
will have a Hasbro edition. The most distinguished hobbyists may have
such trophies as a hand-embroidered mapboard, a wood-carved <b>Diplomacy</b>
board table-top, t-shirts falling apart from age and at least
two-sizes too small, or a signed photo of Edi Birsan with hair. The
younger ones will have recent  Dip event t-shirts that have never been
washed, and are probably too large for them.</p>
