<p>This September marked the opening of a new judge designed to serve the
needs of students and teachers. ZAED, the South Africa Educational
Diplomacy judge, serves the privacy needs of players under 18 by
requiring less registration information than a public judge for adult
players. When the student player is accompanied by an adult to monitor
his email account, the registration requirements allow players under
13 years of age to play in an environment that is compliant with the
United States Children's Online Privacy and Protection Act, known as
COPPA.</p>
<p>ZAED uses the NJudge Wrappers web interface that Chris Babcock
originally introduced on USAK. The NJW program suite wraps the judge
in a group of tools that exposes the judge's operation and
documentation to the web. This provides access to help easier and
trains the user in the email interface by functioning as a wizard
constructing the “signon” line that troubles most players new to judge
Diplomacy.</p>
<p>Additionally, ZAED provides local maps on the
<strong><a href="http://zaed.asciiking.com/">http://zaed.asciiking.com</a></strong> website. This bypasses the need for the
floc.net tools, which would otherwise be problematic from a privacy
standpoint since Floc archives judge registration data as a third
party site.</p>
<p>Diplomacy provides significant educational value in the areas of
English composition and logic as well as history and geography. ZAED
provides a safe environment for educators to introduce their students
to this valuable experience at any age. Students of any age who enjoy
the game may find opportunities to compete with their peers around the
world on ZAED. Those 13 and over who desire stronger competition are
welcome to register and play on USAK, <strong><a href="http://usak.asciiking.com/">http://usak.asciiking.com</a></strong>.</p>
<p>The administrator for the ZAED educational Diplomacy judge may be
reached at <strong><a href="mailto:zaed-judgekeeper@asciiking.com">zaed-judgekeeper@asciiking.com</a></strong>.</p>
