<h2>HuskyCon!</h2>
<p>The following message was received by the Editorial staff from Conrad Woodring:
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'><i>HuskyCon V
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Friday 17th August 2007 - Sunday 19th August 2007
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Stony Brook, Long Island, New York, United States
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Contact: Conrad Woodring<br>
Website: <a href="http://www.huskycon.com/">http://www.huskycon.com</a>
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>HuskyCon is a unique event in that the entire event is held at a
private residence, and that room and board are free. The Woodring
household is large enough to comfortably provide lodging to a large
group of people. Food and drink is also provided free of charge by
the Woodring family.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>The event is a favorite among regional players and is characterized a
laid back, very social atmosphere. Players have brought families and
spent part of the weekend swimming off of the Woodring's dock, or
simply sitting on the edge of the cliff enjoying the beautiful views
of Long Island Sound. There is also quite a bit of side gaming that
goes on during the tournament.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>So please, visit our website. Feel free to bombard us with any
questions you may have. We look forward to seeing you in August.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Thank you,
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Conrad Woodring</i>
<p>The Editor recommends checking out that site and looking for pictures of the gigantic Diplomacy board the Woodrings have!
<h2>DixieCon!</h2>
<p>The following was ripped off the <a href="http://www.dixiecon.com/">DixieCon</a> home page...
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'><i>Dixiecon is the longest-running Diplomacy tournament on the East Coast, featuring three rounds of Diplomacy and all the open boardgaming you can shake a stick at! Come to the tournament that has been the scene of thrilling Diplomacy gaming since 1987, including as host convention for the North American Championships, Dipcon, in 1990, 1994, 1998 and 2002. Dixiecon also served as the host of the world championships, World Dipcon, in 1990 and 1998.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>What keeps people coming back for more? Many of the best Diplomacy players in North America come every Memorial Day to face off against each other in a format which allows for the true "Diplomacy Cream" to rise to the top. Diplomacy is played best as you first learned it - without time limits. Except for the Sunday round, which by necessity must be ended by 6pm at the latest, the Dip games at Dixiecon end when someone gets 18 centers, or when everyone still alive on the board says it ends!
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Some people come because of Dixiecon's long tradition of fine play, good sportsmanship, and infectious comradeship born of sharp play over a map of Europe.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Some people come because they want to match wits with other games in the Iron Man of Gaming, the tournament for all the non-Diplomacy games played over the weekend.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Still others come because of the low cost of the event - at $25 registration and $25 per night to share a room, this is easily one of the most inexpensive venues for tournament play.
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>And there really are some who come, we understand, just to eat Eastern North Carolina style barbeque on Saturday night!
<p style='margin-left:36.0pt' style='margin-right:36.0pt'>Whatever you are looking for, we hope you will find it at Dixiecon 21 this Memorial Day Weekend!</i>
<p>DixieCon will be held May 25-27, 2007, at Granville Towers, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. I would just like to add here, because I can, go Wolfpack.
<h2>...and World Dip Con, oh my!</h2>
<p>This year World Dip Con will be held in Vancouver on August 9th-12th. (Leaving you the better part of a week to get across the country for HuskyCon shortly afterward.)
<p>This is a six-round tournament. All the information you need can be found at <a href="http://www.vancouverdiplomacy.ca/">http://www.vancouverdiplomacy.ca</a>.
<p>I hold out a distant hope that I might somehow be able to figure out how to pay for a plane ticket to get out there that weekend, but I can't make any promises. It's sure to be a great time, I hope you'll all look into it.
