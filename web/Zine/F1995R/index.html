<DD>Corerespondence sent to the Pouch, all wrapped up under even more drivel

sure if I were you.  After all, I wrote it.

<i>Danny Loeb</i>
<A HREF="Loeb/ret.html">The Combinatorics of Retreats</A></B>
<DD>Danny's latest installment is timely, what with this being the Retreat
issue and all.  Here, Danny tackles the problem of determining just
how many retreats are possible on a single turn and tells how the Bordeaux
computer diplomat handles this phase of the game.

<!DD><!No, don't be scared.  The Pouch is not disappearing.  On the contrary,
Stephen, who has been a lifesaver to your friendly neighborhood Pouch
Publisher, is proud to announce that The Pouch is
now also going to be available via e-mail and ftp.  For quite some
time now, I've been thanking the
Dip gods for sending Stephen; I think the whole hobby should follow
my lead.>
