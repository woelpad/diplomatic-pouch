<!DD><!No, don't be scared.  The Pouch is not disappearing.  On the contrary,
Stephen, who has been a lifesaver to your friendly neighborhood Pouch
Publisher, is proud to announce that The Pouch is
now also going to be available via e-mail and ftp.  For quite some
time now, I've been thanking the
Dip gods for sending Stephen; I think the whole hobby should follow
my lead.>
