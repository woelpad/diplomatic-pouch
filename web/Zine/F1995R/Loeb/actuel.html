<center>How Does the Current Strategy Finder<BR>
Handle Retreat Phases?
</center></h1>
<HR>
During the movement phases, the large number of possibilities prohibit
considering every possible combination of moves.
Fortunately, during the building and retreat phases, the number of
possible moves is never quite so astronomical.
As we have seen, even in the worst possible case there
are at most about 72 million possible retreat combinations (or about
525 million
including the option of disbanding). These are large numbers, but for
a high-speed computer, it is feasible to consider each case in turn.
Typically, only a couple of units retreat at one time, making for only a
few dozen retreat combinations at most.
<p>
It is thus possible to
do a complete one-ply analysis of these phases of the game. That is,
we can consider every possible combination of retreats.
<p>
Given enough search time, we will include Spring retreats in our search for
Spring moves, and the Autumn retreats and Winter builds in our search
for Fall moves. This is feasible since the number of possible retreats
and builds is usually quite limited; we are not facing the same sort
of combinatorial explosion described earlier.
<p>
One such look-ahead strategy is called the <i>offensive retreat</i>, which
takes advantage of the fact that a unit can often retreat "forward."
For example, if England
attacks the French <i>F Bel</i> with support from Holland while
the North Sea is open, France can retreat there and menace the entire
East coast of England as well as Scandinavia and the Lowlands.
It is equally important to look ahead at the builds. If
Austria-Hungary is at war with Turkey and wants to build a fleet, then
he should take care during the Fall movement that Trieste is
left open for such a build.  Similarly, a player who needs a unit back
home may chose to disband one of his farflung units rather than
retreating it.
<p>
Even if anticipating retreats and builds were not needed for strategic
reasons, they are clearly needed on a diplomatic level. In face-to-face
play and use of the Bordeaux diplomat, the conduct of diplomacy is
not allowed before retreat and build season. Thus, any message
concerning those seasons should be anticipated and sent to allies
before the preceding movement season.
<p>
However, looking ahead to future movement seasons will often be
futile, because the computer is
likely to be wrong about the
opponents' moves and the mistakes will get compounded for each turn
looked ahead.
<p>
The initial strategy finder written by Constantin Staykov
(<a
href="mailto:CSTAYKOFF@DT.euroview.fr"><tt>CSTAYKOFF@DT.euroview.fr</tt></a>)
considered all possible combinations of retreats. However,
when we introduced the notion of a multi-ply search, we
chose to use search techniques in build or retreat
phases that are less
complete. With their increased efficiency, they can anticipate
the following phase via a
recursive call to the strategic module of the program.  This enables
efficient prediction of the results for retreats while planning the
strategy of a movement phase.
<p>
To implement this technique, the retreat generator was
rewritten by Gilles
Schaeffer (<a href="mailto:schaeffe@clipper.ens.fr"
><tt>schaeffe@clipper.ens.fr</tt></a>).
Groups of <i>related</i> retreats are
studied simultaneously (using an evolutionary search, optimizing in
turn for each involved country).
<p>
Let the terminology <i>uAv</i> refer to <i>u</i> and </i>v</i> which are
2 retreating units which have a common possible retreat or even adjacent
possible retreats.
Let <i>B</i> be the transitive
closure of this function <i>A</i>. (That is, <i>B = I u A u A^2 u ...</i>)
Then two units <i>u</i> and <i>v</i> are considered
<i>related</i> if <i>uBv</i>. (In the vast majority of circumstances, a
retreating unit will only be related to itself.
<p>
Among related retreats, all combinations will be studied, and each
alliance will move to maximize its minimum possible return.
<p>
Remember also that only a maximum
of 11 units can retreat at one time (and usually many fewer).
This search is much more rapid (and thus much more useful as the
second ply of a two-ply search), and yields more significant results
than the original program.
