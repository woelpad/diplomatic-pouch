<center>Six Retreats in Fall 1901</center></h1>
<hr>
<h2>Six Retreats (one of many solutions)</h2>
<ol>
<li>English <i>F NTH (from London in S1901M)</i> attacked by German
<i>F Den (from Kiel)</i> and French <i>F ENG (from Brest)</i>.
<li>German <i>A Pru (from Berlin)</i> attacked by Russian
<i>F Lvn (from StP/sc)</i> and <i>A War (which held in S1901M)</i>.
<li>German <i>A Mun (which held in S1901M)</i> attacked by French
<i>A Bur (from Paris)</i> and Austrian <i>A Boh (from Vienna)</i>.
<li>Russian <i>A Sev (from Moscow)</i> attacked by Turkish
<i>F BLA (from Ankara)</i> and <i>A Arm (from Smyrna)</i>.
<li>Turkish <i>A Bul (from Constantinople)</i> attacked by Russian
<i>F Rum (from Sevastopol)</i> and Austrian <i>A Ser (from Budapest)</i>.
<li>Austrian <i>F Tri (which held in S1901M)</i> attacked by Italian
<i>A Tyr (from Venice)</i> and <i>A Ven (from Rome)</i>.
</ol>
On vacation: English <i>F Edi</i> and <i>A Lvp</i>,
French <i>A Mar</i>, and Italian <i>F Nap</i>
<h2>Why Not More?</h2>
Basically, it's all England's fault.
<P>
After Spring 1901, the only enemy unit the army originally in
Liverpool could be adjacent to would be a French <i>F Eng</i> from
Brest. Thus, this army can not be dislodged. Moreover, as an
<b>army</b>, it can not
participate in the dislodgement of <i>F Eng</i> at sea.
<p>
Furthermore, if <i>F Lon</i> moves in contact with the enemy, by moving
to <i>Nth</i> or <i>Eng</i>, then there is no way for <i>F Edi</i> to
move into contact with any enemy other than the German fleet <i>F
Kie-Den</i>. However, in that case, neither the German nor the English
fleet will find a second unit available to assist in dislodging the other.
<p>
The remaining 20 units can participate in at most 6 dislodgements, since it
takes a minimum of 21 units to perform 7 dislodgements.
<h2>Subsidiary Questions</h2>
(Best answers to appear in an update of this column.)
<ul>
<li>Can all six dislodgements in Fall 1901 be of different
nationality?
<li>How many can be of a single nationality?
<li>How many forced disbands can there be in Fall, 1901?
</ul>
