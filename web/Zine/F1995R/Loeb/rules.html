<H2>Rules of Diplomacy</H2>
<h3>Copyright (c) Hasbro, Inc. <!The Avalon Hill Game Company></h3>
A unit which otherwise would have remained in the
space attacked by a better supported unit is
dislodged and must retreat or be disbanded.
<p>
It must move to a space to		
which it could ordinarily move if unopposed by
other units; that is, to an adjacent space
suitable to an army or fleet, as the case may be.
The unit may not retreat, however, to any space
which is occupied, nor to the space its attacker
came from, nor to a space which was left vacant
due to a standoff on the move. If no place is
available for retreat, the dislodged unit is
"disbanded"; that is, its marker is removed from
the board.

<h3>Writing Retreats.</h3>
If two or more units must		
retreat after a move, the retreats are written		
down immediately by the players concerned,
without diplomacy,

<h3>Other Retreat Rules.</h3>
A player may choose to
disband a unit rather than retreat it. 
<p>
If two or						
more units may retreat only to the same space,		
they are all disbanded, unless only one of the
units is ordered to retreat and the others are
ordered to be disbanded. In that case, the one
unit ordered to retreat may do so. If two or more
units are ordered to retreat to the same space,
they are all disbanded.
<p>
If a player fails to order				
a retreat when necessary, the unit is disbanded.
Retreats may neither be convoyed nor supported.

<p>
The format of your Diplomacy orders depends on the phase of the game:
Movement, Retreats or Adjustments.  Multiple orders can be entered on 
one line by separating them with commas or semicolons.
<p>
Retreat orders:
<pre>
{type} {s-prov} {moves}   {d-prov}
{type} {s-prov} {disband}
{/pre}
where:
{pre}
{type}    = "army", "a", "fleet", "f" or {empty}.
{s-prov}  = Source province.
{moves}   = "-", "->", "m", "move", "moves", "move to", or "moves to".
{d-prov}  = Destination province.
{disband} = "d" or "disband"
</pre>

<h2>Diplomacy Programming Project Protocol</h2>

<p>
The following messages are used in the retreat phase by the Diplomat
Adjudicator. Note that all dislodged units must submit an order
even if there is no option other than <i>disband</i>.
For consistency, an "empty" retreat phase is automatically generated
if no units must retreat.

<dt><B>Orders:</B>
<dd><pre>
RTO prov            {retreat}
DSB                 {disband = nonretreat}
</pre>
Used by diplomats to <b>sub</b>mit retreats, used by interface to
display the results of a retreat phase (<b>ord</b>), used between diplomats to
suggest or forbid retreats.
<P>
<dt><B>Notes:</B>
<dd><pre>
1.  BNC             {move bounced, e.g.: eng-nth vss nwy-nth}
                    {...or retreat bounced, mutual disband}
2.  (RET prov)      {must retreat due to attack from (prov)}
3.  (note RET prov)
4.  (MBE {[provs]}) {retreat is no good, it must be to one}
                    {of the following provinces}
5.  NRN             {no retreat needed for this unit}
6.  NRS             {not right season}
</pre>
used by interface to indicate (1,2,3,4) the result of moves made
(<b>ord</b>) or (5,6) moves illegally submitted (<b>thk</b>).
<b>NRS</b> is also used to forbid diplomacy prior to retreat phases.
