<h3 align=center>ENDGAME II</h3>
<p>Hello, class.

<p>Last time, we discussed the prospects for France in a common endgame
position, one in which France holds Tunis and the Mediterranean west
thereof, and StP and Scandinavia, along with Kiel, Munich, Ruhr, Holland,
Burgundy, and also has units to the east to put pressure on an Austrian
foe's defense of Berlin. We concluded, you may remember, that France had a
"virtual win"; that is, although France could not win if Austria forsaw her
every move, if Austria had to guess, France could give herself a chance of
winning equal to any probability less than 1.

<p>But, in that column, I did not consider all available options for Austria.
I considered one attacking option, and classified all other options
together. This was an oversimplification. I hope that I managed to impart
some important information nevertheless. But now it is time to lift the
veil of simplicity and tackle the position in its full complex glory.

<p>I have to thank Conrad Minshall for bringing the richness of the position
to my attention, in some endgame discussion of dsi95cf, a no-press game for
the top no-press players according to Diplomacy Skill Index rating system,
which Conrad won playing France. Conrad also reminded me that we are
continuing to ignore yet another, annoying complication, which is that we
have not provided any guarantee that France can always make a significant
move, A Pie-Tyo, in all positions below. Mightn't that army be dislodged by
some Austrian/Italian attack? We hope to treat this problem another time.

<p>Here is the position.
<IMG SRC="Initial.gif" ALIGN=middle>


<p>Last time I considered two sets of moves for France, and two for Austria. I
gave them names.

<p><strong>French Attack</strong>
<br>Mun-Sil, Lvn-Pru, Kie-Ber, Bal S Kie-Ber, StP - Lvn, GoB S StP - Lvn, Nwy S
Fin - StP, Fin - StP, Hol - Kie, Bur - Mun, Ruh S Bur - Mun, Par - Bur, Pie
- Tyo.

<p><strong>French Safety</strong>
<br>Mun H, Lvn H, Kie-Ber, Bal S Kie-Ber, StP S Lvn, GoB S Lvn, Nwy H, Fin H,
Hol - Kie, Bur S Mun, Ruh S Mun, Par H, Pie - Tyo.

<p><strong>Austrian Defense</strong>
<br>(I left it unspecified, noting that any move leaving the position unchanged
against FS would do.)

<p><strong>Austrian Counter</strong>
<br>A Tyo - Mun, Boh S Tyo - Mun, Sil S Tyo - Mun, Ber - Kie, War - Lvn, Mos S
War - Lvn, Pru S War - Lvn, Gal - War, Vie - Tyo, Tri S Vie - Tyo.

<p>Not to belabor an old issue, I will just summarize the outcomes of the four
combinations of these moves in the table below. The marks "w" and "-"
represent Win for France, and No Change, respectively.

<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<TR><TD><TD><B>AD</B><TD><B>AC</B></TR>
<TR><TD><B>FA</B><TD align=center>w<TD align=center>?</TR>
<TR><TD><B>FS</B><TD align=center>-<TD align=center>w</TR>
</table>
</center>

<p>We do not know the value of ?, because it represents the position I called
"French Berlin," and we didn't get around to evaluating that position. The
matrix is a virtual win for France, because France can play FS with
probability 1-epsilon, and FA with probability epsilon, making epsilon as
small as he likes (but not zero) and thereby increasing his chances of
winning as high as he likes.

<p>But we didn't give Austria enough options. Austria has a set of moves which
leave the board unchanged against FS, and which produce a different
position, <strong><em>not </em></strong> an outright win for France, against FA.
Here is the set of
moves:

<p><strong>Austrian Trick</strong>
<br>Tyrolia - Munich
<br>Bohemia S Tyrolia - Munich
<br>Silesia S Tyrolia - Munich
<br>Prussia S Berlin
<br>Trieste - Tyrolia
<br>Vienna S Trieste - Tyrolia

<p>The point is that this move does not instantly succomb to FS, because
Berlin is supported by Prussia, and the support isn't cut by FS (to be
safe, France is holding A Lvn in place).

<p>Now the matrix is importantly different. I use "fb" to represent the French
Berlin position, and '?' for an outcome we won't have to analyze.
<P>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<TR><TD><TD><B>AD</B><TD><B>AC</B><TD><B>AT</B></TR>
<TR><TD><B>FA</B><TD align=center>w<TD align=center>?<TD align=center>fb</TR>
<TR><TD><B>FS</B><TD align=center>-<TD align=center>w<TD align=center>-</TR>
</table></center>

<p>If France adopts the "epsilon" strategy, Austria can just play AT. So if
France does use that strategy, the position will eventually evolve to what
I called the French Berlin position, no matter what Austria does. So we
will have to evaluate that position after all. Here it is:
<p><center><IMG SRC="Fstart.gif" ALIGN=middle></center>

<p>AUSTRIA: A Tyrolia, A Bohemia, A Munich, A Silesia, A Prussia, A Livonia, A
Moscow, A Warsaw, A Trieste, A Vienna, A Budapest.

<p>FRANCE: A Berlin, A Kiel, A Ruhr, A Burgundy, A Piedmont, A Marseilles, F
Gulf of Lyon, F St. Pete(sc), A Fin, F Norway, F Gulf of Bothnia, F Baltic,
F North Sea, A Par.


<p>We will find three relevantly different French moves, and three relevantly
different Austrian replies. The intuitive idea is that if France is playing
a certain set of strategies, then the Austrian strategies A and A* are
relevantly different if they produce different results against some member
of France's set.

<p>We simplify the presentation by giving moves only for the significant units
on the front lines; moves for other units are fairly obvious.

<p>The French options are:
<A name=M>
<p><strong>French Safety move (<A HREF="Fsaf.html">Fsaf</A>)</strong>:
<br>A Kie S A Ber
<br>F Bal S A Ber
<br>A Ber S A Bur-Mun
<br>A Ruh S A Bur-Mun.

<p><strong>French Berlin-Mun attack (<A HREF="Fber.html">Fber</A>)</strong>:
<br>A Ber-Mun
<br>A Kie S A Ber-Mun
<br>A Ruh S A Ber-Mun
<br>A Bur S A Ber-Mun
<br>F Bal-Ber.

<p><strong>French Burgundy-Mun attack (<A HREF="Fbur.html">Fbur</A>)</strong>:
<br>A Bur-Mun
<br>A Ruh S A Bur-Mun
<br>A Kie S A Bur-Mun
<br>A Ber S A Bur-Mun
<br>F Bal S A Ber

<p>Here the first is a Safety move, with which France cannot lose ground; the
worst case for France is that there is no change in the position. The
second is France's attacking move: it is bound to take Munich, but against
the right Austrian defense it yields a drawn position. The third arises
because of a certain sort of defense available to Austria, which we
describe below.

<p>Here are the Austrian moves.

<p><strong>Austrian Pru-Ber attack (<A HREF="Fbur.html#Apb">Apb</A>)</strong>:
<br>A Pru-Ber
<br>A Sil S A Pru-Ber
<br>A War-Pru

<p><strong>Austrian Mun-Ber attack (<A HREF="Fbur.html#Amb">Amb</A>)</strong>:
<br>A Mun-Ber
<br>A Sil S A Mun-Ber
<br>A Pru S A Mun-Ber

<p><strong>Austrian Save Munich defense (<A HREF="Amun.html">Amun</A>)</strong>:
<br>A Pru-Ber
<br>A Sil S A Mun
<br>A Boh S A Mun

<p>And here are the important features of each. <strong>Apb</strong> foils the
French attacking
move, <strong>Fber</strong>, by taking Berlin and holding Prussia and Livonia.
This leaves a
stalemated position. The point is that by going all out against Munich,
France leaves Berlin vulnerable. But notice that <strong>Apb</strong> does not
lose ground
against the French safety move, <strong>Fsaf</strong>. This means that France
cannot be
content with just <strong>Fsaf</strong> and <strong>Fber</strong>, for then
Austria could play <strong>Apb</strong> forever
and the game would be drawn. And that's why we had to introduce
<strong>Fbur</strong>. <strong>Apb</strong>
loses immediately to <strong>Fbur</strong>, since France gains Munich without
losing Berlin.

<p><strong>Amb</strong> enters the picture as Austria's best defense against
<strong>Fbur</strong>. And a
perfect defense it is, for it produces the drawn position again, in which
Austria holds Berlin, Livonia, Prussia. Note that an attack Mun-Ber with
two supports is the <strong><em>only</em></strong> way that Austria can succeed
against <strong>Fbur</strong>. And
it loses immediately against <strong>Fsaf</strong> or <strong>Fber</strong>.

<p>Finally, <strong>Amun</strong> maintains the status quo against
<strong>Fbur</strong>, and against the safety
move <strong>Fsaf</strong>, but loses directly to <strong>Fber</strong>, the big,
aggressive French attack.

<p>(Conrad notes that in theory, there is another relevant French option.
France might try attacking Prussia, by moving an army into position and
convoying. If Austria does not always protect Prussia, then France gets an
easy win once he loads an army therein. This is a good point. If we could
not find a French win without including such an option, we could turn to
Conrad's idea. But we can find one, so we are permitted to keep our set of
options small.)

<p>We summarize these results in a table:
<P>
<center>
<table border=2 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=2>
<TR><TD><TD><B>Apb</B><TD><B>Amb</B><TD><B>Amun</B></TR>
<TR><TD><B>Fsaf</B><TD align=center>-<TD align=center>w<TD align=center>-</TR>
<TR><TD><B>Fber</B><TD align=center>d<TD align=center>w<TD align=center>w</TR>
<TR><TD><B>Fbur</B><TD align=center>w<TD align=center>d<TD align=center>-</TR>
</table></center>

<p>Now our earlier remarks become clear, I hope. <strong>Fsaf</strong> is
obviously 'safe', and
wins sometimes. <strong>Fber</strong> is the aggressive move.
<strong>Fbur</strong> was introduce to prevent
Austria from playing <strong>Apb</strong> with impugnity. <strong>Amb</strong> is
then necessary, else France
can persevere with <strong>Fbur</strong>; and then we need <strong>Amun</strong>
to prevent France from
nailing down a 'virtual win' by playing <strong>Fsaf</strong> with probability
1-e, and <strong>Fbur</strong>
with probability e.

<p>We are now at an important crossroads. It's worth temporarily ignoring the
actual moves on the board, and examining the matrix alone. How shall we
evaluate this matrix? It looks pretty good for France. But how does France
cash in? What, exactly, is France's best strategy? How shall France mix
together the pure strategies, and with what probabilities?

<p>Today I reveal the evaluation of the matrix, but <strong><em>not</em></strong>
the full solution.
The French Berlin position is a Virtual Win for France. France can win with
any degree of probability that he likes, up to but not including 1. This
means that the original position, the one with which we began, in which
France owns Mun and not Ber, is also a French Virtual Win, of course.

<p>I leave it to the reader to come up with the full story. What is France's
strategy? This is a difficult exercise. A position with the same structure
was first discovered by Dan Shoham, and worked over by Dan, Rick Desper,
and me. Next time I will present the solution, along with some
mind-boggling twists.
