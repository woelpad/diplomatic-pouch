How to Lie to Your Opponents</h2></center>

<p><h3>True Lies or False Truths?</h3>

<p>Winning a game of Diplomacy is very hard. Regardless of what country you 
have pulled, what variant you play, and who your opponents are, you seldom have a 
high percentage of wins in Diplomacy. A game of Diplomacy requires a player
to exhibit several different abilities, and you seldom find a player that 
possesses all these traits. To be a splendid tactician, able to construct 
advanced support chains and stalemate lines without the ability to talk to 
other players and convince them of the need to participate with you in your
tactical plans is useless. Such a player is easily defeated by 
a more charismatic person able to rally people behind his ideas and turn 
them away from him and toward his enemies, even if that charismatic person
has little or no tactical ability whatsoever. This article hopes to point at 
the importance of one the key elements in Diplomacy, the ability to tell 
lies and spot lies. Face it, even if you are intent on playing a fair game,
you will unavoidably tell some lies during the game -- we all do; don't 
feel bad about it. The lie is a two-edged weapon and can both aid and hurt 
you; therefore it is important that you think a bit before lying to your 
opponent. Before you decide to, lie stop a moment and go through my 
"three steps to a good lies."

<ol>
<li>Okay, you plan to lie to one or more of your opponents and need some help. 
The first question you must ask yourself is why. Why do you <i>need</i> to use a 
lie? Some players use lies all to often, sometimes without reason, and the 
result is a player that finds that noone wishes to ally with him and noone 
trusts him. Even when such a player speaks the truth, other players do not
believe him. 
This is bad. Use lies <i>only</i> when it benefits you and not as a routine diplomacy 
trick. A good lie depends on the fact that the player who utters the lie has 
some reputation of telling the truth. If you have a good reason for lying 
to your opponent, then go ahead to read step 2, but if you do not you might
be better off not lying.  Believe it or not, honesty usually actually <i>is</i>
the best policy.

<p><li>The next question is, "<i>How</i> do you lie?" For some, this comes
naturally, but 
for those of us who are not accustomed to telling lies straight into the
face of another 
person, it can be very difficult. Well, practice makes perfect and if you plan 
on becoming a master Diplomacy player you need a lot of practice. When 
constructing your lie you must take some things in consideration. Will the 
person to whom you lie <i>believe</i> the lie? Never underestimate your opponent's 
intelligence; he is almost always smarter than you give him credit for. Your lie 
must be as plausible as possible so that he can see the thinking behind 
your lie, and the reasons why it <i>could</i> be true. If you play England and negotiate with France at the start,
promising him that you will happily help him get Belgium, Holland, all of Germany,
and Denmark too, as long as you simply get Norway, the Frenchman will be extremely suspicious and 
probably not believe you. His understanding of the game will tell him, 
hopefully, that this offer is a lousy deal for you and that this offer is simply
too good to be true.
If you instead present a well-planned and detailed attack in which Germany is evenly 
split between the two of you, the French player will be much more likely to believe you, even if 
you have no intention of following through on this plan (intending, of course, to instead attack France). If 
your lie sounds plausible and you believe that your opponent will fall for 
it then go ahead to the third and last step.

<p><li>Once you have lied, there may be no going back.  So you must ask yourself, "What do I do when the opponent sees my moves on the next turn and 
realizes that I have lied to him?"  Do not expect someone who has just been 
stabbed in the back by you to be very keen to cooperate with you in the 
future. Hopefully your lie has given you a good advantage over your 
opponent, good enough that you can deal with his lust for revenge. The optimal lie, of course,
is one that your opponent will never spot, but these are often the 
creation of master diplomats and in games with many high-caliber players,
one could honestly say that one player's lies is another players truths.
In such games, then, lies are truths and truths 
are lies. If you deal with the aftermath, and the way your lies might be
converted (inconveniently for you) into truths by quality opponents, then by all means, start lying; you probably 
have a good chance of success.
</ol>
<p>In true life it is said that if you lie about big and important issues,
people 
tend to more easily believe you.  However, in Diplomacy the situation seems to be 
the opposite. Small, subtle lies about very likely possibilities are more 
often believed and an experienced diplomat knows how to tell cunningly lies 
from cunnint truths, and how to spot attempts to deceive.  Remember, paranoia is a way of life and 
this is even more a truth in the game of Diplomacy. Trust me on that.
