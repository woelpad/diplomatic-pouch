<h3>
Experience changes the way you play Diplomacy</h3>
When you start to learn to play Diplomacy your focus is very close in and
tight. You concentrate on the small grain things, like how the rules affect
what orders you should write; whether a support might be cut by a certain
unit; how you can use your units to get some more SC's, since after all
to win you need to get 18 SC's, and to get 18 SC's you need to first get
4, then 5, then 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 etc., right?&nbsp;<img SRC="image001.gif" HSPACE=4 VSPACE=4 v:shapes="_x0000_s1025" class="shape" v:dpi="96" height=385 width=493 align=LEFT>
<br>New players playing Turkey (for example) often concentrate on their
corner of the board and only their corner of the board. Some people say
that that is a beginner's mistake, but I think it's natural. You must get
a set of orders written, and you only have 15 minutes to produce that set
of orders. The rules and the tactical situations are not second nature
to you yet, so it takes at least 12 minutes to get your head around what
your moves need to be. Then you've only got, at most, 3 minutes left, and
that is usually spent agonising over who is telling the truth... there
is simply not enough time for larger considerations.
<p>As you play a bit, you become more confident of the rules, and how they
are applied in different sorts of situations. This allows you to spend
less time thinking about what are good moves and what are bad moves, which
allows you to pull your focus out a little wider. You also have better
appreciation for the tactical situations that you are presented with, and
are beginning to understand a little about the alliance structure considerations
of the game and a little about stalemate lines and how they should affect
your play, and how various moves will be interpreted by your opponents.
Now you find you can usually get your moves sorted out in about 7 or 8
minutes, leaving more time for negotiating and double dealing. The game
becomes a whole lot more enjoyable.
<p>You play some more, and as time passes the amount of time that you need
to dedicate to figuring out what your orders ought to be steadily drops.
Some people get to the point where they can look at the board for 60 seconds,
and then write their preferred set of orders down. Many experienced tournament
Diplomacy player's do this, so that if they get carried away negotiating
they have a set of orders written that they can throw into the box at the
deadline.
<p>As you get more and more proficient at the mechanics of the game of
Diplomacy you're able to dedicate more and more energy to what actually
wins most games of Diplomacy, and that's the consideration of the Bigger
Picture.
<h3>
The Bigger Picture</h3>
What is the Bigger Picture? For those of you new to the game, it may not
yet have revealed it's nature to you. To some of you oldbies out there
it might be what keeps you coming back. My observations above about the
evolution of what we spend our time doing over the developing course of
our career lead me to believe that at the beginning of our careers the
Bigger Picture is not visible to us, simply because we're struggling with
the mechanics of the game, and considering what to do and how to do it
within our immediate focus of the part of the board where our units and
SC's are demands so much of our 15 minutes that we just don't have time
to consider the Bigger Picture. As we become more proficient at handling
the mechanics of the game more time becomes <i>available</i> for us to
consider the Bigger Picture. Some players use that available time to consider
the Bigger Picture, while others continue on focussing on their part of
the board... they've grown up on a diet of the immediate focus, and they
fail to either see that they can change gears, or fail to implement the
required change.
<p>The Bigger Picture is the key to advanced Diplomacy play. Continuing
with the Turkey example, sure the actions of Russia, Austria and Italy
affect you. That much ought to be obvious to every beginner. However what
Germany and France and England do is also crucial to your fortunes. If
you want to attack Russia, you'll find your advance is much more likely
to be swift if Russia is facing pressure from more than just you, so England
attacking Russia is good news for you. If England attacks Russia hard from
the outset, that directly affects you as Turkey. Russia can hold you off
in the south much more effectively if England is not simultaneously attacking
in the North. On the other hand, if you wanted to ally with Russia, perhaps
attacking Austria together, then England attacking Russia in the North
is bad news for you, as Russia will need to divert forces from the attack
on Austria to defend in the North, slowing your advance.
<p>That's not the end of the story though. You need to consider what factors
affect whether or not England will attack Russia. For example: If France
is attacking England hard, it less much less likely that England will be
able to mount a successful attack on Russia. However you then need to consider
what will affect whether France will attack England. It's unlikely that
France will attack England if Germany and/or Italy are attacking France.
And it's unlikely Germany will attack France if Austria and Russia are
attacking Germany, which in turn is unlikely if you're trying to woo Russia
to attack Austria with you.
<blockquote><i>"The enemy of the enemy of my enemy is my enemy."</i></blockquote>
So you see the affairs of every part of the board are interwoven. We just
took one strand and traced it around the entire board, but we could equally
start at any other point on the board and trace any number of strands of
reasoning like that around the board. Reading the Bigger Picture is all
about identifying the relevant strands and then looking at how they all
interact so as to be able to see how each of your six opponents is likely
to play.
<p>As well as those various strands of interpower dependencies, there are
the considerations of pan-theatre issues such as stalemate lines, and the
race to resolve your theatre before the other side of the board does. These
all form part of the Bigger Picture.
<h3>
So how do you do it? Read the Bigger Picture I&nbsp; mean...</h3>
The following model is I think most applicable at three different stages
of a game of Diplomacy:
<ul>
<li>
During the opening (1901 - 1903/1904)</li>
<li>
During times of great change in the alliance structure of the game (after
significant stabs or changes in direction)</li>
<li>
And entering the endgame</li>
</ul>
Imagine a turn, or several turns in a game of Diplomacy where everything
happened in the negotiation phase when and where you wanted it to... where
you could sit back and think for a while, and then click you fingers and
the person you wanted to talk to was always available and ready to talk
to you... you never once had to wait for Germany and Italy to stop talking
before you could talk to one of them... so there's no wasted time in your
fifteen minutes waiting to achieve or say what you want to.
<p>Given that happy mythical state of affairs, how would you approach the
turn(s)?
<p>Many players would start out by figuring out what they wanted their
orders to be, and then would set off to talk to the other players and try
and bend them to their own goals. This is a result of the way we learn,
and the focus we have early in our careers on the immediate issues confronting
us...what to order each unit to do, how to get another SC etc. However
as your career develops these become less and less significant, and yet
we still allow these considerations to dictate our approach to the turn,
I say mainly out of habit.
<p>What follows is a model, to be applied in those mythical circumstances,
of how to turn that around so that the Bigger Picture is not only what
we spend most of our 15 minutes worrying about, but in fact is what shapes
the way we conduct our negotiation altogether.
<blockquote><b>Step 1: Blur your eyes and "Blob the Board".&nbsp;</b> At
the start of the turn, imagine the board doesn't have a whole lot of little
pieces on it. Imagine each power is one large blob of colour. Then ask
yourself some very high level questions: "Is it a good or a bad thing for
me if France and Germany work together?"... "Do I want Italy and Turkey
to work together, or fight each other?" ... "Is Russia being strong good
or bad for me in the next few years?"
<p>The answers to these sorts of questions will paint a very <i>broad brush<b>
</b></i>picture of the way you would like to see the alliance structure
of the game look. You're <b>not</b> interested in what the alliance structure
of the game <u>is</u>, you want to paint the picture of how you'd ideally
like to see it. I think it's best to do this from the angle of "In what
situation would there be the least total threat to my position" i.e. consider
your security, and try and identify whether various situations are a threat
to your security or increase it.
<p>This should take about 30 seconds. It's a very intuitive process.
<p><b>Step 2: Prioritise the other powers in terms of their criticality
to your security. </b>From your quick broad brush picture of the board
identify which powers can cause you the most grief in terms of disrupting
your power's security. Again, this is an intuitive step that should take
no longer than 30 seconds.
<p><b>Step 3: Talk to each of the other powers and get a "Me, me, me."
statement from them.&nbsp;</b> In the order of priority you established
in step 2, talk to each of the other 6 powers briefly and get them to tell
you what they want. Let them talk, and tell you what it is they want if
they are given the freedom to pursue their own interests. Let them talk
about "Me, me, me..."
<p><b>Step 4: Step back from the fray and analyse. </b>Consider each power's
"Me, me, me" statement, and overlay those responses with your broad brush
picture of how you'd like to see the alliance structure of the game developing
from step 1. In a perfect world all six players will have given "Me, me,
me" statements that perfectly match how you want to see the board develop.
My experience tells me that this is actually rare in the extreme, and if
it did ever happen I would be highly suspicious that some of the players
were not dealing straight with me, and instead were just telling me what
they thought I wanted to hear.
<blockquote><i>[<b>Note: </b>At this stage we haven't yet given much consideration
to what we want our units to do. This is somewhat the idea... you have
to have a response ready in case any of the other powers ask you for a
"Me, me, me" statement, but what we are trying to do is reveal at least
some of the Bigger Picture before we make a decision as to what it is we
want to achieve.]</i></blockquote>
What you are really interested in are cases where the other players "Me,
me, me" statements diverge from what it is you want to see develop. Those
indicate areas of possible conflict with your interests - powers you may
end up fighting (if they are neighbours) or powers who it seems are unlikely
to play the way you'd like them to (if they are your neighbour's neighbour).
Powers who's "Me, me, me" statements are compatible with your broad brush
picture of how you'd like to see things develop are potential allies or
potential easy targets (their "Me, me, me" statement might see them getting
out of your way and leaving themselves wide open to you).
<p><b>Step 5: So let's convert this into a plan then. </b>From there opportunities
and threats should become apparent to you. Armed with that knowledge you
can go and talk to the other players again about what you're actually going
to do, and you can formulate your moves accordingly.</blockquote>
<h3>
The important message</h3>
The fact is the model above can be unwieldy. To do all of that in 15 minutes
can be difficult, and maybe even impossible. That's not to say it useless
for real life application at all. You can trim it down and use it for the
basis of how you actually play - I do. However it's not something you <u>have</u>
to get all done in one 15 minute Diplomacy period. You can apply it across
several turns, garnering your information bit by bit, all the while trying
to feed your opponents misinformation about key issues to divert them away
from courses of action that would hamper your expansion. The key to what
I've said before is trying to make the mental leap from deciding your orders
at the start of the turn and then going out to convert the board to your
way of thinking, to allowing the board's way of thinking to influence how
you want to move. It's about identifying resistance your your planned routes
of expansion, and opportunities to expand while staying onside with your
neighbours, and taking the path of least resistance and therefore the most
gain.
<p>We begin our careers obsessed with deciding what our moves are going
to be. Then we graduate to trying to influence other player's moves. As
we truly leave the status of newbie behind us and move into the intermediate
ranks we begin to look at some of the larger considerations. However, often
players at this stage of their careers are held back by poor methodology:
They try to decide their orders before contemplating what everyone else
wants and thinks, and this shackles one of their arms behind their backs,
as everything that follows is tinged as either good (because it agrees
with what they've already decided) or bad (because it's not compatible
with what they've already decided), when in fact many of the ideas and
approaches with the best potential for growth may be those that these players
list as "bad".
<p>Take your time to consider the other player's "Me, me, me" statements,
and consider how they mesh with your "Me, me, me" statement. Use this angle
on the bigger picture to help decide your best course of expansion, and
from their your orders will write themselves.
