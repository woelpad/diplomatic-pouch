<h1>
You've Been Dueled...</h1>

Composed during a game of Dip Duel... a song about a stab on one's Russian
ally.
<p>I've crossed the line
<br>you pushed me over
<br>It doesn't matter to you
<br>It matters to me...
<p>You're cut adrift
<br>but I'm still growing
<br>I'm only hangin' on
<br>to watch you go down, my love
<p>They say in war there are no rules
<br>You've been dueled!
<p>I just appeared in you
<br>you disappeared from me...
<br>I took everything you ever wanted
<br>It wasn't what you wanted
<p>The allies who attack you you hate the most
<br>they pass right through you like a ghost
<br>they look for more centres but you've disappeared
<br>Baby you're nowhere...
<p>They say in war there are no rules
<br>You've been dueled!
<p>Your Russian units were pale like God's only dove
<br>your centres screamed out for my love
<br>and forced me to come crashing down ... from above
<br>and I need them like ... a drug!
<p>You wore my love like a see through dress
<br>your lips said one thing, your movements something else
<br>oh love, like a screaming flower
<br>love, dying every hour...
<p>you don't know if it's fear or desire
<br>watching your former ally take a flier
<br>just one fleet in Finland
<br>and you know you're in the mire
<p>Your heart is racing, you can't keep up
<br>your centre count is bleeding like a cut
<br>between the horses of France and Turkey
<br>you are trampled... underfoot
<p>Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, love...
<br>You say in war, there are no rules
<br>Oooo, oooo, oooo, oooo, love...
<br>Sweatheart,... you've been Dueled.
