<p>Well, it looks like we've reached the end of another issue of the Diplomatic Pouch. I can't say that putting together the Deposits this time was as trying as Brandon's task last issue, but I think there are a number of interesting letters that I hope you'll all read.
<p>Not surprisingly, the Deposits were dominated by mail regarding Manus' article on <a href=/Zine/F1999R/Hand/bwl.html>The Blue Water Lapanto.</a> I look forward to seeing Manus' response to some of the comments he's received on the subject.
<p>There were also a few letters on Simon's and Manus' article on <a href="/Zine/F1999R/Debate/paradox.html">Eliminating
the Paradox in Diplomacy</a> from the Fall Movement issue. Those you won't see in this issue of the Pouch, but there will probably be a follow up article on the subject in the Spring Retreat issue, and I'm sure that those letters will find a place in any future article on the subject.

Before we dig into the mailbag, here is a quick question sent in

In standard Diplomacy, what do these four provinces, and only these four

<p>
<H4>From Robert Watkins (<a href=mailto:robert.watkins@mincom.com>robert.watkins@mincom.com</a>):</H4>
<p>What can I say? I love it!
<p>Playing Austria, my biggest concern has always been "what shall I do with the drunken sailor?" (referring to the Austrian fleet nearly always on shore leave). This article gives a very valid tactic for putting it into good use, and I wouldn't be surprised if it becomes quite popular now the secret is out.
<p>
<H4>From David Hertzman (<a href=mailto:knave@idirect.com>knave@idirect.com</a>):</H4>
<p>I have a theory regarding your article.  It seems that many openings,
after getting published in the pouch, gain a certain amount of
popularity in PBeM play.  So, as a pseudo-scientific study, you publish
an opening which cannot possibly work in genuine play, and then go
through subsequent Judge games to see if that opening was used at all.
If you are correct, then the Zine is as effective as you have always
hoped it would be, and you can rest on your laurels.
<p>Seriously though, I can imagine impressionable newbies looking at this
article and thinking, "yeah, don't talk at all to Italy, now thats a
plan".  This is contrary to everything most top players are trying to
push in this game!  The most likely result of such an opening would be a
pissed off Italy with a possible rocking RT Juggernaut in the East.  I
like the retreat concept where Austria gets to choose the open Aeg/Eas
sea.  However, the damage to get such an opening is huge.  First of all,
the Austrian fleet does not hang around "like an army", it can serve as
support into Aeg.  Alternately, if you like the idea of the
multi-national convoy, you can order Gre-Ion, Ion-(whatever).  Austria
gets the extra build, Italy gets the extra security (and can send the
Ven army into Russia if you really want or Germany or France or
whatever, possibilities are endless..
<p>Point is, Italy gains NOTHING out of this, Austria can (as you pointed
out at the end) screw Italy bad if he feels like it.  If I were Italy,
and an Austrian pulled this on me, I'd probably be rather pissed, and I
am a rather forgiving player.  Unfortunately, in this hobby, I have
found the grudge to be the norm.
<p>Perhaps a "nicer" Blue Water could be fabricated, one that doesn't piss
off Italy as much but rather gets him in with the plan.  Something to
think about.
<p>
<H4>From Aron Ambrosiani (<a href=mailto:aron@slav.su.se>aron@slav.su.se</a>):</H4>
<p>Really liked the article. However, can't this be more easily arranged by simply doing the Balkan Gambit? If Italy and Austria are well coordinated, the Blue Water lepanto can be achieved _without_ locking the Italian army in Venice, moving to Adr etc.
<p>I believe that the variant is more powerful (for both A and I) when Italy is not bullied along but actually cooperating.
<p>What do you think?
<p>
<H4>From Chris Adams (<a href=mailto:cagadams@hotmail.com>cagadams@hotmail.com</a>):</H4>
<p>I enjoyed reading your piece about Austria - and it reinforces my belief
that Austria, despite most players' reluctance to take it on as a power,
is actually the most versatile power to play, especially in the first
two years.
<p>The opening you describe depends to some extent on how quickly Turkey
and Russia get it together. If I was playing either of those two, as
soon as I saw Austria move into the Adriatic, I might sense an
opportunity. Russia and Turkey could profit well from Italy's paranoia
and Austria's inability to take Greece in the fall.
<p>I am playing Austria in a game on SEPO at the moment ("bjork"), where I
have enjoyed outstanding (and admittedly unexpected) success with an
opening born out of losing too often to the juggernaut. In this game, by
the end of 1902, Austria had control of all of the Balkans. By the end
of 1904, Russia and Turkey had been eliminated.
<p>The opening takes advantage of Austria's central position on the board
to offer as much as possible to neighbouring powers. Above all, Austria
seeks the friendship of Germany and Italy. It also endeavours to turn
Russia and Turkey against each other.
<p>There is one caveat. The speedy occupation of the Balkans and quick
elimination of both Russia and Turkey only really works if Russia opens
by not moving to Rumania and sends A Mos-St P. So, if Russia leaves two
units on his southern borders and sends two units north, the strategy
will work. Otherwise, it is not likely to.
<p>In this case, Russia opened A War-Ukr; F Sev-Bla; A Mos-StP; F StP-GoB.
Turkey opened A Con-Bul; F Ank-Bla; A Smy-Con.
<p>Austria has in the meantime done no more than establish cordial
relations with Russia and Turkey. It welcomes a Russian presence in
Rumania and a Turkish presence in Bul. Gre is open for discussion.
<p>As for Italy, because Austria's biggest fear is the juggernaut (a joint
Russian-Italian attack from the start is possible, though requires both
powers to establish a strong bond at the beginning and is rare... the
two tend to get together more if Austria moves against either one of
them or soon after Turkey has been eliminated), he does everything
possible to keep Italy on good terms. He makes it very clear to Italy he
wants a strong alliance.. "all too often", he says, "Italy and Austria
fight and both lose out...". Austria makes it clear to Italy they both
have a common enemy in Turkey and this could be good grounds for
co-operation. Austria suggests openings to Italy that suits them both.
Both keep armies in Trieste and Venice. Menawhile Italy also orders A
Rom-Apu and F Nap-Ion - a standard Italian opening that keeps him happy.
It is flexible and can be turned to whatever opportunity arises. Austria
understands all this, says this makes great sense. DMZs are established
in Tyrolia and the Adriatic.
<p>Austria opens A Vie-Tri, F Tri-Alb and A Bud-Ser. This is standard. It
is Austria's strongest opening and, despite the slim risk of an
Italian-Russian alliance is the best foundation for expansion.
<p>Concrete plans are put to Italy after the Turkish-Russian bounce in Bla.
Austria tells Italy the bounce could mean two things: either Turkey and
Russia have both broken a DMZ agreement (and now distrust each other),
or they have fallen out over whether one or the other should occupy Bla,
or they are allied and the bounce has demonstrated to them they can work
together. Whichever is true - and it has to be one of the three - it
gives Italy an opportunity. He has to act if Russia and Turkey are
allied and go for the Lepanto in his own interests. Austria tells him
the juggernaut will leave Italy with nothing. If Russia and Turkey do
distrust one another, this again is an opportunity... the Lepanto is
also the best option.
<p>At the same time, Austria has secured himself Greece. Turkey abandons
claims to Greece and is beginning to feel hemmed in. Instead, he starts
asking for support into Rumania. Austria relays these messages to Russia
and says he is more than happy for Russia to occupy Rumania. In this
way, tension between Russia and Turkey is stoked. Austria tells Turkey
he thinks Turkey should have Rumania and promises support the following
year.
<p>Russia occupies Rumania in the fall with A Ukr, supported by F Sev. The
situation is Rus A Rum, Turk A Bul, Aus A Ser and Aus F Gre. Turkey,
meanwhile, has moved to Bla again on Austria's suggestion. Turkey thinks
he has an ally in Austria against Russia. Russia thinks he has an ally
in Austria against Turkey. The Italian, meanwhile, takes Tunis and grows
more convinced a Lepanto might be possible.
<p>Austria's opening for Spring 1902:
<p>A Vie-Gal
<br>A Bud support Turkish A Ank (a new one) -Rum (via Bla)
<br>A Ser-Gre
<br>F Gre-Aeg
<br>A Tri-Ser
<p>This is a risk since it leaves Trieste unguarded, but the Italian,
increasingly certain of the Lepanto after Turkey builds an army and is
supported into Rum, sees the merits in an alliance with Austria. In the
fall, he vacates Ven, moving to Tuscany.
<p>For Spring 1902, Italy moves:
<p>A Ven hold
<br>F Nap-Ion
<br>F Ion-EMe
<br>A Tun hold
<p>Remember, the Turk moves:
<p>A Ank-Bla-Rum
<br>A Bul support A Ank-Rum
<br>F Bla convoy A Ank-Rum
<br>A Con support A Bul
<p>The Russian has moved:
<p>A Rum hold (dislodged and destroyed)
<br>F Sev support A Rum
<br>A War-Ukr
<p>So, the Russian is now angry at Austria. But his army has been destroyed
and he is impotent to do anything about the incursion into Galicia.
Warsaw is also exposed. The Turk, meanwhile, is confused. Austria has
helped him into Rumania, as agreed,but moved to Aegean. Moreover, the
Italian - as Turkey had suspected since the build - is going for a
Lepanto.
<p>Tense exchanges take place between Austria and Turkey and Russia. The
Austrian blitzes both with messages, telling Turkey the move to Aeg was
to bounce the Italian who had requested support there... what a cunning
devil that Italian is etc... looks certain he is going for the Lepanto.
Profuse apologies to the Russian for the incursion into Galicia and
support for Turkey.. withdrawal to follow immediately etc. More friendly
messages with the Italian (and also with Germany who has Russian units
in Scan to contend with - here Germany now sees some sense in
co-operating with Austria... neother of themwant a strong Russia).
<p>Trust of a sort is re-established with Turkey. The sultan has little
choice in the matter really. Turkey and Austria agree to bounce on Smy
to prevent the Italian taking it.
<p>For the fall, Austria orders:
<br>F Aeg-Bul
<br>A Gre support F Aeg-Bul
<br>A Bud-Rum
<br>A Gal support A Bud-Rum
<br>A Ser support A Bud-Rum
<p>Net result is both the Turkish armies (in Rum and Bul) aredislodged. The
one in Rum is destroyed,the one in Bul retreats to Con as Turkey has
ordered A Con-Smy. He had inadequate support (only Bla) for A Rum.
Support for A Rum from A Bul was cut.
<p>The Italian meanwhile convoys to Syria. The Russian supports F sev with
A Ukr.
<p>So, Austria has the Balkans,. Turkey is finished, Russia is powerless. A
quick dismemberment of Russia follows by both Austria and Germany.
<p>This may have been fluke. I think iot owed a lot to the naivety of both
Russia and Turkey. But it does show how quick and hoew effective
Austrias can be. It relies, specatcularly, on Austria's central position
and the diplomatic influence it exercises in the early stages.
<p>Up Austria (and sorry for long-winded tale)

<H4>From Jim Thiher (<a href=mailto:JThiher@aol.com>JThiher@aol.com</a>):</H4>
<p>I very much enjoyed your article on this unexpected opening.  But I wonder....
<p>Would it be just as effective, and easier to manage if you just present the
whole idea to Italy at the start as a deception to the world to disguise the
A/I alliance?
<p>It just seems to me that Italy could be so spooked by your opening and
especially by your SILENCE in the early going, that you may never be able to
garner his trust in a way that would aid your long term plans.
<p>Just a thought.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
<p>Yours is the second response to make this point, and I agree that this is
also a good way to play it (and in retrospect, I should have spent more
time on that possibility).
<p>So far, then, it's two mails saying, "tell Italy" versus one saying, "Yes!
This is exactly what I need as Austria -- a way to force Italy into alliance
without risk."
</i></blockquote>
<p>
<H4>From Mike Connaghan (<a href=mailto:mdconnag@concentric.net>mdconnag@concentric.net</a>):</H4>
<p>I have a comment about your devious and excellent Blue Water Lepanto
article
in the Winter 1999 Zine,
in which you guide Austria to an opening against Turkey with eventual
help from
Italy.
<p>In it, one suggestion for means of diploming with Turkey is lying about
cooperation
with him. For example, you suggest telling him that Austria let him have
Greece,
when in reality Austria will bounce him in Greece. This despicable and
immoral
lie serves to prevent Turkey from moving to Serbia, which YOU SAY would
let
Turkey have two builds.
<p>However, it seems to me that Austria could also order Tri-Ser in Fall
1901. This
would prevent Turkey from taking Serbia, and an Austrian army would
already
take Greece. The new Austro-Italian alliance would be that much more
advanced.
The best would be if Turkey were made to not move to either Serbia OR
Greece.
This would give Austria two builds and achieve the best possible
advance. What's
more, Italy should have even more reason to believe that Austria is not
Turkey's
friend. A possible pledge of turning Greece over to Italy or support for
taking
Smy should help the cause.
<p>There is still the nasty risk that Italy is annoyed enough to join
Turkey
(and/or Russia) against you, but that is what good diplomatic skills are
for. Italy
should be made to see how clear your intentions are, especially after
the Spring
1902 Retreat Ion-Eas or Ion-Aeg.
<p>The reason Austria should be reasonably safe to move Tri-Ser in Fall
1901 is
that Italy should, as you said, feel obliged to support himself in Ven.
Even if
Italy dashes into Tri, it would require that Ser-Gre and Tri-Ser both
succeeded,
and Austria would still get a build. This may give Austria more reason
to be
nervous, but it is still quite reasonable to think that an
Austro-Italian alliance
can be formed --and with an even greater element of surpise. Besides,
the
odds of Ven-Tri are low. Either way, an Austrian/Italian alliance only
gains by
trying for both Ser and Gre.
<p>So I'd suggest that Austria instead try to prevent Turkey from moving to
either
Gre or Ser. It's logical to enhance the illusion of an Austria seeking
Turkish
alliance by offering support for Bul-Rum, or simply hide the truth even
longer
(past the Fall 1901 moves) by asking him to let you take Gre and Ser in
return for future help against Russia.
<p>There's no guarantees in life or Diplomacy, but there are some
strategies that
offer attractive probabilities. The real question is can you do all this
without
ticking off all your neighbors?
<p>And finally, I have to reiterate that there's no room in this game for
inflexibility.
Unless you want to play that way. Aw, heck, do what you want. As long as
it's actually what I want you to want....

<hr WIDTH="100%">
<H4>From Brendan McClure (<a href=mailto:bmcclure@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca>bmcclure@gpu.srv.ualberta.ca</a>):</H4>
<p>I believe you have personally caused severe damage to the Diplomacy
community with that article.
<p>Please, hear me out. You did make some very excellent points in there,
like that AT is a good alliance when the precendent is that it is not.
But I believe you made one horrid, disturbing mistake, that has scarred
the game. Before the article, everything was fine. Austria and Italy
could do things together, like Lepanto, or ignore each other and pursue
thier own goals. Now, after reading your article, I believe people get
the impression that the best thing for Italy to do is attack Austria in
1901. Sure, you said this should not be done unless Italy has rock-solid
agreements with R or T, but this is often ignored in comparison to the
main statement that Italy should not be afraid to attack Austria. Let me
provide some examples. I have been chosen as Austria an abnormally large
amount since the GiD came out, so I would consider myself a master on
this subject. All of the following examples are no-press (eg. no
rock-solid agreement with R or T exists) and were all petty one SC
stabs.
<p><i>[Editor's note: In his letter, Mr. McClure provides us with
the names and judges for the games he mentions, but I have removed those for
the sake of preserving gunboat.]</i>
<p>Game 1.
This one is my favorite of a stupid thing for Italy to
do
<p>S1901M: A Ven S F Tri
<br>F1901: A Ven -> Tri
<br>Net result: I was gone by 1904, Italy soon after RT bowled him over.
<p>Game 2, 1898 variant
<p>S1900M: A Ven -> Tri (*bounce*)
<p>Right, he has two units and he plans on bouncing me when all his
neighbors will soon be too large for him to defend against? He and I
will die at the hands of an R or T twice as large as us. It is going to
happen, I know it.
<p>Game 3:
<p>S1901: A Ven -> Tri
<p>This is an RT game. Italy is soon to be gone. Turkey is in the Ion, and
Italy has NOTHING to defend it with. All his units are in Adr, Tri, Tyl
and Ven.
<p>Basically, I am trying to point out to you either the error in your
logic, or the fact that you hid away the most important point about IA
wars, namely the rock-solid agreement. I am tired of teaching Italy a
lesson, and I am trying to see if your article is the source of these
recent crises. It could be just that people are trying out your
suggestion. I did. This you'll love.
<p>Game 4, WGP-
<p>I am Italy. I had the rock-solid agreement with T, so I felt I could
stab A. And how!
<p>Movement results for Fall of 1901.  (torres1.002)
<p>Italy: Army Venice -> Trieste.
<br>Italy: Army Tyrolia -> Vienna.
<br>Italy: Fleet Ionian Sea -> Greece.
<p>Austria:   2 Supply centers,  3 Units:  Removes  1 unit.
<br>Italy:     6 Supply centers,  3 Units:  Builds   3 units.
<p>Is this more of what you were planning when you wrote that article?
WRONG! My previous agreements to have Russia go north were distracted by
a tasty Austrian corpse, and Turkey felt the same. Only natural that
they now put aside thier differences and hostile Armenian armies and
ally. I am now down to three units, with Turkish fleets in Nap and Ion.
Austria is still at two, despite 1902 attempts by Turkey and I to kill
him, before the Juggernaut formed.
<p>I would love to hear how your thoughts have changed since GiD was
published. Perhaps you agree with me. Perhaps not. Perhaps you didn't
choose to read my email. All this is fine. Just please never be Italy on
the same judge as me, just to be sure. :)
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
<p>First, be certain that I listen to the most severe critics of my work as
closely as those who praise it. You have good company, in that Grant Flowers
(no slouch of a diplomat) also has deep reservations about what I'm doing to
the minds of Dippers. Let me reply to you as best I can. Also, I'm going to
be sure that Manus publishes this exchange in the Pouch.
<p>Setting aside your thesis statement that I've ruined the game ;-), let's
move to your next point, on which we can both agree: if Italians attack
Austrians in S01 without securing those agreements with Russia and Turkey
(you do not mention it, but they must also judge the conditions to be
favorable in the West as well), they are acting *contrary* to the advice of
my article, not in accord with it. I tried to make that as absolutely clear
as possible in my article, and I'll take this moment to repeat: it is *bad*
play for Italy to attack Austria in S01 without setting up the ideal
diplomatic conditions for the assault across the *whole* board. Anything
less than ideal simply will not do.
<p>Now, let's move on to your no-press examples. First, I think it should go
without saying that it is simply *impossible* to carry out the advice I gave
for playing Italy in a no-press game. [Side note: if you really want to
improve, stop playing no-press. Just a personal opinion.] I would certainly
hope that no Italian player would ever cite my article (or, for that matter,
the "Go Fasta" article) as a reason for attacking Austria in S01 in
no-press. Second, however, I see that you do not yet have any direct
evidence that these attacks were motivated by my article. It's my
understanding that this kind of bad no-press play by Italy occurred well
before I ever arrived on the scene with my articles. I wouldn't be so quick
to conclude that my own articles motivated these attacks. Let's be clear
about it, though, so that there is no misunderstanding: the Italian leader
who attacks Austria in S01 of a no-press game and cites my article is
horribly misapplying the logic of the article. I can't be more clear than
that.
<p>Moving on to your last example, the game in which you successfully stabbed
Austria, but later fell prey to a Russo-Turkish alliance, I have a few
observations. First, a successful 1901, as measured by SC-grabbing, does not
predict much in the way of long-term success. I'm pretty sure that I recall
somewhere in the Pouch, there is an article containing statistical analysis
that Germany wins fewer games after a three-build start than after a
two-build start. Early Leader Syndrome can be a powerful force, and a
difficult one to master in response.
<p>Second, if you had a solid alliance agreement with Turkey, what were you
doing grabbing Greece in 1901 instead of giving it to Turkey and sharing the
builds more evenly? Little wonder that Turkey was motivated to switch
alliances, after you took three builds in 1901 while he settled for Bulgaria
and war with Russia. I can't really critique your diplomacy without seeing
it, but what little you've told me makes me suspect that you sacrificed too
much of the global long-term thinking I tried to encourage to get that 3-SC
1901. Perhaps if you had given higher priority to alliance maintenance with
Turkey on this occassion, Turkey would have been more motivated to pursue
I-T than R-T?
<p>Third, alliance-shifting happens. For that matter, unpredictable humanity
happens. Geography lays a nice foundation for crafting strategies, but one
simply can't force ideal geographic strategies to come about. That's why you
always need a "Plan B" and a "Plan C". I tried to emphasize that, as well,
for the Italian situation. This logic is not any less true as the game wears
on. When you feel the ground shifting under you, you have to adapt new ways
to cope. In your case, it seems pretty clear that you needed to start
adapting the moment you got a three build 1901, Turkey became concerned, and
Russia was not so committed to a northern campaign that he couldn't turn
around and pursue new strategies. [BTW, you mentioned nothing about western
affairs in your analysis, though I tried to emphasize that, in all cases,
Italian strategy would be as strongly affected by events in the West as
events in the East.]
<p>Perhaps that "severe damage" I've done will be curbed by my article
appearing in this issue entitled "The New World Order". Readers of my work
will see that, in general application, I do not endorse the S01 lunge attack
at a neighboring power in PBEM play. This advice applies to Italian players
as much as any other power. This advice goes double or triple for no-press
play. My new article restates something I've said before, but perhaps bears
repeating for emphasis: Caissic/Geographic principles lay an important
foundation for good play, but diplomatic evaluations must *always* be held
as the more value-weighted portion of any fornula for good play. [So I say
again, quit playing no-press :-)] Pursuing what is diplomatically possible
must always trump pursuing what is Caissically/Geographically ideal. Just as
other people before me have emphasized that one should never damage a good
alliance relationship to snatch up extra SCs, I'll also emphasize that one
should never lightly throw away multilateral opportunities (see New World
Order) in the mad unilateral pursuit of Geography and tempo. The name of the
game is "Diplomacy".
<p>A final word on no-press: There is a tremendous misimpression that no-press
is a pure game of tactics which, apparently, leads to the possibility of a
misimpression that Geography principles can be blindly applied in no-press
to improve results. Nothing could be further from the truth. The importance
of good individual tactics is elevated in no-press, but so is the importance
of understanding how to identify and pursue alliances when only severely
limited and abstract communication is allowed. The limited nature of that
communication makes it *more* important, not less, that you pay attention to
the signals others are sending via their play and mold your own play around
them. If ideal geographic play must always be tempered by knowing what is
diplomatically possible, then the no-press environment, which puts severe
limits on diplomatic possibilities, is the least likely environment in which
to force geographically ideal strategies to come about. It should go without
saying that, if you lunge at a neighbor in S01 in no-press, you have done so
with *zero* evaluation of the diplomatic signals of others. You should not
expect to succeed.
<p>I hope this clarifies things; not just for you, Brendan, but for everyone.

<H4>From Cliff Johnson (<a href=mailto:cjohnson@stclair.cc.mi.us>cjohnson@stclair.cc.mi.us</a>):</H4>
<p>As I was reading "Geography is Destiny" I noted with interest that the
ratings of country success rates differed quite a bit from the old pbm
figures cited in Avalon Hill's Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy.  What I
remember most is that Russia used to be high solo/high elimination,
being knocked right out second only to Austria, while Austria was the
second highest winner.  Germany was much better in those figures, being
a third high-solo/high elimination nation.  I wonder if you were aware
of this and if you had any thoughts on what might cause the difference
in results.
<p>My gut feeling is that Diplomacy is a better balanced game than the 1995
figures you cited make it out.  Is it possible that inexperienced
players, not knowing any better, are more likely to take the less
desireable countries, thereby slanting the stats even more?  It also
occurs to me that part of the problem may be that some countries are
just plain easier to play competently than others--case in point is your
analysis that suggests that people have been misplaying Italy.  I think
the same might be said for Germany, which is a tough draw but a country
which gives a much more likely shot at a solo than Italy or even more
solid countries, like Turkey.

ratings of country success rates differed quite a bit from the old pbm
figures cited in Avalon Hill's Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy.  What I
remember most is that Russia used to be high solo/high elimination,
being knocked right out second only to Austria, while Austria was the
second highest winner.  Germany was much better in those figures, being
a third high-solo/high elimination nation.  I wonder if you were aware
of this and if you had any thoughts on what might cause the difference
in results.</blockquote>
<p><i>Actually, I am aware that it didn't always used to be this way. Stephen Agar
has commented on RGD in the past that, back in the day, powers fared
differently. I've heard that all of the center powers used to be much
better, that England used to be considered the strongest power on the board,
France's results were closer to average, and no one ever wanted to be
Turkey.</i>
<p><blockquote>My gut feeling is that Diplomacy is a better balanced game than the 1995
figures you cited make it out.</blockquote>
<p><i>I actually agree to a point. The starting positions *are* imbalanced, but
experienced players, being aware of that, should make sure that awarenesses
of imbalances inform their strategies from the beginning. This should lead
to balanced play, even on an imbalanced board. But IMO it all begins with
understanding the balances inherent in the board, which was a good reason
for me to write the article (or so my thinking went :-)).</i>
<p><blockquote>Is it possible that inexperienced
players, not knowing any better, are more likely to take the less
desireable countries, thereby slanting the stats even more?</blockquote>
<p><i>Definitely. I think that the pernicious effect of the power assignment
aspect of the Judge program is underapprectiated. If I were king of the
Dippers, I'd banish that as a strategy and have the Judge randomly assign
powers in every game. Methinks, however, that would make me an unpopular
monarch, which is why things are the way they are, because people like it
that way.</i>
<p><blockquote>It also
occurs to me that part of the problem may be that some countries are
just plain easier to play competently than others--case in point is your
analysis that suggests that people have been misplaying Italy.  I think
the same might be said for Germany, which is a tough draw but a country
which gives a much more likely shot at a solo than Italy or even more
solid countries, like Turkey.</blockquote>
<p><i>How can I but agree with you, seeing that the majority of my assertions at
the end of my article about commonly held perceptions that I believe are
wrong involved Germany?  Probably the single worst wrong that's been done to
Germany and to England together is all of those articles on opening strategy
that tell you that E-G is a bad alliance for Germany. So in PBEM, you have a
much tougher time, as England, convincing Germany to ally with you, and you
wind up opening F Lon-Nth much more often than F Lon-Eng. I think that there
is a relationship between this and the fact that England and Germany both do
more poorly now than in the past, while France does much better.
<p>When I said in the article that I prefer England as an ally when I play
Germany, I practice what I preach. That was my opening alliance in each of
the last two games I played as Germany. When I say that I am not afraid of
England's stab potential, it's because in each of those games, I
successfully stabbed England, to the point where he was eliminated before
game end in both games. Unfortunately, I managed to get stalemated both
games and settled for a 4WD and a 3WD, but I think the point is made: a
well-led Germany can prosper in an E-G alliance.
<p>E-G is also just plain better for both powers. The dynamic of the E-G allows
a two-front attack to be pursued against the two most powerful corner powers
early on in the game. E-G working together can reliably and decisively
squeeze both F and R out of their northern neutrals, then out of their home
centers. Contrast this with the E-F, or F-G combinations, the success of
which leaves the successful powers in control of fewer overall centers and
which also leaves Russia to her own devices, generally to the greater
detriment of both E and G.
<p>The tired advice to Germany to eschew alliances with England sacrifices the
longer-term strategic benefits of that alliance on the altar of fearing the
short term stab. That's not right.
<p>There's a similar dynamic in the south, with the mighty reputation of the
"Juggernaut" making life way too easy for Russia and way too difficult for
Austria. It is primarily the Sultan who needs to wake up and smell the
Turkish coffee on this score, but Austrians who irrationally fear A-T
alliances (the mirror of Germans who irrationally fear the E-G alliance)
also get their share of the blame.
<p>My hope in writing Geography is Destiny was that, if players knew the
geographic score from the beginning, they might formulate their strategies
in a different manner -- restoring some needed balance to the game.</i>

<p>Thank you for the thoughtful response to my letter.
<p>Your series on Caissic analyses was very interesting and rewarding -- I found
them
particularly useful as a check against hastily judging other powers by SC
count
alone -- however, I think that it is your "Geography is Destiny" that calls
for a
real paradigm shift, and a welcome one at that.
<p>Your commentary on 'Fear Factor' will (I hope) become a Diplomacy standard
because it explains so much that otherwise gets lost in the mass of
competing
details and theories.  One of the special things about playing Germany I
find is
that it is only when you've played that power that you begin to appreciate
the
nearly paranoid attitude of German governments since Germany became a
unified
state.  The fear goes both ways, of course.  A German player is always
afraid of
being hit from an unexpected quarter, but all his neighbors know that he's
capable of explosive growth (that's what's happening in my current game).  I
think it takes a real Bismark type to get the best out of Germany, but as
you
point out it can certainly be done.  That's why I responded in my last
letter to
the suggestion implicit in those statistics--that Germany was a bad draw,
7th
out of seven.  Well, somebody's got to be last, but Germany is an emminently
playable country, as we both agree.
<p>What will be really interesting is to see whether people start playing Italy
more along the lines that you suggest, with Austria and France sharply
defined
as enemies #1 & #2.  Both Turkey and Italy should start moving up in the
stats
if players of those countries start looking elsewhere than at each other as
their natural routes of expansion.
<p>Please keep those articles coming.

<H4>From Jim (<a href=mailto:JimdOzz@aol.com>JimdOzz@aol.com</a>):</H4>
<p>I'm afraid I disagree with both Chris and Edi. I think the lack of growth in
Dip, particularly in the U.S. is due to two interconnected cultural
movements. First, the general softening of the population. Psychologically
Diplomacy is a very tough game to take. This has to do with the psychology of
"selling." A complete explanation of this could take pages. The short cut
explanation of this is that when we reach an agreement with another player in
a Dip game which involves something that player wants us to do we are
emotionally connected to that player.  We therefore expect that player to
reciprocate. When, instead of reciprocating, this player stabs us we react
emotionally. It's very much like unrequited love. Second is computer games.
We can now sit in front of a computer and try to conquer the world in an
afternoon. And if the computer gets the upper hand we can just turn it off.
What could be better that playing war games and never having to lose.
<p>The real question here is, of course, DIAS vs voted draws and by extension
the scoring system I use at "DonCon". Dip comes with a very simple scoring
system. 18 centers wins everything  else is less than that.  When played
within the confines of a tournament where the results of several boards have
to be compared, and within time  restrictions (some people want to sleep &
most have to go to work on Monday) the simple beauty of this falls apart. It
then becomes necessary to create a new one.  The lowering of victory criteria
(as they have done it Denver) it one way to approach it. My system is
intended to make the game move faster.  Generally speaking, to play it
successfully you have to play agressively and take chances.  My choice of
voted draws is intended to reward those who have achieved some degree of
success in a given game. I feel it is more important to reward success than
to protect the unsuccessful. Darwin as applied to Dip.
<p>Whether this has an effect on turnout at "DonCon" is unclear. Overall,
participation has declined some. However, there are factors other than the
scoring system which can have an effect on participation. A good sign is the
fact that the number of players increased in 1999 over 1998.
