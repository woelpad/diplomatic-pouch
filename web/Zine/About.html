About The Zine
</CENTER>
</H1>
<H3>Welcome to The Zine!</H3>
Allow me to take this opportunity to
congratulate you on such a fine choice of reading material.  You
couldn't have done better, my friend.  <B>The Diplomatic Pouch</B> Zine
is working to become <i>the</i> pre-eminent magazine for the Diplomacy
hobby. Your participation as a reader and contributor is necessary for
this charter to be fullfilled.  In addition to presenting some information
which would be useful to even the most casual reader, this page discusses
the ways in which you can -- and should -- get involved.
<P><hr>
<H3>Legalities</H3>
<IMG align=left hspace=5 HEIGHT=117 WIDTH=367 SRC="Common/diplogo.gif">
Diplomacy and the Diplomacy logo are
registered trademarks of Hasbro, Inc.
<!The Avalon Hill Game Company of Baltimore, Maryland.>
All players of <i>The Game</i> should include Hasbro in their daily prayers.
Without Hasbro, there would be no Diplomacy.  Well, okay, that's not
at all true, but we do owe a lot to Hasbro.  We thank and praise Hasbro
for their willingness to support the play of Diplomacy in any of a
multitude of forums.  On bended knee, we acknowledge their generosity in
making available to us the rights to electronically reproduce and distribute
maps.  With humble and contrite hearts, we acknowledge that no person has
a soul until they have purchased the Rules of Diplomacy from Hasbro, if
not a complete gameset.  We also believe that a copy of said rules should be
enshrined under glass in every private household in the world.  We respect
the rights of Hasbro to these rules, and pledge never to violate these
rights.

<H3>Reading The Zine</H3>
While <B>The Diplomatic Pouch</B> Zine is free of obnoxious blinking text
and rapidly changing background colors, it will look best using the latest
version of your Internet browser due to the use of tables and sizing of
graphics that are not supported by all older browsers.
If you don't have the Netscape
Navigator, you can download it from
<A HREF="http://www.netscape.com">http://www.netscape.com</A>.
<P>
The magazine was produced to appear properly when viewed with the Netscape
browser (statistics indicate that this browser is used by over 75% of the
Internet community).  Readers using other web browsers (Mosaic, NetCruiser)
will not see the magazine in its full glory.  The Editor will go to some
effort to ensure that non-Netscape users will not be too unhappy with the
display of the magazine, but he will err on the side of Netscape.

<H3>Publication Schedule</H3>
<B>The Diplomatic Pouch</B> Zine is published five times a year.
These issues will be "named" the Spring Movement, Spring Retreat, Fall
Movement, Fall Retreat, and Winter Adjustment issue.  The submission
and publication deadlines are shown below:
<P>
<center>
<table border>
<th>&nbsp;<th>Submission Deadline<th>Publication Date
<tr><th>Spring Movement Issue<td align=center>March 1<td align=center>March 31
<tr><th>Spring Retreat Issue<td align=center>May 1<td align=center>May 31
<tr><th>Fall Movement Issue<td align=center>August 1<td align=center>August 31
<tr><th>Fall Retreat Issue<td align=center>October 1<td align=center>October 31
<tr><th>Winter Adjustment Issue<td align=center>December 1<td align=center>December 31
</table>
</center>
<P>
This schedule is easy to remember using the following rule:  the deadlines
fall in every month which has 31 days but which does not begin with the
letter "J."
<P>
The Adjustment issue is intended to be a larger issue than the Movement
issue, while the Retreat issue may go to press without regular columns and
may therefore be a smaller issue than the Movement issue.

<H3>Submitting to The Diplomatic Pouch Zine</H3>
Interested in contributing? Of course you are! First read the <a href="Common/submission.html">submission guidelines</a>.
<!-- Articles may be submitted to the <a href="mailto:editor@diplom.org">Editor</a> of <B>The Diplomatic Pouch</B> Zine at any
time prior to the submission deadline for inclusion in the next issue of the
magazine.  Articles submitted in this way will be edited by the Editor
<i>only</i> to correct misspellings and grammatical errors.  Editing for
content will not be done.
<P>
Submitters who wish their article to be reviewed for content should obtain from
the Editor the name of one or more of the available <B>submission
editors</B>, to whom the article should be sent for review.  The names and
addresses of the current submission editors are found below, and volunteers
who wish to add themselves to the board of submission editors are always
welcome.  In rare circumstances, the Editor may exercise his reserved right
to refer an article to an editor for comment and discussion before publication,
but only after consulting with the author.
<P>
Submitters who wish their article to be reviewed for content <B>anonymously</B>
should mail the article to the Editor with this request, and a single
submission editor will be asked to review it and return comments to the
Editor, who will in turn forward these comments to the author.  Regardless
of any comments made by a submission editor, an article may <i>always</i> be
submitted using the first procedure described (that is, direct submission to
the Editor for only textual editing).  Submission editors are chosen by
the Editor from among those leading lights of the hobby willing to offer
their eye.
<P> Articles in HTML format will be strongly preferred by the Editor, but ASCII
text can be converted by the Editor by hand. -->
