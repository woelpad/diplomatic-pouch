My [? fantasy] sees Germany, the Central Powers, winning the war.   Britain sued for a truce, and Germany gleefully accepted.
<p>
The U.S. either remained neutral in furious indignant response to the British adventure in Mexico &mdash or actally assisted Germany in breaking the blockade and supplying food and finance.  Even my imagination isn't so fervent to see a declaration of war on the Allies.

<b>Considerations and uninintended consequences</b>
<p>
There are always unintended consequences to consider, aren't there?
<p>
In the factual story, the British faced a dilemma or two.  In all cipher-breaking, the party breaking face these consequences and  considerations.  The British didn't want Germany to know they had deciphered this message. Additional valuable information could be collected if Germany was blissfully unaware it was being overheard.  They wanted, however, to share it with the U.S. to toss that "final straw" on the camel's back.  
<p>
This was the age of "gentlemen don't read other gnetlemen's mail".  Wilson particulary was attempting to conduct an ethical foreign policy.
<p>
Might there be a negative reaction from the U.S. in having had a diplomatic message, innocently sent by its ambassador in Berlin intercepted, decrypted and read?  It's analogous to informing a friend or family member about an unfaithful partner.  There were definitely higher stakes involved here.
<p>
The solution was something out of James Bond.  The original telegram was sent to the German ambassador in Washington. It was to be forwarded from Washington to Mexico City. 
<p>
The British had an agent in Mexico City burgle the telegraph office!
<p>
It was genius.  The British could share the <i>purloined</i> message.  The security of the American cable remained, apparently, <i>politely</i> secure.  
<p>
But, the story gets even better!
<p>
The Ambassor in Washington re-encrypted the telegram in an older cipher.
<p>
Not only could the Brits explain how they came into posession of the telegram, with an "honourable" explanation to the Americans,  but the Germans would continue to believe the <i>new</i> code was still secure.  They did, in fact, continue to use it (and be overheard) during the remainder of the war.
<p>
I was troubled about the re-encrypt.  Why?  It seemed too serendipitous.  I think it can be reasonably explained by the ambassador in Mexico City not having the most current code book.  Why would the envoy to a relatively unimportant neutral have need for it?  <i><b>Need to know</b></i> is a fundamental of security.
