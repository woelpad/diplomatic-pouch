Last Man Standing is a puzzle on the Diplomacy board, whereby the whole board gets reduced to a single unit. This unit must reach its final destination in a mere four game years, without any power capturing any neutral centers and with all powers still possessing at least one unit at the end of the second year. Your goal is to reconstruct the complete game history from the map given. For more details, read the <a href="../../S2017M/LMS/rollcall.html">LMS Roll Call</a>.

<h3 id="lvp-rom">Mission: All Roads Lead to Rome</h3>

<p>An odd statement perhaps, since most roads so far led to Berlin. But if we
focus on the location of Rome on the Diplomacy board, we can see that
there's some truth to the adagio. Or rather, that the reverse, that all
roads lead <i>through</i> Rome, is easy to refute. Rome is in the center of
this small strip of land called the Italian boot, with the Tyrrhenian Sea
on one side and the Adriatic separating it from the Balkans somewhere on
the other side. For armies crossing East to West or vice versa it's easier
to take the land route through Venice, while fleets will pass underneath
through the Ionian. South-North passages will usually completely avoid the
Italian boot.</p>

<p>Things would improve a little if Rome were to be lumped together with
Tuscany, as in the Milan variant. As it stands, Rome in the context of Last
Man Standing is perhaps best remembered, or renowned, for the frequent
difficulties one has in removing the army starting in it.
This has to do in part with the fact that it's one of only four home
centers that cannot be captured in the first year, not even with the help
of a friendly convoy (involving in this case fleet Naples). The other
centers are Liverpool, starting point of the English army that features in
so many LMS puzzles, Moscow which we'll analyze below, and Smyrna, another
center at the far end of the map. Compared to those Rome is pretty central
on the map, and yet it's not easy to reach quickly.</p>

<p>This in fact makes it all the more attractive as a final destination point,
as units get the time to choose their paths. And that's what we're going to
do here. Army Liverpool is prompted to find its way to Rome from Britannia,
one of the furthest outposts of the Roman empire, to Rome to perform in the
Circus and become the Last Gladiator (I mean Man) Standing. Bread and games!</p>

<h3 id="GA-nap">Mission: See Naples and Die</h3>

<p>This phrase was popularized by Goethe, and so it's fitting that a German
army triumphs in Naples, in the hopes that it dies on the spot and leaves
us with an empty board. To get to the exact same end position as shown
below, I offer the following riddle.

<h3 id="lms_lvp-mos">Report: Scorched Earth &mdash; Army Liverpool to Moscow</h3>

<p>I'm going to try and prove that it isn't all that difficult to reconstruct
the whole game from just the single map that is given. Let's take a close
look at it.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/lms_lvp-mos13.gif" target="_blank"><img src="images/lms_lvp-mos13.gif" width="60%" alt="Army Liverpool to Moscow, After Winter 1903"/><br/><b>Army Liverpool to Moscow, After Winter 1903<br/><i><small>Click to enlarge in separate window</small></i></b></a></p>

<p>The first thing to observe are the paths that the two raiders (the French
and English armies) took, prominently marked by the centers they captured
on the way. Since it's only 1903, they can have at most captured three each
so far, at a distance of at the most two tempi between each. England
captured Kiel and Berlin before landing in Warsaw. France captured Munich,
Venice and Budapest before Sevastopol. But because there can only be three,
we can deduce that Munich was taken by the second French army, A Par, while
it was A Mar that took the three other and is still on the board. In
principle any of the centers that England captured in Germany could also
have been captured by a fleet, but for the French army there can be no
doubt, because Budapest can be reached no earlier than 1902 and only by
army Marseilles. It could move through Tyrolia instead of Venice, but what
would be the point of that?</p>

<p>Let us next consider the units that start the furthest away from the
destination, because they define in great part how others must move,
particularly the snipers sent out to intercept them. In the West we have F
Bre and A Lvp (which we already know a lot about), in the South there's A
Rom and F Nap. We're not so concerned about F Tri, because chances are good
that it will either get dislodged in Fall 1901 or disbanded in Winter 1901,
prompted by a loss of centers.</p>

<p>We determined that A Lvp will make landfall in Kiel in Fall 1901. For that
to happen F Kie must move to Heligoland Bight and one of the English fleets
(probably F Lon) to the North Sea. France is gaining centers, so cannot
disband its F Bre. Sevastopol is too far away and St. Petersburg can only
be reached in Spring 1903, too late to be dislodged, since the (Austrian)
attacker would otherwise appear on the After Winter 1903 map. This means
that F Bre will need to be swept. This requires two snipers. The two sniper
countries are Russia and Germany, since both will be completely eliminated
in the end. Germany already has F Kie in the area. A German army would not
be of much use, as most territories around the Bight and the North Sea are
either a sea or a supply center. The better option is to call in the
cavalry, in the form of F Stp/sc, which can reach the North Sea in just 4
turns if moving through the Baltic Sea and Denmark. Combined they can sweep
two fleets in 1902 (actually F Bre will attack F Lon in the North Sea
first), so the remaining fleet, F Edi should try to reach St. Petersburg,
where it will get dislodged by the Austrian army there, as this is still
1902.</p>

<p>Let's turn South. There the situation is slightly more complicated. We know
that Italy takes Trieste, but we don't know if that will be in 1901 or
1902, as it's the only center that Italy captures. If it's in 1902, then it
can disband F Nap, but A Rom will probably still be in Rome after the first
year, supporting A Mar into Venice to dislodge F Tri there, or moved up to
Piedmont or Tyrolia. If it's in 1901, F Nap will still be around, as it's
one of those units that cannot be dislodged in the first year. It would
need to move to Trieste or Turkey to find a spot to die. Let's leave this
open for a while and check up on Austria and Germany.</p>

<p>Austria looks poised to lose centers. The only centers that it keeps in the
end are Vienna and St. Petersburg, which it can only take in 1902. To get
there, it needs to have at the end of 1901 an army in either Warsaw,
Ukraine or Sevastopol. But why would we capture a center when we're trying
to lose home centers? That makes the Ukraine the natural choice and favors
the strategy of Italy taking Trieste in 1901.</p>

<p>Germany has another problem. It's bound to lose all its home centers by
1902, when A Lvp takes Berlin. Without any other centers it would
effectively be eliminated at this point, something that the standard LMS
rules forbid. To prevent this it should take a center in the first year and
lose it in the third year. Why not take it in the second year? Because with
only one center after 1901 its remaining unit, F Kie, would have the double
task of eliminating the 2 fleets in the West and grab that extra center,
something it clearly can't do in a single year.</p>

<p>The only centers lost in the third year are those that have units on it on
the After Winter 1903 map, Warsaw and Sevastopol. Only Warsaw can be
reached by Germany in 1901, so that decides it. Now, Russia can do a
similar thing to keep its numbers up. Keeping a maximum number of snipers
around can only work to our advantage. We know that Budapest will be taken
by France in 1902. Taking it in 1901 with A War accomplishes two things:
Russia keeps its full strength and Austria can disband a second unit.</p>

<p>The biggest remaining obstacle is to decide how to handle Turkey. As in the
original Holmes story we can dedicate two Russian units to the task, F Sev
and A Mos. Turkey still has all its home centers, but nothing else in 1903.
Should we let it take Sevastopol in 1901? There seems to be no benefit in
there. We can as well take out a first Turkish unit in Armenia and move
another to Sevastopol in 1902. Or even beyond to Galicia or the Ukraine if
convoying  to Rumania or Sevastopol first. Or even Moscow, since we know
that Russia can retake it in 1903.</p>

<p>What about F Nap? If we send it to Turkey, it would be in the Aegean Sea at
the end of 1901. Then moving through Constantinople in the Spring, it would
burst into the Black Sea in Fall. By strategically placing F Ank on its
path and with F Sev in Armenia, it could first take out the Turkish fleet
in F02, then A Con in Sevastopol in S03, before being dislodged in turn by
A Mar in F03. Immensely effective, all thanks to that Russian fleet in
Armenia.</p>

<p>Let's try out what we've learned so far.</p>

<p>There are a few units that haven't been mentioned yet, such as A Ven and A
Vie. With the assistance of A Mun, we can set these up to dislodge the
raider, A Ven. Note how A Bud moves around Galicia to get to the Ukraine
without blocking A War.</p>

<p>We can use A Ber either to remove A Par in Ber or F Edi in St. Petersburg.
Since A Par can move all the way to Moscow and F Edi not, the choice is
easy. But can we allow Turkey to take a Russian home center? No, because
Russia would only have one left, which wouldn't be sufficient to reduce the
unit count to three. Can we avoid it? Yes, by sending A Con to the Ukraine
(again). Now, we would like very much to keep F Sev in the game, but in
fact the two armies are more useful.</p>

<p>Did you see this coming? Perhaps you were already satisfied obtaining a
situation with four units in the last year? That would be close, but no
cigar. Note also how the German army manages to end up in Finland, quite an
uncommon sight.</p>

<p>The final stage. Livonia would serve just as well, but given the prominence
of the Ukraine in this solution, it's fitting to visit there one more time.</p>

<h3 id="lms_mar-stp">Report: The Winter Capital &mdash; French Army to St. Petersburg</h3>

<p>Let's compare the problem map with the final map of the previous solution.</p>

<p align="center"><a href="images/lms_mar-stp17.gif" target="_blank"><img src="images/lms_mar-stp17.gif" width="60%" alt="French army to St. Petersburg, After Winter 1904"/><br/><b>French army to St. Petersburg, After Winter 1904<br/><i><small>Click to enlarge in separate window</small></i></b></a></p>

<p>You can observe that the whole Southern half up to the line Brest to
Sevastopol is completely identical. This is an indication that for the most
part the same approach can be followed there. It might turn out
differently, but it's a good starting point.</p>

<p>This then already answers the question about which French army is standing
in St. Petersburg. Since A Mar reaches Sevastopol in 1903 and Sevastopol is
two moves from St. Petersburg with Moscow (a home center) in between, it
can be no other than this army. That was easy enough.</p>

<p>Now let's look to the top of the map. There are several changes. London
became French, Kiel is now German, as is Moscow, Warsaw is Austrian, and
St. Petersburg of course is French.</p>

<p>Since Kiel did not become English, but instead London became French, the
natural conclusion is that A Lvp was disbanded in Winter. But who then took
Berlin? It must have been an English fleet, arriving there in 1902 after
passing through the Heligoland Bight. This is slightly problematic for F
Kie, since it can't take up position in the Bight. Luckily there's also the
Skagerrak.</p>

<p>The most significant change compared to the Moscow map is that Germany is
still in the game, with two centers even. That second center is Moscow,
which is on the path from Sevastopol to St. Petersburg, the route that the
French army is taking in the final year. Assuming that there will be four
units left in the final year (which is generally easier to get to than
three), Moscow will be occupied. Moreover Russia will have an army in
Livonia, because that's the only place from where it can support the French
army first to Moscow and then to St. Petersburg. With Livonia and Moscow
already reserved, the fourth unit is going to have to come from Scandinavia
or the waters surrounding it. And there's one perfect candidate for that in
the form of the English fleet spending the Winter of 1902 in Berlin. Two
seasons later it can be in the Gulf of Bothnia, next to St. Petersburg.</p>

<p>With the grand strategy decided it's time to take out the board and put
down the pieces. The finer details can be taken care of on the way.</p>

<p>I used a small variation for the Italian armies, resulting in A Ven
surviving and A Rom being removed. This allows both A Ber and A Vie to
simply hold, but in some circumstances this added flexibility would allow
to move them over to more desirable positions. Note also that Germany did
not capture Warsaw, allowing Russia to build a unit. It's usually advisable
to build one, but looking ahead I don't see any good use for this extra
unit, so waived the build.</p>

<p>All goes according to plan. A Con could again have moved on to the Ukraine,
allowing for a third Russian sniper to remain. But in this case it's
possible to clear the task with just two, so why have more? Meanwhile A Mos
already took up position in Livonia, ahead of schedule.</p>

<h3>Conclusions drawn</h3>

<p>I have attempted to prove that it's feasible to solve LMS puzzles mostly
from the information provided by the final map. It's not completely
straightforward, otherwise there would be no challenge. It can get more
complicated than this, enticing more mental gymnastics. But basically the
techniques outlined here can be reused over and over again. Use them
judiciously.</p>

<p>I'm adding the games <a href="http://uk.diplom.org/?game=lvp-mos">lvp-mos</a>
and <a href="http://uk.diplom.org/?game=mar-stp">mar-stp</a> to UKDP.
These start off where they ended here, in the Winter of 1904. Hop over and
join one to take it further past its logical conclusion.</p>
