<p>
    Well, I want to welcome you, a Novice, to <strong>Diplomacy</strong> &#8212; What we <em>Intermediates</em> call "The Sport of Princes." 
</p>


<p>
 The flag of Switzerland consists of a red flag with a white (a bold, equilateral) cross in the centre [leftmost flag in the title at the top]. It is <em>one of only two</em> square sovereign-state flags, the other being the flag of Vatican City. (The civil and state ensign, used by Swiss ships and boats, has the more common proportions of 3:2.)(Wikipedia: "<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flag_of_Switzerland>Flag of Switzerland</a>" article; February 2016)
<p>
That's pretty interesting, I think.  I will discuss the Vatican in my next article.
<p>
    There's really not a lot to say about Switzerland . . .  
<p>
A sage once said: <em><strong>"You don't want to even go there."</strong></em>  It's used to say that "you do not want to think or talk about something because it is too difficult or unpleasant." (Cambridge Idioms Dictionary, 2nd ed.. (2006)).
<p>
I can't say that it is too difficult or unpleasant to want to think or talk about.  The rules just say it is <em>impassible</em>.
 

That's it on the map below . . .
<p>

<p>
<p>
Switzerland is that little two-tone tan splot in the middle of the map.  From here it looks like a big muddy lake (with stripes) surrounded by Burgundy, Munich, Tyrolia, Piedmont, and Marseille.  Don't say "Moo-nitch" or "Mar-sales" - You'll sound like a prototypical American.   It's <strong>Mew</strong>-nick, and Mar-<strong>say</strong> . . .

</p>
But the <a href=http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/god/one.htm>rules</a> refer to "the ‘impassable’ Switzerland, which alone among the fifteen neutrals cannot have its status violated by a great power."
<p>
It might be small, but a scientific survey was conducted by <a href=http://www.lspace.org/games/afpdip/files/import.html>Murky Research</a>, and Switzerland was considered the third most imporatant area in the game, behind Munich (<strong>Mew</strong>-nick) and the North Sea.
<p>

<p>
<p>
If one <em>could</em> go to Switzerland, you might encounter their National Guard.  I can't speculate how good their soldiers actually are, but they have some <em>awesome kick-ass</em> uniforms.
<p>

It's kind of too bad you can't go there . . .

Here is some recommended reading: <a href=https://www.eda.admin.ch/content/dam/eda/en/documents/das-eda/organisation-eda/Reglement_Protocolaire_E.pdf>Protocol Regulations for the Swiss Confederation</a>.  It is <em>required</em> if you ever want to talk to, or read Laurence Peery &#8212; an Expert <em>par excellence</em> (in his own mind).

<p>
Until the next issue in which I will discuss Ireland.  Who can discuss Ireland without talking about the Roman Catholic church and the Vatican?
<p>
<strong>You don't want to go there!</strong>
