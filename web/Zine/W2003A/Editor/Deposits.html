<H3>Pouch Deposits</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With respect to the lack of Pouch Deposits, I must apologize to the people who did send mail in before January 20th. These were not forwarded to either David or myself and so unfortunately cannot be added to this issue. I am hoping that this will not discourage people from responding in the future. It is my opinion that the insights found in the majority of these e-mails complement the articles in a significant and positive manner.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am looking forward to a huge pouch full of deposits in response to this issue. I think that we have some great articles and anticipate that we'll be getting some feedback on a number of different fronts. The best way to keep the machine moving is to provide it with more fuel. In this case, your feedback is what fuels The Zine.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hi John,
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I've finally found a replacement production co-editor for <A HREF="http://www.diplomacyworld.org/">DIPLOMACY WORLD</A>, Tim Haffey. I've always thought the hobby does best with both the Pouch and Diplomacy World vibrant and active and am happy we're heading back toward that situation.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Good luck. You've got some tough acts to follow, but I'm sure you'll do great!

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sir Owen intended to move his fleet in the Gulf of Lyon to Spain (south coast), his fleet in Naples to the Tyrrhenian Sea, and his fleet in the Ionian Sea to Tunis, thereby pointing an arrow toward Austria and implicating Herr Ostmark--Ostmark, or "Eastern March", being one name for Austria.

<I><B><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That was among the many puns I had inserted. (Did anyone find any of the
others, for example, that the author has done away with himself?).  But
as Holmes said, he suspected that the solution would be "more polyglot
and sophisticated than that contained in the text we have before us."
The suggested solution is in two languages, English and German, just as
the initial solution was, as opposed to three: Greek (through Italian)
and German, for the revised solution.  Further, the arrow created by the
suggested solution would be a rather ragged one.  That said, a
commendation to the reader, for being on the right track.

<H3>Players Needed For Maharajah's Diplomacy Tournament (Maharajiad I)</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Try a variant that has the same basic feel and scale as Standard Diplomacy but which is more balanced: There is a wider variety of play options for all the Powers and stalemate lines are much less likely to have a major influence on games. There are only two comparatively minor rule changes (river convoys and modified chaos builds), so you won't need to spend a lot of time getting up to speed.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So far, there are over four boards filled, so slots for less than 20 players remain open. With some very well known names in the player, GM, and administration columns, the level of play should be high. Please contact the tournament director, David Cohen, at zendip18AToptonlineDOTnet if you are interested in playing or participating in some other way.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rules and info about the variant and the tourney can be found at the <A HREF="http://diplomiscellany.tripod.com/diplomacy/id4.html">variant homepage</A> or in the files section of the <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/maharajahsdiplomacy/">Maharajah's Diplomacy Yahoo! group</A>.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The rules and organization of the Maharajiad are somewhat similar to the Worldmasters Tournament, but there are several significant differences. Here is a summary of some of the most important tournament information:
<OL>
<LI>To register as a player or GM (or if you wish to help out in some other way), contact David E. Cohen. You will need to give your full name. You may, but are not required to, submit a preference list if you wish to enter as a player. Registration to the yahoogroup is highly advisable, since that is where tournament-wide announcements will be made.</LI>
<LI>Board assignments will be completed within one week after a full roster of GMs and players is set.</LI>
<LI>The tournament is individual only; there isn't any team aspect.</LI>
<LI>It is a two round, top-and-advance tournament, with the first round lasting until from 1501 to 1510 -- it is a ten year game -- and the second round having no time limit.</LI>
<LI>This is a "full-press" tournament.</LI>
<LI>GMs may adjudicate "by hand", with Realpolitik, or if a judge keeper permits, by adapting a judge for adjudication, but no player will be required to submit orders directly to a judge.</LI>
<LI>NMRs will be allowed, and the tournament will run on a five-turn basis, at a pace of approximately one game year every two weeks.</LI>
<LI>Each GM will publish results of his or her particular game both in the maharajahsdiplomacy yahoogroup, and in one of his or her usual forums, so as to help publicize the variant.</LI>

<H3>BORUCON V</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BoruCon is a diplomacy-only convention. However, this does not mean that other games are not welcome. The venue is an excellent spot to play other games after, or before the diplomacy, and opens late, allowing lots of game playing. Most players bring their own games to BoruCon, and its very common to see games being played all over the venue.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BoruCon has been held in the Teachers Club since 2003. The Teachers Club is in Parnell Square, which is in Dublin City Center. Located just off O&#8217;Connell Street, there are many restaurants, bars, fast-food joints, shops, cinemas etc, nearby. The Teachers Club has a bar on the premises, and serves a variety of drinks to the weary traveler. An excellent advantage to the venue is that the bar is a subsidized one, thus driving the price of drinks downwards ... making the weary traveler more comfortable in his surroundings. Sandwiches are also available inside the venue itself (as is tea and coffee, as well as beer).
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BoruCon V starts on Friday July 23rd and runs until Sunday July 25th. The first round is on Friday evening, and there is a round on Saturday and Sunday. The Sunday round starts early to allow for plane-catching.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">BoruCon costs 15 EUR per player. For more information or to sign up, just send e-mail to <A HREF="mailto:BoruCon@yahoo.com">BoruCon@yahoo.com</A>.

<H3>EDC 2004</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">EDC 2004 will run from September 23 through to September 26. It will be held in Darmstadt, Germany. Darmstadt, a student city, is in the center of Germany and about 30 kilometers (20 miles) south of the international airport in Frankfurt. The organizers have rented a venue with sleeping accommodations. At this venue, three nights including breakfast and dinner will cost you 69-77 euro. There is no tournament entrance fee for foreigners.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To help those from out of town, the tournament directors have offered to arrange for pickups to and from the airport or train station. They are also willing to help find accommodations for those who will not be staying at the venue. More information can be found by joining the <A HREF="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/edc2004">EDC 2004 Yahoo! group</A> or by e-mailing <A HREF="mailto:sascha@diplomacy-bund.de">Sascha Hingst</A> or <A HREF="mailto:frank@diplomacy-bund.de">Frank Bacher</A>.
