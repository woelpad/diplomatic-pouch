<!--- <P align=justify><I>Draft version 2.4</I></P> --->
<P align=justify>Having recently returned to the hobby, I am eager to make good 
on a long overdue commitment to continue publication of <I>Overheard at the 
Ministry of Finance</I>, a series of articles about the Payola hobby. Payola is 
a variation of Diplomacy with an extra layer inserted between the player and his 
units: Instead of issuing orders, players compete to bribe units of any flag 
during movement phases, with each unit's loyalty going to the highest bidder(s). 
Payola has been written about in this Zine before, and a link to a complete 
list of Payola articles are available in the Payola section of the <A 
href="http://www.floc.net/dpjudge/">DPJudge </A></P>

<P align=justify>Because players are no longer fully in control of their units, 
some of the most promising lines of play in Diplomacy are no longer viable in 
Payola while other possibilities with limited effectiveness in Diplomacy often 
promise good results in Payola. Not surprisingly, the unique flavor and 
relative prospects for each individual powers in Payola differs somewhat from 
the familiar pattern in Diplomacy. Payola is reasonably well balanced and offers 
a broad range of play options. Diplomats often find the variations within the 
familiar Diplomacy setting quite refreshing. </P>

<P align=justify>In this article I'd like to draw comparisons between Payola and 
Diplomacy with respect to three aspect: There are differences affecting play, best play 
alternatives, and the unique characteristics of each power. Views are based on my 
own empirical experience. Certainly there are players who would disagree on 
certain points. I suspect that experienced Payola players would agree on 
most points. </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>Differences Affecting Play</FONT></P>

<P><B><I>No Four Center Laggards</P></B></FONT></I>

<P align=justify>Diplomats are familiar with the fact that some countries 
usually get off to a slow start. Thus, Diplomacy's Turkey, Italy and England are 
typically limited to just a single build after 1901. Most times these powers 
find that their neighbors have already accessed and secured the potential fifth 
center by the Fall. Payola offers these powers new chances. Should any of these power emerge from 
S1901 well funded and with good position, they can enjoy reasonable chances of 
forcing a positive outcome of a fifth center.</P>

<P><B><I>Ruling the Waves - A Dubious Distinction?</P></B></I>

<P align=justify>In Diplomacy, an early issue for England and France or Turkey and Russia is the control of their critical interstitial waterways. If Turkey gains 
control of the Black Sea, for instance, he holds a distinct advantage over 
Russia. Newcomers to Payola often feel elated at their ability to force the 
issue. They can gain naval control simply by outbidding their opponent! However, 
in Payola it is rarely a sound idea to power one's way into the English Channel 
or the Black Sea. The next season will find you at a financial disadvantage, and 
that fickle captain of yours may embarrass you by accepting a higher offer than 
you can make to convoy foreign troops into sensitive home territory. 
Consequently, openings calling for a quick thrust into the Black Sea or the 
English Channel tend play a more limited role between top Payola players. 
Players more often content themselves to spending adequate sums to outfit their 
infantry for a possible crossing (i.e. Army Moscow to Sevastopol, Army Paris to 
Picardy, etc.) as well as setting a modest threshold to inhibit foreign occupation. </P>

<P><B><I>Keep it Simple!</B></I></P>

<P align=justify>Diplomats are familiar with a number of name openings (i.e. Sea 
Lion, Lepanto) which rely on massive use of sea power to make early inroads against 
well fortified adversaries. Such openings play a less prominent role in Payola. 
So early in the game players will lack the financial muscle to reliably execute 
multi-unit maneuvers. The Lepanto, for instance, requires Italy to double hop 
an army into Turkish territory. Turkey can throw a spanner in the works by 
subverting any one of three or four units, and Italy still has to foot the bill 
for the successful parts of the operation. </P>

<P align=justify>While fleets still play a significant role in Payola, they 
usually only become important from the mid-game on. Only at that point will it 
make sense for a successful power to begin building fleets with an eye on 
increasing his offensive mobility. 

<P><B><I>Hidden Strength</B></I></P>

<P align=justify>While the features above mainly affect opening behavior, the 
next characteristics have their biggest effect later in the game.</P>

<P align=justify>In Payola the published picture tells only part of the story. 
Players keep account balances and these balances remain hidden. Players can 
sometimes accumulate large reserves through patient saving, then abruptly expand 
in a 'Great Leap Forward'. It is quite normal for a Payola power to go from 12 
to 18 centers in one brief year, a feat almost unheard of in Diplomacy.</P>

<P align=justify>How does one assay an opponent's financial strength? One could take stock of his military encounters. Unfortunately, moves do not reveal the intensity of engagements, and battles can be feigned to serve diplomatic purposes. A more reliable approach is to involve oneself diplomatically in all conflicts and 
supplement the harvested information with discreet use of financial probes. The 
information gathered on spending behavior also comes in handy in future 
military confrontations. </P>

<P><B><I>Managing Money</B></I></P>

<P align=justify>The presence of money in Payola affects play in other ways as 
well. A player need not confront an opponent militarily. Instead he can chose to resort to 
financial warfare. By encouraging creation of serious threats to an adversary's 
position, he can drain their account balance, weakening him for a fatal blow to 
be administered at the appropriate moment. In contrast to Diplomacy, he can 
pursue this policy in stealth, using third parties to raise challenges, or 
claiming that his own units were victim of third party machinations. </P>

<P align=justify>In Contrast to Diplomacy, Payola players can do rather well by 
doing absolutely nothing, which is a feature that has real appeal to the lazy. If a 
player creates a situation where his unit position appears to make hostile 
penetration difficult, he can take a conscious decision to wait out a season or 
more in order to save.</P>

<P><B><I>A Strategic Endeavor</B></I> 

<P align=justify>Both Diplomacy and Payola call for talent at conducting local 
operations alongside skill at conceiving and implementing a grand plan. 
Payola heightens the importance of strategy, de-emphasizing the role of tactics 
as compared with Diplomacy:</P>

<P align=justify>From the late mid-game onward, an experienced diplomat is 
guided by awareness of stalemate lines. In Payola this aspect of play is 
completely missing. Payola has no stalemate lines; there is no counting the seasons to the 
erection of an impervious barrier. In Diplomacy, superior concentration of 
forces can count as an absolute advantage in a local engagement. In Payola the 
advantage conferred by a preponderance of units is relative and can be neutralized 
by superior spending.</P>

<P align=justify>In Diplomacy it can be useful to talk with all players. In 
Payola, broad communication is absolutely critical. Payola's bidding opens up 
the possibility of action at a distance. Whereas communication with distant powers 
in Diplomacy is mostly limited to supporting a 'look ahead' function, helping to 
ease the transition to pursuit of a new goal after reaching a strategic 
milestone, Payola blurs the notion of neighbors. In a world where everyone can 
and does take influence on your local environment, you are reliant on 
anticipating and manipulate the strategic vision of every other player. </P>

<P><FONT face=Arial size=4>Consequences for Best Play</FONT></P>

<P><B><I>Turkey</P></B></I>

<P align=justify>Turkey has the reputation of being Diplomacy's pre-eminent 
defensive power. Opening play in Diplomacy sees Turkey dealing directly with 
three powers: Austria, Russia and Italy. A competently played Turkey can expect 
at least survival unless two or more of these powers launch a sustained and 
concentrated attack. In contrast, Diplomacy's Turkey has at best average 
offensive capability at the opening. He is usually limited to a single build 
following 1901. Longer term, he faces strategic liabilities: Turkey can face 
difficulty finding an ally. Allying with Russia risks junior partner status while 
allying with Austria or Italy often fails due to trust issues. In the race to 18 
centers Turkey suffers from poor reach. Typically, supply center number 18 is 
far away. If Turkey doesn't give careful attention to global balance, he may 
discover that one of the other powers with better access and perhaps outside the 
range of direct confrontation passes the finish mark before Turkey can enter 
the home stretch. </P>

<P align=justify>In Payola, Turkey is even more of a defensive powerhouse. While 
the “sustained attack from two opponents” rule for eliminating Turkey still 
applies, this time Turkey's initial dealings are limited to Austria and Russia. 
Combine this defensive strength with Turkey's improved chances to garner a 
second build in 1901 and its not surprising to find that Turkey is perhaps the 
most improved power in Payola. </P>

<P align=justify>Turkey's prime objective in the opening should be to counter 
Russia's and Austria's ability to coordinate a joint attack. The obvious 
approach -- to bankroll one of RA against the other -- is perilous and 
unpredictable. If either Russia or Austria succeed too quickly against the 
other, Turkey will be in for a difficult struggle. A better approach for Turkey 
is to use Germany (or, less frequently, England) to keep Russia distracted. 
Turkey can do even better if he manages to get Italy to attack Austria, but for 
reasons which will be familiar from Diplomacy, this course often encounters 
resistance. The ideal opening for Turkey is to make significant inroads 
against either Russia or Austria, while using a third power to neutralize the 
other. </P>

<P align=justify>Turkey has yet one more strategic advantage without any 
equivalent in Diplomacy. If Turkey finds herself “cut off from the action,” he 
can take a conscious decision to wait and save. This option is open to all 
powers in Payola, but because of the Turkey's potential to raise strong outer 
defenses, he is likely to encounter opportunities more frequently early on than, 
say, Austria.</P>

<P align=justify>What about Turkish weaknesses in Payola? It turns out that all 
of Turkey's weaknesses familiar from Diplomacy are present and exacerbated in 
Payola. Turkey's greater natural strength in Payola can make it difficult to 
negotiate an alliance on favorable terms with Russia or Austria. Italy too can 
be counted on to exhibit more than the usual skepticism about mounting an early 
assault against Austrian positions. Attempts by Turkey to finance an Italian 
assault against Trieste will often be recognized as clumsy and transparent 
meddling. Once again, should Turkey try 'too hard' and cover the full cost of 
Italian insurgency deep into the Balkans, he risks creating a powerful future 
adversary.</P>

<P align=justify>The two biggest obstacles to Turkish growth only manifest 
themselves with Turkish success, and they become increasingly onerous if Turkey 
makes continued progress. More than any other power, Turkey is afflicted by 
logistical difficulties. As Turkey grows, he has to maintain ever longer supply 
lines. In Payola, Turkey's opponents have tremendous scope to interrupt 
shipments to the front. All it takes is a single successful bid somewhere along 
the supply chain. The front is weakened and Turkey still carries the cost of 
each of the remaining units.</P>

<P align=justify>Turkey's final problem arises from the same source as his 
defensive strength, which is the high walls and deep moat surrounding his castle. Turkey 
needs to be very aware of the risk of hostile convoys. If an opponent manages to 
infiltrate behind Turkish lines it can be quite costly and time consuming to 
deal with. The loss of time can be especially devastating as the greatest 
obstacle facing Turkey on the road to victory often is time itself.</P>

<P><B><I>Russia</P></B></I>

<P align=justify>Despite his corner position, Payola's Russia has more 
interactions to manage than any other power. Russia has direct dealings with 
Austria, Turkey, England, and Germany. So much is true in Diplomacy as well. But 
because bidding opens up the possibility of exerting “action at a distance,” 
Payola's Russia is often much more an early focus of attention for the distant 
powers as well. France will be eager to instigate Russian action against the 
western powers, while Italy sees Russia, the only easterner not positioned to 
threaten him, as an important balancing power. </P>

<P align=justify>At first glance it looks as though French and Italian activism 
would work in Russia's favor, and many times it does. However, French and 
Italian behavior is not always reliable. Sometimes France or Italy will push 
third party forces in Russia's direction to make room for their own oncoming 
units. Then again, France and Italy's may be satisfied just to distract their 
adversaries and find it more convenient to send third party forces in Russia's 
direction instead of advancing Russian units.</P>

<P align=justify>Not surprisingly, Russia is very susceptible to (and has great 
influence upon) the global alliance structure. <U>Managing the shape and 
strength of alliances everywhere in Europe is Russia's highest priority</U>. One 
tool for implementing this policy, of course, is third party bidding. But Russia 
has too few pieces of silver to cover all the tasks he's facing. Russia has no 
choice but to use third party bidding lightly as a complement to diplomacy and 
actions on the ground. Voluntary enlistment of third parties to the Russian 
cause also has a salutary effect of reinforcing psychological commitment. </P>

<P align=justify>The potential for third parties to instigate movement into 
Silesia, Prussia, and the Baltic greatly heightens the tension between Russia and 
Germany. Perhaps for this reason, RG hostilities tend to break out earlier than 
they do in Diplomacy. Worries about Russia can tilt Germany to seek an alliance 
with England with devastating consequences. A committed EG alliance is the 
purest of all poisons for Russia. If England and Germany stick together, Russia 
might as well enter his name at the nearest game queue. If, on the other hand, 
England and Germany can be made to embark on a costly war, Russia is in an 
excellent position to pick up the pieces. </P>

<P align=justify>In the south, Russia usually has more flexibility. To 
paraphrase Freud, geography is destiny. Both Austria and Italy can work better 
with Russia than with each other. If Italy decides for the east, that can only 
help. Therefore, Russia's top priority at the opening should be to get England 
and Germany fighting. </P>

<P align=justify>Encouraging EG rivalry can be done in a number of ways. Early 
purchase of a hostile action by one party against the other can help to seed 
discontent. Patience is also important: If possible, Russia ought to defer 
aggressive action against England and Germany until EG antagonism is well 
entrenched. Finally, Russia should realize that although an alliance with Turkey 
can be tempting, especially as the Black Sea flash point is much more 
manageable in Payola, it risks encouraging an Anglo-German counter alliance.</P>

<P align=justify>If Germany and England are Russia's bitterest nemeses, then 
it follows that France should be Russia's dearest friend. A lot, of course, 
depends on personality issues. Should a likeminded France emerge as 
Russia's ally in the northwest, it then becomes interesting to consider Italy 
as the Russian partner in the southeast. After sharing gains with Russia in 
their respective theatres, Italy and France are available to curb each others 
growth. Russia obviously has great influence over progress in the two theatres, 
and by opting for asynchronous development, he can avoid creating a static 
triangle where France and Italy are simultaneously able to constrain Russia. 
One promising approach could be for Russia to <U>dis</U>favor progress on the 
front with the more jealous and greedy of his two allies. That way, he creates a 
situation where two allies can later be coaxed into a war to Russia's 
benefit.</P>

<P align=justify>Russia is the Payola quintessential strategic power. Players 
who enjoy the negotiation and strategic aspect of Diplomacy will find Russia 
very versatile and interesting. Russia's relative strength in Payola is quite 
similar to or, perhaps, just slightly greater than it is in Diplomacy.</P>

<P><B><I>Italy</P></B></I>

<P align=justify>Like Turkey, Diplomacy's Italy has a reputation as a defensive 
power with limited offensive potential. Again, like Turkey, Payola's Italy 
remains relatively strong defensively, with improved chances for early growth 
and generally better overall prospects. This improvement is all the more 
surprising as Italy's viable alternatives are even more limited than in 
Diplomacy.</P>

<P align=justify>Italy is usually considered to have three or four viable options for opening play in Diplomacy:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>He can join with Austria in attacking Turkey (i.e. Lepanto). 
  <LI>He can attack Austria. 
  <LI>He can attack Germany. This unconventional option has received attention lately. 
  <LI>He can attack France. </LI>
</OL>

<P align=justify>Under normal circumstances none of the first three options may be advisable in Payola:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Lepanto type openings are inapplicable to Payola for the already cited 
  reasons: Italy isn't equipped this early on to reliably convoy an army into 
  Turkish territory. 
  <LI>Opening attacks against Austria are very risky because of Turkey's 
  enhanced potency. 
  <LI>Early attacks against Germany are unlikely to be sustainable. Italy has 
  only a narrow supply path into and beyond Munich. France and Russia, both with 
  superior access, are well positioned to push Italy out and remain as the 
  beneficiary of an Italian strike north. These remarks apply to anti-German 
  openings for Italy in Diplomacy as well.  </LI>
</OL>

<P align=justify>An attack on France, on the other hand, has an enhanced 
potential for quick results. France is typically pursuing many objectives during 
the first year, leaving Italy much better equipped to concentrate resources on a 
lunge at Marseilles. </P>

<P align=justify>Attacking France is also strategically sound. If Italy is able 
to push through into Iberia, he will have amassed a defensible cluster of 
centers which can deliver revenue to support operations in other theatres. 
What's more, if Russia is amenable to co-operating on the <U>timing</U> of the 
outbreak of dissension between England and Germany, Italy could end up as sole 
beneficiary in the west. Finally, if England runs into difficulties, Italy's 
position in Iberia greatly increase his long term survival chances. It can be 
quite difficult to mount a successful assault against Iberia without western 
naval power. 

<P align=justify>Does this list mean I am advocating only a single sound path to 
opening with Italy? No. There is another Italian opening beyond the well known 
choices from Diplomacy: Italy can play the waiting game. Italy has fairly good 
natural defenses and it is unusual for Italy to come under unprovoked attack 
during the first few years. Should England and Germany evince little interest in 
joining in an early campaign against France, Italy is justified in temporizing: 
He takes Tunis, builds an army to retard entry into the peninsula, and then 
starts saving. Italy can wait for a favorable change in winds in the west while 
keeping alert of any need for action in the east. If Germany and Austria are 
agreeable, Italy can volunteer to enroll his “extra” army for the Austrian cause, thus 
sending it through the alleyway to put pressure on Warsaw or Rumania. This 
assures visibility into operations on the eastern front. Italy wants to avoid 
excessive provocation of Russia though. Russia is not the place for Italy to 
look for sustainable growth early on. Neither will an isolated unit in eastern 
Europe be a source of net income for him. Instead, Italy aims to gain leverage 
and help maintain stability. In case Austria does collapse, an Italian army 
in the east will support Italy's claim to part of the spoils. </P>

<P align=justify>What about Italy's longer term strategy? Italy can take mortal wounds from any of three directions:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>Land attack by Austria 
  <LI>Naval attack by France 
  <LI>Naval attack by Turkey </LI>
</OL>

<P align=justify>Naval attacks, including amphibious assaults, are unlikely 
during the first three years, while an early land attack by Austria is only 
likely as a desperate measure.</P>

<P align=justify>Other powers can make incursions into the peninsula too: Germany 
sometimes finds his way into Venice, for instance. Such occurrences, however,  
are unlikely to be fatal. Italy's strategic interest is then to delay, 
complicate, and undermine the ability and will of these three powers to mount a 
decisive assault. Negotiated decommissioning of shipbuilding facilities in the 
south could help enhance Italy's survival prospects. It is difficult to rid 
the Mediterranean entirely of ships including his own. So Italy's military and 
diplomatic maneuvers should be focused at eventually eliminating the other 
southern powers.</P>

<P align=justify>Besides obviously wanting the help of Germany and England 
against France, Italy has to give special attention to Russia. Italy wants a 
moderately successful yet fickle Russia. A Russian-Turkish alliance might be 
helpful. To the extent that it encourages an Anglo-German counter-alliance, it 
helps advances Italy's agenda against France. On the other hand, Italy needs 
Russia to change sides at the crucial moment before Turkey or Austria gets too 
strong. Russia will also be eager to share spending on operations to undermine 
the strength of EG. With careful timing, Italy can expect to come out with a 
generous share of France and Iberia.</P>

<P align=justify>In the east, Italy ideally wants to preserve a delicate balance 
until he feels confident that any putative gains in Austria and the Balkans 
would be sustainable. Having said that, there are three circumstances in which 
Italy may need to act quickly:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>When dealing with an implacably hostile Austrian player
  <LI>When Austria is already close to collapse (to prevent further easy inroads by Turkey)
  <LI>When Austrian growth reaches alarming proportions </LI>
</OL>

<P><B><I>Austria</P></B></I>

<P align=justify>Concluding the survey of the eastern powers, let's examine 
Austria. In Diplomacy, Austria has the reputation of being a difficult power. As 
Austria sits on top of the richest cluster of centers in Europe, he all too 
often falls victim of the early aggression from his neighbors. Russia, Turkey 
and Italy are all obliged to take an interest in the Balkans. Once having 
committed forces to the area, it is natural for them to seek growth, which often 
comes at Austria's expense.</P>

<P align=justify>Austria's prospects take a turn much to the better if he can 
resist the early deprecations of his neighbors to emerge as a seven or eight center 
power. At this point, the offensive strength of Austria's position manifests itself as 
a potential for explosive growth. Austria can expand into Russia, Turkey, or, 
less propitiously, into Italy.</P>

<P align=justify>Austria's qualitative strengths and weaknesses in Diplomacy 
apply in Payola as well. In the early going, Austria is even more likely to play 
the victim. By pooling their funding, his neighbors can totally subvert the 
behavior of Austrian units. Austria also suffers from his proximity to an 
enhanced Turkey. Not surprisingly, Austria is Payola's most degraded power. </P>

<P align=justify>Austria is very dependent on local alliances. An experienced 
Italy can usually be counted on to keep hands off in the early going. On the 
other hand, more than token Italian engagement in favor of the Austrian cause 
is rarely forthcoming. Austria is very dependent on inhibiting the Juggernaut. 
This is all the more difficult by the lesser role of the Black Sea as a causus 
belli. </P>

<P align=justify>Austria still has some viable options. One is to construct a 
situation where the only possibility for either Turkey or Russia to get a second 
build in 1901 is to attack the other. A sympathetic Italy might be ready to help 
in the first season with Constantinople hold and Smyrna to Armenia. 
Alternatively, Austria can solicit German or English contributions to keep St Petersburg
in dock, while using his own funding to keep Russia out of Galicia.</P>

<P align=justify>Allying with Russia against Turkey may well be Austria's best 
option. If an RA alliance emerges, Austria would like to keep England and 
Germany friendly with each other or at least talking. That buys Austria a 
shield, or cudgel, to use against Russia after Turkey has been sufficiently 
weakened. If, on the other hand, Germany and England are mutually antagonistic, 
Austria can try to steer toward a quick resolution, then work to entangle Russia 
with the victor.</P>

<P align=justify>Allying with Turkey offers fewer palatable alternatives for 
securing Austria's future. Austria might ally with Turkey if no better 
alternative presents itself, but he has to be conscious of the fact that he will 
need to change direction before Turkey selects him as his next victim. </P>

<P align=justify>Another frequently occurring configuration is face to face 
battle between Austria and Turkey, with Russia and Italy busy in other theatres. 
With careful play, Austria can hold his own here. But Russia and Italy will 
always be breathing down Austria's neck, ready to pounce once the sensitive AT 
power balance tilts one way or the other. More generally, a one-on-one 
engagement between Turkey and Austria is only conditionally stable. Unless 
Russia and Italy remain held down elsewhere, they will eventually turn their 
attention to the Balkans. By that time they are likely to have reached some kind 
of resolution on their other fronts, leaving them all the more confident and 
focused and leaving Austria with fewer options. In a straight up Austria 
versus Turkey confrontation, time is an important factor. Time is rarely on 
Austria's side.</P>

<P align=justify>Finally, Austria is very much a tactical power. No discussion 
of Austria would be complete without discussing tactics. Austria is sensitive to 
attacks on multiple flanks, but the real key to his survival lies in the south. 
If a hostile power is able to get an army into Serbia and Greece, Austria's days 
may be numbered. Hostile armies in the south can exert constant pressure against 
Austrian positions, and usually there is no way to push them out of reach.</P>

<P align=justify>Conversely, should Austria get off to a bad start, he should 
give priority to getting land units into Greece and Serbia, even at the cost of 
hastening losses in his home centers. He can survive a long while in Greece and 
Serbia, even while he looks on helplessly as the storm break above him. If 
Austria can wait long enough, help usually arrives. Greece is also a promising 
launching pad for an attack against Turkey. An Austrian army convoyed into his 
hinterland is very distressing for Turkey and the distraction may just give 
Austria the chance he needs to make a recovery.</P>

<P><B><I>England</P></B></I>

<P align=justify>England is known as one of Diplomacy's slow starters. Endowed 
with above average natural defenses, England faces difficulties penetrating 
beyond near lying coastal provinces. Typically England will assume junior 
partner status in an alliance with Germany or France, hoping to turn the tables 
by virtue of his corner position once his partner has to turn afield in search 
of further growth. </P>

<P align=justify>The difficulties facing England are compounded in Payola, and 
new vulnerabilities are added. Whereas most other powers need little more than a 
single move to gather in their first center, England must coordinate two or 
three. The demand for coordination of multiple moves doesn't end there: To do 
more than scratch his opponents' surface, England has to convoy armies onto the 
continent. Convoys can be expensive to make successfully and more expensive if 
they fail.</P>

<P align=justify>England's final problem is the presence of northern fleets. 
There are five of them at the opening and it is an unusual game in which all can 
be gotten rid of. Yet as long as fleets tarry in near lying waters (or unless 
England has exclusive control of the northern European coasts), the English 
homeland remains imperiled. The greatest risk may come from Germany as he 
often occupies multiple provinces on the shores of the North Sea. Should any 
clear and undistracted leader emerge from among his neighbors, England can be 
sure there will be an attempt to board his island fortress. The English homeland is 
coveted as Europe's most profitable cash cow. If the island is indeed boarded by 
a hostile army, England needs to dispatch it quickly and resolutely as delay 
only increases the damage. </P>

<P align=justify>England's early advantages are his relatively isolated location 
and his unsuitability as an initial target, both of which make him attractive as 
a partner. Rarely will France or Germany be strong enough to mount a successful 
operation against England during the first two years. Even joined in union, 
England's neighbors need time to carry out a successful attack, and a skillful 
English player will use that time to summon other powers to attack his 
adversaries' rear. Not surprisingly, Germany and France often chose to confront 
each other before engaging England. Germany may be especially eager to solicit 
England's friendship as England is also an effective counter to Russia. England 
needs to be very leery of Italian overtures to split France three ways. 
It is all to tempting for Italy to later instigate against his two erstwhile 
northern partners in order to increase his payout.</P>


<P align=justify>In case England is offered an opportunity for alliance, he has 
two viable options:</P>

<OL>
  <LI>He can work to maintain the balance between Germany and France, seeking 
  gradual growth against the background of a continuing conflict. 
  <LI>He can side with one neighbor against the other.</LI>
</OL>

<P align=justify>Each approach has advantages and disadvantages. Playing for 
balance risks generating frustration, impatience, and a possible French-German 
rapprochement, whereas if England takes sides he has to remain cognizant of the 
need to deter his partner.</P>

<P align=justify>Finally, England has one other advantage. His two nearest 
neighbors will usually become entangled with third parties (Germany with 
Russia, France with Italy) more violently and at an earlier stage than they do 
in Diplomacy. Still, Payola's England remains a difficult power. He is somewhat 
weakened compared to his status in Diplomacy.</P>

<P><B><I>Germany</P></B></I>

<P align=justify>Open any atlas and take a look at modern Germany (for once I 
mean the nation and not the Diplomacy power). Germany shares land borders with nine 
countries, and is in close proximity to other countries across two sea ways. 
With the exception of Russia, no other country on earth has as many neighbors. 
Russia is protected by his great expanse. In contrast, Germany is vulnerable 
to being overrun by a surprise attack before he can marshal forces of 
resistance. During the period when war was the usual means of resolving disputes 
(in other words, throughout 99+% of recorded history), Germany was forever on 
the edge of being overrun and forever on the edge of overrunning. World leaders, 
from Gustav Adolf to Ronald Reagan considered Germany as <U>The Destination</U> 
when it came to choosing a location for war regardless of whether or not the cause of the 
dispute had anything to do with Germany. Given this background, is it any 
surprise that Germans have the reputation of being anxious, intense and obsessed 
with security? Allan Calhammer did a fine job embodying these characteristics in 
Germany when he designed Diplomacy. </P>

<P align=justify>Germany's unique strength is his mobility. His unique weakness 
is his vulnerability. In order to exploit her mobility Germany needs control of 
Munich. In order to safeguard his homeland and further enhance his mobility, he 
needs control of Belgium.</P>

<P align=justify>A well developed network of internal transport links allow 
Germany to shift forces at lightning speed between fronts, either to address new 
threats, or to respond to emerging targets of opportunity with the famous 
Blitzkrieg. Germany's mobility endows him with superior access, assuring 
opportunities for rapid growth, along with superior accessibility, assuring 
vulnerability to rapid elimination. </P>

<P align=justify>Munich is the sine qua non of German mobility. Frequently, 
Munich will be besieged from various directions, making its defense costly and 
uncertain. There will be times when Germany may decide to leave Munich 
undefended to contain costs. However, Germany needs to feel that he can take Munich 
back if it becomes necessary. So long as Munich is withheld, Germany finds it 
difficult to transport troops between fronts, as is the case for the Germany in 
the figure below (taken from a current game) who, despite doing rather well at 9 
centers, is badly out of position to counter forces drawing together on his 
eastern front.</P>

<P></P>

<P align=justify>The other key enabler of Germany's natural strength is Belgium. 
Whereas Diplomacy's Germany can enjoy harmonious relations with a foreign 
occupant of Belgium, the situation in Payola is more volatile. A foreign army 
in Belgium will be a constant magnet for third parties wanting to distract 
Germany, and there will be no accountability. Holding Belgium also doubles the 
German cross section for access into France. </P>

<P align=justify>Control of Belgium is a contentious issue in Payola no less 
than in Diplomacy. Rarely will Germany be able to impose his will against the 
determined opposition of France and England. Luckily Payola provides more and 
more finely graduated diplomatic options. Germany can, for instance, offer to 
cooperate to get England into Sweden and/or offer France silver for 
demilitarization of Burgundy and Picardy together with acquiescence on 
Belgium.</P>

<P align=justify>It is not unusual for Germany to be overwhelmed by the scope of 
tasks facing him in the first year. Often it is Munich who embarrasses him in 
the Spring 1901, as Germany is likely to favor Berlin and Kiel in the race 
to reach his two “naturals”, Denmark and Holland. If the German fleet is in 
Denmark in the Spring, Russia might compete to control it in the Fall, so as to 
assure a clear path to Sweden. Chances are Russia will favor Den -&gt; Hel 
compared with Denmark hold, especially if he interprets Germany's Springtime 
move to Denmark as a provocation. Even if Germany does have sights on Sweden, 
he might wish to consider the precaution of including a lower bid on Denmark 
Hold, as this might “catch” a similar secondary or lower bid from Russia or 
another player.</P>

<P align=justify>Generally it is a good idea for Germany to avoid the temptation 
of allocating more than a token amount to foreign interference until he has can 
gain a clearer view of friend and foe. Beside running the risk of depriving his 
own units, the problem Germany faces with first year foreign bidding is dilution 
by the large number of targets. A case can be made for launching an initial 
attack against France since France will become much harder to attack once he 
manages to pull in his first two neutrals. Germany should understand that 
the attempt is very precarious. In general, it is true that France is 
rarely a good choice for Germany to ally with. Unless Germany can be confident 
of Italy's future strength and loyalty, he risks a future two front war against 
an undistracted France with only the remotest expectation of an auspicious 
outcome. </P>

<P align=justify>Payola's Germany tends to outperform his Diplomacy counterpart, 
benefiting no doubt from the weakening of England and the early weakness of 
France. I have already pointed out that Germany and Russia tend to get entangled 
earlier in Payola. Here I will add that Germany and Russia are quite evenly 
matched in these encounters. Finally, I'll close out my discussion of the best play for 
Payola's Germany with a quote from the first issue of “Overheard at the Ministry 
of Finance”:</P>

<P align=justify><I>“Germany's growth path is to widely distribute his units, 
collect up-to-date information about the cost of operations in each region, and 
use his superior mobility to quickly redirect his units as appropriate. He might 
fully neglect .. less interesting theatres.. Germany will accept the frequent 
loss of SC's. By abandoning resources that have become too expensive, he is 
better able to concentrate on acquisition of cheaper resources readily at hand.” 
</I></P>

<P><B><I>France</P></B></I>

<P align=justify>Diplomacy's France is a very popular and versatile power with 
above average offensive and defensive qualities. Payola's France remains a 
strong contender. Although somewhat weakened at the outset of the game by the greater likelihood 
of early assaults being launched from Germany or Italy, he 
demonstrates superior potential if he can persevere beyond these early 
difficulties.</P>

<P align=justify>The key to a good start for France is to get Italy going east. 
By succeeding in this single objective, France buys time to work things out no 
matter how things start with England and Germany. As with the other western 
powers, French finances are pressed in year one. France's best approach to 
dealing with Italy, therefore, is to reach for the pen. Austria and Italy are 
always a bit uneasy about each other at the outset. Often they will greet a 
French initiative to commit them to some joint cause. Typically this will begin 
with horror stories about the Payola Juggernaut and admiration for the stubborn 
resistance of a strong IA alliance. The key will be to win acceptance for 
<U>active</U> Italian involvement, e.g. convincing Austria to sanction passage 
of an Italian army through the corridor to Galicia. Counterintuitively, Frances 
initial difficulties may be <U>increased</U> if Italy fails to launch for Tunis. 
The bid reverts to Italy's account and, assuming that Italy reached Piedmont, 
all his funds will go toward taking Marseilles.</P>

<P align=justify>If France can succeed in stabilizing his position defensively, 
a wide variety of options will open. France is in a superior position to 
intersperse years of growth with years of saving. I generally recommend a 
“Germany first” strategy, in line with my disinclination against early 
construction of the fleets needed to mount an assault on England or Italy. An 
exception occurs if England offers a transport opportunity with a fleet in the 
English Channel. It is a wise precaution for France to keep an army posted on 
the north coast ready to take advantage of such targets of opportunity. If 
France can manage to neutralize Italy <U>and</U> England, he becomes very 
powerful indeed. A France undistracted by naval forces is the single most 
frightening force in Payola.</P>

<P align=justify>Ideally, France wants England occupied in Scandinavia and 
Russia and not competing for a share of Germany. France then instigates hostilities 
between Germany and Russia, either pulling Russian forces toward the German 
border or, if Russia is strong enough to defend herself, pushing German armies 
eastward. Once hostilities between France and Germany break out, France usually 
finds it cheaper to control German units <U>behind the lines</U>. By driving 
German units east, France creates a temptation for Germany to spend on actions 
against Russian centers, thus emptying the German treasury. France's two strategic 
objective in the battle against Germany are: </P>

<OL>
  <LI>To force key German disbands, thus undermining effective German resistance 
  <LI>To impair Russia's ability to contest ultimate control of the German centers </LI></OL>
<P align=justify>If France succeeds in devouring Germany, his next decision will 
be whether to turn north against England or to face Italy. A lot depends on the 
overall alliance structure and the affinity for and pliability of individual 
players. All things being equal, I prefer the northern route. A direct 
assault against England is time consuming, but it furnishes France with three 
easily defendable revenue generators. Scandinavia, which will be next to fall, 
usually offers France his easiest path to the Russian heartland. Finally, my 
preference is to make my offence a faithful servant to my defense. As England 
represents a more potent mid-game challenge to France than does Italy, England 
is more deserving of France's attention.</P>

and strength of each Payola power as compared with their Diplomacy
