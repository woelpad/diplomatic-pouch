<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There has been a traditional argument back and forth between North America and Europe on the issue of scoring systems. Much of it revolves around the perception that most North American tournaments are Draw Based systems where as the Europeans (outside of UK) are center lead oriented (C-Diplo) systems. 

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The following is a summary of the North American systems which seems to establish that there is no uniform anything or consistency in methodology or administration throughout the continent. 

<H4>Definitions:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All scoring systems have a "win" rated better than any other result, but what happens in a game that is not won?  This is the issue....

<BLOCKQUOTE>
	<P><I>A Draw Based system</I> is one in which the following is true:
		<DD>2 Way draws are better than 3 way which is better than 4 way and so forth.<DD>Supply center count is secondary and does not disturb the above concept.

	<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>A Place system</I> is one where having one more center than the next person is the key Typical of the European C-Diplo where the first three finishes regardless of the number of centers will always be better than any other center count result possible.

	<P><I>A Center Count system</I> uses only the centers as the basis.

	<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>A Country system</I> uses the best results of each country played on supply center count to advance to the next round to create a top board where the most centers win in a time limit game.

	<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>An Elimination system</I> is one where points are scored be eliminating a position which is very different than a draw system since in some cases such as WBC a 6 way draw means nothing.

	<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>A Lead system</I> is one where the relative center count of the leader vs the next or the relative value between all the center counts of the players is taken in account is a matter.

	<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>A Kill system</I> is one where there is a bonus for killing positions.

	<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>A Subjective system</I> is where the players are pre-assigned to competitive rankings and the determination of a winner is a subject of discussion rather than strict measures. This was actually the scoring system used in the first 3 DipCons that had scoring systems.

<H3>Other features in North America tournaments:</H3>

<H4>Voting:</H4>

<P>Three North American tournaments have no voting <!-- at all --> other than to just end the game as is: &nbsp;&nbsp;Conquest, GenCon, and KublaCon.  Four or five other tournaments have voting systems that have votes based on centers owned and allow for minor powers to be voted out of a draw or game conclusion: Origins, Tempest, WBC, Prez Con, and Carnage.  Conversely, one event has a vote system where you cannot vote yourself out of a draw or game conclusion: ARMADA.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Open balloting (show of hands) has been used as well as secret voting. Though the trend seems to be in favor of secret voting, there are changes back and forth. 


<H4>Concessions:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Several Cons have limits on the minimum number of centers needed to receive a concession vote: WBC (15) and Origins (13). Due to being center count influenced victory by concession is worth LESS to the winner in systems such as DixieCon; as well as substantially more valuable to the non winning players such as in GenCon.

<H4>Time Limits:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>No Limits</I>:  Four systems (DixieCon, Origins, Tempest and WBC) use no time limits on rounds other than the last round.  Origins is unique in that all rounds are Night rounds starting at 6PM.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Central vs Board Time</I>:  Central Time, where all games go at the same time is used consistently at ARMADA, PiggyBack and Dragonflight; it is being introduced at Boston Massacre.  Most other systems allow each board to handle their own time.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Short time</I>:  Shortest time for a round is 4 hours at GenCon.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><I>Drop Dead vs Split Time</I>:  Drop Dead is a system in which the clock runs continuously with negotiations, order writing and adjudication all combined to make one limit and failure to get orders in at the time of the bell is a disaster. Split Time is when there is a separate time for negotiations and then order writing and then adjudication. Drop Dead is used at three: ARMADA, Dragonflight and PiggyBack and is becoming experimented with elsewhere inconsistently.  ARMADA has recently introduced the idea of a single use ‘Grace Time’ where a player can call for 60 seconds once a game to complete his orders. 

<H4>Posting Results:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interim results/rankings are publicly posted at Dragonflight and Conquest (Irregular).

<H4>Top Boards:</H4>

Top Boards are where there is a special board of leaders on the final day from which the leader of the tournament will come from. This is used in: GenCon, PiggyBack, and Victoria (prior to 2003).

<H4>Seeding:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seeding of the players initially in the first round is done at Conquest, Dragonflight, KublaCon. Dragonflight uses a ‘Swiss Pairing’ of the first round from NADF scores. In subsequent rounds at Conquest and KublaCon the game boards will be seeded by novice and experienced players if there is enough raw newbies to be isolated on their own board. At Dragonflight after the first round there is complex seeding method using a break into two scoring groups, then three, then four. Scores, by rating order, the middle of each group unassigned in that group is moved toward the middle. It is available from Buz Eddy on request.

<H4>Newbie Treatment:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conquest and KublaCon have 5 tournament points bonus assigned to all newbies who attend the mentor round and then go on to play in the tournament. Further all newbies are identified and are allowed to make one mistake of every type in each game and be forgiven/corrected. It is therefore that during order reading all the newbies are read first to cut down on ‘contamination’ of meanings by prior results.

<H4>Country Assignments:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Country assignments are not initially random at two: Conquest and Kubla Con where newbies are given France/Turkey if two present and if three present then France, England and Germany in their first game.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In two cons, the board is divided into an East-Center and West region and a player plays one country in each region in each of the first three rounds and not the same country twice: PiggyBack and ARMADA

<P>In ten you are not suppose to play the same country twice: ARMADA, Conquest, DixieCon, Dragonflight, KublaCon, Origins, PiggyBack, Tempest, WBC, and Carnage.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There was some experiment in the East West divide so that players would always play at least one round in the East ( I-A-R-T) and one in the West (E-F-G) but the administrative support for that is mostly computer oriented and those people have graduated to the East-Central-West system.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dragonflight uses a ‘Wheeled sequence’ system: - normal progression: E-I-R-T-G-F-A.  If two or more players are up for the same country its usual to skip two forward (T&G consider one for this). Other adjustments as needed to minimize playing the same country twice. 

<H4>Less Than Seven:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In two events there can be games with less than seven players counted: Conquest and KublaCon.  In some there is a formalized method where local players are knocked out to make the 7 player boards: DixieCon and Victoria.  There has been experimentation with players playing double positions but nothing has reached a formal entry into anyone’s house rules on the issue. 

<H4>Order Writing Formalities:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is a great deal of diverse approaches to badly written orders from very strict to very forgiving. Two have a formalized guideline that specifies that all newbies are allowed one of every type of mistake per game while veterans are given no mercy:  Conquest and KublaCon 

<H4>Number of Rounds:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Smallest number of rounds is 3 and largest is 6 (GenCon) so far. 

<H4>Rounds that Count:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Conquest, KublaCon and Origins count best two out of three rounds. ARMADA counts best three out of four rounds while GenCon has four preliminary rounds then, one intermediate and one final round.

<H4>What is in a Draw?</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">WBC does not recognize 6 and 7 way draws. Calgary is similar but does not allow 5-6-7 way draws.  Conquest and KublaCon have no Draw concept at all.

<H4>Known vs Unknown Systems:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Origins (and sometimes PrezCon) operate on an unknown detailed scoring system that is described in vague terms by the TD (see below) designed to avoid players trying to pin point their scores in the course of play.

<H4>Tie Breakers:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dragonflight has a hidden tie breaker that is vaguely related at times to the countries actually played.  Conversely, Conquest and KublaCon decide ties on the player that travels further or in favor of newcomers (varies from year to year).  ARMADA uses a count back system related to centers. 

<H4>Value of a Win:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There is no consistent agreement on the value of a win versus a combination of other results. In Dixie Con two 3 ways each with 11 centers are worth more than a18 center win and an elimination. In Aramada, two -three ways are better than a win and an elimination, in Dragonflight a win is better than two 2 ways or three 3 ways. In WBC a win is worth four - 3 ways, in Tempest a win can be worth more than three -3 ways if there is a survivor not taking part in the draw. 

<H4>Value of Second place:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Seems that in a game that is won by someone else compared to results of a 4 way or more draw that in both GenCon and DixieCon the second place player can come out ahead so that at both it is in your interest NOT to stop a win if you have a large center count and there are a lot of players surviving. 

<H4>Team Rounds:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Very few of the tournaments have a team round. Typically: ARMADA, Dixiecon and WBC. The sizes of the teams have varied from 3 to 7. WBC has a unique tradition in that during the Team Round cross game alliances are allowed and it is not uncommon to see a Team Captain come over to tell a team mate to attack some other team on his board because of something elsewhere going on. 

<H4>Variant Side Shows:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Variants are played outside of the tournament. Classic Gunboat is popular at WBC, Boom Gunboat (game ends in Fall 01 with nuclear weapons = black hole makers) is popular as a midnight game at Dragonflight. Conquest and KublaCon always have Escalation games going on. Colonial use to be played at WBC but has faded out.

						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you survive to 1905 then you get a point (whether you're eliminated later or not).
						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are in the draw at the end of the game then you get a point.  You get a point for every supply center you own.
						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are in the outright lead then you get a bonus of the difference between you and the next best player.
						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you are first on the board you get 4 bonus points, if you are second you get 3 bonus points, if you are third you get 2 bonus points, if you're fourth you get 1 bonus point. (If there's a tie you get the points for the lower position -ie equal 2nd both get 2 bonus points.)
						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">You add each person's points to get a raw score. The next step is to standardize the game. Divide each person's raw score with the sum of all the raw scores and then multiply by 100. This generates a percentage for everyone. So an entire game is worth 100 points and how much of those points that each person gets is determined points 1-5.
						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you solo you get 110 points and everyone else gets *nothing*.

						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For <!-- mostly --> tie breaking purposes there is a decimal computation composed of the strength of the countries played using the NADF results for all countries (more for Italy and less for England) as well as the value of the opposition on the board using again the NADF scores of the players. The total of these point is limited to .24 so that over four rounds the maximum impact is .96 of a point.

						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Draws work the same way. A 4-way scores as 270+70+50+34 = 424/4 = 106 points each plus centers. For a 17-10-4-3 draw, this would be 174-146 - 122-118.
						<P>Examples in a scores:
						<DL><DT>
							<DD>Win with 18 centers = 342
							<DD>Second place with 16 centers = 134
							<DD>Three way with 1 center = 134
							<DD>Four way with 7 centers = 134
							<DD>Five way with 11 centers = 132.8

						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two preliminary rounds with the best 2 center count for each country going to an Intermediate round. The best for each country is then placed in a top board again based on supply center count. The winner is the player on the top board that has the most centers. Games are typically played in 4 hour convention blocks with fixed endings in real time, but each board goes at its own pace. No votes, no draws, if countries are eliminated the last elimination goes to the next round.

						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Origins is a combo of Draw and Lead. There is no time limit, rounds are Thursday, Friday, Saturday evenings 6 PM. Voting is secret. 30 centers can pass a draw vote; a concession must be unanimous to the largest power of at least 13 centers. Results of earlier rounds are not posted. There is no top board or seeding. Country assignment is random, with each country played only once by a player during the tournament. Best 2 out of 3 rounds count for scoring.
						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Scoring recognizes results, centers, longevity, and a comparison of size relative to the other players. This is intended to encourage players to 'stick it out' in order to get a few more points, rather than just giving up. It also encourages players to kill, in order to get more dots for themselves for points and size comparisons. It discourages giving 'gifts' to other players because you are penalized in less dots and smaller size. Overall, I think it encourages all players to play their very best until they are either killed or have a victory. I think it also helps minimize cross-board and cross-round playing, a little.
						<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very difficult to know exactly how many centers you need to get a best country, for example, unless you know what the dot count for each year was, on every other board. And with no time limit, players can play the game more like it was designed. Play your best, and the scoring system will reflect it.

						<P>SCORING:
						<OL>
							<LI>Supply Center Points: Each player receives one point for each supply center owned when the game ends. A solo win via concession will receive credit for 18 centers although the player may have as few as 15 centers (see section #5 below).</LI>
							<LI>Bonus Points: Each player will receive bonus points based on his participation in a win or draw, as follows:
							<DD>Win - 46 Points
							<DD>2-way Draw - 22 Points
							<DD>3-way Draw - 10 Points
							<DD>4-way Draw - 4 Points
							<DD>5-way Draw - l Point
							<DD>6 or 7-way draws- Zero 
							<LI>Tie Breaker: In the case of a tie, we will calculate the involved players' average number of supply centers per game year. The player with the highest average wins the tie.</LI>
							<LI>Game Ending Negotiations - Draws include all survivors. Players may vote themselves out of a draw if they wish.</LI>
							<LI>Concessions: - A game may be conceded only to the player with the most supply centers on the board - 15 centers minimum. A concession vote must be unanimous of all active players (positions in CD are not considered active).</LI>
							<LI>Victory Criteria: We will be using a victory criteria of 18 supply centers at the end of the Fall adjustment phase. Or players may vote an unanimous concession per section #5 above.</LI>
							<LI>Reporting of Results: The Tournament Director will not comment on nor make public the results of each game and round until the awards are given out at the end of the Tournament. It is common and unpreventable for players to disseminate information, both true and false, on game results. Off board manipulation is traditionally part of the BPA experience.</LI>
