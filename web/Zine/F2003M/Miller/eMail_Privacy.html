<H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Problem:</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Have you ever wondered how secure all the email
messages that are being sent to/from the judges in the course of
your games that you play? Probably not, as I myself did up until
recently, but maybe that is not the best approach to take.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>For those who don't know, email is inherently a
very insecure transmission method. It is analogous to using a
postcard to send messages: anyone along the way can read your
message, alter it or even submit a completely fake message, and
you and/or the destinary would never know it.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>OK, for some sensitive information (bank
transactions, credit clearances etc.) this might be an issue but
for Diplomacy games? Well, just consider these possible scenarios
(in increasing order of likelihood):
</P>
<OL>
<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Someone 'spoofs' you by sending an email
purporting to be from the real judge. OK, you might spot this
from the headers that would indicate the phony source, but then
again you quite likely would not (not all email clients easily
show message headers, and you may not know what to look for).
</P>
<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Someone intercepts an email from the judge
and alters it (changing a press message for example). You have
no way of knowing that it was altered, let alone where.
</P>
<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Someone fakes you and sends an email
purporting to be you, so that the judge accepts new orders,
different to those that you think were going to be processed.
</P>
</OL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Not all of these possibilities are academic. I
unfortunately know first-hand of a colleague I introduced to the
email hobby who used his computer knowledge, plus the fact an
unfortunate player sent their password by mistake, to generate
false message purporting to come from the judge and to submit new
orders to the judge.
</P>
<H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The Solution:</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>How could this be avoided? Well, there exists a
program called <A HREF="http://www.pgp.com/">PGP</A>, and its
free counterpart <A HREF="http://www.gnupg.org/">GnuPG</A>, that
can secure emails so that these tricks become impossible. Most
email clients support these programs, that tack on some extra
information to the email.  <A HREF="http://www.pgpi.org/doc/pgpintro/">How
does PGP work?</A> Well, in simple terms, a unique key pair is
generated: one public, the other private. Anyone can use the
public key (in fact, they are often made available on public key
servers) but the private key is only held by the person who
created the key pair.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>With these key pairs, essentially the following
two features are provided:
</P>
<H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0cm">
Digital Signature</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="text-align: justify">With this, a message is
digitally signed by the originator with their private key. Anyone
receiving this message can compare it with the corresponding
public key, which will match if correct. Additionally, checks are
performed that inform if the message is not the original copy
(i.e. it was altered during transmission). If you know who holds
the private key, then you can be certain that that message
originated from them.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY STYLE="margin-left: 1cm; margin-right: 1cm; margin-top: 0cm">
Digital Encryption</H4>
<BLOCKQUOTE STYLE="text-align: justify">If you want to send a
secure message, unreadable by all except the intended destinary,
then you use encryption. Anyone can encrypt a message for a
destination by using its corresponding public key, but only the
person in possession of the matching private key can decode and
read the message. Encryption strength is usually sufficient that
the encoding is unbreakable in practical terms, so message
security is assured.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>How could this be used on the judge? For
example, by adding a digital signature to all emails coming from
the judge, you could be certain that is was the judge that sent
it to you, and not someone else pretending to be it. Similarly,
you could send your emails to the judge also digitally signed, so
the judge can be sure your message was not altered mid-flow.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In addition, if you know the judge's public key
and it knows yours, both of you can be certain who is really
sending, and messages could be rejected if the keys do not match.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>To get even more secure, the emails between the
judge and player could be encrypted so that not even their
content could be read by third-parties.
</P>
<H4 ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Identity Registration</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>One of the banes of judge play is the use of
multiple identities, whereby the same person uses separate email
addresses to play multiple positions.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>To avoid this problem, use could be made of key
signing. This is a procedure whereby a key itself is digitally
signed by another key. This is used to validate the identity of
the key signed, as the signer is agreeing that the person really
exists. If enough people sign each others keys, then eventually a
network of signatures is established that will lead from one
person to any other (a so called Web of Trust).
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In judge terms, every player could be required
to have a valid key that was signed by real people. Only players
signing/encrypting messages with these keys would be permitted to
play on the judge.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>In that way, you would be certain that each
player in a game is a separate person, and no more would multiple
positions be playable unknown by the same player.
</P>
<H4>When can this be implemented?
</H4>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>The framework for this already exists. There
already exist <A HREF="http://www.pgp.net/">public key servers</A>,
and various <A HREF="http://www.rubin.ch/pgp/weboftrust">Web of
Trust</A> schemes to certify the identity of people (e.g. for
<A HREF="http://www.debian.org/devel/extract_key">Debian
Developers</A>). All that is required is to bolt this on to the
existing judge system.
</P>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Currently, I have established a judge, <A HREF="mailto:uksj@faztek.org">UKSJ</A>
that is the first step in this. It is set up to send all emails
digitally signed (using the <A HREF="http://www.cleancode.org/email">email</A>
program) thus guaranteeing that the judge is really sending them.
Time is always limited for me, but the next steps that I see are:
</P>
<UL>
<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Added ability to receive digitally signed
messages from players, rejecting those with signing errors
(indicating tampering).
</P>
<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Allow players to encrypt messages to the
judge (using the judge's public key).
</P>
<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Allow players to register their public keys
(either with the judge directly or a specially created dedicated
key server).
</P>
<LI><P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Use player-registered public keys to
digitally sign/encrypt messages from the judge to each player.
</P>
</UL>
<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>Not everyone will want to go to such lengths to
play on a secure judge like this. Sending from other email
accounts, or using the common Webmail services (such as Yahoo and
Hotmail) will not work with PGP/GnuPG, and the Microsoft Outlook
Express email client actually refuses to read such messages. But,
if you want to be certain that your game is free of cheating,
this may be the best way to go.
