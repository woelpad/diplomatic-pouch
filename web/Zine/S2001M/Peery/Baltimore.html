<H1 align=center>The Tenth World Diplomacy Championship</H1>
<H2 align=center>The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly</H2>
<H3 align=center><i>by Larry Peery</i></H3>

<P>    OK, so it wasn't a perfect WDC. Who but me would notice anyway?  And
who but me would dare say so? In public. In print. Well, now that Robert
Sacks is done, I'll just have to carry on...

    <P>For the record, I should note that my comments are based on my
comparisons of this event with the various  other WDC events (I, II, IV,
VI, VII, VIII, IX) and the previous Avalon Con event I attended; which
was hosted at this venue by the same group.  In rating a WDC event I use
a 5 star system. Each item begins with 5 stars. I only subtract stars
for specific reasons.


<P><h3>THE GOOD</h3>

<P>First, for a puff piece on this year's WDC event check out the
official report at: <a href=http://www.boardgamers.org/yearbook/dippge.htm>http://www.boardgamers.org/yearbook/dippge.htm</a>

<P>Second, in spite of it's reputation as the "drug capital of
America," Baltimore is a lovely city.  The BWI airport is a joy to use,
at least in comparison to most major airports in the USA.  Hunt Valley
has obviously prospered since I was last there. At that time the local
shopping center sat, mostly empty.  This time the stores were full, even
if the parking lot wasn't.
<P>***** Host City.

<P>Third, I only had one complaint on my last visit, the entire event
site (The Marriott Hunt Valley Resort) smelled of garlic and pizza
toppings!  That may not be bad on a Saturday night, but on a Sunday
morning it's disgusting!  Obviously, the hotel noticed as well, and the
Pizza Hut smells stayed within the confines of the Pizza Hut (which,
according to the hotel F&B Manager did a record business in pizzas
during the WDC weekend). The hotel dining room was very good. The other
cookie cutter hotels, the Marriott Suites and the Hampton Inn, were up
to standard. The local supermarket, travel agency and Chinese restaurant
were OK.  The local liquor store conned me into paying $45 for a
half-bottle of locally produced dessert wine that was, at best,
marginal.
<P>***** Venue.

<P>Fourth, some big changes in the host event, but nobody mentioned
them; whether out of respect for the dead or embarassment I'm not sure.
Avalon Hill; the founder of this event; is dead (or in a catatonic
state); and Diplomacy in the USA is now controlled by Hasbro (which
isn't in much better shape than Avalon Hill was).  Anyway, the parent
event, under the general direction of Don Greenwood, has survived
without Avalon Hill's support.  Boardgaming is alive and well!
And the Diplomacy event, under the direction of Jim Yerkey, continues
on.  I heard a few complaints about the usual things (Why isn't the
registration desk open NOW????), but all in all they seemed to do a good
job.
<P>*****Host Event.

<P>Fifth, I don't agree with Jim's body count, but who ever does?  I
use a slightly stricted standard. He counted 141 players in 58 games.  I
look at the number of players who played enough to be eligible for a
prize, etc.; which was 93. I also look at the difference in the number
of boards in each round, and it was down considerably by the end of the
event, perhaps by a quarter or third.  Ironically, my system gives the
event a better rating than his would.  Eighteen overseas players out of
93 is a lot better than 18 out of 141.  My chief complaint was the
mechanics of the way the gaming events were handled.
Using three by five inch cards to keep records, standing on top of
tables to shout out table assignments, etc. is just not acceptable at a
WDC event.  It took over an hour to get the first round going. There
were some major snafus in making table assignments for the third round
(When 3 or 4 players from the same board in round 2 ended up on the same
board in round 3 there was something wrong; and I didn't appreciate
being yelled at when I pointed it out.). There was an on-going problem
with having too many or not enough players which caused frustrating
delays.  My over-all impression was that the tournament director wasn't
prepared to deal with this many players.
<P>**Diplomacy Event Particulars.

<P>Sixth, a pleasant surprise. For the first time in a long time, an
event report was done and published promptly.
<P>*****Post Event Report.


<P><h3>THE BAD</h3>

<P>First, see Fifth above.

<P>Second, I was not satisfied with the way the pre-event promotion or
publicity was handled by those responsible for the event.  It was almost
impossible to get information out of Jim. Most of what did come out came
from Dan Mathias, and even he didn't always have answers to questions.
Most of the work was done by Edi Birsan who, if my memory serves, wasn't
even on the event committee.  That's not a criticism of Edi.  If you
want all the sorted details, send me a floppy and I'll send you a copy
of the few hundred emails I have saved pertaining to this. :-)
<P>*Pre-event Promotion

<P>Third, although nobody pays much attention to it unless it suits
their needs, we do have a charter.  LOL.... Well, at least we have a WDC
Administration Committee that is supposed to be in charge of the event.
Need I say more?
<P>*Event Administration


<P><h3>THE UGLY</h3>

<P>This year's WDC Society meeting was almost, but not quite, as bad as
the one in Birmingham at WDC IV. Edi Birsan and others spent a huge
amount of effort preparing a proposal for a WDC charter, etc., only to
see it torn to shreds by a bunch of drunken barbarians.  I'm sorry, but
a big brut, standing on a chair, waving a beer bottle and shouting at
the top of his lungs doesn't impress me.  Neither did his arguments. By
the end of the meeting you could sense that those present were desperate
to find a way to redeem themselves.  Referring the proposed document on
to Paris for final approval may do that.  Hopefully, cooler and calmer
heads in Paris will prevail and something lasting will be accomplished
there.
<P>*Organizational Meeting

<P><h3>CONCLUSION</h3>

<P>WDC X demonstrated four things: 
<br>1) The North American Diplomacy
hobby could host a large-scale Diplomacy event; 
<br>2) That event could
attract participants from overseas, or at least foreigners domiciled in
the USA; 
<br>3) Foreign players playing in America do better than American
players playing overseas. This last is important because it validates an
underlying principle of the WDC concept, viz. Diplomacy is a worldwide
game and hobby; something that cannot be said of America's other
National Pastime, baseball. 
<br>4) Diplomacy players do not make good team
players.
