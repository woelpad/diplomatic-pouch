<H1 align=center>Robert Sacks</H1>
<H3 align=center><i>by Larry Peery</i></H3>

<HR>


<P>In a hobby filled with interesting or exotic characters, Robert
   Sacks was unique.  He was both.
<P>In a hobby filled with loud talkers or hard workers, Robert Sacks
   was unique. He was both.
<P>In a hobby filled with mortals who think they are immortal, Robert
   Sacks is unique. He is immortal.
<P>As long as there is a Diplomacy hobby, there will be stories told
   about Robert Sacks.  In time those stories will become legends, because
   Robert was the kind of person who inspired legends. With the legends
   come immortality.

<P>I knew and worked with Robert for over a third of a century. During
   that time we were friends and enemies, partners and adversaries,
   proponents and opponents; but always sharing the same goal --- making
   the Diplomacy hobby a better place for all.   There was hardly a hobby
   project, publication or activity that Robert didn't have an opinion
   about; and he never hesitated to let people know what they were.
   Sometimes he was in the mainstream. Sometimes he wasn't. It never
   mattered to him, he always said and did what he thought was in the best
   interests of the hobby.

<P>Ironically, I suppose, I never had a chance to actually sit down and
   play a game of Diplomacy with him. We were always too busy for that:
   writing, editing, publishing, organizing, running events, chairing
   meetings, etc.  I do recall at one of the early Avalon Con events at
   Hunt Valley we did have a chance to play an absolutely horrible
   boardgame called Fast Food Franchises.  Across the board I discovered
   another side of Robert: his sense of humor, his wit, and his
   intelligence in a social environment.

<P>I last saw him at last year's WDC event, also at Hunt Valley, where
   he was, once again, busy at work on some gaming event.  We only had a
   few minutes to chat, but he still had time to let people know how he
   felt about the Diplomacy hobby and the WDC event. Who would have known
   then, listening to him expound on his ideas, that in a few weeks he
   would be dead?

<P>But even in death, Robert has not been forgotten. Don Greenwood
   recently announced that Robert had posthumously won the BPA Sportsman of
   the Year award, selected by his peers from among a field of 50 nominees,
   for his longtime work as a BPA volunteer.  A fitting tribute to one who
   gave so much.

<P>I have lost a colleague and a fellow hobbyist, but the hobby has
   gained a legend.  It's the kind of trade Robert would have appreciated.

<P>
