Below are two articles about my variant for the next issue of the DP zine.<BR>
The first one is a general introduction of the variant. The second one is<BR>
about strategy for the variant. I make mention of the notion that the<BR>
variant can be played on the DPjudge - so I do hope that's true by now or<BR>
will be by the time these articles are published. Please let me know when<BR>
that happens so I can update my web site and make announcements etc.<BR>
<BR>
Thanks<BR>

Introducing "The Ancient Mediterranean" a five-player Diplomacy variant<BR>
based on the empires that dominated the Mediterranean area during ancient<BR>
history. The powers are Rome, Carthage, Greece, Egypt and Persia. This<BR>
variant has some similarities to the variant "Classical" but one look at the<BR>
map will tell you that it will play much differently. The Ancient Med is a<BR>
design of my own creation which I have been working on for over three years.<BR>
But still it is a relatively new variant to the Diplomacy community. I first<BR>
made it available on the web in May 2000 and it has had some signifigant<BR>
revisions since then. I consider the game very close to, if not completed. I<BR>
may make some more minor changes after a period of solid play-testing.<BR>
<BR>
I set out to create a variant for five players since I play Diplomacy<BR>
strictly face to face. It is often very difficult to get seven people for a<BR>
game. The ancient period of history is well suited to games of conquest and<BR>
expansion and the added naval emphasis caused by the middle of the board<BR>
consisting of the sea is very interesting. During the design of the game,<BR>
emphasis has been placed on its playability. The game does not depict a<BR>
historical setting at a single point in time, although the overall<BR>
historical theme is accurate. History has been 'collaged' - if not preserved<BR>
as much as possible. The rules are consistent with the normal rules of<BR>
Diplomacy, the only exceptions being due to the geography of the area. And<BR>
the map is very appealling - if I do say so myself.<BR>
<BR>
The most interesting aspect of the game is that it is more or less<BR>
'circular'. Each power has a neighbor on (at least) two sides. Each set of<BR>
two powers has a small cluster of supply centers between them. Each of the<BR>
two powers will want to lay claim to some of those supply centers - so they<BR>
will meet in the middle. But both of the powers in each pair have the same<BR>
situation on the other front. So all five powers are faced with the early<BR>
game possibility of having to expand in two directions and with the<BR>
possibility of having to fight a two front war. Also see the other Ancient<BR>
Med article in this issue of the zine entitled THE STRATEGIES OF THE ANCIENT<BR>
MEDITERRANEAN.<BR>
<BR>
The Ancient Med is available to play on The DPjudge as well as USTR. It has<BR>
also been added to Realpolitik - an awesome Diplomacy adjudication program.<BR>
I have set up a web page which contains lots of resources including maps,<BR>
icons, links to Ancient Med games in progress and other Diplomacy related<BR>
resources - not to mention links to ancient history related sites. I hope<BR>
you like what you see when you go to the web site and if you decide to play<BR>
a game on-line, I'd be delighted to hear about it. I'd also be glad to hear<BR>
any comments or suggestions. Be sure to use the latest revision of the<BR>
variant which is Rev. 8. Also, if you use Realpolitik, be sure to use it's<BR>
latest version which as of this writing is 1.5.1.<BR>

THE STRATEGIES OF THE ANCIENT MEDITERRANEAN<BR>
<BR>
At first glance The Ancient Mediterranean board looks like it's divided into<BR>
two halves. In the east there's Greece, Egypt and Persia, while in the west<BR>
are Rome and Carthage. It's easy to assume that in this game there will be<BR>
two sub-campaigns, one in the east and the other in the west, which may or<BR>
may not spill over into each other during the game's early stages. Then the<BR>
winners of each half will start fighting in the later stages of the game.<BR>
This situation would be similar to the original game of Diplomacy.<BR>
<BR>
On the other hand, many people assume that Rome and Carthage would make<BR>
great allies and steam-roll across the board. However, there is at least one<BR>
problem with this alliance. They have no common enemy. They can't attack a<BR>
mutually accessible victim and carve it up between them because no such<BR>
target exists. There is an area in the middle of the board where they can<BR>
provide some degree of mutual support, but this area is small.<BR>
<BR>
This does not necessarily mean that Rome and Carthage will always be at war.<BR>
Most players are aware that to fight one against one without an ally is<BR>
futile and self-destructive. What happens in the west depends, to a great<BR>
extent, on events in the east.<BR>
<BR>
With three powers in the east one might assume that two of them will ally<BR>
against the third. This does happen often enough, but there are<BR>
complications. If either Egypt or Greece ally with Persia against the other,<BR>
the gains in the early game are good, assuming Persia's ally is not getting<BR>
pressure from one of the western powers. But the problem is that whoever<BR>
Persia's ally is, cuts Persia off from the rest of the board once the first<BR>
victim has been eliminated. This leaves Persia in the position of having<BR>
only one possible avenue for expansion, the original ally. And it leaves the<BR>
original ally in the position of being sandwiched between Persia and the<BR>
remaining western powers, which will usually prove to be detrimental. Egypt<BR>
and Greece may decide to ally against Persia, but this alliance has its<BR>
difficulties too, in that both powers have to turn their backs to the<BR>
western half of the board.<BR>
<BR>
The Triple Alliance Strategy<BR>
<BR>
One way to avoid these pitfalls (not that it's possible to avoid pitfalls in<BR>
Diplomacy) is to arrange an alliance structure that accounts for the fact<BR>
that not all enemies or allies will be on the same half of the board. In The<BR>
Ancient Mediterranean this includes any three-way alliance where one of the<BR>
allies is not adjacent to the other two partner powers. For example, in a<BR>
Greek-Carthaginian-Egyptian alliance, Greece is not adjacent to either of<BR>
the other two allies. Greece would aid Carthage in an attack on Rome and aid<BR>
Egypt against Persia. Naturally, the Carthaginian-Egyptian border would be a<BR>
neutral zone.<BR>
<BR>
Rotating your perspective for each power one spot to the right will create a<BR>
new triple alliance consisting of Persia, Rome and Carthage. In this<BR>
alliance Persia would support Rome in an attack on Greece and at the same<BR>
time help Carthage against Egypt. Again the two powers that are adjacent<BR>
would require a neutral border between them (in this example I consider Rome<BR>
and Carthage adjacent).<BR>
<BR>
There are a total of five combinations of this triple alliance structure and<BR>
any given power can be a member of three of them. This can make for some<BR>
interesting games given that different players will negotiate for different<BR>
alliance combinations.<BR>
<BR>
Of course this only describes the beginning game. In the middle game, the<BR>
other two powers will have been eliminated and the triple alliance will have<BR>
to sort itself out.<BR>
<BR>
A Word About Armies<BR>
<BR>
In The Ancient Mediterranean there is a lot of fleet action that happens in<BR>
the middle of the board. But don't forget the flanks. Every power has two<BR>
flanks, however narrow, which can be attacked by land. Usually at least one,<BR>
if not both, of these land areas is either under attack or being used to<BR>
attack. So don't neglect the armies. Greece and Persia especially, have a<BR>
larger land-space to sea-space ratio than it appears and if you are stuck<BR>
with too many fleets bottled up behind the lines, those enemy armies can<BR>
roll around the flanks before you know it.<BR>
