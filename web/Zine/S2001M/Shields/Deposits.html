<p>Well, here we have enother Diplomatic Pouch mail bag. Once again, there were lots of letters waiting for me when I took this assignment on. I've tried to pick out some of the more interesting ones for publication.
<p>However, before we get to that, in the last issue David Cohen tossed out
this trivia question:
<blockquote><i>
In Standard Diplomacy, what province on the board could possibly be occupied by
more different units than any other in 1901?</i></blockquote>
<p>We got a whole bunch of responces to this question, including quite a few wrong answers. Among the respondants who answered correctly were: John Troiano, Michael Zalar, Robert Cochran, Jason Whitby, Eugene Hung, Geoff Baker, Steve Araps, Gary Waines, Brendan Gau and Kevin Kacmarynski.
<P>The correct answer is:
<blockquote><i>
Denmark can be reached by ten different units. Kiel, Berlin, Munich, London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Paris, Marseilles, Warsaw and Moscow.
</i></blockquote>
<p>About half the answers we received were correct. The most common wrong answer was "Belgium with 9". Which is a pretty reasonable guess.
<P>And as this is becoming a regular feature, here's a new one for you:
<P><blockquote><i>In Standard Diplomacy, what property to Vienna and Smyrna have uniquely in common?</i></blockquote>
<P>Think you know the answer? Send your responses to <a href=mailto:dippouch@devel.diplom.org>dippouch@devel.diplom.org</a>!

<p><H4>From Adam Kerpel-Fronius (<a href=mailto:adamkf@gmx.de>adamkf@gmx.de</a>):</H4>
<P>I am a great fan of face-to-face Diplomacy, disovered the Pouch a couple of months ago and had (email) fun ever since. I also read a lot of the literature on your site, but still I am wondering about one thing: why is the leader of Ausria-Hungary the Archduke?
<P>How did it happen that in diplomacy circles, he became the figure everyone relates to? Becuae if we take the year 1901, Franz Ferdinand was admittedly the man of the future (although highly unpopular), but if we take the First World War, he was dead, as we know. Do you have
any idea why itÂ´s not the Emperor?
<P>- Adam
<p><blockquote><i><b>Manus Hand's response:</b>
I'm afraid you're going to be disappointed my my response, which is basically: "You're right!  I never really thought about it!  The persona adopted by most PBEM players is indeed the Archduke, who never ruled, rather than Franz Joseph, the actual leader of the country!  I don't know why that is -- I hope the answer is not ignorance of history.  I guess it's just become a tradition of sorts."
<P>Maybe some of our readers have a thought about this?
</i></blockquote>
<b>Adam's response:</b>
Thanks for your prompt answer. I am not disappointed by your answer... by the way, I have often wondered if we Europeans feel different about Diplomacy than  Americans? I would certainly be interested in the response. What I mean is that although of course I see Diplomacy as a game and the map as something like a complicated chessboard, I still relate emotionally to most of the provinces. And we are probably also more obsessed with history, which maybe (although I am not sure) affects our gaming. For example, in face-to-face games I have often seen the Entente emerging as early as 1901.

<P>*sigh* Like a horde of unwashed barbarians they descend upon
my favorite game, spreading confusion and misdirection with their touch.
Admirable qualities for a Diplomat, granted, but not in this context.  The
horde I refer to is that of the statisticians, those academics that attempt to
reduce Diplomacy to an exercise in combinations, probabilities, and
percentages.
<P>For years, I've been force-fed international relations
theories drawn from some of the most complex and sophisticated statistical
analyses the social sciences have ever seen.  And despite all the best
efforts of the mathematical geniuses that devise them, these theories often turn
out to be remarkably poor predictors of international relations.
Why?  Because international relations is rife with unpredictable variables,
and Diplomacy only slightly less so.
<P>The practice of studying statistics of past Diplomacy games,
while useful to a small degree, is a threat to sound strategy and tactics
everywhere.  There are three major reasons why this is so:
<P>A - There is no single best route to victory for any country
in the game.
<BR>B - Just like in real life, you can't assume that other players
will make the most rational move (if such a thing as "the most rational move" in
Diplomacy could be predicted anyway)
<BR>C - There is an element of luck to
Diplomacy, certain times when simply outguessing your opponent's next move will
result in an advantage.
<P>Knowing that Germany builds a fleet at the end of 1901
approximately X% of the time is no more useful (probably less) than knowing that
your opponent burned his toast this morning, and is now in an antagonistic
mood.  Because statistics aren't going to tell you if that burned toast has
influenced their behaviour.  In fact, beyond the opening moves, unless you
have some useful data about your particular opponent, statistics will be fairly
worthless, because they don't account for the most distinctive element of this
game, the negotiations and flexibility of alliances that make each round of
Diplomacy unique.
<P>The best advice I have heard in Diplomacy is to keep talking
to everyone, all the time.  It's all good intel, even if every single one
of them lies to you in reply.  Far better to study the patterns in their
own behaviour than to study trends in movement by all players of that
country.  In Diplomacy, you're not playing against Germany, England, or
Russia.  You're playing against the Peter, Paul, or Mary behind them.
So until you can gather some useful statistics about those people, there's not
much purpose in bothering with statistics at all.

Grudges in Diplomacy
</a></h3>
</h3>
<hr>
<p><H4>From Brahm Dorst (<a href=mailto:brahm_d@yahoo.com>brahm_d@yahoo.com</a>):</H4>
<P>Totally agree with your post about grudges, and have some more to add.  Too
often people focus their efforts on
revenge, supposing that they will find satisfaction.  Often grudge play
merely facilitates the players own
destruction, because their efforts become focused towards this one task,
making them predictable, and predictability
in Diplomacy is a terrible weakness.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
I agree completely.
</i></blockquote>
<P>I think the most common type of grudge play, is when the victim believes
the stab to be a foolish one, (otherwise
they would have expected it and been prepared) and seeks to clarify this for
the stabber,  by attempting to bring
about the outcome they had prophesized to be a result of the stab in
question.  In a sense, they seek an admittal
that the stab was foolish, and to reassur themselves that their judgement
was good.  If victim and traitor die in
exactly the way warned by the victim, the victim can avoid taking
responsibility for the outcome, and instead place
the blame on the stabbee.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
Yes... as if to say "If you hadn't stabbed me, this would not have
happened to you, or to me."
</i></blockquote>
<P>Although I believe this to often be what
motivates the victim into grudge play, I have
yet to hear of a case where grudge play achieved it's objectives of an
admittal of error, and reassurance of the
victim's competence.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
Ah, but this is where human psychology comes in.  People often feel
better when they can point to a situation and and tell them that it is
their fault.  You could argue that they would like that person to admit
that they were wrong, but even if the other person admits nothing, human
nature is such that the accuser still feels better being able to assign
the blame to somebody else.
<P>If satisfaction came only from the admission of fault by the other person,
then people who get into a grudge style of play would eventually drop
that style when it failed to get them the satisfaction (admission) they
wanted.  But in reality, some satisfaction comes just from pointing the
finger elsewhere, even without an admission of fault.  So even though it
is true, as you say, that grudge play does not result in an admission of
error, that fact does not always dissuade people from playing that way.
</i></blockquote>
<P>In my last email game, I took over Austria in a mercy position.  EG were
just finishing up F, and had just stabbed
R, interrupting IR invasion of A.  I held Trieste, Vienna and Serbia, if I
recall correctly.  Pointing out the EG
threat, IRA formed an alliance, and Russia withdrew from Budapest.  Arguing
that we should crush Turkey, in order to
focus on EG with a secure rear, I was soon set to take Greece, and sent an
army from Trieste toward Warsaw to help
defend Russia.  I was the victim of what I considered a silly stab, as Italy
took the opportunity to invade Trieste.
Russia collapsed as I withdrew to defend homeland, but I never ceased to
send polite press to Italy attempting
reconciliation, nor did I have any intention of betraying Italy, as without
a fleet of my own, I was dependent on
the Italian fleet to hold the English out of the Mediterranean.  However,
all my press was ignored by Italy, and I
turned to Germany, aiding in the destruction of Russia (while secretly!
!
giving Turkey information to make the task difficult), while turning the
loss of my homelands into a slow erosion.
When EG became large enough that the possibility of anyone else achieving a
victory was impossible, and Italy was
too busy defending against England to have any prospect of making gains in
the Balkans, a new alliance was formed
between ITA, an alliance possible only because I do not think would have
been possible had I adopted grudge play
against Italy.  I sent press to EG describing a stalemate line that ITA
could set up at will, and additional press
showing our mutual willingness to establish such a stalemate line.  The game
ended in a 5 way draw, of which I was
the only 1 SC member.  Furthermore, in the EOG, Italy stated that he
believed he had made a mistake in stabbing
Austria, and had been motivated by simple jealousy of the fact that Austria
was about to reach 5 SCs, (1 more than
Italy) only a few years after being half the size of Italy with only 2.
<P>For me, this was an immensely satisfying game, despite what I considered
to be a stupid stab eliminating any hope
of a solo.  I do not think that grudge play could ever lead to the same
sense of satisfaction at games end.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
Interesting story.  And part of it brings up another point that I had
not made before, which is that your style of play affects other peoples'
perceptions of you, and should a game ever reach the point where a
realignment of alliances is necessary, I think people will be more
willing to work if you have played "rationally" as opposed to playing in
a way that shows you are only committed to revenge for the past.  If I
see somebody playing grudge-style in a game, I see that as a liability
and as a result, I am less likely to work with that person if
circumstances are such that I feel I have a choice.
</i></blockquote>
<BR><BR>
<p><H4>From Tom Easton (<a href=mailto:tom.easton@penguin.co.uk>tom.easton@penguin.co.uk</a>):</H4>
<P>I enjoyed your article, but feel the need to make a few points.
<P>Firstly, you seem to be intimating that not holding grudges is the "natural"
or "best" way to play Diplomacy. I'm
not sure I agree completely.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
That paraphrasing leaves out part of the point I was making.  I never said
that players should never want to have revenge for being stabbed.  What I
did say was that players should not let a grudge cause them to act in a
way other than what is in their best interests.
</i></blockquote>
<P>The very fact that players vary dramatically in
their reactions to stabs goes a long
way towards explaining the enjoyment and freshness I get from each game. Not
knowing quite how my ally will react
when I pinch one of his vacant SC's is something I always await with
trepidation. If I knew in advance he'd take the
"correct" approach and say "Darn it. Now what am I going to do? Oh well,
it's just a game, fancy supporting me into
Munich?" would take some of the fun out of it. Diplomacy should be a fast,
ever-changing game, never played the same
way twice.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
My tongue-in-cheek answer is that just because *you* enjoy not knowing
what somebody will do when you stab them, that doesn't mean that they are
playing well by having an irrational reaction.  It doesn't sound like you
are commenting on my definition of logical play, it sounds like you are
saying that part of what you enjoy is not knowing whether or not somebody's
response to your stab will be rational... which is fine.
<P>More seriously, I would not say that not holding grudges will make people
completely predictable.  Even if you know somebody will not have an
irrational reaction, it doesn't mean that you know what they will do,
since there are potentially many alternatives that are reasonable ones.
</i></blockquote>
<P>Secondly, I'm not sure that in the long run, the "Non-Grudge" approach is
even possible for humans. Imagine if my
game-long ally stabs me for one measly SC and at the same time helps my
game-long enemy (who just happens to be a
really annoying character - you know the sort) to three of my SC's. Then my
former ally stops talking and the really
annoying guy starts crowing. If I don't get a little miffed about that, then
I'm really not putting enough into the
game.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
There's nothing wrong with getting miffed, or having an even stronger
reaction than that.  But if one's reaction is to do things that are counter
to his or her long-term interests just because one is angry, then I would
argue that that person is not playing their best.
<P>As to whether non-grudge play is possible for humans, that's an entirely
different question.  I have no doubt that some people are incapable of it.
In real life, the desire for revenge can be a strong motivator because it
can be hard for the rational part of one's mind to dominate over reactions
that are driven by strong emotions.  But Diplomacy is, after all, just a
game.  The desire for revenge can be as much of a motivator as an initial
gut reaction, but since everyone is, after all, playing because they want
to win, they may be able to suppress those gut reactions when they become
aware that something may be driving them in a direction that is counter to
their best interests.  My hope was that an article about grudges would give
some people awareness of the issue, and something to think about when
deciding how to react next time they get stabbed.
</i></blockquote>
<P>Yes it's just a game, but if it doesn't make you react emotionally as well
as intellectually, then why play? I say
get mad and enjoy it. Play the situation as well as you can, obviously,
don't commit suicide, but I believe revenge
is a valid motive for a particular strategy, especially when other players
recognize that is what you are doing, it
gives them confidence that you mean what you say.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
Okay, I'll grant you that one.  I certainly would not want somebody to
impose a change in style on themselves that killed the fun of the game.
It is perfectly reasonable for letting yourself get into the spirit of the
game (anger and all) to be part of the fun of the game.
</i></blockquote>
<P>Finally, In a long-term sense (whether in one game or over many games)
getting a reputation as a "Non-Grudger"
either as a player or as a country can lead to repeat stabbings.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
On this I disagree.  When you play, if you are in a position to consider
stabbing somebody, how much do you know about the reputation of how your
prospective target reacts to getting stabbed?  Unless you play in a small
group, not too much.
<P>Secondly, to whatever extent reputation does matter, I think that reputation
as a good or bad player matters more when people are weighing an opportunity
to stab an ally.  My thesis is that getting away from a grudge-driven style
of play can help improve somebody's gameplay.  In other words, I think
that the reputation of the quality of a player's gameplay will matter more
than their reputation related to revenge and grudges.
<P>Lastly, I think that a reputation as a grudger can be equally bad.  I
can think of one person in particular whom I have run into at conventions
who I would not want to ally with because I don't think he plays in a
rational way, and I find that a dangerous trait to have in an ally.  My
opinion is due in part, though not entirely, to how I've seen him play
after being stabbed.
</i></blockquote>
<P>If I play in a tournament and accept all stabbings with equanamity, I
believe I'm more likely to get stabbed again
in the second round than say a player who went down and took his stabber
with him. Yes that's meta-gaming, but it
can work within one game as well. If you are stabbed in a game, it is often
best to ensure you punish the stabber if
at all possible, even at the expense of your "best" tactical interests to
make it less likely you'll be stabbed
again. Get a reputation as someone who fights back, and you'll be left alone
in favour of those who say "Oh well,
it's just a game, now what is my best prospect from this position." Dip
players are like wolves, they'll pick on the
weakest and leave the fighters alone.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
Several of my previous comments apply again here.  First, a reputation as a
quality player will usually take precedence over reputation as stab victim
(either a grudge-holding fighter or a non-grudge holder).  I've been at
tournaments, and after the first round you tend to hear about who won or
had good finishes in round 1.  People don't usually bother discussing
whether stab victims held grudges or not.  And to whatever extend people
do establish a reputation in how they react, as I also said above, being
bent on revenge regardless of cost can also have the adverse effect of
giving you a reputation as a loose cannon, and that can be a bad thing
when it comes to people being willing to ally with you in the future.
<P>Lastly, both of your previous statements seem to be implying that I am
advocating that when people get stabbed, they just take it lying down
without fighting back.  This is not at all true.  In some cases, fighting
back is most certainly in your best interest.  My point is that putting
the goal of revenge above everything else can result in doing things that
are not in one's best interest, or not doing things that are in one's best
interest.
</i></blockquote>
<P>Personally I feel it's more in the spirit of the game (and more fun) to go
down fighting for a hopeless yet noble
cause (ie revenge :-)) than to hang around on one SC for years hoping to
squeeze into a dull 5-way draw because
you're sat on yet another stalemate line (Hurrah! half a HOF point!)
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
I do not mean to say that I never go down fighting... it's happened plenty
of times.  There are times when I don't feel that I have any better
alternative, and in those cases, I fight to the death.  But the issue is
that I consider whether it is in my best interest to do so before doing so.
Some players don't.  Some players fight out of spite, bent on revenge, and
refuse to consider any alternatives that require a mending of the rift with
an ex-ally regardless of circumstance.  I am not saying you are that type
of player, but that's the kind of player my article was aimed at.
<P>As an iside, my personal style is that I don't care about ranking points.
My goal pushing for that draw, when I do so, is not for the points but to
not lose.
</i></blockquote>
Besides
who knows where you're deathseeking
charge may lead you? You just might get lucky and grab a few of your new
enemy's pick up a new ally to help you
defeat your stabber and get you back on your feet. Someone who figures he
can make good use of your beserker
tendencies.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
You can always come up with "what if" scenarios.  What you describe is not
beyond the realm of possibility, but it surely is not the likely outcome
of retaliatory, revenge-driven "beserker tendencies".
</i></blockquote>
<P>In terms of country, it's arguable that any Italian who stabs an Austrian
early on, or any Austrian who stabs a
German early on needs to be taught a lesson. Central Power squabbles early
on are generally mutually-destructive for
both combatants. If I was playing a stabbee in this situation, and knowing
I'm going down anyway I'd hit
Italy/Austria with everything I had rather than try to fend off the other
surrounding wolves. In most cases, if I do
it well enough, I've as much chance of surviving than staying put and it
shows the rest of the board what I'm
capable of if angered. People take more notice of you if you hit rather than hold.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
Once again, I am really not addressing situations where you know you are
going down anyway.  When I am convinced I am going down for sure, I do
whatever I can to hurt somebody who stabbed me and to make sure that they
don't profit (or better yet suffer) for it.  The issue is whether a desire
for revenge causes somebody to disregard better alternatives.  If there are
no better alternatives, then revenge is as good a motivation as any for
how to order your units.
</i></blockquote>
<P>I do agree there's a time for dropping grudges, gritting your teeth and
smiling at Mr Stab. But there's plenty of
other times where the "sensible" option is leaping naked into the thronging
melee swinging a large piece of lead
pipe
and hollering the Carmina Burana at the top of your lungs.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
Okay, we finally agree on the same point!  There are definitely times for
both reactions.  I think that there are some people (again, not necessarily
referring to you) who could benefit from considering dropping the grudge
more often than they do.
<P>Thanks very much for the thought-provoking reply!

</h3>
<hr>
<p><H4>From Tarzan (<a href=mailto:Tarzan@Austin.RR.com>Tarzan@Austin.RR.com</a>):</H4>
<p>I found your approach interesting.  I have one question/comment.  On
choosing the amount of pts a player's rating can change (you use the
5-15% range based on tournament size), I was curious if you
considered a more complex approach.  Such as, weighing the average
rating of all players in the tournament with/without taking into
account the standard deviation, etc...
<p>I currenlty have a rating system for the Sail Ho! variant which,
unlike your system, is based on individual games.  Nevertheless, the
system weighs each game based on the ratings (i.e. abilities) of the
players in the game.  Thus, winning a game among players who are
rated much better than you increases your rating more than winning a
game among players much weaker than you.  I wonder if you could
adapt this approach based on the abilities (i.e. ratings) of the
actual players in the tournament?
<p><blockquote><i><b>Matt Shields' response:</b>
I'm interested in this, and eventually I plan to start doing this, however, I'm betting that it won't effect the
ratings as much as you think it will. Tournaments usually are pretty
balanced in terms of the numbers of good/average/poor (or new) players, but
clearly such a change wouldn't hurt anything.
</i></blockquote>
<P>Lastly, I wonder if the Sail Ho! Tournament would qualify for the
Tournament Ratings system.
<P>- Tarzan
<p><blockquote><i><b>Matt Shields' response:</b>
Well, not right now, because this rating system is only intended for Face
to Face Diplomacy events. I'm not including any email in there. Having
played alot of FTF and Email both (and enjoying both) I believe that they
are very different games, and I think rating the two together is comparing
apples and oranges.
<P>I'm also rating only tournaments and not individual games (although I
do intend to eventually develop a database of games, I probably won't
rate them). The reason for this is that because each tournament is scored
differently, it rewards different kinds of play. When you rate Diplomacy
games, you are imposing one scoring system on all games, even though they
might have been played under a different one. The North American Diplomacy
Federation's Rating system gets away with this because it only looks at
North American games, and ours all fairly similar. But many European games
are played VERY differently, and again you just can't compare the two.

Mail Received Concerning<br>
<a href=/Zine/F1999R/Szykman/triple.html>The Newly Redesigned Western Triple
</a></h3>
</h3>
<hr>
<p><H4>From Patrick Vanbrabant (<a href=mailto:patrick.vanbrabant@be.arthurandersen.com>patrick.vanbrabant@be.arthurandersen.com</a>):</H4>
<p>I read your article on the new western triple alliance. Currenty I play in
the flatslice game on USIN as Germany. I want to try this opening and
proposed it to England and France.
<P>I have however my doubts about the opening, especially since it opens up
Germanany completely for an coordinated Austrian -Italian attack.
Munich is left without any defense. If Italy moves to Tyr and Austria moves
for what ever reason to Boh. Munich is lost.
<P>Do you have any new brilliant ideas about this problem, appart from doing
the needed diploming stuff. And when diploming how should I approach each of
those countries?
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
To be honest, I personally wouldn't worry about that.  A 1901 coordinated
attack on Germany by Italy and Austria is a very uncommon opening strategy
for Italy and Austria.
<P>I have only had a chance to try this opening once, as France.  In this
situation, everything went fine until Germany got hung up trying to get
past Moscow.  German momentum stalled, Germany lost Moscow, and England
stabbed him.  If Germany had managed to get past Moscow to gain his
next supply center, he would have had a better defensive position and
would not have been as open to getting stabbed.
<P>While the opening does keep E/F/G safe from one another in the first year
or two, this game revealed a more subtle weakness of the opening... that
after the first couple of years Germany's position is hard to defend
against a potential stab, while England is least likely to be stabbed.
I'd say that the opening puts Germany at a disadvantage if Germany can't
get past Moscow.
<P>Thanks for the message!

<p><H4>From Anselm Kersten (<a href=mailto:ankersten@yahoo.co.uk>ankersten@yahoo.co.uk</a>):</H4>
<p>I read your article on the Western Alliance with great
interest. I've just won my first e-mail game as England and started another
one as Germany on Dip2000: "Good as Gold", gamesmastered by Mark Stretch.
I've got the other two to agree to the strategy - they seem quite taken with
it, actually. Richard Orme, playing England, says he's seen it clean up the
board several times.  One point he makes, and that I can bear out from my
last game: Turkey is one key (not necessarily the key) to anyone from the
Western Alliance winning the game, as I suppose England is to anyone from
the eastern half of the board.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
The short response is: I agree.  Since my original article was written
before I'd had a chance to try out the opening, I can elaborate in a
longer response with a bit more of an analysis.
<P>In the one game where I did get a chance to try out the Western Triple (as
France), Germany got stopped at Warsaw, could not push past it, and then
got knocked out.  This happened because Italy, Austria, Russia and Turkey
spotted the Western Triple, and quickly allied so that they could
cooperate in responding to the threat.  In some sense, I would say that
all four of these other powers (AIRT) are important to the success of the
Western Triple.
<P>Among the four, I would say that Turkey and Austria are the two most
critical ones, because they are the ones who most affect the progress of
the Triple in the center of the map in the years beyond the opening
itself.  Actually, Russia is equally important to slowing or stopping the
Triple, but since Russia is being attacked from the West and from the
North, there is no question that Russia will do whatever possible to stop
the Triple.  In other words, Russia's role is important, but there's
really no question about how Russia will respond, whereas the actions of
Austria and Turkey are less certain.  Italy is not irrelevant either, but
the main difference is that if the Eastern powers ally, more coordination
is needed to slow down the Triple in the middle of the board.
<P>From the perspective of importance, I think Turkey and Austria are equally
important.  But if you view Turkey and Austria as being keys to an Eastern
Alliance stopping the Triple, then you can also view breaking the Eastern
Alliance as a key to success of the Western Triple.  If you look at the
problem as being one in which the Western Triple wants to prevent or break
an Eastern Alliance, then I think that Turkey probably is the key, because
I think it is more likely that a Western power will be able to convince
Turkey to defect from the Eastern Alliance than any other power. (This may
well have been what Richard Orme meant when he said that Turkey was the
key.)  Austria and Italy stand to be overrun if they drop their guard,
whereas Turkey may stand to gain if either Italy or Austria get overrun,
since a weaker neighbor who is under attack is a good opportunity for
growth for Turkey.

<P>One slight worry is the article by Goff on the needless bust-ups between
Russia and Germany, in which he disparages this alliance as "just E/F in big
trousers". Not that that'll stop me - I'm trusting to my diplomatic skills
to keep my head up!
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
Your message originally came to me a while ago... how did things go with
the opening?
</i>
<p><blockquote><b>Anselm Kersten's response:</b>
I'm afraid I've got bad news as far as this alliance
goes. It fell apart, due to the much-vaunted Richard
Orme going his own way and trying to take me out. He
obviously preferred opportunism over long-term
strategy, and he's paying for it now, although I've
been squashed into being a good boy (ie. puppet) of a
very firm Russian-Austrian alliance against England.
Pity - I was really looking forward to exploring the
ramifications of this strategy, but it'll have to wait
till another game. Meanwhile, I'll keep your message
on file for when that happens.
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
Too bad things didn't work out.  I agree that what England does is his
choice, but given that a stab by England also led to the Triple falling
apart in the game I played in, I think this points to a weakness in the
opening.  With England not having much of a front with the Eastern powers,
and England's allies not having a well-defended rear, I think it's leaves
a bit too much of an opportunity for an English stab.  While I still think
the the opening itself is a powerful one in principle, I think it needs a
bit of rework to make a stab less easy for England.
</i></blockquote>
<P>I hadn't done enough thinking about the other side of
the board before I embarked on this alliance at the
beginning of the game, which is why your thoughts are
so helpful.
<P>Interestingly, no-one seems to have cottoned on to
this alliance in the three or so seasons that it ran,
despite the fact that all of our units were quite
obviously running away from each other. They did
suspect, but I think we managed to put them off the
scent by astute diplomacy, although I'm not even going
to try to find this out until it's time for end-game
statements!
<p><blockquote><i><b>Simon Szykman's response:</b>
I think astute diplomacy is important.  In the case of my game, somebody
else had read my article and spotted it right away.  That'll teach me to
publish an idea before trying it!
