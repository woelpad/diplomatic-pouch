<p>Well, here we have enother Diplomatic Pouch mail bag. Once again, there were lots of letters waiting for me when I took this assignment on. I've tried to pick out some of the more interesting ones for publication.

<p>However, before we get to that, in the last issue David Cohen tossed out
this trivia question: 
<blockquote><i>
In Standard Diplomacy, what province on the board could possibly be occupied by
more different units than any other in 1901?</i></blockquote>
<p>We got a whole bunch of responces to this question, including quite a few wrong answers. Among the respondants who answered correctly were: John Troiano, Michael Zalar, Robert Cochran, Jason Whitby, Eugene Hung, Geoff Baker, Steve Araps, Gary Waines, Brendan Gau and Kevin Kacmarynski.

<P>The correct answer is:
<blockquote><i>
Denmark can be reached by ten different units. Kiel, Berlin, Munich, London, Edinburgh, Liverpool, Paris, Marseilles, Warsaw and Moscow.
</i></blockquote>
<p>About half the answers we received were correct. The most common wrong answer was "Belgium with 9". Which is a pretty reasonable guess. 

<P>And as this is becoming a regular feature, here's a new one for you:

<P><blockquote><i>In Standard Diplomacy, what province on the board could possibly be occupied by
more different units than any other in 1901?</i></blockquote>

<P><blockquote><i>As an example, Tun could be occupied by units originating in Bud, Nap, Rom, Ven
and Vie.</i></blockquote>

<P>Think you know the answer? Send your responses to <a href=mailto:dippouch@devel.diplom.org>dippouch@devel.diplom.org</a>!

<p><H4>From Jeroen Bruyns (<a href=mailto:jbruyns@btinternet.com>jbruyns@btinternet.com</a>):</H4>

<p>I've been playing diplomacy with the same group of friends for several years
by telehone (a variant not mentioned on your website, but very plesent,
although expensive). We we were wondering about a certain adjustment to the
map, and if somebody got any experience with it.
<p>We thought about extendending the map to the south, joining the north coast
of Africa to the board. Gibraltar would be passable for an army (which could
walk from Spa-NAf-Tun and from Tun to Lybia to Egypt (SC) to Syr. It
disturbes the balances a little bit,
gives Italy more offensive power, makes Turkey a little bit more vunarable
an threatens France dominance in Spain and Portugal. Anybody ever tried it?
Any good or bad experiencs?

- Jeroen

<p><H4>From Tarzan (<a href=mailto:Tarzan@Austin.RR.com>Tarzan@Austin.RR.com</a>):</H4>


<p>I found your approach interesting.  I have one question/comment.  On
choosing the amount of pts a player's rating can change (you use the
5-15% range based on tournament size), I was curious if you
considered a more complex approach.  Such as, weighing the average
rating of all players in the tournament with/without taking into
account the standard deviation, etc...

<p>I currenlty have a rating system for the Sail Ho! variant which,
unlike your system, is based on individual games.  Nevertheless, the
system weighs each game based on the ratings (i.e. abilities) of the
players in the game.  Thus, winning a game among players who are
rated much better than you increases your rating more than winning a
game among players much weaker than you.  I wonder if you could
adapt this approach based on the abilities (i.e. ratings) of the
actual players in the tournament?

<p><blockquote><i><b>Matt Shields' response:</b>
Again, I'm interested in this, although I'll bet that it won't effect the 
tournaments as much as you think it will. Tournaments usually are pretty 
balanced in terms of the numbers of good/average/poor (or new) players, but 
clearly such a change wouldn't hurt anything.
</i></blockquote>

<P>Lastly, I wonder if the Sail Ho! Tournament would qualify for the
Tournament Ratings system.

<P>- Tarzan

<p><blockquote><i><b>Matt Shields' response:</b>
Well, not right now, because this rating system is only intended for Face 
to Face Diplomacy events. I'm not including any email in there. Having 
played alot of FTF and Email both (and enjoying both) I believe that they 
are very different games, and I think rating the two together is comparing 
apples and oranges.

<P>I'm also rating only tournaments and not individual games (although I 
do intend to eventually develop a database of games, I probably won't 
rate them). The reason for this is that because each tournament is scored 
differently, it rewards different kinds of play. When you rate Diplomacy 
games, you are imposing one scoring system on all games, even though they 
might have been played under a different one. The North American Diplomacy 
Federation's Rating system gets away with this because it only looks at 
North American games, and ours all fairly similar. But many European games 
are played VERY differently, and again you just can't compare the two.

<P>- Matt
