<hr>
<p>Greetings avid readers! Welcome to another issue of the Diplomatic Pouch. It's been a little while since our last issue, but that's actually just a function of the publication schedule.
<p>I'm pretty pleased with this issue, although it isn't as big as some. We've got a couple new articles on openings and general tactical discussion which I'm convinced are going to generate no small amount of mail from the readers.
<p>It's been a busy couple of months here at the Pouch. Trying to clean up the disk that diplom.org is housed on was one of several reasons that everything is a little behind schedule here, and is part of the reason for some of the technical problems with the Pouch that some of our users wrote in about. Thankfully, I think we're back on our feet now!
<p>Well I think that's it for the news. So,
<p><h2><center><a href="/Zine/S2001M/">On to the articles</a></center></h2>
<P>
<b>Enjoy The Pouch,</b>
