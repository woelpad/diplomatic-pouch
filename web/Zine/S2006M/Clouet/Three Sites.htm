 <a href="http://frog.born2play.org"><b>Frog</b></a> is a classic "judge". It is the 
oldest community of the three, and its code is used worldwide. Most of the players are 
very dedicated and often experienced. The games tend to take months, if not years, though, 
which is rather less newbie-friendly than the short format of 18-Centres. The community has 
few links with the others. Its Library has long been the prime reference for French speaking 
players, and though it's currently inactive, there are still around sixty articles with good material about openings, strategies, etc.
<P>
<a href="http://www.diplomatie-online.net"><b>Diplomatie-online</b></a> is probably the 
most "newbie-friendly" site for immediate integration into the Diplomacy community. It has 
the largest player base, and games often rich in negotiation, though with the drawback that 
the games are often very slow (on average three times slower than 18-Centres). They're of unlimited 
styles, but lead-based, which sometimes results in strange games. Also, players don't really care if 
someone solos, and don't always defend against it. There are links with the other sites and the FTF 
community, though not as many as 18-Centres.
<P>
<a href="http://www.18centres.com"><b>18-Centres</b></a> is better known internationally 
for two reasons: its close links with the FTF community (the "Glorious" is a DataBase 
including around 750 tournament results worldwide with a profusion of details, up to 
the turn-by-turn game chart, and openings when available), and its PBEM tournaments. 
For instance, the No-Press league has around 200 players (with no language-barriers). 
The "Team-Press Championship" regularly sees Teams from other sites compete. For those new to variants, 
the "Modern" No-Press tournament is a hit with 100 players. There are also lots of home made 
variants (see the list on the table). The reason for the site's success is its thriving 
community and the short format of the games. A No-Press typically takes only one month, 
often less with dedicated players; a press game can be played in two months (two seasons per week). 
The drawback is that the players are often not very dedicated to the game they're in. For No-Press 
that's no big deal, but in a press game it can be a disappointment.
<P>
Another interesting feature is that <b>18-Centres</b> is the perfect place to play real-time. 
There are two or three games every day, sometimes more. If you're looking for a game, 
you can find partners in less than fifteen minutes, and then complete it in two hours 
(assuming it's No-Press). Last but not least, the 
e-zine of <b>18-Centres</b>, "La Gazette," has replaced the 
Library of <b>Frog</b> and is publishing an article a week like a metronome, trying to change subject every time.
