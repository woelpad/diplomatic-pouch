<P>Dipworld is just finishing up the latest ten-team tourney, while
we try to find a middle ground between being extremely strict on
dedication and the wide-open approach of some sites/Judges. Our
extensive stats DB helps. Just finished my 1000th GM turn counting
only DipWorld games (10x or more, counting all) and I think there is
a place DipWorld in the Diplomacy community.
</P>
<P>Variants &amp; small tourneys continue to draw people, and hand
adjudicated games still have a place. With the fire having gone out
of Cat23, a further union of the two major Yahoo sites clearly needs
to be contemplated. There are the same folks in every Cat game, yet
fewer and fewer, on top of which Ray's going to shut down the server
next year. There are challenges which I think DipWorld can help
solve.

<H3>Paradox Diplomacy Computer Game ends productions</H3>
<P>The Swedish computer game developer known for its success with
Iron Hearts, Europa Universalis, Victoria, Crusader Kings etc.,
obtained the license to do a Diplomacy computer game, which was
released last September. After the third patch was released in
December, it completed its production run. However, there are
releases being made in non-English languages, including Russian, in
which there was a sale of several thousand games.
</P>
<P>One of the major weaknesses of the Paradox system was a
combination of a poor A.I., and their complete dependence on running
games only in Real Time and only through their own Metaserver (which
had numerous problems in itself, including that with the initial
release of the game you could not get to the metaserver unless you
found and downloaded patch 1.1; and then it was very slow until you
got to patch 1.2; and finally you needed to wait till patch 1.3 to
get the ability to communicate directly with other players in
standard text rather then using their limited &lsquo;graphic
language&rsquo; icon communicator). This crippled their meta service
play from the start. However, if you are up to it, you can get to
their Diplomacy forum at:<A HREF="http://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=295">

</P>
<P>We believe that this is the third attempt at a Diplomacy Computer
game, all of which have been failures in terms of serving the hobby
at large. Nevertheless it continues to get the concept of the
Diplomacy game out there, and at last count about a hundred people
were recruited from there to the mainstream hobby, though the
sticking factor is unknown. It was a great opportunity that simply
missed its target by aiming in the wrong direction.

<H3>Europe: General</H3>
<P>After several hard steps forwards and backwards, the European
face-to-face hobby has established a Charter for its organization.
Amongst other things, they have taken responsibility for the EDC
(European Diplomacy Championship), and have called for the creation
of a European Diplomacy Vacation convention where the games will be
held in a social setting rather than a tournament structure.

<P>They are working on their own web site. Currently the European

<H3>North America: General</H3>
<P>The NADF has restarted a new web site (the paradoxical qualities
in that sentence are astonishing) with Bill Blackmer as the web
master. David Maletsky has taken over the duties of writing &lsquo;This
week in review,&rsquo; and Buz Eddy is still running his Masterpoint
and chess style rating system, which he has decided to keep out of
the public realm, but also has his Special Features news at:
<A HREF="/NADF">http://www.diplom.org/NADF</A>.
Buz is going to be concentrating on running the Dragonflight
Diplomacy events.

<H3>Israel<BR><I>Shlomi Yaakobovich </I>
</H3>
<P>The Israeli hobby has been quite idle in the last year or so,
which is probably my fault for not pushing anymore. No one has taken
over yet, so I suppose we need to wait for the next generation. The
official site is at: <A HREF="http://www.diplomacy.org.il/">http://www.diplomacy.org.il</A>,
but it hasn't been updated for a long time. The only semi-Israeli
activity is the Judge I maintain, which allows Hebrew games, but
there hasn't been such a game for over a year, too. It's all quite
disappointing, I know...
</P>
<P>(Editor's note: If anyone out there wants to help the Israeli
hobby get active, let us know; we'll put you in touch with someone)

<H3>Mediterranean Grand Prix</H3>
<P>Just as there are continental collections of face-to-face
tournaments to be ranked together for the determination of a
&lsquo;champion&rsquo; (See Bismark Cup, Grand Prix, European Grand
Prix), there is a series of regional linked tournaments; in the US
there is the East Coast Swing and the West Coast Swaggle, and in
Europe there is the French Championships and the Italian
championships. Now there is a collection of 4 events in the
Mediterranean at Cannes-Marseilles-Milan-San Marino calling itself
the GP Mediterranean: http://www.cleosolutions.com/diplo/med.htm
</P>
<P>The current listing after two events has forty-two people, with
Gwen Maggi, David Cleopadre and Leonardo Quirini in the top three
spots.
