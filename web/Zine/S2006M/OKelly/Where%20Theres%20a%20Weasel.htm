Life is good in Chicago. Since forming in September 2005, the Windy City Weasels have met six times, playing a total of seven games. To date, 21 different players have joined us, and about a dozen others have expressed an interest. There are a few sharks in our group, but most of the players are either learning the game or rediscovering it after having played in college.
<P>
We’ve been busy so far this year, with single boards in January, April and May, and two boards in March. We’re now gearing up for a multi-board session on August 12. We’re optimistic that we can fill three boards.
<P>
If we can pull that off, it will be quite a feat considering that when I started the group, I could only convince one of my close friends to play. To fill that first board way back in September, I utilized the Informal Gatherings feature on the Diplomatic Pouch and the hobby registry on the old NADF website.
<P>
I also went to boardgamegeek.com and searched for people in the area, then checked each of their profiles to see a) whether they owned a copy of Diplomacy and b) whether they had rated it six or higher on a scale of one to 10. If the answer to both was yes, I emailed them. This search took quite a bit of effort, and the results were bleak. Only one guy emailed me back, and his work schedule precluded his participation.
<P>
I had more luck with my monthly boardgame club. I was able to convince two of them to play in the first game, and one guy brought a friend. Two other members of that club have played with us.
<P>
Finally, I posted a message at DipWorld, the online community where I play Diplomacy by email (games.groups.yahoo.com/group/dipworld/).
<P>
After our first game, I created a Yahoo group for the Weasels (games.groups.yahoo.com/group/ChicagoDip/), and now players are finding us.
<P>
So, we’ve built a nice core of committed players, we’re hosting regular games, and our group continues to grow. Our goal is to host a multi-round tournament sometime in 2007, which we’ll call Weasel Moot.
<P>
If you’re in the Chicago area and want to join us, or if you’d just like to follow our progress, please join our Yahoo group. Hope to see you over a board soon!
