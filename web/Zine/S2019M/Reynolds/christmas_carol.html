				<h3>Harry the Gamer</h3>
				<h4>(To the tune of Frosty the Snowman and with apologies to Walter Rollins, Steve Nelson, and Gene Autry)</h4>
				<h4>December 30, 2018</h4>

				<p>
					Harry the gamer </br>
					Lives to play <span class="game_name">Diplomacy</span>. </br>
					All he wants to do is take off his shoes </br>
					Pop a beer and start to play.
				</p>

				<p>
					Harry the gamer </br>
					Was as drunk as drunk can be. </br>
					He put down his booze when he had to choose </br>
					And wound up with Italy.
				</p>

				<p>
					He made a cry and had to try </br>
					To see if anyone would trade. </br>
					He only got some loud rude laughs; </br>
					Even Austria refrained.
				</p>

				<p>
					He was surrounded </br>
					By people he didn't trust. </br>
					To the west was France where he had no chance </br>
					To avoid being crushed to dust.
				</p>

				<p>
					His eastern neighbour </br>
					Might be coaxed into A-I, </br>
					It would be a blast if they made it last </br>
					Then they wouldn't have to die.
				</p>

				<p>
					He didn't trust the Austrian </br>
					To keep his word at all. </br>
					When Trieste and Venice bounced </br>
					He began to dance around.
				</p>

				<p>
					Harry the gamer </br>
					Played his greatest game that night. </br>
					Yes he got the win, full of lies and sin, </br>
					And then he never played again.
				</p>

				<p>
					When they would ask why, </br>
					He would shake his head and say, </br>
					<q>Playing Italy sucked the joy and glee </br>
					From my mind and soul that day.</q>
				</p>

				<h3>It's the Most Wonderful Time For a Beer</h3>
				<h4>(With apologies to Eddie Pola, George Wyle and Andy Williams)</h4>
				<h4>December 31, 2018</h4>

				<p>
					It's the most wonderful time for a beer. </br>
					With your enemies swarming, your temperature warming </br>
					Until it is clear </br>
					That your most natural drink is a beer.
				</p>

				<p>
					It's the game you were so sure you would win. </br>
					One neighbour's a twit, the other half-wit, </br>
					You sat with a grin </br>
					And you poured yourself a tonic and gin.
				</p>

				<p>
					All your navies are floating </br>
					And you're sitting back gloating </br>
					With them retreating in fear. </br>
					Of course no holiday's done </br>
					Without some eggnog and rum </br>
					Chase it all down with more beer.
				</p>

				<p>
					Why am I lying face down on the floor? </br>
					Units are thinning, the room is spinning, </br>
					I can write no more. </br>
					Yes my most wonderful game is no more!
				</p>

				<p>
					N.M.R? You are joking! </br>
					I am lying here croaking </br>
					My orders for you to hear! </br>
					Though I'm under the table </br>
					I know that I'm still able </br>
					To make myself sort of clear!
				</p>

				<p>
					It's my least successful game of the year. </br>
					I just cannot play in this sad decay. </br>
					The lesson is clear. </br>
					Yes my most dangerous foe is those beers.
				</p>

			<p>
				Happy New Year, folks!
