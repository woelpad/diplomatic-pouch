<H3>What Do You Want From Me?</H3>
So you came here to read the mail, did you?  Okay, then, read the mail.
With the issue late enough already, I won't spend any time writing
something that will just stand in your way.  So here's what you came for:
<P>
<HR size=5>
<H3 align=center>Mail Received In The Form of<br>
An Invitation to Dedicated Players</H3>
<HR>
School of Creative Destruction (SCD) is a group of competitive, high
dedication PBEM Diplomacy players that is working to foster an environment
of high quality play, as well as a community feel through discussions
over email.  If you hate NMRs, if you hate games delayed by late orders
or quitters who abandon a game as soon as things go sour, if you play to
win and fight to the end with your last remaining unit, then read on.
<P>
SCD games are played by e-mail, both on and off judges.  This is not the
only high-dedication group in existence, but the group also emphasizes
interaction outside of games through discussions over an email mailing
list in addition to the games themselves.
<P>
The SCD is serious about the emphasis on high dedication and promptness.
Many if not most games allow NMRs (which some people claim disrupt the
game, and to which we reply, "Only in games where they occur!").  The SCD
Charter outlines the process for removal of players who are unreliable,
and this process has already been used in order to maintain the standards
expected by the group as a whole and to keep up the quality of play.
<P>
If you are a high-quality player (not necessarily quality in skills, but
in your ethic: play to win, fight to the end, always on time), then take a
look at <a href=http://www.erols.com/szykman/SCD_Charter.html>the SCD
Charter</a>.
If you like the idea of playing with other players who are committed to
those standards, then <a href=mailto:hturner@wam.umd.edu>drop a note to our
current SCD Chair</a> and ask to join.
<P>
Dedicated players need only apply, but only dedicated players need apply.

Dear Anonymous:
<P>
Good job!!  Concise and to the point.  I have never cheated at Diplomacy, and
never will, for the reasons you stated.  Self-integrity among dippers may
seem at first blush hypocritical, but players of a game where deception is
sanctioned and expected still have a right to expect that rules of the game
will be followed.  Thanks, both for stopping and for encouraging others to
do the same.  Your maturity is showing.  I honestly hope you get your first
win honestly.

Nice articles. Just wondering if you will touch at the subject of
sending press to the wrong power. It have happened to me more than
once (but not THAT many times) and I have got it once myself. Now, it
can be very bad or not so bad depending on what you said. The
immediate thought have allways been, what should I send now to that
power? The next thought have always been, can I fake this thing and
use it to my advantage? That is, sending pres to someone, pretending
it was for someone else and in it both faking the other powers press
to me and my reply? I have never tried it as I have never come up
with a good opportunity or anything good to write. It is however
something never really possible in FTF games. I would very much like
to hear what others think about this and if you will write anything
about it? I have also thought about posting it in the rec.games.diplomacy
newsgroup.
<P>
<blockquote><i>[<b>Author's response:</b>
On the subject of sending power to the wrong person; I would be very
cautious. I always double check which power I send my press to. I
remember a situation where Russia accidently sent a press to me (as
Austria) that was intended for Italy. The press tippied word of a R/T
juggernaut forming. I brandished the press to Turkey and told him I
knbew what was coming, and in such a way persuaded him to join me
against the Russian.
<P>
As for purposely mis-sending press, I would also not advise it. A
mis-sent press is a relatively rare event, and IMO the consequences
could be undesired. It might be fun to try now and then, though.]</i></blockquote>

Great lyrics!  I also really enjoyed your

Here's another for the Sinatra collection:
<center>
<H4>The Tender Trap</H4>
You start by building German ties,<br>
And soon you're telling England lies,<br>
You're singin' your own song, you go along, boy, then ZAP!<br>
Those ties, those "lies," they're part of the Tender Trap.
<P>
Soon Italy is on his knees,<br>
And Turkey's moving west with ease,<br>
You quickly write the Tsar but he's too far, away,<br>
Those knees say, "Please don't fall in the Tender Trap."
<P>
Some like to fight, thinking brinksmanship is... buried<br>
But not by might, other powers will be getting... married<br>
And suddenly it feels so bad,<br>
To know that you've been truly had,<br>
You hurried to a spot, that's just a dot, on the map,<br>
You're hooked, you're cooked, you're caught in the Tender Trap.

Thanks for the humor.

<a href=/Zine/F1998M/Tarzan/assign.html>Assigning Powers to Players In Diplomacy</a>
</h3>

I thought your article "Assigning Powers" was great. I had just been
discussing the issue of distributing powers among players with a friend,
as we are to play a face-to-face game next weekend.
<P>
As for which method is best, I think that depends on the circumstances. I
think that if some players are playing their first game, random
assignment might be best, as I think otherwise they may have a
disadvantage.
<P>
One method I found particulary interesting was the one where the
"bottom-most" selection from each players were concidered simultaneously.
I'm eager to try that sometime.
<P>
Another idea for power assignment could be the "History of the World"
method (from the empire assignment in that game) which works like this:
The players are ordered at random. The first player randomly draws a
colored anchor or something else representing a power. If he wishes to
play that power, then he simply keeps the anchor. The other players are
not to know which power has been drawn. If a players draws a power he does
not want to play, he may pass it to another player, who has not yet been
assigned a power to play. That player does not get to know which power he
was given. Of course, when a player who has already been given a power by
someone else is in turn to draw, he must pass the anchor to someone else.
I'm not saying that this method is in any way better than the ones
presented in the article, simply that it is another. One twist this method
might give the game, is that the diplomacy actually starts before the game
begins. A player who was appointed a power he didn't like, might seek
revenge and a player given a power he felt was good, might be more willing
to ally with whomever gave it to him.
<P>
Again, thanks for a great article.

Interesting article about assigning powers.  Do you happen to know what the
judge uses?  I seem to recall someone once telling me about a "least sum of
squares" type thing.  It would be similar Method 2, Variation C except you
want the least points, and the "satisfaction" list is [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36,
49]
<P>
<blockquote><i>[<b>Author's response:</b>
Thanx for your question.  According to version 2.0 of the Judge Code,
"[the Judge] uses an ACM [Association for Computing Machinery]
algorithm (Algorithm 415) to assign powers to the
players, according to their preference lists, their order of
signing on to the game, and
(unfortunately) the order that the powers are listed in the power
letters list for the variant,
the algorithm used "an ACM algorithm (Algorithm 415) to assign
powers to players."
<P>
To be honest I am not familiar with "an ACM algorithm" (or for that matter,
Algorithm 415).  However, I did get a chance to review the Judge Code and how
power assignment is handled.  While I cannot honestly say I completely
understood it (the documentation is somewhat limitted), as near as I can tell
it functions like this.
<ol>
<li>A version of Method 2, Variation A (described in my article) is employed.
That is, the Top-Most choice from each player's Preference List is considered
simultaneously.
<li>The players are placed into an "order".  This "order" is based on the order
in which the players signed-on to the game.  Thus, the first player to signup
s a player in the game is first on the list, the second player is second,
etc....
<li>When reviewing the Top-Most choice of each player's Preference List, if 2
player's have the same Top-Most choice the "tie" is not broken "randomly" (as I
described in my article), but rather the player who appears earlier on the list
receives this power.
</ol>
The results of the Judge Code method might be somewhat disturbing, as follows:
<ol>
<li>the FIRST person to sign-up for the game (as a power) will ALWAYS get his
first choice of powers
<li>when ties occur, they are resolved in favor of whoever "arrived" (that is,
signed-on) first (rather than at random)
<li>other types of ties are determined simply based on the alphabetical listing
of the powers (for example, AEGIRT)
</ol>
The methods I outlined in my article are very easily adaptable to coding.  I
leave these decisions in the capable hands of the Judge Maintenance group.  If
they would like me to code any of my methods for them I will be happy to help.]

Hi, I know you don't know me.  I played s-mail dip in the late
eighties/early nineties.  I just wanted to say thanks for maintaining this
online presence.  Now that I have my degree and the job I was shooting for I
can rejoin the dip commmunity!  I used to play in a zine called <i>Rebel</I>
published by Melinda Ann Holley.  Don't know if she's still around, but I'd
like to say hi if she is.  Anyway, thanks again and keep it up, it's worth
the effort.
<p>
<blockquote><i>[<b>Publisher's response:</b>
Thanks for the words of encouragement!  As for Melinda, she is definitely
still involved in the hobby.  I met her FTF for the first time at the last
World Championships,
although we didn't get a chance to talk much.  I sit on the Hobby Awards
Committee that she chairs, so I regularly get snail mail from her meaning
that I do
have her snail mail address at home.  I've decided to publish your
letter here so that I have your e-mail address somewhere I can find it when
I have her snail mail address in front of me, but also because you may get
a faster answer from a reader out there than you will from me.]</i>

I must say. I am impressed with your site and activities.
Congratulations.
The people playing Diplomacy are really special. There must be something

I played postal Diplomacy 15 (!) years ago, and now I want to get
involved by e-mail. Seems great. I'm really excited.

Thanks, and keep it up!

<blockquote><i>[<b>Publisher's response:</b>  After helping Gino climb through
the ropes and enter the PBEM ring, I received a subsequent mail from him
that was filled with thanks for my answers, and repeating his opinion
(which I share) that Diplomacy players sure are nice.  In response to this,
I coined a phrase that I was so taken with that I put it into the library of
Diplomacy quotes (one of which is randomly shown to you each time you
visit The Pouch's front page):  "Getting yourself on someone's good side
gives your knife the best possible access to his back."]</i></blockquote>
