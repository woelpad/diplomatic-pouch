I have been having a ball reading commentary from WDC in the latest issue and BOY! am I glad that I decided to hold off on commentary. There are a few things people need to hear about from my games that directly affects others' comments from this issue!

(the most interesting so far is that Chris Martin has pegged me as playing Austria in one of the games he was in. I will accept the compliments graciously, but I probably DO need to tell him that John Quarto did not play Austria the entire weekend nor was he ever in a game with Chris that weekend!)

Here's a message I received about an article in the S1998M issue -- it
should have appeared in the deposits for the last issue, but I forgot 
about it, so I guess it will go in the next one.  It can be followed by
a bracketed reply saying something to the effect of "We're all curious --
followup messages are welcome and will appear in the next issue's Pouch

Simon,

Glad to hear from you!  (Read your article in DipPouch...)

Yes, I would be very interested in what was happening between the Great 
Powers in the dippouch game/bourse.

I was the 3rd largest holder of francs (behind Loeb and some other guy), 
with a side bet on Turkey (sold all other Great Power currency).

The game just kind of melted away over the winter break...the level of 
activity in the monthly buy/sell arena plummeted.  (The usual problem with 
our hobby; that a substantial fraction of players are students whose 
lives are dominated by the tides of the semester grade reports...)

Further, I think that many players did not fully grasp the mechanics of 
how the buy/sell orders were filled.  Many players accurately guessed the 
transaction price each month, but of course, the only players that got to 
actually trade currency were the ones with buy orders far above or sell 
orders far below the trade price.

Indeed, some players sent in sell orders and buy orders that were the 
stuff of fantasy.  "Hey, if someone wants to buy my English pounds at 
$1.50 each, I am more than glad to sell them!"  These people did not 
understand that even if someone actually did want to buy up English 
pounds (say they wanted a crack at taking over the helm of state), and 
offered $1.50 each, the players that would get the resulting inflated
sale price would be the ones with the _lowest_ selling price orders.  

This inability to understand what was needed to actually change ones 
portfolio from the inital distribution probably acted as an unseen 
barrier to continued involvement....critical mass in the market was not 
sustained.

But it was cool to read all the email traffic about the value of the 
"basket of currencies", the sophisticated ananlyses, and the broadcasts 
from the various members of the Russian Cabinet.

It took me a few turns to figure out how to actually get currency to 
change hands (see above).  After that, I decided that I would pick a 
horse and go with it (and a side bet).  The churning of the market 
business did not appeal to me...     The horse I picked was the 
designer of the bourse, Loeb, playing France, a strong Power.  Further, 
I had identified the Italian player as weak, from a previous game....

I vote FOR a further article on dippouch.  Maybe we could put it in a 
multi-layed TO: FROM: email loop that will bounce around between various 
internet nodes for 99 years or something before being read.  Sort of like 
a cyber time capsule.

So, how is your life?  I recall that you stepped down as master to move 
from SF to LA and get married?  But now, I see that you are in Pittsburgh
....hmmm.  Must be you are now in a PhD program?

Chris Hoover

Hello, there ... finally had the time, inclination and address present
all at the same time to visit The Pouch ... of course, it's wonderful
for an old hand like me to bang around in here, especailly after hearing
so damn much about it.

Anyway, within a few mouse clicks of hitting the Pouch, one simply must
visit the Registry to see if one is listed.\

to my surprised delight, I'm in there.  Thought I'd offer you some info
to flavor the entry with a bit of info.  You are obviously free to use
as much or little (or even none) of what I'm sending.

Short and to the point.

drop me a note to say hi.

Best,

Hello Frank,

You've hit upon something with your comment.

My ideas, naturally, did not arise in a vacuum. The bank-rank maurauder
idea is one that I've often discussed with one of my friends mentioned in
the article. Your point of view is essentially his own. Though he feels
that it's a powerful weapon, he also feels that it's the psychology, more
than the tactical threat, that ruins the other player's position. His own
opinon is the same as yours, i.e. "If that ever happens to me, I'll just
have one unit follow his around, taking the SC's as he jumps out of them,
until I can negotiate an end to the situation, or destroy the unit."

Real games, of course, are more complicated than that, but I agree that
it's a better baseline strategy for dealing with the situation than the
overcommitment of forces to stopping the invader. I suppose "how to handle
it if it happens to you" was a topic worth covering, had I thought of it.
Of course, the first bit of advice is "don't let it happen to you".

The nature of articles like this is to somewhat oversell your points (no
one is around to debate you after all). In reality, though, since the vast
majority of players will overreact, it's a great tactic to employ. Further,
it's the rare back rank maurauder that can't help you to strategic gains
well worth the cost, even if it's optimally dealt with.

Paul

P.S. I think I'll copy Manus into this exchange for consideration of
publication in the Pouch Deposits column.

Hi Paul,

I find both of your articles among the best I've encountered in the 'Zine
and find myself agreeing with almost all of what you say.

There is one point I am eager to get your opinion on. In your article you
wrote

The unit behind enemy lines is such an enormous distraction to the defender
that one must seriously consider placing it there, even if it has no hope
of
capturing a center. The threat posed by the mere presence of such a unit is
often sufficient to cause your enemy to assign two, three, or even four
units that were formerly on the attack to defensive maneuvers. The gain in
space or tempi that results is often well worth eventually losing the
lonely
maurader. I've never seen a position recover from the crippling effect of a
back rank maurauder.



and certainly, it is not unusual to see just such a panicked reaction to a
'line breaker', even among superior players. But, is it justified? You
argued so convincely elsewhere in your article that a good player should
consider the sacrfice of an SC to achieve a strategic goal. Why not accept
the unit behind the lines as an annoying fait accompli and avoid being
provoked into a disproportionate response. In the case you mentioned of
four
defenders seeking to hunt down and kill the marauder, this would mean using
just a single 'minder' constantly ordered to move to the marauder's
position, thereby limiting it's SC consumption potential to one and
preventing it from providing any support to new, would-be, line breakers..



I think you will find that the over-reaction of many players to a unit
behind the lines is a emotional response to terretorial imperatives and
can't be justified strategically.



Frank

Paul,

I like your remark very much. You not only point out the role of emotional
reactions, but remind me not to expect consistent optimal play against from all
opponents. I'm sure you are right. If everyone played rationally all the time
there would be alot fewer wins.

You make alot of chess comparisons in your article and it occurs to me that
excellent chess players also deviate from assuming their opponents will play
optimally. For instance, if they know an opponent has had a history of
difficulty defending an isolated pawn, he will try to lead the game in that
direction. Something I've always wondered about (maybe you could tell me?) is
whether are there any computer chess programmes whose play varies according to
an opponents strengths and weaknesses?

Getting back to your article, I was a bit disappointed you didn't mention
anything about how the effectiveness of a marauder depends on the victim's
personality. Whereas an overly aggressive opponent might be provoked into an
over-reaction, a more phlegmatic victim, such as the friend you described,
could benefit from the assault, since, according to your concept, the
phlegmatic player will have devoted less time to defense than the marauding
power has dedicated in attack.

This brings me to some points I have been thinking about lately: the importance
of being about to read an opponent's personality; the importance of masking
your own personality; and the importance of having an arsenal of personality
driven procedures that can be flexibly implemented.

What I mean by 'personality' is any fairly consistent behaviour pattern. My
idea is that too consistent behaviour is debilitating. Firstly it makes our
actions predictable, and secondly it opens a window for manipulation.

For instance, if I meet you across the table and find out you have an ego with
a large appetite, I might be able to enslave you by providing that ego a high
protein diet. Once I feel confident of the behaviour of one or two players, I
can make educated guesses as to how they might continue and from which I can
then make long term plans. If I'm the only one that can plan far ahead this
would give me a big advantage over other players.

Another aspect I think important, because it confuses alot of people, is that
this has nothing to do with moral judgements as we usually understand them. It
makes no difference whether aplayer is predicatably generous or cowardly, as
long as he  is predictable. For this reason I think that the articles there
telling people how important it is to be a consistently trustworthy ally miss
the point. Being consistently anything isn't going to get you very far. What's
more important is to use disguised predictability to give the appearance of
harmlessness while knowing when and why to suddenly change behaviour.

Since my argument is that the effectiveness of tactics depends on the victim's
personality, it follows that a psychological profile of the players is needed,
and that we need a flexible set of manipulation techniques.

Lately I have begun putting together a technique table along these lines.
Here's an extract to show what I mean:


      Behaviour
      characteristic            Technique                 Desired result

                                                     Weakens ally's ability to
                           Near broadcast            solicit supporters by
 Fickle (ally)             announcement you have     making him seem
                           evidence of ally's        unsavoury. Hold moral
                           impending betrayal.       high ground for
                                                     'preemptive' stab.
                                                     Delay hostile stab
 Greedy (ally)             Control thru stories of   (especially useful if
                           Elyssian Fields
                                                     already near 18 SCs)
                           1. Encourage ally to lead
                           attack against bilious    Foe shows
                           foe. (This is especially  disproportionate hostile
 Temper (foe)              good if you have a greedy response against biggest
                           ally.)                    enemy, opening way for
                           2. Get unit behind the    opportunitistic gains.
                           lines.


One of the funniest things for me is how obvious this all looks once it's been
written down. Yet, in my experience, even players with a formidable intuitive
understanding of psychology haven't given much though to systematically
codifying their methods, and the exercise can be useful.

Well, what do you think?

You don't know me.  I hope it was not out of line to contact you.  I was
wondering if the DP Pouch had been contacted by Hasbro yet.  Many of us
Dippers are (understandably) concerned that Hasbro might do evil/nasty
things to our community.

Anything you know would be very helpful.  You might (if the issue is not
too delicate) put up some sort of page letting us little-ones know what's
up.  Are we to run in fear of the great legal machine of Hasbro, or do we
have a protective older brother.

(heard everyone at Avalon Hill was fired... yipes!)

Hi. I've just read your excellent article "Caissa at the Diplomacy
Table" in the DipPouch.  Being a chessplayer myself, the mode of
thinking you describe is the natural and instinctive one for me - what
I found really instructive was the fact that you indirectly highlight
how (most) other Dip players think, and how to approach the task of
getting one's own 'chess-like' thought patterns across to them.
Finally, also, an article that discusses _real_ strategical thoughts by
means of concrete examples - I wish I had access to this when I was a
newbie :-).

Keep up the good work!
Konrad Scheffler

Hi Manus,

I'm glad to hear you are on the road to recovery.

You may recall I had an exchange with Paul Windsor about modelling
strategies according to opponents personalities (you were copied). I
wanted to request that in case you intend to publish this exchange
please NOT to publish my name. I am thinking especially of Quisling, in
which my identity is known, and which is just about to employ these
ideas in a finale. Publishing with my name could ruin everything.

Thanks and, in answer to your rgd notice, I missed you.

Hello! i don´t know if i´m sending this mail to the right person, but anyway... This is meant to be to the persons managing DipPouch. Are you one of them?

I would like to see a public messageboard on The Pouch. It is visited by so many people with a common interest that it is almost strange that there isn´t already one... 
It would be great for the hobby if different Dip players could communicate even if they aren´t in the same games!

Father Hand, I come before you to confess my sins mortal and venial. It
has been two months since my last confession.

Today, with full knowledge, complete understanding and willful intent, I
did use your world-class web site "The Diplomatic Pouch" for work during
work hours. I confess that I knew I needed to find out some information
on the international employment laws. I was advised to seek the websites
for the embassies of both Germany and England/Great Britain/United
Kingdom/whatever-they-call-it-now. I remembered an article reviewing the
web efforts of the Diplomacy countries, ("Seven Embassies for Seven
Dippers" by Larry Peery
http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/F1997M/Peery/7Embassies.html
DPF1997M) so without any shame or hesitation I found the article, surfed
over to the aforementioned embassies and got what I needed, ALL ON
OFFICIAL COMPANY TIME. 

Yes, Father Hand, I got paid for making an official work visit to The
Pouch. I know that it isn't supposed to be like that. I know that I
should have used a search engine. I confess my trespasses, and I ask
forgiveness, promising never to use The Pouch for work again.

Mea Culpa, Mea Culpa, Mea Maxima Culpa.

Troy

Kind Sir,

Despite being new to e-Mail Diplomacy I acquired the taste for the
game some years ago. Unfortunately my friends didn't understand this
taste and there were only rare ocasions were I had the chance to play
it.

By now I have one of the poorest records in PBEM Diplomacy but I am
still willing to keep my gaming going. My love for the game has made
me start my own Diplomacy homepage, so I am hoping to find some people
that play the game in my own country. I am also risking to be adressed
by Mr. Peery as one of those unknown fellows who talk too much about
The Game without even playing it.

Anyway, many of my fellow countrymen can't follow a single line in
english language and I am proposing to translate some of my favourite
articles to Portuguese and make them available in my site.

I am writing to you to ask you permission to translate some of the
DipPouch articles and make it availabe to Portuguese speaking Dippers
in my homepage at http://geocities.com/timessquare/bunker/9095.

If you agree to let me use your texts please reply this letter, a lot
of people would be gratefull if you would let me do this.

Considerately,

Pedro Estadao

Manus!

Wow, Hits is off and running strong!

I had hoped to have an article for you, or at least a letter, and I guess
it's still not impossible, but I ahve seventeen things going at once -- the
most exciting of which would be the call-back for a broadway workshop of a
musical called "Swing"  -- you may recall that ballroom dancing is how I put
bread on the table, so this is double exciting for me!

I hope that you are feeling better, and perhaps the following addendum could
be added to this Issue of the Pouch;

"The World Diplomacy Champion would like to note that the contents of the
article "Why People Hate the World Dip Champ" --published in the Previous
installment-- was entirely humerous, and that all the ribbing that went
along with it was totally good natured.  thank You'

How's that sound?

Chris

Well, I would be the first to admit that I am not the biggest Internet
Dip fan in the world - but I do receive about 30 Dip zines from 6
different countries - so I would be well placed to do this. OK - if
Manus and the others are happy I will be more than willing to help.

Let me know if everyone else is content.

Larry,
	I agree that a Chatroom is a good idea and would quickly fill
with dippers, but I'm not sure I like the ParaChat rooms.  Here are a few 
of the things I find less than ideally desirable about ParaChat:
	* Java interface requires graphical web browser
		As incompresensible as it may seem to us there are quite 
		a few people who have 'text-only' links to the Internet. 
		It would be nice to include them if possible (and it is)
	* Busy interface just doesn't look like the rest of the pouch.  
		Manus has been very careful and at times dictatorial in his
		effects to keep a uniform look across the pouch.  The big 
		block of chat just doesn't look like it belongs.
	* Advertisments
		The Dip Pouch has the distinction of being one of the few 
		truly good sites on the web that does not have advertisments.
		While I'm no loon saying that the profit motive is in any 
		way impure, I would just like to see any money that the 
		Pouch helps earn go to Manus, or .igo., or the hobby.

That said, all of these could be rememdies by giving money to parachat.  
Paying chat rooms are able to have an IRC (internet relay chat -- text 
based and generally superior interface) gateway.  Pay sites have mmore
control over what the room looks like, pay sites doen't get hit by 
advertisments.  
	The cost is $50-75 a month and that's just money I don't 
think the hobby should want to provide to someone outside the hobby.

Perhaps we should look for some free solutions that could be implemented 
locally.  I know that opensource message forums are plentiful and while 
they doen't offer the real-time satisfaction of chat, they are 
self-archiving and can breed some excellent discussion.  To see an 
example of forums at their finest check out http://slashdot.org .   
	Another possible solution is an IRC channel on a global IRC 
network.  These have the benifits of being accessible from all platforms 
and with all terminals, tons of 'getting started' help available, more 
configurable and more administration options.
	Who knows, maybe we can find a free/opensource version of a 
parachat style chatroom and can interface that with an IRC room.  What 
parachat is offering is the server/hosting their software isn't the 
service.  We've got a good server (www.diplom.org).

Showcase related:
	While the showcase has not been as active as it should be, it 
also has not been as dormant as it seems.  I've been working on a suite 
of scripts to generate full showcases from judge output.  As part of this 
undertaking I'm writing a Perl module to parse all manner of judge files, 
including:
	* list output
	* histories
	* results
	* map definitions
this data will be used to fill in standard datastrctures which can be 
read directly or accessed via provided methods.  It will be my goal to 
get this check into the CPAN (big perl library).
	All this work will occur to the great displesure of Manus who is 
a Python fan. 
	Also I will probably be putting up the bulk of the showcase for 
'gauntlet' this week.

Manus,

I've been so busy, I didn't even realize there was a new Pouch issue
available.  Looks like it is chock-full of good stuff.  However, I just
read the article on the new rating system and while I am reluctant to
criticize people who are making an effort to contribute to the hobby, I
feel there are some issues with the proposed system that I must object to.

1) Philosophy: I've always felt that an ELO-like system won't work very
well in Diplomacy.  In chess, it is one on one and a player has no one but
himself to blame if he loses.  In Dip, even the strongest player can be
eliminated quite easily if his opponents gang up on him.  Thus, it seems
unfair to extract a large penalty if those opponents have lower ratings.
Worse, from a practical standpoint a highly-rated player would be pretty
much restricted to gunboat games.  Currently, a player with a strong
reputation can still play in non-gunboat games.  Sure, some players will
try to wipe him out because they fear his rep, but others will want to team
up with him  for the same reason so it all balances out.  Now, players will
have an incentive to destroy a high-rated player, an incentive that has
nothing whatsoever to do with the game itself.  That is bad.

2) Abandonments: I don't really understand the system here, so my comments
are more general.  If I understand it correctly, a player who picks up a
position does not have his rating affected.  That is good and bad.  A
player who picks up a position should never be penalized.  To do so makes
no sense and would offer a strong disincentive to picking up mercy
positions.  But I believe a player should be rewarded if he is able to make
something of a pickup.  Why not?  Especially if he is picking up a position
very early in the game.  Not allowing a player to gain seems to offer a
strong disincentive to picking up positions abandoned in 1902.  Which
brings me to my next point.  As I said, I don't really understand the
formula offered for rating players who abandon, but the author states that
"It is not the place of an ability rating system to hurt the undedicated
however annoying they are but I don't think they can benefit either." which
leads to believe that a player may suffer less from abandoning a position
than playing it out or at least not be any worse off.  Either way, you may
find that players who care about nothing but ratings may tend to abandon at
the end of the first year if things don't go well.  In my opinion, a rating
system should offer incentives to pick up positions and disincentives to
abandon.

3) Press Options: Once again, I don't really understand the math (hey,
college was a long time ago!), but the sense of it seems to be that partial
is more meaningful than broadcast-only which is more meaningful than
no-press with real-time at the bottom of the stack (what about real-time
with press?).  The author does not give any rationale for this decision, so
it is difficult to comment.  I've found all sorts of different press
options to be challenging in different ways, but usually stick to
broadcast-only and no-press due to time constraints.  I don't see why they
should be rated any differently than other games, but if the author
believes they should be, it would seem more logical to have separate rating
lists for different press options.  Mind you, I am not advocating that
approach.  I'd much rather see the press options left out of calculations.
The same goes for time limits (ie., real-time).  If a system does not
reward a player for sheer volume of games played (and it shouldn't), then
what difference does it make how fast a game is played?  As with press
options, it seems to me that it is just a different set of challenges.

4) Short-Center Variants: It is possible that the designers of this system
simply did not think about variants where the winning centers are set very
low, but there does not seem to be any provision for treating them
differently.  It seems to be that a game with the winning centers set to
seven or fourteen, etc, while a perfectly legitimate variant, is
substantially different from a game where a player must capture a majority
of the centers to win.  This may be an unreasonable bias on my part, but I
think it something that should be considered.

5) Simplicity: Nothing profound here, just an observation that EIDRaS is a
very complicated system.  I prefer a simple system where I can easily
figure out how a result will affect my rating.  I suspect many players feel
the same way.

All of which brings me to the rating system that was in effect when the
system crashed.  It was a simple concept.  Each starting player risked one
rating point.  Replacements could gain points, but could never lose them.
The winners got back their ante and divided up the spoils from the losers.
It seemed to me that this system offered proper incentives (good to pick up
positions, no advantage whatsoever to dropping them, and no incentive to go
after a player simply because he is highly rated).  It also could easily be
applied to variants because the more players in a variant, the more rating
points were available.  Best of all, it was very simple.  At the end of the
day, the points gained equalled the points lost (an important modification
from the original YARS system).  And you never had to wonder how a game
would affect your rating.

The only disadvantage to this system that I can think of is that a player
can achieve a high rating by beating up patsies on a regular basis.  I'm
not really sure that this is a  serious problem though.  First of all, I
think strong players want the challenge of playing other strong players.
Secondly if there were enough cripple-shooters to be a problem, it could
easily be remedied by using (or expanding) the ranking system already in
place.  Currently, players self-rate themselves as Novice, Intermediate, or
Expert and games can be restricted to certain levels.  It is not a very
effective system especially since almost everyone starts off at Novice and
never gives another thought to changing it as they improve.  There could be
two approaches here.  Players with more than seven games completed could be
automatically categorized based on where they rank against other players
(top third are Experts, middle third Intermediate, bottom third Novice) or
games could be restricted based on rating (only open to players above zero
or below zero, etc).  It seems to me that overcoming this one problem can
be done without throwing out the baby with the bath water.

Lastly, I am sure this letter sounds very negative and, as I said, I am
reluctant to criticize anyone who is willing to work at improving the
hobby.  So, I do salute the people involved in this effort and appeciate
all the work that has gone into it.  But I really do believe that it is a
step in the wrong direction.

Regards,
Jeff Serandos

Manus, I have launched an EIDRaS web site with a slight update to
the math dealing with abandonners and a hopefully better explanation why
replacements don't score anything. If you get more questions and are feeling
lazy you can direct them to
http://freespace.virgin.net/anthony.nichols/eidras.htm
The first ratings are also up.

 Jeff, in case you are wondering Manus passed your e-mail on to me to
respond.


1) Philosophy: I've always felt that an ELO-like system won't work very
well in Diplomacy.  In chess, it is one on one and a player has no one but
himself to blame if he loses.  In Dip, even the strongest player can be
eliminated quite easily if his opponents gang up on him.  Thus, it seems
unfair to extract a large penalty if those opponents have lower ratings.

 This could be read as a criticism of rating players in general, that
somethings
you lose without deserving to and sometimes you win without deserving
to. If you believe this I suggest you take no note of any ratings. I feel if
there are to be ratings they should at least be meaningful, hence I designed
(with a lot of help) eidras.

Worse, from a practical standpoint a highly-rated player would be pretty
much restricted to gunboat games.  Currently, a player with a strong
reputation can still play in non-gunboat games.  Sure, some players will
try to wipe him out because they fear his rep, but others will want to
team
up with him  for the same reason so it all balances out.  Now, players
will
have an incentive to destroy a high-rated player, an incentive that has
nothing whatsoever to do with the game itself.  That is bad.



What is the incentive to destroy a higher rated player exactly? My guess is
that you think taking the highest rated player out will help your rating
more
than taking out someone else. This is entirely wrong, your rating change
is solely dependent on your score(no of players divided by number of
winners)
and your expected score, which is determined before the game begins.
Who you share a draw with does not affect your rating, this would indeed
be unacceptable. Hence the only incentive to attack the best opponent is
what it has always been, that he represents the greatest threat.

Please check out the new website,
http://freespace.virgin.net/anthony.nichols/DP_eid.html
In my opinion EIDRaS does discourage abandoning but only mildly, it
certainly
offers no incentive. We designed EIDRaS to be an ability rating system and
to rank ability as accurately as possible given limited data. I don't want a
rating
system that rates ability and how many games you can cram in
(like YARS and HOF), nor one that rates ability and how many decent
abandoned
positions you can find and takeover. EIDRaS just rates ability. This is what
an
ability rating system should do. If you want a system to encourage
replacements
then design something yourself.

>> 3) Press Options: Once again, I don't really understand the math (hey,

The K factor is there to determine to what degree the extra information that
game result presents improves the accuracy of that players rating. Different
K values determine how rapidly a player moves from his current rating
estimate to a more reasonable value, so having different Ks does not
penalise no-pressers with lower ratings just require more games to reach an
accurate rating. This represents the fact the players in full press must
devote
more time and effort and hence often get less games in per unit time and
generally full press allows more diplomacy skills to be displayed. One way
of viewing the earlier replacement question is this, acting as replacement
the result does not increase the accuracy of the players rating at all,
because
the strength of the initial position cannot be determined by formulaic means
or
other, hence K=0 for replacements.

 There are surely many areas where more thought on my behalf is required,
the Pouch article was very rushed, in that it come out almost immediately
on the back of initial rating systems discussions on r.g.d. I think, for
similar
arguments to the above, short variants will get smaller K values, also for
tournment games with such scoring systems. For now I am concentrating
on getting full games into the EIDRaS system before dealing with the more
rare games.

>> 5) Simplicity: Nothing profound here, just an observation that EIDRaS is

 Not really it is the simpliest system that accurately rates ability, thats
why we
are using it. Most of the complexity come from abandonments and things
with are in all systems although they may not be described in such detail.

Maybe, but is this good. Understanding the system is but a small step from
playing the system, especially were the system is too simple and hence
flawed.
Not understanding leaves you only able to play the game. Not even I
understand the system well enough to take advantage to enhance ratings.
Remember HOF and to a lesser extent YARS both encouraged playing lots
of games and taking no care of ones that started going badly so you had time
to start more. This was virtually required if you were half decent but
wanted
to get in the top 10 or whatever. All EIDRaS encourages is you take best
care
in every game you start and try to get the best possible result from it.
So even in philosophy EIDRaS encourages good practice.

 OK thats your view, in my opinion the ratings were meaningless because they
confused player ability and number of games entered. As my article says
someone
with a slightly negative rating could be a prolific above average player or
an infrequent
appaling player. I ask simply what is the point of knowing that. There are
differences
between diplomacy and chess, but I think it is illustrative to consider what
rating
systems would look like in chess. Who would be top rated under
HOF?  - The most prolific blitz club player
YARS? - The guy who played a lot, probably against schoolkids he was
teaching the game.
ELO? - Gary Kasparov.

 Now answer me again, want was the point of HOF or YARS when the
best players don't get a look in.

 Cheers,

 Tony Nichols

    I think it should be called "Deep Pouch Thoughts" by Jack Handy.

    "Did you ever open as Turkey with 'F Ank - Con, A Con - Smy,
A Smy - Ank?'   I did, once, but you know, it wasn't a very good opening."

    "Did you ever wonder why instead of always building so many fleets to
clash and bounce in ENG, why don't France and England just take the Chunnel?
Maybe it's because the game is set in 1901, and the Chunnel hasn't been built
yet."

    "Did you ever wonder why Italy never attacks England in 1901?   I always
thought it was because the cooking was so awful over there, but then I
realized that it might be because it would take two years just to get a

I saw the rave review from a player in an ICQ game.  I'm now going to
   a) try to get in one one of these days [hard for me to get a solid
      block of time, though]

Hope to see you aboard soon.

   b) hold you to your pledge to write an article for The Pouch Zine.

I will keep that pledge.....  Now, how to write an article? ;-)

Forgive the megalomania, but I want to make sure that The Pouch becomes
*the* site for ICQ Dip players, just like it is (supposed to be) *the*
site for players in all the other forums.  Let me know how....

That it is.  BTW, our new web site is up. 
http://www.bigfoot.com/~icqdip  We were having problems with IE3 users
getting to the site awhile back and I wonder if that problem is solved,
if not we have a back-up url for them.

How'd you like the story?

Uh, well, I haven't read it yet.  I "b"ounced it over to The Pouch, so I 
no longer have it.  I probably won't read it until I edit the next issue
(coupla weeks) unless I get a surprise few minutes of free time.

As for judge play, I am a big fan of it.  True, I've never really played
PBEM otherwise, but to me, the judges are the way to go.  I think they
take a lot of heat from people who come to them wanting to find something
wrong with them.  Everyone in the postal community, for example, says that
the judges suck because their abandonment rate is so high.  I haven't
subscribed to very many postal 'zines (after all, I'm a PBEM'er!) but I
get them for free, just for being nice I guess :-) and frankly, I think
abandonment in the postal world is as bad or worse.  As for PBEM human vs.
PBEM judge, I've never done human, but even if I had, I would say I like
the judge better.  The judge is ALWAYS there to answer your questions.
The judge doesn't care if you change your orders a jillion times, and will
always politely tell you what they are.  The judge keeps track of forwarding
all your mail correctly.  You don't need to either remember a bunch of e-mail
addresses for the different powers or rely on the human GM to forward
your mail for you when he gets to a terminal.  The judge output feeds into
all the map making programs, so I can see a map onscreen anytime I want,
etc., etc.  IMHO, you just can't beat the judges.  I think they're even
better than FTF (but that's a close call, especially when talking about
FTF at the big conventions like the world championships, etc.)
