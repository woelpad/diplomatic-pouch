    I think it should be called "Deep Pouch Thoughts" by Jack Handy.

    "Did you ever open as Turkey with 'F Ank - Con, A Con - Smy,
A Smy - Ank?'   I did, once, but you know, it wasn't a very good opening."

    "Did you ever wonder why instead of always building so many fleets to
clash and bounce in ENG, why don't France and England just take the Chunnel?
Maybe it's because the game is set in 1901, and the Chunnel hasn't been built
yet."

    "Did you ever wonder why Italy never attacks England in 1901?   I always
thought it was because the cooking was so awful over there, but then I
realized that it might be because it would take two years just to get a
single fleet over to English waters.   And then what would they eat?"
