Manus,

I was recently in a game where two of us were discussing the possibility
of a 2-way draw, so I went to the pouch (of course) to find out about
games that end in a 2-way draw. I found very little.
There were some hints in the stalemate articles about stalemate lines
that include 17 SCs, but none of them said whether the other side was
defensible. That was about it.

I think it's an interesting area (particularly "how do you avoid that
final stab"), possibly worthy of an article. I also feel that I'm not
qualified to write it (I didn't manage to find out what I wanted and
settled for a 3-way. I've also never seen a game that ended in a 2-way),
but perhaps one of your more experienced colleagues is ?

Just a suggestion.

Manus,

I have an idea for the Pouch Zine. I bet there are a lot of people out there who 
have thought about writing an article on something or other, but have decided 
against it because they don't think they can make it long enough to be worth it. 
Therefore, how about :

"Pouch Paragraphs".

The idea is simple. People each write a one-paragraph article, and then they all 
go together to make one item in the main Zine menu. This has two advantages. 
Firstly, you get an extra article for the Pouch every issue. Secondly, I bet 
several people will start writing their "Pouch Paragraph", write two or three 
pages without realising it, and hey presto, you have another complete article.

Howzat ?

David.
