   <a name="intro">Introduction</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Welcome to the eleventh article in my continuing series about the Modern
   variant. In the first article you got an introduction to the modern variant,
   as well as some information on how to get started playing it. In the next six
   articles I discussed the opening strategies for Britain, Egypt, France,
   Germany And Italy. Then, I took a break and conducted a review of those six
   articles, before continuing with Poland, Russia and Spain.
  <p>
   In this article, I examine the position and opening choices of Turkey, the
   bridge between Europe and Asia, and a country which has been a major
   influence in Europe in the past, and could be again. You might be familiar
   with playing Turkey in vanilla dip&#150;a defensive, corner power with
   reasonable prospects in the Balkans, and especially feared when allied with
   Russia to form a 'juggernaut'. In Modern, Turkey is still positioned on the
   SC rich Balkans, but has a more challenging position. Turkey now has two
   neighbours on the Black Sea instead of one, a new neighbour in the Eastern
   Med, occupying the corner instead of Turkey, and the Middle-East has become a
   potential battleground. All these new elements make Turkish position both
   more dangerous and more promising than in vanilla dip, and in my opinion,
   also more challenging and interesting to play.

   Normally, I look at the recently finished modern games, but instead, I will
   point you to the <a href="http://www.dragonfire.net/~Cyberia/modern.htm">Modern
   homepage</a> where you can always find the latest information. Suffice it to
   say that Spain continues its domination of 1998, almost surpassing Ukraine
   overall. Also of note are Chris Fridrich's solo victories as both Britain and
   France, meaning that there now have been victories with all powers in Modern!
  <p>
   Anyhow, on to the article itself. I'll be looking at Turkish 
   <a href="#openstat">openings</a> and <a href="#strategy">strategies</a>, and
   will then, as usual include a section of <a href="#comments">player

    </blockquote>
    <p>
    Turkey moves the Izmir fleet to Anatolia, sending the Ankaran fleet to take
    Greece instead. This move to Anatolia allows a 50/50 defense of Turkey's
    home SCs if Egypt moves to the Eastern Med in the spring of 1995. It also
    allows Turkey to have three fleets on the Eastern Med in the spring of 1996,
    four if the Aegean Sea fleet did not take Greece.
    <p>
     The move to Irak is more offensive, as it allows Turkey to take Saudi
     Arabia in 1995, if Egypt did not move to take it. Moving to Iran allows a
     defensive self-bounce in Adana in the fall though, while still taking an
     SC.

     Named for the founder of modern secular Turkey, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, who
     was also its first president from 1923 until his death in 1938. 
    <p>
     <em>"Mustafa Kemal Ataturk differed from the dictators of his age in two
     significant respects; his foreign policy was based not on expansion but on
     retraction of frontiers; his home policy on the foundation of a political
     system which could survive his own time. It was in this realistic spirit
     that he regenerated his country, transforming the old sprawling Ottoman
     Empire into a compact new Turkish Republic."&#150;A page on Turkish
     history</em>
    <P>
     In Modern, this opening protects Turkey's traditional zones of influence
     (Iran, Bulgaria, Greece, and perhaps Georgia), but without attacking any
     neighbour. It is also able to withstand any northern attack at little cost,
     and a southern move by Egypt to the Mediterranean at the cost of a build or
     two.
    <p>
     <em>"The standard opening. This is best if your not sure what to do and don't
     want to upset anyone else right off."&#150;Robert Shepard</em>

    <p>
     <em>"It's sort of Turkey's answer to Austria's Balkan Gambit in the
     standard game, since three units head that way, leaving the homeland
     slightly exposed.</em>
    <p>
     <em>Since it is impossible for Turkey to keep a determined Egypt out of the
     Eastern Med in the first year, it is best not to try. Instead, keep Ukraine
     out of the Black Sea, thus preventing him from locking Turkey out of the
     Balkans. With the WBS either belonging to Turkey or vacant and a fleet in
     the Aegean, Turkey is virtually guaranteed two Balkan SCs in the first
     year, with a chance for a third if he makes it into the WBS.</em>
    <p>
     <em>Turkey is also guaranteed another SC in Iran. Even if Egypt takes
     Adana or Izmir in the fall, Turkey gets two builds and a fairly advanced
     position in '96. This opening works best given a solid alliance with
     Egypt. In a no-press game, maybe count on Egypt being slightly
     conservative as he searches for an ally. If I were Egypt in a regular
     press game, I wouldn't immediately attack Turkey without the help of
     Ukraine or Russia either."&#150;Mike Morzinski</em>

      <br>
      Army Adana&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Ankara. (Ankaran Variant)</tt>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Barbarossa was a Turkish corsair, who captured Algiers from Spain in the
     16th century, twice defeated the Italian navy, and ravaged the coasts of
     Greece, Italy and Spain. Turkey tries to emulate his success somewhat in
     this opening by moving both of its fleets west fullspeed, towards Greece
     and Italy. If Ukraine attacks though, the north's defense is not neglected,
     especially in the Ankaran variant, which delays taking Iran (until 1996)
     for a very strong northern defense and perhaps a fall shot at Georgia.
    <p>
     The Barbarossa defense assumes an early alliance with Egypt, or at least
     neutrality. The south can be defended, but the idea here is not to mount a
     quick strike to the south.

    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Turkey sends a clear signal to Ukraine that she wants an alliance, helping
     Ukraine into the Eastern Black Sea where they can presumably cooperate to
     take on Russia in Rostov and Georgia. If that is the case, however, then
     perhaps moving Adana to Armenia would be wiser, so perhaps this is just a
     trick to get Ukraine and Russia fighting each other?

     Turkey moves three units to spaces on or adjacent to the Bosphorus, the
     body of water joining the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, thus making sure to
     keep control of it. Bulgaria and Greece are sought, while the army can pick

     <em>"Turkey has so many potential openings, but they boil down to only a

     has to move to WBS, to bounce Ukraine or gain the space (give Georgia to

     the Med. Don't waste time moving to Iran initially. You can easily take
     it later. Move either to Syria, to support an attack on Israel, or to
     Iraq. If Egypt doesn't move to the Red Sea, you can then take Saudi early
     from Iraq. If he does, either deny it to him or move back into
     Iran."&#150;Tom Mowle</em>
    <p>
     <em>"My favorite (for Gunboat). Pretty common. The goal of the opening is
     to protect the major seas: West Black Sea and Eastern Med. For Turkey,
     West Black is more important than East Black. The move to Irak is

    <strong>Double Ottoman (Petar Mimica)</strong>

    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Turkey tries for Bulgaria, Greece, Georgia and Iran. A more defensive
     opening than the Georgian Push, the Double Ottoman does not guarantee
     Georgia, but it allows Turkey to defend Ankara successfully if Georgia was
     taken and Ukraine or Russia opened to the Black Sea. Adana itself can be
     defended if Egypt opened to the Eastern Med. Otherwise Iran can always be
     taken in the fall.

     on Georgia, if Russia moves there in the spring, she will be able to
     retreat to Ankara in the fall. If Egypt supports herself into the Eastern
     Med and then tries for Adana, Turkey is in real trouble and will end up
     with a single build. This opening could work with a bit of luck, but there

     Turkey not only gives Russia Georgia, but also supports her in, sealing an

     distracted, giving Turkey a chance to safely take out Egypt to the
     south. While this opening will only net Turkey two SCs, Greece should still
     be available in 1996. Turkey is vulnerable to an early Ukrainian attack in

     F cai &nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;isr or F cai&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;red (to take Saudi

     Turkey should resist the temptation to take an Egyptian home SC, and try

     Ismet Inonu was the principal lieutenant of Ataturk in the post-World War I

     settlement and established the Turkish Republic in 1923. He was twice Prime
     Minister and later Turkey's second president.
    <p>
     The Inonu Incursion promises to capture both Bulgaria and Greece, while
     defending Turkey's Black Sea coast from Ukraine, or launching a northern
     offensive if the fleet makes it to the WBS. The Baghdad variant also places
     Turkey in a position to take Saudi Arabia, a natural Egyptian SC, if Egypt
     does not move for it immediately, and is therefore more balanced in its
     north-south approach.

     The first Moslem Turkish state was formed by the Karahans from 990 to 1212
     AD (though not in Anatolia). It seems appropriate to name this opening
     after them, since it turns completely away from Egypt, and leaves Turkey
     vulnerable to a stab from her Moslem neighbour. This is not necessarily a
     weak opening, as it can net Turkey four builds, and will work well with an
     Egyptian alliance. The Armenian variant is more popular as it gives Turkey
     a greater say regarding Georgia.

     The Marmara Sea lies near Istanbul, between the Bosporus and the

     supporting Ukraine to the Eastern Black Sea. If Ukraine also moves to
     Donbas, then Rostov can be taken by Ukraine at the same time as Georgia is
     captured by Turkey.
    <p>
     Turkey hedges his bets though, by moving to Greece from Istanbul, and
     moving his fleet up to Istanbul from Izmir. This allows a perfect defense
     against Ukraine should the Ukraine not follow through on spring 1995
     promises. If Ukraine acts according to his word, then the army can move
     north from Greece to Bulgaria, and the Istanbul fleet can take Greece,
     where it will be more useful in an alliance with Ukraine.

     move on to Macedonia the following year to put pressure on Serbia. Georgia
     is also assured with the move to Armenia, and if taken in the spring,
     Turkey can go for four builds by taking Iran in the fall. Of course, this
     all assumes a friendly Egypt that did not open to the Eastern Med.

     is left open, so Ukraine should at least be neutral. As no claim is made on
     Georgia, Russia is likely to take it and therefore establish a relatively
     strong southern presence, one that will probably be a concern to Ukraine.

    <p>
     This is a strange opening. The move to Syria cannot realistically expect to
     take Israel without a simultaneous move to the Eastern Med, and so it's
     only purpose is to pressure Israel and defend Adana. This could both have
     been done from Irak while allowing Turkey to take Iran. The move to the
     Eastern Black Sea is similarly bizarre, leaving Turkey open to an attack
     from the Western Black Sea or even Georgia. It is a surprising move
     however, which could catch the opponent unawares.
    <p>
     At least Turkey opens classically in the west, with both Bulgaria and
     Greece sought, but Istanbul may be a better destination for the fleet to
     give added protection to Istanbul and Bulgaria if needed.

   <a name="strategy">Turkish Strategy</a>
  </h3>
  <p>
   Have you been chosen to play Turkey in a Modern game? Does the position look
   unfamiliar? What should be your policy towards your neighbours? What SCs
   should you try to pick up? What should you consider your natural area of
   influence? I'll take a look at these questions and others below. As usual,
   you can zip back and forth to <a href="#comments">player comments</a> on the
   same subject while you are reading, or just wait until you've finished
   reading my thoughts before reading theirs.
  </p>

  <h4>
   Initial strategy (<a href="#init">see player comments</a>)
  </h4>
  <p>
   With 4 starting units, Turkey has approximately 300 opening moves it can
   make, not counting openings where one unit issues a HOLD or SUPPORT
   order. What's more, there are eight neutral supply centers (and five foreign
   home SCs) her troops can reach in 1995, in various directions, giving Turkey
   ample choice. She must choose carefully however, as her initial choices will
   affect the balance of power in the whole of Eastern Europe, by strengthening
   some of her four neighbours, and weakening others.
  <p>
   The best example of this is probably the decision whether or not to take 
   <a href="#georgia">Georgia</a> in 1995. Georgia is equally contested by
   Russia's Rostov fleet, but Turkey can make sure to capture it by moving the
   Adana army to Armenia and then supporting herself in. Taking it increases
   Turkish security, as Georgia borders Ankara, a Turkish home SC. This also
   severely weakens Russia's southern presence, making it unlikely that Russia
   will be a bother to Turkey in the area, but also making it more likely for
   her to lose Rostov. This therefore strengthens the Ukraine, a power that is
   more of a threat to Turkey because its northern options are limited by its
   lack of an Atlantic port. If Turkey does not take Georgia, however, she will
   gain Russia's initial goodwill. Also, by giving her a strong southern
   presence, Russia will likely be very tempted to harass Ukraine, giving Turkey
   a few years of peace to her north if she so desires, and avoiding the deadly
   U/R alliance. Georgia can always be negotiated back from Russia at a later
   point, or taken by force if it seems that Russia is going to fall.
  <p>
   If Turkey decides not to contest Georgia, she then has the possibility of
   using her Ankaran fleet in the <a href="#black">Black Sea</a> or 
   <a href="#balkan">Balkans</a> theaters. A Ukrainian fleet in the Western
   Black Sea is very damaging for Turkey, because it borders two home SCs as
   well as Bulgaria, a natural Turkish neutral. A Turkish fleet in the WBS is
   similarly damaging to Ukraine. Turkey therefore has the options of arranging
   a bounce in the WBS or sneaking in for a superior advanced position
   vis-&agrave;-vis the Ukraine and a shot at Rumania. The last option is to
   move to Istanbul, from where the fleet can support or take Bulgaria or
   Greece, a good, balanced position. In that case, it is a good idea to
   consider HOLDing the army in Adana in the spring. If the Ukraine opens to the
   Western Black Sea, Turkey will better be able to defend Ankara&#150;otherwise
   Iran is still there for the taking.
  <p>
   Bulgaria, Greece, Rumania&#150;the Balkans. What is the best strategy in the
   area? Both Bulgaria and Greece are natural Turkish SCs, bordering on
   Istanbul. This means that Turkey can get them virtually unchallenged in 1995,
   but also that she can try for something else instead and probably still get
   them in 1996. The other SCs Turkey can reach in 1995 are Serbia and
   Rumania. The first is usually taken by an Italian fleet (though an Italian
   army could be convoyed there), but Italy can easily be prevented from taking
   it. It can even be captured if Ukraine helps. Turkey should carefully weigh
   the consequences of such an action though. Keeping Italy out though will
   likely be a temporary affair is Turkey is acting alone, as Italy will get
   Croatia and will be able to support herself into Serbia in the spring of
   1996. Italy is also a power that borders both the Ukraine and Egypt, and can
   help or hinder Turkey in both areas. A solid alliance with Egypt or Ukraine
   is therefore usually a prerequisite for such an early Turkish move on Serbia,
   otherwise living with a non-threatening Italian fleet in Serbia is probably
   fine for Turkey.
  <p>
   Rumania is another matter though. If by some lucky circumstances Turkey finds
   herself with a fleet in the Western Black Sea in the fall of 1995, as well as
   an army in Bulgaria, then it is definitely possible to try taking
   Rumania. Ukraine will then have to choose between defending its home SCs and
   taking Hungary, or defending Rumania. In any case, Ukraine will be weakened,
   and Italy could be tempted to take Hungary in 1996 and Russia to move in from
   the north.
  <p>
   More likely, Turkey will just set her sights on Bulgaria and Greece. The
   question is then how to take them. Is the army in Istanbul better sent to
   Bulgaria, or Greece? It seems that the consensus among players (from looking
   at the openings that they used) is to open to Bulgaria, and take Greece with
   either of the two fleets. The reason is probably not that Turkey is thinking
   of moving to Serbia, but rather that moving against Egypt in the south will
   require many Mediterranean fleets, and putting one in Greece is strategically
   sound. While this is true, a fleet in Greece is also of little use in the
   Balkans, as it can neither support Bulgaria, nor move to Macedonia, nor even
   support actions into the Western Black Sea. Therefore, if the Balkans are the
   goal, and not Egypt, moving the army to Greece and the fleet to Bulgaria
   (with support if necessary) seems like the correct thing to do.
  <p>
   Should the Balkans be the goal, however? What of the
   <a name="#med">Mediterranean</a> and the <a name="#middle">Middle-East</a>?
   Turkey is in a difficult position, because Egypt can support himself into the
   Eastern Med in the spring of 1995, threatening two Turkish home SCs. If Egypt
   does this though, it means that he is giving up Saudi Arabia in 1995, and
   that Turkey can take it for herself. This flanking attack is the main reason
   for opening to Irak from Adana. If Saudi Arabia will not be free, Turkey can
   always bounce Egypt there or take Iran instead. Similarly, Israel can also be
   threatened by Turkey in 1995 with an opening to Syria, but this seems like an
   inferior move unless accompanied by a move to the Eastern Med. This is
   because it is very unlikely that Egypt will not take Israel, and this would
   leave Turkey with a unit that cannot take an SC, and Turkey needs all the
   builds it can get in 1995.
  <p>
   What of the fleet in Izmir? An arranged bounce in the Eastern Med is ideal
   for Turkey. Not only does it provide excellent defense for Turkey, but it
   also denies Egypt a build while being 'friendly'. This may not be evident at
   first, but look at Egypt's position, and you will see that there is no
   way. If an arranged bounce is not possible, then the choices are moving
   towards Greece (via Istanbul or the Aegean), leaving the Med for Bulgaria
   (via Istanbul) and a northwards oriented strategy, or moving to Adana. The
   last move is seldom used, but very interesting as it allows Turkey to have a
   50/50 chance of defending her two southern ports even if Egypt opens to the
   Eastern Med. What is more, it allows Turkey to have three fleets on the
   Eastern Med in the spring of 1996 after building fleets in both Izmir and
   Adana.
  </p>

  <h4>
   Midgame and Endgame
  </h4>
  <p>
   If Turkey survives the opening year unattacked, she will be in a good
   position. The same will happen if only Egypt attacks and Ukraine is
   distracted by a hopefully long war against Russia or Poland. Turkey's main
   consideration is then what to do about <a href="#egypt">Egypt</a>. Don't let
   it be said that an E/T alliance is not possible. There have been two 3-way
   draws including both powers, and Theo Kermanidis even proposed that such an
   alliance is a SUPER-ALLIANCE (!!! link to that article, check author name
   !!!). If done correctly it will avoid the <a href="#bottle">bottlenecks</a>
   that Turkey and Egypt face&#150;a naval blockade around Sicily, or an wall of
   iron somewhere in central Europe.
  <p>
   In most cases, Egypt and Turkey will come to blows. You therefore have to
   decide whether to attack right away, or to ally with Egypt and count on
   stabbing her before she stabs you. Egypt is a very tough nut to crack, and it
   might actually be faster to destroy him through a stab when he is busy
   fighting Italy or Spain than with an early frontal assault. Turkey has more
   avenues of expansion than Egypt, and so the chances are that there will be a
   time when Turkey gets builds and Egypt does not. If you do choose to ally,
   try to negotiate a good deal for yourself in the Eastern Med&#150;either
   keeping it empty, or putting your own fleet there to convoy his armies. If
   not possible, then make a stab less attractive by keeping an army or fleet
   somewhere on your southern coast, so that Egypt cannot be sure a stab will
   work. And whatever you do, do not allow an Egyptian fleet into the Aegean!
  <p>
   Once Egypt is gone, then what? The main objectives for Turkey should be to
   get into the Western Med or to capture all Black Sea ports and move into
   Russia and central Europe. Either way, control of the Balkans is an important
   piece of the puzzle. Northern attacks can really be helped by sending an
   Iranian army north to Kazakhstan and then on to the Volga. A convoy to Donbas
   is likewise quick and effective, as it is usually not defended and borders 3
   SCs as well as the Volga. Moving west, an army in Western Sahara is very
   useful in cutting Algerian fleet supports or moving fleets along the coast,
   and a convoy to Apulia is likewise very damaging to Italy.
  <p>
   Both of these tasks are helped however if Ukraine (north) and Italy (west)
   are not around anymore, as it is more likely that other powers will be
   distracted by closer neighbours than you. One thing to remember though, is
   that any <a href="#north">northern coastal SC</a> - those bordering the
   Baltic or Arctic Seas - will be very difficult for Turkey to hold. Not being
   able to immediately access the <a href="#caspian">Caspian</a> or 
   <a href="#red">Arabian Seas</a> is not nearly as much of a concern. If
   Turkey can move quickly up north at the end of the game though and overcome a
   divided opposition and win, then by all means do so. However moving so far
   north in the midgame is often a mistake, as Turkey will not be able to hold
   back a determined counter-attack by Britain or Germany. Better to strive to
   reach Spain then, for the last SCs needed to take the victory.
  </p>

  <h4>
   Relationship with Other Powers
  </h4>
  <p>
   Turkey's relationship with <a href="#egypt">Egypt</a> has already been
   covered to some extent above. To working together for the short or long term
   is possible and could give advantages to both, by letting them get through
   bottlenecks in the Med, or hitting other opponents when they are
   unprepared. However, the two will most likely come to blows, and such a
   battle will normally be a long, protracted affair, which could allow powers
   in other areas of the board to grow more quickly.
  <p>
   <a href="#ukraine">The Ukraine</a> is just as close to Turkey as Egypt is,
   but unlike Egypt, usually has more pressing problems to deal with than
   Turkey. This means that an early attack will likely be easy, but also that
   Turkey can put off the Ukrainian question to later. A U/T alliance can work
   quite well, at least early on, as both can naturally split the board
   north/south, with the Black Sea as a DMZ between the two. Unfortunately,
   Ukraine might realize at some point that it wont be able to hold on to
   northern coastal SCs, just as Turkey could not, and decide to move south
   against Turkey instead. How soon this happens, if at all, depends on the
   Ukrainian player, and if there is a larger threat to the west that will keep
   the U/T alliance together. The important thing is to make sure that Ukraine
   does not attack Turkey early in the game, especially if allied with Russia,
   or worse, Egypt.
  <p>
   A power in a similar position as Ukraine with regards to Turkey is 
   <a href="#russia">Russia</a>. In some ways however, Russia makes a better
   ally than Ukraine. Russia is less likely to be a threat on the Black Sea (and
   might even give Rostov away), and might allow Turkey to control more if not
   all of the Balkans and some of Ukraine. Most importantly, Russia can build
   fleets in the north. This means that Russia, unlike Ukraine, will not
   necessarily be blocked up north and forced to move south against Turkey to
   continue to grow. This doesn't mean that he won't do so though, and a big
   Russia can be very dangerous and grow very rapidly. Therefore, if Turkey
   wants a safe northern ally, <a href="#poland">Poland</a> may be the best
   choice. However, Poland is more of a midgame ally, as he cannot help Turkey
   too much at the start, especially against Ukraine. Better to first ally with
   Poland and one of the two other Slavic powers to take the other out before
   turning together on the other.
  <p>
   To the west, the most important power for Turkey is 
   <a href="#italy">Italy</a>. Together, they are the only neighbours Egypt has,
   and therefore one of them will be at war with Egypt. It almost seems natural
   to ally against Egypt. Italy can easily take Libya from Egypt and provide
   naval help to Turkey. However, if actively helping, he will be likely to want
   a piece of Egypt, and this will give Turkey some security problems. If Italy
   moves west instead, then Turkey's war against Egypt will be long and painful,
   while Italy will possibly grow larger faster, and pose a long-term security
   threat as well. To complicate matters further, Italy will also definitely be
   eyeing the whole of the Balkans, just like Turkey and Ukraine, and could help
   or hinder Turkey there as well. Mutual defense is possible, but active
   cooperation unlikely. There is therefore no hard and fast rule on how to
   handle Italy, but staying on good terms early on is usually beneficial for
   both Italy and Turkey.
  <p>
   When having midgame problems with Italy though, Turkey will hopefully be able
   to turn to <a href="#spain">Spain</a>. Each controlling a corner, they can
   then attack Italy from both sides and crush him together. Luckily, this
   usually means total control of the Balkans for Turkey. This is not enough for
   a win however, so Turkey should probably strive to get a part of Italy to be
   in a position to move beyond Sicily if she gets a chance.
  <p>
   What of the <a href="#bfg">remaining powers</a>? Turkey will have little
   contact and influence with them in the early game. Britain often attacks
   Russia in the north however, which can both help or hinder Turkey. Germany
   and France likewise can attack Italy early on by land, probably making it an
   also-ran and improving Turkish (and Ukrainian) chances in the
   Balkans. Finally, France and Britain can attack Italy by sea later in the
   game, if Spain is not around.
  </p>

  <h4>
   Turkey in General 
  </h4>
  <p>
   Turkey is a power with enormous potential. It is the only power with four
   ports, and sits beside a host of neutral centers. After getting Iran, it will
   have reached the side of the board, which some powers like Germany and France
   would very much like to do. It is even reasonably close to a corner and a
   host of stalemate lines. Turkey also has a good number of directions to move
   in, and her foes won't necessarily know what to expect. The only thing that
   Turkey has to do is negotiate with its four neighbours, some more
   intransigent than others, and either come to a diplomatic solution or take
   them out militarily. But then again, that is what Diplomacy is all about

   <em>"Turkey needs to hinder Italian growth in the Balkans while the Egyptian
   problem is resolved, trying to assure the Italy does not grow too large for
   Turkey to confront in the Mid-game. A Ukrainian ally can be most useful in
   this regard as you help each other to gains that are important more for what
   they deny to Italy than for what they reap you, the Turkish
   player."&#150;Andrew F. Heil</em>
  <p>
   <em>"Also important to consider is if both Italy and yourself destroy Egypt,
   where will both your forces go afterwards? You must either fight each other
   or both completely turn your momentum around, and this creates obvious
   difficulty."&#150;Robert Shepard</em>

   <a name="russia">Comment on Turkey's relationship with Russia:</a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   <em>"I think they are natural allies. If they can break out, they can emulate
   the classic Juggernaut. Neither has much to gain from attacking each other
   early, but all to gain from moving west in tandem. They cannot attack each
   other very easily, and both need allies.</em>
  <p>
   <em>You don't want a Russian buildup in the South though. Initially, you
   might as well give up Georgia. Turkey has plenty of other early targets and
   nothing builds friendship like conceding a center. One way to do this is for
   Russia to block a Ukrainian move to the EBS in the spring, then move to
   Georgia in the fall. Later, however, it would be ideal if Russia could be
   convinced to give up Rostov and Georgia. There is an easy mutual land
   stalemate line (Kaz-Vol-Don v. Irn-Cau-Ros) there. If you then help Russia
   destroy Ukraine, you can clear the Black Sea of fleets."&#150;Tom Mowle</em>
  <p>
   <em>"T/R can be allies against Ukraine. They can put both fleets offshore
   pretty quickly, and press on both fronts. It's not bad."&#150;Rick
   Desper</em>
  <p>
   <em>"I can see two radically distinct choices: either ally with Russia
   against Ukraine, or ally with Ukraine against Russia. I would prefer the
   first option, as you would be able to stab in southern Russia right
   after. This would net you GEO and ROS quite quickly, even more if you
   convoyed a few armies through the Black Sea to seize Ukrainian centers.</em>
  <p>
   <em>I think I would give GEO to Russia anyway, in the beginning, in exchange
   for further supports in the Black Sea, and provided he agrees not to build
   fleets in Rostov (which should seem logical to him). These centers (GEO/ROS)
   should not be very well defended afterwards, so they can be taken quite
   easily."&#150;William Attia</em>
  <p>
   <em>"The RT would be a good combination as well, although there wouldn't be a
   lot of interaction early in the game since Russia will likely be more
   concerned with the Northern end of her front."&#150;Mike Morzinski</em>
  <p>
   <em>"Russia will almost always demand Georgia to strengthen her southern
   presence, especially since you have all those other neutral supply centers
   around you. Russia can easily make a good argument for it, and yet you
   certainly don't want a foreign fleet right next to your homeland. So the
   dilemma is who to trust. If Russia will let you have Georgia, take it and
   promise him anything to help fight Ukraine. On the other hand, an opening of
   F Ankara&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Georgia and A Adana&nbsp;-&gt;&nbsp;Armenia will
   bounce the Russians the first turn, you can support yourself in the next, and
   pick up Iran the next year. Ultimately your negotiations will decide, but it
   is a problem that must be dealt with right away, otherwise a Russian -
   Ukraine alliance might develop, and that is the worst possible
   scenario."&#150;Robert Shepard</em>

   <a name="poland">Comment on Turkey's relationship with Poland:</a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   <em>"Poland makes a great ally. Turkey and Poland can help each other take
   out Russia and Ukraine. They should ally if both survive the early
   years. Neither can do much to help the other if in trouble. Things could get
   testy in the Balkans, but that is about it. They should exchange information,
   manipulate Russia and Ukraine, and kill both if possible. But Ukraine should
   be the first target, if possible."&#150;Tom Mowle</em>
  <p>
   <em>"Turkey should make sure that Poland goes East (this should not be
   tough). If Poland attacks Ukraine, this can be very good for Turkey. A P/U
   alliance is much less good for Turkey."&#150;Rick Desper</em>
  <p>
   <em>"Basically, a TP long-term alliance should work against Russia and
   Ukraine. It could result from Ukraine being allied with both T and P, and
   then being stabbed by both simultaneously. However, their fleets cannot help
   each other, as they can't expect to reach the Atlantic soon."&#150;William
   Attia</em>

   <a name="spain">Comment on Turkey's relationship with Spain:</a>
  </h4>
  <p>
   <em>"Another good ally. Together they could dominate the Med, splitting the
   basin and Italy, although like with Poland they can't help each other
   much. The fate of Libya and Venice are important. You don't want Spanish
   fleets past Sicily, but you may need Spanish help to take out
   Egypt. Together, strive to keep Egypt and Italy from getting too strong, too
   fast. Exchange information."&#150;Tom Mowle</em>
  <p>
   <em>"If Turkey can get Spain to push armies through Africa, that is
   great. Otherwise, there's not much to say."&#150;Rick Desper</em>
  <p>
   <em>"Spain and Turkey could share the domination of the Med, with a boundary
   like TYS/MAL. It assumes that Turkey gets Egypt, the Middle-East, most of the
   Balkans, Libya and part of Italy, while Spain probably controls the south of
   France, Morocco and Tunisia, and most of Italy.</em>
  <p>
   <em>Spain should be prevented from sending too many fleets eastwards. A
   northern naval threat can be useful (either B or G, generally). Anyway, I
   don't think Turkey can reach the Spanish coasts, without even speaking of the
   Atlantic."&#150;William Attia</em>

   <a name="bfg">Comment on Turkey's relationship with Germany, France and

  </h4>
  <p>
   <em>"Just stay friendly with everyone, and if there is going to be pressure,
   throw it at Italy. Long-term, any of them will work as an ally. Short-term,
   it doesn't much matter. You don't need early domination by any of them,
   especially penetration into the Balkans or past Sicily. Exchange
   information. France is probably the most likely to cause trouble, because it
   has access both to the Med and the Balkans."&#150;Tom Mowle</em>
  <p>
   <em>"Typically, this is only of marginal importance."&#150;Rick Desper</em>
  <p>
   <em>"Apart from information exchange, I can't see how they could be
   useful. France is usually a weak naval power in the Med, but could possibly
   fulfill the Spanish role against Italy if Spain is out (probably with
   Britain's help). Germany could help to make some decisions in the western
   Balkans. It can play the same role as Poland, where a Germany/Turkey boundary
   can run through the northern Balkans and Russia, if P, R and U are out. Why
   not? Britain, as France, can be a naval power in the Med, strong enough to
   distract Italy in some rare cases. It could also help Turkey to finish Poland
   and/or Russia (getting the coastal centers, while Turkey gets the inland
   ones)."&#150;William Attia</em>
