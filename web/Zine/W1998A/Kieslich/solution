P.S.
Technically speaking, and army can travel from any coastal province to any
other coastal province in 6 months, which would imply the following matrix
of times:
                   L  P  B  R  V  C  S
London             X  3  3  1  2  1  1		
Paris              3  X  3  2  3  2  2 
Berlin             3  3  X  2  3  2  1
Rome               1  2  2  X  2  1  1
Vienna             2  3  3  2  X  2  2
Constantinople     1  2  2  1  2  X  1
St. Petersburg     1  2  1  1  2  1  X

Therefore at least 5 of the spies were taking the scenic route, which makes
the puzzle insoluble.

I actually found the easiest way to do this was to make a grid
like Brian suggested, but fill in the blanks with the number
of days it would take to get from each capitol to every other
one.  Then, knowing that I needed 2 threes, 2 fours, and 1 each
five, six, and seven, only one solution was possible.

On Wednesday , Germany spied on Vienna and Austria spied on Rome.
On Thursday, England spied on Moscow, and Russia spied on London.
On Friday, Italy spied on Paris
On Saturday, Turkey spied on Germany
On Sunday, France spied on Ankara

'Twas much fun, Thanks!

Manus,

Well color me embarrassed.  I guess that makes a difference.

How about:
Wed:   Germany - St. Petersburg & Italy - Vienna
Thurs: England - Berlin & Russia - Ankara
Fri:   France - Rome
Sat:   Austria - London
Sun:   Turkey - Paris

Thanks for pointing out my error.

Derrick
