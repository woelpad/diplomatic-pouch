Solution to The Cultural Exchange Puzzle

"Elementary, Watson," was Holmes' reply when I asked him how he could possibly
have ascertained so much about the game position from
<a href=/Zine/F1998M/Holmes/shift.html>The Cultural Exchange Puzzle</a>
that his brother Mycroft and I had presented to him.
<P align=justify>
"I will not bore you with the details, which surely you can deduce for
yourself, Watson, but the solution begins to make itself apparent when
one considers how any non-Russian power could possibly position two
fleets in St. Petersburg and Sevastopol within the first seven turns of the
game.
<p align=justify>
"As our mutual friend Rick Desper remarked after I left you
(for I was indeed rather amused by the position, and I presented it to him
for his pleasure),
a simple glance at the board is sufficient to determine that the only power
with the possibility to move fleets into both of the two Russian ports in
the first seven turns is Italy.
We could quibble about the fleet landing on the north coast
of St. Petersburg instead of the south, but your information stated only
that the units obtained positions in the same <i>centres</i>, and obviously
it is impossible for Italy to reach the south coast of St. Petersburg in
time.  Only the Atlantic powers can do so, and as we have already
asserted, they are ruled out by their distance to Sevastopol.
<i>Ergo</i>, Italy must have sent a fleet to the north coast of St. Petersburg, and
thus must have been played from the beginning of the game (in your game that
was so riddled with absentee powers).  Further, he must obtain a build to
enable him
to maintain four units.  The moves of the Italian armies to Warsaw and
Moscow are obviously possible in the time allotted.
<p align=justify>
"Since Russia is being occupied by Italian units, Russia is certainly one of
the powers shuffling to occupy different foreign home centres, and we know
that while doing so, she must lose
a unit.  Our attention now turns to the possible final positions for the Russian
units.  The difficulty here is the fact that so many powers were unplayed,
so the destination for the Russian units must be a power to whom travel is
possible without undue interference from the units in civil disorder.
<p align=justify>
"Equally important, we must keep in mind that the units originally at the
destination of the Russian units must shuffle into other home centres as well,
so a considerably wide travel path would seem to be necessary.
<p align=justify>
"Compounding this is the fact that wherever <i>this</i> power's units are going,
the units originally there must <i>also</i> be moving to reshuffle.  We know
that one power is moving to Italy, and given the need to avoid territory in
civil disorder as much as possible, we can further conclude that at least one
of the powers must avoid moving through the same corridor as the other two or
three.
<p align=justify>
"This leads us to consider, for their proximity, Austria or France as owning
the units which move to Italy.
<!--  However, we can eliminate France right away,
as the fleet in Brest cannot reach Naples without blocking the necessary
progress of the Naples fleet in its journey towards St. Petersburg.
<p align=justify>
I had sat quietly this whole time, listening patiently to Holmes' logic
(although I did have one question I was holding in reserve), but at this point
I felt it necessary to inquire of him:  "But Holmes, why must the Brest
fleet be moved to Naples?  It seems to me that the French could engineer a
build, establish a new fleet at Marseilles, and sail to Naples without
interfering with the Italian's voyage."
<p align=justify>
"The problem with that, Watson, is the number of absent players in your
game.  The Brest fleet simply cannot be removed from the board
in the timeframe allotted with so many powers rendered immobile.
-->
<p align=justify>
"As a matter of fact, Watson, I am very near the end of my explanation.
It remains only to conclude from the ample evidence that your Russian units
moved to France, the French to Austria, and the Austrians to Italy, from
whence, of course, went the units that took possession of your own
home centres.
If you'll step to the Diplomacy table here, I will show you how the moves
in your game must have transpired."
<p align=justify>
With that, Holmes quickly set up the board and took me through the
moves of the game, season by season.

Needless to say, Holmes was entirely correct.  However, I had one
more question, which I was sure would trip him up.  "Holmes," I
began, "while you reached the correct conclusion, it seems to me you
started your explanation assuming more information than I had
initially given you."
<p align=justify>
"Indeed, Watson?  Have I?  How so?"
<p align=justify>
"At the bar in the Calhamer Club, Holmes, I am positive that the identities
of all four shuffling powers were not disclosed to you.  But you began
your explanation by determining which power could shuffle into the Russian
centres.  You were obviously using the fact that I later disclosed to you
that I had played Russia.  Without that knowledge, it seems your
explanation proceeds from an unmerited assumption.  Had I not told you
that I had played Russia and lost my two ports, you could not have solved
the puzzle."
<p align=justify>
"And yet I did, Watson.  And, if you'll recall, so did my brother Mycroft.
Your disclosure that you played Russia informed me of nothing at all save that
fact.  Already I knew that <i>someone</i> had played Russia; this follows
just from the information you had presented.  For you see, Watson, the
rearrangement we've been discussing is the only possible one that allows
four powers to
reposition themselves under the constraints you described to me.  It took me
but a mere second in the bar
to eliminate all other possibilities than that the four powers in question
were Italy, Russia, France, and Austria."
<p align=justify>
With that, Holmes excused himself to tend to his botanical pursuits, and
I was left, once more, in awe of the great intellect with which I shared
my apartment.
