When Holmes returned from ensuring Lord Fortescue was safely in his hansom
cab, I was still staring at the ceiling trying to puzzle whether one of
the seven Diplomacy powers could engineer a capture of all 22 home centres
while abiding both by the in-force treaty protecting the
<a href=/Zine/S1998R/Holmes/hogman.html>Confederation of Neutral States</a>
and (unilaterally if need be) by the pending treaty requiring all units to
occupy home supply centres at the end of each year.
<P align=justify>
Holmes, seeing that I was quite tired and yet unable to turn in before having
decided the question, came to my aid.
<p align=justify>
"The Foreign Secretary asked me to relay to you his apologies for the swiftness
of his departure, but you see, Watson, extraordinary circumstances called him
away."
<p align=justify>
"Circumstances attending to the problem you have set me?" I asked.
<p align=justify>
"Indeed so, Watson, indeed so."  Holmes moved to the bar and poured himself
a half-snifter of cognac before continuing.  "I had only just finished explaining
that the feat under discussion could indeed be accomplished by one and only one
of the seven Great Powers, when a message arrived by page for Lord Fortescue.
The page had only just left us when you returned from your outing and joined
our discussion.  While you mused, lost in thought and in apparent study of the
ceiling-paper, our friend took the opportunity to open the message.  It was
sent from one of his fellows, Samuel Meyer, at the Foreign Office, and the
message included confirmation that
the very power I had mentioned to Fortescue was quite possibly contemplating the
nefarious deed under discussion.  You certainly understand now why he was
quick to his hat and coat."
<p align=justify>
"That I understand, Holmes, but you must tell me which power it is that may be
considering the grand plan of attack!  I have gone through each of the powers
in my mind and each seems to have some weakness at the game's beginning which
makes it impossible to achieve the feat."
<p align=justify>
Holmes smiled but did not answer, so I continued.  "As I was saying, Holmes,
for a power to reach a size of 22 centres by the end of 1903, the power must
double its size the first year, and by the terms of the treaty, all new growth
must come at the expense of another player -- no neutrals may be taken.
Turkey can capture only Sevastopol, and England only Brest, so those powers
are ruled out.  Similarly, the Kiel fleet cannot reach a foreign home centre
in 1901, nor yet the Neopolitan fleet or the St. Petersburg fleet.  Only Austria
and France may take possession of a foreign centre with every one of their
initial units, but I cannot for the life of me see how either could achieve
twenty-two centres by the end of 1903.
Enlighten me, if you don't mind, Holmes," I pleaded, "for I do not see what
mistakes I could have made."
<p align=justify>
"Certainly, Watson.
<i>One</i> mistake you made was in claiming that England can
take only one home centre from another power in 1901.  This is patently
untrue, as I'm sure you can see.  In addition to Brest, England is also
able to capture Kiel in 1901."  Holmes smiled then, and
added: "This, of course, has no bearing whatsoever on the problem at hand,
though.  Your more pertinent error lies elsewhere."
<!--
<p align=justify>
"Yes, other than this, you have made only one incorrect observation, Watson,
but it is causing you no end of trouble."
-->
<p align=justify>
"Pray continue, Holmes, I am tired as a dog and must know my fallacy."
Holmes thereupon took pity on me and allowed my tortured thinking to end.
<p align=justify>
"Quite right, then, Watson, I realize that your labours of the day have
taken much from you, since simple mathematics is all that is necessary
to determine which of the seven powers can realistically consider the
achievement.  Note that all the powers with three home centres can take
only six units into 1902, and (although they may own as many as 12 centres)
only nine units into 1903.  Which means, Watson, that even if all that
power's units were successful in gaining a new centre, the power would
end 1903 with only twenty-one centres, one short of the requirement.
Therefore, if any power can do it, that power must be Russia."
<p align=justify>
"But Holmes, am I mistaken in observing that the St. Petersburg fleet
cannot gain a new centre in 1901?"
<p align=justify>
"You are not, Watson, which brings us to the one flaw in your reasoning.
Specifically, you are mistaken that the power must double its size in the
first year.  Russia may gain three centres in 1901, to grow to a size of
seven, which, coupled with the ability to build four units, puts the total
of 22 centres by 1903 in reach."
<p align=justify>
"I follow you, Holmes, but I still do not think the feat possible.  Yes,
Russia begins with four, and if his three southern units gain new centres
in 1901, he will reach a size of seven units at the end of the first
year.  But when he repeats the feat in 1902, he is yet only able to build
three more units (owing to the fact that St. Petersburg is ever to be
covered by its original unit), leaving him with ten to take into 1903.
Even if all
of these take a new centre, that is only twenty, not twenty-two."
<p align=justify>
"Watson, you jump to entirely too many conclusions.  And in your fatigue,
you have supply centre count and unit count confused.  Firstly, there is nothing
which forbids the Russian from building an army in St. Petersburg
at the end of 1902."
<p align=justify>
"But surely, Holmes, there is!  I have pointed out to you that the
St. Petersburg fleet has no chance of ending a year in any home centre
save St. Petersburg itself, and surely that precludes building in
that centre in every year."
<p align=justify>
"Here Watson, come sit at the board, and I will show you how it is done.
Do not feel badly, for apparently the puzzle has left the best men at the
F.O. at a loss as well."  Thereupon, with a great smile on his face,
Holmes patiently arranged the units on the Diplomacy board and began
to move them thusly.

"Ah!" I exclaimed.  "Of course!  The useless fleet can be taken off the board
by a successful attack made on it in 1902!  Holmes, you are indeed astute!"
<p align=justify>
Still, I sat staring at the board.  "Holmes, while I acknowledge that it can be done, yet
am I astonished that it can be done with only nine units on the board.  More
puzzling to me is why Russia can do it with only nine units, but no other power
could.  I thought we had established that the greatest number of units a non-Russian
power could bring into 1903 was nine, which is as many as your Russian uses.  And
yet we said that this very fact eliminated the other powers from eligibility.
Can you explain this?"
<p align=justify>
"Elementary, my dear Watson.  Note that a non-Russian power can bring ownership
of twelve centres into 1903.  With the maximum of nine units to take new centres,
this means only twenty-one can be obtained by the end of 1903.  But Russia, if
playing in 1903 with nine units (as was effectively done in my illustration) can
own as many as sixteen centres without the restrictions placed by the
treaties, and as many as fourteen with the restrictions.  Twenty-two is most
definitely reachable, as I have shown."
<p align=justify>
I congratulated Holmes and headed straight for bed, silently hoping that the
great detective would never again propose a problem to me while I am in such a great
state of fatigue.
<p align=justify>
Needless to say, the rumour that Russia would attempt to control all home
centres within a three year timespan proved to be unfounded.  Undoubtedly it
was started by a Russian nationalist who wished to exhibit his pride at being
the only power that could possibly perform the feat.  However, as in all cases
of international affairs, the feat may only be accomplished with the cooperation of the
community of nations, and the kind of suicidal cooperation required to make this
particular feat a reality was certainly out of the question.
