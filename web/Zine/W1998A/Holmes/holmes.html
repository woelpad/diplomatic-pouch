   The Case of the Absent Professor
  </h2>
  <hr>
  <p align=justify>
   

	I had just seen a messenger away from Baker Street with my texts recording
	<a href=confed.html>the solution to The Strange Case of
	the Confederation of Neutral States</a> and 
	<a href=culture.html>the solution to The Cultural Exchange Puzzle</a>,
	when Holmes admitted to a surprise that, despite all my writings
	concerning his Diplomacy-related adventures, I had yet to devote ink to
	our very first encounter with Professor Moriarty.
  <p align="justify">
   I admit that it had completely left my mind, but my friend's
   recollection brought the episode to the forefront of my own memory, and I
   decided to record it at once.
  <p align="justify">

   Not many of my readers are aware of the fact that I had the
   misfortune to become acquainted with Moriarty before my friend Holmes did
   so, and that this meeting took place
   at the Calhamer Club. The man I would later
   come to regard as the most dastardly of villians entered
   the club one afternoon and registered for membership as a complete stranger,
   and he and I faced each other over the board that very evening.
   <P align=justify>
   I am not certain whether at that stage Holmes had heard tell of the
   Professor and his scheming and cunning ways and his complete lack of
   decency, but Moriarty showed me those very traits that night.
  <p align="justify">
   I had had a very successful evening. I had allied with Rev. Codlington, and
   together we had swept the board until only a five centre Moriarty remained
   against us, with each of the other four powers having been completely
   eliminated.
   My fourteen units gave me an
   edge on the reverend's smaller forces (though he had more than one army
   himself), and, although
   we had respected each other's centres throughout the game, my mind now turned
   to the possibility of a winning stab.
  <p align="justify">
   At this point, like the cad we now know him to be, Moriarty abruptly took
   his coat and left. Club rules state that his abandoned pieces go into civil
   disorder, so Cuthbert and I agreed to race to eighteen centres.
After several fruitless years, we found that we could neither hurt one
another nor eliminate Moriarty by working separately, so we decided to 
cooperate
   for a two-way draw.
This proved impossible, so on losing the toss of a coin Codlington 
agreed to assist me to a solo win. But even <i>this</i> proved impossible,
and finally we left the club in frustration after recording the game
result with the club secretary: a three-way draw that included the
absent Moriarty.
  <p align="justify">
   When I returned to Baker Street after the game, I expected sympathy from
   Holmes when I told him of the new member of the club and his rude behavior.
   Far from being sympathetic, Holmes seemed much amused by the story.
   Indeed, Holmes commented that this wily newcomer, while rude in the extreme
   for his manner of exit, was surely a man of great and devious intelligence,
   and Holmes seemed almost eager to make his acquaintance.
  <p align=justify>
   To my surprise, Holmes' smiling response to my lingering anger with Moriarty
   was, "Well, Watson, it is obvious to me which power Codlington was playing,
   and how many armies he had on the board.  I must say that had I been in
   this fellow's position, which if I'm
   not mistaken had him owning these five supply centres" -- (Holmes pointed
   to the board) -- "and with units in these locations" -- (pointing again) --
   "and if I had felt that your alliance with Rev. Codlington would not permit
   me an opportunity to do any better than the present situation, I may well
   have left the club as well.  Although I, of course, would have properly
   excused myself, and prevented you and the vicar from needlessly
   continuing."
  <p align=justify>
   <img hspace="5" src="../../Common/stopsign.gif" align="left">
   <em>Can you, as Holmes did, determine which supply centres were owned by
    Moriarty? And the locations of his units?  And which power was player
	by Reverend Codlington? And how many armies the reverend had?

  <p align=justify>
   I was astonished that Holmes had correctly deduced Moriarty's situation,
   simply from the spare data that I had provided to him.  However, as I
   have learned in my years with Holmes, one should never be amazed at his
   powers of observation and deduction, for there seems always to be yet
   more that he holds in reserve.  This was true in this case as well,
   because no sooner had the shock of his demonstration hit me, than
   my friend continued his remarks:
 <p align=justify>
   "Yes, the fellow who constructed this stalemate line is a clever man indeed.
   From his strange and uncouth behaviour, his is apparently a
   personality of such order that it may prove wise for me to make some
   inquiries as to his
   occupation and intentions."  Musing deeper and walking away from the board,
   Holmes (more to himself than to me, it seemed) added, "I wonder if he
   sees that a stalemate line can also be
   constructed using one <i>fewer</i> unit than you and Reverend
   Codlington allowed him.  Such a line would
   guard the same centres, and would stand against the same number of
   enemy units located in the same places as in this game (though not in
   all cases the same <i>types</i> of units).  Of course,
   he could not have left the club as he did, though...."

   <em>How about it?  Can you do it with one fewer unit?
