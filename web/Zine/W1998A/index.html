<A HREF="Lascelle/Renewbie.html">Observations of a Renewbie</a></b><dd>
Reminiscent of the zine's Incoming! series of articles from a newbie, this is
a slightly different perspective from somebody who is not new to the hobby, but
returning to it after a hiatus.  (Yes, it puzzles us too, but we're a welcoming
bunch so we're happy to have him back).

are heard.
