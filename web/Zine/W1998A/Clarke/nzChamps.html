The first FTF Diplomacy Tournament in New Zealand (as far as I know)
since 1990 or 1991 was held in Auckland on the weekend of August 22nd
and 23rd, 1998. 29 players from all over New Zealand and Australia
attended, and played 3 very successful rounds of Diplomacy over the two
days. The bug that I caught when I went to Melbourne, Australia last
December to play in the Don Challenge Cup has really caught hold here in
New Zealand. Plans are currently underway for a second Tournament to be
held in the Waikato in February, and in the wake of the NZ Champs the
Auckland Diplomacy Club has sprung into vigorous life. The ADC meets
monthly, 2 weeks removed from the Hamilton Diplomacy Club, so if you're
from the Northern part of the North Island there are regular club
meetings near you every two weeks now. Contact Brandon Clarke or Craig
Purcell if you want to join the fun. For contacts in other parts of New
Zealand and Australia check out the "Other Clubs and contacts throughout
New Zealand & Australia" link on the <a href=http://www.stevensons.co.nz/~bjc/Auckland_Diplomacy_Club/index.htm>Auckland Diplomacy Club web page</a>.
<p>
At the <a href=http://www.stevensons.co.nz/~bjc/Diplomacy_articles/NZChamps.html>web site for the NZ Diplomacy Champs</a> you'll finds all the
results, and some very interesting stories and reviews under the "Tales
from the tournament" link. There's also now a photo gallery for you to
enjoy.
<p>
The tournament was won by Peter Taylor with a solo victory as Austria on
the last turn of the tournament. The next three positions were filled by
three of the four Australians who crossed the ditch from the West Island
to play. If you do nothing else, you MUST read the account of the
origins of the "Great Dalinski F.U.B.A.R. Memorial Cup", now a perpetual
trophy at the New Zealand Diplomacy Champs for the biggest cock-up of
the tournament. (see it under the "Tales from the tournament" link)
<p>
The second annual New Zealand Diplomacy Champs will be held in August
1999. By then there will be an annual North Island Champs, and there
could well be a South Island Champs too, as there's quite a number of
Dippers coming out of the woodwork in Christchurch, Timaru, and Dunedin.
