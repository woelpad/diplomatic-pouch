Dear Manus,

Remember me? I believe I promised you a Pouch article a while back. Well, I
might have something for you. It probably needs work, but I think it has
potential.

I'm about to finish the first game of Diplomacy I ever started, 'earth' on
USPA, with a win as Austria in 1910. Because I'm in the process of moving
across the country, I might miss the last turn or so, and I wrote my EOG
early... I just finished it.

Well, the EOG turned out to be a lot longer than I expected. Since it was a
newbie game, I wanted not only to say my farewells to the other players but
also to explain why I did what I did, and why it worked. It turned out a LOT
longer than I expected.

I have two article possibilities in mind. One is something similar to Dan
Shoham's Diplomacy Academy, with the EOGs and analysis of the game. (Too bad
that 'earth' didn't finish two months ago, or I could have been a "guest
columnist" for the Academy while Dan is away.) The other possibility is to
expand on one or two of the strategies and tactics I describe in the EOG.

If you are interested, I can forward the EOG and game history to you.

Sincerely,
Bradd W. Szonye

>(But publish the whole EOG too -- In case you thought I meant otherwise.)

Here's what I'm thinking:

There are a few "new" tactics and strategies I discovered while playing this
game, some diplomatic and some military. The major ones were:

1. Arranging large (3+ power), temporary alliances to gain an advantage.
2. Surviving a major stab by attacking all-out on a *different* front.
3. Attacking on fronts where fast gains are possible but only slow gains are
guaranteed.
4. Advancing quickly against a weaker opponent by outflanking.

In case it's not clear what I mean, here's a quick description of the
situations:

1. Arranging large (3+ power), temporary alliances to gain an advantage.

By this, I mean staging a "crusade" against a weak power (like Austria at
the beginning of the game), an obnoxious power (whom all the neighbors
hate), or a dangerous power (victim of ELS). I've noticed that a lot of Dip
players are willing to accept a "leader" in a crusade if you step up to the
position and rally the troops. While these mega-alliances are VERY
short-lived, I've found that you can accomplish a few things: (1) destroy a
power very quickly, (2) effectively give orders to three or four powers for
a turn or two, and (3) get your pick of the spoils--within reason--much more
quickly than you could otherwise. Several times I've seen situations where
many powers WANT to destroy a particular power, but the attack is
ineffective until they all band together, if only for a short time.

2. Surviving a major stab by attacking all-out on a *different* front.

A few times, I've found myself in the position of being caught off-guard by
a major stab because I was too busy attacking somebody else, with not enough
of a garrison to stop the stab. My favorite way of dealing with this is to
keep up my original attack and do the best I can with the outgunned
garrison. It's a gamble, but it's worked for me two times out of three. I
think it works because (1) the gains you make in the attack can balance the
losses from the stab, (2) the stabber becomes frustrated by a victim who
doesn't fight back "properly," (3) it's easier to maintain diplomatic
relations when you don't escalate the stab into a major war, and (4) it's
easier to enlist help against the stabber, because you make him look like a
bully. When this strategy succeeds (you re-establish a truce with the
stabber), your troops are still in position for your original attack, and
the first major build you get puts new troops in good position to
counter-stab.

3. Attacking on fronts where fast gains are possible but only slow gains are
guaranteed.

This one's a little harder to describe, but I'll try. Suppose that Germany
has armies in Piedmont, Tyrolia, Vienna, and Budapest; Austria has A Venice,
A Trieste, and F Adriatic. Austria has her choice of supporting either
Venice or Trieste with the fleet; the only guaranteed move Germany has is
taking Trieste, by cutting Venice and attacking Trieste 3-on-2. However, if
Germany attacks A Pie + A Tyr --> Ven and A Vie + A Bud --> Trieste, they
are still guaranteed to get one of the centers, and will take both if
Austria makes a mistake.

More generally, when given a choice beween making 1 very strongly supported
attack and 2-3 weakly supported attacks, I look to see whether the weak
attacks *in combination* guarantee at least one forced move. The
disadvantage is that your opponent chooses which center you take; the
advantage is you can often take more than one.

4. Advancing quickly against an opponent by outflanking and trapping his
units.

I've had a lot of success with setting up traps and bait for other players.
Patience is the key here. I look at where my opponent most likely wants to
attack my front, or where they'll most likely want to move to defend a
province, and then *let them go there*. However, I make a note of which
units they need to support the attack, and from that I find which flanking
spaces will be vacant. The opponent has now extended his front too far and
is surrounded by my troops. For example, suppose that Turkey has F Bla and A
Ank; Austria has A Bul, F Aeg, and F Ion. Directly attacking Constantinople
(as Austria) will probably fail, because Turkey can bounce with a supported
attack from the Black Sea or Ankara. Austria is now in the same bad position
in the next year.

However, if Austria orders A Bul H, F Aeg-Smy, F Ion-Aeg, then Turkey will
most likely advance to Constantinople--and be surrounded. Since Turkey will
protect Constantinople with a direct attack, the flanking maneuver will
succeed, and suddenly Austria has a guaranteed attack on Constantinople in
the following turn.

I've also found that flanking works well in combination with the "weakly
forced" front in the previous tactic. There were some examples in the game,
but I'd have to dig through the moves to root them out.


Whew--those "summaries" are longer than I planned, but those are the major
ideas. I wonder, are there any in particular that you find more interesting?
Or any tactics that seem flawed (ie., they only worked because my opponents
were inexperienced)?

A possible format for the article would be to write up the topics above, and
end the article with links to the summary and EOGs of 'earth.' I could use
actual moves from the game to illustrate the two military tactics.

This will probably take a while to do, and I'll probably be without a
computer for a while. But I'll do my best to get this thing done in time for
the next issue of the Pouch. I did promise that I'd write up my experiences
from my first game, after all.

I'd appreciate any feedback you could give on this.

Bradd W. Szonye
