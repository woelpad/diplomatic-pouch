<p>We finally get to the article everyone has been waiting for -- how to
spend your money on bribes. Time and again, I've counseled against doing this,
but I'm sure no one really listened. It's one of those things you need to
learn from experience. It's one of those things I haven't completely learned
myself. I'll start with most powerful looking but least useful bribe types
and work down to the ones that the good players use a lot. <img src=/Zine/Common/smiley.gif>
<h3>Assassination</h3>
<p>A successful assassination can really hurt a power badly. You freeze all
their units for a season, put a bunch of their provinces into rebellion,
and get to kick them around for a season. Great deal, huh? Well, don't
forget that you only get a one in six chance of success for every twelve
ducats spent. To get a 50% chance of success, you need to spend enough that
you could have bought two units, or disbanded three! And you can only spend
up to 36d on one
attempt, so you can't spend more to guarantee success. Plus, every time
you make an attempt you burn an assassination chit. Really, the only time
I use this expense is when absolutely nothing else will do the job. For example, one
time I was playing Florence I had all my units bought, disbanded, or destroyed
by plague during the first season! The only possible way to defend myself
was successful assassination -- I had no units, so no adjacent units. And
that defense would have only worked for a season anyway, even if my roll
had not failed.
<p>But I see you are not dissuaded. You feel that the potential gains outweigh
the costs, and you have to give it a try. Well, here are some things to consider
to maximize your chances:
<ol>
<li>If your target has a bunch of units in famined areas in spring,
you can do a lot more damage assassinating them now than at any other time
during the year. The freezing of their units will cause them a <b>lot</b> of
extra pain when it really means the units are dead.
<li>If your target has a lot of units in garrison form, you might want
to wait for the garrisons to convert before sending an assassin. When the
rebellions are assigned, they can't affect cities with garrisons in them.
The biggest long-term piece of damage that assassination does to a player is
to turn their <i>cities</i> against them -- the <i>province</i> rebellions
are not nearly as damaging.
<li>If you need more assassination chits, ask around. If a player is
big enough to be worth assassinating, they probably made some enemies.
Don't forget the eliminated players. Assassination chit transfers are
asynchronous, so you can gather them between seasons if necessary.
<li>Take advantage of the season's freeze to kick some units around.
Things that have been solidly supported won't be during just this one season.
Yes, you might leave yourself open relying on the assassination, but if
you weren't about to lose anyway if it didn't work you wouldn't be doing
an assassination attempt. <img src=/Zine/Common/smiley.gif>
</ol>
<h3>Buy A Unit</h3>
<p>This is the second most expensive thing you can do. It's a bit more sure
than assassination, though you need to be careful not to be counterbribed.
A well-placed unit purchase can be quite destructive. Sometimes, it's even
worthwhile, if a gem such as Genoa is available, or you can remove an opponent
from the game. One classic example of this is the old first turn kill of
Florence by the Papacy, which is to buy Florence and order it to Pisa, while disbanding
Arezzo and moving in with Perugia. This while moving Bologna to Pistoia to make sure
you get control of the home area, and praing that Florence didn't take my normal
precaution of simply ordering Pisa to hold, or of counterbribing.
<p>So anyway, factors to consider in buying a unit:
<ol>
<li>When possible, pick a target who can't counterbribe. If this is not
possible, pick the unit that your victim is not expecting you to buy.
You're spending a lot of money, you don't want to lose it.
<li>When in doubt, overbribe. You may waste some money, but not as much
money as would be wasted if the bribe fails.
<li>Remember that garrisons in major cities cost twice as much to bribe.
So do professionals and citizens. Don't even think about buying a citizen's
garrison in Venice; go win the game with your 72d instead.
<li>Look at the other bribe types first and make sure you can't do the
job cheaper.
<li>One truly nifty trick is to buy a fleet and use it to convoy one
of your units forward; this can really crack an opponent's defenses wide
open if done properly.
<li>Unless you can take advantage of famine, wait until after Spring
to buy a unit that won't end the turn at sea, so you don't get damaged
by plague.
<li>Before you decide to buy that special unit, make sure you don't
already have one. You aren't allowed to have more than one at once.
</ol>
<h3>Kill A Unit</h3>
<p>Okay, so technically some other bribes are more expensive, but this is
another
of those open-ended bribes that you need to worry about counterbribing,
so I'll handle it here. Most of what I said for buying units applies here
too, except of
course that killing a unit is more often used as a defensive than
as an offensive
tactic. Get as much good as you can out of it; if you focus on units that you
know will be planning to sit still, it's more likely you can advance. For
example, if you know that a fleet will be attempting to convoy an army, and
you disband it, you make the army's move wasted as well, and you have a good
chance of advancing into the sea zone.
<p>One frequent use for disbands is to deal with a unit that's running
around in your backfield that you really need to get rid of. It may be
capable of throwing support breaks that ruin your offensive, or you might
have a building bottleneck that prevents you from tracking it down the
old-fashioned way. It may be sitting in a province outside one of your
major cities and you need to remove it before it can become a garrison.
Or you might be trying to finish off a home area set. In any case, disbands
do have a place, though you may be surprised to find that you can take
care of some of these problems less expensively.
<h3> Rebellions -- Making and Breaking</h3>
<p>Now things start to get interesting.
<p>You probably don't want to spend the cash to start a rebellion in a
home area (it costs 15d) very often, but a normal rebellion costs a paltry
9d. This is less than a disband, and even more importantly cannot be counterbribed.
A city with a rebellion in it cannot be retreated into, or converted into.
A rebellion gives you an extra support. This adds up to being able to destroy
units cheaply in many situations.
<p>Here's an example. You have an army in Provence. Your enemy (who does not control
the French rolls) has an army in Marseilles. You need Marseilles. Obviously,
you're not going to get there very quickly by conventional means. Or even
if you <u>can</u> get there by conventional means (your unit is elite, or you
have a fleet in WGL) you know he can just retreat to garrison form and
drag things out, which you can't afford because it is critical that you
use Marseilles
for a build next season, or to complete a home area set.
<p>You <u>could</u> use a disband bribe. It would work if not counterbribed.
But it would cost more money than simply putting Marseilles in rebellion.
That would give you the extra support to get into the province, and it
denies the retreat to garrison form option, so the defending unit would
be destroyed by your advance. And the rebellion is liberated as you enter,
so it doesn't cause you any troubles.
<p>Here's a second example. You want to take Genoa. Your opponent has an army there,
and is probably going to convert it and bring another army into the area.
In this case, simply disbanding the army won't do the job for you -- you'd
still bounce the new one moving in. But if you put Genoa in rebellion
(note that Genoa is <i>not</i> a home area for this purpose), then you get the support
you need to move in, and both the conversion and the move in by the other
unit fail. The unit that was there may survive the retreat, but you achieved
the important part -- you secured Genoa's five ducat (or greater) income for the coming
year, and removed it from your opponent. Effectively at a cost of nine, you
made a net difference of at least ten in treasuries; even without other considerations,
this transaction was profitable!
<p>The two main things to keep in mind about rebellions are:
<ol>
<li>Rebellions are not very useful against areas with Garrisons in them;
they are not even possible against the city of Venice if it is occupied by an
Army or Fleet since there is no province there.
<li>Home areas are more expensive to put in rebellion.
</ol>
<p>And of course, there is also getting rid of rebellions to consider.
This costs 12d. It isn't often that you need to do this instead of the
cheaper approach of assigning a unit to the job, but sometimes you're short
on units, and badly need a home city available to build the next season.
And for some reason you have plenty of cash (unusual, in that if a home
city is in rebellion against you it's usually because you got assassinated
recently). And you don't want to just wait until next year to spend 18d
to buy an enemy unit (since the opponent spends three to maintain, you
don't actually save a net three like you might think you do; you just save
having to send a unit to deal with the rebellion). Anyway, you get the
idea.
<h3>Garrison Games</h3>
<p>There are a number of bribes for dealing with garrisons and their autonomous
status (or lack thereof). These are generally cheaper than normal bribes,
and as such can provide useful services. For example, if you want to spend
money early to get more units and conquer cities, buying an autonomous
garrison isn't a bad way to go. If you want to conquer Genoa without the
siege, 12d will do it against the initial autonomous garrison. These are
the obvious and reasonable ways to use these types of bribes.
<p>Where they become really cool offensive tools is in their less obvious uses.
Your opponent may have taken the suggestion to use garrisons defensively
(in my last article) to heart. Well, you can get those garrisons out of his
control at 9d each, changing them to autonomous. Sure, you don't get the
city either, but they happen to be sitting in his home city, you might
just be able to eliminate him this way -- then siege the garrisons at your
leisure. If your opponent is using a port to produce fleets or armies,
changing his garrison to autonomous costs him over a year's use -- the
season he takes to realize he needs to set up a siege, maybe a season
to move a unit in, and then the two seasons to perform the siege. Finally,
he must convert the sieging unit into garrison form to get back to where he
was before you interfered. It can be a real drag to be on the receiving
end of such an effort.
<h3>Famine Relief</h3>
<p>Now we come to the cheapest way to advance: simply pay off a famine in
an area you want, and move into it. This doesn't work so well if your opponent
has decided to bite the bullet and pay as well, staying there. But many
times players will simply step off the famined areas, and move back in
in the summer. You can really disrupt a line by moving forward unexpectedly.
Similarly, spending famine relief while you're in an area from which you
can do an unexpected support cut can allow for an nice spring offensive.
<h3>Counterbribes</h3>
<p>Never forget you can counterbribe. If you are the sort of player who would
not usually counterbribe, and tattooing a reminder on your hand doesn't
do the job, then remind the other players instead by counterbribing from
time to time when there isn't a necessary reason to do so, and at least they'll
spend a bunch when they <i>do</i> bribe you to overcome your tendency to
counterbribe.
<p>Most players won't heed my warnings earlier in the article and will
go for the obvious units, and the obvious ways to do things. Until you
realize you are facing a wiser opponent, take advantage of this fact,
and hurt his pocket badly.
<h3>Next Time</h3>
My next installment will deal with how to run an endgame defense in a game
with no stalemate lines. I might throw in some other things. I need
to reread my past articles and see if there are any glaring holes -- feel
free to e-mail me if there is an issue you want addressed.
