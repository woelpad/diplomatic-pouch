<H2 align=center>The Six Traits of the Advanced Diplomacy Player</h2>

<H3 align=center><i>By Joshua Randall</i></H3>
<hr WIDTH="100%">


<p>This article grew out of discussions among my Diplomacy team,
the Seven Most Evil Men in the World, prior to the recently
completed (April 2000) World E-Mail Masters Tournament. Below,
I list and explain six key traits that advanced Diplomacy
players share.

<p><b>FLEXIBILITY</b>

<p>Flexibility is a multi-faceted trait which can mean many
things. It includes the willingness to try unusual moves
instead of expected moves. Flexibility also refers to a
willingness to make and consider almost any diplomatic
offer, no matter how seemingly outrageous. Finally, an
important aspect of flexibility is the knowledge that
sometimes a carefully plotted strategem fails, and must
be reconsidered, modified, or even abandoned in the face
of a changed board or diplomatic position.

<p>Most new players are not flexible. They tend to devise a
single, all-consuming plan in 1901, and follow it to the
bitter end, far past the point of diminishing (or nonexistent) returns. With experience comes increasing flexibility. Advanced players are usually supremely flexible.
They are capable of shifting both their tactical and
diplomatic plays to suit the game.

<p>A flexible player always has plenty of options for each
season's moves. Certainly, a good player must pursue his
goal with tactical precision and the appropriate diplomatic
underpinnings, but he must also remain aware of other
possibilities. Really advanced players often have several
schemes going at once and for that reason are almost never
caught in an untenable tactical or diplomatic position.

<p>Flexibility is related to willingness to communicate.

<p><b>WILLINGNESS TO COMMUNICATE</b>

<p>The good player shows a willingness to communicate during
all stages of the game. This does not necessarily mean that
he writes reams of press, or even that his press is well
written. It may be in a player's interest *not* to write
very much, or deliberately to adopt a poor writing style.
Regardless, a willingness to communicate informs the
advanced player's negotiations.

<p>Good players communicate with a specific purpose in mind.
That purpose can be rather vague, such as lulling another
player into complacency, or gradually building a basis of
friendship and trust that may or may not bear fruit later
in the game. The purpose for communicating can also be
extremely specific, such as securing support for a certain
move, or carefully coordinating a stalemate line.

<p>Newer players tend to react poorly to hostility from other
countries and refuse to communicate with them. If asked
about this, a new player often responds by wondering what
two 'enemy' powers could possibly have to discuss. What the
experienced, better player understands is that Diplomacy is,
by its nature, a game of shifting alliances and unexpected
reversals; your hated enemy today may be your rock-solid
ally tomorrow. Therefor, it is crucial to maintain communication with all powers, even (or especially) those with whom
you are presently in conflict.

<p>The combination of flexibility and willingness to communicate
is a powerful one. It often means that the advanced player is
in simultaneous discussion with all sides of a conflict. This
gives him more options, as discussed under flexibility. It
also keeps him aware of what the other powers are are saying.
And while you can't always believe what they tell you, you
can glean information from the lies you're being told.

<p>Flexibility and willingness to communicate are necessarily
tempered by realism.

<p><b>REALISM</b>

<p>Realism means that a player has a mature understanding of the
game: that it is a struggle for resources and position. That
struggle involves both tactical conflict over the board, and
psychological conflict through press. At all times, the
realistic player is aware that others *are* plotting against
him (paranoia is a fact of life in Diplomacy), and that if he
shows weakness or vulnerability he is very likely to be hurt.

<p>Conversely, the realistic player is not afraid to explore his
options with powers other than those with which he is presently aligned. While leaning on an ally for support he may also
be plotting that ally's destruction with the help of a third
party. And the realistic player knows that both his ally and
the third party are probably plotting with each other or with
others against him.

<p>Advanced players are not afraid to hear that their so-called
friends are exploring other options. Nor are they afraid to
do so themselves. In games with newer players, it is common
to see much spreading of gossip with the intention of damaging one player's standing in the eyes of another's. In games
with advanced players, the spreading of gossip turns into
spreading of information, and rather than provoking scorn,
it leads to a grudging respect of each player for his peers.
The realist's knowledge that he is certainly being plotted
against keeps him on his toes and makes him less likely to
leave himself vulnerable.

<p>It is extemely important for the advanced player to discover
the level of realism of the players around him. A naive player
will react very poorly to what would make a realistic player
merely smile. Worse yet, a group of naive players may mark
the realistic player as too dangerous to leave alive. Even
the most tactically gifted player cannot withstand both
diplomatic isolation and positional assault by multiple other
powers.

<p>The necessity to assess other players falls under judgement.

<p><b>JUDGEMENT</b>

<p>This is judgement in the sense of judging another player's
character, not in the sense of making legal determinations.
A good player must be able to determine what another player
is like, both as a Diplomacy gamer and as a person. Keen
judgement of personality allows the good player to predict
how his peers will react in certain situations. Judgement
of this sort, combined with other traits, ensures that the
advanced player is seldom surprised by his fellow players'
moves. While stabs remain possible, of course, the reason
for the stab is usually predictable.

<p>The combination of judgement and realism makes the advanced
player take a rather calculating view towards others. He
knows that they are plotting his downfall, and he knows that
they are going to lie about it. What's more, he knows that
those lies, if coming from a good player, will be convincing
and well-reasoned. The advanced player must weigh multiple
considerations when deciding whom to trust in a game. For
it is a truism of Diplomacy that it is impossible to win the
game without cooperating with others at some level.

<p>Some advanced players are so good at judging others' characters that they succeed in appearing to offer just what is
necessary to sway the others' behavior. For one person this
may be friendly banter about a shared culture or pasttime;
for another it may be in-depth tactical discussions and
positional analyses. The player with good judgement knows
which arguments to use on which person, and in which
situation.

<p><b>TACTICAL GRASP</b>

<p>Of course, the above traits are useless without a firm grasp
of the tactics of Diplomacy. The advanced player can be
counted on to play with tactical precision, making no or
very few mistakes. Of course, in some complex situations even
the best player is faced with difficult decisions, some of
which may fail; but he will make those decisions with a sure
understanding of their tactical ramifications.

<p>The advanced player almost never guesses or makes a 'lucky'
move. He may make a calculated risk or take a deliberate
gamble, but again, he does so knowing the consequences of
either the success or failure of each move.

<p>New players make all sorts of blunders, for which they can
be forgiven, as Dipomacy is a complex and difficult game.
More damaging, however, is a new player's inability to see
what is going to happen several seasons into the future, and
to plan for that eventuality. It is for that reason that new
players often make inappropriate builds, or send their units
into the 'wrong' province. The advanced player can not only
forsee what will happen this coming season, but can also make
reasonable predictions about the upcoming years. His ability
to sense the shape of the board to come allows him to move
towards long-term strategic goals, supporting them with
appropriate diplomacy.

<p><b>PATIENCE</b>

<p>Diplomacy is notorious as a game that takes a long while to
play. Face-to-face games last hours or days; e-mail games
last months; and play-by-mail games can last years. The good
player is patient through all of this. He is not deterred by
the investment of time the game requires.

<p>He is also patient within the game. If another player refuses
to talk now, perhaps he will talk in the future. If an attack
didn't succeed today, perhaps a slightly different version of
the attack will succed tomorrow. A patient player also knows
that Diplomacy is not won or lost by who gains builds each
year; it is won by who has control of 18 SCs. The patient
player is content to sit on his current SC count, or even
lose SCs, in order to advance toward his goal in other areas.

<p>New players lack the patience that the game requires. That is
why so many of them abandon positions, especially when those
positions suffer reversals, no matter how easily rectified.
New players also lack the patience to stick with a seemingly
unfruitful line of attack or defense. For this reason, it is
very difficult to get new players to form a stalemate line,
should that be necessary; and so many games with new players
end in victory when they 'should' have ended in a draw.

<p>The advanced player is as patient as Job. He acts when it is
time to act and waits when it is time to wait.

<p>The underlying assumption of the above list of 'advanced player
traits' is that Diplomacy is being played as a rational game
with good-faith efforts being made to win, or not lose (i.e.,
draw) by all powers. Nothing is more dangerous to what I call
the good (or advanced) player than a maverick who does not
care about winning the game, and who behaves irrationally. A
single such player can drastically alter the outcome of a
game, turning stable positions into chaos, and turning
dynamic positions into gridlock.

<p>Still, assuming a board full of rational, competent players,
the most successful players will be those with the greatest
strengths in the traits I list here -- flexibility, willingness
to communicate, realism, judgement, tactical grasp, and
patience.
