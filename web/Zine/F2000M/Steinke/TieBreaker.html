<!-- article w/ H3 section headings -->
<p>Due to time constraints, Diplomacy tournaments usually have a small number
of rounds.  Often less than the number of boards played in each round.  This
can result in many players having similar records which leads to a high
probability of ties.  This is especially true in DIAS tournaments where centers
are not scored, and all survivors receive an equal share in any draw.  This
article deals with the issue of breaking ties especially in DIAS tournaments.
<p>The first tie breaker should always be head to head competition.  This
applies to any tournament.  If the tournament scoring system declares
two players to be tied when all of their games are considered then
recalculate considering only the games where the players directly
played against one another.  After this calculation there is still a
significant chance of a tie.  The players could have played no games
against one another, or played just one and both received the same
result.  So there should still be some backup system for breaking
ties.
<p>Before I go further, let me say a few words about the DIAS philosophy
which will help to decide on a method to declare one record "better"
than another when the scoring system says they are the same.  The DIAS
system places negotiation skill as the highest concern.  The only
question for scoring is survival or elimination.  If a country exists
it has a voice in international diplomacy.  If it does not it does
not.  Imagine the game ends in a three way draw with supply centers
divided 16-15-3.  The country with three supply centers has
demonstrated skillful diplomacy in preventing the larger countries
from crushing him.  Indeed, he has gotten them to voluntarily give him
an equal share in the draw.  Truly a diplomatic achievement.
<p>This is the reason that DIAS tournaments avoid scoring supply centers.
Of course, the assumption is that the game ends by solo victory or a
voluntary draw.  If the game were ended by an involuntary deadline
then perhaps the two larger powers were well on their way to
eliminating the small power and finishing in a perfect 17-17 draw.  In
this case the smaller power should not be scored very high.  The DIAS
format is more appropriate when games are allowed as much as possible
to be ended only by the actions of the players.  Scoring supply
centers more heavily weights military skill, and is more appropriate
when games are expected to end by reaching a deadline.
<p>So, if scoring wins, draws, and losses results in a tie and we want to
avoid scoring supply centers what can we use to break the tie?  I
believe the answer is game years played.  A win achieved in 1909 is
better than a win in 1910.  A draw, likewise, is better the sooner it
can be achieved.  You could have had a four way draw and you didn't
vote for it, but instead spent time dilly dallying and not eliminating
any players to get the same result a few years later.  Wasting time
shows a lack of skill.
<p>Eliminations, on the other hand should be rewarded for surviving as
long as possible.  The simplest system would be to add up -1 for each
win or draw year, and +1 for each loss year, but this doesn't work
well.  Consider the following records in a three round tournament:
<table border=2>
<tr><td colspan=3>Player 1</td><td colspan=3>Player 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>win</td><td>1913</td> <td>-13</td><td>2draw</td><td>1904</td><td>-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>loss</td><td>1901</td> <td>+1</td><td>4draw</td><td>1904</td><td>-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>loss</td><td>1901</td> <td>+1</td><td>4draw</td><td>1904</td><td>-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-11</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-12</td></tr></table>
<p>These two records have the same YARS score.  Player one had a win in
1913 (worse than 1904) and two losses in 1901 (the worst possible.)
Player two had three draws all in 1904 (pretty good.)  If you accept
the fact that a win and two losses are equivalent to a two way and two
four way draws then player two clearly had a better record of game
years, but loses the tie breaker.  The problem is that the negative
points of wins and draws aren't really comparable to the positive
points of losses.  If losses count up from zero then wins and draws
should start counting down from some positive number.  Where they meet
determines when two records are equivalent.
<p>In games where you achieved a win or draw:
<ul>
<li>+X to offset negative
<li>-1 for each game year played
</ul>
<p>In games where you lost:
<ul>
<li>+1 for each game year played
</ul>
<p>The value of X depends on how long you expect games to last.  If your
tournament does have a maximum game year you can use that as X.  For
example, if X is 14 then the following records are equivalent:
<table border=2>
<tr><td colspan=3>Player 1</td><td colspan=3>Player 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>win</td><td>1907</td> <td>14-7</td><td>2draw</td><td>1907</td><td>14-7</td></tr>
<tr><td>loss</td><td>1907</td> <td>+7</td><td>4draw</td><td>1907</td><td>14-7</td></tr>
<tr><td>loss</td><td>1907</td> <td>+7</td><td>4draw</td><td>1907</td><td>14-7</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>+21</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>&nbsp;</td><td>+21</td></tr></table>
<p>Another factor in eliminations is the number of countries left at the
end of the game.  Player one is eliminated by a cohesive three way
alliance, and the game ends in a three way draw.  Player two is
eliminated by a shaky three way alliance which breaks down after he is
gone and the game ends in a solo victory.  Player two showed less
skill because he should have been able to break up the alliance with
diplomacy while he was still alive.  If you are eliminated, the more
players that survive to the end of the game, the more players you
probably had teamed up against you.
<p>An alternative system would be:
<p>In games where you achieved a win or draw:
<ul>
<li>+X to offset negative
<li>-1 for each game year played
</ul>
<p>In games where you lost:
<ul>
<li>+1 for each game year played
<li>-1 for each player eliminated including yourself
</ul>
<p>In this case X would have to be modified to reflect the fact that
losses now have some negative modifiers.  A loss to a four way draw in
1907 would be equivalent to a loss to a solo victor in 1910, and if X
were 10 would be tie break equivalent to getting a draw in 1906
<H3>A More Complex System</H3>
<p>The simple tie break system described above is as yet untested, but
would probably work just fine under any circumstances.  However, let
me now describe an idea I've had for a system that might be more
interesting.  I think a draw year should be penalized more than a win
year.  If you could've gotten the win a year earlier you would have,
but for a draw there is a conscious choice.  "Should I vote for the
draw now, or try for a better result?"  An early draw could be the
result of wisdom and decisive action.  A late draw might have been the
result of wasting time.  I would also give more penalty to late high
player draws.  If you get a late two player draw you probably needed
much of that time to eliminate the other players.  If you get a late
five player draw that shows a lack of something good.
<p>Back to some examples:
<table border=2>
<tr><td colspan=2>Player 1</td><td colspan=2>Player 2</td></tr>
<tr><td>win</td><td>1910</td><td>win</td><td>1910</td></tr>
<tr><td>win</td><td>1911</td><td>win</td><td>1910</td></tr>
<tr><td>4draw</td><td>1909</td><td>4draw</td><td>1910</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Player one took an extra year to win, but got the 4 way draw one year
earlier.  By my logic, player two should be penalized more for the
extra 4draw year than player one should be for the extra win year so
player 1 should win the tie break.
<p>Here is the system.  Tying players line up their results from best to
worst.  This can be done for more than two way ties as well.  For each
line find a common denominator in the following way: Take the largest
number of players and the smallest year.  Pretend that all players
were in this situation, and made different decisions.  Some players
may have eliminated opponents.  For each opponent eliminated the
player gets +1.  Some players may have taken extra years.  Each extra
year gets a penalty based on the final outcome the player was able to
achieve (not the denominator position).
<p>Penalty Per Year
<table border=2>
<tr><td>win:</td><td>-.32</td></tr>
<tr><td>2draw:</td><td>-.35</td></tr>
<tr><td>3draw:</td><td>-.38</td></tr>
<tr><td>4draw:</td><td>-.41</td></tr>
<tr><td>5draw:</td><td>-.44</td></tr>
<tr><td>6draw:</td><td>-.47</td></tr>
<tr><td>7draw:</td><td>-.50</td></tr>
</table>
<p>Another example:
<table border=2>
<tr><td colspan=2>Player 1</td><td colspan=2>Player 2</td><td colspan=2>Common Denominator</td></tr>
<tr><td>2draw</td><td>1908</td><td>3draw</td><td>1907</td><td>3draw</td><td>1907</td></tr>
<tr><td>4draw</td><td>1907</td><td>3draw</td><td>1907</td><td>4draw</td><td>1907</td></tr>
<tr><td>6draw</td><td>1906</td><td>4draw</td><td>1907</td><td>6draw</td><td>1906</td></tr>
</table>
<p>In the first line both players had a three player game in 1907.
Player two decided to accept the draw.  Player one kept playing and
took 1 year (bad -.35) to eliminate 1 player (good +1.)  In line two
player two took zero years to eliminate one player (+1.)  In line
three player one accepted a six way draw and player two took 1 year
(-.41) to eliminate two players (+2.)  Player 1 gets -.35 +1 = .65,
and player two gets +1 -.41 +2 = 2.59.  Player two wins.
<p>This system hasn't included losses yet.  Once again comparing wins and
draws to losses proves troublesome.  We know that before the game
started both players had the equivalent of a seven way draw in 1900 so
that is the common denominator.  The win or draw proceeds as usual
counting the number of players eliminated against the number of years
taken.  The loss takes the following modifiers:
<ul>
<li>-1 per player eliminated including self
<li>+.5 per year of survival
</ul>
<p>Comparing losses to losses finds a common denominator by taking the
largest number of survivors and earliest year and proceeds from there
with the modifiers above.  Here are some final examples of tie break
outcomes.  A loss to X surviving players is written as an Xloss.
Remember, the players' overall records from multiple rounds would have
to be equivalent before the tie break would be counted.

<p>Hopefully someone will use this tie breaker system, and let me know how
it goes.
