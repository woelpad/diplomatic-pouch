?What is a newbie?   By Joe Brennan

Blurb: When is a newbie not a newbie? How do you graduate to intermediate?
These
questions answered, plus more.

The answer is simple: you decide. But you wouldn’t be reading this if you
weren’t interested
in finding out whether your own thoughts were in keeping with my own, would
you?

I first started playing Diplomacy fifteen years ago. That’s about when I
finished playing, too.
I left school, and all my Diplomacy contacts. Last year, a friend asked me
to comment on a
game he was in, and after a while I decided I wanted back in. I went to the
DipPouch and
signed up for a newbie game, speedo.

“Why are you in a newbie game?” my friend asked. “You’re no novice.” But I
was! Although
I had considerable tactical knowledge of the game, I had little idea how to
deal with the
Judge, or how to treat the other players. I felt it was only fair to play
against novices while I
picked up the game again.

After some initial successes, I found myself a victim of the tall poppy
syndrome (aka the
early leader syndrome), and everyone is now beating the stuffings out of me.
Hm, there’s a
lesson in there for me somewhere....

I have entered five other games as a replacement player since then. I’ve
played around with
grey press and broadcasts, honesty and stab stab stabbing,*secret glee*
Yesterday I
discovered that the list command will show me the dedication rating of other
players! (Okay,
you’re all smiling at me, thinking, “What an idiot! I’d love to play against
this dolt.”) I
learned how to get the Diplomacy Mapper up and running - I even worked out
how to add
Hellas2 to the variants on Version 1.2 !!!! I’ve travelled all over the
DipPouch, and even
written a letter to Manus Hand! (I know you’re all saying, “Wow!” Get this:
HE WROTE
BACK TO ME!!! DOUBLE WOW, now I’m really someone...)

So every time I think I’ll change my registration, I learn some new trick or
other that makes
me stop and wonder if I’m ready for the big league....

A month ago I joined a game, selo, as Turkey. I took the opportunity to stab
Russia and
Austria in successive turns. Both worked perfectly (one year on, both
Austria and Russia
have been eliminated from the game) and another player wrote to inform me
that my play
was in no way indicative of a newbie, and did I know that this game was for
newbies? I was
flattered, but shades of guilt rose up in me. Was I a wolf among sheep?

So, when is a newbie not a newbie?

When you’ve been playing for a couple of months?
When your dedication rating goes over 100?
When you’ve played a game through to its completion (win or lose)?
When you get your first solo victory?
When you feel guilty?

So, here it is, Joe’s Rule: If you can communicate with and through the
Judges and
understand the rules of the game, and have played for a couple of months,
you ain’t no
newbie no more.

It is unfair for veteran Diplomats to play in games designed for newbies. On
the other hand,
don’t underestimate newbies. I’m observing a newbie game at the moment where
Russia was
somehow allocated to a player with over 400 dedication points. He was hit in
1901 from
three sides, and had to disband two of his units in the Winter phase. I don’
t think he’s got
much chance of surviving 1902. Mighty brutal, dem newbies....

Should I have felt guilty for joining a fifth game as a newbie? Even as a
replacement? In
hindsight, I don’t think so. I’m still learning some fundamental stuff (like
list). Besides, a
total idiot might have played Turkey more poorly, but the opportunities were
glaring, and
other players in the game were not reticent in giving me advice that caused
Turkey to grow
quickly. Now I’m stuck up against a huge Italy, and I don’t think there’s a
lot of room for
growth. But that’s my problem, isn’t it?

But now I’m ready to move on. So if I can just work out again what my
international phone
number is, I’ll re-register as an intermediate player. I’m ready (I
think...) to go into the world
of gunboat diplomacy, so that I can compete against Manus, Simon, Dan, and
all those other
big names from the DipPouch. I’ll show them how to really play the game....

Joe the village idiot
