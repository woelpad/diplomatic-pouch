?So, you think you’re a Diplomat?

Blurb: Joe points out some extraordinary acts of Diplomacy from the past,
and presents you
with a challenge or two...

Do you? Think you’re a capable Diplomat? Aagh, you wouldn’t last five
seasons in Ancient
Athens. They ostracised their famous leaders for ten years, simply because
the leaders were
becoming too good at their job!

Themistocles was ostracised after he single-handedly organised the salvation
of his people
from Persian aggression. So he left Athens and spent the rest of his life in
luxury at the court
of the Persian King.

Aristides was recalled from his exile to organise the Athenian army at the
Battle of
Marathon. A runner/diplomat was sent to the mighty Spartan army to ask for
their help. He
was told, “Sorry, we’re celebrating a religious festival”. The unsuccessful
diplomat,
Pheidippides, returned to Marathon, and was then asked to run to Athens with
news of the
battle. He ran a total of 220 kilometres, delivered his urgent message, then
dropped dead.
(I’ve heard worse excuses for not assisting in an attack, but only around a
certain game
table.)

When the Greeks met to discuss which city should lead the allied navy
against Persia,
Themistocles the Athenian put his own name forward. He had organised the
building of 200
warships, by far the largest navy in Greece. He was refused, because Athens
was known for
its deceptive ways. Instead, they chose a Spartan soldier, Eurybiades,
because they felt he
was incorruptible. Not only did Themistocles bribe him with huge amounts of
silver, but
when Themistocles could not persuade Eurybiades to defend Athens,
Themistocles sent a
message to the Persian King, outlining how the Greek fleet could be
surrounded and
destroyed. (Sounds like the Payola variant.) The battle was fought at
Salamis, and the Greeks
won an extraordinary victory.

For a tale of valour and foul treachery, can we pass by the efforts of
Leonidas? Battle King of
Sparta, he led a small force of soldiers to the northern pass of
Thermopylae, to withstand the
might of the entire Persian army while the rest of Greece celebrated (you
guessed it) a
religious festival. For two days he held the pass, until a traitor showed
the Persians a route
through the mountains. With forces surrounding him, Leonidas told his allies
to go home and
save themselves. The Thebans said they would continue to stand by him and
his 300
Spartans. As the Persians advanced, the Thebans changed sides. The Spartans
continued to
fight on until their spears broke. Then they fought on until their King
died. Then they fought
on till they were all dead. The loss of life among the Persians was so great
that their King
ordered most of the dead to be buried away from the battlefield, before
inviting observers
from the Persian fleet.

Years later, Sparta and Athens warred with each other for decades.
Alcibiades, a great
Athenian soldier and statesman, was instructed to take a force and defeat
Syracuse (an ally of
Sparta’s in Sicily). While he was preparing, his political enemies broke off
the penises of
several statues of Hermes. (Hermes was extremely well endowed.) Alcibiades
was blamed,
but before he could be executed for the trumped up charge, he fled to Sparta
and was well
received there.

At the naval battle of Arginusae, Athens won a great victory. Her six
admirals ordered
Theramenes to pick up the shipwrecked survivors, but did not due to bad
weather. Upon
arriving back at Athens, charges were brought against the admirals for the
loss of these
castaways. All six were sentenced to death, but questions have since been
asked about the
fairness of the trial, in which the defence was curtailed, and the
prosecutor was none other
than Theramenes! Yes, treachery abounded in the ancient world. Oops, I
forgot to mention;
Theramenes was later killed by his friend Critias - something about not
being supportive
enough of Critias’ government...

The King of Lydia told his Guards’ Captain to watch his wife undress and see
if she was not
the most beautiful woman in the world. Although the Captain thought it
wrong, the King
testified that only barbarians would be ashamed to display their naked
bodies. He watched,
she noticed, and told him that he must kill himself or the King. The Captain
killed the King
and ruled in his stead, marrying the Queen to cement his sovereignty. Oh
yes, treachery
abounded.

Phillip II, the father of Alexander the Great, conquered Greece from his
northern kingdom of
Macedonia. He did so by making clever alliances and finding unusual pretexts
for hostilities.
As soon as he died, all of Greece went into rebellion.

But what is the point of all this?

What do I really want?

Was all this written just to entertain you?

Or was there a more devious purpose?

Could it be that I wish to interest you in joining ares1, the eight player
Diplomacy variant on
USTR?

Well, yes, but I also have a little request for you. Join a variant. Design
the most
extraordinary stab. And do it. Stab stab stab. I want to hear about it. See
if you can do
anything like the Ancient Greeks did. Don’t be satisfied by stabbing for the
usual reasons.
Say to yourself, I want to do an extraordinary stab. Maybe futile, maybe
magnificent, but
when asked why, or why not, you should have an answer that’s at least as
good as, “We were
celebrating a religious festival” or “he chopped the penis off my statue”.

Joe, the village idiot.
