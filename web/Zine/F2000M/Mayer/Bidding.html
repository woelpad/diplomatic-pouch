<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>Payola is a Diplomacy variant with an added layer between the players and
the units. Each player manages an account of silver pieces (AgP), which is
used to offer
bids in an effort to get units to do issue orders to the player's liking.
The finances of each power are
incremented after each build phase by an amount determined by the number of
supply centres under that power's control. </P>

<P>Just as in Diplomacy, Payola has two movement phases for every "payoff"
phase. Players have to decide how to distribute AgP over multiple seasons and
multiple units to achieve some strategic goal. Pitt Crandlemire, the 1996 World
Champion, brought up the question of how to distribute financing in his Pouch
Zine article <A
HREF="http://www.diplom.org/Zine/S1996M/Pitt/Dipper.html">The Big Dipper Looks at Payola</A>.  In that article,
Pitt suggested that players divide Spring and Fall spending about evenly. Manus
Hand, inventor and 'owner' of Payola, examined actual player behaviour in a typical game in
<A
HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/W1995A/Payola/strategy.html">some
notes on Payola strategy</A>.
Manus concluded that players tended to split spending between Fall and Spring
about 2:1. Neither of these articles, however, looked at the distribution question systematically.
</P>

<P>In this article I will be introducing a method to help with AgP distribution
decisions. The method presupposes a player has set a value on a strategic
goal to be achieved and a time span in which to achieve that goal. Although the
method is conceived to apply to <I>theatre engagements</I> (isolated battles
between two players where all involved units give highest priority to the
strategic goal for the duration of the engagement), the method might also be
applicable to more complicated situations.
What we will find is that it will turn out that a split of
at least 2-1 between Fall and Spring spending is indeed quite good rule of
thumb for many positions, with higher factors being more appropriate for closed
positions. </P>

<P>To illustrate the method, I will be using a toy domain. A toy domain is
simplification of the space in which an algorithm is applied. Toy domains are
often used for concept generation and sanity checking. I've chosen my toy
domain to elucidate the concepts behind the method. Later I will have to
generalise to Payola Diplomacy, or I will have failed to show that the method is
valid for that, more complicated, domain. </P>

<P>The toy domain I chose (from an idea in Manus's <A
HREF="http://www.diplom.org/Zine/W1995A/Payola/notes.html">Payola
annotations</A>)
is Payola Tic-Tac-Toe [which I will abbreviate as "PT3"]. PT3 is like the
familiar game in which X's and O's are
alternately placed on a three-by-three matrix. However,
instead of the two players each being
in control of the placement of either all of the X's or all of the O's
(respectively), placement is
decided, like in Payola Diplomacy, by the highest bid.
Some rules for PT3 are: </P>

<OL>
<LI>There is always a winner. The X player wins by getting three in a row. If the X player fails to win, then victory goes to the O player. </LI>
<LI>Players are given a sum of 'money' in continuous units  -- think silver <i>dust</i> instead of Payola Diplomacy's silver coins -- at the start of the game. The motivation for using continuous units is to simplify handling of tie bids. In case of a tie bid the O-player's choice is given precedent. </LI>
<LI>Players have to make their money last until the end of the game. There are no income phases.</LI>
<LI>As in Payola Diplomacy, accounts are debited by the amount of successful bids.</LI>
<LI>Successful bids are published each 'season.' In effect each player knows the other player's account balance.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Before demonstrating the optimal strategy for PT3, I'd like to note some of the essential differences between PT3 and Payola Diplomacy:</P>
<OL>
<LI>PT3 is a zero sum game. There are no opportunities for cooperation.</LI>
<LI>PT3 is guaranteed to end after a finite number of seasons.</LI>
<LI>There is only one unit to be bid on each season (either an X or an O,
in turn -- in Payola Diplomacy, all units on the board are always "on the
auction block").</LI>
<LI>There are differences about how money is handled (no income seasons, continuous currency, and especially open account books).</LI></OL>
</ol>

<H3>The Method Applied to Payola Tic-Tac-Toe</H3>
<P>The first step in illustrating the method will be to show how PT3 can be
played on a tree instead of on a matrix.</P>

<P>The 'root' of the tree corresponds to the null state (empty 3x3 matrix). The
'daughters' of each node are then all of the possible positions that can arise in
the next move. If we ignore the symmetry of certain configurations, the root
of the tree has nine daughters, 72 grand-daughters (eight for each of the nine daughters) and so
on. The sequence of moves in a game can be described by a path through the
tree. </P>

<P>Each branch of the tree must ultimately end in a victory for either the
X-player or the O-player. Thus all lowest level nodes (leaves) can be marked
with a X or an O to show the victor. Any parent nodes for which <i>all</i>
the daughter nodes are the same can also be marked with either an X or
an O (whichever the daughter nodes contain).  These are positions from
which a player can force a victory (regardless of the account
values).
We will call any node that is marked (with an X or an O) a "leaf."
Examples of positions which are O-Leaves
are shown in Figure 1:</P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER"><IMG SRC="Image3.gif" WIDTH=286 HEIGHT=248></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 1: Examples of O-Leaves</P> </B>

<P>All nodes above the leaf level correspond to situations in which either
player could conceivably win. In this case the outcome will depend on the bids
of the two players as well as on their account balances. These mixed nodes are
marked <FONT FACE="Symbol">&Auml;.</FONT></P>

<P>Figure 2 shows what a typical pruned lower section of the PT3 tree might look like: </P>

<P ALIGN="CENTER">  <IMG SRC="Image4.gif" WIDTH=286 HEIGHT=248></P>
<B><P ALIGN="CENTER">Figure 2: Typical Pruned Section of the Payola Tic-Tac-Toe Tree </P> </B>

<P>Remembering that the lowest level nodes (leaves) consist exclusively of X's
and O's, it follows that the leaves' immediate antecedent's (their 'mother'
nodes) must be mixed.</p>

<P>We see that the player that reaches one of the lowest level mixed (non-leaf) nodes with
the most money can win by outbidding his opponent to reach one of "his" leaves.
The victory condition for the X-player at the lowest level mixed nodes is thus
A<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; A<SUB>O</SUB>, where A<SUB>X</SUB> and A<SUB>O</SUB> are the
account balances of the two players. </P>

<P>We want to show how to determine the victory condition at any node in terms of the victory conditions for its children nodes. Since we know the victory condition at the lowest level mixed nodes, we can repeat the procedure, propagating the victory condition all the way to the root, thereby solving PT3.</P>

<P>Suppose the (already determined) victory conditions for the X-player at each of the N mixed children nodes are given by:</P>
<dl>
<dd>
<P>A<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; b<SUB>1</SUB> * A<SUB>O</SUB>,
<br>A<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; b<SUB>2</SUB> * A<SUB>O</SUB>,  ...
<br>A<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; b<SUB>N</SUB> * A<SUB>O</SUB></P>
</dd>
</dl>
<P>where </P>
<dl><dd>
b<SUB>N</SUB> <FONT FACE="Symbol">³</FONT> b<SUB>N-1</SUB> <FONT
FACE="Symbol">³ </FONT>... <FONT FACE="Symbol">³</FONT> b<SUB>1</SUB>
</dd></dl>

<P>We assume b<SUB>N</SUB> <FONT FACE="Symbol">&gt;</FONT> b<SUB>
1</SUB>. If not, then the victory condition at the mother node is the
same as the victory condition at the children nodes. Two special cases are
b<SUB>k</SUB>= 0, corresponding to an X-node, and  b<SUB>k</FONT>
 = <FONT FACE="Symbol">¥</FONT>, corresponding to an O-node.</P>

<P>First let's look at the case where there are only two b values, b<SUB>
N</SUB> and b<SUB>1</SUB>, so that the X-player will bid some
amount D<SUB>X</SUB> on node 1 and bid zero on node N. We have to look
at two outcomes. Either the O-player outbids the X-player (by a minuscule
amount) to get to node N or else the X-player's bid is successful. For the
X-player to be sure of a win, she has to be able to succeed in both cases:</P>

<P>In the first case, we take A<SUB>NX</SUB> = A<SUB>X</SUB>
and A<SUB>NO</SUB> = A<SUB>O</SUB> - D<SUB>X</SUB>
where 'N' refers to account balances at the node N. Then for the X-player to
win we have to have</P>

<dl><dd>
A<SUB>NX</SUB> &gt; b<SUB>N</SUB> * A<SUB>NO</SUB>   that is A<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; b<SUB>N</SUB> * (A<SUB>O</SUB> - D<SUB>X</SUB>)     so that     D<SUB>X</SUB> &gt; A<SUB>O</SUB> - A<SUB>X</SUB> / b<SUB>N</SUB>
</dd></dl>

<P>In the second case we have to have </P>
<dl><dd>
A<SUB>1X</SUB> &gt; b<SUB>1</SUB> * A<SUB>1O</SUB>
</dd></dl>
that is
<dl><dd>
A<SUB>X</SUB> - D<SUB>X</SUB>  &gt; b<SUB>1</SUB> * A<SUB>O</SUB>
</dd></dl>
so that
<dl><dd>
D<SUB>X</SUB> &lt; A<SUB>X</SUB> - b<SUB>1</SUB> * A<SUB>O</SUB>
</dd></dl>

<P>The two inequalities on D<SUB>X</SUB> will be fulfilled if and only if </P>

<dd><IMG SRC="Image5.gif" WIDTH=156 HEIGHT=58></dd>

<P>This is the mother node victory condition for the X-player in case there are only two children nodes. </P>

<P>What about cases where there are more than 2 children nodes? Wouldn't it be possible to end up at some sister scenario K, with K between 2 and N-1? Yes, perhaps. But if both players act rationally this will not affect the victory condition. Here's why: the X-player will only bid an amount on scenario K that promises </P>
<dd><table><tr><td valign=center>
b<SUB>K</FONT> <FONT FACE="Symbol">£</FONT></td><td><IMG SRC="Image6.gif" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=58></td></tr></table></dd>

<P>where A<SUB>KX</SUB> &gt; b<SUB>K</sub> * A<SUB>KO</sub> is the victory condition at node K</P>

<P>Similarly, the O-player will only bid an amount on a scenario K that guarantees that </P>

<dd><table><tr><td valign=center>
b<SUB>K</SUB> <FONT FACE="Symbol">³</FONT></td><td><IMG SRC="Image6.gif" WIDTH=85 HEIGHT=58></td><tr></table>
</dd>
<P>Since neither the X- nor the O-player alone can force selection of a K
scenario with b<SUB>K</SUB> different from victory condition for X (nodes 1
and N), it follows that the presence of the nodes 2, .., N-1 do not affect the
victory condition. The optimal play for each player is to bid an amount between
A<SUB>O</SUB> - A<SUB>X</SUB> / b<SUB>N</SUB> and A<SUB>X</SUB> -
b<SUB>1</SUB> * A<SUB>O</SUB>. </P>
