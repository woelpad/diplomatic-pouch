<center><h2>Mission Impossible, Winning with France in Colonial</h2>

<p>The challenge facing France in Colonial Diplomacy is monumental.  I
can't imagine that anyone would dare say all powers have roughly equal
potential to win in Colonial, and France is the example most point to when
making this claim.  Still, their position is not entirely hopeless, and a
skilled diplomat will recognize that the French have a few advantages to
their credit.  A winning diplomat will further recognize that France's
neighbors have several glaring weaknesses to be exploited.

<p>France's position is intimidating primarily because of the size and
(relative) security of her neighbors.  France is surrounded on 3 sides by
British forces, with massive China looming to the north.  Beyond that
immediate perimeter lie Holland and Japan, naval powerhouses who often
reach French borders by the early midgame.  However, all of these powers
except Britain have long term interests that coincide with France's, and
even Britain can be suckered into temporary cooperation on occasion. 
France also occupies a key position in the minefield of SCs that is
Southeast Asia, allowing the potential for rapid expansion.  Holland and
Japan are more likely to oppose each other than dedicate excessive forces
to attacking France (presuming the French player is not fool enough to
build up his own navy and enter the race for the Philippines).  In all
likelihood then, France will face either Britain alone or a coalition of
China and Britain in the early stages of the game.  Your primary foreign
policy goal as France should be to prevent the formation of such a
coalition at all costs.  

<p>My favored initial ally as France is China.  Beset on all sides just
as France is, China often makes a good choice for a friend, since they are
probably looking for at least one, if not two, reliable allies to seal off
some of the threats that loom on their every border.  Unfortunately,
Britain can offer them the same incentive, and with a much higher payoff:
your rich French homelands.  So, to successfully seed discord between
Britain and China, you need to make concessions to one or both that
entangle their units, and use them as wedges to separate each other's
forces from you.  You have two initial opportunities to accomplish this: HK
and the Bengal area.  In both cases, Army Canton is the unit you want to
manipulate.  If Britain is fool enough to attack Canton on the first turn
from HK, by all means support him from Tongking.  Opening mission
accomplished on turn one, and you can bring Fleet Annam out to boot.  This
isn't likely though.  9 times out of 10 you will see F Annam and F HK butt
heads throughout the first year in the strategically invaluable South China
Sea.  

<p>Option Two is to draw Army Canton west towards the fertile lands of
Burma.  The key here is to try to get China to occupy Upper Burma rather
than Assam.  It is quite worth the risk to allow China uncontested passage
through Mandalay if he promises you that Upper Burma is his target. 
Rangoon and Bangkok should be your own targets for the first year in this
situation, and even if you do not successfully take Bangkok, creating a
wall of Chinese armies between yourself and the British in India is worth
its weight in SCs.  An eventual stab of China is advisable, preferably
coordinated with Japan or Russia.  Cooperation with Holland to attack
Malaya and Singapore is icing on the cake.  

<p>A bit of luck with either of these strategies sees France comfortably
established as the dominant power in SE Asia, Britain and China hopelessly
deadlocked and distrustful of one another, and Holland engaging Japan (or
better still, allied with you, and engaging Japan).  The key point to
remember is this: Despite the coastal position of all three of their home
SCs, France's true hope for victory is on the mainland.  In a variant that
requires so many SCs for victory, a sizable portion of the mainland must be
conquered, and the effort required to challenge and best Holland and Japan
in the naval race is neither prudent nor sufficient in itself for victory. 
Far better to be one of the many jackals that feeds off of a partitioned
Chinese state in the midgame than to embroil yourself in the hopeless naval
cause.  As is the case with all variants of Diplomacy, victory for France
in Colonial is a direct function of how well you can play your neighbors
off against one another.  So recognize the natural strengths and
inclinations that your neighbors have and use them to manipulate their
actions.
