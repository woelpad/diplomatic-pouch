<p>This article deals with opening strategies for the Chosokabe Clan in
   the Sengoku variant. For the uninformed, Sengoku is a historical
   transplant of Diplomacy to medieval Japan, during one of the most
   interesting periods in all of history, IMHO. To take a look at the map
   and house rules, visit the sengoku homepage at
   <a href="http://home.earthlink.net/~bthester777/sengokuhome001.htm">http://home.earthlink.net/~bthester777/sengokuhome001.htm</a>.
   
<p>Assuming you've got the map on screen in front of you, and at least
   browsed the house rules, most of this will be simple to follow.
   Players have typically avoided the Chosokabe assignment like the
   plague, and it's fairly easy to see why. They are surrounded on three
   sides, and isolated on an island (Shikoku). The knee-jerk reaction for
   most players has been to try and grab the two SCs closest to them,
   Bingo and Bungo (don't laugh, that's really what they're called), and
   then sail south to wreck the Shimazu clan alone. I've seen this done
   with mixed results, depending upon the generosity (to be read, skill)
   of the Mori and Miyoshi players. The following is a very tasty
   alternative strategy called the Lotus Blossom.
   
<p>Negotiations:
   
<p>w/Mori - Assure him that you're going to do exactly what 90% of
   Chosokabe players do: Take Bingo and Bungo, then build a fleet and an
   army to sail south and convoy over to Kyushu (Shimazu's home island).
   Don't actually do a single word of that after the part about taking
   Bingo and Bungo.
   
<p>w/Shimazu - Promise him whatever it takes to get him to send both
   fleets around the left side of Kyushu, and not bounce you in Bungo.
   Assure him that you are attacking Mori, and that Bungo is the only
   territory you want on Kyushu.
   
<p>w/Miyoshi - Smile, kowtow, promise never to enter Osaka Bay (that
   should be enough to get him off your back), and then ask Oda to keep
   him busy for a year or two.
   
<p>w/Oda - Ask him to keep Miyoshi busy for a year or two. : )
   
<p>w/Takeda and Uesugi - Try to get them tangled in Musashi bounces so
   that they can't effectively attack Oda for a few years.
   
<p>Now, on to the actual moves.
   
<p>Spring 1565 (the first year)
   
<p>Chosokabe Mori Shimazu
   
<p>F Iyo - Inland Sea F Iwami - S. Sea of Japan F Satsuma to E. China Sea
   
<p>F Tosa - Bungo Straits A Hagato - Iwami F Osumi - Satsuma
   
<p>Fall 1565
   
<p>Chosokabe
   
<p>F Inland Sea - Bingo, F Bungo Straits to Bungo.
   
<p>Hopefully, you were able to convince Mori to swing F South Sea of
   Japan to the fertile fishing grounds of Wakasa Bay in the fall. Mori A
   Iwami should have claimed Izumo. Shimazu should claim Chikugo, with an
   eye to neutral Hizen and the Korea Strait next year. A best case
   scenario has Mori building a fleet Iwami, but much more likely an army
   Iwami or Fleet Hagato. Try to get Shimazu to build a fleet in Satsuma,
   not an army or Fleet Osumi if it's at all possible.
   
<p>Spring 1566
   
<p>Chosokabe
   
<p>F Bingo supports F Iyo - Inland Sea, F Iyo - Inland Sea, A Tosa - Iyo,
F Bungo - Suo Sea.
   
<p>The ruse is up. Mori will probably soil his diapers, if he didn't
   already suspect something after the builds. Right now, you're going to
   know if this will work or not. If after the build, Mori is still
   convinced you're going after Shimazu, he will probably build a fleet
   in Hagato, and try to beat them to the Korea Strait and Tsushima.
   That's perfect for you. If he stayed at home with the build in Spring
   1566 though, it's time to abandon the Lotus Blossom before it's too
   late, and convert against Miyoshi or Shimazu. The ideal target here is
   Hagato, and if he's sitting there, especially with support, you've
   only got 50-50 (or worse) odds of successfully convoying onto the
   mainland. If he's in the Korea Strait, the convoy route is clear,
   since Suo Sea cannot be dislodged, nor Suo territory covered. See the
   following for an explanation why:
   
<p>Fall 1566
   
<p>Chosokabe
   
<p>Fleet Suo Sea C A Iyo - Suo, F Inland Sea S A Iyo - Suo, A Iyo - Suo,
   F Bingo holds.
   
<p>If you reach this point successfully, it's probably all over for Mori,
   and Shimazu as well if he doesn't act fast. Either the two units
   bordering Hagato will take it early next year, or you can force your
   way into the Korea Strait (via Chikuzen) and then to Mori's north
   coast with your fleets. Shimazu is too slow to fight his way past
   neutral Hizen and into the strategic Korea Strait before you can get
   one or the other. It's then a simple matter to swallow Shimazu whole
   bolstered by the Mori homeland builds. However, this plan is far from
   a sure thing. Mori has to fall for it from the very beginning. Even
   more importantly, Shimazu has to sweep the left side of Kyushu and
   allow you control of Bungo. Miyoshi has to stay disinterested or
   otherwise engaged throughout. Fortunately, each of these feats is
   quite possible, and a master diplomat just might manage all three at
   once.
