<p>Worldmasters2000 Email Diplomacy Tournament Begins!!

<p>Worldmasters2000, is now ready to start accepting players. Get together with
seven friends and form a team, or enter as an individual. Coming off the
success of Worldmasters99 which brought many of the top players from the Email,
Postal and FTF worlds together in one tournament for the first time, we have
every intention of building on this foundation to make the Worldmasters
tournaments the most respected and anticipated Diplomacy event in the world.

<p>The <a href="http://worldmasters00.diplomacy.org.uk">site for
Worldmasters</a>, http://worldmasters00.diplomacy.org.uk, will link you to
automated signup forms, news, history, rules and help answer your questions.
Among the prizes we will be offering this year are several copies of Alan
Calhamers book, On Diplomacy, signed by the author, as well as a generous
collection of board and computer games supplied by Hasbro, Gibson Games and
Midnight games to name a few.

<p>Sign up for the conference board at <a
href="http://webforum.cloud-nine.com/~worldmasters2000">http://webforum.cloud-nine.com/~worldmasters2000</a>.
The Conference board is where day to day communications and discussions will
take place.  Annoucements, chat and conferences to seek out other players to
form a team with are provided. We are using one of the oreilly webboards and
they are full of features which allow users to follow the topics via WWW, Email
or even with a Newsreader.

<p>We have a special fund raising effort under way to take advantage of the
free $5 signup that Paypals is giving out to new accounts. It is limited to US
residents at this time. If we can get a few hundred people to sign up we can
get a nice fund set up to cover the postage for sending prizes all over the
world. WM Home link above will guide you to the proper explanations.

<p>Worldmasters 1999 had 553 players on 79 teams. We are well into the semi
final round and hope to start the finalboard with seven sharks on or about
October 1st. Follow the action from the WM99 Finals page
http://worldmasters00.diplomacy.org.uk/m99_finals.html

<p>We are also beginning the process of having top teams and players select the
prizes they have earned so they can be sent out. News of this will be displayed
on the WM Home site.  Join us for the Wordmasters2000 Email Diplomacy
Tournament and meet players from North and South America, Australia and New
Zealand, Western and Eastern Europe as well as the Middle East, India, Africa
and Asia. Test your skills against the best in the world, or, if your just
learning, see how the sharks got their reputations.

<p>Don't delay, visit us and sign up today!
