<!-- article w/ H3 section headings -->

<p>A relative newcomer to the hobby, the first issue of the Pouch I
read was the Winter 1999 issue.  Suffice to say I was in love after the
first article I read.  The most interesting article I ran across was by our
esteemed publisher about a new Austrian opening: <a href=../../W1999A/Hand/bwl.html>The Blue Water Lepanto</a>.  At a recent
gathering of the Potomac Tea &amp; Knife Society (PTKS) I drew Austria and Tim
Richardson (also known in some circles as the Prince of Darkness) drew
Italy, so I knew right away it would be an interesting game.

<p>The base premise of the opening strategy, as Manus described the Blue
Water Lepanto, is that it is totally an Austrian show.  But Tim (Italy) approached me
right away and asked if I had read the article.  I said I had, but I was
foggy on some of the details.  We worked out our 1901 moves before our
Spring orders were due so that we wouldn't have to speak after I "broke our
deal." That way it would appear as if I had turned on him and we had nothing
to discuss.

<p>Negotiations with the other powers is critical to the success of the
opening.  I managed to negotiate a DMZ in Galecia with Russia and indicate
interest in a long-term arraingement with Austria as a land-based power and
Turkey as a sea-based power controling the Mediterranean &amp;  Black Seas.  To
cement our deal I told him that I would be opening anti-Italy, which to any
independent observer that would certainly seem to be the case.  In addition,
Tim secured a DMZ in Piedmont (which he would break).  All was prepared for
our Spring 1901 orders:

</center>

<p>So right now to an impartial observer it would appear that Italy is
poised two get two builds but has to cover his home center.  I look like I
am threatening Venice.  The DMZ in Galicia holds and Turkey believes I am
trustworthy.  Tim and I publicly acted as if I had violated our agreement.  I
told Turkey that I wanted Greece and avoided any discussion of Serbia.
Convincing Turkey of my need for Greece was simple - if I am to carry on the
attack on Italy then I need more armies.  It is critical that you not
discuss Serbia so that any bounce there can be shrugged off as a
misunderstanding.  Russia and I agreed to keep the DMZ in Galicia.
Meanwhile Tim was busy convincing France that he did not have to worry about
Marseilles because he would have to cover Venice.  Our deceptions complete,
we put in our Fall 1901 moves:

</table></center>

<p>I have been told since by players involved with the game that it
truly did appear as if Italy and I were no longer working together.  Only
one player may have seen through that, and that was Russia - but it wasn't
apparent yet.  However, after the moves had been read and I denied Turkey
any builds in the Balkans save Bulgaria, he was none too pleased.  I was
able to chalk up Serbia as a miscommunicaiton.  Russia held fast with
Galicia, although he was now having some reservations in his diplomacy.  Tim
and I met again, judging our moves as more of a reconciliation publicly.
Unfortuantely for France, he believed Tim and did not cover Marseilles.
Tim managed to get two builds for Italy, an impressive feat only surpassed
the next week when he managed to get three builds as Italy!  I sort of knew
he was going to go for Trieste, because he is a mischevious player, as
evidenced through the rest of the game, but ultimately he knew (as did I) it
would not go through so it was not a big deal.  We set about our plans for
the next year after he built a fleet in Naples and a fleet in Rome and I
built an army in Budapest.  We worked it out that I would try and hit one of
his supply centers, which I told everyone I planned to do.  He would move
his army to Apulia so it would be ready for the convoy in the fall.  I told
Turkey and Russia of my plans against Italy and both seemed happy I was
proceeding that way.  But either they were on to us, or felt that it was the
perfect time to scarf up some centers because Russia went into Galicia
without letting me know in advance and he also supported Turkey's move into
Serbia, which was bounced by my support from Greece for Budapest moving into
Serbia.  Here's how Spring of 1902 shaped up:

<center><table>

<td><tt>
F ION - NAP (*bounce, dislodged, retreats to AEG*)<br>

</table></center>

<p>Obviously Russia was hedging his bets.  He figured that either
Austria or Turkey was going to prevail in this situation and he wanted to be
sure that he would be in a position to hurt or help either side.  He did
that quite nicely and put Turkey into a panic.  Obviously the dislodgement
of my unit in the Ionian was a topic around the table, but my retreat was
considered questionable.  Everyone observed Italy attacking me and could not
figure out why I would choose to use the fleet against Turkey instead of
Italy.  Italy's move to Apulia probably should have tipped them off, but
Germany was growing fairly well, France was suffering from that growth and
from the Italian invasion of Marseilles, and Russia and Germany were working
together against England up north.  As you can see, everything was set to
convoy the Italian army in Apulia to Turkey.  Unfortunately, the Turk was
either clairvoyant or else he wanted to leave the Agean open for his fleet in
Constantinople, or he was working on a long term plan that involved Russia
sailing through Con in a spring year and then sailing into the Aegean to
support his naval activities.  (The last is probably most likely, as this
player used this tactic in a later game as well.)

<p>Eventually, we were able to get the Italian army to land with Russian
support.  Turkey was the only power eliminated in this game, which ended in
a three-way draw between Russia (9 centers), Austria (8 centers) and Italy
(7 centers) just before 1908.  It had some play in it and Austria had a
stronger strategic position on Italy and Russia, but who knows what would
have happened if play had continued.  The point of this article was to
demonstrate how the opening can be played jointly between the Italian and
the Austrian to the benefit of both powers.  At the time of the draw, France
was down to a single center (Portugal), and it was broken down primarily
because Italy was able to break across Piedmont in the first year.  This,
in turn, was made possible by the Austrian feint toward Italy, which aided
in convincing
France of his security.

<h3>Summary</H3>
The Blue Water Lepanto opening described by Manus in a previous article does
not necessarily have to be conducted without the cooperation of Italy.  In
fact, it can be a much more powerful opening for both powers if Italy is in
on the opening from the begining.  By giving Italy options in the east,
Austria can dominate play in the Balkans and eventually compete for Turkey,
Russia, and Germany in just a few years.  This opening does rely on intensive
diplomacy, and is not recommended to players that are not active diplomats.
However, if you are not an active diplomat, then you are probably doomed to
lose as Austria rather quickly!  This is just one case study of the opening,
and your results may differ, but conducting the opening with full knowledge
and cooperation from the Italian does seem to be a safe way to conduct the
opening
with very little risk to either either party from the other.

<p>Let me know what you think or if you have different experiences using this
opening.  It definitely ranks up there as a strong, deceptive opening for
both powers.
