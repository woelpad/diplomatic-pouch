I know that this sounds like pointless whining, but I really do have a
point. I've been occasionally visiting your site with Lynx and noticed
that the shortcut icons don't have ALT-texts - they are useless with only
text. I know that they do have texts included and that you have text
navigation in the bottom of each page, but why are you discriminating
text-based users even that much? Especially, as HTML standards *require*
ALT-tags for every image. It shouldn't be too much of a trouble, there's
no harm done to anybody and lots of joy for us Lynx-users and to other
people who surf without images. 

And hey, Stephen Agar fixed the same thing on Diplomacy Archive...
(though, his site was much worse)

Hey Manus,
Just read your article (and Simon's) about the convoy paradox. I think =
there is a third possible arbitration of that solution ... here it is:
The French convoy from Bre is broken because the French fleet in ENG is =
dislodged. It doesn't matter that the German and English fleet bounce, =
the ante for ENG that turn is 2 units, and the French fleet has no =
support, so it cannot keep ENG. Do you see what I am trying to say?
Cheers,
Fred Leusch

Just a thought - Why not add the following rule instead:

"For the purposes of resolving conflicts, a convoyed army acts as if 
attacking from the last fleet in it's convoy chain."

This would rather neatly (IMHO) solve the paradox, since support 
cannot be cut by a unit from the space you are supporting (Rule Ten, 
cutting support).  The french army would bounce, and the English and 
German fleets would stand off each other.  This wording would also 
allow you to convoy armies to cut other people's support, as well, 
which the current wording does not.

It's also good from a real world sense, too, since it doesn't 
introduce any new/strange elements into the game, it builds on 
already existing rules, and the wording is pretty straightforward.

Just my 2c worth :)

Anthony

Manus,

Below is a little item I wanted to include in the next issue of the
Zine.  I'm not sure if it would work best as a Deposit or as an article.
It's not really an article, so I would say a Deposit.  The only reason
for putting it in as an article would be for better exposure since my
one hesitation with having a Deposit would be that it would easily be
missed.  If you also think it should be a Deposit, could I impose on 
you by requesting that it receive top or near-top billing to improve 
the chances of it not being overlooked?  Thanks!

- Simon


Wanted: Editions of Diplomacy and Information About Them

I'm putting together a chronology and gallery of various editions of
Diplomacy that have been put out.  I've identified around 20 different
editions as well as several editions of Diplomacy variant games, and
there are probably some that I don't know about.  Below is a list of
editions I know about:

UNITED STATES 
  Allan Calhamer: 1958
  Games Research Inc.: 1961, 1971
  Avalon Hill Game Co.: 1976, 1982, 1992 (Deluxe edition)
  New Avalon Hill Game Co. (Hasbro): 1999 (copyright 1999, released 2000)
UNITED KINGDOM
  Intellectual Diversions: several editions
  Gibson's Games: Two different editions, both copyright 1989
CANADA
  Waddington's House of Games: one edition has rules copyright 1974 and
      a map copyright 1971, a different edition has a gameboard with a
      gold-colored backing.
  Waddington Sanders: 1986
FRANCE 
  Parker: 1978
  Descartes Editeur: 
AUSTRALIA
  Jedko:
NETHERLANDS
  Jumbo:
GERMANY
  Parker: 1977
DIPLOMACY VARIANTS (ALL FROM UNITED STATES)
  Colonial Diplomacy: 1994
  Machiavelli - Battleline Games: 1977
  Machiavelli - Avalon Hill: 1980, 1983, 1995
  (Rumors regarding Hundred, Classical, Ard-Ri)

I would be interested in any information anyone has about editions
that are not on the above list.  If you know of an edition that is
not listed above, please let me know.  

Although I have been slowly gathering information about the editions
listed above, in several cases my information is not complete,
particularly for those editions that were published outside of the 
United States.  If you have an edition of Diplomacy from outside of
the U.S. and would be willing to provide me with some information,
please drop me an email.

Lastly, there are several non-U.S. editions that I would be interested
in obtaining.  If you have an edition of Diplomacy from outside the U.S.
and would be willing to consider selling or trading it, please let me
know.

Thanks very much.  I hope to have the chronology and gallery up on the
web in one of the Fall issues of the Pouch Zine.

It seems to me that an alternative way of fixing the paradox problem would be to make a fundamental alteration to the rules and say that if the total force trying to move in to a region is greater than the total force occupying that region then the unit occupying the region is forced to retreat. This is surely nearer the real-life situation, in that someone sitting in the middle of the battlefield is going to get rather shot up. In the example given, this would result in F(ENG) being forced to retreat, the convoy being broken and everything else bouncing. I can't think of any obvious ways in which it would result in new inconsistencies, provided it is applied uniformly and not just when paradoxes occur.
If I've missed something obvious, then sorry for wasting your time; otherwise, is this change too fundamental or what are your opinions on it?

Yours,

Peter Taylor

Paradox:
My 'gut feeling' is based on the idea that a convoy is weaker than an attacking unit. In all that violence happening in the English Channel the convoy wouldn't have a chance. Therefore proposal 2 seems more logical.

Oops!.. You Stabbed Me Again!

New lyrics: Mikko Saari (msaari@iki.fi)
Original: "Oops!.. I Did It Again!" by Britney Spears

I think you did it again 
You made me believe, we're more than just friends
Oh baby,
It might seem like a stab
But it doesn't make me angry
'Cause to lose all my centers, that is just so typically me
Oh baby baby

Oops, you stabbed me again
You played with my heart, that lost me the game
Oh baby baby
Oops, thought you were my friend, that you were sent from above
You are not that innocent

You see my problem is this: I'm dreamin' away
Wishing that carebears they truly exist
I cry watching the results
Can't you see I'm a fool, in so many ways
But to lose all my centers, that is just so typically me, baby
Ohhhh   

-Turkey, before you go there's something I want you to have.
-Oh it's beautiful! But wait a minute isn't this... Bulgaria?
-Yes, yes it is!
-But I thought that Austria took it from me in the end
-Well baby, I went there and got it for ya
-Oh, you shouldn't have!

Oops, you did it again to my centers
I got eliminated from the game, oh baby
Oops, I thought you were sent from above
You are not that innocent
