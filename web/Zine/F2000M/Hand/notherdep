Dear Mr. Hand,

Attached is an article I wrote about France and Austria in No Press games. I
am hoping that you may be able to use it in an up coming issue of the Dip
Zine.

In Pouch Deposits, you often ask an interesting question in order to
generate mail (e.g. your favourite border).  I would like readers to send in
games that had the most number of units destroyed in it and the power that
destroyed the most units in one game.

I will make the first contribution with USEF bk131. The attached excell
spreadsheet tabulates the number of units destroyed in the game (14), and
who destroyed them.  In that game I destroyed 8.5 units as Austria (you
share a destruction point if you support another power).  For this result I
would like to claim the title of "Franz the destroyer" ;) , unless of course
someone has done better.

The other question I would be interested in seeing is the longest convoy in
a game.  I imagine there would be two categories; ones that were serious and
ones that were done for the fun of it.

Thanks, I love the Dip Pouch, kept up the good work,

John Young
