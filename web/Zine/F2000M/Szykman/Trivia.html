<H3 align=center><i>By Simon Szykman</i></H3><hr WIDTH="100%"></center>
<p>As part of building a collection of Diplomacy games, I've been doing
a fair amount of research into the various editions of the Diplomacy boardgame
over the past few months.  The culmination of this research will appear in the next issue of the zine.  In the meantime, I've extracted from this
pile of information a bunch of trivia questions which range from simple ones to ones that I don't expect many people (if any) to answer.  Although
difficult questions are included, I tried to limit them to ones that were
not too esoteric so that even people who don't know an answer would learn
a bit of information they found interesting when they learned the answer.
<p><br><ol><center><h3>The Editions</h3></center><p><li>Who designed
the boardgame Diplomacy?  (Yeah, that's an easy one but some of these may
be pretty hard for most people so I thought I'd include a giveaway question
to make up for it.) <p><li>In what year was Diplomacy first commerially
sold?<br>(a) 1954<br>(b) 1958<br>(c) 1959<br>(d) 1961<p><li>Which of the following has never been used as a material for fleet and army pieces
in a commercially-sold (i.e. not homemade) Diplomacy game?<br>(a) Wood<br>
(b) Plastic<br>(c) Metal<br>(d) Cardboard<br>(e) None of the above<p>
<li>In what year was the Avalon Hill bookcase edition with plastic pieces first
sold? <p><li>Which company sold the edition of Diplomacy shown in the image below?<p><img src=DipBox.jpg><p><br><center><h3>The Companies</h3></center>
<p><li>Name as many countries as you can in which local editions of Diplomacy
have been sold.  The use of the word "local" is meant to exclude countries
where  Avalon Hill editions were imported and sold with a translated rulebook.
<p><li>In the U.K., two different kinds of pieces have been used for fleets:
flat elongated 5-sided polygons, and pieces shaped like little ships.  One
company sold sets with both kinds of pieces (at different points in time,
not both types in one box).  Name that company.<p><li>Name the first company
to license rights to produce and sell the game Diplomacy outside of the United States.<p><li>Name the second company to license rights to produce
and sell the game Diplomacy outside of the United States.<p><li>Which company published editions of Diplomacy in two different languages,
neither of which was English?<p><li>Which company released a bootleged
version of Diplomacy (i.e., a version of Diplomacy which was sold without
having licensed the rights to the game).<p><br><center><h3>Diplomacy Around
the World</h3></center><p><li>In what year was Diplomacy first sold outside
of the United States?<p><li>In which country was Diplomacy published with
a bilingual rulebook?<p><li>Name two countries in which three different
companies from outside the United States at one time or another sold local-language
editions of Diplomacy.  (Note that "companies from outside the United States"
is intended to exclude things like Avalon Hill editions that were exported
to other countries and sold with translated rulebooks.)<p><br><center><h3>The
Variants</h3></center><p><b>Note:</b> In this context, "variants" refers
to <i>commercially published and sold</i> games (other than Diplomacy) that
are designed around the same core mechanics of Diplomacy.  In other words,
this includes variants whose rules are identical to those of Diplomacy, as well as those games which may have many substantially new concepts but
whose underlying mechanics are built upon those of Diplomacy.  <p><li>Name
as many commercial Diplomacy variants as you can.<p><li>Which commercial
variants were eventually re-published with gameboards having a revised map
which differed from the original one?<p><li>Which variants were eventually
re-published in a box that differed from the original one?<p><br><center><h3>Teaser</h3></center>
<p><li>How many different local editions of Diplomacy have been published
throughout the world?  (Note: Just coming close on this question is good
enough.  I assume that my own information is not exhaustive, and that there
are very likely editions of the game that I don't know about, so I wouldn't
presume to say that I know what <b>the correct answer</b> is.)<p>In the
context of this question, two editions are considered to be different if
anything relating directly to the game is at all different (even subtly)
in one edition than in the other.  Things that <b>do</b> relate directly
to the game include the box design, gameboard, pieces, rulebook, rule summary
sheets, play-by-mail Diplomacy information sheets, etc.  Things that <b>do
not</b> relate directly to the game are things that are not specific to Diplomacy which might be found in boxes for other games, such as marketing
materials, flyers advertising gaming conventions or organizations, catalogs
of games from the company selling the game, information on ordering replacement
parts, etc.  And as with an earlier question, the term "local" is meant to exclude Avalon Hill editions that were imported to other countries and
sold with translated rulebooks.<p>Why is the above question called a teaser?
 Because I'm not going to give you the answer to that one.  You'll have to wait until the next issue.<p></ol><center><b>Answers to the other questions
