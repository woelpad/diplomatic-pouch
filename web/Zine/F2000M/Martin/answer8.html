<P><b>Build 2 Armies and Go Fight Germany!</b> No, no no no no no no. This is
the absolute LAST thing to do at this point. Before taking ANY action against
Germany, you MUST consolidate your position. Sure, you can do a lot of damage
to Germany, but while your forces cross that neutral ground of
Tyrol/Bohemia/Galicia/Silesia, Italy and Turkey are going to have a field day
in your rear. And why not? You may well get to Berlin and Kiel -- but they'll
be the only centers you own when you get there! Heck, even if you do manage to
hold on down in the south, it will be at the expense of the units it would take
to do serious harm to Germany -- and then who is the big winner? England,
that's right!

<P>This is a very different situation  than in our first examples.  There, we
had a fairly secure position, and we gained an ally as we turned our coat.
Here, we've just stabbed Russia, then Turkey, then Italy -- not one of them is
likely to forget that while you go and fight Germany!
