<P>Not just no, Hell No! Sherlock Holmes may be able to come up with a
plausible means of denying England the solo without Russia, but in a F2F game,
that's a chance you just can't take. One mis-order, especially with mixed units
like this, and it's all over! No, with England at 16, you cant run the risk of
losing StPete. Heck, StPete can still be taken -- but not easily, nor quickly.
Time is a factor. You stopped the leader, take your draw and be happy!
