<title>Answer 10</title></head><body bgcolor=ffffff>
<P><b>Build an Army and A Fleet and finish off Italy and Turkey!</b> Yes, this
is the answer I like best. Regardless of what Italy pulls, he is in for serious
trouble. If he keeps two armies and he can't hold the Ionian. Two fleets and he
can't hold Rome. With the builds you gain from the Italian spoils, you can
finish off Turkey. Should you be concerned about Germany getting a solo? Heck
yes! But look at England and France! France has got his armies lined up against
Germany, and England is going to send her Navy screaming back north. At the
very least Germany's got a helluva fight on his hands, and at worst he wont'
make any progress at all! And that puts you, my friend, in the cat-bird seat.
With England and France committed to holding down Germany, and Germany
committed to building Fleets to fight them, you can afford to take some time to
. . .  do what?  You guessed it, Follow Through!  Worst case scenario, France
waffles and goes back to Iberia for some dots, and Germany crashes through into
Paris and London -- but you aren't going to let France do that, right? You'll
be working the board!
