<br><i>Aggressive Play in Face-to-Face Diplomacy</i></H2>
<H3 align=center>By Chris Martin</H3>

<!-- article w/ H3 section headings -->

<P>It's been two years since WDC VIII, where I was lucky enough to come home with the win, after which I wrote in these pages, "be the little guy."  Since that time, I've played in a bunch of tournaments, e-mail and F2F, and I've been forced to come to an unpleasant conclusion:</P>

<P>I am <u>not</u> a little guy anymore.</P>

<P>While this has its definite downside (being attacked in 1902 by four other powers is a bit excessive, I think.  Three?  Sure, I understand that.  But four?  <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>), it's not all bad.  Nonetheless, the approach which took me to the top just hasn't been sufficient to keep me there.  My challenge has been this:  How to compete with the Sharks, when I can no longer slip in under their radar?  As it happens, I have learned a thing or two about swimming with Sharks, and here are a few thoughts that might help <i>you</i> win!</P>


<h3>Part 1. Think Long-Term</h3>

<P>This is something that seems obvious, right?  You have to think long term in order to win.  But what does &quot;thinking long term&quot; mean, really?  In my book, it means never losing sight of your overall objective:  eighteen dots.</P>

<P><i>Gasp!</i>  I hear people reeling in shock even as I write.  The goal is eighteen dots?!?  Yuppers.  Everytime you sit down at the table to play, you and your fellow players are trying to get  more than half of those lovely little black dots.  Now, the purpose of this article isn't to tell you <I>which</I> 18 dots to get --  look elsewhere on this fine site for that info.  All I want to impress on you is that you must consider your long-term goal when making decisions early on.</P>

<P>An example:  France and England are co-operating in the destruction of Germany.  In the process of the attack, England takes Belgium, with the &quot;understanding&quot; that upon capture of German home SC's, France would be given Belgium.  Not, I think, an uncommon arrangement.  </P>

<P>With this accomplished in 1901, the allies move on:  England builds a fleet in Edinburgh and an army in London.  France builds an army in Paris and a fleet in Marseilles.  In S1902 ,  France moves into Burgundy and Ruhr, and England positions units.   Here's the S02 map:</P>

<center><table border=5><tr><td>
<IMG SRC="Image8.jpg" WIDTH=667 HEIGHT=508></td></tr></table></center>

<P>Okat, you're England   you're thinking long term.  France is planning on swinging the fleet into the Mediterranean, cutting Kiel's support, and pushing his Marseilles army into Piedmont.</P>

<P>You write the orders!</P>

<P>Ok, if you came up with:</P>
<dd>
<tt>
F North Sea C A London -&gt; Holland
<br>A London -&gt; North Sea -&gt; Holland
<br>A Belgium S A London -&gt; Holland
</tt></dd>

<P>Then you made the right call! </P>

<P>Sure, there are other options, but this puts both your armies on the continent, where you will have a say in what happens later....</P>

<P>So, here is the map after the Fall turn:</P>

<center><table border=5><tr><td>
<IMG SRC="Image9.jpg" WIDTH=667 HEIGHT=508></td></tr></table></center>

<P>So far, so good!  Things are looking smashing for the F/E alliance.  So, what do you build?  And why?  And what is your next goal?  Your next step on your quest for the elusive eighteen?  Let's look at your next logical areas of acquisition:</P>

<ol>
<li><b>Scandinavia</b>
<br>Sweden, Denmark, and St. Pete are good centers to have, and would put you up to nine   though you'd probably have to give France Belgium, as you promised you would, back when.</P>

<li><b>Northern Germany</b>
<br>Denmark, Berlin, and Kiel  are also a good three to have.  Together you and France can probably take these centers in a couple of years.  Again, Belgium goes to France, leaving you at eight.</P>

<li><b>Coastal France</b>
<br>Brest, Spain, and Portugal are fine centers to have.  <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>  They go a long way to preventing the rise of a naval power who can challenge you in the next few years.  As a handy side note, you get to keep Belgium!  </P>
</ol>
<P>So, which choice do you make?  Most folks will go for a combination of 1 and  2, trusting their superior position to keep them safe from a French stab.  And this is not a <i>bad</i> strategy -- lots of folks will get a nice three- or four-way draw out of it.  Owning St. Pete, Scandinavia, Northern Germany, and Holland puts you at ten centers, a very respectable England in any tournament.  However, this position will <i>not</i> get you to 18 -- no way, no how.  Because while you are busy doing all of this, France is busy gobbling up Italian dots, possibly getting as far as Northern Austria.  Barring the total collapse of Russia, the other eight dots you need would have to come from France.</P>

<P>And this is where the long term thinking comes in.  France is understandably worried about your intentions at this point,   so be as friendly as can be --  go for the &quot;friendly, alliance-building&quot; choice.  Build a fleet in Edinburgh, and move in the Spring thusly:</P>

<center><table border=5><tr><td>
<IMG SRC="Image10.jpg" WIDTH=667 HEIGHT=508></td></tr></table></center>

<P>Now, in this example, we were lucky enough to get German support for the move to Sweden -- that won't happen everytime, but it shouldn't be too hard a sell:   Germany is looking for a friend, right?  But here we've made a strong bid for the Scandinavian centers, France is mollified, and dare we say . . . unsuspecting?  So what shall we do now?  Fall is coming;   Russia is understandably upset.  What do you do now?  Take St. Pete with the army, cutting the Gulf of Bothnia's support?  Support yourself into Denmark, cutting Kiel's support from Holland?  Not <i>bad</i> choices, either of them...or you could do this:

<center><table border=5><tr><td>
<IMG SRC="Image11.jpg" WIDTH=667 HEIGHT=508></td></tr></table></center>

<P>Okay, now what have we done here? </P>
<ol>
<li>We left Russia Sweden, but took St. Pete   with a fleet!  He also lost Rumania to Austria, you'll note.  So he'll remove two units -- which two do you think he'll pull?  (We're betting on the fleet in Finland and the army from St. Pete.) Austria is all over him, while we have shown a lot of restraint, yes?  This will help to prevent any explosive growth from the other end of the board, something to be concerned when one is going for eighteen.</P>

<P><li>We bounced France out of Belgium.   He didn't support himself in -- why should he, good friends that he thought us to be?  And we, at the same time, did right by Germany, telling him that we were vacating Holland for him, that France was stabbing us for Belgium at the same time, and that we were trying to bounce Russia with the fleet to the Baltic -- I mean, we wouldn't move to the Baltic like that for no reason, right?  </P>

<p><li>We  also have two fleets on the Mid-Atlantic, which means that, in the long term, France is ours.  The minute he pulls his fleets back from Italy, he loses Tunis.  Portugal is also a lock, in the fall of next year.
</ol>
<P>This was the turning point.  We stabbed France before he could profit from his Italian gains.  We left Russia the ability to fight Austria.  We put ourself in position to continue to take German dots.  In the end, given enough time, England should own

<ul>
<li>Home (3)<li>Scandinavia (3 more; that makes 6)<li>Lowlands/St. Pete (9)
<li>Germany (12)<li>France (15)<li>Iberia (17)   and
<li> any one of Tunis, Venice, Moscow, or Vienna makes 18!</P>
</ul>

<P>The very important point here is that you had to make the crucial decision in 1903.  You can't start to think long-term early enough.  This is just one example, of course, and it could easily go wrong.  Taking the ten center three-way draw is <i>safer</i>, of course.  It's a good choice if you are looking to do well in the tournament.  But if you aren't a little guy, and you have to get your points the hard way, then you have to look for those eighteen dots in <i>every game</i>.   They won't always be there, but if you never look, you'll very rarely find them.  And waiting until the middle of the game before you start looking, I'm afraid, is too late.</P>

<H3>Part 2. Help Your Ally Help Yourself (To His Centers)</h3>

<P>Okay, in the first example, we looked for the opportunity to get to eighteen centers.   Here, in our second section, we will examine ways to encourage one's ally to take a position which, while appearing to be advantageous to them, in fact leaves them open for the blade.</P>

<P>Some of you may remember some advice I gave a while back:   &quot;Alliance play wins Tournaments.&quot;   I hold that this is true.  The problem, of course, is that one runs the risk of one's ally doing better than oneself!   So, we need to see how we can shape our alliance so that our ally doesn't do quite as well as we do.  To help us with this, lets take a page from another noted author,   Stephen Agar, in his Pouch article &quot;<a href="http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/snail.htm">Prising the French Snail From His Shell</a>.&quot;</P>

<P>We looked at England last time, so this time, let's take the German point of view.  Let's come up with a set of choices that succeed in our objective of removing France from the game, and leaving Germany in a markedly better position to continue to advance than England.  Take a quick moment to look over the Agar article, and then we'll sum up our options:</P>

<dl>
<dt><b>A. The D-Day Approach</b>
<dd>England: <tt>F Lon-ENG, F Edi-NTH, A Lon-Wal</tt>
<br>Germany: <tt>F Kie-Den, A Ber-Kie, A Mun-Ruh</tt>
<br>France: <tt>F Bre-MAO; A Par-Pic; A Mar-Spa</tt>

<P>And in the fall:</P>

<P>England:  <tt>F Eng C A Wal-Bel, A Wal-Bel, F NTH-Nwy</tt>
<br>Germany: <tt>A Ruh S A Wal-Bel, F Den-Swe, A Kie-Hol</tt>
<br>France:  <tt>A Pic-Bel (bounce), A Spa Hold, F MAO-Por</tt>
<P>
<dt><b>B. A Date for Dinner in Brussels?</b>
<dd>England: <tt>F Lon-NTH; A Lvp-Edi, F Edi-NWG</tt>
<br>Germany: <tt>F Kie-Den, A Ber-Kie, A Mun-Ruh</tt>
<br>France: <tt>F Bre-MAO, A Par-Pic, A Mar-Spa</tt>

<P>And in the fall:</P>

<P>England: <tt>F NTH C A Edi-Bel, F NWG-Nwy;</tt>
<br>Germany: <tt>F Den-Swe, A Ruh S ENGLISH A Edi-Bel, A Kie-Hol (or Mun if France is in Bur)</tt>
<br>France: <tt>F MAO-Por, A Spa Hold, A Pic-Bel</tt>

<P>England builds fleets in London and Liverpool. Germany builds a fleet in Kiel and an army in Munich. </P>
<P>
<dt><b>C. Everything Else</b>
<dd>The two options above leave out choices where Germany opens to Burgundy, so we'll leave that alone.  I note that Stephen has Germany bouncing Russia in Sweden without any comment.  I'll leave that alone as well, except to say that I would give a long hard look at allowing Russia to have Sweden in 1901 -- with another northern fleet build, Russia can be quite a thorn in England's side.  That, though, is really tangental to our focus, so, let's move on to our opening choices:  do we choose  A or B?</P>

</dl>
<P>Let's look at two boards, and see which Spring 1902 position we like more.</P>

<center><table border=5><caption><b>Option A.</b></caption><tr><td>
<IMG SRC="Image12.gif" WIDTH=717 HEIGHT=659></td></tr></table></center>
<P>
<center><table border=5><caption><b>Option B.</b></caption><tr><td>
<IMG SRC="Image13.gif" WIDTH=717 HEIGHT=659></td></tr></table></center>

<P>Well, a quick look shows small difference.   The English fleet is in the North Sea, or the English Channel.  Ah, but what a difference that makes!  The English Channel is a better position for <i>so</i> many reasons!  My thought here is that you, as Germany, want the English fleets around the horn as soon as possible.  Get England into the Western Mediterranean soon enough and he will be overextended.  Get him into Portugal, and make him defend it!  With England's fleets strung out around Iberia, and France defending against those fleets, you should be able to make greater gains.  Make sure you take advantage of this and turn it into a better position.  (For example, you can take Sweden with a fleet rather
than an army, placing your second fleet in Denmark, naturally!) </P>

<P>So, right from the outset, having decided to attack France, you want to get England to take the aggressive stance, the one that assumes the risks. With England in the Channel, he is practically committed to war with France, and thus he is nearly forced to build a fleet in Liverpool.   If he <u>isn't</u> in the Channel, he might well team up with France and come after <i>you</i>
in 1902!
<p>
This approach leaves you flexible, too.
If England and France bounce in the Channel, you haven't commited any acts of war, have you?  And if Russia looks to bounce England out of Norway, well, perhaps you should be working with France instead!  By encouraging a posture of attack which England cannot sustain without you, you allow yourself the option of yanking the carpet out from under him, and this is the important part, <i>should an appropriate moment arrive.</i>   </P>

<P>Don't take this as being a &quot;bad ally.&quot;  The cause of conquering France <I>is</I> being advanced   and England <I>is</I> profiting thereby.  But in choosing tactics, if you can gently nudge your ally into a position that leav es him
less well off than you down the line, well, so much the better for you!  And if it <i>does</i> work out for him, that's fine as well.  Sometimes a fast striking attack is the way to go, and you'll want to remain good allies with your partner long into the game --  perhaps through to the end.  It depends on what happens on the other side of the table.  As we saw in Part 1 of this article, its never too soon to think about your eighteen dots.  (As Germany, you don't <i>have</i> to get England's centers to get your solo, but it sure helps!)  So, let's go on to see what we can do to influence the other side of the board!</P>

<H3>Part 3. Work the Board</H3>

<P>In face-to-face play, there often isn't enough time to get to every other player every turn.  (In fact, this is one of the biggest weaknesses I see in e-mail players who come to face-to-face tournaments: the lack of ability to manage their time.)  Nonetheless, you <i>must</i> pay attention to the whole board, and use what influence you can to shape it.   In face-to-face play, because so few people take the time to work the board, it's a terrific way to get other people into, or out of, trouble.  </P>

<P>As a &quot;disinterested party,&quot; you can have a tremendous effect on who gets what from whom, and how.  As Turkey, you can sagely give advice to England on how to attack France, and then give France advice on how best to defend himself!  It's a little tougher as a central power, particularly as Italy -- everyone figures you've got something at stake.  Nonetheless, if you can build your reputation as a friend of the cause, you can do for the other side of the board what you did for your ally in Example 2!</P>

<P>I think most people (well, most successful people) on the e-mail circuit do this.  It's harder to make work there, because you aren't taking valuable time to talk to them -- it's <i>expected</i> that you talk to everyone every turn.  In time-limited games, it really means something.  Lets take an example, from above:</P>
