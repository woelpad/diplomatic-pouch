<P>&#9;It’s been 2 years since WDC 8, where I was lucky enough to come home with the win.  Since that time, I’ve played in a bunch of tournaments, email and F2F, and I’ve been forced to come to an unpleasant conclusion:</P>

<P>I am NOT a little guy anymore.</P>

<P>While this has its definite downside (Being attacked in 1902 by four other powers is a bit excessive, I think.  Three?  Sure, I understand that.  But four?  :&gt;), it’s not all bad.  Nonetheless, the approach which took me to the top just hasn’t been sufficient to keep me there.  My challenge has been this:  How to compete with the Sharks, when I can no longer slip in under their radar?  As it happens, I have learned a thing or two about swimming with Sharks, and here, in time for WDC 10, are a few thoughts that might help YOU win!</P>

<LI>Thinking long term</LI></OL>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>This is something that seems obvious, right?  You have to think long term in order to win.  But what does &quot;thinking long term&quot; mean, really?  In my book, it means never losing sight of your overall objective – 18 dots.</P>

<P>GASP!  I hear people reeling in shock even as I write.  The goal is 18 dots?  Yuppers.  Everytime you sit down at the table to play, you and your fellow players are trying to get  more than half of those lovely little black dots.  Now, the purpose of this isn’t to tell you <I>which </I>18 dots to get – look elsewhere on this fine site for that info.  I do want to impress that you must consider your long-term goal when making decisions early on.</P>

<P>An example:  France and England are co-operating in the destruction of Germany.  In the process of the attack, England takes Belgium, with the &quot;understanding&quot; that upon capture of German home Sc’s, France would take posession.  Not, I think, an uncommon arrangement.  </P>

<P>With this accomplished in 1901, the allies move on:  England builds F Edi A London.  France builds A Paris F Marsailles.  In S1902   France moves into Burgundy, and Ruhr, England positions units.   Here’s the S02 Map:</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<DIR>

<P> </P>
<P>Ok, you’re England – you’re thinking long–term.  France is planning on swinging the fleet into the Med, cutting Kiel’s support, and pushing A Marsailles into Piedmont.</P>

<P>You write the orders!</P>

<P>Ok, if you came up with:</P>

<P>F North Sea C A London -&gt; Holland</P>
<P>A London -&gt; North Sea -&gt; Holland</P>
<P>A Belgium S A London -&gt; Holland</P>

<P>Then you made the right call! </P>

<P>Sure, there are other options, but this puts both your armies on the continent, where you have a say in what happens later . . .</P>

<P>So, here is the map after the fall turn:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="Image9.jpg" WIDTH=667 HEIGHT=508></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So far, so good!  Things are looking smashing for the F/E alliance.  So, what do you build?  And why?  And what is your next goal?  Your next step on your quest for the elusive 18?  Lets look at your next logical areas of acquisition:</P>

<P>1:  Scandinavia</P>
<P>&#9;Sweden, Denmark and StPete are good centers to have, and would put you up to 9 – though you’d probably have to give France Belgium, as you promised you would, back when.</P>

<P>2:  Northern Germany</P>
<P>&#9;Denmark, Berlin, and Kiel  are also a good three to have.  Together you and France can probably take these centers in a couple of years.  Again, Belgium goes to France, Leaving you at 8.</P>

<P>3:  Coastal France</P>
<P>&#9;Brest, Spain, and Portugal are fine centers to have.  ;)  They go a long way to preventing the rise of a Naval power who can challenge you in the next few years.  As a handy side note, you get to keep Belgium!  </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>So, which choice do you make?  Most folks will go for a combination of 1&amp;2, trusting their superior position to keep them safe from a French stab.  And this is not a BAD strategy – lots of folks will get a nice 3 or 4 way draw out of it.  Owning StPete, Scandinavia, Northern Germany and Holland puts you at 10 centers, a quite respectable England in any tournament.  However, this position will NOT get you to 18, no way, no how.  Because while you are busy doing all of this, France is busy gobbling up Italian dots, possibly getting as far as Northern Austria.  Barring the total collapse of Russia, the other 8 dots you need,  come from France.</P>

<P>And this is where the long term thinking comes in.  France is understandably worried about your intentions at this point – so be as friendly as can be – go for the &quot;friendly, alliance-building&quot; choice.  Build F Edi, and move in the Spring thusly:</P>

<P><IMG SRC="Image10.jpg" WIDTH=667 HEIGHT=508>&nbsp;</P>

<P>Now, in this example, we were lucky enough to get German support for the move to Sweden – that wont happen everytime, but it shouldn’t be too hard a sell – Germany is looking for a friend, right?  But here we’ve made a strong bid for the Scandinavian centers, France is mollified, and dare we say . . . unsuspecting?  So what shall we do now?  Fall is coming – Russia is Understandably upset.  What do you do now?  Take StPete with the army, cutting the Gulf of Bothnia’s support?  Support yourself into Denmark, cutting Kiel’s support from Holland?  Not BAD choices, either of them --- or you could do this:  Fall 03 results?&#9;</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><IMG SRC="Image11.jpg" WIDTH=667 HEIGHT=508></P>

<P>Ok, now what have we done here? </P>

<P>1)  We left Russia Sweden, but took StPete – with a fleet!  He also lost Rumania to Austria, you’ll note.  So he’ll remove two units – which two do you think he’ll pull?  (We’re betting on F Finland A StPete.) Austria is all over him, while We have shown a lot of restraint, yes?  This will help to prevent any explosive growth from the other end of the board, something to be concerned when one is going for 18.</P>

<P>2)  We bounced France out of Belgium – he didn’t support himself in, why should he, good friends that he thought us to be?  And at the same time, did right by Germany, telling him a) that we were vacating Holland for him, b) France was stabbing us for Belgium at the same time, and c) we were trying to bounce Russia with the fleet to the Baltic -- we wouldn’t move to the Baltic like that for no reason, right?  </P>

<LI>We  also two fleets on the MAO, which means that, in the Long term, France is ours.  The minute he pulls his fleets back from Italy, He loses Tunis.  Portugal is also a lock, fall of next year.</LI></OL>
</OL>


<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>This was the turning point – Stabbing France before he could profit from his Italian gains.  Leaving Russia the ability to fight Austria.  Putting yourself in position to continue to take German dots.  In the end, given enough time, France should have:</P>

<P>Home (3) Scandinavia (6) Lowlands/StPete (9) Germany (12) France (15) Iberia (17) – and any one of the following – Tunis, Venice, Moscow, Vienna.  18!</P>

<P>And you had to make the crucial decision in 1903.  You can’t start to think long-term early enough.  This is just one example, of course, and if could easily go wrong.  Taking the 10 center 3way draw is SAFER, of course.  It’s a GOOD choice if you are looking to do well in the tournament.  But if you aren’t a little guy . . . and you have to get your points the hard way, then you have to look for those 18 dots in EVERY GAME.   They won’t always be there, but if you never look, you’ll very rarely find them.  And waiting until the middle of the game before you start looking, I’m afraid, is too late.</P>

<LI>Help Your Ally Help Yourself (to his centers)</LI></OL>

<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>Ok, in example number one, we looked for the opportunity to get to 18.   Here, in our second section, we will examine ways to encourage one’s ally to take a position which, while appearing to be advantageous to them, in fact leaves them open for the blade.</P>

<P>Some of you may remember some advice I gave a while back – &quot;Alliance play wins Tournaments&quot;.   I hold that this is true.  The problem therein is that one runs the risk of one’s ally doing better than oneself!   So, we need to see how we can shape our alliance so that our ally doesn’t do quite as well as we do.  To help us with this, lets take a page from another noted Author – Stephen Agar, in his &quot;Prising the French Snail from his shell&quot;</P>

<P>(link to the article, s’il vous plait  http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/snail.htm)</P>

<P>So, we looked at England last time, so this time, lets take the German point of view.  Lets come up with a set of choices that succeed in our objective of removing France from the game, and leaving Germany in a markedly better position to continue to advance than England.  Take a quick moment to look over the article, and then We’ll sum up our options:</P>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>:</P>

<P>&#9;<B>1. The D-Day Approach</P>
</B>
<P>ENGLAND: F(Lon)-ENG, F(Edi)-NTH, A(Lon)-Wal;</P>

<P>GERMANY: F(Kie)-Den, A(Ber)-Kie, A(Mun)-Ruh;</P>

<P>FRANCE: F(Bre)-MAO; A(Par)-Pic; A(Mar)-Spa</P>

<P>And in the fall:</P>

<P>ENGLAND:  F (Eng) C A (Wal) – Bel, A (Wal)-Bel, F (NTH)-Nwy</P>

<P>GERMANY: A (Ruh) S A (Wal) -&gt; Bel, F (Den)-&gt; Swe, A (Kie) -&gt; Hol</P>

<P>FRANCE:     A (Pic) -&gt; Bel (bounce) A (Spa) hold, F (MAO) -&gt; Por</P>

</B>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>ENGLAND: F(Lon)-NTH; A(Lpl)-Edi, F(Edi)-NWG;</P>

<P>GERMANY: F(Kie)-Den, A(Ber)-Kie, A(Mun)-Ruh.</P>

<P>FRANCE: F(Bre)-MAO; A(Par)-Pic; A(Mar)-Spa</P>

<P>And in the fall:</P>

<P>ENGLAND: F(NTH) C A(Edi)-Bel, F(NWG)-Nwy;</P>

<P>GERMANY: F(Den)-Swe; A(Ruh) S ENGLISH A(Edi)-Bel, A(Kie)-Hol (or Mun if France is in Bur).</P>

<P>FRANCE: F(MAO)-Por; A(Spa) Std., A(Pic)-Bel.</P>

<P>England builds F(Lon), F(Lpl). Germany builds F(Kie), A(Mun). </P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>Ok, now these options leave out choices where Germany opens to Burgundy, so we’ll leave that alone.  I note that Stephen has Germany bouncing Russia in Sweden without any comment.  I’ll leave it alone as well, except to say that I would give a long hard look at allowing Russia to have Sweden in 01 – with another northern fleet build, Russia can be quite a thorn in England’s side.  That, while tangental to our focus, is really more under the heading of #3.  So, on to our opening choices – #1 or #2?</P>

<P>Lets look at two boards, and see which S02 position we like more.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>#1</P>

<P><IMG SRC="Image12.gif" WIDTH=717 HEIGHT=659></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P>#2</P>

<P><IMG SRC="Image13.gif" WIDTH=717 HEIGHT=659></P>

<P>Well, a quick look shows small difference – The English fleet is in the North Sea, or the English Channel.  Ah, but what a difference that makes!  The English channel is a better position for SO many reasons.  My thought here is that as Germany, you want the English fleets around the horn ASAP.  Get England into the Westmed soon enough, and he will be overextended.  Get him into Portugal, and make him defend it!  With England’s fleets strung out around Iberia, and France defending against those fleets, you should be able to make greater gains.  Make sure you turn them into a better position.  (i.e. you can take Sweden with a fleet, placing your second fleet in Denmark, naturally!) </P>

<P>&#9;So, right from the outset, having decided to attack France, you want to get England to take the aggressive stance, the one that assumes the risks. With England in the Channel, he is practically committed to war with France, and thus he should build F Liverpool – if he ISNT in the channel, he might well team up with France and come after you in ’02!  If England and France bounce in the channel, you haven’t commited any acts of war, have you?  And if Russia looks to bounce England out of Norway, well, perhaps you should be working with France instead!  By encouraging a posture of attack which England cannot sustain without you, you allow yourself the option of yanking the carpet out from under him, and this is the important part, SHOULD AN APPROPRIATE MOMENT ARRIVE.   </P>

<P>&#9;Don’t take this as being &quot;a bad ally&quot;.  The cause of conquering France <I>is</I> being advanced – England <I>is</I> profiting thereby.  But in choosing tactics, if you can gently nudge your ally into a position that doesn’t work out for him, well, so much the better for you!  And if it DOES work out for him, that’s fine as well.  Sometimes a fast striking attack is the way to go, and you’ll want to remain good allies with your partner long into the game – perhaps through to the end.  It depends on what happens on the other side of the table.  As we saw in point one, its never too soon to think about your 18 dots.  (As Germany, you don’t HAVE to get England’s centers to get your solo, but it sure helps!)  So, lets look to point #3, and see what we can do to influence the other side!</P>

<P>#3   Work the Board</P>

<P>&#9;In F2F play, there often isnt enough time to get to every other player every turn.  In fact, this is one of the biggest weaknesses I see in Email players who come to F2F games, is the lack of ability to manage their time.  Nonetheless, you MUST pay attention to the whole board, and use what influence you can to shape it.   In F2F play, because so few people take the time to work the board, it’s a terrific way to get other people into, or out of trouble.  </P>
<P>&#9;As a &quot;dis-interested party&quot;, you can have a tremendous effect on who gets what from who, and how.  As Turkey, you can sagely give advice to England on how to attack France, and then give France advice on how best to defend himself!  It’s a little tougher as a central power, particularly as Italy – everyone figures you’ve got something at stake.  Nonetheless, if you can build your rep as a friend of the cause, you can do for the other side of the board what you did for your ally in Example 2!</P>
<P>&#9;I think most people (well, most successful people) on the email circuit do this.  Its harder to make work there, because you arent taking valuable time to talk to them – its expected that you talk to everyone every turn.  In time-limited games, it really means something.  Lets take an example, from above</P></FONT></BODY>
