Not a bad response, but perhaps a tad shortsighted? Turkey is stuffed, he
isn't going to get that fleet in the Med. anytime soon. You can only build one
fleet at a time, and it takes 3 moves, minimum, to get a fleet from Trieste to
the Aegean, in this case probably more. AND you'll probably need a third fleet
to take down Turkey for certain. OTOH, Another army is security that Germany
won't come crashing down on you. But probably not your best choice.
