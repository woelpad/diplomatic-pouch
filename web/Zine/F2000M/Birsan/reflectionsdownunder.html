Reflections from Downunder</h1>

<!-- article w/ H3 section headings -->
<p>It has been a month since my trip to Sydney which gave me the opportunity
to play in the NSW tournament and meet the with the DAANZ group. A month
is about the right time to reflect on things as that amount of time allows
a lot of the minutia to settle to abyss of the memory pool and for the
salient things to surface.
<p>I had been to Sydney in the early 80's for several extended business
trips and came away from that experience very disillusioned with massive
numbers of disturbing labor strikes, rather disturbing social conditions
and constant horrible weather. Well the weather had not changed but I am
happy to have seen major changes elsewhere.
<p>The players were all very cool, despite being periodically poisoned
by something called vegemite.
<p>The games were all played with a great deal of fun and lack of controversy
in game style or philosophy. There was a mix of different ethnic and life
style backgrounds in the group which was of absolute no interest to anyone
and totally transparent in both the play and socialization of the players.
This was a marked change from my prior experiences in Sydney in which I
wound up basically on the fringes of a ethnic conflict between Australian
dockworkers and Singaporean Islamic ship crews.
<p>Craig Sedgwicks was the main crash place for the billeting group including
the Kiwis and some of the players from a distance out. The first night
was pretty quite, however on Friday night the group arrived enmasse and
with about 10-12 people in the room there was quite a lot of noise. Craig
also had just installed a high fidelity DVD with surround sound in the
upper range of the human decibel count. The group was determined to blast
the various movies. The sound proofing in the apartments (flat) was astounding
which is the only reason I can believe that Craig and crew were not found
lynched by their neighbors.
<p>Friday night, was exhaustion night for me and I retired somewhat early,
however for the rest of the group a combination of non-medicinal liquids
with loud movies and a peculiar male bonding ritual resulted in several
waking spells to chanting and screams about the "all blicks score" and
a women's voice of "if I can be awake after 8 hours of work so can
you..." One of the players was a women who came up with Andrew a.k.a.
Goffeeeee. She would play in the first round and other than that when I
enquired as to what her story was in the hobby, I was politely informed
it would simply confound traditional journalistic research.
<p>Saturday morning I had breakfast with Brandon Clarke who came from New
Zealand for the tournament. We talked about the play styles and tournament
techniques especially since I was concerned about playing with the Drop
Dead Deadlines. He advised that what he likes to do is to write all his
pieces down as soon as the moves are read and to fill in the obvious moves
first so that only a few critical moves need to be filled in at the end.
Reasonable and good advise.
<p>The Drop Deadlines is one of my strongest memories of the tournament.
What basically is done is that there is a total single deadline which includes
writing orders and diplomacy and at the end of the time limit the orders
had to be in. In two cases on my boards players units were all held in
civil disorder because the player had not placed the orders in the box
by the time of the count down. In both cases the players had the orders
in their hand. One simply forgot that they were there and thought his orders
were in, and the other had a set of orders all written but accepted that
because he had not gotten them in by the bell then he was screwed. There
were several other cases, some of which I thought were critical in my games
where players only wrote some of their orders and so units held, again
because of the combined nature of order writing
and discussion. From what I understand from players at
several of the other games my table was the strictest of the group in enforcement
of the deadline. Certainly it appeared later that there were cases
where players had moves in hand and simply handed them in after the buzzer
or countdown was done.
<p>In all my other tournament experiences, there had always been a period
for discussion and then a separate period where you would come to the table
and write orders.
<p>The other aspect that left an impression was that there when there are
retreats there is no one in the game allowed to point out where allowed
retreats are. Technically the house rules allows for the players to call
over the GM to make this determination, however, never do since this time
is subtracted from the next rounds time period. In three cases I saw experienced
players blow retreats big time, including two cases by the same player
of trying to retreat to the place where the attack came from and one case
of trying to retreat to a place of stand off. In both cases the units were
removed rather than saying, nice try take another place.
<p>The strictness of the rule applications and the rule that you are not
allowed to point out retreat possibilities makes me wonder what horrible
abuses must have taken place in the past to bring us to this very hard
nosed approach things.
<p>For a very experienced player like myself, the fact is that it gave
me an advantage once I got a feel for the timing. In the afternoons the
time limits was reduced from 20 minutes to 14 and at one point I thought
10 minutes making it very hard on average players who had 8 units or more
or a complicated set of choices. I have mixed feelings on the Drop Dead
Deadlines, first not being exposed to the abuses that brought this about
makes it hard for me to appreciate this approach as a solution. Second,
I found it was a large competitive edge to the very experienced player
once you approached the end game when the deadlines were shorter and the
orders longer. On the one hand it allows for greater skill to win out,
on the other hand winning by virtue of a player screw up in writing orders
cheapens the victory. It is something that is worth exploring further.
<p>As for the games themselves. My first game was the hardest and the last
game was the easiest. What made the first game very hard is that I played
Turkey which for this tournament was one of the most picked on countries
and probably the amongst the poorest in the tournament. I wound up facing
an intractable Austro-Italian alliance with a perfidious friend in Russia.
One of the most interesting things of this game was the way that it revealed
some of the style issues that would repeat themselves again and again for
me. One of the things I learned somewhat early on was that lying has a
limited use and that there is a time and a place. I also learned that there
was no benefit, and a great harm, to lie about something stupid. Yet time
and time again players would lie about silly things. Moves which were obvious
and not a threat or an advantage, yet they would lie about making them.
They would lie about supporting you in impossible situations. It
was as if the purpose of the game was to tell as many lies as you could
and then hope to put one over on someone. Much of this may be because there
were a lot of novices in the games, but it left an impression on me.
The last game I played was memorable for several reasons. It was the easiest:
for the first 10 game years I had only 8 orders fail due to enemy action.
Diplomatically I entered the game determined to take one ally and stick
with him throughout the game as a sort of protest to the gross number of
casual single center stabs and attacks I had seen in the prior two games.
As England I worked a deal with France from the beginning and with the
East in constant chaos due to stab happiness and downright personality
clashes the game was heading a sweep. Tactically the rest of the board
were making simple mistakes and poor calls and the west was doing everything
right. In one spectacular turn we had the French fleets trade places with
the Italians holding Tuscany, Tyrn Sea and Tunis to smash through the Med
and trap several Italian fleets off balance. As the game dragged on all
the other games in the tournament ended. My position as England was all
over the French who were my faithful ally. I had English fleets in the
Tyrn Sea, Mid Atlantic, Armies in Rumania and points east/west. From 1909
on I had 18 centers guaranteed by my count in two game years and at times
20 centers. If I stabbed the French.
<p>Like most very experienced tournament players you have a good feel for
where you are when you are when things are going well for you and you can
more or less predict where you will be in the final score if you final
game goes one way or another. This is not to say that there is anything
particularly cunning or evil with this knowledge it is simply a fact that
you generally know where you stand. The other games had all ended and players
had told us what happened as a matter of socialization rather than a scouting
effort my anyone on our table. From this I knew that if I won the game
I would win the tournament. If I came in with a high non finish such as
16 or 17 then I would get Best England and maybe come in second or third.
The game was coming down to just three of us: England France and a 5 or
7 center Turkey. What to do? France
was clearly getting nervous as the number counted down to grind the
Turks further and further. We had set up a series of bounces to keep things
demilitarized between us. I wanted the game to end on a voted draw to the
two of us. France was delaying somewhat trying to get more centers. Then
France made for me a critical move: I was doing a self stand off in the
English Channel from the Mid Atlantic and the North Sea. France had a fleet
in Brest and what he did without notice was to support me from the Mid
to the Channel. This was a surprise, and in the final game periods when
you are trying to go for a 17-17 split surprises are not a good thing.
On the following move I bounced all over him going to 16 centers to his
13 and Turkey at 5. At this point I had to make a decision. By my look
I had at least 19 centers assured within 2 game years even with the loss
of Rumania to a possible French-Turkish combo. I had set my goal to end
the game with the same player as my ally. His bad behavior at the final
point was not an overwhelming stab, just an annoyance. To force the game
to a draw right then and there would cost him Best France, and allow Turkey
to survive for his efforts in causing chaos in the East. If my game was
played in absolute isolation of other games, this is probably what I would
do as bending someone to your will is far more satisfying than an outright
win which in some ways is a little rude. I always prefer to have a voted
end to a game and to manipulate the vote(rs). I had proven that I knew
what I was doing and by turning down the easy win, it sort of felt that
I was tipping my hat to the locals saying thank you for the good time,
I didnt come here to take away your championship. So I put it to the players,
vote to end the game as it was or else. Turkey jumped at it and the French
reluctantly agreed thus at least one game was played to the end where two
players stayed allied though with a little rough spot at the end.
<p>Outside of the Diplomacy tables, I played RA several times, and it was
regularly pounded, plagued and disastered. It was a fun game. Not as much
fun as Settlers of Cataan but worth having. I played this First Voyagers/Settlers
game which was about the voyage of the first settlers to Australia. It
was a bad game.
<p>Aside from the real fun and kicks and chuckles with the very sociable
group of players, one of the lasting memories has to be of Vegemite. This
is a substance that is passed off as a food additive or substitute and
was gleefully offered to me as an example of the Australasia supreme contribution
to the development of culinary arts.
<p>The American government has signed numerous treaties in regard to the
proliferation of chemical and bacterial weapons of mass destruction. Somewhere
in there is a clause relating to Vegemite. This hideous substance
is stored in various supermarkets Down Under and inflicted upon the youth
there so they build up a natural immunity and in some cases a substance
dependence. The very first full length movie made was in Australia about
a mass murderer Ned Kelly. What they don't tell you is that he went on
this spree because of Vegemite poisoning and was in fact trying to hunt
down the distributors of this vile stuff. With the consistency of last
years brown shoe polish left out in the California sun just a little too
long and then cooled, Vegemite has a tart decrepit taste that lingers in
your mouth, no your whole body after just the smallest bit. I am convinced
that the only reason it is stored in supermarkets is that in the event
of a Neutron bomb attack destroying all human life in Australia, the new
occupants will be promptly poisoned once they loot the supermarket shelves
thinking that they are getting some vitamin and yeast supplement (as if
yeast ever needed to be supplemented in the human body).
<p>On the whole, it was a fun trip and great bunch of folks to have games
with and carry on. I look forward to more trips to the area in the next
decade and wish them the best of luck on getting the World DipCon in 2002.
