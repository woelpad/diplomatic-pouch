<br>
<p><font size=+2>INTRODUCTION</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to America and welcome to WDC X!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This collection of bon mots is designed to both entertain
and stimulate you. Who knows, perhaps you will even find it useful. To
that end I've included a lot of URLs and even a few links to critical web
sites.&nbsp;&nbsp; I plan to discuss this year's WDC event, the host venues
of Baltimore and Washington, diplomacy &amp; diplomats in the real world
of Washington's Foggy Bottom, next year's WDC XI in Paris, and the most
talked about WDC XII host candidate for 2002, Canberra.&nbsp; Finally,
since we'll already be in asia, I'll offer a few diplocentric thoughts
on my recent asian tour.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My theme is "In search of the perfect..." and I invite
you to come along as I search for, in no particular order: the perfect
national anthem; the perfect chocolate;&nbsp; the perfect hamburger; the
perfect museum and memorial; the perfect sleeping partner; the perfect
American holiday;&nbsp; the perfect WDC event; the perfect Diplomacy web
site; the perfect school for Dippers; and the Dipper of the decade.&nbsp;
It should be an interesting hunt, don't you think?
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>WDC IX</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before I begin my presentation on the current WDC
event, I'd like to express my thanx to the Belgian hosts for last year's
event in Namur.&nbsp; They did a superb job.&nbsp; If you see Jean-Louis
Delattre or any of his fellow dot-grabbers, give them a chocolate or buy
them a bier for a job well done!&nbsp; If you happen to get in a game with
Jean-Louis just insert some of the following words in your negotiations,
and he will agree to anything you say: Neuhaus, praline, ballotin, caprice,
madison, Galleries St.-Hubert, Leonidas, Godiva, Rue du Lombard, Planet
Chocolate, Mary's, Banyuls, Marcolini, Wittamer, Museum of Cocoa and Chocolate,
... Hummm, sounds like a variant good enough to eat!
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>WDC X</font>
<p><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>If you ask the average American,
or foreigner for that matter, to name the United States of America national
anthem you'll probably get any one of a half-dozen titles, depending on
how old the respondent is.&nbsp; You might get&nbsp; "The Star-Spangled
Banner,"&nbsp; "The Battle Hymn of the Republic," "The Stars and Stripes
Forever," "America, the Beautiful," "God Bless America," or even "This
Land Is Your Land;" Woody Guthries' response to Irving Berlin's tune!&nbsp;
And, in a way, they are all America's national anthems, as you'll discover
if you spend much time in Baltimore or Washington this summer. When you
come to WDC X you'll be in America's patriotic heartland!&nbsp; Enjoy it.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This year's WDC X is being hosted by the BPA, a local
gaming organization, that took over the old AVALONCON, formerly hosted
by Avalon Hill, now a part of Hasbro, the current manufacturers of Diplomacy,
and just about every other boardgame sold in America.

<p><b>HOW TO GET YOUR NEW DIPLOMACY GAME</b></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i> If you would like to order a copy of the new HASBRO
edition of DIPLOMACY with metal pieces, I can order one for you to be picked
up by you at WDC.&nbsp; The cost will be US$50.00 cash per copy, including
tax, S&amp;H. I must have your order by 24 July so I can order them myself.&nbsp;
This offer is for our foreign visitors only.</i>
<center>
<p>**********</center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lot has changed since I attended my first
AVALONCON some eight or so years ago, but much is still the same.&nbsp;
The Freemason Home is still up on the hill across the way, but I hope now
they won't try to shoot you if you drive on to their property; which is
what they tired to do to me when I last visited.&nbsp; McCormick/Schilling
is now the world's largest spice company (and they'll be even bigger when
they complete their purchase of France's largest spice company), but no
longer the owner of the venue hotel. How else do you think it got a restaurant
named The Cinnamon Tree?&nbsp; There's still an ice cream parlor and Pizza
Hut in the hotel, but I don't know if we'll be able to enjoy the smell
of garlic throughout the event.&nbsp; Avalon Hill and the Dotts, Tom Shaw,
and Rex Martin are gone; but Don Greenwood is still running the show.&nbsp;
The shopping mall down the street is still there, but probably doesn't
have the highest vacancy rate in the country as it did back then.&nbsp;
The local bank, Capitol One, has become a big-time player; mostly on the
basis of a high-risk credit card portfolio.&nbsp; Hopefully the wine merchant
down the road is now carrying more than E&amp;J Gallo.&nbsp; Robert Sacks,
Diplomacy's senior citizen enfante terrible is still around; but our favorite
game, Fast Food Franchise, isn't on the list of events this year.&nbsp;
Finally, to everyone's joy I'm sure, the Gettysburg observation tower went
up with a bang on July 3rd!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There have been three prior WDCs held in the United
States: II (1990) in Chapel Hill, North Carolina; where we all got an exposure
to classic southern hospitality; VI (1996) in Columbus, Ohio; where we
all saw the strength and wealth of the American midwest; and VIII (1998),
again in Chapel Hill; where we got a taste of Carolina BBQ.&nbsp; To learn
more about these events, and the rest of WDC's history, visit The WDC <a href="http://www.geocities.com/wdcshrine">Shrine</a>
.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now, for our first WDC event of the new millennium,
we come to Hunt Valley, Maryland; which allows us to claim both Baltimore
and Washington as our host cities.&nbsp; Together these two cities represent
America's deepest roots and traditions.&nbsp; I hope you'll take the time
to visit both cities and their surrounding areas.&nbsp; Whether you only
have a few days or a whole month; you'll find an amazing variety of things
to see and do.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But first, the WDC event.&nbsp; What do our hosts
have planned for us?&nbsp; Most of the details can be found on the BPA
or WDCX website, or found in the BPA program, but I'll share a few highlights
with you here.&nbsp; The events will be held in the Garden Room on the
hotel's main floor (upwind from the Pizza Hut, I hope) and will run from
Thursday through Sunday.
<br>Thursday is pretty much an open day for people to do what they want.&nbsp;
There's been talk of a Colonial Dip event, a meeting of con movers and
doers, some pre-Charter lobbying, etc.&nbsp; It's pretty much up to you.&nbsp;
The solo Dip tournament will be in four rounds, played on Friday (at 0900
and 1800), Saturday (at 0800), and Sunday (at 0800). There will be an Escalation
Dip event going on, a team event concurrent with the Saturday round, a
talk by Allan Calhamer on Saturday afternoon, followed by the WDC Society
meeting, and a blind gunboat tournament Saturday night at 1900.&nbsp; The
results and awards will come sometime Sunday afternoon.&nbsp; There will
also be an auction of goodies sometime during the event to raise funds
to help defray expenses.&nbsp; I expect Jim Yerkey to do his usual high-style,
low-profile job of running these events.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The details of the gaming I leave to those interested.&nbsp;
The WDC Society meeting, on Saturday afternoon, is a must for those interested
in the game hobby.&nbsp; It's also usually the most entertaining event
of each WDC.&nbsp; This year's agenda is full of interesting goodies for
attendees to pick over.&nbsp; First up is the adoption of the draft Charter
that Edi Birsan and his cohorts have been working on since the beginning
of time.&nbsp; Almost as important is the question of incorporating the
WDC.
<br>Those present will also pick a site for the 2001 North American DipCon
(Denver or ?), affirm the 2001 WDC event in Paris, and select a 2002 WDC
site (Canberra or ?).&nbsp; Edi has invested a huge amount of time and
effort into orchestrating this year's meeting.&nbsp; It will be interesting
to see if everyone can and will keep in step to the rhythm of his drum.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If, and it is always a big if, everyone who said
they are coming shows up; and if everyone works together in a positive
way, as they have said they will; this should be the most successful WDC
held in North America.&nbsp; If not...
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Although I've not seen any suggestions thus far from
the organizers, I assume we'll have somekind of post-event feed. My suggested
location for that is Alonso's, just down the freeway from the Con site.
I'll explain why later.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>BALTIMORE</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Baltimore isn't on anybody's short list of "must
see" places in America.&nbsp; Maybe that's good. Maybe it's bad.&nbsp;
You
<br>decide.&nbsp; Maryland has been offered as a sort of "miniature America,"
with something for everybody and a good sampling of&nbsp; what America
has to offer.&nbsp; Baltimore prides itself on its "charm," but it also
has a very high murder and syphilis rate.
<br>Whether there's a connection between those three; I don't know.&nbsp;
Baltimore isn't a world class city, or even a white collar one.&nbsp; It's
definitely blue collar, and its strong point is its culturally diverse
neighborhoods. There are more than 80 of them, ranging from a few square
blocks to entire planned communities with thousands of residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;
I'll be suggesting some places for you to visit, and things to do, but
keep in mind that Baltimore's real charm lies in its people.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are over 40 historical sites in greater Baltimore
(registered&nbsp; as such by the US National Park Service).&nbsp; Here
are some sites you should check out if you can: Fort McHenry National Monument
and Historic Shrine (required for all Brits), Captain Larry's (offers the
best hamburger in town), the Baltimore National Aquarium (in case you wanna
see what a real piranha, stingray, vine snake, poison frog, anaconda, crocodile,
or shark looks like) &amp; Inner Harbor (touristy, but nice, Washington
Monument (one of the loveliest squares in America) &amp; Walters Museum
(fantastic collection of asian goodies), Alonso's (best cheeseburger in
town), Hampton National Historic Site (see how the American aristocracy
lived when the French were demolishing the Bastille), and the McCormick
spice operation here in Hunt Valley (in case you don't know whether marijuana
and heroin are herbs or spices).&nbsp; If you're into baseball there's
also the Camden Yards stadium and Babe Ruth Museum. If you're into Black
history there's a lot sites related to famous blacks from Baltimore and
jazz. If you're a literary snob you can check the home turfs of Edgar Allen
Poe, John Dos Passos or Tom Clancy! And last, but not least, there's the
B&amp;O railroad museum for choo-choo fans!&nbsp; As I said, there's a
lot to do in Baltimore. I guarantee you'll run out of time and/or money
before you run out of things to do.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have time (all of these require a day trip
away from Baltimore) be sure to visit some of the Civil War battlefields
surrounding Baltimore.&nbsp; Antietam and Gettysburg are both very impressive,
but get there early or late to avoid the tourist hordes. If you're alone
and it's quiet Gettysburg, in particular, will effect you the way Verdun
or Passachendale will.&nbsp; And, if you have another day, drive out to
the Eastern Shore and see the peninsula that Delaware, Maryland and Virginia
share, along with millions of blue crabs, chickens, and Tom Clancy fans!&nbsp;&nbsp;
If you've got a fast car, see how many states you can visit in one day!&nbsp;
If you're good you should be able to pick up at least a half-dozen.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of these sites I've mentioned have web sites,
so check those out; or ask me about them at the Con.&nbsp; I'll have maps
and guidebooks.

Sun</a>.
<br>&nbsp;
<p><font size=+2>WASHINGTON</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If this is your first visit to Washington, DC, you
need at least a month to really get to know it.&nbsp; Any less and you're
only scratching the surface.&nbsp; So, what can you do in two days?&nbsp;&nbsp;
Actually quite a lot, if you plan ahead.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was fortunate to be able to spend seven weeks in
Washington back in the days when another Californian occupied the White
House (Nixon, not Reagan).&nbsp; At that time I did just about everything
a tourist is supposed to do in America's capital.&nbsp; Since then; I've
found that an occasional two or three day trip every ten years or so is
enought to keep up with the changes in the city.&nbsp; This visit I plan
to only spend two days.&nbsp; Hopefully that will be enough, but there's
a lot of new stuff to see.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But&nbsp; if you're visiting from overseas or for
the first time there's a wealth of treasures to be discovered in DC.&nbsp;
Brits and Frenchmen would probably argue that the museums of London and
Paris (80 plus in number, for each) contain more treasures than Washington,
D.C. Rome, Madrid, Vienna, or even St.Petersburg might say the same thing,
but I would disagree.&nbsp; The British and French museums represent the
loot of their empires.&nbsp; Rome represents the wealth of the church.
Madrid's collection is great, but spotty. The Vienna collections represents
the tastes of the Habsburgs, and the treasures of St.Petersburg the tastes
of the Romanovs (far superior, but still incomplete).&nbsp; The museums
of Washington, on the other hand, represent the best that money could buy,
or the most valuable of gifts imaginable.&nbsp; The collections scattered
along The Mall represent the greatest collection of art in the world.&nbsp;
And that's only the half of it.&nbsp; The other half of The Mall represents
the collective memories of the world's second great empire.&nbsp; To see
more, you would have to go to Rome's Forum.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Anyway, Washington, unlike Baltimore, is a city of
government, of paper, and of white collar bureaucrats.&nbsp; There are
no real industries, except perhaps for the lobbyists and tourists.&nbsp;
It's a city of whites (15% of the population) vs. blacks (85%), but that
isn't as bad as it sounds.&nbsp; It's true that the number of blacks and
other minorities in the higher levels of government is low, but it's also
a fact that there are tens of thousands of dual income black families in
Washington making a good living.&nbsp; Blacks may make up a a big majority
of the capitol's janitors, security guards, and maids; but they also make
up 80% of the city's Cadillac buyers!&nbsp; So, it's a complex city of
a few thousand politicians supported by ten thousand or so professionals,
a hundred thousand or so support staff, and the traditional civic support
workers.&nbsp; And yes, it's true, you will see more California plates
in DC than you will DC plates.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old-time Dippers may recall that one of the seven
players in the first ever (1964A) postal Diplomacy game was named Washington
Perry, a black senior civil servant from Washington, DC.&nbsp; I plan to
try and track him down, if he's still alive,&nbsp; while I'm in town.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Washington in June of 1972 was far different than
Washington in August of 2000.&nbsp; Then, you automatically arranged your
visit around trips to the Capitol, White House, Supreme Court, and the
big three Memorials (Washington, Lincoln and Jefferson).&nbsp; Today, all
that is changed.&nbsp; You can do Washington without visiting any of those
places, but you'd be a fool.
<br>In addition, you should try to see The Vietnam Veterans Memorial, the
National Air and Space Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the National
Archives' Charters of Freedom, and Mt. Vernon.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are now nearly 80 museums, memorials and other
sites to visit in Washington.&nbsp; Almost as many as London or Paris.&nbsp;
The big difference, of course, is that almost all of them, including the
best ones, are FREE!&nbsp; The National Park Service and Smithsonian operate
most of the best sites, and rarely charge admission.&nbsp;&nbsp; Check
out these two web sites:
<center>
<p><a href="http://www.cr.nps.gov/travel/wash/sitelist.htm">National Park
Service</a>&nbsp; and the <a href="http://www.smithsonian.com">Smithsonian</a></center>

<p>In addition the local newspaper site has a lot of good info on what's
happening in DC:
<center>
<p><a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com">The Washington Post</a></center>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here's a list of things you "might do" during your
visit: afternoon tea at the top of Washington National Cathedral, visiting
the Lincoln Memorial after dark, taking a monument and memorial walking
tour, visit Rock Creek Park, spend a day in Alexandria, visit the Supreme
Court, spend a morning on the Mall, visit Union Station, stroll down Embassy
Row and see how many black dots you can pick up, people-watch at Dupont
Circle, take a Potomac cruise, visit the Georgetown Flea Market, shop at
the Eastern Market, have a drink on the Rooftop Terrace of the Hotel Washington.&nbsp;
There are also various tram bus and self-guided walking tours of the Mall
area available.&nbsp; Use them, and the Metro!&nbsp; Parking in DC is scarce
and expensive!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For this visit I plan to visit a few new sites and
some one-of-a-kind shows.&nbsp; I'll give you an idea of what I'll be doing
in DC the Monday and Tuesday after the Con, just in case you're interested.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Celebrating the 1,000th anniversary of the arrival
of the Vikings in North America at the National Museum of Natural History.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Viewiing images (wood block prints) from the Russo-Japanese
Front (1904-05) at the Sackler Gallery.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Touring the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seeing the works of America's greatest native artist,
Norman Rockwell, at the Corcoran Gallery of Art.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Making headlines at one of Washington's most popular
new museums, the NEWSEUM. It's over in Arlington, but well worth the trip.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sampling America's national food dish, the hamburger,
at Five Guys, Clyde's, Old Ebbitt Grill, Chadwick's, Johnny Rockets, Ireland's
Four Provinces, or the Cafe Deluxe.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Checking for bugs and leaks at The Watergate Hotel;
which is where I'll be staying, but not in room 702!
<p><font size=+2>DIPLOMACY &amp; DIPLOMATS</font>
<p><font size=+2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>Washington is the center of
American diplomacy, of course.&nbsp; As such it should be of interest to
any student of Diplomacy.&nbsp; There are a lot of places you can visit
and things you can do if you're interested in diplomacy.&nbsp; Here's a
few examples:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Check out this site: <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/digital_diplomacy.html">Digital
Diplomacy for Students</a>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you check it out, keep in mind that our State
Dept didn't even have a web site before Madeleine Albright was Secretary
of State.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Several schools in the Washington area offer fine
programs for wouldbe professional Dippers:
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The semi-official inhouse <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/sfs/msfs/">training
program</a> for the State Dept
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Paul H. Nitze <a href="http://www.sais-jhu.edu/depts/">School
of Advanced International </a>Studies
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A bit further afield (in Boston) is Tufts University's
School of Law and Diplomacy; which recently proved that even the best can
screw up big time when they announced a new dean had been appointed, BEFORE
he resigned as our ambassador to South Korea, or we told the Koreans he
was leaving.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And our very own Diplomacy institution, The Institute
for Diplomatic Studies, has been successfully cloned by The Egyptian Ministry
of Foreign Affairs.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The eighth floor our Department of State Building,
in Foggy Bottom, is devoted to the offices of the Secretary of State and
the Diplomatic Reception Rooms of the Department of State. Check out that
web site if you're interested in visiting them.&nbsp; And, while you're
there, stop by and present your credentials to Madeleine Albright, who
is wrapping up a career as one of America's most unique secretaries of
state.&nbsp; I've followed her career with interest and admiration for
many years, and a few of you may remember my presentation on her in Columbus.&nbsp;
Since then she has continued to impress and amaze me, although she too
has had her occasional screw up (e.g. the Okinawa school meeting hall name
fiasco).
<p><font size=+2>WDC XI</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; WDC XI is supposed to be in Paris next February.&nbsp;
I write "supposed to be" because nobody really knows what, if anything,
the French are planning for the event; and that includes the French themselves.&nbsp;
Hopefully we will find out more in Baltimore.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Today is Bastille Day and I'm reviewing some articles
I've gathered from the media about France and the French, and that includes
the French media. None of them are much different than what we've read
before.&nbsp; Still, there are new twists and turns in the on-going soap
opera that is France Today!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; French soccer rules!&nbsp; World champions and European
champions!&nbsp; Yes!!!&nbsp; But where are the French players on the French
team?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Tour de France is well under way, but where are
the French leaders?
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paris is on holiday, if their picnic wasn't rained
out. Snow in summer?&nbsp; Sacre bleu!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The French president has proposed letting the people
vote on whether his term of office should be changed from two seven year
terms to two five year terms; thereby hoping to guarantee himself a second
term in office.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The French are complaining that the US is spying
on them, even though they have their own, similar system.
<br>It's a case of Echelon vs. Frenchelon!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The French are complaining that America's McDonald's
is destroying their eating habits, even though the real issue is the huge
subsidies the EU and France continues to hand out to its own farmers.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Airbus is complaining about Boeing's favored status
in America. Strange, nobody in France complained when Vivendi bought out
Seagram's!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The French are in an uproar because a McDonald's
employee was fired for feeding the poor, but nobody has complained about
Alain Ducasse charging $400 per person to feed the rich in New York!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The French are up in arms because the Languedoc wine
region; which has always produced the poorest wines in France; has been
invaded by Robert Mondavi, an American winemaker.&nbsp; I don't recall
the French complaining when their winemakers bought up large pieces of
prime vineyards in America, Chile, etc.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And what do the French say?&nbsp; They worry that
applications to the ENA are down 30% in the last four years alone.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They celebrate, today, the storming of the Bastille,
even as their own media reveals that French prisons today are no better
now than they were then.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, as the 23 million visitors visitors to Paris
this year will affirm, WE LOVE PARIS!&nbsp; So, prepare yourselves, my
French Diplomates!&nbsp; WE ARE COMING!
<p><font size=+2>WDC XII</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rumor has it that the Ozzies (Australians) and Kiwis
(New Zealanders) are bidding to host WDC XII in 2002.&nbsp; Edi Birsan
has already visited the Ozzies and given them his seal of approval, so
we can all assume it's a done deal.&nbsp; If you have any doubts yourself
you can visit the 2000 New Zealand Diplomacy Championship this coming October
in Auckland.&nbsp; If you run into me, not to worry.&nbsp; I'm just there
to check on the state of the America's Cup!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few, very few, of you may remember that WDC III
was actually held in Canberra, Australia in 1992.&nbsp; Basically the new
bid is a rerun of that event, with a few new faces tossed in.&nbsp; I remember
the discussion in Birmingham in 1988 about WDC rotations, and the further
discussions in Chapel Hill in 1990.&nbsp; The two big points the Ozzies
made then were: 1) hosting a WDC would be shot in the arm to the Diplomacy
hobby "down-under," and 2) lots of foreigners would come because it was
a cheap place to visit.&nbsp; Well, neither happened.&nbsp; After the event,
the local hobbies crashed; and only a handful of foreigners could afford
the trip.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, it appears from here, the Kiwis at least, are
suffering from The French Diease.&nbsp; Consider the case of Charlie Dempsey,
FIFA, and the World Cup bidding; the US sale of F-16s to New Zealand, their
reception of our ambassador Carol Moseley-Braun, and, worst of all, the
defection of three key&nbsp; NZ America's Cup team members to an Italian
financed, Swiss labelled syndicate.&nbsp; Shame, Shame!
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Still, if we can go to Paris next year after what
happened during their 1995 event, I don't see why we can't go back to Canberra.&nbsp;
Just make sure Brandon Clarke is running things!&nbsp; :-)&nbsp; He's got
more energy and faster fingers than Edi does.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And don't worry about a place to stay, I've already
booked The Diplomat Boutique Hotel!&nbsp; Canberra should be an interesting
place to see, and you can combine that with Sydney (if you're into self-proclaimed
world class cities) or such civilized places as Melbourne, Adelaide, or
Perth. However, based on my culinary experiences in Goteborg, stay away
from the ostrich, 'roo, and kiwi steaks.&nbsp; They're tough, just like
their Dippers.
<p><font size=+2>GOING WHERE WE HAVEN'T GONE BEFORE</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; North America. Done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Europe. Done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oceana. Done.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South America. Manana.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asia. Stirring.
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Africa. Not in our lifetime or theirs, I'm afraid.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Calhamer's been to Japan recently. Birsan's been
to Australia.&nbsp; And I've just returned from Hong Kong, Macau, Seoul
and Taipei.&nbsp; Do you see a pattern?&nbsp; In all these places there
are already Dippers and dippers in place, waiting, and sharpening their
knives.&nbsp; Who knows, in another eight years or so we may be attending
a WDC in Ho Chi Minh City.
<br>Stranger things have happened before, and probably will again in Hunt
Valley.
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hummm, Hunt Valley, seems like an appropriate name
for a WDC venue, don't you think?
<p><font size=+2>CONCLUSION</font>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, there is much, much more to discuss, of course,
but if I don't wrap this up and get it out it will be a history of WDC
X instead of a preview.&nbsp; So, that's it.&nbsp; Come to Hunt Valley,
and hear about what I forgot to include.
