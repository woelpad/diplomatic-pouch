<!-- article w/ H3 section headings -->

<P>This article will not completely make sense, unless you have read <A
HREF="worldftf.html">Why We See Things The Way We Do</A>. The definitions used
herein, together with the sentiments behind a lot of the arguments, are
explained within this article, and without them, it will be very easy to
misinterpret the intentions of the authors when reading this article.

<P>As said in the previous article, we spent a significant amount of time
discussing the different hobbies around the World. The initial intention was to
discuss the location of WDC in 2003, but we quickly discovered that until we
understood the different hobbies, we could not even begin to understand their
needs and wishes. We also realised that you can not discuss the location of
2003 without also looking beyond then at the different possibilities for future
requirements and locations. So having learned about the different hobbies, it
is time to go back and discuss the location of WDC in 2003 and beyond.

<P>A number of opinions on this which had been known to us beforehand were
repeated several times during WDC. They include :

<ul>

<li>Europe should have WDC more often than either North America or Australasia,
as it is a bigger hobby than either of the others.</li>

<li>Europe should not have half of all WDC's.</li>

<li>North America should not have to go four years between WDC's.</li>

<li>Australasia will accept WDC once every four to five years, as it is
currently a significantly smaller hobby than the other two.</li>

<li>No continent should host WDC two years running.</li>

<li>No fixed rotation system will work, as the length of the rotation cycle
would have to be too long, and it is unlikely that the same number of hobbies
will be around and at the same size at the end of the cycle as are around at
the beginning.</li>

</ul>

<P>After very little discussion, we realised that three of the above criteria
are actually impossible to fulfill simultaneously :

<ul>

<li>Europe should have WDC more often than North America</li>

<li>North America should not have to go four years between WDC's.</li>

<li>No continent should host WDC two years running.</li>

</ul>

<P>The reason is this. The only way for hobby A to have WDC more often than
hobby B, is for A to hold WDC twice without B holding a WDC inbetween. Hobby A
can not hold WDC twice in a row, so it will have to hold it twice with a third
hobby holding it inbetween. i.e. :

<P><blockquote>
A x A
</blockquote>

<P>So then even if hobby B holds it immediately before the first time A holds
it, and immediately after the second time A holds it, that is still four years
between two WDC's in B, i.e. :

<P><blockquote>
B A x A B
</blockquote>

<P>So we then discussed which of these criteria would have to be dropped. It
clearly does not make sense for WDC to be in the same continent two years
running. It is also true that the European hobby is currently about 40% bigger
than the US hobby. We therefore suggest that it is not workable for the USA to
never go four years between WDC's. With more continents holding WDC, each one
is going to be holding it less than they currently expect to, and this is just
one example of this.

<P>However, having said that, we then considered the point :

<ul>
<li>Europe should not have half of all WDC's.</li>
</ul>

<P>This does seem to be a very reasonable criteria. While the European Regional
Hobbies collectively are the largest in the world, they are not as big as all
the other hobbies put together. Also, WDC is meant to be a Worldwide event, and
so while the largest hobby should be the one that hosts it the most often, it
should not be concentrated in one continent or it will lose its worldwide
status. As the number of continents holding WDC grows, ground has to be given
up to make space for them. While North America can be expected to give up more
ground than Europe, it should not be asked to do all the giving.

<P>So, how can all the above information be put together to make a coherent
plan? Well except when Australasia holds a WDC, it can alternate between
Europe and North America. The problem is how to organise things when it goes
Downunder. The first thing we realised is, you can not do the same thing every
time. There are two alternatives, and sometimes you have to use one, and
sometimes you have to use the other. 

<P>The two alternatives are :

<ol>

<li>that North America will lose a WDC, so that the rotation goes :

<P><blockquote>
	North America-Europe-Australasia-Europe-North America. 
</blockquote>

<P>We will call this a loss pattern.</li>

<P><li>that the cycle will be shifted along a year so that it goes :

<P><blockquote>
	North America-Europe-Australasia-North America-Europe, or <br>
	Europe-North America-Australasia-Europe-North America. 
</blockquote>

<P>We will call this a shift pattern.</li>

</ol>

<P>The number of times each is used can be altered to alter the balance between
European and North American WDC's, but at present it appears that you should
use each plan about half of the time.

<P>Furthermore, this plan will still work as other hobbies come into the plan.
They can all just be slotted in to the scheme so that everything shifts along
one year when they hold a WDC. So if they join during a loss pattern, it will
become :

<P><blockquote>
	North America-Europe-Australasia-Asia-Europe-North America
</blockquote>

<P>and during a shift pattern it will become :

<P><blockquote>
	North America-Europe-Africa-Australasia-North America-Europe. 
</blockquote>

<P>Admittedly, this does mean that it could become four years between European
WDC's, or five years between North American WDC's, but as more continents come
into the system, it will eventually be unavoidable that each continent gets WDC
less often.

<P>The final question is, should the pattern around 2002 be a shift pattern or
a loss pattern. This is a very big, and a very important question, and it is a
question that must be answered sooner or later. Everyone has an opinion, and in
most cases, that opinion is that WDC XIII should be in their own continent.
Furthermore, they understand why they believe this to be the correct answer.
What very few people understand is why the opposing opinion is seen to be
reasonable by others.

<P>This is further complicated by the fact that practically everybody has a
very good, but selfish reason why they want WDC to be in their own continent.
It makes it a lot easier for them to attend. Of course, this is not the reason
for everybody's opinion, but it is certainly the main reason for some people,
and it is very difficult to tell who does have this as their real reason, and
who doesn't. It also makes it very easy to believe that everybody with the
opposing argument is arguing this way for exactly this reason, whether that is
true or not.

<P>If all else fails, this question will be answered by a vote at WDC in Paris
in July 2001. However, this is the worst option. It would be so much better for
the issue to be decided by consensus beforehand. DipCon, EuroDipCon and the
Bismark Cup, are the focus of the main Continental Hobbies. They are not about
the collection of regional hobbies within the continent fighting against each
other, they are about bringing all the people in the continent together into
one Continental Hobby. In the same way WDC is about the World Hobby. It is not
about competing Continental Hobbies, it is about bringing the continents
together into a single World Hobby. And so the location of WDC is not about the
Continental Hobbies fighting over which is best for them, it is about working
together to agree what is best for the World Hobby.

<P>The options around 2003 are:

<ol>

<li>Allocate WDC 2003 based on a shift pattern.

<P>This would mean that the North America - Europe - North America - Europe pattern shifted along to allow room for Australasia to host WDC 2002, i.e.:

<P><blockquote>
2000 - North America<br>
2001 - Europe<br>
2002 - Australasia<br>
2003 - North America<br>
2004 - Europe
</blockquote></li>

<P><li>Allocate WDC 2003 based on a loss pattern.

<P>This would mean North America gave up a turn at hosting WDC to fit Australasia in, i.e:

<P><blockquote>
2000 - North America<br>
2001 - Europe<br>
2002 - Australasia<br>
2003 - Europe<br>
2004 - North America<br>
</blockquote></li>

</ol>

<P>We discussed this quite a bit, and came up with several good reasons for both. However, the arguments that swayed us the most were as follows :

<ol type=a>

<li>The allocation of WDC to Australasia will either be a shift pattern this
time (2002), or next time (approximately 2007). Why? Because otherwise that
would be asking North America to absorb two loss patterns in a row. This would
mean asking North America to do all the giving, which is not reasonable. Given
that one of 2002 or 2007 will be a shift pattern, the other should be a loss
pattern.

<P><li>At the rate that several other hobbies are growing, including the
Brazilian and South East Asian Hobbies, by the time WDC next goes Downunder
there may well be four or five continents holding WDC. The choice for Europe is
therefore either to have a three year gap now while there are still only three
continents in the running, and then a two year gap next time which could become
a three year gap with the introduction of new hobbies, or to have a two year
gap now, and then have a three year gap next time which could well be extended
to four or even five years by the introduction of new hobbies. With Europe
being the most common host for WDC for the near future, it is in everybody's
interest that Europe has their turns at hosting WDC spread out fairly evenly
every two or three years, rather than regularly being every two years with the
odd big gap of four or five years.

<P><li>There is currently a lot of mistrust between the hobbies in the
different continents, especially between Europe and North America. This is due
largely to the suggestions at the start of 1999 that the vote for 2001 and 2002
should be held in Namur, in order to allow Europe to hold WDC two years
running. A lot of this mistrust could be laid to rest by a North American bid
being accepted at a European WDC in 2001. Then the next time WDC goes
downunder, Europe could vote for a European WDC the year after, thus ensuring
that the next time, a loss pattern is used.

<P>If this is done the other way around, then the current lack of mistrust
between Europe and North America will not be improved at all this time around,
and by 2007, it could have escalated to the extent that it breaks up WDC all
together.</li>

</ol>

<P>To conclude, all the biggest arguments we could come up with suggest that
WDC XIII in 2003 should be in North America. As a decision by itself, this will
be very difficult for the Europeans to accept, which is why it must be coupled
with the understanding that next time WDC goes Downunder, North America will
lose out more than Europe.

<P>Larry Peery has said that WDC's come in groups of three. So lets make WDC's
X to XII be the WDC's where the World's hobbies really start working as a
single entity, and not end up with WDC thirteen being unlucky for Diplomacy
around the world.
