The Sweden Situation</h1></center>
<center><h2>or Why Russia Keeps Getting Done</h2>

<!-- article w/ H3 section headings -->
<p>In recent tournament play in Australia there has been a disturbing
trend against Russia, and to a slighly lesser extent Germany. Although
in part this can be attributed to the usual comings and goings of the
great powers as viewed statistically (with the current dominance of
France, and to a slightly lesser extent England), there is also a
fundamental misconception about the way Germany and Russia should be
played in the early game which is having a great effect, particularly
on Russia, but also on Germany.
<p>The misconception lies in the belief that Russia and Germany cannot
work together. The most glaring example of this almost universal
problem arises when we consider the Sweden question.
<p>Fundamentally, Sweden is the only neutral province on the board that
only two powers can reach with equal numbers in 1901. All the others
are either "safe" (such as Tunis or Bulgaria) or "unsafe" (such as
Belgium or Rumania). Sweden alone stands out as the only neutral
province which only Diplomacy can resolve. Sometimes I think that
Germans bounce the Russian there just because they can. So negotiation
is the only other solution.
<p>Or is it? One theory suggests that Russia gives Sweden away in order
to gain position in the Baltic Sea to launch an attack against the
Hun. Would this tactic (if employed on a regular basis to antagonistic
Germans) result in a movement away from bouncing in Sweden? My answer
is no. Firstly, it will only further perpetuate the myth that Germany
and Russia cannot work together, which hardly seems to suggest more
access to Sweden for the Russian. Secondly, the counter-tactic to this
move (F Den - Swe, A Kie - Den) is so strong that F Bal becomes a
besieged unit and Russia has picked enough enemies to ensure a rapid
downfall. No, I am convinced the answer lies in a more fundamental
strategic misconception rather than such tactical niceties as this.
<p>As you think about it, this strategic fallacy is a disgrace. The game
of Diplomacy is designed to be a fluid, dynamic game. The current
accepted wisdom that Russia and Germany cannot work together, as well
as being completely wrong, is a direct affront to the game.
<p>By eliminating the possibility of a RG coalition against the threat of
EF you have removed the major obstacle to that most dangerous of
alliances. Is it any wonder that we consistently see EF's (and
EF(g)'s) dominating the board when the first line of defence is in
tatters by the end of 1901? In fact, the situation is a little more
uneven than that, since the southern powers can also now exactly judge
Russia's position in the north they can play the bear to make sure
Russia collapses at just the right moment for them to get most of the
centres.
<p>It's catastrophic. Germany wipes out a potential ally and Russia must
play totally in the south in order not to be gently squeezed out of
the game. Suddenly England and France make all the decisions and
Italy, which would otherwise be free to choose between Austria and
Turkey is more concerned with the threat of French incursions into the
Med than actually growing to a reasonable size.
<p>Enough of the reprecussions of the apparently "standard" move of F Den
- Swe. What are the alternatives? And why would Germany use them?
<p>Firstly, I contend that there are only two cases where Germany should
bounce Russia in Sweden. One, where Russia has opened to Silesia or
Prussia, and two, when Germany is part of an EFG alliance.
<p>Where Germany is in an alliance with the English what they most desire
is peace in the North so that they can get about the job of
dismantling France as quickly as possible. The primary reason that EG
alliances fail in the early game is that they waste time and energy
trying to take Sweden and St. Petersburg when fast, strong moves
against France are required. Russia will keep in these circumstances.
<p>In an FG alliance, Russia's assistance of Germany (by getting F Swe
into Nwy and supporting Den - NtS) is crucial to Germany's chances to
gain, and bouncing in Sweden in those circumstances is moronic, if not
outright suicidal. Again, good play from Germany should ensure that
Russia at best cannot stab them and at wosrt can be stabbed
effectively and quickly for all the Scandanavian centres.
<p>In the case of an EF alliance, Russia is Germany's only hope, and
getting Russia offside in the hope that this will appease England is
dangerously misguided.
<p>Why in the world Germany (of all powers!) would want to enter an EFG
(which is 90% of the time just an EF wearing big trousers) is beyond
me, so this leaves the case where Russia is obviously attacking you as
the only truly legitimate reason to bounce in Sweden.
<p>So why does it happen so often? Usually it is because most of the
other powers on the board wish to see Germany Diplomatically isolated.
Certainly England, France and Austria want be sure that Germany has
nowhere to turn if they choose to attack them, and England at least is
usually petrified of a RG attack (even without French help).
<p>Sadly, most Germans are listening to this shady advice. The same way
that A Mun - Ruh guarantees that someone will move to Munich in Fall,
a bounce in Sweden usually means that Russia is now open to
suggestions about attacking Germany. They certainly don't owe the
German any favours. The number of times I have heard German's say
"Everyone on the board said to" when I ask them why they bounced my
Russia in Sweden is phenomenal, and what makes it even more remarkable
is that if there was ever a good reason not to do something strategic
it is if everyone else tells you to do it.
<p>The fact is that 75% of the time Russia getting Sweden is good for the
German. And most of the remaining 25% are when Russia is already
attacking and you obviously choose to bounce or when it wouldn't
matter either way.
<p>I could go into lengthy tactical analysis of how RG alliances work,
and how ERG coalitions work, but frankly you are all bright young
children and there are many ways to make it happen, so I leave that up
to you. What I want to stress is that they are not only possible, but
quite strong alliances.
<p>There are some basic elements in the siutation which should be
discussed. They are all questions from Germany about "Why should I
give you Sweden?", and they all have standard answers. If the Russia
breaks his word the German knows who to trust. If the Russian keeps
his word (as almost always happens, because it is in Russia's
interest) then Germany is set for a good game.
<dl>
<p><dt>Question one: "Why should I give you Sweden?"
<dd><ul><li>Correct Answer: "So that I have a chance to consolidate my position in
the south."
<li>Incorrect answer: "So I can build F StP(nc) and attack England."
</ul>
<p>Germany might ask Russia to build A StP, but never F StP. An F StP
will make a long-term alliance impossible. Russia should tell the
truth about the southern position. If they think they are going to get
Rumania, they should say so. If they think they are getting Vie, Rum
and Ank they should say so. Russia really, really wants Germany to be
friendly and should be prepared to make genuine concessions which
benefit the German. Offer any assistance and be good for it. Never lie
to Germany as Russia, it is way to guarantee A Ber - Pru and A Mun -
Sil. England is Russia's arch enemy, and working with the German is
the only way to solve this problem.
<p><dt>Question two: "What do you intend to build if I give you Sweden?"
<dd>
<ul><li>Correct answer: "Whatever you want"
<li>
Incorrect Answer: "F StP and A War"
</ul>
<p>This is bleedingly obvious. The "trick" is that you should mean what
you say. If Germany gives me Sweden then I really will build F Sev and
A StP if he's asked me to. Why not??? We're working together and if
Germany were gunning my Russia they would be
<ol type=a>
<li>Foolish to have given me Sweden.
<li>Imbecilic.
</ol>
<p><dt>Question three: "How can I trust you?"
<dd> <ul>
<li>Correct answer: "Because it is in my interests to work with you as long
as you don't attack me."
<li>Incorrect answer: "Because if you don't I'll kill you."
</ul>
<p>The correct answer is true. So, as it happens, is the incorrect
answer, but there's no need to say it. Frankly, it astonishes me that
Russia would ever be first in for an attack on Germany. Any gains they
make are just lost to England when the German is eliminated. Attacking
Germany should be Russia's last resort. Sadly at the moment it is all
too often necessary.
</dl>
<p>Generally, Russia and Germany attacking each other is as constructive
as Italy attacking France with one army. The averages bear this out
quite dramatically. Get over F Den - Swe. It doesn't help Germany. And
it results in Russia getting done.
<p>It is in both Germany and Russia's interest to assume a stance of
benevolent neutrality at the start of the game, and sometimes an
active alliance is the only way to prevent EF from overrunning the
board.
<p>Hopefully, if everyone listens to the gist of this article, we can
pull the Russian average back above two at the next tournament... now
if only we can convince people that EG alliances can work we would be
almost back to a balanced game!
