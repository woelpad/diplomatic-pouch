<H1 align=center>Eye of the Storm</H1>
<H2 align=center>A Study of the Centrifuge in the Game 'chaos2'</H2>
<H3 align=center><i>Clinton Wolf</i></H3>
<HR>

<p>A long time ago, in a Zine issue far, far away, I published a <a
href="../../S1999R/Wolf/centrifuge.html">new opening</a>
for the nation of Germany in Diplomacy. At the end of that article I promised a
follow-up detailing the actual gunboat game where I soloed using it, then
proceeded to go horribly delinquent. I finished most of the article text and
formatting by last Fall, lacking only a preface and conclusion. Then I got
involved in the World E-mail Masters Tournament where I figured I should put my
money where my mouth was and attempt the opening in a standard format game.And
because of that, I was afraid to publish anything further until it ended.Ah
yes, the paradox of wanting the fame and recognition of your efforts, but
afraid the look into your psyche shall be used against you.</p>

<i><p>[<b>Editor's note:</b>The delinquency that delayed this article is not
entirely Clinton's -- it was submitted several months ago, on time for the
S2000M issue of the Zine, was accidentally left out, and was further delayed
due to the fact that there was no S2000R issue.] </p></i>

<p>Enough of excuses and cowardice, says I!  The promise shall be fulfilled at
long last.  But first, some credits and disclaimers. </p>

<ul>
<li> Thanks to the
'Realpolitik' program for all maps. 
Each movement and adjustment season is hyperlinked to a visual of the
results. </p>

<li> I have no idea
whether or not some players might have been female in this game, since it was
Gunboat and I didn't bother to follow up after.  I therefore use masculine pronouns exclusively, which is probably
a good guess since so few women seem to grace the hobby (more's the pity!). </p>

<li> I am an opinionated
bastard.  I am fully aware that one or
more of the players involved may end up reading this (I know Russia's player
contacted me awhile back and was interested to see things), but that hasn't
stopped me from expressing a fully subjective and occasionally quite tactless
take on events.  Having been on the
receiving end of broadsides I know it can be not fun, so forgiveness is begged
in advance.  One of the great problems
was that no one involved really bothered with an EOG-- a practice that is quite
the plague these days.  It's too bad,
because I really like to point out my perspective and hear the perspectives of
others.  It also disarms most
accusations of incompetence once you've walked a mile in the other guy's shoes. You might not agree with them, but you can
at least see where they were coming from. 
So, if any of the players wish to contact the Pouch or myself to provide
some insight/counterpoint on events, feel free! </p>

<li> Finally, I make
liberal use of Judge abbreviations throughout this manuscript, and further they
are the particular abbreviations I prefer to use.  I apologize for any confusion that might arise because of this. </p>
</ul>
<p>Since 'chaos2' is a
Gunboat game we skip any thoughts of pre-season Diplomacy and forge directly
into Spring 1901. </p>

<h2><a href="ch2spr01.gif">Movement
results for Spring of 1901</a> </h2>

<p> </p>

<p><b> AUSTRIA </b></p>
<tt>
Army Budapest -&gt; Serbia.
<br>Army Vienna -&gt; Galicia.
<br>Fleet Trieste -&gt; Albania. </p>
</tt>
<p>Austria opens with the &quot;Balkan Gambit&quot;
- Galician variation. Although predictable, this opening is infinitely
forgivable since Austria's early priority is a desperate scramble for survival.
Yachtman and Clarke both agree that this is the best move Austria can make,
especially in nopress. I do as well. Trieste might as well be left undefended
in favor of going for the builds, since if Italy intends to attack, Austria is
almost certainly doomed-- just a matter of sooner or later. </p>

<p>The unexpected success of Vienna -&gt; Galicia
is the only surprise here, and will prove to be a large factor in Russia's
eventual undoing. </p>

<p><b> ENGLAND </b></p>
<tt> Army Liverpool -&gt; Yorkshire.

<br> Fleet Edinburgh -&gt; North Sea.

<br> Fleet London -&gt; English Channel.  (*bounce*)  </tt>

<p> Yorkshire Opening. This is great news for me, as
it's about as anti-French as England can get barring A Lvp-Wal. A convoy to either
Norway or Belgium can commence, with the only snag being if England goes for
Denmark instead. Fortunately Russia has made an anti-English movement and the
French won't be happy either, so I take the gamble that England won't try
making me an enemy as well. I have two units that can bounce him, after all. </p>

<p><b> FRANCE </b></p>

<tt> Army Marseilles -&gt; Spain.
<br> Army Paris -&gt; Burgundy.
<br> Fleet Brest -&gt; English Channel.  (*bounce*)
</tt>

<p> Manche Opening (a.k.a. English Attack). Another
textbook opener that Yachtman praises and Clarke expresses reservations upon.
The very fact that this opening is subtitled &quot;English Attack&quot; is
telling. Paris to Burgundy is a non-issue for me... with Belgium open to a
possible English convoy and the Italian's movements, I find little danger of
Bur-Mun in the Fall and continue my course as planned. England and France are
going to have a very hard time extricating from the war they've started with
one another. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt> Army Berlin -&gt; Prussia.
<br> Army Munich -&gt; Kiel.
<br> Fleet Kiel -&gt; Baltic Sea. </tt>

<p> Well, faithful readers, you of course know what
these moves are the start of... but at the time, I'm sure they confused the
other powers nicely. It bears the closest resemblance to a Prussian Barbarossa,
but the lack of Mun-Sil is a major difference. No data for this opening existed
in the Openings Library as of 6/99, much less when chaos2 started. To most it
seems rather indecisive or crazy. To Russia it probably seems crazy as well,
but the possibility of Bal-Swe and  </p>

<p> Pru-War (or worse a lucky coordination on Warsaw
with Austria in Galicia) will be giving him fits. </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt> Army Rome -&gt; Tuscany.
<br> Army Venice -&gt; Piedmont.
<br> Fleet Naples -&gt; Tyrrhenian Sea.  </tt>

<p> A Western Lepanto, and the angels are on my
shoulders! Italy hasn't attacked Austria or moved to Tyrolia, both of which
would have derailed my plans. Moreover, he is going full steam after France...
it won't get him anywhere fast, but it'll keep France busy and keep England
attacking France in the North, hoping to shake hands with Italy somewhere
around the MAO-Gas-Bur strip. Italy is the only other &quot;gambler&quot; I've
seen so far in this game... will it pay off? </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>
<tt> Army Moscow -&gt; St Petersburg.
<br> Army Warsaw -&gt; Ukraine.
<br> Fleet Sevastopol -&gt; Black Sea.  (*bounce*)
<br> Fleet St Petersburg (south coast) -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.  </tt>

<p> Check that, we have another gambler in Russia...
and an ambitious one at that, gunning for Scandinavia and a strong Southern
presence all at once! This particular opening is colloquially entitled
&quot;The Squid.&quot; </p>

<p> It is possible Russia was hoping for an anti-Turk
alliance with Austria by letting the latter have Galicia, but failing to move F
Sev-Arm and A Mos-Sev undercuts this intent. F Sev bounces uselessly and sets
up no cooperation with the Turk either. From a tactical standpoint all I can
think of is that Russia wanted to be sure of being able to grab Rumania with an
army while still being able to go North... but Austria orders Vie-Gal so often
that this isn't the best way. On the diplomatic side, the only clear signal
Russia has sent is anti-English, which is good news for me! The strong Russian
presence in the North will complicate my strategy, but at least he and England
won't be making nice anytime soon. Nor did he signal any peaceable intent
towards me, which he could have with F StP(sc)-Fin instead of GoB. Russia seems
to be opening hostilities on two fronts and rapidly depriving himself of
possible friends. Perfect. </p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>

<tt> Army Constantinople -&gt; Bulgaria.
<br> Army Smyrna -&gt; Constantinople.
<br> Fleet Ankara -&gt; Black Sea.  (*bounce*)</tt>

<p> Balkan Concentration. Ho hum, but Turkey doesn't
have too many options socked away in his corner and can afford patience.
If  this were a press game I'd suspect
the bounce as arranged since  Russia left
such a weak Southern presence (Turkey could pick up the Juggernaut slack). In this
case though it's such a common move nothing can be gleaned from it either
tactically or diplomatically. </p>

<p> 

<h2><a href="ch2fal01.gif">Movement
results for Fall of 1901</a> </h2>

<p><b> AUSTRIA </b></p>



<tt>Army Serbia SUPPORT Army Galicia -&gt; Rumania.</tt><br>

<tt>Army Galicia -&gt; Rumania.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Albania -&gt; Greece.</tt><br>

<p> Absolutely and completely brilliant. Austria
does the unthinkable and goes on the offensive in 1901, and <u>almost</u> gets
Rumania except for a pure chance coordination on the parts of Russia and
Turkey. His three home centers were open for three builds, as well. As it
stands, he bounces the Russian fleet and ensures Russia only gets one build,
which is good for both of us... meanwhile Austria gets two builds and maintains
a strategic forward position in Galicia. The only problem is that the chance
Russo-Turkish cooperation means the Juggernaut now looms against him. </p>

<p><b> ENGLAND </b></p>

<tt>Army Yorkshire -&gt; North Sea -&gt; Norway.</tt><br>

<tt> Fleet North Sea CONVOY Army Yorkshire -&gt; Norway. </tt><br>

<tt>Fleet London -&gt; English Channel. </tt><br>

<p> England picks up Norway for its traditional
build, despite the Russian presence... a gamble, but so were Belgium and
Denmark, and England apparently correctly guesses that the anti-Russian opening
of Germany has spooked the Tsar and made him move A StP-Fin to rectify a likely
denial of Sweden (F Bal-Swe). England also gets lucky with the Channel as the
French fleet sails out to presumably engage the Italians in the coming year. On
the downside for me, </p>

<p> Scandinavia is getting rather crowded. On the
upside, the English army threatens St. Petersburg. </p>

<p><b> FRANCE </b></p>

<tt>Army Spain HOLD.</tt><br>

<tt>Army Burgundy -&gt; Belgium.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Brest -&gt; Mid-Atlantic Ocean.</tt><br>

<p> France apparently plays three guessing games
here, and loses two of them. While it's difficult to say what the thinking
behind Bre-MAO was-- I don't know why he thought England wouldn't move to the
Channel since moving the fleets into position on Norway would require passing
up the build. On the other hand, an England thinking long term would realize
his hold on Norway would be tenuous at best and might have chosen patience and
positioning over quick growth. More likely France was simply opening Brest up
for a new fleet build, but his miscalculation on Italy leaves him only one
build and his heartland laid open. France's sole bright spot is gaining Belgium
(Have a bone, Frenchie! Thanks for not taking Munich!), but with England and
Italy encroaching he's not likely to hold it for long unless I help out...
which I'm not ready to do just yet. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt>Army Prussia -&gt; Baltic Sea -&gt; Denmark.</tt><br>

<tt>Army Kiel -&gt; Holland.</tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Baltic Sea CONVOY Army Prussia -&gt; Denmark.  </tt>

<p> The first circling commences like clockwork, and
my risks have paid off. Diplomatically, just about everything favors my
strategy at the moment... but Scandinavia is quite crowded and if England and
Russia start working together I could be hosed. Two new German units will quiet
any vulture-ish thoughts from others in the meantime. </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt>Army Tuscany -&gt; Piedmont.</tt><br>

<tt>Army Piedmont -&gt; Marseilles.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Tyrrhenian Sea -&gt; Tunis. </tt><br>

<p> Oh my God, he actually did it. He actually took
Marseilles! France's decision to call the Italian bluff, and Italy's answering
move that shows it was no bluff, has made for a five center Italy at the end of
1901. The success will no doubt keep Italy going in that direction. An unspoken
&quot;Central Triple&quot; seems to have formed, with non-aggression between
GIA leading to success for all. And thank heaven, because if Italy got
stonewalled against France he might turn back East or North. </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>

<tt>Army St Petersburg -&gt; Finland.</tt><br>

<tt>Army Ukraine -&gt; Warsaw.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Sevastopol -&gt; Rumania.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Gulf of Bothnia -&gt; Sweden. </tt><br>

<p> Austria's army in Galicia means I can't
necessarily take credit for A Pru as being the reason for the Russian backpedal
to protect Warsaw, but I would venture that it at least helped. My Spring moves
probably made me look just crazy enough to try for it, whereas Austria could
more easily be written off as not having the luxury. Without the opening of A
Ber-Pru a correct Russian guess would have netted him Rumania this turn, with
the Turk lending his timely support. So on the surface my theory behind A
Ber-Pru (relieving pressure on Austria and thus preventing Russian builds)
seems to have been sound. Russia's army finds itself back in Warsaw with no one
to fight, and an Austrian army

still on his borders. </p>

<p> Meanwhile in the North, Russia wisely foregoes
bouncing England out of Norway in favor of going for Sweden and moving A
StP-Fin... presumably for one unit to support the other into Sweden next turn
should I bounce him out this year. He no doubt is seeking for English help at
the moment, attempting to redress his earlier aggressions. Will my
&quot;retreat&quot; cause the Bear to change directions before the final drive,
as my theories hope?  </p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>

<tt> Army Bulgaria SUPPORT Russian Fleet Sevastopol -&gt; Rumania. </tt><br>

<tt>Army Constantinople SUPPORT Army Bulgaria.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Ankara -&gt; Black Sea. </tt><br>

<p> Pretty amazing guesswork and team spirit here
from the Turk, without which a six center Austria could have been on its way to
Juggernauting the Juggernauters! He correctly figures that Ukraine will cover
Warsaw and that Russia must use his only other unit in the sphere, the fleet,
as a last ditch hope for getting Rumania. Despite moving to the Black Sea, the
support combined with no armies in Smyrna or Armenia all but cements an
alliance with a Russia that was badly in need of friends. </p>

<h2><a href="ch2win01.gif">Adjustment
orders for Winter of 1901</a> </h2>

<p><b> AUSTRIA </b></p>

<tt>Builds an army in Budapest. </tt><br>

<tt>Builds a fleet in Trieste. </tt><br>

<p> Austria displays some long term strategic
thinking to accompany his tactical acumen. With Italy engaged in the West and
the start of a Juggernaut attempt clearly signaled last turn, Austria plugs up
its landward side and prepares another fleet to counter the Turk on the seas.
Austria is cemented in my mind at this point as such a good player that I have
no illusions that he might attack Italy. I silently wish him Godspeed in his
coming fight. </p>

<p><b> ENGLAND </b></p>

<tt>Builds a fleet in London.  </tt><br>

<p> The army in Norway is in something of a
vulnerable position, particularly if Russia builds in St. Petersburg. I would
have expected F Edi in order to help out in Scandinavia... instead F Lon, which
can't go much of anywhere if Nth supports Nwy to hold as I expect.  </p>

<p><b> FRANCE </b></p>

<tt>Builds a fleet in Brest. </tt><br>

<p> France stoically sticks to his original plan, perhaps
wanting to punish England and try to signal me for help. Another look at the
board shows that by risking Belgium, France can cover all his other assets in
Spring by bouncing Spain and Brest over Gascony and moving Belgium to Burgundy.
Meanwhile F MAO can try for the W Med, and if it bounces with Tunis can take
Portugal in Fall. All in all, not too bad a plan, if it is indeed his plan. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt>Builds an army in Munich. </tt><br>

<tt>Builds a fleet in Kiel. </tt><br>

<p> Will the Bear swallow the bait? Will England stay
frosty despite the new fleet and the swing back towards him last turn? Will the
non-American readers of The Pouch be able to forge a path through my
continuing, copious use of slang?  </p>

<p> I have an inkling that F Lon indicates the
Englishman figured my reversal as coming back to try to share in the spoils of
a besieged France... he isn't sure of that though, or he would have built in
Liverpool. </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt>Builds an army in Rome. </tt><br>

<tt>Builds a fleet in Naples. </tt><br>

<p> Army Rome is surprising and alarming. It's not
army Venice, but Pie-Tyr, Rom-Ven is a possibility for Spring. On the other
hand, why abandon his rare and lovely inroad into France? I would have built
two fleets and tried to break out into the Atlantic while Piedmont supported
Marseilles until a fleet supported push could occur, but perhaps Italy is
hoping to once again get lucky. If France is setting up as savvy a defense as I
think he is, Italy is in for a rude surprise. Hopefully not rude enough to make
him change tacks. </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>

<tt>Builds an army in Moscow. </tt><br>

<p> Hmm. Warsaw and Sevastopol are occupied, but St.
Petersburg was an option. Is the Bear moving to plug the Ukranian gap? Or is
this a feint before he moves West or North? A Mos has a lot of options, and
could take a lot of the steam out of my coming surprise. </p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>

<tt>Builds a fleet in Smyrna. </tt><br>

<p> Juggernaut confirmed. Good luck, Austria! You'll
need it! </p>

<p> 

<h2><a href="ch2spr02.gif">Movement

<tt> Army Budapest SUPPORT Army Galicia
-&gt; Rumania. </tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Trieste -&gt; Albania.  </tt><br>

<p> Austria takes the chance that Russia will once
again 'Squid' (A Mos-StP, A War-Ukr) and split his forces rather than
concentrate Southwards, with stunning results. Truly, the best defense is
sometimes a good offense! Hanging onto Rumania in Fall will be impossible if
Russia and Turkey manage to coordinate again, but Austria has bought himself some
time and given RT a black eye. Admittedly this is a nopress game where the full
weight of a Juggernaut can't be brought to bear, but watching Austria hold them
both off all by his lonesome is a sight to see! Can he repeat the performance
in Fall? As expected, the newly built fleet is on its way to plug the Ionian...
and if everything goes as planned Austria will get some unexpected help from
his German buddy that just rammed two fleets up the Bear's furry heiney. </p>

<p><b> ENGLAND </b></p>

<tt>Army Norway HOLD.</tt><br>

<tt> Fleet North Sea SUPPORT Fleet English Channel -&gt; Belgium. </tt><br>

<tt>Fleet English Channel -&gt; Belgium.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet London -&gt; English Channel.</tt><br>

<p> Yow. England took a huge risk by not supporting
Norway to hold. I'm not sure if he was moving against me, or France, or both...
but fortunately my move and Russia's move will quickly change the English mind,
assuming he was going after me. </p>

<p><b> FRANCE </b></p>



<tt>Army Spain -&gt; Marseilles.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army Belgium -&gt; Burgundy.</tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean -&gt; Western Mediterranean.  (*bounce*) </tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Brest -&gt; Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  (*bounce*) </tt><br>

<p> Okay, France wasn't quite as smart as I thought.
Maybe after my turnaround and fleet build he was expecting me to come to his
rescue against England, which would leave him free to redress his Italian
grievances. Still, a savvy Italian could have slipped into Gascony and caused
all manner of problems for Fall. France loses Belgium, but that isn't really
his fault, he merely once again comes out on the wrong end of a calculated
risk. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt>Army Denmark -&gt; Sweden.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army Holland HOLD.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Baltic Sea -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.</tt><br>

<tt>Army Munich -&gt; Kiel.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Kiel -&gt; Baltic Sea. </tt><br>

<p> Paydirt. The &quot;retreat&quot; worked like a
charm on Russia and he swallowed the bait of peace hook, line, and sinker. He
probably read my change of frontage and builds as anti-English, which would
explain the move he attempts. Or maybe he just was making an opportunistic stab
at getting all of Scandinavia for himself. By accident or design he has enough
units in the North that I have some tactical trials ahead, but diplomatically
he just sunk himself with his greed. </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt>Army Piedmont -&gt; Marseilles.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army Marseilles -&gt; Spain.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Tunis -&gt; Western Mediterranean.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army Rome -&gt; Tuscany.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Naples -&gt; Tyrrhenian Sea. </tt><br>

<p> An addendum to my comments on what I would have
done as Italy. Italy is free to move Marseilles in Spring and try to slip past
the French defense, which he apparently correctly realizes and tries. France
however outguesses him both on land and on sea, preventing any thought of a
convoy to Spain in Fall. In Fall the maneuverability is lost now that France
has two armies on Marseilles. A Mar will need to hold with support, or Italy
risks losing the rare jewel he received in 1901. </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>

<tt>Army Finland -&gt; Norway.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army Warsaw -&gt; Ukraine.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Sevastopol -&gt; Rumania.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Sweden SUPPORT Army Finland -&gt; Norway.  (*cut*) </tt><br>

<tt>Army Moscow -&gt; St Petersburg. </tt><br>

<p> I don't know what England was thinking by not
supporting Norway, but suddenly my army in Denmark becomes the unwitting hero
of the hour by cutting off the Swedish fleet and thus saving the English army
from utter destruction. England suddenly sees my fleets weren't aimed at him
(though he apparently doesn't realize they will be eventually), but moreover
has a near disaster at the hands of a backstabbing Bear averted only by timely
German intervention. Russia's timing couldn't have been worse, as England will
at most support Norway to hold and at worst may actually join in with my
attack! I prefer the former, since England is my next target and I would rather
his fleets still be fooling around against France. </p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>

<tt> Army Bulgaria SUPPORT Russian Fleet Sevastopol -&gt; Rumania.  (*cut*) </tt><br>

<tt>Army Constantinople SUPPORT Army Bulgaria.</tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Black Sea SUPPORT Russian Fleet Sevastopol -&gt; Rumania. </tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Smyrna -&gt; Aegean Sea. </tt><br>

<p> More team spirit from the Turk while he gets his
new fleet into open water. If they do full supports of F Sev-Rum in Fall
they'll finally make it in. It would be better to get the army in instead, but
with nopress neither can be sure the other will be able to coordinate a change
of plan. F Bla will be tied up supporting the attack, meaning that F Aeg and A
Con will have to support Bulgaria in place. Trying to move it is too great a
risk against the clever and aggressive Austrian, who might very well try a
3-strong attack from Rumania into Bulgaria. Austria has actually maneuvered RT
into trying to hold on and recover lost time, rather than making an offensive! </p>

<p> 

<h2><a href="ch2fal02.gif">Movement

<tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT Army Rumania.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Albania -&gt; Ionian Sea. </tt><br>

<p> Austria's play so far had led me to expect a big
attempt at Bulgaria, but in analysis this move isn't bad... in fact, it's
probably better. Austria really can't afford to take the chance of losing
Greece in a Fall turn, and while F Alb could have supported Greece to
hold,  Austria didn't want to waste any
more time positioning it to bottle up the Turk. The cost is losing a center
without any gains to soften the blow... but then again Austria is showing
foresight here by  taking the loss now
instead of going to Bulgaria where he can likely be vaporized in Spring
(ouch!). He also plays an interesting card by as much as inviting Russia in
with a friendly gesture. With Galicia empty and Sevastopol open for building a
second Russian fleet this actually could have been an option had I not began my
systematic rampage in the North. Still, if Russia goes for it I'm in trouble...
this offer of alliance is showing me that Austria is the only other power in
the game looking at the whole board in a long-term sense. He knows that he can
fight off R/T for a long time as long as Italy stays friendly, but Italy won't
stay friendly forever and in the meantime Austria is locked down and static. My
midgame success likewise depends a great deal on Austria being in just this
static state, and Austria's shown such skill so far I can't help but assume the
worst. Namely, that he sees that not only will an A/R against the Turk at this
point get him growing and maneuvering again, but every build Russia gets out of
it will slow me down-- without Austria having to actually raise a finger of his
own against me. </p>

<p> I'm banking on Russia to not be quite so
imaginative, probably simply chortling at finally &quot;outsmarting&quot;
Austria and blindly continuing the R/T. There's also the outside possibility
that Austria's alliance wrangling is aimed at preparing him for Italy, who was
making way against France far faster than expected and would no doubt be
sniffing around Trieste soon. </p>

<tt>Fleet Belgium SUPPORT Fleet English Channel.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet English Channel SUPPORT Fleet Belgium. </tt><br>

<p> Well, England heeded his wake-up call in Norway,
but he's staying pretty neutral. That's okay, his static orders this turn are playing
right into my hands. The big question is, where and what will he build? That
will speak reams about his future intentions. </p>

<p><b> FRANCE </b></p>

<tt>Army Spain -&gt; Marseilles.</tt><br>

<tt> Army Burgundy SUPPORT Army Spain -&gt; Marseilles. </tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean -&gt; Portugal.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Brest HOLD. </tt><br>

<p> It shouldn't have worked. But then again, Italy
taking Marseilles in '01 shouldn't have worked either, so this redresses the
balance. Fleet Brest HOLD is odd on the surface, but not in light of the big
picture. France wants desperately to have one front and thus is not only
conceding Belgium but also peacefully defending Brest rather than heading to
the Channel. Not only that, but his presence in Brest means England has no
worries about another fleet being built. Still, I would have chanced Bre -&gt;
Gas just to ensure the Italian's destruction if Marseilles was retaken. France
loses Belgium, but keeps Spain, retakes Marseilles and occupies Portugal. His
peacemaking overtures to England show wisdom but depend on England stopping his
French tunnel vision long enough to wake up to the threat I'm eventually going
to pose to him. While not quite as tactically sound as Austria, France is
someone else to watch out for should his current recovery streak continue. He's
thinking ahead-- but Bre S Eng would have been stronger than simply holding. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>



<tt>Army Denmark -&gt; Sweden.</tt><br>

<tt> Army Holland SUPPORT French Army Burgundy -&gt; Belgium.  (*void*) </tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Gulf of Bothnia SUPPORT Army Denmark -&gt; Sweden. </tt><br>

<tt>Army Kiel -&gt; Munich.</tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Baltic Sea SUPPORT Army Denmark -&gt; Sweden.  </tt><br>

<p> The crowded state of Scandinavia caused me to
have to alter my plans away from a convoy, and to compound that, for the first
time this game I'm making some unfortunate mistakes. Army Holland held last
year which is usually considered a no-no in Diplomacy, but unlike France in
Brest I was adjacent to two powers and unwilling to display favoritism to
either (as support would entail). Sometime between Spring and Fall I'd
convinced myself that England just <u>had</u> to have realized that stopping me from
overrunning Scandinavia and Russia was as important or more important than
going after France. This Fall he was more occupied with supporting two units
that would have been destroyed if successfully dislodged, so I wasn't worried
about Denmark yet. But army Norway was free to support Sweden to hold if
England did the smart thing and discarded Russia's attempt to stab in light of
the new circumstances. With St. Petersburg out of the question all I could do
was try for Sweden with my two uncuttable fleet supports and hope for the
best... I was assuming that Russia would definitely retake Rumania this year,
so if I didn't take a SC from him to counter that he would get a build and I
could end up with serious problems. I had to take a gamble that England stayed
as shortsighted as he'd been playing so far... and that was a heck of a gamble
since it could have failed and I'd gone against my plans of Western  neutrality and ordered a (wasted!)
anti-English support for France! </p>

<p> I think I also got nervous that a desperate
France, theoretically unable to keep Belgium or retake Marseilles, would make a
grab for Munich. So I felt I had to protect against that as well as send him a
signal that he had at least one friend around who would help him out (that way
hopefully dissuading him from any other thoughts of cannibalizing me to stay
alive a bit longer against EI). Tactically it was a bad choice. If I hadn't
taken Sweden my units would have ended up seriously disconnected in '03, with
all my positioning of the first years coming to naught... this in spite of my
risking Denmark just so I could keep my fleets in open water and my convoy
options intact! There would have been no army available to convoy! </p>

<p> Nasty blunders all around, including that my
necessarily hasty capture of Sweden allows for a Russian forward retreat
to  Skagerrak... in fact forces Russia
to do so! And if Russia and England weren't working together this turn, after
my ill-considered support and the French peace offerings they're sure to be on
the same page in 1903. Sigh. </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt>Army Tuscany -&gt; Piedmont.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Tyrrhenian Sea SUPPORT Fleet Tunis -&gt; Western Mediterranean.  </tt><br>

<p> Italy boggles my mind by repeating his Spring
moves, which have almost nil chance of success (why would France move Spa -&gt;
Gas without Bre-Gas, the only circumstance where this has any value?). Perhaps
Italy is a new player who is unaware that units cannot cut supports against
themselves? Or perhaps he was gambling on France not using A Bur against
Marseilles? If so, why not order a move to Burgundy or Gascony? In any case his
foothold in Marseilles was too precious a thing for this big gamble, especially
in Fall-- and he paid the price. On the other hand, France's failure to move F
Bre-Gas in conjunction with the attack is going to cause headaches for him.
Wanting to cover Brest is understandable, but Italy can retreat to Gascony,
disband the comparatively useless army in Tuscany and cause some serious
problems even after army Paris is built. </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA

<tt>Fleet Sweden SUPPORT English Army Norway.  (*cut, dislodged*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army St Petersburg HOLD. </tt><br>

<p> Russia does what he can against my assault, but
without English help it's doomed. Still, he does the smart thing and is all but
crying out for the English to come around and aid him. His forward retreat into
Skaggerak is going to be very troublesome, especially if England starts
cooperating against me. </p>

<p> Meanwhile in the South, the expected capture of
Rumania with the fleet commences and Russia will stay even in builds. He left
Austria a retreat to Galicia though... will he regret that? In the long run F
Rum is a rather impotent commodity against Austria, so perhaps he'll warm up to
Austria's tempting offers of peace and turn on the Turk. </p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>



<tt>Army Bulgaria -&gt; Serbia.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army Constantinople -&gt; Bulgaria.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Black Sea SUPPORT Russian Fleet Sevastopol -&gt; Rumania. </tt><br>

<tt> Fleet Aegean Sea SUPPORT Army Constantinople -&gt; Bulgaria.   </tt><br>

<p> On the surface this looks rather useless, but if
you look closely it shows the Turk has most of his bases covered and at least
tries to keep moving. Austria may be daring but I certainly wouldn't have
expected him to move Serbia somewhere... Turkey's move cuts a possible support
to hold Rumania, which is about the same as supporting in Russia's fleet, but
on the snowball's chance in Hades that Austria does vacate Turkey advances
rather smartly. It can be supposed that's better than no chance at all. Smyrna
and Constantinople meanwhile organize a &quot;beleaguered garrison&quot;
defense of Bulgaria... it all falls apart if Austria orders the three strong
attack from Rumania, but again that would have just trapped Austria. On the
other hand, now that I think about it, Austria could have weakened the Turk at
the same time as asking for a Russian alliance, with the Turk the natural target.
And the risk of losing Greece might not have been all that big a deal, but I
can hardly say my own play this turn was perfect. </p>

<h2>Retreat orders for Fall of
1902. </h2>



<p><b> AUSTRIA </b></p>

<tt>Army Rumania DISBAND.</tt><br>

<p> Can Austria possibly have sent a clearer olive branch
out to Russia? His retreat to Galicia was open... between this and the support
there's no way Russia can't get the message. What will his answer be? </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt> Army Burgundy -&gt; Gascony. </tt><br>

<p> Yep. France can probably destroy this annoyance
in Spring if he moves right. But in the meantime it'll be an important thorn in
his side as Italy moves his fleets into position. It'll certainly see more
action than A Tus would! </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>

<tt>Fleet Sweden DISBAND. </tt><br>

<p> *blink* A gift from the Dip Gods. I guess Russia
never believed Austria would disband and so wanted to free up a build to cover
Warsaw. This is very good news for me... not only does it show a continuing
distrust of Austria but Denmark is safe from the possibility of Anglo-Russo
alliance against it. On the downside, much like Austria's disband the Russian
disband could be a follow up signal to England that Russia no longer plans to
be a threat to him. </p>

<h2><a href="ch2win02.gif">Adjustment
orders for Winter of 1902</a> </h2>

<p><b> AUSTRIA </b></p>

<tt>Builds an army in Vienna. </tt><br>

<p> Perhaps dismayed at the implications of the Russian
fleet disband, or perhaps wisely making sure Galicia can still be contested and
not wishing to risk angering Italy, Austria rebuilds in Vienna.  </p>

<p><b> ENGLAND </b></p>

<tt>Builds a fleet in Liverpool. </tt><br>

<p> I can't believe my eyes, and I'm sure Russia
can't either. Perhaps still smarting from the failed stab, England is
abandoning Russia to hang in the North as he continues his war against France.
This lack of long term vision will cost him. </p>



<p><b> FRANCE </b></p>

<tt>Builds an army in Paris. </tt><br>

<p> Where else could he build? France is back in the
game despite the single-minded aggressions of England and Italy, but will lose
valuable time and position dealing with the Gascony problem. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt>Builds a fleet in Kiel. </tt><br>

<p> Well, I once again overestimated my opponent. I
thought there was no way England wouldn't turn on me after the Russian olive
branches and my failed support of the French to Belgium, so I figured I'd
better get another fleet out for defense and eventual offense against the new
foe. The &quot;foe&quot; meanwhile appears to have continued on a course of
blind trust in me, and blind aggression on France (despite F Bre's admittedly
weak plea for peace). It doesn't make sense, but I'm not complaining. Surely
this third fleet will wake England up, though? </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt>Removes the army in Gascony. </tt><br>

<p> Strike all that about France having a Gascony
headache. I can't believe Italy did this... so what if the army got vaporized,
he had an opportunity to take MAO while France was preoccupied with it, then
rebuild! He's either planning to switch fronts and attack Austria with his
armies (dumb), or expecting a convoy of Tuscany to Spain to work (also dumb).
Italy had gotten some incredibly lucky breaks advancing against France that by
rights should never have happened, but now he's blown them all and allowed France
to recover. </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>

<tt>Builds an army in Warsaw. </tt><br>

<p> You know, on further consideration Russia's
disband didn't have to imply he was anti-Austrian... he could have built a
fleet in Sevastopol and surprised the heck out of Turkey! Austria bent over
backwards to sue for peace, but at this point it looks like all his efforts
were for naught. Maybe Russia was also expecting me to build A Ber and start a
land assault, but his build here gives Austria all the wrong signals and
eliminates any thought of attacking the Turk... and I'm glad! </p>

<p>


<p> So, an interesting turn. Russia extends a plea
for peace and alliance to England and is ignored, meanwhile Russia in turn
ignores a similar plea from Austria. I've overestimated E &amp; R and
needlessly worried myself, but by now I can see a pretty clear picture. England
and Russia are concerned only with their own situations and not looking at the
rest of the board... and even in their own spheres they're not looking ahead
more than a year at most. Italy's confused, Turkey's stagnant, and France and
Austria are being hampered by the same lack of long term planning in England
and Russia that's helping me. All in all, I've come through this year in great
shape despite my blunders, and if England doesn't get his act together soon the
Northeast is going to be all mine. </p>

<p> Austria does the must-move of defending Galicia
in Spring, and has to be tearing his hair out at Russia's single-mindedness.
The move to the East Med is gutsy but could end up being a mistake... Turkey
can defend Smyrna with A Con and support Bulgaria to hold with F Bla while
slipping the Aegean fleet into the Ionian. But will the Turk see that, or will
Austria's aggressive defenses continue to keep the Juggernaut intimidated and
mentally on the run? </p>

<p><b> ENGLAND </b></p>

<p> Oh this is too much. Three German fleets and England
not only is staying neutral but sending out peace/alliance feelers... it's like
I'm holding his entire nation hostage by threatening Belgium! I feel almost
criminal as I plan out my upcoming stab, but for now I might as well feed his
delusions until I grab St. Pete's and put Russia out of the Northern picture
for good. </p>

<p> France expects me to repeat my support to
Belgium, but this time I actually played as if England would continue being
friendly to me despite my having built another fleet (he's blithely ignored all
the other warning signs!). Sure England, let's be good buddies... heh, heh... </p>

<p> Meanwhile, as expected the disband of army
Gascony leaves France free to maneuver and Italy's prospects withering on the
vines. When England attacks, Italy may make progress again, but he'll probably
end up with the short end of the stick. Except for the fact I'm going to stab
England. But then, I'm also going to start supporting France against Italy when
I do. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt>Fleet Baltic Sea -&gt; Livonia.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Kiel -&gt; Helgoland Bight. </tt><br>

<p> I'm holding to strict neutrality on the
continent while I patiently draw the noose tight around St. Petersburg. My
support order is a ruse of course, intended to ensure England gets no sudden
ideas about supporting St. Petersburg to hold. It also makes F Kie -&gt; Hel
look less threatening. I wouldn't take it as non-threatening (leaving it in
Kiel could defend Holland and Denmark just as well without threatening the
North Sea), but England so far has displayed a charming tendency to overlook
such things. The move results of Spring 1902, where Russia attacks and I save
his limey hide, must still have him hypnotized. </p>

<p><b> ITALY

<tt>Army Tuscany SUPPORT Army Piedmont.</tt><br>

<p> We see the bitter fruits for Italy of disbanding
the Gascony army as he enters a hold and two useless supports, not even
bothering to give signaling supports with them. He must be a newbie, and in
addition he doesn't seem to have any real plan going, as no convoy materializes
and no attack on Austria commences. Bad alternatives, but better than
disbanding Gascony only to follow up with this! A fall convoy to Spain can
work, but only because he got lucky again with England building in Liverpool
and moving on MAO. One of these days Italy's luck is going to run out,
though... hopefully around the time I reach him. </p>

<p> Russia scrambles to retreat and cover Livonia,
but I've planned well and England's refusal to get involved has left him
trapped. Barring the smart  (and thus
unlikely) English reversal, St. Pete's is doomed. Meanwhile he well and truly
burns his bridges with Austria in the South, and I therefore feel no pity for
him. </p>

<p> A good try, but the useless Russian fleet is
leaving Austria in a much better defensive position than can be cracked through
force, and Russia's armies are tied down with Galicia. Will Turkey recognize
this and go for the Ionian sneak? </p>

<p> Austria doesn't cover for an Ionian move, but as

that Austria's attempts at finding a Southern ally have proven useless, perhaps
I'll step in and give him a hand... or perhaps not, he'd be rather dangerous to

<p> My God, England just abandoned the North Sea
right before the year I'm moving to stab him. Italy isn't the only one getting
some incredibly lucky breaks in this game... of course, the difference will be
apparent once I move in on it, since I plan to capitalize on this opening for all
it's worth! </p>

<tt>Army Paris -&gt; Brest. </tt><br>

<p> You can tell France just reached the breaking
point. First he was trying to sue for peace with England as he moved on
Italy... now England's blind belligerence is causing the opposite, and France
not only manages to hang onto Marseilles <u>and</u> Spain but steams into NAO and
teaches England a lesson about leaving open the back door. I don't know if he
sees my stab of England coming, but I'm sure he'll feel immensely satisfied as
he watches (and helps!) in the collapse. Just to kick him out of Liverpool will
require a major English retreat that might save Brest or make England risk
Belgium. I hope it's the latter, I have my eye on that center as part of the
coming attack. </p>

<tt>Fleet Helgoland Bight -&gt; Denmark. </tt><br>

<p> I move Munich to Berlin just in case Russia got
frisky with Warsaw and marched it west. In retrospect a weak move, though it
sends another subtle signal to France that I'm not against him, without the
obviousness of something like a move to Ruhr. Most of my navy is by necessity
out of position and will need some time to get West. Plus England's army and Russia's
army will need tending to, though I expect a Russian retreat of StP -&gt;
Moscow, and a disband of A Fin since everything else is rather crucial and
Finland can be easily popped in Spring. Russia's armies in Warsaw and Ukraine
should be locked down indefinitely, contesting Galicia... but most importantly
England's blunders of letting France into the NAO and leaving the North Sea
open have stepped up my timetable. I can't let this circumstance slip by! </p>

<p> Oy. The convoy occurs, but to the eminently

silly moves... you never learn they're silly. </p>

<p> Russia's not too bad a short-term tactician when
on the ropes. I had to make the moves I did and put the fleets out of position
rather than convoying the army to StP, for just the reasons Russia's attempted
move illustrates. The units in the South are helplessly mired, but the doomed A
StP makes one final  attempt at
signaling England for help before I shove it out... better than wasting the
move on a futile defense. Even the self-centered Russia has to be gaping in
utter horror at the North Sea abandonment. </p>

<tt>Builds an army in Kiel.  </tt><br>

<p> Tellingly, I'm the only one to build this year.
Rather than build a fourth fleet and once again chance that England will brush
it off, I build an army (I've got inland gaps to start worrying about plugging,
anyhow). My occupation of Berlin serves another purpose here in that England
can't wonder why I didn't build the army there. I'm probably giving him too
much credit again, but soon it won't matter. If everything goes right Belgium and
Norway will both be mine this year and France might just hang onto Liverpool as
a bonus! By then I'll be in position to force my way into the North Sea and
convoy an army onto the Isles. England's days are numbered. </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>

<p> Just as expected, and my way against England is

two units on Liverpool this turn France has a shot at a supply center with

<p> The German war machine grinds into motion,
patiently setting up position to start smashing England down in Fall. Too bad
the move to the North Sea failed, but it keeps England out. My units in
Scandinavia play musical chairs to gain maximum effect. Next turn, the fleet
will crush the English army, which will have no retreat due to my army's
presence in Finland. That army moves closer to Russia, and the fleet will join
Fleet Denmark in pressuring the North Sea. </p>

<p> England has an even worse dilemma with Belgium.
If he supports to hold Fleet Denmark will gain the North Sea... if he supports
Eng-Nth he loses Belgium and bounces with Denmark again. If he supports Bel-Nth
he gains the North, but again loses Belgium. He left himself hideously open and
I've taken advantage to give him a nice, no-win situation. </p>

<p> I'll probably end up regretting moving to

<p> Well, France switches tacks again and it looks
like Italy won't have quite as easy a time as he might have thought. In
hindsight I have to admit this is superior to retaking Brest even though A Mar
got destroyed. Brest would have had to keep being defended, while Paris is completely
out of England's reach. Marseilles was doomed but France at least gets Spain
back and sets up a line of defense against further Italian advances. Meanwhile
the &quot;lost&quot; French fleet drops anchor in Liverpool and due to A Mar's

<p> The machine grinds onwards on perfect schedule
and I use the static fleet in StP to signal France. Hopefully he might keep his

signals him where my intentions lie. I had to keep army Ruhr where it was in

<p> An interesting counter to my move to Silesia! Or
perhaps Russia was already planning to do it when army Moscow headed South.
He's going to end up regretting it though, as he lets Austria into Galicia just
as the Turk leaves the Black Sea, and leaves a gap in the Ukraine that's got to
have Austria salivating. Meanwhile it looks like he's caught me off guard, but
my two builds will be more than adequate to stem his assault. </p>

<p> Aha, the reason for supporting Con -&gt; Smy
last turn, which I failed to consider. The Black Sea fleet is on its way to try
to break through the Austrian naval blockade, and it looks like my meddling in
Galicia was timely. Russia's fleet is caught flatfooted in its Rumanian harbor
as the support vanishes, and faces three hostile units. If Austria goes that
way only using Sevastopol to support to hold and an accompanying Turk move of
Bul -&gt; Ser will save the day. But to tie down Sevastopol could mean letting
the savvy Austria into Ukraine at the same time my army arrives in St. Pete's.
The mighty Juggernaut is now not only stopped in its tracks, but in danger of

<p> France comes out on the wrong end as Italy pulls

trying to defend Marseilles. Burgundy -&gt; Paris is interesting. If England
wants a sure capture of Belgium he'll have to use all three units on it and

<p> My Scandinavian army finally slides into
position on Russia's flank while the Tsar's invasion is met head on by my
defenses. If he attacks from Prussia he'll get into Silesia but I'll get into
Prussia behind him and retreat Silesia to Munich, where I can defend Berlin
with a self-bounce over it in Fall and retreat to Livonia if he dislodges A
Pru. It would have been interesting, but Russia does the expected, attacking
with Warsaw. No one gets anywhere and his surprise onslaught is stopped in its
tracks. </p>

<p> Meanwhile my noose on the North Sea draws tight
exactly as I had planned it to when I first began contemplating the English
stab, and England's blindness to my wiles has ensured it will fall. Unlike the
dislodge of the Russian fleet in Sweden, this time there will be no mistakes--
if England retreats to Skaggerak he will be trapped by the fleet steaming in
from the GoB to Sweden and destroyed in short order. The worst England can do
is retreat to the Norwegian Sea, and even there he won't be causing too much mischief. </p>

<p> My one miscalculation is having left Belgium
vulnerable due to my need to plug up English retreat options. Fortunately
again, France's moves make losing Belgium a very faint risk due to what England
leaves open to do so. Good thing France went to Wales and didn't head North to
Edinburgh like I suggested! </p>

<p> Not too shabby! Looks like he's finally learning

Austria he really shouldn't be telegraphing like that. Then again, maybe along
with his awakened sense of tactics Italy actually looked ahead to the fact that
Turkey is trying to get two fleets out and one could have slipped into the
Ionian all this time? Austria may have found that an acceptable risk, but it
should have had Italy sweating long before now. </p>

<p> A very odd set of moves, especially from Austria
where they're unlikely to be the result of a mistake. As near as I can figure
it Austria got extremely nervous about the Italian fleet and thought it was
going to support the Turkish army into Greece. This was a silly way to cover
for it though since Rumania was almost certain to be attacked by Russia. Serbia
supporting Greece to hold (or S Gre -&gt; Bul) along with EMed to Ionian would
have been much better. If the idea was to signal Turkey for alliance, why not
give up Greece to him? He certainly can't be expecting Turkey to agree to  trade Greece for Bulgaria. A Rum S A Bul
along with Greece moving out would have extended the olive branch far better.
Austria could have lost out big here if Turkey repeated his orders from last

<p> England goes a step further than peace and
actually calls for an alliance with Italy against me. England probably doesn't
yet realize how doomed he is-- or perhaps he does. Using the fleet to prod the
opportunistic Italian towards empty Munich is ingenious... Italy has a build
this year and an interest in advancing through France. Building A Ven and
moving it to Tyrolia would really make problems for me, but it won't save
England. </p>

<p> I'm a bit worried at the prospect of a Russian
suicide attempt on me, since Austria and Italy are getting to the point where
they can start taking me on. So I send the signal that I don't mind him holding
on to Moscow. Unfortunately the two on two in the Berlin-Warsaw area
necessitated the defensive moves of Ber-Pru and Sil-War (cutting support from
either against either). I've probably sent a mixed signal and also prevented
him from retreating back across his borders. Maybe I should just go ahead and
take Warsaw next year. That should secure my East far better than it is now and
put me in position to challenge A or A/T coming North. </p>

<p> In the West there's no guessing involved.
Belgium will hold or it won't, my real target is the North Sea, gateway to all
things English. As long as Italy doesn't interfere I should have an army on the
English mainland this time next year and then grind Britain from the top on
downwards as I move towards the Med. Who would expect England to be invaded
from the top side, right? Well, a savvy dipper might, but England isn't all
that bright tactically or this situation would never have come to pass. </p>

<p> Italy might be a newbie but he's showing budding
promise as he progresses. Now his moves are depending a lot less on luck and
more on good supports coupled with correctly divining his opponents' intents.
He reads England's desire for peace correctly and responds by not taking
Portugal and instead moving for position on France. Had France's Gascony -&gt;
Brest move worked France would really have been in trouble, and myself as well
as Italy would get two units on an empty Burgundy. Gascony can thankfully
retreat to Burgundy now where I can support it to hold with Belgium, plugging
the gap. I hope France disbands his fleet and keeps his inland defense... the
fleet was an excellent distraction, but it's now served its purpose. I hope
I've been good enough to France that he won't screw me by keeping it and
leaving us open to Italy. </p>

<p> Italy's one boner this round is abandoning the
Ionian... he should have known moving there would have awakened Austria's
paranoia and mistrust, since a successful IA alliance almost always leads to a
midgame stab. If he was intending to stab he should have supported Turkey or
refused to move... if he's trying to make amends or show the move was a defense
against a Turkish sneak, why not still hold and support Austria, or retreat
<u>away</u> from rather than toward Austria's rear? Now he's got a peevish Austria
in reach of two of his SC's... Italy's new build can cover Naples, but he'll
have to use WMed to cover Tunis or risk losing it.  </p>

<p> He's also all but assured that Austria will
build in Trieste, further aggravating the situation. Not that I particularly
mind... an AI war at this point could be what saves my exposed rear. </p>

<p> I think Russia overreacted a bit to the army
moving into St. Petersburg, but I'm not complaining. He could have bounced it a
long time using A Sev, instead he tried the futile recapture of Rumania. I said
before Austria's moves were silly in that Rumania was almost certain to be
attacked, but actually the smart thing for Russia to do is not waste half a
year doing that. Austria expected Russia to do the smart thing, and was once
again disappointed. </p>

into disarray as both Turkey and Austria scramble to protect themselves. Again,
too bad Italy abandoned the Ionian this turn or it actually would have been a
great move to keep his rear secure by preventing Austria from freely assaulting
the Turk. Especially if he just held it there, one unit would keep AT guessing
and fighting while he tried to progress in the West. </p>

<p> I'm confident enough by now of the Englishman's
character that I'm almost sure I'll be able to outguess his defenses. He's
shown himself to be very protective of his SC's even when it could cost him the
tactical advantage to do so. That would go doubly so in a Fall turn, which is
of course what the next turn will be. I predict NAO -&gt; Liverpool to
recapture it from the French, Yorkshire -&gt; Edinburgh, probably hoping to
bounce with F Norwegian, and either London or the Channel attacking North to
cut support for Nwg-Edi. If Brest falls Liverpool will compensate. Of course,
even if he keeps Brest he won't have any place to build! </p>

<p> Good man. He leaves Burgundy in place and
attacks with Paris, knowing England can't get anywhere on his backside. Of course,
it's a good thing his attack doesn't succeed, or Italy could have retreated to
Brest! The sticking point is that once England takes Liverpool, France will be
down to one unit, and I very much doubt he'd keep Burgundy in favor of Paris.
Thank goodness I'll be capturing Warsaw and building this turn! </p>

<p> So I switch my Eastern policy and decide to try
and finish off Russia after all. I need the security in the East, and more than
that I need the builds to cover my Western and central inland spaces. With
France fading fast it seems to have been a sound choice, since I never intended
to pick up a build from England this year. If he moves as predicted my convoy
will panic him, but whether I'll be able to take a center even next year is
debatable. Attacking England depends on position, not grabbing SC's... and most
importantly involves getting an army onto his Isles. Preferably two armies.
We'll see what happens. </p>

<tt>Army Venice HOLD. </tt><br>

<p> <i>Whew.</i> Army Venice doesn't go to Tyrolia. Neither
does it attack Austria, but that huge fleet turnaround has to be making the
Sultan and the Archduke nervous. All pretty good news for me... unless he turns
around again Italy is going to lose his chance at breaking out of the Med to
challenge me.  Italy's probably gambling
on England being able to slow me down, and thus not wanting to handicap him by
taking Portugal. Maybe he also still intends Ven -&gt; Tyrolia, but this time
I'll have a newly built army in Munich to greet it before he can do anything. </p>

<p> Looks like the Tsar got very nervous about StP
-&gt; Lvn. I don't know why, since it slows down my assault on England and gets
me no advantage I can't get from StP (cutting Moscow's support for a hold in
Warsaw). Russia's options are severely deteriorating though, as Sevastopol is
doomed to beat its head ineffectually against Rumania unless a big shake-up
occurs. Italy's move might foreshadow such a shake-up though, who knows? </p>

<p> The Turk is forced back, but using the momentary
respite in Smyrna to reposition his forces is as brilliant as you can get in
his position. The fleet is back in the Black (no AC/DC jokes, please), and if
Sevastopol continues to attack Rumania 
while the retreated fleet attacks the Aegean, Bulgaria can be saved. Of
course, if Italy slips in to add his two cents, Turkey is toast. If the Turk is
really devious he could actually retreat from Bulgaria and let Austria take it,
then disband his outside fleet... it would put a dangerously large Austria
between him and Italy that Italy would need to seriously consider putting the
dagger to. Once IA start fighting, Turkey would be saved and might even be able
to recover lost ground. </p>

Silesia is free to defend Munich. </p>

<p> My biggest fear at this point is that Austria

<p> I figured I had to cover Munich even against the
infinitesimal possibility that IA could not only get their act together but
coordinate an attack. Munich is just too important, even if it meant giving up
Burgundy. Convoying another army off the continent looks insane, but by now I
had such a feel for England it was like having a copy of his orders before the
turn progressed. I saw my opportunity to take Edinburgh and destroy the fleet
there, which could only have been stopped by Lon -&gt; Yor ... and I knew there
was no way England would move London in a fall turn! I have a much needed build
which I'll use to raise an army in Kiel and plug Ruhr while I convoy the army
back to Belgium. If the Italian bounces either move, I'll just have the
successful one support the other in, and then Italy's land assault won't have

the homicidal, suicidal, genocidal power of a truly horked off but not yet
critically weakened Austria. </p>

<p> For you non-Americans, yes, &quot;horked
off&quot; would be akin to &quot;deeply upset.&quot; </p>

<p><b> ENGLAND </b></p>

<p> <tt>Build waived.</tt></p>

<p> Admittedly I was hoping England would move to
Liverpool to cover against Yor -&gt; Lvp, but Nwg -&gt; Cly was just to cut any
support for Edinburgh... I never dreamed England would once again screw himself
out of his build <u>and</u> let me into Clyde behind him! Oh he is sooooo over... </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt>Builds an army in Kiel. </tt><br>

<p> I 'splained this already. </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<p> Eh. It will lessen the sting of Tyrolia -&gt; Piedmont,
but I doubt Italy is even considering that possibility. He's building in order
to keep going on either his West or East fronts, not realizing yet he's doomed
to failure on both. </p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>

<p> Here comes the lucky winner of the new I-A war!
Italy ironically even helped him get rolling! </p>

<tt>Army Budapest SUPPORT Army Serbia -&gt; Trieste.</tt><br>

<tt>Army Tyrolia -&gt; Piedmont. </tt><br>

<p> Austria of course goes through with the Piedmont
move, and also retakes Trieste with authority. Maybe he's trying to take Italy
down fast enough to possibly get builds back in time to hold off Turkey? I
rather think though that at this point Austria's so frustrated he just wants to
hurt Italy badly. He made his try at forging an alliance to stop me and the one
person he needed most not only ignored him but attacked. </p>

<p><b> ENGLAND </b></p>

<tt>Fleet Brest HOLD.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet London -&gt; English Channel.</tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Liverpool -&gt; Wales. </tt><br>

<p> England is now in full retreat, not even
bothering to make me dislodge him. I'm not leaving any holes for him to
exploit, but there's the chance I could have. I take both his remaining home
centers and he'll have no chance of getting them back before having to disband
something. He can fool around all he wants now, he'll never again have a build
he can use. </p>

<p><b> FRANCE </b></p>

<tt>Army Paris -&gt; Brest.  (*bounce*) </tt><br>

<p> England <u>still</u> refuses to leave Brest! Boy, I
have to hand it to the French. One army has kept an English fleet rotting in
its harbor for years while it could have been off providing much needed
defensive support. Especially during the time England had the spare supply
space, in my opinion leaving it there was a bad move. Brest was expendable
compared to keeping me from overrunning the Home Isles. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt>Army Munich -&gt; Burgundy.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army Kiel -&gt; Ruhr. </tt><br>

<p> It's not like England could have stopped me at
this point, but he could've held in Liverpool and retreated to the Irish Sea,
which would have slowed me down at least a bit. He might even have kept one or the
other if I'd convoyed an army back to Belgium. Ah well... it's kind of cool to
have the feeling of sending an entire nation into rout. I took a big chance by
leaving Belgium open, but I figured after all this time trying to get two units
on Paris, Italy couldn't help but try to grab for it. That, and my forecast of
Tyr-Pie led me to take the risk-- and it paid off nicely. </p>

<tt>Army Rome SUPPORT Army Trieste -&gt; Venice. </tt><br>

<p> Italy, Italy, Italy... you didn't really think I
was gonna let you beat up on the Frenchman that easy, did you? And now Tyr-Pie
has you in a real bind. Hmm-- let's see if your obsession with destroying the
French is as bad as I think it is. If you're really focused you'll get him! But
I'll get into Burgundy, and Austria is probably going to also read you and make
a jump for Marseilles. The perils of making an enemy of someone that doesn't
have much to lose, neh? </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>

<tt>Army Moscow -&gt; Warsaw.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army Sevastopol -&gt; Moscow.  (*bounce*) </tt><br>

<p> Oh boy... my foes are getting far too
predictable these days. The Bear snorts and wakes up, and goes for Warsaw half
a year too late. He doesn't take advantage of an almost assured re-entry into
Rumania (Austria all but telegraphed his anti-Italian rush last turn), and
seals Moscow's doom by allowing me to sneak into Ukraine. It won't fall this
turn, but next year it's a goner. </p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>

<tt> Fleet Greece SUPPORT Army Constantinople -&gt;
Bulgaria. </tt><br>

<tt>Fleet Smyrna -&gt; Aegean Sea.  </tt><br>

<p> Hmm. Perhaps there's method to Austria's
madness. Turkey only has one army, and Austria's disbands ceded all his coastal
territories on the Turk front. If Austria can keep the Turk from Rumania and
Serbia and hang onto Trieste, perhaps also grabbing Marseilles... he might yet
have some hope of survival. On the other hand, a perceptive Turk will recognize
that and go on all out attack. </p>

<p> 

<h2> Retreat orders for Spring of

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt> Army 
Trieste -&gt; Tyrolia. </tt><br>

<p> Oops. My analysis forgot all about this! Austria
really can't cover all his bases effectively this turn, but his best bet is
probably to order Vienna to support Trieste and cover Serbia with Budapest
while making a try for Marseilles. Rumania's a lost cause, I can't see the Turk
<u>not</u> supporting himself in one way or the other-- and neither move can be
stopped. </p>

<tt>Army Budapest -&gt; Rumania.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt>Army Piedmont -&gt; Marseilles. </tt><br>

<p> Ow, ow, ow. Budapest wastes itself on a futile
Rumanian defense and nothing supports Trieste. Position is all well and good,
but not if you castrate yourself doing it! I guess Austria is going for the
murder/suicide strategy after all, but if so why not hold Trieste <u>and</u> take
Marseilles? The only way these moves do any good is if Italy attacks from
Venice rather than Tyrolia, but there's no reason for him to do that. And
Budapest -&gt; Rumania while leaving Serbia open is just inexplicable.  </p>

<p> Not that it truly matters to me, I guess.
Austria's capture of Marseilles prevents Italy from building, and I don't see
much chance that the Turk is going to win the race to 18 against me at this
point. If they can finish off Austria quickly I-T might be able to force a
draw, but Austria's doing his peevish darnedest to see that if he can't win or
be part of the draw he's gonna make sure all his tormentors lose. After all,
except for the one move to Galicia I've been nothing but friendly to him this
whole game. </p>

<p> Sorry England, you're not getting away that
easy! What shall you be removing, hmm? I'm guessing fleet Wales... I suppose at
least you tried to move Brest this turn, but I owed it to France to make you
pay for trying to cover it with Eng instead of supporting to MAO. Besides, I
can't have you getting back to Portugal and digging in. </p>

<p><b> FRANCE </b></p>

<tt>Army Paris -&gt; Brest.  (*bounce, dislodged*) </tt><br>

<p> Italy's obsessed assault finally succeeds in
eliminating the stalwart French, but France can go out knowing he's cost both England
and Italy dearly. There's no way I'm going to go to a draw with Italy involved
at this point... if he doesn't eat a loss out of this he might not learn from
his mistakes. <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif> </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt>Army Ruhr -&gt; Burgundy. </tt><br>

<p> I have to pause for a bit while I complete the
annexation of England, so I use the idle fleets to let Austria know I'm
appreciating his efforts. Hopefully he won't get too gushy and think I'm
actually going to support him into Rumania next turn. Moscow's the target...
then again, putting a scare into the Turk doesn't hurt. </p>

<p> Italy lets me walk into Burgundy just as my army
is freed up to convoy back from the Isles. Actually I set it up so that the
only move that saved Burgundy would be Gascony supporting it to hold in
place... which of course would have saved France and let Austria into
Marseilles. The only thing Italy managed to accomplish was to put France out of
the picture, but it was at a pretty dismal cost to his own position. Soon I'll
have two more armies to play with along with a quite nice looking position for
the endgame. </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<p> Maybe Austria was expecting me to support him
into Rumania (even though I only signaled the hope of that this turn, not the
previous one)? That would explain his move, and it would have been better than
the near surefire bounce of moving there myself that I did. I guess I'm being
hypocritical to have criticized Austria for a useless move. <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif> Anyhow, the
Turk manages to handicap himself by ordering a useless support for Greece (IA
cooperating now? Without any pre-arrangements? Pshaw!)... a much better move
for him would have been F Bla S A Bul -&gt; Rum, F Aeg -&gt; Bul(sc). I guess
he wanted to keep his fleets in a forward position, but he would have been
better off trying to come to Moscow's rescue. </p>

<tt>Removes the army in Tyrolia. </tt><br>

<p> Well, that's interesting. I'm curious to see
what he'll try to do this turn... perhaps another run at Trieste? He's left
Venice snug and safe. </p>

<p><b> ENGLAND </b></p>

<tt>Removes the fleet in Wales. </tt><br>

<p> Yeesh. Come on, England... do something I don't
see coming! Once again he doesn't factor the delaying value of leaving a
forward unit intact. Yeah, it's only a half-year delay at best, but he could at
least try something other than unconditional flight. I must have him totally
demoralized. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>

<tt>Builds a fleet in Smyrna. </tt><br>

<p> Okay, looks like Turkey is going to try and

regret it. </p>

<tt>Army Marseilles HOLD. </tt><br>

<p> Austria takes back Trieste once again, without
really caring that the Italian might have a retreat to Serbia. Maybe he hoped
the Turk would grab it, but the Sultan has other things on his mind. The army
in Marseilles taunts the Italian with a hold order... also apparently declaring
its neutrality in the GI conflict. </p>

<tt>Fleet English Channel -&gt; Mid-Atlantic Ocean.</tt><br>

Picardy. </tt><br>

<tt>Army Kiel -&gt; Munich.</tt><br>

<tt>Army Berlin -&gt; Silesia. </tt><br>

<p> My naval sweep is being deliberately slow to
prevent England from even having the option of an eleventh hour retreat behind
my lines. On land things are different and I'm looking to breach as many points
of the stalemate line as possible while everyone's still occupied with Austria.
Moscow falls, but not as easily as I'd hoped. </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt>Army Tuscany -&gt; Venice. </tt><br>

<p> Paris supports Gascony, which strikes me as an
odd move since Austria and I successfully coordinating an assault against it
was unlikely. He should've supported Brest, also unnecessary but at least it would
have reaffirmed his alliance with the English. </p>

<p> The rest of his moves are almost meaningless at
this point, although he's trying to signal Turkey for an Austrian partition.
Again, the Turk has better things to do. </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>



<tt>Army Moscow -&gt; Ukraine.</tt><br>

<tt> Army Sevastopol SUPPORT Army Moscow -&gt;
Ukraine.  </tt><br>

<p> Oops! Looks like the bear still had fight in
him! I should have attacked from St. Pete's, but I was worried about Moscow
dislodging to retreat to Livonia, which would have provoked an unpleasant
guessing game come Fall.  </p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>

<tt>Fleet Smyrna -&gt; Aegean Sea.  </tt><br>

<p> At the same time Russia makes his move, the Turk
shows quite clearly that he's going to try to stop me with or without the
others' help! Brushing aside Italy's fleet, he gets into the Ionian while
simultaneously ignoring the Austrian front in order to advance his armies and
put his fleet in position for uncuttable support for Russia in Sevastopol. I
can't imagine he'll do so much as glance in Austria's direction in Fall... he
knows where the true threat lies. Will Italy get the hint and disband his
Trieste army rather than retreating it to Serbia? If everyone starts
cooperating now they actually still have an excellent chance of stopping me
cold. </p>

<p> 

<h2> Retreat orders for Spring of

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<p> I had my choice of retreating to Warsaw or
Galicia... with my army in Silesia to cover Warsaw, Galicia is the far better
choice. It looks like I may end up having to grab centers from Austria. Sorry
pal, nothing personal. Of course, if Italy disbands to show his recognition of
my threat and keep Austria healthy I'm sure Austria won't be averse towards
supporting a Grand Alliance for a draw. </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt> Army 
Trieste -&gt; Serbia. </tt><br>

<p> Forget Austria and forget France, I have to say
Italy by far is my best ally in this game. Even as the Hun hordes breathe down his
neck, he continues the assault against a nation that could have supported him.
True, Austria's moves up until now showed despairing suicide, but as soon as
the Turk turned aside I would have noted that and gambled on Austria wanting to
be part of a draw as long as he had hope he could be. Turkey reawakened that
hope, and all Italy had to do was foster it... but nope, he takes the
&quot;clever&quot; retreat to Serbia and probably again doesn't see the harm
that causes. Does he realize yet that his stab of Austria was a mistake? </p>

nothing and their best option becomes only to make sure everyone else loses as

off! He might have been better off trying to do something with his armies, but
taking Sevastopol could have failed and pissed off Russia and I left precious
little room for him to maneuver against me. Besides that, Turkey has every
right not to trust Italy to act for the greater good... better to shove Italy
out of the way and do the stalemate legwork himself. Rumania's support is to at
least try to signal Italy that taking Tunis is an unfortunate side effect of
the need for speed, but it's just a formality with IA embroiled as they are. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<tt>Builds an army in Munich. </tt><br>

<tt>Builds an army in Berlin.  </tt><br>

<p> I've got more than enough fleets already,
especially with the Med about to be locked down. My plan is simple, but
unfortunately far from a sure thing. I left Vienna and Brest intact while I
pushed to forward positions, and also moved to compromise Marseilles. It's
worked like a charm up until now... I'm currently at 15 SC's to Turkey's 7 and
Italy's 6, and if I can just grab all three of the designated targets this
coming year I win!  </p>

<p> The Turk can lock me out of the Med, but he
can't help Marseilles in time. And then I also saw Rome. If Turkey truly wants
to lock down the Med he'll move Tun-WMed and Ion-Tun. The move I have planned
will cause Gascony's fall no matter if Piedmont cuts support or not, so I might
as well try for an even deeper penetration into the Italian peninsula-- I could
get my attack on Marseilles <b>and</b>
three units for an attack on Venice as well! </p>

<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt>Removes the fleet in Albania. </tt><br>

<p> Well, color me impressed. Italy seems to have
read Turkey's moves correctly. Now... can they stop me in time? </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>

<tt>Removes the army in Ukraine. </tt><br>

<p> His final unit digs in in Sevastopol, where the
Turk can no longer risk an attack and will have to give him support to hold. If
things go to a draw he and England have at least assured themselves a part in
it. Bleah. </p>

<p><b> TURKEY </b></p>

<tt>Builds a fleet in Smyrna. </tt><br>

<p> Hmm, why the fourth fleet? I suppose to support
WMed if I get into North Africa, but couldn't a fleet in Tunis do that? Maybe
he's (justifiably) worried about Italy not being able to help hold the line. </p>

<p> Whoa. Suddenly England decides not to just lie
down and die peacefully. I figured if anything he'd try to retake MAO and not
bother with Picardy since I could easily convoy army Wales to Belgium. Now
though I may have outsmarted myself by convoying Wales down to Gascony. This
provokes an actual guessing game for Fall, blech. </p>

<p><b> GERMANY </b></p>

<p> Double blech. I got too fancy down South as well
and Italy has split my peninsular expedition in twain. I can't possibly free up
a unit to defend Belgium without weakening my attacks on Brest and Marseilles.
On the plus side, at least I successfully surrounded Vienna... but if Austria moves
to defend with Italy and/or Turkey cutting my supports it could fail easily. I
hate all the bounces that occurred... Italy really surprised me by finally
covering for Piedmont. </p>

<tt>Army Serbia -&gt; Trieste.  (*bounce*)</tt><br>

<tt> Army Venice SUPPORT Army Marseilles -&gt;

<p> Damn good moves, especially managing to coordinate
with England. He might have been better off simply moving to bounce me from
Piedmont rather than dislodge, but he had no idea I'd be moving rather than
supporting to hold, I suppose. What's with the attack on Trieste? I guess he
finds it impossible to believe that Austria might still forgive and forget, but
it's preventing any chance of Austria moving to stop me from taking Vienna. </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>



<tt> Army Sevastopol SUPPORT Turkish Army Rumania

<p> Props to Russia for hanging in there! (TRANSLATION:

one unit. What a worthy gentleman he is...) </p>

<p> The move Russia supported would have been a good
one for the Turk to have tried for... supporting Sevastopol to hold really
wasn't necessary this phase. Ah well, he's got me safely stymied in the East.
He also made some allowance for my move to Rome just in case Italy didn't have
it covered. A move to Ukraine might have slowed me down some, but other than
that these are all solid choices. </p>

<p> 

<h2> Retreat orders for Spring of
1910.  </h2>



<p><b> ITALY </b></p>

<tt> Army 
Gascony -&gt; Marseilles.  </tt><br>

<p> Okay, everything's in place for Fall. The Turk's
move to the Tyrhennian pretty much ends the hope of grabbing for Rome, but
that's all right. Let's look at my planned targets: </p>

<p><b> Marseilles:
</b> I'll use Tuscany to attack Piedmont and cut support, use MAO
to attack Spain(sc) and cut support, and attack with Burgundy supported by Gascony.
Marseilles falls and there's nothing anyone can do about it, and if MAO or
Tuscany get dislodged and/or destroyed so be it. They will have sacrificed
nobly for the cause. </p>

<p><b> Brest:
</b> Paris attacks, supported by F Eng. Once again an assured
capture. </p>

<p><b> Vienna:
</b> The most uncertain of all of them. This one is going to be a
real judgment call and I'll have to correctly divine what people are going to
do in the coming turn, based on their recent play and the history of the game.
So let's see.  </p>

<p> - <b>Austria</b>
I expect will continue the holding pattern. Italy has shown no signs of wanting
to bury the hatchet and keeps plinking at Trieste... nor has the Turk shown
support for anyone except Italy and Russia. Austria was dragged down by the
jackals surrounding him-- I fault him nothing for just looking to himself at
this point and leaving them to fend for themselves against me. Just in case
though, I'll order a support. Because I can. </p>

<p> - <b>Italy</b>
is a wildcard. He might try to protect Marseilles and Rome, or might not. Would
he move to Tyrolia? Unlikely, but he caught me by surprise this last turn. He
might even try to support himself in, if he recognizes that Marseilles is
doomed.  </p>

<p> - <b>Turkey</b>
played more cautiously than he needed to last turn. Now any move of the army in
Rumania sets that province at risk during a crucial Fall turn. Is it also
possible he thinks Sil -&gt; Boh last turn was just to shore up my frontlines,
and that I'm somehow too sensitive to attack my buddy Austria? Naaah. It
doesn't matter though, I have this gut hunch he's not going to move Rum -&gt;
Gal, for whatever insane reason. Maybe the English move to Picardy makes him
complacent that I'll either lose Belgium or not be able to get one of my
targeted centers this year? I'll order the attack from Tyrolia, with Munich
following up. </p>

<p> &quot;And what <u>about</u> Belgium?&quot;, you may
ask. Well, it was inconvenient that the English fleet slipped through the
cracks of my otherwise impenetrable German advance, but after careful
consideration I can only reply, &quot;What about it?&quot; Even if I lose
Belgium I'll get at least one new build this year, and possibly more if Tuscany
or MAO get destroyed. Between that and my units behind the front I'm pretty
sure I can hunt him down eventually, or at least sweep up after him and make
sure he stays at one SC while I press on in the South. It may end up getting me
stalemated, but so would derailing everything to defend against him! I have the
chance to WIN, right NOW, as long as I stiffen my sinews and let the English
gnat do as he will. I began this game with ballsy moves... let's see if I can
end it with one. </p>

<p> That resolved, I have a long draught of bier,
and enter my orders. Vorwarts, mein herrs! Fr das Vaterland! </p>

hadn't even really thought about taking Venice. Oh, and in an act showing he
still really doesn't get it even at the end, he once again propositions Turkey
to take down Austria. </p>

<p><b> RUSSIA </b></p>

<p> What, no support to the Ukraine this time? Ah

<p> He slides into Rome and does the right thing by supporting

side, he sits as still as my hunch predicted, and still won't lend Austria any
show of friendship. </p>

<tt>Army Berlin -&gt; Silesia. </tt><br>

<p> Game, set, match. England's failure to follow
through on Belgium combines with my success in capturing all three targeted
centers to end this little bit of history. I even managed to set up more
failsafes at the last minute. F NAO -&gt; MAO supported by F Iri ensures that F
MAO can move to cut Spain(sc)'s support and still be safe from a supported Por
-&gt; MAO, Spa(sc) S Por -&gt; MAO counterattack, due to the &quot;beleaguered
garrison&quot; clause. Galicia -&gt; Budapest instead of Gal S Tyr -&gt; Vie
ensures that even if Turkey moves Rum -&gt; Gal it won't have any effect. Plus
it guards against an eleventh hour defense from Austria by causing support for
Tri -&gt; Vie to be cut (I expected that the Italians would still bang their
heads against Trieste and thus inadvertantly cut any support for Bud -&gt;
Vie). </p>

<p> As it turns out I needn't have gotten so
complicated, as all my opponents stood stock still in their positions and
England chickened out from Belgium. The only move that could have saved the day
besides that would have been Austria doing A Tri S A Bud -&gt; Vie, but he had
no idea Italy might finally stop attacking. Even then, Italy's alternate move
with his army was to signal for a Turkish attack on Austria! </p>

<p> Austria could have been a great ally for IT as
they fought for a draw, but neither country ever expressed more than neutrality
towards the Archduke despite Austria's obvious pleas. As a result they lose--
and they deserve to. </p>

<h2> EPILOGUE </h2>

<p> Congratulations if you made it this far...
you've shown yourself to either be a true student of The Game, or someone with
far too much time on their hands. Or likely both, but who am I to talk? I wrote
the thing! </p>

<p> In analysis, I would say I had a rather easy
time of things in chaos2, and a good bit of luck to accompany my strategic planning.
England can be forgiven his early concentrations on France and trust in me, but
to abandon the North Sea just as I was taking Russia out of the Scandinavian /
St. Petersburg picture was a foolish move I wouldn't expect to be repeated
regularly in games. Italy stabbed Austria right at the time when a coalition
should have been forming to stop me. My enemies seemed constantly at odds with
each other, and I never had to face down skilled, determined opposition or
united fronts.  </p>

<p> Does this invalidate the premise of the
Centrifuge being a viable opening? Not in my opinion, or I would never have
published the article. Several of the predictions involved in the strategy bore
true in the opening of the game. The opening move to Prussia indirectly sabotaged
Russia's efforts towards Austria, allowing the strong Austrian player to take
advantage and keep RT off-balance. Munich was safe from the Burgundy army,
which preferred the move to Belgium. Western neutrality by Germany led to an EF
war that secured the border better than any number of the Kaiser's armies.
Grabbing Germany's traditional neutrals kept the 'vultures' from the gates. And
of course the big one... despite moving armies Northward, Russia swallowed
whole the 1901 fake-out, to the point of an abortive attack on England. </p>

<p> Lacking the EOG's of the other countries
involved, I cannot say for sure what their own viewpoints and motivations were,
and thus the 'big picture' is incomplete. 
And somewhere along the line I lost the game summary which listed their
names and email addresses, so unless they contact me as Russia did we shall,
alas, remain in the dark. </p>

<p> There is one big advantage to the delay in this
follow-up's publishing, which is that there has been some time for the opening
to disseminate into the Diplomacy community at large.  Feedback to me personally has been scarce, but here's some
personal encounters so far. </p>

<p><b> Diplomacy World E-mail Masters Championships
'99:   </b></p>

<p> I put my money where my mouth was and risked a
Centrifuge opening for my game in this tournament (M9947).  The diplomatic situation seemed to favor
it, even though there was almost no chance it would go unnoticed.  First of all, I was dealing with a press
game.  Second of all, metagaming was
fully legal by tournament rules. 
Members of a team were allowed and encouraged to advise one another, and
beyond that it was possible for any of the hundreds on the chat board for the
tournament to view and comment on games in progress.  The possibility of keeping intents a surprise regressed towards
infinitely small.  But still, why not
take the risk?  Did I not crow about the
flexibility the opening provided?  Why
not at least start with it, and then carry through or switch tacks as the
situation dictated?  In short, did I
have the cojones to attempt to prove the validity of the Centrifuge option, in
not only a press game, but in what was possibly the most nightmarish
environment for trying to pull it off! </p>

<p> To my glee, two other Germany players in the
tourney also went forward with their own attempts.  My advantage was being on a board relatively overlooked because
it had no 'big hitters' as far as the community was concerned.  The Germany in M9935 was not so lucky, his
board was being watched like a hawk and people actually posted to the general
chats wondering why on Earth he had made such a brain-dead 'surefire loser'
move in 1901.  Others chimed in with
none of them recognizing what was going on-- I must say, I was surprised to see
how many people actually don't read the Pouch. 
Maybe I had a chance after all! </p>

<p> Alas, someone finally did post that they vaguely
remembered something called a 'Centrifuge' which the opening might be linked
to.  I couldn't resist, I posted a reply
<u>as myself</u> to that innocently asking 'Centrifuge?  I don't understand, what is this Centrifuge you speak of?'  To my amusement, the poster replied back
with an explanation for me that somewhere he'd read about it, and proceeded to
explain the basics as he remembered them. 
Nobody gets me-- </p>

<p> Anyhow, I regret to say that my two brave
compatriots were shut down in a hurry. 
In M9935 Italy (whose team did their homework a bit better than the chat
board fellow above) sent a link for my article to England, which England used
to his full advantage.  Of course, they
both ended up eliminated or almost so in the end, but they clearly demonstrated
my forecast of 'whistle blowing' making a press Centrifuge very difficult. </p>

<p> In my own game I know Austria was aware of what
I was doing (he was part of the same team as M9935's Italy), but if others knew
they never mentioned it or really played for it.  Russia might have been tipped off, since he provided an
interesting study of moves that can short-circuit the strategy.  One is moving an army in Warsaw or Galicia
to Silesia, which threatens Munich and Berlin and thus severely limits German
mobility.  Another is building F StP(sc)
at the end of 1901, which can combine with his other Northern fleet to stymie
any thoughts of the push up through Bothnia. 
A caveat to Russian players however: 
both of these defenses came at the expense of letting Austria in to
rampage through the Russian homelands, which led to Russia's eventual
elimination.  Russia in M9947 chose not
to care, but those of you interested in coaxing a six center 1902 Russia to
something other than a swift demise might wish to find a middle ground.  </p>

<p> Anyhow, after 1901 I had to abandon the
strategy, but I am happy to report that it is not a 'surefire' loser.  I ended up in an alliance with England that
performed very strongly, and was up to 9 centers before an English stab undid
my chances.  I must say that famous or
not, England and Austria were two of the toughest opponents I have ever
faced.  But I digress-- the end result
seems to be that the Centrifuge is extremely risky in a Press game.  Attempt it at your own risk, be prepared to
abandon it at a moment's notice, and above all don't do it if you don't feel
diplomatically confident enough to defend your borders with words alone--
something I found myself required to do more than once. </p>

<p><b> Game 'molten' on USEF </b></p>

<p> Molten was a nopress gunboat game where I tried
out another pet idea of mine, making an early surprise attack on France as
Italy.  This sort of opening is already
listed as a 'Western Lepanto', but I didn't discover that until later on.   </p>

<p> Imagine my surprise to see some very familiar
opening moves from the German player! 
Then I got a message quite innocently sent to me from that player
confirming that he was trying out my opening in 'molten' and would keep me
updated on the results if I liked. </p>

<p> It was completely accidental, but of course this
sort of contact is forbidden.  Telling
him as little about my involvement as possible specifically, I informed him
that I was also playing in the game (not specifically which country except to say
it didn't directly involve him) and we should cease any discussions until it
was completed.   </p>

<p> That was the end of things and the German player
and I never spoke again.  Technically I
suppose we might have contacted the master right then and advise that the game
be terminated, but it was Spring 1901 and as long as no more contact was made I
didn't have a problem.  Neither did the
German, and so we carried on and I watched his progress with interest as I made
my own planned assault against France. </p>

<p> To my slight delight, but mostly my dire
embarrassment, this game ended in a solo for the German player at my direct
expense.  I would love to claim I threw
the game to him for self-aggrandizement of my opening (despite the censure such
would no doubt bring), but it's not true. 
I was just a moron who misconstructed what I had thought to be an
unbreachable stalemate line, and ate a loss as a result of that
incompetence.  Like some Diplomatic
Doctor Frankenstein, I gaped, stupefied as I was destroyed by my own creation. </p>

<p><b> The Final Thoughts </b></p>

<p> As stated before, personal feedback to me on
results has been scarce.  Right now it
would seem that a pure Centrifuge is a likely stillbirth in press games (though
it does not necessarily entail destruction). 
Conversely, in nopress games it has now led twice to German
victories.  I encourage anyone who has
finished a game where they played or witnessed a Centrifuge opening to contact
me with the results, since the above analysis is based on about five games--
hardly a good sized sample.  But for
now, gentle and not-so-gentle readers, I will bring this article to a close
before it eats up every last bit of space available on the DipPouch
server.  Even Germany has to stop
expanding sometime. </p>
