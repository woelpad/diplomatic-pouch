<p>In June 2012 the DEUS GM, Dietmar Kulsch, passed away. Let&#8217;s have a look at the things he did for the <b>Diplomacy</b> hobby and the current status of DEUS.</p>
<p>Dietmar told me that his first contact with <b>Diplomacy</b> was a
live game in the early 1980&#8217;s on TV &#8212; one of the German &#8220;3rd programs&#8221;
&#8212; non-commercial senders who had the chance to do very unusual
experimental things back then. The TV moderator kibitzed about the
player agreements and commented on the game for the observers. Well,
today we see so much nonsense on TV, so why not <b>Diplomacy</b>?</p>
<p><b>Diplomacy</b> wasn&#8217;t the only thing that&#8217;s necessary to say about
Dietmar. Another thing was his precise way to use the German language.
He always avoided foreign expressions &#8212; especially English ones. And,
more to say, he loved to intentionally misinterpret other people. If
someone e.g. would have asked: &#8220;Is the traffic light red or green?&#8221;, he
would have answered: &#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if, or how often, Dietmar played Face to Face in this
time, but around 1996 he found Ken Lowes judge. So he decided to
translate the judge. In early 1997, Judge DEAC started &#8212; the first and
only judge that did not respond in English. It was (and is up to this
day) possible to use the &#8220;set English&#8221; command to get an additional
translation of results into English, but its ordinary language was
German.</p>
<p>In 1999 there was one of the first <b>Diplomacy</b> conventions in
Germany &#8212; organized by DEAC players. There, the idea of a DEAC homepage
was born. It was the first of only two times I met Dietmar personally.
But it was the beginning of intensive and steadily correspondence for
many years. During the next months, about a half dozen people
brainstormed via mail about a homepage, and www.lepanto.de was born.
Most of the brainstormers disappeared then, but Dietmar and I did the
work &#8212; HTML by me, Scripting by Dietmar.</p>
<p>Lepanto didn&#8217;t describe PbEM only: soon it was possible to get games
information, too. DEAC became the second active judge worldwide. In
September 2002, there were more than 160 games concurrently. At this
time Dietmar started Judge DEUS, a copy of the DEAC software. In 2005
all old DEAC games were finished.</p>
<p>During the following years, we developed a judge Internet interface
step by step. First, there was a &#8220;gateway&#8221; &#8212; something like a mailing
form. Next came a form for press and broadcast, so the players need not
think about these commands any more. In 2005, I developed the DiploMap
software &#8212; interactive maps, a little bit like Realpolitik, but
integrated into lepanto. Now DEUS players were able to play via browser
also.</p>
<p>In 2012 we began a discussion about several new features. In June,
DEUS didn&#8217;t answer suddenly. Some few days later, lepanto.de was
offline, too. This was so unaccustomed, and Dietmar didn&#8217;t answer via
mail or phone, so I decided to google for Dietmar. What I found, was a
death announcement. Dietmar had passed away.</p>
<p>I informed the community as well as possible. Desisting from the
shock into the community, there was the question about the future of
DEUS. I wasn&#8217;t able to see any chance at first, but then Sascha Rei√üner
informed me that he had downloaded the DEUS sources weeks before. At
nearly the same time, Marcus Leber, a DEUS player, found an IP, where
the server still was online. Now we downloaded the complete server
data. Few days later, the old server was offline. In July, Sascha
restarted DEUS. The lepanto homepage was reborn as <b><a href="http://www.lepanto.at/">www.lepanto.at</a></b>, and the new DEUS address is <b><a href="mailto:DEUS@lepanto.at">DEUS@lepanto.at</a></b> now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, we modernized some things. Even in the old version, it
was possible to play from a site called &#8220;command central&#8221;. Now, this is
more clearly arranged, so a player has an easy overview of the map and
his correspondence within a single site. And it&#8217;s possible to create
orders and messages comfortably and easily there, without having to
know commands like &#8220;signon&#8221;, &#8220;press to&#8221; or &#8220;broadcast&#8221;. GMs can create
games via a separate form easily, too. We have some more plans to
modernize the play by judge hobby - support for more then 2 languages,
for example.. We hope this is in Dietmar's Spirit.</p>
