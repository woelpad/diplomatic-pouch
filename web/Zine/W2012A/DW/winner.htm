<blockquote><i><p>This article is reprinted from </i><a href="http://www.diplomacyworld.net/pdf/dw60.pdf">Diplomacy World #60</a><i>, the Fall 1990 issue of </i><u>Diplomacy World</u><i>. It provides an interesting statistical analysis of the performance of the Great Powers.</p></i></blockquote>
<center><i>
<p>"Any country can win in Diplomacy."</p>
<p>"All the Great Powers are basically equal,"</p>
</i></center>
<p>These are two of the basic premises of <b>Diplomacy</b>. I've
often wondered just how true they really were. Certainly
anyone can win, but does everyone win about the same
number of times? Are the countries equal; do all the countries
do about the same over time? I finally decided to test these
honored principles with a quantitative study &#8212; one that was
as broad as possible. So, using Everything supply center
charts, I gathered the information for my database.</p>
<p>300 games of Play-by-Mail <b>Diplomacy</b> played between
1982 and the present were included in the study. I felt that
such a number would eliminate varying player skills from
the variables that might affect the outcome. Also, only the
games considered "regular" and ending after 1905 (unless
some country won outright before then) were included. I
decided not to attempt to judge the reasonableness of the
draws, and counted them as recorded.</p>

<p>From this database, a lot of other things can be computed.
With the information from Table 1 we can answer the first
question: "Does every country win equally as much in PBM
<b>Diplomacy</b>?"</p>
<p>The answer is no. Every country does win, but Italy with
just 11 wins, a paltry 3.66% of all games played, does it half
as often as the rest of the board. The average country wins
over 21 times &#8212; approximately,7% of all games. And Russia
wins half again as much as anybody else with 33 wins; an astounding
11% of all games played!</p>
<p>A statistic that caught me off guard was the total number
of wins &#8212; almost 50% of all games ended with victory for
one of the Great Powers. I would have guessed that number
to be lower. It seems to me that there are an awful lot of draws
in Dipdom, but I can't argue with the numbers &#8212; counted
them twice!</p>
<p>Draws are also a type of victory, so I combined the total
number of draws and wins together in Table 3. The results
show that there are different groupings. Russia, France,
England and Turkey are at the top of the heap in combined
victories. Germany and Austria a step down the ladder. Poor
Italy is all alone at the bottom with a involvement in the win
only 1/6th of the time.</p>

<p>Clearly, Austria and Germany do not get as many centers
on average, or survive as long on average, as most of the
others. When compared on the centers per year chart, they do
better, which is perhaps to say that when they get eliminated,
usually it is swiftly. France seems to be very durable in this
study, surviving better (8.33 years) than any other nation.
Thus, the question is again answered with a no. Countries
fare very differently in the game of <b>Diplomacy</b>, and we need
to be aware of that. To illustrate this, an overview of the
statistics and what they mean for each country is in order.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><b>AUSTRIA-HUNGARY;</b> Low man on the totem pole in
5 of the 10 tables and 6th in 3 of the remaining five. Only in
wins, where Austria is average, and in 4 way draws is Austria
out of the cellar. Why this is probably has to do with the
position on the map. Many neighbors and densely packed
centers make Austria a tempting target. There are few
mediocre Austrian positions, you either do well or get
destroyed.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ENGLAND:</b> Average performance in 7 of the 10 tables.
England is involved in more draws than any other country,
probably because it is difficult to overcome when it has a lot
of fleets, but conversely has trouble winning those same
games. The difference between survival and victory is
probably dependent on getting the right ratio of armies and
fleets.</p></li>
<li><p><b>FRANCE:</b> France is either 1st or 2nd in seven of the 10
tables and is 3rd in the rest. France's position in the game is
strong in every respect, with good defensive and offensive
prospects on every front. Always a tough customer, France
has some inherent capabilities that can put it in or near the top
of the hill in most games.</p></li>
<li><p><b>GERMANY:</b> Germany is 6th in 4 of the 10 tables. In the
rest it ranks 4th or 5th. An average number of wins along with
a low number number of average years surviving shows that,
while Germany has potential, it must be realized early,
probably at the expense of one of its many neighbors. Only
Russia has a higher average number of centers in 1901.</p></li>
<li><p><b>ITALY:</b> Interestingly, Italy is average when it comes to
total centers and length of survival. It's number of wins and
draws are abysmal dead last. This is perhaps because Italy
has a hard time doing better than average as shown on Table
2. This suggests that while Italy does O.K. in the opening
stages of the game, it struggles to reach the 7 to 10 center
positions needed to have a good chance at wins or draws.</p></li>
<li><p><b>RUSSIA:</b> As Calhamer stated, <b>Diplomacy</b> is often very
much a win or die situation for Russia. First in wins by a mile,
Russia does only average in survival statistics and draws.
Russia's high count in average centers_on Tables 2 and 4
certainly have something to do with starting with four home
centers.</p></li>
<li><p><b>TURKEY:</b> Turkey has perhaps the most interesting
statistics in Table 2. Notice the abrupt rise in average number
of centers starting about 1906. This suggests that perhaps
one of the best strategies for Turkey is to lie low for the first
few years, watching world events and developments then
come out later with guns blazing. Turkey is another country
that does no worse than third in all 10 of the tables. This is
certainly due, in part at least, to its insular corner position.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>All of these numbers, averages and statistics are, overall,
probably little surprise to anyone. They mostly confirm what
<b>Diplomacy</b> players already have long known from experience.
I feel that the greatest impact these statistics might have
is upon ratings systems and tournament scoring. Here we
have hard evidence that all countries are not created equally
and perhaps such mundane things as ratings and tournaments
should take that into account for the sake of fairness.
Next time, I'm going to try the same thing for Gunboat—
unless my wife divorces me for spending too much time with
these "stupid game things." But isn't that a prerequisite (Rule
10) to becoming a member of the Senior Dip League? Ah, the
joys of Dipdom!</p>
