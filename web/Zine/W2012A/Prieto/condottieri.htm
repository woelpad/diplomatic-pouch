<p>In the vast and old empire of <b>Diplomacy</b>, maybe <b>Machiavelli</b>
is but a small city-state populated by people who like just a bit of
randomness, but open to newcomers that might get an unexpected success
against veteran generals, through a timely plague or a well placed
bribe. Through the years, probably almost all <b>Machiavelli</b> players have played <b>Diplomacy</b> too, but the Italian variant of our beloved game has never been so popular. It's not strange that, while there are many <b>Diplomacy</b> PBM judges, and some great sites to play online (like <b><a href="http://www.playdiplomacyonline.com/">http://www.playdiplomacyonline.com</a></b> or <b><a href="http://www.playdiplomacy.com/">http://www.playdiplomacy.com</a></b>), <b>Machiavelli</b> judges are unusual, and sites for online playing didn't even exist.</p>
<p>Two years ago, <a href="http://condottierigame.net/">Condottieri</a>
came to fill this gap, making it possible for nostalgic players to
enjoy this game again, and attracting new, inexperienced players.
Condottieri was born in Spain, as an amateur project. Surprisingly
enough, there are some dozens of <b>Machiavelli</b> players in Spain,
most of them busy adults who find it really difficult to gather some
friends for half a day to conquer Italy. So the site got a few players
in its first weeks of existence both from Spain and from other
countries. Since then, the community has grown to almost a hundred
active users, of whom more than half use it to play simultaneously.
This community is composed of veteran players, face to face players,
and others who have learnt to play on the website.</p>
<p>At first, Condottieri supported only the basic rules of <b>Machiavelli</b>
&#8212; the advanced and optional rules, along with some home rules, were
added over time. Most of the rules are optional, so any player can
create a game precisely as he likes it. Also every game may be created
with some custom parameters, like the turn length, the number of cities
required to win, whether the players are anonymous, or the kind of
press allowed. A user who wants to play only with his friends can
create a private game. Also, team games are a funny, different way of
playing. As for the home rules, maybe the more interesting ones are the
variable home country, taxation, or fog of war rules.</p>
<p>The site started with the official scenarios and then new ones were
added. Eventually, the site introduced a system that allows players to
design their own scenarios. The result is that there are now almost a
score of scenarios, a couple of them set in the Napoleonic Wars. But
not only new scenarios are supported. Some months ago a brand new
variant was designed, set in the Thirty Years War, with new countries
and new home rules, like trade routes or religion wars.</p>
<p>Condottieri has a "Hall of Fame" to show each player's achievements
and some statistics. Players get many points winning games, and some
points if they keep some cities when the game is finished. However,
these points are devaluated with time, so that new players have a
chance to be in the highest places of the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Also, a karma system measures the grade of commitment of each
player. A player who always sends his orders in time will have a high
karma, and more time to give his orders. By contrast, a player who uses
to be late will have a low karma, less time to give his orders, and a
poor reputation as a player. Even so, the biggest problem of this kind
of game is when a player leaves in the middle of a game. To somehow
relieve this problem, Condottieri introduced the concept of
"revolutions", that allows a third player to take the place of someone
who has not sent his orders in time. This way, when someone leaves, the
game is not totally broken.</p>
<p>As it couldn't be otherwise, the site has a forum where fellow
players ask or answer questions, and make suggestions to improve the
game. The good atmosphere among players made it possible to hold a
Christmas tournament last year (the winner got a boardgame as prize)
and, hopefully a new one will be organized this year.</p>
<p>It's worth to mention that Condottieri is open source software and its code is available on <a href="http://github.com/jantoniomartin">the Github site</a>.
The obvious advantage is that users can improve the game themselves, or
help to fix errors. As an amateur project, there are always errors to
fix, and things to improve. Not least, users can translate the
interface to their own language (currently English, Spanish, German and
Catalan are supported).</p>
<p>In summary, Condottieri is a nice, small site with a community of users that will delight any <b>Diplomacy</b> or <b>Machiavelli</b> player.</p>
