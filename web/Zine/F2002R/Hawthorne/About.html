<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Welcome to the 32nd issue of the Zine. Although I was a couple of weeks late getting this published, the Pouch staff is right on target to deliver its first, complete year's worth of issues since 1999.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While this issue is short [normal for a retreat phase], we have two new <A HREF="Deposits.html">challenges</A> and a nice group of articles, including contributions from two <I>new</I> authors -- <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Barnes/deMetaGaming.html">Nathan Barnes</A> and <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Woo/Mid-Endgame.html">Alexander Woo</A>.  Hardly Zine newbies, Mr. <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Clarke/Bh2o.html">Brandon Clarke</A>, <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Cohen/Maharajahs_Variant2.html">David Cohen</A>, and <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Powell/1900_France.html">Baron Powell</A> also pay a visit.  Take a look at what the Fall 2002 Retreat Issue has instore for you.

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As mentioned, Retreat Issues are notoriously short and to the point.  This issue touches on pervasive <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Barnes/deMetaGaming.html">meta-gaming</A> attitudes, <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Clarke/Bh2o.html">philosophy</A>, and <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Woo/Mid-Endgame.html">strategies</A> centred around FtF and <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Setzer/WMed.html">email</A> tournaments alike.  Speaking of tournaments, many players are going to wish they had read this issue <I>before</I> attending all the <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/Shields/Boxscore.html">mid-year tourneys</A>.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Incase you haven't noticed, many of the articles featured in the <A HREF="/Zine/F2002M">F2002M</A>, <A HREF="/Zine/F2002R/">F2002R</A> and <A HREF="/Zine/W2002A">W2002A</A> issues will provide crucial tips on how to win World Dip Con in <A HREF="/armada/2003/">Denver</A>.  I'll bet you Belgium other players are reading these articles and gearing up for the biggest contest of the year.  Plan to attend because you won't want to miss it.  Hope to see you there mates! &nbsp;<img src=/Zine/Common/smiley.gif>
