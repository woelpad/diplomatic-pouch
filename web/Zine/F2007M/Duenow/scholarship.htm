<H1>THE NATIONAL DIPLOMACY SCHOLARSHIP</H1>
<h2>by Greg Duenow</h2>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH=100% SIZE="-1" COLOR="GRAY">
</CENTER>
<p>I belong to a fraternal
(college) organization. We have setup an annual scholarship
foundation. Our size is approximately the same as the <b>Diplomacy</b>
hobby, if not smaller, (we have 102 members in our Yahoo group).
Since inception of the Scholarship in 2000 we have received $15,000
in donations and corporate matching funds.

<p>Heath Gardner (outgoing
Dip Pouch editor) and I were at DixieCon discussing ways to increase
the <b>Diplomacy</b> hobby ranks among high school and college students. I
mentioned the success of my fraternity's scholarship. We then bounced
the idea around of a National Diplomacy Scholarship. He suggested I
write an article for the Pouch to gauge interest. 

<p>At first I thought that a <b>Diplomacy</b> Scholarship would be kind of silly. It is a board game, after all! Scholarships are given to bright students or outstanding athletes, not conniving back-stabbers. 

<p>But then I remembered reading an article about a scholarship for <a href="http://www.finaid.org/scholarships/unusual.phtml">Duck Calling</a>, (you know, like Elmer Fudd). Who would give away money to people based on their ability to deceive birds? That thought pushed me over the edge to write this proposal. This game teaches more to it's students than duck calling. So I collected my thoughts, reviewed scholarship documentation and conferred with my fraternity brothers, setting in stone this flawless manifesto.
 <p>There are many things in a scholarship foundation's By-Laws that I am not touching because it's mainly legal jargon. All that can be fleshed out later. The following five categories are broken up into pertinent discussions we would need to have to get the scholarship setup.:<br><br>

<h2 id="criteria">1. Criteria</h2>
<p>The toughest question for a National Diplomacy Scholarship is what criteria determine the scholarship recipient. Our hobby is vast yet varied. It spans gamers sitting in high school cafeterias, old geezers sending snail mail, busy professionals writing vindictive emails and globe trotting face to face stalwarts.
<p>How do we include the most groups to garner the most interest in <b>Diplomacy</b>? Should there be separate awards for PBEM, FTF and snail mail? Should the system incorporate all three into some kind of bizarre trigonometric equation?
<p>First we must look at our own introduction to the hobby. The vast majority of us were hooked via face to face games. A buddy bought the game, got seven people together and you dived right in. You probably played voraciously for a couple of months before girls, cars and summertime broke up the group. Afterwards you tried to get a game together, sometimes successfully. Later you discovered postal or email play, it being much easier to get a game going that away.
<p>What binds us to <b>Diplomacy</b> is our youthful Face to Face beginnings. The scholarship's goal is to seek out more of these events. Therefore we must make the scholarship a catalyst for Face to Face games amongst youths.
<p>A Criteria system should focus on the following three items:
<ol type=n><li>It should be a system that rewards <b>Diplomacy</b> players who play and promote the game.
<li>It should have clear, simple rules.
<li>It should have checks to ensure fairness.
</ol>
<p>That being said, I've come up with three potential criteria for awarding the scholarship, with Pros and Cons:

<ol type="a"><li>Highest <a href="http://www.diplom.org/NADF/">Grand Prix</a> Rating
<table><tr><th>Pro<th>Con
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><ol type=n>
<li>Very easy to determine winner.</ol>
<td align="left"><ol type=n><li>Not newbie friendly
<li>Meta gaming issues
<li>Small pool of applicants
</ol></table>
<li>Most games of <b>Diplomacy</b> played this year
<table><tr><th>Pro<th>Con
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><ol type=n>
<li>Largest pool of applicants.</ol>
<td align="left"><ol type=n><li>What constitutes a game of <b>Diplomacy</b>?
<li>Do Postal/PBEM games count?
<li>How do we validate games(s) were legitimate?
</ol></table>
<li>Most games of <b>Diplomacy</b> hosted
<table><tr><th>Pro<th>Con
<tr><td align="left" valign="top"><ol type=n>
<li>Good mechanism for <br>recruitment into the Hobby</ol>
<td align="left"><ol type=n>
<li>High standard, hard to achieve

<li>Small pool of applicants
</ol></table>
</ol>

<h2 id="eligibility">2. Eligibility</h2>

<p>Who is eligible to apply for our scholarship?
<p>Here we must look at our potential audiences and determine from which will most readily form the vast army of future diplomats. Will college students who have a lot of free time and free reign over their domain be our best bet? Will they look at a scholarship for a board game as an awesome ironic feather in the cap? Or will they shy away from the stigma of the 2 liter Mt. Dew drinking gamer?
<p>Or perhaps high school students would be a better audience. Their pliable minds ready for indoctrination into the deceptive and intriguing nuances of <b>Diplomacy</b>. Potential paranoid parents may prove to be road blocks, so we will have to name drop, “Kennedy, Cronkite, Kissinger”. Thereby validating the credibility of this most noblest of games.
<p>To answer the eligibility question we must again look to the past. Where did we first get hooked? Personally for me it was in college. But I know many others who got the bug in high school. Our goal is to increase exposure. I propose the scholarship be for anyone under the age of 20. Young minds still discovering their interests. Pursuing their ideology. <b>Diplomacy</b> has the potential to make one better at debate, discourse and decisions. “Whil that iren is hoot, men sholden smyte”. Keen to learn, eager for guidance, young people will be best served by the skills learned in <b>Diplomacy</b>. And once they get the fire in their belly, they will spread their desire.


<p>Eligibility guidelines:

<ol type=a>
<li>Awardee shall be attending a high school or college, and have a GPA Of at least 2.0.
<li>Awardee shall be 20 years old or younger.
</ol>



<h2 id="bylaws">3. Ruling Body and Bylaws</h2>
<p>The Ruling Body, (hereafter referred to as the Board), should include people that have a vested interest in seeing the number of <b>Diplomacy</b> players increase. Unlike a fraternal organization, the <b>Diplomacy</b> hobby is very fluid. Having a static group of people as our voting members would be short-sighted. Many of our members come and go. Some <b>Diplomacy</b> players are very consistent in the hobby for decades. Some play sporadically for years. Others come to the game only for a short period of time. Our pool of members needs to reflect that. The By-Laws should also allow for the change of the voting pool in case of an unforseen change in the way our hobby works.
<p>The actual By-Laws will be much more extensive. Here I am touching on some points that I feel are pertinent to this article.


<ol type=a><li>The Board shall be composed of four people. Only three shall have voting power &#8212 President, Secretary and Treasurer. First, an odd number ensures voting feasibility. Second, three is small enough to make decisions without hindrance, yet is accountable to more than one person. There will also be one non-voting member, the Vice President.<br><br>
<li>Board term length = 3 years.<br><br>
<li>The Chair, President and Treasurer must be voted into office.<br><br>
<li>The Vice President will be appointed by the three voting members.<br><br>
<li>In case of emergency / abandonment by a Board member, the Vice President shall assume that person's role until a replacement is found.<br><br>
<li>Board / voting pool = <i>My initial thought would be the following</i>: Participants in latest Dipcon, plus 4 - 10 permanent members, (Alan Calhammer, Edi Birsan, Buzz Eddy, Dave Maletsky, David Hood, previous scholarship winners, a Hasbro representative, current Dip Pouch editor, Diplom.org head, tournament directors of Grand Prix <b>Diplomacy</b> events, etc...). <i>This list is obviously subjective, as I play FTF and on the DPJudge mainly.</i><br><br>
<li>The Board should meet once a year. This would be to determine winner, award size, and if any Board member wants/needs to be replaced. Meetings should be in person, but if all else fails, IM, EMail or phone meetings can suffice.<br><br>
<li>The Board can vote to change voting pool. This must be approved by current voting pool.<br><br>
<li>Quorum for all non board votes will be fifteen.<br><br>
<li>Clause for scholarship dissolving, "If this scholarship fund dissolves, all assets go to the last Dipcon Champion's Alma Mater's General Scholarship Fund", or something similar.

</ol>
<h2 id="prize">4. Prize</h2>
<p>The prize for our scholarship will of course depend on the amount of funds available. I'm sure the first couple of years will be rather meager. But with the generous donations from our great populace of Lawyers, Self-Made Men, IT professionals, Financial Wizards, Accountants, and other wealthy donors, our Scholarship fund will increase to a great amount quickly. Initially the prize would be monetary only, but eventually could include travel / lodging to <b>Diplomacy</b> Events. If enough money is gathered, we could break the award into multiple regional scholarships and a national scholarship.
<p>Prize guidelines:
<ol type=a>
<li>Award(s) granted in one year shall not exceed 20% of all funds.<br><br>
<li>Relatives of Board members are not eligible for any awards.<br><br>
<li>Award shall be either used for travel / lodging to <b>Diplomacy</b> events as designated by the board, or for education expenses.</ol>



<h2 id="misc">5. Miscellaneous</h2>
<p>As many good hearted people have found, giving can be a pain. The fraternal scholarship in which I participate has 2 main issues:
<ol type="a">
<li>Getting Applications
<p>Whether we receive few or incomplete applications, it is always a challenge to foster interest in scholarships. Not all young people are interested in applying. And ours will be difficult as the whole premise would be to gather interest in our hobby. I would therefore emphasize making the award overly simplistic. Maybe even automatic (highest Grand Prix rating is a no-brainer here). Whatever the mechanism, we need to ensure the whole transaction is a positive experience for the award winner (avoid 'Haughty Donor Syndrome').<br><br>
<li>Legal issues / tax compliance
<p>The rules for scholarships change, and while not overly complex, do require some time and effort to maintain. If/when the dollar amount reaches the $20,000 range, a third party scholarship managing organization should be looked at by the Board. The reason being is that Board members may become overwhelmed by their responsibilities in the accounting department. This should require a vote by the entire voting population, not just the Board.
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>The potential rewards of a National Diplomacy Scholarship are an increase in the pool of <b>Diplomacy</b> players, and a greater sense of community among the Diplomacy Corps, (PBEM, FTF and Snail Mail). The obstacles to overcome in setting up the scholarship are challenging, but Dipsters enjoy wrapping their minds around problems. This one should be a walk in the park.
