<blockquote><i><b>Frontline</b> is a
new column which will look at different contentious issues in <b>Diplomacy</b>, and attempt to
examine both sides of the question.
<p>The first topic to be featured is that of draw-whittling: the practice
of deliberately eliminating one or more Great Powers from a DIAS game
that (i) has lost diplomatic and tactical fluidity, and (ii) seems
likely to end in a draw; so as to reduce the number of players
included in the draw at the end.
<p>In <a href="/Zine/F2007M/Birsan/whittle.htm">another article in this issue</a>, Edi Birsan discusses the diplomatic consequences and possibilities of draw-whittling attitudes. However, that doesn't address the 'ethical' (for want of a better word!) aspects of the matter. Is draw-whittling a legitimate approach to <b>Diplomacy</b> that arises
naturally from the stated objectives of the game; or is it unnecessary and vindictive?
<p>Below, Eric Hunter (pro) and David Cohen (con) present two very different philosophies on this question.

Is draw-whittling a good idea, or a pointless waste of
time? Obviously it is not something that should ALWAYS
be done, or small Powers would have no reason to work
with a Stop-the-Leader Alliance to prevent a Solo; but
on the whole, it is a device to keep the end-game
dynamic and interesting when games might otherwise end
as soon as one Power has established a secure base of
Centers, and a lead in Center-Count that cannot be
easily overcome.
<p>Why is draw-whittling a legitimate course of action?
<ol type=n>
<li>For each player, the game has three end-states: Solo, Draw, and Loss.<br><br>
<li>A Solo is the "Object of the Game", so it therefore clearly has value.<br><br>
<li>A Draw is defined as a secondary objective in these terms, "players can end the game by agreement before a winner is determined. In this case, all players who still have pieces on the board share equally in the draw."
</ol>
<p>Therefore, a draw also has some value which is shared
among the survivors. So, the more survivors, the smaller
each one's share will be. In a two-way, five people have
lost, and the reward is split two ways. In a five-way,
only two people have lost, and that (theoretically smaller)
reward is split five ways; so a two-way is clearly better
than a five-way.
<p>My primary objective is to Solo, and hence defeat my six
opponents. If circumstances require that I accept a draw
instead, I still prefer to cause as many of my opponents
to lose as possible, so the smaller the draw, the better.
Is a two-way "worth more" than a five-way? Perhaps, or
perhaps not. Is it better to defeat five opponents than
just two? Clearly yes, in my view. Finally, if a large draw is just as good as a
small draw, then the most rational course to take is to vote for a
seven-way in 1901, and avoid the possible loss, is it not?
<p>Additionally, if you are the largest Power in a possible
Draw, encouraging whittling, and simultaneously warning
the smaller Powers that they are going to be whittled can
entice one of them to help you cross the stalemate-line
and get the Solo that a large Draw would have stopped.
<p>Who should be eliminated from a draw, if whittling is engaged
in? This is very definitely a judgment call. A knowledge of stalemate
lines is crucial (<a href="/Online/StalematesAtoY/">http://www.diplom.org/Online/StalematesAtoY/</a>), as is
a psychological assessment of the target. Will he threaten to throw the
Solo to avoid being whittled? How quickly will he act on that threat,
if he makes it? If his Centers are taken, can his place in the line be
filled by new builds before the largest Power breaks through the line?
Remember, even if you believe that a small Draw is better than a large
Draw, a large Draw is still better than a loss.
<td>
<p>Given the approved definition of draw-whittling, let us presume a "pure"
scenario.  In a non-tournament game, in Winter 1914, a sixteen dot Germany
&#8212 safely ensconced behind one of the usual Gibraltar to St. Petersburg
stalemate lines &#8212 is facing a couple of well positioned Mediterranean Powers
who have made it abundantly clear that they have absolutely no intention of
turning on each other, and the front is completely locked up.  Also present,
and bottled up by German Armies in Liverpool and Yorkshire, is an English
Army in Edinburgh.  The English have recently been taken over by a
replacement player, previously unknown to the German, so there is no in-game
or outside reservoir of either good or ill will.  The other three players
have stated that they would be willing to enter into a DIAS, and a proposal
for a four way DIAS has been made.  The question for the German is whether it "should" be
a three way draw or a four way draw.
<p>The object of the game is to win.  There is no chance for a win in this game
for Germany.  Given that there are no other in-game motivations, such as
revenge, it seems better for Germany to end the game now, for more than one
reason.
<p>First, to move on now would get the German player more quickly into
a new game, with a chance to win, and the new game will also likely be
tactically fluid, and thus more enjoyable than playing out Spring 1914 and
Fall 1914 in a robotic campaign to take Edinburgh.  This rationale applies
to both "normal" and gunboat <b>Diplomacy</b>.
<p>The second reason, applicable only
in non-gunboat situations, is more important, this being positive metagaming
consequences.  The "mercy" shown to the English player may engender good
will in all the other Powers, and the quicker end will also free up the
other players to more quickly join new, tactically fluid and, presumably,
more enjoyable games.
