<h2>WDC 2007 Results:<br>Tournament Director Matt Shields' Report</h2>
<p>Hi everyone,
<p>Thanks for your patience while we put together the final results for
WDC 17. I'm very happy with the way the event turned out. Tournament
directors are never entirely satisfied, but in this case I did walk
away pretty pleased. We had a solid turnout, a great venue, and a very
high level of play top to bottom. 
<p>We had 70 players play at least one round &#8212 three rounds with 9
boards, one round with 8 boards, and two rounds with 7 boards. The
final standings, including the results of all 49 boards, can be found
here:

<p>This is a Diplomacy database run by Jake Mannix, and was also the
utility I used to score the tournament while it was running. Board
seeding was done by Manus Hand's Diplomacy Tournament Manager.
Standings are on the left side. You'll have to scroll down just a bit
to view them.
<h2>MAIN EVENT</h2>
<p>As you've no doubt heard, WDC 17/Dipcon 40 was won by Doug Moore. Full
standings are at the end of this item. Rounding out the top 7 were,
Jake Mannix, Chris Martin, Mark Zoffel, Dan Lester, Adam Silverman,
and Tom Kobrin.
<p>There were six solo victories. Mike Hall as Russia, Yann Clouet and
Jake Mannix as Germany, Adam Silverman and Chris Martin as Austria,
and Doug Moore as France. Those listed as having less than 18 centers
in the center counts were conceded, but in all cases they appeared to
be forced on the board.

<h2>CHAOS GAME</h2>
<p>The "Best Viking" award ended up going to David Norman for winning the
Chaos game as Kiel with 15 centers. Not really a Viking, but his quick
conquest of Scandinavia made it seem appropriate.  
<h2>TEAM TOURNAMENT</h2>
<p>The Team Tournament was won by Team Overrated of Andy Bartalone, Chris
Martin, and Doug Moore. Their official score is slightly less than it
ought to be, because Doug and Chris' round 6 scores did not count due
to them both playing on the top board together.

<h2>WDC HOBBY MEETING</h2>
<p>There was no new business conducted Saturday at the WDC meeting, so
the main order of business was simply the introduction and discussion
of bids to host the 19th World Diplomacy Championships in 2009.
<p>There was only one bid &#8212 for Origins in Columbus, Ohio in the summer
of 2009. Although there was a good bit of discussion about the pros
and cons of the bid, the final vote was unanimous in favor. 
<h2>DIPCON HOBBY MEETING</h2>
<p>There was considerably more action on Friday at the DipCon meeting.
The first order of business was ratification of two amendments
originally passed in Charlottesville at DipCon 39.
<p>The first amendment was a proposal that beginning with DipCon 41, any
new amendment proposed to the DipCon Charter must be presented to the
Chair of the DipCon Society meeting in writing prior to the start of
the meeting.
<p>The second amendment was a proposal that upon passage of any new
amendment to the charter, after the meeting the Chair of the current
DipCon Society meeting must transmit to the Chair of the following
DipCon Society meeting a written record of the newly passed amendment,
so that the incoming Chair has the language of the amendment available
for ratification.
<p>Both of these amendments passed unanimously with little debate.
<p>There were two excellent bids made to host the DipCon 2008. The
selection process was simplified due to the fact that both bids were
being made by the same region, meaning that all votes would count
equally. 
<p>The first was a proposal to host by HuskyCon on Long Island in New
York. The second was a proposal that DipCon be held at the University
of Maine in Bangor. There were obvious merits to both proposals, and
in most years I suspect either bid would have won easily over most
others. In this case, since a choice had to be made, Bangor was
selected largely as an effort to incorporate into the mainstream North
American hobby an apparently large group of Diplomacy players who have
up until now remained largely unknown outside of New England. 
<p>Again, I'd like to thank everyone who attended for coming. As to the
rest of you &#8212 I hope we see you next year in Bangor, in 2009 in
Vienna, or at another tournament in your own neck of the woods. 
<p>Thanks,
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Matt Shields<br><br>
