<p align=justify>
I am happy to return to my pen and relate another of the adventures of my friend Sherlock Holmes, this time concerning his resolution of yet another conundrum posed by that eccentric Diplomacy-playing head of state, the Sultan of Suwat.
The reader may recall Holmes's other dealings with the Sultan, as recorded
under such titles as
<a href=/Zine/S1995M/Woolley/Puzzle.html>The Double Elimination Conundrum</a>,
<a href=/Zine/S1996M/Holmes>The Hunt for the Venison Camper</a>,
<a href=/Zine/F1997R/Holmes/sultan.html>The Dead-Letters Affair</a>,

and
<a href=/Zine/S2002R/Holmes/false.html>The Curious Case of the False Start</a>.

<p align=justify>
As it happened, I opened the door at 221B Baker Street, the flat of my good friend, after having spent the day attending to my patients in hospital.  At the back of the flat, Holmes stood at the large table, pipe in hand, staring at a docket of papers that (I could tell even at a distance) bore the great seal of the Suwati nation.  At once, I knew that Holmes had again been visited by Lord Reginald Fortescue from the Foreign Office.  No sooner had I come to this conclusion and hung my hat than the booming voice of Lord Reginald sounded from corridor:  "Ah, Dr. Watson!  How excellent that you should join us!  Will you take a snifter of brandy?  I have just fetched a bottle." <!-- , as it seems our friend will not be very talkative company for a while." -->

<p align=justify>
I shook hands with Lord Reginald
and accepted the glass he offered me.  "What has engrossed Holmes so deeply,
milord?" I asked.

<p align=justify>
"Another challenge from that sly Sultan, I'm afraid, Doctor," came the expected
answer. We I raised our glasses in a quick silent toast to the mind of
that strange Suwati.

<p align=justify>
"I gathered as much, your lordship.  I am certain that Holmes will be able to assist."

<p align=justify>
"That is most definitely the hope of His Majesty's government, Doctor.  Holmes has never let us down before, and as you know from the state of the world, it is most urgent for the lease on the deepwater facilities of Port Suwat to be extended."  (I did know, of course, of the growing turmoil on the continent, and how important the lease had become to the Royal Navy.)

<p align=justify>
"Pray tell, milord, what is the nature of the enigma this time?"

<p align=justify>
"Sadly, Dr. Watson, I am not precisely sure, myself.  It would seem that the Sultan once more wishes the lease extension to be signed at a specific place, but determining that place is now the task of Mr. Holmes.  I propose that you and I
take our brandy by the fire and allow Holmes his privacy."
<!--
Holmes was now once again deep in thought, so
<!--
He rose and walked to the large table where Holmes still stood, deep in thought.
-->
Lord Fortescue rummaged through his briefcase, and I followed him to the sitting
room, he with a stack of papers in hand.  "I brought along a second copy of the papers we received from the Sultan, having foreseen the possibility that our friend Holmes will need to retain the information here for some days to assist him as he works."
As we settled into the overstuffed chairs before the fireplace,
Lord Reginald lay the papers before me on a tea table.
<!, and continued his explanation.>
<p align=justify>
"You see, Doctor, along with the lease extension document (which must be
signed soon) the Sultan included only two things for us.  Firstly, he provided
us with the orders that were issued in the
Spring and Fall movement phases of the opening year of a game of Diplomacy.
Second and finally, a cryptic note."

<p align=justify>
I looked at the contents of the packet.  Each of the two seasons' orders
was accompanied by a map, which I later learned was created by members of the Foreign Ministry staff, using the standard Calhamer Club placename abbreviations
that the Sultan was known to use exclusively.
Although many of the orders were sensible, some of the others betrayed this to
be a rather curious opening year.
For example, considering the events of both Spring and Fall,
I counted no fewer than five occasions when pairs of units owned by the same
player intentionally bounced against one another for no possible tactical reason.
As if that
wasn't enough strange behaviour for the first year of a Diplomacy game,
France allowed England to simply sail straight into Brest unmolested!

To accompany the orders that were sent by the Sultan,
the Foreign Office had also created a document and map
listing the supply centre ownership and showing the position of the
units as the Winter Adjustments phase of 1901 was to begin.
Lord Fortescue told me of this and laid it

Setting aside the maps and the curious orders,
I moved on to the examine the

text that had accompanied them.  As he offered me the paper with the
Sultan's words on it, Lord
Reginald said, "As you can see, Doctor, the message that was included with
the moves
consists of a number of cryptic sentences.  It is this message that now seems to be
holding Holmes's interest."
<p align=justify>
I took the Sultan's message from Lord Reginald, and read it.  It was apparently written in the Sultan's own hand, and in his stilted English:

<p align=justify>
I was at a loss for words.  
"I am not sure what the Sultan means for us to make of all this, milord."

<p align=justify>
"Nor am I, Doctor.
<!--
At the Foreign Office,
we certainly did not know what to make of the package.
<!--
We were left only with the hope that the next dispatch would
somehow relieve our confusion.  Alas, this was not to be.
The second package, which arrived a few days after the first,
contained only another short message.
<!--
the build and remove orders that were made
in the Winter that followed, and
another few sentences of text.
-->
Unfortunately, this is all with which we were provided.  
You now know as much as we do, I am afrai, I am afraid; what you see here is
everything that I have turned over to your friend Holmes.
The only other item in the package was the lease extension
document itself.
<!--
and as you know, 
the Crown is most anxious to see this extension consummated.
-->
The document has a deadline -- now only a fortnight away -- and the signature area on the final page of the document reads, 'Signed at the appointed place'.  Once we received the packet, the analysts at Whitehall went to work, but decided at length that it would be best if we engage Mr. Holmes."

<p align=justify>
I looked again at the map, and at the string of orders that had resulted
in that position.  I could make no sense of the whole, and the Sultan's brief
instructions -- if his three-part message could be called that -- provided me no
assistance.
After a while spent in thought (and in shortening my snifter), I broke the silence, saying, "Well, talking of
Holmes, Lord Reginald, let us see how he is getting along," and we rose with
our brandy and strode toward the rear of the flat.
<p align=justify>
Only when we stood across the table from my friend did Holmes lift his gaze from the papers on the table to take notice of my arrival.
"Ah, Watson!  It is good to see you returned!  I trust that your unhealthy
charges are doing well.

I see that you, however, have returned a bit the worse for wear.
I note you are not quite recovered from your slight mishap at
St. Michael's Hospital.  Rather dark on the east wing of the third floor,
don't you think?"
<p align=justify>
"Quite right; they should get some lighting in that place!  Why,
I had only just....  I say, Holmes!  How the devil...?!"
<p align=justify>
"It's quite simple, Watson.  You have a light reddish patch
of mud on the inside scuff of your left shoe.  Given your duties today,
there is only one place in London where you would go and where that
type of soil is found, and that is to the outside
patio stair of St. Michael's Hospital.  At that hospital,
there is a pharmacy in the east wing of the third floor
and it is often that the chemist is out.
You have laudanum stains on your coat so I conclude that you went to
the pharmacy to procure some laudanum
and slipped in that dark room."
<p align=justify>
Holmes was, of course, entirely correct about my experience, not two
hours earlier, at St. Michael's.
As many times as my friend has made such observations and deductions, I
have never quite become accustomed to them.
The great detective drew from his pipe, then said,


"Watson, our visitor
has brought with him a very pretty puzzle for us."
<p align=justify>
"Yes indeed, Holmes; Lord Reginald has been detailing the problem to me in the
drawing room.  I admit that I am quite in the dark as to what the Sultan
is up to this time!"
<p align=justify>
"It does present a mystery, Watson, but with some thought, it seems that
the terms that the Sultan set can be quickly and easily determined."
<p align=justify>
Lord Reginald was quite surprised by this statement.  "Holmes!"
he exclaimed, 
"do you mean to say that you have solved this riddle?  The Foreign Office has
struggled for over a week, and within the span of an hour, you have determined
how we are to ensure the extension of the lease?"

<p align=justify>
"No, not just yet, milord," came Holmes's reply, "but I believe that it
shall not be too much longer.  It now seems to be a simple case of playing
out this unusual game of Diplomacy.  A short while at the game table,
I would think, and we should have the answer the Sultan wishes us to find."
<p align=justify>
Lord Fortescue seemed dejected.  "I rather feared you would say that,
Holmes.  Playing out the game was, in fact,
the same recommendation made by the analysts at Whitehall.
This, though, seems to me and everyone else (including all of
these same analysts!) to be an impossibility,
and so we naturally questioned such a proposed course of action.
Are you quite sure?"
<p align=justify>
I was very confused, and I had to ask,
"Play the game forward?
Firstly, what makes you both say that this is what
we are to do?"
<p align=justify>
Holmes answered me.  "Surely, Watson, that much should be clear from the
Sultan's brief set of instructions.  In fact, it would seem that the Sultan
has laid
<!-- his first message seems to
contain only -->
two tasks for us.  One of these tasks is" (Holmes
consulted the papers on the table) "to 'determine
each
final (eventual) Diplomacy centre being captured.'
Interesting wording, wouldn't you say,
Watson?"
<p align=justify>
I could only shrug and refill my snifter of brandy as Holmes continued.
"You see, Watson, we have been given a position and instructed to
determine which supply centres are the final centres that would lose
their neutral status if the game were played out."
<p align=justify>
"Even so, Holmes, how would determining
the final centres to be taken
(even if such a thing is possible)
do us any good?"
<p align=justify>
"That, my dear Watson, is also made quite clear in the Sultan's message.
The second of the Sultan's tasks is for
the Crown to purchase a round-trip ticket -- 'begone and back' was the Sultan's
term for it -- and to instruct the envoy from the Foreign Ministry to use this
ticket to reach the Sultan and finalise the lease extension."
<p align=justify>
I looked again at the initial message, this time with my friend's insight, and I had
to agree.  "Yes, Holmes, I suppose you are right.  The Sultan is asking for
the British emissary to travel on a round trip ticket to meet with the Sultan
and sign the lease extension.
Am I to understand that solving this riddle will tell us the location
where the signing is to take place?"
<p align=justify>
"It will, Watson, but it seems that this information will not suffice.
To be able to purchase the proper ticket, then in addition
to determining where the Sultan awaits, we must determine a second
location as well.
The Sultan specifically says that we are to determine 'each final'
centre.  From this wording, we can conclude that it is not sufficient
simply for us to
know the final <i>single</i> centre to lose its neutrality;
we must know more than one.
Notice, too, that later in his message, the Sultan uses the
word 'earlier' -- not 'earli<i><u>est</u></i>', but
'earli<i><u>er</u></i>'.  From this, we know that the final <i>two</i> such
centres are what we
are after.  Given all this, and the Sultan's admonition that the
envoy should begin his voyage from the 'earlier de-neutralized centre',
we know that the
round-trip must begin and end at the supply centre that loses its neutrality
second-to-last, and that the Sultan awaits the envoy at the supply centre that
is the final neutral to be acquired."
<p align=justify>
Lord Fortescue and I looked at our friend with silent admiration.
After a short pause, Holmes added,
"Of course, it is imperative that the emissary travels on a round-trip
ticket, milord.  The message
did say 'confirmation demanded', indicating that the proper ticket
will be necessary for our envoy to gain an audience with the Sultan.
Whether by train or by steamer, it matters not, I am sure, but most certainly,
our man must travel on a round-trip ticket."
<p align=justify>
"Begone and back.  Yes, I see now, Holmes.  But from where and to where?"
<p align=justify>
Holmes simply chose to smile at the two of us,
which I admit only made me more anxious to know his
mind.  While Holmes drew contentedly from his pipe, I stared hard at the
twinkle in his eye. Suddenly, I felt that rush of adrenalin that I feel all too
infrequently, on those rare occasions when I have an insight that I believe will
please my friend Holmes, who constantly challenges my powers of deduction.
"Lord Reginald!  I know what you should do!" I exclaimed.
<p align=justify>
Even Holmes seemed surprised by this.  "Indeed, Watson?"
<p align=justify>
I puffed myself up with pride.  "Certainly, Holmes!  We need not play the game
forward at all!  Consider the current situation," I said, pointing down at
the map of the game as it stood ready for the Winter 1901 adjustments. "There are eight unowned supply centres.  If the Crown can
afford the expense," I smiled, "it seems to me that a mere fifty-six round-trip tickets -- seven from Belgium to each of the other unowned centres, seven from Denmark, and so forth -- will certainly cover the requirements!  Dispatch fifty-six envoys, milord, and worry not!"
<p align=justify>
Lord Reginald was excited by this prospect, but Holmes simply shook his head.
"You are correct, Watson, that one of these fifty-six envoys would bear the
ticket that the Sultan expects to see, and you are correct that this envoy
would reach the city where the Sultan awaits.
However, you forget, Watson, that the envoy must bring with him the
original lease document sent to us by the Sultan and which is embossed with
the great seal of his Sultanate.  Without meaning to disparage
the talents at the Foreign Office, milord, I daresay that it would not
be possible given our deadline to attempt to duplicate the elaborate seal
of the Suwati nation,
and to forge so many copies of the lease document.  Even if we did achieve
such a thing, Watson, remember also that six <i>incorrectly</i>-ticketed
envoys would also reach the correct embassy, and forty-nine more would be
approaching various Suwati embassies elsewhere, all seeking the Sultan.
If any of these envoys attempts to present
his credentials before the correct envoy might happen to do so,
a simple telegraphic
message will most assuredly inform the Sultan, and 
he will lose all willingness to sign any extension of the much-needed
lease.
No, Watson, we must solve the puzzle; such a short-cut will not do."
<p align=justify>
Holmes was correct, as usual, and Lord Reginald returned to his state of
dejection.
"It all makes sense,"  Lord Fortescue began.
"However, since the question of how to play this game of
Diplomacy forward is still open, it unfortunately seems
that what remains for us to accomplish is quite impossible."
<p align=justify>
"I agree, Holmes," I said.  "How can we play out a game
of Diplomacy from a given position?  There is no way to know the minds of
the seven players and to determine what orders they might give their units.
Even if we knew -- and we do not! -- the subjects of player conversation
and even if we were acquainted with the details concerning any of the
informal agreements
in which the players might trust (whether wisely or not),
we cannot possibly foresee the fates of these
alliances.  The foibles of human nature and
human error would surely prohibit our forecasting any moves!"
<p align=justify>
"You are quite correct, Watson, but in this case, the Sultan obviously
wishes for us to play the game forward. Therefore, we must conclude
that he has given us ample information to determine -- in your words --
the 'minds of the seven players' at each turn."
<p align=justify>
At this, Lord Reginald chose to sit down at the table, and Holmes
and I joined him.  A look of tired exasperation was on the nobleman's
face.  "Holmes, it is obvious to me that to try to divine the future of
this game is madness.  The units are simply being ordered
haphazardly, to my eye!"
<p align=justify>
Holmes smiled.  "It would seem so at first, but with careful observation
and some clues from the curious message that the Sultan provided, we can
see that there is method in the madness, milord.  Indeed, the game is
being played quite consistently and in a very orderly fashion by all
seven players."
<p align=justify>
I could not contain my disagreement.  "Consistent and orderly, Holmes?
Really now!"
<p align=justify>
"Yes, Watson, and if we simply take the position we have been given and
continue doing just as the players have been doing, we can certainly
determine the two supply centres
which are the last to lose their neutral status."

"I truly cannot fathom what you are saying, Holmes.  I have stared at
those silly moves for hours if not days," Lord Reginald said. "I see
neither rhyme nor reason for the orders, and I have no idea what the
future might
possibly hold for any
of these players."
<p align=justify>
Holmes lay his pipe on the table.
"Oh, the moves are not without reason, gentlemen.  Watson,
if you will fetch us a Diplomacy set from
the library,
I believe we can send Lord Reginald back to Whitehall within the hour to set in 
motion the completion of
this unique diplomatic mission.
If you would be so kind, Watson, while
you are up, I would ask that you bring me a snifter for some of that brandy you two are enjoying."

<p align=justify>
I rose from the table and complied.  When I returned with the Diplomacy set,
Lord Reginald and I set the board up in the position before the adjustments
of Winter 1901, while Holmes filled the snifter that I had brought for him.
<p align=justify>
With the board set up, Holmes reached for the box of extra pieces, and 
started
adding units to the board, while calmly announcing,
"I trust that both of you have most certainly determined the Winter 1901
Adjustment phase orders that will begin our work."
<p align=justify>
At this, I had to stop my friend and express my incredulity once more.
"Holmes, I
truly cannot see how we can hope to divine the builds, the removals, and the
movements of the pieces as the game progresses!"
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
Holmes grinned freely.
"Elementary, Doctor,
<!Effortlessly, directly,>
considering
basic, clear-cut, down-to-earth, emotionless
Diplomacy, created by Allan B. Calhamer."
