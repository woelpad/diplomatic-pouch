<p>Well I went to Canada with a heavy heart. I left my family at the
airport at 8:30am and I didn't want to go. I will never forget the look
on my little boys face as long as I live. It was killing me. I very
nearly said stuff it and went back home. I don't travel well alone.
Where the hell were you Kenny? Needless to say they ran out of VB a long
way short of the US.

<p>So I get to Canada and it is 8:15am the same day. I have hardly slept on
the plane and have been searched twice by US customs even though I only
went to the US on may way to Vancouver. They fingerprinted me and then
let me get back on to the very same plane and sit in the very same seat.

<p>Nathan, Mike and Laurent were great with answering any queries I had and
it was fantastic to walk through customs and straight to the bar to meet
Len Tennant (a champion bloke who should be commended for all of the
help he gave the out of towners.Hurrah for Len).

<p>I had a few days up my sleeve so I stayed a night at the backpackers and
spent a bit time at the beach (where I finally got some sleep). Up at
3:15am thanks to this thing jetlag and straight to the beach for a walk.
The next few days I got to see every sunrise and enjoy ed some great
weather. Toured around a bit and eventually on the Thursday rolled up to
the tournament for round number one.


<h2>THE FIRST ROUND</h2>

<p>I am allocated Germany and the only person I know is Don Del Grande. So
naturally I tried to ally with him. We battled hard but it is tough to
get a German/Turk alliance to work (even for me). Russia is a bloke by
the name of Phil Burk (A top quality guy and unfortunately for me a bit
of a drinker). England is a young kid by the name of Narek who did not
speak much and was very hard to work with but as the tourney went on he
came out of his shell and I was so happy to see him smiling and enjoying
himself even though we killed him. France was Greg Duenow and also a
bloke who doesn't mind a beer and having a bit of a laugh. Jim O'kelley
was the Austrian and I wouldn't trust him as far as I could throw him
(he just looked too comfortable with his own skill). Again unfortunately
another bloke who doesn't mind a drink.........Damn. It wasn't going to
be easy to play with all of these new people but I would just have to
see what I could come up with.


<p>So what to do? Obviously I needed to form a plan. So I start to think of
one......... time passes....... Nothing......... more time
passes............ nope still drawing a blank....... Eventually Phil
asks me about Narek (We don't want to kill the young kid do we? He
says). B******t! I reply (or something to that effect). Someone is
going to do it so we better do it first. I ally with Russia and France
to get rid of Narek and we did. So my back is safe and Jim O'Kelley can't
be trusted to keep Tyrolia and Bohemia empty. It isn't a bad start and I
get the better of a game divided in two halves, North and South. I
finish equal top with Jim on 11 centres each. There is no doubt that
Greg was lucky I am not the killer I used to be or he would have been in
deep trouble but I liked the guy and he didn't deserve to be killed. I
refused to play the scoring system and go for an outright lead at the
expense of a good ally. We head off to the pub and that's when the fun
really starts. I had a top night and recommend to everyone that when
these guys come down South for a game make sure you meet up with them
and help them out....but....don't play poker with any of them.


<h2>ROUND TWO</h2>

<p>The next day I am rolling up feeling a bit ordinary, at some point, I
don't know when. I think this was the day Phil decides to reward me with
something called "Gin and Tonic" from a plastic cup. I don't normally
drink this stuff but it tasted a bit like busted glass and petrol. It
will flatten your tyres for a bit but it will also keep you going.
Thanks Phil.....you bastard! Probably the second worst idea I had was to
wash this down with a somewhat warm "<a href="http://www.kokaneebeer.com/">Kokanee</a>" (Canadian beer) from the
fountain (courtesy of Mike Hall). I may have been drinking this in the
arvo but I was still on Aussie time. Then it hits me......My plan. These
guys are stuffed. I am 17 hours ahead of them. I already know what is
going to happen because it happened yesterday for me. I just have to
remember what I did yesterday.........time passes........
Nothing......time passes....shit. Better find a new plan.


<p>The board. I'm England. Rick Depster is France. Tim Harrison Germany.
Guenter Hopf is Austria (Guenter came out with the proposal to have
World dip con in Austria in a beautiful looking castle and I support the
idea it looks like it will be great fun). Faissal Kassam is Italy.
Emmanuel Du Pontavice is Russia and Brad Basden as Turkey.
I started this game by chatting with the Turk to find out how much
pressure the Russian would be under. I am struggling to remember much
more about the game other than the fact I found it very tough and time
consuming. I was having to do a lot of negotiation to get even the
tiniest amount of agreement on any moves. I didn't trust anyone as I did
not know anyone and I thought I was in for it. Some how I held off the
Russian/German/Frenchman and was able to fight my way back to some sort
of a decent score. The draw couldn't come quick enough and the brain
needed a rest. There was obviously potential to play on due to the fact
no-one was anywhere near 18 but at the time I was happy to draw and
have as many people included as possible. There was still an afternoon
round and time for a quick beer or two before it.


<p>The biggest two problems I had encountered were the fact that I was in a
strange land where I knew virtually nobody but everyone knew me. I
reckon I heard the following at least a hundred times.... "Oh! I know
you. You're an ex world champ. To which I started to respond "Rob will
do". The second biggest problem is all of the new players. It takes a
few seconds to get a feel for someone and their level of diplomacy but
it takes a long time to find out their motivations. I was expecting
Canadians to be allied together but the fact was there where so many US
players there they knew each other as well. Not to mention a French
contigent who I later found out were from all over the place.


<p>So with these problems in mind I moved on to round three.

<h2>ROUND THREE</h2>

<p>I consult with my team mates. Mike Hall has an 18. I have two good
results and Chris Brand is like a lead ball and chain dragging us
back.
<p>Mike and I read Chris the riot act. Give him the team spirit lift he
needs and at the end of the day he has a 13 and a 9 to his name
but now
it's Mikes turn. He sits out a round and follows it up with a two. I
however manage to accumualte solidly and our team isn't looking
too bad.
There is only one problem. For some reason people are getting 18's
left
right and centre. One in heat one. One in heat two and in heat 3 a 17
and 16 which under this scoring system are exactly the same as an 18.
Our team is doing well but to win the team effort we will have to
pull
out some amazing results.

<p>My game begins and I am Russia, England is Doug Moore(the soon to
be new
world champion), France is Mitchell Wagizuer, Germany is Chris Young,
Italy is Adam Lang, Tukey is James Istvanffy and Austria is Yann
Clouett.

<p>My plan is to try and find an ally. The enemies will come I won't
need
to find them. With four countries on your border and the fact that I
don't know any of them it makes it very hard to have any real plan.
After talking with Yann and Adam though I tried to get an AIR
alliance
to knock out Turkey and attack Germany to start with.
Unfortunately the
lads weren't prepared to be that bold. I started to work on the
German
about Sweden and thought to myself I am in a lot of trouble here
as he
simply wouldn't commit.  The English is talking fairly favourably
and I
list him as fourth on my enemy list. The Austrian wants a bounce
and I
have to agree. Turkey was also not to be trusted. He also wants a
bounce
and I have to agree. So the orders get read out. The Turk goes to
Armenia and the English are a concern.
In the fall the mad scramble goes ahead and I somehow manage to
convince
Chris (Germany) to let me have Sweden. He seems fairly
inexperienced and
wqas difficult to work with but he did let me in so I will try to
work
with him. The English however just keeps enough pressure on me up
North.
He never goes for St.P. but he never needed to. When the German
and the
English kick me out of Sweden I disband the fleet in the North to try
and buy some time and sell my soul. Fortunately the Englishmen
decides
there are easier fish to fry. The whole time the North is sorting
itself
out I am working fairly well with Yann as Austria and I manage to
keep
the Turk out. Eventually the shoe is on the other foot and Turkey
falls
mostly to me.
We all agree to a fairly placid draw. Doug tops the board with 9
and I
have 8. It was a tough board with a lot of diplomacy and again for
me a
pretty good result. A good alliance with Yann and Adam saved my bacon
and I simply could do nothing about the Englishman due to the fact
I had
to concentrate so hard in the south.

<h2>ROUND FOUR</h2>

<p>So it's time to talk to the team. I am starting to understand the
scoring system and to me if I want to make the top board I am
probably
better off stopping at this point. The way it was explained to me you
just had to play in at least three rounds and if you were in the
top 7
points wise at the end of round 5 you get on the top board. Of course
the one problem with this is, I was there to play diplomacy and
was not
interested in sitting out the next two rounds to then play the
final if
I had enough points (I was fairly confident I would have enough
points
but I am not sure. If someone wants to figure out if I did have
enough.
Feel free and let me know). I really wanted to keep playing with
all of
these new people as the dip is so different and new.

<p>So I get allocated Italy. This was without a doubt the best game
of dip
I have played in years. I did finish on zero points but let me
explain
why I thought it was my best game of dip. Austria is a young bloke by
the name of Grant Smith. France is vincent Carry. Turkey is Tom
Kobrin.
Germany is Mark Zoffel. Russia is Alex Amman and England was Andy
Hull.
I talked and talked to everyone.

<p>To begin with Vincent and I agreed not to bother each other as
Vincent
thought he had an EG problem. He was right. They allied from the
beginning to the end and were totally unbreakable. They both ended
with
a 14 but one of them could have had an 18 they just stopped diploming
with me at the wrong time (don't get me wrong they both continued to
talk but that was all it was. Just talk.). They may have thought they
had another way to get the 18 or maybe they just didn't want one
but I
was amazed I couldn't give one to either of them. I had come to the
conclusion that people were giving 18's away as it simply didn't
matter.
If you get 0 for being knocked out why not get 0 in an 18 and ensure
everyone else in the 18 gets 0.

<p>We had a long way to go though before we were ready to talk 18's.
In the
beginning the German didn't want me in Tyrolia and the Austrian was
scared of this too. So Venice held. In the fall I put the fleet into
Tunis and the army in Apulia held. I didn't trust the Austrian and he
had moved back into Trieste and thus gave up Galicia. In the next
turn
the Austrian allowed me to go to Tyrolia and follow to Venice. I
now had
a second fleet and moved to insure I could stop Tom in Turkey. Tom
was
extremely shifty and I did well to pick him in the beginning (I
think).
Of course it is guess time for the Austrian and I am trying to
give hime
the best advice so that we can work together. Unfortunately he
doesn't
follow my adivce but does the right thing and bounces out the
Russian. I
am happy about this but the Austrian simply doesn't seem to
believe me
when I say I am genuine. As soon as the timer starts everyone on the
board wants to talk to me and this is where I thought I played my
best
dip. The English want to know if I am going to affect the war in
France. The German wants to know why I am in Tyrolia and Venice. The
Russian and Turks also want to know why I am in Tyrolia and Venice.
France simply wants any assistance I can offer. So with a fleet in
Ion
to cover that end. One fleet must go to France's aid. The army in
Tyrolia
moves to Bohemia and the other follows it up.

<p>The next turn is more of the same all the other 6 players are
wanting to
know about the units in their part of the world. Austria is
getting more
and more nervous and this is where my problems begin. I am having to
spend far too much time trying to keep the Austrian happy and calm. I
move into Bohemia and fall back into Venice. I move to assist the
French
while at the same time trying to stay in a 3 way with the English and
Germans against everyone else. This was a three way that could not
fail
because none of the other 4 had a clue I was actively working it. Of
course there was still lots of time to opt out of it or buy into it
completely.

<p>Next turn I move into Galicia and am asked by the Frenchman to cover
Marsielles for him. This means now that the army in Venice is
needed in
Piedmont. I am gaining centres at the request of other people. It
doesn't get any better than that. Austria and I have worked well
together. We have kicked the Russian out and pinned the Turk in the
corner but Grant continues to get more and more nervous and
conservative
and I am struggling to keep it going. He seems to think that my
one army
in Galicia can do him harm even though it is actively keeping the
Russians and the Turks off his back.

<p>Next I get into Rumania. I also have managed to consolidate with the
Frenchman and he is stopping the E/G or at least slowing the E/G
down.

<p>I capture Spain again at the request of the Frenchman.

<p>Unfortunately it is about this time I make my mistake. Due to the
fact
the Grant is so nervous we stopped attacking and tried to simply hold
off the Turk and the Russian. We should have pushed on into
bulgaria but
we didn't. Eventually I lose Rumania. We can hold a line against
the E/G
but it now requires an Austrian army to stay in Piedmont and
support me
in Marseilles. France is down to one fleet in Portugal and my
fleets are
in Spain and the West med. The English have men coming but we could
hold
him off. Then it happens. Austria decides to simply run for his
home and
defend only against the German. When he leaves Piedmont that is
the end
for Port/Spain and Marseilles. It also means that Turkey and Russia
may
have places to go. Mark does too good a job on the Russian though and
Tom is just doing what is best for Turkey. Time ticks away and the
diplomacy becomes pointless. I am talking to everyone still but the
battle lines are drawn and no-one is interested in any sort of plan
apart from the Russian and the Austrian in forming a stalemate line.
This line will never hold though as Grant wants to move into
Tyrolia and
bohemia instead of sitting in his home centres. He leaves his back
totally exposed to Tom and Tom just starts taking centres of him
and the
russian. We are doomed.
A few turns go by and France and Austria cease to exist. Russia and I
are on 3 and Tom is on about 6. Totally cut off from the only
troops I
can work with (the Russians) I simply shake his hand say well
played put
my orders in the box and go downstairs to the pub.

<p>I come back a few hours later to find some people upset that I
went to
the pub. The german is most upset about it but I am still not sure
why.
Maybe he was going to talk to me next turn and stab the English
for the
18. I don't know. I told them all there was no point in staying and
wasting my time so I left. This did mean that the TD had to do my
retreats as my country went into civil disorder but big deal. The
rules
cover this. I could have told the TD I was going to the pub but I
didn't
think of it and I didn't think it really mattered. O'Well as Mark
said
we will have to agree to disagree on that one. As I said this was my
best game of Dip for the tournament. I was totally involved in all
parts
of the board with every other country and the Austrian and I were
close
to pulling off an amazing game of balance of power diplomacy. It
was a
shame we didn't get there but it is only a game. In the end there was
only the E/G both on 14 with 46% of the pot and Turkey on 6 for a
negative score losing almost 2 percent of his ante.

<p>I usually don't remember too much about my games but I did
remember this
one. Maybe because I was so involved everywhere with everyone and
really
having to work my butt off to stay in the game. A fun game but in the
end all for nothing.


<h2>ROUND FIVE</h2>

<p>Off to round 5 for a new start. The beers are tasting good and I can
smell blood in the water.
<br><br>
<table cellpadding=3><tr><th>Power<th>Player<th>Centers<th>Score
<tr align=center><td>Austria <td>Eric MEAD<td>0<td>0

<p>Hey look, I just learnt how to cut and paste so I don't have to tell
everyone who played what countries. You can see the resulting
scores; but
how did we get there?

<p>I didn't trust Austria; he wants an A/T. I didn't trust Russia, he
wants
an R/T. I am also wary of Italy as he wants to work with me in an
I/T.
This is a new feeling. At every board until now I have been
struggling
to find an ally and now it looks like I have heaps of them. Nathan
tells
me he is just wrapped to be playing a game with me and he seems
genuine
but he is in France and it will be a long time before we can
affect each
other much. Michael was gone so fast I can't even remember what he
looks
like and Eric was gone pretty quick too. Dan was a nice bloke and
I was
glad to see him make the top board. The game went in pretty straight
forward way. I shafted the Austrian and when the Russians and the
Italians struggled to make headway against the French and Germans I
gained little bits and pieces. With Nicholas I tried everything I
could
think of to break up Nathan and Dan but we just couldn't do it. It
looked for a minute like we might have when Russia and I did a
fake stab
to allow Dan and me to grow but Nathan threw his pad into the
window and
yelled very dramatically at Dan and they rejoined forces ( I still
don't
know if this was just I show but I suspect it may have been). It
didn't
matter to me as I simply got more points at Nicholas's expense and he
had so few it didn't really matter to him anyway.
Rob as Italy played a very sensible game of balance to insure that me
and Nathan couldn't cut him up and so at 11,11,8,4 there was nothing
else to do but go and drink yet more beer.

<p>The interesting bit to this game was the pidgeon.........but that's
another story. Trust me it isn't that interesting but let me say this
"No wildlife was harmed during the course of this game"

<p>It is at this point that they read out the top 7.

<p>It is going to be tough to make the top 7 without an 18 and I didn't
have one and everyone was telling me that people were getting them
back
at the convention while I was in the pub. If you look at the overall
scores for the boards it only lists two 18's but there is a 14,two
16's
and a 17 that were all awarded 100 percent of the pot. The
equivalent of
the 18. How a 14 is equal to an 18 I will never know but that is just
another scoring system debate.

<p>I did have 4 excellent games and one elimination (in the game I
called
my "best game"). Equal top of the board in two of them with 11
centres
(one worth 37.9 the other worth 37) and second by one centre in the
other two games (again different points allocated due to the
complexities of the system). As I said earlier I think I may have
made
the top board if I stopped playing the games after the third
round. If
this is true I don't like the system at all. I don't like a system
that
encourages people not to play.

<p>I am sure some of the things I have said will cause much debate.
Debate
is good. Debate in good faith if you must but keep it in mind that
it is
just a debate and we will not all agree. The organisers of the
tournament did a great job. I had a fantastic time and met some
wonderful people. Many of whom I will see again in my country if they
get here. I have offered my assistance to a heck of a lot of them if
they ever do get to Aus and have even offered a select 20 or so a
bed at
my place if needed when they do get here.

<p>They read out the top 7 and I am not there so I toddle off to my
board
to meet them.

<h2>ROUND SIX</h2>

<p>Again. How cool is this cutting and pasting?

<p>I am now on a board with two people I have actually met in the
tournament and this makes things a bit easier. I have a plan and
that is
to try and work with Rob and try and teach Chris a trick or two.
Since I
had played with them I thought this to be only fair. I can't win the
tournament now so there is no point in the other 63 of us trying
to win
so I guess this round is just for fun. ( My thoughts here are that
"Second aint worth shit if you really want first"). France-May
surprised
me. I thought she would be a female Yann Clouet but he hasn't
taught her
all of the tricks yet (still very easy on the eye and a good laugh).
Gihan was a nice bloke and we ended up sharing a meal and a few beers
afterwards but he was to clever for me in the game (and possibly
himself). Andrew Nick was damn good, too good. He had to be stopped
because he and Charles were going to wipe the board with the lot
of us
if we weren't careful. This obviously meant Charles was very good as
well. Rob and I did well to half work together but maybe we should
have
done better. Our units never really worked closely enough. If we had
worked correctly Gihan would never have survived. As a result I would
have to say I made a bit of a mistake in this game that probably cost
Rob more than me. I think it may have been because I think that this
game is a waste of time because I am no longer in a position to
win the
tournament. We finished up our game in a funny hidden draw system
that
again has its pros and cons and all headed off to the pub. Chris
was
very bubbly and seemed quite happy with the game and I hope he got
something out of it. Thus the game wouldn't have been a waste for
him.

<p>I don't know if these scores counted towards the teams event or
not but
Chris and I finished strong topping our board but poor old Mike fell
away with a 2. It had started oh so well for him with an 18 but
following that with a 7 and a 2 obviously wasn't enough to get him to
the top board. I don't know why he played only the four rounds.
Maybe if
he reads this he can drop me a line and let me know. Did he think
he had
enough points from his three games to make the top board? Only he
knows.

<p>Whether they counted or not we didn't do too bad. An Aussie, A
Canadian
and a half Canadian/Englishman managed to finish in fourth and
stop the
Americans from finishing 1st,2nd,3rd and 4th.

<p>We came back at 3pm as requested by the organisers to find out the
results and see all of the awards.

<p>Again the organisers did a great job. There were so many awards I was
nearly sober by the time they had finished giving them out. There
was a
film maker wandering around the whole time so hopefully we will
get to
see some of the footage in the future.

<p>To all of those who helped me out with travel and accommodation I
thank
you.

<p>To Sean Colman and the sponsor of the Australian diplomacy tournament
that so generously gave me the flight to Canada, thank you.

<p>To all of the people I met and got to play a game with, thank you.

<p>All the best and I will see you all again sometime when you get
down under!<br><br>
