Regarding the eye's color of Mona Lisa, I have something to say, As ý have visited and left a messages to the Guest page of Mona Lisa, I am just likely Mona Lisa, and my eye's color is also sometimes "brown" and sometimes "Hazel",
Somehow, their color cahnegs to brown from hazel or just opposite,
For example if therebis make up on my eyes could be brown,  If there is no make up, they are brown, during the sunshined weatger, are always "hazel",
As a matter of facr, nobody can be sure about the colours, better to accept, how they aree seem to be at that moment,
This is my opinion of course,
Regards&love

Hi Manus,
Below is a letter sent to me by Robert Watkins
robert.watkins@mincom.com about my grey broadcast article from a couple
of issues back. I thought that you might like to print it and my
response in the next 'Pouch deposits if you feel it worthy of such an
honor. Incidentally, work on the new newbies guide continues to slowly
but surely progress.
Best,
Tim Miller
original from Robert Watkins
One important point to remember with Grey Press is to ensure that you
don't send out a bunch of press, with different personalities, all at
the same time. Such an act is tantamount to shouting "Hey, these are all
the same person!".
This applies even more to Grey Partial Press. In a newbie game I am
gm'ing, several players are using grey press, and are also sending out
white press (frequently to the same people!). This is making it a fairly
trivial exercise to deduce who is sending the message.
This also raises an interesting tactic, to be used with impersonation.
If you determine that a given personality regularly posts at about the
same time, or regularly posts in conjuction with another personality, an
impersonation attempt will be more successfull if you reproduce those
conditions.
One way to avoid this, of course, is to stagger press delivery. Many
email packages can arrange for delayed delivery of messages, and this
feature would be very useful to many players, I am sure.
And my response
That is a good point you raised. I have actually used the message time
stamps in grey broadcast games to my advantages, but didn't include the
trick in my article. I was playing one grey broadcast game as Austria,
and was dismayed, after the fall 1901 builds, to see three messages,
from Russia, Turkey, and Italy apparently agreeing to attack me.
However, I looked at the timestamps on these messages and found them to
have been mailed about 2 minutes apart. I immeadiatly broadcast this
fact and suggested that the faker try again with a dumber opponent, or
something to that effect.

I looked at the screenshots from your article about Hasbro
interactive Diplomacy.
I noticed that the Italian flag appearing in the pictures is
the one we have nowadays which is different from the flag
Italy had at the times covered by the game.
At those times the flag had the Savoy (royal family) symbol
in the white field of the flag.
I think it could be nice to warn Hasbro about that, to let
them make the correction in the final version of the game.

Gentlemen,
Thanks for your efforts in bringing this information.  Well done.
I have to agree that they have the best job in the world programming computer
games, Diplomacy in particular.  (As a Pediatric Resident, there are times
that I think that serving hotdogs would be better than what I'm doing now.
But those are few and far between.)
Any mention on the computer specifications needed to run this Diplomacy
software?
(I mention with a cringe as my computer is about 4 yrs old and Software now
being produced is starting to be just beyond my ability to run it)

Why Should the Grand Alliance be Formed? is an excellent article. Well done
Roger. It gets down on paper some of the views and methods that I had seen
and employed over the years.
I guess now I have a point of order to raise with the article. Normally I
would agree with "I submit that all players have a duty to the game of
Diplomacy..." however I feel now my views have changed and I see the
statement as a form of altruism to the game itself. I feel more acurately it
should read "... players should have a duty to play the game of Diplomacy
(to the best of their ability)."
I feel now to some extent that the game exists for players to participate to
do their best to win but to allow them to form their own conclusions and for
what ever motives and that should be okay despite the outcome. After all it
is just a game. I certainly have moved away from the thinking that the
players exist for the advancement of the game. I feel that is the wrong way
of looking at it.
As was stated "... to play their position as if real citizens actually
depended on their efforts'', I feel taken in context much of the conflicts
that occur in Dip would not ever occur in reality. Your statement is aimed
to rationalise the need for grand alliances at the end of the game and never
at any other stage during the game. Why? because of the sudden interest to
prevent an arbitrarily defined outcome (ie a solo victory), and this
certainly does not reflect on reality in anyway. I wonder how game play
would differ if the terms for victory was complete domination. I would
presume grand alliances will never form, because there is no motive for them
because its would be near impossible to gain all 34 centers (though it could
be done in principle).
Resons for game play: revenge, loyalty, admiration, apathy. et al. are
certainly based on reality and I feel somewhat that are just as valid
reasons for playing the game than achieving a conclusion like a draw or
solo.
I do not condone bad play, to which I define as players being abusive.
However a player that decides to not take part of a grand alliance should
not be subjected to an inquisition. Whatever their motives, they are equally
as valid as saving a solo victory, and it is not a sign of bad play at all.
If other players don't like it, well tough! Now all of a sudden we see a
situation that makes the game more interesting and the negotiations more
delicate, more cut-throat and much more realistic.
Too often we see the games develop as follows:
Opening->Stab->Mid-Game->Stab->End Game (solo or draw), and when we play
each stage we sometimes pay little or no heed towards subsequent stages in
our negotiations and actions. Therefore we operate a little strategically
blinded at times. Then faced with a scramble at the end of the game to
salvage a favourable conclusion. I conclude that "Grand Alliances" are
necessary at every stage of the game and not just in the end-game. Why?
because we should always arm ourselves at every stage of the game to be
prepared for any eventuality. Grand Alliances should not be expected and not
demanded "just because..." and players should give all due care and respect
to other players because it prepares you for later stages of the game.
I ask you the question: would you partake in a Grand Alliance in a game
where after negotiations for commencing an alliance (to which a condition of
the alliance were to follow the agreed plans), a cheap stab followed by
abusive behaviour being directed at you to be furthered by borish behaviour
because you chose to sit out the alliance and remain neutral. I would think
not! "It is a matter of honor to put the duty to the game over the pull of
the emotions..." does not always apply.
I think there is room for other factors like respectful behaviour, attention
to strategic issues and good negotiations go along way further towards
avoiding solo victories. A grand alliance should never be expected nor
granted.

Okay, I saw your preview of the game. In case anyone wants
to hear my opinion: I love the look of it. I really like the
idea of being able to sit down and play solitaire vs. computer
opponents. Imagine: no one to wait for, no conflicts of
schedules! It won't replace the human games -- in fact,
think it will help. It should be a real nice way to experiment
and learn more about the game. I suspect the pool of players
will actually grow a lot if it appears on store shelves all over
the place. I was very happy to see that the Pouch was getting
mentioned in the boxed literature -- or did I read that wrong?
Now how do I get a copy? Surely Hasbro is dying to hear from
me, Mike Connaghan.
Maybe not.
Seriously, is there any opportunity: ...to become one of the
pre-release testers? ...to get on a waiting list for direct
delivery? ...to get any kind of discount (this I doubt, but
hey, I also doubt it hurts to ask)? ...for people to get
together to get a group discount?(!)
Thanks to you and Simon for those interviews and the preview!
You made my day!
Mike
(still waiting for a solo win! I just don't play enough
-- or maybe not WELL enough!)
P.S. How is the payola Diplomacy working out? I haven't
played it since that one game where you accidentally revealed
your identity to me, and the game subsequently folded...
By the way, I never felt in control in that game! Maybe it
is something you just have to get used to for payola.

Hi Geoff:
Thanks for your kudos.
On the subject of tempo:
In the No-Press game article, I explained that what I'm measuring in those
numbers is the number of steps distant from it's SC of origin each unit is
at that point in time. I actually tried two other methods for measuring
tempi before I settled on that one. My first try was to just count every
successful movement. That turned out to be simply too inaccurate (e.g. if
you credit Italy in the game I published with a tempo for each successful
order, he gets way too much credit for shuffling his units back and forth in
the same place). It also wasn't the way I tended to think of the lesson of
"tempo" from my chess experience.
My next try was to measure tempo as an "ideal", meaning I would only credit
tempi for distance from the nearest home SC (which would "penalize"
backwards builds and minimize the credit a power gets for moving pieces
inside his own borders). This made keeping track of tempo too complex and
subjective for the purposes of a teaching article (though it's probably
closer to the way I look at tempo as I'm examining my own ongoing games).
That's when I hit on the more rigorous forumla for tracking tempo you see in
the article I finally wrote. Since that was my third try at coming up with a
meaningful tempo formula for purposes of teaching and analysis, I added the
disclaimer about it being more art than science. Maybe I also should have
added the traditional YMMV (your mileage may vary) disclaimer too :-)
I don't really want to write a whole article on tempo, so I'll compromise
with you and ask Manus to publish this exchange in the Pouch Deposits
column. In a related matter, watch for an upcoming article from me (not sure
if it will make this issue or not) which subjects the Standard Map to
scrutiny, largely using tempo as a tool of analysis. Seeing this different
practical use of tempo may help to expand on the subject and explain why I
think it is so important.

This does not surprise me.  Buried within the Judge code is the power assignment
subroutine.  This subroutine claims the following:
This procedure uses an ACM algorithm (Algorithm 415) to assign powers to
the
players, according to their preference lists, their order of signing on to
the game, and (unfortunately) the order that the powers are listed in the
power letters list for the variant.
I have never heard of the ACM algorithm (nor met anyone else who has).
Additionally, when I studied the Judge code, I came to the conclusion that although
the order of signing on did effect random number generation, there was NO TRUTH to
the widespread rumor that the first person to signon to the game will get the first
choice on his preference list.  Part of the problem is that the Judge code for
power assignment is unecessarily redundant and not completely efficient.  I suspect
that this subroutine had been copied from someone's code prior to the Judge being
written, which explains some of the rumors and problems.  It would be easy enough
to rewrite this portion of the code, but it clearly is not a high priority at this
time.  As near as I can tell the Judge code method of power assignment is a variant
of Method 1 - Variation C described in my power assignment article.
For those who are interested the Judge code can be downloaded from www.<HELP
MANUS!!  PUT THE CORRECT SITE IN HERE!!>
I hope this helps.

NAME:  assignment
DESCRIPTION
This procedure uses an ACM algorithm (Algorithm 415) to assign powers to the
players, according to their preference lists, their order of signing on to
the game, and (unfortunately) the order that the powers are listed in the
power letters list for the variant.
REVISION HISTORY

----------- ------------ ---------------------------------------------------
?? ??? 1987 K.Lowe       Original development.
21 Mar 1994 C.Marcus,Jr. Restructure as 'normal' C code, and document as
much as possible; slight change made in the logic
for the case n=m, so that excessive reduction of
the initial array isn't done.
INTERFACE DEFINITION
Calling Sequence:
assignment(&a, n, m, &x);
Inputs:
a[][] := Array of preferences:  a[i][j] is the preference assigned by
Player i for Position j (the lower the value, the more Player i
prefers Position j)
n     := The number of Players (= number of rows in array a = number of
entries in array x)
m     := The number of Positions (= number of columns in array a)
Outputs:
x[]   := Positions assigned:  x[i] is the Position assigned to Player i.
a[][]    Values have been trashed during calculations.
ALGORITHM
I'm sorry, go get the ACM's Collected Algorithms if you want to TRY to
understand this.  My comments below are only approximately correct (as
close as I could get to what's going on here).

I accept and am comfortable with the idea that people play for different reasons
and for different goals.  I do not want to start a carebear vs. cut throat
debate :-)  the 'I believe' was meant to state explicitly that it was my opinion
only.  That opinion is that the game is better when everyone tries to win or at
least not lose.  However, I concede that there are many things more important in
life than a game.  Even though I play to win, I am not upset if I lose.  I do my
best, expect others to do so, and extract the most enjoyment I can, no matter
what the outcome.  I think that our opinions are not that different, really.

There are some small stalemate positions on the board.  I do not know them off
the top of my head, but yes, taking all 34 centers may be impossible.  That is
why the game designers probably set the victory condition to 18.   My statement
about playing as if real citizens were involved was aimed at my goals in the
game:#1 prevent my elimination (even if someone else wins)
#2 prevent someone else from winning
#3 attempt to win the game
Of course, I prefer #3, but I do not go only for #3 and sacrifice the others.
I admit that many of my comments in that section took a very black and white
view of things.  I admit that things are typically more grey.  But when I craft
my Diplomacy messages to my fellow players, I typically argue that things are
black or white, which ever is best for me :-)

People all have different opinions.  Mine is that my honor requires that I set
aside revenge, etc. and have a duty to the game to try and prevent someone else
from winning.  Only if I am about to be eliminated will I consider helping
someone win (as my final act).  But that is my belief, not everyone's.

During the game, I will use all my efforts to convince you (or anyone else) that
you are wrong and should join the grand alliance.  After the game, I will
congratulate everyone on a good game, try to understand why you did not join the
alliance.  Politely discuss the point with you and try to learn from it. I agree
that just because someone did not buy into the stop the leader alliance, they
are evil.  They just play differently, and that is fine.

I admit that it would be hard to stick with the alliance after the behavior you
described.  There are always exceptions and I do not mean to claim that it is
everyone's duty to prevent a win at all cost.  I suspect that in this situation
I would try to calm down, and then try to figure out a way that I could put
myself in the position that I could still try to work with the boorish person to
prevent the win.  If he continued his behavior then I would have the option to
throw the game away from him.  My having that power may be what finally causes
him to behave.  If not, then the other person won and they deserved the win.
Please understand that the point of the article was to discuss the idea of
trying to create an alliance to prevent a win between players that have recently
been at each other's throats.  Overcome the feelings of wanting to throw the
game to do what is arguably in one's best interest (i.e. take part in a draw)
was interesting to me and has often been challenging.  The paragraph which
bothers you was added as back ground on why this topic may be useful.
I do appreciate your writing to me.  Our differences in opinion are what make
discussing a topic worth while.  Perhaps one day we will play in a game together
and can explore the idea more completely.  However, I expect that neither of us
would be 'the jerk' that deserved to lose.  I might stab you horrible and make
you think me evil, but I will be polite about it.  :-)

Well, howdy! I've been a big fan of the Pouch ever since a friend first turned me on to it about a year ago, but I have to say, aside from responding to a survey now and again, I've never really coressponded with you guys. So what made me finally do it?
There was an article in the last issue; "What's your Point", I believe it was called. This article just shed a whole world of light on the actions of PBEM opponents I've had  in the past year. It's funny how one shapes his own opinions and style, and then just asumes that is the "natural" way to do things. So, this article let me look at things from a new perspective, and while I dont think you can really classify people into just four categories, it gives great insight into the reasons behind moves you don't understand. I find that it's easier to deal with a guy who commits suicide when he gets down to two centers nowadays. :)
So anyways, the real reason I'm writing. Right now I'm just finishing up a Loeb9 game wherein I play England. Throughout the game, France and Spain have had an alliance, and I've worked completely in conjunction with them, never really feeling threatened by them (I have more centers than the bothe of them), and never feeling the need to threaten them either. Through good-humored press and a little joking around, i've actually come to like these guys, whoever they may be. The strange thing is, this year, the last remaining other player, the Turk, decided to keel over and let me take his centers. Now, I consider myself a Classicist for purposes of your article, but I found myself dissapointed by this, and actyually considering calling a draw, just so that I wouldnt have to take the solo over these guys who have become my "friends". :) What's happened!? Did Pouch-Gremlins somehow get into my head and change me into a social player?! I can't help but think it was your article that!
put these naughty ideas into my subconscious, allowing them to change my style of play.  I can only hope it isn't permanent. :)
So anyways, thanks for all the great Dip stuff. You guys really put out a quality newsletter. I only wish it came more often! ;) I'm looking forward to the changes that come with Hasbro IA's Diplomacy game (thanks a million for that article, too... my mouth actually watered at the screen shots!). Take care guys.

Thanks a lot, Manus! I'm honored that I get a personal response from
you. :) On another subject, I was wondering if you had the system
requirements for the Hasbro Interactive game. I know they would be
really preliminary things and maybe not the same as the finished
product, but I'd like to know if my machine is even in the neighborhood
of being able to run it. :) Thanks a lot for the *great* article on the
game by the way. :)

own opinions and style, and then just asumes that is the "natural" way to do
things. So, this article let me look at things from a new perspective, and
while I dont think you can really classify people into just four categories,
it gives great insight into the reasons behind moves you don't understand. I
find that it's easier to deal with a guy who commits suicide when he gets

This is the most rewarding response to the article that I could have hoped
for. [I've received several letters that read like this actually.] The whole
idea of the article was to increase awareness that there are competing
philosophies underpinning how and why to play the game. That can be taken
advantage of, but only if one, first, recognizes it and, second, cultivates
it as strategy, rather than fighting "wrong" opinons in others.

a Loeb9 game wherein I play England. Throughout the game, France and Spain
have had an alliance, and I've worked completely in conjunction with them,
never really feeling threatened by them (I have more centers than the bothe
of them), and never feeling the need to threaten them either. Through
good-humored press and a little joking around, i've actually come to like
these guys, whoever they may be. The strange thing is, this year, the last
remaining other player, the Turk, decided to keel over and let me take his
centers. Now, I consider myself a Classicist for purposes of your article,

draw, just so that I wouldnt have to take the solo over these guys who have

For Pete's sake...
Come and play in New Zealand, or in Germany.  Ah, why not hell if I plan on going that far.  The point is that there just arent that many diplomacy tournaments in the Midwest.
Sure there may be one in Denver or in Kansas City, but those are far and few in between.  Why can't there ever be tournaments in Omaha NE. (I am from Nebraska by the way)
This letter may not mean a whole lot to a rather large lot of potential players, but to us in the Midwest, this is serious business.
My opinion alone,
-Kurt

Hi Simon.
Thank You for a simply marvellous homepage. We are a group of players
from Denmark who have started to play Diplomacy only 18 months ago, and
the help and inspiration from the Pouch is simply undescribeable.
However, I see a lot of referring to a socalled Players Guide, and I can
get pieces of this work on my screen. Isn't the entire Guide available
as a online ressource? I would be more than delighted to get my hands on
this guide. Can You tell me about the guide, and possible give me a
description on how to download it.
I hope to hear from you soon.
Yours sicerely,
Klaus Bakdal

This is not a bug -- it's a feature!  :-)
Seriously, the fact that the form gets cleared each time you go to it
(even when using the back button) is intentional.  It was set up that
way at the request of judge keepers.  One reason is to make that page
just a little more inconvenient for cheaters to send multiple
registrations.

Actually, due to Manus' magic in setting up the script, the map you saw
was dependent on the IP address of the machine you are on.  Therefore,
if you checked the page two different times from a machine with a static
IP address, you'd have seen the same map.

RE: Article on Grand Alliance
One of the main issues in this article is that it is the goal
of every player to try to stop the winner if you can not win.
I must take exception with this.  I come from the old Win Only
school of play that got some fame in the mid Sixties.  The approach
there was one of either you win or there is another result.  As
such if the game was a 2 way or 7 way draw or someone else won
these were all equal outcomes in the concept of another result.
There is also another common schoold of thought in that if you
did not win then before you turn to stop the winner you should
consider if the win by the other player is such a horrible thing.
The issue of the Grand Alliance is that when players have
stabbed you into the ground, lied to your face/your phone/your
Net-provider, then some how all that goes away in the mad rush
to stop some body on the other side of the board who may have
not done anything to you.  If people know that you are a Grand
Alliance player then will they have less resistance to stab you since
your philosophy is that you will turn on the front runner and
forgive what was done to you.  This sort of predictability is
exactly what you do not want to do in a game where reputations
carry over.
Therefore while the structure of the Grand Alliance article is
very good in describing what to do, the basic essence that it
draws from has a flaw in it for the player.  Therefore use the
Grand Alliance as just one of the possible responses to a growing
power on the other side of the board.
