[For your interest and suitable for a Pouch Deposit.  I found this site
while searching for places to notify about the updated URL for TDP.
Manus,
It looks like The Diplomatic Pouch is appealing to an ever-growing
group of people.  The St. John's University Library thinks that the
Online Resources section at The Pouch is a good resource for people
interested in government and politics.  I couldn't agree more!  It's
listed at:

The Lycos World Wars Guide lists the top rated sites on the topic of
Causes of World War I.  One of the games in The Pouch's Diplomacy
Showcase is listed there!  Unfortunately, we're only rated 50/100.
I'd have thought our web site had a greater impact on the WW I than
that.  Oh well.

This is not for publication yet, since I don't want to count my
chickens...  However, I have been in contact with the Head Librarian
at the Bowling Green State University Popular Culture Library and they
are interested in taking the Hoosier Archives.
This is the best solution for the archives, I believe.  They will be
preserved, stay in one place, and be accessible to Hobbyists as well
as popular culture scholars. (And they'll be out of my basement.  My
fiancee has been looking askance at them for some time....)
I will keep you informed as this opportunity develops.

The Pouch finally broke 1000 queue games.  'Ray!
BTW, did you get a chance to try out the 2x2 pixel reddot.gif?
And one final item, I still haven't submitted the new Pouch URL to the
search engines... waiting for the changes we discussed (changing
"Diplomatic Pouch" in the ALT tags and DP: in the page titles to
"Diplomacy Home Page").  Not a nag, just mentioning it if it had slipped
your mind.

I finally found the DipPouch (old links) and discovered that I
was engrossed in the articles written by Stephen Lepley from the
initial 'zine on 'Insights of a Newbie'.  I sent the message
below to Stephen, but I question if he'll answer (address
change, doesn't care, ?) So I pass it on to the 'Zine and give
y'all a chance to answer.
Stephen,
You seemed to learn a great deal about yourself and human nature
from your experience playing diplomacy.  Your insights on the
powerful emotional destruction that some players suffer after a
stab engrossed me enough to stay awake until 3:00am reading them
on the DipPouch, even though I need to be at work at 8:00am.
I recognize a need to learn more political skill and I believe
that I would learn it playing Diplomacy - but I could see myself
becoming bitter just as you describe if my creation were
destroyed after months of work.
I am 27, have a wife and a child, and a very busy life.  My
question is this - Based on your experience, will the knowlege
and experience I will learn playing Diplomacy PBEM be worth the
price I will pay for it personally/emotionally?
Known for overreacting,
R28738@email.sps.mot.com
P.S. - So this is how Pandora felt!
