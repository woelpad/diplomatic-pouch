<H3>Mail Call</H3>
Before we see what we have in the mailbag, I'm going to try and stimulate
some letters for next issue by putting out a public question.  Long time
readers will know that this is something I used to do at the top of every
Deposits column, but without spectacular results, response-wise.  I might
be setting myself up for failure again, but here's a question that I
discussed recently in an e-mail correspondence.
Maybe I'm the only one who has an answer to it (because
it's kind of a strange question), but I'm curious to find out....
<center><i>
<P>
Do you have a "favorite" border?
</i></center>
<P>
What do I mean?  Well, as you probably know, I serve as GameMaster for quite
a lot of games, and well, over the years I've developed a fondness for a
particular move order (made sometime during the game) sending a unit across a
particular border from one
space on the board to a certain other space.  I just love seeing it.  (It's
not the <i>only</i> move that I truly enjoy seeing, but there is one border I
just love seeing
crossed.)  I won't tell you
which border it is until next issue, because I'm curious if anyone else will
have the same answer.
<P>
So now that you know the crazy question,
<a href="mailto:dippouch@diplom.org?subject=My favorite border">send me your crazy answer</a> (or just
<a href="mailto:dippouch@diplom.org?subject=You're crazy">tell me I'm crazy</a>)
<H3>Okay, On To The Mail</H3>

I finally found the DipPouch and discovered that I
was engrossed in the articles written by Stephen Lepley from the
initial 'zine on 'Insights of a Newbie.'  I sent the message
below to Stephen, and I pass it on to the 'Zine to give everyone
a chance to comment.
<p>Stephen,
<P>
You seemed to learn a great deal about yourself and human nature
from your experience playing Diplomacy.  Your insights on the
powerful emotional destruction that some players suffer after a
stab engrossed me enough to stay awake until 3:00 A.M. reading them
at the DipPouch, even though I need to be at work at 8:00 A.M.
<P>
I recognize a need to learn more political skill and I believe
that I would learn it playing Diplomacy, but I could see myself
becoming bitter just as you describe if my creation were
destroyed after months of work.
<P>
I am 27, have a wife and a child, and a very busy life.  My
question is this: Based on your experience, will the knowlege
and experience I will gain playing Diplomacy by e-mail be worth the
price I will pay for it personally/emotionally?
<P>
(Yes, I'm known for overreacting, but I'm genuinely curious for your
response.)
<P>
P.S. - So this is how Pandora felt!
<blockquote><i><b>
Publisher's response:</b>
I'm hoping others also will write in to respond to you but my own advice is
not to let anything stop you from playing Diplomacy.  Don't be worried
about the emotional toll it will take.  Playing Diplomacy is a good way to
gain <u>control</u> of your emotions.  Just remember one thing:
they're just little blocks of wood (well, nowadays they're just plastic)
and circles of ink.  (If you're playing by e-mail, they're just
little spinning electrons.)  They're really nothing to get upset about,
even if you've invested a couple months trying to collect the little things.
This isn't life and death here.  It's a game.  (Well, okay, it's <u>The</u>
Game, but you get the point.)  You'll soon enough learn to
congratulate your fellow player when he gains himself a circle of ink
at your expense.  He's not really your "enemy" (though we use that term
enough to describe him); he's just another guy doing the same thing you're
doing.  So, to specifically answer your question, you
most definitely profit by playing.  The insights you gain into your own nature,
the nature of your fellow players, and human nature itself are immeasurable.
Learning who to trust and when your trust might be misplaced is a valuable
lesson that can be taught by careful study at the Diplomacy table.
(A lesson that is just as easy -- and, admittedly, even more fun -- to teach
as it is to learn.) Trying to
outwit others while preventing others from outwitting you is the
ultimate test of your concentration, nerves, tact, self-discipline, and
resolve.  All things that are very useful everywhere in life.

Regarding the eye color of Mona Lisa, I have something to say.
As I have visited and left messages on the Web page of Mona Lisa,
I am just likely Mona Lisa herself, and indeed my eye color is also
sometimes "brown" and sometimes "hazel."
<P>
Somehow, their color changes to brown from hazel and back.
For example, if I have makeup on or in cloudy weather, my eyes seem to
be brown.  In sunshine, they are always "hazel."

As a matter of fact, nobody can be sure about the colours.
Better to simply accept, admire, and appreciate Mona Lisa's eyes however

One important point to remember with Grey Press is to ensure that you
don't send out a bunch of press, with different personalities, all at
the same time. Such an act is tantamount to shouting, "Hey, these are all
from the same person!"
<P>
This applies even more to Grey Partial Press. In a newbie game I am
Mastering, several players are using grey press, and are also sending out
white press (frequently to the same people!). This is making it a fairly
trivial exercise to deduce who is sending the message.
<P>
This also raises an interesting tactic, to be used with impersonation.
If you determine that a given personality regularly posts at about the
same time, or regularly posts in conjuction with another personality, an
impersonation attempt will be more successful if you reproduce those
conditions.
<P>
One way to avoid this, of course, is to stagger press delivery. Many
e-mail packages can arrange for delayed delivery of messages, and this
feature would be very useful to many players, I am sure.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
That is a good point you raised. I have actually used the message timestamps
in grey broadcast games to my advantage, but didn't include the
trick in my article. I was playing one grey broadcast game as Austria,
and was dismayed, after the fall 1901 builds, to see three messages,
from Russia, Turkey, and Italy apparently agreeing to attack me.
However, I looked at the timestamps on these messages and found them to
have been mailed about two minutes apart. I immediately broadcast this
fact and suggested that the faker try again with a dumber opponent, or
something to that effect.

I looked at the screenshots from your article about Hasbro

I noticed that the Italian flag appearing in the pictures is
the one we have nowadays, which is different from the flag
Italy had at the years covered by the game.
At those times, the flag had the Savoy (royal family) symbol
in the white field of the flag.

I think it could be nice to warn Hasbro about that, to let
them make the correction in the final version of the game.

Okay, I saw your preview of the game. In case anyone wants
to hear my opinion: I love the look of it. I really like the
idea of being able to sit down and play solitaire vs. computer
opponents. Imagine: no one to wait for, no conflicts of
schedules! It won't replace the human games -- in fact,
think it will help. It should be a real nice way to experiment
and learn more about the game. I suspect the pool of players
will actually grow a lot if it appears on store shelves all over
the place. I was very happy to see that the Pouch was getting
mentioned in the boxed literature -- or did I read that wrong?

From Theo Kermanidis
(<a href=mailto:TKERMANI@baea.com.au>TKERMANI@baea.com.au</a>):
</H4>
Why Should the Grand Alliance be Formed? is an excellent article. Well done
Roger. It gets down on paper some of the views and methods that I had seen
and employed over the years.
I guess now I have a point of order to raise with the article. Normally I
would agree with "I submit that all players have a duty to the game of
Diplomacy..." however I feel now my views have changed and I see the
statement as a form of altruism to the game itself. I feel more acurately it
should read "... players should have a duty to play the game of Diplomacy
(to the best of their ability)."
I feel now to some extent that the game exists for players to participate to
do their best to win but to allow them to form their own conclusions and for
what ever motives and that should be okay despite the outcome. After all it
is just a game. I certainly have moved away from the thinking that the
players exist for the advancement of the game. I feel that is the wrong way
of looking at it.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
I accept and am comfortable with the idea that people play for different reasons
and for different goals.  I do not want to start a carebear vs. cut throat
debate --  the 'I believe' was meant to state explicitly that it was my opinion
only.  That opinion is that the game is better when everyone tries to win or at
least not lose.  However, I concede that there are many things more important in
life than a game.  Even though I play to win, I am not upset if I lose.  I do my
best, expect others to do so, and extract the most enjoyment I can, no matter
what the outcome.  I think that our opinions are not that different, really.
</i></blockquote>
As was stated "... to play their position as if real citizens actually
depended on their efforts'', I feel taken in context much of the conflicts
that occur in Dip would not ever occur in reality. Your statement is aimed
to rationalise the need for grand alliances at the end of the game and never
at any other stage during the game. Why? because of the sudden interest to
prevent an arbitrarily defined outcome (ie a solo victory), and this
certainly does not reflect on reality in anyway. I wonder how game play
would differ if the terms for victory was complete domination. I would
presume grand alliances will never form, because there is no motive for them
because its would be near impossible to gain all 34 centers (though it could
be done in principle).
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
There are some small stalemate positions on the board.  I do not know them off
the top of my head, but yes, taking all 34 centers may be impossible.  That is
why the game designers probably set the victory condition to 18.   My statement
about playing as if real citizens were involved was aimed at my goals in the
game:#1 prevent my elimination (even if someone else wins)
#2 prevent someone else from winning
#3 attempt to win the game
<p>
Of course, I prefer #3, but I do not go only for #3 and sacrifice the others.
<P>
I admit that many of my comments in that section took a very black and white
view of things.  I admit that things are typically more grey.  But when I craft
my Diplomacy messages to my fellow players, I typically argue that things are
black or white, which ever is best for me :-)
</i></blockquote>
Resons for game play: revenge, loyalty, admiration, apathy. et al. are
certainly based on reality and I feel somewhat that are just as valid
reasons for playing the game than achieving a conclusion like a draw or
solo.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
People all have different opinions.  Mine is that my honor requires that I set
aside revenge, etc. and have a duty to the game to try and prevent someone else
from winning.  Only if I am about to be eliminated will I consider helping
someone win (as my final act).  But that is my belief, not everyone's.
</i></blockquote>
I do not condone bad play, to which I define as players being abusive.
However a player that decides to not take part of a grand alliance should
not be subjected to an inquisition.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
During the game, I will use all my efforts to convince you (or anyone else) that
you are wrong and should join the grand alliance.  After the game, I will
congratulate everyone on a good game, try to understand why you did not join the
alliance.  Politely discuss the point with you and try to learn from it. I agree
that just because someone did not buy into the stop the leader alliance, they
are evil.  They just play differently, and that is fine.
</i></blockquote>
Whatever their motives, they are equally
as valid as saving a solo victory, and it is not a sign of bad play at all.
If other players don't like it, well tough! Now all of a sudden we see a
situation that makes the game more interesting and the negotiations more
delicate, more cut-throat and much more realistic.
<P>
Too often we see the games develop as follows:
Opening/Stab/Mid-Game/Stab/End Game (solo or draw), and when we play
each stage we sometimes pay little or no heed towards subsequent stages in
our negotiations and actions. Therefore we operate a little strategically
blinded at times. Then faced with a scramble at the end of the game to
salvage a favourable conclusion. I conclude that "Grand Alliances" are
necessary at every stage of the game and not just in the end-game. Why?
because we should always arm ourselves at every stage of the game to be
prepared for any eventuality. Grand Alliances should not be expected and not
demanded "just because..." and players should give all due care and respect
to other players because it prepares you for later stages of the game.
I ask you the question: would you partake in a Grand Alliance in a game
where after negotiations for commencing an alliance (to which a condition of
the alliance were to follow the agreed plans), a cheap stab followed by
abusive behaviour being directed at you to be furthered by borish behaviour
because you chose to sit out the alliance and remain neutral. I would think
not! "It is a matter of honor to put the duty to the game over the pull of
the emotions..." does not always apply.
I think there is room for other factors like respectful behaviour, attention
to strategic issues and good negotiations go along way further towards
avoiding solo victories. A grand alliance should never be expected nor
granted.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
I admit that it would be hard to stick with the alliance after the behavior you
described.  There are always exceptions and I do not mean to claim that it is
everyone's duty to prevent a win at all cost.  I suspect that in this situation
I would try to calm down, and then try to figure out a way that I could put
myself in the position that I could still try to work with the boorish person to
prevent the win.  If he continued his behavior then I would have the option to
throw the game away from him.  My having that power may be what finally causes
him to behave.  If not, then the other person won and they deserved the win.
<P>
Please understand that the point of the article was to discuss the idea of
trying to create an alliance to prevent a win between players that have recently
been at each other's throats.  Overcome the feelings of wanting to throw the
game to do what is arguably in one's best interest (i.e. take part in a draw)
was interesting to me and has often been challenging.  The paragraph which
bothers you was added as back ground on why this topic may be useful.
<P>
I do appreciate your writing to me.  Our differences in opinion are what make
discussing a topic worth while.  Perhaps one day we will play in a game together
and can explore the idea more completely.  However, I expect that neither of us
would be 'the jerk' that deserved to lose.  I might stab you horribly and make
you think me evil, but I will be polite about it.  <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>

Thanks for both reading the article and taking the time to respond!

(<a href=mailto:Edi@mgames.com>Edi@mgames.com</a>):

One of the main issues in this article is that it is the goal
of every player to try to stop the winner if you can not win.
I must take exception with this.  I come from the old Win Only
school of play that got some fame in the mid Sixties.  The approach
there was one of either you win or there is another result.  As
such if the game was a two-way or seven-way draw or someone else won
these were all equal outcomes in the concept of another result.
<P>
There is also another common schools of thought in that if you
did not win then before you turn to stop the winner you should
consider if the win by the other player is such a horrible thing.
<P>
The issue of the Grand Alliance is that when players have
stabbed you into the ground, lied to your face/your phone/your
Net-provider, then somehow all that goes away in the mad rush
to stop some body on the other side of the board who may have
not done anything to you.  If people know that you are a Grand
Alliance player then will they have less resistance to stab you since
your philosophy is that you will turn on the front-runner and
forgive what was done to you.  This sort of predictability is
exactly what you do not want to do in a game where reputations
carry over.
<P>
Therefore, while the structure of the Grand Alliance article is
very good in describing what to do, the basic essence that it
draws from has a flaw in it for the player.  Players should use the
Grand Alliance as just one of the possible responses to a growing
power on the other side of the board.

I would like to thank you for your Dip Pouch articles; both your earlier
article on force/space/time, and the recent article dissecting a no-press
game, have been extremely entertaining and helpful. In trying to analyze
games of my own using the concept of tempi, however, I have noticed myself
second-guessing the technique you use to calculate tempi numbers. While I
understand that this is an art and not a science, an article explaining
how you come up with those numbers (perhaps using the same no-press game
as
an example) would be very helpful, and at least by me, very well received!
<blockquote><i><b>
Author's response:</b>
Thanks for your kudos.
<P>
On the subject of tempo:
In the No-Press game article, I explained that what I'm measuring in those
numbers is the number of steps distant from it's SC of origin each unit is
at that point in time. I actually tried two other methods for measuring
tempi before I settled on that one. My first try was to just count every
successful movement. That turned out to be simply too inaccurate (e.g. if
you credit Italy in the game I published with a tempo for each successful
order, he gets way too much credit for shuffling his units back and forth in
the same place). It also wasn't the way I tended to think of the lesson of
"tempo" from my chess experience.
<P>
My next try was to measure tempo as an "ideal," meaning I would only credit
tempi for distance from the nearest home SC (which would "penalize"
backwards builds and minimize the credit a power gets for moving pieces
inside his own borders). This made keeping track of tempo too complex and
subjective for the purposes of a teaching article (though it's probably
closer to the way I look at tempo as I'm examining my own ongoing games).
<P>
That's when I hit on the more rigorous forumla for tracking tempo you see in
the article I finally wrote. Since that was my third try at coming up with a
meaningful tempo formula for purposes of teaching and analysis, I added the
disclaimer about it being more art than science. Maybe I also should have
added the traditional YMMV (your mileage may vary) disclaimer too :-)
<P>
I don't really want to write a whole article on tempo, so I'll compromise
with you and ask Manus to publish this exchange in the Pouch Deposits
column. In a related matter, watch for an upcoming article from me
[slated for the W1999A issue -Ed.]
which subjects the Standard Map to
scrutiny, largely using tempo as a tool of analysis. Seeing this different
practical use of tempo may help to expand on the subject and explain why I
think it is so important.

I recently signed onto a game (I was the first to do so) and didn't get the

examined the code?  Is it possible for me to take a look at the code? (where
could I find it... do you have it yourself?)
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
This does not surprise me.  Buried within the Judge code is the power assignment
subroutine.  This subroutine claims the following:
"This procedure uses an ACM algorithm (Algorithm 415) to assign powers to
the players, according to their preference lists, their order of signing on to
the game, and (unfortunately) the order that the powers are listed in the
power letters list for the variant."
<P>
I have never heard of the ACM algorithm (nor met anyone else who has).
Additionally, when I studied the Judge code, I came to the conclusion that although
the order of signing on did effect random number generation, there was
<u>no truth</u> to
the widespread rumor that the first person to <tt>SIGNON</tt> to the game will
get the first
choice on his preference list.  Part of the problem is that the Judge code for
power assignment is unecessarily redundant and not completely efficient.  I suspect
that this subroutine had been copied from someone's code prior to the Judge being
written, which explains some of the rumors and problems.  It would be easy enough
to rewrite this portion of the code, but it clearly is not a high priority at this
time.  As near as I can tell the Judge code method of power assignment is a variant
of Method 1, Variation C described in my power assignment article.

Throughout the game, France and Spain have had an alliance, and I've worked completely in conjunction with them, never really feeling threatened by them (I have more centers than the both of them), and never feeling the need to threaten them either. Through good-humored press and a little joking around, I've actually come to like these guys, whoever they may be. The strange thing is, this year, the last remaining other player, the Turk, decided to keel over and let me take his centers. Now, I consider myself a Classicist for purposes of your article, but I found myself disappointed by this, and actually considered calling a draw, just so that I wouldn't have to take the solo over these guys who have become my "friends." <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif> What's happened!? Did Pouch-Gremlins somehow get into my head and change me into a social player?! I can't help but think it was your article that
put these naughty ideas into my subconscious, allowing them to change my style of play.  I can only hope it isn't permanent. <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>

Face to Face Tournament Scheduling

For Pete's sake...
<P>
You publish all sorts of articles saying come and play in New Zealand, or in
Sweden.  Ah, why not? If I plan on going that far.  My point is that there
just aren't that many Diplomacy tournaments in the Midwest U.S.
Sure, there may be one in Denver or in Kansas City, but those are far and few in between.  Why can't there ever be tournaments in Omaha, Nebraska. (I am from Nebraska by the way -- could you tell?)
<P>
This letter may not mean a whole lot to a rather large lot of potential players, but to us in the Midwest, this is serious business.
<blockquote><i><b>Publisher's response:</b>
I'm sure the established face-to-face hobby would love to come to Omaha
and hold a North American or World Championship.  But that won't happen
until Omaha area players organize and create a tournament scene to host
it.  Everything
starts locally.  Get your local hobby established to the point of feeling
ready to invite the world in.
<P>
As a Denver resident myself, I'm not just
talking out of one side of my mouth.  I have taken it on myself to join
with other local players out here to begin to form the Association of
Rocky Mountain Area Diplomacy Adversaries (ARMADA).  Yes, there are Diplomacy
tournaments in our area, but we're looking to get them under the ARMADA
banner and get the local Diplomacy community organized to the point of being
able to host a DipCon or World DipCon.
<p>
Other U.S. regions have organized hobbies (the Carolina Amateur Diplomats
and their DixieCon, and the Dragonflight crowd up in Seattle cover the
south and the Northwest, for example) and we Rocky Mountaineers are hoping to
join them.  But nothing will happen locally unless local players organize it.

I've been too busy to write to you until now to
suggest that your paranoia  experiment may have been a success after all.  In
my case, I set up the position on a real board before analyzing it.
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
Ahh, now that problem is one I didn't consider.
</i></blockquote>
I even went out
of the page and back in, so even if there was any influence, there's a
50-50 chance I was seeing a different board than the one I saw the first
time (and ignoring it since I was already done).
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
Actually, due to Manus' magic in setting up the script, the map you saw
was dependent on the IP address of the machine you are on.  Therefore,
if you checked the page two different times from a machine with a static
IP address, you'd have seen the same map.

Thank you for a simply marvellous homepage. We are a group of players

the help and inspiration from The Pouch is simply indescribeable.

It looks like The Diplomatic Pouch is appealing to an ever-growing
group of people.  The St. John's University Library thinks that the
Online Resources section at The Pouch is a good resource for people
interested in government and politics.  I couldn't agree more!  It's
listed at:
<a href=http://wwwsju.stjohns.edu/library/staugustine/GovernmentAndPoliticsTOC.html>http://wwwsju.stjohns.edu/library/staugustine/GovernmentAndPoliticsTOC.html</a>
<blockquote><i><b>
Publisher's response:</b>  Hmmm.  I checked the site and I don't
understand something.... Why are they listing all those other sites
too?  <img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>
</i></blockquote>
Also, the Lycos World Wars Guide lists the top rated sites on the topic of
Causes of World War I.  One of the games in The Pouch's Diplomacy
Showcase is listed there!  Unfortunately, we're only rated 50/100.
I'd have thought The Pouch had a greater impact on WWI than
that.  Oh well.
<blockquote><i><b>
Publisher's response:</b>  50/100?  Sheesh!  I suppose there's no accounting for
taste.
