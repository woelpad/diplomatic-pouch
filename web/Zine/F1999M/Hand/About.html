Who <i>wouldn't</i> want to have a Diplomatic Pouch T-Shirt?  Or a mousepad?
Or a sweatshirt?  Well, they're now available.  Just <font color=red><b>head for
<a href=/shirts><font color=red>the order form</font></a></b></font> (I mean it -- you can thank me later)
and you'll be able to get yourself all
decked out!
<P>
The merchandise is being Hand-made (by me and my wife), so the price has no
allowances for middlemen.  The cost of this stuff is extremely reasonable,
for one very good reason:  I want everyone in the Diplomacy hobby to have
a closet full of Pouch attire.
<P>
And when you see the stuff, you'll want a closet full too.  Because it's
<i><b>nice</b></i> stuff!  I mean, <i>real</i> nice!  Some of you
have already ordered and received your gear, so you know what I mean.
This is professional quality stuff.  It's not just a cheap-o iron-on,
flake-off-when-you-wash-it deal.  I'm not kidding; this is
top-notch.
<P>
I've designed some shirts for you to choose from (take a look at the order
form page), but feel free to send in a custom design as well.  Not that my
designs aren't great (they are!) but you may have an
inside Diplomacy
joke you want expressed, or a favorite move you want shown.  Immortalize
your favorite winning stab by e-mailing a map of that Fall move you'll
never forget.  If my excellent designs aren't exactly what you're after,
your own design certainly is, so send it to me.
<P>
Either way, we'll make you a walking
billboard for the Diplomacy hobby.
<H3>Section News</H3>
A couple of the Pouch sections have seen some movement since the last issue.
Matt Shields has joined Tim Richardson in the Face-to-Face section, and has
taken on the responsibility of coordinating publication of rankings for the
face-to-face community.  In North America, results are fed to The Pouch
through Buz Eddy's American Diplomacy Ratings, and Buz has been working
with Matt to get everything the North American player needs.
<P>
If you're outside North America, be sure to make Matt aware, if he's not
already, of your own local, national, and continental results and rankings.
<P>
There has also been a resurgence of talk about doing the "o" word to the
North American hobby.  I know there's a bunch of anti-organization folk
out there, but I don't <i>think</i> I'm talking about anything too scary.  Just
establishing a communication focal point for the various local and regional
tournament scenes, to allow them to work together in some kind of affiliation.
<P>
The Diplomatic Corps is currently being organized world-wide
with just that idea of provding a network of players
and tournament directors who can demonstrate the game to new players
and direct players to local games. It will also
provide a focus for prize support from Hasbro and others as well as
use membership fees to help players at regional and
the World Dipcon.  For more information <a href=mailto:edi@mgames.com>contact
Edi Birsan</a>.

Anyone interested in helping with any effort, or to make the North American
face-to-face hobby aware of your little corner of the Dip world, get in
touch with me and I'll get you in touch.

<P>
Elsewhere around The Pouch, the Postal Section's new leader, Stephen Agar, has
ambitious plans for a major rehaul and conversion.  We're all looking forward
to it here, and we think it will provide even better, more organized service
to the hobby.  The
Showcase has grown by a game or two (and is always looking for more) and I've
been informed that there will also be some extensive additions to the E-Mail
section, especially to support the non-judge players out there.
<H3>A Couple of Little Things...</H3>
<ol>
<li>Between the last issue and this one, the Pouch's game queues broke 1000
games started!
<P>
<li>I read in the news that 6% of Internet users suffer from some form of
addiction to it.  The worst thing about this is that it means 94% of the
people online haven't yet discovered Diplomacy and The Pouch.  Come on,
people -- let's get those numbers up!
</ol>
<H3>If You Build It, They Will Come...</H3>
This will probably be the last issue of The Pouch to hit the Web before
Hasbro Interactive's Diplomacy product hits the shelves, with The Pouch,
as the official home page of the hobby, mentioned in the in-box literature.
Which means that this may be the first issue of The Pouch Zine to be read
by the hordes of new players that we all hope will join us.
<P>
So, for those reading this <i>before</i> the influx of new blood, I will just
say that we already have a tremendous worldwide hobby here.  For a community of
backstabbing, conniving knaves, you sure are nice people.
I'm sure I don't need to exhort you to help the new players and show them
how strong a hobby they are joining.  It will just happen.
<P>
And for those of you reading this <i>after</i> the new blood hits the
water, first of all, welcome to the Diplomacy hobby!  We here at The
Diplomatic Pouch are here to help you with whatever questions and needs
you may have.
Just roam The Pouch to see what is here for you.  Join the
<a href=../../../Face>face-to-face</a> crowd by playing with a local club or
organization or joining or getting up an informal game.  Attend the
regional, Continental and World Championships tournaments as they happen.
Subscribe to and play games in any number of the e-mail and snail-mail 'zines
that your fellow hobbyists produce.  Join the huge play-by-email and
play-by-Web communities.  And finally, because I'm famous for this....
<P>
Get involved!  (Now, here comes the part I'm famous for....)
<P>
In fact, one of the easiest ways to get involved is by submitting articles
for publication in the next issue of The Pouch Zine.

<H3>On Issue Promptness and Thickness</H3>
Late again.  Sorry, everyone.  And, if you look at the collection of
articles, you'd wonder <i>why</i> this issue is late (because it's not
an especially large collection).
<P>
In addition to editing after the deadline, I spent a lot of time trying
to wring articles out of people, once I realized that this issue wouldn't
be as thick as previous Fall Movement issues.  Traditionally (I believe),
the Fall Movement phase is one of the largest issues of
the year.  Not this one, though.  Let's see some more contribution, folks!
<P>
I know, part of the fault lies with me for using up my whole
stockpile of articles in the last issue.  And you won't see an article
by me in this issue either (though I have a good Diplomatic excuse, as
you'll read about in the next issue).  But really, it's up to the readership
(that's you) to get articles to me.
<P>
The next issue is due to be "Weblished" (I coined that word,
<!-- on 24 Sep 1999 --> so if it catches on, I get the credit) on
31 October.  That's pretty soon, so get on the stick.
<H3>What We Do Have</H3>
This issue might be a bit lighter than previous Fall Movement issues, but
not for lack of quality.  You'll find articles on two variants (Crystal
Ball and the first in a series on Machiavelli), and a continuation of
David Hertzman's game theory discussion.  David Cohen brings some ancient
words to the modern Diplomat, and John Quarto-vonTivadar tells us about
a couple recent tournaments.  Eric Pederson takes on the Conan Doyle
inheritance by laying out a murder mystery for Holmes that can only
be solved using some lovely retrograde analysis of a Diplomacy position,
and Simon Szykman gives us a further update on his "risk-taking" experiment.
<H3>What's On Tap For Next Issue</H3>
Not much, if I don't get some articles from the readership.  As it stands,
I have one article for the next issue.  Paul Windsor, whose Caissic analysis
of a no-press game concludes this issue, has submitted an excellent article
on the game map that is slated for F1999R.  Apart from that, nothing.
<P>
However, there are grand plans for F1999R.  As a small group of you know,
I have spent a lot of time recently on a hobby project that I plan to unveil
with an article next issue.  John Quarto-vonTivadar has requested space in
F1999R <i>[now pushed on John's request to a future issue -Ed.]</i> for a
similar and related announcement.  Simon and I will go toe-to-toe
debating a question of overwhelming importance that really no one cares about
(except us Diplomats, and that's all that counts, anyway).
<!--
And of course,
the Fall Retreat issue means that it's time for another collection of
slightly-altered holiday songs....
-->
<P>
So I started out saying that not much is on tap, then I followed with a
paragraph listing a whole lot of stuff planned for the next issue.
Which is it?  It's both, which means there is no reason not to send in an
article.  (There never is such a reason, in fact.)  Please do!
<H3>Speaking of Paul Windsor</H3>
Everyone's favorite Caissic Analyst reported that his ability to contribute
his high-quality articles is currently somewhat diminished due to the fact that
his wife recently suffered a mild coronary embolism.  Obviously, Paul is
devoting the bulk of his time to caring for her.  The good news is that she is
recovering very well, and there is no major cause for concern, but the
thoughts of the hobby worldwide are with Paul and his wife.
<H3>On With the Show</H3>
That's about all I have, so feel free and encouraged to devour the
rest of the articles.
<H3>Enjoy The Pouch!</H3>
