<H1 align=center>Updated Results of the "Risk-Taking" Experiment </H1>
<H3 align=center><i>By Simon Szykman</i></h3>
In the <a href=/Zine/S1999R>Spring 1999 Issue</a> of the Zine, I
wrote an article which described the
<a href=/Zine/S1999R/Szykman/Experiment.html>results of an
experiment</a> that I had
done on the effect of unit orientation on perception and assessment
of a situation.  I received a fair amount of email about the
experiment, so I put together what amounts to a special edition of
the Pouch Deposits column that includes the comments I received and my
responses.  Anyone who is interested can find that discussion
<a href=deposits.html>here</a>.
<p>
The experiment had a number of weaknesses, some of which I discussed
in my previous article and others of which are discussed in the
e-mail messages and replies that I just mentioned.  Most of these weaknesses
were things
that I couldn't do anything about after the fact.  One, however,
was something I could try to address by re-analyzing the data.
To quote from my my previous article: <i>I don't think my scenario
was a great one. I think it was a bit too heavily slanted to suggest
that Turkey was the target, regardless of which map you were looking at.
(This is not pure speculation, but is something that is also supported
by the data.)</i><p>
<p>
You can reread my <a href=/Zine/S1999R/Szykman/Experiment.html>previous
article</a> for a better description of this problem, but basically,
it had to do with the fact that the analysis implicitly assumed that
the scenario I presented was balanced.  That is, it assumed that France and
Turkey were roughly equally likely Italian
targets, and therefore that the results of a calculation I did would be
either positive or negative if France or Turkey was the target.  What
I didn't consider was the fact that an unbalance in the scenario
would mean that more people would think Turkey was a target, regardless
of which of the two maps they saw.  This had the effect of shifting the true
center of peoples' opinion away from zero.  Thus, instead of drawing a line
based on whether the result of that calculation was less than or
greater than zero, I should really have drawn a line based on whether
the result was less than or greater than <i>x</i>, where <i>x</i> was a
number offset from zero.
<p>
As indicated in my quote from my previous article, I thought the data
seemed to support the idea that the scenario was biased to indicate
that Turkey was a more likely target.  It turns out that this was
true.  If the scenario had been balanced, I would have expected more
people to think France was the target when units were pointed towards
France, and more people to think Turkey was the target when units were
pointed towards Turkey.  As it turns out, more people thought Turkey
was the target regardless of which map they saw.
<p>
But interestingly, the effect I had originally
hypothesized is there at a gross level.  Even though the average response
indicated that Turkey was a target regardless of which map was seen, the
ratings (on a scale from 1 to 5) showed that people more strongly thought
that Turkey was a target when units were pointed towards Turkey, and
more weakly when units were pointed towards France.  Reexamining the
data showed that the difference in average response between the two maps
was over a fifth of a point.
<p>
So if the scenario had been balanced, that fifth of a point difference
would have been centered about zero, with one tenth of a point below
the zero mark (negative) and one tenth above (positive).  However, the
actual center was a bit under 0.2, so that one tenth of a point in either
direction still left you on the positive side.  (I'm talking average
scores here... individual responses could and did go to the negative side).
One way to correct for the data would be to take into account this offset
by looking for values above and below that number a bit less than 0.2,
instead of above and below zero.
<p>
Vindication for my hypothesis?  Not quite.  I didn't go and generate new
graphs with the correction I described, because what that's really
doing is adding an offset.  In other words, every bar in all the graphs
would be shifted by an amount a bit less than 0.2.  These corrected
charts would better support my hypothesis than did my original ones,
but they would not unquestionably prove my hypothesis.  Though better,
they would not be conclusive.  I believe this to be primarly due to
weaknesses in the experimental design and execution, but I cannot say
with certainty that the reason is that, rather than the possibility that
my hypothesis simply was incorrect.
<p>
It would certainly be interesting to
have the resources (time, subjects) to conduct a better-designed,
non-electronic experiment under more controlled conditions.  Perhaps
I'll submit a grant proposal to the National Institute of Mental Health
under the guise of trying to understand paranoid people... a title
along the lines of "The Emergence of Paranoia as a Survival Trait
in a Small Highly Competitive Population."  Thanks for taking an
interest in my mental ruminations.
