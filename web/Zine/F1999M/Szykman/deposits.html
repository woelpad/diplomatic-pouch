I read your experiment article and liked it a lot!  I found it most
interesting that the expert players were most affected by the unit
positions.  And -- what do you know? -- the most expert players are
those who attend World DipCon and other face-to-face conventions,
and who probably have the most experience with FTF games.  I would
imagine that exclusive PBEM'ers (the bulk of respondents, perhaps?),
have much less experience with seeing units oriented differently (or
even differently orientABLE) on the board.
<p>
<i>An interesting point.  If you assume that the original premise
that orientation would subconsciously affect a person's assessment
of the board is correct (something that has by no means been firmly
established as being true), the next question would be whether people
with FTF experience are more likely to be biased by orientation than
others.  Had I asked a question to establish the level of FTF experience,
I'd be able to compare people with much FTF experience vs. those with
little to none to see if there's a difference in the level of bias.
Alas, I didn't ask that, so the data is not there.

Hello Simon:
<p>
I was intrigued by the thought underlying your deceptive little survey.
On a gut level, I would tend to agree with you that one can affect
person's perceptions by orienting units on the physical board. I think
there are a number of reasons, though, why your online experiment proved
inconclusive.
<p>
Some of those reasons you covered yourself: a too-small sample size; a
potentially imbalanced scenario; and a post hoc realization that the
answers didn't give you the data that you really wanted. I would add a
couple more issues. First, that you just can't achieve the same effect
with an electronic map that you can with the physical board; second,
that the "cover story" might have affected results; and, third, that
it's extremely difficult to account for and filter out preconceived
notions about the game from players.
<p>
<i>I agree with all your points.  It would certainly be interesting to
have the resources (time, subjects) to conduct a better-designed,
non-electronic experiment under more controlled conditions.
</i>
<p>
On the first point, I can remember back to my old, casual FTF days, when
players would snipe at the GM as he adjudicated the board. My younger
brother, especially, was big on physically "re-centering" pieces in
provinces and accusing the GM or other players of trying to manipulate
pieces to create precisely the kinds of perceptions you are talking
about. Manus' 3D artwork just isn't the same thing as fiddling with the
pieces so that they hang (ever so slightly) over borders into the other
guy's provinces and letting that perception sink in. The effect was far
more subtle and, I'm guessing, less perceptable.
<p>
<i>The sub-optimal artwork was of my doing, so Manus is not
responsible.  But I agree.  The other problem for many people is
the fact that on small monitors, you don't see the entire board at
once without scrolling, and the biasing effect probably loses something
when you aren't seeing the big picture laid out at once.</i>
<p>
On the second point, I'm one who didn't answer the survey at all.
Basically, it was because I didn't agree that this was the "right" way
to measure risk-taking behavior. <i>[Elaboration deleted]</i>
Since I couldn't bring
myself to view the questions in those terms, I passed on replying to
them. I wonder how many people thought like I did (more or less), but
answered the survey anyway. [Of course, I have no idea which map I
saw--heh.]
<p><i>
Yeah, the entire scenario was a bit contrived.  Had I had more time
to invest, I would have tried to come up with something better.  (Better
maps, a better fake-risk-taking-experiment and better questions for getting
good data for the real experiment.
</i><p>
On the final point, I would remark that, in addition to a certain bias
in the position towards the potential for IT conflict, you were also
(silently) inviting the respondents to indulge their preconcieved
notions about Italy's relations with it's neighbors. If you conducted
another survey and the questions was "Italy and Turkey make good allies,
in your experience--true or false?", I daresay you would get a flood of
"False" answers, especially from players who classify themselves as less
than expert. <i>[More elaboration deleted]</i>
<p><i>Another good point.</i><p>
I think that someone could do the world a favor by writing a Dip Pouch
article that addressed some of the "conventional wisdom" out there
regarding who should ally with who and why. It's really quite maddening
to, time and again, run accross players who seem to be adopting
somebody's "how to" article as their play by play manual for playing a
power in a game.
<p><i>I'll talk to Manus and see if he can get that Cassia guy to
write such an article. :-)</i><p>
That's enough carping for one letter. I did like your anecdote and will
repeat that I think you are right about the ability to sneak this kind
of perception into FTF play. Your survey was a valiant attempt to define
the truth of that, but I think it defined other--more persistent--truths
about "perceptions" and this game. Still, I think *that* was a valuable
exercise, too.
<p><i>Thanks for the kind words, and the overall feedback as well.</i><p>

(<a href=mailto:wolf@oxy.edu>wolf@oxy.edu</a>)</b></center>
<p>
I wasn't involved in your original survey (nor did I even get around to
looking at it until the article), but a possible hypothesis on your "interpert"
statistics would be this:
<p>
It takes real brass to declare oneself a Diplomacy "expert", and nine times
out of ten I would say doing so is a result of overinflated self-opinion rather
than actual mastery. It could be said that true masters don't feel the need
to broadcast the fact, and/or are always striving to better themselves and
recognize that they don't know everything there is to know.
<i>[Elaboration deleted]</i>
<p>
Your survey was anonymous, but I think the idea holds. You added two
new levels, "novediate" and "interpert." Now if a true expert is adhering
to Sun Tzu's ideals of humility, he still won't declare himself an expert.
<i>[More elaboration deleted]</i>
<p>
Why's that so big an issue? The man with ego enough to declare "Expert" is
quite possibly self-centered and thus handicaps himself and his nation with not
looking at the whole board... to his mind only the immediate surroundings
concern him. The Interperts (if they are indeed the true "expert" category
as I theorize) are savvy enough to discount surface obfuscations and look
at the big picture and the long term goal. They will play as if their opponents
are the same way, until and unless the opponents prove themselves irredeemably
incompetent.<i>[More elaboration deleted]</i>
<p>
<i>Overall, a valid point.  Of course, the issue you bring up only makes a
difference if the biasing effect I hypothesized varies with different skill
levels.  Originally, I hadn't expected it to necessarily be so.  And given
the point you make, even given the differences across skill levels, it's
hard to know if the differences are meaningful because it's hard to know
whether the skill levels people answered with are truly their real skill
levels.  I was aware of that difficulty ahead of time, but I had no way to
assess true skill levels, so the best I could do was to ask and go with
the given answers.  But I don't disagree with you at all.

Dear Simon,
<p>
As a statistician, I was very interested in your survey analysis.
<p>
<i>
Oh oh.  I'm in trouble.
</i>
<p>
Yet in my
opinion, it has not been done in very protocolar ways.
Whatever the way you ask the question or reorganise the data, the main
thing to do is test (statistically) for any difference between groups.
<i>[Elaboration deleted]</i>
<p>
Then, you can also test for association (I wouldn't use correlations with
such category data; even the scale responses are not clearly measurable, as
you noticed yourself.) You tested correlation between the two latest
groupings, but it is their association with Map that would prove the most
interesting.
<p>
One important aspect of your statistical analysis, which you seem to
totally overlook, is the fact that people were asked to enter their own
expertise and playstyle levels. As such, these are ALSO perceptions.
<i>[More elaboration deleted]</i>
<p>
<i>Yes, as I said in one of my above responses, that was the best I
could do given the resources I had.  But I agree.</i>
<p>
It may also be that the particular way in which map 1 and map 2 differ is
not the one that yields more insight. I, for one, when looking at your two
maps, was not sure which one was intended to be felt as "pointed towards
France." Definitely, I am more sensitive to the shape the units form on a
larger scale, like you said with the "arrow." Maybe other people are
influenced by other things. There is ground for further analysis. I am not
saying this is hopeless, on the contrary.
<p>
Would it be possible to look on the raw data? Would you want me to run some
basic tests?
<p><i>I'd gladly send you the raw data.  If anyone else is interested,
just let me know.  I'm the first to admit that I only know enough about
statistical analysis to hurt myself.</i>

Dear Simon,
<p>
I enjoyed your article concerning the unit orientations, especially
since I was one of your victims. Your perfect setting up of two test
groups gives your experiment a lot of credibility, even in the face of
your reluctance to make definitive conclusions based on your results.
<p>
It seems pretty obvious from both your method and your email address
that you have a good bit of experience in research methodology
<p>
<i>
Well, my method was far from scientific, and my experiment far from
controlled, so don't put too much weight on it.  My email address,
doesn't imply that I know anything about statistics.  I assume I know
much more about statistics than the average person, but far less than
most people who have a strong background or expertise in the area of
statistics.
</i>
<p>
I am curious if you ran any Chi-squares or t-tests on your data.
There is a computer program out that i recently used for one of my grad
classes that takes care of all that type of work for you, it is called
the SPSS( i think it is an acronym for "statistical program for social
sciences" but dont hold me to that), and would take a while to key the
info in, but once you have that done, you could run alot of stuff with
it, despite not having that many variables(questions asked).
<p>
<i>
Nope.  I am quite aware of the fact that much more could be done with
data than what I did, but I haven't done anything more sophisticated
than what I described.
</i>
<p>
Anyways, I just wanted to express my appreciation for your type of
article as it gives credence to those of us who must defend to our
wives, family and friends that we are doing more than "just playing a
game" and are exercising our minds and imaginations for the challenges
and obstacles that the world will place before us in the future. Even as
a 36 year-old father and husband, I cannot abandon the 'training missions' of my
youth that have given me edges in today's business and academic climate.
Thanks again, I hope that enough interest is generated for a follow up
article...
<p>
<i>
You've got an understanding wife.  When I try to defend Diplomacy to
my wife as being more than just a game, she just laughs.  It's a real
hobby, I say.  Look, I help maintain a big web site, I say.  Look, I
actually write about the game, to gain and share knowledge.  She doesn't
buy it.  :-)

Simon --
<p>
I'd like to see the reprocessed data -- but only if you have the time to
do it, of course!
Very interesting study.  Proud to have been a part of it.
I live in a studio apartment (space at a premium) and so made a
wall-mounted map for myself (velcro is a wonderful thing).  When I drew the
map, I redistrubted Supply Center DOTS (for instance, my Sevastopol dot is
in the center of Sev, instead of right on the Black Sea).  I did this
because I thought the current placement of the dots themselves would
influence me when I was looking at map positions -- after all, a unit in
Moscow is just as big a threat to Sev as one in the Black Sea, but it
doesn't feel that way because the dot is so much closer to the Black than
to Moscow!).  Of course, I wasn't smart enough to test my theory!  :)

Greetings!
<p>
I did just now read your article on the survey you did.
And one thing that I had to mention to you is that I do not think the two
maps are different enough. To me the 3-D pieces do not look they
point in any particular direction. Unless it is towards the onlooker. :-)
<p><i>Yes, as I said above, an electronic board is not a perfect
substitute for a real one, and my artwork was not great.  On the other
hand, the idea was not to for the orientation of units to be obvious, but
to see if it influenced peoples' perceptions even if they didn't
specifically take notice of how they pointed.</i>

Simon,
<p>
It is articles (and experiments) like the one you ran that keeps me
so intrerested in what really boils down to a simple game.  The results
although inconclusive will keep me thinking for weeks.  Thanks.

I did, however, learn something in the local Axis and Allies club. You
can send subliminal messages with playing pieces. However, in A&A, the
teams are set. There is no discussion on allegiances or anything. So you
can hint to your opponent that you're attacking in a certain direction,
even a certain province (and then you head the opposite direction, or if
he's really onto you, you do the obvious). If you can do that with A&A,
why can't you hint in Dip who's attacking who?
<p>
Okay, fair dues, in Axis and Allies the units actually "point" in a
certain direction. If you see a bunch of tanks pointing in one
direction, you take a hint. Not the same in Dip, but you can be more
subtle in dip.
<p>
Enjoy that tidbit if it helps.
<p>
<i>Thanks.  The idea is the same, I think.   Since Diplomacy pieces have
one dimension longer than the others, they can still "point."  </i>

<p>
No really. I'm not angry. I'm thrilled. Good idea.
<p>
Good idea, bad execution.
Sorry, just had say that. You limit yourself and your capacity. Why aim
for a Yes-No answer (whether median or zero). Take the answers and
weight the on a scale -4 to 4. Qustion 1 minus Q2 or whatever. More
flexible and more sensitive.
<p><i>Yes, the execution could have been better.  As I said above, I'm happy
to give the raw data to anyone who is interested in doing more.</i>
<p>
BUT I don't think the maps differ that much. I took a long look and only
found the French F MAO shifted significantly. In such a test the thesis
that's being tested should catch your eye. I don't think that I'd react
if someone showed me map1, asked me to turn away, and then showed map 2.
I'd say, "well, what?"
<p><i>People were not necessarily supposed to take notice of the
difference.  The issue of orientation was supposed to have been subtle
enough that it would affect perceptions subconsciously, even if one didn't
notice the orientations.</i><p>
I'm not an expert, but think that many players could have been much more
affected by the general surrounding story and general board situation
than by unit positioning.
<p><i>Definitely.  I expect that the context of a game (the current
situation and the past history leading up to it) is going to affect
people much more than something on the level of unit orientation.
Obviously somebody who just stabbed you is not going to convince you
that he's your friend just because his units aren't pointed at you.
But everyone got the same general story and general board situation.
Since that was a common factor to both groups (those who saw map 1, and
those who saw map 2, any statistically significant difference between
the answers from one group to another should not be because of the
story or the setup.  They should be due to other factors that differ
from one group to the next... in this case, the unit orientations.</i><p>

Hi Simon,
<p>
Congratulations on successfully misleading me with your
survey. :-(
<p>
As for the analysis, I don't think it has any meaning that
the "experts" for map2 deviated so much from the trend.
From your numbers I deduce that only seven (7) "experts"
replied that saw map2. That seems far from being significant.
<p>
Two or three extreme opinions can easily change the average.
(You have the individual numbers and should be able to see
whether all seven hat a +2 rating or whether a few extreme
+4 values changed the outcome.)
<p><i>I agree.  On my graphs that gave results vs. style of
play, I didn't plot the results for the small sample sizes,
but marked those areas as having insufficient data.  I don't
know why I didn't do the same for the data you refer to
(results vs. level of expertise, for experts seeing map 2).
I should have.</i><p>
Somehow I don't subscribe to your theory... :-)
<p><i>I'm not sure if that refers to that particular data
point with the small sample, or overall.  Despite the
lack of conclusive data, I still think the original
hypothesis is true and that a better experiment could be
constructed to show it.</i><p><br>
