Boy, you tell the guy you'll get back to him and you delete his email?
:-)

Anyway, I'd copy what I said to him, but I didn't keep your email with
the forward of his email.  I hate it when that happens.

Ack!

I'm going to be doing that second round of analysis for the paranoia 
article, so that will hopefully make it into the issue.  

Also, the World Boardgaming Championships (Not-AvalonCon) is this weekend,
so you can bug some people for con reports (Pitt, John Quarto-vonTivadar,
Tim Richardson, Chris Martin).

And given the fact that you haven't actually called for articles yet, 
you may end up with a few more.
