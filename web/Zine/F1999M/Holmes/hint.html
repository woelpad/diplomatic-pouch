I had to retire for the evening before I had completed my own investigation
into the history of Mr Whipple's final game, but before retiring, I had a
number of interesting questions (if fewer answers).
<P>
<ul>
<li><p align=justify>First, which game phase had just completed?  The strict timetable to which
	the General kept the game helped me here.  I had to spend some time
	determining how many (if any) of the optional phases (retreat and
	adjustment) had occurred.  For Mr Whipple to have been in conference
	forty-five to fifty minutes before his death, only certain possibilities
	existed.
<P>
<li><p align=justify>Second, what information on game events could be discerned from the
	configuration of the units, especially the Austrian and Italian units?
<P>
<li><p align=justify>Third and finally, what of the Russian....?
</ul>
<!--
<p align=justify>Later, after I had written up the introduction to this case, I gave the
manuscript to Holmes for his approval. He glanced over what I had
written, then looked across his cluttered gaming table at me. "My dear
Watson," he said with considerable disapproval, "you can't give this as a
case to solve. It was indeed quite difficult for me to determine who had
killed Whipple -- but that was only because I did not know whether the
information I had would be sufficient to prove the case! If the reader
knows that the case can be solved, which they surely will assume given the
venue, he can readily deduce who must be the killer with scarcely a glance
at the board position at all. Of course readers may still choose to work
backwards through the moves to determine more exactly what happened during
the game. Which power Whipple was playing is not immediately obvious, for
instance, although his opening was clearly as foolish as Turkey's diplomacy
was skilled...."
