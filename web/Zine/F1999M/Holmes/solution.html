Solution to the Case of the Absent Professor
</h2>
<hr>
<p align=justify>
Mrs Hudson had scarcely removed the tea and cake plate from the table when
Holmes had the Diplomacy board out and started throwing English armies
into Scotland.  "If you have a moment, Watson, I would be happy to illustrate
for you my methods in resolving what you have called
<a href=/Zine/W1998A/Holmes/holmes.html>The Case of the Absent Professor</a>."
<P>
"Indeed, Holmes," came my reply.  "I would be most grateful."
<P>
"Well Watson, unfortunate and careless as you were in this game, there is
a certain perverse elegance to it.  Why did you place
six armies in England, for example?"
<P>
I pointed out that one can never be too careful with one's home country.
Holmes continued his narrative:
<P>
"From the large number of units you held, Watson, it is clear that you must
be trapped, and unable to support yourself in an attack on the blockage
causing the trap.  Where do such traps exist?  Obviously in England and
North Africa where six and two armies can be stranded.  Five armies in
Turkey can be held by unsupported units in Bulgaria and Sevastopol
and five in Scandinavia can also be held by three in Kiel, Livonia, and
Moscow.   Thus, five unsupported units can blockade eighteen allied
armies.
<P>
"Since neither you nor Codlington could dislodge one another, it seemed
you must each occupy separate areas.  But this gave a problem since
no combination of six, five, five and two adds to your reported fourteen
units.  A pipe
later and I had it: you could occupy Denmark and Codlington the rest of
Scandinavia since Denmark adjoins only Sweden.
<!or you could share North Africa.>
This way, Codlington has four armies and you are both stuck.
<P>
"Codlington has builds outstanding, and as you had respected his centres I
presumed he was not playing England or Turkey. Furthermore, the absent player
must own Kiel, Moscow, Bulgaria, Sevastopol and one other centre.  Only if that
other were Warsaw, and Codlington was Russia, would he be unable to
build."
<P>

<P>
"Amazing, Holmes!  Your powers of deduction are truly astounding to me.
What surprises me more is that you claim the line could be held with
one fewer unit?  Pray, show me how this could be!"
<P>
"To blockade using one fewer unit, one need only observe that
if Codlington had a fleet on the north coast of St. Petersburg
it could not move southward.
Thus we might consider the possibility of dispensing
with the Moscow and Livonia armies and building
the stalemate line with four units.  However, the problem is...."
<P>
For once, I saw the flaw in Holmes' argument. "No Holmes, you go too far,
for in that case Codlington could order St. Petersburg to Norway, Norway
to Finland, Finland to St. Petersburg, and then escape!  Nor could you stop
the fleet escaping to
Norway, since it could be supported from Sweden!  Even <i>you</i> can't stop a
supported move with a single unit."
<P>
"Ah, but I can, Watson, when the supported move cannot succeed without
an impossible dislodgement.  The Turk could not have
left all of his units to fall into civil disorder by simply exiting
the Calhamer Club as he did, but all
that is necessary to prevent an escape from this position" -- Holmes removed
the Moscow and Livonia armies and placed a Turkish fleet in the Barents Sea --
"is a perpetual order for the Barents
Sea fleet to move to St. Petersburg."

</center>
<P>
Disbelieving, I stared at Holmes' handiwork.  Eventually, I had to
agree with him that Codlington and I would have been equally
trapped by this arrangement as well!
<P>
It is somehow reassuring to
know that as clever as the dastardly Professor Moriarty can be, Sherlock
Holmes can be counted upon to one-up him.
<!-- Nodding, Holmes rather petulantly pointed the Barents Sea fleet
towards St. Petersburg and returned to his pipe. -->
