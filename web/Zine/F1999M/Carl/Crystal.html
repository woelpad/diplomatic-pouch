<p>
Have you ever been playing a game of Diplomacy and known exactly what the next
board setup is going to be?  The moves every player will submit
are obvious.  The alliances have been drawn and the long-term outcome is
pretty clear.  In fact, you know that outcome so well that you use this power
of foresight
trying to convince others to change their ways to avert doom.
<p>
Well
now there is a variant that will really test your prognosticative abilities.
It is called Crystal Ball, and -- while usually played on the standard map
-- it can be played on any map you wish to use.  I'll give you an example
of play first so you get the idea; later I'll give you the specifics.
<P>
One note before we get started:  Crystal Ball Diplomacy has its own Website,
called
<a href=/dpjudge?variant=xtalball><b>Crystal
Ball Central</b></a>, where all Internet Crystal Ball games are run.  At
that site, you can watch all the ongoing action or join a game.
<H3><font color=brown>A Case Study</font></H3>
<p>Turkey negotiates normally with everyone before the Spring 1901 moves.
He talks with Russia and they agree to bounce in the Black Sea, to make
Austria think the two of them were going to war or just being cautious.
<p>The players each write the Spring 1901 orders for their units, put these
orders
in an envelope for safekeeping, and the envelopes -- with the orders still
sealed inside -- are set aside.  It now is time to negotiate and determine
the moves for Fall 1901.  Is there a French fleet in the English Channel?
An Austrian army in Galicia?  The players don't know, because the Spring
1901 moves have not yet been read.  But the players must write their orders
for Fall 1901 and hope that their units are where they want them to be, and that their enemies' units are not where the enemy hopes they are!
<p>Turkey continues negotiating with Russia as if they're working together,
but in fact he's lying through his teeth.  Knowing that Russia will follow
through with the plan they had worked out for 1901, Turkey decided to
double-cross
Russia by <i>not</i> bouncing Russia from the Black Sea.  Instead, the Turk
plans to do a back end-run into Sevastopol by way of Armenia.  Yes,
Russia's fleet will be in the Black Sea unbounced, but Turkey assumes that
Russia (having expected
the promised bounce) will be including in his Fall 1901 orders a command
to be issued to a fleet in Sevastopol -- not to a fleet in the Black Sea.
The fleet in the Black Sea will therefore
be <i>unordered</i> in the Fall, and Turkey will walk into Sevastopol from
Armenia.  Russia won't know what hit him!
<p>Negotiations conclude and it's time for the players to write their Fall
1901 orders, and seal them in an envelope.  When everyone
has done so, it is time to open the seals on the Spring 1901 orders, and
see what really happened.  The unsealed orders are resolved normally.
<p>The players scan the board and see that Turkey moved his army from Smyrna
to Armenia, and moved his fleet to Constantinople.  Russia's fleet did indeed
enter the Black Sea uncontested.  Turkey grins at Russia and Russia looks
angry.  Everyone can tell that Russia expected to see his move to the Black
Sea bounce and that Russia's sealed orders for Fall 1901 include one for
a fleet sitting in Sevastopol, not in the Black Sea!  Sevastopol is wide
open for the army in Armenia to take and Russia's fleet is just going to
sit there in the Black Sea without an order!
<p>Negotiations begin again; this time for Spring 1902.  Turkey is hoping that
Austria honored
the 1901 plan to let him have Greece, so the Turk is expecting three builds.
Russia knows he's been betrayed and doesn't even talk to Turkey -- but he
is talking to Italy a lot; what does that mean?
<p>After negotiations,
it's time for the players to write their Spring 1902 orders based on what
they see on the board now, what they know their own Fall orders to be, and
whatever intelligence they have gathered concerning what the other players'
sealed Fall orders are.  The players write their Spring 1902 orders, remembering
to include orders for those builds they believe they are about to get.  And
of course, they re-adjust their plans based on any treachery such as that visited
on Russia by Turkey.  The orders are submitted, labeled, and set aside.  Then the Fall 1901 orders are pulled out and read.
<p>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Turkey: Army Armenia to Sevastopol.
</tt><br>
Turkey grins.
<p>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russia: Fleet Sevastopol Supports Army Ukraine to Rumania<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(no unit present)</tt><br>
Turkey grins wider.
<p>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Austria: Fleet Albania to Greece (bounce)</tt><br>
Turkey's first piece of bad news.  Austria crossed him up and bounced him
out of Greece.  The order for an army in Greece, which the Turk has already
sealed into an envelope, is now useless.
<p>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russia: Fleet Black Sea proxied to Italy
</tt><br>
Now Russia grins.
Turkey looks to Italy, and Italy smiles.  Uh oh.
<p>
<tt>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Italy: Army Venice Holds<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Italy: Fleet Naples Convoy Army Apulia to Tunis<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Italy: Army Apulia through the Ionian Sea to Tunis<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Italy: Russian Fleet Black Sea to Sevastopol
</tt><br>
Yep, Italy ordered Russia's unit for him and Turkey and Russia bounce
in Sevastopol.  Turkey was counting on getting at least two builds and hoping
for three.  Instead, with Austria's treachery, Turkey
only got one build.  Worse yet, his units aren't where he expected them to be, so his Spring 1902 orders are a mess.  Is Russia now going to move
that fleet to Ankara or Constantinople?  Where should Turkey build his one
new unit?  And, when the envelopes are opened, what will that unit be doing?
<p>Could you do better?
<H3><font color=brown>And Now For Something Completely Different</font></H3>
<p>
Unconventional early stabs can be fatal in Crystal Ball Diplomacy,
and there are many of them to consider!  Normal moves that doom a pair of
countries to mediocrity because the result is so easy to visualize and counter
will succeed in a Crystal Ball game.
<p>Germany can move to Prussia and walk into
a vacated Warsaw, or he can go to Prussia and Silesia and support himself
in, while bouncing Russia in Sweden.  Austria can move his unit up to Tyrolia
and support himself into Venice.  Italy can move Venice to Piedmont and walk into Marseilles.  France can step out into the English Channel and walk into London.  Or England can go to the English Channel and walk into
Brest.  He might even convoy an army into Brest!  If the attacked party honors a DMZ, a stabber can make it all the way through the neutral zone
to the prize.
<p>Openings that have been long abandoned because of their obvious flaws might be reconsidered now that the foe can't respond
as quickly.  Changing direction in Crystal Ball is like turning an aircraft
carrier around; it takes a lot of time.  If you can't predict what is going
to happen, then you've got problems!  But even if you have problems, don't
fear being eliminated completely, you've got a role throughout the whole
game.  As we'll discuss (and as we've seen above), your proxies can be very
valuable to someone, and with skill you can make a comeback.  Another reason
not to fear elimination is that anyone that gets momentum going should get
a lot of attention quickly.  If the other powers don't act against him soon,
then the leader will gain momentum and run away with the game.  So others
will have to react fast and in a coordinated fashion or they lose too.
<H3><font color=brown>The Mechanics</font></H3>
<p>
The variant rules are of course kept here at The Pouch, and you can find them
linked from
<a href=/dpjudge?variant=xtalball>Crystal
Ball Central</a>. Basically, the game mechanics boil down to the following.
For each
movement phase, you have a list of orders and the orders in this list are
considered from top to bottom.  You can list as many orders as you like but only a certain number of them will actually be considered.  The number
of orders that will be considered is equal to the number of SC's owned by
the largest power in the game.  So in Spring 1901, everyone has four orders
to use.  And everyone will have four orders for Fall 1901.  If someone lists
five orders in his list, then the fifth one is ignored (even if it's a valid
order).
<p>You will learn fast to never order a unit to hold.  Units
hold by default if no order is issued to them, and it would be foolish to
waste one of your precious orders on such a command.
<p>Besides
ordering your own units, you can use one or more of your available orders
to order someone else's units -- but of course that unit won't obey your order unless that other power issued you a proxy for that unit. Proxy orders
are not counted with the other orders in your list -- they are counted separately.
The number of proxy orders each player can meaningfully include in his list is equal to the number of SC's owned by the smallest power still living.
<p>Thus, in Spring 1901 and Fall 1901, everyone can issue up to three proxy
orders to give control of their units to other powers, but only four non-proxy
orders will be considered in each player's list.  So if you are Russia and
you wish to take advantage of a proxy that another power has offered to you in 1901 -- allowing you to order one of that other power's units -- you
will have to use one of your four non-proxy orders to do so. Since you have
four of your own units to be ordered, you will either have to allow one of your own units to hold by virtue of being left unordered, or issue a proxy for it to another power and hope he serves you well with it.
<p>From this you can see that it makes little sense for proxies to be offered
to the largest power on the board.  That power has no extra orders in his
list if he wishes to order all of his units.  However, a smaller power --
especially one that knows where all of his units are -- is an invaluable aid to an ally, as he can order units proxied to him in case certain earlier
moves bounced or if any unit had to retreat to a new position.
<p>One
thing that is different about the proxies in a Crystal Ball game and those
in a normal Internet judge game is that you cannot forward a proxy you receive
to someone else.  Let me say that again: if you have played with proxies
in other games, you might have known that if France proxies his units to
Germany, Germany can in turn proxy them to England.  This is <i>not</i> true in
Crystal Ball; any unit that gets a second proxy to it, just holds.
<H3><font color=brown>A Sage Among Seers</font></H3>
<p>
I've played in a couple of the Crystal Ball variant games and am impressed with
the amount of thought and good Diplomacy skills that are needed to survive.
In addition to that, the little guys play very important roles in the game.
Because the number of SC's owned by the largest power on the board determines
how many orders in each player's list will be &quot;considered,&quot; the
job is harder for the leader, like Russia in the above example. Since the
leader only has one order per unit, if his units aren't where he expects
them to be then he's in trouble!  The smaller powers have extra orders to
cover contingencies, though.
<p>As we saw above, however, proxies can help
out.  Because each power may issue as many proxy orders as the number of
SC's owned by the smallest power still alive, this provides some incentive
to keep the single SC powers around since this will limit the number of proxy
orders available for the leader to offer his ally.  On the other hand, it
also encourages the leader to keep powers around that aren't so small, but
to eliminate the very small ones.  Or to build them back up if they are being loyal (always a hard call to make) so that his puppet can order more
of his units by proxy; those that his normal allotment can't handle.
<p>I've played on both sides of the fence now -- as a leader that went on
to get a solo in the game "seer" and as a small power getting beat up and
providing the proxies for someone else trying to get the solo in the game
forecast.  Thankfully, I got a draw out of that one.  I think I've seen it from both sides now and can offer some advice to anyone else that would
try it out.
<H3><font color=brown>The Opening</font></H3>
<p>
The opening strategy depends greatly upon whether
you are playing a press game or a no press game.  I'll discuss the options
in a press game first. There are two ways to start out.  One is pure treachery
and the other is to try and build alliances and stick to them.
<p>There
are many moves of a treacherous nature that would absolutely fail in a standard
game.  For instance, Germany could agree to a bounce with Russia in Silesia.
Russia agrees and expects the bounce, but instead Germany moves to Prussia.
Germany will walk into Warsaw, and worse yet the Russian army in Silesia
might just sit there unordered!  If Russia doesn't mind leaving Warsaw (if
it did bounce) unordered in the Fall, though, he might be wise to include
in his Fall orders an order for Silesia to move to either Warsaw, Munich,
or Berlin -- just in case.
<p>A stab has a one-season grace period in
which the victim can't react at all if he was truly surprised by the move.
This means if you stab when someone isn't expecting it, you can get some
great momentum going before your victim can even react.
<p>Another opening stab that might be a great idea to try (as Italy) is to DMZ Piedmont
with France.  If France honors it, and he almost certainly would, you could
run an army from Venice right into Marseilles.  Or maybe even try France
moving to the English Channel, in violation of a DMZ you set up with England,
capturing London immediately.  I'm sure you can think of many such creative
moves that would work in this variant that wouldn't work in standard.
<p>You might think that such early treachery necessitates moves to prevent
these early stabs.  You start getting into perpetual bounces to maintain
yourself against stabs.  Whoever blinks first -- whoever stops ordering to the DMZ -- is suddenly on the defensive forever.  A classic &quot;prisoner's
dilemma,&quot; right?  Not quite.  Because you can plan to let your opponent
actually enter the DMZ unexpectedly.  After all, you may have reason to believe that he has no order waiting for the unit once it is in the DMZ area. In a no-press game, you get to see everything he has been ordering
in addition to the bounce move.  In a press game, you don't have access to his order lists, but you can see how many of his units, if any, he leaves
holding, and make an educated guess as to whether he has used any of his
extra orders to continue an assault through the neutral zone.  If you believe
you are safe allowing an opponent into a neutral zone, you can have a contingency
plan to cover the danger spot and outflank him.  For example, as France you and England could arrange a perpetual bounce in the English Channel.
Once you establish this bounce, you can move from Brest to MAO, and let
England have the English Channel.
<p>If England is sufficiently surprised
at actually making it into the Channel, he may not have an order for ENG-Bre
in his next list -- thinking it would just have been a waste of one of his
precious few orders.  You might feel confident enough about this to bank
on his fleet being unordered once it reaches the Channel, and this will allow you to move your fleet from the MAO to the Irish Sea.  You can then
build another fleet in Brest, but meanwhile Liverpool is wide open.  Ordinarily
you would have lost Brest, but not if England isn't expecting you to stop
bouncing his move into the English Channel. Even if you are unsure that England will leave a Channel fleet unordered, you may have an army in Paris
all set to bounce him out of Brest anyway.
<p>For another example, again as France, you could agree to bounce Italy in Piedmont.  You could
tell Austria you won't bounce Italy on a certain Fall move, and Austria could walk right into Venice at that time.  You could even do it in the Spring and let Austria take Venice then walks right into Rome as well.
<p>I'm sure you can think of many others.  But with each bounce or DMZ,
there is an alternate trick that could be played to cover it.  Bounces may
be in order for the opening, but don't do it too long or others will come
knocking at your doors.  You need allies, or you won't survive long.
<p>Bounces introduce uncertainty into your next set of orders. Every time
you issue a move order that could be bounced, the set of orders for the next phase would have to include two orders for that unit if you wanted to make sure to order it.  As we've seen, with the limit on orders in your
list, you cannot cover too many of these contingencies.  You can minimize
the number of contingencies you must take into account somewhat through intelligence gathering, but still, a premium must be put on making moves
you are sure will succeed.  Also, it is important to have allies you are
sure will not bounce you or that can help you with proxies in case an enemy
bounces you.
<H3><font color=brown>The Tigger Effect (as in T I Double Guh ER)</font></H3>
<p>
Conversely, each
time you bounce (or not bounce) another player unexpectedly, you make his
life increasingly difficult, and his next set of orders is likely going to be inadequate to meet his new situation.
<p>Nothing bars you from
building an alliance with one player while you stab someone else, but your
trustworthiness is severely questioned depending on how ruthless you were
in your stab.  Trust is a great commodity in Crystal Ball, more so than in other variants.  You can use standard openings and start sharing your
locked-in orders with your allies so that you can coordinate better.  You
can proxy units to a trusted ally that has room for some extra orders in
his list in order to implement contingency plans. You have a lot more orders
to anticipate unexpected developments.
<p>Let's re-explore the first
example we discussed, in which Turkey allowed Russia into the Black Sea in 1901, planning to run his army to the vacated Sevastopol.  As we saw,
Russia expected this treachery, and talked to Italy, working out an alliance
to share proxies.  Russia really wanted this alliance because in the first
game-year he only has four orders.  And so does everyone else, meaning that
everyone but Russia has a spare order to use!  Russia cannot afford any mistakes.  However, everyone has three proxies they can issue. Russia hopes,
of course, that Turkey will bounce him in the Black Sea so that he can then
support his army into Rumania using his fleet in the fall.  But in case Turkey doesn't do that, Russia issued Italy a proxy order for a fleet in
the Black Sea so that Italy could order the fleet back to Sevastopol to thwart Turkey.
<p>So you see that if you can find an ally that you can work with, you have more orders to use.  Russia, instead of only having
four orders in 1901, has seven (if he has trusted friends) to cover for mistakes.  On the first turn, since everyone else has only one extra order
(unless they've got units they are planning to leave unordered -- which is
not necessarily the most likely 1901 occurrence),
Russia would need to find three separate powers to be able to employ all
three proxies. Either that, or let one of his own units go unordered so that he can be sure to cover his potential problems.  His other option is
to convince one power that covering an extra Russian contingency is more
important than ordering one of that power's own units.
<p>In the example, Russia chose to ask Italy for his help for a couple of reasons.
First, of course, is that an Italian ally for Russia is a good thing to
have if Turkey is crossing him.  But second, and perhaps more importantly,
Russia determined that Italy was the most likely power in 1901 to have an
extra order that he could use to help.  Italy's position is such that he
can issue sensible Spring 1901 orders without introducing any uncertainty
about where his units will be in the Fall.  With Venice holding, Naples to the Ionian, and Rome to Apulia, Italy not only is set up for a Lepanto,
but he is sure of where all his units will be in Fall.  By playing Spring
1901 in this way, Italy is guaranteed to have an extra order to offer Russia
for use as a hedge against Turkish treachery.  Other powers, like France
(who must worry about bounces in Burgundy and the English Channel and even
Piedmont) and England (also concerned about the Channel) are not as attractive
to Russia as a proxy ally in 1901, since they will have to cover their own
possible miscalculations.  By contrast, Italy is a very attractive ally,
since if he wishes to simply hold in Venice in Fall, he can even leave Venice
unordered, freeing another spot in his list, and in this way he can issue
orders for two units proxied to him.  Perhaps he helps Russia twice, or perhaps he uses the second proxy he has available to order <tt>F&nbsp;LON-ENG</tt> for
England while England (hoping he made it into the Channel in Spring) orders
<tt>F&nbsp;ENG-Bre</tt>.
<p>A player that starts stabbing and does not maintain his
momentum is in for some big trouble against an alliance that is working together.  If you get even one unit in an unexpected location, your great
big plans could start to fall apart.  You had better be able to recover from bad orders quickly or you will become the victim of your own attack.
<p>England, France, Italy, and Turkey are the main powers that can usually
get away with early treachery and recover if they don't completely succeed.
The reason for this is because they have a limited range of mistakes they'll
encounter and can anticipate them and correct quickly.  Germany, Austria,
and Russia have a lot of room to get spread out and blow it quickly and never recover.
<p>Italy, as discussed above, is able to have a fair
degree of certainty about his units' positions through the first year.  Even if he stabs another power right off the bat, his uncertainties are fairly limited and his units are left in relatively defensible positions
while he reorganizes his plans to accommodate their unexpected whereabouts.
Italy's possible stabs would be to try and take Trieste either by force
or by ruse.  He can try to take Munich by sneaking in, or he can try to capture Marseilles by trying to sneak in.  If he fails, he's lost at least
one possible ally and he will probably have one dedicated enemy on his hands.
But most likely, he isn't too bad off; he's just got no friends in his
immediate neighborhood.
<p>France can try to sneak into Venice, and
might even arrange with Austria to participate in a supported attack on Venice.  He can try to sneak into London or Munich by agreeing to DMZ's in the English Channel and Burgundy respectively.  If the DMZ's are honored
and France cheats, he might get in.  If he fails, he probably won't be in
too bad a shape.  Unless, of course, he's the victim of treachery as well.
<p>England can try to sneak an army or fleet into Brest by not honoring
a DMZ in the English Channel, but his amount of treachery is pretty limited
in the openings.  Which also means he's pretty safe -- the Channel is all
he needs to worry about. Does this mean that <tt>Lon-ENG</tt>
is virtually a must
in CBD, followed in Fall, of course, by <tt>Lon-ENG</tt> and <tt>ENG-Bre</tt>?
Not necessarily.  Just as in standard Diplomacy, a channel opening by England
forces such an opening by France, and the two powers are tied up in
fruitless efforts while their neighbors grow.  Also, if England is thought to
be forced to the Channel in Spring 1901,
this invites <tt>Mos-StP</tt>, because England only has one opening that guarantees him a build, and <tt>Lon-ENG</tt> isn't it.  So just like in the standard
game, diplomatic skills take on paramount importance.
<p>
France has more worries than England does, so it is in his interest to
deter England from opening to the Channel.  Not only must he worry about
a sneak attack on Brest, but the German can walk into Paris, and the Italian
into Marseilles.  France almost certainly will not have spare orders
to offer another power in 1901.
<p>On the other hand, Turkey is relatively secure.
He need worry only about the Black Sea and Armenia, and he can use either
or both of these routes to sneak into Sevastopol,
depending on negotiations with Russia.  Again, he's pretty tightly
clustered, so he won't be too out of position if he fails, but he'll have
an angry Russia on his hands.
<p>As much as I've talked about possible
opening stabs, it is my opinion that the early stabbers most often turn into victims.  If you can't take your opponent out with your stab, then you have become a predictable target for others.  Everyone else knows you
are at war with someone.  And if these other players have no enemies, guess
who is a sitting duck with his back exposed and with a turning radius of
an aircraft carrier.  Alliances seem to do better than early stabbers.
<p>Thank goodness it's a press game and you can talk to your neighbors and determine what is going on to some degree.  But what if it's no press?
<H3><font color=brown>The Sounds of Silence</font></H3>
<p>As mentioned above, in a game with press, a player's order list is not
revealed to the other players.  With the order lists kept secret, an intended
victim might never know how you planned to stab him if the first move of
your stab doesn't work out -- he'll never see all your orders to units that
do not exist.
<p>In a no-press game, though, the orders lists provide a
way to communicate.  Just write your order list to include your allies'
units as if they were proxied to you, and include orders you would like to see him issue in future turns.  The adjudication program marks your orders
as &quot;ignored&quot; or &quot;no unit&quot; or &quot;no Proxy&quot; but
will still reveal them to everyone else.  By doing this, you not only advertise
your wishes but you may find other powers start to issue proxies to you to take advantage of the orders you are repeating.
<p>In a No-Press
game, you no longer know how people will be opening and you don't know what
surprises your fellow players have in store for you.  Almost certainly you can count on the safer countries
to try to stab and get good growth early on and get the momentum for a solo
attempt.  It will be practically impossible to stop an early leader without
press.   Coordination is a nightmare, so using the orders list is a must!
But you have to remember that you are giving orders to your allies as clues
on what to do <i>next</i>.  So when you write your orders in Spring 1901 your allies
won't see them until Fall 1901, when they must write his orders for Spring
of 1902! That's a full year just to get a message of coordination across!
<p>So the trick to communicate is to proxy your units to your allies and
let them decide what to do with them.  Hopefully you have a competent ally,
and hopefully he hasn't decided to use them against you.
<p>So what
is a power to do in the opening in a no-press game?  I would expect some
crazy stabs to be tried and I would try to counter as many of them as possible.
You might just see someone go for the lucky opening and try to grab everything.
The problem with this type of opening is that the player who tries it will
often have no clue where his units will end up and he won't be able to predict
his future order lists with any accuracy.  Sustaining the lead will prove
to be a problem for such a power.  These openings really only result in petty wars that doom both participants.
<p>After all, you can't eliminate
anyone else on the board all by yourself, and that means you'll have a survivor
to harass you.  If you are embroiled with the victim of your stab, everyone
else sees this and will come to scavenge off of you while you are pre-occupied.
My recommendation is to try and establish allies and work with them.  Early
greed is a death-knell for most.
<p>So if you are England in a no-press game, you almost
have to go to the English Channel in Spring 1901, Austria almost has to cover Trieste and Galicia, France has to cover Piedmont, Burgundy and the
English Channel, Germany has to cover Burgundy, and Russia has to cover the Black Sea and Galicia.  In Fall 1901 Russia almost has to cover Sevastopol
in one way or another.
<p>All in all, the no-press game is a wild and
crazy ride. You can communicate more than you can in non-Crystal Ball no-press,
but can you communicate in a timely enough fashion?
<H3><font color=brown>Tactics</font></H3>
<p>
One tactic
to maintain sensible orders is to perform redundant moves.  When you don't
know if you are going to capture something in the Spring but you want to
keep it in the Fall if you are successful, then it's a good idea to have
another unit move right in behind the first.  You then set up a beleaguered
garrison so that you can keep the unexpected gain.  Nothing is worse than
to support a unit into an SC in the spring, watch it succeed, and have an
order for the fall to support the no-longer-there unit into the location
that it already occupies, while the opponent supports himself back into the SC, pushing you out!  Had you been able to support your hold you would
have kept it instead.
<p>For example, you are Turkey and you are trying
to capture Serbia with your armies in Greece and Bulgaria.  In the Spring,
you have Greece support Bulgaria's move to Serbia.  Austria can support Serbia, but did he?  Will you capture Serbia or will you bounce?  If you
capture it, then you want your army in Greece to support Serbia Holding,
not support Bulgaria to Serbia.  But if you could order another of your armies into Bulgaria while making the attempt on Serbia, then you wouldn't
have to worry about it.  You could use Greece to repeat the support for Bulgaria to Serbia and just leave Serbia (if you succeeded in entering it
in Spring) unordered.  This way, if you captured Serbia in Spring, your Fall time attack will bounce any equally supported attack that is made by
an Austrian attempting to retake the center.
<p>The trick is
coordination.  Are your units where you expected them to be?  Do you have
orders in for all your units?  If you don't have enough orders to cover all your units for one reason or another, there is always the proxy.
<H3><font color=brown>The Power of the Proxy</font></H3>
<p>
If you can get an ally you trust early on in the game that is willing to share proxies, then you are in great shape to succeed.  Having
an ally that will order your units when they end up in unexpected locations
is a blessing!  This is a great tool to use no matter what size you are.
<p>If you are in an alliance and you are tightly clustered going in for
the kill, you may not always know who will be where but you do know that
someone in your alliance will be in the right spot.  One power could proxy
their unit in that spot to the other and the other could put the order in.
Then it doesn't matter whose unit is there, the order gets processed properly
and the move will succeed
<p>For example, England and France are working
together to capture Kiel.  England has an army in Ruhr and a fleet in Holland,
while France has armies in Paris and Belgium.  In the set of sealed orders,
England is using his Holland fleet to support Ruhr to Kiel and France is
sending Paris to Burgundy and ordering his Belgium army to Ruhr behind England.
But they cannot be sure that Ruhr to Kiel will succeed (Munich could be
supporting Kiel).  Now, when planning their next move, England and France
both believe that something is going to be in Ruhr but they don't know if
it will be an English unit or a French unit.  So France, who now orders Bur-Mun to cut support in case the first try didn't succeed, proxies Ruhr
to England (in case it did succeed) and England orders Ruhr to Kiel, again
with Holland support.  Now it doesn't matter whether it is a French unit
or an English unit in Ruhr.  It will go to Kiel properly.  If it's an English
unit in Ruhr, this will mean the first attempt failed, but that Par-Bur succeeded, and therefore Munich's support is cut for the second attempt,
helping England into Kiel on the second try.  If instead it's a French unit in Ruhr,
this means that the first attempt succeeded (Munich may have bounced <tt>Par-Bur</tt>
rather than support Kiel).  And because England and France planned ahead
with their Ruhr proxy, Kiel is kept for the English even if Germany attacks
it with support using his retreated unit, by virtue of a beleaguered garrison
created by the Anglo-French attack on Kiel.
<p>If you have been the
victim of a stab, you still have the power of the proxy to help someone else get revenge for you.  This is almost as satisfying!  In the game <tt>forecast</tt>
I was playing Turkey.  Russia and I started out as allies but we fell apart
and he got the better end of me.  So I offered my services to France, to
whom I really hadn't talked much.  But he was the closest power that could
make a run for the solo, and the only reasonable power that could keep me
alive.  I relied on the power of the proxy and became a valuable ally to
him, ordering some of his units around as he made a run for the solo.  It
also stopped him from eliminating me next and destroying his proxies.  France
got all the way to sixteen SC's.  By then, Russia and I had reason to work together
again and I was making a comeback.  I betrayed a set of French proxies and
the solo was averted, and France was pushed back so that either Russia or
I could make a run for the solo next.  I felt that Russia could get it before
I could and felt a draw was more in my interest.  Russia, though, felt the
same way about me, and the game ended as a draw.  But I was pretty little
at one point and made a comeback by virtue of the proxy.
<p>If you have proxies on your side, then you can accommodate more orders and units
being in unexpected places.  Quite often you could know you are going to
be dislodged but not know the where your dislodged unit will end up.  You'd
love to be able to order your unit if you knew where it would be!  Proxies
work great to cover this problem.
<p>I'm assuming that you're the leader here too.  After all, if you are the smaller guy getting beat up,
then you have plenty of orders to use to cover all contingencies.  The proxy
is more important to the leader to maintain momentum.  And it's important
to the little guy as a bargaining tool.
<H3><font color=brown>Getting to the Win</font></H3>
<p>
It is my opinion
that a Crystal Ball Diplomacy game should never
end in a draw.   As I said, I did accept a draw in the game <tt>forecast</tt>,
though.  What's up?!  Well, I thought Russia shouldn't have accepted the
draw because he could have gotten a solo.  I didn't think I could reach a solo so I was willing to accept a draw.  Russia was either too tired to
continue or else he thought I shouldn't have accepted the draw.  I'm not
sure who was right, but I felt that I got a draw when I should have lost
to a solo.  So I stick with my statement that all games should end in a solo in this variant.  If you get a draw, I maintain it's because someone
made a mistake in judgment someplace.  This means that either you're a lucky
dog, or that the someone who made a mistake in accepting the draw is you.
<p>
The trick to
getting to a win is to gain critical mass then lunge for the solo and maintain
that momentum.  If you move too early then the other powers will be able
to gang together and fragment you.  And they won't stop!!  After all, it's
just as hard to stop as it is to get going!  You can end up in some pretty
strange positions and never recover.  I saw Russia with an army in Spain,
completely cut off from the rest of his units,
as he tried to get a solo.  He fizzled out quickly, though, as his units
were strung out all over the place and he was picked apart.  His units couldn't
coordinate, and without certain support, he soon couldn't find half of them
because they'd been bounced or dislodged.
<p>In almost every standard
game, someone reaches twelve to fourteen SC's at least.  Once someone does reach this
mass, the lunge to eighteen is very difficult, though.  But if you get this far
in a Crystal Ball game, you should be able to get the solo if you have momentum
on your side.  In fact, if you know you are going to reach twelve to fourteen
units,
you should make your lunge and get that momentum going right away.  If you're
at critical mass and set up really well, your lunge has a one-turn grace
period that really helps it.  In normal games, once you've reached critical
mass, when you lunge, the whole board can often react quickly
enough to stop you.
<p>You need to have your units well coordinated and ready to move and you
should have a promising growth curve to maintain the momentum.  A disgruntled
power helping with proxies will also be helpful (but be sure such a power is
as committed to your solo victory as you are, or else take your proxies
&quot;in-house&quot; before he can use them against
you at a critical moment).  Then go-go-go.
