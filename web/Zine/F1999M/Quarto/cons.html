<H1 align=center><i>Diplomo Ergo Sum</i></H1>
<H2 align=center>by John Quarto-vonTivadar</H2>
<P>There was room
for a &quot;quickie&quot; article in this issue of the Pouch and our noble
editor asked me for some input and, as it turns out, I’d had a rather hefty
summer full of Diplomacy. So I’d thought I’d comment on  the various topics
I’ve been stewing about these past months. Plus I tend to have strong opinions
and extra room in a Pouch edition means not enough people are writing in,
so here, let me give them a reason to! <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
</P>
<P>This year I attended the convention formerly known as AvalonCON,
held in late July outside Baltimore (USA), always a perennial favorite with
the face-to-face crowd. I also had the good fortune to have a business trip
to the West Coast and thus was able to fit in DragonFlight (Seattle, USA)
during late August. I’ve attended these cons many times over the years but
never both in the same year, and I’d like to share some of my experiences
this summer and at the same time comment on issues I liked and did not like
about both. </P>
<P>AvalonCON as always drew a good number of people from
overseas and Canada. The thing I like best about is that so many of the interesting characters in the hobby seem to attend.  I had decided ahead
of time that I was unlikely to play for the full weekend (AvalonCON has other games to play other than Dip) and I find a learn a lot by sitting through a Round and watching various boards that friends are playing on and &quot;guessing&quot; as to how the game will end.
<P>
I had passed on the
Colonial Dip games (I find it too long a variant) and instead I played in
the first standard Dip round, Friday evening.
I drew Russia, which I never
enjoy playing much, and the rest of the board consisted of a few strong players, amoung them Ray Setzer as Austria, and the infamous
Englander, &quot;Blue,&quot; as France. Looks like an R/A/F three-way from the start.
<FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
 As the Italian and Turkish players were new to face-to-face, it seemed prudent to work with Austria right off
and imagine everyone’s surprise when the Turkish Spring 1901 opening consisted
of A Con hold, F Ankara – Armenia, A Smyrna – Syria. I told you he was new
and when I suggested he might want to leave Smyrna open for a build I didn’t
think he’d take that advice literally in the Spring move. <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
 Despite such an opening, the Turk stayed in the game until about 1908 or
so which just goes to reiterate how strong that corner can be on defense.
After the usual struggles, Turkey and England were eliminated
and Italy and Germany ended up with survivals but were whittled down to small
positions, leaving a F/A/R/G four-way declared due to the Round time expiration.
More on this later. </P>
<P>I also decided not to play in the Saturday morning round, but I played the Saturday night &quot;gunboat&quot; game,
where I ended up at a table GM’ed by David Hood and with Simon Szykman
in the game with five other players new to the game. What a chance to clean up!
Or so I thought. I was England to Simon’s France and despite (or maybe on
account of!) not knowing which country the other was playing, we ended up
being each other’s worst nemesis, essentially fighting to a draw. Many of
the other tables chose to play their Round with press whereas ours was noPress.
I think David’s decision to push us towards NoPress made the game bland,
but it surely made it easier for the newbies since the E/F rivalry would
have disappeared had but a few choice tidbits been press-able. David’s decision,
though, proved correct insofar as a newbie won outright as Turkey. I think that’s a great result for a less experienced player to enjoy and get
&quot;hooked&quot; with. One of the interesting highlights of the evening
was one of the newer players arguing with David Hood about how to interpret
a support-in-holding rules question: you had to be there to see the look
on Simon’s (and David’s) face when the fellow argued to Hood, the top ranked
American player and five(?)-time winner of the AvalonCON tourney, saying &quot;but
that’s how I <B>always</B> played it!&quot;</P>
<P>At DragonFlight, where
Chris Martin, Buz Eddy, and others were in attendance, I drew Germany in
Round 1, with Chris as France. Perfect set up for a SeaLion which we got
off to on a great start, except that Chris’ buddy was playing Russia and
opened A MOS-STP. There isn’t much use for Germany in a SeaLion that gains
him but EDI so I swapped sides and after Chris's inevitable stab, we were able to force him to a six-way draw. I was helped greatly by Chris’ being
a former World Champion, a fact I reminded the other players of (about once every minute). I played a second Round during the midnight Round and
scored a solo as Italy in a 4&frac12; hour time limit, a personal best. In this
game Austria seemed interested in a Key Lepanto but was unsure of the details
so I was able to not only get an army into Serbia in Fall 1901 but also  an army in Trieste that same year, and actually talked him into the idea
that this was part and parcel of the opening (after all, he got a build anyway). Hmm, who was it that said if you’re going to lie, lie big! <FONT
FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
 Again, I decided to opt out of playing any
additional rounds even though a Final Round was required for placement in
the tournament, due to family considerations. Chris got nuked during another
round and then had another good round as France, again, giving lots of points
to the East Coasters playing in Seattle. DragonFlight is definitely one of the better Dip cons on the regular circuit—for such a small con, the 4-5 rounds of Dip available during a three-day period are exciting and laid back
at the same time.</P>
<P>Okay, well, on to something other than a diary.  Something more to the
point of the article. I’ve been playing less and less face-to-face
Diplomacy over the years, especially at bigger conventions. AvalonCON this year crystalized
in my mind exactly the reason for that. The scoring system sucks. I don’t
think there is a nice way to say it. It has nothing to do with the great
people playing and running the tourney. But the scoring system sucks. 
First I'll tell you what the scoring system is (in case you don't know), and
then I'll tell you why (IMHO) it sucks.
<P>At AvalonCON, each game round
lasts a set period of time known only to the GM, atlhough there is a set
minimum and maximum time announced ahead of time. The game ends on the turn
in progress when time is called. Players can also vote to end games, each
player having one vote for each SC he controls as of the last winter adjustment
phase, and 29 of the 34 votes can pass any such resolution. There are no
restrictions on what proposal can be voted for as long as at least 29 votes
are cast for it. You get major points for being in a N-way draw, where N
is small, and then a modifier is added on for your SC count to that. In essence a three-way with a small amount of SC’s scores much better than a five-way
with a large number of SC’s]</P>
<P>I’ve seen this system in operation for a number of years now. It works when the game itself is played as a game, but it does <B>not</B> work when there is a tournament taking place.
This year had plenty of good examples: in the game I was in, as Russia I
was up to 12 or 13 SC's at one point, neither a bad nor a good showing as Russia
in a high level tourney. However, time was clicking away and we were deep
into the warning zone on the time out. The push was on to eliminate one or both of the small powers remaining (Germany and Italy) since F/A/R could
not yet reach the 29 votes amongst us to end the game. Little did any
of us know that if time is called and it is the Spring move, then in this
scoring system one doesn’t take one’s last winter SC count but rather does
one at the end of Spring (!), for occupied but not-yet-controlled SC's and uses
<i>that</i> number for voting purposes which of course means attacks for position
rather than for centers don’t pay off in the end game. Thus there is every
incentive for small powers to run the clock out, ask for draw votes to delay
things tremendously, etc.,
especially since a large SC count as part of a large N-way draw doesn’t score nearly as well as a lower SC count as part of a small N-way draw. And big powers don’t have an incentive to attack aggressively for position
since their own SC count is in jeopardy if the game ends during a Spring
move. Fair enough, any of us could have walked over and asked further details
about the scoring system, but the point is that the system is so geared towards what the result will do for one’s overall tournament score rather
than for the game in progress itself that I think it perverts the entire
procedure. Why should players be encouraged to walk over to check on how
their actions will affect their tournament score rather than figuring out
how their actions will affect the outcome of the game at hand?</P>
<P>But
it is much worse. In a later round, in which I took a bye and simply observed,
I saw what I thought to be one of the worst examples of meta-gaming in years.
(If any other the participants are reading this I implore them to step forward
with their own version of events; I’d like to hear someone else’s take on
what I saw, or maybe what I <B>think</B> I saw). At one table, a very famous
player (to remain nameless), as Italy, was around 10 SC or so. The French
player (IMHO not a player of any great or small skill, just an average joe),
was at around 7 SC. Austria was about 7 SC and Russia around 5 SC.
Turkey was out, and Germany was either at 1 SC or out. England was played by none other than multi-AvalonCON
winner, David Hood, and he owned 4 SC's. A proposal was put on the table for a France/Italy
two-way draw, <B>and it passed</B>! The supposed logic here, and I use that
term loosely, was that Hood, with such a high national ranking as well as
the previous year’s winner, was the prime target and the other players didn’t
want to take a chance that he would get a high enough number of SC such that he could veto any draw proposal. So they, Austria and Russia, voted
themselves out of the draw!!!  What is this, a second-grade playground? We’re not talking about gunning for a big power leader who also happens to be well-ranked and scoring well for the tourney. We’re talking about in essence throwing the game on account of a 4 SC power, because he might,
<B>might</B>, do well in other rounds. Heaven help us all if David Hood --
or anyone for that matter -- is considered to be so good that we will play
a game for six hours and then throw it just so that person gets a lousy score
for that round to pull his average down and affect his overall Tournament score. Shame, shame,
shame. And you know what? The French player, with this bastardized 2way,
ended up with &quot;Best France&quot; for the tourney! This defines &quot;best&quot;???
No wonder all the kids are playing Magic. <i>[This isn’t a dig on the French
player, it’s a dig on the scoring system.]</i></P>
<P>But that example is not all!  Yes, AvalonCON produced
yet <B>another</B> example this year. This time on a board with a strong
F/E alliance slowly pushing back A/I, although A/I sat firmly ahead of the
13 SC balkan stalemate line (and both players knew the actual line; in fact,
it was discussed as part of the draw debate). Here, the Italian player voted
himself out of the locked-in four-way draw, because he had to leave for another
appointment. Never mind the fact that the four-way proposal was voted down.
Since the Italian player had already announced he wanted to leave—there was no way for Austria, even with the Italian giving him centers, to produce
the correct units in time to hold the line himself. Ergo, for the sake of
moving on, the Italian voted for the F/E/A three-way draw, especially
when his erstwhile
Austrian ally told him how much better it would score for Austria in the
tournament if it were a three-way instead of a 4way. Again, I say: shame. That
was a four-way lock and one of those big powers should have done what, in this
writer’s opinion at least, was the &quot;right thing&quot; which was to insist on a legitimate ending. The four-way would have ensued when the GM called
time since no three powers had the requisite 29 SC’s, pure and simple. <i>[Again,
this
isn’t a dig on the Italian player, it’s a dig on the scoring system.]</i></P>
<P>In contrast, the scoring system at DragonFlight, a much smaller and not nearly as prestigious tourney as AvalonCON, was semi-secret. All votes
had to be unanimous and there was a definite end time for the game. If no
unanimous consensus was reached before then, then it was DIAS, although players could unanimously vote to continue the game until its natural ending
or until all surviving players called it quits. But one didn’t know ahead
of time whether the scoring system was going to favour small N-ways or favour
high SC count or some variant in between. Who was to say whether a 17 SC power held at bay by six small fry would score better than an 11 SC three-way? This
unknown meant each game had at least a modicum of focus on the game itself
rather than the scoring system.</P>
<P>Well, I’ve ranted enough. It is probably incumbent upon me to suggest a solution for what I perceive as a broken system at AvalonCON, especially since it is to host next year’s World Diplomacy Championships. I think it is a easy and reasonable one: You can’t vote
yourself out of a draw. <FONT FACE="Wingdings">&#74;</FONT>
 Easy enough,
huh? You still get to vote up to 29 SC so as to engender actual ends to the
games, yet you can’t create a problem in misbalancing the tourney by voting
yourself out of a draw. Further make the scoring system somewhat secretive.
Only the GM has to know the actual scoring system and it can be easy or hard to calculate. You know what folks, that’s where a laptop comes in handy!
Without a severe fix to the system this author has doubts about bothering
to participate in enough rounds next summer at AvalonCON to even play for
contention. I’ve heard at least as much from two former world champs that
I regularly talk with, the consensus being to go in and play a round or two for the fun of it but not rounds to compete overall, instead using the
time to play variants or the like. And that’s a shame since the only thing
sillier than driving away newbies is driving away hard-core contenders.
</P>
<P>As part of a future article for the Pouch, I will outline a system
by which all of the various (and differing!) methods of scoring can be accommodated
in one normalized algorithm that measures all of the statistics that various
scoring methods endeavor to hold as of prime importance. Maybe that will
spark some debate over the winter and help make next year’s World Diplomacy
Championships the best ever.</P>
<P>[On a separate note, if anyone is interested
in there being some Dip variant tourneys to occur a day or two before the
main event at next year’s World Diplomacy Championships, or a Bourse variant
to run concurrent with the main games, please contact me directly so we can put the wheels in motion now and make the Tournament Director’s job as easy as possible.]</P>
