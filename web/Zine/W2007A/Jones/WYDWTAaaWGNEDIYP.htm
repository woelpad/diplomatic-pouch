<H1>WHY YOU DON'T WANT TO APPEAR AS A WISE GOOD-NATURED ELOQUENT DIPLOMAT IN YOUR PRESS</H1>

<p>In this article I am going to talk about what kind of writing styles
you can adopt in your press. I'm assuming you're using the DPJudge or
some other Play by E-mail system, and that you don't know the people
that you're playing with. The idea here is that the presentation of
your ideas is equally important as the ideas themselves.
<p>When I started to play <b>Diplomacy</b> on the Judge, when I wrote my press I
always tried to come across as an intelligent even-minded individual
who was capable of stringing lots of words together in a line. Why did
I do this? I can only assume it was because I felt people wouldn't
want to work with or to trust someone who came across as volatile or
just plain stupid. Despite this being the style of press I see most
often in my games, I'm not convinced that it's the best way to
communicate in the game &#8212 in fact, I believe it has some marked
disadvantages.
<ul>
<li><b>Marked disadvantage number one:</b> <i>People see you as a threat</i>. Yes, a
threat! I didn't realise this myself until I'd been playing for quite
a while and I found that, at the start of a new game when press is
flying left, right and centre, I began mentally labelling the most
silver-tounged frequent pressers as "potential problems". Indeed,
when planning your european domination from turn one, anyone who
doesn't come across as a complete newbie to the game is a threat, but
those who come over as the most experienced, greasy diplomats are the
ones you want to keep an eye on. On the other hand, the players who
just send one or two reasonably short presses, proposing a DMZ here or
an alliance here, without writing a missive trying to convince you why
such an agreement would be in your interest, seemed to worry me less.
<br><br>
<li><b>Marked disadvantage number two:</b> It's very easy to get into a formula
for writing messages, which means that other players can recognise you
from different games. I used to have a "formula" for writing my
press. I would start with Dear Countryname, and at the end I would put
Regards, myCountryname. The problem with this was that I was quickly
recognised by one or two players from game to game, which is something
you definitely do not want to happen. Grudges from previous games are
carried over, knowledge of your playstyle, your trustability and your
aims in a game are carried over. This was especially bad in my case as
my playstyle is somewhat that of "chronic stabber who goes for the
solo every time". And once you have a reputation like that and
someone recognises you, your game is over before it's begun!
</ul>
<p>So, what options are available to the cunning player who wants to
manipulate other players without writing long persuasive messages in
Queen's English? I believe the problem is as follows: When you start
the game, you want others to move as you'd like them to. To do this,
you try to persuade them using the diplomatic style with long
convincing presses. The problem is that all good <b>Diplomacy</b> players are
used to this, and quite often even resent it. So you're better off not
even trying to persuade people in this way. The subtelty is to get
others to agree to your moves without them even realising they've been
convinced. If I could do that, I'd be a master. Anyway, I'll talk
about a couple of techniques that I've seen or used that are designed
to avoid either or both of the above disadvantages, which are enough
to kill your game regardless of what power or what plans you make.
<ul>
<li><b>Technique number one: The foreigner.</b> This is a favourite of mine, and
I've used it a few times, to varying levels of success. You write your
messages such that they contain numerous (how many is up to you)
grammatical errors, and that they are never particularly long. You
keep sentences short. My favourite thing to do is to butcher
prepositions, which is easy if you happen to speak another language
yourself. If in your language, you talk to someone *of* something
rather than *about*, then slip into your press that you've heard from
Germany, who kept talking of an attack towards England. Since
prepositions are a nightmare to language students everywhere, but an
error will certainly not go unnoticed by a native, this is sufficient
to give the impression that you're "not from around here". "So
what?" I hear you cry! "Surely <b>Diplomacy</b> players aren't racist
enough to think that someone who's not from the USA or UK makes a
worse player?" Surely not indeed. The fact remains however that a
player who manages to get all his ideas across clearly but who doesn't
write beautiful persuasive English somehow seems less like he's
putting up a beautiful fa√ßade to cover his evil intentions. The player
who states some moves in a press and then says: "Which are your
thoughts about these?" is more likely to elicit a positive response
from me than someone who tells me what is best for me. And makes me
read a page of press at that.
<br><br>
<li><b>Technique number two: The character.</b> I've not quite used this one
myself, but I lose track of the times where I see someone role playing
in <b>Diplomacy</b>. The message starts with something about them being King
(or Queen) of the high seas and ends with "My kindest greetings to
you and your people, from the throne room of Great High King (or Queen)
Olaf the Second". The benefit? Two-fold. Firstly, the benefit is to
you, the role player. Because you put on a mental 'hat' before
writing your press, you're less likely to say something you don't
really mean or say something without thinking it through properly,
because everything you say has to be translated into what your
character would say. Secondly, no one else on the board knows quite
what to make of you. Is he a nutter? Maybe? The only real risk with
this is that you are recognised simply because you are "the guy who
always role plays". This depends on the circles you play in, I guess.
<br><br>
<li><b>Technique number three: The emotional guy (the madman).</b> I quite like
this one. It's amazing what it can do sometimes. Basically, you act as
if you have principles, by which I mean that you refuse to deal with
someone who stabs you. If you offer someone a deal and they say no,
instead of coming up with another offer or a reworked version, you say
"Well then I am sorry you're not interested. Maybe we will have
business another time.". The player will quite often come back to you
with their own version of the deal. In a game full of slimy persuasive
types, sometimes it can be quite fun to just pretend to lose control.
Preferably in a broadcast. You send out a press in which you rage at
player X who stabbed you last turn. You spell out exactly what he said
to you, all his promises (include excerpts from his press to you if
you like). You make clear that your only remaining goal in this game
is to bring his many crimes against your proud nation to justice. What
can this do? It suddenly paints you as a player with principles.
Someone who isn't going to stop waging his war for a cheap centre but
infact has a drive to see player X eliminated. This makes it much
easier to find reliable allies against poor old player X because
everyone knows (thinks) that you are committed to the fight. This
technique can also dissuade any one else who was planning to nick a
cheap SC and hoping to get away with it. And finally, it can make your
allies trust you more, because they also feel like you're committed to
fighting someone else.
</ul>
<p>Aside from these three techniques though, there are other much easier
ways to stop yourself coming over as an old hand. Don't tell the other
players what to do, but instead ask them questions. Put forward an
idea and ask them what they think about it. It makes them feel like
they are running the relationship between you. If another player
mentions a Lepanto or ELS or a Juggernaut in their press, feel free to
ask them what it is. I think you will find that in <b>Diplomacy</b> there is
a much greater chance that people will try to take advantage of,
rather than gang up on, the player who seems like he's newer to the
game. And it's far better to be in a position where your ally thinks
he has you sussed and will deal with you when he's got time than one
who's thinking 'This guy knows what he's doing, as soon as I can
spare a unit I'll have to turn on him just to save my ass'.
<p>In short, in <b>Diplomacy</b> it can pay high dividends to appear like a
newbie who's not really sure what he's doing. Counterintuitive, eh?
There are a hundred and one ways to do this, and probably far better
than what I've described, but I hope I've given you some ideas.
