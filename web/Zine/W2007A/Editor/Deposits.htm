<p>Charles,

<p>I wanted to congratulate you on yet another successful issue of the
pouch.  It looks great as always!  Your efforts in bringing the pouch
back to life have most definitely not gone unnoticed and are highly
appreciated!

<p>I will continue to contribute as I can&#8230 I expect to try to write
something for either spring or spring retreats next year (the rest of
the year is too busy to promise anything sooner).  Please feel free to
pester me to contribute :)

<blockquote><i>Thanks, Adam! And thank you again for <a href="../../F2007R/Silverman/prometheus.htm">your summary of the Prometheus game</a>. I'm glad to hear that you intend to continue writing for us. 
<p>And don't worry, I will indeed pester you for more! :-)</i></blockquote>

<p>Mr. Burton:

<p>I've just read the your article in the latest edition of the Pouch, and I was most impressed with your analysis. Tables 3 and 4 were particularly interesting. At first glance, they look like a recipe for whom to eliminate and with whom to form an alliance. But as your article makes clear, it is dangerous to so generalize.

<p>Your tools and techniques, together with your excellent writing skills, make for an interesting read. Thanks for your contribution.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Well, there you have it. Another Deposits column.
Yep, it sure is.</H3>
