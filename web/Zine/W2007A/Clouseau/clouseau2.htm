<h3>1. Defending France</h3>

<p><center><img border="2" src="../../F2007R/Clouseau/problem1.gif"></center><br><br>
<dd>
<!-- <p>Position:<br><br> -->
<table><tr><th align="left">France: <td>F(Lon), A(Bre), A(Par), A(Mar)
<tr><th align="left">Germany: <td>F(ENG), A(Pic), A(Bur)
<tr><th align="left">Season to play: <td>Fall
<tr><th align="left">You are: <td>France
</table><br>

<p>You have been caught out of position by Germany. Germany can attack Brest or Paris with support, and your units in Lon and Mar are too far away to
support them.

<p>How can you guarantee to keep Brest and Paris this year, against any
possible German attack?</dd></dl>

<p>Clouseau's suggestion was simply to order Army Brest support Army Paris, on the grounds that a static defense is always best. Unfortunately for him, that's entirely untrue! In this particular case, Germany can cut any defensive supports easily. For example, the Kaiser could order anyof the following attacks:<br><br>

<center><p><table border="1" cellpadding="2"><th>Brest Attack 1<th>Paris Attack 1 
<tr><td>
F ENG S A PIC-BRE<br>
A PIC-BRE<br>
A BUR-PAR (cuts support)
<td>
A PIC-PAR<br>
A BUR S A PIC-PAR<br>
F ENG-BRE (cuts support)

<tr><th>Brest Attack 2<th>Paris Attack 2
<tr><td>
A PIC S F ENG-BRE<br>
F ENG-BRE<br>
A BUR-PAR (cuts support)
<td>
A BUR-PAR<br>
A PIC S A BUR-PAR<br>
F ENG-BRE (cuts support)
</table></center>

<p>The key to defeating all of these attacks is to use a <i>dynamic</i> defense, by ordering France's units to cut all possible supports. The French player should order:<br><br>

<center><table border="1" cellpadding="2"><th>Order<th>Reasoning
<tr><td>F LON-ENG<td>Cuts support for Brest Attack 1
<tr><td>A MAR-BUR<td>Cuts support for Paris Attack 1
<tr><td>A BRE-PIC<td>Cuts support for Paris Attack 2
<tr><td>A PAR-PIC<td>Cuts support for Brest Attack 2
</table></center>

<p>Note that you have to order <i>both</i> Army Brest and Army Paris to Picardy to be sure of cutting that possible support, since a unit cannot cut the support for an attack on the territory it occupies. If you order A PAR-PIC but not A BRE-PIC, then Paris Attack 2 will succeed; similarly, A BRE-PIC cannot cut the support for Brest Attack 2.

<h3>2. Italian Infiltration</h3>
<p><center><img border="2" src="../../F2007R/Clouseau/problem2.gif"></center><br><br>
<dd>
<!-- <p>Position:<br><br> -->
<table><tr><th align="left">France: <td>A(Par), A(Pic), A(Bel), A(Ruh), A(Mun), A(Mar)
<tr><th align="left">Italy: <td>A(Bur), A(Pie)
<tr><th align="left">Season to play: <td>Fall
<tr><th align="left">You are: <td>France
</table><br>
<p>Italy has managed to sneak a unit into Burgundy, and unfortunately, you
haven't got a unit next to Marseilles to support it. You can cut Burgundy,
but Italy might use that as the moving unit (or of course, he might use
Burgundy to support Piedmont in).

<p>How can you guarantee to keep Italy out of Marseilles this year, against
any possible Italian attack?
</dd></dl>

<p>Although Clouseau seemed to think the solution was necessarily diplomatic, really you can guard France's home centers purely through a tactical defense. 

<p>Italy has two possible attacks on Marseilles:

<p><center><table border="1" cellpadding="2"><tr><th>Marseilles Attack 1<th>Marseilles Attack 2
<tr><td>A BUR S A PIE-MAR<br>A PIE-MAR
<td>A PIE S A BUR-MAR<br>A BUR-MAR</table></center>

<p>Naturally, with four armies surrounding Burgundy, you have plenty of resources to cut the support in Marseilles Attack 1. However, the problem is that you must also counter Marseilles Attack 2. You can do that by ordering your own supported attack on Burgundy from Marseilles:

<p><center><table border="0">
<tr><td>A MAR-BUR<br>
A PAR S A MAR-BUR
</table></center>

<p>This counters Marseilles Attack 2 easily. However, if Italy uses Marseilles Attack 1 instead, your move on Burgundy succeeds, and Army Piedmont marches into Marseilles as you vacate it! 

<p>To counter both possible attacks, you must add a second supported attack on Burgundy, to ensure that yourmove from Marseilles is bounced regardless of what Italy does:

<p><center><table border="a" cellpadding="2"><tr><th>Orders<th>Reasoning
<tr><td>A MAR-BUR<br>
A PAR S A MAR-BUR
<td>Counters Marseilles Attack 2.
<tr><td>A BEL-BUR<br>
A PIC S A BEL-BUR
<td>Ensures that the countering attack on Burgundy<br>
is bounced, so Marseilles is still occupied at<br>
the end of the turn.
</table></center>

<p>Given the concentration of French units in the area, you could actually use different armies for this defense. The main point is to have two two-unit attacks on the Burgundy space.

<h3>3. Mediterranean Stalemates</h3>
<p><center><img border="2" src="../../F2007R/Clouseau/problem3.gif"></center><br><br>
<dd>
<!-- <p>Position:<br><br> -->
<table><tr><th align="left">France: <td>F(Mar), F(GOL), F(WMS), F(NAf)
<tr><th align="left" valign="top">Italy: <td>F(ION), F(TYS), F(Nap), A(Tus), <br>A(Pie), A(Ven), A(Tyr)
<br>Italy owns Tunis.
<tr><th align="left">Season to play: <td>Fall
<tr><th align="left">You are: <td>Italy
</table><br>
<p>France is pushing for the solo. He's got you slightly outnumbered in
fleets, although you've clearly got the army advantage!

<p>How can you stop him making any progress? That is, how can you stop him
getting a unit into Pie, Tus, TYS or Tun, against any possible French attack?</dd></dl>

<p>Defending Piedmont is relatively simple: there are two French units that can attack it (F LYO and F MAR), and three Italian units that can defend it. If you order Army Tyrolia to support Army Piedmont to hold, France can't get any further on that front. 

<p>No, the real challenge here is to defend Italy's position on the seas. How can you prevent France from advancing into the Tyrrhenian Sea, while still covering Tunis?

<p>Clouseau's solution was to use Fleet Tyrrhennian Sea for a supported attack on Tunis. Unfortunately, this is incorrect! In fact, if you follow Clouseau's suggetions and order:

<p><center><table border="0">
<tr><td>F TYS S F ION-TUN
<br>F ION-TUN
<br>F NAP-ION
</table></center>

<p><p>&#8230then you risk losing either the Tyrrhenian or Tunis to a supported French attack! Consider:

<p><center><table border="a" cellpadding="2"><tr><th>Target<th>Orders<th>Result
<tr><td>Tunis<td>F LYO-TYS<br>
F WES S F NAF-TUN<br>
F NAF-TUN
<td>Cuts support for Italian move to Tunis, takes the center.
<tr><td>Tyrrhenian<td>F LYO-TYS<br>
F WES S F LYO-TYS<br>
F NAF-TUN
<td>Takes the Tyrrhenian Sea.
</table></center> 

<p>If you order Fleet Naples to support Fleet Tyrrhenian Sea in place, then you have covered that space but the attack on Tunis will still work.

<p>You can ensure that France fails to take Tunis by ordering the attack the other way round: 

<p><center><table border="0">
<tr><td>F TYS-TUN
<br>F ION S F TYS-TUN
<br>F NAP-TYS
</table></center>

<p>Unfortunately, this doesn't defend against the French attack on the Tyrrhenian. So how do you launch an attack whose support cannot be cut through a sea space? With a convoy, of course! A convoy cannot be cut unless it's dislodged, and is able to accept defensive support. So the key is to convoy Army Tuscany to Tunis while supporting Fleet Tyrrhenian Sea in place:

<p><center><table border="a" cellpadding="2"><tr><th>Orders<th>Reasoning
<tr><td>A TYR S A PIE<br>
A PIE H
<td>Defends against French F LYO S F MAR-PIE or vice-versa.
<tr><td>A TUS-TYS-TUN<br>
F TYS C A TUS-TUN<br>
F ION S A TUS-TUN
<td>Defends against any French attack on Tunis.
<tr><td>F NAP S F TYS<td>Defends against any French attack on Tyrrhenian.
<tr><td>A VEN-TUS<td>Covers Tuscany against a French F LYO-TUS.
</table></center>

<p>This defense counters against the attack on Tunis; and if France tries the Tyrrhenian attack instead, the convoy to Tunis succeeds.

<h3>4. Turkish Defence</h3>
<p><center><img border="2" src="../../F2007R/Clouseau/problem4.gif"></center><br><br>
<dd>
<!-- <p>Position:<br><br> -->
<table><tr><th align="left">Turkey: <td>F(Con), F(Smy), A(Ank)
<tr><th align="left">Italy: <td>F(Bul/sc), F(AEG), F(EMS), A(Syr)
<tr><th align="left">Season to play: <td>Fall
<tr><th align="left">You are: <td>Turkey
</table><br>
<p>Italy has you outnumbered, and is slowly pushing you back. However, from
your negotiations, you've found out that Italy is ordering:
<table border="0">
<tr><td>F(Bul/sc) - Con, 
<tr><td>F(AEG) s F(Bul/sc) - Con, 
<tr><td>A(Syr) - Smy, 
<tr><td>F(EMS) s A(Syr) - Smy
</table><br>

<p>Given this information, how can you hold all your home centres this turn?</dd></dl>

<p>Forewarned is forearmed, as they say! Although Clouseau was convinced that you'd need outside intervention, it is possible to defend against this Italian attack, as follows:

<p><center><table border="a" cellpadding="2"><tr><th>Orders<th>Reasoning
<tr><td>F SMY-AEG
<td>Cuts Fleet Aegean's support for F BUL-CON.
<tr><td>F CON-SMY<br>
A ANK S F CON-SMY
<td>Counters the two-unit attack on Smyrna
</table></center>

<p>Note that F CON S A ANK-SMY would fail, because Fleet Bulgaria's unsuccessful attack on Constantinople will still cut any support from F CON.  

<p>Note that in this case, Italy got a little greedy. He could be absolutely sure of seizing Smyrna with the following orders:

<center><table border="0">
<tr><td>F BUL/sc-CON 
<tr><td>F AEG-SMY 
<tr><td>A SYR S F AEG-SMY 
<tr><td>F EMS s F AEG-SMY
</table></center>

<p>The move comes from the Aegean rather than the Eastern Med or Syria because the latter are uncuttable supports, while a support from Fleet Aegean can be cut by a Turkish move of Fleet Constantinople to Aegean Sea.

<h3>5. Holding Rumania</h3>
<p><center><img border="2" src="../../F2007R/Clouseau/problem5.gif"></center><br><br>
<dd>
<!-- <p>Position:<br><br> -->
<table><tr><th align="left">Turkey: <td>F(BLA), A(Bul), A(Gre), A(Tri)
<tr><th align="left" valign="top">Russia: <td>A(Rum), A(Gal), A(Vie), A(Sil), A(Lvn)
<br>Russia owns Rum and Sev, Turkey owns Ser.
<tr><th align="left">Season to play: <td>Spring
<tr><th align="left">You are: <td>Russia
</table><br>
<p>You are under attack from Turkey. From your negotiations, you've found out
that in the Spring, he will be ordering A(Bul) - Rum, F(BLA) s A(Bul) -
Rum, A(Gre) - Ser, A(Tri) s A(Gre) - Ser.

<p>You can easily stop him taking Rum in the Spring &#8212 just support it with
Gal, But if he gets into Serbia then he will have three units to attack it
in the Fall. So how can you ensure that both Rum and Sev are still yours at the end of the year?</dd>
</dl>

<p>Once again, foreknowledge proves useful! 

<p>The key here is to realize that this is a <i>Spring</i> move. You can afford to let Turkey into Rumania temporarily, as long as you eject him again in the Fall. So you can use Army Rumania to keep Turkey out of Serbia in the Spring; that way, even if Turkey dislodges you from Rumania in the Spring you will still have superior numbers available to retake the center in the Fall.

<p>Since you know Turkey's plan of attack, you should order the following:

<p><center><table border="a" cellpadding="2"><tr><th>Orders<th>Reasoning
<tr><td>A VIE-TRI
<td>Cuts Turkish support for attack on Serbia.
<tr><td>A RUM-SER
<td>Prevents Turkish A GRE-SER.
<tr><td>A GAL-UKR<br>A SIL-GAL<td>Provides leverage against Rumania for the Fall.
<tr><td>A LVN-MOS<td>Prepares to cover Sevastopol in the Fall.
</table></center>

<p>These orders counter the Turkish move on Serbia, but Army Rumania is dislodged. However, you are free to retreat it to Sevastopol.

<p>In the Fall, you should be able to retake Rumania while still guarding Sevastopol with the following orders:

<p><center><table border="a" cellpadding="2"><tr><th>Orders<th>Reasoning
<tr><td>A SEV-RUM<br>A GAL S A SEV-RUM<br>A UKR S A SEV-RUM
<td>Retakes Rumania against any possible Turkish defense.
<tr><td>A MOS-SEV<td>Covers Sevastopol against a possible F BLA-SEV.
<tr><td>A VIE-BUD<td>Prevents Turkish retreat of A RUM-BUD
</table></center>

<p>Unfortunately, with these moves it's still possible for Turkey to gain some ground in the Fall by ordering A TRI-VIE instead of supporting A GRE-SER (which at this point becomes a wasted support), or A TRI S A RUM-BUD. However, Rumania and Sevastopol will be guaranteed. 
<br><br><br><br>

<p>So there you have it! 

<p>If you've enjoyed these little tactical problems, I highly recommend that you look at Matthew Self's <a href="/Zine/W1995A/Tactics/">Library of Diplomacy Tactics</a>, which contains a whole bunch of similar tactical puzzles that can help you sharpen your game.
