<H1>WELCOME TO GALICIA</H1>

<p>Galicia is the critical land province in the East early in the game.
It is the most common land place for a stand off in 1901, and is often
seen as critical to understand what is happening in the East.  It
borders on 4 supply centers (Vie/Bud/Rum/War) and 3 other provinces
(Sil/Boh/Ukr) which puts it up there in the top 3 or 4 places on the
board to be.  It is also the site of one of the many first lies in
the game between Russia and Austria.

<p>In Spring 1901 the Austrians typically (over 50% of the time) try to
go to Galicia, mostly to keep the Russians out rather than to use it
as a development for an attack on Russia's Warsaw or primary interest
in Rumania.   The Russians go there usually to keep the Austrians out,
or to provide a launching platform for an attack on Austria.
<p>Historically looking at the results of games, Galicia occupied by the Russians in 1901 is the most common indicator of an early exit by
Austria.  Oddly enough for the Russians, to have an Austrian army in
Galicia is not as commonly associated with early Russian Death
Syndrome.  The reason for this is that when the Austrians are sucked
into Galicia they are not protecting Trieste, and the Italians often
will find it overwhelming tempting to shift to Trieste for 'defensive
development'.

<p>Galicia is an excellent springboard position for going West, and one
of my favorite AIR attacks (Austria-Italy-Russia) involves the
Russians being in Galicia in the Fall of 01 and building Army
Warsaw.  Then in the Spring of 1902 the Russians go Gal->Sil, War-
 >Pru as the Italians and the Austrians fill into Tyr/Boh.

<p>For wars between Austria and Russia, Galicia is center point of the
battle line, with flanking attacks needed to turn the tide either into
Bohemia or Sileisa in the West, or Ukraine and Rumania in the East.

<p>For stalemate lines between the East and the West, Galicia is needed
if the East wants to hold Warsaw and Moscow, whereas if they want to
go into the 14 center SE Turtle position  (Ion-Nap-Rom-Ven-Tri-Vie-
Bud-Rum-Sev) it is expendable.  However, in the decision making
process, forcing Galicia can make the difference between sitting in a
Turtle position while the game is decided clearly and safely in the
west, or sitting on the edge of the center board always threatening
the Center and having 16 centers &#8212 which makes the room for decisive action in the West less likely.

<p>Galicia is often left as a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) between Austria
and Russia, or even Italy and Russia, as the middle game progresses.
This is then the dramatic point of entry into the land of betrayal
and end game victory runs.  Therefore players in the east might want
to consider structuring the DMZ as a
dynamic DMZ, where there should be a set bounce between the sides.
This tends to pull units off the front line and slow advances to the
west; but at the same time, there is no doubt as to the increased
security value.  Players often forget about the need to put in some
physical orders to ensure trust, rather than to just leave it to the
emotions of rolling the board.  Trust, but bounce in Galicia!
