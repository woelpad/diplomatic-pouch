<blockquote><p><i>For our readers' amusement, we offer this collection of Diplomacy themed limericks by the talented Harold Reynolds!</i></p></blockquote>

<p><b>#1 &#8212; How to Win (December 1992, from the A-Z)</b><br/>
In Diplomacy to be a winner,<br/>
one must be a terrible sinner.<br/>
The teller of lies,<br/>
Grows to a frightening size,<br/>
While the virtuous only get thinner.</p>

<p><b>#2 &#8212; Mack Got the Knife (April 12, 2014)</b><br/>
A Diplomacy player named Mack<br/>
Wanted to make a pre-emptive attack.<br/>
But he had to depend<br/>
On a neighbouring "friend" -<br/>
What he got was a knife in the back.</p>

<p><b>#3 &#8212; The Angry German (April 12, 2014)</b><br/>
I got email from a desperate German<br/>
Who said "All my neighbours are vermin!<br/>
They all have the hots<br/>
For my beautiful dots<br/>
And they think that my damn name is Hermann!" (Winter, 1903)</p>

<p><b>#4 &#8212; Constantinople (April 26, 2014)</b><br/>
A woman from Constantinople<br/>
Lost her favorite jewel: an opal.<br/>
It was found by Sam Eppy,<br/>
A priest who was peppy,<br/>
And the opal is now episcopal. (Spring, 1904)</p>

<p><b>#5 &#8212; New Delhi (Youngstown Dip SC) May 10, 2014</b><br/>
People complain that New Delhi<br/>
Is crowded and noisy and smelly.<br/>
And that wild baboons<br/>
Beating Japanese goons<br/>
Is all that they show on the telly.</p>

<p><b>#6 &#8212; Walter Buchanan (adapted from one published May 17, 2014)</b><br/>
One day our friend Walter Buchanan<br/>
Got shot from the mouth of a cannon.<br/>
He said as he flew<br/>
"There must be better ways to<br/>
Go visit my lovely friend Shannon."</p>

<p><b>#7 &#8212; Undead Diplomacy (October 19, 2014)</b><br/>
Undead Diplomacy's cool<br/>
Because of the following rule.<br/>
It says when you're stabbed,<br/>
And your SCs are grabbed,<br/>
You get to come back as a ghoul.</p>

<p><b>#8 &#8212; Diplomacy Games (October 20, 2014)</b><br/>
Each Diplomacy game is a tale<br/>
Of deceit and defeat and betrayal,<br/>
Where being too nice<br/>
Is considered a vice<br/>
And results in your exile to Wales.</p>

<p><b>#9 &#8212; Jim Burgess (October 23, 2014)</b><br/>
A wonderful guy is Jim Burgess,<br/>
But he does have some terrible urges.<br/>
Though he might be gabbing,<br/>
He's thinking of stabbing,<br/>
And soon all you're saying is curses.</p>

<p><b>#10 &#8212; Costaguana (October 26, 2014)</b><br/>
The venerable zine Costaguana<br/>
Is not about pricing iguanas.<br/>
If you were asked to play,<br/>
You would probably say:<br/>
"I wanna, I wanna, I wanna!"</p>

<p><b>#11 &#8212; The Abyssinian Prince (TAP)</b><br/>
Nobody's opinion of TAP<br/>
Is that it's a huge pile of crap.<br/>
If you lifted a stack<br/>
Of all issues, your back<br/>
Would blow itself out with a snap.</p>

<p><b>#12 &#8212; Not a Waste of Time (November 8, 2014)</b><br/>
Diplomats say it's a crime<br/>
To call it the Eater of Time.<br/>
Time isn't wasted<br/>
If you're enemy's pasted<br/>
Into primorial slime.</p>

<p><b>#13 &#8212; Marseilles</b><br/>
There was a young lass in Marseilles<br/>
Whose guy wouldn't do as she'd say.<br/>
"You must support me in Spain<br/>
Or you'll feel the pain<br/>
Of a kick in the nuts every day!"</p>

<p><b>#14 &#8212 German Invasion</b><br/>
As the Germans were crossing the Rhine,<br/>
They said "We're just here for the wine.<br/>
We'll enter Burgundy<br/>
At twelve o'clock Sunday<br/>
And see you in Paris by nine."</p>

<p><b>#15 &#8212; Black Sea</b><br/>
The Black Sea is an oversized lake<br/>
Where Turkish and Russian fleets make<br/>
A battle each season<br/>
Without any reason<br/>
Except for some SCs to take.</p>

<p><b>#16 &#8212; France</b><br/>
A gentleman player of France<br/>
Couldn't get into his pants.<br/>
And when the seams ripped,<br/>
He said "I've been gypped!<br/>
This makes it much harder to dance!"</p>
