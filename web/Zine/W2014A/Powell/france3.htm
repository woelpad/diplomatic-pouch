<p>This is the third and final installment in a series of articles I have written for the DipPouch ‘Zine
concerning the play of France in the <b>1900</b> variant. The first article looked at a worst case scenario: in one
particular game France actually lost a supply center (SC) in the first game year while its three immediate
neighbors and enemies, Britain, Germany, and Italy, combined for a whopping nine (!!!) builds. France’s
first game year was such a catastrophe that it prompted the GM to write to me and express his concerns
about <b>1900</b>‘s play balance. The gist of that first article was my attempt to show that the President could
not have played more poorly if he had been deliberately trying to have the other Powers eliminate France
as quickly as possible, which, as came out after the game, was indeed his goal after he saw that his British
ally had betrayed him in the first game-turn. The second article began by examining <b>1900</b>‘s overall play
balance and comparing it to <b>Classic</b>’s play balance. I then focused on France. The data I presented
clearly showed that <b>1900</b>’s France has a much lower success rate than its <b>Classic</b> counterpart.
Francophiles everywhere might have become despondent over the Third Republic’s prospects after
reviewing the data I provided. The intent of this article is to give future Presidents hope by going over
some very basic things they can do to further the French cause.</p>
<p>Before I get started, I want to ensure everyone understands that there is no magic formula that will
guarantee French success any more than there is a sure way to take the other Great Powers in <b>1900</b> to
victory. First and foremost, the key to success in <b>1900</b>, as in <b>Classic</b> and any other Diplomacy variant, is
a good grasp of tactics and strategy, and solid negotiations that persuade other players to act in concert
with your own agendas. In the <a href="/Online/variants/1900-061119.pdf">Gamers’ Guide to 1900</a>, I borrowed a quote from D.J. Goodspeed’s
excellent book <i><u>The German Wars: 1914-1945</u></i>. Goodspeed commented that “The historian is almost
tempted to conclude that between 1890 and 1914 France possessed the only really skillful diplomats in
Europe.” There is no doubt in my mind that the President will have to work just as hard as his or her
historical counterparts did to give the Third Republic its best chance of succeeding in the cutthroat
environment that the <b>1900</b> variant presents.</p>
<p>So, without any further ado, let us address those items that should occupy the President’s attention as he
or she starts a <b>1900</b> game.</p>
<p><b>Take care of business in the Western Triangle.</b>  I have mentioned elsewhere that <b>Classic</b>’s basic
dynamic focuses on the interrelations within two triangles: E/F/G and A/R/T.  Italy interacts with both
triangles, but is not truly a part of either.   <b>1900</b>’s basic dynamic is different.  It consists of two
overlapping and unequal quadrangles: B/F/G/I and A/G/R/T.  What makes these quadrangles unequal is
that two members in each quadrangle, B/I in the west and G/T in the east, have little or no ability to
support or attack each other in the early going.</p>
<p>Despite the different dynamic, the fact remains that the equivalent of <b>Classic</b>’s western triangle, B/F/G,
still exists in <b>1900</b>.  Though relations with Italy are extremely important to the decision makers in Paris, I
want to focus on the Third Republic’s relations with Britain and Germany first because success within the
B/F/G triangle is paramount.  Just as in <b>Classic</b>, the absolute, most important, “cannot fail” mission for
any President at game-start is to ensure France is not the odd power out (OPO) in the western triangle.  If
France faces a B/G at game-start, its chances for success are severely impaired.  This is true even if the
President can count on the Pope’s friendship because Italy is simply not well positioned to assist France
against B/G.  Indeed, just the opposite is true: Italy is supremely well positioned to jump on the pile when
France starts to falter under the B/G assault.</p>
<p>If the President can secure an alliance with Britain or Germany (or both!), a world of possibilities opens
up.  At worst, the OPO in the west, Britain or Germany, allies with Italy and the west stalemates until an
eastern Power intervenes.  At best, France and its ally quickly overwhelm the OPO.  If this occurs, France
can continue working with its ally to move eastward (usually in conjunction with an eastern Power) or
begin working with Italy (and usually an eastern Power) against its former ally.  Of course, the President
must once again ensure that France is not the OPO in the new western triangle consisting of France,
Britain or Germany, and Italy, but the overall French position is likely to be stronger than it was at game-
start because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><i>Arm&#233;e d’Afrique</i>, which began the game isolated in Algeria, a SC France cannot build in, should nowbe in contact with other French units;</p></li>
<li><p>French units should be on the front and poised to advance instead of backing away from the front to
capture neutrals like they were at game-start;</p></li>
<li><p>if allied with Germany, France should have achieved a true corner position; and</p></li>
<li><p>Britain or Germany, each one of the strongest Powers on the map at game-start, should be gone or
reduced to impotence.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What are French chances of avoiding the dreaded OPO role within the western triangle?  If the western
triangle was perfectly balanced, we would expect a B/F or an F/G to emerge approximately two games
out of three in a large number of games.  Of course, the western triangle is not perfectly balanced.  Given
this, the President must strive to ensure the Prime Minister and Kaiser believe it is to their advantage to
ally with France instead of attack France.  I will not go into the pros and cons of B/F and F/G here, as
they are covered in detail in the <a href="/Online/variants/1900-061119.pdf">Gamers’ Guide to 1900</a>.  Instead I will simply say that the President
should have no trouble making a strong case for France.</p>
<p><b>Neutralize Italy.</b>  The general perception amongst the <b>1900</b> community is that Italy’s orientation is
westward and that France and Italy are exponentially more likely to come to blows than they are to
cooperate.  A quick examination of the results of the two hundred thirty-one completed games that I have
recorded as of the writing of this article appears to support this position.  Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Only nine games have ended with France and Italy both participating in the same draw.  By
comparison, Italy has participated in a draw with its immediate eastern neighbor, Austria-Hungary,
twenty-seven times.</p></li>
<li><p>The unit that best signals Italy’s intentions at game-start is A Rome.  If A Rome opens to Piedmont,
this generally signals that the Pope’s relations with the President are cautious at best and openly hostile at
worst.  A Rome to Piedmont has occurred in 49.2% of the games that I have recorded.  Needless to say,
Italian armies in both Piedmont and Switzerland at the end of the Spring ’00 turn probably do not bode
well for Franco-Italian friendship.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>These numbers do not tell the whole story, however.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Though Austro-Hungarian and Italian relations can frequently be cordial, the same cannot be said of
Italian-Turkish relations.  Italy and Turkey have both participated in the same draw just ten times.  This
certainly suggests that Italian and Turkish conflict is every bit as likely and lethal as war between France
and Italy is.</p></li>
<li><p>If A Rome opens to Piedmont 49.2% of the time, it is opening in a manner that suggests neutrality
towards France or possible hostility towards Austria-Hungary 50.8% of the time (A Rome to Apulia
15.9%, A Rome H 1.9%, A Rome to Milan 11.6%, A Rome to Naples 11.6%, or A Rome to Venetia
9.8%).</p></li>
<li><p>Italy conquers Greece before any other Great Power does 44.6% of the time.  An Italian fleet or army
in Greece is sure to capture the attention of the Sultan, as well as the attention of the Archduke and Tsar.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>So what can we take from all of the above?  I would sum it up as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the Pope believes a B/G is forming against France, the President rubs the Pope the wrong way, or
France opens in a manner that is blatantly hostile towards Italy (e.g., A Marseilles to Piedmont or
Switzerland, A Algeria to Tunisia), the odds are extremely high that war between the Third Republic and
the Kingdom of Italy is likely to follow.</p></li>
<li><p>If, however, there is no solid evidence of a B/G, the President comes off as friendly, and France
avoids provoking Italy with its opening moves, then there is every reason to believe that Italy will pursue
its genuine interests in the central and eastern Mediterranean.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Trying to balance the demands created by an alliance with Britain or Germany with a sincere desire to
maintain benign neutrality or an alliance with Italy will likely force the President to face decisions at
game-start that would challenge a Solomon.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If the President believes France has a game-start alliance with Britain against Germany, then he or
she should expect the Prime Minister to be gung-ho about an Anglo-Frankish attack on Tripolitania.
French failure to promise support for British F Cyrenaica to Tripolitania in Fall ’00 (and remember
Britain opens with F Egypt to Cyrenaica 43.2% of the time) could derail relations with London before
they even get started.  The best the President may be able to do is order A Algeria to South Algeria (never
Tunisia) and see what shakes out after the Spring ’00 moves.  If Britain opened as expected and Turkey
opened with A Constantinople to Bulgaria instead of to Macedonia, the President can advise the Pope to
go for Greece in Fall ’00, provide the support the Prime Minister wants into Cyrenaica, and maintain the
appearance of friendship to both Britain and Italy for at least another turn.</p></li>
<li><p>If the President believes he or she has an alliance with Germany against Britain, then he or she may
have to deal with an offer (or demand) from the Kaiser for support into Switzerland in Spring ’00.  Such
an offer (or demand) puts the President in a tough position because there is little room for equivocation.
The President may be able to convince the Kaiser that letting Italy have Switzerland is in the alliance’s
best interest by arguing that an F/G attack on Switzerland will almost certainly drive Italy into the open
arms of Britain and that France is the partner in F/G that will bear the brunt of the Anglo-Italian war
effort.  A reasonable Kaiser should be willing to take French concerns to heart.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Throughout the negotiations with Britain and Germany, the President must carefully weigh the risks of
keeping the Pope “in the loop.”  Maintaining an open and ongoing dialog with Rome may build trust and
cement a relationship, but it might reveal plans that Paris intended to keep secret.  The opposite scenarios
are equally plausible.  Being tight-lipped with Rome may prevent vital French intelligence from leaking,
but it could result in growing Italian suspicions and mistrust over the President’s intentions.  It is
admittedly a tough call, but that is why Presidents are paid the big bucks.</p>
<p>Always keep in mind, though, that relations with Italy are secondary to cementing an alliance with either
Britain or Germany.  If Franco-Italian hostility is the price the President must pay to secure that all
important alliance with the British or Germans, then hostility it must be.  If war with Italy is inevitable,
the President can take some comfort in knowing that B/F or F/G can take actions that will place the Pope
on his back foot at game-start and lessen the impact of the inevitable Italian riposte.</p>
<p><b>Avoid the “African Trap.”</b>  I mentioned in my last article that French prospects for early builds look
good at first glance (+2 38.0%, +3 18.2%),  but we must keep in mind that one of these builds usually
comes from an SC <i>Arm&#233;e d'Afrique</i> captured in North Africa.  Algeria is not a French home SC, which
means the resulting build must appear in Metropolitan France.  This creates the generally untenable
position where France has to defend two North African SCs with only one unit.  I say this position is
“generally untenable” because France will frequently find itself fighting Britain and/or Italy.  Both of
these Great Powers will have naval units in the vicinity of French North Africa that can seize the SC
<i>Arm&#233;e d'Afrique</i> does not protect.  This might mean that the President has to remove a unit from
Metropolitan France when the loss of even a single unit could be critical.  Even worse from a French
perspective, Britain and particularly Italy can use the build they got from capturing a French North
African SC to reinforce their Mediterranean position and eventually overpower <i>Arm&#233;e d’Afrique</i>.  If the
President removed <i>Arm&#233;e d’Afrique</i> after losing the first North African SC to avoid stripping units from
the front in France, the easy capture of the second North African SC could prove the beginning of the end.</p>
<p>The above paragraph may lead some to believe that I advocate France passing up the opportunity to get an
easy build by taking Morocco or Tripolitania.  This is not the case, though I do believe using <i>Arm&#233;e d’Afrique</i> to gain a build should be more calculated and less a reflex action.  What do I mean by
“calculated”?  I primarily mean that the President must appreciate that his or her hold on SCs in French
North Africa is tenuous at game-start and that he or she should plan accordingly.  Let us explore the
options the President has.</p>
<p>An alliance with Britain immediately strengthens the French position in North Africa, as the British can
immediately provide the Mediterranean flotilla to keep the <i>Regina Marina</i> at bay.  I have seen many
games in which Britain and France hold all four of the SCs on the North African coast.  I still believe the
President must be wary of overextending <i>Arm&#233;e d’Afrique</i> to avoid making French possessions in Africa
look like an easy target for a British stab, but this becomes a matter of risk management.</p>
<p>Alliance with Britain certainly facilitates the President’s efforts to either to reinforce the French position
in North Africa or pull out entirely.</p>
<p>Consider that France opens with F Brest to Mid-Atlantic Ocean in approximately 58.5% of its games.
Somewhat to my surprise, F Mid-Atlantic Ocean seems to end up in Iberia (usually Portugal) the vast
majority of the time.  If the President and Prime Minister agree to split the Mediterranean, it makes sense
to me to move F Mid-Atlantic Ocean to Morocco.  From there, the President can move the French fleet
into the Mediterranean itself.  Having a <i>La Royale</i> unit sitting in the Western Mediterranean Sea makes
the French position in western North Africa and Iberia much more secure defensively, especially if Italy
is hostile, as Italy is likely to be in this particular scenario.  It also gives France more offensive flexibility
because the fleet can move eastward in tandem with <i>Arm&#233;e d’Afrique</i> or convoy the army to the European
continent, perhaps Italy itself.</p>
<p>If the President wants to keep his options open with regard to Italy or he believes abandoning North
Africa will cement an alliance with Britain by providing promises of territorial gain and reducing the
inherent conflict that exists in an Anglo-French alliance, he or she might suggest that Britain take control
of French North Africa.  B/F can easily contrive to give Britain a commanding position in the
Mediterranean by having Britain’s F Gibraltar move to Western Mediterranean in Spring ‘00, while
<i>Arm&#233;e d'Afrique</i> moves from Algeria to Morocco.  In Fall ’00, Britain takes Algeria, while Armée
d’Afrique holds.  Though France does not get a build out of this unit shuffling, there are some advantages
to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>These moves should help ensure that all of Iberia falls firmly under French control by keeping
British eyes focused on other prizes besides Portugal and Spain.  Assuming A Marseilles is able to
capture Spain in ’00, the President can move <i>Arm&#233;e d'Afrique</i> from Morocco to Gibraltar in Spring ’01
while A Spain marches to Portugal.  This will likely give France a momentum boosting build at the end of
’01.  <i>Arm&#233;e d’Afrique</i> can then either continue marching north into France itself or the two Iberian armies
can support each other as a deterrent to British perfidy.</p></li>
<li><p>In return for such “selflessness,” the President can demand British support to French units contesting
the German position in the Low Countries and northern Germany.  If the Kaiser uses the standard German
openings (F Kiel to Denmark, A Berlin to Kiel, A Cologne to Belgium, and A Munich either hold or do
something involving Switzerland), then French prospects of capturing Belgium are quite good.</p></li>
<li><p>If French units abandon North Africa and British units move into the Mediterranean in strength, it
seems likely that the Pope will focus his efforts against the immediate British threat rather than on a
France that (secretly) promises neutrality. </p></li>
<li><p>The President may be able to talk the Prime Minister into allowing him to keep Morocco until such
time as France will still get a build even if it loses Morocco.  After all, is this not what good allies do for
each other?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>What if Britain is not friendly at game-start?  One thing the President can do to mitigate against Rome
teaming up with London is to tell the Pope that France recognizes Italy’s inherent interests in Switzerland
and the Mediterranean.  To demonstrate his or her good intentions towards Italy, the President will move
<i>Arm&#233;e d’Afrique</i> west and out of Africa as quickly as the situation allows.  The President would then
attempt to move <i>Arm&#233;e d’Afrique</i> to Morocco and ultimately Iberia in the manner I described earlier.
With French promises that it will surrender Algeria and Morocco peacefully, Rome may be much more
inclined to bank these builds and pursue its interests in the Eastern Mediterranean.  Though France stands
to gain little materially from such an arrangement, the diplomatic capital France potentially gains in Rome
might come in handy when British and Italian units start co-mingling in <i>Mare Nostrum</i>.  If Britain grabs
Morocco and Algeria for itself, the Pope might view the British capture of SCs he was counting on as
sufficient justification for war with Albion.</p>
<p>I realize my suggestion that the President consider abandoning North Africa is a slap in the face to French
elan, but I will go back to something I stated earlier.  The French position in North Africa is tenuous at
game-start.  It may be wiser for the President to follow a Bismarkian <i>Realpolitik</i> approach than trundle
down a path that satisfies French pride, but accomplishes little else.</p>
<p><b>Do not ignore the East.</b>  I will not spend a lot of time on this topic because any advice I offer here strikes
me as self-evident.  It only takes a quick look at the map to confirm that France has virtually no direct
contact with Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Turkey at game-start, while its western rivals all pose a
potential threat to at least two of their eastern neighbors.  This fact of geography allows the President to
talk with Vienna, St. Petersburg, and Constantinople on good terms and in equal measure, and to offer
itself as a good partner in a potential triple alliance.</p>
<p>If alliance with Britain appears promising and war with the Second Reich seems probable, France should
help broker an alliance between Austria-Hungary and Russia.  The merits of a game-start A/R against
Germany is a topic I intend to discuss in a future article, but it will suffice to say here that seeing red and
white blocks moving west (A Vienna to Bohemia, A Trieste to Tyrolia, and A Warsaw to Silesia) will
likely throw cold water on any German attack on the Third Republic.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, alliance with Germany seems in the offing and relations with Britain are chilly,
Paris should use whatever influence it has in St. Petersburg and Constantinople to encourage Russo-
Turkish cooperation.  In particular is should suggest an aggressive opening against Britain.  A Russian
opening of A Moscow to St. Petersburg and a Turkish opening of A Damascus to Palestine are likely to
cause the Prime Minister to break out into a cold sweat, particularly if he or she used the Blitz in Spring
’00 (F London to English Channel, F Edinburgh to North Sea, F Egypt to Mid-Atlantic Ocean, and F
Gibraltar S F Egypt to Mid-Atlantic Ocean).</p>
<p>If Italy seems unreceptive to French overtures, Paris should work to bring Austria-Hungary and Turkey
together against the common Italian foe.  The Sultan should need little encouragement to curb Italian
growth, as overall Italian success often comes at Turkey’s expense.  In particular, the President should
encourage the Sultan to open A Constantinople to Macedonia instead of to Bulgaria.  This makes the
Italian conquest of Greece far less certain (and is really a better opening for the Sultan in any case).  As
for Austria-Hungary, it is highly unlikely the President will be able to convince the Archduke to open
with A Trieste to Venetia (it has happened only seven times in the games I have recorded) even though
such an opening is not without promise for Austria-Hungary.  If a game-start attack on Italy is not in
Vienna’s plans, the Archduke might be persuaded to look west in 1901 if the first game year went well
from his perspective.  The panic an Austro-Hungarian thrust into Italy might create in Rome may cause
the Pope to be much less belligerent towards his French neighbor.</p>
<p>In summary, let me underscore the fact that <b>1900</b>’s France is the weak sister in the west.  This reality
actually mirrors the historical situation that existed at the dawn of the 20th century.  Given the relative
frailty of the French position at game-start, it does no good for the President to act the bully, to be
intransigent, or to make threats.  Instead, the President must be the consummate diplomat.  He or she must
talk to everyone and quickly get a good read on everyone’s mood.  The President must also be active,
pragmatic, and flexible, as the road to mid-game and possible victory is seldom straight or easy.  The
simple truth is that France is quite capable of earning a share of a draw or claiming a solo outright.  To do
so, however, it must survive the game’s early turns.  My hope is that I have given future Presidents some
insights that will allow them to take Marianne to the victory ball after the fighting stops.</p>
