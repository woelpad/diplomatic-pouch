<p>I realized  not long ago that many Dippers today have never played the game with a human games master. They only know the judge and related computer adjudicated versions of <b>Diplomacy</b>. That thought led me to wonder, “When will artificial intelligent devices (e.g. RoboDippers) become viable players in either computer adjudicated or even FTF <b>Diplomacy</b> games?
Imagine sitting down to a table of <b>Diplomacy</b> with players that look like R2D2 or one of those cute little humanoid robots you in see in Japanese ads? Could it happen here?</p>

<p>I grew up on a diet of science fiction fed by the likes of Heinlein, Clarke, Asimov, Bradbury, Ellison, Greene and Norton. In fact, in the 1960s I helped introduce Heinlein and Asimov to <b>Diplomacy</b>; and I hotly debated the relative merits of “science” and “fiction” with  Ellison at one of the earliest sci-fi cons; so the idea of robots of some kind playing <b>Diplomacy</b> didn’t seem strange to me. The question was, ‘How good would they be?”</p>

<p>When I raised the question of “Whether robots would replace humans at DipCons in the next 20 years?” with other hobbyists the consensus seemed to be:</p> 
<ol type="n">
<li>Artificial intelligence at the tactical level (e.g. making the best or correct choice out of a variety of options has been mastered;</li>
<li>The creation of an artificial personality that can master negotiating has not;</li>
<li>Can a computer or robot know the difference between right and wrong, and is that relevant in a game like <b>Diplomacy</b>? I was thinking of Asimov’s basic law that robots cannot harm humans and the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey and Hal were as vivid today as they were in the 1960s.</li>
<li>The quirkiness or “unpredictability” factor was also an issue.</li>
</ol>

<p>And finally, I wondered, “Is <b>Diplomacy</b> a zero-sum-game or a non-zero-sum –game?” When I asked that on Facebook I got a lot of replies. You can read them yourself.</p>
<p>For the moment it seems human Dippers are reasonably safe from RoboDippers. Isn’t that good to know?</p>
