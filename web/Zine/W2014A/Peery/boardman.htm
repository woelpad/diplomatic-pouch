<p>When I first contemplated writing this article I was sad because I knew the number of new postal Diplomacy game starts last year had dropped to one, 2014A. That fact made me realize two things: 1) The postal Diplomacy hobby as I have known it for some fifty years was, for all practical purposes, nearly dead; and 2) that meant the hobby’s oldest custodial position, the Boardman Number Custodian (BNC), was almost obsolete. I also realized that I didn’t even know who the current BNC was, assuming there was one. And it dawned on me that the number of people active in the hobby who were still playing postal Diplomacy games was shrinking fast; and that by far most Diplomacy players today have never experienced postal Diplomacy as I knew it and, indeed, many of them probably don’t even know that there was a postal Diplomacy hobby before the advent of computers, the internet, and the computerized game adjudication systems commonly called judge.</p>

<p>And so with the help of a few hobby Old Farts I tracked down the current BNC, Tom Howell. Tom obviously is still doing what the BNC was established to do --- keeping track of the hobby’s statistical records (e.g. game starts, game names (if any), game number assignments,  game masters, publications, players of record, and game results). It’s just that today there’s not much for him to do.</p>

<p>Tom provided almost all the information in this article and for that I thank him. Without it this story wouldn’t have been written and it could have happened that the BNC would have faded away into obscurity like so many other hobby institutions; and that would have been a shame. However, after some reflection I realize this should not be an occasion for sadness but rather an appreciation for the change that has taken place in the hobby. It is that change from postal to electronic mail that has kept the hobby not only going but expanding and even enjoying a mini-boom of sorts. So, let’s look back not with anger or regret, but with pride and happiness.</p>

<p>What follows are several emails I exchanged with Tom that basically tell the story of the BNC in the last few years, some history and a bit of Tom’s story as well. I decided not to delete some of the personal comments in our emails that deal with health issues, etc. because I think these help show that the BNC was and is not only a statistician but also a human being and that we are, like the BNC position, getting older and more frail as the years go by.</p>

<p>Another purpose in publishing this in this form is to provide the future custodians of the PBEM hobby with a model for how they can do what people like Tom and I have been doing for the last fifty years. For instance, Tom alludes to the fact that he doesn’t know much about the PBEM hobby or have much contact with the international hobby. That’s a shame but it’s also a concern. It raised the question in my mind, is anybody keeping track on a worldwide hobby basis of PBEM Diplomacy game records? Additionally, are the various national hobbies keeping track of their own records. This particularly concerns me about the revitalized or new hobbies in places like South Africa or China? I know from past experience how difficult it is to reconstruct the early years of a hobby, so I hope these hobbies will learn from our mistakes.</p>

<blockquote><p>peery@ix.netcom.com wrote in his first email:</p>

<p>Hej Tom. Does this email work?
I'm told you're the BNC and you've only listed one BNC number this year? Correct? How about last year?
Can you give me the details on the game start? I asked JB but he said I should ask you. (Don't ask.)
Also, do you know is there anybody doing the BNC kind of thing for the judge and PBEM games in totality or is it every system for itself?
Thanx</blockquote>


<p>Tom’s first reply:</p>

<blockquote><p>Sorry, I haven't been ignoring you, I've been flat on my back with the
latest nasty bug that's been going around.</p>

<p>Yes, this e-address works.  I'm the North American postal BNC.</p>

<p>I don't know very much about the electronic Dip hobby.  You should
inquire of Chris Babcock <a href="mailto:cbabcock@asciiking.com">cbabcock@asciiking.com</a></p>

<p>I'm not in contact with any European Dip Zine publishers, but I have the
impression that most of them are not registering with a Boardman Number
Custodian.</p>

<p>Here are the North American postal game starts for the last five years.</p>

<p><i><b>Peery notes:</b> I played in 2013A, Sweet Spot, as Turkey. It was my first PBEM Diplomacy game in many, many years; and I thoroughly enjoyed it because it let me touch base with old friends like Melinda Holley and Jack McHugh and make some new ones like Heath Gardener and Chris Babcock, who I’ve worked with on TDP for years. Unfortunately, in my opinion the game ended much too soon in a five way draw, but that was a tribute to Hank Alme’s outstanding play.</i></p></blockquote>


<p>Peery replied in his second email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Thanx a heap for the info, even if it is sad. Well, perhaps not so much sad as a mark of progress.</p>
<p>Seeing your info gave me an idea for an article for DW or TDP or both. I wish I had the energy or time to write up a real history of the BNC but at least I can cover its winding down.</p>
<p>Here's how you can help:</p>
<ol type="n">
<li>I need Lischett, Bolduc, and Lesco's emails.
</li><li>I need your thoughts on the BNC role in the hobby's past and present. Just a general over-view so if someone reads it 50 years from now they'll understand what it was all about and how important it was. I've always used the analogy that the games were the bricks and the BNC numbers were the mortar that held the hobby together.
</li><li>If you have the players' list and contact info for those players in the games from 2010A on that would be a big help. I don't plan to bother them all but I'm looking to see who is still around from the old days.
</li><li>A long shot, but do you have a complete list of the BN Custodians and their dates.
</li><li>This may be pure ignorance on my part but I don't recall it: is there a site on line that lists as the BNC data since 1964A? I wonder if anybody ever did that?</li>
</ol>
<p>Amazing. Boggles the mind.</p>
<p>Thanx heaps.</p></blockquote>

<p>Tom Howell replied in his second email:</p>

<blockquote><p>Personally, I tend to discount what doctors tell me.  I have a-fib, and
as far as I can tell, the only thing that triggers it is my getting
dehydrated.  Acute dehydration will almost always start up a-fib, and I
don't recall an episode when I wasn't dehydrated.  Dehydration is
something that has always been a problem, but now I seriously have to
watch my hydration level. If I haven't stayed hydrated and start into an
episode, first I force water down, then I go for a long walk.  In
general, I don't get enough exercise, but when I am exercising, it
definitely seems to help the heart stay on schedule.</p>
   
<p>If your doctor didn't tell you, there is a tendency for folks to have
more frequent episodes of a-fib as they go along.  If that's the case,
it can become so bad that it becomes very difficult to get the heart
back to a normal pace.  You probably know how to take your own pulse.  I
would suggest you start taking it regularly, several times a day - or
more frequently.  As you monitor your pulse, you may find that you can
tell, without your finger on an artery, generally when you are quiet,
that you can sense the general speed of your heart beat.  This is a good
thing.  If you find it very fast when you aren't exercising, you're in
a-fib.  If this happens, try to correlate it with something that may
have caused it.  You may have causes different from mine.  When you
figure out the likely triggers, then the thing to do is whatever will
remove those conditions.  Hope this helps.</p>

<p>As for the hobby stuff:  You don't want much do you?</p>


<p><i><b>Peery notes:</b> I always ask for the moon and am happy to get a bit of green cheese. Fortunately, Tom replied with a wheel of Limburger! (Peerlblah trivia: I might note my ancestors are from Peer in the Limburg area of Belgium. If you’re curious about what Limburger cheese smells like the only company in the USA that makes it is Chalet Cheese Co-op located outside (downwind, I hope) of Monroe, Wisconsin. Some people say it smells like sewage. Others say it smells like a dirty dog. And a few experts claim it smells like horse poo. Let me know what you (s)tink.</i></p>

<p>Uncle Connie is pretty knowledgeable about the history of the BNC.  And
much more entertaining a writer than I.</p>

<p>Also, you could google for "MEINEL'S Encyclopedia of Postal Diplomacy
Zines", which contains some useful information.</p>

<p>Andy Lischett:   andy@lischett.com   <- Andy is very regular at getting
out game reports:  one, or two pages.<br/>
Rob Lesco:       rlesco@yahoo.com    <- Rob gets one or two reports out
annually, but his games seem to continue on.<br/>
Jim Burgess:     jfburgess@gmail.com <- Jim has been making noises about
taking over for Doug Kent when he stops publishing.<br/>
Paul Bolduc                          <- died recently of cancer</p>

<p>In general, the player's contact info is not in my Boardman and
Everything databases.  The contact information I do have is in my e-mail
address book.  However, you might have some contacts yourself already,
and Doug Kent would be a good source.  So:  What I can easily give you
is a list of players currently playing in games started after 2011.  All
the 2010 and 2011 games have finished except 2010C and I don't know if
someone picked that up after Paul died.  I'm also behind on getting data
into the database.  Which means that you'll recognize a couple of names
whose owners are no longer among the living, and some of these guys may
have been eliminated, dropped or replaced.</p>

<p><i><b>Peery Notes:</b> I’ve been lucky enough to know all of these people and worked with many over the years. I was always amazed at how hard they worked on their often thankless task, especially in the Golden Days of Postal Diplomacy when there were scores or even hundreds of game starts per year. I remember talking about this to Kathy Byrne Caruso. She told me she hated being BNC (She was a bookkeeper by profession.) because it was too much like work, but she did it because of her love for the game and hobby. I think that pretty much sums up every BNC’s innermost thoughts. I wonder what Tom thinks? Special mention should be made of Conrad von Mezke’s seven years as BNC and for having had the courage to tackle the job twice!</i></p>

<p>As for your long shot:  Chris Babcock and I have been sporadically
working on that.  I don't have time to work on it currently, but hope to
get back to it after the house is finished.  The biggest problem is data
entry.  I have a bare bones website built in python, all the games from
the BNC's journals are indexed, but only a small fraction of them have
their game results entered.  I got through about the mid-70 before
other priorities pushed the project aside.  The web site, if on-line,
would allow anyone to enter results for games which are known to be
complete, but do not have their results on-line.</p>

<p>Don't want to do much writing, but I'll provide any information that I
have.  Just ask: if I don't know I'll say so and try to send you to
someone who may know.</p>

<p><i><b>Peery Notes:</b> The hobby literature, particularly <i><u>Diplomacy World</u></i> in its early years, is full of information by and about the BNC and his or her work. Many of the BNCs published their own ‘zine devoted to their work and those can be found in Doug Kent’s Archives.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And there you have it, an update on one of the hobby’s most important institutions. The question is, who is going to step up to the plate and take on that task for the PBEM hobby?</p>
