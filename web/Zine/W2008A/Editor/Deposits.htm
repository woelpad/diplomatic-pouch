<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Mail Received Concerning<BR><A HREF="/Zine/S2008M/Editor/bismark1.htm">The Bismark Papers, Lecture I</A>
</H3>
<HR>
<H4>From Tom Carr-Griffen (<A HREF="mailto:tbreak@hotmail.co.uk">tbreak@hotmail.co.uk</A>):</H4>
<p>Dear Sir,
<p>I am an absolute newbie to the game of <b>Diplomacy</b> in all its forms, and have been enjoying reading through <a href="/Zine/F2008R">this Retreat issue</a>. I write merely to say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading the Bismark lectures this morning, finding them both entertaining and thought provoking. I have just started playing face to face <b>Diplomacy</b> with my 'cell' mates. We are living in a somewhat out of the way school in China, in rather close confines. Having read these lectures I am now debating the wisdom of this.
<p>One segment in particular made me think:
<blockquote><i>So you want to play <b>Diplomacy</b>? Try this quick quiz:
<ol>
<li>Would you steal from your mother?
<li>Could you lie plausibly even under a lie detector test?
<li>Consider this well known expression: <i>"It's not whether you win or
lose, it's how you play the game."</i> Does this strike you as weak-kneed and
limp-wristed?
</ol>
<p>If you have answered yes to all three of the above &#8212 congratulations! You are in the right place.
</i></blockquote>
<p>I answered no to all of these questions; but I was lying. I rather felt that this was one better.
<p>Thank you for the easy availability of the issue, and I look forward to reading more.

<p>Edi Birsan has been in touch to refute my suggestion that I may have been the world's first to achieve wins in Postal Diplomacy with all 7 countries. Edi achieved that in the USA many years earlier. I've written the below about Edi -
<blockquote><i>In the 1970s I became involved in the DIPLOMACY and POSTAL GAMES hobby. Through that I met FLIGHT LIEUTENANT ALLAN OVENS. Allan was based at Bishopscourt, Co Down, an RAF base later closed down. Once we ate at the mess in Bishopscourt and watched the World Cup soccer final afterwards.
<p>Allan drove me to the national convention in Nottingham. I won through to the final of the Diplomacy cometition and met EDI ‘THE STAB’ BIRSAN, a well-known figure in the US Diplomacy hobby at the time.
<p>See

<H4>From Edi Birsan (<A HREF="mailto:EdiBirsan@astound.net">EdiBirsan@astound.net</A>):</H4>
<p>My nicknames in the <b>Diplomacy</b> hobby at the time (1970's) were rather varied, but they were not Edi 'The Stab' Birsan.
<p>More accurately they were:
<ul><li>BirSauron<li>Lord of Darkness<li>Bane of Elves Eater of Chickens (mostly fried)<li>Wielder of the Browning Automatic Knife.
</ul>
<p>Just for the record.

<p>Hi all,
<p>The first issue of my new web zine, <u><i>Th' Edge of Th' Abyss</i></u>, is now
available to download at:
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/abyss1.pdf"><b>http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/abyss1.pdf</b></a>
<p>Special thanks to Douglas Kent, editor of 'Diplomacy World'
(<a href="http://www.diplomacyworld.net/"><b>http://www.diplomacyworld.net/</b></a>) and the zine 'Eternal Sunshine'
(<a href="http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/"><b>http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/</b></a>), for kindly providing TEOTA with
an online home.
<p>Let me know what you think. And apologies for the lack of <b>Diplomacy</b>
content in advance &#8212 time constraints meant I am still working on
those articles. This *will* be addressed next issue and hopefully the
contents of issue 1 will be enough to entertain!  I do have game
openings available for anyone interested in a game of postal
diplomacy.
