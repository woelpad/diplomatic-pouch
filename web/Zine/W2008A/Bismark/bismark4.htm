<blockquote><p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> This is the fourth in a series  of articles written anonymously back in the late 1980's in Australia. We introduced <a href="../../S2008M/Editor/bismark1.htm">the first Bismark lecture</a> at the beginning of this year, and followed this debut with the <a href="../../F2008M/Editor/BISMARK2.HTM">second</a> and <a href="../../F2008R/Bismark/bismark3.htm">third</a> articles in subsequent issues. In this issue's instalment, the professor discusses how to make the most of your forthcoming elimination in a game of <b>Diplomacy</b>. Rage, rage against the dying of the light!</i></blockquote>

<p>My sick friends,

<p>Today we address the ultimate question with which every <b>Diplomacy</b> player
must grapple &#8212 the acknowledgement of fallibility, the heady tumble from
Godhead. Yes, I'm talking about the only death experience that counts, face
to face with the <b>Diplomacy</b> board. Winston Churchill is said to have uttered
on his deathbed, "At last, the final mystery. Jesus, I'd give anything for a
cigar". To Alice B. Toklas' enquiry, "What's the answer? What's the answer?"
A dying Gertrude Stein gasped, "What's the question?"

<p>The question of course, as any good <b>Diplomacy</b> player will tell you, is to
make the most of your demise.

<p>I have always maintained that any idiot can win a <b>Diplomacy</b> games (indeed,
they frequently do). Howeverm it takes a player with balls to skillfully and
intelligently lose a game. The latter endeavour requires attributes which
can be basically summed up in the words of the US astronaut program as the
"right stuff".

<p>In order to establish what exactly is the right stuff, we should first
examine what isn't. It is common these days to see a losing player
succumbing to apathy. They tend to distance themselves from the game in
order to distance themselves against the hurt of loss. The signs of this
erosion of morale are obvious; look for the supposed boredom, the faked
stifled yawn, the sudden interest in an a adjacent game (any game in fact,
apart from the one in which the player is losing) and, of course, aloof
sarcasm (e.g. "There is no point in negotiating with liars, I'll leave my
centers open this move, sort it out amongst yourselves") and so on. These are the
hallmarks of a diplomatic sheep &#8212 he is telegraphing to his opponents that
he will meekly follow them to
the abattoir and wait in line for butchering at their convenience. To my
mind there is nothing more useless than this attitude.

<p>Some people might say, why bother persisting with a lost game? After all, in
top level Chess, for example, it is the done thing to resign when one see
the writing on the wall &#8212 Only the Chess amateur plays out a lost game.
This where Chess and <b>Diplomacy</b> part company. The dying <b>Diplomacy</b> player must
give no indication of resigning or even losing heart; he must negotiate,
plan and execute moves as energetically and decisively as he did when he was
winning the game, and impressing the opposition with his impersonation of
Joseph Stalin on a bad day. 

<p> The object of this is two fold. Firstly, in
<b>Diplomacy</b>, we never ever give up because circumstances can change
dramatically. The opposition can commit errors from overconfidence, and of
course there is always the possibility of divine intervention, particularly
if you are in the vicinity of the San Andreas Fault, for example. Secondly,
in order for circumstances to change dramatically (as mentioned above) you
must appear to be a force in the game as this may well swing a player in
favour of entering the fray on your side. Remember, if your attacker is
making significant advances against you, someone must be perturbed about it.
The <b>Diplomacy</b> world is a balanced world &#8212 when one country is gaining
provinces another is dying, the scales have been strongly tipped, and there
must be countries around you interested in trying to right the balance. In
the words of the Immortal Bard (and I speak here of Shakespeare, not
Bismark) &#8212 "The world is out of joint; O cursed spite, that ever I was born
to set it right." (Hamlet). Here is your potential ally, your last throw of
the dice. Seek him out, woo him, heighten his fears. The skillful player at
death's door never stops selling ideas and trading information to friend and
foe alike (indeed, they are so alike as to be interchangeable in this great
game of ours). One never knows when the village idiot is actually going to
believe the horse manure you are frantically shoveling.
<p>Beyond the hope of survival and resurgence, we go on playing out a losing
game for other compelling reasons. These may be summed up in the statement
that no single game should be examined in isolation. It must be viewed as
another link in the chain of your diplomatic status. We are not talking stab
or any other ratings system here, but the most important measurement of all
&#8212 how do the other players, your future allies and enemies view your
performance? It is crucial that, even in defeat, you command respect and
fear. The opposition must walk away from the game with the impression that
you are a demon when cornered and can be relied upon to fight a tough dirty
campaign. The successful transmission of this message is a means of
fashioning a victory, of a kind, out of your defeat &#8212 you have lost the
battle, but set up the conditions which may assist you in winning the war. To
those of us who view <b>Diplomacy</b> as calling rather than "just a game", each
and every game is a preparation for the next. Like a presidential candidate
on the on the campaign trail, every stopover is important and we must expect
reverses as the bandwagon rolls on towards its inexorable goal. And what is
the goal for the <b>Diplomacy</b> disciple? Total world domination of course &#8212 the
World Championships, every scalp going, every tin cup and shield up for
grabs.
<p>I began this evenings lecture by quoting the reputed last words of Winston
Churchill and Gertrude Stein. Allow me to finish by recommending the
following last words for the dying <b>Diplomacy</b> player. Simply look for the
most damaging, unexpected point of attack, smile grimly, say "it's a good
day to die" and take one of the bastards down with you.

<p>Good night ladies and gentlemen. We will meet again in Valhalla.

In 1969 he delivered a series of lectures designed to introduce the art of <b>Diplomacy</b> to hospitalised schizophrenics. These lectures were later published in the Envoy from 1988-1990 and again in FIST! from 1995-1997, and are considered a vital part of the modern day diplomatic arsenal.
<p>Next time: Lecture 5, in which Arthur removes the brain of the <b>Diplomacy</b>
cadaver, and points out the many amazing and vital functions this complex
device is capable of.
