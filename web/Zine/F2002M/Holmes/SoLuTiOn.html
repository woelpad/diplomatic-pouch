The Colonel and I slapped Holmes on the back, saying,
"Good show!"  My friend had begun to enlighten us concerning his resolution
of <a href=../../S2002M/Holmes/Blind.html>The Missing Master's Mystery</a>,
building on the <a href=../../S2002R/Holmes/hints.html>hints</a> that he
had provided.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Holmes was enjoying the attention, and his pipe. After
a brief pause, he said, "without proceeding further,
we cannot yet say definitively whether armies or
fleets entered Picardy, Tuscany, or Piedmont. In order
to determine the answers to these questions, as well
as the rest of the board position, we must take
evidence from more of the facts that the Captain left
us."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Holmes nodded seriously, and asked, "Shall we
proceed?" 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I was excited to continue, and felt better prepared
than at the beginning of this puzzle, but I realized
that there were still an enormous number of variables.
Which neutrals were captured in 1901? Who captured
them? Where are the remaining pieces on the board
beyond the 12 that we know? Sensing my anxiety, Holmes
quietly spoke. "Here, my dear Watson, we might begin
working backwards. As I mentioned, the case of France
might make a good example. We have several scraps of
information about France, which might be applied to
our advantage. Let us one more time review the facts
the Captain left for us, shall we?"

First and foremost, we know that France must have been
positioned to enter both Tuscany and Piedmont in the
Fall of 1902, from the Gulf of Lyon and Marseilles,
respectively. Now, there is an interesting fact
regarding particularly an attack from the Gulf of
Lyon. You see, according to Fact 2, France cannot have
built a fleet in Marseilles. We can deduce from this
that the fleet that finds itself in the Gulf of Lyon
must have come originally from Brest, where France's
fleet begins the game. Even taking its shortest route,
it would require exactly three tempi to travel to the
Gulf. That fleet must have gone to the Mid-Atlantic
Ocean in Spring of 1901, then to either the Western
Mediterranean or the South Coast of Spain
in the Fall of 1901 - thus potentially securing Spain
as a 1901 neutral for France - and then to the
Gulf of Lyon in the Spring of 1902."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Brilliant, Holmes!" exclaimed the Colonel. "Why
don't you just place the fleet on Tuscany for Fall and
consider another of the invasions solved?"
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Not quite yet, my good man," replied Holmes. "For the
invasion could have come by convoy from Spain, via the
Gulf of Lyon. It is too soon to say." 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Quite right, Holmes," nodded the Colonel approvingly.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"However, I would point out the tremendous amount we
have learned from the knowledge of the movement of
this single French fleet. First, as I mentioned, the
fact that the fleet had to move to either Spain or the
Western Mediterranean in the Fall of 1901
<!-- not only demonstrates that France is Spain's owner
and gained that player at least one build, but it also -->
tells us that if Portugal was taken in the same season
it could only have been with the army from Marseilles;
furthermore that the Italian fleet was not in the
Western Mediterranean in that same season, or else
they would have seen each other. We can note that for
later analysis. Next, it informs us of where the other
French units might have moved. With our most recent
discovery in mind, there is another conclusion that we
must draw about the invasion of Piedmont. Can you see
what it is?" 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Colonel and I each considered Holmes' inquiry. He
spoke first. "It had to be an army, Holmes! The
invasion came from Marseilles, and even if France had
built another fleet in Brest during the '01
adjustments, it never could have reached Marseilles in
time!"  
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Holmes looked pleased as he placed a French army on
Piedmont. "Excellently done, Colonel. But there is
even one other subtle detail that we can conclude from
this chain of events. You see, as we have already
identified the units that have held, we know that
every other unit on the board has moved each and every
turn, and has never stood off. This is a critical
fact. This means that a French army must have moved in
to Marseilles in the Spring of 1902, so that he could
move into Piedmont in the Fall. Where could that unit
have come from? Spain or Gascony only, as Burgundy
cannot be traversed without tipping off the German.
Which means that if the fleet moved through Spain,
then the army must have been coming from Gascony."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I was getting more and more confused, so I wrote out
the orders we knew for France, season-by-season.

"Dear God, Holmes, how did you arrive at those
choices?" I asked.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"From a careful analysis of all of the facts in play,
aconvinced nows well as what I myself have deduced about the
English and German moves. A better question to you,
Watson, might be 'How do we choose between these
self-consistent possibilities?'" 
-->

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Colonel consulted my list and nodded emphatically.
"There's still precious little we can tell about the number of
builds France could have made in '01. For all we know he could
have taken anything between zero and three neutral centers."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Oh, but we do know that France took at least one center
and not more than two," said Holmes without hesitation.
"Just consider the fact that two of the French units are
in Italy at the end of 1902; that Italy could not have
been in Western Mediterranean in the Spring of 1902 and
thus never could reach Spain; that likewise Britain
couldn't be in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean in that season, as
it borders Brest and is thus permanently visible to France.
Without a build France cannot possibly capture both Spain
and Portugal in '02. This then proves that he made at least
one. On the other hand, to achieve three requires a very
particular set of orders. Watson, if you would be so kind
writing them down?"
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I took a new leaf and started noting, while my friend
executed the moves on the board. The list that I produced,
looked like this:

"Quite remarkable that every move is exactly
determined up to the next to last season," said I.
"But there's still no reason to rule out this scenario."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Colonel had clearly been paying better attention, for
it was he who corrected me. "I'd advise you to consult
your own notes, good Doctor," he said with a wink and a
nod to Holmes. "There's no army in Marseilles to invade
Piedmont. And this in turn is because there was no army
in either Gascony or Spain after the first Fall turn.
I am forced to agree with Holmes that France either had
one or two builds in the first year."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"I had not considered a French capture of Belgium very
likely anyway," I retorted. "What with the German
invasion of France in the final season." 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Holmes seemed to consider this for a moment. "Good point!
There you have a second reason why three builds are not
possible. In order to invade Piedmont from Belgium in
Fall, Germany already needs to have a unit adjacent to
Belgium at the start of Spring, capable of seeing any
unit there. This prohibits France from taking the
center. Anyway," he continued, "We may even have a way of
knowing the exact number of builds, Colonel."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"How then, Holmes?" the Colonel asked, his curiosity piqued. 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"It might be revealed by consulting Fact number 1.
More than one power, the Captain tells us, built more
than one new unit in 1901. If there is only one other
power on the board that we can conclude definitely
built more than one unit, then we must agree that 
France must have done the same. If, on the other hand, we
find at least two others who managed to secure at
least two neutrals, then we are unsure again, so
perhaps a good way to proceed would be to try to
determine which neutrals could have been captured, and
by whom, in 1901."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
I frowned with concentration.
"Well, Holmes, I suppose I could give it a try..."  
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Holmes proceeded: "But before worrying ourselves too
much more with France, perhaps we should turn our
attention to the Balkans, where we might apply some
similar logic to the case of the Austrian, the Turk,
and the Balkan centers. The Austrian, you may notice,
is extremely restricted in his early moves. With his
fleet in Trieste standing still until the Fall of 1902
when he enters Venice, the player is highly limited in
the spaces he may visit without alerting another
player. Any move to Galacia or Rumania will tip off
the Russian, and any move to Tyrolia will certainly
alert the Italian and the German. Given that he moves
his armies every turn, we can conclude only one thing:
That his Spring moves were Budapest to Serbia followed
by Vienna to Budapest. Agreed?" I nodded hesitantly.
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Good then!" Holmes continued. "Then we already know
something about the Turk, as well."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Slowly, Holmes' logic becan to sink in. I interrupted
him, stating excitedly, "The Turk did not open to
Bulgaria!"
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Holmes looked pleased. "Indeed, Watson. Quite unusual
for a Turk, but true nonetheless, for if Austria was
present in Serbia, he would certainly have noted a
Turkish unit in Bulgaria, and been noticed in return!
From here, though, things become less certain. In my
opinion, we now have five options for the Austrian
moves, each carrying with it a unique set of
limitations. His armies could have continued on boldly
to both Greece and Serbia, shuffled to Albania and
Serbia, split between Greece and Vienna, or Albania
and Vienna, or fled ignobly back to their starting
positions. Which was it? Perhaps the Sultan's strategy
can provide us with answers...
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"The Turk did not move his army in Constantinope to
Bulgaria; on this we are agreed. His only two choices
for it then were Ankara or Smyrna. We can rule out
Ankara, for that province's fleet must have moved to
Constantinople, as Armenia and the Black Sea were
off-limits. Ah!" Holmes said, as if he had just
realized something for himself. "There we are, then.
Ankara to Constantinople, and Constantinople to
Smyrna. As for Smyrna, either Syria or Ankara will
do... we shall leave that question unanswered for now,
but as I suggested before, when trying to decide
between two destinations for a unit, you would do well
to select the one that has not yet been visited. Let
us claim that the army in Smyrna moved to Syria for
the time being, then. We are now left with this
position for Austria and Turkey before Fall of 1901:"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Colonel snorted. "Not exactly a wealth of
information, Holmes. A mere one season's information,
and not even complete." 
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Holmes cleared his throat. "I disagree, Colonel, for
this has given us several facts that we might use down
the line. First of all, we can see from the Turk's
positon that he now cannot possibly attain more than a
single build in 1901, and then only if he moves to the
south coast of Bulgaria with his fleet in the Fall. If
he did that, then we know that the Austrian cannot
have built at all, for he cannot have been present in
Serbia or Greece while the Turk was in Bulgaria.
Conversely, if the Austrian gains either Serbia or
Greece, or both, the Turk would have made no gain at
all. Thus, in addition to that more immediate
information about the two powers' units in the Fall of
1901, we also know that we can rule out the Turk as
one of the powers who did not build more than one unit
in 1901 (and, if he built one, then we can also rule
out Austria.), thus getting us closer to resolving the
question, 'to whom was the Captain referring when he
wrote Fact number 1?'
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Additionally, there is another clue, when added to
information we already have. If we wish for the Aegean
Sea and the Eastern Mediterranean to have been visited
by the Fall of 1902, we know only the Turk could visit
them. Therefore, the next moves of his fleet might
well be to those spaces, and, to reiterate, we should
always prefer moves which allow us to visit unvisited
spaces to those that do not. Perhaps you are right,
Colonel, for at this point we cannot yet say with any
more certainty what the exact moves of those two
powers were, but, as you shall find, each detail
counts."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"You see, my friends, the same logical steps can be
applied toward every region of the board. Simple
analysis of all possible moves by every power will
reveal a very limited number of possibilities which
hold true to all of the facts. The method that I
applied was to simply determine the moves of which I
could be certain for every power. When I reached a
point when I could not be certain of a power's moves,
I would return to one I had already examined and
attempt to fill in more moves armed with my new
information. For example, as I mentioned earlier, when
I discovered that France had to to have a fleet in
the Gulf of Lyon at the start of 1902, it also
demonstrated to me that Italy could not have been in
the Western Mediterranean at the end of 1901. Or that
Turkey and Austria have a variety of mutually
exclusive moves! Deductions such as these, combined
with the lists we generated earlier showing spaces
that could not be entered, as well as spaces that
could only be entered by a single power, resolve the
bulk of what might seem at a glance to be ambiguities.
One might simply make a grid with five columns, one
for each of Spring, Fall and Adjustments of 1901 and
Spring and Fall of 1902, and fill in the locations of
units as they are discovered.
It is worth restating at this point that we must never
forget that every unit (excepting Sevastapol, Trieste,
and Venice, as we know) moves, uncontested and
unsupported, every turn. We will see that in many
cases, there is only one choice as to how that unit is
able to move."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Holmes paused thoughtfully for a moment. He continued:
"However, what I believe might have been the Captain's
greatest gift to us, and the one you will see are
absolutely crucial to the final resolution of this
mystery, is Fact number 8. Fact 8 tells us that there
are a mere four spaces on the entire board that had
not yet been entered, and each could be entered by a
fleet on the very next turn! In many cases, when
unable to decide between two moves for a particular
unit on a particular season, I chose for that unit
entrance into a space that had not yet been entered. I
actually reached several complete solutions to this
problem which held true to every fact except that one,
but only one solution that held only four spaces
unvisited. Once bound by this limitation, the options
became very limited indeed."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
"Finally, Fact 9 deserves a bit of discussion before
we go on to generating our grid. Once again, this fact
is useful when attempting to decide between
self-consistent possibilities. Knowing that all units
have to end away from a power's home centers, you will
find, answers the rest of the questions you will
have."
</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
The Colonel, who was engrossed by Holmes'
observations, spoke up. "Well, then, Holmes. Let's get
to it!" With a pen and paper in hand, he began drew
the grid as we gathered around him. For nearly two
hours, he and I slowly added positions of units as we
saw them, taking care to keep Holmes' observations of
the facts closely in mind. As he promised us, we
ultimately discovered that there was indeed only one
ending position for the entirety of the four seasons
that matched the Captain's incomplete observations
about the board:
