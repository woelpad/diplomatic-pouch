<H3>Brief Introduction</H3>
Welcome to the ninth article in my continuing
series about the Modern variant. In the
<a href=../../W1995A/Mous/Modern.html>first article</a> you got an introduction
to the modern variant, as well as some information on how to get started
playing it. In the next six articles I discussed the opening strategies for
<a href=../../S1996M/Mous/Modern2.html>Britain</a>,
<a href=../../S1996R/Mous/egypt.html>Egypt</a>,
<a href=../../F1996M/Mous/Modern.html>France</a>,
<a href=../../W1996A/Mous/Modern.html>Germany</a> and
<a href=../../S1997M/Mous/Italy.html>Italy</a>.
Then, I took a break and conducted a
<a href=../../S1997R/Mous/NewOpenings.html>review</a>
of those six articles, before starting to discuss the remaining
five modern powers, beginning with
<a href=../../F1997M/Mous/Poland.html>Poland</a>.</P>
<P>In this article, I examine the position
and opening choices for Russia, the largest power in Modern, and possibly
the most intimidating.  Though this initial size makes Russia seem strong,
it also makes Russia the initial target of the Early Leader Syndrome in Modern, and typically a Russian earns the immediate enmity of one if not more than one of his neighbours.
Combined with a homeland that is difficult to defend, this makes Russia one of
the most vulnerable powers early on in Modern. However, Russia's mid- and
late game flexibility make it a very interesting power to play, and possibly
one of the hardest to stop once it gets going.</P>

<H3>Recently Finished Modern Games</H3>
As always, before getting underway, I'll take a look at recently finished Modern
games. Don't forget, however, that you can get the latest on the variant at
the <a href=http://www.dragonfire.net/~Cyberia/modern.htm>Modern Variant
Homepage</a>,
including the Overall Modern Hall of Fame, and the Halls of Fame for 1996
and 1997. Soon, the overall 1997 Modern champion will be announced and the
Modern Hall of Fame game for 1997 -- pitting the top 10 players of 1997 against
each other -- will start. Check it out!</P>
<P>Other interesting recent developments
have included the start of a few non-English-language Modern games
(two in French on the FROG judge, three in German on DEAC), as well as three non-judge games on the CAT-23 list. One of the CAT-23 members, Cavebabe, has made a page on <a href=http://www.golden.net/~dykevader/modstrat.htm>Modern Strategy</a> -- visit
it if  you haven't already. It offers a lot of interesting tidbits from such luminaries as Ramses, Cleopatra, Sun-Tzu, and Alexander the Great, and
even covers some powers not yet reviewed in my articles.</P>
<P>Five games
ended since publication of the article on Poland. Continuing Germany's strong showing this
year was Rudy Vonk in Gdansk (USEF, press). His Germany reached 31 SC's, two short of a solo win, before being brought back to 27 SC's and a four-way draw
by Thomas Lutz, Erik McConathy and Michael North, playing Italy, Russia and Turkey. </P>
<P>In the next game to finish, two previous lightweight
powers in Modern -- France and Ukraine -- battled it out for supremacy. The
game was called "Norway" (on the NOTR judge, no-press), and Gordon Aickin and Kent Liljegren, playing
France and Ukraine, settled for a four-way draw with Britain and Turkey, led
by Eric Person and Peter Taylor.</P>
<P>France was also present at the end in Ukraine's first solo-win in the
game "Details" (USEF, nopress). Robert Rehbold
masterfully exploited differences in his opponents, and with his second stab of Poland, came up with the magic 33 SC's, despite the best efforts of
France, Spain and Poland.</P>
<P>Next to finish is a game I am sure you
are all interested in -- the Modern Hall of Fame game for 1996, "ModHOF96"
(USEF, press). One of the shortest Modern games ever, it ended in 2003 with
a relatively even three-way draw between France, Germany and Turkey, led by Joseph W. Carl Jr, Chris Fridrich and Toby Tyrrell. To show how quick and
brutal it was, only two other powers, Italy and Russia, reached seven or more
centers, though they were certainly both a factor in the game.</P>
<P>The
most recent game to finish was "euro96." It too ended in a three-way draw between relatively
equal powers. This time, Egypt, France, and Poland, played by Jeff Serandos,
Steve Stackhouse and Murray Grelis, were the powers to share in the draw.
By the way, if the current trend holds out, it seems that the top two powers
of 1997 will be Germany and Ukraine, which is fitting since they were the
<i>bottom</i> two powers of 1996.</P>
<P>Anyhow, on to the article itself. I'll be looking
at Russian openings and strategies, and will then, as usual include a section
of player comments concerning the play of Russia.</P>
<H3>List of Openings for Russia</H3>
<H4><u>Neutral/Defensive Openings</u></H4>
<dl>
<dt><b>Apparatchik Attack</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Estonia. (*void*)<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Moscow.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Georgia.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Finland.
</tt></blockquote>
This opening
was used in a Cat-23 (non-judge) game. Obviously, the result was not very
good, with both Moscow and Gorky effectively holding their positions. At
least Russia had three units that <b>did</b> move. A perfect example of what can
happen when the apparatchiks take control.</P>
<dt><b>The Gulag</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Central Russian Plateau.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Moscow.<BR>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Georgia.<BR>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<BR>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Urals.
</tt></blockquote>
Russia tries
not to offend with this opening, using a mix of defense and offense while
maintaining her options for the fall and following year. This is probably
a bid to take Bielorussia, while maintaining some defense against Ukraine
by moving to CRP instead of Latvia. Since Russia did not move to Volga, then Ukraine might be more willing to accept the move to CRP, even though CRP
borders two Ukrainian home SC's. The opening also has the advantage of being
able to kick Ukraine out of Volga in the fall, should he have moved in, without having Ukraine retreat behind the lines. </P>
<P>  There are more
effective attacks and defenses available to Russia, and better uses for the Murmansk army than sending it to the Gulag. This opening should only
be used when the diplomatic situation warrants it.</P>
<p><dt><B>Leningrad Defense</B>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Moscow.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Georgia.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg HOLD.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Finland.</P>
</tt></blockquote>
Another opening
that seeks to offend few. Russia leaves her northern fleet as a peace offering
to Poland, and hopes this is enough to make Poland give up Bielorussia (either
that or Poland has already agreed to this). This could have been accomplished
just as well by moving Murmansk to Lapland and the fleet to Finland -- Britain
would have been annoyed, but Sweden would at least have been almost guaranteed.
As the move to Bielorussia will most likely bounce, even with the expected
Ukrainian support (and there is no reason to move this way unless Ukraine
has promised support), the army in Gorky will probably stay where it is as well, leaving Russia open to a Ukrainian opening to Volga and/or CRP.
All in all, I believe this is a weak opening.</P>
<P><dt><B>Russian Bear</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow SUPPORT Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Georgia.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Finland. <i>(Finn Variant) --or--<br></i>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland. <i>(Lapp Variant)</i>
</tt></blockquote>
One of the better defensive openings. Russia protects the vital Volga area,
as well as its Rostov port, by sending a unit southwards. Ukraine should
be content with this opening, as Russia did not move to the CRP, which borders
two Ukrainian SC's, and the Rostov fleet moved south. Likewise, Poland should
be happy, as Russia stayed out of Bielorussia. </P>
<P>  Meanwhile, Russia's
options are completely open for the fall. Sweden can be virtually guaranteed if
need
be, or the northern fleet can be sent to take the Baltic and set up a 1996
attack on Poland. If Ukraine cooperates, Bielorussia could be taken in the
fall from an unsuspecting Poland. An attack on Ukraine can be pursued, supporting
Moscow south into CRP now that Volga is secure, or sneaking into Donbas while moving Moscow to CRP or Volga. Turkey can be pressured as well, either
by sending Volga south to the Caucasus to put more pressure on Georgia, or moving it to Kazakhstan to pressure Iran. Moscow can even be sent to Volga to further the southern attack.</P>
<P>  Though the opening cannot
withstand a combined opening assault from Poland and Ukraine, it is a strong
choice, especially if used with good diplomacy that gets either Ukraine or Poland to attack the other. Be wary though, as some players of Poland
or Ukraine will require a stronger initial show of support to trust you.</P>
<p><dt><B>Spartak Moscow</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Moscow.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Georgia.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.
</tt></blockquote>
oving Gorky to Moscow (and Moscow to Bielorussia or CRP) is
not my favorite choice, although I suppose if there is a good Spartak Moscow
hockey game on, the troops' morale could be raised. This is because if Moscow
is bounced, then the move to Moscow will fail. Russia will only get Bielorussia
if Poland does not support itself in <i>and</i> Ukraine supports Russia in so there
will mose likely be abounce. A better move for capturing Bielorussia would
be to ask for Ukrainian help in the fall, and move Moscow to Latvia rather
than Bielorussia. Either of these leaves Russia open to Ukrainian openings
to CRP and Volga however, so only use them with caution.</P>
<p><dt><B>Stalin Strategy</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet Rostov SUPPORT Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.
</tt></blockquote>
Stalin's strategy was to consolidate his position
at home and only attack others with a strong alliance (the partition of Poland with the Nazis, and then of Eastern Europe with the Allies) or if
they were too small to defend themselves (Finland). This opening follows
the same lines. The supported move to Volga consolidates Russia's defense
of both its interior and its southern port. Two units are moved on Sweden,
to ensure its capture, and an attempt at Bielorussia is made, presumably
with a Ukrainian alliance. The latter move will probably fail, but will also prevent Poland from getting Bielorussia, and Russian and Ukrainian reinforcements can be sent the following year, while the fleet in the Gulf
of Bothnia can be moved south immediately if it isn't needed in Sweden. </P>
<P>  Though Georgia is given up, this opening is a reasonable one.
The above scenario of an attack on Poland can be changed to one on Ukraine
if necesary, and at least Turkey should be grateful for the 'gift' of Georgia.</P>
<p><dt><B>White Russian (Theo Kermanidis)</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Georgia.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Finland. <i>(Finn Variant) --or--</i><br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland. <i>(Lapp Variant)</i>
</tt></blockquote>
Similar to the Stalin Strategy, the White Russian
gives up the support for the move to Volga to try for Georgia. If Ukraine
really is going to support Russia into Bielorussia, then the support into
Volga wont be needed. In the worst case, both will bounce, and Russia will
lose no home SC's, while still being almost guaranteed Sweden and having a shot at Georgia. In the best case, Georgia, Bielorussia and Sweden will be captured
(and Russia's northern fleet will be in the Gulf of Bothnia) and Russia will be looking very good indeed.</P>
<P>  The actual result will probably
be somewhere inbetween, but this will remain one of the more popular openings,
especially since it has produced one of the two Russian solo wins.</P>
</dl>
<H4><u>Pro-Turkish Openings</u></h4>
<dl>
<dt><b>Black Sea Alliance</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet Rostov SUPPORT Turkish Fleet Ankara -&gt; Eastern Black Sea.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Finland.
</tt></blockquote>
Russia gives up Georgia to Turkey and also supports Turkey into the Eastern Black
Sea. This is likely to anger Ukraine, but Russia</P>
<P>moves to Bielorussia
from Moscow -- not to CRP -- which seems to indicate she is expecting Ukrainian
support. In any case, this will
upset Poland as well, so the alliance
with Turkey had better pan out, since Russia will be facing both Ukraine and Poland
unless she can
come up with some good explanations, especially
since Sweden is the only neutral she will acquire. </P>
<P>  I would at
least change the support of Turkey from EBS to Georgia in a no-press game,
as Ukraine might not be so offended.</P>
<p><dt><B>Georgian Gambit</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Central Russian Plateau.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet Rostov SUPPORT Turkish Fleet Ankara -&gt; Georgia.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Finland. <i>(Finn Variant) --or--</i><br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland. <i>(Lapp Variant)</i>
</tt></blockquote>
A better opening than the Black Sea alliance, and a more popular one as well. The move to CRP instead of Bielorussia is
superior, as it does not offend Poland and increases pressure on Ukraine.
It is generally best for Russia to choose only one of Ukraine and Poland
as a target for initial conquest, so as not to push them together into an
alliance. Again, the only sure SC is Sweden, as Turkey is given Georgia,
but Georgia is never a sure thing anyhow, and it is better to give it away
and make a friend of Turkey, than to fight for it and lose to Turkey.</P>
<p><dt><b>Turkish Treaty</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow SUPPORT Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet Rostov SUPPORT Turkish Fleet Ankara -&gt; Eastern Black Sea.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Finland.
</tt></blockquote>
Similar
to the other pro-Turkish openings, Russia's target is Ukraine. This time,
she makes sure to take Volga, while giving up position in CRP to Ukraine
if Ukraine opens there. This is usually an acceptable compromise, as it isn't certain that Ukraine will go for CRP, and Russia will be able to move
to defend Rostov if that is attacked.</P>
</dl>
<h4><u>Pro-Ukrainian Openings</u></h4>
<dl>
<dt><b>Hammer and Sickle</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow SUPPORT Ukrainian Army Kiev -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; St-Petersburg.<br>
Fleet Rostov SUPPORT Ukrainian Fleet Sevastopol -&gt; Eastern Black Sea. <i>--or--</i><br>
Fleet Rostov HOLD.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Finland. <i>(Finn Variant) --or--</i><br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland. <i>(Lapp Variant)</i>
</tt></blockquote>
Russia uses two units to support Ukraine -- one against Poland, and
the other against Turkey. If Ukraine goes along, this can be a good alliance,
and Russia or Ukraine can usually take Georgia in the fall. Russia therefore
still has a shot at capturing two SC's in 1995, even though she doesn't move
to Georgia immediately, and at least one, Sweden, is virtually guaranteed.</P>
<p><dt><B>Northern Opening (Jeff Behan)</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Latvia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Moscow.<br>
Fleet Rostov SUPPORT Ukrainian Fleet Sevastopol -&gt; Eastern Black Sea.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.
</tt></blockquote>
Says Jeff Behan, "F
Rostov S Ukr F Sev-Ebs is simply a sign of peace to Ukraine, my first choice
as a ally.  Russia is so outgunned in that region anyway that if the Ukraine
decides to attack, Rostov is lost.  It appears that Ukraine/Russia would
make a good alliance as well, if they choose to team up.</P>
<P>"A Mos-Lat
and A Gor-Mos amount somewhat to a declaration of war against Poland.
If Ukraine doesn't grab Bie right off the bat, Russia will have two forces
to use against it.  If she does, R/U haven't butted heads to start.  The thinking is that it allows Russia to take Bie in the Fall and gives a fair
defensive position against most Ukr or Pol openings.</P>
<P>"Concerning F StP-GoB,  I feel all fleets should open up to sea.  Obviously the sights are on Swe.</P>
<P>"A Mur-Lap brings leverage against Sweden with an option to mess with Britain over Norway."
<p><dt><B>Polish Partition</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Moscow.<br>
Fleet Rostov CONVOY Ukrainian Army Kiev -&gt; Warsaw. (*void*)<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.
</tt></blockquote>
A no-press opening, the fleet in Rostov is used to indicate the wish for an
alliance to Ukraine, while Moscow's move to Bielorussia is a request for
Ukraine to support Russia in -- though Russia obviously hopes for this as
well. Turkey will be pleased with the opening as well, as he gets Georgia,
while Britain will be somwhat upset by the move to Lapland rather than Finland.
This might help with Ukraine though, as it is a definite sign that Russia
is interested in an Atlantic strategy, and that Britain, not Ukraine might
be the next target once Poland is gone.</P>
<p><dt><b>Soviet Alliance</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow SUPPORT Ukrainian Army Kiev -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; St-Petersburg.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Georgia.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.
</tt></blockquote>
<i>[NOTE: Army Gorky -&gt; Moscow was used in Sedan, an obvious mistake.]</i>
<P>
Similar to the Hammer and Sickle, this opening proposes an alliance with Ukraine, and offers Bielorussia to Ukraine. The move of Gorky to
St-Petersburg is probably the best choice if Russia does not want to move
Gorky to Volga (as this might not be viewed kindly by Ukraine), since Moscow
is not going anywhere. Russia remains vulnerable to an initial attack by
Ukraine however.</P>
</dl>
<h4><u>Aggressive Openings</u></H4>
<dl>
<dt><b>Black Sea Fleet</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Eastern Black Sea.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.
</tt></blockquote>
This opening will likely offend all Russia's neighbours, though the move
to the Black Sea can perhaps be explained to Ukraine as an attack on Turkey
and vice-versa. This opening is at least a bit more subtle than the Zhirinovsky
Offensive, as well as a more defensive, with the move to the Volga.</P>
<P><dt><b>Politburo Shuffle</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Central Russian Plateau.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Moscow.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Georgia.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Once again, an opening where Russia attacks
in all directions. The move to CRP threatens two Ukrainian home SC's, but
instead of moving to Volga and attempt to take Kharkov, Russia moves Gorky
to Moscow, setting herself up to take Bielorussia and therefore threatening
Poland. Moves to Georgia and Lapland finish off the aggressive moves, possibly
annoying Turkey and Britain. This opening should not be attempted without
some heavy diplomacy to accompany it.</P>
<P><dt><b>Zhirinovsky Offensive</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Moscow.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Donbas.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.
</tt></blockquote>
An all-out attack by Russia
on everyone -- Poland in Bielorussia, Ukraine in Donbas, Britain in Lapland.
At least Turkey was not attacked, though that is probably because of the
lack of southern units. This opening is vulnerable to an initial move by
Ukraine to CRP and Volga.</P>
</dl>
<h4><u>Anti-British Openings</u></h4>
<dl>
<dt><B>Russia House</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow HOLD.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; Murmansk.<br>
Fleet Rostov HOLD.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.
</tt></blockquote>
Two Russian
units, Moscow and Rostov, stay at home, while the others move towards Scandinavia.
Sweden is almost guaranteed, and Norway is likely the next intended target. Turkey
will be happy to get Georgia uncontested, and Ukraine and Poland will also
be pleasantly surprised to see Russia's troops turn their eyes elsewhere.</P>
<p><dt><B>Scandinavian Strike</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky -&gt; St-Petersburg.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Lapland.
</tt></blockquote>
Another opening where Russia makes as much of a play for Norway as she can. The opening offers more defense against a Ukrainian attack than the Russia House however, by moving the Rostov fleet
to Volga. Ukraine is also hopefully helping against Poland, and the attack
on Scandinavia might be diverted south to an attack on Poland.</P>
</dl>
<H4><u>Anti-Polish Openings</u></H4>

Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Gulf of Bothnia.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; Finland.
</tt></blockquote>
Simon Withers advises: "F Rostov-Volga defends against
a Ukrainian Kharkov-Volga while not being as aggressive as Gorky or Moscow-Volga.  Georgia is sacrificed to keep Turkey from going to war on you,
and may even keep Turkey from preventing the Ukraine from helping your assault
on Poland. Because Poland will want to pick up CZE, Bielorussia is vulnerable
to a two on one assault in the fall, and that is exactly what Moscow and Gorky
are doing.  Definitely that army in Latvia will prove handy when trying to take Lithuania.</P>
<P>"Murmansk to Finland is chosen over Murmansk to
Lapland as the leverage in Norway is not in your best interests.  Germany
and Britain are very likely to go to war, and Germany needs to take Sweden
to take Norway.  Not in your best interest at all, so why not show Britain
that you're on their side as soon as the opportunity arises.</P>
<P>"St.
Petersburg to the Gulf is pretty self-explanatory, but remember that a cunning
way to get the drop Poland is a convoy through the Baltic to Prussia...."
<p><dt><b>Catherine the Great</b>

</tt></blockquote>
Catherine the Great, or
Catherine II, ruled Russia from 1762 to 1796. She extended the Russian Empire
to the shores of the Black Sea, and took over large portions of Poland. She also made Russia into a great European power. This openings attempts
to do this by starting with the first part -- extending Russian control over
the Eastern Black Sea with the Rostov fleet, and moving on Poland with the
Moscow and Gorky armies. The move to EBS is an interesting one, as it will
cause problems for both Turkey and Ukraine if it succeeds, and still allows
Russia to try for Georgia in the fall. </P>
<p><dt><B>Ivan the Terrible</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>

</tt></blockquote>
Ivan the Terrible was the first Tsar of Russia, crowned in 1547. His reign
was noted by the conquest of Siberia and extension of Russia to shores of
the Caspian Sea, but also by the disastrous Livonian War, waged against the Germans, Swedes and Poles. This opening sets up Russia for another disappointment
of the same type, with the conquest of Sweden possibly blocked by Germany,
and a war with Poland shaping up with the move to Bielorussia. The Rostov
fleet is also moved to Georgia, seeking to expand Russian influence further
along the Caspian. Of course, the outcome of these moves will not necessarily
be the same as for Ivan the Terrible, but essential to this opening
are probably an alliance with Ukraine, and an understanding with Germany
about Sweden. </P>
<P><dt><b>Minsk Accord</b>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Army Moscow -&gt; Bielorussia.<br>
Army Gorky HOLD.<br>
Fleet Rostov -&gt; Volga.<br>
Fleet St-Petersburg -&gt; Finland.<br>
Army Murmansk -&gt; St-Petersburg.
</tt></blockquote>
This opening counts on an alliance with Ukraine to get
Russia into Minsk, the Bielorussian capital. The St-Petersburg fleet is sent to take Sweden, while Murmansk is moved south to St-Petersburg, and
presumably on to Latvia to add pressure on Bielorussia and Lithuania. Rostov
moves north to Volga, to defend against a possible Ukrainian betrayal, but
perhaps also offering Rostov up to Ukraine as the price for an alliance.
Holding in Gorky seems like a wasted move however -- it should at least be
moved to Moscow in case the move to Bielorussia succeeds.

Alexander Nevsky ruled the state of Novgorod in the thirteenth century,
and is a direct ancestor of the first Tsars of Russia. He successfully fought
the Swedes and Germans from Livonia and ruled an area from the White Sea
to the Urals. He was also later canonized by the Russian Orthodox Church.
<P>  Similarly, this opening makes sure that Sweden is taken, whether
the Germans get involved or not, by sending two units to Scandinavia. Control
is also extended to Livonia -- modern day Latvia and Estonia -- perhaps to
be convoyed to Sweden or to exert pressure on Lithuania or Bielorussia. The Nevsky Plan also defends against an early Ukrainian attack, and possibly
an attack on Rostov, by moving Gorky to Volga, while attempting to take Georgia from Rostov. </P>

</tt></blockquote>
Peter the Great ruled Russia
from 1689 to 1725 and is considered to have layed the foundation for the
Russian Empire. He is also responsible for the inception of the Russian Navy in 1695, on the Black Sea, in a campaign to take over the Sea of Azhov.
He also founded St-Petersburg in 1703 and secured Russia access to the Baltic
Sea, and eventually Estonia, Livonia, Poland and the western shores of the
Caspian Sea. </P>
<P>  This opening secures Russia's Baltic Sea port by
moving the army in Murmansk south to St-Petersburg, moves on Poland with
the armies in Moscow and Gorky, and sends the Rostov fleet to Georgia along
the western shores of the Caspian.  It is probably one of the better Russian
openings when Ukraine, Turkey and Germany are neutral or friendly, but would
be substantially hurt by a Ukrainian opening to CRP and Volga.</P>

</tt></blockquote>
With as direct an assault on Poland as can be made, Russia tries to send its
three armies against it by land, but depends on Ukrainian assistance to do this. Both Sweden and Georgia are sought, but neither is secure. A reasonable
opening, but a Ukrainian opening to CRP and Volga would again be very damaging.</P>

</tt></blockquote>
One of the more popular openings, this is probably the most effective way
for Russia to make a play for all three neutral SC's that are reasonably accessible
to her in 1995 -- Georgia, Sweden, and Bielorussia. The opening even allows
Russia to exceptionally try for Norway or Lithuania should those become available, though taking Sweden from Lapland and moving the northern fleet
to the Baltic Sea in the fall is probably preferrable to bouncing Britain
in Norway. As many other pro-Ukrainian openings though, Red Storm leaves
Russia vulnerable to an initial Ukrainian move to CRP and Volga.</P>

Rick Desper calls this opening "Anti-Polish, working with Ukraine."
Almost identical to the
Red Storm, this opening gives up possible pressure on Norway, hopefully for better relationships with Britain.</P>

</tt></blockquote>
Four of Russia's units are involved with moves
south, the most of any opening. Because of this, the hold on Sweden is lessened,
but with Moscow's support, Gorky is sure to make it to Volga, and thus defend
Rostov or move on to Caucasus, for more leverage on Georgia or to Kazakhstan,
to make a play for Iran, all while sending a second army to Volga. Though
I put this opening under Anti-Turkish openings, it is also a defensive opening,
and Russia will seldom lose an SC using it. Also, nothing vital to Turkey
is attacked in the first move, and Russia can change her mind and attack
Ukraine instead.</P>
</dl>
<H4><u>Pro-Polish/Anti-Ukrainian Openings</u></H4>
Almost all anti-Ukrainian openings are pro-Polish openings. There is
not really any reason for supporting Poland into Bielorussia as he can do
so himself, so one will not often see a direct support of a Polish unit,
except perhaps in a nopress game.</P>

Says Jouni Tikkanen, "The intention is, of course, to attack Ukraine
as heavily as possible. If Ukraine and Poland ally against Russia, Russia
will be in serious trouble. But if Russia has any luck, Poland will join
it against Ukraine. It is still hard to get that first SC from Ukraine, especially if he bounces th move to CRP.</P>
<P>"Murmansk moves south instead
of to Lap or Fin. Because of this Russia may not get Sweden and will also have
weak defence against British or German attack. Hopefully they start to fight
against each other. Because F Ros gives support, Russia may not get Geo either. If things go really wrong, Turkey joins P/U and tries to grab Rostov.
However, this is a bit unlikely, because Russia is not (like Egypt and Ukraine)
a big threat to his national security. The move A Mur to Gor (and not to
StP) because it can then reach both Volga and Moscow."

Amy Williams reflects that "the only reason anyone would use this opening,
was if Russia would be to be friendly to Poland."
<P>  This is an appropriate comment perhaps, as the opening was used in spartiku,
the only Polish win to date. However, this is not a bad opening against Ukraine, as it can possibly lead to the capture of Kharkov if Ukraine is
caught unawares, and has been until now one of the most used openings for
Russia. Its weakness is probably that it leaves Moscow unprotected from a Polish stab in the fall from Bielorussia, and be sure that Ukraine will
be pressuring Poland to do just that.</P>

</tt></blockquote>
One
of the two openings that have led to a Russian win in Modern to date. Like
the Clencher, Russia can possibly take Kharkov if the moves to Volga and
CRP succeed, and Moscow is still vulnerable to a Polish stab from Bielorussia
in the fall. The southern fleet is moved to the Eastern Black Sea though
instead of Georgia. This is probably a good move for two reasons -- it gives
Turkey Georgia, hopefully making him an ally against Ukraine, and it puts
more immediate pressure on Ukraine, threatening Sevastopol, and possibly
forcing Ukraine to move back to it and forego a neutral SC, and thus a build.</P>
<p><dt><B>Southern Attack (Rick Desper)</b>

</tt></blockquote>
Rick Desper calls this opening, "Anti-Ukraine, with a surprise."
<P>  This is identical to the Mother
Russia opening, but the army in Murmansk is moved to St-Petersburg instead
of Lapland. That means that Sweden is no longer as sure a thing as otherwise,
but Moscow is
also no longer vulnerable to a Polish stab from Bielorussia in the fall of 1995.</P>
<p><dt><B>Reunification (Rob Serandos)</b>

</tt></blockquote>
Rob Serandos comments: "The
Stp fleet hopes for Sweden, but if its not there, then the fleet will remain
in gob as a deterrent to a Polish offensive.  Mos-CRP assures Russia that
either Gor-Vol will succeed or Ukraine will not get CRP.  Gor-Vol will usually
succeed without support since Ukraine does not want to waste a move bouncing there.
Ros-EBS puts pressure on sev while still overseeing Georgia if that center
is available in the Fall.  The move to EBS may stem a Turkish offensive as well.  By making anti-U moves and attempting to prevent invasions from
Poland or Turkey before they start, Russia hopes to make Ukraine the early target in the east.</P>
<P>"(Unlike the Southern Attack), the opening uses Mur-Gor, not Mur-Stp.
The army would dead-end in Stp if the hoped for Polish alliance came about.
An army in Gor though could go to Volga if the army in Volga moves in the
Fall."

</tt></blockquote>
Says Jim Kloss, "This opening is
designed to try to gain two, not overtly attack anyone, and to better align
your forces to stop the expected attacks from Poland and/or Ukraine, and/or
Turkey.  It gambles that Germany will not go to Denmark on turn one.  If
it does, and if Turkey orders Ada - Arm, then you may get no builds. However,
one of Russia's advantages is starting with more units, so quick initial
growth is not as important for Russia as it is for a country like Poland."

</tt></blockquote>
Charles Dauphin says, "I was impressed by the opening. The key moves are Mos-CRP, Gor-Vol,
and Ros-Don.  Of course, you have to lull Ukraine into a false sense of
security. Once that is done, though, Kharkov is yours."
<P>Similar to the Southern Attack, the Rostov Fleet moves to Donbas instead
of the Eastern Black Sea, threatening Turkey even less. If Turkey opens to the Eastern Black Sea, Sevastopol could be taken through cooperation.
Like the Southern Attack, Murmansk protects Moscow from a possible fall stab by Poland in Bielorussia.</P>

Jeff Zahnen says, "The move to STP is to cover Moscow from Bielorussia, while the Bothnia
fleet moves into position to hit Poland.  The Vol/CRP moves are to take Kharkov from Ukraine.  Basically, the opening is anti-Polish.  It avoids
the blitzkrieg Russia suffered in dickens.  If Poland wants Lit/Bie, Russia
cant stop them, but the army in STP stops them from moving further east while the fleet moves into position."

Earle Ratcliffe says, "I'd go for Ukraine off
the bat.  By going through him, you can get to the Balkans, the largest concentration of centers in the game. That puts you on good terms with Turkey
and Britain.  Maybe Britain can support you into Sweden next year, if you
don't get it this year?) Turkey is offered Georgia in exchange for help against
Ukraine.  Turkey might let you into Georgia for another Ukrainian center, depending
on your build situation elsewhere.  Hopefully, Poland will jump on the bandwagon,
and you can pick a new target quickly."

</tt></blockquote>
Rick Desper says this is a "strong anti-Ukraine" opening.
It is a similar opening to the Clencher and Mother Russia,
Russia makes sure that Gorky gets to Volga instead of trying for Georgia
or moving to the Eastern Black Sea. Though it seems that it increases the
chance of taking Kharkov from Ukraine, by getting around an opening move
to Volga by Ukraine, it remains more likely that Ukraine will open to CRP
instead (or as well). It does allow Russia to support a move to CRP in the
fall though, should it have failed in the spring. Watch out for the Polish
army in Bielorussia!</P>

Cait Glasson remarks that "in all the Modern games
I've seen, Russia and the Ukraine end up at war nearly immediately.  If one doesn't start it, the other does.  And the best defense is a good offense.
Quiet Flows the Don.  In the north, Fin could be substituted for Lap, if
the English are very chummy, but Lap offers more options."
<P>  Yaroslav the Wise was one of the great rulers of Kievan
Russia, reigning from 1019 to 1054. He was one of the leading monarchs of
his time, marrying sons and daughters to many royals accross Europe, and
thus forging alliances. He was also responsible for the Russkaya Pravda,
the first Russian law.</P>
<P>  The opening attempts to reestablish Russia's
rule over its birthland, the area around Kiev. It is similar to the Ukrainian
Reannexation, but the Murmansk army moves to Lapland to secure Sweden, rather
than to St-Petersburg where it would defend against a possible Polish stab
at Moscow in the fall.</P>

<H3>Russian Strategy</H3>
<P>  How should one play Russia
in Modern? What should the initial and overall strategies be? There are many answers to these questions, all of them valid. I will try to examine
the possibilities, as well as Russia's strengths and weaknesses, possible
paths to winning, and its relationship with other powers. Along the way,
you can read player comments on the same subjects.
<U><P>Naming Confusion</P>
</U>
<P>  First however, I want to
present alternatives for a couple of SC's in and around Russia. It turns out that Russia's propensity for changing the names of their cities has got me in trouble. For most of the time between 1901, when the Standard variant starts, and 1995, when Modern begins, St-Petersburg was, as everyone probably
knows, Leningrad. There is not where the problem lies. It turns out that Gorky's name also changed around the time of the dissolution of the Soviet
Union, and is now known as Nizhni Novgorod, Russian for New Novgorod. I will keep using Gorky, though, in the article. The other point of contention is White Russia. I have used Bielorussia for it in the variant,
but common usage has become Belarus. This is not a change in the Russian
name for White Russia, but a change in the English name for it -- just like
one day Peking suddenly became Beijing. I have an encyclopedia (Collier's)
showing it as Bielorussia, and since the three letter abbreviation for Belarus
conflicts with that used for Belgium, I decided to use Bielorussia for the
variant.</P>
<U><P>Initial Strategy</P>
</U>
<P>  Once you get over the
confusion about names, you might start wondering about Russia's initial strategy. With five starting units, Russia has more opening combinations
that any other power in Modern - approximately 5000, if one does not count
supports. While this may seem daunting, it is possible to develop a coherent
strategy by examining the SC's that Russia can reach in 1995 as well as longer
term considerations. The list of SC's within two moves of Russian units is
actually reasonably long - Norway, Sweden, Lithuania, Warsaw, Krakow, Kiev,
Kharkov, Sevastopol and Ankara. Of these, however, Russia can amazingly only attack two - Sweden and Kharkov - with two of her own units. Since Kharkov is a Ukrainian home SC, that means Sweden is the most Russian of
neutral SC's, and by sending two units towards it, Russia can come close to guaranteeing it (Poland and Germany could work together to keep Russia
out, but this would involve Poland giving up a build, and is not likely to happen).</P>
<P>  Let's examine the other SC's within reach. Norway is
also in Scandinavia and can be reached by one Russian army and two British
fleets. Russia can go after it by sending an army to Lapland, forcing Britain
to support herself to take Norway and possibly lose a build in Belgium. The most Russia can really expect though is to keep Britain out of Norway.
Fortunately, Lapland also borders Sweden, so the army could be used to take
Sweden or support a move there. In any case, a move to Lapland is likely
to earn Britain's distrust, if not anger, so this should be taken into consideration.</P>
<P>  A second neutral SC on the list is Lithuania, the only SC in the Baltics.
Russia does not really have any chance of taking it, however, as Poland can
reach it sooner than Russia <b>and</b> support himself in. As Poland will usually
take Lithuania with his fleet though, Russia will be able to send her northern
fleet to the Baltic Sea in the fall of 1995. This sets up a reasonable attack
on Lithuania in the spring of 1996, threatens Gdansk, and best of all might
allow Russia to convoy an army from Latvia to Prussia, likely fatally outflanking
Poland.</P>
<P>  The two remaining neutral SC's within Russia's reach, are
also the closest - Georgia and Bielorussia.  Georgia is a definite possibilty
for Russia, and acquiring it would go a long way to making Russia's position
in the Caucasus more defensible. Turkey is just as close to Georgia though,
and can send a second unit to make sure it can take it in 1995. The fate
of Georgia should therefore be a matter of negotiation. Russia probably wants an ally in Turkey to counterbalance Ukraine, whether Ukraine is a friend or not, and especially does not want Turkey attacking Rostov. Russia's
interest here is therefore a friendly resolution of Georgia's status. </P>
<P>  Bielorussia is another case though. Like Switzerland, it is bordered
by one home SC of two powers, as well as two home SC's of a third power. As with Switzerland, this usually means that the power with two home SC's
is the most vulnerable if it does not capture it, and will make it one of
its prime objectives to do so. Bielorussia will therefore almost always be a Polish priority, and contesting it will confirm any anti-Russian tendencies
the Pole may harbor. The only way Russia could take Bielorussia in the spring
of 1995 would be if Poland does not support himself in, and Ukraine supports
Russia in. The other way to capture Bielorussia is by moving Moscow to Latvia
and Gorky to Moscow. If Poland already moved one of it's armies to the Czech
Republic, Russia will be able to take Bielorussia alone unless Ukraine supports
Poland. If not, Russia will have to get Ukraine's support to take Bielorussia,
but Poland will also have to choose whether to take the Czech Republic or
defend Bielorussia, and will therefore at least lose out on one SC. I feel
therefore that this is the superior way to attack Bielorussia in 1995, but
be aware that it is an attack on Poland.</P>
<P>  The other SC's that Russia
can reach in 1995 are home SC's. Two of them are Poland's, and are only reachable
through Bielorussia, and so should not figure in any Russian plans for 1995.
Two others - Sevastopol and Ankara - can only be taken with help that will
seldomly be coming. Threatening Sevastopol however, could be worth it in
conjunction with an attack on Ukraine, as it might rob Ukraine of a build
as Ukraine rushes back to port to defend the Crimean peninsula. All Russia
gives up to do this is its shot as Georgia, which is by no means a sure thing, and she might gain Turkey as an ally as a bonus. Threatening Ankara
is a more dubious affair, though it threatens Sevastopol at the same time,
but it might allow Russia to sneak into Georgia if Turkey chooses to defend
Ankara with the unit that would have captured Georgia that year. This should
only be done if Turkey's friendship is not needed however, and only when
sending Gorky south to Volga to be able to defend Rostov.</P>
<P>  Another
consideration in Russia's opening is defense. The Ukraine, if left unopposed,
can mount a serious attack on Russia in 1995 by moving to Volga and CRP.
Combined with a Polish move to Bielorussia, this could be the death knell
for Russia. To keep Ukraine from taking Volga, Russia just needs to move
there from either Gorky or Rostov (don't forget the canal joining Rostov
and Volga, which allows the fleet to move there), as Ukraine cannot support
a move to Volga. A move to CRP cannot be stopped if it is supported by Ukraine,
but if Ukraine moves to both Volga and CRP, then both will bounce. Russia
can gain the advantage here by supporting her move to Volga, though this
probably means the loss of Georgia,  or not trying for CRP.</P>
<P>  The
best way to defend Russia, however, is to make sure that you don't get attacked.
If you can manage to get either Poland or Ukraine on your side - or even
better, both - then your diplomacy will have resolved the problem much better
than your initial units could. A P/U alliance is very dangerous for Russia
- I would even go so far as to say that vulnerability to an initial P/U alliance
is Russia's main weakness in Modern. Therefore do what is necessary to break
it up, preferrably before it starts. This could include offering support
into Bielorussia to either or both of them, promising not to contest a neutral
SC, promising several of the others home SC's, but of course the specifics
will vary from game to game and depend on who is playing Poland and Ukraine.</P>
<U><P>Midgame and Endgame</P>
</U>
<P>  Once Russia has gotten past the
first few years and grown in size to a comfortable level, Russia's strengths
start to become apparent. With 3 ports, Russia can build fleets to support
it's activities on 4 seas - the Arctic seas, Baltic sea region, Black Sea
and Caspian Sea. This means that Russia is very flexible in it's midgame
and endgame strategy. Few bottlenecks will stop Russia, as it can bring the necessary land and sea forces to bear in many areas. Russia shares with
Germany access to the Baltic area and the Atlantic, and like France and Spain, access to both sides of the Gibraltar. This advantage will be lesser
if Russia's south was attacked early in the game and Rostov taken by a strong
Turkey, as it is possible for Turkey to hold on to Rostov against an attack
from the north if he uses sufficient forces to defend it. Russia might also
be stopped by sufficient forces at Istanbul, kept in the Black Sea, but diplomacy exists for a rason.</P>
<P>  The most difficult decision for Russia is probably where to attack in the midgame. If Russia builds fleets
north and suddenly faces an attack from the south, her weaknesses in defending
herself will show up again. The same goes if Russia builds many fleets to
the south and faces an attack in the north. The north is particularly weak,
as Murmansk cannot be held against a determined attack unless Russia has
a fleet in the White Sea. If Murmansk is lost, then occupying Estonia and
Latvia become just as important in trying to defend St-Petersburg. If both
of these are lost, then I believe Russia can be pushed back to the shores
of the Black Sea. </P>
<P>  Nonetheless, at this point in the game, such
an attack is less likely, though it must be guarded against. I feel that
to maximize Russia's strength in the midgame, a minimum of fleets should
be build. Keeping the navy down in size will increase Russia's options, as the armies can head in all directions, while the fleets will be separated
from one another. This does not mean not building any fleets, but a Russia
with four armies and six fleets is probably unbalanced. Later in the game, fleets
can be built rather quickly and provide the impetus for an nearly unstoppable
Russia. I would say that a twenty SC Russia is more fearsome than any other power of that size. A well-timed stab could then give Russia five builds,
and propel her towards a win. </P>
<P>  </P>
<U><P>Relationship with Other
Powers</P>
</U>
<P>  Russia's relationship with Poland and Ukraine have already been covered to some extent above. To recap, it is vital to Russia
that they do not ally with each other. I believe it is neither harder nor
easier to work with one of them than with the other. Poland might be wary
of Russia's northerly position, but Ukraine will be worried that Russia initially surrounds him. Both these issues can however be resolved. With
Poland, the occupation of Bielorussia is probably the most critical issue.
However, a DMZ here, or perhaps even better a mutual bounce every turn would
allow both Russia and Poland to feel safe enough to work with each other.
Similarly with Ukraine, Volga and CRP should be demilitarized, perhaps Kharkov
and Bielorussia as well. Giving Rostov to Ukraine is an option of course,
but this slows down a common attack against Turkey, and perhaps Russia can
be allowed to keep Rostov, Georgia and perhaps get Ankara too.</P>
<P>  The next most important power for Russia is probably Turkey. Turkey can
help in attacking Ukraine or keeping it in balance. Whether Russia allies
with Ukraine against Poland or vice-versa, it is probably best to have Turkey
on side to help if Ukraine becomes a problem. At the very least, this will
keep Ukraine distracted and focused on the south, but Turkey can be active
help against Ukraine, attacking him in the Balkans and along the Black Sea
coast.</P>
<P>  Russia's relationship with Germany may seem similar to that with Turkey - Sweden can be contested by both (like Georgia) and Germany
is in a similar position with regard to Poland as Turkey is to Ukraine. Germany however has moved against Poland less often than Turkey against Ukraine. Perhaps this is because Germany has three other close neighbours
- Britain, France and Italy - while Turkey only has two. This doesn't mean
Russia should not try to get Germany on side though, as they can cooperate
against both Poland and Britain, and an R/G alliance could be profitable to both.</P>
<P>  Of other powers, Britain is probably the one Russia will
come into contact with first.  With Sweden usually falling to Russia and
Norway to Britain, the two will be neighbours after the first year. Nonetheless,
the rest of their SC's are quite distant from one another, and Russia's earlier
interests here are either to keep the peace in Scandinavia, or to steer Britain - south (if Germany is going to help against Poland) or against Germany (if Germany is making claims on Sweden). No matter what, it is unlikely
that a very strong Britain is in Russia's longer term interests, as a strong
Britain could block Russia's entry into the Atlantic. </P>
<P>  Egypt is
also not that far away from Russia, especially if Egypt or Russia capture
Iran from Turkey at some point. Russia's relationship with Egypt is a bit
contradictory. Russia wants Egypt to stay as a counterbalance to a strong
Turkey, but not pose such a significant threat to Turkey that Turkey wont
threaten Ukraine. Once Ukraine is gone, Egypt can prove a valuable ally in taking out Turkey if that is what Russia chooses to do. However, if Russia
wants to get out of the Black Sea, Egypt can easily block Russia at Istanbul.
Therefore, it's probably best to have a weaker Egypt helping Russia against
Turkey, one that will not be able to grow quickly enough to prevent Russia
from moving into the Mediterranean. This may make the fight against Turkey
a tougher one, but if the southern seas are Russia's goal, it is probably
the way to go.</P>
<P>  The powers that remain are France and Spain. Being
on the other side of the map, they are mostly useful for gathering information
and spreading disinformation in the early game. Their actions may however
have repercussions felt all the way in Russia. A France fighting Spain along
with Britain might increase the chances of Germany coming to the help of
Russia, for example. Also, a strong France or Spain provides a welcome to
powers who might otherwise turn their forces to defend against Russia.</P>
<U><P>Russia in General</P>
</U>
<P>  Looking at Russia's record in finished
games to date, one finds an interesting pattern. Russia had 23 eliminations,
as well as eight survivals. Furthermore, of these survivals, there were two wins
and four draws. This shows both a very high elimination rate, as well as a high success (win/draw) rate when Russia does survive. This confirms Russia's
do or die position in Modern.  On one hand, its share of problems early in the game is usually larger than that of other powers. On the other hand,
Russia's flexibility and growth potential however make it a formidable force
in the midgame and endgame. </P>
<P>   All in all, I believe that Russia
is one of the most interesting powers to play in Modern. A unique position,
unique challenges and unique possibilities. Hopefully this article will help you to move beyond the problems that face Russia and take full advantage
of her strengths. But remember, your size will intimidate your neigbhours

<B><u>General Comments about Russia</u>
</B>
<I><P>"I played Russia in euro97 and was eliminated rather early. Three glaring mistakes were evident.
The first was tactical, allowing Poland to take Bielorussia in exchange
for me taking Lithuania and a peace treaty.  The second was strategic, allying
with Poland against Ukraine.  After about two years of fruitless border skirmishes with Ukraine (while Poland acquired neutrals without a fight),
Poland viscously stabbed me and I was eliminated within two more years.  Bielorussia was their jumping-off point. The third mistake was ignoring
Poland's construction of a second fleet, which he used to great advantage
in his stab.  My advice to Russians:
<ol>
<li>Sabotage a P/U alliance at any cost!!!  P/U alliance = death for Russia, unless Turkey is your supremely loyal friend.
<li>Polish occupation of Bielorussia
is unacceptable.  Bie is rightfully yours - take it.
<li>Reach an
agreement with Turkey about Georgia before the opening turn.  Stick to it
- a friendly Turkey is a wonderful insurance policy against Ukrainian aggression.
Also use the idea of a powerful Ukraine to Turkey's north as rhetorical
ammo against a U/T against you during your negotiations with Turkey.
<li>Poland is your most dangerous adversary.  Ukraine cannot harm you without
help - all they can do is engage you in border skirmishing, especially if
they have to worry about Turkey.  Poland can mount a successful invasion
if they have Bie and use the sea to their advantage (which Ukraine can't
do outside of Rostov).  More than one Polish fleet is a red flag for trouble."</I>

<I><P>"I allowed Poland to grow large
the first year to see if a large Poland would be an asset to Russia. In all the games I've seen Poland gets the tar kicked out of them and I wanted
to see something different.
Just for the record it was a bad idea
and next time you run Russia I advise a quick Polish demise like usual.
I think the attack on Ukraine had potential but not enough gains in general. Better to bounce Poland and take Bie.

was going on in my head and I thought I'd share the experiment since it just blew up in my face. :)" </I>- Anonymous (academy4)</P>

you end up going Poland will end up in your way, so getting Italy or Germany

is utterly wrong. Russia should try to negotiate his way into Sweden and
try to use it as a bargaining chip later on, but there are too many other
problems to waste time on a Scandinavian strategy.
The biggest danger
Russia faces early on, in my opinion, is the Polish-Ukrainian alliance. Poland is almost certainly going to attack, so the key for Russia is Ukraine.
Ukraine probably won't attack Poland, so Russia should try to convince him to go after Turkey or into the Balkans, preferably after Turkey.  At
the same time, Russia should encourage everyone within reach of Ukraine to harass him.  An early exit for Ukraine greatly improves Russia's chances.
Of course, an early exit for Poland would be even better, but this
is not usually a realistic option.  If Ukraine will go after Poland, that
changes everything, but Russia should certainly not rely on it." </I>- Jeff

for more right off the bat. Come to an agreement with Turkey over Georgia and
stick to it.  Turkey is far more valuable as a friend than as an enemy, especially if Ukraine is unfriendly.  Bie is a very important space - don't

<I><P>"My best advice? To win the game, natch!  ;^)  Well, securing a build or two would

- Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I><P>"If Ukraine seems to be reasonable in opening
negotiations, I think Russia should give serious thought to voluntarily giving
Rostov to Ukraine in exchange for an alliance (and probably
some other sort of remuneration can be arranged as well.)  It could
be especially good if they could arrange to have Russia's southern fleet
disbanded.  Ukraine will be quite relieved that Russia does not need any
naval presence in the south, while Russia, hopefully, will gain Ukraine's
alliance, preventing the very dangerous PU alliance.  Although this is not
any specific opening per se, I would suggest that this tactic be called the Rostov Gambit." </I>- Chuck Carroll</P>
<I><P>"Initial strategy?  Diplomatically,
work on a deal with one of Poland, Ukraine or Turkey to work against the

to
sweeten deals with a good ally.  Tactically, seizing Sweden is
important, and perhaps winning the race to Iran.  Though Russia has the largest starting position, she has perhaps the smallest growth potential

Germany, Poland, Austria, Czech Rep. Lithuania, Bielorussia, Hungary, Rumania,

on where you build your fleets. If Rostov is where the boats are, Turkey,
Bulgaria, Greece, Iran, Serbia, Croatia and Venice are withing your grasp.

in the south, but the real front is up north.  If you can get into the Balkans,
you've got it made."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I><P>"How to win? By getting 33 SC's.
:) Or...get Turkey to distract Ukraine at the beginning.  Move with strength
into Volga and CRP, and take inland Ukrainian SC's.  Move west against Poland, keeping
alliance with Turkey.  Once Polish lands are secured, secondary targets are Britain and Turkey.  Encourage Italy and Egypt to 'contain' Turkey, while France, Germany, and/or Spain 'contain' Britain.  Grow on whichever
front is available.  Probably easier to go South first.
Slide army
through Kazakhstan, or if necessary shift a fleet to Caspian, to attack Turkey's flank.  Build at least one more Black Sea fleet, and take Sev, Odessa, Rumania, Georgia.  Move through Balkans. At this point, you should
be getting builds at a rate to build two Northern fleets per year.  Push
through Germany and Britain for the win. You will most likely not need to
invade Egypt of France.

<I><P>"As in standard Diplomacy -- Russia is the only

seas.   Lots of neighbours means lots of potential allies."</I> - Cait Glasson</P>
<I><P>"Russia's strengths are more apparent in the midgame than the opening.
Once he is the dominant power among Poland, Ukraine, and himself, he can
roll west as a land power or south through Turkey building a couple of fleets
along the way.  If Egypt has moved west through Africa or into Italy, it
is surprisingly easy for Russia to attack him once Turkey is gone.  Finally,
in the endgame, he can build northern fleets and go through Scandinavia,
so he should not find it difficult to avoid a stalemate."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Well, the number of home centers allows for some big gains, and the ports in the north and south allow a strong Russia to grow faster than
the rest of the pack if need be.  The corner position allows for a good defensive position, while the extra home centers allow for a good offense."</I>

<I><P>"IMHO, the partitions in
Norway and the northern seas allow more protection against Britain (than
in Standard dip).  Russia should seek to exploit that. Maybe at some point

build a fleet in Murmansk and prepare an invasion in Norway (but that should
not be the primary concern)."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>

natural alliance.  It is very easy to maintain and the enemy is always Russia.
There is a possibility that Turkey or even Britain will join in, but even
without a third enemy, if no one attacks Poland or Ukraine, Russia has virtually
no chance.  I would expect Russia to be the first one out more often than
any other country."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Russia's #1 weakness:  Volga."</I> - Theo Kermanidis</P>

like trying to hit Britain or Turkey early and then dealing with closer neighbours later, but these are unlikely to succeed.
Russia also
has no neutral SC's that cannot be just as easily contested by another power,
and thus Russia has to be worried about getting no builds in the first year."

<B><P><u>Russia - Advantageous or Disadvantageous Starting Position?</u>

he has to fight his way through his neighbors.  Compared to Italy or others,
he is slightly disadvantaged."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>

advantageous.  Controlling the corner is helpful, but don't expect to get

fleet can bite you here!  Expect violent Ukrainian complaints if you open
here."</I> - Clark Valentine</P>
<B><P><u>Bottlenecks About Which Russia Should
be Aware</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Russia probably has less of a need to be concerned
with bottlenecks than any other player."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I><P>"Heh...
The Baltic Sea, for one.  There is also Volga.  If Ukraine punches through,
the fleet in Ros can be isolated and lost easily.  Otherwise, it looks to
me as it's going to be a 'front' war.  Just establish an enemy and set up
your front line."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"Send the army in Murmansk
south.  I believe there is no future in going to Scandinavia."</I> - Jeff
Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Most importantly the Poland line from LIT south along
the Polish SC's to CZE, and then across the south of Germany.  This can be
broken by a fleet in the north, but otherwise will stand. Secondly, Istanbul.
IST can be blockaded from both sides. Thirdly, Kazakhstan. Like IST, KAZ
can be held easily from both sides."</I> - Simon Withers</P>
<I><P>"Bielorussia
can be a bottleneck."</I> - Theo Kermanidis</P>
<I><P>"There's a significant
one in the south, with Kaz on one side, and Geo/Arm/Cau on the other.  The
Caspian sea is useful in getting past these.  To break through, you'll need
fleets (Caspian or Black)."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I><P>"Istanbul and
Volga.  If Russia does well in the south - which is hard, the Turks have
two ports on the Black, as do the Ukrainians, to the Russian one - then they can be effectively stuffed back into the Black Sea for good by an Egyptian
with a couple of fleets.  And ain't no way the Russian will get out of that,
short of a long, long walk from Rostov to Cairo.  Volga is a large territory
with several important borders: Gorky, Rostov, Kazakhstan, and the Ukraine.
But it's only one province, and often has several needed uses at the same
time."</I> - Cait Glasson</P>
<B><P><u>Most Important Advice for Russia</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Beg that Poland and Ukraine never ally themselves."</I> - Theo
Kermanidis</P>
<I>
<P>"Lay low at the beginning.  You don't want to draw
too much attention to yourself, especially since you're starting with 5 units."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"Don't try and win fast.   Starting
with five units means you're an easy target for DCM (diplomatic countermeasures).
Turkey says to the Ukraine, hey, you can fight me, but if you do, look at that behemoth behind you.  Start out by being generous with your allies,
and ruthless with your enemies.  Recognize the existence of unit envy."</I>
- Cait Glasson</P>
<I><P>"Choose you're friends, not your enemies, because
your enemies will choose you."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I><P>"Make it
to the midgame.  Don't abandon the Southern front.  Ukraine is bigger, but
Poland is probably more dangerous."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I><P>"The most
important advice for Russia is, and I can't emphasize this enough, to break
up any P/U alliance at all costs!!!  P + U = Doom for R!!!  The only way
that I see to survive is for Turkey and Germany to come to your rescue and
this is unlikely for Germany who'll be busy with F and B."</I> - Clark Valentine</P>
<B><P><u>Player Comments on Russia and Bielorussia (Belarus)</u>
</B><I><P>"For me, Belarus should be a plum offered to Poland or the Ukraine to ensure happiness among
allies."</I> - Cait Glasson</P>
<I>
<P>"Bielorussia is a possible ignition
point between Ukraine and Poland and every advantage should be taken to ensure that occurs. Declare neutrality over Bielorussia and then wait for
requests for support by either power to Bielorussia. Then use your diplomatic
guile to start a war between Poland and Ukraine." </I>- Theo Kermanidis</P>
<I><P>"Bielorussia is one of the two most important provinces for Russia,
and must be owned.  Try to get two armies against it in the fall of 1995."
</I>- Simon Withers</P>
<I><P>"Vitally important.  Gateway to Moscow.  Don't let Poland have it unless you get significant concessions elsewhere,
then insist it remain DMZ'ed.  Any foreign army in Bie is unacceptable."</I>
- Clark Valentine</P>
<I>
<P>"I'd try for it, but if it meant the difference
between having an ally and having an enemy, give it up.  If allied with Poland, I'd let him have it, seeing as he's smaller and all (perception is key).  If allied with Ukraine, I'd want it, so my armies don't have to
take the long way into Poland.  By mid-game, Russia needs Bie to get the
armies moving."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I>
<P>"Belarus is more important
to Poland than it is to Russia.  Taking it means Russia is doing well, but
it should not particularly be an early target.  It is more sensible to take
Belarus after flanking it either to the north or south (usually the south)."</I>
- Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"It's not as important as a lot of people
believe.  At the beginning, at least, let Poland have it."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I><P>"Obviously, I think it is critical.  Russia must solve the Ukraine,
Poland triangle.  Any solution that does note have Ukraine and Poland ganging
up on Russia is acceptable.  Any other solution is not."</I> - Paul Rosenzweig</P>
<I><P>"Bie is the easiest SC in Russia's reach.  You can't count on Lit,
because if Poland has a truce with Germany, he can have</P>
<P>three units
around Lit before F-1995.  So, Bielorussia is a sensitive point.  (In a lot of openings though), Bie is out of reach, and you can only ask Poland
to bounce Ukraine there in exchange for giving him Lit.</I>" <I>- </I>Charles
Dauphin</P>
<B><P><u>Russia and the Baltics (Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia)</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Latvia and Lithuania are your route into Poland - use them."</I>
- Simon Withers</P>
<I><P>"Estonia is only good for retreats.  Latvia is
interesting in the event that you have two fleets in that region.  Lithuania
will be
essential if you want to push into Poland."</I> - Charles
Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"Again, unless Poland is your initial axis of advance,
let the Pole have Lithuania.  It will make him happy, and could lead to a visit to Sweden for the Russian northern fleet, as well as bouncing the
English out of Norway."</I> - Cait Glasson</P>
<I><P>"Well, since there's
only the one center, just make sure no one else gets them (except maybe Poland in Lith).  If they're DMZed, then you have no worries there."</I>
- Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I><P>"Poland should not be allowed north of Lithuania."</I>
- Rick Desper</P>
<I><P>"Estonia is a great help to Russia because it prevents
a fleet in Latvia from attacking St Petersburg.  As long as Russia prevents
an enemy army (fleets are okay) from occupying Latvia, the Baltics should not of much concern.  From an offensive standpoint, a Russian army in Latvia
is very helpful, but will not usually be practical until Russia is doing
fairly well.  Early on, Russia's armies have more important duties."</I>
- Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Poland will rightly view Russian forces here
with considerable alarm.  Lit is to Poland what Bie is to you.  This will
take some negotiation, but try to DMZ it unless you're going to war with
P."</I> - Clark Valentine</P>
<I><P>"Estonia is important only when defending
StP from a hostile power. Latvia is always a potential ignition point for
conflicts between Russia and a hostile power (probably Poland) - territory
to declare as a DMZ. Lithuania is Polands glass jaw and an obvious launch
point for a campaign against Poland."</I> - Theo Kermanidis</P>
<B><P><u>Russia and Scandinavia (Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Finland and Lapland)</u>
</B>
<I><P>"A key area for Russia.  To make the breakout into the Atlantic,
you need Scandinavia.  You've also got an extra front to attack Poland/Geramny
from. I'd go for Scandinavian domination as soon as it's feasible."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I>
<P>"Norway: later in the game... much later.  Sweden: within reach the first year, however, the key is Finland and getting
A Mur there in S-1995."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"I think Sweden
should be negotiated for with the idea of bartering it away later on in exchange for either British neutrality or a German attack on Poland. Lapland
is an important DMZ.  It makes it much easier for Russia to obtain a neutrality
pact with Britain."   </I>- Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Russia should secure
Sweden.  If he can keep an army in Finland, so much the better.  Scandinavia
is not a primary front.  The</P>
<P>purpose of being over there is to prevent
German or British breakthroughs."</I> - Rick desper</P>
<I><P>"Scandinavia
is a point of contention between Britain, Germany, Poland and Russia."</I>
- Theo Kermanidis</P>
<I><P>"For Russia to win, he needs to take and hold
Scandinavia as a forward  defense against Germany and Britain.  This is actually possible, with some early fleet builds in Murmansk and St.Petersburg."</I>
- Cait Glasson</P>
<I><P>"I think you want stability here.  Don't concentrate
on this too much, the South is far more significant for you.  Come to a quick agreement with B, G, and/or P over the division of Scandinavia and
then leave well enough alone.  Come back to it midgame. Finland is all yours
and fight for it.  There is no such thing as a defensive army in Lapland
- anyone (including you) who moves an army there is on the attack, in my opinion.  Same with GOB."</I> - Clark Valentine</P>
<I>
<P>"Until you can hold it,
in Scandinavia, a balance of power is the best possible position, with Britain
having a unit in Norway, Germny a fleet in Denmark, and you holding Sweden.
Lapland is the road to Murmansk and so enemy units should not be tolerated,
however as Britain is not too likly to try for it until the mid-game you
are probably safe not defending until then." </I>- Simon Withers</P>
<B><P><u>Russia
and the Caucasus (Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia)</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Keep the
peace with Turkey."</I> - Theo Kermanidis</P>
<I>
<P>"Russia should really
try to get Georgia.  This is a front for secondary development, once primary
problems are taken care of."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I>
<P>"Georgia can play
the same role Belarus did in the centre; it can be offered as a plum to an ally.  If Turkey is the ally, offer him
Georgia uncontested as
a way to keep him happy while you're adventuring in the north."</I> - Cait
Glasson</P>
<I>
<P>"Depends on relations with P and U, and also T.  But minor in the early stages."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"Make an agreement
with T over Georgia and stick to it.  You need T as a friend."</I> - Clark
Valentine</P>
<I><P>"Depends on relations with Turkey.  I'd try to diplomatically
take Georgia, seeing as the other neutrals are easily contested.  If Turkey's
friendly, DMZ the entire area (maybe setting up a bounce in Geo between Ros and Ank?)."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<B><P><u>Russia and Central Asia
(Kazakhstan, Iran)</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Russian interests here are to keep it
DMZ'd.  Turkish or Egyptian units in Iran aren't a big deal, but any move
to Kaz means trouble for you."</I> - Clark Valentine</P>
<I>
<P>"If you can sneak into Iran, you've got it made.  A good long term plan would to
ally with Egypt and get his support into Iran.  That opens up a backdoor
into the Turkish centers.  If Turkey is your ally, then you can keep an army in Kaz to keep him from sneaking in you backdoor."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I>
<P>"Keep it empty."</i> - Rick Desper</P>
<I>
<P>"Either take it, or
defend against it.  Once again, uncontested access to Iran can be a plum
for the Turk, to keep him happy and keep his eyes off Rostov and Moscow."</I>
- Cait Glasson</P>
<I>
<P>"Kazakhstan is a good space for Russia.  Since
Russia is normally in Volga, Kaz makes a good launching point for a surprise
attack on Iran.  On the flip side, its presense as a buffer zone may make
it easier to convince Turkey not to keep an army in Iran.  Plus, a surprise
move to Kaz by an enemy is not as effective as a Russian move because it
does not border any Russian centers."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<B><P><u>Russian
North</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Ural and Siberia: retreats... (hope it never comes
to that). However a fleet in the Urals combined with a fleet in Murmansk
can be a life saver in the case of a British invasion.  You should keep those regions empty unless you plan a massive strike against Britain."</I>
- Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"The north is a fall back line in defense -
otherwise vacate when on the offense."</I> - Theo Kermanidis</P>
<I><P>"Murmansk
should go to take Sweden, eitehr Lap or Fin.  Urals and Siberia allow you
to move armies north and south reasonably quickly."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I><P>"Hopefully, never ever see a foreign face there.  Xenophobia's the
order of the day..."</I> - Cait Glasson</P>
<I><P>"Ideally, Russia should
have no units in this area.  If he does, it means he is being attacked from
the north which is a very big problem."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"If
you have to worry about Ura and Sib, you've lost. IMHO, you can't move to
Lap defensively.  Any foreign army moving to Lap
means an attack on either Swe or Mur, and soon."</I> - Clark Valentine</P>
<B><P><u>Russian
South</u>
</B><I><P>"Volga and CRP are the heart of the Russian position.
His chances improve if he can occupy these two provinces (along with Moscow).
If an enemy gets into Volga, Russia has one foot in the grave."</I> - Jeff
Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Make a move to Volga mo matter what.  If Ukraine gets
it, you're dead.  You can drive him out, but he'll retreat behind your lines
and cause all sorts of problems.  Even if you bounce, at least Ukraine isn't
there.  Rostov should go for Georgia, probalby Russia's most secure build
in the early going."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I><P>"Attack Ukraine. By
no means let Ukraine into Volga. A primary point here is that the Russian
player must recognize that
the fleet in Rostov can move to Volga,
and therefore it can support actions into Volga.  That's a great move for
Russia."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I><P>"For my money, hammer Ukraine.  Ukraine
is my initial target of  choice, unless they're willing to make a pretty
good deal to keep my interests elsewhere."</I> - Cait Glasson</P>
<I><P>"Use
Volga and CRP to gain the advantage over Ukraine if not allied. Keep Rostov
open for potential builds, but if neutral with Turkey build armies only so as not to upset her."</I> - Theo Kermanidis</P>
<I><P>"This was the big battlegound in euro97 between R and U.  If U is an enemy, expect to lose Ros unless T is a firm ally.  Watch out - a U fleet in Ros can support
attacks into Vol due to the canal!!!  Defend  Vol and CRP as if you life
depended on it - for it does!"</I> - Clark Valentine</P>
<B><P><u>Russian Navy</u>
</B><I><P>"How much of a navy does Russia need? As much as it takes to keep P out of GOB, B out of Brn, and contain U.  If this can be
done diplomatically, so much the better.  Russia has never had a very good
navy; don't go against hundreds of years of history. Russia is a land power."</I>
- Clark Valentine</P>
<I>
<P>"I think Russia will need a significant Atlantic
navy in the long run.  To win, you'll need Scandinavia, Poland, Germany and as much of Britain and the lowlands as possible.  Any gains made up north are that much less you need in the south. Besides, to take on Britain,
you'll need lots of naval firepower."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I>
<P>"You
can manage with just the one fleet in StP for the early stages.  However
if you are fighting Poland and/or Germany, the first</P>
<P>thing you build
is F StP.  You'll need it."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"I'm a bad one to ask, as I'm fascinated by seapower in diplomacy.  I think a southern
navy is an unlikely possibility, unless Turkey and Ukraine are both getting
hammered by, say, Poland, Italy and Egypt, in which case the Istanbul bottleneck
works both ways.  In the north, however, a strong navy can be a gamewinner,
as a fleet built in Murmansk one turn can be off the coast of Portugal two
years later.  The sea spaces are =big=, which means fast, and the ability
to convoy that army to Portugal is a joy to behold."</I> - Cait Glasson</P>
<I><P>"Russia initially a minimal navy. Later, in campaigns against Germany
or Britain, it is important to gain the edge with naval strength."</I> -
Theo Kermanidis</P>
<I><P>"Not much (of a navy) is needed until the mid
game."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I><P>"I don't think Russia needs much of a navy at the start, especially in the north.  In the south, an extra fleet
or two can be very helpful.  A second fleet in the south should definitely
be a goal as soon as it is feasible to build one.  In the north, a navy will hopefully not be needed until the endgame.  If Russia is allied with
Turkey, he should try to arrange for a second fleet fairly early while Ukraine
is still a plausible threat.  Turkey will object strongly later on.
Russia may find himself in a position where an extra army would greatly
ease his defense, but is not absolutely necessary.  In that case, he should
prefer to build a second fleet in the Black Sea even if it puts him a bit
more at risk of a land assault."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<B><P><u>Russia and
the Arctic Seas </u>
</B><I><P>"As long as no one else occupies it, not
much (important).  You can get out to the Atlantic just as quickly along
the coast."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I>
<P>"If these spaces are occupied
early on or even in the middle game by either Russia or another power, Russia
is probably in trouble.  Russia should strive to hold off building a northern
fleet as long as possible."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<I>
<P>"Minor importance
in the early stages of the game. Can be vital for retreats or supported invasions of Norwegian Sea or NAO."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"The
primary goal is to keep the Brits out of Barents. Well, if anybody is in
the White Sea, Russia is in big trouble."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I><P>"Very
important.  If Britain comes knocking, this is the garden path for them."</I>
- Cait Glasson</P>

<B><P><u>Russia and the Baltic Seas</u>
</B><I><P>"Very

<P><b><u>Russia and the Black Sea</u>

<I>
<P>"This
is tremendously important."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I>
<P>"This area is very
important, as the presence of a Russian fleet is a threat to both Turkey

not to upset Turkey in the process. Should the latter occur, withdraw the
fleet if intending to keep Turkey neutral/friendly."</I> - Theo Kermanidis</P>

<I><P>"Well, it depends on the relationship with Ukraine.  I think Poland makes a slightly better ally than Ukraine, though.
Poland can help you in Scandinvia, while Ukraine stands in the way of the

Russia should commit a considerable effort to making Ukraine's life miserable.

<P>Naturally, Russia should also spend
a lot of time talking to Ukraine.  If he can be convinced to take just one

<I><P>"Germany (as well as Egypt and Italy, for my money) should
be part of whatever plan you make in the primaries (Poland, Ukriane and Turkey).  Each of them has a natural enemy that is similar to one of your
three initial targets.  The hammer can fall much faster with an anvil underneath
it."</I> - Cait Glasson</P>
<I><P>"Sure, you'd like Germany to attack Poland
immediately, but it is really not in his best interests and you will likely
lose credibility if you badger him about it.  What you want most from Germany
at the start is access to Sweden and neutrality.  Stay in touch, though.  Germany is a good midgame ally.
Later on, if Germany has solved
his opening problems, he can be a very valuable ally against Poland.  It
is at this point that you should start seriously talking to him about attacking
Poland.  Also, if Britain is building a northern force to attack you, Germany
will probably also feel threatened and should be approached about an anti-British
alliance.  In this case, your ideal achievement is to get Germany to present
a unified front with you <b>before</b> Britain attacks in order to convince him
to look elsewhere.  Prior to the endgame, you don't want war with Britain
if it can possibly be avoided.  Even if you win the war, you will likely
lose significant ground elsewhere."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Germany
could be brought into the anti-Polish coalition." </I>- Rob Serandos</P>
<B><P><u>Russia and Britain</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Britain, being Germany's most natural enemy is a great friend in Scandinavia. Use that to your advantage."</I>
- Simon Withers </P>
<I><P>"Britain represents a major long term threat.
I'd consider working with France/Spain/Germany to get rid of him quickly.
If he gets entrenched, then he'l be hard to take out, and you'll have to
dominate the south entirely, not an easy task."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I><P>"Be friendly. Very."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"Try to keep
Sweden from being a British target."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I><P>"You've
got enough potential enemies, so be nice to Britain."</I> - Jim Kloss</P>
<I><P>"Britain should be held at arm's length wherever possible, hopefully
with sweetness and light, but if necessary by a small group of fleets in
BRN, White and Mur.  A breakout for some Atlantic raiding can drive the British to distraction."</I> - Cait Glasson</P>
<I><P>"Britain can be a useful ally in
Scandinavia to help offset Polish or German ambitions there."</I> - Clark Valentine</P>
<I><P>"Be cordial initially and encourage Britain to look south. Stay neutral
during Britain/German clashes."</I> - Theo Kermanidis</P>
<I>
<P>"Neutrality, first and foremost, should be Russia's relationship
with Britain.  Beyond that, you don't want Britain to steamroller Germany,
but you don't want the two of them to be best of chums either.  If they are, Scandinavia, northern Russia (Britain) and the Baltics (Germany) are
a natural place for them to work together.  Usually, it will be best to offer Sweden to Britain as a concession as some point. If things go well,
you may be able to offer Sweden to Germany in the midgame in exchange for
Germany attacking Poland."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<B><P><u>Russia
and Egypt</u>
</B><I><P>"Don't worry about it too much
at the beginning.  Neither of you want Turkey to be too big, but Russia may very well need a big Turkey."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I>
<P>"Encourage
Egypt to expand into the Middle-East and engage Turkey."</I> - Theo Kermanidis</P>
<I><P>"Try to foment discontent between Turkey and Egypt.  You don't
want Turkey and Egypt allied, because that will encourage Turkey to take
Georgia and Rostov away, and if Turkey wants to, it can.  A secret, undeclared
alliance with Egypt is helpful."</I> - Jim Kloss</P>
<I><P>"If Turkey
is hostile, Egypt can make a good counterbalance.  He also can give the necessary support to break the Kaz/Aze/Geo bottleneck."</I> - Earle Ratcliffe</P>
<I>
<P>"Irrelevant, unless you want to take down Turkey.  Keep good relations,
they could be useful in the future."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"It
would seem natural to encourage Egypt to hassle Turkey to reduce the chances
that Turkey will attack Russia.  But this should not be the first choice.
First choice is to convince either Turkey or Ukraine to attack the other.
In that case, you'd just as soon Egypt left Turkey alone.  Still, you shouldn't
push too hard.  Egypt is likely to resent any attempt by Russia to influence
his policy early on.  And it is better to have Turkey attacked by both his
neighbors than neither one."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Egypt
could help against Turkey."</I> - Rob Serandos</P>
<I><P>"If T is your friend (and they should be) try to help T against them (diplomatically - feed them false info, etc.)  If
there is a U/T alliance against you, Egypt might be able to help."</I> -
Clark Valentine</P>
<B><P><u>Russia and Italy</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Heh... beware of Italy!!  Grows fast and can stab RU with a strong IG alliance."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"You know, Russia is closer to Italy than
to Egypt.  A strong Italian presence in the Balkans is good for Russia, as it keeps Ukraine and Turkey busy."</I> - Rick Desper</P>
<I><P>"Russia and Italy should be very friendly
right from the start.  Italy should be encouraged to adopt a Balkan strategy
in the opening.  Later on, Italy can be helpful against several potential
enemies - Germany, Poland, Ukraine, Turkey, or Egypt. Britain is about the
only one Italy can't help against."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Encourage Italian expansion into the Balkans. This will turn the attention of Ukraine, Poland and Turkey to the
region. Seek neutrality during clashes between the powers in the region."</I>
- Theo Kermanidis</P>
<B><P><u>Russia and France</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Could be useful in the event of a strong Italy
or Germany."</I> - Charles Dauphin</P>
<I>
<P>"Nothing really until the middlegame and the odds are at least
one of you won't get there.  After that, it depends too much on the particular
game to make any guesses."</I> - Jeff Serandos</P>
<B><P><u>Russia and Spain</u>
</B>
<I><P>"Irrelevant, period."</I>
- Charles Dauphin</P>
<I><P>"Friendly.
As the two powers in extreme positions on the map Spain can be a useful source of information, and possible supply misinformation too."</I> - Theo
Kermanidis</P>
<I><P>"Not much you can do in the opening but hope.  And what you hope is that he doesn't
attack Italy so Italy can head east/north-east"</I>. - Jeff Serandos</P>
<I><P>"Stay friendly with them in the early game. Trade information."</I> - Clark Valentine</P>
<I><P>"Encourage Spain (and possibly France)
to distract Britain, largely, so Britain's fleets stay largely south."</I>
