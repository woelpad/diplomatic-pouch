<H3>What Do We Have Here?</H3>
<p align=justify>
In the sprit  of the holidays, we present for your entertainment (?) a
collection of carols.  Although this issue of the Zine was not published
until after the new year has turned, at least readers in holiday seasons
to come will be able to print these pages and traipse around their neighborhood
extolling the Diplomacy players' version of peace and brotherhood.
<p align=justify>
The idea for this collection came from Bradd W. Szonye, who had the
unmitigated gall to post his butchering of a fine Christmas song to the
<a href=news:rec.games.diplomacy>rec.games.diplomacy</a> newsgroup.
At the tail end of his post, he wrote:
"Uh-oh... I 'better watch out' myself, or that Manus Hand guy'll start asking
me to write articles for The Pouch."
<p align=justify>
Right he was, and you're the worse off for it, as you're about to find out.
So, with no further ado -- other than a bit of friendly advice to
hold your nose before diving in -- here are the lyrics to
the first-ever Diplomatic Pouch holiday song collection.

<H2 align=center>Austria is Coming to Town</H2>
<H4 align=center>To the tune of "Santa Claus is Coming to Town"<br>
Lyrics by <a href=mailto:bradds@concentric.net>Bradd W. Szonye</a><BR>
Apologies to Haven Gillespie and J. Fred Coots</H4>

<p align=center>
<b><u>Chorus:</u></b><BR>
You better talk fast<BR>
You better not lie<BR>
You better not stab, I'm tellin' you why<BR>
Austria is coming to town!
<p align=center>
He's writing his press<br>
He's reading it twice<br>
He's gonna find out who's loyal and nice<br>
Austria is coming to town
<p align=center>
He sees what you've been plotting<br>
He knows that you're a fake<br>
He knows you're gonna stab him soon<br>
But be good for appearances' sake!
<p align=center>
<b>(Repeat chorus)</b>
<p align=center>
With pastry and cake<BR>
And sausage for food<BR>
Vienna, Trieste, and Budapest too<BR>
Austria is coming to town
<p align=center>
When little red stars<BR>
And battleship boats<BR>
Are all that's left that walks or floats<BR>
Austria is coming to town
<p align=center>
The Russians and the Sultan<BR>
Will have a dirge to sing<BR>
When Romans land in Smyrna-town<BR>
And Galicia falls in spring
<p align=center>
<b>(Repeat chorus)</b>
<p align=center>
He's gonna stab the Kaiser<BR>
He's gonna stab the Pope<BR>
But he's gotta stop that juggernaut<BR>
Or he'll hang dead from a rope
<p align=center>
<b>(Repeat chorus)</b>

To the Tune of "It's a Small World"
<br>Lyrics by <a href=mailto:kirkwood@digital.net>Daniel
Kirkwood</a><br>
Apologies to Richard Sherman and Robert Sherman</H4>
<i>
<p align=center>
It's a world of armies, a world of fleets,<BR>
It's a world of victories and of defeats,<BR>
But it's too small to share, so it's time you're aware<BR>
That it's <b>my</b> world after all!
<p align=center>
It's a world of treachery, a world of fears,<BR>
It's a world of blood, sweat, and toil and tears,<BR>
And it cannot be shared; it is nought that you cared<BR>
For it's my world after all.
<p align=center>
<b><u>Chorus:</u></b><br>	It's a small world after all,<BR>
It's a small world after all,<BR>
It's a small world after all,<BR>
But it's mine, mine, mine <b>(ALL MINE!)</b>
<p align=center>
It's a world of plots and a world of schemes,<BR>
And I'm sorry to end all your precious dreams,<BR>
But though I hate to boast, it appears that you're toast<BR>
And it's my world after all.
<p align=center>
For our world's at war; it has never known peace;<BR>
And it may well end 'ere aggression doth cease;<BR>
Though you think it's a sin, I am going for the win:<BR>
It is my world after all.
<p align=center>
<b>(Repeat chorus)</b>
<p align=center>
It's a world of treaties and defense pacts,<BR>
It's a world of kind words and stabs in the back,<BR>
And since peace is a bore, it seems we're now at war:<BR>
And it's my world after all
<p align=center>

<H2 align=center>Let Him Grow</H2>
<H4 align=center>To the tune of "Let It Snow"<br>
Lyrics by <a href=mailto:manus@diplom.org>Manus Hand</a><br>
Apologies to Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne</H4>
<i>
<p align=center>
Oh, his center count size is frightful<BR>
But his press is so delightful<BR>
And since he's no bitter foe<BR>
Let him grow, let him grow, let him grow
<p align=center>
Oh, he doesn't show signs of stopping<BR>
His relentless province hopping<BR>
But his sights are set way down low<BR>
Let him grow, let him grow, let him grow
<p align=center>
When you finally say goodbye<Br>
How he'll hate it -- how much you'll be missed!<Br>
Through his tears, though, you realize<BR>
All your SC's are now his
<p align=center>
But until then he's such a nice guy<BR>
An "I'll never stab you twice" guy<BR>
You can't help it, you trust him so<BR>
Let him grow, let him grow, let him grow

<H2 align=center>Norway and Finland</H2>
<H4 align=center>To the tune of "Winter Wonderland"<br>
Lyrics by <a href=manus@diplom.org>Manus Hand</a><br>
Apologies to Dick Smith and Felix Bernard</H4>
<i>
<p align=center><b><u>Chorus:</u></b><BR>
English king, watch your steppin'<BR>
In the north, Russia's preppin'<BR>
And soon the North Sea<BR>
Will turn unfriendly<BR>
Convoying from Norway and Finland<BR>
----<BR>
Gone away, your Denmark-y<BR>
In its place, a Russian army<BR>
He sang a love song<BR>
And strung you along<BR>
Convoying from Norway and Finland<BR>
<p align=center>
He has piled white fleets up like a snowman<BR>
To pretend he'll visit Kaiser Brown<BR>
Who'll ask "Are you allied?" -- You'll say "No man!"<BR>
(And you'll be right when he's in London-town)<BR>
----<BR>
Later on, he'll conspire<BR>
'Cause he's such a good liar<BR>
He'll take you to school,<BR>
And take Liverpool<BR>
Convoying from Norway and Finland
<p align=center>
<b>(Repeat chorus)</b>
<p align=center>
He has piled white fleets up like a snowman<BR>
And now you feel like a circus clown<BR>
He'll have lots of fun with Mister Snowman<BR>
'Cause there's no way that you can knock 'im down<BR>
----<BR>
English king, ain't it thrillin'<BR>
As you watch your own killin'?<BR>
He'll frolic and play,<BR>
In his Russian way<BR>
Convoying from Norway and Finland<BR>
Convoying from Norway and Finland!
