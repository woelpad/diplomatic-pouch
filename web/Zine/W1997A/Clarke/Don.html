Discovering the Religion of 'Donism'</H1>
<H3 align=center><i>
Being an account of a Kiwi's first foray<br>into the Australian Tournament
Diplomacy scene</i></H3>

<H5><I>Author's note: This article includes ribald accounts of lewd behaviour,
drinking, carousing, and general loutishness. If

All the events happened as reported, to the best of my recollection.</I></H5>
<P>I have just returned from Australia where I competed in the sixth annual
Don Challenge Cup. I had an fantastic time, both socially and in the
competition.
I can only urge other Kiwi Diplomacy players to make the effort to get
over to a tournament in Australia -- it's well worth it. The games are great
fun, and the Aussies are great guys. This article is written for The Diplomatic
Pouch, since I promised Manus I'd write him a review. Putting it together is
not a chore, though...I gladly share with everyone my experiences.
<H3>
Why Go to Australia?</H3>
I decided in the middle of 1997 that I wanted to play some tournament Diplomacy.
Unfortunately, the Diplomacy scene in New Zealand is not as healthy as it
might be...as far as I can tell. There are no Diplomacy tournaments here
that I'm aware of; just small pockets of enthusiasts here and there that
play amongst themselves. There are some games conferences, and some Diplomacy
gets played there, but there are no dedicated Diplomacy tournaments. One
of the things I want to do over the next couple of years is remedy that.
This is an enormous task.
<p>After posting to rec.games.diplomacy early this year looking for Diplomacy
contacts in New Zealand, I received an email from <A HREF="mailto:bobblanchett@iname.com">Bob
Blanchett</A> (JudgeKeeper of <tt>AUME</tt>, a private Australian judge). Bob
runs a mailing
list called <A HREF="http://www.triode.net.au/~muz/ozdip-l.htm">OZDIP-L</A>
which is aimed at the Australian and New Zealand Diplomacy scene...a general
forum for discussion of Diplomacy. He saw my post and suggested I join
the list. I did, and it has proven to be an excellent decision. The Australian
Diplomacy tournament scene is pretty healthy, if limited in size. Through
discussions (okay, read trans-Tasman slanging matches if you will) I 'met'
several of the stalwarts of the Australian hobby. They encouraged me in
my efforts to build up the New Zealand hobby. I'm determined to run a tournament
in New Zealand, but since I had never played in one, I felt I needed to find out
what they were all about. Hence my trip to The Don Challenge Cup.
<H3>
History of The Don Challenge Cup</H3>
The Don is more than a Diplomacy tournament. It has a short, but very rich
history. Perhaps I should explain....
<P>Keywords: Greasing Train, <!-- Altar Boys, --> Latex Fist, Choker Pants.
<P>Clear? No, I didn't think so. Okay. Donism is a religion, founded by
<A HREF="mailto:kenspr@webaxs.net">Ken Sproat</A> (ex-president of the
<A HREF="http://thingy.apana.org.au/~ozdip">Diplomacy Association
of Australia</A>) and Anthony Swinnerton on a train ride to a tournament
in Sydney in 1992, after World DipCon in Canberra earlier that year. What
follows is Ken's account of the origins of Donism, as told at the head
of a table in a little wood fired pizza place on Brunswick Street, Melbourne,
late on the Saturday night of The Don this year.
<blockquote><I>Picture the scene: A crowd has gathered outside the venue for
World DipCon
in Canberra, Australia, 1992. It's the first morning...everyone is excited.
People are mingling...renewing old friendships, eyeing up opponents, ribbing
good friends.... Plenty of nervous repartee. Off to one side of the crowd
stands a lone figure...Don Del Grande, an American player of some note.
Let's just say that Don's fashion sense sets him apart from the crowd.</I>
<P><I>During the Tournament, all accounts were that Don didn't say much.
His Diplomacy style was, errr...somewhat limited. Tending towards the "Yeah
okay man," and not a lot else. He seemed a quite shy person. Completely
the opposite to the big, brash, convivial stereotype we have for Americans
down-under. Not quite what one had expected from someone who had made the
effort to come all the way from the States for a Diplomacy tournament....
<P>...Later that year, we find the scene has shifted
to Ken Sproat and Anthony Swinnerton standing on the platform at Spencer
Street Railroad Station waiting for a train to a tournament in Sydney.
A train rolls by with 'Greasing Train' emblazoned on the side. Presumably,
the Greasing Train was used to grease the tracks. In a few short minutes
the beginnings of Donism was born....</i>
<P>[It should be pointed out that the end product, Donism, and all it's
peculiarities, are no reflection or comment on Don Del Grande himself.
His attendance at WorldDipCon just served as a catalyst for Ken and Anthony's
repressed schoolboy imaginations to break free. From the most innocent
seeds, something monstrous was born.]
<P><I>...From the few foibles of the real Don Del Grande that were observed
at the World DipCon, a new, some say mythical, Don was created in the minds
of Ken and Anthony on that fateful day. Don was the high priest of Donism.
His followers were called Donists. Don's preferred mode of transport to
and from Diplomacy tournaments was the Greasing Train.
<!--
At each stop, his
disciples would jump off the Greasing Train and capture </i>altar boys<i> for
Don. I refuse to descend into the detailed description Ken gave me of the
activities inside the Greasing Train, but Latex Fist should point you in
somewhere near the right direction.
-->
<P>Don wears choker pants...those chinos that some men wear pulled up
above their navels, at the expense of the correct leg length near the ankles.
Don's pants are held up by red braces.
<P>During the Sydney '92 tournament, Clive Lane turned up. He had no
facial hair, in contrast to Don; Clive wore glasses, Don does not; Clive
was a snappy dresser (again, in contrast to Don). It was immediately apparent
that Clive was the Anti-Don, and that Clivism was obviously an overt threat
to Donism. Donists and Clivists do not see eye to eye.
<P>In one of the games in that tournament, Anthony Swinnerton was matched
against Adrian Appleyard. It would be fair to say that if you described
what Anthony did to Adrian in that game, and you used the term proctology,
you'd be pretty close to the mark. The game was dubbed "Latex Fist," and
so the latex fist symbol was forever woven into the lore of Donism.
<P>That night, Adrian and Paul Appleyard, Neil Ashworth, and Anthony
Swinnerton played "Don Scrabble," while Ken Sproat slept on the couch. In
Don Scrabble, you may only use Don Words, and you must justify why they
are to be considered Don words. From this game, many interesting facets
of Donism were unearthed. Most particularly, it was discovered that Don
has a pet Rhinoceros called Bertie.
<P>Later the same weekend, an unfortunate Spanish restaurant in Sydney
called 'Raphaels' was the scene of the first Donist drinking game. It went
like this: The first player had to begin a story, and then each subsequent
player would add to the story. When a storyteller said "Don," or in fact
any word that contained the syllable "Don," such as Essen<b>don</b>, or
Ortho<b>don</b>tist,
everyone had to make a noise like what you would expect to hear when Bertie
was being mounted...a long, drawn-out, nasal, rhinoceros snort fitted the
bill just nicely. The last person to make the noise had to consume the
contents of his vessel, and then was obliged to continue the story....
<P>Those are the essential elements of the birth of Donism.</I>
<P><I>Ken returned home to Jan Juc, just out of Melbourne, and set about
organising the first Don Challenge Cup to celebrate the newfound religion
of Donism. The tournament was held in November 1992. The way Ken tells
it, the tournament was opened with the famous words:</I>&nbsp; <I>"We welcome
you to to the Don Challenge Cup, and as Bertie would say...[Long loud nasal
rhinoceros snort...]."</I>&nbsp; <I>Every person who stabbed during the
tournament was given a latex glove as a trophy. However, certain anonymous
witnesses who claim to have been there have no recollection of such an
opening phrase, nor in fact of any gloves being presented. Perhaps these are
just embellishments to the legend of The Don, or perhaps the more conservative,
anal-retentive members of the hobby have selective memory when
it comes to the more -- shall we say, risqu&eacute; -- aspects of the hobby's
history?</I></blockquote>
That was just the beginning. Since then, The Don Challenge Cup has been
held six times. Each year, more flavour seems to have been wound into its
history. One year an ambulance was called when a player collapsed after
a GM made an unfavourable decision against him. I have been to Pabs Tavern,
and stood on the spot of 'The Collapsing'...you can feel the ghosts. The
Don has seen shirts removed and ribald songs sung. The Don Challenge Cup itself
is presently in need of repair. There are rumours that an incident involving
much drinking was involved in this coming to pass. Chants lamenting the
inability of one to 'bugger the hedgehog' were not out of place this year
in a certain Brunswick Street cafe.
<P>I must say however that The Don's flavour really needs to be sampled
through amber lensed goggles, in person.
<P>Only three people have ever won the Don Challenge Cup:

Diary of The Don Challenge Cup 1997</H3>
<H4>
The Anticipation...</H4>
Friday November 28th. I set off for my first Diplomacy tournament. It is
also my first visit to Melbourne.
<P>When booking my trip I knew The Don was on Saturday the 29th and Sunday the
30th of November. The question I asked myself was: Do you want to go across
just for the weekend and the Diplomacy tournament, or should you take the
following three weeks off work and follow the New Zealand cricket team around
Australia for the first half of the One Day series against Australia and
South Africa? Any of you who know much about cricket probably think that's
an easy decision...go for the weekend, and come home and do something enjoyable,
right? (For those of you who don't know about cricket, New Zealand isn't
exactly renowned for winning in recent years, whereas Australia and South
Africa are two of the best sides in the world.) Well, call me a beggar
for punishment, but I decided that the cricket trip was the way to go.
I love the game, err, sorry, <b>religion</b> of cricket so much that the appeal
of being at the Adelaide Oval for the first ever international game under
lights, and the prospect of seeing New Zealand vs. Australia at the M.C.G. was
just too tempting. More on the cricket later....
<P>One amusing little tale from the flight to Melbourne: The plane took
off at 7.30 a.m. New Zealand time. Consequently we were served with breakfast.
One of the staple breakfast cereals down-under is Wheatbix. In case they're
not so common in whichever part of the world you happen to be reading this,
Wheatbix are biscuits of malted wheat flakes. The biscuits are about one inch
across
and three inches long, and perhaps half an inch thick. Accepted practice is
to pour milk over them, maybe a little sugar, even some diced fresh fruit.
The sugar and the fruit are optional. The milk is a required item. Without
the milk, Wheatbix are extremely dry and unpleasant eating. Apparently the
elderly Asian couple across the aisle from me had never been instructed
in the art of Wheatbix consumption. She had a go first, extracting the
first biscuit from it's wrapper. A quizzical look crossed her face. She
examined it from all sides. She sniffed it. Then she took a bite...heroically,
she chewed for over a minute, trying to produce enough saliva to allow
her to swallow this thing. After that experience she obviously decided
Wheatbix were way too bland on their own. Thankfully, Qantas had been thoughtful
enough to provide her with a small sachet of strawberry jam! After liberally
coating the remainder of the biscuit in strawberry jam, she seemed to enjoy
her encounter with Kiwi breakfast cereals much more. What's more, she had
a lovely jug of milk to wash it all down with afterwards. Her husband took
a more artistic approach, using both of his Wheatbix like two pieces of
bread in a sandwich, and using the fruit slices (oranges and mango) as
the filling. He too seemed quite delighted with the result. I can just
imagine the stories when they got home..."You would not believe what they
eat for breakfast...."
<P>In Melbourne, Bob Blanchett met me at the airport. After dumping my pack
at his place we had a look around the inner city. We visited the Rembrandt
exhibition at the art gallery. I'm not an art buff, but this guy was something
else! The exhibition consisted of a selection of Rembrandt's work, and
that of some of his more noted students who attempted to emulate the master's
revolutionary use of light and shading. Even without reading the captions to
the paintings I found that I could without fail identify the Rembrandts from
the non-Rembrandts....his works were just so superior to those who tried
to copy what he was doing. Following that, we went to the Melbourne Exhibition,
which records the early growth of Melbourne in the 1830's through the 1870's. Of
particular interest to me was the exhibit on the Melbourne Cricket Ground
(M.C.G.) which I believe is now the second biggest cricket stadium in the
world behind Eden Gardens in Calcutta. There were paintings there of when
the M.C.G. was just a field with a few tents around the boundary.
<P>That night we went to The Jamaica House, a little restaurant in Lygon
Street, for the PreDon Dinner. Once everyone had settled in there were
over 20 attendees. It was great to put faces to the e-mail addressees I'd
been talking to for the past ten months. The guys were very welcoming, and
I felt like I'd been part of this mob for years. Dinner was great too.
<P>Saturday morning saw us all keen and eager at the Chess Club in Leister
Street. A nice spacious room with good light, and over two dozen eager
Diplomacy players...the sort of scene dreams are made of! (Well maybe...for
some of the more hopelessly addicted members of the hobby anyway!)
<P><A HREF="mailto:cain@lib.unimelb.edu.au">John Cain</A> was the GM for
the tournament. There were two rounds played on the first day (Saturday)
and a third round on Sunday. We had 27 players in the first round, playing
on four boards (2 GM positions) and 21 players for the second and third
rounds, making up three boards. There was a 'novice' board for the first
round, for players who had never played in a tournament before. There were
eight novices present, and unfortunately for me I was adjudged to be the 'least
novice' of the novices, and so missed out on the 'easy' board. Take it
from me I was arguing strenuously that I had no idea how to play the game,
and that since I didn't know anyone there from a bar of soap I was already
at a disadvantage...It didn't wash, and I was freed into the shark pool.
Bugger! And what a shark pool it was...
<H4>
Round 1</H4>
John read out the names for the first board after the novice board... Harry
Kolotas, Rob Stephenson (a sharp in take of breath from around the room),
Andrew England ("Ooooooo!"), Dugal Ure ("Gee! Whata board!"), David Ellory
("Oh Man!"), Brandon Clarke ("Ha! You poor Bastard!"), and Ross will play
the GM's position. I looked nervously around the room. I'd heard of Harry
Kolotas...he's known as "Uncle Harry" in the Australian Hobby. He's been around
the hobby since the Ark, and he's got a new wing in his house that houses
all his trophies. Rob Stephenson is renowned for for his menacing looks
and style of negotiation -- Harry will tell you how Rob scared him into
an alliance through sheer terror (or so Harry says, but he is a Diplomacy
player)....I stayed at his house that night, and I've seen his trophy cabinet,
but when we sat to play, I hadn't yet seen it. Andrew England hasn't been seen
on the Dip
circuit for a few years, but was recently referred to on OZDIP-L as "The
Great Satan"...he too is a feared and revered exponent of the game. Dugal,
and David are also of a calibre that no one seemed to think they were out
of their depth on this board. And then there was errr, me!!! Whoopie! At
least I'd get a long lunch break, huh?
<P>I drew Russia, "The Great Satan" was England, Uncle Harry was Germany,
and Rob Stephenson France. Dugal was Italy, David was the Sultan, and the GM
was playing Italy. Immediately, Uncle Harry pulls me aside and begins
his sermon:  "There's a Western Triple; Rob Stephenson's idea you see.
Andrew England has agreed to it, so I <i>have</i> to go along with it, don't I?
If you dick us around, you're the first piece of toast we're gonna eat."
<P>"Gee!" I think...maybe he thinks I'm new around here? I'm thinking "Screw
you!" so of course I say, "You won't get any stress from me...I'm too worried
about the Balkans! You and Andrew can have Scandinavia...I can't afford
to worry about going there." ...Like you do right?
<P>Next I gotta talk to this Rob Stephenson character..."What do you think?"
He asks. Much more my style of play! I tell him I think Russia and France
have heaps to talk about, and that generally the R/F alliance is underplayed.
I told him what Harry had said, and that I suspected E/G were pretty tight,
and that he should be cautious. I won an instant friend.
<P>Perhaps encouraged by my "I'm not gonna worry about Scandinavia" song,
England opened to the Channel, and Germany was going hard at France too.
I opened: <tt>F&nbsp;STP-FIN</tt>, <tt>A&nbsp;MOS-STP</tt>, and
<tt>A&nbsp;WAR-SIL</tt>. Things in the south
were going just swimmingly too, with the Turk making a bee-line for the
Aegean with his fleet, and the Austrian off to Greece in a big way. I had
Rumania in the bag, and no stress down there either. Rob looked at me as
the orders were read and mouthed, 'Thank you.' With an English fleet in the
Channel, and a German army in Burgundy, he was a little uncomfortable.
<P>The Grandfather and The Great Satan pulled me aside and said: "Look,
this is how it's going to be. We're busy attacking France, so we don't
need any hassles from you, okay? You can have Sweden as long as you don't
bounce England out of Norway. Okay?" Poker-faced, I said, "Yeah sure. I
faithfully
promise not to bounce England out of Norway." ...Yeah right!
<P>The fall moves are read, and Rob manages to defend the French homeland.
My unit in Silesia probably helps. I take Sweden, and bounce England out
of Norway. France breathes again. Immediately, I tell France that he owes
me big as I have just made major enemies out of Germany and England. He
says he's well aware of that, and if I call the tune, he'll dance to it.
<P>Germany and England understandably turned on me, but with some aggressive
counterattacking from France, Germany was soon eliminated, and England
saw the wisdom of combining in a E/F/R to stop Turkey and Austria, who were
growing quickly. The game ended in a 6-6-7-7-8 draw, with which I was more than
happy, given the opposition. That night, Sultan David and I discussed
the game over a few beers (more about that later...) and we agreed that he
and I
should definitely not have agreed to the draw, but rather should have turned
against Austria
together and pushed for a four-way draw or better. Still, I was happy to
come away from a board of death with a respectable result, and the respect
of some of the more prominent members of the Australian hobby.
<H4>
Round 2</H4>
That afternoon Saw the turning point of the tournament. Craig Sedgwick
was playing Germany, and Dugal Ure (Austria from my first round game) was
England. Between them, they swept the board. In the midgame, the centre collapsed
under sustained German pressure, and Dugal was unable to respond quickly
enough to prevent Craig from getting the solo. This made Craig's chances
of winning the tournament extremely good, given the tournament scoring
system, KISS (Keep It Simple Stupid):

<p>In my second round game I was Germany. Ken Sproat was England. Another
newbie, Leigh Gold, was Russia. Phil Orme (known as 'The Good Orme'...his
brother, Richard, being known as 'The Dark Orme') was France. Harry
Kolotas was Austria, and Bill Brown -- the leader in The Bismark
Cup<super>*</super> points
before this, the final tournament of the year -- was Italy. Ian Van Der Werff,
with whom I'd played in PBEM, was the Turk.
<p><i>[*The Bismark Cup is an annual award for the best 'Tournament Diplomacy
Player' in the Australian Hobby. Points are scored based on one's overall
finishing position in each tournament throughout the year. The more players
that attend each tournament affect the weightings given to the tournament,
and thus how many Bismark Cup points are scored from it. A list of the
tournaments, including their dates, locations and full details, that qualify
for Bismark Cup points is available at the
<A HREF="http://thingy.apana.org.au/~ozdip">Diplomacy Association of
Australia</A> home page.]</I>
<P>I talked to Ken straightaway and asked him if he'd read Stephen Agar's
article about <A HREF="http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/strategy/snail.htm">prising
the French snail out of it's shell</A>. He hadn't, so I briefly explained
it to him. Ken was keen, so off we went. However, when I got into Burgundy
in Spring of 1901, we got greedy, Instead of me supporting him into Belgium
as planned,
I went for Paris and got it, while Ken was bounced out of Belgium. This
was a grave mistake, as it galvanised Austria, Russia, and Italy against
us. Phil was playing France, and was hurting under our attack. However,
when the pressure mounted in the North-East, England and I patched things
up with him and fought together against A/I which had taken out the Turk.
Russia withered too, and then 'The "Good" Orme' Made a beserker move, stabbing
me hard and completely shattering our line of defense against the growing
Austrian. I then stepped out of the Austrian's way, welcoming him into Germany
in order to ensure the rapid demise of France. I ended on one centre, but
had seen France dragged down from 9 to 2. I was somewhat appeased. Again
the game was an agreed draw, with Harry Kolotas' Austria on 15 SC's. Bill
Brown put in another solid performance to finish on eight as Italy and so almost
guarantee himself the Bismark Cup. Ken Sproat was the other survivor as England
on eight SC's.
<H4>
Saturday Night's Festivities...</H4>
That night, we all trundled around to a nearby pub, while we waited for
Craig to grind out his eighteen centre victory. I went to the bar and said, "I'll
have a beer thanks". Where I come from 'a beer' means a pint glass. Small
children, women, and small, furry, domesticated animals drink out of small
glasses. Men drink pints. The barman pours me a beer in what looked like
a thimble to me, but as I was later to learn is the standard sized drinking
vessel in Australian pubs. I just looked at him. He looked at me.
"Better give me three more of those, mate, I said."
He looked at me again. "Buying a round, are you?" he asked.
"No, I just don't like walking."
He looks at me again, blankly, shakes his head, shrugs, and pours the
beers. When I get to the table the boys say "Oh good, you've bought
a round!" I just roll my eyes and turn back to the bar...
"Can I have a dozen of those beers mate?"
"A dozen!"
"Yes, 12."
He looks at me again. I look at him, and he gives in and starts pouring...
<P>Everyone enjoyed the pub. At about nine o'clock, the news came through that Craig
had scored a solo. Many utterances similar to "Jarstad!" were heard, as
we moved down Brunswick Street to the venue we had selected for dinner,
a lovely little wood-fired pizza cafe. Everybody settled in, and the party
got going. Craig was buying all the people who had lost to him Bourbon and
cokes. They were gratefully accepting them, and muttering congratulations,
interspersed with "Jarstard's." After two hours, I felt it was time to
sing the song I had prepared for The Don. Taking my seat next to the founder
of Donism, and alleged bare-bellied table top- singer, Ken Sproat, I prepared
to sing. Those Terry Pratchett fans amongst you may well be familiar with
The Hedgehog Song. For those of you who haven't got a clue who Terry Pratchett
is -- God have pity on your souls -- it begins like this:
<CENTER><I>You can bugger the bear if you do it with care<br>
In the winter while he is asleep in his lair,<br>
Though I would not advise it in summer or fall,<br>
But the hedgehog can never be buggered at all.</i></center>
<P>...and it continues in the same vein for a full seventeen verses. I was
fitting in
to this 'Don' scene quite nicely apparently. The Donists loved the song.
The other patrons of the cafe were, shall we just say...bemused?
<P>As the party began breaking up around midnight a few of us decided it
was time to adjourn to Rob Stephenson's house in East Doncaster. East Doncaster
is a suburb of Melbourne, I'm told. Kinda like Birmingham is a suburb of
London! What seemed like an eternity later we arrived at Rob's, and had
few VB Bitters -- the beer of choice in that part of the world. Not much
'attitude adjustment' was needed by that time of the night, and very soon
a learned discussion about the pro's and cons of the 'novice board' concept
was entered into. Rohan Keane, defending Don champion, and graduate of
the 'Screw them ruthlessly, and then start the game' school of Diplomacy
was very much of the 'let the newbies sink or swim...it's survival of the
fittest!' line of thought. Others saw the desirability of making a conscious
effort to retain new blood in the hobby. The main problem, it was agreed,
was how to ascertain the level of noviceness if the 'novice board' was
to be in the first round. The consensus was that it would be a sterling
idea to retain novice boards but to hold them in the second or third round
of the tournament to allow the GM a chance to gauge the noviceness of the
new players. This discussion was raised as a certain Rob Hadliegh almost
soloed on the novice board. (Rob went on to score second overall in The
Don, and Best Russia.) It was agreed that on a novice board this was far
more likely as the novices were less likely to bury the hatchet and get
a coordinated defense sorted out before it was too late once someone inevitably
broke open the midgame. It was argued that under the KISS scoring system,
this skewed the tournament results too much. Interesting discussion.
<H4>
Round 3</H4>
The next morning we all trekked back into Melbourne for the start of the
third and final round. I drew Austria. Craig Sedgwick was Russia, and Rob
Stephenson Turkey. Frank "The Collapser" Meerbach was Italy. (I didn't
know the story of The Collapsing at that stage.) Rohan Keane was Germany,
Bill Brown France, and Ian Van Der Werff England. First up, I agreed to a
DMZ in Galicia with Craig. I figure with Craig and Rob on my borders it's
a case of "Big Risks, Big Rewards, in the twighlight zone." Then I proposed
a Key Lepanto to Frank. I erred in that I didn't tell him not to tell anyone
I had offered it to him. I just assumed he would keep that quiet. Not so.
Rob Stephenson asks me straight out when I talk to him..."Franky says you
offered him a Key Lepanto. Did you?" I'm thinking "Firetruck!" but of course
I say, "No way." Evidently I lie convincingly, as Rob believed me.
<P>Lo and behold, Franky moves to Trieste. I pull off an apparently convincing
"Prick!" during the reading of the orders. Rob is still willing to go with
me, Craig is dodgy -- he went to Galicia after all. That'll teach me! I
lie my arse off in the fall, and amazingly the Key Lepanto is still on
track. Incredibly, Frank moves <tt>A&nbsp;APU-ION-GRE</tt>! Even though he knew I
was moving <tt>A&nbsp;SER-GRE</tt> and <tt>F&nbsp;ALB&nbsp;S&nbsp;A&nbsp;SER-GRE</tt>. The best he could hope for
was a bounce, if he got Turkish support. I just didn't see that move coming
at all. I figured he'd take Serbia and Tunis, and we'd be laughing.
<P>So now I'm screwed. I guessed wrong against the Russian army in Galicia
too, so he's eating garlic sausage in Vienna! I plotted a Turkish stab
of Russia, which would've hurt Craig, but given that I'd lied so convincingly
to him earlier, Rob decided it was probably safer to dispose of me. I didn't
make it to 1904 in this game. Never mind; it gave me a chance to watch a
couple of the other games.
<P>One thing I found interesting to note was that one of the games was
being played on a board with wooden pieces, with the little national flag
stickers on them. Now I've never really thought about it, but I've always
stood the wooden army blocks on their ends, with the flag on the short
face of the block. This set had the flags on a long face, and consequently
the army blocks lay 'on their side'. I don't suppose it matters really,
but it's funny that I had never ever considered placing them on their side.
The flags seem so perfectly sized to go on the ends too.
<P>I was one of two overseas players at the tournament, along with <A HREF="mailto:fansin@sverok.se">Bjorn
von Knorring</A> who had traveled all the way from Sweden for the tournament!
Good effort that one. Bjorn was playing Italy in a Key Lepanto alliance
in the final round. Bill Brown posted his thoughts on that game (in which
he played Russia) to OZDIP-L in some of the post-tournament discussion...
<blockquote><I>I too had a previous game with Bjorn and was impressed with his
diplomacy and tactical skills and didn't think he would do anything rash;
therefore I was hoping for the possibility of a long term R/I alliance
with him. From [Tristan, who played Austria],
I was hoping to get in on an R/A/I alliance to take out the Turk and
then have the possibility of a long term A/R alliance. In the West, I am
a great believer that Russia has to "make a statement" sooner or later
in the North. I would have loved to send an army north initially, but without
a definite Turkish ally this became less of an option. I therefore "made
my statement" by building north with the single build I received
in 1901. I did this even though I saw that A/I were double-teaming Turkey
and insincere about letting Russia be part of the division of Turkey, as
there was little I could do to stop A/I and if you are losing the south
you may as well try to have an impact in the north. This worked out okay
as England was under pressure from F/G.
<P>So the Key Lepanto had great success, but I would like to see how
it fares against a solid R/T alliance, and especially against the "disguised
steamroller" in which Turkey receives two fleets and there is immediate
pressure on Austria via Gal-Rum-Bul???
<P>As the game continued, Turkey and I went down as we lent each other
moral support. I was lucky enough to retreat to Smyrna (a bad tactical
error on behalf of the Italian) and this fleet lasted out the game, causing
immense problems to A/I in their attempt to stop the F/G/R alliance. This
alliance came about for various reasons: I was useful to F/G in removing
England; when England was going down, A/I had moved so fast against R/T
that F/G had to move east to circumvent the A/I alliance; as I lost centres
to A/I, I disbanded my northern fleets, keeping my southern fleet alive
and useful; Germany helped me stabilise the rest of Russia and very early on
we had a secure line that Tristan couldn't break. Neither France or Germany
ever approached me seriously throughout the alliance to attack the other.
<P>At this stage James [the German player, playing in his first
tournament] came to me and instead of just holding a secure line he
wanted to take the attack to the Austrian, and even though this was against
my instincts (I had the most to lose if Austria broke our line) I accepted
his lead and we took immense delight in what I call "the Old Meat Grinder"
in Sil/Boh. We'd blow up an Austrian unit, he'd blow up one of Germany's,
we'd take it back and blow up one of his, etc., but eventually we got position
and took Vienna. By that stage F/G/R had talked about dividing up the board
13-13-8 and we stuck by that (even though Harry [as in 'Uncle' Harry
Kolotas] did his normal paranoid things like building a fleet in Brest
and moving into what was supposed to be a DMZ in the English Channel). James
did well to reply to this pressure by building and moving in a like manner,
and tensions
increased just like a Cold War! Thankfully (since I only wanted a eight centre
draw to win the Bismark) we tidied up the rest of Austria quickly and the
game was drawn.
<P>What if Tristan had gone after Italy and stuck with me? I would have
gone along with it for sure as at that time I had no other firm alliance.
With my position in Norway and two fleets, I am sure I could have pressured
Germany, and France would have had the choice to go Med or help attack
Germany. The possibilities (for me anyway) would have been much greater
than the actual game, where I was forced to look to Germany to survive
the A/I. Tristan tried his best to get the German to break with F/R (especially
to attack me I think), but James resisted the pressure well and I personally
only doubted him once when I made a small stab for Sweden at one stage
(which James was smart enough to cover against) but no harm was done. To
combat Tristan's diplomacy against Germany, one season I made a
point of making sure that he spent as much time as possible talking to
me (knowing that I wouldn't be swayed by his diplomacy), but the drawback
was that my allies got upset by me spending too much time talking to Tristan!
<P>Overall the game had some good tactical play but it didn't reach
a great level of diplomacy. The possibilities (Austria/Russia vs. Italy/Germany,
France/Russia vs. Germany, Germany/Russia vs. France, or France vs. Germany)
remained unexplored.</I></blockquote>
<P>So, that was the Don Challenge Cup for 1997 from my perspective. There
was a lot I didn't see.

The Rest of my Tour...The Cricket Leg</H3>
After The Don Challenge Cup, I spent a day in Melbourne just mucking around.
Then I caught a train and a bus to Adelaide to begin my trek in pursuit
of the New Zealand cricket team. Many of my readers will be Americans, so almost
by default that means you either won't have heard of cricket, or if you
have, you don't understand it. For those of you who are interested there
is an excellent [read: accurate, but also entertaining] explanation of the game
<A HREF="http://www-usa.cricket.org/link_to_database/ABOUT_CRICKET/EXPLANATION/CRICKET_EXPLAINED_AMERICAN">here</A>.
Let me explain: briefly.
<P>Cricket is not a sport, it is a religion, a way of life. It is infinitely
subtle. You've heard of Risk no doubt. I explain to people who have never
heard of Diplomacy, that Diplomacy is like Risk, only for grown-ups. Cricket
is like Baseball, only for grown-ups.
<i><b>[Editor's note:  In passionate defense of the
Great American Pastime, let me categorically state that baseball is to
Americans as the church is to the Pope.  And for good reason. --MH]</b></i>
<P>I got to Adelaide, and stayed in a backpackers lodge in the central city.
Eleven dollars a night, including breakfast, and free apple pie and ice cream each
night, and their restaurant/pub next door served dinners of the lasagna
and salad variety for $3.50. Not too shabby at all! On the Friday night
I was in the bar at the backpackers and this English guy wandered in. He
looked a bit lost, so I bought him a beer. Turns out that his name was
Tim, and he was from Millwall in London, and yes, he had a skinhead haircut
too! Cool guy though. We got talking and I learnt he'd never heard of Cricket!
A pome, and he'd never heard of cricket!!! (Apparently all they know about
in Millwall is 'Fotbowl.') I told him that in that case he'd just have to
come to the game the next day with me between New Zealand and South Africa.
<P>I must say I was a tad bemused when I got up to my room that evening.
There was a Buddhist style shrine there, with a small robed man chanting
in front of it, clutching a copy of The Dhali Lama's Autobiography. Well!
That was a contrast to the raucous scenes in the bar that I had just left!
I feel asleep, and when I woke up the shrine, the book, and the little robed
man were gone....perhaps I dreamt it?
<H4>
N.Z. vs. South Africa, Adelaide Oval, Saturday December 6.</H4>
The next day we set off on foot for the Adelaide Oval, in completely the
wrong direction, I must add. We ended up 5 kilometers south of the city centre
near a race course. It turns out the Adelaide oval is north of the city.
Dumb tourists I guess...A cab ride later and we arrived at the game. This
was the first One-day International to be played at the Adelaide Oval under
the new floodlights...a historic occasion at a wonderful historic ground.
Yesterday, I saw some video footage of the Adelaide Oval from 1933 -- the
ground looks exactly the same today as it did then. Same old grandstands,
same wonderful old scoreboard surrounded by large old trees. It is a special
place to watch cricket. New Zealand batted first, and did quite well, scoring
225 runs. Not a formidable score by any stretch of the imagination, but
quite defendable. Then began the first period of play of the summer in
which New Zealand excelled and actually got on top of the opposition! Hallejah!
The drought is broken! We bowled South Africa out for 174, a comfortable
win. Tim the Englishman had a ball! There were some very vocal South African
supporters who didn't shut up all afternoon. They were waving their flags,
singing songs, chanting -- the whole works...really getting behind their
team. However once New Zealand started getting the South African batsmen
out at regular intervals, they suddenly became quite subdued. I had a large
Steinlager Flag with me (Steinlager being a prominent New Zealand brand
of beer). Tim grabbed my flag and stood up on his seat and bellowed in
the direction of the once vociferous South Africans:
<P>
<CENTER><I>It's all gone quiet,
<br>It's all gone quiet,
<br>IT'S ALL GONE QUIET OVER THERE!!!</i></CENTER>
<P>This was met with rapturous applause from the bunch of Kiwis we were
sitting with, and dark baleful stares from the targeted South African fans.
Tim was an instant hit...an honourary Kiwi. After the game several of the
New Zealanders and our honourary friend set off to find
a pub, to watch the rugby test between New Zealand and England. New Zealand
are generally seen to be the best rugby side in the world at the moment.
They were expected to beat the English easily, and Tim was a tad reticent
about going to watch the game with a bunch of rabid Kiwis. Nevertheless,
he intrepidly came along. At half time England were leading 23-9. There
were approximately twenty Kiwi's there absolutley aghast. This was unthinkable!
Tim was sitting there like the cat who'd swallowed the canary. He was beaming!!
Thankfully from our point of view the mighty All Blacks (the name of our
national rugby team) came back strong in the second half and the game was
drawn 26-26. It was one of the most intense, emotionally draining matches
I've ever seen. A draw to England was a disasterous result for New Zealand,
<b>but thank God we didn't lose!</b>
<H4>
N.Z. vs. Australia, Adelaide Oval, Sunday December 7</H4>
What a game of cricket! The Adelaide Oval was jam-packed! You couldn't
have got more people in there safely. Sitting on the embankment in front
of the scoreboard I witnessed a special day's cricket. New Zealand got
off to a flying start, slamming the Australian bowling attack to all parts
of the ground. Glen McGrath, Australia's opening bowler, and arguably the
best fast bowler in the world, certainly one of the best 5, had just bowled
four overs for 32 runs (expensive bowling). He came down to field just in
from the fence about ten metres in front of where I was sitting. Buoyed
by the success of the New Zealand batters, and sick of taking it in the
neck from the extremely partisan Australian crowd, I decided it was time
to dish some back. Standing proud in my All Black's jersey, waving my Steinlager
flag prominently above my head, surrounded by one-eyed Australian fans,
I began to sing...
<center>(To the tune of Ruby Tuesday...)
<BR><I>Cheer up Glen McGrath,
<br>It's not as bad as it seems...
<br>You're just a sh*t Aussie bowler,
<br>In a sh*t Aussie team!!!</i>
</center>
<P>About then, plastic beer cups, many still partially full, began inexplicably
raining down on me. The half dozen kiwis I was with loved it, but our cousins
from the 'West Island' were not amused.
<P>New Zealand went on to score 260 runs, and the scene was set as the
sun set and the lights took over for a fantastic finale. And we were not
disappointed! Mark Waugh, Australia's opening batsman, scored a beautiful
innings of 104 (A very very good score for a batsman in one day cricket.)
Just before he got out, Australia were coasting to victory. Then, in a
way peculiar to the great game of cricket, the game swung dramatically,
as New Zealand dismissed seven Australian batsmen for just 48 further runs.
After a period where we had been very quiet, the small Kiwi contingent
found their voice as the game welled up to a tumultuous climax. Into the
final over, the game could go either way. Gavin Larsen, affectionately
known to us Kiwis as 'Super-Gav', bowled the last over. And, he took a
wicket! Yes!!!!! There was still hope...
<P>In came Shane Warne, cricketing hero of a nation. The Australians think
he is the new Messiah. The Australian crowd was chanting "Warnie! Warnie!
Warnie!" Needing 2 runs to win of 5 balls, Shane Warne swung and missed.
The next ball, he swung and missed again, and was bowled! He was out without
scoring a run, and 'Super-Gav' had done it again! A deathly hush descended
upon the Adelaide oval as 29,976 Australians stared on in disbelief, and
two dozen Kiwis yelled their little hearts out and danced the fandango in
one little secluded part of the ground. The euphoria at that moment was
incredible. Mr. Miracle had been dispatched without scoring... Then in stepped
Andrew Bichel, edged a ball past our wicket keeper down to the boundary
for four runs, and the game was over in a flash. 29,976 Australians erupted
in unison, and 24 kiwi's stood with hands held to heads thinking about
what might have been!
<P>Easily the best game of cricket I have ever attended.
<H4>
Off to Tasmania, the Island State</H4>
From Adelaide I flew to Hobart, capital city of Tasmania. What a stunningly
beautiful place! I found a nice little Bed and Breakfast right on the
waterfront in Bellerive, looking across the Derwent river at Hobart itself
with Mt. Wellington forming a spectacular backdrop. After spending a day
looking around Hobart, I dropped into the Bellerive yacht club to see if
there was any Wednesday evening racing. (After Diplomacy and cricket,
yachting is my other passion). There was, so I found a boat that needed
some crew, and went yacht racing. A great way to spend the early evening,
before retiring to the yacht club for a BBQ and a few obligatory beers.
Then two of the guys with whom I had sailed drove me up to the summit of Mt.
Wellington. It's just over 4200 feet evidently, and since there wasn't
a cloud in the sky that night we had a panoramic view of Hobart and the
surrounding districts. The Southern Lights (Aurora Borealis) were visible
too which was a bonus, as I'd never seen them before.
<P>Next morning I got up and ate breakfast on the verandah overlooking
the Derwent and Hobart. There wasn't a cloud in the sky and the forecast
was for 26 degrees Celsius (approximately 78 degrees in Yankeespeak). A short
five minute
walk around the shoreline had me at the Bellerive Oval where New Zealand
were due to play South Africa. This was another wonderful game of cricket
that went right down to the very last ball. South Africa scraped home to
win by one run. I have to say that of all the cricket grounds I've been
to, the Bellerive Oval is one of the prettiest, and it certainly wins the
best catering award. The range of food available in the ground was astounding.
<H4>
The BIG ONE! N.Z. vs. Australia at the M.C.G., Wednesday December 17</H4>
Ever since I was about ten years old, I've watched games of cricket on TV
live from the Melbourne Cricket ground, and I've always said, "one day,
I'm going to be there." I've dreamt of seeing N.Z. play Australia at the
M.C.G. in a day/night match before a full house. The M.C.G. holds almost
100,000 people when full. The only cricket ground in the world with a bigger
capacity is Eden Gardens in Calcutta. The M.C.G. is the high altar of cricket,
though. Only Lords in London, the home of the Marylebone Cricket Club,
oldest cricket club in the world, can rival it. However, as a stadium the
M.C.G. is unrivaled.
<P>This was the big day. I did a tour of the M.C.G. the previous Sunday,
and visited the Long Room in the members stand, walked on the field,
and sat in the dressing rooms. I met several friends outside the ground,
and went in full of expectation. Unfortunately the New Zealand batting
display was abysmal...no, that is too kind. We were never in the game.
I did however enjoy the experience of the the crowd in the cauldron of
the M.C.G. -- even if it was only a small 30,000.
<a name=divvy>
<P>Whenever a member of the crowd got ejected by the security forces the
whole bay around them would stand up and chant "You're going home in the
back of a divvy van!" several times over, interspersed with rhythmical
clapping. (A 'Divvy Van' is Aussie slang for a police holding wagon.)
<P>I did have one crowning moment of glory though. Shane Warne, cricketing
hero of a nation, and Australia's new Messiah, came on to bowl. The day
before he had stormed out of a press conference when a reporter asked him
about his weight (he's put on a few pounds lately...). As he stood there
waiting for the fielders to get into position, I stood up and took up the
following cry:
<P>
<CENTER><I>Who ate all the pies?
<br>Who ate all the pies?
<br>You fat bastard,
<br>You fat bastard,
<br>You ate all the pies.
<P>...And the sausage rolls,
<br>And the sausage rolls,
<br>You fat bastard,
<br>You fat bastard,
<br>You ate all the rolls!
<P>...And the jelly donuts,
<br>And the jelly donuts,
<br>You fat bastard,
<br>You fat bastard,
<br>You ate all the do-nuts!!!!!
</i></center>
<P>This was met by a warm round of applause by the crowd in my part of
the ground. Shane Warne, who had heard me, didn't think it was so funny...he
gave me the hairy eyeball!
<P>Australia won the game easily, which was an unfortunate end to an otherwise
perfect three weeks watching the cricket.
