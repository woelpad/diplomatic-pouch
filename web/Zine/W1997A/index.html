<i>David Norman:</i>
<A HREF="Norman/judgelist.html">Judge Variant List</a></b><dd>
Ever wonder how many variants the computer judges support?  Ever wonder just
how busy the variant creators, implementors, and testers who push the hobby
forward are? Ever wonder if a certain idea you've had for a variant is already
on the judges?  Well, wonder no more, as David gives us an exhaustive,
up-to-the-moment list of variants in each stage of support on the judges.

<a href="../../DP-cgi/DipSticks">DipSticks</a></b><dd>
Speaking of pencil puzzles, Simon checks in with the solution to last issue's
word search, and a brand new effort, this one an acrostic puzzle!  And that's
not all.  Manus misunderstood what Simon was putting
together, but it gave him a bright idea, so he whipped up a little pencil
puzzle of his own for you.  Well,
guess what?  Manus's idea was the same as Simon's! (Great minds think alike?)
The upshot of it is that you get to scratch your head over
<i>two</i> supply center acrostic!

<i>Graeme Ackland:</i>
<A HREF="Holmes/refugee.html">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Diplomat</a></b><dd>
After settling the last affair, Holmes and Watson had barely time to indulge
themselves in those snifters of brandy that seem ever-present at Baker Street
before another problem involving the nefarious Sultan -- this one "The Case of
the Suwati Refugee" -- was presented to the pair.

<i>Tony Swinnerton:</i>
<A HREF="Swinnerton/Key.html">Playing the Key</a></b><dd>
The Key opening -- giving Serbia to Italy in 1901 with Austrian
approval -- is among the more risky but rewarding options.  Should you try,
in your next game, to surprise the board and get that pivotal extra army
into the Turkish theatre?  Read Tony's advice before you decide against it!
