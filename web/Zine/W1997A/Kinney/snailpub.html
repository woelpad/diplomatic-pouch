<H1 align=center>The Smell of the Copy Toner</H1>
<H2 align=center>Publishing Your Own Snail-Mail Zine</H2>
<H3 align=center><i>Mark Kinney</i></H3>

There is great fun to be found in the PBM Diplomacy hobby; mostly you hear
about PBM play in various zines, but there is also a lot of enjoyment to
be found in publishing your own zine and running your own games.  This is
intended as a list of tips for those considering publishing their own  
snail-mail Dip zine, based on my own experience with my late, lamented 
zine, "League of Nations," and in a way I hope to encourage non-postal
Dippers to take a look at the PBM hobby.
<p>
First, there is one important thing to note about publishing a zine: this
will not be any kind of money-making project, but more a labor of love.  
Depending on how big your zine is, you may be able to break even
monetarily with a modest subscription fee, but there is still time taken
putting the zine together and adjudicating games.  If you put any kind of
non-game content into the zine, you'll likely puff your page count into
something costly.  If this non-game content consists of subzines
(additional sections submitted by other people), you'll save the time of
putting things together but will still pay the copy costs.  If you start
off with a subzine, as many publishers recommend, you'll have the time
factor, but usually not the money cost, or the control of publishing yourself.
<p>
If you still have the urge to publish your own zine (not that I'm trying
to discourage you; the PBM hobby needs some new faces, you know, and it can
be quite fun), the best way to approach the beginning is to have a game
ready to go with the first issue if at all possible.  I had received several 
sample zines when the announcement of my starting a zine appeared in the
last issue of John Armstrong's "Swiss Observer," so I put together a first
issue and sent it on out, expecting I'd fill at least my standard
Diplomacy opening quickly.  This didn't happen, and I started rapidly
wearing out the reserve of non-game content I had put away in the seven
months it took to get a game started.
<p>
Even more important than the game itself, though, are the house rules that
games will run under.  These usually detail how certain mutable aspects of
the game (like retreats, bounces, turn format, and so forth) will be
handled, as well as definitions important to your zine and other rules you
use.  As important as these are, it is easy to overlook them when you
begin (as I very nearly did in writing this article!), especially if  
whatever zines you look at as examples don't publish their house rules in
every issue (most don't).
<p>
Whenever you do publish your first issue, though, you should obtain a copy
of either "Pontevedria" (or "Running Across Mercury" for the European
hobby) or the "Zine Register" or equivalent, and send samples to other
publishers.  Not only will a lot of them mention your zine in their own,
bringing you subscribers, but you may have the opportunity to trade zines
with them, basically giving each other a free subscription until one stops
publishing.  The above-mentioned zines will also list your zine, and in
the former's case, will list game openings available in your zine.
<p>
Looking at other zines before you start can be of benefit as well, since
you can look at how various publishers handle aesthetic concerns of their
zines, and that can influence how you set up your own.  I had only seen
two zines when I published my first issue, and also worked within the
restrictions of a word processor I didn't know well at the time, so my
early issues look far cruder than the later ones (as will tend to happen,
but I had a somewhat greater learning curve).
<p>
While there are zines that run games, and only run games (these are
commonly called
"warehouses"), it is the non-game content you may run that really defines
your zine.  "The Swiss Observer" specialized in "news stories" about the
games in progress, something that I adopted for my own zine, at least
until the time crunch that eventually led to my fold forced me to minimize my 
non-game content.  Other zines have extensive sections on music, movies
and television, and literary reviews, as well as standard letter columns,
where all manner of things are discussed.
<p>
The slower pace of postal play means that your turnover will be far longer
than of electronic play, with the least time between issues of a PBM zine
I've seen being three weeks.  The most common publication rate is monthly,
although many new zines are running at a six-week rate.  It's just this
slower rate, however, that allows for a fuller presentation of games than
the Judges give, and that is something many postal players (and
spectators) find quite enjoyable.
<p>
One final thing that should be covered is your inevitable fold.  Whether
it's due to money problems, a time crunch, or just plain burnout, you will 
eventually quit publishing.  If you still have games going, it is best if
you can smoothly transfer these to another GM with a minimum of delay, and
all subscribers should know about the fold as soon as possible (although
sometimes in the case of burnout, this is difficult, and I'm somewhat
guilty of this one myself).  This leaves the issue of remaining
subscription fees, which sometimes is mentioned in the subscription
information, but often is not.  Publishers even differ somewhat on this
aspect, but many accept the keeping of remaining monies, since publishing
the zine is a money-losing proposition to begin with.  In some cases,
refunds will be offered, but this is the exception rather than the rule,
and depends on the individual publisher.
<p>
And so we complete the life cycle of a PBM zine.  I hope this is helpful,
and influences people to get their feet wet, either playing in or
publishing their own postal zine.
