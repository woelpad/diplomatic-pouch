<H2 align=center>England's End Of Game Statement from "troi"</H2>
<hr><p>
Did I <b>really</b> lose to Dan again?<br>
<i>sigh</i><BR>
And a <i>grin</i>.
<P>
<i>[...pause to pull up a game list...]</i>
<P>
I really did lose to Dan again. And Josh caused it! Grumble, grumble,
grumble.
<P>
This was a fairly straight forward game for me and, surprisingly, I
didn't
stab anyone until the very end of the game. Josh should check his
records,
for he stabbed me and not the other way around.
<P>
It's Spring '01 and we're heading east. The Channel stays empty and I
take Nth uncontested, though the Lowlands are already trying to get
Norway into the North Sea. Pity for Norway that he headed the other
direction. I normally open to the Channel in a no-press game,
but with the Crowded variant, France has to deal with Spain and
England has to deal with a lot more fleets already on the North
Sea so that made the opening decision easy. I just continue westward
in the fall to secure my position for the spring of '02. Happily,
Russia has taken a center from Norway and Norway disbands ... Norway.
<P>
Spring '02 we waltz into Norway. Russia, for some reason, has decided
to
continue beating on Norway rather than trying to deny the center to
us.
His loss, my gain. France and Spain are still squabbling, but Lowlands
is going to help bring down France fairly soon. Massive hug-fest
around
the North Sea in the Fall of '02 as we've all gained a center and
have units to spare for hugging each other.
<P>
Spring '03. No indications that I should change course. Russia attacks
Norway with one, no support, allowing me into Ska and allowing me to
keep
Norway. He regrets this in the fall when I take Sweden from him.
France,
Spain, and Lowlands are still busy with each other, and I am getting
complacent.
<P>
Spring '04. Okay, time to open up the fronts. We can blow Norway out of
Denmark
since he has no support, run an army into Norway to protect against
Russia,
*and* go to the Channel. The latter was probably not a good idea. We
were doing well keeping to the west and I shouldn't have annoyed
Spain.
Then again, Spain probably would hae walked into IRI/NAO anyhow, so
it may not have been a mistake but a good defensive maneuver. In the
Fall
we shuffle fleets, covering IRI and ENG and continue to hug Lowlands.
Russia tries to go home to StP and is denied. Heh heh.
<P>
Spring '05. Okay, we now hug Spain, while Spain hugs himself. Take the
North Sea again with no problems, move to the Baltic, etc., etc., etc.
I should have seen Lowlands moving on me at this point, but ... Come
on David, what else is he going to do with two fleets? Stab City, come
fall. I must correct an earlier statement, I <b>did</b> stab Lowlands
at this point, while he stabbed me. Mutual stab. Unfortunately, his
worked and mine didn't. He's in the North Sea now, and it's going to
take me a long time to unravel this.
<P>
Spring '06. I try to cover London, but Lowlands is moving on Denmark
and Spain takes the opportunity to force his way into the Channel. I
continue this folly, and Spain and Lowlands continue to do the right
things, and Spain now has fleets in IRI and the Channel. I get Denmark
back, which is about the only thing I did right at that point.
<P>
I'm actually being too hard on myself. I think I did the right thing
all along and played the conservative route. Spain and Lowlands
assumed
I would, and took appropriate steps. If I'd gone the radical route,
London would have been lost and I'd be gone. I needed every unit I
had.
<P>
Spring '07. Spain goes home, Lowlands moves to stop Turkey while
signalling Spain to move on me. <i>sigh</i> Spain does, but to NAO and not
NTH. Time to chase fleets again.
<P>
Spring '08. I lose Lvp! What the heck was I thinking?? I must have
been out to lunch. I could easily have stopped it. I compound this
error by forcing MAO to retreat, and it goes to NAO. A rather bizzare
convoy puts me in Picardy on my way to Paris, unstoppable by
Spain. Another move that kept me hanging on.I'm hoping that Lowlands
will back off at this point, but ...
<P>
Spring '09. Spain blows me out of MAO after building in Por, Lowlands
blows me out of Nth, which I could at least see was coming and we're
all shuffling fleets around.
<P>
Spring '10. Turkey is moving on Norway and Lowlands <i>finally</i> wakes
up.
The North is stabilizing! My conquest of Paris and Turkish action
in the soth force Spain to disband Lvp and I can even get my
home center back this year.
<P>
The next few years were pretty dull. Formalize, as much as one can,
the alliance with Spain and Lowlands, move on StP and <i>pray</i> that
Spain will get his act together. Lowlands and I can do well up north,
so that shouldn't be a problem. I run a few fleets over to see if I
can help Spain out, which a) wasn't necessary and b) invited Lowlands
to attack me. I compound <i>this</i> error by waiving a build.
<P>
Again, it probably wasn't an error. I couldn't see <i>any</i> way that
Lowlands could stab me without costing us the game. In turn, I wanted
to make damn sure that Spain and Lowlands both knew I wan't going to
do anything to them.
<P>
Thigns are really stagnant, Turkey is trying to get me to stab Spain,
draw proposals aren't going through, Lowlands is making progress on
Turkey and Turkey is withdrawing. Looks like signals for a three way
draw. I stupidly, again, vacate StP so I can convoy an army
in there. Yet another invitation to Lowlands to stab me.
<P>
He stabs me, I stab Spain for one, rather than two, and lose three
centers to Lowlands. I went for Mar rather thanSpa because I wasn't
looking at the actual orders. Turkey was supporting Lowlands into Mar,
not me. Duh.
<P>
It's all over at this point. I'm going to do my best to stop Lowlands
from
gaining anything more. I watch in dismay as Turkey starts racking up
the centers again. With Spain stabbed and coming after me, he
can't hold the line in the Med any more. *ding* End of Game.
<P>
My <b>major</b> mistake was opening myself up to Lowlands. Without that
error,
I could have stabbed Spain for one, rather than two, and probably
still
have made it. Yes, Josh was ... in error ... stabbing me at the end,
but
I made it easy for him. A bit more defense on my part, the temptation
would not have been there, and it would have been a draw.
<P>
Ah well.
<P>
It was a very enjoyable game, though frustrating at times. Sitting in
the backfield wanting to do something but unable really hurt.
<P>
Question: I tried to get a RTAE draw proposed late in the game.
Michael
and I talked about it and he said that his policy was not to announce
draws, which I can live with. Would anyone have voted it for it,
though?
I'd guess that Dan would not have, and Josh might not have.
