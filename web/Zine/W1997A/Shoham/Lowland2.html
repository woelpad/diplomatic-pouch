<H2 align=center>Balkans's Response to the English EOG</H2>
<hr><p>
This is mostly a reply to David.
<P>
I guess that most of the reason I saw England as an enemy was the fact
that
I supported Norway against him early. I never stopped trying to help Norway
make
a stand against England, until Noray started trying to take Kiel. Even though
England
wasn't really out to get me, they were the only one of my neighbors
who I
hadn't been relatively friendly to so far.
<P>
I'd almost forgotten the convoy to Picardy. That was a horrible
mistake on
my part; as I wrote to Jen in my commentary at the time:
<blockquote><i>
Believe it or not, I actually saw the potential for the convoy to
Picardy,
but I didn't see the threat it posed to Paris (just to Belgium), or
I
might have tried to stop it. Now I've lost Paris, and England will
only
drop one unit this year.
</i></blockquote>
I was prepared to play games with Belgium, but letting the English
army roam
around the French countryside was a horrible mistake. I haven't
thought
about it in a while, but at the time, I saw that as another crucial
turning
point, where England when from being on-the-run and almost-dead to
looking
like he was going to survive thanks to our inability to chase down
that last
unit while keeping up the front.
