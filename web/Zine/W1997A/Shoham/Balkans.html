<H2 align=center>Balkans End Of Game Statement from "troi"</H2>
<hr><p>
First and foremost, I did not know Turkey although
it looked otherwise!!  I know I have many crimes to
answer for regarding Turkey in Troi and I hope the
explanantion below will make some things clear.
<P>
This was my first crowded variant.  I chose Balkans before
I realized that they had two fleets which could not help
each other out at all.  Although Balkans start with 4 SC
they are very weak.
<P>
The first year I decided on a grand strategy of aiding Russia
into the Black with the intent of sweeping Turkey off his
corner of the map with Russian aid.  Also, I tried giving
Austria some frivolous support in trying to signal to him
that I had other fish to fry.  But I noticed that Turkey tried
to support me into the Black and he moved to Armenia.  I liked
his determination and switched alliances in the fall.  Sorry
Russia, I would have done much better with you had I only
known......
<P>
I lost Serbia to Austria and knew  I was going to be crushed
between AT if Turkey did not accept my overtures.  But he
did and again moved on Russia and was able to gain Sevastopol
with my help.  Now, I wanted to move out to sea in the south
with Turkish help but the Turk turned on me and attacked Rumania!
After all I had done to help him out he stabbed me!!  But nobody
was nearby to punish the Turk so I kept on, hoping he would
give me a break for being such a loyal ally.  Such was never to be
the case.
<P>
Down to two SCs I saw that Turkey could take Bulgaria with ease
if he wanted to so I did not even bother to defend it hoping
he would go along with my signals for Med expansions.  Again,
I overestimated the Turkish penchant for betrayal and he attacked
Bulgaria.  When was this going to end??
<P>
So, down to one SC in Greece I was faced  with more problems.  I
could defiantly hold in Greece or stay in the game as long as
possible.  I made my decision and removed my greek army in
favor of keeping the Ionian fleet.
<P>
At this point, I was just looking for survival and decided to
play toady to Turkey.  After all, I wasn't going to win but I sure
could decide who was going to win.  I take all blame for creating
Turkey.  I played Kingmaker instead of Diplomacy in an attempt to
to give my one center power some meaning.
<P>
I sent my last fleet into Naples and then Rome.  Imagine Turkey's
surprise when I again supported him into Naples!  I can
imagine his confusion as one of his victims continued to aid him.
Well, I receieved some support from another almost gone player
and was able to survive long enough to see Turkey get Naples.
I forget who finally destroyed me but it was probably Turkey.
<P>
I was continually surprised at the blood-thirstiness of the
Turks.  I had done so many favors to him throughout the game
and I kept expecting some crumb from his table but none was
forthcoming.  He was ruthless in his ambition and deserved the
win.  I followed the game until the very end and found myself
cheering for the man who I made emperor, Turkey!!
<P>
Many thanks to all players for an enjoyable game.  And again,
congratulations to Turkey for the relentless and indominatable
will to win at all costs!  That is what Dip is all about.
<P>
