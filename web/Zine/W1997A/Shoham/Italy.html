<H2 align=center>Italy's End Of Game Statement from "troi"</H2>
<hr><p>
Initial intentions were to move westward.  However, when it
became clear that Austria was moving on Venice, it was decided
to defend -- knowing that this would lead to a premature demise.
Austria, seeing that Italy was moving west, had begun the
irreversible diversion of forces westward -- and did soon overrun
Italy.  However, Austria then suffered the same fate -- attack from
the East.
<P>
(I admit that after being eliminated, I didn't really follow the
game very closely.)  Thanks for an interesting (albeit brief) game!
