<H2 align=center>Turkey's Response to England's EOG from "troi"</H2>
<hr><p>
England mentioned proposing an R/T/A/E draw and guessed that I would not
have voted for it.
<P>
He meant a L/E/T/S draw, I take it.
<P>
I certainly would not have voted for it. Not for a very long time, at
least.
<P>
In fact, if I was Lowland or England I wouldn't have voted for it
either.
Only as Spain, would I have.
<P>
In fact, I don't believe there is any position were I would vote
for a draw as each of the powers. (Which means that if everyone played
like me there would be no draws!). I vote for a draw only if I
evaluate
myself to be in a losing position (as I would have in Spain's
position),
but then someone else (IMHO) <b>shouldn't</b> be letting me in the draw.

<P>
In an effort to pre-empt any call for an imposed draw (was anyone
planning
on such?), I gave Mike a very sizeable dissertation on my objections
to
such imposition. In it I included an outline of the sequence of
strategies
and techniques I intended to implement to exaustively try to exploit
every
possible fault and split in E/L/S that might exist below the surface.
(Indeed,
a fault and a split <i>did</i> exist below the surface.) I was certainly
going
to vote against any draw proposals while trying. The endgame took
about
10 years. I would have been perfectly happy to take another decade or
two
to systematically try every strategy and technique. I would even been
willing to reduce myself to the size of an "average power" (under
certain
circumstances) if that's what it would have taken to re-vitalize the
game!
<P>
