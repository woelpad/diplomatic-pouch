<H2 align=center>Lowlands Initial End Of Game Statement from "troi"</H2>
<hr><p>
Brief EOG, 'cause I have to get back to work: Big apologies to Spain
and
England for blowing this game. I drastically overestimated my ability
to
wipe out England quickly while still defending against Turkey, and
when I
didn't have time to think it through carefully, I played hastily, and
ended
up making some very stupid decisions.
<P>
Congratulations to Dan on successfully splitting the E/S/T alliance.
If I'd
been thinking clearly, I would have secured Moscow and Warsaw, let
England
eliminate Spain, and settled for a three-way draw.
<P>
More details/rationale when I have more time.
<P>
