<H2 align=center>Russia's End Of Game Statement from "troi"</H2>
<hr><p>
At the beginning I tried to expand in Scandinavia and control the
south,
waiting to see what would have happened among Austria, Balkans and
Turkey.
I do succeded in getting Sweden from Norway, and to mantain the rest
of my
Homeland.
<P>
Then two facts surprised me:
<ul>
<li>the continuously shifting support given by the Balkans to either me
or
Turkey that led to the loss of Sevastopol.
<li>being a novice, I just did not realize that Sweden and Norway are
neighbouring countries ALSO for fleets; so I let England into Norway
when I could have easily continued to buonce there, and, later I
failed to
support my fleet in Sweden with the A STP.
</ul>
So I was reduced to four SCs, while Turkey was growing in the
south,
and Sevastopol was no longer defensible, and England became stronger
in the
north.
So I tried my chances against Austria, to earn the SCs that would
have saved
me, but even if I was successful there, I could do nothing against the
combined
Turko-English attack against my homeland.
So at the end, having seen Turkey growing I decided to do my best to
slow him.
And then I started having net access problem, so I was forced to
resign.
<P>
As a first experience, I have to say that I enjoyed quite a lot this
game,
I learned a lot from the tactical point of view, with some (costly)
mistakes.
Being able to concentrate only on the board, and not on the
negotiations,
I could devote my (scarce) time to understanding the likely scenarios
and to weight the decisions.
<P>
I wish that more games of the Nopress kind would be available.
<P>
