<H2 align=center>Norway's End Of Game Statement from "troi"</H2>
<hr><p>
I took over Norway in the retreat phase of it's final year.  It was
spring
and Norway need to retreat from Denmark, it's only supply center.
I retreated to the Baltic and in the fall tried a desperate try for
Kiel
which failed.  I did not expect to survive, I was merely trying to
help
the game along.  Taking over small powers is tough enough, but in
nopress
it is almost hopeless.  There is almost no way to beg for mercy or
your life.
<P>
I was glad to help out.
