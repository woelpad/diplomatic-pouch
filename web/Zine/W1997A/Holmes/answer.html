"I must admit," began Holmes, "that my near failure was due largely to
neglecting 
information from previous cases -- not the double elimination problem 
in particular, but <i>each</i> of the cases involving the Suwati monarch.
The Sultan of Suwat is a decent 
man, I knew that, and a lover of puzzles and games.  Expelling a man from 
his country for playing a good game of Diplomacy would be quite unlike
him.
I was uneasy having solved the Diplomacy problem, validating the man's
story.  It yet seemed highly unlikely that the Sultan would behave so
harshly to a
worthy opponent.  Moreover, the way that just enough information was provided 
to uniquely define the position at the end of 1902 led me to suspect there was more to this.
<p align=justify>

"Recalling the manner in which the Sultan cleverly chooses to arrange
extensions to the lease on the oil facilities in his nation, 
I guessed that this too was a test from the Sultan.  But 
what did he want?  The whole game was not quite defined.  The final 
position was a possibility, but how to send it was unclear.  It was more than
an hour after you left that I recognised the real question -- to which I had, 
of course, already found the answer."
                                               <p align=justify>
"But Holmes," I retorted, "What was the answer, the code-word that saved
Port Suwat for the Empire?"

I was no wiser.  I could see all the evidence on the two scraps of paper;
I had followed Holmes' reasoning on the Diplomacy board; I even knew the
answer.  But the question was a complete mystery.
                                      <p align=justify>
I knew it must be somehow contained in the papers, and I stared with a
skeptical mind at the stilted account of the refugee's escape from his
native land and at the provinceless orders.  I
peered and grimaced.  Then, to my great joy, I spotted the question.
                           <p align=justify>
"Ahem," began Holmes, "I suppose I had better..."
                        <p align=justify>
But in my moment of triumph, I silenced the great detective.
"Initially, Holmes, I felt uncomfortable with your abuse about the double
elimination.
To cap it all, you now seem to want to deprive me of my final joy in finding
the question."
                  <p align=justify>
 Holmes smiled.  "Congratulations, Watson; I gather that you have indeed
 found it."
                            <p align=justify>
I believe that I blushed.
