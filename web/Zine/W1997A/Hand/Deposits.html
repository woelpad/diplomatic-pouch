<H3>And Now For Something Completely Different....</H3>
Longtime readers are familiar with the way The Pouch Deposits column goes.
I spout off for awhile about a topic I'd like to see discussed, then I
complain about how the last topic I presented wasn't discussed at all,
and then it's into the mailbag.
<P>
This time around, I'm going to spare you the topic stuff and instead
present up here at the top of the column a very entertaining story
pulled from
that afore-mentioned mailbag.  Here you go.  It speaks
for itself....
<P>
<i>As a newspaper editor, I briefly considered sending this nugget off to
Readers Digest or somewhere, but it's nearly impossible to explain 
play-by-email Diplomacy,
and then tell a story that makes sense to a general audience. Anyway, I
hated to let the story go to waste. So if you can use it, be my guest.
And, yes, it really did happen. 
<P>
Here's the story for what it's worth:
<P>
During a break at a recent professional conference at a hotel complex in
Virginia, I was surprised to find a participant feverishly scribbling notes
on the edge of a Realpolitik map. Before I could introduce myself as a fellow
e-mail diplomat, he began explaining Diplomacy and the PBEM game so
enthusiastically I
didn't have the heart or the chance to stop him. He was Russia, he said, and
he was hurriedly drawing up orders to launch a major stab against his ally,
France. Noting my interest, he handed me a copy of the map detailing his
intended treachery, promised to continue my introduction to the game later,
then excused himself to find a phone. Before rushing away, however, he added
a final thought: in Diplomacy, he advised, you should never, ever trust anyone. 
<P>
At a reception a few hours later I felt a tap on my shoulder. His face was
slightly ashen, and I couldn't tell if he had been laughing or crying. He was
holding the map I had earlier arranged to have placed in his mail slot. It
was the
same map he'd given me that afternoon, only I'd taken the liberty of making one
small hand-written addition:</i>
<blockquote><pre>press to R
Good advice. Never trust anyone. I'm France. 
endpress
signoff</pre></blockquote>
<i>
It took three beers and a whiskey chaser to return him to normal. Is this a
great game or what?

<tr><th valign=top align=right>England:<td>
<ul><li>(Assumed centres:  England, Nwy, Swe, StP, Bre, Spa, Por, Tun):
        8 fleets, 2 armies.
<li>(Assumed centres:  England, Scandinavia, Holland, Kiel, StP, Mos):
         7 fleets, 3 armies.
<tr><th valign=top align=right>Germany:<td>

        2 fleets, 8 armies.
<li>(Assumed centres:  Germany, Scandinavia, Hol, Edi, War, StP):
        4 fleets, 6 armies.  The problem here is that I would  have probably 
        ended up fighting France after wiping out England, especially since
        I would have built all the fleets already.
<tr><th valign=top align=right>Russia:<td>
<ul><li>(Assumed centres [among a great number of possibilities]):  Russia,
Swe, Rum, Vie, Bud, Ber, Mun):
        3 fleets, 7 armies.  Then I would build another fleet in StP and
attack England.
<li>
        On the other hand,  if I had, say, Russia, Swe, Nwy, Rum, Bul, Con,
Ank (which I actually did once), then 4 fleets and 6 armies would be better.
<tr><th valign=top align=right>
Turkey:<td>
<ul><li>(Assumed centres:  Turkey, Bul, Gre, Ser, Tri, Tun, Ven, Nap):
        6 fleets, 4 armies -- probably.
<tr><th valign=top align=right>
Austria-Hungary:<td>
<ul><li>(Assumed centres:  Austria, Balkans, Con, War, Sev):
        8 armies, 2 fleets.  Perhaps one more fleet if Italy looks easier to
stab than Germany.
<tr><th valign=top align=right>
Italy:<td>
<ul><li>
        (I can only imagine what 10 centres Italy could have -- I've certainly
never <i>seen</i> it --
          Italy, Tun, Turkey, Iberia, Marseilles):
        3 armies, 7 fleets.   Perhaps another army or two if it looks like
time to stab Austria.
<tr><th valign=top align=right>
France:<td>
<ul><li>(Assumed centres:  France, Iberia, Belgium, Munich, Tunis, Ven, Rom):
        5 armies, 5 fleets.  Easily the most balanced case.
<li>(Assumed centres:  France, Iberia, Belgium, Tunis, Lon, Lvp, Nap?):
        7 fleets, 3 armies.  Better watch out for a German stab!

Decision squares and all that jazz...
<P>
Well, I want to speak up for decision squares.  It seems that more than one
writer (I am not naming names, no one named mine, although I am the one with
two conspicious
articles chock full of decision squares...actually, they're more accurately
labled matrices)
has taken cracks at their use in analyzing our grand game.  Shortly put, I agree with them in their
general gist -- that Diplomacy defies rational analysis as a "solvable" game. But such critics would see
this if they read my second article more carefully.  Modelling here is not meant to "rationalize" Diplomacy, only to describe scenarios
in a simpler fashion.  I for one believe that game theory can never be more than a set of tools to describe, and that is what my use of 
"decision squares" attempted, admittedly inadequately, to do.
But saying, "uh, when I get that itching feeling, it's time to stab,"
is no better.

<H3 align=center>Mail Received Concerning 
<a href="../../F1997R/Windsor/lawdip.html">Lawyer/Diplomat</a></H3>
<HR>
<H4>From Bradd Szonye (<a href=mailto:bradds@concentric.net>bradds@concentric.net</a>):</H4>
"Lawyer/Diplomat" is defninitely one of my favorite articles
in the Pouch. In fact, I've used
the suggestions from that article in all of my games so far, I think.
Austria's "breach of contract" in one game is my main, uh, <i>official</i>
excuse for attacking her. I can't say yet just how effective the lawyer approach
is, but my initial impression is that it works, and it fits in well with my
"make deals now, fix them later" approach to negotiating.
<P>
I'll see if I can't throw together something along similar lines -- 
concentrating on the diplomatic rather than pure tactical aspects of
the game -- 
for an upcoming issue.  I don't know how much the experts will
get out of it, but it might help out newbies at least. My main fear is that
it might actually be <i>good</i> advice, in which case I'll get a reputation
for being a
newbie prodigy, and I'll be resigned to gunboat games for the rest of my life.
<H4>From David Grigsby (<a href=mailto:DAVID_GRIGSBY@mail.doa.state.nc.us>DAVID_GRIGSBY@mail.doa.state.nc.us</a>):</H4>
     I would like to comment on Paul Windsor's article.  I completely agree 
     that the quality of press, in terms of defining goals, is often 
     lacking.  I have been frustrated by this, and until reading Paul's 
     article have been unable to put my finger on my frustration.  But he 
     hits it exactly:  an unwillingness to clarify goals.  As an example, I 
     was very strong as France in one game, and the English player kept 
     asking me to help him.  I kept asking why I should, what were the 
     goals.  And the English player kept being needy.  Despite several 
     pleas on my part, she didn't understand that I wanted something more 
     than "help me" to go on.  Help you do what?  What's in it for me?  I 
     think all players should read the sections detailing how to draw up an 
     agreement.
    <P> 
     But I think Paul misses one point, when he emphasizes the need to 
     start, and thereby dominate, the discussion.  He mentions Dan's 
     articles on his games.  When reading them, I've always thought, "Where 
     can I find chumps like that to play with?"  Maybe Dan and Paul are 
     right, that this will usually work.  But I always fear that players 
     will resent me for trying to lead them around by the nose.  I know 
     from EOGs that even in trying to hold back a little, some players have 
     not liked me for this exact reason.  So, I think starting the 
     discussion is <b>sometimes</b> important, but you need to be careful with 
     whom you adopt this strategy.
<P>
<B><i>[Author's response:
Thanks, David, for the kind words. Your example helps to illustrate an
important point. The more precise you are, the more likely you are to get a
constructive response. This is true even for a minor power negotiating with
a great one. The lawyer/diplomat model is one route to such precison,
though there are many others.
<P>
Addressing your criticism, I share your fear regarding backlash. In the
games I've played so far, there has always been someone who either resented
or feared (or both) the strong voice I projected into the game. So far,
however, there has been only one instance where that resentment has been my
downfall. As I said in my article, I haven't played that many PBEM games
yet, but it seems to me my style has helped me more than hindered me so
far.
<P>
I don't think that those who are swayed by "firstest and mostest"
negotiating styles are "chumps." My experience is that no one is too smart,
educated, rich or powerful to fall into the trap of letting other people
set the agenda. The first speaker in any debate always has the opportunity
to define the framework for the entire remaining discussion. Those speakers
who follow him feel they must address his issues before moving on to their
own. Often times, the following speakers spend all of thier time reponding,
rather than presenting their own agenda. That's not smart (nor is it "being
led around by the nose"), but it's very human.]</i></b>
<H4>From Tom Corcoran (<a href=mailto:tpc@inch.com>DAVID_GRIGSBY@tpc@inch.com</a>):</H4>
Just wanted to say that I thought that your article on contracts
negotiations in Diplomacy was great.
<P>
I've started using your theory of contracts negotiation already in the
game
I'm currently in.  At least insofar as I've tried to keep the
negotiation
open and to communicate first with everyone after results are
posted.
<P>
I'm curious as to what you'd think about the following, though: What
if
you know that you'll never follow through with <i>any</i> contract that you
might
propose, at least not right away? Should you then still propose
something
specific?  It seems that one of the drawbacks of such a <i>modus operandi</i>
would be that due to the necessity of deceit in Diplomacy you'll be
quickly
branded a contract-breaker (because the nature of your communications
are
so specific).  Or have I misread your advice?
<P>
<b><i>[Author's response:
Hmmmmm. Interesting observation. You're right, of course. You can't make
contracts with everyone or you'll quickly paint yourself into a corner.
<P>
My article was aimed more at those negotiations you are having with
persons
you intend as your true allies. On the other hand, I don't see why you couldn't use
the
strategy as the basis for deceit as well. The best deceit is that which
seems most sincere, after all.
<P>
Personally, I don't worry much about being branded a "contract breaker"
or
a "stabber." It's all part of the game. In the real world, people break
contracts all of the time. Mostly, they don't have a problem finding new
partners to contract with. Usually, they have the new partner lined up
before they break the old relationship. That's sound advice in Diplomacy, as
well.
<P>
In first year law school Contracts class, one of the subjects you
discuss
is when to decide to engage in breach of contract. The answer is that
you
should willingly breach a contract if (i) the benefits of breach
outwiegh
the penalties for breach or (ii) the party with whom you contracted
doesn't
have the means (for whatever reason) of enforcing the contract terms or
it's penalties.
<P>
That's a decent rule of thumb in Dip, too.]</i></b>
<H4>From James Harman (<a href=mailto:harmanjd@CAA.MRS.UMN.EDU>harmanjd@CAA.MRS.UMN.EDU</a>):</H4>
Your comments on how to handle negotiations in Diplomacy were most
informative.  I would like to say that these methods work very well.
The only thing that I ever worry about by following these guidelines is
bullying an enemy.  Thus, periodically, I think that it can be wise to
ask the other player what they would like to do.  If they respond with
"I dunno" then you have the perfect oppurtunity to present your future
plan.  If they really have a good idea then some give-and-take can
start.  Thus, the query, "what should we do now?" is not always just a
weak probe for information;  it can also be used to check wether your
ally is in the game, has a brain to think, and can really be trusted.
I think that I will try to apply more of your advice in
future games.
<P>
<B><I>[Author's response:
I appreciate your compliments and your feedback. Since Manus is soliciting
a follow-up article from me, I am finding these kinds of replies very
helpful.
<P>
I agree that there is also a useful place for deferring to your ally. I
probably overstated the proposition a bit to make my point. I stick by my
observation, though, that as a general rule, players overuse this device
and gain little by it.
<P>
I have experienced the reaction of a neighbor viewing my style as bullying
or overbearing. You have to measure your neighbors and go with the flow
sometimes. I tend to view such reactions, however, as a red flag. Anyone
who regards evenhanded deal-making as bullying is not an ideal choice for
an ally.]</i></b>

<a href="../../F1997R/Smithson/Sealion.html">The Sealion Opening In Action</a></H3>
<HR>
<H4>From an Anonymous Reader:</H4>
I was intrigued by the report on the Sealion opening in an actual game
in the Fall '97 Retreat issue.  But the article left an important
question unanswered:  how did the game work out?  According to the
article, Germany was at six while France and Russia were at nine each in Fall
1903.  This doesn't sound like the best situation for Germany.
If Germany can expect France to get
the better end of the deal, should a German consider the Sealion very
seriously?

	Anyway, I enjoyed the article, but I would really love to hear how it
turned out.

<b><i>[Editor's response: The author of the article didn't answer that
important question because the answer was unknown.  The article was

I've been reading pages at your site for a few weeks now and must

<P>
I've been out of game circles for a few years (I think '93-'94 was the

Australian Tournament Circuit.  In '92 or '93 (it's embarrassing not to
remember exactly when), I won the Australian National Championship in
Canberra.

I used to contribute quite a bit to 'zines at the time, on overall game

I'd like to see a simple brief on how to go about getting registered with a Judge and get into a game.
<P>
I have tried to do so, and only hope that my registration and confirmation numbers are not hopelessly screwed up, but it was fairly confusing to me what the sequence of steps was supposed to be.

<H4>From An Anonymous Reader (<a href=mailto:SiberioS@aol.com>SiberioS@aol.com</a>):</H4>
I think to make it easier to sift through the Dip Pouch there should be seven
sections. With each one dedicated to one country alone and contain all
strategy and info about that specific country. Why? Because I hate sifting
through the issues of the Dip Pouch to look for specific information on
countries.
<P>
<b><i>[Editor's response:  Thank you both for your comments.  These are just
the kind of things we are always looking to find out.  Regarding registering
on judges, does anyone out there want to take a shot at providing a quick-start
guide to registering with a judge and signing on to a game through The Pouch
registration and game queue pages?  (If not, we'll try to get to it.)<p>
As far as providing seven separate links somewhere inside The Pouch (one for
each power) to allow quick
access to articles that provide strategy information for each power, watch
for an upcoming development that is kind of along those lines, and in the meantime,
<!--
dividing The Pouch into seven sections, the only things that really
lend themselves to dividing Web pages up by county are strategy articles.  If
you look at most of the other Web pages we have in the various sections of 
The Pouch, and the many articles in the Zine that are not strategy articles,
they wouldn't have anywhere to fit in if The Pouch only consisted seven sections
for powers.  Strategy articles for variants that have powers that are not part
of the standard seven (such as Modern) would also be left homeless.<p>
And as for strategy articles, it just so happens that there already is a page
that lists strategy articles, broken down by power when they concern a specific
power.
