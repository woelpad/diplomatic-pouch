<H1 align=center>Judge Variant List</H1>
<H3 align=center><i>David Norman</i></H3>
<p align=justify>
When the Diplomacy Judge was first written by Ken Lowe, it supported three
variants: Standard, Youngstown, and Loeb9. By 1991, the number was up to
twelve, and by 1996, it had passed twenty. A lot of these were fairly simple
variants, including several that use the standard map and powers, and just
change the starting position (e.g., Fleet Rome, Shift Left and Right).
<p align=justify>
With the introduction of Mapper, allowing games of variants to easily be mapped
out by the players, and then MapMaker, allowing new variants to be coded far
more quickly than before, the number of variants has increased rapidly, and has
now passed forty. It is therefore getting to the stage that a lot of judge
players do not know what is available. The aim of this list of variants is to
let people know what is available, so that more games of different variants
can be played.
<p align=justify>
Some variants are fully completed, and are available for anybody who wants to
play them. Others are still being worked on, as test games show up flaws in the
design, and new revisions are brought out by the author. Help testing variants
is always appreciated, although it is even more important than normal that you
stick with a position to the end, as the discontinuity caused by a change of
players can both hide problems in the variant, and show up problems that don't
really exist.
<p align=justify>
The table below is a complete list of the different Diplomacy variants that are
implemented on the many computer adjudicators ("judges") throughout the world.
For more information on variants or on a particular variant, check out
<a href=/DipPouch/Online/variants.html>The Pouch's Variants Page</a>, which
makes an effort to list every variant known to man.  There you will find
more information on the variants supported on the judges, descriptions of
those that are not, and even some variants which use hand- or non-judge
adjudication in combination with the judges (i.e., which <i>are</i> played on
the judge but do <i>not</i> show up in the list below).
<P>
Notes on the list:
<ol>
<li>This list will probably not be updated regularly.  This version is
current as of the release of the Winter 1997 Adjustment issue of the
Diplomatic Pouch Zine (early January 1998).
<li>Each variant has a "status," which is one of the following:
<ul>
<li>Initial Testing: Checking that the variant is correctly installed on
the judge, and that the correct provinces are adjacent.
<li>Playtesting: Testing how well the variant plays.
<li>Awaiting Distribution: Waiting to be added to the judge installation
files, so
that it appears on all judges.
<li>Stable: On all judges, and in full use.
<li>Obsolete: No longer recommended/available for play, and awaiting deletion.
</ul>

<th width=20%>Variant
<th width=20%>Status
<th width=10%>Judges
<th width=50%>Description
<tr><th><tt>Standard
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>Standard Diplomacy. This is the game originally designed by Allan
Calhamer in the 1950's, and is still the most commonly played variant on the
judges. The copyright is owned by Hasbro.
<tr><th><tt>Chaos
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>Played on a standard map, this is a 34 player variant, with each
power starting with just one supply centre. The game starts with a build
phase,
so that players can decide whether to start with an army or a fleet.
<tr><th><tt>Britain
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>The standard map is modified slightly, so that all six home
provinces
in England are supply centres. England starts with six armies, and so must
persuade somebody to convoy him out of his home before he can do anything.
<tr><th><tt>1898
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>On a standard map, each of the standard powers starts with
only one
of their home centres owned, and only one unit. They must then capture their
other home centres before they can build on them.
<tr><th><tt>Crowded
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>The standard map is modified slightly, so that there is a 35th
supply centre in Ruhr. Four new powers are then added in Scandinavia, The
Lowlands,
Iberia (including Tunis) and The Balkans. This leaves no neutral supply
centres.
<tr><th><tt>Fleet_Rome
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>This is the standard variant, except that Italy starts with
a fleet
in Rome instaed of an army.
<tr><th><tt>Shift_Right
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>On the standard map, each of the standard powers start in
somebody
else's home supply centres, and must make their way home before they can build
any new units. Germany and Turkey start in each others home centres, and the
other five powers rotate their starting positions two places
anti-clockwise around
Germany.
<tr><th><tt>Shift_Left
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>On the standard map, each of the standard powers start in
somebody
elses home supply centres, and must make their way home before they can build
any new units. Germany and Turkey start in each others home centres, and the
other five powers rotate their starting positions two places clockwise around
Germany.
<tr><th><tt>Wraparound
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>The standard map is modified, so that the Top and Bottom edges
touch, as do the Left and Right edges. Units can freely move from the Atlantic
into Eastern Russia and Turkey, and from St. Petersburg into Syria and
vice-versa. A couple of extra provinces and supply centres are also added, to
balence the game.
<tr><th><tt>Wraparound2
<th>Playtesting
<th>USTR
<td>This is a slight modification on the original Wraparound variant.
Instead of St. Petersburg touching the Nothern Edge of the board, and allowing
wraparound moves into Syria, instead the Barents Sea touches the Eastern edge,
and so allows wraparound moves into the North Atlantic. This is intended
to help
Russia keep StP more easily, and to allow Turkey and Russia to send
fleets into
the Atlantic.
<tr><th><tt>Milan
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>The standard map is modified around Italy. The supply centre in
Venice is moved to a new province, Milan, so that it is no longer next to any
other home supply centres. The rest of Italy is also redesigned, and the
border
between Italy and France is widened, to allow Italy to head West more easily.
<tr><th><tt>Rootz
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>On the standard map, a cut is made from the edge of the board to
Switzerland. This cut is then opened up, and a second board with the
same cut is
connected to it. This creates a double sized 14 player map, which as you move
around Switzerland, you go
Bur1 to Mar1 to Pie2 to Tyr2 to Mun2 to Bur2 to Mar2 to Pie1 to Tyr1 to Mun1 to Bur1. The
variant is
often played with seven players, each controlling two powers.
<tr><th><tt>Layered
<th>Playtesting
<th>USTR
<td>Two standard maps are placed one on top of the other, and each
player controls the same power on each map. All units may move as normal on a
single board, or they may move from any province on one map to the same
province
on the other map.
<tr><th><tt>Loeb9
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>A nine player variant on a map similar to the standard map.
The seven
standard powers are involved, as are Norway and Spain. Extra supply
centres are
added in Spain, Ireland and Eastern Germany to balence the game out.
<tr><th><tt>Chromatic
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>The map of Italy, from Venice and the Adriatic in the East to the
Tyrrhenian Sea and Tunis in the West, is cut out of the standard map. Five copies
of it are then made, and are arranged around Switzerland, which is now a
supply
centre. Each player then plays one of the five Italies in a perfectly balenced
game.
<tr><th><tt>Youngstown
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>The standard map is altered a bit, and is also extended to
include
the whole of Asia and more of North Africa. Three extra powers are added in
India, China and Japan. Russia is given two extra units, and several of the
standard powers have one extra unit, including Italy in Ethiopia, and England
and France in colonial South East Asia. There are also off-board boxes which
allow units to circumnavigate the board from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and
around Africa into the Indian Ocean.
<tr><th><tt>Pure
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>Seven powers play on a map which has only seven provinces. Every
province is next to every other province, and so all powers are equally
adjacent.
<tr><th><tt>Future
<th>Playtesting
<th>CAWA
<td>Seven powers play on a ring of land containing only seven supply
centres. Each starts with an army, but once they gain a build, they can build
either a fleet, to sail off and capture Atlantis, or a space fleet, to fly off
and capture Alpha-Centuri, both of which are also supply centres.
<tr><th><tt>Aberration
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>The variant of powers that didn't make it. Each of the powers in
this variant could have been one of the great powers of Diplomacy, except that
history dealt them a bad hand. The crutial battle that would have made
them the
great power was lost, and the then enemy is now the great power instead.
Played
on a map of Europe, it is a nine player variant.
<tr><th><tt>Asia
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>A seven player variant on a map of Asia, stretching from
Warsaw and
the Baltic Coast in the West, to Japan and North-West Australia in the East.
While it claims to be balenced, experience has shown that this is not the case.
<tr><th><tt>Asia2
<th>Awaiting<br>Distribution
<th>CAWA
<td>Following an article in the Diplomatic Pouch about the problems
with the Asia Variant, this is an attempt to even it up.
<tr><th><tt>Modern
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>A modernised version of the Standard Diplomacy board this map
extends slighly further east and south than the standard Diplomacy map, and
contains the 10 great powers of today. Originally this variant was designed to
include aircraft units, but these were removed when the game was added to the
judges, and the variant plays just as well with or without them.
<tr><th><tt>Colonial
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>The second variant to be released by Avalon Hill. It is set in
Asia, and includes both Asian powers (Japan, China, Russia, Turkey), and
colonial powers (England, France and Holland). It is purposely not
balenced, but
this does not appear to cause too much of a problem with the variant, although
some of the weaker powers are rather unlikely to get an outright win. The
optional rules for this variant have not yet been coded into the judge,
although
this is currently being worked on.
<tr><th><tt>Hundred
<th>Stable,<br>becoming obsolete<br>once H31 and<br>H32 are<br>available
<th>All
<td>Following the observation that a lot of players are happy
to settle
for a three way draw, and so get very little practice at playing a dynamic
end-game, this three player variant throws the players almost
immediately into a
dynamic end-game. Set in the Hundred Years war, the game is fought out between
England, France and Burgundy. With each power starting with four or five
centres, and only nine centres required to win, the game can often be over in
three or four years, making it ideal for real-time games.
<tr><th><tt>Hundred3
<th>Obsolete
<th>USTR, USSF
<td>Based on the Hundred Variant, this contains improvements to
try and
remove easy stalemate lines, and make the game more dynamic.
<tr><th><tt>H31
<th>Awaiting<br>Distribution
<th>USTR, USSF
<td>A slight modification from Hundred3, it is recommended that this
variant is played, rather than Hundred or Hundred3.
<tr><th><tt>H32
<th>Awaiting<br>Distribution
<th>USSF
<td>A slight modification from Hundred3, it is recommended that this
variant is played, rather than Hundred or Hundred3. Following playtesting,
opinion is split as to whether H31 or H32 is the better version, and so both
will be distributed at some point in the future.
<tr><th><tt>1410
<th>Obsolete
<th>USSF, CAWA
<td>An attempt to apply the principles of the 1898 variant to
Hundred,
this variant did not work, and will be removed from the judges at some
point in
the future.
<tr><th><tt>Empire
<th>Obsolete
<th>CAWA, USTR
<td>Based in modern North and Central America, this variant
follows the
fall of the US and Canadian governments, and the fragmentation of their
countries. Ten powers fight to retake control of the continent. This is the
third test version of the variant, and has now been superceeded.  The first
two versions, which were played on the CAWA judge and are now also obsolete,
were called <tt>MoUSNA</tt> [for "Modern U.S. and North America"] and
<tt>NAModern</a> [for "North American Modern"].
<tr><th><tt>Empire2
<th>Obsolete
<th>USTR
<td>The second test version of the "Fall of the American Empire"
variant, it is much more balenced than the first version, due to the
movement of
neutral supply centres, borders, and a couple of the powers.
<tr><th><tt>Empire3
<th>Playtesting
<th>USTR
<td>The third version of the Empire variant, this is only slightly
changed from the second version. Current playtesting is suggesting that there
will be one more minor change before this becomes the final version.
<tr><th><tt>Heptarchy
<th>Obsolete
<th>USTR
<td>Based in Britain in the Seventh Century, this seven player
variant
is looking fairly promising, although currently a couple of the powers are
fairly weak (especially Scotland). This version of the Variant is now obsolete
<tr><th><tt>Heptarchy3
<th>Playtesting
<th>USTR
<td>The third version of the Heptarchy Variant. Initial
playtesting has
shown that this is much better balenced than the original version.
<tr><th><tt>Classicb
<th>Obsolete
<th>USCT
<td>The second version of the Classical Variant, this is a five
player
variant set around the Mediterranean in the third Century B.C. This version is
now obsolete.
<tr><th><tt>Classicc
<th>Obsolete
<th>USCT
<td>The third version of the Classical Variant. This version is now
obsolete.
<tr><th><tt>Classicd
<th>Obsolete
<th>USCT
<td>The fourth version of the Classical Variant. This version is now
obsolete.
<tr><th><tt>Classice
<th>Obsolete
<th>USCT
<td>The fifth version of the Classical Variant. This version is now
obsolete.
<tr><th><tt>Classical
<th>Awaiting<br>Distribution
<th>USCT, USSF
<td>The sixth version of the Classical Variant. Playtesting has shown
that problems with the earlier development versions have all been
resolved, and
this is the final version.
<tr><th><tt>African
<th>Obsolete
<th>USTR
<td>A six player variant set in Africa. The game appears to be fairly
well balenced - in the first playtest, the powers which the players thought
would be the strongest ended up with the worst result. The author of the
variant
has asked that only the revised version of this variant is played, and so this
version is now obsolete.
<tr><th><tt>African2
<th>Initial Testing
<th>USTR
<td>The revised version of the African variant, this version
clears up
a couple of minor ambiguities on the map, and changes one start position.
<tr><th><tt>Mediterranean1
<th>Playtesting
<th>USTR
<td>The first version of a Mediterranean variant, this is
currently in
playtesting, and some serious problems with stalemate lines are showing up.
<tr><th><tt>Civil_war1
<th>Playtesting
<th>USTR
<td>The first version of a three player variant set in the American
Civil war.
<tr><th><tt>Crisis
<th>Playtesting
<th>USSF
<td>A variant based around the Crisis of Rome. Initial reaction has
been good, but the map is not quite balenced yet. This variant uses the
innovative concept of starting the game with each player having one unit, but no
supply centre, and has to capture a centre in the first year in order to
stay in
the game.
<tr><th><tt>Sail_Ho
<th>Playtesting
<th>USTR
<td>A four player variant which contains more sea than most, this
variant is designed to encourage convoying.
<tr><th><tt>1720
<th>Playtesting
<th>USTR
<td>A nine player variant set 200 years before Standard
Diplomacy, but
in a very similar area of the world.
<tr><th><tt>Abstraction2
<th>Initial Testing
<th>USTR
<td>A great favorite of many players, this
variant is played on a map which covers much the same area as Standard
Diplomacy, but contains more provinces, and each of the standard powers starts
with an extra supply centre. It does not play as well on the judge, due to the
Army/Fleet rules having not been implemented.
<tr><th><tt>Balkan1
<th>Playtesting
<th>USTR
<td>Set in the Balkans, this is a seven player variant which starts
with no neutral supply centres.
<tr><th><tt>South_East_Asia1
<th>Initial Testing
<th>USTR
<td>Set in South East Asia, this seven player variant stretches from
Southern China in the North-West to North-West Australia in the South-East.
<tr><th><tt>Machiavelli
<th>Stable
<th>All
<td>Not so much a variant, as a different game based on
Diplomacy, this
introduces money and all the things that go with it, including bribery and
corruption, taxes, paying for units, etc. Work is currently going on to
implement Machiavelli 2, which will include all the changes Avalon Hill have
made in later versions of this game.
<tr><th><tt>1847
<th>Playtesting
<th>DEAC
<td>Germany in the year 1848 ('Deutscher Bund'), it is played between
Austria, Bavaria, Hanover, Hesse, Prussia, Saxony
<tr><th><tt>Karibik

<th>DEAC
<td>The Carribean in the beginning of our century, it is played
between
Brasil, Columbia, Cuba, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, USA, Venezuela
