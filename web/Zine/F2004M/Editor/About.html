	  <td align="justify"> We're Back, For A Second Run 
        <p>Hello again, Monkey #1 here. I would like to extend a warm welcome 
          to all those who are coming back to the Pouch. We have worked hard these 
          last three months to get not one, but two issues out before Christmas! 
          This issue brings us back on track to having at least two issues a year 
          and having never NMR'd a movement issue. </p>
        <p><strong>Second Monkey:</strong> <em>Let this be a warning to those 
          of you who are thinking of doing something to help Manus; that man will 
          draft you. You'll do one little thing, like offer to edit the articles 
          for the 'Zine, and you'll find yourself stuck with a full time job. 
          It's too late for Scott and me, but you can still save yourself! ;-)</em></p>
        <p>I would like to take a bit of time this issue to thank all the people 
          who have made this happen. The main people I need to thank are Manus 
          Hand, Millis Miller for all their help in getting myself and Randy up 
          to speed in this endeavor. They are just some of the true workhorses 
          in this hobby. </p>
        <p><strong>Second Monkey:</strong><em> I too must extend my warmest thanks 
          to Manus and Millis (or, as I call them, M&amp;M). Without them, I don't 
          know where I'd be. But most likely I'd end up a bum on a street corner, 
          begging for money to buy &quot;coffee.&quot; So I really owe them a 
          big debt of gratitude. Thanks guys! ;-)</em></p>
        <p>The other key people I would like to thank are all the authors (hint 
          hint) that supply us with articles. Without them, you would not have 
          a 'Zine. To them I give my gratitude, not only as an editor, but as 
          a reader for the past nine years. Without the support of the authors 
          and all the articles that we receive, we would not be one of the longest 
          running 'Zines on the net. When taking this over, I started looking 
          back at all the people who have written over the years, and was amazed 
          by the quantity and quality of work that is contained within these pages. 
          To that end, starting with this issue, I am going to include links to 
          articles from past issues that I think deserve some new attention. For 
          a lot of these articles, time only makes them better. </p>
        <p><strong>Second Monkey:</strong><em> I agree; the authors are what make 
          this 'Zine what it is (whatever that is). Without them, not only would 
          we not have a huge compendium of Diplomacy paraphernalia, but Scott 
          and I wouldn't be as famous as we now are. Thanks, and enjoy this issue 
          of the 'Zine!</em></p>
        <p>Last issue I said that that next game that I run will be the teachme 
          format (based upon the article from S2004M <a href="/Zine/S2004M/Tomlinson/TeachMe.html">Teach 
          Me</a>). I did not do this. The reason is the time it takes to get teachers 
          who have the time to do this. So I am putting a call out for people 
          who would be interested in being a teacher in an upcoming teach me format 
          game. If you are interested, please let me know and <a href="mailto:editor@diplom.org">editor@diplom.org</a>.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><b>Buz Eddy's Dedication</b></p>
        <p align="justify">Because of the limited time to get this issue out and 
          the fact that dedications are things not to be taken lightly, we are 
          delaying the dedication until we can do Buz justice.<br>
        </p>
        <p align="justify"><strong>Past Reflections</strong></p>
        <p align="justify">I want to bring froward a selection of articles from 
          past issues that I feel should be looked at once again. I feel that 
          they are hidden treasures that are waiting to be re-discovered. Below 
          is an article from the very first issue of the Pouch! It is a newbie's 
          guide to surviving Diplomacy. it's still very real relevent today and 
          I encourge all new players to give it a read.</p>
        <p align="justify"><a href="/Zine/S1995M/Mous/Survival.html">The Diplomacy 
          Survival Guide</a></p>
        <p align="justify">The next article is one that a reader brought to my 
          attention. Diplomacy is a game with simple rules but the exucution of 
          those rules sometimes leads to confustion. This article is about one 
          of those issues. Because computers are not that smart (they need to 
          be told what to do), they do not handle paradoxs well at all. So this 
          article came about (I think) to find out what we want as a standard 
          so we can then let those dumb computers know what to do in programming 
          them (like the DPjudge). Take a look at the <a href="Deposits.html">pouch 
          deposits</a> and see what one reader thought of problem.</p>

          the Paradox in Diplomacy</a> </p>
