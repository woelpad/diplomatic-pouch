<B>Brandon Clarke writes about the Zine:</B> <p>As a past editor myself,
I know well what you guys have undertaken. Thankyou for the time and
effort you have committed to... It had been causing me some sadness
of late seeing the Pouch decaying and withering on the vine.<br>
<br>
All the best,<br>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hi Scott and Randy,
<p>Great to see the Zine back. I missed it.</p>
<p>I would like to comment on Floc.net, Alain Tesio has created a fantastic
tool and I always recommend it to other Players that wish to get into
PBEM diplomacy, as most of the initial block for people is reading the
email That the judge sends you, which the floc.net you don&#8217;t have
to. Just need to learn how to send orders without Errors. Then follow
the game as it progresses via floc.net. What&#8217;s more you can customize
your own page with HTML Which is great for the like minded.<br>
<br>
Keep up the great work JC</p>

<P><B>Adrien writes about a Paradox:</B>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Hello,<br>
I'm writing about the Diplomacy Paradox. I've just read this article:
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><a href="/Zine/F1999R/Debate/paradox.html">Eliminating
the Paradox in Diplomacy</a>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> I have some idea about it and I want to share them
with you and have your advice.
<p> First, I was thinking about the ENG fleet in your example and thought
that this army must be quite busy convoying an army under the fire of
4 other units. So I propose this rule:</p>
<p> An army or a fleet standing in a land where a fight involving others
armies results in a stand-off can't convoy or support another army or
fleet.</p>
<p> In other words, if a player has a unit in a land territory attacked
by two other equal forces, this unit can't support another unit or convoy
another army. This is quite logical in my opinion, or at least it makes
sense, if you consider that the troop in question is under the fire
of at least 2 other troops. If we use this rule in your sample, the
result is a complete stand off and nothing moves.</p>
<p> Then I think about why this situation happens, and I conclude that
the paradox came from the rule that declares a stand-off for every unit
in the case of 2 or more equal forces attacking the same land occupied
by a defenseless unit. In my opinion, this situation must result in
a stand-off for the 2 attacking forces and a dislodgment for the attacked
unit if each attacking forces is superior to the attacked unit. If we
use this rule, the ENG fleet must retreat and all other unit don't move.</p>
<p> What do you think about these two rules?</p>
<p> Best Regards,<br>
Adrien<br>

<p><em>Editor #1's Note: I believe that I will defer to Manus on this
article. the DPjudge has gone a certain way, but I am not sure what
decision came of this. I will investigate and let you know what I have
found out it my next article. I want to say that I am very glad that
you look at articles from previous issues. This adds to my commitment
to bring old articles back into the light.</em></p>

<p align="left">Sharpen your knives, polish your lies, and make your reservations
now so that you are sure to be a part of the best WDC event in the Hobby's
history!</p>
<p align="left">The Potomac Tea &amp; Knife Society (PTKS) is very pleased
to invite you to the <strong>Fifteenth World Diplomacy Championship
(WDC XV)</strong> to be held at the <a href="http://www.holidayinncapitol.com/">Holiday
Inn Capitol</a> from 29-31 July 2005!</p>
<p align="left">The <a href="http://www.holidayinncapitol.com/">Holiday
Inn Capitol</a> is the ideal venue for this event, offering great gaming
space and an excellent location--just a block from the Washington, D.C.
Metro--which makes the entire city accessible to our guests who want
to see all of the sights Washington has to offer.</p>
<p align="left">And it couldn't be easier to get here from there! The
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area is served by three major airports:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.bwiairport.com/">Baltimore-Washington International
Airport (BWI)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mwaa.com/national/">Ronald W.Reagan National
Airport (DCA)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.metwashairports.com/Dulles/">Washington-Dulles
International Airport (IAD)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, Reagan National is just a few Metro stops away from the hotel!</p>
<p align="left">For those who prefer the train, Washington D.C.'s <a href="http://www.unionstationdc.com/">Union
Station</a>, is also just a few Metro stops from the hotel.</p>
<p align="left">Would you rather drive--find I-95 and drive north or south
as appropriate. You won't be able to miss D.C., and the traffic on the
Beltway will give you plenty of time to admire the sights!</p>
<p align="left">The <a href="http://www.holidayinncapitol.com/">Holiday
Inn Capitol</a> is in the final stages of a complete renovation. The
rooms are large, comfortable and, at $129 per night, very affordable.
They also include in-room Hi-Speed Internet access at no additional
charge. You can reserve those rooms now, by phone or online at the website
above. Just use this three digit code: <strong>WDG </strong>to get the
reduced rate.</p>
<p align="left">Diplomacy in D.C. with the Pitkissers as your host? Do
you really want to take a chance on missing this? I didn't think so.
More details will follow in the next few weeks. Until then, visit www.wdcindc.org,
bookmark it, and check back often for all the latest <br>
updates!</p>
