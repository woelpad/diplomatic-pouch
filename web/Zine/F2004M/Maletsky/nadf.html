          <p align="left"> Carnage by the Lake was a great time for all present 
            this year. We had new players enter the hobby from the broader game 
            convention, two of the rounds had a game that lasted over twelve hours, 
            other games were played, and little sleep was had. At the finale, 
            Jim Yerkey turned the event over to me to be TD for upcoming years... 
            more on its upcoming new &amp; unique structure soon!<br>
            <br>
            Buz Eddy, the omnipresent face of the NADF, elected to step down and 
            pass the considerable task of upholding his legacy to me around the 
            same time that Carnage was ending in November. Since then, I have 
            been increasingly active as I become more comfortable in my role, 
            and I expect that all the necessary tasks that need doing, in order 
            to move the hobby in the positive direction I envision, shall have 
            been delegated successfully by the end of the first quarter of 2005.<br>
            <br>
            Upcoming policy areas that will be addressed include, but are hardly 
            limited to: ratings; masterpoints; other non-rating, non-masterpoint 
            structures that could help promote play; an organizational structure 
            for the NADF, grounded in a charter; corporate sponsorship &amp; relations 
            with Hasbro; increased centralization of web resources for the hobby; 
            improved contact with the international Diplomacy community; tournament 
            scoring systems, their causal bases &amp; some normative considerations 
            surrounding these; volunteer recruitment for the NADF; and returning 
            increasing amounts of postal &amp; e-mail players to the face-to-face 
            hobby. If you would like to be actively involved, all that's required 
            from you is a highly energetic level of motivation; on the new NADF 
            site (<a href="http://www.diplomacyfed.org">www.diplomacyfed.org</a>), 
            information regarding the Minister of Recruitment to contact, for 
            your particular geographic locale, will be shortly forthcoming. And 
            while you're there, be sure to register for the already-active forums!<br>
          </p>
          <p align="left"> Thanks for everyone's time &amp; consideration; here's 
            to the New Year for the NADF &amp; hobby in general! :)<br>
