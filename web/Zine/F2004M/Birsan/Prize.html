<p align="left"> It is now currently common to have an awards ceremony
after the last round and to give out trophies/plaques/awards for different
levels of achievement. We have evolved to this point from where in
the early days all you got was a write up in the local postal 'zine
or maybe a paper certificate. Further we have evolved to have some
different awards other than Winner with top 7 being acknowledged,
as well as the introduction of Best Country Awards (started in 1976).
Along the way the hobby picked up the passion for awards such as Golden
Blade, Hammered, Dead Meat as well as a smattering of voted awards
for Player's Player, Best Diplomat, Tactician and Strategist. Some
things have been tried and discarded, such as a Golden Bottle Award.</p>
<p>However, all of these have the same pattern of presentation, in that
at the end of the last round of the last day when mostly only the
hard core players are left, are they awarded. When I was living in
Belgium a long time ago, I saw briefly an indoor bicycle contest;
nothing is more boring than a bunch of people going around in a circle
on bicycles, except maybe watching Cricket, without beer, on a hot
muggy day. However, in the middle of it there would be an announcement
that the winner of the next Lap would get a free dinner at Bruno's
Pub or an AM/FM portable radio (a fad and prized item at the time...like
I said, this was a real long time ago), and suddenly there would be
some excitement and cheering as there would be a sprint for the lap
prize. </p>
<p>In addition to the concept of interim goal prizes, I wanted to bring
in participation in the prizes to those more casual attendees that
may play only one round and then go on to something else, or only
have one day to play. It is common in the San Francisco events of
Conquest/Avalon over Labor Day Weekend and Kubla Con over Memorial
Day to have 40 or so players, but only half of them will play more
than 1 round, since there are a lot of new comers and they are recruiting
events. I also wanted to break the rut intensity of some of the rounds
that the hardcore tournament players can fall into when there is nothing
to diffuse the competition. In short, I wanted to shift things from
a Diplomacy Tournament to a Diplomacy Party and Tournament</p>
<p>Using the first stand alone Diplomacy Tournament in the SF Bay Area
(Nov. 2004) as a testing ground, I went and added a whole bunch of
ideas to the event to create a more festive atmosphere, by getting
players more involved with the spirit of a community event. This is
what was done in detail:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Score Board</strong><br>
Players were polled with their registration:<br>
<br>
A. What province would have the most units destroyed (popped) <br>
B. How many home supply centers would be taken in 1901?<br>
C. What would be the ranking of countries by total supply center
count?<br>
<br>
I posted a sheet with the provinces listed by the players (of 25
players, some 17 initial provinces were guessed). Then each turn
players would rush out and draw a skull and cross bones on the line
for the provinces as destroyed or add it if not listed. It was quite
a cheering section at times as units were destroyed and people from
all over would go to the list to put their mark on the list. <br>
In the future I should put the list of home centers taken also,
but the Death Provinces seemed to be a rather good technique to
get people to jump around and cheer. Two units retreating to Livonia
killing /popping each other was a cheer. It also became a boasting
point for the most unexpected place to have a destruction: Barents
Sea.<br>
</li>
<li> <strong>Instant Prizes</strong><br>
I had a collection of risqu&eacute; Scandal Card Decks and would
give out a deck when people would do something especially scandalous
such as a big stab or a big lie or some other scandalous behavior.
However this can be accomplished by any number of gag gifts.<br>
We had some old comic books: Ironman, Avenger, Green Lantern, Cracked,
Mad magazine etc. During the course of the games as various appropriate
things were achieved, we would hand it out right there at the adjudication
for all to see. For example Jake Mannix after his spectacular miss-order
in Fall of 01 as Turkey: Arm-&gt;Bul, Bla C Arm-&gt;Bul, Bul S Arm-&gt;Bul,
when Rumania was clearly desired got the 'Cracked' magazine award
right on the spot.
<p> I had some old games (D-Day and Waterloo) to give out, and these
I did not tell players what they were for so as not to have an
effect on the play of the games, which is an important part to
making the prize structure that the prize chairmen have to be
aware of.<br>
For the D-Day game I gave it to the first English player to land
an Army in Brest/Picardy in Fall 1901. For the Waterloo game I
gave it to a French player that owned more of England than he
did of France, figuring fighting the English and abdicating France
was appropriate. The later player was thrilled with it and it
made his event, and even though eventually he would end up as
France with units only in Liverpool and London, he had a great
memory and a surprise.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>3. Titles<br>
Before the games started we had a series of titles posted for the
first achievers. As soon as it was accomplished the player's name
got on the list. Prizes were not awarded, but titles or badges are
something that could be arranged for a future enhancement of the idea
(&#8230;hmmm maybe funny hats to be worn temporarily):</p>

<p> <br>
All of this lent itself to a more festive event and was welcomed by
the players. The ideas can be expanded upon, over done and then tailored
back, but the ideas of turning prizes into surprises is a good thing,
and the awarding of instant prizes for things expected and unexpected
is also a good thing.</p>
<p>Try it, you'll like it.</p></td>
