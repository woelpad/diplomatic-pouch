          <p align="left">During Dipcon in North Carolina, I struck upon a novel 
            opening for Italy that could be credited with just trying something 
            different on the last day of a tournament that I had no chance at 
            that point of winning. It could also have been the pain medication&#8230; 
            But as I proceeded I began to see all of the possibilities. I have 
            waited this long to write about it because I did not have a chance 
            to try the other option until this weekend in Victoria and I wanted 
            it to be a surprise until I tried it at least once.</p>
          <strong>Setup</strong> <br> <p> The only real necessity for this opening 
            to at least get a strong position in the east is a neutral or friendly 
            France and that only for the first year. If France opens to Piedmont 
            it becomes much more difficult although not untenable. The most useful 
            ally to begin is Russia as they will be in position to profit no matter 
            what you decide to do in Spring of 02. Again that is not a necessity. 
            If you can get Turkey and Russia at least neutral toward each other 
            that also helps. For maximum effectiveness, Austria must do a standard 
            Balkan opening; I like to sell the Lepanto as this may in fact be 
            what happens. The only essential ingredient is commitment, any attempt 
            to follow this route half way is doomed to ignominious failure.</p>

            <br>
            Ideally you have worked out a bounce in Galicia to get Austria worried 
            about the Russian; anything to increase your odds that VIE/BUD is 
            not moving to TRI in the Fall. So Austria moves to ALB and SER and 
            France does not move to Pie. A nice twist is to work out a bounce 
            with Germany in TYR so you can show the Austrian what a great friend 
            you are holding the wolves at bay.</p>

          <p><em><strong>Fall 01</strong></em></p>
          <p> Austria continues the Balkan Strategy, ideally with a Russia breathing 
            down his neck. It is also possible to work the Turkey VS. Russia angle, 
            which is great for selling the Lepanto to Austria. Talk Turkey into 
            attacking RUM and have Austria support whomever is necessary to keep 
            it neutral. As long as the extra army is occupied.</p>

          <p> Turkey and Russia are all smiles, Austria is gasping for breath 
            and Italy just jumped into the drivers seat in the Balkans with leverage 
            on Greece, Serbia, Budapest and Vienna.</p>
          <p> Italy then has the option of A VEN, the stronger of the two builds, 
            or, if Turkish or French Fleets look to be a problem, F NAP</p>
          <p><em><strong>Spring 02</strong></em></p>
          <blockquote> 
            <blockquote> 
              <p>Assuming A VEN</p>
              <p>A VEN - TYR or S TRI<br>

          <p> Ideally, Italy will then have Greece, still call the tune in Serbia 
            and have leverage on Vienna, Bulgaria, and Budapest.<br>
            Italy is at a possible 6 with three armies engaged on the Balkan Front 
            and still has not taken Tunis. The RT might on the surface like this 
            but when the builds show up F NAP, A VEN they have a problem. They 
            are in effect facing a healthy Austria and Italy but they are all 
            Italian units with no chance for a stab. Hopefully Italy has made 
            arrangements with one or the other for their next mutual target and 
            the 7 or 8 center Italy in 04 has some real muscle to control the 
            game.</p>

          <p>The opening and first year are the same. This can work a prearranged 
            action with a bit of play acting on the part of the Austrian or as 
            a genuine surprise if you can talk fast enough.</p>
          <p> The builds are likewise flexible; a fleet makes a turn toward France 
            quicker, an army gives more muscle to face Russia and Germany. </p>

          <p> If the Turk has angered the Russian enough you might even get RUM 
            S SER - BUL</p>
          <p> The important part here is the misdirection. Turkey thinks after 
            Fall 01 that Austria is done and Italy should do nothing to dissuade 
            that notion, even promising SER or GRE. The fleet in Smyrna is likely 
            headed to the Aegean. At worst Turkey is not certain which variant 
            you are playing (sadly this article makes that a real possibility), 
            at best Turkey doesn't know what hit them. </p>
          <p> The Army in Bulgaria is most likely disbanded and they are left 
            in the unfortunate position of fleet in Black Sea region, Army Constantinople, 
            and Fleet in Aegean or Smyrna. If Turkey moved ANK - CON to open, 
            simply bring the new Italian fleet to bear.</p>

            Austria trades Serbia for Triest and Bulgaria.</p>
          <p> Italy trades Triest for Serbia and Tunis</p>
          <p> Turkey at 3 has only what is already on the board, generally two 
            non-supporting fleets and an army in Constantinople.</p>
          <p> Now the reaction of France becomes an issue. If still friendly, 
            then the Italian fleet chain can be useful to convoy out of Albania. 
            If France is hostile, the two fleets in the rear can hold off the 
            French for the one year necessary to complete the Lepanto while the 
            Albanian unit passes through Greece.</p>

          <p> Austria does do some holding, but should not get too impatient, 
            as Russia will be mostly Austrian. Besides, the whole point of this 
            opening is for Italy to be in position to call the tune.</p>

          <p> In 04 Italy has:<br>
            Italy + Serbia, Smyrna, Ankara, Tunis, and possibly Spain. </p>
          <p> Austria has:<br>
            Austria + Greece, Bulgaria, Constantinople, Rumania, and possibly 
            Sevastopal.</p>
          <p> Their units are more or less completely disentangled.</p>
          <p> Russia is in serious trouble barring some huge breakthrough in the 
            north.</p>
          <p> Turkey is gone.</p>
          <p> And France has either been served a nasty surprise or is about to 
            get one.</p>
          <p> The beauty of the Swinging Gate is it's flexibility in 02 and 03. 
            It is a risk to commit so thoroughly to an opening, but the options 
            it leaves overcome the uncertainty in 01. If you cannot get a commitment 
            from anyone in the East you might just force one with an army in Albania. 
            The other great advantage, to borrow from chess, is the rapid development 
            of your units; all Italy's pieces are at the point of attack in 01. 
            I hope you get a chance to try this with a good partner; I'm betting 
            with a try or two of this you won't be thinking, &quot;Oh crap I drew 
            Italy.&quot;<br>
