          <p align="left">In September 2003, Ronald Lokers proposed an Intimate 
            Diplomacy Tournament, having previously run one in 2001, the results 
            of which are recorded here. It sounded interesting, so I signed up, 
            never having played the variant before. The 2003/2004 tournament took 
            a while to get started, so I took the opportunity to play some practice 
            games. </p>
          <p> The first thing I needed to do was choose a preference list. I studied 
            all the power pairs that were played in the 2001 tournament, and decided 
            that the following preference list seemed to be a good one: &quot;AIFGTER&quot;. 
            It seemed that no country has an advantage over Austria, based on 
            the results I analyzed. One reason Austria and Italy seem to be better 
            than the rest is that they receive an initial treasury of 24, which 
            is 2 more than Germany, and four more than the rest, which only receive 
            20. Another reason the A and I do well is that, being central powers, 
            they can expand in all directions (opponents permitting), and so can 
            grow fast. France has the advantage of sitting on both sides of the 
            stalemate line. Against Italy, Austria, or Turkey, there is little 
            competition stopping France taking all the centres in the north. Against 
            Germany or England, there is little stopping France taking most of 
            the southern centres, as those powers cannot get fleets into the Med. 
            Russia has a hard time, because it has too many neighbours and is 
            hard to defend. England, Germany, Austria, and Turkey can each attack, 
            and G, A, and T can all take a centre in 1901, thus it is likely Russia 
            has to spend resources defending herself from mercenary powers, so 
            despite the theoretical potential to get to 8 centres in 1901 compared 
            to a maximum of 6 for any other power, this cannot be achieved in 
            practice. </p>
          <p> Having chosen the above preference list, I have used it in every 
            game I've played (not counting games with more than two players - 
            see later). I figured, when I lost using it, I may need to revise 
            it; but so far I've played 9 two-player games with that preference 
            list, and it has not let me down yet. </p>
          <p> I started a couple of practice games prior to the tournament, and 
            those went well. I did a lot of analysis prior to each bidding phase. 
            I considered each neutral country and decided what it would do for 
            me if I controlled it, and how it could harm me if my opponent controlled 
            it. This could often be counted in terms of supply centres. For example, 
            consider opening as France against Turkey, and consider England. In 
            1901, given free rein, France can get to any of Spa, Por, Mun, Ven, 
            Bel, Lon, and if Eng and Nth convoy, also Hol, Den, Nwy, and Edi. 
            Now since France has only three units, that is clearly the maximum 
            number of builds available in 1901, so controlling England doesn't 
            give any extra builds immediately. If England is attacking France, 
            however, then Lon-Eng-Bre needs to be stopped. Bre-Eng bouncing in 
            the Spring is sufficient, leaving Marseilles and Paris to get two 
            builds elsewhere. So England is plus-or-minus-one in terms of affecting 
            1901 builds for France. Obviously, sometimes powers need to be considered 
            together, as some combinations could cause a power to come close to 
            loosing, and result in a position from which it would be difficult 
            to recover. </p>
          <p> Having considered the values of powers to me and my opponent, I 
            started guessing which combinations of powers my opponents would try 
            for, and the relative sizes of the bids they might make. I then chose 
            my bids so that I avoided my opponent getting combinations of powers 
            that were too powerful, made control of important powers (for either 
            player) expensive, but not beyond their worth, and tried to pick up 
            other powers cheaply. Obviously, with limited resources (without overbidding) 
            it is not always possible to do all of those things. Sometimes I decided 
            a large bid for a particular power would be likely, and I wouldn't 
            bid for it, using the money elsewhere. If my opponent guessed I was 
            doing that control of that important power could be had for very little. 
            But to attempt that would risk losing that power, and so I tried to 
            use that tactic where the risk to my opponent, if that power was not 
            controlled, was significant. </p>
          <p> Obviously bidding strategies change when your opponent's treasury 
            is considerably larger or smaller than your own. I've been in situations 
            where if I control a power, say France, I can force a win, and my 
            treasury is 20 say, while that of my opponent is only 10. Although 
            bidding 11 (or any number at least 10) would ensure my opponent didn't 
            get control, tied bids means whatever I bid, if my opponent guesses 
            it then France stays neutral. However, my best strategy (assuming 
            a rational opponent) is to randomly pick a number in the range 10-20. 
            The best my opponent can do is to do likewise though that still only 
            gives one chance in eleven of not losing. </p>
          <p> I have played one three-player game of Intimate - USTV:int7. I was 
            France against Italy and Turkey. From the start it looked like Italy 
            was going to get squashed in the middle. It is clear in a three player 
            game the middle powers return to being weak, whereas they are strong 
            in the two-player game of intimate. And as in the two-player analysis 
            of powers above, France had the advantage that the whole of the north 
            was open to me. An additional bidding strategy arose in this game: 
            at one point Turkey had a larger treasury than Italy or myself. Italy 
            suggested we could both bid a very large value for Russia, and that 
            would stop anyone, and in particularly Turkey, from controlling Russia 
            that year. Of course it relied on trust as if either of us had pulled 
            out the other would have over-bid, and so lost all their money and 
            controlled no powers. </p>
          <p> In conclusion, my winning of the tournament shows that it is not 
            a hard variant to learn and become an expert at. There is obviously 
            some luck in the bidding process, as bids of nearly the same value 
            are likely to be nearly as good as each other, and yet adjusting bids 
            by one point either way can make a huge difference in the outcome. 
            However, I think there is considerable skill required too, as winning 
            ten straight games by luck alone is rather unlikely. It is quite different 
            from regular Diplomacy, even from &quot;no-press&quot; Diplomacy, 
            but it is definitely a fun little variant. <br>
