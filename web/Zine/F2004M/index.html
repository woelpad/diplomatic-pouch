<dd>After working countless nights and long hours to bring you the best 'Zine
ever, we are pleased to present you with *drum roll* The Diplomatic Pouch's
Fall 2004 Issue!!!! You can get your money at the door, folks. No, seriously,
this is a good one, with some great articles. I strongly suggest, though,
that before you read all these fine specimens of literary accomplishment,
that you read this About the Pouch, to find out what's new.</dd>

<i>Edi Birsan:</i> <a href="Birsan/Prize.html">Prize Sur'Prize</a> </b></p>
</dt>
<dd> Edi lays out for us his latest ideas for increasing the fun-potential in
Diplomacy tournaments. Makes me want to go to one soon, just to win that Raider
Award...
</dd>

<p><b> <a href="Miller/Intimate.html"><img src="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif" border="0" height="45" hspace="5" width="45"></a></a>
<i>Millis Miller:</i> <a href="Miller/Intimate.html">Intimate Diplomacy</a></b></p>
</dt>
<dd> Millis gives us his view on strategy and tactics in the Intimate variant.
A must-read for anyone interested in this long-established variant (and pretty good
for those who have never heard of it, too).</dd>

players considering this variant.</dd>

Federation</a></b></p>
</dt>
<dd> David gives us a quick update on the recent Carnage by the Lake tournament,
and then spends the rest of the time talking about what he wants to do with
the hobby. I suppose he's entitled, though, being the new head of the NADF...
anyway, check it out, and stay informed!</dd>

<dd>Letters, letters, letters! Our mailbox has been overflowing with the deluge
of letters coming in. Why, in the past month since we published the last issue,
we've gotten three letters!!! Ok, so we have a really small mailbox, and it's
easy to overflow it. But the point is, we've gotten a few letters, all well
worth reading. So, thank you, letter-writers! And to the rest of you, don't
be afraid to write us! We love getting your comments, observations, and ideas.<br>
