The following article describes the practical impact of <a href="http://www.variantbank.org/results/rules/i/intimate.htm">Intimate
Diplomacy</a> on game play, as implemented in <a href="http://www.njudge.org/">njudge</a>
1.7 series.
<p> To summarize the variant, it is where two players, after being assigned
their home countries, are given a treasury and can use it to bid for
control of the other non-playing powers for a game year (including
the adjustment phase). Whoever bids more ends up controlling the power,
equal or lesser bids are disregarded. Extra money is gained at the
rate of 1 unit per supply centre controlled, at year end. To win,
you must occupy a home centre of your opponent at the end of any phase.
</p>
<p> Apparently, the variant is quite an old one that had a period of
fame but submerged until recently, when there was a tournament on
the Diplomacy Judges of which Andy Farnsworth emerged as victor with
a 100% record. It is not an incompatible variant with Judge play,
although some significant changes are required to allow both for treasury
handling as well as controlling multiple powers. I felt intrigued
by the possibilities it seemed to offer, which were confirmed when
I played a couple of games with a friend during the 2004 WDC in Birmingham
(with notable help from Edi Birsan adjudicating, my only face to-face
experience with him to date!). </p>
<p> It is in fact a very different game to play than Standard, because
how you handle (or mishandle) your bidding makes all the difference.
Bid too much too soon, and you are unable to control powers when they
are really important, in the middle stages of the game. Bid too late,
and you let your opponent get into too forward a position, from which
there is no defense.</p>
<p><strong>Opening Strategy</strong><br>
Firstly, it is important which country you start with, not so much
in isolation but to where it relates to your opponents. Choosing neighbouring
countries is likely to make for a highly tense game right from the
start, with a careful balance needing to be struck between an all-out
assault on the opponent, and capturing more centres to build up your
income for a later date. But expansion routes are also important -
if both powers are separated, but one is more easily able than the
other to move to new centres, they will have a big advantage.</p>
<p> <strong>Controlled Powers</strong><br>
How you use your controlled powers is vital in the game, often more
vital than your own power (certainly at the start). Unlike a standard
game, it is not necessarily in your interest to see a controlled power
doing well, not if you can capture those centres for yourself. So,
very often, controlled powers will support or convoy their controller's
units into centres. </p>
<p> But controlled powers can also be very potent offensive weapons.
Though unable to win the game (only a player's power can occupy a
home centre to bring a victory) they can launch an attack on the other
player, cutting down their gains or even denying them building space
at home. </p>
<p> Depending on what your aims are, you need to decide whether to lay
out those heavy bids for neighbouring powers, or those neighbouring
your opponent, or both. Accepted wisdom from standard Diplomacy is
that any country will not survive if assailed by all its neighbours,
thus it makes sense to at least get one of your neighbours controlled
at the start. </p>
<p> Controlled powers need also to have their future planned so that,
if they change control on the next game year, they cannot do much
harm to you. Thus, moving fleets and armies to out-of-the-way places
will cause you less grief in the future, and allow you to spend you
limited resources elsewhere, where they will be more effective. </p>
<p> For the final solution, you can always eliminate a controlled power,
to be sure that it cannot be controlled against you, as well as benefiting
from its centres.</p>
<p><strong>Bidding </strong><br>
This is where the real skill in playing the variant lies - how to
bid to get your opponent to waste as much money as possible, while
frugally using your own to control the powers that matter. As a general
principle, you would do well to keep a similar number of centres to
your opponent (if not more!) so that your income is similar or larger
than theirs. Whoever spends a large amount of money relative to their
opponent had better make it count in the following turn, otherwise
the opponent will be able to use their treasury more effectively,
buying back controlled powers and returning the pain and then some.
Losing control of your key next-door neighbour for the following year
is not necessarily bad if your opponent had to pay an exorbitant price
for it. </p>
<p> This leads on to the process of out-guessing your opponent's bidding
system. If they always bid no more than their total treasury, try
bidding that little bit more, expecting that one of your bids will
fail. Or, if they only bid on a small number of powers, see if you
can snap up the remaining ones for a bargain and use them to your
advantage. If you get really into your opponents head, you can end
up working out how much they will bid and bid one more, or inflate
prices so much that they have to exhaust their treasury to control
one power, at which time you make small bids and save your money.</p>
<p><strong>Variants </strong><br>
Intimate was originally conceived to be played on the Standard board
with only two players, but there is no reason that it cannot be played
on other maps, or with more than two players. Both of these variations
are supported - different maps will affect the precise strategy used
to win, and adding more players allows for the forming of 'stop the
leader' alliances and press games.</p>
<p><strong>nJudge Implementation<br>
</strong>In the 1.7 series, proper duplex handling came to the nJudge
adjudicator. This permits a 'Single-Signon,' whereby a player can
Signon as one of their powers and make orders for all that they control.
This mechanism was reused for Intimate, allowing the player to order
both their units, and those of controlled powers. </p>
<p> However, to allow bidding, a new bidding phase was added, just prior
to the first year's movement phase (i.e. at the game start and just
after the previous year's last turn). It is described as a 'bid phase'
though it is represented with the 'A' letter, as in F1901A, to distinguish
from other phase types. Players place bids for each non-player power,
specifying the power letter (or name), followed by the amount, as
in: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">Signon igame password<br>
A 6<br>
Turkey 7<br>
F 0<br>
signoff </font></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Placing a zero bid amount is akin to canceling any existing bids
for that power. Bids are allowed for any amount, with the Judge working
out which ones work and who has overbid (resulting in opponents' bids
for the same powers being halved) when it presents the bid phase results.
</p>
<p> Game listings also inform who currently controls what power as well
as treasury balances.<br>
<a href="http://www.floc.net/">Floc.net</a> support has also been permitted
by the tireless Alain T&eacute;sio, which essentially ignores the
bid information and shows the unaltered map after bid phases process.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong><br>
Intimate Diplomacy, with its arrival on the Judge scene, should hopefully
gain some adepts and become a popular variant, perhaps akin to Payola
for example. Its extra rules are easy to grasp, but it is far from
simple to become a reliable winner at it. And, with only two players
commonly, no press is needed, and the games tend to progress that
much faster.</p>
<p>An intimate tournament is being planned for 2005: please contact

if you are interested in participating." </p>
