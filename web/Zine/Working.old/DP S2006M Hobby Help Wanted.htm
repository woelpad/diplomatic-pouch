<H1>HOBBY HELP WANTED</H1>
<h2>by Edi Birsan</h2>
</CENTER>

<b>Recruiters:</b> needed everywhere; however, there is a special request from Israel to get its hobby going. Contact: <a href="mailto:Shlomi@exanet.com">Shlomi Yaakobovich</a> 
<p>
<b>The Pouch:</b>  there is not a single section leader who will turn away help. Send an email to the section leaders with a copy to <a href="mailto:EdiBirsan@astound.net">Edi Birsan</a> and let us see what you can do.
<p>
<b>Diplomatic Corps</b> (Computer folks WANTED):  
<br>Sascha writes that:
<br>“Two projects are still in the pipeline, and I need help from computer people for both:
<ol type="1">
<li>The long awaited automatic "Upcoming Events" database.
<li>A feature that will automatically create a homepage for any GM that wants his game to have a web-based adjudication and who does not have the skills to build such a site himself."
</ol>
Contact: <a href="mailto:Sahib3000@aol.com">Sascha</a>
<br>(it should be noted that David Norman has a hobby event calendar project nearly completed as we go to press. (Do web sites go to print or to electrons?)
<p>
<b>Press Release Echo:</b> in the Ancient Golden Age of the hobby (1960’s-70’s) the games were, for some, simply excuses to write entertaining or silly press releases.  Casus Foederis is a current example of this (see article elsewhere).  However, I would like to get from GM’s or players some entertaining press releases which we can echo in the Pouch, so that this lost art form of the hobby can get a new revival.
