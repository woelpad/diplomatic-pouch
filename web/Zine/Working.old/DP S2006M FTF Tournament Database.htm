</CENTER>
Ever wonder what your results were 5 years ago at that convention somewhere in Never-Nerver Land?  Well there is an extensive player database on the French site: 18 Centres that has been converted to English.  To get to that page go to:
   <a href="http://www.18centres.com/php/rencontre/index.php?lang=Ang">http://www.18centres.com/php/rencontre/index.php?lang=Ang</a>. Once there you can go to the Prize List (even if you never won a prize), type in the name you want.  Then click on the tournament’s list under your individual page.
<P>
Some of the more interesting statistics that you can call up and manipulate are things like:
Number of players from a particular country or Continent that travel each year to some place other than their native countries.  The turn out by country, of players at various tournaments over the history of the hobby.   The most successful, (judged by coming in 1-2-3) locals and foreigners in each of many countries-tournaments.
