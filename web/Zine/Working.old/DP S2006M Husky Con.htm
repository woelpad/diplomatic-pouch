<H1>HUSKY CON AUGUST 18-19 ON LONG ISLAND NY</H1>
<h2>GRAHAM WOODRING ADVISES:</h2>
</CENTER>
Okay, so I finally got internet in my new house in Buffalo (still working on gas for the downstairs), so here's the majority of the information you'll need:
<p>
I know you've all been waiting for it, and here it is!  The fourth consecutive HuskyCon is coming this August 18-20!
<p>
For those of you who don't know, HuskyCon first started as just a little get together of friends for Diplomacy back in 2002.  Now, just four years later,  HuskyCon has grown in leaps and bounds, last year we had 27 players and 9 boards over the course of the weekend.
<p>
Once again Chez Woodring will play host to HuskyCon; all out of town players are more than welcome to stay at my house for the duration of the tournament, and all Diplomacy playing will occur at my home.  And the best part is, it's absolutely FREE!  That's right, all you have to do is get to my house on Long Island, New York, and you can stay at my house, have delicious home cooked meals by my parents, and enjoy good times, all for free.
<p>
Space is limited (about 6 or 7 spare beds), so getting a spot on a bed is on a first come, first serve basis, so hurry up and let me know you're coming!  And for everyone else, sleeping bags and makeshift beds are what's in store in my carpeted basement.  Trust me when I say that sleeping in my basement is not that bad, I've done it many times before, just sprawled out on the carpet (I might've been drunk at the time, but who knows).  I think it's a small price to pay, when you're not actually paying anything, right?  There are hotels in the area, but they all charge exhorbitant prices.  If you're really set on staying at a hotel, just let me know and I'll set you up.
<p>
And for those of you who don't know, my family owns a giant 5 foot by 10 foot Diplomacy board that is really, really cool, as well as a well stocked collection of other games to play and the biggest grill I've ever seen (rest assured, we'll be using it all weekend).
<p>
A weekend stay at a beautiful, water front property?  Diplomacy, eating, gaming, poker, and two beautiful Siberian Huskies (allergics beware!)?  A giant Diplomacy board, you say?  And, it's all free?  Wait are you waiting for!
<p>
Come one, come all! Two years ago was the largest turnout thus far with 39 players, and over 15 people stay at my house.  I want more people, more games, more fun.  I challenge the entire Diplomacy hobby to try to overflow my house with people.  Bring it on.
<p>
<b>FOR TRAVELING PLAYERS</b>:<br><br>
>From New York City, you can take the Long Island Rail Road to the Stony Brook Station.  If you want to fly, you can fly to Islip/MacAurthur(sp?) Airport (Southwest flies here) or to Laguardia Airport (Jet Blue flies here);  JFK is kind of pushing it, but if it's absolutely necessary then I can do it.  Obviously if you're taking one of these methods to get here, I would be more than happy to arrange for someone to pick you up, or just pick you up myself.
<p>
My address is: 10 Bette lane, East Setauket, NY 11733 for all you mapquest  junkies ;)
