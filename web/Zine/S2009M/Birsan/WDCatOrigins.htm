<p>The WDC next year is at: 
<h2 align="center">Origins in Columbus Ohio<br/>June 24-28</h2>
<p align="center"><a href="http://www.originsgamefair.com/"><strong>http://www.originsgamefair.com/</strong></a>
 
<p>Come with us and celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the great game.  Further it is with great pleasure that I would like to announce that our guest at the event will be none other than the revered creator of <b>Diplomacy</b>:
 
<h1 align="center">ALLAN B. CALHAMER</h1>
 
<p>Mr. Calhamer last attended the Baltimore 2001 event, and this is a wonderful chance to meet him!
 
<p>You can get hotel reservations reasonably through the Conventions website
<a href=""><strong>https://www.originsgamefair.com/2009-origins/attend/hotels</strong></a>
 
<p>Note that hotels are already filling up (The Drury is sold out)  I have gotten a double room at the Crown Plaza which is connected to the convention center.
 
<p>The fee is currently $60. The Diplomacy fee includes
playing in the Variant round, and the One on One Challenge Round, each of which has their own Awards.
<p>Rounds are:
<table border="center" align="center" cellpadding="3">
<tr><th>Thursday 6PM<td>First Round of WDC
<tr><th>Friday 9AM<td>Variant Round  and One on On Challenge
<tr><th>Friday 6PM<td>Second Round of WDC

</table>

<p>The actual event fee for Diplomacy will be available around in a few months, and there will be a special event ribbon for it (approximately $16 that will cover all the Diplomacy rounds of regular and variant games as well as full access to the CADS storehouse of board games on the same floor.
 
<p>Additionally I would like to introduce Chris Mazza who is the local expert on playing at Origins having won the event more than anyone else and is one of only three people to have ever won the North American DipCon twice. Chris will be attending from Connecticut, and will gladly accept all donations of supply centers along his many travels to game tournament in America.
 
<p>The attached is a list of things to see on visiting Columbus.
 
<p>One of my favorite restaurants to go to in Columbus is 4 blocks away from the hall: Ted's Montana Grill, which has the best Buffalo Meat Burgers I have ever had.  Highly recommended.
