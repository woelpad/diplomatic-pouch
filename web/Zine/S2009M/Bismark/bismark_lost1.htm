<blockquote><p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> Regular readers are already familiar with the main series of Bismark Lectures, which we <a href="/Zine/S2008M/Editor/bismark1.htm">have</a> <a href="/Zine/F2008M/Editor/BISMARK2.HTM">been</a> <a href="/Zine/F2008R/Bismark/bismark3.htm">reprinting</a> <a href="/Zine/W2008A/Bismark/bismark4.htm">faithfully</a> over the past year's issues, including <a href="bismark5.htm">this one</a>. While the main series is fascinating in its own right, we have recently had the good fortune to recover some of the great Doctor's work which had up until now been thought to be lost forever.
<p>Rumours as to the existence of the so-called Lost Lectures in the Bismark
Paper series have been circulating for some time. Through the efforts of
publishing contacts in New York, the Envoy [hobby Zine] unearthed at least two such
lectures, both of which were available for purchase. Copyright is currently
held by a San Francisco convent, "The Little Sisters of the Stabbed Heart",
although how this came to be is unclear. The Convent maintains that Arthur
Bismark delivered two lectures at a nun's conference in the spring of 1974.
In any case, the tone and the theme of the papers are extremely
introspective, and here we see the first inkling of the brooding
pre-occupations that were to lead the great statesman out of the hobby and
up himself.</i></blockquote>
<p>It has always struck me as strange that individuals are forever trying to
introduce morality into <b>Diplomacy</b>. There is far too much agonising about
fair play, trust, the rights and wrongs of forgery, copy sending etc. As if
we should somehow be constrained to play the game in a manner similar to the
way in which we lead our lives. This is naive and misguided. It is a form of
cultural imperialism whereby we attempt to graft our own subjective values
onto a foreign world. We cannot pronounce moral judgements on the slaughter
of innocent, terror stricken bunnies by Diplomatic backstabbers. It's just
the way they do things around here.
<p><b>Diplomacy</b> must be viewed as a whole new world where to be handicapped by
such trappings of the old world as honesty, compassion and mercy would be to
die. That is not to say one should consider the Great Game immoral; far from
it, <b>Diplomacy</b> is the purest form of amoral action. Uncluttered by subjective
emotions such as guilt, altruism and the pressures of maintaining lofty
ethical standards in an unethical environment, the Diplomat plays out the
game in an amoral freefall. He can experience the exhilaration of unfettered
thinking and bold movement. The successful Diplomat detaches himself from
morality utterly and completely. "Doing good" or "the right thing" is to
win. "Playing fair" with allies is simply a meaningless term. The ideal
Diplomat utilises alliances up to a point and then puts his partner to the
sword with the minimum of fuss.
<p>The moral Diplomat is not only a flawed player; he is a menace to those
around him. In his efforts to apply his ill-fitting mores he renders himself
a prickly and difficult ally. He may baulk away from your Bismarkian
brilliances, he may even shy away from delivering the killing stroke on a
fallen enemy due to some fatuitous notion of pity. His greatest failing
however is that he is temperamentally unsuited to the game. This is quite
obvious when you consider he is attempting the impossible &#8212 to win a
<b>Diplomacy</b> game without compromising unrealistic moral values.
<p>The best players have no compunction. They act from the purest distillation
of diplomatic instincts &#8212 self interest and survival. They have no problems
with moral justifications and have no need to excuse their stabs. They have
paradoxically achieved a state of honesty and purity because their game is
unsullied by hypocrisy. They don't suffer the confusion and the agony of the
moral Diplomat. For that reason they make better Diplomats.
<p>The blunt fact of the matter is that <b>Diplomacy</b> and morality are an
incompatible pair. To be a <b>Diplomacy</b> player is to lie, scheme, cheat and
ultimately symbolically attack your fellow players with a diplomatic
technique which is described in the most aggressive murderous metaphor &#8212 the
stab. You can evade the actuality of your acts by seeking to excuse them
with limp justifications. In any case you are simply being untruthful with
yourself for little gain. Your victim will not be interested in petty
excuses and bystanders will see through the hypocrisy of your comments.
The Key to successful <b>Diplomacy</b> is to grasp the truth of the game. It
decides alliances and alignments. The aspiring Diplomat must learn the
rhythm of the stab, so that he can wield it or block it as required.
Applying moral precepts or indeed expecting them from other players simply
clouds the game and interferers with instincts.
<p>Although many of us feel passionate the game and view it as a way of life
almost, we should never lose sight of the fact that it is, in the final
analysis, a game. It is not reality or even a paradigm of reality. Why then
should we be dogged by real world concerns? Essentially we are sportsmen.
Does a tennis player apologise when he slams an ace? Does the soccer player
register recriminations because he sold a brilliant dummy and dribbled
around the opposition to score? Does the rugby player feel guilt for tackling
a player when he least expected it? All those pursuits involve identical
elements to those contained in <b>Diplomacy</b> &#8212 deception, feinting, aggression,
killer instinct. The only difference is that the Diplomat's skills are verbal
while the sportsman's are physical.
<p>So carry on deceiving and stabbing, my fellow diplomats &#8212 it's the "right
thing" to do.

In 1969 he delivered a series of lectures designed to introduce the art of <b>Diplomacy</b> to hospitalised schizophrenics. These lectures were later published in the Envoy from 1988-1990 and again in FIST! from 1995-1997, and are considered a vital part of the modern day diplomatic arsenal.
<p>Next time: Lecture 6, in which Arthur removes the brain of the <b>Diplomacy</b>
cadaver, and points out the many amazing and vital functions this complex
device is capable of.
