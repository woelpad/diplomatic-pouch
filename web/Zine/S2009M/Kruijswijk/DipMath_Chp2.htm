<h2>Equations, the fundamentals of the rules</h2>
<p>When we try to explain to a person how to adjudicate a situation manually,
we would probably teach him the simple rule of thumb &#x201c;cut the support first&#x201d;.
In most common cases, supports can be adjudicated with this rule, which
simplifies the situation. However, convoys can mess up the situation pretty
badly, as shown in the following example:</p>
<table align="center">
<tr><td align="right" width="50%"><img src="figure1.png" width="250" height="299" alt="Figure 1" style="margin-right: 15px"/></td>
<td align="left"><pre style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 15px">Germany:
A ruh -> bel
A hol Supports ruh -> bel
A den -> nwy
F ska Convoys den -> nwy
A fin Supports den -> nwy

England:
A yor -> hol
F nth Convoys yor -> hol
F hel Supports yor -> hol

Russia:
F nwg -> nth
F nwy Supports nwg -> nth
F swe -> ska</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<br/>
<center><i>Figure 1.</i></center>
<p>When determining whether the support of Army Holland will succeed, we have to know
whether the convoy of Army Yorkshire is disrupted. To determine this, we have to
adjudicate the move of the fleet in the Norwegian Sea. This move in turn depends
on the support from Fleet Norway, which could be cut by the convoy from Denmark &#x2014; but
only if the fleet in Sweden fails to dislodge the fleet in Skagerrak.</p>
<p>We see that the rule of thumb &#x201c;cut all supports first&#x201d; does not always work.
It is good guidance for manual adjudication, but its use for a more formal
description of the rules or an algorithm is questionable.</p>
<p>Another notion, which can be found in many adjudicators, is the search for
&#x201c;hotspots&#x201d;. Consider the following situation:</p>
<table align="center">
<tr><td align="right" width="50%"><img src="figure2.png" width="144" height="259" alt="Figure 2" style="margin-right: 15px"/></td>
<td align="left"><pre style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 15px">Germany:
A ber -> sil
A sil -> boh
A boh -> tyr

Italy:
A ven -> tyr</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<br/>
<center><i>Figure 2.</i></center>
<p>The Berlin, Silesia and Bohemia orders are a chain of moves, where the success of one
move depends on the success of another. The head of this chain is considered a hotspot
which must be adjudicated first. So if we follow this principle, we start by resolving
the conflict in Tyrolia. Since all units trying to move into Tyrolia have equal strength,
both Army Venice and Army Bohemia fail to move. After resolving the Tyrolia area,
the other orders in the chain can be adjudicated.</p>
<p>Although the idea of hotspots looks sound at first sight, things get less clear
when a head-to-head battle is involved:</p>
<table align="center">
<tr><td align="right" width="50%"><img src="figure3.png" width="365" height="298" alt="Figure 3" style="margin-right: 15px"/></td>
<td align="left"><pre style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 15px">Germany:
A ber -> kie
F den Supports ber -> kie
F hel Supports ber -> kie

France:
A kie -> ber
A mun Supports kie -> ber
A sil Supports kie -> ber

England:
A ruh -> kie
F hol Supports ruh -> kie

Russia:
A pru -> ber
F bal Supports pru -> ber</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<br/>
<center><i>Figure 3.</i></center>
<p>In the situation above, a head-to-head battle takes place between the armies in Kiel
and Berlin. Both units attack with a strength of 3, while at the same time, they are
stabbed from behind by a foreign unit with one support. Since the situation is symmetric,
both Kiel and Berlin could be chosen as a hotspot. If one of the German supports were to
be removed, the hotspot would lean to Berlin, while if a French support were to be removed
the hotspot would lean to Kiel.</p>
<p>Some programs adjudicate this situation incorrectly. They take one of the two areas as
a hotspot, depending on how the orders show up in the internal administration.
If Kiel is chosen as a hotspot, the result will be that the moves from Ruhr,
Kiel and Berlin fail. After this resolution, the algorithm will continue with the other
orders. Since the Kiel order has failed, the Russian order will be adjudicated with a
positive (but incorrect) result. If instead Berlin is chosen as the hotspot, the army in
Ruhr will advance (incorrectly).</p>
<p>Both the idea of cutting support first and the notion of hotspots are based on the idea
that putting the orders in a sequence will help. The sequence in which the orders are
adjudicated is a kind lifeline for the adjudicators based on this principle. For the most
common situations, the sequence will indeed help; but for a truly flawless algorithm,
things can still get pretty complicated (although not impossible). In these cases the
sequence is not a lifeline that rescues by making things simple. On the contrary, it is more
like a shark, something that bites and that we want to avoid.</p>
<p>To get things under control, we must go back to the fundamentals of the rules. If we
take a look at the dislodge rule (page 10 of the 2000 rulebook) we see the following
sentence:</p>
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-left: 40px">Support is cut if the unit giving
support is dislodged.</p>
<p>This rule implies that the move that dislodges the supporting unit must be
resolved first. Since the dislodgement can only succeed when the attacker gets its
own support, that support must also be resolved in advance. Yet none of these sequence
issues are listed by this rule, or in any other place in the rulebook. The rulebook
merely gives conditions with which the resolution must comply, but does not give any
hint of the sequence in which the orders must be resolved.</p>
<p>This means that the rules of Diplomacy are more like &#x201c;equations&#x201d;,
while in most other games the rules are more procedural. The essential difference
between the two approaches is that the equations cannot depend on time. An equation
defines a relationship between variables
<span style="text-decoration: underline">that does not change</span>. It is valid at
the start of adjudication, during adjudication, and at the end of adjudication. In
contrast, a procedure is executed step by step, and each step may change a variable
affecting a later step.</p>
<p>This implies that when we construct an equation, obviously we can not make it
dependent on time. For instance, the principle &#x201c;a support is successful until it
is cut&#x201d; means that the resolution of a support changes over time. It may have a
different value at the start of the adjudication than at the end. This might work for an
algorithm, but is incompatible with equations. On the positive side, an equation may refer
to something we don't know yet, while this is considered an error in a procedure.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the equation approach is &#x201c;all or nothing&#x201d;. We can not
describe a part of the rules with equations and another part with a procedure. The rules
are either wholly described as equations (the official rulebook), or wholly described as
procedure (the DPTG approach). So the challenge is to transform the rulebook into a more
formal description, while keeping the idea of equations (and yet avoiding any sequence).
We will start with the simpler parts.</p>
<p>Prior to this transformation, we assume that orders are checked for geographical
limitations, that unmatched orders are removed, and that for units moving to each
territory, it is determined whether it is a swap or a head-to-head battle.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px"><i>dislodged</i>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">A unit can only be dislodged when it stays in
its current space. This is the case when the unit did not receive a move order, or if
the unit was ordered to <i>move</i> but failed.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">If so, the unit is dislodged if another unit
has a move order attacking the unit and for which the <i>move</i> succeeds.</div>
</div>
<p>Note, that in the description, the word <i>move</i> is in <i>italics</i>. It refers to
the <i>move</i> equation described further down.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px"><i>convoy order</i>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">A fleet with a successful convoy order can be
part of a convoy.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">A convoy order is successful when the fleet receiving
the order is not <i>dislodged</i>.</div></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px"><i>path</i>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">The path of a move order is successful when the
origin and destination of the move order are adjacent, or when there is a chain of adjacent
fleets from origin to destination each with a matching and successful
<i>convoy order</i>.</div></div>

<div style="margin-left: 40px"><i>support</i>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">A support order is cut when another unit is ordered to move to the area of the supporting unit
and the following conditions are satisfied:
<ul>
<li>The moving unit is of a different nationality</li>
<li>The destination of the supported unit is not the area of the unit
attacking the support</li>
<li>The moving unit has a successful <i>path</i></li>
</ul></div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">A support is also cut when it is
<i>dislodged</i>.</div></div>

<p>Things get more complicated for the move. For a simple case, where a unit attacks another
unit, we have to consider the <i>hold strength</i> of the defending unit (area) and the
<i>attack strength</i> of the attacking unit.</p>

<div style="margin-left: 40px"><i>hold strength</i>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">The hold strength is defined for an area, rather than
for an order.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">The hold strength is 0 when the area is empty, or
when it contains a unit that is ordered to move and for which the <i>move</i> succeeds.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">It is 1 when the area contains a unit that is
ordered to move and for which the <i>move</i> fails.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">In all other cases, it is 1 plus the number of
orders that successfully <i>support</i> the unit to hold.</div></div>

<p>The <i>attack strength</i> (sometimes called the &#x201c;dislodge strength&#x201d;) is a little bit
complicated because it may depend on whether the unit at the destination successfully
moves away or not. Consider the following situation:</p>
<table align="center">
<tr><td align="right" width="50%"><img src="figure4.png" width="278" height="148" alt="Figure 4" style="margin-right: 15px"/></td>
<td align="left"><pre style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 15px">Germany:
A war -> mos
A pru Supports sil -> war

Austria:
A sil -> war</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<br/>
<center><i>Figure 4.</i></center>
<p>If the German unit in Warsaw successfully moves away, then the Austrian army in Silesia
can use the full <i>attack strength</i> of 2 to capture Warsaw. However, if not, then the
German army in Prussia will not help to dislodge its fellow army in Warsaw.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px"><i>attack strength</i>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">If the <i>path</i> of the move order is not successful,
then the attack strength is 0.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">Otherwise, if the destination is empty, or in a case
where there is no head-to-head battle and the unit at the destination has a move order for
which the <i>move</i> is successful, then the attack strength is 1 plus the number of
successful <i>support</i> orders.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">If not and the unit at the destination is of the same
nationality, then the attack strength is 0.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">In all other cases, the attack strength is 1 plus the
number of successful <i>support</i> orders of units that do not have the same nationality
as the unit at the destination.</div></div>
<p>In cases where the unit is engaged in a head-to-head battle, the unit has to overcome
the power of the move of the opposing unit instead of the <i>hold strength</i> of
the area.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px"><i>defend strength</i>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">The defend strength of a unit with a move order is
1 plus the number of successful <i>support</i> orders.</div></div>
<p>The final obstacle that an attacker has to defeat is the strength of the moves that
compete for the same territory.</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px"><i>prevent strength</i>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">If the <i>path</i> of the move order is not successful,
then the prevent strength is 0.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">In cases where the move is part of a head-to-head
battle and the <i>move</i> of the opposing unit is successful, then the prevent strength is 0.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">In the remaining cases the prevent strength is 1
plus the number of successful <i>support</i> orders.</div></div>
<p>The <i>defend strength</i> and the <i>prevent strength</i> have a similarity in that
they count the <i>support</i> regardless of the nationality of the support. Some
adjudicators use the same function for calculating these strengths, and
interpret it as the <i>defend strength</i> or the <i>prevent strength</i> depending on
the stage of the algorithm. However, when using equations we can not
depend on the stage of an algorithm, and it is vital to distinguish
between <i>defend strength</i> and <i>prevent strength</i>. The following example
shows how <i>attack strength</i>, <i>defend strength</i>, and <i>prevent strength</i> can
each be different for the same move:</p>
<table align="center">
<tr><td align="right" width="50%"><img src="figure5.png" width="180" height="215" alt="Figure 5" style="margin-right: 15px"/></td>
<td align="left"><pre style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 15px">Germany:
A ruh -> bur

France:
A bur -> ruh
A hol Supports bur -> ruh
A bel Supports bur -> ruh
A mun Supports ruh -> bur
A mar -> bur
</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<br/>
<center><i>Figure 5.</i></center>
<p>The German army in Ruhr may count the unusual support from Munich in its defense
against the attack from Burgundy, so the <i>defend strength</i> of the Ruhr unit is 2.
However, the unit in Munich will not help to dislodge its fellow army in Burgundy, so
the <i>attack strength</i> of the unit in Ruhr is 1. Since it will be dislodged by the
move from Burgundy, it can not prevent the unit in Marseilles from moving to Burgundy,
so the <i>prevent strength</i> of the unit in Ruhr is just 0.</p>
<p>Finally we can give the conditions that allow a unit to actually move to
another area:</p>
<div style="margin-left: 40px"><i>move</i>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">In case of a head-to-head battle, the move succeeds
when the <i>attack strength</i> is larger then the <i>defend strength</i> of the opposing
unit and larger than the <i>prevent strength</i> of any unit moving to the same area. If
one of the opposing strengths is equal or greater, then the move fails.</div>
<div style="margin: 0px 0px 5px 40px">If there is no head-to-head battle, the move
succeeds when the <i>attack strength</i> is larger then the <i>hold strength</i> of the
destination and larger than the <i>prevent strength</i> of any unit moving to the same
area. If one of the opposing strengths is equal or greater, then the move fails.</div></div>
<p>In case of circular movement or a convoy paradox, the equation may not have exactly one
resolution. Sometimes the incompleteness theory of G&ouml;del is suggested, but it is not
that complicated. It is just that equations do not always have a single solution. For
instance, x<sup>2</sup> = 4 has two real solutions, and x<sup>2</sup> = -4 has no real
solution (for G&ouml;del we should at least introduce an infinite map!).</p>
<p>In these situations we set aside the equations, and pass the troublesome part to
what I call &#x201c;the backup rule&#x201d;. For circular movement all the move orders
in the circle must succeed, and for convoy paradoxes a paradox rule should be used.
Recently programmed adjudicators, such as <a href="http://jdip.sourceforge.net/">jDip</a>,
<a href="http://www.hagenah.de/diptool/">DipTool</a>,
<a href="http://www.westeindeweb.nl/palmdip/">Palmpolitik</a>,
<a href="http://www.paradoxplaza.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=61&amp;Itemid=141">Paradox Interactive</a>,
<a href="http://phpdiplomacy.net/">phpDiplomacy</a> (and its derivate
<a href="http://www.facebook.com/apps/application.php?id=8604176918">Facebook diplomacy</a>),
<a href="http://www.stabbeurfou.org/">Stabbeurfou</a>, and
<a href="http://gamesbyemail.com/Games/Politics">Politics</a> have opted for the
<a href="/Zine/F1999R/Debate/paradox.html">Szykman rule</a> for
dealing with paradoxes. This rule says that the convoy part of the paradox must be treated
as disrupted, and the other units are adjudicated normally (although originally it was
formulated differently).</p>
<p>Some conditions expressed in the equations have a one-to-one relation with the
official English rulebook. The conditions that cut a support can literally be found
in the rulebook. Other parts &#x2014; for instance, the strength values &#x2014; are
expressed somewhat differently in the equations as compared to the rulebook. Consider
the following situation:</p>
<table align="center">
<tr><td align="right" width="50%"><img src="figure6.png" width="270" height="155" alt="Figure 6" style="margin-right: 15px"/></td>
<td align="left"><pre style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 15px">Germany:
A ber -> sil
A mun Supports ber -> sil

Russia:
A war -> sil

Austria:
A boh -> sil</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<br/>
<center><i>Figure 6.</i></center>
<p>To a certain extent, the rulebook sees the Silesia area as a single conflict that
must be adjudicated. And as explained earlier, some adjudicators see the Silesia area
as a hotspot and look for the unit with the highest support (Berlin in this case). That
unit succeeds, and the other units fail to move. The equations are different, in the sense
that the conditions for success and failure are given for each of the moving units
separately. The Berlin unit succeeds in its move because the <i>attack strength</i> is
higher than the <i>prevent strength</i> of the other units. The other units fail because
their <i>attack strength</i> does not beat the <i>prevent strength</i> of Berlin.</p>
<p>In the equations, the convoy order can succeed or fail. It is more common to talk about
a whole convoy being disrupted instead of a single convoy order: however, considering the
convoying fleet separately has its advantages when resolving a convoy paradox with the
Szykman rule. Consider the following situation:</p>
<table align="center">
<tr><td align="right" width="50%"><img src="figure7.png" width="352" height="146" alt="Figure 7" style="margin-right: 15px"/></td>
<td align="left"><pre style="margin-left: 15px; font-size: 15px">Turkey:
F aeg -> ion
F gre Supports F aeg -> ion

Italy:
A tun -> gre
F ion Convoys A tun -> gre</pre>
</td></tr></table>
<br/>
<center><i>Figure 7.</i></center>
<p>The army in Tunis plays a major role in this convoy paradox. However, the resolution
of the order is of no importance, because the army would always fail to move even if the
attempt to cut support succeeded. One could argue (this will also be discussed later on
in this article) that the resolution of the Tunis order is not part of the paradox.
Applying the Szykman rule would let the Tunis move fail. This means that the backup
rule has a consequence beyond the paradox. This is not directly problematic, but it
is just easier to say that the convoy order of the Ionian Sea fails (and can not
take part in a convoy route). Adjudication of the other orders can then continue as
normal.</p>
<p>Although the equations are not an exact one-to-one translation of the official
English rulebook, they are close enough for discussing them properly. In this discussion
we don't have the burden of the sequence in which the orders must be adjudicated and
this keeps the complexity of checking the equations with the rulebook within
proportions.</p>
<p>Still, the equations do not tell us <b>how</b> to adjudicate. In the next chapter we
will take the first steps in transforming the equations into a usable algorithm.</p>
