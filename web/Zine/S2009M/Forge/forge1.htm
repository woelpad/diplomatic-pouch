<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Today’s world is characterised by an obsession with empirical evidence. As usual humanity has decided to follow the majority and the way the tide is flowing and as a result of these three humanity has never wronged itself more philosophically.

<p>In spite of both non-religious and religious people having an obsession with whether or not God exists, neither side realises that they have not came up with a decisive answer that cannot be realistically opposed. The non-religious argument is heavily based on empirical evidence and so barely allows even the possibility of God to exist, the empirical is the realm of the senses, the known universe and the definite. God is not a being that is proved definite by the senses nor exists exclusively on Earth and not a definite being completely as although it is universally acknowledged that grass is green not everyone believes in God and so God is a priori, a priori being the realm of the mind, everywhere whether within or not within the known universe, the possible and the unlimited. The religious argument is heavily based on the Bible and while it does provide some evidence empirically it provides no evidence a priori and as a result of the flaws in both arguments neither side has put beyond all reasonable doubt whether or not God exists although both sides are convinced that they have. Although the non-religious argument is stronger it is stronger in the wrong place and greater force only succeeds if it is applied in the place in which the objective is not present the objective cannot possibly be achieved therefore the non-religious argument has an equal and not greater chance as commonly supposed. 

<h2>Manipulation</h2>

<p>Thus we have discovered that empirical evidence alone will not be enough to discover the undoubtable truth. Lying is a large part of Diplomacy and so telling another player a believable lie is of course important. Always in Diplomacy a player is saying "I will move here" or "I will do this". The empirical is the definite and since the future is not definite empirical evidence will not be flawless in finding out if the other player is telling the truth. I have seen players tell me things in online games and providing empirical evidence from other games. Although the evidence they provided was completely accurate did it do any good in convincing me that they would do in the games I was in what they had done in the games they cited? No. The question (which is of course will they do what they are saying they will?) in those games they referred to did not allow an empirical answer. There are three types of question which incorporate every single question in existence:
<br><br>
<ul>
<li>Questions which allow the  true answer to be either empirical or a priori. 
<li>Questions which allow the  true answer to only be empirical. 
<li>Questions which allow the true answer to only be an a priori one. 
</ul>
<p>Clearly the question fitted into the third category  an example of which being "How many characters will be in my book?" The charchters cannot yet be seen, heard, touched or tasted because they have not yet been transferred from one’s mind to anything with which the senses can discover them. To find out if what a Diplomacy player is telling you is true you, as aforementioned, must make your calculations a priori but doing the right thing is not enough; the thing must be done the right way. To make a successful a priori calculation:

<br><br><ul>
<li>Is it possible? 
<li>Is it realistic? 
<li>Is there an a priori possibility strong enough to prove it wrong. 
</ul>
<p>If the answers are yes, yes and no then what you sought to prove true or false is true. Using those three bullet point procedures one after the other but in combination you should almost certainly have ascertained whether or not the player is lying. Unfortunately it is impossible to even get a faint idea what a beginner will do and you will learn this the hard way. Indeed I have been stabbed in 1901 more than once! 

<p>Humans have an obsession with numerical advantages and many western countries have become socially speaking tyrannies of the majority. When a beginner observes the board he genuinely believes that the player with the most scs is the one in the lead. Therefore when trying to add a player to an alliance with three or more players in total you should approach the potential ally with an ally you already have with both of you standing up straight. 

<p>What makes Diplomacy such an amusing game is that it encourages humanity’s common and yet dubious interests: war, lying and betrayal to further one’s own goal and greed. Nothing short of a threat of execution will persuade someone to defy human nature. No, what you must do is do the less obvious to win more effectively. In short, don’t fight the dubious interests, in real life as in Diplomacy if one goes too far with the dubious interests one sooner or later brings about one’s own demise and it is so much easier for an enemy to kill himself rather than you killing him (I “speak” metaphorically of course). You should, with subtlety encourage your enemy to overdo his dubious interests to a ridiculous degree and then he will as good as defeat himself.

<p>Although I have previously stated that humans are obsessed with numbers argumentum ad populum, although one of the most popular logical fallacies won’t work in Diplomacy because there are only six players other than oneself so any majority will be tiny.
