<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This article describes an unusual opening Edi Birsan and I used on the Top Board at EDC (Euro Dipcon) 2001. The reader should be aware that this game was played with the C-Diplo scoring system, which gives a strong emphasis on topping the board rather than eliminating players, and in a time-limited duration (8 years). Hence the tactical scheme it includes might need second thought before using in different conditions (like for instance unlimited draw games).
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4><U>The Set-Up</U></H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you have any idea of what a C-Diplo game is, just imagine that a C-Diplo Top-board game is a lot worse in terms of non-commitments, stabs, shifts of alliance and dynamic BOP (Balance of Powers) type of game, especially when played by top players. In this instance, the top board cast was represented by:
<UL>
<LI><I>Austria</I>: &nbsp;Brian Dennehy, IRL (second in WDC 2000 & 2001)</LI>
<LI><I>England</I>: &nbsp;Niclas Perez, SWE (ex number 1 of DPTR)</LI>
<LI><I>France</I>: &nbsp;Cyrille Sevin, FR (winner of WDC 1997 & 2001)</LI>
<LI><I>Germany</I>: &nbsp;Paraic Reddington, IRL (solid and experienced PBEM player)</LI>
<LI><I>Italy</I>: &nbsp;Brian Connely, IRL (first tournament at the time - the big question mark)</LI>
<LI><I>Russia</I>: &nbsp;Yann Clouet, FR (future ex number 1 of DPTR)</LI>
<LI><I>Turkey</I>: &nbsp;Edi Birsan, US, CA (ex number 1 of DPTR)</LI>
</UL>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Edi and I had been suprised by Brian Dennehy's choice of country with Austria not being his best.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To explain further, the Top board system used to determine country assignments at this event was in the following format:&nbsp; The player ranked first <I>before</I> the Top board chose what order he'd pick his country. Then the second ranked player picked an order among the remaining possible choices.  And so on until the 7th ranked player picked the remaining spot. At the end, if there was a tie, the player who chose last was declared the winner of the tie-breaker. Brian D. was ranked first and chose the 5th "picking" spot. By the time the 5th pick came, Italy, Austria and England were still available, hence our surprise in Brian D. for not choosing England. The other Brian was ranked 7th going into the Top board (and had the 7th picking spot) which is often symbolic of Italy on the Top board. This game didn't prove to be an exception to that rule.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once the diplomacy started, everyone opened very cautiously (bounce in Bla, bounce in Gal, Mos-Ukr, and Smy-Con, Con-Bul for Edi). I'm not a big fan of DMZing the Black Sea (especially in a Top board game), since I consider both options of taking Rumania with the Russian fleet and moving the Turkish fleet South as poor moves, strategically speaking.  The first option is rather anti-Turkish than anti-Austrian (you want an army in Rum, not a fleet), and the second shows your intention too quickly and tips the RT alliance toward Russia's side. That's why, if I am going to ally with Turkey, I tend to bounce in Bla.
<P>But then, the other Brian in Italy opened:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Rom - Nap<BR>
Ven - Apu
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Demonstrating the level of AI confidence for all to see. Incidentally, I learned at that point that Brian Dennehy was Brian Connely's mentor; together working the AI!
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you can imagine, RT's mouth's dropped some 6 feet, but while my mind was racing with the clock to find the best counter plan and struggling with the impossibility of putting a Turkish fleet straight into the Mediteranean and building an additional one (as Turkey, I often open Smy hold or Smy-Ank) I suddenly came up with a new idea.  If you know Edi (author of <A HREF="http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/lepanto.htm">The Lepanto</A>), you can imagine how anyone approaching him with, "<I>Edi, we are going to invent a new opening, the anti-Lepanto opening</I>," would certainly capture his attention. His answer was, "<I>Yes, I'm going to do it because it's a move people will talk about</I>."
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4><U>The Plan</U></H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Of course!  The idea had been on the board all the time! It simply seemed so unnatural that most people simply eleminate it subconciously. Still, in this particular circumstance it seemed (and still does) very interesting. So, in Fall 1901 we issued the following orders:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
A War - Gal<BR>
A Ukr s War - Gal<BR>
F Sev - Bla (in position for a Turkish convoy)<BR>
A Bul - Rum<BR>
A Con - Bul<BR>
F Ank - Con<BR>
<BR>In the winter phase, builds fleet Smy, army Ank<BR>&nbsp;
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4><U>Interest</U></H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The tactical edge it creates for the juggernaut leads to the following points:
<UL>
<LI>Two fleets pointed towards the Med</LI>
<LI>An army in Galicia in Spring 1902</LI>
<LI>An additional Turkish army already set-up for the convoy</LI>
</UL><BR><BR>
<H4><U>So When Should I use this Opening?</U></H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Only if you are really convinced the Lepanto is coming, and when you have enough confidence that Turkey is your ally. Sometimes it's not so evident than in the circumstances described at the beginning of this article, but sometimes you know you have those feelings!
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another name (but less sexy than "<I>Transylvanian Gambit</I>") for this opening could be the "<I>anti-Lepanto Opening</I>". This says it all!
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4><U>But, but ... Austria can bounce Turkey in Rumania!</U></H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yes he can, but it's not likely.  After the opening moves, Austria will probably expect you and Turkey to be cautious about AI, especially if you start talking more and more about the Lepanto. So he/she will likely expect cooperation on your side and would rather secure <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Ledder/Greece.html">Greece</A> than risk being fooled.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4><U>But, but ... what about Germany?</U></H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Well let's put it this way, if you have not cleared the diplomatic situation in the North you're in trouble anyway.  Most reasonable players of Germany <B>NEVER</B> bounce Russia in <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Barnes/Sweden.html">Sweden</A> and convincing Germany that Russia will get only one build is a good-will gesture toward your Northern neighbors that can be used in your future Diplomacy.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Also the same clues that led you to believe AI are allied may convince Germany that messing with Russia would not be good for the balance of the game (BOP kind of thinking). You could even talk to the Kaiser about the balance of power and explain to him/her what you're planning if you trust him enough not to repeat it and really want his neutrality.
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4><U>So Why Wouldn't Turkey Stab Russia?</U></H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As you can imagine, this opening is extremely advantageous for Turkey. Why wouldn't he stab Russia next?  Well, the basic fact which triggered you into taking this risk is the very one that will stop him from stabbing foolishly (if you explain it well enough). Why would the Lepanto stop after Russia is out?  Does Turkey want to remain alone against the AI?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Another leverage point is: &nbsp;Your fleet in Bla gives you more control on Turkey! Your situation is maybe weak but you can still hurt Turkey a lot!
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">So if you're always willing to try something new and desperate about those repetitive and endless Juggernauts versus Lepanto games, try something new!
<BR>&nbsp;
<H4><U>The End of Our Game</U></H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our game, Edi and I did not stab one another until the last season, and we cooperated to keep the Irish B&B (Brian & Brian) at check, which was not made that easy by England and Germany causing me many troubles in the North!  I was down to 2 in 1903, but came back to 5 (almost 6), with the game ending in a very close 7 - 6 - 6 - 5 - 4 - 4 - 2 (German victory - it was one of HIS centers I could have gotten if England had supported me, ending the game with 4 players topping the board - symbollic of how close C-Diplo top board games are).<BR><BR>
<CENTER><H1>. . . . . . . . . . .</H1></CENTER><BR>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had not devoted the time to writing this article until I saw that Rumania was still available on the list of centers waiting for an author, when this story came back to me.  Submitting an article for this <I><B>Special Edition</B></I> issue of the <FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Pouch</B></FONT> is the least one could do after all the effort Manus has put into the Hobby all these years! &nbsp;Thank you again for everything Manus!
