<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Editor brings you this break in your regularily scheduled program, The Pouch Deposits.  While the mail bag was full of comments, questions and SH solutions, it was decided that the 34th Issue remain the topic of discussion.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">After reading and contemplating the featured articles, perhaps you find yourself agreeing with the likes of <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Martin/London.html">Chris&nbsp;Martin</A>, <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Goodman/Budapest.html">Eric&nbsp;Goodman</A>, <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Hood/Kiel.html">David&nbsp;Hood</A>, and <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Shoham/StPetersburg.html">Dan&nbsp;Shoham</A>.  Maybe you've never thought about building a fleet in <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Marshall/Brest.html">Brest</A> to pacify an unsuspecting Italian.  Conversely, maybe you think the author of <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Hawthorne/Norway.html">Norway</A> is full of hot air.  Regardless, there's a lot to debate, ahem, I mean a lot to diplom about in this issue.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Please take a moment to let <A HREF="mailto:dippouch@diplom.org">The Pouch</A> (dippouch@diplom.org) know what you thought about the <B>34th Special Edition Issue</B>.  <!-- Here's what a few of you had to say: -->
