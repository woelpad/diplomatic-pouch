<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As I sat listening to the quiet hum of my computer, trying to organize my thoughts for the <A HREF="../../F2002R/Hawthorne/About.html">F2002R</A> issue, I couldn't help but wonder, "How could I make the Zine better?"&nbsp;  [<I>Timely publications would be a nice start Mr. Editor!</I>] &nbsp;And after the first sentence it hit me.  What about a theme issue?  Okay, but does the Zine really need a theme issue and if yes, then what kind of theme?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This definitely required further consideration so I enlisted the superior brain power of <B>Simon Szykman</B>, <B>Matt Shields</B> and later, <B>JT Fest</B>.  I shared my vision, asked for their insight and came to a general concensus -- it had to be tried.  Not just for the sake of trying, mind you.  No, this needed to be bigger than just throwing a bunch of people together and asking them to write about Diplomacy.  The intent was to pay tribute to the hobby through those who knew it and played it better than the rest.  This was to be the <I>creme de la creme</I>.  Code named: "The 34th Issue."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I had a strategy, resources and a communication plan.  Now I needed "architects" and a working design.  It was not my intent to limit writing styles or confine ideas to a granular level.  In fact, I tried to foster the very opposite.  I conveyed my strategy so all who took ownership shared the same scope.  The secondary agenda was to sow a few new openings, strategies, alliances, and stalemate lines from the group.  In my opinion, this group of authors hit a home run.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The very <I>first</I> author contacted was <B>Edi Birsan</B>.  I disclosed the full scope of the initiative giving him first pick and what center do you think he selected?  Smyrna.  What!?!  Just kidding, but it's no exaggeration that it only took him about an hour to reply... with an article.  [<I>Pretty clever of me not to disclose which center Edi took, aye?</I>]  <!--- Before continuing, it's interesting to note how frequently Mister Birsan is referenced throughout this issue. --->
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Other centers went just as fast.  I had to create a spreadsheet just to keep track of ownership.  By the time the F2002R issue was published, nearly half of the theme issue was claimed.  I joked how it was the fastest solo I had ever gotten.  Ironically, some of the centers I thought would be last picked, went first.  Soon, <B>Doug Massey</B> got involved and suddenly there was a whole wave of people grabbing at dots.  Doug's assistance turned out to be paramount.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Enough credit cannot be given to all who contributed to this issue.  There were a lot of people working behind the scenes.  <B>Larry Peery</B> and <B>Jim Burgess</B> each contributed two submissions and yet, there were still 34 different authors.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With so many working on the issue, a major milestone had to be total secrecy.  I didn't mind if other people helped spread the word but the universal objective was, "Shhhh! Keep this off the chat boards and mail lists."  It was imperative that one specific individual not suspect a thing.  Pretty soon, everyone got into the "game."  I even tempted fate by drafting a note to ask if "he" had heard anything about the S2003M issue, but I never sent the note -- it remains in my draft folder to this day.  Keeping communication to a whisper was one thing but actually building or staging the issue was another.  Imagine how disasterous it would have been had this specific individual discovered the theme issue while it was still under construction.  Not a problem.  I just staged everything on a different website!  A working design secured by ignorance, as they say.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><!--- Now to extend this story any longer would be like making a three hour movie documenting the Titanic.  Everyone knows the ship is going to sink and most of the passengers with it. --->Creating a Special Edition (SE) and using our beloved 34 centers became the theme but was it a stretch calling this the 34th Special Edition Issue?  Was the editor fishing on this one?  Realistically speaking, the 2001 Fall Retreat was actually the 34th issue but it had been "NMRed! (No Issue)", and so was the following issue.  In fact, there have been a number of NMRs so was a 34th theme issue valid enough to press forward?  What about modifying the theme to include 34 different ways to stab someone or 34 different ways to solo or 34 different variants or ... why does the SE have to include 34 of anything?  What's the point?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And there lies the crux of the entire issue.  What's the point?  What's the purpose of creating an SE at all?  The perpetual theme of the Pouch is Diplomacy, right?  Yes, of course, but since numbers are sacred<!--  to our game -->, what better way to honor someone who has changed the way we play the game today but by rallying 34 different authors together to write about 34 different centers on the 34th published issue.  This honored individual has introduced and reintroduced more players to the hobby simply through his love of the game.  Since the publication of the Spring 2002 Movement issue, he has hosted <A HREF="../../../armada/2003">World&nbsp;DipCon</A>, given the <A HREF="../../../dpjudge/">DPjudge</A> a whole <I>new</I> look and has been a constant contributor to the Pouch.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The DP Council, the Zine authors, and its readers have spent half a year building this issue and dedicate it to you. <FONT COLOR="BLUE"><B>Manus Hand</B></FONT>, we hope you enjoy the 34th, Special Edition Issue of the Zine.
