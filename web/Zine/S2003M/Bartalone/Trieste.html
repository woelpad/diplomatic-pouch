<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Trieste is located just inside the border of Italy, east of <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Peery/Venice.html">Venice</A>, bordering Slovenia and Croatia, along the Istrian Pennesula, an important port on the Adriatic Sea, founded in 1382 and home to such sights as Miramare Castle, home of Maximilian of Habsburg and Charlotte of <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Massey/Belgium.html">Belgium</A>, completed in 1860, before thier fateful un-doing in Mexico. It is now a museum. Other highlights for sightseeing include The Karst and the Lippenzan Stud Farm and Dressage School. Today the city has 260,000 residents.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Now on to what you have been waiting for.......Trieste......Austrian Home Center and with Venice the only two home centers of differing countries, that touch. Trieste is probably the most important Austrian home center, as its the only one where they can build a fleet. It is also the hardest to protect, especially in 1901. And definitely the home center most often lost in 1901. An important spot on the eastern stalemate line, suffers from the same problem as Venice, they are both very accessible from their own country, but keep others out pretty well.  I personally think Trieste is the key to both holding and taking Austria.
