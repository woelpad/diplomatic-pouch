<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let’s do a little time travel. It´s New Years Eve - infact, it´s the New Century´s Eve - January 1st, 1900. Kaiser Wilhelm II, King of Prussia, Emperor of Germany, welcomes the start of the century in Stadtschloß, his city palace in the capitol. Around him are his family, advisors, and <I>blue blooded</I> friends while down in the streets are his people celebrating. It´s the height of the empire, it´s the time of Germany´s greatest might and prosperity and the Monarch´s words will be forever remembered:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">"<I>The first day of the new century sees our army, which means: our people, in arms, rallied to our troop´s standards, kneeling before the Lord of hosts. Look at our flags, they show our history... And as my grandfather did for his infantry, I´ll reorganize our Navy until it will be able to win Germany the rank it has not yet achieved.</I>"

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sounds like a good advice when you take over the black units on the board? Well, let me tell you, quiet honestly: I don´t have the slightest idea. My current <A HREF="http://www.cat23.com/wm02/">World&nbsp;Masters</A>´ Germany, as of today, is down to one center. So I won´t even try to lecture all you sharks out there about how to conquor Berlin. Instead, I´ll tell you WHY to move there. I mean, since you´ve already reached Kiel, the Baltic Sea, Prussia, Silesia or Munich, you need guidance. Yes you do.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just imagine you landed in Prussia. Sure, a breathtaking landscape and I can perfectly understand that you will be fascinated by such places as Kwidzyn, Szczuczyn or Skierniewice. And most certainly some of you will want to check out Trzcianka. But once you've broken your toungue asking for directions, take the western highway to Berlin. (And please, make sure you leave those ten million masurian moskitos where they are.)
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some of you may take <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Hood/Kiel.html">Kiel</A> first. Now, can anybody please tell me why Calhamer called it Kiel? Kiel, for crying out loud! Is there any place more boring then that? Look at their homepage: &nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.kiel.de/">www.kiel.de</A> to find the highlights of their public library, their local bus-schedule and some advice how to save on heating costs. Certainly the best news about Kiel is that it´s only 1.5 hours to Berlin. And you can take Germany´s fastest Autobahn.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Silesia? So you made it there. On your opening move or on good moves? Anyway, forget Silesia. Unless you are into social studies: former east Germany, high unemployment, occasional skinhead-spottings. Great place to lift your spirits up; by leaving for Berlin.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or did you occupy <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Hung/Munich.html">Munich</A> first? It´s called Germany´s hidden Capitol. Hidden, yes. Very. Did I ask earlier if anything can be more boring then Kiel? Here you go. Bavarians in Lederhosen! Yep, they really wear that in daily life (and it´s only a question of time until Cyrille will, trust me). Munich claims to be the cultural highlight of Germany. Now, drunken Australians at the Oktoberfest is certainly a highlight, but is it culture? Besides, the beer is better in Berlin, 587 km or 5h46min north.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And then there´s the Baltic Sea. Did you know that the average number of rain days per year there is 144? Sure you could easily convoy to Adr or the spanish coasts - congrats to your solo! For all others I suggest, guess what, the most interesting city in the vicinity, Berlin.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Okay, now that you know, you´ll make the right moves, I´m proud of you. You´ll end up in Berlin and that´s were you want to be: in the second largest turkish city outside Turkey. Wich brings me to my final, and best, advice of the day: take the Underground to "Kottbuser Tor" station, find the "Hasir" restaurant in nearby Adalbert-street and order a $2 kebap, the best west of the Bosporus.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Or go to <A HREF="http://www.diplomacy-bund.de/">www.diplomacy-bund.de</A> and find yourself some Berlin-based diplo nerds - but make sure you play Germany, you´ll own the best center from the start. &nbsp;<img src=/Zine/Common/smiley.gif>
