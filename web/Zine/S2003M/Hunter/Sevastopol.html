<H3>The Real Sevastopol</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sevastopol is located on the southwest corner of Crimean Peninsula, on a series of bays formed by the estuary of the Tcherniya River. These bays were first used as ports as far back as the fifth Century BC by the Ancient Greeks. The port was then called Chersonesus. It became part of the Roman Empire and in the Byzantine period was administrative headquarters for the region. In the ninth century, Kievan Grand Prince Oleg launched the first Russian attack against <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Ravage/Constantinople.html">Constantinople</A>, which was then the capital of the Byzantine Empire. Over the course of the next eleven hundred years, Russians and Byzantine or Ottoman Turks continued to fight sea battles as Russia struggled to obtain a port on the Black Sea, and unfettered access to the Mediterranean Sea. Russia finally gained her Black Sea port, but never did manage to gain unfettered access to the Med. Chersonesus was destroyed during the war between Tamerlane and Toktamish in 1399, and it was almost 400 years before another port was built on that site. Finally, after the signing of the Kuchuk - Kainardzhiysky treaty, which granted the Crimean Khanate independence from the Ottoman Empire and placed it under Russian protection, the fortress - port - city of Sevastopol was founded in 1783 by order of Catherine the Great. Sevastopol, which means "<I>the August city</I>", is located on a southwest extremity of a Crimean peninsula, where the hilly coast is cut by tens bays. It was chosen as a navy base for the Russian Black Sea Fleet because of the many calm bays around the area, and fortifications were begun in 1826.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">During the Crimean War (1853-1856), the city was besieged for 349 days, before finally falling to a combined English, French and Turkish force. Russian losses were very high. The entire Black Sea Fleet was annihilated; three admirals, 106 officers and 3,777 sailors were killed; nearly 14,000 seamen and officers were wounded. In spite of the catastrophic defeat at Sevastopol, the meritorious effort to defend the fortress is regarded by historians as one of the most distinguished moments in Russia's military history. Under the terms of the Treaty of Paris, which was signed March 18, 1856, Russia lost the right to have a Black Sea Fleet, or to build fortresses and naval bases on the Black Sea. As a result of the treaty terms, the city, which was nearly destroyed, remained largely deserted until 1870 when it was refortified and a new naval base started to house the Black Sea Fleet which was also being rebuilt. By 1914, the population of Sevastopol was 77,000 and today, it is over 500,000. The harbor consists of a main inlet some four to five miles long and 3/4 mile wide, with several side inlets. The harbor is 65 ft deep. This, of course, has nothing to do with Diplomacy, but if history doesn’t interest you, why are you playing a game set in World War I?
<H3>The Diplomatic Sevastopol</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Russia is a Land-Power with two Ports, just like her neighbor to the West, Germany. It has been said, however, that Russia more closely resembles two Powers with only four Centers between them, rather than being a power with four centers, because there is no way for F Sev and F StP to cooperate in joint-operations. Russia, therefore, has the option to split his forces three ways depending on which Fleet his Armies move to support. Sending both Armies north runs the risk of losing Sev, Mos and War to a southern attack, so it is rarely attempted. Sending one Army north, typically Mos-StP in the Spring, leaves Russia’s southern defense weakened, and may force an EG vs. R alliance, but it is easier for Russia to Solo with a strong commitment to the north and west. It is more common for Russia to send both Armies south, though. While there are nearly 700 possible opening move combinations for Russia, there are fortunately, only four (legal) moves possible for Fleet Sev, Sev HOLD, Sev-Rum, Sev-Arm, or Sev-Bla. Consequently, the movement of Russia’s Sevastopol Fleet can often provide an indication of the Czar’s intentions in the South.
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<H4>Fleet Sev HOLD [Ukraine System, The Southern Houseboat Variation]</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Richard Sharp's naming convention any Fleet that holds is identified as a Houseboat. Generally speaking, Houseboat openings are rarely used, and for good reason. There are few circumstances in which holding in the Spring is a Unit’s most effective move, but F Sev HOLD, A Mos-Ukr, A War-Gal, can be a very effective opening in a RT Alliance where a DMZ of the Black Sea is agreed upon. If the opening is followed by F Con-Aeg, F Sev S Ukr-Rum in the Fall, the Juggernaut is well underway. If followed by Ukr S Gal-Rum, Sev-Bla, B F Sev on the other hand, a stab of Turkey is well set up.
<H4>F Sev-Rum [Southern System, Rumanian Opening]</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sev-Rum, Mos-Sev, War-Ukr. While conventionally thought to be anti-Austrian, the movement of War-Ukr and Sev-Rum is clearly pro-Austrian, in my view, since the Fleet cannot attack or support attacks on Bud or Ser.
<H4>F Sev-Arm [Southern System, Noah's Ark Variation]</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sev-Arm, Mos-Sev, War-Ukr. As you can see from Richard Sharp’s name for this opening, it was neither popular nor well respected in the early days of the hobby. What rational Russian would intentionally ground his southern Fleet on Mt. Ararat, after all? This opening is theoretically pro-Austrian and anti-Turkish, since Arm-Ank is the most obvious follow-through, but as there is no Turkish opening move-set that leaves the Sultan without at least one Unit adjacent to Ank, it is an attack doomed to fail. Therefore, Sev-Arm demonstrates either a failure to grasp basic tactics, or an ulterior motive.
<H4>[Slingshot Juggernaut]</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Our own Manus Hand, (<B>thank you, Manus</B>) has ably elucidated just what that ulterior motive might be with his description of the Slingshot Juggernaut. Russia opens with Noah’s Ark, and Turkey opens Con-Bul, Ank-Bla, and Smy-Ank. Then in F1901M the Turkish Black Sea Fleet supports Army Ankara to Armenia, destroying Russia's Sevastopol Fleet. The opening is considered very safe for both parties, and results in an even safer "water-power/land-power" configuration of units. Russia builds two (Rum and the destroyed Fleet), or three if he takes Swe, as well. In 1902 the Turk convoys from Armenia through the Black Sea to Bulgaria while Russia's now land-based forces hit the Austria, typically entering Galicia and supporting a Turkish attack on <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Saul/Serbia.html">Serbia</A>. This, of course, means that as soon as any Power sees Sev-Arm, Ank-Bla, Smy-Ank, the screams of Juggernaut will begin, but when playing Russia, that is to be expected, no matter the opening or Russia’s true intentions.
<H4>F Sev-Bla [Southern System, Turkish Attack Variant]</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sev-Bla, Mos-Sev, War-Ukr. This is Russia's third most popular opening, and it is devastating to Turkey if Sev-Bla works, since it can be followed by Bla S Sev-Arm, B F Sev. Even if Turkey bounces Sev-Bla in the Spring, it can be followed in the Fall with Ukr S Sev-Rum, B F Sev. If Austria opens to Galicia, Russia faces a guessing game, though.
<H4>F Sev-Bla [Ukraine System, the Southern Defense]</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sev-Bla, Mos-Ukr, War-Gal. This opening should really be called the Russian Hedgehog, since it is defensive in the same way that the Austrian Hedgehogs or the Turkish Hedgehog is. As such, determining the Czar’s intent depend as much on which moves succeed, and who screams the loudest about the lying Russian dog, as it does on the moves themselves.
<H4>[Black Sea Exchange]</H4>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Black Sea Exchange is Aron Ambrosiani's name for the southern system follow-up that allows an R/T alliance to get both fleets into the Mediterranean.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In Spring 1901, Russia opens with the Russian Hedgehog, while Turkey opens with the Turkish Hedgehog (Con-Bul, Ank-Con, Smy-Arm). In fall 1901, Bla moves to Con, Arm to Sev and Con to Aegean Sea, and the Turkish A Bul can help a Russian army into Rumania.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This opening requires a phenomenal amount of trust. The Fall moves are vital, since both Powers make unsupported moves into each other's Home Centers, and those moves can be easily bounced without cost. But, if your wife is playing Turkey, and you’ve recently bought her jewelry, it might be worth risking. (<I>Did I just say that out-loud?</I>)

<H3>Sevastopol in the Mid-game</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Russia’s four Home Centers and the map design provide Russia with a measure of protection from stabs. Russia can lose Sevastopol or <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Shoham/StPetersburg.html">St.&nbsp;Petersburg</A>, and still function effectively from the other port, though the Czar’s options become much reduced. If Russia is allied with Austria or Turkey, and Russia still controls an unoccupied Sevastopol, each Russian build becomes an opportunity to stab, particularly if the original Fleet Sev is still in <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Clouet/Rumania.html">Rumania</A>. Similarly, builds in <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Goodman/Budapest.html">Budapest</A>, Ankara, or Army <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Furr/Smyrna.html">Smyrna</A> may threaten Sevastopol, so the wary Czar must watch for them, and be prepared to defend Sevastopol, if necessary. For complete security, Russia must occupy all of Turkey or England. For either task, Fleets will be required, but two Fleets, one in the Aegean and one in the Eastern Mediterranean can hold Turkey as long as Rumania and Bulgaria are also held, so major Fleet construction in Sevastopol is rare unless Russia hopes to attack or defend Italy.
<H3>Sevastopol in the End-game</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sevastopol can be the seventeenth Center in a major stalemate-line extending from <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Cohen/Spain.html">Spain</A> and <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Lee/Marseilles.html">Marseilles</A> through Italy, Austria, the Balkans and Turkey, for Italy or another Southern Power. If <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Miller/Portugal.html">Portugal</A> is captured first, then taking Sevastopol will result in a Solo, but Sevastopol does not, as a rule, play a key-role in the endgame.
<H3>Sevastopol in Conclusion</H3>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Why Sevastopol? Well, it beats the hell out of <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Hunter/Ankara.html">Ankara</A>! &nbsp;<img src=/Zine/Common/smiley.gif>&nbsp; I will admit that the women are cuter in Ankara, though.
