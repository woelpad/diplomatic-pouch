<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ankara’s history goes back to the Bronze Age and the Hatti Civilization. The 2nd millennium BC saw the succession of the Hittites, then Phrygians in 10th century BC; Lydians and Persians followed. After these came the Galatians, a Celtic race who were the first to make Ankara their capital in the 3rd century BC. It was then known as Ancyra, which means anchor.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As time passed, the area fell to the Romans, Byzantines, and Selcuks under Alpaslan in 1073, and then to the Ottomans under Yildirim Beyazit in 1402, who remained in control through the Ankara War until the First World War.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ankara is the key to Turkey’s opening strategy. While this seems to be a climactic statement, Turkey really doesn’t have much in the way of opening choices, but the world eagerly watches Ankara’s early movements. These moves usually broadcast Turkey’s intentions and whom it considers its partner in war crimes.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Opening strategy for Ankara is very simple once you decide which way the winds of war are blowing. Moving Ank to Con is a clear signal that you have not come to an agreement with Austria and you are moving against Italy. This will give power to Austria seeking a partnership with Italy. There is always a chance that Russia will move into the Black Sea, but that is not a serious problem for Turkey. <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Ravage/Constantinople.html">Constantinople</A> to Ankara coupled with Smy/Arm to Ank leaves the home center free for the build and sets Turkey up for the westward push in Spring ’02.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The wise Sultana will attempt to convince the Russian to disband the fleet or to use the fleet to insure Russian occupation of <A HREF="/Zine/S2003M/Clouet/Rumania.html">Rumania</A>. Once you’ve committed yourself to this opening, Turkey’s expansion will not come as quickly but the bonus of reaching the Med more than makes up for the wait.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If you decide a northward push and quicker growth to defend against the ever-popular Lepanto is the way to go, then Ankara is the anchor from which Turkey will launch itself onto the continent. Even a bounce in the Black Sea allows Turkey the build of the necessary second fleet. A luxury that Russia does not have.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is my contention that Ankara is the best choice of seaport on the Black Sea, because unlike <A HREF="Sevastopol.html">Sevastopol</A>, Ankara is never a hindrance to rapid growth. In comparison, unless Russia holds the Black Sea, holding Sevastopol becomes a major obstacle in Russia’s expansion.
