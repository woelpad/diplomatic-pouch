<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What does it mean if you’re holding the Marseilles supply center? The answer is quite different depending on what country you’re leading.  Here’s a look at what you might be thinking as the leader of each power:


<H4>France:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“The game is just starting, this is good.  I like this game, England says that he’s not moving into the Channel, and Germany doesn’t appear to want to cause problems.  I’m sure they’re both lying.”

<H4>England:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“Well, France is now out of the way.  Germany still holds <A HREF="../Desper/Paris.html">Paris</A>, but it’s an inland center, and I’m England, I don’t need inland centers.  Who’s next? The back of my ‘ally’ Germany, or the weak Italian that’s holding off the thrust of Russia/Turkey?”

<H4>Germany:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“A quick move into Burgundy at the start of the game really worked out well for me.  England took some pressure off by moving into the Channel, since then I’ve taken Paris and Marseilles, and I’ve built a fleet in <A HREF="../Hood/Kiel.html">Kiel</A> to defend against the Island Witch.  Now, I can move against the English holdings in Iberia, or make a move on Scandinavia.”

<H4>Russia:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“How did I ever end up here?  I can’t believe that I’ve taken Marseilles and I still haven’t won.  Too bad I took so many losses in my home country.  Maybe I can convince Turkey to stop their move against StP…if I don’t I may find that this fleet in Marseilles is all I have left.”

<H4>Turkey:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“I am the king of the waves, all in my path shall fall!  As long as I can get out of this darn bottleneck of Gibraltar.  Italy is no longer, Austria is no longer, and my ally to the north has pushed against Germany but hasn’t moved very far.  I suppose it’s time to find the blade.”

<H4>Austria:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“I don’t know how it worked out, I have become a small naval power.  The opening moves to <I>skewer</I> Italy went very well, and Turkey and Russia went right to war.  I’ve taken my gains and built another fleet, moving via the water to the west, and with only one army, I’ve taken Marseilles.”

<H4>Italy:</H4>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">“Lepanto…he wanted me to do the Lepanto.  ‘Sure’ I said…Ah, but when the orders flew, Germany was in Burgundy, I was in Piedmont, and all was well. Now, I just need to make sure that Austria doesn’t take advantage of me, as I am the weak Italian power.”
