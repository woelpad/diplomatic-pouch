Eleven Judge Variants to Watch Out For </h2></center>
<center>
<h3>
<i>By David Norman</i></h3></center>
<hr WIDTH="100%">
<p><p>With all the
variants now available on the Judges, I thought it might be an idea if a
few of them were given some attention. So I got out the list of variants
on USTR, and started crossing them out. Removing the ones that seemed to
have died, the ones which don't look so promising, and to be honest, the
ones which I don't know enough about to want to write about. Ten seemed a good number to get it down to. So out they went. Down to fifteen, then
twelve, and then eleven. One more to go. Which would it be ? I just couldn't
pick one out of them to remove. Oh well, I thought. Change the title. Its
a lot easier.<p>So, eleven variants. Where do I start ? Well its fairly obvious really. Start with the most populour. The variant everybody knows.
The variant which has been played more often than all the others put together.
It is of course <b>Standard</b>.<p>OK, so its not really what this article
is about, but never-the-less, just think about it for a minute. It is amazing.
Forty years ago, Allan Calhamer invented Diplomacy, and as well as working
out the rules, etc, he came up with a map to play on. The Standard map. He had no experience at designing variants, and nobody elses experiences
to draw on. And yet, he came up with a map which is so good, that with forty
years of play and experience, there is still nobody who has managed to design
a variant to match it. It is still the most populour variant, and sees no
sign of being superceeded.<hr>So, if it is that good a map, why change it
? Well for the second variant, it is not changed. The only change is the
starting position. The Shift-Left and Shift-Right variants have been around
for a long time, but both have some fairly major problems. The biggest one
being England. In Shift-Right, England starts in Italy, and somehow has to get his one fleet back, through the bottleneck at the Straits of Gibralter,
and home to his island. He doesn't really stand a chance. And if that isn't
bad enough, in Shift-Left, England starts in Austria, and is even worse off.<p>So, what can be done ? Well in the <b>Shift-Around</b> variant, the
starts have been changed again. As in the others, Germany and Turkey start
in each others homelands, and in Shift-Around, Austria and France also start
in each others homes. This leaves Italy to start in England, Russia to start
in Italy, and England to start in Russia. This may sound like it has made
life for England a bit too easy. The fleet in St Petersburg is far too close
to home. However, there is one thing which makes life a lot harder for England.
The Turkish Fleet in Kiel. There is no way it is ever going to get back to Turkey, so what can it do ? Well its most useful task is to try and hold
up the English. And it turns out that even if the English know the Turkish
moves in advance, they still cannot get home in less than four years if Turkey plays to stop them. That is plenty of time for most of the other powers to get home.<hr>For our third variant, we take another variant which
has been around for quite a while, and improve on it. At some point, Jimmy
Millington and Robert Schone must have decided that one of the problems with the Standard Diplomacy board is the edges. So lets get rid of them.
How ? Well join the left edge to the right edge, and the top edge to the
bottom. A few other minor modifications were needed to make it more balenced,
and then Wraparound was born.<p>However, the variant still had one serious
flaw. The whole of the left hand edge of the Diplomacy Map is sea. The whole
of the right hand edge is land. So the Eastern powers would get to their
edge of the map, and discover that they couldn't wrap around because they
didn't have any fleets in the Western Seas. And the Western powers would
move their fleets around the edge onto the Eastern edge coasts, and then
be unable to move any further.<p>So what could be done. Well the Northern
edge of St Petersburg touches the Northern Edge of the map. However, this
is only true because of the map projection which was chosen for the Standard
map. So for <b>Wraparound 2</b>, the projection is changed so that the Barents
Sea now touches the Eastern edge of the map, and St Petersburg no longer
touches the Northern edge. Suddenly this opens up a whole new range of options.
As well as allowing fleets to sail right round the top of the map, it also
joins the two coasts of Syria, and so you can move directly from the Med
to Syria and out into the Atlantic. It also turns out that the variant is
more balenced after this change, mainly because in the original version,
Russia was too weak, due partly to the Turkish opening of A(Smy) - Syr, and then A(Syr) - StP. Now there is water in the way, Russia has a chance
to get started before it is attacked from all sides.<hr>So if the Standard
map is so good, then what do we do next ? Well lets make it bigger and better.
More provinces, more supply centres and more powers. Big is good, and bigger
is better. You could almost be mistaken for thinking that the Vincent Mous,
creator of the <b>Modern</b> variant was an American, rather than a Canadian
living in Denmark :-). The Modern variant is designed to move the Standard
map of Europe forward to the end of the twentieth century. The modern day
superpowers of Europe and its close neighbours, such as Spain, the Ukraine
and Egypt, replace the waning powers like Austria-Hungary. Now instead of
seven powers, there are ten, but to make sure there are enough supply centres
for everyone, there are 64 of them on the board, so you need 33 to win.<p>Since
its release in 1995, Modern has been played more than any other variant except Standard. The additional complexity of three extra powers and the
change in layout of the powers has made for a variant where a lot of the
powers have far more options than in the Standard game. And with so much
further to go to get the win, the game does not settle down to a predictable
mid-game and end-game nearly as often as Standard does. The variant even
has its own home page, hall of fame, and strategy articles for nine of the
ten powers (the tenth one is still waiting to be written).<hr>Having redesigned
Europe, for his next variant, Vince moved across the Atlantic for the <b>Fall
of the American Empire</b> variant (known simply as <b>Empire</b> on the
judges). The idea is simple. The political structure of North America has
broken down. Quebec has split away from Canada. The major areas of the USA,
such as California, Texas and Florida, have separated to form their own powers. And with the instability, the major powers in Central America, such
as Mexico and Peru have decided to grab their chance for expansion.<p>The
Empire variant is currently only available on the USTR judge, but is ready
for distributing onto the other judges as and when time permits, and once
there, it looks like being as big a hit as Modern. The similarities are there to see. Once again there are ten powers, and around sixty supply centres
between them. If you like the larger variants, then this is definately one
to try out now, and is my prediction for the next variant to become very
populour on the judges, once it is fully released.<hr>Of course, there is
no reason why a variant can only cover one continent, and for the <b>War
in the Americas</b> variant (known as <b>Americas</b> on the judges), Macario
Reyes has used the whole of North and South America. Set back in the 1840's,
six powers in South America, and two in the North, fight it out with the
Colonial British and Spanish.<p>The first thing to draw me towards this variant, was the layout of the Sea spaces. The coastal waters are no bigger
than a normal province. But then outside these are huge ocean spaces. On
a map of over 170 spaces, there are only 10 provinces which touch the edge
of the map. Once you get a fleet out to sea, you can get to completely the
other side of the map in just a couple of years.<p>However, to only talk
about the sea spaces would not do this variant justice. It is a very playable
variant already, and while it is still in the testing and revising stage
on USTR, it is already showing a great deal of promise for the future. Once
the playtesting and fine tuning has been completed, this should be a very
populour variant.<hr>So we've had variants on one continent, and variants
on two. Where do we go next ? It has to be the whole world. The <b>World</b>
variant by David Norman (yes, I know, I'm shamelessly plugging my own variant
here) puts seventeen powers onto a map which covers the entire globe. With
86 supply centres, and over 190 provinces, it is the largest variant available
on the judges.<p>Once again, this is a variant which is still being revised
and tested, and with test games taking so long on a variant of this size,
it is likely to be quite a while before it will be finalised. However, the
first game of the second revision is currently underway, and it is already
starting to look very promising.<p>Of course with this many players, the
game takes a lot of effort, especially in a full press game, and with the
chances of seventeen players all getting their orders in by the deadline
being pretty low, it can be fairly slow to get going until the first few
powers are eliminated. But despite this, the feedback from the players who
have played in the test games so far has been positive, and a significant
proportion of those who played in the first test games have come back to
play again.<hr>Enough of these large variants. I find it hard enough to compete against six enemies. Why would I want to compete with nine, or even
sixteen of them ? The <b>African</b> variant has just six powers. Compared
with Standard, it has several advantages. The powers are much more evenly
balenced (although one of them is still slightly weak), and because you can sail all the way around Africa, there are a lot less stalemate lines
caused by simply bottling up a large powers fleets in one half of the board
while you freely control the seas in the other half.<p>The African Variant
was created by Phil Reynolds back in 1990, and has been populour in the American Postal Hobby ever since. It is now also available on the USTR judges,
and at some point, should become available on all the judges. If you enjoy
Standard, but would prefer something where you don't get bottled up just
short of the solo quite so often, then this is definately a variant to try.<hr>Of
course, there is no reason why you have to stop at six powers. A few years
ago, Andy Schwarz observed that a lot of games end in three-way draws. One
possible explanation for this, is that people feel they have done well to
start at seven and end up in the final three, that they don't want to risk
throwing it all away going for the solo. So he had an idea. How about a variant where you already have a three-way when you start, and play from
there. People could learn to play out the endgame without having to play
the whole of the rest of the game first. And so the <b>Hundred</b> variant
was born.<p>In this variant, England, France and Burgundy fight for control
of Western Europe, around the time of the Hundred years war. With each power
starting on four or five centres, and only nine centres required for the
win, it can be a very short game, although it is not unknown for a game of Hundred to go on for 20 game years and more. <p>When it was first introduced,
the Hundred variant rapidly gained a fairly large following, and a significant
number of games were played. More recently, due mainly to Andy's reduction
in available time for Diplomacy, its popularity has waned. However, that
does not make it any less worth a go. The current version of Hundred is H31, and there is also H32 available, which is a slight variation on the
variant, intended to make England slightly stronger. Both are equally well
worth a try, and if you want to play it Face-to-Face, you can buy a copy
of the Hundred Variant, as well as a couple of others, from <a href="http://www.stupendousgames.com/">Stupendous
Games</a>.<hr>Sticking with the small variant theme, we next move to a variant
that was designed with the intention of encouraging more use of fleets and
convoying than Standard does. <b>Sail Ho!</b> places four powers onto a group of islands, each of which contains between two and six supply centres.
Some islands start with one occupying power, some with two, and some start
uninhabited. With so much sea, the need for fleet power is much more important,
but even so, the supply centres are all still on land, and so some armies
are also required for a successful game.<p>Now in just its second revision,
the Sail Ho! variant has been tested by a significant number of players playing over 80 games. Like several of the other variants mentionned, it
has its own website, its own Hall of Fame, and there is also currently a
no-press Sail Ho! tournament in progress. If you are looking for a shorter
game than Standard Diplomacy, and especially if you like playing England,
then Sail Ho! is definately recommended.<hr>Finally, we come back to a seven
player variant. The <b>South East Asia</b> variant has a bit of everything.
In the Northwest corner is the landmass of South East Asia, where China,
Thailand and Vietnam an get involved in a significant amount of land based
conflict. In the centre of the map is a mix of sea and islands, where the
island nations such as Indonesia and the Philipines fight it out in a battle
which requires a style of play very similar to Sail Ho!. And in the South
is the landmass of Australia, who have to produce the fleets they need to
sail out and join in the contest.<p>Despite the small amount of playtest
games on this variant, and the need for some rework to balence the powers
out, this is a variant that I hope and believe can go a long way if the effort is put in. The mix of geographies makes for a variant which clearly
stands out as different to almost everything else that is available, and
I hope that in the future, this will be another variant that becomes widely
played on the judges.<hr>To conclude, I would like to thank all the people
mentioned in this article, and everybody who takes the time and effort to
create variants and code them up for the judges. I would also like to appologise
to everybody who's variant was not selected for this article. Unfortunately
I don't get the chance to play all the variants on the judges, and so there
are a significant number about which I simply don't enough to write about
them.<hr>More information about the variants mentioned in this article are
