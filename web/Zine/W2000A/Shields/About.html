<p>Well, now I've seen everything! The Diplomatic Pouch has released an issue a mere 8 days late. We can only hope that this is a sign of things to come! All it takes is skipping an issue, and we seem to be back on track. I hope that you'll all find that our newest assault on journalistic standards was well worth the wait.

<p>This issue is a little smaller than the last time I edited, but I think we've got a good collection of articles none the less. We've got a little bit of everything in this issue. Openings strategy, board analysis, shameless plugs for upcoming tournaments, and yes, more letters to the editor on the convoy paradox! (And I bet -- and Manus has already told me -- they aren't the last!)

<p>So why am I editing The Pouch again? Well, Manus is busy setting up the second running of <a href="http://www.armada-dip.com/2001">The Regatta</a>, which is this year playing host to DipCon XXXIV. He's expecting you all to make it to Denver this February to attend too, so I'm sure you won't disappoint him!  (Yes, Manus, I will be there.)


<p>Well anyway, you're not hear to listen to me babble on. So,
