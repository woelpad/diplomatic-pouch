<P>
The term meta-gaming refers to a contest where players do not actually
participate in a game, but rather try to guess who among the
participants will win.  Fantasy football leagues are a common instance
of meta-gaming.  However, meta-gaming takes on a whole new scope when
applied to Diplomacy. Observers, even though they have no ability to
submit orders, still have influence over the game in their ability to
send press.  I first thought of this idea after reading Simon
Szykman's "Backseat Driver" variant in the Spring 1995 Retreat issue
of the pouch.  This variant consists of a set of players and a set of
observers.  The players each control (submit orders for) a country,
but cannot send press.  The observers submit no orders, but can send
press.  The players are not required to do what the observers tell
them.  I agree with Simon that this is the best organization.  If the
players could send press they would ignore the observers, and if the
players were bound to obey the observers they would be no more than
puppets.

<P>In the original backseat driver variant, each observer was tied to one
country, and everyone knew which country each observer represented.
The goal of the observer was the same as the goal of the player, to
have their country win.  This is where meta-diplomacy is different.
In meta-diplomacy, the observers' goals are secret, and may be in
conflict with the goals of the players.  Each observer chooses a goal,
for example, one might choose EFT 3-way draw as a goal. The observers
negotiate with each other and with the players trying to achieve their
goals.  Meanwhile, the players submit orders trying to achieve a win
for their country, but are unable to send any press, and are unsure
about the motivations of the observers who can send press.  At this
point your mind should be swimming with variations.  What sort of
goals are allowed?  How is an outcome scored for these meta-dippers?
How many observers should there be?  Could you play Payola where
observers have a small budget!?  Or even team meta-diplomacy!?!
Below, I describe just one possibility.

<P>Before the game, each observer chooses a subset of the seven
countries.  That observer's goal is to achieve a result where only
those countries are surviving.  Thus an observer can select anything
from a 7 way draw to a particular country's solo.  If an observer
chooses a draw it is necessary to choose the exact countries in the
draw, not just the number of survivors.  The game is played with the
standard rules except for press.  Observers may send partial white
press.  Players may send no press.  When the game is finished, any
conventional scoring system can be used for the players.  Observers
are scored by comparing their guesses to the actual survivors.  There
are three factors which influence a meta-dipper's score, the number of
surviving countries, S, the number of guesses made, G, and the number
of guesses that were correct, C.  The score is the correct guesses
cubed divided by the number of guesses squared times the surviving
countries.

<P>
<table>
<tr><td><td>C^3</tr>
<tr><td>score =<td>-----</tr>
<tr><td><td>G^2*S</tr>
</table>

<P>The score is always between zero and one inclusive.  Zero correct
guesses always yields a zero.  An exact guess always yields a one.
This method works fine for ranking observers within a single game.  If
the result is an RET draw one should get less points for guessing a
Russian solo than exactly guessing an RET draw.  However, one could
argue that guessing and getting a solo is harder than guessing and
getting a three way draw.  To compare different games with different
results multiply this factor by the tournament score given to the
winners of that game.

<P>I think the ideal number of observers would be seven.  I would hate to
be a player having to listen to twenty observers without even being
able to respond.  Soon after DipCon XXXIV I hope to try out
Meta-Diplomacy over the DPJudge.  If this article has piqued your
interest, keep your eyes open for forming games.

<P>SOME OTHER VARIANTS

<P>At the beginning of the game observers have no knowledge on which to
base their choice of a goal.  As an alternative, let the players send
press until the end of fall 1901.  Then the observers choose their
goals and take over the press lanes.  Of course, this might have every
observer backing whoever's in the lead.  To promote fairness for the
players, each country could be required to have at least one observer
in its corner.

<P>Guessing that England will survive and Italy will die may not require
a genius.  A Payola variant would have observers bidding for the
rights to back various countries.  The observers could bid just once
at the beginning of the game, or backing rights could be bought and
sold on a market with prices determined by current supply center
counts.  Of course, all of this bidding would be in secret.

<P>AUTO-META-DIPLOMACY

<P>If you can't scrape together fourteen players try this variant where
the seven players and the seven observers are the same people, but no
one knows which observer controls which country.  All the rules are
the same as meta-diplomacy.  In this game, the goal should be to win
the meta-game.  For example, you could bet on a solo by one of your
neighbors and try to give him your supply centers.  Of course, there's
no guarantee that he bet on himself either.
