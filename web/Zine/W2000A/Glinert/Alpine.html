<H1 align=center>The Alpine Not-So-Chicken</H1>
<H2 align=center>Italian Attacks on France</H2>
<H3 align=center><i>Steve Glinert</i></H3>
<HR>


<P>So, you're all ready for another diplomacy game. You stick your hand into
the box and draw.Italy. You mumble something about never winning, then go
over your options for 01:
<BR>
<P>1. Go and attack Austria, then watch Turkey and Russia eat you up.<BR>
2. Lepanto for the 50th time, then moan as your attack fizzles and France<BR>
sends 3 fleets into the Mediterranean.<BR>
3. Sit around and wait, hoping for an opportunity that often never comes.<BR>

<P>Tired of these options? Then perhaps you should try the Western Lepanto, or
the "Alpine-not-so-chicken".

<P>Italian attacks on France in the early game are often criticized as being
easy to defend, too obvious, and not offering any gains. Yet this is not the
case - perhaps a good France will see your attack coming, but it can be
disguised, and it can hardly be considered easy to defend. In fact, right in
fall 01, the typical Italian will have a 50% chance of delivering a knockout
punch to France. Now, let's look at some of the basic ideas and difficulties
of this system.

<P>A) The attack is obvious. Yes, you can never do an instant stab. You must
move into Piedmont before you can attack France. But in fact, any other
Italian attack, save an often-suicidal first turn stab of Austria, will be
telegraphed. And as long as France is putting himself in an awkward position
the turn you move into Piedmont, the move is still highly effective.
<P>B) This attack is easy to defend - I can't understand why this attack is so
easy to defend. Italy throws 3 units at France (1 army, 2 fleets). France
must counter with 2 fleets of his own, plus an army. Typically, that's at
least half of his forces, leaving him a juicy target for Germany and
England, who will most likely jump on the opportunity. If France doesn't get
his F Brest down south fast, he's a goner.
<P>C) Not offering any gains - Huh? A successful attack guarantees Marseilles,
Spain, and Portugal - you have a grip on these 3 (Portugal is iffy). You
will also have targets to turn towards after killing France, in England,
Germany, and Austria.

<P><h3>The Diplomacy Behind attacking France</h3>

<P>The key to this tactic that is practically a must is a Central Alliance of
Germany, AH, and Italy. Germany and AH should be allied from the start, and
most Austro-Hungarians won't mind you going west. Germany should be happy to
share in the booty of a dead France. As long as he pushes armies west, he's
doing his job. In fact, if he arranges a Sealion attack on England with
France, that works as well - F Brest heads north, so he will be at a 2-1
disadvantage in the south. If England is going to the channel, then France's
fate is completely sealed - and so are those Iberian SC's.

<P>One problem with this approach is that a smart France will see Italy and
Germany talking a lot and be tipped off. The solution? Talk through AH.
Italy and AH talking signals Lepanto, which France likes, and Germany/AH is
typical.
<BR>
<P>The Moves:<BR>
<BR>
Spring 01<BR>
<BR>
Ven-Pie<BR>
Rom-Ven<BR>
Nap-IoS<BR>

<P>This is the "nicer" version of this opening. You can still pull back from
attacking France by swinging Pie-Tyr (the Alpine Chicken). Ideally, however,
Italy has one major goal in 01: Keep Marseilles occupied. If France can get
fleets in Spain and Marseilles, the Italian attack is gone. If he cannot
build a F Mar, then Italy's 2-1 fleet advantage will tell. There is also a
nastier version, that is also far more risky:

<P>Ven-Pie<BR>
Rom-Tus<BR>
Nap-TyS<BR>

<P>This is essentially saying to France, "My goal in this game is your death".
In the fall, Tus gets convoyed to Tunis, or can follow-up into Piedmont if
Marseilles is attacked. I would prefer the previous set of orders, however,
since they reserve the option of switching plans. There is also the major
drawback that if AH plays the popular Hedgehog and heads to Venice, you've
just lost a home SC, if only temporarily.

<P>Fall 01<BR>
Assuming France is in MAO, Burgundy, and Spain (this is the most common
scenario, though English or German attacks on France could change this):

<P>This is the 50-50 scenario that will likely determine your success against
France in a
1-on-1 battle. France can either leave Marseilles open, move in with either
Bur or Spa, or self-standoff. One order will defeat 3 of these options: Pie
S Spa-Mar. There is a large risk entailed, since if France does leave
Marseilles open and sticks his fleet on Spa (sc), you can pretty much give
up on your attack, unless E/G join in the attack. Looking at it from the
French side, however, if he leaves Marseilles open and you walk in, it's
game over. So he will most likely cover himself, leaving me to recommend Pie
S Spa-Mar, but perhaps only 70% of the time (keep the French on their toes).
Take Tunis, obviously, and build F Naples. The 2nd build, if you get it, is
generally F Rome.

<P><h3>The Aftermath, and Long-Term Planning</h3>

<P>If you succeed in keeping Mar occupied, simply push your fleets in GOL and
West Med, and watch Marseilles and Spain drop right into your hands. Getting
support from Burgundy cut usually isn't too hard, just ask Germany. If there
are French fleets in Portugal and Marseilles, Western Med is yours, but that
isn't much - you need Gulf of Lyon. It will be a guessing game between MAO
and GOL vs. TyS and WeMed, but eventually you can get in, and by then it's
fairly certain one of E/G will have begun attacking France (hopefully
Germany was doing this from the start).

<P>Assuming everything went well and France was crushed like a bug, what next?
Well, you have 3 decent targets:

<P>England - if you control the MAO, and have at least 2 fleets to spare,
England is a good target. NAO, the Irish Sea, and the Channel make good
spots for fleets. You can convoy armies that have finished killing France up
through MAO (Por-MAO-NAO-Liverpool works nicely).

<P>Germany - Essentially, the idea is that you're attacking Germany as if you'
re France, but you can also come up right through Tyrolia, giving you a 2nd
angle of attack. If you're fleets are tied up, or an attack against England
would be too hard to pull off, swing those armies west and north (Burgundy
supports Tyrolia - Munich is the objective).

<P>AH - Sure, he was your buddy, and attacking him used to be silly because of
a killer R/T.but if the Eastern Triangle has sorted itself out in favour of
AH, now is often the time to strike. If you can get a F Adriatic, F Ionian,
and take Trieste, AH will often have trouble dealing with your naval
superiority. This can be highlighted with an eventual convoy into Albania,
which is usually the final nail in the coffin for AH.

<P><h3>Personal Anecdotes and No-Press</h3>

<P>I have played quite a number of games as Italy, and have attacked France 3
times. In all 3 of those games, my attacks have been successful, though 1
was marred by an ill-thought out stab of AH. In the other two, I have 1
18-SC win, and 1 two-way draw. The win involved stabbing a bloated AH after
dealing with France, while the draw was with AH, after I attacked England.

<P>This opening, in my opinion, is the ideal Italian opening in no-press. With
England and France bouncing in the channel 90% of the time, France will find
itself with the dreaded 2-1 fleet disadvantage in the Med.
