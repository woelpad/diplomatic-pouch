The Alpine Not-So-Chicken: Italian Attacks on France<BR>
<BR>
 So, you're all ready for another diplomacy game. You stick your hand into<BR>
the box and draw.Italy. You mumble something about never winning, then go<BR>
over your options for 01:<BR>
<BR>
1. Go and attack Austria, then watch Turkey and Russia eat you up.<BR>
2. Lepanto for the 50th time, then moan as your attack fizzles and France<BR>
sends 3 fleets into the Mediterranean.<BR>
3. Sit around and wait, hoping for an opportunity that often never comes.<BR>
<BR>
Tired of these options? Then perhaps you should try the Western Lepanto, or<BR>
the "Alpine-not-so-chicken".<BR>
<BR>
Italian attacks on France in the early game are often criticized as being<BR>
easy to defend, too obvious, and not offering any gains. Yet this is not the<BR>
case - perhaps a good France will see your attack coming, but it can be<BR>
disguised, and it can hardly be considered easy to defend. In fact, right in<BR>
fall 01, the typical Italian will have a 50% chance of delivering a knockout<BR>
punch to France. Now, let's look at some of the basic ideas and difficulties<BR>
of this system.<BR>
<BR>
A) The attack is obvious. Yes, you can never do an instant stab. You must<BR>
move into Piedmont before you can attack France. But in fact, any other<BR>
Italian attack, save an often-suicidal first turn stab of Austria, will be<BR>
telegraphed. And as long as France is putting himself in an awkward position<BR>
the turn you move into Piedmont, the move is still highly effective.<BR>
B) This attack is easy to defend - I can't understand why this attack is so<BR>
easy to defend. Italy throws 3 units at France (1 army, 2 fleets). France<BR>
must counter with 2 fleets of his own, plus an army. Typically, that's at<BR>
least half of his forces, leaving him a juicy target for Germany and<BR>
England, who will most likely jump on the opportunity. If France doesn't get<BR>
his F Brest down south fast, he's a goner.<BR>
C) Not offering any gains - Huh? A successful attack guarantees Marseilles,<BR>
Spain, and Portugal - you have a grip on these 3 (Portugal is iffy). You<BR>
will also have targets to turn towards after killing France, in England,<BR>
Germany, and Austria.<BR>
<BR>
The Diplomacy Behind attacking France<BR>
<BR>
The key to this tactic that is practically a must is a Central Alliance of<BR>
Germany, AH, and Italy. Germany and AH should be allied from the start, and<BR>
most Austro-Hungarians won't mind you going west. Germany should be happy to<BR>
share in the booty of a dead France. As long as he pushes armies west, he's<BR>
doing his job. In fact, if he arranges a Sealion attack on England with<BR>
France, that works as well - F Brest heads north, so he will be at a 2-1<BR>
disadvantage in the south. If England is going to the channel, then France's<BR>
fate is completely sealed - and so are those Iberian SC's.<BR>
<BR>
One problem with this approach is that a smart France will see Italy and<BR>
Germany talking a lot and be tipped off. The solution? Talk through AH.<BR>
Italy and AH talking signals Lepanto, which France likes, and Germany/AH is<BR>
typical.<BR>
<BR>
The Moves:<BR>
<BR>
Spring 01<BR>
<BR>
Ven-Pie<BR>
Rom-Ven<BR>
Nap-IoS<BR>
<BR>
This is the "nicer" version of this opening. You can still pull back from<BR>
attacking France by swinging Pie-Tyr (the Alpine Chicken). Ideally, however,<BR>
Italy has one major goal in 01: Keep Marseilles occupied. If France can get<BR>
fleets in Spain and Marseilles, the Italian attack is gone. If he cannot<BR>
build a F Mar, then Italy's 2-1 fleet advantage will tell. There is also a<BR>
nastier version, that is also far more risky:<BR>
<BR>
Ven-Pie<BR>
Rom-Tus<BR>
Nap-TyS<BR>
<BR>
This is essentially saying to France, "My goal in this game is your death".<BR>
In the fall, Tus gets convoyed to Tunis, or can follow-up into Piedmont if<BR>
Marseilles is attacked. I would prefer the previous set of orders, however,<BR>
since they reserve the option of switching plans. There is also the major<BR>
drawback that if AH plays the popular Hedgehog and heads to Venice, you've<BR>
just lost a home SC, if only temporarily.<BR>
<BR>
Fall 01<BR>
Assuming France is in MAO, Burgundy, and Spain (this is the most common<BR>
scenario, though English or German attacks on France could change this):<BR>
<BR>
This is the 50-50 scenario that will likely determine your success against<BR>
France in a<BR>
1-on-1 battle. France can either leave Marseilles open, move in with either<BR>
Bur or Spa, or self-standoff. One order will defeat 3 of these options: Pie<BR>
S Spa-Mar. There is a large risk entailed, since if France does leave<BR>
Marseilles open and sticks his fleet on Spa (sc), you can pretty much give<BR>
up on your attack, unless E/G join in the attack. Looking at it from the<BR>
French side, however, if he leaves Marseilles open and you walk in, it's<BR>
game over. So he will most likely cover himself, leaving me to recommend Pie<BR>
S Spa-Mar, but perhaps only 70% of the time (keep the French on their toes).<BR>
Take Tunis, obviously, and build F Naples. The 2nd build, if you get it, is<BR>
generally F Rome.<BR>
<BR>
The Aftermath, and Long-Term Planning<BR>
<BR>
If you succeed in keeping Mar occupied, simply push your fleets in GOL and<BR>
West Med, and watch Marseilles and Spain drop right into your hands. Getting<BR>
support from Burgundy cut usually isn't too hard, just ask Germany. If there<BR>
are French fleets in Portugal and Marseilles, Western Med is yours, but that<BR>
isn't much - you need Gulf of Lyon. It will be a guessing game between MAO<BR>
and GOL vs. TyS and WeMed, but eventually you can get in, and by then it's<BR>
fairly certain one of E/G will have begun attacking France (hopefully<BR>
Germany was doing this from the start).<BR>
<BR>
Assuming everything went well and France was crushed like a bug, what next?<BR>
Well, you have 3 decent targets:<BR>
<BR>
England - if you control the MAO, and have at least 2 fleets to spare,<BR>
England is a good target. NAO, the Irish Sea, and the Channel make good<BR>
spots for fleets. You can convoy armies that have finished killing France up<BR>
through MAO (Por-MAO-NAO-Liverpool works nicely).<BR>
<BR>
Germany - Essentially, the idea is that you're attacking Germany as if you'<BR>
re France, but you can also come up right through Tyrolia, giving you a 2nd<BR>
angle of attack. If you're fleets are tied up, or an attack against England<BR>
would be too hard to pull off, swing those armies west and north (Burgundy<BR>
supports Tyrolia - Munich is the objective).<BR>
<BR>
AH - Sure, he was your buddy, and attacking him used to be silly because of<BR>
a killer R/T.but if the Eastern Triangle has sorted itself out in favour of<BR>
AH, now is often the time to strike. If you can get a F Adriatic, F Ionian,<BR>
and take Trieste, AH will often have trouble dealing with your naval<BR>
superiority. This can be highlighted with an eventual convoy into Albania,<BR>
which is usually the final nail in the coffin for AH.<BR>
<BR>
Personal Anecdotes and No-Press<BR>
<BR>
I have played quite a number of games as Italy, and have attacked France 3<BR>
times. In all 3 of those games, my attacks have been successful, though 1<BR>
was marred by an ill-thought out stab of AH. In the other two, I have 1<BR>
18-SC win, and 1 two-way draw. The win involved stabbing a bloated AH after<BR>
dealing with France, while the draw was with AH, after I attacked England.<BR>
<BR>
This opening, in my opinion, is the ideal Italian opening in no-press. With<BR>
England and France bouncing in the channel 90% of the time, France will find<BR>
itself with the dreaded 2-1 fleet disadvantage in the Med.<BR>
<BR>
