   Matt,

   Attached are two files.  The large one is the main body of the text, while
   the smaller one is a list of the games used in the study.  A link should
   be created from the main text to this list at the place indicated in the
   text.  I have also indicated in the text places where I would like links
   to various other sites; I believe I have all the URLs correct.  The link
   should be on the word or phrase immediately before the URL.

   Also, there are a number of tables in the text.  After each table is a
   table legend describing the table.  I'd like the legends clearly offset
   from the main text and associated with the table, so that everything makes
   sense to the reader.  (I'm sure this will be obvious to you.)

   Finally, I did not give the article a title in the file.  The article is
   called "A Study of Italian Wins on the Judges".  Not very exciting; if you
   can think of a better title let me know.

   If anything is not clear about the article or you need any other
   information just let me know.

   Thanks, and good luck with the Pouch issue.
