Boardman and Miller Numbers

<P>
I was recently asked to put together a piece about my recent
appointment as
both the E-Mail Miller Number Custodian (MNC) and Internet Boardman
Number
Custodian (BNC). Since I still haven't put together an article, I
decided to do
the next best thing:  clone!  One of advantages of being the only
person left
with a copy of the EP archives on one's computer is the ability
to pull old
articles out of a hat!
<P>
The <a href="Bnumbers.html">first article</a>, discussing Boardman
Numbers (BN's), is taken
from Issue 176
of Eric Klien's <I>Electronic Protocol, Chapter 6</i>, July 1990.  Eric
took it from
another zine, which I think is now defunct.  From the article
itself, it
appears it was originally written 25 years ago, in 1972!
A couple of notes on the this article:
<P>
<ol><li><i>Graustark</i> is still going, according to the Winter
<i>1994 Diplomacy World</i>. Subscriptions are available from John Boardman,
234 East 19th, Brooklyn NY, USA, 11226. $10 for issues.
<li>
The present BNC is Vince Lutterbie, 1021 Stonehaven, Marshall
MO, USA, 65340.  Vince publishes details of all this games, in
the 'zine <i>Everything</i>, which is now passed on from one BNC to the
next.  He dishes out Boardman Numbers for all postal games in
North America, and he also hands out blocks of BN's to foreign BNC's
so that the BNC's in North America, Europe, and Australia all use
unique numbers.
<li>
Recently, as an experiment, Vince allowed me to start giving out
BN's to Internet games.  He gave me blocks of BNs, from KA-LZ,
PA-QZ and TA-UZ:  156 numbers.  Initially, I hoped this would
last us all of 1994, but near the end of Feb, we had already
gotten up to 1994LF -- 1/5 of our numbers, with only 1/6 of the
year gone.  At this rate I would have to get 52 numbers from Vince
to finish the year!  I was also to be assigning numbers for 1988-1993
games using data in the Hall of Fame.  The 1988, 1989, and half
of the 1990 games that were part of EP were given BN's at the
time, directly from the BNC.
</ol>
<P>
The <A href="Mnumbers.html">second article</a> is a little more recent,
and discusses Miller Numbers.  It
is taken (most recently) from Issue 72 of <i>Electronic Protocol</i>
(no chapter numbers back then), in June 1989.  Of course, Eric took it from
somone else
too, so it's probably a little older.  Incidentally, the present
MNC, is Lee
Kendter, Jr.  I believe that Lee Kendter, Sr (the author of the
second article), was a former MNC,
and may have
been the MNC when this article was first written.
A couple of notes on the second article:
<ol><li>From what I understand, Miller Numbers are named after the late
Don Miller,
and also date back to the 1960's.  A lot more information about
Miller
Numbers and Don Miller can be found in Mark Nelson's excellent
interview
with Fred Davis Jr., which is available by FTP at
<a href="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents">
ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents</a>.
<li>
The current MNC, Lee Kendter Jr, appointed me E-mail MNC late
last year, and
gave us a block of numbers, from AAA to AZZ.  Last year, so far,
I had given out all numbers up to AGW.  I will also be going
back to 1990-1992 games.  Part of the deal with Lee is that I will be
publishing
the game
details, (including postal publishing -- you know, ink, paper and sealing
wax), however
at this point, I haven't gotten around to it.  Hopefully soon
I will have a
crack at throwing something together.  Unlike the BNC, I also
can give out
MN's to non-Internet games (like AOL, Compu$erve, Genie, etc.),
however, to date,
no-one has contacted me, and my attempts at contact have not gotten
too far.
