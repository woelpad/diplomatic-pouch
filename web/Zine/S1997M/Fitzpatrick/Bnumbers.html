The first postal Diplomacy game began in 1963 under John Boardman,
the editor of <i>Graustark</i>.  Even in those early days, Gamesmaster
Boardman set standards for the reporting of his game which would
put some American Gamesmasters to shame now, nine years later.
This first game was for a short time the only postal game in
the world, so there was no need to differentiate it from any others.
In <i>Graustark</i> #11, however, John announced that a second game
was under way, being run by Dave McDaniel in <i>Ruritania</i>.  In so
doing, John took a step for which, as we will see, there was no
need, and yet, as we will also see, was extraordinarily foresighted.
<P>
John declared that he would number postal games on the same basis
as new comets are numbered: the year of sighting plus an alphabetical
designator. In this case, he would use the year of beginning.
Thus the <i>Graustark</i> game was 1963A, and the <i>Ruritania</i> game was
1963B.  It is that declaration, on 23 October 1963, which laid
the basis for the Boardman Numbers, still in use more than 8 years
later.
<P>
Why do I say that there was no need for this system?  The early
concept of postal Diplomacy was one of quite limited numbers of
people being involved. Boardman had in fact not been able to obtain
7 players for his own game and had begun a five-man game under the
then-current rules.  For some time, <i>Graustark</i> could publish complete
address lists for all postal players and rather complete reviews
of completed games, since there were only a few dozen of the former
and a handful of the latter. Therefore, anyone who was interested
could subscribe to all of the very few postal 'zines then published
and follow the games directly without any strain.  Furthermore,
the earliest concept of a postal 'zine was that it would carry
only one game.  For instance, when Boardman opened a game while
a game was still active in <i>Graustark</i> he also started a new 'zine
for it, <i>Fredonia</i>.  It was thus possible to speak of &quot;the
<i>Graustark</i> game&quot;, &quot;the <i>Witdip</i> game&quot;,
&quot;the <i>Trantor</i>
game&quot; and so on, with perfect clarity. Everybody would know
what you meant.
<P>
Neither of these two situations remained true for very long. Within
a few years, postal Diplomacy underwent a rapid expansion.  Very
few games began in 1963 or 1964, but in 1965 the Boardman numbers
reached 1965W, and in 1966 they reached 1966BP (starting from
&quot;A&quot; each year, of course), and in 1968 we reached 1968CX.
This was the record until 1971, which reached 1971EK. (1971EN
because of games discovered in early 1972 as having begun in 1971.
LWL)  As the games increased, so did the number of people playing
them, so that it was no longer an easy matter to keep track of
games or players, as it had been in 1963 or 1964 or even 1965.
<P>
Furthermore, the single-game 'zine died almost as soon as it was
born. Game 1963A ended after 6 game-years, and Boardman organized
a new 7-man game. It began exactly when 1963A ended.  (Note: It
began in 1963, but is 1964A, since Boardman assigned numbers on
the basis of Spring 1901 deadline date. This policy was later
changed, so that the date of the game's announcement is now used
as the criterion as to what year the game begins).  But John did
not start a new 'zine. The new game ran in <i>Graustark</i>, so that
there were now *two* &quot; <i>Graustark</i> games,&quot; the old one
and the new one.  Then in the fall of 1964, Charles G. Brannan
of Los Angeles *really* upset the applecart by bringing out <i>Wild
'n Wooly</i>. <i>WNW</i> would have not one game, or a series of games one
after the other, but several games at once!  It would not be possible
to speak of &quot;the <i>Wild 'n Wooly</i> game&quot; with any precision.
The need for the Boardman Numbers quickly then became manifest.
<P>
As a side note, Dan Brannan himself had a scheme for numbering
games. He proposed the same scheme idea as Boardman's, but having
a unique alphabetical designator for the 'zine involved, followed
by a designator for the game given in order the game begins in
the 'zine.  Aside from the obvious clumsiness of this, it presupposes
there will be no more than 26 'zines, and there are more than
twice that number now.
<P>
As the number of games rose, <i>Graustark</i> had a problem.  If the
'zine went over an ounce, it would become too expensive to maintain.
Even though it appeared every two weeks, the 'zine still did
not have enough room to contain the new listings, changes, and
the completed game resumes which would ultimately arise.  Eventually
John felt it necessary to ask someone else to take over the obligations
of the Boardman Numbers.
<P>
In September 1967, Charles Wells became the second custodian of
the Boardman Numbers, publishing the relevant data in his excellent
(but unfortunately now defunct) gamezine <i>Lonely Mountain</i>.  It
was under Charles that the Numbers achieved very nearly their
present format. Charles instituted two important improvements.
First, he no longer listed games which obviously were not regular
games.  Team games (where several countries were in permanent
alliance--usually two teams of 3, with or without the 7th power
played independently) were the rage in 1965-66, and received Boardman
Numbers.  With the institution of Miller Numbers for variant games,
there was no further need for this.  Secondly, Charles instituted
the use of a prefix (#) to denote games which, while more or less
regular in appearance, were in fact not quite so. Thus, my #1970E,
for instance, is a five-man game instead of a seven-man game, #1970BQ
was a &quot;local&quot; or &quot;telephone&quot; game (in this
case, with deadlines seven days or less apart), and so on.
<P>
In March 1968, Charles transferred the Numbers to John Koning
of <i>sTab</i>. John published them, much as Charles had, for a little
more than a year, until July of 1969.  Scheduling difficulties then
caused a lapse in John's publishing.
<P>
In October 1969, when <i>sTab</i> had not appeared for three months,
I called John and asked him if he would like me to take up the
job of the Numbers.  He said that he did, and I have assigned
them for a little more than 2 years.
<P>
The Numbers appeared (and still appear) in <i>Numenor</i>.  That was
intended to be a gamezine as well, but soon got so huge as to
be unmanageable. It was broken up, and the <i>Numenor</i> segment now
contains the Numbers and related data, plus other statistical
things as there is room.
<P>
Thus, from a little idea involving only 2 games, the Boardman
Numbers have grown to a project requiring the facilities of an
entire magazine. In the process of administering the numbers,
I have noted the following policies carried over from previous
custodians, and which I continue to follow:
<ol>
<li>
The Boardman Numbers are not connected with any organization;
they are an independent entity.
<li>Boardman Numbers are assigned to all postal Diplomacy games
which use the GRI [<i>Games Research, which owned Diplomacy, before
Avalon Hill - Nick</i>] board and rules and which are not manifestly
and obviously variant games.
<li>There is no connection between the Numbers and the criteria
established for any rating system.  (In the specific context,
my own.  Numbers are assigned to a great many games which I won't
include in my ratings.)
<li>The Boardman Numbers are the sole responsibility of the custodian,
acting on behalf of postal Diplomacy generally.  If he is unable
to discharge that responsibility, he must make suitable arrangements
for the transfer of the Numbers to a new custodian.
</ol>
<P>
And that's it.  See what happens when you ask for a &quot;short
note&quot;?<BR>
