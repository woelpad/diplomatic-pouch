The Miller Number Custodian (or MNC) assigns numbers to variant
games of postal Diplomacy such like the BNC assigns numbers to
regular games of postal Diplomacy.  The Miller Numbers themselves
are different as they do more than just annually alphabetize the
games.  The most often asked question I get is, &quot;What does
that funny-looking number mean?&quot;.  Let's look at a typical
MN, 1985Zrb32.  The first part, 1985Z is the same as a BN in that
it tells you that this is the 26th (Z) game assigned a number
for 1985.  The rb32 also tells you that this is a game of &quot;Gunboat&quot;
or no-negotiation Diplomacy.  Where does that come from and what
does it mean?  This &quot;designator&quot; was developed by the
North American Variant Bank (NAVB) and adopted by the MNC in 1981.
The former system for classifying variants had become stale and
unworkable.  The rb means that is uses the Regular Board and the
32 indicates that it is the 32nd such variant on file.<BR>
<P>
All variants are classified under their own specific type in the
NAVB catalog.  The rb category is just one of many types of variants
on file.  The simpler ones may involve just a few rules changes
or the addition of a few new spaces and/or centers to the regular
board.  Others involve extensions to the board, more or fewer
players, entire new boards, many pages of rules changes, and time
periods farther in the past or even in the future.<BR>
<P>
The MNC also keeps a permanent record of all variant games that
have been assigned numbers and records of games that have concluded.
These are published periodically in the MNC zine, <i>Alpha &amp;
Omega</i> (<i>A&amp;O</i>).<BR>
<P>
The MNC works closely with the BNC as the BNC sometimes gets a
request for a game that deviates from the norm.  When these cases
occur the BNC sometimes has to consult with the MNC and together
they decide whether the game is different enough to receive a
MN instead of a BN.<BR>
<P>
Some players think that variants are more interesting than the
regular game and play them almost exclusively.  Others play a
variant on occasion just for the different strategy involved.
<BR>
<P>
So when you're ready for your first variant game remember where
the funny-looking number came from.<BR>
