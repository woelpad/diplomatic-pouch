<P>
While perusing the on-line strategy articles, I could not help
but notice that there were no less than three articles applying
Sun-Tzu's <i>Art of War</i> to Diplomacy, but there was a distinct
lack of Clausewitz's teachings on the subject.  I thought this
a bit odd, since Clausewitz's <i>On War</i> is generally considered
to be the most conclusive and influential work ever written on
the subject of armed conflict.  This is not to say that Sun-Tzu
does not have his uses - for one thing, he is highly  quotable,
and thus is very popular with people seeking pithy phrases to
throw about.  Clausewitz's importance, on the other hand, arises
from the very fact that his analysis is too detailed and complete
to be reduced to simple sequence of rules or principles.  Keeping
this in mind, I have decided to compile a series of eight articles,
each focusing on one book of <i>On War</i>, which will seek to apply
Clausewitz's analysis to the art of war in Diplomacy.
