	The natural sequel to our discussion of defense, this article will
deal with the several aspects of the strategic attack.  As usual, we will
start by defining the purpose and nature of the attack.  
	As we discussed in Article III, defense is not an absoulate state
of waiting and repulse, but is rather permeated with elements of the
offensive.  In the same way, the attack is continually combined with
defense.  The essential difference is that one cannot conceive of defense
without its necessary element of counter-attack.  In contrast, the
offensive action is complete in itself.  However, there are two
considerations which commonly bring defensive acts into an offensive plan:
<P>
<center><i>1. '...An attack cannot be completed in a single steady movement: periods
    of rest are needed, during which the attack is neutralized, and
    defense takes over automatically.'</i></center>
<P>
	This consideration is the most common reason for offensive Dip
players reverting to periodic defensive roles.  In most conflicts,
especially early in the game, the offensive players are simply not capable
of eliminating their opponents in one fluid attack, and must therefore
periodically consolidate and defend their gains while waiting for
reinforcements or gains in other theaters.  Consider the early-game E/G
alliance for the purposes of partitioning France.  As France collapses,
she naturally folds into a more compact and defensible position, while the
front line is simultaneously pushed further and further from the home
centers of England and Germany.  As any player who has attempted this
invasion should know, this attack cannot be completed in one fluid
motion, and England and Germany will constantly find themselves pausing to
consolidate their gains, prevent French sneak runs around England, and
desperately pray for Italian intervention.
<P>
<center><i>2. '...The area left in the rear of the advancing forces, an area vital to
    their existence, is not necessarily covered by the attack, and needs
    special protection.'</i></center>
<P>
	Maintaining control of supply centers is a vital concern for all
Powers.  A successful offensive usually serves to carry one's units away
from the home centers which ultimatels support them, and most Dip players
tend to view undefended centers as fair game.  Therefore, some care must
be taken to protect your backfield as you advance, a concern which can tie
up a large percentage of the builds gained from the advance.  Obviously,
some offensive plans yield better returns with less over-extension and
vice-versa, so it is very important to remember that as soon as the
objective has been attained the attack ends and the defense takes over, so
every attack has to take into account the defense which is inherent in it.
<P>

<center><i>'The diminishing force of the attack is one of the strategist's main
concerns.  His awareness of it will determine the accuracy of his estimate
in each case of the options open to him.'</i></center>
<P>
	There are several considerations which can cause the attacker to
lose force during the execution of an invasion, each of which must be
understood and planned for:
<P>
<center><i>1. 'If the object of the attack is to occupy the enemy's country.' 
</i></center><P>
	As our units invest the enemy's territory, they necessarily take
on the additional role of defending that territory as our own.  This need
can weaken our offensive effort as more and more units are needed for
defensive purposes.  For an example, let's use the common Turkish
invasion of Austria - as Turkish forces drive deeper into the Balkans and
Austria proper, those forces find that more and more of their effort is
directed toward protecting these conquest from counter-attack, as well as
from Russian or Italian opportunism.  Reinforcements from builds gained
can help to offset this trend, but their effectiveness is blunted by two
other concerns which also increase with the success of the attack -
length of distance to the front, and the need to protect home centers.
<P>
<center><i>2. 'By the invading armies' need to occupy the area in their rear so as
    to...exploit its resources.'</i></center>
<P>
	This subject has already been largely covered above, but it must
be recognized as a major cause of diminishing force in an attack.  To
continue with our example above, Turkey has little need for extensive
defensive units at the start of her attack, as the front will be so close
that the attacking units themselves serve a defensive role by their very
presence.  As the front advances, however, some new units will have to be
reserved for purely defensive purposes, as otherwise the home centers
will be open for Russian or Italian attacks of convenience.
<P>
<center><i>3. 'By the distance from the source of replacements.'</i></center>
<P>
	As the front line advances further and further from the home
centers, there is an ever-increasing time lag between a new unit's
construction and the point at which it can participate meaningfully in
the fight.  Thus, countries whose home centers are closer the action
(nominally, the defenders) are able to react more quickly and
appropriately to changing conditions than can countries further from the
action (nominally, the attackers).  Thus, as Turkey plows through the
Austrian homelands and picks his next opponent, that opponent will be
better able to deploy his own builds in response.  If Germany is next on
the list, then German builds can be placed and maneuvered to the front
much faster that Turkish ones, and therefore can take advantage of better
knowledge of the conditions that will prevail when they arrive, and can
influence the decision far sooner than can any Turkish reinforcements.
<P>
<center><i>4. 'By sieges and the investment of fortresses.'</i></center>
	<P>
	Strongly defended points, stalemate lines, and hold-fast lines
all represent points which are costly and difficult to break or bypass.
To muster enough units at the proper points to deal with them is often
time-consuming and almost always requires a significant portion of the
entire offensive forces.  As a result, the general effect of these
positions is to slow down and diminish the force of the attack.
Understanding how these positions are developed can help an offensive
player to plan for them, and in the best case to prevent them from
developing in the first place.
<P>
<center><i>5. 'By a relaxation of effort.'</i></center>
<P>
	It is a normal state of affairs in Dip that a Power's concerns at
the start of an offensive are not the same concerns he has several years
into it.  As a result, once again, the offensive force is diminished.
Consider Turkey has driven Austria back from Greece and Serbia, and has
more than sufficient forces on hand to complete the destruction of the
Austrian player.  By this time, however, the Turk may well have need to
be concerned over the intentions of the Russians and/or the Italians.
Should he decide that Russia needs dealing with, then that will
necessarily require a committment of considerable force to the Russian
border, force which is most likely to be largely or even wholly drawn
from the Austrian campaign.  This represents a relaxation of effort in
relation to the Austrian invasion, and can weaken an offensive to the
point of stalling or even inviting a counter-attack.
<P>
<center><i>6. 'By the defection of allies.'</i></center>
<P>
	The longer that an offensive war drags on, or the more successful
that one particular power is in gaining from that war, then the more
likely it becomes that his allies will desert him, either turning
directly against him or seeking to make gains elsewhere on the board.
This illustrates the fact that an attacker has no true allies - he may
have partners willing to aid in an invasion, but the bonds of alliance
lose strength in direct proportion to the gains made by the senior
partner.  The stronger a Power becomes, the more likely it is to become
the target of an alliance than to be offered alliance himself.  
<P>

	The final matter to be discussed is the use of diversions, or
attacks upon enemy territory with the intention of drawing his forces away 
from the main objective.  In such a diversion, there must be an objective
to attack - and only the value of this objective can induce the enemy to
expend his force in protecting it.  Diversion can be highly useful in
weakening the defense around the main objective, but care must be taken
not to withdraw too many units from the main scene of operations.  The
main concern must be that the enemy must withdraw more units from the main
objective than are used for the diversion.  Several factors can make the
decision to mount a diversion favorable: 
<P>
<center><i>1. 'Forces that the attacker can make available without detracting from
    from his main offensive.'  </i></center>
<P>
	If France is attacking England for the purpose of claiming Holland
and Belgium, then France may freely dispatch a fleet to the North Atlantic
or Irish Sea for the purpose of harrassment of the English Isles, since
the fleet is of more use there, and would actually contribute less if it
were to support the main theatre.
<P>
<center><i>2. 'Vulnerable objectives of great importance to the enemy.'
</i></center><P>
	Again, assuming England has left his island relatively undefended,
then this is definitely a vulnerable objective which the English can ill
afford to lose.
<P>
<center><i>3. 'An area rich enough to yield substantial war material.'
</i></center><P>
	A diversion mounted at Tunis is of little use unless it is
completely undefended, since it requires a substantial investment of force
for relatively little gain.  On the other hand, one aimed at the Balkans
can yield a high number of supply centers, and so is generally a good
investment - the enemy must either commit a large number of units to
defending them, or risk losing a region extremely blessed with supply
centers.  Either way, the diversion has succeeded.

<P>
	Thus ends this article on the Attack - a few more points will
suffice to sum up what we have covered.  Defense is the stronger form of
war - thus, if an attack lacks material superiority, it must have moral
superiority; where even moral superiority is lacking, there is no point in
attacking at all.  Prudence is the true spirit of defense, courage and
confidence the true spirit of the attack - neither form can do without
both qualities, but each has a natural affinity with one of them.  The
goal of the defender is to delay or avoid a decisive battle, the
attacker's is to bring such a battle about.  An attacker bent on a major
decision has no reason to divide his forces - he should advance on no
wider a front than allows him to bring all of his forces to bear
simultaneously.  The only exception to this is if the defender himself is
divided, in which case minor diversions can be put to good advantage.  And
finally, as always, we shall end with the most important lesson of all, in
Clausewitz's own words:
<P>
<center><i>'One thing, however, is sure, and fundamental to the issue: it is a risky
business to attack an able opponent in a good position.'
</i></center>
