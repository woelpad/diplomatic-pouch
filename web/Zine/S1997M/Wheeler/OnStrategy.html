<CENTER><I>'Strategy decides the time when, the place where, and
the forces with which the engagement is to be fought.'<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Here are all of the issues with which we need to concern ourselves
when planning strategy.  It must be remembered that all wars have
a political goal, and thus our strategic planning is the act of
deciding how to plan engagements which help us to achieve our
goal.  In this light, let us examine the case of a French player
in Spring 1902. His first step, of course, is to define his goals.
Suppose this has been done, and they are found to be 1) Protect
French control over France and Iberia and 2) To establish a route
of expansion through the Mediterranean.   France's available forces
are F Mars, F Brest, F Portugal, A Spain, A Burgundy.  If the
French player merely moves forces into the Mediterranean theater
and allows himself to fight sprawling battles wherever the Italian
presents himself, he has not done his job.  The whole advance
should be planned with the end of achieving his goals kept in
mind, and each engagement should be planned to help achieve those
goals.  Thus, France's next logical step might be to decide the
F Brest and A Burgundy are best used defensively to protect France
and Iberia - how best to accomplish this will be determined by
the specific conditions of the game.  Additionally, he may realize
that the best way to achieve his second goal is to engage the
Italian at the Tyrrhenian Sea with A Spain, F Portugal, and F
Marseilles.  Furthermore, he may realize that his best chance
for success lies in not forcing this engagement until 1903, when
all appropriate forces may be employed. Thus, a reasonable set
of moves would be A Spain -&gt; Marseilles, F Marseilles -&gt;
Gulf of Lyon, F Portugal -&gt; MAO.  Since these moves are not
patently anti-Italian, and may be passed off as preparations against
England, France has committed nothing but still progressed well
on the accomplishment of his goals.  Merely by deciding where,
when, and with what to fight France is thus able to increase his
chances for ultimate success.<BR>
<P><br>
<CENTER><I>'Possible engagements are to be regarded as real ones
because of their consequences.'<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Imposing our will on the enemy does not always require battle,
but it is always based on the presumption that, should battle
come, we would win.  Hence, England may convince Russia not to
build northern fleets not by taking Sweden or StP, but merely
by having the capability to do so if balked.  Thus, the goal has
been achieved just as though the battle had actually occurred.
<BR>
<P><br>
<CENTER><I>'If we do not learn to regard a war, and the seperate
campaigns of which it is composed, as a chain of linked engagements
each leading to the next, but instead succumb to the idea that
the capture of...undefended provinces are of value in themselves...we
ignore the possibility that their possession may later lead to
definite disadvantages.'<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Often, players are far more concerned with taking supply centers
than is good for them.  Until a Power is within striking distance
of winning the game, SC acquisition should make a distant secondary
concern to the real issues - staying alive and maintaining a route
of expansion. Indeed, a rashly taken province often turns out
to be more a liability than an asset, one fact too often forgotten.
Is it truly an advantage for Germany to grab Warsaw at the earliest
possible opportunity?  Given the initial startup, it is quite
possible for the German player to achieve this objective, by say
A Berlin -&gt; Prussia, A Munich -&gt; Silesia.  However, such
a strategy violates both of the general concerns of the starting
Power - it does not open a profitable line of expansion, and it
leaves Germany open to assault from the west.  Given the Russian's
likely response, the necessary expenditure of forces to keep Warsaw
would, in all likelihood, present England and/or France with just
too good an opportunity to slice up poor Germany.  <BR>
<P><br>
<CENTER><I>'Given the same amount of intelligence, timidity will
do a thousand times more damage than audacity.'<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
The bold player enjoys all of the advantages in an evenly matched
fight - the possibility of surprise, the initiative, and the ability
to gain at the other's expense.  This is not to say that you should
rashly rush in and attack without thought - such a simplistic
strategy can never work against an opponent better prepared and
more careful in his planning. The message is simply that, all
things being equal, it is better to fight on the enemy's territory
than your own.  Let us use the example of the Italian - the Italian's
primary concern in the early stages of the game is to prevent
any foreign power from projecting their naval force into the Mediterranean.
This cause is best served not be staking claim to Tunis and using
your (now) two fleets to carefully barricade yourself across the
Tyrrhenian and Ionian seas.  Such a plan is doomed to failure,
since someone will eventually venture your way, and it only takes
one lucky move for them to start taking you apart.  Rather, Italy
MUST take hold of her own destiny, and take the battle to whichever
power is mostly likely to threaten her first (usually Turkey or
France).  By taking the war to the opponent, any territory which
changes hands will probably be in your favor.  Also, most Dip
players don't really like fighting unpredictable and bold opponents,
and often make more mistakes when forced to.<BR>
<P><br>
<CENTER><I>'To achieve strength at the decisive point depends
on the strength of the army and on the skill with which this strength
is deployed.'<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
This point has two important rules which accompany it.  The first
rule is: put the largest possible army into the field.  Superiority
of numbers IS important.  The second rule is: know the decisive
point.  Since it is not always possible to know where the decisive
point in a struggle will be, always attempt to maintain the initiative
so that YOU can dictate the location of decisive battles.  Neither
of these rules is sufficient, which is good because neither is
very profound.  They only take on importance when coupled with
the immediate goal - being strong where needed.  It is not enough
for Russia to have more units than any of her potential opponents
- she must have more units facing each of her actual opponents.
If the point of decision is in the south, then every unit in
the north is not contribiting to the decision, and Russia may
find herself absolutely superior, but locally inferior.  Such
situations can be tragic.<BR>
<P><br>
<CENTER><I>'The forces available must be employed with such skill
that even in the absence of absolute superiority, relative superiority
is attained at the decisive point.'<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Here we are again with the decisive point.  This time, let's look
at the same example from Turkey's point of view.  Assuming an
'average' 1901 haul, let's say Turkey has four SCs, Russia six.
In a struggle between the two, Sevastopol and the surrounding
provinces are the point of decision.  Despite Turkey's overall
inferiority, he may well manage to exert local superiority, especially
if the Russian must commit an unusually large force to its north.
Turkey can usually count on getting a second fleet first, which
assures control of the Black Sea.  Furthermore, if Rumania is
Russian, then an equivalent force of three units may be brought
to bear on either Rumania or Sevastopol, since breaking support
to a province is equivalent to supporting an attack into it.
If the Russian is sorely pressed in the north, this should constitute
a local superiority - otherwise the goal is unreasonable and the
battle probably should not have been undertaken in the first place.
<BR>
<P><br>
<CENTER><I>'The two factors that produce surprise are secrecy
and speed.'<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Both elements are crucial, yet all too often only secrecy is acknowledged.
This rule can be used to seperate the 'good stab' from the 'bad
stab'.  Both are undertaken in secrecy - the distinguishing point
is speed.  The 'bad stab' incurs the wrath of another Power by
taking one or more of his SCs by unexpected moves - what makes
it bad is that the other Power is still around to exact revenge.
A 'good stab' will never exact the revenge of the stabee, because
he will no longer exist in a powerful enough state to make good
on his revenge.  Prefereably, he will no longer exist at all.
Whenever considering a stab of your partner, ask yourself one
question: Can I be effectively counter-attacked after this?  If
the answer is yes, then it is not a good stab.  There are three
expected results which can make a stab 'good'.  They are, in order
of preference 1)Victory - the stab will give you 18 centers; 2)
Elimination - the stabee will be dead; 3) Domination - the stabee
will be reduced to an ineffectual power.  Anything less than this
and you are inviting retaliation.<BR>
<P><br>
<CENTER><I>'Only the commander who imposes his will can take the
enemy by surprise.'<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
If the enemy decides where each battle will be, you cannot surprise
him.  Only the player with a positive aim can surprise his opponent.
Put another way, a France who allows England to take MAO and
English Channel cannot take England by surprise, for England has
command of the area, and may dictate when and with what battles
will be fought.<BR>
<P><br>
<CENTER><I>'Strategic feints rarely have the desired effect.'
<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
Forces deployed far from your intended opponent for appearance's
sake are in danger of finding themselves unable to contribute
to the battle.  An unused unit is worse than one used improperly.
A Russia who believes the crucial point to be the Balkans should
never send A Moscow to StP to simulate war with England.  The
danger is far too great that Turkey and Austria will sieze the
opportunity to crack a Russia playing one unit short.  Strategic
feints only work if the feinting unit can still strike into the
intended theater of operations.  Hence, Italy may feint against
Austria to strike at Turkey, since the feint itself brings Italy's
units into range.<BR>
<P><br>
<CENTER><I>'All forces intended and available for a strategic
purpose should be applied simulatenously.'<BR>
</I></CENTER>
<P>
This serves as an excellent point with which to sum up this chapter.
If you're going to hit somebody, hit them fast, hard, and well.
Don't hold back troops, don't engage one unit at a time - your
goal is to end the war as quickly as possible.  The longer you
stay deadlocked with an opponent, the bigger the window of opportunity
for someone else to gain at your expense.<BR>
