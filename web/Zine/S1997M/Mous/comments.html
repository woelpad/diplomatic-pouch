<B>Comments on General Strategy/Direction for Italy in Modern
<BR>
</B>
<P>
&quot;A linchpin of Italy's play (indeed any nation's play) must
be to generate 'safe centres', supply centres which don't need
to be defended, freeing up units to create a strong attacking
force elsewhere. Without easy access to corners or board edges
this is difficult for Italy but one route towards this is to get
control of the TYS and the Ionian Sea and the GoL?), and to keep
non-Italian fleets out of the Adriatic. Then most of Italy consists
of safe centres, and Monaco, Marseilles, Croatia and Serbia could
later become so as well). It's not easy though.&quot; - Toby Tyrrell
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Italy should head east East EAST!!!&quot; - Stephen Breininger
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Initially, grab as many neutral SC's in the east and hold
them, ally with the north, and push west.&quot; - Chris Fridrich
<BR>
<P>
&quot;(Italy should) Primarily go east. Italy tends to grow quickly
but, once the easily taken SCs are gone, Italy has to break out
of the Med or be stifled while other powres outgain her. The only
real possibilities are a land war to the east or a sea war to
the west. Of the two, the land war is easier to pursue given the
difficulties getting around the Iberian peninsula with any significant
force.&quot; - Pitt Crandlemire<BR>
<P>
&quot;Head northeast. It's where you can get the most dots.&quot;
- Alexander K. Woo<BR>
<P>
&quot;Italy should not go North. Italy should either go East or
West. Probably East. It would be very desirable to make an alliance
with either Turkey or Egypt to carve up the other. Since Egypt
is unlikely to want Italy getting that much, the I/T alliance
looks better. Turkey can let Italy take the Egyptian provinces
in return for Israel, Saudi Arabia, Iran, etc. As long as Italy
does not get a fleet through Cairo, this should be pretty secure
for Turkey. Of course, in practice, the I/T/E triple usually resolves
itself with one of the three dominating.<BR>
<P>
Going West? Spain is too far away. France is closer, but Lyon,
Paris, are too far North. Besides, France is such a wimp why worry?&quot;
- Rick Desper<BR>
<P>
&quot;Go west initially, while establishing herself in the Balkans.
If Germany is weak, go north. Otherwise, take out Spain, then
France or Britain in the west, while working with Germany in the
east.&quot; - Ian York<BR>
<P>
&quot;My feeling is that it is a balancing act in the early to
mid-game, grabbing SC's on whatever front you can, and that the
best long-range results are achieved by eventually holding the
Balkans and working north through Germany and Poland.&quot; -

<B>Comments on Italy and the Land Power/Naval Power Question in
Modern<BR>
</B>
<P>
&quot;(Italy should be a) Land power if possible, naval if necessary.
The Modern variant has a higher proportion of landlocked SCs than
Standard, and there are already lots of naval powers in the Med.&quot;
- Alexander K. Woo<BR>
<P>
&quot;At first, your armies should number just enough to protect
yourself. A large Navy will be necessary for you to gain a leadership
role. Later on, you will be using more and more armies (Your fleet
will probably be trapped into the Med Sea by Spain.&quot; - Stephen
Breininger<BR>
<P>
&quot;Both (or she doesn't survive), and builds should be fairly
balanced in the first few years until the breakout period. There
may be a slight leaning toward fleets in order to secure the Med.&quot;
- Pitt Crandlemire<BR>
<P>
&quot;Italy is basically a land power which depending on the situation,
requires only minimal fleets to protect herself from the Mediterranean
Powers, but you definitely don't want to go without a navy!&quot;
- James Gemmill<BR>
<P>
&quot;It depends on alliances. If Italy can ally with one or more
of the other Med powers, then she can be a land power. Otherwise,
Italy is forced to be a naval power and ally with Germany.&quot;
- Chris Fridrich<BR>
<P>
&quot;My thinking is based around the fact that Italy is primarily
a Med power, &amp; is unlikely to be eliminated by a (northern)
land power. Therefore to establish itself Italy must take control
of the central Med by building a significant navy. Building armies
should only be done if easy gains are to be made in the Balkans
or across the Alps (into Germany or France).<BR>
<P>
In the early game, security depends on naval power. Growth will
come mostly from gains made by armies in the Balkans, but further
development will rely on the mobility &amp; flexibility provided
by a strong fleet arm.&quot; - Ian York<BR>
<P>
<a name="eastern"></a>
<B>Comments on Italy and the Eastern Med Area in Modern<BR>
</B>
<P>
&quot;If Italy can actually take the Eastern Med, he's golden.
As preparation, he can try to sneak up on Greece or Libya. Perhaps
assistance from Ukraine or Russia can be found? The one thing
Italy must _not_ do is let a strong Eastern power arise.&quot;
- Rick Desper<BR>
<P>
&quot;Ionian, Maltese, Adriatic, and Tyrrhenian are Italian only.
Period. Aegean and Eastern Mediterranean should be used as points
of cooperation with Turkey/Egypt for an attack on the other.&quot;
- Pitt Crandlemire<BR>
<P>
&quot;It depends on how friendly Egypt and Turkey are. Italy should
provoke a conflict between E and T otherwise, she's got REAL problems.&quot;
- Chris Fridrich<BR>
<P>
&quot;Try and get involved in the East Med as soon as possible.
By the time you arrive, Egypt and Turkey will be vicious enemies.
If Egypt has the upper hand, try and take away Libya. If Turkey
has the upper hand, go after Greece. If you can control the East
Med Sea, then you will be well on your way to victory. &quot;
- Stephen Breininger<BR>
<P>
&quot;Do everything you can to start a vicious ET conflict. Then
keep the balance of power, only interfering if you stand to gain
greatly (e.g. Eastern Med plus one of Greece &amp; Libya).&quot;
- Ian York<BR>
<P>
&quot;Italy can enter this arena only if a secure alliance is
obtained from Spain. A French alliance is not the same thing,
as it is Spain who can really hurt you with his fleets. Thus you
must be pretty sure he is your friend. Then you must deal with
Turkey and Egypt. If your heart is set on the East, then perhaps
Turkey is a better friend, he having the opportunity to be distracted
elsewhere. Not so Egypt. What's he going to do after you've both
conquered Turkey? Odds are he's going to go for the Balkans and
that's you're turf. Thus Italy should only become involved in
this sector as a secondary player, aiding Turkey or Egypt in their
goals, and picking up what you can.&quot; - James Gemmill<BR>
<P>
&quot;I think this is in many ways the most crucial point for
Italy. An Egypt-Turkey alliance is bad. Very bad. Do anything
to make sure one doesn't happen. If one happens, get help from
Spain and Ukraine ASAP. Remind anyone who's tempted to attack
you by land that the ET alliance is the most dangerous in the
game. Point them to the Modern Hall of Fame, if necessary...
<BR>
<P>
Now, assuming that Egypt and Turkey go to war with each other,
you need to keep the balance of power between them. One fleet
in the Ionian Sea giving support to the right side at the right
time can make a crucial difference. If Ukraine threatens the balance
by attacking Turkey, you need to warn him off, attacking him if
necessary. Again, a 2 unit intervention can be crucial. <BR>
<P>
If you are forced to choose sides in the Eastern Med, take Turkey's
side; you can get help later against Turkey, but not against Egypt
who will be very safe in his corner with Turkey gone. Don't forget
that you will need to modify the land based strategy somewhat
and build a few fleets, because you will end up with a naval war
against your ally at some point.&quot; - Alexander K. Woo<BR>
<P>
<a name="western"></a>
<B>Comments on Italy and the Western Med Area in Modern<BR>
</B>
<P>
&quot;Preferably, Spain is fighting France. Or Spain is fighting
Britain. The Western Mediterranean area seems to stay empty until
the later parts of the game; make sure that the Ligurian and Tyrrhenian
Seas are acknowledged as yours; you shouldn't have any trouble.
However, make sure that a proper counterbalance to France or Spain
(whoever is doing better) develops in the north; you'll need a
land power (Germany?) to balance France, or a naval power (Britain?)
to balance Spain.&quot; - Alexander K. Woo<BR>
<P>
&quot;At least for the short term, Italy should ally with Spain
if at all possible and take out France.&quot; - Chris Fridrich
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Ligurian should be left vacant by both Italy and France,
anything else is an act of war. Gol should be ceded to France/Spain.
The Western Mediterranean should be used as point of cooperation
with France/Spain for an attack on the other.&quot; - Pitt Crandlemire
<BR>
<P>
&quot;Italy should look to make sure neither France nor Spain
becomes too dominant early. It's probably not worth trying to
take Morocco.&quot; - Rick Desper<BR>
<P>
&quot;The Western Med is a bit more tricky than the Eastern, but
basically is the same strategy. However, in my opinion, there
are fewer rewards and too many players at the table for my liking.&quot;
- James Gemmill<BR>
<P>
&quot;Hopefully you and Spain will be allies. It is very easy
to be caught up in a deadlock in either end of the Med Sea though.
If Spain is growing well and seams to be on good terms with Britain,
watch out!&quot; - Stephen Breininger<BR>
<P>
<a name="stalemates"></a>
<B>Comments on Stalemates/Bottlenecks and Italy in Modern<BR>
</B>
<P>
&quot;If Britain takes over Iberia then Britain cannot form a
stalemate line to keep Italian fleets out of the SAO/NAO etc unless
Britain has armies in Spain as well as fleets. In general I think
it is better for Italy if Britain beats Spain rather than vice-versa.&quot;
- Toby Tyrrell<BR>
<P>
&quot;There are several bottlenecks which can allow Italy to seal
up the Med against a strong foe. Alternatively Italy may want
to rapidly advance beyond them to prevent being caught behind
a stalemate line &amp; missing out on a solo win.<BR>
<P>
Notable bottlenecks are the Straits of Gibraltar (F Mor s F SOG
can delay a northern power from entering the Med). A land based
power can't dislodge a supported unit in Cairo, &amp; even then
can't advance westwards if Alexandria &amp; Aswan are occupied;
however this blockpoint may conversely stop Italy from entering
Asia. Istanbul is third blockpoint, usually holdable from the
south-west - important in keeping Black Sea fleets from entering
play in the south.<BR>
<P>
Finally, the Eastern Med can be an important space in the late
game. If Italy is confined to the Med it may find an exit using
convoy through EME, which borders 7 land zones - perhaps your
land-based foe has not occupied them all...&quot; - Ian York
<BR>

<a name="winning"></a>
<B>Comments on Winning with Italy in Modern<BR>
</B>
<P>
&quot;Keep fighting balance between Egypt and Turkey. Grab Balkans.
Take a few French, Polish, or Ukrainian SCs, upsetting balances
of power as little as possible. Take out Egypt with Turkish help,
then Turkey with Ukrainian or Russian help. Meanwhile, stock up
on armies and beat your big northern ally, whoever it is, to the
33rd SC without attacking him directly. Don't bother with attacking
Spain unless you can do it with only the fleets you have left
over from Egypt and Turkey. Those fleets should be at least enough
for you to defend against Spain...&quot; - Alexander K. Woo<BR>
<P>
&quot;In the Modern variant I think whoever can get undisputed
control of the Balkans will stand a good chance of winning the
game. Certainly Italy is in a good position to go for them and
will most probably need them eventually in order to win the game.&quot;
- Toby Tyrrell<BR>
<P>
&quot;Secure the Med, then breakout via land war to the east or
sea war to the west. Germany must be an ally for a sea war and
probably should be for a land war. France well could be for a
land war. Britain should be a silent ally in a land war in order
to keep Germany in check.&quot; - Pitt Crandlemire<BR>
<P>
&quot;Expand into the Balkans working with Germany while your
fleets take out Spain. Britain is likely to block your path at
Gibraltar, so invade France while Germany is distracted in the
north-east.<BR>
<P>
Pay attention to benefiting from the ET conflict. A strong eastern
power is likely to emerge, coming into conflict with Britain &amp;/or
Germany. You will need to stab one of these two, while keeping
a strong eastern force to hold your possessions in Egypt &amp;
Turkey against your eastern rival.&quot; - Ian York<BR>
<P>
&quot;I would start a war between Egypt and Turkey, and one between
France/Britain and Spain. While E/T are fighting, take Greece
if possible without offending the Turk. Make sure Egypt goes down.
Turkey is doomed half of the time anyway. If you can arrange it
so U/E are attacking Turkey, so much the better. You can ride
in as the white knight, and grab a lot.<BR>
<P>
With Egypt gone, you can seal Asia Minor off. Push at least one
fleet through Red Sea. Who's the Western ally? Spain or France.
Let them continue to grow while you push back Eastern power (Ukraine
or Russia - if Poland, so much the better).<BR>
<P>
You now need to do two things to win: 1) attack Western power
and take Morocco, Monaco, Marseilles, and maybe a couple more
SC's, and 2) push through Asia Minor and invade Ukraine territories.
If you have more success on one front, you can reduce your requirements
on the other front. I don't think Italy can win by just attacking
one of the two fronts. It is too difficult to push North, in general.
But it is possible to win without getting North of the SAO or
North of Kiev.<BR>
<P>
One power that Italy should keep an eye on is Britain. If Britain
is strong, it is less likely that the center of Europe is filled
with armies. (Contrast this to Poland or Germany). If Italy can
push North through Switzerland to Munich, this is beautiful. But
it is very difficult to do, so probably should not be attempted
lightly.&quot; - Rick Desper<BR>
<P>
&quot;Go after the Balkans, then Egypt, then Turkey, then the
world.&quot; - Stephen Breininger<BR>

<B>Comments about Italy and North Africa in Modern<BR>
</B>
<p>
&quot;Africa is much more desirable than in the standard version.&quot; - Michael
Gates
<P>
&quot;Take it if no one wants it.  Otherwise, let Spain and Egypt fight over
it.&quot; - Alexander K. Woo
<P>
&quot;First go after Tunisia, then head east into Libya then into Egypt.&quot; -
Stephen Breininger
<P>
&quot;Tunisia is the only North African center that is Italian; Morocco is
Spanish/British and Libya is Egyptian. Italy's alliances determine if she
makes a move in North Africa.&quot; - Chris Fridrich
<P>
&quot;Get a fleet in the Maltese Sea early. Depending on who your first target
is, keep them out of this region until you need a build. Bouncing Spain
out of Tunisia or Egypt out of Libya is more
important than actually occupying the region yourself. If you are after
Spain, get a second fleet into TYS quickly to win you Tunisia & join the
race west for Morocco & the Straits.&quot; - Ian York
<P>
&quot;The only given is Tunisia.  Libya can be a bargaining chip with Egypt,
going to him in exchange for a firm alliance.  Morocco must be taken at
the point Italy tries to break out to the west, which is not likely to
happen until 1998/1999 at the earliest.&quot; - Pitt Crandlemire
<P>
&quot;Italy should take Tunisia in the first year - unless Spain is contesting
Tunisia, but Egypt is not contesting Libya.  Italy should not overly
obsess about the two close North African SC's.  The game for Italy is to
be won and lost in the Balkans.  Italy might even consider throwing
Tunisia to Britain if that will complicate the Western situation.&quot; - Rick
Desper
<P>
&quot;Only Tunisia can be considered Italian by right. Anything else is a
bonus. It is best to allow Egypt into Libya and just forget about
Morocco, letting Britain and Spain fight over that. Attempting to go for
Libya is a bad option: it is hard to defend and will of course make Egypt
feel threatened, not a good move if that makes him ally with Turkey.&quot; -

<B>Comments on Austria and Switzerland and Italy in Modern<BR>
</B>
<P>
&quot;Definitely get Austria! should also try for Switzerland, but don't make
enemies
over it.&quot; - Stephen Breininger
<P>
&quot;Germany and France can be expected to fight amongst themselves and it is
best to leave them to it and avoid getting involved by competing for
Switzerland.&quot; - Toby Tyrrell
<P>
&quot;Support Germany into Switzerland in Spring '95, take Austria in the
Fall. This gives Italy the position to attack the Czech Republic,
Hungary, or attack Germany in Munich, Saxony, and/or Switzerland.&quot;- Chris
Fridrich
<P>
&quot;Switzerland should be given to France in exchange for help against
Spain. Italy can usually force its way into Austria early in the game. A
deal with Germany might involve Italy holding Austria & Croatia while
supporting Germany into the Czech Rep & Hungary. This offers a good
opportunity for a joint IG venture east.&quot; - Ian York
<P>
&quot;I think the key is to bargain with Germany in order to keep France out
of SWI. You agree that Germany gets SWI while Italy gets AUS. Germany is
more vulnerable than France is this situation, and therefore a more
reliable partner. AUS is more defensible than SWI.&quot; - James Gemmill
<P>
&quot;Austria borders two home SCs and is pretty crucial to security.
Switzerland will likely be contested between Germany and France; if so
you can ignore it; if Germany ignores it though, you need to make sure
France doesn't get too strong in the area.  If they're working
together against you, beg for help elsewhere...&quot; - Alexander K. Woo
<P>
&quot;Italy should lay claim to Austria and let Germany/France determine the
future of Switzerland; support for one of the other if they can't come to
arrangement can also be a significant bargaining chip in the formation of
an early alliance. Of course, the support should only be given to
Germany...&quot; - Pitt Crandlemire
<P>
&quot;Italy should take Austria, if at all possible.  Austria borders three
other 'natural' Italian SC's (Milan, Venice, Croatia).  Letting Germany
in is not tolerable.  If Germany is a pest, it might be
possible to get support either from the French in Switzerland or the
Poles in the Czech Republic. As for Switzerland, since France starts with
two armies on the province, it is unlikely that Italy could take it
without German help. If Germany offers the support, consider it.&quot; - Rick
Desper

<a name="balkans"></a>
<B>Comments on Italy and the Balkans in Modern<BR>
</B>
<P>
&quot;Croatia is definitely Italian. But don't get your fleet stuck there.
Negotiate hard with Turkey over Serbia, & with everybody over Hungary. An
army in Croatia gives you a great deal of power. Your Adriatic fleet can
win you Serbia too, but is needed south quickly in the Ionian to keep the
ET conflict where it belongs (in the Eastern Med).&quot; - Ian York
<P>
&quot;The thickest concentration of neutral supply centres is in the Balkans
and so it is a good idea to go for power there.&quot; - Toby Tyrrell
<P>
&quot;(Italy should handle the Balkans) with an iron fist!  Seriously, Italy
should be able to take Croatia and Serbia by the end of the second year -
often by the end of the first year.  The most immediate problem is
perhaps Turkey, who can take Greece and/or Bulgaria.  Ukraine can take
Rumania and/or Hungary. However, both Turkey and Ukraine have the problem
of dealing with another power breathing down the respective neck.  It is
extremely rare that Turkey can focus on Italy before Egypt.  Similarly
Ukraine is too intertwined with Poland and Russia to move quickly.
However, if U/P ally quickly, Italy would have to be extremely good to
avoid being quickly rolled West.&quot; - Rick Desper
<P>
&quot;Grab, grab, grab...  at the very least, Croatia and Serbia should be
Italian in 1994/1995.  Hungary in 1996 (or used as a trading chip with
Germany or Poland).  Greece in 1996 or 1997.  Rumania/Bulgaria as soon as
practical.&quot; - Pitt Crandlemire
<P>
&quot;I think it is important to get Ukraine involved. Ukraine makes a good
Italian ally: A non-naval power who has lots of problems of his own in
the early going, but who is conveniently located on the Balkans doorstep,
and someone who probably desires your friendship to offset his Turkish
problem. You should be able to get Croatia and Serbia without anyone's
help, by which time you will know whether Ukraine is in a position to
help you. If not, try Poland.&quot; - James Gemmill
<P>
&quot;(Italy should) take as much as she can grab. Cro, ser, and hun are
easily attainable; depending on alliances, rum can be taken away from U,
bul can be taken away from T, and/or gre can be taken away from E/T. Of
course, Italy may very well end up supporting one of her allies into
either rum/bul/gre. At the very least, hun, cro, and ser are Italian.&quot; -
Chris Fridrich
<P>
&quot;Go full force.  Claim the advantage of proximity to grab as much of the
Balkans as possible without actually threatening anyone's home SCs.&quot; -
Alexander K. Woo
<P>
&quot;The Balkans are yours! But how to handle them depends on who you are
attacking
in the East Med.  If you are attacking Turkey, you can use the Balkans as
a launching point against Turkey. Work with the Ukraine in this area.
Chances are, you will be fighting Egypt instead!  Promise Turkey he can
have the naval ports of Greece/Bulgaria/Rumania/Odessa. You will need to
go after Croatia/Serbia/Hungary.  Insist that you be the one who will
move into Egypt, Turkey gets the Middle-East!  Then when you are in the
Balkans and in Egypt, crush down on Turkey.&quot; - Stephen Breininger

&quot;Befriending both Spain and Egypt is ideal as both France

peace to all of the Med waters allowing all three powers to concentrate

&quot;#1 SPAIN as a neutral ally, #2 either Turkey or Egypt (probably
Turkey)&quot; - Stephen Breininger<BR>
<P>
&quot;#1 Germany, #2 France&quot; - Ian York<BR>
<P>
&quot;Everyone should be your ally. Why not? You're going for
neutral SCs. You do have to make sure that the Egypt-Turkey alliance
or the France-Germany alliance don't happen. Pick Turkey over
Egypt and Germany over France if forced to choose. Spain and Poland
are unlikely to attack you.&quot; - Alexander K. Woo <BR>

&quot;In press games I think the best allies would be Ukraine
and Germany (against France and Poland?).&quot; - Toby Tyrrell

<P>
&quot;Initially Germany for the AUS/SWI question, an anti-Turkish
Egypt and a friendly if distracted Spain (would be the best allies).
Towards the mid-game, Ukraine becomes your best friend and the
others less so. However, being in the middle, Italy *must* be
active diplomatically, as you will perceived, by reasons of your
central position, as having your fingers in everybody's pie. Thus
arrangements/agreements must be made, and your neighbours sized
up before you make any decisions on how to open.&quot; - James

&quot;Egypt has the potential of being a problem. What Italy must

war. If E/T ally, Italy must sell soul to France or Spain.&quot;
- Rick Desper<BR>
<P>
&quot;Egypt will usually challenge for power in the Med, but it
is very hard to wipe out a skillful Italy. The best strategy may
well be to ally with Egypt (but that will limit progress to the
east), or else to try and maintain some sort of dynamic stalemate
with Egypt if you have enough fleets. However allying with Egypt
is probably too limiting and the temptation to stab is probably
too great for you to leave an empty flank against Egypt.&quot;

&quot;Keep Spain away from you.<BR>
<P>
A: This could be achieved by teaming up with France and going
directly after Spain. If Germany and France get into a battle
abandoned this plan, and make peace with Spain. But the question
is, who will benefit most from this attack? Probably France, unless
you stab France in the back (at just the right moment). But this
plans will keep you 100% occupied, and unable to get involved
with the East Med, which is where your best chances lie. SO instead...
<BR>
<P>
B: Work with Spain as an ally. Point out the stalemate line in
the Wmed and try and convince him to focus on Britain. You will
head East!&quot; - Stephen Breininger<BR>
