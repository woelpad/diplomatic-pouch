Manus,

Brilliant!

I haven't checked it all out yet but the New Improved DP looks great!

First glitch I've found, however:

The link with the newspaper icon, "Read all about our New Year's 
remodeling!" (http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/W1996A/1997.html) 
gave me a "404 Not Found" error.

I was beginning to wonder why things had been so quiet on the DP 
front.  Now I understand.

BTW, fear not, CTR will come out this month....  Just too much crap 
lately.

Manus,

  I just read your article about the Pouch and the hobby in general and 
wholeheartedly agree that we should have email Awards. Actually, we 
already have something similar with the 'Hall of Fame', 'Diplomacy Skill 
Index' and now the 'Modern Hall of Fame' for my Modern variant. Along 
with the invitational games in which the best players of each game play, 
these already give the players something to strive for. Perhaps there 
should be a more tangible reward such as a plaque, or something, but as 
this is an Online hobby, perhaps an online 'plaque' at the Pouch would 
be sufficient. 

  But we could use awards for other things, such as 'Award for Special 
Contribution to PBEM/Judge Diplomacy' (could be several), 'Best Judge', 
'Best GM', 'Rookie of the Year', 'Best Dip Web Page', 'Best EZine', 
'Best Judge Modification', 'Best Pouch Article', and... 'Best (New) 
Judge Variant?' :-) 

  The Modern HoF 1996 Award goes to Erik Stensland as the best player of 
1996, so if you make an Awards page, let me know and I'll give you the 
appropriate link.

  I'd also like to nominate David Norman for 'Special Contribution' for 
developing both mapper for windows, which is invaluable for playing 
judge dip (whoever wrote mapit should also be nominated), and now the 
mapmaker program. I'd also like to nominate Nick Fitzpatrick for the 
same category for running the HoF all these years, and helping with the 
judge code etc... If you need more names I can keep on going! :-)

  Cheers,

  Vince

Oops.  Slip of the thumb.  Thanks for pointing that out.  I'll ask Manus to
change it.

I did but it may not have been clear.  Shrink the western end of the
Himalayas so that Delhi and Calcutta now border Kunlun.  That would suffice
to allow greater contact between India and China.

Well, I'm not sure I see this as quite as big a problem as you do in that
Bangladesh can be taken by any of the two adjacent provinces if you have a
third unit to cut support for BAN from the other adjacent province.  It's
similar in effect to North Africa on the standard map and I think that's
appropriate since it is India's only protection against a land war from the
south, just as NAF is instrumental in protecting France or Italy from
passge through the straits.  Nonetheless, I do agree, that it is a bit more
difficult to take BAN than other provinces.  One possible option might be
to shrink the western end of the Himalayas a tad more and extend the
southern edge of Kunlun to border Bangladesh.  That's not very elegant,
though.

>I suggest adding a sea space bordering  Bangladesh and Burma.

Hmmm...you could split the Bay of Bengal into two provinces, making the new
one the Andamon Sea.  If you run a border from the center of the NE corner
of the Central Indian Ocean to just west of the border between BAN and BUR,
you'd end up with BoB bordering BAN, CAL, BOM, ARS, SRI, CIO, and AND; and
AND bordering BAN, BoB, CIO, SUM, THS, and THA.  Yeah, I like this.  I'll
add it my my suggested changes for Asia Redux.  Are you going to play?

I thought about this (in the north, at least) but I don't see any way to
subdivide the current spaces without unduly penalizing Russia's (and
Siberia's) ability to move units east at sea in a timely fashion.  That
only leaves the option of extending the map a bit further north and adding
a few more sea spaces there but I decided not to recommend it because I
didn't think it was really necessary.  A stalemate line from the NE to the
SW can certainly be made but, due to the other vagaries of the map, it's
all but certain that it couldn't be set up by one power soon enough to stop
Indonesia from breaking through it.  It would require the cooperation of
two powers (RS, PS, PR, NS, PC, NC) to get it into place before Indonesia
could break it and make it moot.  Even then, it's questionable in my mind
that those powers could set it and hold it before Indonesia (or even India)
could punch through it if the southern powers focused on getting armies
moving north as I advised in my article.  If those powers don't do that,
they'e going to get shut down anyway.

The feedback is very much appreciated.  Thanks.

The pun is based in the word, Toto.  In the '70s, the band Toto had a big

Pitt,

  I read your Asia variant and agree with your analysis. The variant is 
unbalanced, and Indonesia, Siberia and Russia are the strongest powers. 
In the game I played, these powers shared a 3-way draw. I was the 
biggest, as Indonesia, but the inability to break through in the east 
and attack Siberia cost me the solo (but gave me a safe border a long 
while, as it only required 4 units to hold the line).

  BTW, wherever you say 'Madras' in your article, it should be 
'Madagascar' instead. Madras is a city in south-east India.

  Your suggested changes to the Asia Variant are interesting, but you 
don't mention how you would shrink the Himalayas. I guess you just want 
to shrink it in the west but I think Bangladesh is a big problem, as it 
is only bordered by 3 other spaces, making it almost impossible to take. 
If India holds Bangladesh, it is almost impossible to take him out from 
the south without some luck. That's why I had to let India be and take 
out Persia first as Indonesia. By the time that was done, Russia and 
Siberia were moving south, and we took out India to finish the game, but 
it was too late for me. I suggest adding a sea space bordering 
Bangladesh and Burma.

 You also didn't suggest any changes in the east, but I think it is 
necessary to open the game by adding some Pacific Sea spaces east of the 
Bering Strait and China Seas. That would make a stalemate line between 
Indonesia and Siberia harder to hold.

  Well, that's my 2 cents. I can't identify the pun in your title, but 
the 'we're not in Kansas anymore' comes from the Wizard of Oz.

  Cheers,

  Vince

In response to the mailbag question I have a Russian anecdote.

The game began with a Turkish-Austrian war (big surprise), France went anti-Italian from 
the start and England and Germany were doing some petty squabbling.  The most annoying 
thing to me, the Russian, was the strong German-French non-aggression pact that to the 
end-game never broke.  

As Russia I was doing extremely well at working Turkey and Austria against each other 
and away from me. While growing in scandinavia and fighting off the Germans by working 
the English against him.  

However I was in such good graces with Turkey, without actually helping him, that once 
he owned Greece and Bulgaria he had situated A Bul, A Con, A Alb, F Gre, F Aeg in the 
Fall of 1902.  I had worked this out with Italy, who was afraid of Turkey, especially 
since Italy wasn't even holding his own against France and Austria believed him when 
Turkey told him he was going after Italy.  I had F Rum, A Mos, and A Gal and I built A 
Sev.  Since it was an army Turkey didn't even bat an eyebrow but when the spring came, I 
convinced him to move F Aeg - Ion, F Gre - Adr, A Bul - Gre and A Con - Bul and I moved 
F Rum - Bla, A Sev - Arm, and A Mos - Sev thereby guaranteeing both Smyrna and Ankara in 
the Fall with two armies.  Poor Turkey ended up in Greece being supported by France and 
Myself against the other.

BTW I did end up winning that game by taking all of Austria and most of Germany before 
the French could.

Hi Manus,

Thanks for your email.  I did go to your site and looked at the review.
It talks about a game called "Diplomacy" which is being sold by Hobby Japan
in Japan, but I don't see anything about Pouch.  If you have the magazine
with you, you might want to fax me the page.

Wow, checked out the Dip Pouch.  And I'm still impressed.  I
like the changes (though I get concerned that too much of 
the Diplomacy world centres around devel.diplom.org and
morrolan.diplom.org.  If we ever lose kovar we will have

Meanwhile, could you update my registry listing.  My web-page
(of sorts) is up.  http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz
Not too much there, but some info, and links to my FTP site.

Also, I just found an old article on Miller/Boardman numbers.
It is probably still relevent, and I put it in my FTP area
and made it HTTPable.  The address is
http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/Ftp/bn_mn_article

It dates from early 1994, and probably appeared in EP or Gateway.

Congratulations on the latest issue of DP.
I like the look.

It is a disappointment that the DipPouch game has fallen 
apart. Obviously the trading part of the game requires a 
lot of work, and my rules provided some flexibility in that
part of the game. 
But now for the first time an issue appears without the 
corresponding results (1902 builds) for the dipPouch game.
Can anything be done about this.

Subject: Stab story (Re: Spring vs. Fall stabs in DipPouch)
Apparently-To: manus@diplom.org
Status: RO

	This remains the only successful major stab I ever made, as well
as my only solo win.  I was playing Germany.  I stabbed England.  At the
beginning of 1908, England owned (Bel, Edi, Lon, Lvp).  After 1908,
England owned (Bre, Edi, Lon, Lvp).  I will let the judge output (taken
from the history) tell the rest.  (Note that I had to make sure France
would order a par - pic; if i remember correctly, i told him that i might
support the move.)
	This stab illustrates a couple points about Fall stabs.  First of
all, a Fall stab usually does not gain many SCs but rather sets up for the
next year.  (I convoyed to both Lon and Edi in 1909.)  A Fall stab
frequently does not force a disband, but rather limits the builds that the
stabbee will get from gains in another theatre.  This way, the stabbee has
moved his units away from his home SCs, without getting any builds to defend
them.  Occasionally, one may even set up a Fall stab when the stabbee will
have a build, if the build will still be insufficient for putting up a
defense.
	Another advantage to this type of Fall stab is that the units of the
stabbee are likely to be tangled up with those of his (former) enemy, and
this may take some time to disentangle, especially if there is a lack of
trust between them.

Manus,

I've been looking at the new stuff you guys have done at DP and I 
think its terrific.  The registration forms and the queue are pretty 
cool.

One question:  What have you and Simon done, or thought about 
preservation of the DP html, cgi, etc. files?  What would happen if 
you were to disappear from the Earth, or suffer a stroke and not give 
a shit about Dip any more.  Are the source files being archived 
somewhere else that Simon or someone else could access?

When a project gets to be this size, and of this much importance to a 
community, preparation must be made so that it is not dependent on 
one person for survival.

(BTW, I'm not voluneering to do any of this, mind you, just wondering 
if this is an issue you have considered.  As a librarian, I am always 
thinking about the preservation issues.)

On a related subject:

I know that the Postal Zine Register is in need of updating.  Several 
people have sent me things, and you have forwarded things to me.  
Once I get CTR#8 out the door, that will be my next project.

Also, should I be updating the links back to DP on my pages to the 
new address?  How long will you maintain the mirror (or is this 
all part of the master plan addressing my concern above)?

On another reated subject:

I finally received the full report from the Dave McCrumb on the Hobby 
Awards.  Unfortunately, he did not send me the electronic version 
that I asked for.  As soon as we get our OCR scanner fixed here, I 
will scan the text and then put it up for all to read, plus I will 
print it in CTR.

On yet another related subject:

Nah, that was it for now.

See ya.

Done!  Game 'redux' on the CAWA judge.  I'll be posting the opening to

Outstanding is all I can say!  I thoroughly enjoyed reading the articles
about DipCon.  Man, what I wouldn't do to play people at the top of the
Dip world!  I know that I'd probably get my butt kicked, but it would
be so much fun finding out where I would stand against these guys!  I
am rarely eliminated in PBEM Dip, but I realize that FTF is a whole
different creature.

Sounds like you guys had a hell of a good time.  I envy you guys.  It
would be awesome to meet Pitt, Lief, and everyone else.  I don't think
I've ever been in a PBEM Dip game that had any of these guys.

I wish I could come up with enough money to attend this years in
Sweden.  Are you going?

Keep in touch, buddy!

Manus,

I just signed up for "fastone".  Now I have the honor of being the first one
to sign up for the very first game ever created by the DP Game Queue system.
I've left my mark (be it ever so small). 

Actually, everything worked great.  I got the message from the DP before your
message.  It had your email address as Game Master.  The DP mail message said
"FAST WEEKEND GUNBOAT" game and I was a little apprehensive that I had 
mistakenly signed up in a REAL TIME gamers queue.  But, the game listing 
showed exactly what I was looking for.  This will be my first Gunboat game, 
and I wanted a game that moved faster than the standard one I'm in now.
Those seem to fill up pretty fast.   Thanks for the service! The Pouch is
great.  It had everything I needed and more to get started in PBEM Diplomacy.

Thanks again,
Jim Comas

No, No, that's great!  I mean that's what I wanted, but didn't know thatit

Thank you for your letter.  Payola variants are not uncommonly played on
the Judges.  There's even a Payola parser to process the auction
results! Look for game openings, they're out there and are more common
than you probably think.

There is a variant called "Intimate Dip" where entire countries are
auctioned off to one of two players.  Of historical interest, this
variant happens to have been the inspiration for Manus Hand to create
the Payola concept!  Interestingly, he notes that he didn't like the
"Intimate" variant very much.

It is very possible that there is a variant where whole countries' units
are auctioned off, although I'm not familiar with it.  The Payola
concept can be applied to any number of variants (not just Standard
Diplomacy).  My personal opinion is that this is one of the reasons that
Payola is catching so many players attention.

Keep an eye out for the next issue of the Diplomatic Pouch.  In my 2nd
article in the Payola series I'll be discussing some more advanced
details of this variant as well as some strategy and tactics used in
bidding!

Everything worked well, I now await the players to contact me!

I am not sure you deserve a high dedication rating. You know, you've got to
do something for the hobby to get special favors like that. And, I am not
really sure you spend quite enough time working on Diplomacy. Have you lost
a promotion (or failed a test) due to Diplomacy addiction? If not, well,
you're out of luck....

Ok, ok, I'll fix your dedication in a major way, and I just removed the
directory for bigstick. That's a poor way for the create to fail....

Manus,

Thank you for creating the game 'bigstick'.  Unfortunately, I've let
my dedication slip horrendously on USEF judge so I cannot join the
game.  You may want to look for someone else to take "my" spot in it.

Nevertheless, game queue system is an excellent idea.  I have often
found that the games I would like to join fill within hours.

So far, so good. The system has worked perfectly for me. I received the
initial message from The Pouch telling me that you were to be the GM and
to expect an e-mail. I was already registered with the judge so I didn't
get to try out that feature. I remember first registering with the judge
was one of the major difficulties when I first started to play by
e-mail.

I've signed on to the game and I'm ready to go. This is a much simpler
way of finding a game than searching through the openings list to find a
standard game. Also, if this system is appreciated as much by everyone
else as it is by me, do you plan to expand it so that all major variants
are represented. I've never played in a variant but for those who enjoy
them, this system could also work. I'm not a programmer so I don't know
if this would be as simple as it seems.

One small thing did go wrong. The message from The Pouch didn't give the
e-mail address of the judge. The message received was,

> Your wait has paid off!  A GUNBOAT game has been created for you on
> the Internet judge at e-mail address .
> 
> If you are not registered with this judge, you can register using The
> Pouch's online registration form at
>     http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/registration.html
> 
> The e-mail address of your GameMaster is MANUS@EVOLVING.COM

Thanks for setting up this system and GMing the game,

Brendan

Congratulations on a great issue of the zine.  As a relative newbie I have
found that it contains information of considerable utility.   

In particular the article on communicating in no-press games was very
helpful, especially since I only play no-press (takes up less time).   One
aspect I think the author may have missed is that you can use armies in
conjunction with wacky/illegal convoy routes to convey info.  This may be
helpful if you don't have a spare fleet.  So for example

a burgundy s a moscow -> munich

France is suggesting that Russia attack Germany.  

Also a pet peeve I have lately.  People, at least in the no-press games I
have been playing in, seem to enjoy allowing their home supply centres  to be
eaten while they go off trying to take over some neighbour. Sometimes this
even manifests itself by two countries swapping home supply centres.  Has
anyone else noticed this fad?  It doesn't usually make for a very interesting
game; either it hands victory to one of my enemies or it makes my solo win
too easy.  

As the season to stab; its better to stab in the fall because spring is a
season of celebrating renewal and you don't want to ruin such a joyful time
for another player.

Manus, 

Just a comment on my first experience using the game queues as a GM.  
I created as standard game, signed up to the standard games queue to 
GM a game, and most of the players that have contacted me so far are 
judge newbies i.e. should be in the 'Novice' queue.

Perhaps a warning should be added to the queues page to tell people 
that if this is their first judge game they should choose the 
novice queue.  I can see the game queues being used by newbies a lot
since it's a relatively friendly way of getting a game, so this 
may be repeated often.  

Other than that, at least 3 of the addresses I was sent were invalid 
(though I've since guessed one of those correctly).  Not a lot you 
can do about that, except maybe another warning to double-check the 
address.  

Good idea though.  

Darren

start up, and you can put me in as a possible GM for Mach games, and 
gunboat weekly deadlines (the slower one).

Count on it.  I already have one good suggestion to modify the maop a bit
more, so there will likely be an Asia3.  Maybe I'll be able to an article
on the entire design/redesign process...

Manus,

A slightly obvious thought about the game queues. Given how many messages are 
appearing on r.g.d. from queue GMs, saying that half the players have not turned 
up, would it be worth making it possible for a GM to send a message to the queue 
saying that a number of players have not turned up, so that the queue can then 
provide the replacement starters ?

David.

Manus,

	I tried to mail you from the pouch, but ran into some problems
(probably my fault).  I would like to have my name added to people seeking
FTF players in North Carolina.  I live in Chapel Hill, but would be
willing to travel a little.  Under the informal gatherings list, there is
a Raleigh player listed, but the link to his e-mail is bad (Eric
Weidener).  
	Anyway, if you could add me, I'd greatly appreciate it. :)  Yours
and others' work with the pouch has been tremendous.  I'm happy to say
I've joined a game and am mastering two through it.  The site is amazing.

Nathan Bitner
