Regarding stabs

My rule of thumb regarding stabs are easy. In spring stab for position and
in the fall stab for centers. Because this is also the most obvious
disregarding this rule is also smart (hm..being a dippie player is hard,
isn't it?)
Classical spring stabs are MAO-IRI as France, Mun-Bur as Germany, Sev-BLA
and Ank-BLA as Russia or Turkey. I seldom make a spring stab unless the
stab gives me a center in the fall and almost never if the person I stab is
likely to recieve a build in the fall even if I stab him. 

Since spring stabs are easier to forgive I like to make positional advances
toward my ally in the spring and then retreat in the fall. If you motivate
your small spring stab with that you had recieved evil news regarding your
allys plan and just wanted to protect yorurself your moves will be
forgiven. My experience is that the trust you loose from the stab is gained
tenthful from your unconditional retreat. 

Regarding stabs in general it is important to understand why you make the
stab. To stab someone just because you might gain a center is not very
smart. If you just stab to gain a center you will have to stab all the time
and will soon find that you have made your ally a enemy and in the long
term gained nothing. Remember one important thing - when you stab a ally
you might gain a center or two but you also gain something less pleasant,
his anger. You can count on him using his remaining untits to hurt you and
this might prove to be devastating.

As I see it there are several diffrent reaosons for and stab, for example: 
The big game winning stab - This stab is the best since its goal is to take
a solo victory. Not stabing when a victory is certain is to me not only bad
play but defies the purpose of the game. Diplomacy is a hard game and not
playing to ones full potential is short of cheating.

The stupid stab - Unfortunatly too common. This is a stab that have no
chance of success or its success is extremly temporary.

The probing stab - See earlier in the article. A stab to gain trust instead
of centers or position.

The Illusion of a stab - Sometime you might fool the others into thinking
that you and your ally has broken up and one make a fake stab on the other.
If you and your ally want to change centers this might be done by faking
these stab that really arn't a stab.

The sensible stab - A well, planned, timed and executed stab. Lovely.

A perfect stab is wonderful to make and horrible to recieve but stabs are
vital to the game. Not stabbing leads to predictive and boring play.
Remember - Paranoia is a way of life. 

Thanks,
