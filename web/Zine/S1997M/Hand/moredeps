manus:

in r.g.d, i've seen some negative posts related to the game queueing
system you helped set up.  you've always responded to them (eg, making
folks type in their email address twice, allowing a GM to get N 
more players, etc) quickly and responsibly.

i generally don't feel the need to pat people on the back. 
but after that one moron toasted dave kleiman because USIN went
down when dave was on an announced vacation, i'm trying to do
it a little more.  i really like the queueing system and 
just wanted to say thanks to you and the others who created 
and maintain it.

one thing i've never seen mentioned (but i don't read everything) 
is that the queueing system should give a much better understanding 
of what types of games players want, which should be useful to 
GMs who want to create their own games.     

with that in mind, you might consider widening the menu of choices 
that people have to choose from to include more games and variants.  
eg, perhaps some player would like a standard/48 hour weekend included
game, but that's not offered, so he either accepts the closest choice
or doesn't sign up at all.   or perhaps allowing players to request
a game type somehow.  eg, if i would like to try a 'chaos' game, it
would be nice if there were a way to tell the queueing system that.

an additional thought is that in rcg it seems like several GMs have
indicated that people sign up in the queues, but then do not signon
to the game.  perhaps because they mistyped their email address,
and if so, the double-entry should greatly reduce those errors.
have you considered the possibility of the queueing system sending
email to the address that the player entered, and putting the player
in the queue if and only if the player responds in some magic
way to the queue's email?   this is just a thought, perhaps 
impractical.  

please consider all of this very friendly suggestions.   thanks
very much for all the work you have done and if the queueing
system never changes, you've still sold me with what you've
already provided.  

thanks.

no hard feelings when you stab me.
