<H2><CENTER>1996 People's Diplomacy Organization Relief Auction<p>
</CENTER></H2>

<P>

<H3 align=center>Rules</H3>
<ol>
<li>The deadline for bids is April 20, 1997.  Send all bids
       to: Douglas Kent at 10214 Black Hickory Rd., Dallas,
       TX  75243.  Bids can also be emailed to me at
       <a href=mailto:73567.1414@compuserve.com>73567.1414@compuserve.com</a>
	   or faxed to me at (972)
       234-8742, but if you send them via Email or fax be sure
       to include your postal address so I can get in touch with
       you both ways if need be.
<li>   Anyone may participate in the bidding.  All you have to
       do is submit a bid on an item (send no money now
       please).  If you are the highest bidder the item will be
       yours, and you'll be notified when to send the money
       and how much.  You may submit conditional bids on
       total amount to be spent, or if you win or lose another
       item.  You can't submit conditionals that say to outbid
       the next highest bidder by an amount of money.  This
       is only a one round auction, so plan wisely.  Also, all
       bids will be secret.
<li>    In case of tied bids, postmark will decide.  If postmarks
       are the same, the auctioneer will flip a coin or roll a die
       to determine the winner.  Tied bids are extremely rare.
<li>    All items are postage paid or will have the postage
       figured into the minimum price if you are in North
       America.  Bidders outside of North America may be
       asked to pay for part or all of shipping for larger items,
       at the donor's discretion.
<li>    All donations collected will go to hobby services as
       decided upon by the PDORA Financial Committee.
<li>    Allow 4-6 weeks after the auction deadline for the item
       to get to you.  The faster everybody gets their payments
       in to me, the faster I can have the items sent out to the
       successful bidders.
<li>    Input is welcome and encouraged.
<li>    Additional catalogues can be had for a SASE from me.
<li>    Good luck and have fun.
<li>   PDORA Financial Committee: Brent McKee, Jim
       Burgess, Don Del Grande, Melinda Holley, Michael
       Lowrey.
