<b>Broadcast message from grauler@physics.orst.edu as Turkey in barney:

With regards to the faked message, I remember reading it, but could not
find it amongst the 211 messages I have.  I do not scrutinize messages,
since I assume that writing styles can change.
<p>
I think I did make a bad boo-boo, in that I started bouncing myself in
Silesia too late.  I think England could have taken advantage of that.
But it might have caused a 3-way draw.  Actually, if Russia had made
a bigger fuss about pointing out to me what a big meany England was for
trying to take Tunis, he might have been included in a draw.  But all
I saw was a letter from England to the effect that he (England) would
be crazy not to try for Tunis in the hopes I would mess up.  I almost
did,
until I realized that there was a fleet in the Gulf of Lyon.
<p>
My favorite move was the attempted convoy into Albania (I believe) from
Gascony was it?!  That army sure got its money's worth that turn.
(Assuming
the soldiers actually got to go to Albania and get bounced.)
