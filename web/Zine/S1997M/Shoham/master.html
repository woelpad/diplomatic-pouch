So it's finally over - my congratulations to the winners. And to Dan for
making it to the Diplomacy books once again for longest survival with
one SC.
Another hooray for Turkey who stayed with the game from the start - he's
the
only one.
<p>
Barney was the first game I ever moderated from the start, and I enjoyed
it -
especially since there was much play even in the late stages. This is
much
different from all these games which end in the low 1910's because
players
settle for a quick draw or no-one cares to stop the leader. There were
times
when I even could catch up with looking through all the messages
exchanged.
<p>
As for publishing the EOG's in Diplomacy World, I must say that I have
never
seen an issue of DW before, and therefore don't know whether we are
welcome
there. Neither do I have the e-mail address of the editor. Can someone
help
out with that. Of course I'll submit the EOG's for publication in EPC2.
<p>
Martin.
