EOG statement for England
<P>
A very interesting game. Hard opponents and difficult diplomacy. It was
the first E-Mail Diplomacy game I signed in.
<P>
I entered this game as a replacement for England. The situation was
simple : England was fighting a hard war in France, and Turkey was
spreading freely across Central Europe. I saw the inevitable end this
situation would produce : I would probably win against France, but
Turkey
would be unstoppable and win. Therefore I proposed to France to turn
against Turkey.
<P>
France accepted that, asking just to recover his territories and some of
his lost power. I couldn't oppose easily Turkey, and France wouldn't
turn
against him if he was weak.
<P>
At this moment I <b>really</b> thought the France-England alliance would last
sufficiently to stop Turkey and save what was left of Austria. I was
quite
surprised he stabbed me quite quickly, with Russian help, while Turkey
was
still very powerful.
<P>
I managed to stop Turkish and French advances, locking the Northern seas
and the StPetersburg area. I could lose a few more centers, but they
would
not be able to destroy England. I knew then I just had to wait until
France accepted that fact and turned against Turkey again with me. It
occurred quite quickly too, and France and England were once more
together.
<P>
At this moment, Carragher seemed convinced that I would not stab him,
and
that a stab would certainly mean the victory of Turkey. It was true at
the
beginning of our new alliance, but no longer true when all his armies
were
in the middle of the battle in Central Europe. I saw Carragher was a
real
danger in trench wars (I didn't know the genius was Dan Shoham at this
moment &lt;smile&gt;), a situation I was not used to. It seemed to me he directed
all the campaign against Turkey, gaining provinces I would have
considered
as lost... At this moment Turkey sent messages to propose to me a
two-way
draw, giving me two centers to let me become more powerful than him.
<P>
The problem was most gains were to be made by France. This situation
couldn't last until France was too powerful to be stopped. I waited for
the right moment and stabbed, carefully calculating to be sure that even
if France tried to give all centers to Turkey to punish me of the stab,
I
would be able to get 17 centers before.
<P>
Turkey was afraid of me going for a solo win, and I didn't want any
three-way
draws. I designed a 17-17 share of the map, and rules to be sure no one
would stab the other. The rules weren't strictly respected, but it
worked
anyway.
<P>
Even reduced to a few centers, Carragher was still a menace. With him
alive, I thought, rather stupidly, that there was still someone that
could
prevent me from winning this game. This is probably why I preferred to
destroy him entirely rather than use his last armies to have a try to an
impossible solo win.
<P>
I sent the last Russian army in Turkish territories (Yes, I was fooled
<b>too</b> by his sudden desire to see his homeland back &lt;smile&gt;), formed an
unbreakable line. The 17-17 line was decided long before then, and I
knew
it would be impossible to try a solo win from there. I just waited until
Russia was destroyed and set draw.
<P>
My felicitations to Dan Shoham who was able to play it until the end.
<P>
My apologies to Bob Carragher for the "unnecessary" last stab. Your
error
was perhaps you appeared too smart to me. I was so impressed I realized
I
couldn't be sure to win until you has no more units on the board... I
didn't know it was Dan that organized the campaign against Turkey...
<P>
My respect to the Turk, with whom all alliances and promises were held.
<P>
My apologies to all for my poor English (I am a poor lonesome French
student far away from home).
<P>
