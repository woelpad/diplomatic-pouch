<P>
Until Barney, I thought that 'mercy' positions die quickly.
<P>
When I joined game Barney nine months ago, at Martin's request, I thought
this would be another one of those mercy position plays. Russia was down
to one unit - in Berlin - and no prospects whatsoever. Submit orders
for a few seasons until someone realizes that the center I was
controlling
would be more useful feeding a unit of his own forces. Still, I decided
to give it my best effort toward the _only_ objective I ever had in the
game - a position in the final draw.
<P>
My first act was to find a secure ally. One who wouldn't stab me for my
only center. To secure such an ally, I had to convince him that my
objective
was non-threatening. I thus made a broadcast offering my undying loyalty
to whomever would suggest a challenging objective for myself and a
creative and ambitious one for himself. Austria and Turkey never
bothered
answering that call. England and (the previous) France made half-hearted
efforts focusing mostly on what moves they want me to submit than on
what they are doing in general or what I may place is. This gave me the
distinct feeling of being set up for instant death as soon as I outlive
my usefulness. However, when president Carragher took over France the
next year, he had the spirit to present me with a truly audacious plan
of how to win despite his rather weak position. I didn't quite believe
he fully intended to follow that plan, but it certainly fitted my needs.
I had found my ally.
<P>
My next action was to decide what my presented role would be. My
objective
was still to get into a draw. What really appealed to me in the French
plan
was his intent to stab back and forth multiple times. Such a plan, with
an
energetic player - as Carragher certainly was - had the potential to
go a long way. At the opportune time, I would turn on him and secure
my position in a final draw. By that time, the rest of the board would
be so shell-shocked by Carragher's ascent, they would gladly accept my
defection and not risk their position with an effort to cleanse me out
of the final draw.
I, of course, would maintain a low profile. Maintaining a low profile
is something I can not credibly do in my regular games, but which I can
in a mercy position. When the time comes, after Carragher burned all
his bridges, I'll still have a virgin credibility available to me.
<P>
Thus went a period of many years. I was making myself useful to France
by providing tactical options and strategic plannings, and in return was
provided with life and safety. When it came to stalemate lines - and
their
counter-part, trench warfare, I would really work the details through.
<P>
Only once, in 1908, did I break with France. He was just stabbed by
Austria
and (in panic) said "Well, you may want to prepare your baggage for a
quick
departure." I didn't think he was going to abandon <b>me</b>, but he just
stepped
out of the mold I needed him to be in. He was no longer playing the
energetic - even if weak - power out to conquer the world, but instead
that of a desperate defensive. If his ship was going to sink, I wasn't
about to be on it at the time. I abandoned <b>him</b>. Fortunately, he regained
his composure the next season and we went on as if nothing happened.
<P>
During the long years of shifting alliances I was contacted by England
or Turkey once in a blue moon. I ignored those contacts as part of my
low profile presentation. Far from the appearance I tried to create, I
was <i>very</i> involved in the game - but only through France.
<p>
During the EF assault on Turkey, I saw Turkey's mighty defensive line is
not quite a stalemate line and proceeded to (via France) dismantle his
defenses. I saw the danger of an English stab and began to see a new
potential in it. If England were to have a partially successful stab,
HE would present a victory threat. I just might get to be part of a draw
designed to stop him. While I did not "engineer" the English stab, I
did try to simultaneously encourage it and prevent it from being too
successful. I encouraged France to send as much of his fleet as possible
to break the Turkish lines, while warning him against vacating France
too much. Unfortunately, he went a little too far (for my taste) on
vacating France.
<p>
The English stab was hardly a surprise. Not even its timing. France
was overexposed, but in another turn would have new units to cover his
back.
While Carragher was frantic, I was ecstatic. For the first time in this
game I had something that approached a realistic chance. I had calmed
him
down and then proceeded to plan potential stop-England stalemates and
strategy. My hope was that France and Turkey - both of whom had recently
stared death in the eyes - would accept a stalemate that included
them and not risk everything to reduce it's size. I am certain France
would
have accepted it, I now find that even Turkey was seriously considering
it.
<P>
It didn't work. England managed to create conditions for Turkey to
safely
extinguish France, and despite Carragher's efforts (mostly through my
inspirations) to promise each of them in turn a victory, they both
proceeded
to crush him between them and without threatening each other.
<P>
Finally, time for me to break on my own came. My 1 center survival was
approaching that of the record . The record, 14 years, was achieved
in game "VEAL." That game was also moderated by Martin, and I won it
as Russia
despite a stalemate line held by three powers with 12, 4, and 1 centers
by manipulating the differences between the defenders and creating a
potential for a two-way draw with the largest of them. I sent Turkey (via
carragher) a copy of that game's EOG to scare him away from accepting a two-way
draw with England. I also begun to suggest that my game objective has
now become to beat that record. It never was. I was advertising such
an objective so as to continue making myself non-threatening.
<P>
England asked for my help against France. He really didn't need that
help
- especially since he wasn't even trying to win. I couldn't quite figure
out why is he asking for it. I couldn't believe he was so scared of
carragher's rhetoric even now when France was down to a couple of
centers.
In return, he was willing to help me break the record. An offer  I had
to assume was genuine since it costs him nothing to keep.
<P>
To maintain all my options, I deliberately botched my defections from
France.
It didn't matter. Neither England nor Turkey would try to win, and
neither
was afraid the other will. France was doomed.
<P>
I still had a <i>little</i> play left. Cashing in on my (deliberately
botched)
defection, I found a new objective - now that the record was already
broken.
I wanted to see my homeland and die there. This innocent request, if
granted,
would give me passage through the Turkish interior - and as long as I'm
alive,
I can still try things. The request was granted, and I begun my
pilgrimage.
<p>
Once I reached Budapest, it was time to betray my benefactor. I took
advantage of ex-president Carragher to try and talk England into
pressing
Turkey, as I turned on my deal. The idea was that England couldn't
possibly
have a reason <b>not</b> to pressure Turkey  - given that his own 17-SC
stalemate
line was totally secured - and Turkey might not be able to handle my
defection and maintain a stalemate line simultaneously. I just might get
into the final draw after all. Even if England offered Turkey -
following
a failed stab - the breathing room to extinguish me, the latter might
not
trust England enough for anything and might prefer the "safe" three-way draw
over risking it all for a two-way.
I made a quick U-turn and headed for Serbia. With five (!) adjacent supply
centers - six if you count Serbia itself - I figured it would take a great
tactical exercise to knock me out without endangering the stalemate
line.
Turkey might be too exhausted to even try.
<p>
England did indeed put <i>some</i> pressure, but not enough. He limited his
pressure to the Med while leaving the Russian front unchallenged. Turkey
had enough of a breathing room to crush me. He did. After all, I only
had
one unit (smile). Oh well. I might have come close, but my quest to make a
position with a mercy position has yet to be fruitful.
<P>
Still, I did survive for almost 20 years. I did see three powers (AGF)
die before me. And I did get to visit eight supply centers - Berlin, Munich,
Marseilles, Venice, Trieste, Budapest, Serbia, and Greece - before I
died.
That's more than most real powers get to visit in a normal game.
<P>
I certainly had a lot of fun playing this behind-the-scenes game.
<P>
I would like to congratulate all players for a most well played game.
I did not see any tactical or strategic boo-boo that would be the mark
of a novice player (excluding Germany's suicide attack on Turkey, but
I discounted that as boredom).
<P>
Finally, I would like to thank our Master, Martin, for keeping this
<b>long</b> game going and for making sure it doesn't fall into the usual
trap of late-late-abandon-replace-late-late-etc.
I would also like to thank the Electronic Frontier Foundation and David
Kovar for making the Judge which made this game possible available.
