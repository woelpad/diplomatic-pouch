<H2 align=center>France's End Of Game Statement from "barney"</H2>
<hr><p>
<b>Broadcast message from carraghe@cs.ucsd.edu as France in barney:</b>
<P>
[Aw hell, I can't wait.  So without further ado, you have the
end-of-game statement from France.  This is pretty long,
around 240 lines.  You have been warned.]
<P>
Well, as one of the unfortunate powers eliminated from Barney,
I suppose you, the reader, are expecting a "sour grapes"
End-Of-Game statement.  In that case, I won't disappoint you.  B-)
<P>
Actually, it's said that one may learn more from losing than
from winning.  I must agree with this.  I've learned far more
about Diplomacy in this game than in the two I played previously
(successfully, I might add).
<P>
Okay, first some background.  Waaaay back in August of 1993, the
original French player posted that he was losing his account,
and needed to be replaced.  I took a look at his position, and
without knowing the exact situation, figured it'd be a short
game.  It was Winter 1906, with adjustments yet to be made before
the Spring 1907 moves, and France needed to remove three units.
Further, England had already taken Paris, Brest, and much of
Germany.  To the east and south, Austria had attacked the French
possessions in Italy, though help was on the way in the form of
Turkey, who was attacking Austria.  I walked into this and
wondered what the heck I was going to do.
<P>
Before each game, I make a decision on what my goal is:  do I
want to play for a strong, two-way draw, or do I want to go for
the win at all costs?  Since it looked like a real challenge, I
went for the latter.  But how could I, owning but one home
center, and seven overall, hope to triumph over England, who
was already at 13?  First, I resolved to stop the war in the
Balkans.  Eventually, we formed a tri-partite pact.  But until
we could put our forces into action against the Brits, I needed
to be sure that the front in Germany was secured.  At the time,
I had only an army in Munich, and Russia controlled Berlin.
(England was in Kiel, Denmark, and Holland.)  This was actually
the most crucial point in the game for me, for I needed to
convince the Tsar to work with me, though he had long-since been
reduced to one center.
<P>
After contacting him and trying to seduce him with the prospect
of centers, he replied with:
<blockquote><i>
New supply centers are of little use to me. I will make to you the
same offer I have made to your predecessor and to England:
Come up with a creative and challenging objective that I might strive
for in my present state, and I will consider it. England suggested
something (sorry, can't say what). Your predecessor promised to think of
something but never got back to me.
I know it's tough to compete against a proposal which you don't know
what it has, using criteria as lunatic as "creative and challenging," but
that's what you must do...
</i></blockquote>
(Actually, I have no idea what England promised; I never asked the
Tsar, even after we started working together.  I hope he mentions
it in his EOG.)  What I proposed was to eventually convoy him into
the British Isles, with the long-range goal of also taking out the
Sultan as well.  This, the Tsar thought was "a rather ambitious
plan ... and [it passed his] 'creativity' test."  I thus gained an
ally who remained steadfast for the rest of the game, except for
one incident which I will describe later.
<P>
I still had no clue what Germany desired.  We communicated briefly
in the Spring of 1907, the Kaiser still dreaming of returning to
Berlin.  Of course, I would have none of this counterproductive
plan, though I didn't directly tell him that.  But the Kaiser must
have sensed this, for he never spoke to me again.  However, he was
apparently as steadfast an ally of Turkey as the Tsar was of me,
for he seemed to follow virtually every request the Sultan sent him.
Eventually, when he bored of the game, he allowed himself to be
eliminated by the Sultan under circumstances about which I am still
a little confused.
<P>
However, at this point, I had effectively managed to convince
everyone to unite against the King of England, Stephen III, the
self-styled Emperor of India, Grandduke of Russia, Grobherzog
von Deutschland, Marquis de France, and scourge of Turkey.  (At
the time, he believed his one, true friend was Austria.)  I
proceeded to convince the King that I would allow him into the
Med if he were to "leave me alone."  Stephen, however, insisted
that I part with more provinces to compensate for war damages.
This haughty attitude simply reinforced my desire to not only
remove English presence from my soil, but also make him my #1
victim.  Hence, I agreed to his proposal, but stabbed him instead.
<P>
This apparently took him completely by surprise, for he sent me
rather heated communiqu&eacute;s in its aftermath, always proclaiming
the surety that he would win "with or without" me.  I do not
understand this, however, for a win "with or without" me is a
loss on my part either way.  He also claimed that the Sultan
had been sending him proposals for three- or two-way draws that
included only himself, Austria, and England.  Regardless of the
truth of this, I knew it would be far easier to convince the
Austrians and the Turks of <b>my</b> good intentions rather than the
Brits, especially since they were still by far the largest power
in Europe.  Playing with him, but utterly ignoring his pleas,
requests, and demands, I attacked him again in the Fall.  While
I lost Kiel (having stolen it in the Spring), I considered the
year a success in that my position was more secure, and England
had lost a center, though it was to the Ottoman Empire which was
also larger than France.
<P>
Another year went by, and I reacquired Paris.  England lost
St. Petersburg to the German/Turkish alliance.  This was for
me the most exciting time of the game, as England was being
pushed back, while I was achieving my chief goal:  regaining
control of France.  It was during this time, though, that a
near-dissolution of the Franco-Russian alliance took place.
I had been stabbed partially by Austria in the Spring of 1908,
though it did no real damage.  But, as I was not sure whether
I could maintain the front in Germany without Austrian aid, I
told the Russians to prepare for the worst.  The Tsar took this
as a sign that I was abandoning him, and proceeded to join the
British camp.  But by the following year, after much diplomacy,
the relationship was reestablished.  However, the strain of
maintaining the truce between Austria and Turkey was beginning to
wear me out.  Also, Turkey made the mistake of building a fleet in
Smyrna, which heightened my paranoia about his designs on my
Mediterranean possessions.  Finally, out of frustration or lack of
time, the old English player resigned, and a new king, Terry II,
rose in his place.  This turned the alliance around completely, for
I then led England, Russia, and Austria against Turkey and Germany.
I still insisted on having Terry return Brest to me so that I
would help ensure Turkey would not win, and I actually gained
this concession.  Thus began the first in a series of reversals
and stabbings on my part.  (I never intended to help the original
England, so I don't count that.)
<P>
By this time, the Sultan was talking about a two- or three-way draw,
eliminating both the two rumt powers, Russia and Germany, and
Austria, who at this time was up to five centers.  I was having
none of this, but played on his suggestions to lull him so that
my stab could be pulled off.  Unfortunately, though I did
succeed in the stab, it hurt the Sultan very little.  Worse,
with England beginning to put forces into the Med, I knew I
was simply reversing the situation, and needed to take control
of this area of Europe.  Thus came the rapprochement with the
Sultan, and the final stab of Austria.  Unfortunately, though
the result would net me a total of five centers, I was unable to
use three of them, and England would take advantage of this.
After eliminating his Mediterranean forces, with the help of
the Sultan's fleets, I found myself with a secured area around
Gibraltar, but no truly secure fronts.  Plus, the Sultan was
still growing, and I had run up against a wall against further
growth.  I made my last stab of the game:  I made peace with
the English and attacked Turkey.  Thus began the longest part
of the game, which at one point pitted five Turkish fleets
against six French fleets in an unstable stalemate around the
Italian peninsula.  Progress was incredibly slow, though I
knew that if I could simply break through the Sultan's lines,
I could race through to take several centers, and perhaps
surprise England one last time.  It was during this time that
my ally, Russia, began to provide the tactical plans for the
alliance, though I gave England no clue about this.  The Tsar's
experience showed, especially in providing excellent strategic
advice.  Unfortunately, I did not always follow that advice,
such as in the Fall of 1913, missing an excellent opportunity
that did not again present itself.
<P>
It was clear to the Sultan, though, that I would eventually
break through, so he took advantage of a big mistake I made:
not diploming with Turkey during this whole time.  He then
brokered a deal with England, giving him two supply centers
at a crucial moment.  That, coupled with my ignoring England's
England's maneuverings in the north, allowed England to begin
his stab of me.  Since both England and I had declared to each
other that we would enable Turkey to win were one to stab the
other, I decided to immediately implement my half of MAD.  But,
given the long history between the Tsar and myself, I informed
him of my intentions first.  It was his efforts that brought me
out of my funk, and taught me yet another lesson:  *always* play
for a stalemate line even if looks clear you will lose.  He
conceived of a brilliant stalemate line against the British,
but it depended on convincing the Turks that an English win was
imminent.  Again, allowing me to appear to be the dominant ally,
Russia let me do all the diploming with the Sultan.  I barraged
him constantly with messages about how easily a stalemate line
could be achieved, and how King Terry would simply overwhelm him
if he didn't take the threat seriously.  Unfortunately, this
backfired, as I was by now far less trustworthy than the English,
who did absolutely nothing to compromise that trust.  The Sultan
played me along, allowing me to sacrifice center after center
(necessary to establish the line regardless of England's
maneuverings).  When all was in place, the Sultan stabbed me.
<P>
But, the Tsar gave me one last hope, if we could just convince
the Sultan to go for a win.  For my first time, I faked a
message from England, claiming he could win entirely on his
own.  Once again, the Sultan claimed interest; but, due to my own
habit of sending in orders early, and a freak accident in the Real
World, the opportunity was lost.  Turkey completed his stab.  The
last, desperate ploy was to pull the same stunt with England:  to
put him in a position to win and force the Turks to enter into a
multi-way draw.  This failed as well, for England simply betrayed
my trust, and my existence came to an end the following Fall.
<P>
There are still a few things that confuse me:  I understand
England's stab which sent the game into its final stages, finally
breaking the deadlock in the Mediterranean between myself and the
Sultan.  I even understand the decision on the Sultan's part to
play me for a fool by letting me make myself exceedingly vulnerable
while setting up my part of the stalemate line, though I must admit
he insulted my intelligence along the way.  I would never have
played along so long had I any other real alternative.  What I don't
understand are their final betrayals.  By this time, I had been
rendered effectively impotent.  From the level of trust they
obviously had for each other, I found their need to continue to
deceive me incomprehensible.  England's final excuse was especially
ridiculous, and rather offensively amateurish.  And I do say this
in spite of the attempts on England's part in the last year of play
to take Tunis.
<P>
However, to the winners, I give my congratulations.  I have played
games where I decided to stick by my agreements to the end, no
matter how tempting the win looked.  To the Sultan, I will say
that the stalemate line offer was genuine, though all offers
afterwards were deceiving, based only on the desire to be part of
a final stalemate line.  To England, I never held a grudge against
you for your initial betrayal; but your final stab was very
childish.  If you trusted Turkey as you clearly did, you would
have required only one more turn to take both Spain and Marseilles;
I was in no position to stop you, or even offer serious resistance.
<P>
To Russia, who was my steadfast ally through 14 long (game) years,
it's too bad that I fell victim to the same mistake as the other
France, but it happens to the best.  (Smile.)  Some, including yourself,
may wonder why I allowed you to live so long, including sacrificing
my own centers at times.  The answer is easy:  there were a few
times in the early years when I might've decided it was easier to
pick up another center, but more often than not your advice proved
very helpful, and that, to me, makes for a very valuable ally.
Your aid, especially in the Stalemate Line years, when I was ready
to throw in the towel, was greatly appreciated.  Thank you for all
your help.  (Of course, now I'm sure I'll find out he directed the
last several years which resulted in my eventual elimination.  B-)
<P>
Ah, I feel better now.  To all the Barney players, thank you for an
entertaining seven months.  I hope we may all meet again on the
Diplomacy battlefield!
