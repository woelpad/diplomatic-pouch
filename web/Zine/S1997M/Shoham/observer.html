I only observed this game for its final game year.  But just from that I
can see it was amazing.  17-17 draws aren't all that common anyhow.  But
I'm really amazed by the totally awesome performance of the one-center
Russia!!!
<p>
I'd like to see these game results get wide distribution... it might
motivate people by showing them just how much _fun_ can be had by taking
on
a "hopeless" position!
<p>
This game was unique.  In addition to EPC2, I suggest the EOG statements
be
sent to the Diplomacy World editor, who may be interested in publishing
an
article on the game.
