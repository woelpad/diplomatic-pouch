<b>Broadcast message from shoham@ll.mit.edu as Russia in barney:</b>
<p>
&gt;&gt;            I encouraged France to send as much of his fleet as possible<br>
&gt;&gt;to break the Turkish lines, while warning him against vacating France<br>
&gt;&gt;too much. Unfortunately, he went a little too far (for my taste) on<br>
&gt;&gt;vacating France.
<p>
&gt;I still do not see how I could have been successful otherwise,<br>
&gt;successful meaning a breakthrough.<br>
<p>
Is that the definition of success? Even if your head hits the block
next?
<p>
If making yourself open to a stab is the price for a breakthrough, is
it not better not to have that breakthrough?
<p>
&gt;it really came down to putting more<br>
&gt;fleets around the Ionian than Turkey and forcing my way through.<br>
&gt;I don't see how I could have accomplished this without either<br>
&gt;(a) English fleets (unacceptable)<br>
<p>
One English fleet at the front would have been acceptable. It might have
even dissuaded England from stabbing if he had priority for
post-break-through
supply center capture.
