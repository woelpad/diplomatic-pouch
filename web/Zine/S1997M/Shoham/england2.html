<p>
I am very impressed by Dan Shoham play on this game. He managed to
manipulate us all with just one center, never giving a clue he was the
strategic genius behind Carragher's successes...
<p>
[From Dan Shoham]<br>
&gt; It didn't work. England managed to create conditions for Turkey to safely<br>
&gt; extinguish France, and despite Carragher's efforts (mostly through my<br>
&gt; inspirations) to promise each of them in turn a victory, they both proceeded<br>
&gt; to crush him between them and without threatening each other.<br>
<p>
I had many surprises in this game. I considered Bob Carragher and Dan
Shoham as "potentially dangerous" even reduced to a few centers. I
wanted
a two-way draw, and I thought one of them might devise a new technique
to
steal this draw from me. Therefore I "assured" a two-way draw, providing
Turkey all security, never giving up something Dan might have used to
turn
him back against me. If I had been more aggressive, I think I would not
have achieved this result, since France, Russia and Turkey would have
formed a some kind of line to prevent me from getting my 18th center,
and
I would have been forced to accept a 3 or 4-way draw.
<p>
&gt; England asked for my help against France. He really didn't need that help<br>
&gt; - especially since he wasn't even trying to win. I couldn't quite figure<br>
&gt; out why is he asking for it.<br>
<p>
I thought (perhaps I was wrong) that Turkey+France might have a chance
to
stop me at this point of the game. I had to distract Russia at this
point,
which I thought was not interested in the game anymore :-)
<p>
&gt; Once I reached Budapest, it was time to betray my benefactor. I took<br>
&gt; advantage of ex-president Carragher to try and talk England into pressing<br>
&gt; Turkey, as I turned on my deal. The idea was that England couldn't possibly<br>
&gt; have a reason NOT to pressure Turkey  - given that his own 17-SC stalemate<br>
&gt; line was totally secured - and Turkey might not be able to handle my<br>
&gt; defection and maintain a stalemate line simultaneously. I just might get<br>
&gt; into the final draw after all. Even if England offered Turkey -  following<br>
&gt; a failed stab - the breathing room to extinguish me, the latter might not<br>
&gt; trust England enough for anything and might prefer the "safe" 3-way draw<br>
&gt; over risking it all for a 2-way.<br>
&gt; I made a quick U-turn and headed for Serbia. With 5 (!) adjacent supply<br>
&gt; centers - 6 if you count Serbia itself - I figured it would take a great<br>
&gt; tactical exercise to knock me out without endangering the stalemate line.<br>
&gt; Turkey might be too exhausted to even try.<br>
<p>
I quickly saw the danger of this. I proposed several solutions to the
Sultan, the simpler being staying far away from him in the North. It may
have succeeded, though.
<p>
&gt; I did not see any tactical or strategic boo-boo that would be the mark<br>
&gt; of a novice player (excluding Germany's suicide attack on Turkey, but<br>
&gt; I discounted that as boredom).<br>
<p>
Well, I played a few board games before, but this is my first year in
E-Mail diplomacy. I am not very comfortable with stalemate lines, and I
know time is running against me in most situations...
<p>
-King Terry (Thierry) II of England
<p>
PS : To prevent fake messages from being used against me, I always used
the "King Terry II" signature with Russia and France, and the "-England"
signature with Turkey... I don't know if it influenced the game, but I
think it will explain what this "King" stuff is to Turkey :-)
