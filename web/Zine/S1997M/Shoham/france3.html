<H2 align=center>France's Second Response</H2>

Bob-&gt; Is that the definition of success? Even if your head hits the
block next?
<p>
That was never a given, though I suppose it should've been more obvious
to me after all my stabs.  Again, I credit that to my tunnel-vision.
<p>
Bob-&gt; If making yourself open to a stab is the price for a breakthrough,<br>
is
Bob-&gt; it not better not to have that breakthrough?
<p>
Well, as I mentioned previously, my goal was to win the game outright.
Anything else was, at that point, a loss.  Short-sighted?  Tunnel-
vision?  Yes, but there you have it.
<p>
Besides, nothing ventured, nothing gained.  I thought this was the
sort of play you wanted from your Ally.
<p>
I gambled and lost.  It happens sometimes.  I'll do it again.
<p>
Bob-&gt; &gt;it really came down to putting more<br>
Bob-&gt; &gt;fleets around the Ionian than Turkey and forcing my way through.<br>
Bob-&gt; &gt;I don't see how I could have accomplished this without either<br>
Bob-&gt; &gt;(a) English fleets (unacceptable)<br>
Bob-&gt;<br>
Bob-&gt; One English fleet at the front would have been acceptable. It
might have
Bob-&gt; even dissuaded England from stabbing if he had priority for<br>
post-break-through
Bob-&gt; supply center capture.<br>
<p>
I see that now.  I hope I won't fall victim to this sort of short-sightedness
in my other games....
<p>
However, at the same time, King Terry might have balked at this
because he didn't want centers so far away from his main defensive
lines.  (This was something we had discussed before I stabbed him
that last time.)

<p>
&gt; [From King Terry (Thierry) II of England]<br>
&gt; I am very impressed by Dan Shoham play on this game. He managed to<br>
&gt; manipulate us all with just one center, never giving a clue he was the<br>
&gt; strategic genius behind Carragher's successes...<br>
<p>
Hey!  Gimme a little credit!!  B-)
<p>
&gt; I had many surprises in this game. I considered Bob Carragher and Dan<br>
&gt; Shoham as "potentially dangerous" even reduced to a few centers. I wanted<br>
&gt; a two-way draw, and I thought one of them might devise a new technique to<br>
&gt; steal this draw from me. Therefore I "assured" a two-way draw, providing<br>
&gt; Turkey all security, never giving up something Dan might have used to turn<br>
&gt; him back against me. If I had been more aggressive, I think I would not<br>
&gt; have achieved this result, since France, Russia and Turkey would have<br>
&gt; formed a some kind of line to prevent me from getting my 18th center, and<br>
&gt; I would have been forced to accept a 3 or 4-way draw.<br>
<p>
Indeed.  Had you done *anything* offensive against the Sultan, I
think the 4-way draw would have been a foregone conclusion.  In
fact, all that odd maneuvering on my part after your stab was to
set up a stalemate line against you.  The line would have succeeded
regardless of your actions and would have been static.  Only
problem was, it needed the Sultan's blessings.
<p>
&gt; PS : To prevent fake messages from being used against me, I always used<br>
&gt; the "King Terry II" signature with Russia and France, and the "-England"<br>
&gt; signature with Turkey... I don't know if it influenced the game, but I<br>
&gt; think it will explain what this "King" stuff is to Turkey :-)<br>
<p>
Ah, interesting.  If the Sultan is still listening, I'd like to
ask him if he was taken in by the faked message from England I
sent to him?  The signature would've given it away, since "you"
signed it "King Terry II."
<p>
Good work!
