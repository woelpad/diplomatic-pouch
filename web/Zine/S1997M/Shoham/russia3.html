<b>Broadcast message from shoham@ll.mit.edu as Russia in barney:</b>

<p>
About changing the signature to defeat fakes.
<p>
I've used this method in the past, (In my first Email game, as Russia, I
signed my name 'Rasputen', but used a different spelling for each
addressee.
It is easy to come up with 6 plausible way to spell that name),
but later decided that the utility of this method is rather limited.
<p>
Against careless players, the signature change wouldn't even be noticed.
<p>
A careful player who receives what is said to be a copy of a message and
notices that the signature is different will consider several
possibilities:
<p>
<dl><dt>1. That the message is genuine, and that<br>
<dd>   1a. the original sender uses a different signature whenever
communicating
       with the leaker, including this time.<br>
<dd>   1b. the original sender changed the signature only this time to
discredit
       this message in case of a leak.
<p>
<dt>2. That the message is a fake, and that
<dd>   2a. the original sender uses a different signature whenever
communicating
       with the faker, thus causing him to fake incorrectly.
<dd>   2b. the faker wasn't careful and signed incorrectly.
</ul>
<p>
(In Barney, we had 2a).
<p>
Notice that (2a) is totally indistinguishable from (1a) or (1b) as
far as what the target of the leak can tell.
<p>
(2b), is really the only realistic reason to use this
different-signature
approach. Namely, hope that when a message of yours is leaked or faked,
the recipient would THINK that the leaker/faker wasn't careful and
signed incorrectly. Now, against careful players this shouldn't work at
all. No one would believe a careful player made such an obvious mistake.
Otherwise, the varied signature should be close enough to the original
so as to make the hypothesis that this was an inadvertent error
plausible.<p>
A spelling change might do it. Inventing a long and complicated title
might
not. If Turkey notices that England signs his messages "-england", and
then France sends a copy of what he says is a message from England that
is signed "King Terry II of England" (or something like that), would
Turkey then think that France has "inadvertently" invented this complex
signature when France really wanted to just imitate English
communications?
<p>

The reason I think the utility of this method is limited is because for
the difference to be so subtle as to make it plausible that it was a
true error, it is usually unnoticed by the recipient to begin with.
<p>
A possible use is to "expose" fakes when confronted with them. You
would then say "ahaa. This is a fake. Notice how the lowly faker
misspelled
my name. I never do that...". This shouldn't work against anyone who
thinks carefully or is experienced since it could be used on real as
well
as faked messages. (in my "Rasputen" game, I used this to "expose" as a
fake what was actually a genuine leak...)
