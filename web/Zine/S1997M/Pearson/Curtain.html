 When the Iron Curtain Falls:<br>
Maintaining the Mass Alliance

<P>
If it's not virtually unheard of, it's definitely taboo - diplomats 
 form ranks behind a common cause and pledge themselves to the utter
eradication of 
 another power from the beginning!  The notion of a rock-solid alliance,
above all 
 pleas, threats, and negotiations, seems to run contrary to the very
ethos of Diplomacy, in 
 which, if one can't beat one's allies, he can certainly deceive them. 
But however 
 dirty a trick in this game of dirty tricks, such an alliance was
initiated.  In a situation like 
 this,  where few players are likely to have experience, some thoughtful
consideration may 
 provide insight. 
<p>
	The game in question was played <i>sans</i>-Judge via e-mail (white press
	only) 
 with some friends of mine whom I had taught to play.  We had decided to
try again 
 some three or four months after our previous game, which had ended due to waning
interest.  
 This turned out to play a crucial role in the alliances that were to
form, as well as giving 
 me two hard-and-fast rules for games played with the same group: never
be "the guy who 
 knows what he's doing," and forget the last game.  Not everyone, it
seems, had hit 
 upon these rules, and that led to a hairy situation.
<p>
	Two days into preliminary negotiations, I had heard from two independent 
sources that the Russian, without correspondence, had declared me, as 
 England, his mortal enemy.  As novices to the game, my friends and I
tend to stab at 
 inopportune moments, but another diplomat had initiated war without
negotiation, which was an 
 opportunity too good to pass up.  A Russian grudge against England is
not necessarily the 
 kiss of death in any game, but a crucial part of my plan was the
acquisition of Scandinavian 
 land, and though I didn't expect to see the Czar in London, he would prove a 
 terrible nuisance.  
<p>
	Within another two days, I had managed to convince Turkey, France (my 
 ally), Italy (who was so scared of immediate elimination that he was to
become the 
 vulture/bootlicker of the early game), and Austria to ally against Russia 
 and Germany, the newcomer to the group.  This, however, was not as
difficult as one would 
 expect.  Again, former relationships played too large a role: Russia
had gained a despised 
 position in the previous game as the Austria who benefited from our
inexperience and poor 
 coordination, an easy mark for vengeance.  The strategy would be
simple: I, along with 
 France, would establish a stable line across Nor, Nth, Nwg, Bel, and
Bur;  Italy would 
 move through Tyr to threaten southern Germany while Austria would
thrust into the 
 Russo-German DMZ; and Turkey would open with F Ank-Bla, A Con-Bul, A
Smy-Arm.  
<p>
	By now, those of you with any experience are ready to point out the gaping 
 holes in the <b>Master Plan</b>.  After all, no mass alliance lasts
long enough to 
 completely decimate two powers without developing serious flaws, but I
had good reason 
 to believe it would work.  As mentioned before, little propaganda was
needed to 
 demonize the Russian as a bloodthirsty barbarian, and painting the
unknown German as a 
 tactical genius proved less difficult still.  Moreover, the alliance
offered spoils 
 to all, keeping everyone at least temporarily happy.  By the time
territory ran out in the 
 south, I hoped to have Swe, Den, and StP.
<p>
	The last link in the chain was coordination: the Balkans would have to be 
 neutralized as a volatile political situation if anything was to be 
 accomplished in the south.  Pushing my role as <i>concerned ally</i>,
to its limit, I hoped to 
 arrange a partition which would keep the volatile Austrian from sinking
his teeth into the Turk 
 (my favorite power and thus, puppet project).  I advised the Turk to
push for Bul and 
 Gre, but also to accept Rum and Bul if things got tense.  However, the
Austrian, whose 
 computer decided to mimic a stroke, was incommunicado just long enough
to make last-minute 
 orders a necessity.  
<p>
	Spring 01 was a mixed bag.  France executed Bre-Pic, Par-Bur, and Mar-Spa 
 as planned, while I opened with the Churchill (Liv-Edi, Edi-Nwg, and
Lon-Nth).  
 Germany was orthodox with Mun-Ruh and Ber-Kie, but forced guesswork
with Kie-Hel, 
 Russia was a predictable Mos-StP, StP-Gob, Sev-Bla, and War-Gal.  The
latter of 
 these were bounced as planned, but the Turk confusedly ordered Con H
and Smy-Arm.  
 Austria took Serbia and sailed to Albania, showing his hand.  Fall
resulted in France 
 gaining Bel, Germany Hol and Den, Turkey Con, Italy Tun, but the
Austrian decided on Rum 
 and Gre.  I gained Nwy, but this was a given.  It was Russia that
worried me.  The 
 Russian took Swe but luckily missed the StP-Fin move which would have
allowed him a StP 
 build and three units against me in 02.  Turkey prepared for a Sev
assault, and the 
 alliance, despite delays, was holding. 
<p>
	It was Winter before signs of trouble showed.  After berating Italy for his 
 reluctance to attack Mun from Tyr, he again swore allegiance to <i>The 
 Cause,</i> but both he and Turkey received curt letters from Austria
soon thereafter requesting 
 their prompt withdrawal from his territory.  An Italian withdrawal from
Tyr would merely 
 be counterproductive, but it seemed the Austrian had become convinced
that the 
 Balkan states should be his alone!  The situation had transformed in a
matter of a 
 day from the marching hordes of a massive alliance to a collection of
nervous monarchs 
 standing on the brink of a real war.  The last thing I needed was a
southern war, and 
 everyone I could muster was attempting to convince the power-drunk
Austrian that five centers 
 does not an empire make.  It became evident that the Austrian suffered
not only from a 
 manifest destiny complex, but a paranoia (above and beyond Diplomacy
caliber) that 
 had convinced him of an impending Italy-Turkey assault and his position
of primary risk in 
the war.
<p>
	Truthfully, playing Diplomacy with closed ranks isn't exciting, but
it's a fleeting 
phenomenon.  Mass alliances only last when everyone stays happy, and that 
 never lasts for long.  I was preparing for the possibility of a
four-power assault on 
 Russia and Germany while Turkey and Italy fended off a maverick Austria
when my 
 "friend" behind the Iron Curtain dropped me a copy of a note he had
received, a note from 
 Austria:
<blockquote>
<i>Hey, I know we have not been allies in the past or very good ones
at that,
but any help would be greatly appreciated.</i>
