Welcome to the Spring 1997 Movement Issue Pouch Deposits (and sorry
for the delay in getting them out).
<p>
Manus generally throws out a topic of dicussion for the next issue
in the Pouch Deposits.  Because I had to leave town unexpectedly,
I knew I wouldn't get the Deposits done by the time the issue went
to press, so I included a description of the topic of discussion 
for the next issue in the <a href="About.html">About the Pouch</a>
column.  Take a look there, if you haven't already.
<p>
And now, without further delay, here are this issue's Pouch Deposits

The Discussion Topic Presented in the Last Issue<br>
(Spring stabs vs. Fall stabs)
</H3>
<HR>
<H3>From Hanz Johansson
(<a href="mailto:hanz@ts.umu.se">hanz@ts.umu.se</a>)</H3>
Regarding stabs:
<P>
My rule of thumb regarding stabs are easy. In spring stab for position and
in the fall stab for centers. Because this is also the most obvious
disregarding this rule is also smart (hm..being a dippie player is hard,
isn't it?)
<P>
Classical spring stabs are MAO-IRI as France, Mun-Bur as Germany, Sev-BLA
and Ank-BLA as Russia or Turkey. I seldom make a spring stab unless the
stab gives me a center in the fall and almost never if the person I stab is
likely to receive a build in the fall even if I stab him. 
<P>
Since spring stabs are easier to forgive I like to make positional advances
toward my ally in the spring and then retreat in the fall. If you motivate
your small spring stab with that you had recieved evil news regarding your
allys plan and just wanted to protect yorurself your moves will be
forgiven. My experience is that the trust you loose from the stab is gained
tenfold from your unconditional retreat. 
<P>
Regarding stabs in general it is important to understand why you make the
stab. To stab someone just because you might gain a center is not very
smart. If you just stab to gain a center you will have to stab all the time
and will soon find that you have made your ally a enemy and in the long
term gained nothing. Remember one important thing - when you stab a ally
you might gain a center or two but you also gain something less pleasant,
his anger. You can count on him using his remaining untits to hurt you and
this might prove to be devastating.
<P>
As I see it there are several diffrent reaosons for and stab, for example: 
The big game winning stab - This stab is the best since its goal is to take
a solo victory. Not stabing when a victory is certain is to me not only bad
play but defies the purpose of the game. Diplomacy is a hard game and not
playing to ones full potential is short of cheating.
<P>
The stupid stab - Unfortunatly too common. This is a stab that have no
chance of success or its success is extremly temporary.
<P>
The probing stab - See earlier in the article. A stab to gain trust instead
of centers or position.
<P>
The Illusion of a stab - Sometime you might fool the others into thinking
that you and your ally has broken up and one make a fake stab on the other.
If you and your ally want to change centers this might be done by faking
these stab that really arn't a stab.
<P>
The sensible stab - A well, planned, timed and executed stab. Lovely.
<P>
A perfect stab is wonderful to make and horrible to recieve but stabs are
vital to the game. Not stabbing leads to predictive and boring play.
Remember - Paranoia is a way of life.

In response to the mailbag question I have a Russian anecdote.
<P>
The game began with a Turkish-Austrian war (big surprise), France went anti-Italian from 
the start and England and Germany were doing some petty squabbling.  The most annoying 
thing to me, the Russian, was the strong German-French non-aggression pact that to the 
end-game never broke.  
<P>
As Russia I was doing extremely well at working Turkey and Austria against each other 
and away from me. While growing in scandinavia and fighting off the Germans by working 
the English against him.  
<P>
However I was in such good graces with Turkey, without actually helping him, that once 
he owned Greece and Bulgaria he had situated A Bul, A Con, A Alb, F Gre, F Aeg in the 
Fall of 1902.  I had worked this out with Italy, who was afraid of Turkey, especially 
since Italy wasn't even holding his own against France and Austria believed him when 
Turkey told him he was going after Italy.  I had F Rum, A Mos, and A Gal and I built A 
Sev.  Since it was an army Turkey didn't even bat an eyebrow but when the spring came, I 
convinced him to move F Aeg - Ion, F Gre - Adr, A Bul - Gre and A Con - Bul and I moved 
F Rum - Bla, A Sev - Arm, and A Mos - Sev thereby guaranteeing both Smyrna and Ankara in 
the Fall with two armies.  Poor Turkey ended up in Greece being supported by France and 
Myself against the other.
<P>
BTW I did end up winning that game by taking all of Austria and most of Germany before 
the French could.

As the season to stab; its better to stab in the fall because spring is a
season of celebrating renewal and you don't want to ruin such a joyful time
for another player.
<H3>From Alexander K. ("Smiley") Woo
(<a href="mailto:Alexander.K.Woo@williams.edu">Alexander.K.Woo@williams.edu</a>)</H3>
	This remains the only successful major stab I ever made, as well
as my only solo win.  I was playing Germany.  I stabbed England.  At the
beginning of 1908, England owned (Bel, Edi, Lon, Lvp).  After 1908,
England owned (Bre, Edi, Lon, Lvp).  I will let the judge output (taken
from the history) tell the rest.  (Note that I had to make sure France
would order a par - pic; if i remember correctly, i told him that i might
support the move.)
<p>
	This stab illustrates a couple points about Fall stabs.  First of
all, a Fall stab usually does not gain many SCs but rather sets up for the
next year.  (I convoyed to both Lon and Edi in 1909.)  A Fall stab
frequently does not force a disband, but rather limits the builds that the
stabbee will get from gains in another theatre.  This way, the stabbee has
moved his units away from his home SCs, without getting any builds to defend
them.  Occasionally, one may even set up a Fall stab when the stabbee will
have a build, if the build will still be insufficient for putting up a
defense.
<p>
	Another advantage to this type of Fall stab is that the units of the
stabbee are likely to be tangled up with those of his (former) enemy, and
this may take some time to disentangle, especially if there is a lack of
trust between them.

My brother is a Japanese minor, so I showed him the link. Here's his 
reply to me:
<p>
&gt; 	Play by Email's masterpiece can be called Deipuromashii<br>
&gt; [Diplomacy, the English word was written phonetically in Japanese].  In<br>
&gt; the first place, the next Great War of Europe [word to smudged to read]<br>
&gt; happened in the diplomacy, war board game.  The board game's true form is<br>
&gt; intermost secret [literally heart main point or heart secrecy: this word<br>
&gt; is hard to translate] (in Japan this is sold by Hobby Japan).  Each<br>
&gt; individual makes his own next move and sends it by E-mail.  The<br>
&gt; consequences of the battles will be returned.  Let's start doing it.<br>

<h3 align=center>Mail Received About the Hobby Awards<BR>
</H3>
<HR>
<H3>From Vince Mous
(<a href="mailto:vim2@rocketmail.com">vim2@rocketmail.com</a>)</H3>
  I just read your article about the Pouch and the hobby in general and 
wholeheartedly agree that we should have email Awards. Actually, we 
already have something similar with the 'Hall of Fame', 'Diplomacy Skill 
Index' and now the 'Modern Hall of Fame' for my Modern variant. Along 
with the invitational games in which the best players of each game play, 
these already give the players something to strive for. Perhaps there 
should be a more tangible reward such as a plaque, or something, but as 
this is an Online hobby, perhaps an online 'plaque' at the Pouch would 
be sufficient. 
<p>
  But we could use awards for other things, such as 'Award for Special 
Contribution to PBEM/Judge Diplomacy' (could be several), 'Best Judge', 
'Best GM', 'Rookie of the Year', 'Best Dip Web Page', 'Best EZine', 
'Best Judge Modification', 'Best Pouch Article', and... 'Best (New) 
Judge Variant?' :-) 
<p>
  The Modern HoF 1996 Award goes to Erik Stensland as the best player of 
1996, so if you make an Awards page, let me know and I'll give you the 
appropriate link.
<p>
  I'd also like to nominate David Norman for 'Special Contribution' for 
developing both mapper for windows, which is invaluable for playing 
judge dip (whoever wrote mapit should also be nominated), and now the 
mapmaker program. I'd also like to nominate Nick Fitzpatrick for the 
same category for running the HoF all these years, and helping with the 
judge code etc... If you need more names I can keep on going! :-)
<p>
<b><i>[Editor's response: My own personal view is that any PBEM Hobby
awards should not be run by The Pouch, as there would be too much of 
a conflict of interest.  That's not to say that people from the Pouch can't
be involved with the awards, but simply that they shouldn't be specifically
associated with The Pouch.  What I'd love to see is a small group of
people getting together to decide on a set of awards, a nomination
procedure, and a judging procedure.  If any readers are interested
in getting involved, post a message to r.g.d. with a call for participation
on an awards committee.  I'd love to see something together in time to
have a set of 1997 PBEM Hobby Awards.]</i></b>

I've been looking at the new stuff you guys have done at DP and I 
think its terrific.  The registration forms and the queue are pretty 
cool.
<p>
One question:  What have you and Simon done, or thought about 
preservation of the DP html, cgi, etc. files?  What would happen if 
you were to disappear from the Earth, or suffer a stroke and not give 
a shit about Dip any more.  Are the source files being archived 
somewhere else that Simon or someone else could access?
<p>
When a project gets to be this size, and of this much importance to a 
community, preparation must be made so that it is not dependent on 
one person for survival.
<p>
(BTW, I'm not volunteering to do any of this, mind you, just wondering 
if this is an issue you have considered.  As a librarian, I am always 
thinking about the preservation issues.)
<p>
<b><i>[Editor's response: If anything happens to one of us, the other will
most definitely keep The Pouch going.  Not give a shit about Diplomacy?
Never!  If something happens to both of us, we've made arrangements for
all the files to be copied onto tape, have the originals deleted, and
have the tapes buried with us.  We're going to take it all with us, and
if we can't have it nobody can :-)
<p>
More seriously, we are always looking for people to join the DP Council,
and the more responsibility people want to take on, the more help it is
to us.  We'd be thrilled to have somebody with enough interest to be 
able to take on the reins should it be necessary.]</i></b>

Outstanding is all I can say!  I thoroughly enjoyed reading the articles
about DipCon.  Man, what I wouldn't do to play people at the top of the
Dip world!  I know that I'd probably get my butt kicked, but it would
be so much fun finding out where I would stand against these guys!  I
am rarely eliminated in PBEM Dip, but I realize that FTF is a whole
different creature.
