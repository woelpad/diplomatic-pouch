<td>Larry Peery, who met my daughter Anna briefly when she was four months old,
offered the opinion that perhaps people were tired of looking at my mug in all these
Zine articles, and suggested that it might be nice for me to start putting up
pictures of my daughter.  I've taken Larry's suggestion.  Since she's still growing,
I can put a new picture up with each issue so that people don't get bored of seeing
the same picture every time, and since she's far cuter than I am, it's a win-win
situation for readers.  Anna was born on March 6th, 1996; the picture shown at the left
was taken in early February when she was right around 11 months old.
