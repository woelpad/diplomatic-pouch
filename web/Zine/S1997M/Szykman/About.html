About The Diplomatic Pouch

<HR>
Happy New Year, and welcome back to the Zine.  We've got a nice plump
issue for you so I'll keep this brief.
<p>
Diplomacy Legend Manus Hand is currently in Sweden, with Diplomacy
World Champion Pitt Crandlemire (quoted* as saying "Everything I learned
about playing Diplomacy I learned from The Pouch"), who is defending his title whilst
I type, and Larry Peery, another regular contributor.  I was hoping to get
a late breaking update about what's been happening there, but no word yet.
<p>
<i>(* Fake quote)</i>
Next, I'd personally like to thank all the people who contributed to this
issue, particularly the first-time contributors who responded to Manus'
call for more contributions last issue.
<p>
Lastly, Manus usually uses the Pouch Deposits section to set up a theme for
replies for the following issue.  I'd like to do something similar here, but
I'd like to take input from readers and compile it into an article instead of
just next issue's Pouch Deposits.
<p><b>The Idea</b><br>
I'd like to write an article entitled <i>Double-Barreled Shotgun Openings</i>,
the "shotgun" indicating "fast" and the "double" part referring to two powers.
The idea is this:  Pick a pair of powers on the standard map.  Then pick a
third power adjacent to them.  Assume the first two powers are completely
allied and trust one another completely.  Assume they want to eliminate the
third power, and further assume that they have each convinced their own
neighbors to remain peaceful so that they can dedicate all their forces
against this third power.
<p>
Now assume that the third power does a typical opening (several powers have
more than one typical opening, so pick your favorite one).  How should the
first two powers move to most quickly eliminate the third?  Most likely,
the third power will know he's in trouble by the end of Spring 1901, and
if not, definitely by the end of the Fall.  Accordingly, you'll have to
assume he'll do whatever he can to defend himself.
<p>
What I'm asking people to do is work out a scenario for a full-steam attempt
by two powers to eliminate a third, and send me the moves.  How quickly
can two powers guarantee the elimination of the third (still assuming that
no other powers get involved in either side of the conflict)?  By 1903?  1904?
It will depend on the choice of powers.
<p>
To get a rough idea of what I'm talking about, read Edi Birsan's article about
the <a href="/Zine/S1997M/Birsan/Sealion.html">Sealion Opening</a>, which gave me the
idea of the Double-Barreled Shotgun Openings.  However, he doesn't carry the
scenario out to it's completion, and FG vs. E is one of the less complicated
ones.
<p>
Pick any trio of neighboring powers and give it a try.  Note that trios include
EFG, IFG, IGA, GAR, ART, AIT, etc., and each trio will have one to three permutations
for a Double-Barreled Shotgun Opening depending on who neighbors who.
<p>
So there's the challenge.  Email me your ideas, and I'll have something put
together for the next issue.  I hope you enjoy this issue of The Pouch!
