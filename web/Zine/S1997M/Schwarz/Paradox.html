<H3>Introduction</H3>
As far as I can tell, all Diplomacy paradoxes stem from non-simultaneity
introduced into what is an otherwise simultaneous game.  In particular,
these paradoxes arise when the success of one type of move is made
contingent on the success of another move <b>during the same turn</b>.  Not
all contingent movement is rife with paradox, of course.  Successful
movement of a unit is in some sense contingent on the success or failure of
other units.  In Spring 1901, <tt>A&nbsp;Mar-Pie</tt> will fail if
<tt>A&nbsp;Ven-Pie</tt> is also ordered, but will succeed otherwise.  However,
the resolution of these events <b>is</b> simultaneous, in that we don't look
at whether <tt>A&nbsp;Ven-Pie</tt> succeeds <i>before</i> deciding the fate
of <tt>A&nbsp;Mar</tt>.
<P>
However, any rule in Diplomacy -- like the dislodgment rule for disrupting
convoys or the various Suez Canal control rules in Colonial Diplomacy --
which make the success of one unit's actions contingent on the <b>success</b>
of some other event during the same season will kill simultaneity and
introduce room for paradox.  This is a subtle distinction, which I may not
be making clear enough, but consider the famous convoy paradoxes, such as
Pandin's Paradox, which all rely on the issue of whether the convoyed units
can cut the very support needed to ensure the success of their convoys, to
beleaguer a garrison, and so on.  If the fleet is disrupted, the convoy fails,
making the army's move contingent on the success of the convoy move.
Unlike a bounce resolution, we now have to see if the convoy succeeds
before we can move the convoyed army.  So, if we decide it does succeed and
transport the army across the water, it can have an impact on the
adjudication we had to perform to determine if the convoy succeeded.  This
is what I mean my non-simultaneous contingency.
<P>
Since the Diplomacy convoy has been repeatedly analyzed, I would like to cite
two new milieu in which the rules introduce non-simultaneous contingency and how
that leads to paradox. From Colonial Diplomacy, I'll use the Suez Canal rule as
an example. And from Machiavelli, I'll discuss the Sicilian Straits rule  (known
as the "Piombino/Sicilian Straits" rule in the first edition of Machiavelli).
<P>
<H3>Part 1: Schwarz's Suez Paradox</H3>
Consider the following rules from Hasbro's Colonial Diplomacy:
<blockquote><i>
"9.31 You must have a unit in Egypt the entire turn in order to use the canal"
<p>
"9.33 The unit in Egypt may have an attack order so long as it results in a
standoff and the unit in Egypt stays in Egypt."
</i></blockquote>
Clearly, this introduces non-simultaneous contingency.  The attack may be
ordered but it must result in a stand off, meaning we need to resolve the
move from Egypt before we can determine the success or failure of a move
through the canal.  This opens the door for what I modestly have named
Schwarz's Suez Paradox.  For example,
<P>
<center><table border>
<tr><th><img src=colmap1.gif>
<tr><td valign=top><pre>
England: Army Egypt -> Mecca.
England: Army Syria SUPPORT Army Egypt -> Mecca.

Turkey: Army Arabia-Mecca.
Turkey: Fleet Red Sea SUPPORT Army Arabia -> Mecca.
</table></center><P>

If the unit in Egypt were not required to stay put by rule 9.33, this would
be easily resolved; the Med-Red move would cut the Red Sea's support and
Egypt would move to Mecca having two strength to Arabia's one.
<P>
However, by rule 9.33 and rule 9.31, we know that this easy resolution
would result in the Mediterranean fleet <b>not</b> being able to use the Suez
Canal because that would allow the unit in Egypt to leave, violating 9.31,
and thus <b>not</b> preventing the attack on the Red Sea fleet.
<P>
So, then the Red Sea's support is <b>not</b> cut, which means both Egypt and
Arabia move to Mecca with strength of two, resulting in a standoff.
<P>
Which, by Rule 9.33, means the move from the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea
<b>is</b> legal, which means the support <b>is</b> cut, which means the
Egyptian move succeeds, which means the support is <b>not</b> cut, <i>ad
infinitum</i>.
<P>
But it gets worse!
<blockquote><i>
"9.36 If a superior force dislodges the unit controlling Egypt, a fleet
ordered to use the canal will be prevented from doing so."
</i></blockquote>
Again, we've introduced non-simultaneous contingency.  Just like a convoy's
dislodgment determining the success or failure of a convoyed armies move,
now the dislodgment of a unit in Egypt determines the success or failure of
a "Suezing" units move.  This creates the Schwarz-Woo Paradox, found by
Andy Schwarz (me), with assistance from Alexander K. ("Smiley") Woo.
Consider the following:
<P>
<center><table border>
<tr><th><img src=colmap2.gif>
<tr><td><pre>
Russia: Fleet Mediterranean Sea -> Red Sea.
Russia: Fleet Egypt Hold.

England: Army Sudan -> Egypt
England: Fleet Red Sea SUPPORT Army Sudan -> Egypt.

Turkey: Army Syria-Egypt.
Turkey: Army Mecca SUPPORT Army Syria -> Egypt.
</table></center><P>
If we ignore the 9.36 rule, the move by the Mediterranean fleet cuts the
support of the English fleet in the Red Sea on Egypt, making the Sudan army
attack with a strength of one and thus allowing the Turkish assault, with
strength two to succeed.  This of course, dislodges Egypt.  However, now we
need to
consider rule 9.36, which says that dislodging Egypt invalidates
<tt>F&nbsp;Med-Red</tt>.
So the support of Red Sea is <b>not</b> cut, which means both England and
Turkey attack with strength two, which invokes the beleaguered garrison rule,
meaning Egypt is <b>not</b> dislodged.  So, thus we <b>should</b> allow the
<tt>Med-Red</tt>
order to go through after all, which in effect, dislodges Egypt.  Once again,
repeat <i>ad infinitum</i>.
<P>
One solution for these two paradoxes is to add a rule which says that a
"Suezing" unit cannot cut support of a unit in the Red Sea (or Med Sea) that is
supporting an action in or into Egypt.  This is how the convoy paradox was
removed in standard Diplomacy (saying that a convoyed unit does not cut the
support of any unit supporting an action into a body of water), but the result
is that one can interpret this to mean that even if the Red Sea is
<b>dislodged</b> its
support is not cut.  For an example of this, consider the same set up as
above, but now add an additional Russian Fleet in Eritrea:
<P>
<center><table border>
<tr><th><img src=colmap3.gif>
<tr><td><pre>
Russia: Fleet Mediterranean Sea -> Red Sea.
Russia: Fleet Egypt Hold.
Russia: Fleet Eritrea SUPPORT Fleet Mediterranean Sea -> Red Sea.

England: Army Sudan -> Egypt
England: Fleet Red Sea SUPPORT Army Sudan -> Egypt.

Turkey: Army Syria-Egypt.
Turkey: Army Mecca SUPPORT Army Syria -> Egypt.
</table></center><P>

If you don't prevent Suezing units from cutting support of units in the
Red or Med Seas, the paradoxes will remain, but if we do interpret it this
way, we get a "Ghost Ship" problem where a dislodged fleet ends up adding
valid support, which is unsavory from an intuitive point of view.  In the
above adjudication, for example, a blanket prohibition on Suezing fleets
cutting support would mean that <tt>Med-Red</tt> succeeds and dislodges the
English fleet in the Red Sea but that the dislodged Red Sea fleet still provides
support for the move from Sudan into Egypt.  Otherwise, we're back in a
paradoxical loop.

<H3>Part 2: Schwarz's Straits Paradox</H3>
Machiavelli has a similar problem.  Although Avalon Hill's second edition
removes the straits around Piombino (from which this example
is derived), the Sicilian Straits at Messina remains (and the Judge's
implementation still use the first edition), so this has more than just
curiosity value.
<P>
The First Edition Rules state:
<blockquote><i>
Piombino: This province includes the offshore island of Elba.  A  fleet in
this province controls the straits between the mainland  and the island.
An army unit in this province does not control  the straits.  The straits
are not a separate sea, but are part  of the Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea.  If
they are not controlled by  a Fleet unit in Piombino, a hostile Fleet could
move directly  from Pisa to the Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea or vice versa, or
transport an army from one to the other.
<P>
Sicily: A fleet in Messina similarly controls the straits between Messina
and Otranto.  As long as there is a fleet in Messina, no hostile fleet
could move directly from the Gulf of Naples to the Messina and Otranto.  As
long as there is a fleet in Messina, no hostile fleet could move directly
from the Gulf of Naples to the Ionian Sea or vice versa.
<P>
If a fleet successfully advances into Piombino or Messina in the same turn
as a hostile fleet attempts to use the straits, the movement  through the
straits is blocked.  As long as a fleet unit is in the controlling
province, no other player's units may use the straits  without the
controlling player's permission.  If a player wishes to  allow another
player to use the straits, he must include an "alliance  power" command
with his movement orders.
</i></blockquote>
The second ediion rules run as follows:
<blockquote><i>
Also, a Fleet (not an Army) in Messina controls the straits between 
Messina and Otranto.  As long as there is a Fleet in Messina, no enemy 
fleet may advance from the Ionian Sea to the Gulf of Naples, or vice versa, 
or convoy an Army through one of these seas to the other.
</i></blockquote>
Notice again how this rule introduces non-simultaneous contingency, namely
the status of any unit "using" either strait (for movement or support) is
contingent on who <b>ends</b> the turn in the critical space.  Focusing on
Piombino, consider Schwarz's Straits Paradox:
<P>
<center><table border>
<tr><th><img src=machmap1.gif>
<tr><td><pre>
France: Fleet Pisa SUPPORT Fleet Piombino -> Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea.  (*blocked*)
France: Fleet Piombino -> Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea.

Naples: Fleet Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea Hold.
Naples: Fleet Sienna -> Piombino.
</pre>
(The term blocked is used by the judge to indicate that an otherwise legal
move is disallowed because the unit in question did not have permission
from the owner of the critical space for controlling the Straits).
</table></center><P>
Note that <b>Naples</b> owns Piombino because it gets control of it during
the course of the turn, as proper according the second paragraph above.
However, if
Naples has control of the Straits, then Pisa is effectively blocked from
supporting into East Tyrrhenian Sea, because Pisa and the Eastern Tyrrhenian
Sea are only contiguous if the player is allied with the Piombino owner.
This is why the Pisan order is marked as <tt>(*blocked*)</tt>, indicating Pisa
was <b>not</b> granted permission to use the straits for support.  So, in
theory, the move by France from Piombino <b>ought</b> to have failed, since
its support was blocked/invalidated.  But in that case,
<tt>F&nbsp;Sienna-Piombino</tt> would bounce,
leaving Piombino in French hands.  Of course, that would make the support
by Pisa valid, dislodging the ETS fleet, and vacating Piombino, thus allowing
Sienna into Piombino.  But that would invalidate the support, killing the
attack, and so on, <i>ad infinitum</i>.  The Classic "Non-Simultaneity Paradox"
is seen here in all its glory.
<P>
In response to this paradox (which really came up in a judge game I was
moderating), Charlie Eldred,
posed a different sort of paradox arising from the same set of rules.  All
of the paradoxes I have discussed until now involve loops of inconsistent
logic.  Jamie Dreier, Professor of Philosophy at Brown University and an
all-star Diplomacy player, makes the analogy with the liars paradox:
<blockquote>
        L:      This sentence, L, is false.
</blockquote>

The adjudication of a Diplomacy (or Machiavelli) turn is akin to
determining which of a series of statements are true (moves succeed) and
which are false (moves fail).  Statement L cannot be properly adjudicated.
Assume it is true, then it is false (it says it is false, after all).  But
if it is false, then it is true.  Jamie calls this an ungrounded and
paradoxical statement.  This is the Schwarz's Suez paradox (and the
Pandin's Paradox and the rest) in a nutshell.
<P>
However, following S. Kripke's landmark paper, "Outline of a Theory of
Truth," Jamie offers up a second type of paradox (or quasi-paradox) which
is ungrounded but not (technically) paradoxical.  For example, consider the
following statement:
<blockquote>
        T:      This sentence, T, is true.
</blockquote>

On the surface, it seems simple enough.  If it is true, then it is true.
<i>Viola.</i>  Except, what if we say it is false?  Then it is also false.
So it
is ungrounded (we have no other way to determine if it is true or false)
but it is not paradoxical, because once we assume it is true (or false) it
remains true (or false).
<P>
The Eldred Piombino Paradox is this sort of quasi-paradox (an ungrounded,
non-paradoxical move with two equally valid adjudications), as seen below:
<P>
<center><table border>
<tr><th><img src=machmap2.gif>
<tr><td><pre>
France: Fleet Pisa -> Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea. (*blocked*????)
France: Fleet Piombino SUPPORT Fleet Pisa -> Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea.

Naples: Fleet Sienna -> Piombino.
Naples Fleet Eastern Tyrrhenian Sea SUPPORT Fleet Sienna -> Piombino
</table></center><P>

The move Sienna to Piombino cuts the Piombino fleets support of Pisa-ETS,
without question.
<P>
If we assume Piombino is successfully dislodged by the supported attack
from Sienna, then the support of ETS is not cut, and the Piombino fleet is
legally dislodged, fully consistent with our assumption of dislodgment.
<P>
But if we say ETS's support <b>is</b> cut by Pisa, then Piombino is not
dislodged, cutting the support by ETS, again fully consistent with the
assumptions of cut support.
<P>
So, rather than creating an infinite and unresolvable loop (a paradox),
Charlie has created two equally valid solutions, which are contradictory
(an ungrounded statement).
<P>
Nonetheless, both the Schwarz's Straits paradox and the Eldred Piombino
Quasi-Paradox are the result of a non-simultaneous contingency, in this
case who <b>ends</b> the turn in Piombino (or similarly, in Messina for the
Sicilian version).

<H3>Part 3: What Do We Do?</H3>
I think that introducing more conditional, non-simultaneous moves into Diplomacy
via Colonial's Suez (in addition to the long-standing convoys) was a step in the
wrong direction.
Removing such moves, as we've seen in the removal of the
Piombino Straits rule with the release of the second edition of Machiavelli (but
which sadly remains in the Sicilian Straits), is the correct approach.
The rule on using
the Suez canal (or the Sicilian Straits) should be something to the effect of:
"To use or permit the use of the Suez canal (Sicilian Straits), a power must
start the turn with a unit in Egypt (Messina)."

That's it -- no
rules on bouncing or having to stay in Egypt the whole turn.  The can of
worms that the current rules open is far worse than any benefits of perceived
realism.  By making use in Fall conditional only on the status at the end
of Spring retreats (Colonial actually uses years rather than seasons, but you
get the idea) or Spring moves conditional only on the status at the end of
winter, you do not introduce non-simultaneity/contingency, and thus you
avoid paradoxes like the Schwarz Suez and the Schwarz-Woo.   Ditto on the
Schwarz Straits and the Eldred Piombino.
<P>
The only other solution is to live with the paradoxes, which is often phrased as
"All units involved hold." However, try neatly defining "all units involved" and
you need an algorithm that boggles my mind, though it does exist. My feeling is
that we are stuck with convoy issues because the game is over 35 years old and
convoys have been there since 1959. But, we ought to root out the Suez evil
while the game is still young, and fix things in Machiavelli while the second
edition is still hot off the press.   Heck, if we can add a land bridge to
Sakhalin, we can change the Suez rule a tiny bit, replacing 9.31 with "You must
have a unit in Egypt at the start of the turn in order to use the canal" and
eliminating 9.33, 9.36, and perhaps the now innocuous but unneeded 9.37.
<P>
By the way, when I first brought the Suez paradox to the attention of
Avalon Hill, they seemed ready to make a quick fix via <i>The General</i>.
However, after Smiley and I developed the second paradox, AH told me they
had gone back to the designer to rework things, and a pronouncement would
eventually follow.
<P>
Has anyone had seen such a pronouncement? I have not.

<H3>Part 4: The Trans-Siberian Railroad</H3>
In case anyone was wondering about the Trans-Siberian
Railroad rule in Colonial Diplomacy, here's a short analysis:
<P>
Rule 9.23 begins by saying "A unit using the TSR may only be transported to
an unoccupied province."  If we interpret this to mean that it is not even
valid to order a unit on the TSR to attempt to enter a space that **began**
the turn as occupied, then I do not think the TSR order will create
paradoxes, because since TSR units are never allowed to reach an SC that is
occupied, it is impossible to use TSRs to cut support, dislodge other
untis, or to support a beleaguered garrison, which are the main causes of
paradoxes through non-simultaneous contigency.
<P>
Assuming my interpretation of 9.23 is correct and TSR units can't be
ordered to spaces that begin the turn as occupied, then the TSR rule
basically just makes the TSR unit get to make a series of mini-moves
contingent only on the success of its <b>own</b> previous mini-moves.
Therefore, it is possible that the TSR has avoided the pitfalls of the
Suez Canal.
<P>
However, it has been pointed out to me that Avalon Hill (in <i>The General</i>,
Volume 30, Number 4) has clarified that TSR units <b>can</b> attempt to
enter occupied
provinces in the hope that they become unoccupied as the turn moves on.
This would normally open up some interesting paradoxes.  Consider the
simple:
<pre>
China: Army Krasnoyarsk -> Mongolia.
China: Army Mongolia -> Irkutsk.

Russia: Army Omsk TSR Irkutsk
</pre>
This normally would allow for a paradox:  If Omsk bounces Mongolia-Irkutsk,
then Krasnoyarsk cannot leave and so the TSR cnnot go through, so it does
not bounce Irkutsk, so Krasnoyarsk <b>can</b> leave, so it does go through,
so it bounces, so Kra stays, so the TSR move fails, etc.
<P>
However, and very wisely I might add, Avalon Hill added the following
proviso and example:
<blockquote><i>
  9.25 - A curious example of this rule applies if an enemy unit attacks
  from one province to antoher along the line of the TSR at the same time
  that a Russian unit is railed through these provinces in the same
  dircetion, such as:
<p>
  Russia - A VLA-TSR-OMSK
<P>
  China A KRA-OMSK
<P>
  This results in a standoff in Omsk.  The Chinese unit stays in
  Krasnoyarsk and the Russian unit stays in Irkutsk.  The theory being that
  Krasnoyarsk is left empty by the Chinese at the same time the Russian
  unit moves through.  Thus both units attack Omsk ands cause a standoff.
</i></blockquote>
In other words, the very <b>attempt</b> (and not the success) of a unit to
leave a space is enough for the TSR to be allowed to <b>try</b> to get through.
Notice that by linking the success of the TSR's attempt to move to attempted
movement, rather than successful movement, rule 9.25 turns non-simultaneous
contigent movement into standard Diplomacy movement.  By 9.25, in my
example above, the TSR is allowed to try its luck in Irkutsk and it fails,
bouncing Mongolia, which bounces Krasnoyarsk and no one moves.  Paradox
avoided.
<P>
However, while I think that this successfully avoid paradoxes, it creates a
situation where I unit can jump over a foreigner on the TSR, or so it
seems.  Consider the Avalon Hill example in rule 9.25, but with a slight
twist:
<pre>
Russia: Army Irkutsk TSR Omsk.
Russia: Army Perm SUPPORT Army Irkutsk TSR Omsk.

China: Army Krasnoyarsk -> Omsk.
</PRE>
As far as I can tell, this is a fully legal move and Russia's Irkutsk army is
allowed to try for Omsk because China tried to vacate Krasnoyask.  And now,
Russia has legal support (it is legal to support a TSR'ing unit into a
vacant square, just not to support an TSR'ed attack on a unit), so Russia
<b>gets</b> Omsk.  So Krasnoyark stays in place and the Russian has leap-frogged
over the Chinese unit on the TSR route.  And if you scoff at this and say
that's ridiculous, that the general rule of no leapfrogging has precedence,
remember if you try to resolve this without that 9.25 interpretation, you
trade this silly result for a paradox without any resolution. Which is
better: ridiculous consistency or non-ridiculous unresolvability?
<P>
Finally, let me add an interesting side effect of this rule.  In the
sitution above, if China had ordered its army in Krasnoyarsk to hold, the
TSR move would have failed and the Irkutsk army would not have been allowed to
move.  So in this case, while this is not an adjudication paradox, we have
a situation in which if China <b>tries</b> to bounce Russia, Russia does not
bounce, but if it does not try to bounce it, Russia does bounce.  This is a
very deep thing, beyond the scope of this article.  I think this is like
the Zen belief of only getting something you want if you really don't want
it, and I will leave the TSR here for others to ponder.
