<i>Amos Anon:</i>
<A HREF="Anon/NoHolds.html">No Holds Barred</a></b><dd>
Amos tells us the story of a recent game among friends.  Doubtless we've
all found ourselves in similar circumstances, but it's worth a read
nonetheless.

If you're half as curious as we were about the Pouch readership, you'll
head for Simon's summary of the reader survey and read it...well...half as
fast as we did, I guess.

<i>Joseph Wheeler:</i>
<A HREF="Wheeler/Clausewitz.html">On Diplomacy</a></b><dd>
One of the all-time classic works on warfare is taken apart chapter by

informative reading.

<i>Andy Schwarz:</i>
<A HREF="Schwarz/Paradox.html">Diplomacy Paradoxes</A></b><dd>
Diplomacy is a simple game, but over the years, some nefarious little problems
have been exposed.  Andy takes us on a tour of some of the latest discoveries,

<i>John Pitre:</i>
<A HREF="Pitre/Royale.html">Diplomacy Royale</A></b><dd>
Ever wondered why the number of female Diplomacy players is so low
compared to males?  Maybe it's because until John Pitre came along,
the game just didn't offer enough pain of childbirth.  His Royale
variant addresses this deficiency nicely.

<A HREF="Pearson/Curtain.html">When the Iron Curtain Falls</A></b><dd>
