"Incredible!" came the cry from Colonel Sykes, as he heard Sherlock 
Holmes proclaim that he had solved
<a href=/Zine/S2002M/Holmes/Blind.html>The Missing Master's Mystery</a>.
"I find it unbelievable that you could accomplish this!" 
<p align=justify>
"Quite believable, my dear Colonel. A fascinating exercise in 
retrograde analysis, I must say, but quite soluble. If you would like, I would 
be happy to explain to you how the conundrum was resolved." 
<p align=justify>
"Please, Holmes!" came the reply. And with that, our little group 
returned to the library, where Holmes had laid a Diplomacy board on the 
large reading table, along with the notes on the game that Colonel Sykes 
had provided. 
<p align=justify>
"The problem, gentlemen, was simply to deduce, from the spare 
information left by the esteemed Captain Meriwether -- who was hastily called 
into Her Majesty's service and away from the game -- the position of the 
pieces currently on the board, so that Colonel Sykes could take over as 
Game Master of a particular ongoing Diplomacy game. 
<p align=justify>
"This exercise is necessary, and player information cannot be relied 
upon, because the game in question is 'blind,' meaning that each player 
is only informed of the existence of any unit that comes adjacent to one 
of his own home supply centres or one of his own units." 
<p align=justify>
"Yes, yes; we know all this, Holmes," I protested, eager to see if my 
friend had indeed been able to accomplish what seemed so impossible to 
me. 
<p align=justify>
"A necessary preamble, Watson. Colonel, do you agree that this is the 
task at hand, and that my description of the variant in use is 
accurate?" 
<p align=justify>
"I do," said the Colonel matter-of-factly. I could tell that Colonel 
Sykes, too, was anxious for Holmes to begin his explanation. 
<p align=justify>
"That is well. I wished merely to double-check that I did not labor 
under a misapprehension of the manner in which this 'blind' game was 
conducted. Sometimes players are informed of any unit that comes adjacent to 
any <i>territory</i> within their border, not simply of units that come 
adjacent to their home supply centres." 
<p align=justify>
"Yes, Holmes, I am aware of that mode of play. But your description of 
this game's parameters is accurate. A player cannot 'see' another 
player's unit unless it is adjacent to one of the player's own home supply 
centres or to one of the player's own units." 
<p align=justify>
"This is important, Colonel, so forgive my continued questioning, but I 
must be sure that I interpreted the rules of the variant correctly." 
<p align=justify>
Colonel Sykes was growing impatient. "Ask away, Holmes, but I know you 
are well aware of the standard mode of 'blind' play here at the Club. 
This game adheres to those rules, to the letter." 
<p align=justify>
"I am sure it does, Colonel, but for our friend Watson's benefit, then, 
allow me to make two further enquiries, after which we shall then begin 
to bring some light to the cloudy situation. First, am I to understand 
that at the beginning of the game, the German player cannot 'see' the 
Russian army that begins the game in Warsaw?" 
<p align=justify>
"Yes, Holmes. The army in Warsaw is not adjacent to any German home 
centre nor is it adjacent to a German unit. Therefore, the German cannot 
'see' the Russian army in Warsaw." 
<p align=justify>
"The fact that this army is adjacent to territories that lie within the 
German border (Silesia and Prussia) is irrelevant, then?" 
<p align=justify>
"Correct, Holmes. But of course if that unit were to move across the 
border -- successfully entering either Silesia or Prussia -- this would 
bring the unit adjacent to Berlin and perhaps Munich, and therefore the 
German player would become aware of that unit and its location." 
<p align=justify>
"Excellent," said Holmes. "My final question, Colonel, involves the 
handling of neutral (non-home) supply centres. Do they provide to their 
owners any information concerning nearby units?" 
<p align=justify>
"None at all, Holmes." 
<p align=justify>
This last question had me confused, so I stepped in to request an 
example. Holmes kindly explained as follows: "Consider, Watson, an 
Englishman who has taken ownership of Norway but who has, on a subsequent
turn, left 
Norway vacant by removing the unit westward. This English player would 
no longer be informed of any unit that may be in St. Petersburg. Not 
unless and until an English unit is otherwise within proximity of St. 
Petersburg, of course (for example, a fleet in the Barents)." 
<p align=justify>
"I see, Holmes. Neutral centres, when left vacant, do not provide their 
owners with any information on units coming adjacent to them." 
<p align=justify>
"Correct, Watson. And with those clarifications out of the way, we can 
now assist Colonel Sykes in setting up the board position." 
<p align=justify>
"Perhaps <i>you</i> can do so, Holmes, but not I! Your use of the word 'we' is 
quite improper!" 
<p align=justify>
"Tut, tut, Watson, you give yourself too little credit. You too, 
Colonel Sykes. The position is not so obfuscated as it may seem. By simple 
consideration of the testimony that Captain Meriwether provided to us, it 
soon comes clear. I am confident that you will surprise yourselves. Let 
us begin." 
<p align=justify>
Of course, I did not believe my friend, but Colonel Sykes and I did 
hope that some of Holmes's great powers of deduction would prove 
fathomable by our lesser minds, and so together we re-examined the list of
facts that Captain Meriwether had entrusted to the Colonel. We saw that 
Holmes had prefaced the list by specifying the game's current phase, and 
that he had written numbers next to each of the ten facts, as a 
referencing aid: 

<blockquote>

<li>Every neutral supply centre is now owned, and each one was occupied 
either at the beginning or conclusion of the turn just completed. 
</ol>
</td></tr></table>
</blockquote>
<p align=justify>
"Now then," said Holmes. "Which fact strikes you gentlemen as the most 
interesting place to begin?" I read over the facts again, but each 
seemed more baffling than the last. 
<p align=justify>

I was about to confess to Holmes that I had no idea where to begin, 
when the Colonel spoke. "Fact 3, Holmes," he declared.
<p align=justify>
"Well chosen, Colonel! Yes, fact 3 contains a treasure trove of 
information. It informs us that for the first three moves of the game -- 
Spring 1901, Fall 1901, and Spring 1902 -- every single one of the units on 
the board has been ordered in such a way that no player other than its 
owner has been able to 'see' the unit at all! We must bear this fact 
foremost in mind in all of our efforts. Never in the first three turns 
of the game did any unit come adjacent to a foreign unit or a foreign 
home supply centre! 
<p align=justify>
"This, of course, excepts the Italian army in Venice and the Austrian 
fleet in Trieste, which are each visible to the opponent to begin the 
game. Obviously, we immediately know from fact 3 that these two 
particular units did indeed <tt>HOLD</tt> on every one of the first
three turns. This is 
the only way that the Austrian and Italian players could still be of 
the belief that every foreign unit may have been holding on every turn." 
Holmes, at this point, had busied himself with placing an Italian army
onto Venice and an Austrian fleet into Trieste.
<p align=justify>
I was delighted with this. "Colonel! Holmes has now determined the 
position of two of the units -- at least their position before the final 
move that was made! There was an Italian army in Venice, and an Austrian 
fleet in Trieste, holding since the beginning of the game!" It seemed 
obvious now, and I immediately noticed something else. "Fact 5, Holmes! 
It tells us that only three units have ever issued a <tt>HOLD</tt> order. You 
have already identified two of them!" 
<p align=justify>
"Quite so, Watson. And determining which is the third such unit is 
equally elementary." As he spoke, he took a Russian fleet from the box and 
placed it onto the board. "You see, the fleet that began the game 
in Sevastopol could not possibly have moved on its first three turns. If it had 
moved, another player -- either Austria or Turkey -- would have become 
aware of it. This is because the only spots to which the fleet can move 
(Rumania, the Black Sea, and Armenia) are adjacent to a foreign power's 
home centre." 
<p align=justify>
"Excellent!" I exclaimed. "The third of the three units that ever issued a 
<tt>HOLD</tt> order!" 
<p align=justify>
"Indeed," Holmes replied, calmly. "But of course there is much more 
that Fact 3 has to teach us, before we move on to another fact.
It would be but a trivial undertaking to create a list of all of the 
spaces that could not be entered at all before the Fall of 1902, given
the conditions that fact 3 imposes upon us."
<p align=justify>
I was a bit taken aback by his assertion, and felt forced to interrupt. 
"How might we recognize these spaces, Holmes?" 
<p align=justify>
Holmes patiently provided this example: "Take the case of the English 
Channel, my dear Watson. Could it be entered without detection by any 
power?"
<p align=justify>
I thought about his question carefully. "Well Holmes, I suppose that 
nobody could enter the English Channel undetected. An English fleet would 
be seen by the French by virtue of the Channel's proximity to Brest, and
a French fleet could likewise be seen by the Englishman in London.
No other power's fleet could sail into the Channel, as it would obviously
be seen by both England <i>and</i> France."
<p align=justify>
 "Good show, Watson!" said Holmes. "Now perhaps with the Colonel's 
assistance, we might make a list of the rest of the spaces to which one of 
these restrictions apply."
<p align=justify>
The colonel and I proceeded to call out spaces which could not be 
entered by any power at all until the Fall of 1902, and, with Holmes' gentle 
suggestions, we eventually arrived at this list:
<blockquote>
<table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 width=100% bgcolor=#eeeeee>
<tr><th><table>
<tr><th colspan=3><u>Spaces No Unit Can Enter Before Fall, 1902</u></th></tr>
<tr><td align=center><i>English Channel</th><td align=center><i>Black Sea</th><td align=center><i>Rumania</th></tr>
<tr><td align=center><i>Armenia</th><td align=center><i>Adriatic Sea</th><td align=center><i>Galicia</th></tr>
<tr><td align=center><i>Prussia</th><td align=center><i>Silesia</th><td align=center><i>Tyrolia</th></tr>
<tr><td align=center><i>Burgundy</th><td align=center><i>Bohemia</th><td align=center><i>Piedmont</tr>
<!--
<tr><td align=center><i>Barents Sea</th>
</tr> --></table></th></tr>
</table>
</blockquote>
<p align=justify>
<!--
(The Colonel and I both protested when Holmes added the Barents Sea to
the list, as it borders only a Russian home centre,
but Holmes pointed out that since the Barents cannot be reached by a
Russian fleet in the first three moves of the game, the space does
qualify as one that we know no unit could have visited before Fall 1902.)
<p align=justify>
-->
Personally, I felt rather pleased by this accomplishment, but Holmes rushed
us forward.  "There 
is a second class of space which will become even more crucial to us, as 
you shall soon see. In addition to the spaces that cannot be entered at 
all, by any power in the game, there are many spaces on the board that can
be entered by one and only one of the powers without placing himself at
risk of detection. Perhaps you could once again provide us with an example,
Doctor?"
<p align=justify>
I thought for a long time about Holmes' question. Suddenly, I 
remembered our earlier conversation about Norway. "Norway!" I cried. "The 
Russian might travel there undetected, but any other power's presence would 
inform the Russian, because of Norway's proximity to St. Petersburg!"
<p align=justify>
"Quite right, Watson!" Holmes replied. "Now let us construct the list of
the qualifying spaces, and I suggest that we organize it by power.  We need
not list those spaces within a power's own national boundaries (Clyde,
for example), of course,
as such spaces qualify <i>de facto</i> -- only that single power could
conceivably move into such a space in the first three moves of the game."
A quick glance confirmed my friend's claim, and after some more work, we
arrived at the following list:
<blockquote>
<table width=100% bgcolor=#eeeeee>
<tr><th>
<table>
<tr><th colspan=3><u>Spaces That Only One Power May Enter Before Fall, 1902</u></th></tr>

</th></tr></table>
</blockquote>
<p align=justify>
Again, the Colonel and I were satisfied by the novel view we were getting of
the various spaces on the board Diplomacy from these studies, but Colonel Sykes
expressed a shared frustration when he exclaimed, "This is all well and good,
Holmes, but what good do these lists really do us?"
<p align=justify>
"Why, all the good in the world, my dear Colonel!" came Holmes' reply. 
"You see, we have taken the first and most important step toward 
determining to which units the good Captain referred when he wrote down fact 
number 4, which is the statement that one dozen spaces within the national
boundaries were, as he put it, 'invaded' by foreign units in Fall of 1902."
<p align=justify>
I was quite stunned. "How is that possible, Holmes?" I asked.
<p align=justify>
"There are 42 spaces which lie inside the various powers' national boundaries
on the Diplomacy board," he continued. We must simply determine which twelve
of those forty-two spaces could have been entered that season, given that not
one of the invading units was 'seen' beforehand by the invaded power. This is
not quite the tall 
order it seems. As you yourself pointed out, Watson, almost no home 
supply centres could be among the twelve invaded spaces, as their owners
would have received advance warning of the invader's advance. The only two
exceptions to this are Venice and Trieste, which both, as we have already 
established, contain potential invaders that are already seen. I shall return
to them momentarily. 
The remaining twenty home supply centres can safely be stricken from our 
list, however, leaving twenty-two possible spaces that can be entered.
We know from Captain Meriwether's notes that twelve of these were indeed
'invaded,' and the other ten were not.  Not quite as daunting a challenge
now, I would submit."
<p align=justify>
I nodded, eager for Holmes to continue. He obliged.
"Of those remaining spaces, many are surrounded entirely by either 
home centres or spaces from one of the two lists we have just drawn up,
and thus, these spaces could no 
more easily be invaded than could a home centre! For example, take the case
of Gascony. It is bordered by Spain, the Mid-Atlantic Ocean, Burgundy, 
Marseilles, Paris, and Brest. Obviously, the invasion cannot have come 
from one of France's home supply centres. Could it have come from one of 
the other three spaces? Certainly not, because a foreign unit could not have 
been in any of them without France's advance knowledge! Therefore, Gascony
can be safely eliminated as a target of foreign aggression. We can similarly
rule out Ukraine, Syria, Apulia, and all of the spaces within England's 
national borders. We are left with a very comfortable list of 15 spaces.
<!--
which I will provide for you in a moment. Before doing so, however, note
that the two lists we have already generated, will become 
invaluable to us later, so let us be sure not to 
Now, here is the list."
-->
With that, Holmes reached into his pocket and 
produced a sheet of paper with the following written on it:
<blockquote>

<p align=justify>
"Brilliant, Holmes!" I shouted excitedly. "However, we still must narrow this 
list of fifteen down to the necessary twelve invaders, and I am at a loss to
see how to do so."
<p align=justify>
I was surprised at Holmes' answer. "That we cannot do without some 
small amount of difficulty," he said. "We must first recognize that there 
is some mutual exclusivity involved in the above invasions. First, 
Trieste and Venice obviously cannot each be invaded by the unit standing
in the other, as the two would simply stand off.
So one or the other of those spaces can certainly be eliminated from our list."
<p align=justify>
"Can we know which?" I asked excitedly.
<p align=justify>
A bit hesitantly, but with a perceptible sense of excitement, the Colonel
spoke up to provide my
answer.  "I would suggest, Holmes, that it was Trieste that invaded Venice,
for this reason: from your list, we see that Tyrolia (if it is one of the
twelve) was invaded by either Italians from Venice or Germans from Munich.
If we claim that it was the Germans, then no power could have invaded Bohemia,
for Munich is the only unit available for that invasion.
Therefore, our choices become having all three of Tyrolia, Bohemia, and 
Venice invaded, or merely Trieste and Tyrolia."
<p align=justify>
Holmes broke in.  "Very good, Colonel, your logic is quite flawless!  If Venice
were to invade Trieste (rather than Trieste invading Venice), then only
one of Tyrolia or Bohemia could have been invaded.  Therefore, in resolving
this problem of mutual exclusivity that Venice and Trieste pose for us, we would
be striking <i>two</i> locations from our list (Venice and one of Tyrolia or
Bohemia) rather than <i>one</i>.  As there are still two 
other spots on the board that create conundra of mutual exclusivity
(meaning, of course, that we shall be forced to remove one space from each
of these two pairs from our list when we resolve these conundra),
then to assume that Trieste were invaded would necessarily bring our list of
fifteen spaces down to eleven, which is of course one space too few."
Pointing at the board, where he had set up the three pieces whose positions
before Fall 1902 were at this point known to us, Holmes continued.
"Thus, we know that the Austrian fleet from Trieste invaded Venice,
the Italian army from Venice invaded Tyrolia, and a German army from Munich
invaded Bohemia.
We can remove Trieste from our list of invaded locations."
Holmes struck Trieste from the list and wrote check marks on the list 
next to Tyrolia, Venice, and Bohemia as being three of the twelve invaded
locations.  He also placed a German army on the board in Bohemia, and 
moved the Italian army from Venice to Tyrolia, and
the Austrian fleet from Trieste into Venice, to update the positions of
those units to their positions after Fall 1902.
<p align=justify>
"Next," Holmes went on, "we must decide which nine of the remaining 
eleven invasions occurred. As I have hinted, we will do so by
resolving the two remaining problems of mutual exclusivity.  As we shall see,
there are two other sets of sites on the list that cannot possibly all
be invaded."
<p align=justify>
Before the Colonel and I had time to look at the list to determine where
these two situations that Holmes spoke about were located, my friend continued.
"Let us move first to the interesting case of Picardy, Ruhr, and Burgundy. 
It is patently obvious that these three spaces cannot all be invaded, without
the invading units being 'seen' by their intended victims.
Since we have already committed the Munich army to an invasion of
Bohemia, we know that if Burgundy is invaded, the attack must come from Ruhr.
This, of course, would rule out any invasion of Ruhr, since no non-German
unit could be positioned to move on Ruhr and yet remain 'unseen' if Ruhr was
occupied by a German army scheduled to invade Burgundy.
<p align=justify>
"In fact, a simple look at the board will convince you that the only way
that two of the three spaces Ruhr, Burgundy, and Picardy could be invaded is
if German units advanced into Burgundy and Picardy from Ruhr and Belgium,
respectively.  There is simply no other way to rule out only one of these
three spaces from our list, and I have noted that we can indeed only afford
to rule one of them out, as we have one final pair of invasions that cannot
possibly both take place."
<p align=justify>
Holmes placed a German army on Burgundy, but stopped short of placing one
on Picardy.  Noting this, I asked,
"Holmes, did you not say that the German player invaded Picardy from
Belgium as well?"
<p align=justify>
"Yes, we can be sure that he has, Watson, but we do not yet know whether he
did so using an army or a fleet." Holmes struck Ruhr from his 
list of invaded locations, and added check-marks next to Picardy and Burgundy. 
<p align=justify>
"We are now down to determining which seven of the remaining eight 
spaces were 'invaded.'  A simple concentration on
one final area of the board will eliminate the final candidate.
Consider the situation around Silesia, Livonia, and Prussia.

Livonia, we see, could be invaded by a German fleet
leaving the Baltic Sea, but only if Livonia were empty in the Spring
(as otherwise the German fleet would have been detected).
Similarly, Prussia could be invaded by a Russian unit moving from either
Livonia or Warsaw (but, of course, the attack could not come from Livonia if
there was a German fleet in the Baltic Sea).
The only way both Prussia and Livonia could be 'invaded' would be if a
German fleet advanced from the Baltic Sea to Livonia and a Russian army
left Warsaw for Prussia. However, an insurmountable problem arises if the
Warsaw unit were committed to invade Prussia.
<p align=justify>
"Notice that Silesia can only be invaded from Warsaw, and we have already
determined what must have happened on Germany's western and southern fronts --
he advances from Belgium to Picardy, from Ruhr to Burgundy, and from Munich
to Bohemia.  Obviously, German territory is not being invaded along those
fronts, and no English unit could possibly invade German territory from the
north or west without being foreseen.  Therefore, if we assume that Warsaw is
moving to Prussia, leaving Silesia off our list, this means that Germany is
invaded by only that single Russian army.  This is something that 
fact 4 tells us did not happen -- the Captain wrote that 'no power was
invaded only by a single army.'
<p align=justify>
"We know, then, that Silesia cannot be the final location stricken from our
list.  This means that it was most definitely 'invaded,' and that invasion
came from Warsaw." Absent-mindedly, Holmes took a Russian army and placed it
on Silesia, and wrote a check-mark alongside Silesia on his list. 
"To deduce which of the other two locations -- Prussia or Livonia -- is
(and which is not) invaded, 
we can simply rely on the same piece of intelligence we just used.
Since the Captain told us that Germany could not have been 'invaded' <i>only</i>
by the single Russian army that we have just established moved from Warsaw
into Silesia, we know that it is Prussia, and not Livonia, that is the other
location in this trio that is 'invaded.'"
<p align=justify>
"Amazing, Holmes!  You have deduced the twelve invaded locations!" I cried.
<p align=justify>
"Elementary, Watson," said Holmes as he placed a Russian army in Prussia.
Consulting his list, checking off as he 
went, Holmes also moved the Russian fleet on the board from Sevastopol to 
Armenia, and placed a Russian army in Galicia.
<p align=justify>
"Notice, gentlemen, that the fact that no power is invaded only by a single
army also assists us in this way."  Making something of a demonstration of it,
Holmes placed a German fleet onto Finland.  "Note that the only invasion of
Russian territory that is among the twelve is an invasion of Finland, which
could only have been accomplished by a German, and which -- per the note
the good Captain left us -- must have been accomplished by a fleet rather
than an army."
<p align=justify>
Holmes re-lit his pipe and puffed it for a moment before 
speaking again.
"There you have it, Colonel. The twelve spaces invaded and their invaders. 
Germans entered Picardy, Burgundy, Finland, and Bohemia. French units 
entered Tuscany and the Piedmont. Russians entered Armenia, Galicia, Prussia,
and Silesia, the Italian entered Tyrolia, and the Austrian entered Venice."
<p align=justify>
The Colonel and I slapped Holmes on the back, saying, "Good show!"
<p align=justify>
Holmes was enjoying the attention, and his pipe.  After a brief pause,
he said, "without proceeding further, we cannot yet say 
definitively whether armies or fleets entered Picardy, Tuscany, or Piedmont.
In order to determine the answers to these questions, as well as the rest
of the board position, we must take evidence from more of the facts that
the Captain left us."
<p align=justify>
Holmes nodded seriously, and asked, "Shall we proceed?"
