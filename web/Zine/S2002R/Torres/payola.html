I'll bet you're thinking, "Yeah, right."  Or, "That's impossible!"
Or, "Not in a million years would that ever happen in a Diplomacy game!"
But you'd be wrong.  So now you're asking,
"Well, I guess that English fellow must be a total newbie."
Well, I suppose that's possible, but usually even newbies aren't
<i><u>that</u></i> self-destructive.
No, this is not the handiwork of a newbie.  It is the work of
the universal lubricant: money.
<blockquote><blockquote><i>
<P align=justify>
In case you decided to read this article without even knowing what it's
about, and for whatever silly reason, you haven't read (or even skimmed) the
<a href=/Zine/W1995A/Payola>rules to Payola</a>,
here is a clue for you.  In Payola Diplomacy, instead of submitting orders,
each player submits an offer list, which is a list of orders for various
units (of <u>any</u> nationality), with each order specifying an amount of money
that the player offers to pay to that unit if it issues that order.
The offer lists of every player are combined, and each unit issues the
order that will pay it the most money, no matter where the money came from.
In Payola, your financial income is based on the number of centers you own.
More centers, more money.
</i></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align=justify>
If Diplomacy is the best thing since sliced bread&nbsp;-- and it is&nbsp;-- then
Payola is the best thing since, well, sliced bread and pats of butter.
If Diplomacy is the <i>Venus De Milo</i> in a museum, then
Payola is the <i>Venus De Milo</i> with her arms still attached.
<p align=justify>
Tragically, though, Payola is woefully underplayed, and this article is my
attempt not only to explain this tragedy, but try to correct it.
The Pouch's Web and e-mail based adjudication system, the
<a href=/dpjudge>DPjudge</a> (USDP) is the only judge on which
Payola games are run.  At the time of this writing,
it has run or is running over 70 Payola games.
<p align=justify>
Certainly, there are other variants that are played even less,
such as Hide-The-Hamster Diplomacy.  But those variants are obscure,
pointless, and infinitely less fun than Payola&nbsp;-- especially if you're
the hamster.  Honestly, this is agonizing!  It's time for all diplomats
to descend on USDP and play Payola.  How can this be accomplished?
Unfortunately, unlike in Payola, graft won't solve this problem.
<p align=justify>
I have always been an idealist.  I can solve the world's problems.  Really,
I can.  So this situation truly causes my heart to cry out in anguish of the
injustice, and it motivates me to try to deduce probable explanations, and to
completely and totally dedicate myself to this worthy and noble endeavor,
without
sleeping or eating or consuming caffeinated beverages or practicing good
hygiene for at least a good ten or fifteen minutes&nbsp;-- or maybe even until
until I finish writing this article.  Yes, for the remainder of this article,
I do solemnly swear that:
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<center><i>
"I will find all the fallacious reasons why Dippers don't play
Payola, and debunk them one by one until, by default, I have
proved that everyone should play Payola.  While accomplishing
this task, I will shun sleep, food, caffeinated beverages, and
personal hygiene, and if I end up tired, hungry,
thirsty, and smelly from the effort, well, then maybe I'll change
my mind."
</i></center>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align=justify>
Well, I asked myself, "Self, what is the most basic reason why more
people don't play Payola?"  Well, put that way, the answer to my question seems
obvious.  You need to play Diplomacy to play Payola.  Most people don't play
Diplomacy.  Therefore, most people don't play Payola.  Duh.  But why?
Why don't more people play Diplomacy?  Well, the answer seems to be way beyond
the scope of this article, but suffice it to say that they are moronic
mouth-breathers, uninspiring simpletons, and direct descendants of the people
depicted in the classic movie
<a href=http://us.imdb.com/Details?0068473>Deliverance</a>.
<p align=justify>
This is not good.  I've gotten virtually nowhere, but my pledge to avoid
personal hygiene is already making itself known, leading to a circumstance
that makes me wonder if I will even have time to finish my thoughts on the
subject at hand.  You see,
my wonderful wife has already classified me as a
disadvantaged minority (the hygienically challenged) and she is already
of the opinion that I should learn to embrace my limitations by
launching a new career in which my handicap will not only not hinder my
growth but be seen as a badge of honor, such as in the demanding and
exciting field of lawn grooming and maintenance, and "why don't you start
practicing on our weed infested overgrown yard?"
<p align=justify>
"Yes, love, as soon as I finish this article."  Well, that puts the heat on.
I must accomplish my mission with urgency, and relieve my wife of her
olfactory burden.  Okay,
what is the most obvious reason why more Diplomacy players don't play Payola?
<p align=justify>
Hmmm.  This is puzzling.  The fundamentals of Payola Diplomacy are the
same as the fundamentals of standard Diplomacy, so <i>that</I> does not seem
to be an issue.  For example, Payola does not modify the map, but rather,
like Diplomacy itself, can be played on any number of the different variant
maps.  So the map cannot be an issue.  The negotiation requirement cannot be
an issue, because negotiation is what Dippers literally do for fun.
Gosh, that makes Diplomacy players almost lawyer-like!
Ewww!  Press setting preferences cannot be an issue,
because Payola can be played with any press setting.
The movement and
unit mechanics cannot be an issue, because they are exactly the same as
in standard
Diplomacy.  The move, support, and convoy orders and resolution are exactly
the same.  Wow.  I am stumped.
<p align=justify>
Hmm, all of this hard work is making me sweat.  And sweating...well, let's
just say that it is not helping the hygiene situation.  But I think I realize
my mistake.  I'd been going about this backwards -- giving reasons why
Payola is <i><u>easy</u></i> for
Dippers to pick up!  I need to search harder.  I need to be like
Winnie-the-Pooh and go to my thinking spot.  Think.  Think.  Think-Think.
Well, let's see.  Payola is just like standard Diplomacy, except for honey.
Oh, bother!  I mean money!
<p align=justify>
So it must be the money that has kept Payola's growth slow.
<p align=justify>
But that doesn't make sense either.  Can anyone show me a person&nbsp;-- Diplomacy
player or not&nbsp;-- who doesn't like money?  Personally, I've never seen one.
Does such a person exist?  If one did, I'd be happy to relieve them of their
hated currency.  Just being a good citizen and all.  Bill Gates, the Catholic
Church, governments around the globe&nbsp;-- all have tons of cash, and
all still want more.  Nope, it's not the money.
<p align=justify>
Maybe the issue is how to <i>spend</i> the money.  Yes, maybe that is it.
I hear that in marriage, the main subjects that couples fight over are money,
sex, and religion.  (Here in my house, lawnwork and attention to hygiene are
up there too.)  Rich or poor, it is not how much you have, it is how you spend
it.
<!--
Ugly as a doormat or not, it is whether you put out or not.  No?  Well, maybe.

<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<center><i>
"Maybe one of the reasons why Dippers don't learn how to play
Payola is because they either don't know how to spend Payola
money, or they are intimidated by the (perceived, but not
actual) complexity of writing Payola offers...."
</i></center>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p align=justify>
Yes, maybe some potential Payolaphiles have held back from playing because
of confusion about how to write offers.  But to be honest, that is a weak
excuse.
When I sat down to submit my very first Payola unit-bribe offers (you don't
order a unit in Payola&nbsp;-- you offer it money to do your bidding), I must admit
I was as dumbfounded as anyone.  But I did it.  And then it all became clear.
To submit offers, I developed a little procedure, and in hopes of convincing
all the poor readers out there who haven't yet played Payola that it's not
brain surgery, I present:
<center><P>
<table>
<tr><th>
<u>A Payola Newbie's Offer Writing Procedure</u>
</th></tr>
<tr><td align=left>
<ol>
<li>Pick the most important unit on the map.  This unit could be yours or
it could be anyone else's.
<li>Write the order you'd most like to see this unit carry out.
This can be any order, especially orders that are unthinkable in vanilla Dip,
like supporting or convoying enemy units into home centers.
Worry about the money later.
<li>On the next line, write a backup order, if any.
Important units almost always get backups.
Any number of backups orders are possible
(and wise!).  For example, if it is important to you that the army in Munich
stays in place to be able to receive support, your order and its backup orders
might be
A Mun S A Hol-Ruh,
A Mun S A Kie-Ruh,
A Mun S A Ruh-Bur, and
A Mun Hold.
To keep yourself organized, you'll want to
keep all orders for a given unit grouped
together.
<li>Do the same for the rest of the important units, in
order.
It helps to write the orders for the most
important ones first to help prioritize your
spending, because frankly, you can never
afford to pay to control all of them.  (And
what fun would it be if you could?)
<li>If you haven't already, finish by creating orders for your own units.
<li>Use the 25% Spring, 75% Fall guideline to limit your
total spending for the phase.
Your money needs to last you two phases&nbsp;--
Spring movement and Fall movement
(retreat and adjustment phases cost no money).
You won't get more money until after Winter
Adjustments, so don't spend it all in the
Spring.  Payola players have seemed to collectively decide on a relatively
standard pattern of spending.  Offer about a quarter of your total treasury
in Springtime bribes, and then offer three-quarters or so of the remainder
in your Falltime bribes.
<li>As a guide, distribute your money in roughly equal
shares to the important units
To add money to the orders you wrote, just put the bribe amount and a colon
in front of the order, like so:
<tt>2:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Mun&nbsp;H</tt>.
There are other symbols besides the colon; these symbols do things like
offer to pay for <i>any</i> hold order, or <i>any</i> move order, and
so forth.  But for now, the simple colon (direct bribe) is sufficient.
<li>For backup orders, you can feel free to put
the same value for you did for your first-choice order.  You will
not get charged twice, because the unit
can only issue one order, and therefore won't be accepting more than one
of your bribes.
<li>"Sanity check" your orders.
Make sure you're not putting money down
on any order you would not be willing to pay for.
<li>Click "Submit" and hope for the best.  Ain't Dip great?
</ol>

<p align=justify>
So...back to business.  Why don't more Dippers play Payola?  Obviously, it's
not rocket science.  Hmmm.
Perhaps the reason is that players are ignorant of both the quality and
quantity of documentation about Payola.
<p align=justify>
I don't think that's it either, though.  Ignorance is a completely
inadequate excuse for not playing any kind of Diplomacy, because
The Pouch is an excellent source of
information about Diplomacy, the hobby, and how to play all aspects of
The Game.  There is information on
openings, information on endings, information on middles.  There is
information on alliances and grand alliances.  Stalemate lines.  Even
the famed <a href=/Zine/S1996M/Hand/NTH-Pic.html>"North Sea to Picardy"</a>
move (which is <a href=/Zine/W1995A/Payola/notes.html#legal>not possible in Payola</a>, but perhaps should be).
There is information on player psychological profiles, and there is
information on Payola.  Plenty of it, in fact.  See?

</ul>
<p align=justify>
In fact, not a single person ever sat down with me and
said, "Let me teach you how to play Payola."  Nope.  I just went to
<a href=/dpjudge/payola>Payola Place</a>,
found myself engrossed
in all of the above articles, found myself a game to <tt>JOIN</tt>,
added myself to <a href=http://groups.yahoo.com/group/payola/join>the Payola
mailing list</a>, and considered myself a Payolaphile.
<p align=justify>
But really, as excellent and valuable as they are (and they are), it is
actually not really necessary to read all of those articles to get started.
Well, you might finish reading <i>this</i> one, at least (because you're
this far already).
Personally, I chose to read all of them for a couple of reasons: I read owner's
manuals from cover to cover (hey, at least my VCR doesn't flash 12:00 like
it does for
90% of the world), and, after reading just the literal rules, I didn't have
a clue as to what strategy to pursue to keep from getting my ass kicked.
Is it because I am not as think as people dumb I am?  Or just because I was
worried about overspending?  Suffice it to say
I needed help, but to be honest, I should have just joined a Payola newbie game and had
fun figuring it out for myself.
<p align=justify>
Well, maybe I am done with my quest.  My wife seems to think I should be,
whether I am or not.  Maybe I have shown why more Dippers don't
play Payola. Yes, maybe they're just not smart enough.  Maybe that's it.
Maybe in all of the thousands of Dippers out there, maybe there are only a
couple hundred or so who are smart enough to figure out how to play Payola.
Heaven forbid, we would not want uneducated, uncouth, underachievers playing
Payola, giving their countries up for cheap, now would we?  No, never.
We would not want to have any "easy pickings" squaring off against us in
the next Payola match.
<blockquote><blockquote><i><center>
"Maybe you just have to be smart to play Payola.<br> Dumb
people, stop reading.<br> Smart people, please continue."
</center></i></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align=justify>
As I've explained earlier, in Payola
all units on the board put their services for sale at auction to the highest
bid.  (Not necessarily the highest single bidder, but the highest total bid,
which may be a collection of funds offered by more than one player for the
same order.)
This means that you can lose
control of your very own units.  And if you are a control freak, this may not be for you.  It
may cause you to go into fits of rage and put your fist through your monitor screen, and if
you do so, The Pouch Legal Department insists that the following disclaimer be
added to this article:
<blockquote><small><small>
"In no way does this article or The Pouch endorse the
insertion of fists, elbows, foreheads, or other bodily extremities into
monitor screens.   Please do so only on the recommendation of
your physician."
</small></small></blockquote>
<p align=justify>
On the flip-side, Payola gives you the opportunity to control your enemies'
units also.  Which is, well, addictive.
<blockquote><blockquote><i><center>
"Hello.  My name is Jos&eacute;, and I am a bribe-a-holic."<br>
..."Hi, Jos&eacute;!"
</center></i></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align=justify>
You could argue, "In standard Diplomacy, you can already 'control' your
opponents' units through guile and wit, so the ability to bribe an opponents'
unit is virtually worthless."  But if you made this argument, you'd probably be
wearing a pink-polka-dotted muumuu with thigh-high black leather boots and
ten-gallon black Stetson hat with the words, "Living Brain Donor" on the
front and "Space for Rent" on the back.  Well, maybe I went too far with the
muumuu, but you get the idea.  No amount of guile or wit is going to convince
an opponent to use his own units to support you while you completely eliminate
him.  Payola gives you options you never had before.  Yes, you can still try
to persuade your fellow competitors
to move this way and that.  In addition, you can work to persuade them to spend
some of <i>their</i> money to help move your units (thus saving yourself the
money you need to stab them later) or to help move some of your supposedly
common enemies' units as your alliance needs.  So Payola actually
<u><i>adds</i></u> to the elements
of negotiation and persuasion in the game.
<p align=justify>
And of course, you can also (as we saw at the beginning of
this article) use an
enemy's own units against him.  Or you can bribe his neighbors' units into
offensive positions on his border, and provide him enormous sympathy while
painting the neighbor as a salacious aggressor.  Or you can start a war
between your neighbors, and offer sympathy (and well-placed bribes) to
both sides while they waste their money fighting the war you started between
them.
The only limits in Payola are one's own creativity.
<p align=justify>
Hmmm.  The thought of having your own units disobey your wishes does make
things
rather complicated.  It makes it hard to predict what units will do because they violate the
accepted and predictable norms of vanilla Diplomacy.  In standard
Diplomacy, it is a given that a unit that can provide a necessary and
uncuttable support will indeed provide that
support.  It is predictable that a
unit located on a supply center, surrounded by two hostile units, and with no
available supports, will most likely be dislodged.  It is a given that the
units anchoring a stalemate line will sit still and
predictably maintain that stalemate line against a power that has seventeen
units.  But is all of this true of Payola?  Nope.
Payola allows for no routine, no predictability, and no muumuus, either.
<p align=justify>
In Payola, one can conduct a major offensive with just one unsupported unit.
Or defend his centers without a unit at all!  All you have to do is bounce
a fellow out or pay him to move him away.  This is foreign
to the uninitiated.  Why?  Because it is a whole new paradigm.
<p align=justify>
Fair warning.  I'm about to start waxing philosophical.  I get that way
when I haven't showered.
A paradigm, you see, is a view of the world, which humans use as a
guideline to govern how they
interact with that world.  It is not necessarily applicable to the world as it
really is, only as people perceive it.  If you update your view of the world
in advance of the rest of society, you may be presented with the opportunity
to exploit that difference, and in so doing,
achieve a radical, fundamental breakthrough.
History is rife with thousands of paradigm shifts, which today we take for granted.  The
Chinese invented an explosive powder hundreds of years before it was used to propel a
small projectile out of a metal tube.  Once gunpowder's main application changed from
fireworks to lead-slug propellant, the conduct of war went through a fundamental
change, because it made the previously dominant stone castles and knights in armor
pointless.  Once airplanes became capable of carting people from place to place, the
dominant mode of travel changed from boat and rail to plane.
Once Henry Ford invented the assembly line, the dominant way to manufacture
goods went through a fundamental
change, because specialization of jobs on an assembly line multiplied throughput and
productivity by five to ten times greater than previously possible.
Once Hormel realized that something that can almost pass for meat could
be mass-produced
even though there's no actual animal called a "spam," -- well, we won't go there.
<p align=justify>
Okay, enough real-world history and philosophy.  The point is that
Payola requires just such a paradigm shift.  And well, maybe that's the
problem.  People can often
be stubborn, and cling to what is familiar, simply because, well, it is
familiar.  No one can prove to me that the sun will rise tomorrow, yet we
all expect it to, simply because it has
every day before.  So I cling to that (and really, on that one, I can't think
of a better alternative paradigm).  Someday, the sun will not "rise."
God forbid this will be anytime soon, because it is hard to play Diplomacy
in the dark.
<blockquote><blockquote><i>
"Honey - do you know who died?"<br>
"No, who?"<br>
"No, dear, I'm asking you."<br>
"Why would you ask that?"<br>
"How else can you explain that stench?"<br>
"But honey, I'm almost done!"<br>
"Hmmm!"
</i></blockquote></blockquote>
<p align=justify>
In standard Diplomacy, the stalemate line practically forces one to
concentrate on a given geographical area to win.  It is virtually unthinkable
for Turkey to ever possess Edinburgh, for example, or any other center that
requires a northern fleet to keep. Furthermore, if you are not blessed by
being able to build on both sides of the stalemate line (France, Russia),
you must typically own all the centers on your side of the line to win.
Thus, as a function of geography, you must eventually turn on all of your
neighbors, and you are generally no threat to the distant powers until you
threaten to solo.  In the presence of these largely geographical forces
(see The Pouch Zine article <a href=/Zine/F1999R/Windsor/dipmap.html>"Geography
is Destiny"</a>), one
can say that your friends and your enemies are generally forced upon you, and it is
simply a matter of choice as to who is first on the list.
<p align=justify>
In Payola, one can claim and "permanently" possess <i>any</i> center on the
board, regardless of
intervening geography or powers.  To be able to claim it, you only need to wander or march a unit to within striking distance, and then arrange for
any units in the way to decide
to move out of the way and let you walk in.
Some may even decide to support you in.  And you
don't even need your own fleet to attack England&nbsp;-- anyone's fleet will do,
including the English fleets if you like, and these are usually in ample supply.
Finally, to keep that far-off center,
you don't need tons of units to garrison the center.
You don't even need a <i>single</i> unit to garrison it.  You just
need some money and a good budget.  Oh, and a little diplomacy never hurt,
either.
<p align=justify>
Since you can realistically claim any of the 34 centres as your winning 18, the
geographical forces that shackle the diplomatic goings on in standard Diplomacy
are removed or at
least greatly diminished.   The decisions governing who your friends are, who your
enemies are, and which centers you're targeting long-term are almost completely
unconstrained. Thus, in Payola, your neighbors are not necessarily your enemies.  Nor are
they necessarily your friends.
In fact the whole paradigm of friend or enemy is really useless.
One could argue that all the players are "your friends" and all are
"your enemies" and all of them are "your targets."  Even if you are
England and you are eliminated by French units, there is nothing saying
that the French units weren't only doing what German money was used to pay them
to do, despite all of France's best efforts to pay his men enough to stop
attaking you.
Given enough skill, one can diplomatically be "friends" with all powers on the
board at all times, while militarily taking centers from any and all of them.  In fact, the
whole concept of being "at war" with a nation in Payola is antiquated and pointless.  And
that is a hell of a paradigm shift.  As long there is another player in the
game, there is a power
that can and probably will spend money against you,
in theory raising your expenditure to acquire
new centers or to keep the ones you have.
<p align=justify>
Can it be that the paradigm shift is too big?  Too revolutionary?
Do most players want to have a defined enemy?  Is it that not being able to
be sure of your ally, even when his own moves prove friendly, is too scary?
I suppose that's okay, but only if you're a newbie.  In fact, it is my
(unsupported) thesis (really I'm just reading between the lines of great
Pouch authors and calling it my own) that loyalty to an ally out of a sense
of security is a newbie style of play, and demonstrates unwillingness on the
part of the clinger to "go it alone."
How many games have you seen where a rough newbie player picks an ally and
sticks with him and sticks with him and sticks with him, sometimes to his
own detriment (because he gets nailed, or because he does not nail the guy
he's partnering with when he surely could have,
and by so doing, could have had a good to decent shot at a solo).
<p align=justify>
One of the reasons why Payola would not appeal to this type of player (a
true newbie or a fawning carebear) is because they haven't made a more
fundamental paradigm shift&nbsp;-- one that says that
Diplomacy is really a game of one-on-six).
Not only are these players not likely to grasp the geographical freedom of
Payola's paradigm shift, they probably don't have enough Diplomacy experience
to "go it alone" and fully experience the lessons, the true art of the
stab, the constant vigilance and suspicion, that is the point of
Diplomacy in the first place.
<p align=justify>
In his fundamental article,
<a href=/Zine/S1999M/Windsor/point.html>"What's Your Point?"</a>
Paul Windsor defines four predominant playing styles, two of which he calls
the "Classicist" and the "Romantic."  The Classical
style player "feels naked and alone when not in an alliance,"
and typically is not comfortable as
the early leader.  The Romantic style is almost unconcerned about alliances but is
absolutely focused on getting a solo, and any result other than a solo
victory is virtually
pointless to them.
<p align=justify>
Paul claims (and I agree with him) that the Classical style dominates
play on the judges.  If that is true, and if I am correct that the Classical
players have not made the major paradigm shift that Diplomacy&nbsp;-- not Payola,
but Diplomacy itself&nbsp;-- requires, then that is one good reason why more
Dippers don't play Payola, which requires a further paradigm shift by
introducing even more insecurity into the inter-player relationships.
Pure Classicists would probably hate it.  No natural allies, no common enemy.
Your ally could stab you and you'd never know that it was he who did so,
and that would
drive a Classicist nuts.  Players who fit the classic playing style because
they love to master the tactics of the game may first be taken aback by the
lack of direct control over their units' actions.  In Payola, the best-laid
tactical plans can often go awry if the funding of even one unit is
inadequate to carry out the plan.  These players may feel under-equipped and
may even have a sense of their own inadequacy to slug out a tactical war in
Payola.
<p align=justify>
However,
Romantics should think they've died and gone to heaven.
Quite a few Payola games end in solo victories.  No one knows how much to trust
any other player, because you never know when a
guy is spending money to attack you (with his own units or with others).
You can only make educated guesses, by having an idea of what the other
player's income has been, where his units are, and where the centers he
owns are.
Wonderful.
<p align=justify>
Come to think of it, another of Paul's "player types," the "Deviate"
(who just plain loves to lie for the thrill of it) should also love
Payola, because he can spin more lies than you can shake a stick at.
It is much harder to prove lies in Payola than in standard Diplomacy,
and it is much harder for other players to organize alliances against
a "Deviate" who has offended a number of players on the board, even if
his "deviance" is somehow exposed.
<p align=justify>
The final player type, the "Club Player"
should appreciate Payola because, by their social nature,
and the geographically unconstrained nature of Payola, these players
get to interact at the deepest tactical and strategic levels of the game,
with <i>all</i> of the players of the game at all times.  As the Turk,
it is often to your benefit to have England open to the north, putting
pressure on Russia.  Turkey often will suggest such a thing to England,
but the discussions between these faroff powers often are brief and end
there.
In Payola, the discussion can be backed up with money -- "I will contribute
five silver pieces to you if you move to the Barents; in return, can you help
me with some of your money to make
sure that Austria vacates Serbia and my Bulgaria army gets in there?"  (Of course,
at the same time, this same Turk can be secretly contributing silver to send
the French fleet into the Irish Sea, but hey, that's another story.)
<p align=justify>
So as far as I can tell, the only playing style that may not be predisposed
to love Payola as much as they love their mother is the Classical one.
But even that's not a certainty.  There are features in Payola that appeal
greatly to players who fit in all four styles.
<p align=justify>
Have I convinced myself that only experienced players should play Payola?
It is not that Payola requires advanced thinking
(to play Payola, one requires only a pulse), but perhaps
<i>succeeding</i> at Payola requires
advanced thinking?  It requires an open mind and the willingness and
ability to undergo a paradigm shift or two into the deeper depths of
the Diplomacy game-play experience.
<p align=justify>
But should you lack these capabilities, does that mean you will get wiped off the map?
No, probably not.  Play and find out what I mean.
Even if you don't know what you're doing, you will most likely still stick
around long enough to learn your first few lessons.  In fact, good players
tend to keep newbies in the game, just to increase confusion.  So, it is not
like the complexity of Payola will keep you from enjoying your first game.
On the contrary, it will actually help you learn it.  New Payola players
can learn it easily, and they invariably fall in love with the game.

"Maybe one of the reasons why more Dippers don't play Payola
is for lack of newbie Payola games.
<br>
Well, no problem there, I'll
start one right now on <a href=/dpjudge>the DPjudge</a>.
<br>
Or maybe it is because
Internet sales of pink polka-dotted muumuus have been
skyrocketing lately.
<br>
I'd better name the game '<a href=/dpjudge?game=nomuumuu>nomuumuu</a>'.
<br>
[Wow!  'nomuumuu' filled fast!  I'm creating
'<a href=/dpjudge?game=nomuutwo>nomuutwo</a>' now!]
<br>
And maybe one of the best reasons left why more Dippers don't
play Payola is<br>
because no one has said to them, 'Play Payola!  You
will love it!'
<br>So I will:  "Play Payola, damn it!  You will love it!"

<i><b><u>Note from the publisher:</u>
Jos&eacute; wrote what I hope is a pretty effective advertisement for
Payola players here.

, but I think that despite his exploration of
the variant and why people will love it when they try
it, I think he missed what is the largest reason why
the number of Payola games has not yet approached the number of, say,
Modern variant games.  That reason is simple.  There is only one judge,
the <a href=/dpjudge>DPjudge</a>, on which Payola Diplomacy is played.
The DPjudge&nbsp;-- The Pouch's own Web and e-mail based adjudicator&nbsp;-- has
Payola support built-in, and the Ken Lowe judges do not.  Although the
DPjudge can run Payola games that are actually hosted on the Ken Lowe
judges, the main problem is that the DPjudge has only recently been
moved from the Payola (and Crystal Ball variant) player communities out
into the Diplomacy world at-large.  It is now a full-fledged and publicized
section of The Pouch, and the doors are wide open in hopes that the legions
of Pouch readers will find in the DPjudge a useful host to their
games, be they standard games or otherwise.  Like Payola.
<P align=justify>

Yes, the DPjudge is now moving forward in its plan to conquer the world,
and new DPjudges will soon be popping up to join the two public DPjudges now
in service.  At the moment, though, the USDP judge is the one and only
place for Payola play.  I hope you take Jos&eacute;'s advice and stop by
to play.
