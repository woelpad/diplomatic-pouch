<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><Blockquote><I>I try here to write some words to relate my experience of this Diplomacy Face-To-Face tournament in Canberra. To point out the difference between myself and the neo (or post) fascist  party in France, I’ll write it in English.</Blockquote></I>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This tournament was, from all points of view, pretty different from what I’ve ever known. Despite the fact that I play almost exclusively abroad lately, it has always been in Europe, which can be for sure more expensive than going to the United States for instance, but also requires a lot less time.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Just after the landing I noticed the first big difference, when I found a hot sun with 30 degrees Celsius, after leaving the snow and minus-8 degree temperatures in Munich!
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I realise that I’m making some digressions so will now try to concentrate on the dip event itself.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The major difference concerned the scoring system. A couple of years ago was defined in France a scoring system called C-Diplo, aiming to fit with a FTF event, by definition played in a limited time (the "standard" Diplo has no time limits and so only end with a draw when everybody agrees). This system is now widely used in a lot of major Diplomacy countries, even if only used at 100% in France. To define it, let’s say that what is important is much more your final position [i.e., your standing on the board, 1st through 7th] rather than your SC count.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the standard used in Canberra, your final result was, except in the unlikely case of a solo, your SC count, plus 1 point if you survived five years. This system was completely new for me, and I had to adapt. Obviously I adapted badly.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My feeling is that talking about a given scoring system is not important at all. You <i>have to play the system</i>, and that’s all. With the Australian one, you have to make strong alliances, and be really efficient, much more than trying to control the board. If you end with 10 SCs, you don’t care at all if someone has 15, it makes no difference for your score... as long as he has not got 18!
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I was never able to find those allies, except in one game, where I allied with a French player  ... who I hadn’t ever met before by the way ... Anyway it was only my fault if I did badly on my games ... maybe also it was due to the fact that my name was written several times on the shield with the former winners ... maybe also I would have done better without an NMR at the first move in the team game!
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Anyway, what is important is that it was an occasion to meet a new (for me) hobby. For sure the most important thing, in a Diplomacy event, is the socializing, not the game itself. From this point of view, it was a great event. As long as you like gaming, you had all the opportunities, with perfect (strict like it has to be but friendly anyway) GM'ing and a good schedule.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I think also that the way the DAANZ organised its ranking system is really interesting. Talking again about the scoring system, I thought that their system was hard, because it was obviously an invitation to kill the weak players, rather than to balance the game (and top it), as our system is. And so it could mean that beginners would not be keen on coming back.... but I forgave the ranking system. It’s a really interesting one, which gives to <u>all</u> players a goal in a tournament. I would even say <i>several</i> goals, which gives a great interest to all boards. It reminded me a discussion that we had with organisers in San Marino about their idea to attribute some ‘stars’ or decorations depending on the events. All in all, everything that can make the game attractive is a good idea, I think.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I have only one regret, which is that I didn’t find the time to drink more VB's before leaving my worst dip tournament ever!
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I met friendly new players and I hope to have the pleasure to come again. Or maybe it would be more tactical to let them come to me?
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Congratulations to the organisers and the New Champ!
