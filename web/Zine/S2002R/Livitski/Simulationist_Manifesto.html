<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The object of the game Diplomacy is to obtain control of 18 Supply Centers. Many diverse schools of thought have arisen as to how best to achieve that objective. Players have spent decades getting proficient at doing so. A player is considered "good" when he or she is able to achieve this result consistently.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
One thing that is not often considered when planning how to achieve this objective, is the backdrop of the game. Players are considered to be the ultimate Leaders of their various powers. Some players, such as the "<A HREF="/Zine/S2002M/Cohen/Soloist_Manifesto.html">Soloists</A>", do not consider this fact, and truly look upon the Supply Centers as "little black dots." Some players take this context to heart and let their actions be guided by other considerations than just how best to get 18 "dots."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Such players, for want of a better term, I will call "<B>Simulationists</B>." These hobbyists will usually assume a persona in their games, and will tend to write press in character. Sometimes, pure strategic decisions are eschewed in favor of internal political ones, i.e. ones that are more "realistic."
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
In my first PBEM game, I played Turkey. I briefly wrestled with the concept of a pre-arranged "bounce" in the Black Sea. If I was the Sultan, why was I sending my fleet to engage the Russian fleet? After all, we were allies. Presumably, many Turkish sailors would perish in an attack that was just a feint. There are many other examples of strategic moves that would likely never be attempted by the leader of a nation. A common one is allowing the deliberate destruction of one of your units, so that it may be re-built elsewhere.  Another is the emotionless reaction to a betrayal by another power.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Many of the Elite players of the game have written articles on how to improve your play. One of the most common areas which players are encouraged to work upon is their reaction to a "stab" by another player. It is a widely held belief that a stabbed player should react in a positive fashion to the betrayer, congratulating their intelligent maneuver, etc. While it is true that this behavior is more likely to produce a more favorable result for the stabbed player, it is so thoroughly unrealistic that I still can't bring myself to do it. Those players who react to a stab in a cold, emotionless fashion are not being true to the game of Diplomacy. It is hard enough for a real player to rein in their emotions and act in a robotic fashion that will help them "win" the game. How hard would it be for an
actual European leader? The people of the nation stabbed would be calling for blood. Millions of people were killed in this
egregious attack, possibly including members of the leader's family.
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">
Of course, it is entirely true that some of your more ruthless leaders <i>would</i> react this way! Players are free to choose whatever persona they wish. Those who would always choose a certain persona, such as the cunning, emotionless one described above, are cheating themselves of a richer game experience. Those who do not choose a persona at all, are just...cheating!
