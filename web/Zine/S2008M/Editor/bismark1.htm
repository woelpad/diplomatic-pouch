<p><b>Editor's Note:</b> This is the first in a series of articles which were
written anonymously back in the late 1980's in Australia. The author has been the subject of many a guessing game within the Aussie hobby, and, although many are
convinced they know who it is, nobody has ever admitted to being Arthur
Bismark. The Bismark cup (awarded to the best Aus/NZ player in a calendar year) is believed to have been inspired by these articles.</i></blockquote>
<p>Good evening ladies and gentlemen. Could the lobotomy patients kindly stop
growling, please? Thank you. Now, if we could have all the Napoleons, Adolf
Hitlers, Julius Caesars and Alexander the Greats on the left of the aisle,
and the Venusians, Martians, Moon men and all those receiving
extra-terrestrial messages on the right side of the aisle. Thank you.
<p>So you want to play <b>Diplomacy</b>? Try this quick quiz:
<ol>
<li>Would you steal from your mother?
<li>Could you lie plausibly even under a lie detector test?
<li>Consider this well known expression: <i>"It's not whether you win or
lose, it's how you play the game."</i> Does this strike you as weak-kneed and
limp-wristed?
</ol>
<p>If you have answered yes to all three of the above &#8212 congratulations! You are in the right place. You have the psychological profile of a first class
paranoid schizophrenic. By an amazing coincidence, you also exhibit the three
traits necessary in the best <b>Diplomacy</b> players &#8212 you are unscrupulous, lie
brilliantly, and believe winning is everything.
<p>The latter three traits are the holy trinity of the hobby, the perfect
distillation of qualities. Of course, experienced players hide behind a
mask of statesmanship. They appear to be cautious, controlled and
reasonable; their every utterance is designed to say "I am a solid, reliable
partner who wishes for nothing better than a Game Length Ally".
<p>The latter is a childish mythological character invented by really good
<b>Diplomacy</b> players to fool gullible novices such as yourselves. When anyone
uses the term "Game Length Ally" around you, protocol demands that you
sternly rebuke the fellow in internationally recognised <b>Diplomacy</b> jargon
e.g.  "Don't you jive me, @$$#*!^. Stay offa my turf, you gravy sucking
pig!", and so on. This will establish your credentials as a sophisticated
negotiator of unexpected subtlety and depth.
<p>In reality, the only solid ally is the one who can be perceived to gain as
much as you do from the alliance &#8212 once the scales tip, however slightly,
you must expect your "Game Length" ally to shaft you in the most devastating
manner available to him. Patients from the Paranoid Schizophrenic Wing will
know what I mean.
<p>Occasionally you will come across a <b>Diplomacy</b> patient who will bewail the
decline in the spirit of the game, the loss of the role-playing dimension
where players acted as they considered the statesmen of the early twentieth
century would have acted. This is a sure sign that a player has been
tragically struck down with senile dementia, and by the strict code of honour
to which all <b>Diplomacy</b> players adhere, it is incumbent on you to stab
him into dog meat at the earliest opportunity. Such an act is, of course, a
humane form of euthanasia &#8212 and believe me, his family and friends will thank
you. The consummate <b>Diplomacy</b> player bases his actions on Real Politik
rather than historical sentiment.
<p>Much has been made of the theory of the game, the various openings, middle
and end game strategies etc. My personal opinion is that I wouldn't give a
pinch of defecation about most of this self-conscious posturing. No doubt
the intention has been to develop <b>Diplomacy</b> into a respected intellectual
pastime on a par with Chess and Bridge. If the odd nervous beginner becomes
intimidated by the mere mention of a Lepanto opening or whatever &#8212 so much
the better. All's fair in love, war, and <b>Diplomacy</b>.
<p>The truth is the game is so variable that established opening moves played
along the lines <i>&#224 la</i> Chess seem superfluous. When you have seven different
personalities in seven different countries, it is surely impossible to
quantify the "right" or "wrong" moves, the "good" or "bad" strategies. There
is only success or failure. In this way <b>Diplomacy</b> does reflect real life &#8212
the victor, however he attains his victory, is always right. History is
written and interpreted by victorious dominant cultures, and losers tend to
suffer in the hindsight of their defeat. The moral is &#8212 don't lose.
<p>And if you do lose, take a couple of the bastards down with you.
<p>And now ladies and gentlemen, I suggest we adjourn to the recreation room
for coffee and medication. Musical entertainment has been thoughtfully
provided by the Lithuanian Piano-Accordion Trio. Enjoy. Would the last
person leaving please wake up the lobotomy patients? Thank you.
<blockquote><a name="asterisk"><sup>*</sup></a><i><b>About the author:</b> Arthur Bismark is a Fellow of the Institute of Pathological Mental Disorders, and an internationally acclaimed authority on paranoid schizophrenia. In 1969 he delivered a series of lectures designed to introduce the art of <b>Diplomacy</b> to hospitalised schizophrenics. These lectures were later published in the Envoy from 1988-1990 and again in FIST! from 1995-1997, and are considered a vital part of the modern day diplomatic arsenal.
<p>Next time: Lecture 2, in which Arthur probes still deeper into the blood and mucous core of the <b>Diplomacy</b> hobby, and rips out its heart for clinical
dissection.</i></blockquote>
