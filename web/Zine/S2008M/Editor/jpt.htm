<h2>Results of the 15th Annual <i>Stratagem</i> Tournament</h2>
<blockquote><i>James Istvanffy sends us the following report on the final game in the Stratagem tournament that was held at The Sentry Box in Calgary this past January, as advertised in previous installments of Just Passing Through:</i></blockquote>
<p>We had three Diplomacy games (all 7 players each) and a 4 person game of
Machiavelli also was played.
<p>I will simply give you the counties name and who was playing that country
followed by supply centers totals for each year and a bracketed (number) of
a likely outcome if play had continued.

<h2>From Berlin to Vienna!</h2>
<blockquote><i>The following message comes to us from Julian Ziesing: if you're going to WDC 08 in Vienna this year, maybe you can double your fun!</i></blockquote>
<p>Hi all!
<p>I hope you all had a great Xmas time. Here 2 good news for summer 2008:
<p>1. BerliCon V will be August 8th-10th
<p>The date is easy to remember: 08/08/08. We will be at a cozy and
charming place close to the city center which makes sightseeing and
clubbing really easy. We will have the venue for ourselves, with cheap
beds and gaming rooms open day and night. On top of that good German
beer and the opportunity to play football or beach volleyball. If you
prefer a hotel that can be arranged as well. It will be the good old
German style with the typical "family atmoshpere" :-)
<p>2. Ber-Vie!! The double convention with 3 days vacation
<p>As you might notice, BerliCon will be exactly 1 week before the WDC in
Austria. That's no coincidence :-) Like in 2006, we will have a double
convention again. A warm-up before the big event. This time we will
start in Berlin, and end up in Vienna where the bus will take us
directly to Burg Lockenhaus, the WDC castle.
<p>The route is to be discussed. Via Hamburg? Munich? Dresden? Prague? In
the end there might be several groups (and a discussion which one is
the "main" group ;-) ). Most important thing is that it will be fun.
Being together with dip players outside a convention has proven to be
totally different (and much more relaxed) from meeting them on the
convention only.
<p>For more information have a look at <a href="http://www.wdc2008.org/en/bervie.php">the Ber-Vie website</a>, and contact us at:
<p><b><a href="mailto:vorstand@diplomacy-bund.de">vorstand@diplomacy-bund.de</a></b>
<p>Happy New Year! :-)
