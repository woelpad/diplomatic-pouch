<H1>THE SPIDER IN THE CORNER</H1>
<h2>by Rohan Keane</h2>

</CENTER>
<p>I enjoy the diplomatic skill of playing Italy, love a fast rolling Russia
and never complain when given France, but if you really want to make me
happy give me the Turks every time. Turkey is strong in attack without
appearing that threatening, its corner position makes it incredibly powerful
in defence &#8212 the best on the board &#8212 and, as the odd man out in the east, he
is usually the automatic best friend of the Western Powers.
<br><br><br><center><h2>ATTACKING</h2></center>
<p>Turkey has three points of attack to consider: Russia (usually via the Black
Sea and Armenia), Austria (usually via Bulgaria) and Italy (usually via the
Ionian).
<ul>
<li><b>Russia:</b> If Turkey has a reasonably free hand in the Balkans and
Mediterranean then it takes a good Russian player to keep Sevastapol from a
determined Turk. Russia usually has too many fronts to worry about early in
the game to be able to commit enough forces to defend the South successfully
without a good Austrian friend. Also, England doesn't take a lot of
convincing to take St Petersburg which gives Russia the unenviable choice of
a north or south disband. Either one will help you.<br><br>
<li><b>Austria:</b> A much harder country to begin an attack on than Russia because the
only way to get armies into the Balkans without a convoy is via the
Constantinople-Bulgaria land bridge, but the rewards are much greater than
the northern attack. This may be slow but you can usually talk another power
into joining the party (party in Austria, everybody's invited. Bring your
own units) because of the yummy Austrian position.<br><br>
<li><b>Italy:</b> A slow attack going through the Mediterranean but once the Ionian is
cracked the Italian has too many guesses to keep you out for ever and even
if they are good at mind reading (or lip reading or just reading your orders
over your shoulder) sooner or later they'll have to face some fleets from
the west and you'll get your share of the spoils.
</ul>
<br><br><br><center><h2>DEFENDING</h2></center>
<p>This is the fun part. The only thing you can say as a Turk under attack is
"Bring it on!" And say it with a smile because if you're going to be under
the pump as a country then Turkey is the place to be. It takes all three of
the other eastern powers to bring down a competent Turk, and let's face it:
even if the West leaves them alone long enough for them to do the job, a
good diplomat should be able to find something to force a wedge between your
attackers. 
<p>I find that it helps to point out to Italy that they'll probably only get
Smyrna from all their hard work and they should at least get Trieste to keep
the alliance equal and fair. This can start some interesting Austria/Italy
conversations. Tell Russia how you overheard Italy and Austria discussing
the next stage of their expansion and that only included Russia's centres
and not Russia. As for Austria, just play on its paranoia by pointing out
how they can easily become the meat in the Italian/Russian sandwich. 
<p>But,
interesting as this mischief is, it doesn't really matter that much as long as you
have a good rapport with the western powers. I have seen Turkeys in this
position tell the east to get stuffed and only talk to the west, and at the
end of the game still be a strong player in a respectable draw. I personally
wouldn't recommend this as a tactic, but it does go to show how strong Turkey
is in defence.
<br><br><br><center><h2>ALLIANCES</h2></center>
<p>Turkey can ally with any country comfortably by virtue of its strong
defensive position. The other country has to either move away from Turkey to
fight or is on the other half of the board and can't stab until the end
game. I will give a quick critique of the basic pairings:
<ul>
<li><b>Turkey / Russia:</b> Probably the one alliance where Turkey doesn't always hold
the whip, because of Russia's ability to grow and build quickly, and to lose
centres in a southern stab while compensating easily by northern gains. Having said that, it has become common practice for the whole world to jump
on Russia at the first sign of the Juggernaut. This means Turkey can use
Russia to help smash Austria; and then when the board screams "Steamroller"
and goes for Russia, the Turk can change sides and enter the midgame with two
crippled or dead neighbours and a tidy eight or nine centres under his (or
her) belt. Or Turkey can stick with Russia and sweep the board. Just keep
your wits about you.<br><br>
<li><b>Turkey / Italy:</b> A surprisingly powerful alliance that can catch the board
with its pants down. Turkey builds armies and Italy fleets to get over the
main stalemate line before most people notice the alliance is on. If Italy
is on the ball and clearly outlines DMZ's and the axis of attack, the
alliance can be a happy game-length one that benefits both sides. If Italy
can't or won't do that, then any Turk who can count to 18 should be a happy
little vegemite.<br><br>
<li><b>Turkey / Austria:</b> Probably the most powerful alliance in the whole game.
Austria is the land power and Turkey ruling the sea. When this works well it
is almost impossible to stop. Once again, the onus is on Austria to keep the
Turk honest, as he is always building behind them while Austria's units are
pushing into and through Germany. As the Austrian I can be talked into this
as long as I know the Turk is the sort of player who will only stab for
great gains; if I let that happen, it's my fault. As the Turk I will take
this alliance from any but congenital idiots, because I know that the worst
that is going to happen is that I will finish on eight or so, and that the
solo is mine to stuff up if all goes well.
<br><br>
<li><b>Turkey / England:</b> This is a particularly nice alliance when used in
conjunction with the Austria / Turkey pairing. England can help bring down
Russia early on, and the keep the French from propping up Italy. Once the
Germans and Austrians are fighting in the middle of the board and England
stabs Germany, Turkey can choose to stab Austria and become the game's land
power, or to stick with them in an alliance that England can't possibly stop
by itself. Even if Austria is not involved, the Witch's collusion in
attacking Russia gives both countries a couple of easy builds and a safe
flank to give them some peace of mind.
<br><br>
<li><b>Turkey / France:</b> It's possible to work this alliance, but it can be prickly;
especially when Italy is being divided up, and again afterwards when both
sides have units sitting next to one another. To work this France and Turkey
must have a good understanding of each other's motives and ambitions, and
both must be very trusting of the other at the DMZ'ing stage.
<br><br>
<li><b>Turkey / Germany:</b> Germany can be a great friend to the Turkish. Bordering
Russia and Austria, and a stone's throw away from Italy, it can influence much
of what goes on in the east, such as allowing or denying the Russians Sweden
in 1901 (depending on the Turk's plans). In the midgame the alliance can
blossom from the occasional mutual help and diplomatic pressure to a full
military pact.
</ul>
<br><br><br><center><h2>3 WAYS</h2></center>
<p>This is my favourite part.  <img src="/Zine/Common/smiley.gif"> 
<p>Sometimes, the eastern gang of three decide the world would
be a nicer place without the spider in the corner, and have taken off their
size 11 shoes in preparation for a great big squash fest. The Italians have
Lepantoed, the Russkies have opened and built south, and the Austrians are
always too busy with the others to talk to you. 
<p>Now, you've got a great country to fight a defensive war with; but barring a miracle you're gonna die. Spring 1903 moves are read and, lo and behold, here comes the miracle:
England moves on St Petersburg, France moves into the Mediterranean, and
Germany throws everything it has east. What do you do? 
<p>Wait until everybody runs up to the stalemate line, stab everybody you can reach, and then laugh like a mad man as your eastern enemies collapse one after the other?
Tempting, but you'll probably end up in the corner on 4 or 5 centres as at
least 2 of the western powers clean the board. 
<p>Far better to go cap in hand
to the eastern powers and promise them that you will do anything you can to
help them, lend them any unit they need to hold a line and that your other
units will sit still and be good doggies while the line is holding. All you
want from them is survival once the western 3-way falls apart. Don't forget
to be pathetic when asking if you can help, and be pathetically grateful
when they (as they will) take you up on your offer. Now you get an army into
Galicia or the Ukraine and a fleet into the Ionian where they can support
the line. You must also give good tactical advice on how to hold it, and
work hard diplomatically to keep the faith amongst the eastern powers, but
most of all you must be seen by your eastern allies to be the hardest worker
on that side of the line. 
<p>The whole time you are doing this you are also
working on England to stab Germany or France (or both). If the stab doesn't
come then you've lost nothing. The game stalemates and you survive. If the
stab does come then now you can stab everybody you can reach and laugh like
a mad man as your eastern enemies collapse one after the other. The
difference is that this time, double figures should be the lowest you should
settle for.
<br><br><br><center><h2>CONCLUSION</h2></center>
<p>
When playing Turkey, and things look bleak, don't despair: every turn you
survive is a turn that an alliance can break down; that an attacker can get
bored and move elsewhere; or the western powers sort their differences out
and come and rescue you. 
<p><i>Nil desperandum</i>; and patience, my spider in the
corner!
