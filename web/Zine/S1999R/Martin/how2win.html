<H1 align=center>How to Win Tournament Diplomacy<br>(Revisited)</H1>
<H2 align=center><i>Chris Martin</i></H2>
<HR>
<P>
Last year, after World Dip Con 8, I wrote <a href=/Zine/S1998R/Martin/little.html>Be the Little Guy</a>, a short piece on how I felt I had
achieved my success, and how others might be able to do the same.  Well, it's
a year later, and I thought I’d re-examine some of the principles, and see
if I feel the same way!  The European, and particularly the French game,
which ends in 1907, is a very different game than the one we play here in
the States.  More on that, as well! Lets look at the premise of the last
article.
<P>
Here's what I had to say on the subject of being the little guy:
<blockquote><i>
Surely anyone who had a "name" in the hobby -- and there were a bunch of 'em
there, believe you me -- would be at a disadvantage, as well as anyone who
did really well in the first or second round.
</i></blockquote>
Well, now.  Do the words "Christian Dreyer" mean anything to you?  Who?  Oh,
only one of the best known Swedish players in the world, and that was
<i>before</i> he won WDC9.
<P>
<img align=left hspace=5 src=ivan.gif alt="Do You Know Me?">
Oops.  But hang on a moment!  Have you seen this man before?
That’s right, Ivan Woodward, finishing a strong third, had -- and correct me if
I am wrong here -- never won or placed in the top seven at a major convention.  He
was rated 26th in a 1998 European/British ratings listing I received prior
to the con.  He was clearly a "Little Guy."  Clearly, Little Guys can have
success.  Clearly, given Christian Dreyer's performance, so can the
Big Guys.  And clearly, having won a WDC, I am no longer a Little Guy, so I
will have to come up with a new theory that allows Big Guys to win as well, but
in the meantime....
<P>
What else did I have to say about being the Little Guy?  And how have my
experiences since last year changed or enhanced that advice?  Let's see.

<H3>Patience Pays Off</H3>
I gotta stand by this one.  I have seen more people lose, and have in fact
lost more often myself, by <i>not</i> following this advice than by following it.
In the Third round of WDC9 in Belgium, playing Russia, I made a galling
mistake: I pushed for an extra center too soon.  I could have had that
center the next season, and probably more after that, but under the pressure of
a 1907 game-termination deadline, I choked and wrote a set of orders that denied me any
chance at the top table. I should have been patient.  My two successes in
that tourney came from waiting until the moment was right before striking.
<P>
This is not to say that there is no place for the Blitzkrieg.  I have seen
that work to good effect as well, but more often than not it draws the
attention of the rest of the board, and before you know it, you're ordering
"Berlin to Kiel" and nothing else.  In tournament play, better safe than
sorry.
<H3>Bold, Honorable Play Pays Off</H3>
I can hear Andy Shiner, with whom I regularly play face-to-face, laughing as I write
this.  I imagine the other NYC players in our group are having a good
chuckle as well. (Suffice it to say that while I am far from the least
"trustworthy" of the players in the group, I have a bit of a reputation for
shading my diplomacy in a light more favorable to me -- okay, I lie through my
teeth with no compunctions -- occasionally!) Nonetheless, I have to stand by
this one as well.  In a tournament, you have to work towards the best result
you can, while staying alive long enough to be in the endgame.  As Greg
Brown mentioned in his article in the last Pouch,
<a href=/Zine/S1999M/Brown/silesia.html>German Army to Silesia</a>,
sometimes there is nothing you can do about the onslaught that is coming
your way.  But when you have the luxury of choosing your target, doing so in
a fairly straightforward fashion will pay off in the endgame.
<P>
In the end, most tournament games eliminate one, two, or rarely three players
in the first five or six game years.  Mid-games consist of working the smaller
powers and trying to get across stalemate lines, either as an alliance or
as individuals.  The way you have dealt with those smaller -- one, two, and
three-center -- powers can make the game go your way or not.  At PrezCon, I
think, a solo victory was conceded to Tom Pasco who had sixteen centers.
Time had been called, there were still five players in the game, and it was by
no means certain that he could have forced the win given more time, but his
play had been Bold, and as far as the remaining players were concerned
Honorable.  He didn't end up winning the Tournament, but I think he was second
or possibly third.  If he had had to settle for a five-way draw -- the "pure"
result of the board -- he certainly wouldn't have done that well.
<H3>Alliances Pay Off</H3>
Hoo, daddy, this is the big one!  <b>Do they ever!</b>
The one thing any Turkish
player hates to see is E/F sweep into Germany and proceed to split into two
well-planned attacks on Scandinavia and Italy.  He knows, if he is a savvy
player, that he is now playing for third place on the board.  As France, how
often have excellent players been unable to do anything about the R/T -- or
worse, the R/A -- alliance sweeping the Balkans?  Two powers working together
are stronger than five powers who aren't.  End of discussion.
<P>
Except of course, that you need to be the stronger of the two powers.  That
goes without saying.
<P>
Seriously though.  Winning tournaments is about scoring points. Lots of
points.  Typically, you get points by being one of the three biggest players
on the
board at the end of the game.  If you and another player can keep the knives
pointed towards someone else long enough, I guarantee you that you will
score some points on the board, and may well come out on top.  I feel this
is especially true in games where the time of play is limited, either by a
pre-determined finishing date, or time being called at some random point
(these being the two most popular methods I have seen for ensuring that games
are kept
under twelve hours running time).  When you play at a Con where the game ends when the
game ends or when time is called in 1912 or so, then a strong alliance
will certainly get you to the endgame, at which point, let your conscience be
your guide.  What's that?  No conscience?  Well, join the club.
<P>
<H3>Have I Any New Thoughts?</H3>
A Few.  Refining something I said last year:
Win the Tournament, not the Event
<P>
<img align=right src=devil.gif>
This is perhaps most evident in the games where you aren't doing well, and
aren't going to top the table.  In these cases, it is terribly, terribly,
vitally important -- and I cannot stress this enough -- <b><u>do not let
David Hood get a solo.</b></u>
<P>
No, no, no, sorry.  Sorry!  I am better now.  The medication is kicking in.
I'll try that again.
<P>
In these cases, it is important to look at the Larger Picture.  Is there
someone on your table who has already won a solo victory in another round?
Deny him victory in this one.  Can you keep the draw fairly large -- large
enough that <b>no one</b> gets any points from the round?  Do so.
<P>
Hmm,
who was it that said, "It is not enough that I win.  My enemies must lose"?
Michael Eisner?
Well, regardless of who it was, it is never truer than in Tournament Dip.
<P>
Sometimes, if there is a "Top Table" or a final round sort of situation, it
is better to have <i>one</i> person as the victor on your table, rather than
<i>two</i>
people who might get better scores than you -- thank you, Vincent Mous, for
pointing this out to me in Belgium!  Every board you are on is one where you
affect the outcome of the tournament, whether you win, lose, or draw that
particular board.
<P>
At WDC9, in Namur, to win the tournament, you had to be on the "Top Table" --
and to do that, you had to have one of the seven best scores going into the
final round.  You flat out can't win a tournament with a "Top Table" without
being on that table.  So my goal going in was to get on that table.  Other
tournaments are scored differently, the point being that
you have to know the system so that you
can be playing to win.  I will be going to (have gone to, by the time you
read this) DixieCon, where the games end when the games end, the way God
intended Diplomacy to be played.  This calls for a very different style of
play than WDC9 called for, and to win, I'll have to play differently.
<P>
And hey, if you are reading this but have never come out to a Tournament,
try to get out to one!  They are loads of fun, and you never know -- being a
Little Guy, you just might win!
