<H1 align=center>Caissa Annotates a No-Press Game</H1>
<H2 align=center>Part 1:  The Opening</H2>
<H3 align=center><I>By Paul D. Windsor</I></H3>
<HR>
<P>A few issues
of the Pouch ago, I wrote an article called <a href=../../S1998R/Windsor/caissa.html>"Caissa at the Diplomacy Table."</a>
That article probably got more positive responses than all the other stuff
I've written put together, so I felt like a follow up to that would be a
pretty good idea. In this follow-up article series, we'll see what practical
application
can be made of the principles of time, space, and force in a no-press game.
The game was <tt>alicew</tt> on the USEF judge, a no-press gunboat game for experienced
players organized from the <a href=/DP-cgi/setqueue>DipPouch queue system</a>.
I played the Russian position
and the analysis will proceed from that point of view. <!-- , though the game was
won by Turkey, as you shall see.--></P>

<P>
In this first article, we will get through the opening years
of the game, discussing the orders for each power on each turn.  In the
next issues of The Pouch, the end-game will be analyzed in exactly the same
fashion that is presented here.

<P>I hope to do more than describe
the game and comment about my motives. I'd like to use this exercise to illustrate my Caissic theories of tactical play. One of the differences I've observed between chess literature and Diplomacy literature is that analyzing games as a learning tool is one of the main bodies of chess literature,
but is rare in the 'net Diplomacy literature. I think, however, that the
exercise can be as valuable and meaningful to Diplomacy players as to chess
players.</P>

<P>I may not have chosen the best possible game for a first
effort, since <tt>alicew</tt> went twenty-three years. This game is so rich in tactical lessons,
however, that I couldn't resist digging into it. Since the analysis will
be spread over the next few Pouch Zine issues, there is obviously
no need to play through
the whole game at one sitting. The purpose of this kind of exercise, after
all, is to proceed
slowly and analyze thoroughly.  So presenting only a subset of the game
(in this first case, the opening stages) will allow and encourage you
to what I hope will prove a valuable depth of study, if you are so inclined.
I also, of course, hope that you will enjoy the narrative.</P>

<P>As far as I can tell, this is an uncommon
opening for Austria. I reviewed numerous opening strategy articles for Austria
and could find no discussion of this opening other than in Richard Sharp's
book.  It's a variation on the Hedgehog theme, but less hostile looking.
Austria protects himself from incursions into Galicia and Trieste, and is
positioned to take Serbia and/or Greece for a Fall build. Although neither
Serbia nor Greece is guaranteed, he'll very likely get one of them. Austria
is unlikely to make big gains in time or space with this opening, but given
his need to secure the key provinces of Galicia and Trieste without the benefit of negotiation, it is positionally solid.</P>

<P>Opening to the Channel
seems more popular in no-press games, presumably because English players
are a lot more concerned with securing this key province when they can't
negotiate with France. The tradeoff is that England risks antagonizing France
before the French player has shown his own hand. It's not automatically hostile to France, however, and the French player need not panic at the sight of an English fleet in the Channel, since England's force influence
over Brest and Mid-Atlantic is presently neutralized by the French fleet.
England's forces aggressively concentrate on Belgium forcing the immediate
attention of both France and Germany. </P>

<P>The Maginot Opening
for France guarantees a build and asserts influence over all three
neutral supply centers within reach. The French home provinces are all secure,
while the French player is projecting his influence outward. I don't see
why forcing the occupation of Burgundy should be regarded as directly hostile
to Germany, as France cannot gain decisive control of any province within
Germany this way, but my experience in press games is that Germany typically
reacts quite negatively to this opening.</P>

<P>Germany announces a full commitment to
western affairs with this opening, giving up influence over Sweden in the
Fall, while projecting minimal power north and none east, all in hopes of
obtaining a greater influence over Belgium and western provinces in general.
I'm generally opposed to using the Berlin army to take Denmark, but especially
opposed in no-press. An army is badly misplaced in Denmark owing to its
inability to project influence over most of the surrounding provinces. It
can very easily become stuck there--passive and useless for anything other
than defending Denmark.</P>

<P>Italy positions himself for a Lepanto and
signals the same to Austria. Italy is guaranteed a build, but it's hard enough to succeed against Turkey as Italy with a firm commitment by Austria
in press, never mind without. On the positive side is that the primary disadvantage
of the Lepanto -- the lengthy time it takes to pull it off -- is somewhat negated
by the no-press environment, in which initial progress is often slow for
everyone. Even though it's tough to coordinate a Lepanto with Austria without
press, this will give Turkey something to worry about and he'll have some
incentive to arrange an alliance with Russia--I hope.</P>

<P>I chose
this opening because it logically attempts to commit the bulk of Russia's
force resources to exercising influence over a group of key provinces in
a specific region of the board. I'm now exercising a decisive level of influence
over both Galicia and Rumania and progress should ensue. I'm dubious about
northern openings as Russia in a no-press game, as a bounce in Sweden can't
be discounted, which would be virtually fatal. It's also very speculative
as to whether, without the benefit of negotiations, England and Germany will allow Russia early domination in an area of the board that they both
regard as their own backyard. My feeling is that, when playing Russia in
no-press, it's better to begin operations in the south, where your forces
can be concentrated early to maximum effect, while Scandanavia is much more
obtainable as a second operation, after E/F/G have turned to infighting.</P>

<br clear=both><H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>Overall, I'm very pleased with the openings. My minimal
force commitment to the north has been mirrored by Germany, who has conceded
me Sweden. There is reason for early tension between the western powers,
which should keep Germany away from me for a couple of years and could make
me a kingmaker in Scandanavia. In the south, Rumania is a virtual lock for
a second build and I'm likely to make good progress into Austrian provinces,
especialy if Turkey decides to become my ally. With the smell of Lepanto
in the air, an R-T alliance seems like a likely continuation.</P>

<P>That
order for the army in Budapest is bad. The Turkish army in Bulgaria has three logical choices for orders other than attacking Rumania (attack
Serbia, attack Greece, or support a power into Greece), giving the order
no better than one in four odds of being immediately useful. The move could
be defended as a "signal" move proposing alliance to Turkey. The need to
exercise that army's force influence over Galicia this turn, however, was
far more important than the attempted signal of alliance to Turkey. Austria
will pay a stiff price for failing to project power into Galicia with that
army.</P>

<P>England makes the
"natural" convoy to Norway and takes the certain build. This "natural" move
should still be disturbing to any Russian, as that army, with its ability
to penetrate inland, is the most natural spearhead for England's expansion
plans. Placing an army in Norway is, consequently, much more antagonistic
to Russia's interests that a fleet. An alternative to attacking Belgium was to play kingmaker with that SC by supporting someone in and hope to gain an ally thereby. This is a strategy that makes sense in both press and no-press games. The beauty of this approach is that, with his fleets
in the Channel and the North Sea, England still weilds decisive influence
over Belgium, even after someone else takes it. If England doesn't get a
good response to his generosity, he likely will have the option to claim
Belgium for himself in 1902.</P>

<P>France goes for all three neutrals
within reach, fearlessly ignoring the English fleet in the Channel. Given
a choice between wasting a tempo on passive defense or attempting to pick
up extra force, he goes for the latter option. Taking both Iberian neutrals
in 1901, however, takes two-thirds of the French forces away from the front
in 1901 and there is a loss of tempi involved in bringing them back to a
useful position. French players shouldn't be afraid to capture the Iberian
neutrals one at a time if they have an opportunity to work out an aggressive
plan with a willing neighbor. The more efficient use of early tempi by one's
starting force can justify the slower accumulation of new force.</P>

<P>I don't see the benefit

he should order a support for the army in Burgundy. Alternatively, he should
consider attacking Burgundy, to encourage England to attack France, under
the assumption of German support. He could even order the army to Ruhr. Unless France boldly seeks to march into an occupied Munich (unlikely), that will free Munich for a build and allow Germany to project potentially
decisive force influence against Burgundy and Belgium in 1902. That Hold
order doesn't do anything for Germany, either tactically or diplomatically.</P>

<P>Thanks to Austria's gaffe, I'm in Galicia <I>and</I> Rumania with armies. From here my influence over space
is already extending to two of Austria's home SC's. The trade off for using
the army to take Rumania is that I can't build in Sevastopol. That's not
actually bad, as that is my version of a friendly overture to Turkey this
turn. He'll almost certainly build a fleet in Smyrna, since his main concern
must be the threatened Lepanto, while I do not threaten to build against
him. That Turkey would occupy the Black Sea was predictable. It's not a serious concern. The force influence he creates accross Rum/Sev/Arm thereby
is still countered by my own Fleet and he is very unlikely to follow up with a fleet build in Ankara, given the Italian moves.</P>

<P>Turkey's attack on Greece can rightly be called a "neutral" move, though
it clearly hurts only Austria. Greece, like Belgium, cannot rightly be called
the "natural" of any power. If Turkey does not want to give it away, Austria
should not blame him. Repeating the attack on the Black Sea is not necessarily
hostile either, as Turkey has just as much "right" to project force there
as Russia. Thus, Turkey's Fall of 1901 is merely a logical extension of his Spring moves, a neutral attempt to influence key provinces without playing favorites.</P>

<br clear=both><H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>Apart from my easy progress against Austria, I'm less pleased with the
Fall of 1901 than I was with the Spring. My primary concern is that England,
by convoying the army to Norway, has done much to defuse the tension between
himself and his neighbors, while projecting influence into my own backyard.
He's indicated that he is interested in making gains where they threaten
Russia as much or more than his more immediate neighbors. Further, neither
Germany nor France offered an early provocation against the other. There
wasn't the F01 western war that I'd hoped for as a distraction from me for
Germany and England.</P>

<P>Western builds are more interesting.
England's build restores the tension between himself and his neighbors that
the convoy eased a moment ago. He would have been well advised to keep his
hand hidden with a build of F Edi. France's double barreled fleet build is an interesting strategy and an apparent peace overture to Germany, though
it's unclear whether he means to threaten Italy, England or both. Conversely,
Germany has built two armies. This is a peace overture to England, plus,
it creates a unit advantage for himself in a land war with France.</P>

<P>My own build is unorthodox. Most players would regard F StP/nc as the
only sensible build other than A Mos. I don't want to build A Mos, however,
because I think that one more army in the southern theater is all I need
for 1902, and that's going to be where the A War goes. The only other purpose
of an army in Moscow is defense, but Russia's opening advantage of an extra
unit (and the extra tempi it carries) calls for the attempt to use that advantage early while it can still be significant, so I prefer to build in StP where there is more immediate potential for gain in Scandanavia. My experience has been that a fleet/army pair is a better fighting group
in Scandanavia than two fleets. The army is often able to project power on this peninsula more effectively than a second fleet, due to the bi-coastal
nature of the geography.</P>

<P>Although tempo count is going to look like objective numbers,
it's more art than science. Rather than count up the number of successful
moves, my idea is to count the result in terms of distance of each unit from the home SC in which it started. I think that will give a much more
accurate picture of progress than merely counting successful movements. Tempo is also a relative thing. Overall tempo accomplishment is a good indication
of who is leading the mobilization effort, but it doesn't tell one everything.
One also needs to take into account the degree to which the tempi of one's
opponents were directed against oneself, one's allies and one's enemies.</P>

<P>Note that, for England and Italy, I count each step of a convoyed army
as a tempo, as well it should be. I have often seen other authors describe
a convoy as a waste of time because the convoying fleets do not move. That's
not precisely true. What is occurring is that the convoying fleets are <I>transferring</I>
their movement potential to the convoyed army. Convoys are often the quickest
way to accomplish a given task (and occasionally the only way). Readers may wish to peruse the many Sherlock Holmes puzzles published at the Pouch.
Convoys are the key to many of these puzzles' solutions. Several of these
puzzles dramatically illustrate the power of convoys to speed movement in
a way that would not be possible by any other method.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>I've been as tempo-efficient as anyone
and I've got more units of force than anyone. Absent Austro-Turkish cooperation,
I'm in firm control of the chain of provinces from Rum-Gal-War-Lvn and am
already disputing control of the Boh-Sil-Pru zone. Since Italy is playing
for a Lepanto, I am expecting cooperation from my Turkish neighbor against
Austria. With a pair of units poised for action in Scandanavia, I'm also
in a position to exert decisive influence against the lone English and German
units in that area of the board. I'm concerned about the English army in
Norway, but not overly so, as I expect to see conflict heat up between France
and England after three fleet builds between them. My guess at this point
is that France will get caught between the English fleets and the German
armies. I've started well and have every reason to believe things will get
better.</P>

<P>Strategically, Austria has the right idea
with this attempt at active defense (i.e. attacking Rumania with support),
but the tactics misfire. There's nothing wrong with his order for the army
in Vienna, since marching the Italian army from Venice through Tyrolia and
Bohemia is a common Lepanto maneuver and trying to support it is a worthwhile
gamble. The coordination of the armies in Budapest and Serbia, however, is backwards. Austria cannot know if I will attack Budapest from Galicia
or from Rumania. If the attack comes from Galicia, the defense will fail,
since the army in Rumania will certainly be supported by the fleet in Sevastapol
(and there is no rational reason to hope that Turkey would cut that support
by attacking Sevastapol). If Austria orders A Ser-Rum, A Bud S A Ser-Rum,
however, the result is either to stand off the Russian attack on Budapest,
or to exchange Rumania for Budapest. These orders also eliminate from the
analysis a potential cut of the Serbian army's support by Turkey (which is what actually occurred). In fact, only the unlikely combination of A Rum-Bud, A Gal S A Rum-Bud, F Sev-Rum, Turkish F Bla S Russian F Sev-Rum
(or some other variation of supported attack on Rum by Turkey and/or Russia)
defeats this defense. The moves actually chosen by Austria may be defeated
50% of the time by Russia alone and by any number of combinations of Russian
and Turkish moves together. In fact, in combination with A Vie S A Bud, this defense would have been rock solid. What at first glance looks like
bad luck or bad guessing by Austria is, in fact, a tactical misplay.</P>

Note that England's need to passively defend his army in Norway costs him
the opportunity to exert decisive force over the Channel. Trying to split
his interests between Scandanavia and France this early in the game is already
costing him. It would have been better for him to convoy that army south
in 1901 if he had intended an attack on France or, conversely, to follow
up his 1901 strategy consistently by building in Edinburgh and pursuing an
advantage in Scandanavia. As it stands, England can't possibly succeed against
France alone. He doesn't have a decisive force advantage due to the two French fleet builds, and France is more than capable of exerting sufficient
control over the critical blue water provinces that separate England and
France. I think that, like me, England was anticipating a German attack on France. That Italy decided to move against France is about to come as an undoubtedly pleasant
surprise, but as to Germany, both he and I are about to be unpleasantly surprised.</P>

<P>Were I Austria, I would have been more concerned about protecting Greece from Turkey. Budapest
will only be retaken if Russia attempts either a useless defense of Warsaw
or attempts to take Vienna in the Fall. The former is not likely and the
latter would only result in an exchange of centers, with no hope of holding
Budapest after that. Austria didn't accomplish anything, is holding on to
Greece only by virtue of luck, and could actually be worse off if he had
succeeded in recapturing Budapest. An alternative for Austria to consider
was simply securing his centers and biding his time until the German attack
forced Russia to loosen his grip. A bolder alternative was to seek a build
by stabbing into Venice. The Italian obviously cannot be relied upon to help so the Austria might as well help himself to Italy's centers. After
Italy's westward lunge in the Spring, his control of Venice is in dispute,
and attempting the stab would have been a reasonable gambit.</P>

<P>England has to be happy about his position against
France, who has abandoned the English front to fight the Italian bogeyman.
England hasn't found a new SC this year, but he's improved his position a great deal, has no enemy but France, and is poised to strike against France
in 1903. England now controls all sea provinces bordering the Isles and the zone of dispute between England and France has suddenly shifted to the
French coast and the French soft spot at the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.</P>

<P>Now it's France's turn to over-react. The Italian threat did not merit this much attention,
for the same geographic reasons that Italy was ill-advised to take the
French build so much to heart. Aside from representing a certain waste of
tempi, it's also not good for France to remove so much force influence from
the English front, especially after poking a sharp stick at him, as this
France did in the Spring. Finally, I very much question the attack on Holland.
France will not gain an additional SC if it succeeds (as he does not yet
own Belgium) and it only serves to antagonize Germany. It could represent
a signal of alliance to England ("hey! let's attack Germany, instead of each other!"), but after France's S02, it's a weak signal that's likely to be ignored.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>Naturally, I'm unhappy with the loss of a home center,
but my position is not critical. With the exception of Germany, none of the other players in this game has done particularly well. Austria is a poor tactician and will not stand up to a serious attack. Italy and Turkey
have both wasted a lot of time. France and England are embarking on what
is, typically, a prolonged fleet battle. If I can find a way to meet the
German threat, I should still be in very good shape this game.</P>

<P>The Kaiser is drawing a bead on Sweden. Time to gamble on England's Diplomacy smarts. He should see that using his army in Norway to defend my fleet in Sweden against the

<P>France had a lot of movements succeed, but also did
a lot of back-tracking. For example, his army that started in Marseilles
is back in that center, resulting in a net of zero tempi for that unit's
four orders in this game. England and Germany have used tempi most efficiently
so far. Though I've wasted a lot of tempi, the advantage of being Russia --
extra
units and extra tempi -- is helping me stay afloat. Austria and Turkey have
both done poorly, but Italy has a meager three tempi to show for two years of
development time.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>It
doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that I'd better get busy against Germany. He matches me in force, is ahead of me in tempi and has superior
control of space, especially Russian provinces (not to mention control of
one of my home supply centers!). I count myself in second place presently, owing primarily
to my combined force and tempo advantage over the other five players. England
and France are roughly equal, with England's tempo and space advantage presently
offsetting France's force advantage. However, it's important to note that
England's advantage will evaporate if he doesn't move to capitalize on it
quickly. Turkey, Austria and Italy haven't accomplished much, but Turkey
is best of those three. Italy, whose only active unit is the fleet in the
Ionian Sea, has accomplished almost nothing and Austria is in even worse
shape, having accomplished no more than Italy and presently being under
attack by two powers. Tukey, by contrast, has three well deployed units and
is poised for a breakthrough against either Austria or myself, depending
upon who should fail first.</P>

succeeds in restoring the centers of his homeland, but loses Greece and two tempi--a very high price for victory. Austria now has exactly one unit
outside a home center. Even though he's seemingly won a victory this turn,
his position is palpably disintegrating. Given that Germany was in control
of Galicia (despite my occupation of it), Austria should have considered
a more active plan that assumed that I could not support the army in Budapest
from Galicia. He retreats Greece to Albania, but my feeling is that he didn't

that dislodged fleet in the Fall? The convoy looks tempting, but in reality,
it's a low percentage play. France had three units bordering Picardy, so
his control of that province is undisputed. The odds of being able to land
a unit there had to be considered low. England had the high percentage play
in attacking Belgium with support. Given France and Germany's history, there
was almost no chance of that unit being supported in place. England had to consider that his spatial and tempo advantage was temporary and seek to convert it to more immediate gains, such as taking Belgium.</P>

<P>In a single turn, Germany goes from having a powerful
cluster of armies controlling key provinces in western Russia to having three disconnected and uncoordinated armies that don't even reliably control
Warsaw. He reacts to the hostile French orders for his army in Belgium and
the presence of a French army in Paris by retreating his Bohemian army to
Munich. The removal of this extra unit of force from the Russian front drains
the momentum from his attack for the sake of passive defense. The army in
the Ukraine is now cut off from his other units and is only good for protecting
Warsaw. If he was going to try this play, then attempting my other soft spot at Livonia was probably the better route, as that would have set up
more potential attack options in the Fall. What I had feared most was that
he would support himself into Galicia. That would have presented me with
an insurmountable defensive task. I should send France a thank-you note for those A Bel-Hol orders, as they've distracted Germany into a second rate continuation of his attack on me.</P>

<P>I knew when I wrote these orders
that the army in Budapest was a goner, but it still hurts to see it go (along
with its two tempi and the SC it occupied). I was anticipating the German's
maneuver and considered it absolutely essential to my survival that he not
succeed in occupying Warsaw and one of my soft spot provinces at the same
time. That necessitated A Gal-War, which would leave the army in Budapest
inadequately defended. The payoff is that Germany's armies are now separated
and vulnerable and I have a legitimate opportunity to reclaim Warsaw and
force him to remove a unit. I opted to support Turkey into Serbia one move
too late. He evidently grew tired of waiting for that support and developed
a new plan.</P>

<P>This turn could have gone better, but I'm not completely unhappy. Everybody but Turkey pretty much spun their
wheels this Spring and I'm not unhappy at all about Turkey's progress since
it ensures that Austria won't prosper and, for now at least, Turkey has proven that he wishes to be my ally. Germany has gone from having a powerful
cluster of armies in Warsaw, Silesia and Bohemia poised to tear into the
heart of Russia to having three disconnected armies that aren't likely to
hold his current gains. The first half of my gambit in giving up Budapest
has paid off, as Germany lost much of his positional advantage. For now,
this positional loss more than offsets his presence in Ukraine. I need to
recapture Warsaw in the Fall, though, if I want to deal the Kaiser a lasting
blow. I intend to go all out for this result.</P>

<P>He's probing the English defenses. Personally, I like to try sneaking
in the back door via NAO sooner rather than later. England has plenty of
wherewithal to defend against a fleet in the Channel, since he has a superior
force influence in that province. The force influence in NAO, however, is
even and the English fleet in the Irish Sea can be considered an overburdened
defender, being responsible for both the Channel and NAO. A direct attack
on NAO spreads out England's defenses by forcing them to cover the entire
perimiter of the Isles. England will generally fall more swiftly to such
an attack since he is no longer able to concentrate his forces at a single
breakthrough point. France has also moved from merely irritating Germany
to full blown attack mode. That's a big break for me.</P>

to take Sweden now, he would have been better advised to remove the less

<P>Did I say that no-press games are slow developing?
These tempo numbers sure bear that out. Imagine where Italy would be right
now had he ignored the French build of a fleet in Marseilles in 1901 and
embarked on a consistent plan of eastern conquest. Imagine how pretty England's
game would look, if he had taken Belgium instead of trying that ill-fated
convoy. Imagine how healthy Austria's game might be if he had defended against
the initial Russian attacks with technical precision. The Russo-German war
has been costly to both sides. Had Germany turned against France in 1902
instead of me, we could both be happily tearing into our neighbors' SC's right now and be two large powers dominating this game.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>My own position is much improved from the end of 1902, and I'm happy to have survived my gross misclaculation
regarding Germany's plans. As it stands, the prospects of France, Germany,
Russia and Turkey are all about equal. Each of these powers has attained
roughly equal tempo advancement and is now firmly in control of their home
territories, soft spot provinces and "natural" neutrals. All of these powers
stand roughly equal in time, space and force, and they all have opportunities
to improve their positions. England and Italy still have prospects, but only if their neighbors make mistakes that they can capitalize upon. Austria's
position is virtually without prospects of improvement, unless Turkey were
to have a sudden (and unlikely) change of heart.</P>

France has three units of force influencing Picardy, and effectively controls
every land and coastal province adjacent to it except Belgium, which is now equally influenced by Germany. England only has the Channel fleet to
back this play in the Fall, unless he wants to lose Norway. If England was

Germany now, but too late. It's now clear why antagonizing Germany by futilely
attacking Holland was a bad idea. Belgium is now lost. The gains in tempo

now that Turkey, by retaining his influence over Sevastapol and Rumania,
is contemplating stabbing me this Fall.

F Bla-Con, which would make me very happy.</P>


<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>I would rate this turn
an unqualified success for myself and a qualified success for France (who
didn't wish to risk losing an SC, but should not find it a fatal setback).
Germany has two builds, but he's fighting on two fronts and his position
is insecure. These factors offset the force gains. England's convoy fixation
has likely cost him Norway and placed him in grave positional danger, from
which I believe he will not recover. Turkey and Italy's game of musical chairs in the Aegean and Eastern Mediterranian is not significant for either
side. Austria hasn't much time left.</P>

Austria retreats Galicia to Vienna, but
a retreat to Silesia instead could have added

three SC's (including a Russian SC) and there are always interesting possibilities

He has to be kicking himself, since France left Paris unguarded, while England's
army ran away. Whenever you're fighting against the odds, it seldom makes
sense to prefer defensive maneuvers to offensive ones. Cutting Germany's
support at Denmark was a clever try. There was at least some chance that
he could have restored Norway to himself that way. Germany's attempt to support him back into Norway was also predictable, however, and England's
better bet to retain that SC.</P>

<P>I can understand risking Paris and I can understand wanting to give the army in Belgium a clear line of retreat, but France seems to have overlooked
the possibility of a dislodged English army retreating into an unguarded
Paris. If France intends to give up the defense of Belgium, A Bur-Ruh, A
Bel-Bur, A Gas-Par (or A Gas S F Bre) were moves to consider, since they
would keep the pressure on Germany. Neither France nor England were thinking
about the forward retreat tactic this turn and France dodges a bullet when
the English army runs away. Strongly to be considered as alternatives to
F NAO-Lpl were F NAO-Iri and F NAO-Cly. Since England's F Iri-Lpl was practically
forced, each of these orders would have improved France's control of space
by allowing an English retreat.</P>

<P>There's a certain depth
and cleverness to Turkey's moves. He ensures that his army in Greece cannot
be dislodged. He knows that if he takes Serbia, he loses Greece and Italy
gets a build, but he strives for it anyway because the positioning of both
his armies and fleets will be improved if that happens. [The army will project
more force influence in landlocked Serbia than it would in Greece, while at the same time, he would have had a fleet in either the Aegean or the Ionian,
which would have been serious trouble for Italy.] These moves strove for
active, positional play. I'm also thrilled to see his fleet steam out of
the Black Sea. I'm finally free to maneuver the Rumanian army without fear
of a stab from Turkey.</P>

<P>The move to the Baltic Sea pays off big time. There will be no German
ground forces in my future. Getting both of those fleets into the game against
me will be tempo consuming and much less efficient than a land assault. I now have the chance to crush Austria for good and use those builds to generate a land-based counter-offensive to what will be Germany's sea-borne
assault.</P>

<P>England's
loss of tempo mirrors his loss of position and force. Austria's last place
tempo count after four years is as good an illustration as any of the weakness
of his game at this point. Germany's aquisition of two new SC's by shifting
fronts has been tempo consuming. I've made great strides this year in use
of tempo, which gives me a temporary advantage against Germany that offsets
his builds.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>I'm
back in the saddle again. Germany's two builds have been greatly neutralized
by my temporary advantage in tempo and force influence over space in his
own heartland. It's also true that he's fighting a two front battle, which
will further slow him. I have an opportunity, perhaps, to convert my tempo
advantage into something useful. France's loss of Belgium is a temporary
setback, as the whole of the British Isles should open before him. Austria
will get crushed between the Russian hammer and the Turkish anvil. After
that, the Turkish advantage in tempo and force should turn the tide against
the Italian, while I hope to use my share of Austrian builds to fuel a renewed
effort against Germany. A Russo-Turkish Juggernaut is finally on track and
ready to roll.</P>

<P>In one turn, England's position went from viable to hopeless. In the EOG's I asked England why he was so insistent on trying
this convoy and what he was hoping to accomplish that would offset the loss
of Norway. England's reply stated that in light of "the war with France" and his need to bring all of his forces to bear against his enemy, he hadn't
been considering the security of his SC in Norway at all. Even in no-press
mode, Diplomacy is a strategic game first and a tactical game second. England
needed to fashion strategic objectives and play for them if he hoped to make progress. Throwing units at a single enemy without a plan for playing
the whole board is not the path to victory.</P>

<P>It's now been
four seasons since an Austrian unit moved by virtue of anything other than
a retreat. Austria's attempt to reoccupy the key province of Galicia is predictably futile, as my force influence over that province is greater than his own. The attempt costs him Serbia, which should have been of much
greater concern to him. The Turkish army in Serbia will shortly undermine
his position, as the combined ground forces of Turkey and Russia will outgun
and outflank the three Austrian armies. Attempting to support Italy into

the Mid-Atlantic Ocean with support was a good try, as he could well have

<P>France uses the unbreakable support to force

could have entered the Mid-Atlantic Ocean from Irish Sea unsupported on this move, taken Portugal in the Fall, and stuck a nasty thorn into France's
side in that fashion. A good alternative was to continue to stretch the coverage of the overburdened English defenders with F NAO-Cly, after which
England must voluntarily retreat his units to protect his SC's (i.e., A Lpl-Edi

<P>Germany makes

for him in that respect, but his army in Sweden is not cooperating with his fleets and he will not be able to exert serious force influence against
me as he did before, nor will he generate a decisive attack on any of my
centers this year. The fleet in Finland would be much better positioned in either the Gulf of Bothnia or Skagerrak, where it would exert a more powerful influence over the surrounding provinces.</P>

<P>Supporting the outgunned fleet in place is a weak strategy.
Like England, Italy would have been better off trying to outguess his attacker
and sneak into an SC (his retreat to the south coast of Bulgaria leaves
his unit exposed for the Fall without hope of keeping the center).
Supporting himself into Greece would have actually
worked. Supporting himself in place had no hope of accomplishing anything.
A good rule to follow: when outgunned, attack and hope to hit a weak point;
standing in place only lets your opponent aim all of his own guns at you.
Italy is finally desparate enough to go snipe hunting with his northern army. He is no doubt hoping that I will support him into Munich.</P>

<P>I was not actually expecting to be in the North Sea,
as this move was primarily designed to bounce an expected F Hol-Nth. Nevertheless,
I'm not unhapppy to be there, as my occupation of this province has to be
giving Germany headaches regarding what I will do from there. The dislodging
of my fleet in Baltic Sea was expected. My thrust into Silesia puts some
pressure on German home SC's. I don't expect to take any, but I expect to
slow the German down. I didn't attempt Budapest because I saw that as a low
percentage play in the Spring, as I'd have little chance of holding it in the
Fall.  I retreated my dislodged fleet to the Gulf of Bothnia.
Retreating to Denmark would have
been terrific, giving me a connected pair of fleets on Germany's opposite
flank, but St. Petersburg needs to be defended. I would have given up St.
Pete to get this positional advantage, if I could have gotten an SC in trade
for it. But I couldn't afford to give up a unit this year without conceding
too much advantage to Germany.</P>

destruction of Italy's forward fleet will crush the attack for good.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>England, Austria and Italy have all
been dealt serious blows this turn and their positions will only get worse
from here. Turkey and France will capitalize on their declining neighbors,
while Germany and Russia resume their costly conflict. I am dismayed at the disorganized posture of my units. I am concerned that my Austrian builds
will not come in time to shore up my precarious position in the north.</P>

would be attacking Munich and could have supported him in to force a German

<P>Germany closed the
tempo gap between us in a hurry and I'm not happy to have squandered my temporary advantage in tempi. Austria, England and Italy all reflect their
dire straits in their tempo counts. Italy's extra two tempi over England
actually counts against him, as those represent the tempi expended in convoying
an army to Tunis, where it has remained this entire game--out of play and
ineffective. Though their maneuvering this year has been effective, real
progress for France and Turkey has been slow coming.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>Germany has to be counted the game
leader again. He leads in tempo and force and has more of my SC's and key
provinces at risk than I do of his. France is pinning down three of Germany's
units, but that still leaves Germany a four-to-three force advantage against me. If
Germany gets aggressive and manages to coordinate an attack against Scandanavia
and St. Petersburg, I could be in serious trouble again. Turkey is poised
for major progress in the upcoming year. I could be a beneficiary of Turkey's
growth by picking up Budapest and Vienna if Turkey remains an ally. France's
ability to pick up an English SC is by no means certain. He risks falling
seriously behind Turkey and Germany if he can't maneuver more decisively
against England this year.</P>

St. Petersburg would be isolated and weak, making recapture of that SC relatively
easy. I determined, though, that keeping St. Pete was the better plan because
I could keep it open and build there. Building in St. Petersburg will give
me an opportunity to win Sweden next year. This plan conserves tempi and

<P>England keeps his fleet in the Mid-Atlantic
to spite France. Germany balances his land and sea forces, but building an army in Kiel means an extra tempo expended in activating it. I intend
to attempt Sweden, while keeping Warsaw secure from Germany this time. I
also hope that Turkey noticed that I didn't build in Sevastapol.</P>

<P>The big story is obviously Turkey. With
his enemies warring in front of him, Turkey sweeps out of his corner. For
all of his successful moves, Germany's net tempo count is zero, with his
surrender of three tempi in returning the army in Sweden to Berlin.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>Germany and I are
at tempo parity and force parity. At the moment, I feel I have the advantage
because, since Germany is fighting on two fronts, he will find it very difficult
to bring sufficient force to bear against me without critically weakening
his control of space on the opposite front and incurring losses there. Turkey
is only slightly behind Germany and I. Though he trails us by two SC's, he
should make that up very shortly by picking up centers from the squabbling
Asutria and Italy. It's my estimation that Turkey will likely continue our
alliance as long as he has easy Austrian and Italian SC's to claim. I'll need to watch for the knife after that but, hopefully, by then I'll have
put Germany out of the picture. France, behind in tempi and force, and without
the spatial control to force new gains on his own, is flirting with also-ran
status.</P>

<P>Three new SC's, plus the concession of all disputed provinces by Germany.
This is practically a gift from the Diplomacy gods. Actually, it's a gift
from Germany, who has abandoned his French front to pursue a new strategy.
France hasn't done anything different or clever, but persistence pays off.
France, like myself, has been banking on the fact that Germany can't afford
to split his units between two fronts indefinately.</P>

<P>After Germany's
relatively passive 1906, these aggressive moves are a shock. Suddenly, I
face a five-to-three
force disadvantage in Scandanavia and I've lost positional control
there as a result. My recapture of Sweden looks very temporary (with Germany
retreating his fleet to the Baltic) and Norway
is lost. Germany has sacrificed heavily to achieve these gains, however,
giving up both Belgium and Edinburgh to bring all of his forces to bear against me. As a result, both he and I are likely to face a removal this
year, while France picks up two SC's on the cheap.</P>

<P>I expected to be secure in
keeping Norway or Sweden, and possibly both. Now it seems I'll keep niether
and there will be a swarm of black units swallowing up the north. As I'd
planned several years ago, however, my compensation is an overwhelming ground
attack against Germany proper, though for now I retreat my Silesia
army to Warsaw. The Kaiser will take Scandanavia, and St.
Petersburg if he's determined, but I'll roll through everything south of
Denwark while he does so. Thanks to France's continued beligerence, the German commander has waited too long to commit his forces against me and
when he does, the price is too great for him to succeed. Turkey's moves are a joy to me. It appears that I'll be able to count on his alliance for
some time yet.</P>

opening up a front with Russia this turn.</P>

<P>The problem with winning three new SC's in the Spring is that you have
to sit on them in the Fall. France makes the best of it by writing signal
convoys for his Fleets, but the signals aren't very sensible. France is signalling for a Turkish alliance, but it's hard to see why either player
would expect such a thing to materialize. Had he sent a signal to Turkey
and a signal to Russia, that would have laid the groundwork for working toward a three-way draw. It's either going to be that or a fight to the finish. The fleet built in Brest all the way back in 1901 finally makes its first sojourn out of port. Six years is a long time to wait to develop
a unit.</P>

<P>I count
these moves a huge success. By occupying Bohemia, Silesia and Prussia, I'm
putting overwhelming pressure on Berlin and Munich. Instead of trying for
Berlin this year, I focused on positioning. As a special bonus, there are
dislodged armies from Bohemia and Silesia that are very likely to both be
retreating to Munich. If I've guessed correctly, the German will retreat
his army to Munich to defend that SC from an Austrian retreat, while the
Austrian will also retreat to Munich and both armies will vanish from the
center of the board. Then I'll simply steamroll my connected group of armies
through Germany next year and that will be that. I don't even want to think
about how much pain that a German forward retreat to Galicia would cause
me. The convoy signal is my way of asking Turkey to advance his units away
from our mutual front. I also am able to retreat forward to Skagerrak, where
my unit continues to exert pressure on all three Scandinavian centers.</P>

<P>Turkey continues to surge forward.
I'm disappointed at his self bounce in Bulgaria. Does he really believe that I'd go for that suicidal one-center stab this turn? I'll have to try
to account for Turkish paranoia in future orders.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
The retreats go as just I had hoped, and
another gamble pays off. The dislodged armies both make tracks for Munich
and annihilate each other. No German army appears in Galicia to ruin me.
Not only did I advance into the key barren zone provinces, but I removed
two enemy units of force from the board and now have effective control of
all three German home centers. Not bad for a season's work. Those results
were well worth the loss of a center to achieve.</P>

<P>If Turkey
wants to stab me, this is the turn to do it. I felt that my removal was forced. My position in the north against the advancing German forces is precarious. My three fleets, though disconnected, can all cooperate to attempt
to hold St. Petersburg, or attempt to re-occupy Sweden or Norway. German
forces outnumber me in that theater, but my ability to concentrate my three
forces on a single target keeps Germany off-balance, so I can't afford to
remove a northern fleet. Removing any of the northern three armies gives
up my forced attack on German SC's. Giving up the army in Vienna is as inviting
to Turkish treachery as removing the fleet in Rumania. I'm gambling that
a Sultan who has remained loyal for seven years will remain loyal for an
eighth. As I said before, I don't think that he'll come after me until he
sweeps up all of the Austrian and Italian centers that are left. This removal
leaves me with 100% of my forces arrayed against Germany.</P>

<P>We're at that stage of the game where the rich simply
get richer. Notably, Turkey has tripled his tempo count and nearly doubled
his size in just two years. It pays to have your enemies stab each other
in front of you. Similarly, France has Germany to thank for his success.
First, for taking Edinburgh from England, then for abandoning the French front to pursue Russia.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>Even after the German hit me with everything he had, he could not
achieve a winning position. To the contrary, I am set to steamroll his homeland.
With Austria reduced to a peripatetic unit in Naples, I've no distractions
from German conquest in the upcoming year. That is, unless Turkey stabs me, which is a tolerable risk and one I had to take to ensure that I can
secure my position against the German aggressor. With a suddenly large and
hostile France to his west now equalling the size and hostility of Russia
to his East, Germany is finished, despite his apparent equal size. France
and I will grow from German conquest, but Turkey leads, with even geater
opportunities for growth in front of him.</P>

<P>After attaining
an aggressive position in Scandanavia, Germany enters a set of very weak
orders, failing to put that force he'd concentrated there to any use. He
backs off half of his force and makes an easily countered attack on St. Petersburg. Having effectively ceded me control of all of the Scandanavian
provinces, he now has no hope of either reclaiming his losses or even of
capturing St. Petersburg to spite me.
Additionally, with his retreat from Norway to Sweden,
he again forsakes the forward retreat for the passive one. Retreating
to Barents Sea would have given me many more headaches.  The dislodged Berlin
retreats to Kiel.

<P>Better
than I'd hoped. There was no reason to believe that I'd actually achieve

and he has returned to his preference for defensive maneuvers, willingly
conceding space and robbing himself of tempo. My attack succeeds all the
more quickly for that. Turkey can simply walk into two of my SC's this Fall,
and if he doesn't stab me, it will be a miracle. Without builds from Germany
to compensate, I'd be finished. My vulnerable position vis a vis Turkey is the price I've paid for German conquest. I simply continue to hope that
Turkey will be too distracted by his swift progress to stab me.</P>

<P>Turkey continues to storm out over the board, as seven of eight
orders result in a gain of tempo.  He has Venice in hand and an invitation
to take Naples. He has complete control of Austria, the Balkans and the Eastern half of the Mediterranian and he is rapidly securing control of Italy and the Western Mediterranian. His control of Austria and the Balkans
includes absolute control of Budapest and Rumania and he has nothing to lose by depriving me of those SC's. It's hard to imagine ever being more in the driver's seat than Turkey is at the end of this season.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>After
this season, it's apparent that this game will resolve itself into a three
way battle between France, Russia and Turkey. I fear that the issue will
rapidly become the ability of Russia and France to stalemate Turkey before
he reaches 18 SC's.</P>

not have been my calculation. Turkey will wage a long slow battle for many
years to come, as a result of this missed opportunity.</P>

<P>The speed of Germany's
destruction is astonishing, and a testament to the futility of playing defensively.
The speed of Turkey's growth is equally astonishing. The Russo-Turkish alliance
has allowed me to defeat Germany, but it's given far more gains to Turkey
than I've won for myself. I must begin to work on slowing Turkey down. Germany's
gifts to France have created a French power nearly on a par with Russia and Turkey. At this point, that's good. I'd prefer to see Turkey get a little
competition in front of him.</P>

<P>It took until 1908 to get our first
elimination. I leave Austria in the tempo count to illustrate a point. One
of the dominant powers left in this game has only managed to move forward
by 17 tempi. Austria had 53 orders to write in this game and was alive for
eight game years. That's more than ample opportunity to achieve 17 tempi,
get three to four builds and to make something of this game. It's tempting to say that Austria's elimination is typical, expected and excusable in a no-press
game, since he begins the game surrounded, but that's not the story here.
This Austria enjoyed an alliance with Italy until he destroyed it with a
stab. This Austria could have easily held his ground against an early Russian
assault that should not have worked, then counter-attacked when the Russian
was reeling under pressure from German armies. But, time and again, this
Austria missed opportunities. This Austria
is gone, not because he was attacked, but because he was a less capable tactician than his attackers.</P>

<H3>Evaluation</H3>
<P>The game is rapidly entering an end-game stage; a three
way dynamic. Turkey is in the best position to push his advantage on two
fronts, but he shouldn't be able to cross the stalemate lines if I get decent
cooperation from France on that point. France and Russia both straddle the
stalemate lines, but that sword cuts both ways. If either of us get too big, Turkey should throw his wieght behind the smaller player to maintain
balance. Properly played, this ending shouldn't result in anything but a
draw.</P>

<P>In a more immediate sense, the specifics of my position are
pretty good. The moment of tremendous vulnerability to a Turkish stab has
passed. I am in firm control of Scandanavia and the German homeland now and should pick up those last three German SC's for myself, making me the
dominant power on the board, as measured by force. I intend to move at least
two armies toward the Turkish front. My intention is not to stab, but to
restore some force influence over the SC's I own in Austria and the Balkans.
This is likely to cause some tension, but I'm hoping that my Turkish ally
will not see this as a stab and over-react. Even if he does, I should be
able to compensate with the German SC's I pick up and keep Turkey from doing
serious damage before help from France arrives. At any rate, with all of
the minor powers dead or nearly so, I no longer consider the risk of a Turkish
stab minimal.</P>

<HR>
<h2 ALIGN=center>Lessons of the Opening Phase</H2>
<P>
There is a popular saying among chess players that the game of chess is won
by the player making the second to last mistake. The point of the saying is
that no one is capable of playing the perfect game and more games are won by
taking advantage of the unsound play of others than by the personal
brilliance of the winning player. This game aptly illustrates that prinicple
in action at the Diplomacy board.
<P>
None of the dominant players in this game has played perfectly. France
became ascendent in the E/F conflict only because England's last tactical
miscue negated his own. France's ascendency over Germany also has much more
to do with Germany's strategic choices in this game than his own. In my own
case, an early gross miscalculation resulted in the loss of Warsaw to
Germany and the creation of a potentially crippling positional disadvantage.
Twice more after that, Germany could have seriously crippled my efforts by
aggressively following up on an advantage I failed to prevent him from
achieving. Additionally, the G/R rivalry resulted in an overwhelming moment
of weakness <i>vis a vis</i> Turkey that could just as easily have ruined my game
as anything else. Turkey's play in this game is as close to perfect as it
gets, but I find fault in his conservative treatment of the R/T alliance:
first, in needlessly worrying about petty one-center stabs; and, later,
passing up a golden stab opportunity of his own. He and I stand as equals,
more or less, when he could likely be towering over me and everyone else in
the game.
<P>
Conversely, none of the other players has been done in by just a single
mistake. The other four players all had to commit multiple strategic and
tactical errors to achieve lesser power status. Even Austria could have
recovered from the early loss of Budapest had he defended correctly after
that and stayed viable long enough to sieze Russia's later moments of
weakness caused by the G/R conflict. It should be said, though, that Italy
has less margin for error than other nations. Other powers in this game did
not suffer as greatly as did Italy for early game reversals of direction and
strategy. That this mistake alone more or less did in Italy is a good
illustration of why Italy is such a hard power to play.
<P>
Finally, it is worth noting that opening moves often had little to say about
the subsequent directions players took in the game. England's 1901 indicated
a desire to pursue advantage in Scandanavia, but that plan was quickly
abandoned. Germany's 1901 indicated a strategy of rushing to the west and,
in 1902, he promply rushed to the east. France's 1901 build in the south was
actually a prelude to an attack in the north. Russia's early desire for a
southern strategy had to be quickly abandoned for an active hand in northern
affairs. Turkey's early occupation of the Black Sea did not raise tensions
with Russia, but rather had the effect of cementing a Russo-Turkish
alliance. Opening strategy articles tend to vastly overrate the effect that
1901 has on the remainder of the game. Press or no press, far more is
decided by the strategies players choose subsequent to 1901 than is affected
by their activities in the opening year.
<P>
At this point, I'll conclude this initial article, and we'll continue
next time from 1909.  Here at the end of 1908, the opening stages of
the game have clearly run their course, 
so now we're set to see what the end-game holds.
<P>
Until then....
