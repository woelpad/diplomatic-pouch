Okay, let's see here.  These are in no particular order.

First, some groundwork.

Tell us a little bit about yourself.  (Others you get in on this "interview"
should do the same, of course.)

Size of the development team involved in the Dip project?

How many were familiar with Diplomacy beforehand?  (And how familiar?)

How long did the development take?

What language was it written in (just for my own info, actually)?

Diplomacy is rather unique among games in its variability, and as you know,
a jillion different "variants" exist.  Was any thought given to making the
product adaptable for other maps?  If so, how easy would it be for the hobby
to set up a map "plug-in" collection or to work with you and Hasbro to
provide for the expandability of the game?

What would you say were the most difficult hurdles?

I see that you mentioned Ken Lowe's judge.  Was the actual (spaghetti) code
ever referenced?

Is the Ken Lowe rule that convoy paths must be explicitly spelled out used
(frankly, I hope it is)?  If not, how are the "unwanted convoy" and the
convoy disruption rule handled?

How is Pandin's Paradox handled?

How much material on tactics is provided with the game?  That is, is a
"help" system in place that actually incorporates the "Library of Diplomacy
Openings" and "The Library of Diplomacy Tactics" (examples from The Pouch)
into it?

Speaking of The Pouch, I am curious as to whether it was used (and if so,
how heavily) as a source of information for you and your team.

Are you aware of any upgrades that Hasbro has planned for you guys to
do in the near or longer term?

Are you aware that you have the best job in the world, having been paid to
code a Diplomacy adjudicator?  Are you guys hiring?

Please tell us a little bit about the AI.  How are negotiations handled?
How complicated can they get?  Do you simply propose moves (or ask for
certain moves NOT to be made) and get a yes/no answer [which could be a
lie]?  And receive similar proposals deom the AI players?  Are DMZ's
negotiated by the AI players?  How about medium to long-term goals,
such as a division of a specific set of SC's to be taken?

Is the system meant for real-time play only or are PBEM-esque games
(lasting weeks and months) possible.  That is, must all players who wish
to communicate with each other be "online" with each other at all times
during the game?  If so, I assume that (a) games can be saved until all
players are online again if a break is needed and (b) PBEM games are being
left to the existing systems (i.e., the judges)??

Assuming a "real-time" mode is played, how are deadlines set and handled?
How about deadline misses?  Do powers get put into civil disorder?  How
are deadlines extended by players if more time is wanted/needed?

Is there a turn rollback mechanism?

Is there any restriction on "press"?  I have heard that there is a "chat"
room concept into which you can invite any other player(s), but is there
also the ability to send messages for reading later (a la PBEM)?

Did you enjoy working on the project?

Were any members of the development team involved in the organized Diplomacy
hobby before the project?

As a result of the project, have any members of the team become interested
in the game when they were not before?

Have any members of the team become sick to death of Diplomacy?  :-)

Those of us who use the Ken Lowe judge are very happy that you are
making the new product compatible with input and output from the judges.
Can you tell us more fully exactly what is being done?

I talked a bit about map variants.  How expandible is the product so that
it could handle more involved variants, such as my "Payola" and "Crystal Ball"
variants?  (Obviously, I would love to see them implemented or implementable
if I have to do them myself :-)

The hobby considers itself to be the game's greatest asset and would like
to be involved in making sure that Diplomacy is implemented and marketed
in a way the game deserves.  Do you know of any plans by you or Hasbro to
involve representatives of the hobby in any advisory or quality control
capacity?

As you are aware, there are a great many Diplomacy tournaments and
conventions scheduled every year around the world.  Will your company
or Hasbro be attending or promoting these types of hobby activities?

Do you have any knowledge of the NON-computer version of the game that
Hasbro will release?  (If so, similar follow-up questions, such as do you know
if Hasbro plans to include hobby promoting material in the boxed sets the
way Avalon Hill used to do for the Postal hobby?)

When do I sit to be videotaped and put on the "Tips from the Experts" part of
the CD?  (Like Steve Mizerak in my "Virtual Pool 2" game :-)

(Actually, this isn't a bad idea if you haven't already thought of it.
Allan Calhamer, inventor of the game, would be nice to have immortalized
on CD in your product -- I have his postal address if you need it.  Other
hobby legends (other than me, that it :-) like Edi Birsan should also
be considered.)

The Diplomacy hobby is truly international, as is made testament by the annual
world championships.  Some of the best face-to-face players in the world come
from France and Sweden, and these players have become very good friends of
mine and of other hobbyists here, via the World Championships and through
e-mail.  I have two questions here.   First, is your product multi-lingual
(I won't presume that it automatically runs outgoing player-to-player messages
through a http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com-like translator to render
them into the chosen language of the recipient, though that would be very
very cool and you might want to consider adding it, rather than forcing the
players to do the translation themselves), but rather I'm just asking if the
code itself has been internationalized?  Secondly, European nations use
alternate game-ending rules than do Americans.  That is, Frenchmen play
only the first eight game-years, and Swedes play only the first nine.
This differs from the American way of playing until the game is won or
drawn.  Does your product support such alternate rules?

Could your product be used in a tournament setting, and if so, how much
help would it be?  (That is, would a tournament-arranger be included or
possible, that would "score" and "seed" rounds using any of the accepted
Diplomacy scoring systems?)

Are you sure you don't want to hire me, if not as a coder, then as the
guy who thinks up all this great new stuff for you to do?

Well, that's all I can think of for the first batch of questions.  I look
forward to your responses and thank you VERY MUCH for taking the time
to do this!!!

Stab you soon,
Manus

I am an Assistant Producer on this project, interfacing with you and the
community at large is one of the many duties assigned to me. I am also 
one
of the Dip players previous to the project.

Here is some info on the rest of the team.

Mark Manyen is our Studio Head and has been in computer games since 
1986,
working on titles like the Chessmaster Series.

Jim Haldy is the Meyer/Glass Producer on Diplomacy, he ia a 12 year 
veteran
of the games business with over 50 titles shipped.

David Locke is our Senior Designer and has been involved in all aspects 
of
computer games for 10 years.

Kurt Mitchell is the Lead Artist on Diplomacy.

We are providing only the standard map (Eroupe 1901). We started out the
project thinking that we would do a bunch of maps, but, as we started on 
the
"Classic" map we found that the art time required was tremendous and 
stepped
back to a more do-able set of maps, which is 1 I am sorry to say. I 
would
assume that other maps may be sold as expansion packs if the original 
game
sells well enough to warrant them.

The art requirements, as expalined to me, are great and I am not sure 
that I
understand them myself.


> What would you say were the most difficult hurdles?
>
The hardest part of the project is the AI and rules engine. The rules
because of the "human" nature of them. I mean that the rules are written 
is
a way for humans to understand by a leap of intuition, coding them and 
all
the strange quirks was very difficult. The AI is by far the biggest
problem, I mean how do you go about emulating a human and human thought
process? Odi has been working on the AI since the beginning and will
continue until gold master.

I think someone here read it and decided that we would not use it. We 
did
use it to verify that we were getting the same results from our "judge" 
and
as a model for the compromises to code the rules.

Yes, you must specifiy each fleet in the convoy chain for the army being
convoyed. This is one of the places we looked to the internet judge code
for solutions.

I am not familiar with that... Please send examples and I will get back

We have our computer players selecting opening moves from a list of
"standard" opening moves in order to give the computer player a better 
Fall
1901 and Spring 1902 position to work from. Some of these moves came 
from
The Pouch, some from our own games. We have not yet implemented help or 
a
tutorial.

We read it and we did use some of the information (see opening moves

Nope. We assume that the sales numbers will drive expansions.

We do know that we have the best jobs in the world, not just due to the
Diplomacy Project but because we create games. Are we hiring? hmmm....
that's a loaded question. If I say yes, will I get flooded with resumes?
Actually we are not currently in a hiring mode, we are a small developer 
in
Chicago and need to sign a new contract in order to do any hiring. The
diplomacy team already has a new project, but, we are looking for 
another
title for our other team. We may be hiring soon...

>

The game has a negotiation phase which is broken down into two areas; 
the assembly room where all players ( including AI ) start, and the 
meeting rooms where players go off to negotiate in private. Up to six 
players can be in a meeting room at one time. Within the meeting room 
human players can construct offers for other human players and also AI 
players. At the same time players will receive offers from other human 
players and AI players. These offers can include allying ( or not ), 
attacking, moves, convoys, DMZs, bounces, and hearsay. You and the other 
players, both human and AI, are free to except or decline these offers. 
But in no way are you or the AI players bound to their acceptance. The 
AI prioritizes its goals and compares that with offers made to control 
its movement. The best AI ( we will have three ) will plan and look more 
turns out.

We will have four play modes in Diplomacy; Single player against 
computer opponents, Multi-player over a LAN or the Internet, Hot Seat 
for multiple players on one computer, and a PBEM mode.


> Assuming a "real-time" mode is played, how are deadlines set and

Diplomacy has the ability to set timers for each of the game phases. If 
a timer is set on and runs out of time, the game will try to advance to 
the next phase. For players who want no time limits, all of the timers 
can be turned off.

No.=20

In a multi-player game, messages are sent to where you are; if you are 
in the assembly, than all other players in the assembly can see your 
message. Likewise, if you are in a meeting room, only those players in 
the meeting room will get the message. You must understand that we are 
recreating the board game and the look and feel is meant to be that of 
players sitting around playing face to face.

All of the team members have shown interest in playing to varying

No map or rule variants can be done at this time.

That is really a Hasbro question. They own the rights and are publishing 
the game. They have done some promoting of titles in the past, so I 
would hope that they will do so with Diplomacy.

To the first question, yes. We will localize in 6 or 7 languages. Also, 
within the game, if you use the icons to negotiate with, it will display 
in the correct language of the other player. That means if each player 
used a version with a different language, they could play a game. 
Secondly, we are working on a game editor which will give some 
flexibility in the game. We hope to be able to set various victory 
conditions.

It is not designed for this. It is meant to be a stand alone product for 
gamers.

Please tell us a little bit about the AI. How are negotiations 
handled?<BR>&gt;=20
How complicated can they get? Do you simply propose moves (or ask 
for<BR>&gt;=20
certain moves NOT to be made) and get a yes/no answer [which could be 
a<BR>&gt;=20
lie]? And receive similar proposals deom the AI players? Are 
DMZ's<BR>&gt;=20
negotiated by the AI players? How about medium to long-term 
goals,<BR>&gt; such=20
as a division of a specific set of SC's to be taken?<BR>&gt;</P>
<P>The game has a negotiation phase which is broken down into two areas; 
the=20
assembly room where all players ( including AI ) start, and the meeting 
rooms=20
where players go off to negotiate in private. Up to six players can be 
in a=20
meeting room at one time. Within the meeting room human players can 
construct=20
offers for other human players and also AI players. At the same time 
players=20
will receive offers from other human players and AI players. These 
offers can=20
include allying ( or not ), attacking, moves, convoys, DMZs, bounces, 
and=20
hearsay. You and the other players, both human and AI, are free to 
except or=20
decline these offers. But in no way are you or the AI players bound to 
their=20
acceptance. The AI prioritizes its goals and compares that with offers 
made to=20
control its movement. The best AI ( we will have three ) will plan and 
look more=20
turns out.</P>
<P>&nbsp;</P>
<P><BR>&gt; Is the system meant for real-time play only or are 
PBEM-esque=20
games<BR>&gt; (lasting weeks and months) possible. That is, must all 
players who=20
wish<BR>&gt; to communicate with each other be &quot;online&quot; with 
each=20
other at all times<BR>&gt; during the game? If so, I assume that (a) 
games can=20
be saved until all<BR>&gt; players are online again if a break is needed 
and (b)=20
PBEM games are being<BR>&gt; left to the existing systems (i.e., the=20
judges)??<BR>&gt;</P>
<P>We will have four play modes in Diplomacy; Single player against 
computer=20
opponents, Multi-player over a LAN or the Internet, Hot Seat for 
multiple=20
players on one computer, and a PBEM mode.</P>
<P><BR>&gt; Assuming a &quot;real-time&quot; mode is played, how are 
deadlines=20
set and handled?<BR>&gt; How about deadline misses? Do powers get put 
into civil=20
disorder? How<BR>&gt; are deadlines extended by players if more time is=20
wanted/needed?<BR>&gt;</P>
<P>Diplomacy has the ability to set timers for each of the game phases. 
If a=20
timer is set on and runs out of time, the game will try to advance to 
the next=20
phase. For players who want no time limits, all of the timers can be 
turned=20
off.</P>
<P><BR>&gt; Is there a turn rollback mechanism?<BR>&gt;</P>
<P>No. </P>
<P><BR>&gt; Is there any restriction on &quot;press&quot;? I have heard 
that=20
there is a &quot;chat&quot;<BR>&gt; room concept into which you can

<P>In a multi-player game, messages are sent to where you are; if you 
are in the=20
assembly, than all other players in the assembly can see your message. 
Likewise,=20
if you are in a meeting room, only those players in the meeting room 
will get=20
the message. You must understand that we are recreating the board game

<P>Sorry, no idea.</P>

<P>This again would be a Hasbro thing.</P>
<P><BR>&gt; The Diplomacy hobby is truly international, as is made

the<BR>annual<BR>&gt; world championships. Some of the best face-to-face

have=20
become very good friends of<BR>&gt; mine and of other hobbyists here, 
via the=20
World Championships and through<BR>&gt; e-mail. I have two questions 
here.=20
First, is your product multi-lingual<BR>&gt; (I won't presume that it=20
automatically runs outgoing player-to-player<BR>messages<BR>&gt; through 
a=20
</FONT><A href=3D"http://babelfish.altavista.digital.com-like/"><FONT=20

size=3D2>=20
translator to render<BR>&gt; them into the chosen language of the 
recipient,=20
though that would be very<BR>&gt; very cool and you might want to 
consider=20
adding it, rather than forcing<BR>the<BR>&gt; players to do the 
translation=20
themselves), but rather I'm just asking if<BR>the<BR>&gt; code itself 
has been=20
internationalized? Secondly, European nations use<BR>&gt; alternate 
game-ending=20
rules than do Americans. That is, Frenchmen play<BR>&gt; only the first 
eight=20
game-years, and Swedes play only the first nine.<BR>&gt; This differs 
from the=20
American way of playing until the game is won or<BR>&gt; drawn. Does 
your=20
product support such alternate rules?<BR>&gt;</P>
<P>To the first question, yes. We will localize in 6 or 7 languages. 
Also,=20
within the game, if you use the icons to negotiate with, it will display 
in the=20
correct language of the other player. That means if each player used a 
version=20
with a different language, they could play a game. Secondly, we are 
working on a=20
game editor which will give some flexibility in the game. We hope to be 
able to=20
set various victory conditions.</P>
<P><BR>&gt; Could your product be used in a tournament setting, and if 
so, how=20
much<BR>&gt; help would it be? (That is, would a tournament-arranger be 
included=20
or<BR>&gt; possible, that would &quot;score&quot; and &quot;seed&quot; 
rounds=20
using any of the accepted<BR>&gt; Diplomacy scoring 
systems?)<BR>&gt;</P>
<P>It is not designed for this. It is meant to be a stand alone product 
for=20
gamers.</P>
<P><BR>&gt; Are you sure you don't want to hire me, if not as a coder, 
then as=20
the<BR>&gt; guy who thinks up all this great new stuff for you to=20
do?<BR>&gt;</P>
<P>Then Dave Locke would have nothing to do ;).</P>
<P><BR>&gt; Well, that's all I can think of for the first batch of 
questions. I=20

Hmmm.  Well, I definitely want to do the flyers, but it sounds like you're
saying the hobby (which has $0 to its collective name) would have to print
a gazillion flyers and ship them to someone?

If so, this doesn't seem doable.  Pointing new players to The Pouch is a
Good Thing, but it won't bring anyone (well, me) any of the money necessary
to advertise for them to come.

I guess I was just thinking that even a little blurb stuck at the tail of
the rules booklet in a box or something, like:

        Join the International Community of Diplomacy Hobbyists!
   Visit The Diplomatic Pouch -- the home of Diplomacy on the Internet
                      http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch
            Face-to-Face Play Including Tournament Coverage
                     Play By Mail, Play By E-Mail
        Strategy and Tactics Information and an Online Magazine

would be nice.

As you say, this would need to be approved by Hasbro, but I guess I would hope
that the printing costs would be picked up by them.  If you could perhaps
tell me who at Hasbro would need to be contacted to okay text like this
and to perhaps make some call on how it could be included in the packaging,
I would appreciate it.  (Or would this be a Steve Arthur if we're just talking
about mooching an inch or so on a page already in your printing plans?)

Thanks for all your help!

Manus
