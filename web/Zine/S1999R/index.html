SRC="../../Zine/Common/About.gif"></A>
<i>Your Publisher:</i>
<A HREF="Hand/About.html">About The Diplomatic Pouch</A></b><dd>
The standard fare, here.  A couple of Pouch-related news items, and then it's
on to the rest of the issue.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Martin/how2win.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Chris Martin:</i>
<A HREF="Martin/how2win.html">How To Win Tournament Diplomacy (Revisited)</a></b><dd>
After returning from Namur dethroned,
Chris looks back at the tips he offered after winning the
1998 World Championship and decides if he was on-target
or just rambling incoherently.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Miller/rannestad.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Tim Miller:</i>
<A HREF="Miller/rannestad.html">The Rannestad Convention</a></b><dd>
What is the Rannestad Convention?  What's it all about?  What's it used for?
Is it something in which you would be interested?  Why are you asking
me?  Why don't we let Tim answer those questions for us?
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Hertzman/eye.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>David Hertzman:</i>
<A HREF="Hertzman/eye.html">The Unrelenting Eye</a></b><dd>
David begins a three-part article series to cover the basics of game theory as
they relate to Diplomacy.  In this article, he describes the prisoner's
dilemma: "to stab or not to stab, that is the question."
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Szykman/Experiment.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/History.gif"></A>
<i>Simon Szykman:</i>
<A HREF="Szykman/Experiment.html">Results of the Risk-Taking Experiment</a></b><dd>
Whether you took part in Simon's "risk-taking" survey or not, I bet you'll
be surprised by the results.  For one thing, he wasn't studying what he told
you he was!
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Rudd/devo.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Jack Rudd:</i>
<A HREF="Rudd/devo.html">Devolution Diplomacy</a></b><dd>
Jack often found himself in a situation where an eight-player game was needed,
so he created the Devolution variant.  In this variant, the clamors for
independence that are presently being made by various parts of the British
Isles have been granted,
so that, like all good Diplomacy powers, they can go to war against each other.

<A HREF="Hasbro/package.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Hand and Szykman:</i>
<A HREF="Hasbro/package.html">All About Hasbro Interactive's Diplomacy</a></b><dd>
What we've all been waiting for is coming soon, and The Pouch has the scoop.
Interviews with Hasbro and with the development team, and yes, screenshots too!
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Windsor/caissa.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Paul Windsor:</i>
<A HREF="Windsor/caissa.html">Caissa Annotates a No-Press Game</a></b><dd>
Paul's famed Caissa dissects a no-press game like only (s)he could.  In
this first article in a series, Paul takes us through the opening years
of a no-press game, Caissa-style.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Stephenson/vicdip.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Rob Stephenson:</i>
<A HREF="Stephenson/vicdip.html">The Mysterious and Secretive Victorian Diplomacy Championships</a></b><dd>
For all of us who couldn't be there, and even for those who could, Rob (in his
inimitable style) offers
a sampling of the 1999 Victorian Diplomacy Tournament, complete with some
tips on tournament play.

<i>The Editor and the Readership:</i>
<A HREF="Hand/Deposits.html">Pouch Deposits</a></b><dd>
Hey, guess what!  The Pouch got some mail and we're going to let you read it.
What a pleasant surprise, huh?  What's that?  Not a surprise?  Oh well, at
least it's pleasant.
<p><dt><b>
<A HREF="Wolf/centrifuge.html">
<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Clinton Wolf:</i>
<A HREF="Wolf/centrifuge.html">Centrifugal Force</a></b><dd>
Have you pulled Germany and now you're wondering what to do next?  Here's a
suggestion that you try the centrifugal approach.
<p><dt><b>

<IMG border=0 width=45 height=45 hspace=5 SRC="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif"></A>
<i>Roger Yonkoski:</i>
<A HREF="Yonkoski/alliance.html">The Grand Alliance</a></b><dd>
Stop the leader.  Restore a balance of power.  Admirable concepts, but often
it's a case of "easier said than done."  Roger offers some assistance.
