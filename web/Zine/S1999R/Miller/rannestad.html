    By now if you have played a few games of Diplomacy over the Internet
judges, you have most likely seen the havoc and annoyances that abandonments
can bring to the game.  Open positions, particularly in non-English
language games and variants, can sometimes take weeks to fill.  And
replacement players, who do the hobby a great service by taking over
abandoned positions, force players to start negotiations back at square
one.  Abandonments and replacements can often drastically change the
course of a game.  Many players who stick to their positions, regardless
of whether they are winning or losing, wonder why the same seven people
who start a game cannot be the same seven who finish it.  Indeed, I
have seen a game where only one of the seven original
players was left at the end.
<P>
      If you are one of these dedicated people, fear not, for there are
others like you who care about having a positive experience playing
Diplomacy, unburdened from the headaches caused by abandonment.  There
is The Vermont Group, an exclusive club of player's who have a low
abandonment rate on Doug Massey's Diplomacy Resignation Record.  Vermont
Group games run  virtually abandonment free.
<P>
      But what about the new player or somebody who has a bad record but
has reformed their abandoning ways?  The Vermont Group (of which I am a
proud member and which I have no desire to criticize or bash) is closed to these
people.  So where can a relatively new or recently reformed player
find a game that emphasizes responsibility and good sportsmanship?  The
answer is for that player to look for a Rannestad Convention game.  In
fact, emphasizing courtesy and sportsmanship is what the Rannestad
Convention (or the RC, as we refer to it) is all about.
<P>
      So by now, perhaps you are curious about what exactly the RC is
and how exactly it works.  The Rannestad Convention simply states that
players must not abandon positions without a valid real-life reason.  In
addition, when such a resignation must occur, the player involved must
tell the game's Masster as far in advance as possible so that a replacement
may be found.  Any player who does not comply with this and abandons
with nary a word to the GM before or after the fact may be
"blacklisted," that is, barred from playing in future RC games.
<P>
     These rules are not that hard to comply with.  We GM's who run games
under the RC do not view ourselves as being strict or
overbearing.  We simply want to give players a decent experience playing
Diplomacy, which to us means a minimum of abandonments and replacements.
Nonetheless, we realize that Diplomacy is just a game and that no player
is perfect.  One poster on <a href=news:rec.games.diplomacy>rec.games.diplomacy</a> went so far as to suggest
that we "blacklist people for missing deadlines." There is a wide amount
of disagreement about what to do about unreliable players. The RC does
not blacklist people for being late a few times, but for going abandoned
without notification.  RC
players and GM's are all human, and we realize that humans occasionally
get overworked and miss deadlines.  We even realize that sometimes
people need to resign from games; we just ask that they do so
responsibly and with as little disruption to the game as possible.
<P>
     As I have alluded, the RC is made up primarily of a group of GM's
who run at least some of their games under the RC rules.  The individual
GM of an RC game decides whether or not a player has violated the RC
rules and is blacklisted.  However, there are very strict criteria a GM
must follow in determining whether someone should be blacklisted.  A GM
can only blacklist people who have abandoned the game without giving a
reasonably good reason. There is no central governing board, only
someone who maintains the blacklist.  The RC has its own mailing list
(RC Chat), to which all the RC GM's subscribe.  We discuss the RC in
particular and GM'ing in general on the list, and the blacklist is
published on that list.
Anyone interested can subscribe to RC Chat by
sending a message to <a href=mailto:majordomo@uib.no>majordomo@uib.no</a> with the words “subscribe rcchat”
(without the quote marks) in the main body of the message.  Messages
themselves are mailed to <a href=mailto:rcchat@uib.no>rcchat@uib.no</a>.
   <P>
   So, if you are looking for a judge game that encourages common sense,
courtesy, and
sportsmanship, check out a Rannestad Convention game.  We'll be happy to
have you; provided, of course, that you don't abandon without a good
reason.
