Nice article. Reading it, I found to a horror you were describing my style
of play (deviate) which is news to me as I'm only playing my first four
games and I don't know my style. I just thought everyone played like me.
I'll have to watch out in future that I don't stick to this style allways.

Thanks for what I consider one of the best Pouch articles ever. Whether
it is as useful as fun to read, only future games will show. I have
played only for a couple of months so far, but it surely gives me
another approach to read other players.
<P>
While I don't think that I'm good at analyzing personalities, this is
probably due partly to the lack of opportunity (with respect to Dip).
Your conclusions are quite obvious when I read them, but I guess that
almost every inexperienced player tends to view his general playing
style to be the only thinkable. Now I know better.
<P>
However, I doubt that, even after taking your article to heart, the
fellow player's minds are an open book prior to 1901 for most of us. At
least you gave some indications on what to look for, in order to hone
our skills.
<P>
Another thing strikes me: don't you think that your categories correlate
strongly with the Enneagram personality types (somebody brought them up
recently on r.g.d.)?
<P>
My basic types are Peacemaker, Thinker, and Loyalist (9, 5 and 6), and
guess what, I recognized myself as playing according to the "Classicist"
pattern.
<P>
I would find it very helpful if this information is included in the
judge registry data :)
<P>
Thanks again for sharing your thoughts with us.

I must say that after reading your article 'What's Your Point' in
the Spring 1999 Movement issue of DipPouch, I was rather impressed at how
well you accuratley described players into such neat catagories. I find
that most of the information you wrote was close to my experiences of a
Diplomacy player.
<P>
When reading this article, I was really aided by your sections on
the deviate and romantic player styles. Classifying myself as a hard core
Classicist, your article brought some light on to why other powers in such
a successful alliance with your power choose to stab, sometimes too early
to guarantee a solo.
<P>
To be honest with you, to me winning a game is drawing, and I had
mostly forgotten that the goal of the game is to grab 18 centers and not
win in with an ally or two. I re-evaluated all the games I am currently, or
currently had played and found that I the times I had thought to myself
'Oh, I won that game!' were really games which I came to a draw with an
ally. Its rather amusing that I consider a draw a win, and an 18-sc victory
more or less a luck shot that only occurs when everyone else in the game
doesn't know what they are doing the whole time!
<P>
Now that I have some light on the psychology of Romantic and
Deviate players, I can better understand where they are coming from and
possibly spot them early on and expect a stab when the alliance we have is
successful. For this I am grateful to you.
<P>
Thanks for your input in the DipPouch, it was a rather interesting and
useful bundle of knowledge you have shared. Keep the good writing up.

First of all, let me say well-done on a fine deep-thinking article !
<P>
It was fun to read, and has some original views. As I was reading it, I
was trying to relate myself to it (as most readers do, I presume) and
position myself in one of the styles you've mentioned. I couldn't quite
do it, although some of the characteristics mentioned are in me.
<P>
The reason for that is, in my opinion, that your article only describes
intermediate players. I have rarely seen expert players who fit your
description or a part of it. I can only be sure about myself of course,
so let me elaborate.
<P>
You stated that there a four types of players, and therefore four types of
play. I say <i>au contraire!</i>  There are four types of play (assuming for the
moment there are only four), and a player, who's experienced enough and
wise enough, will choose which style to play according to the situation
he encounters. What about me?  I play to win (or else why play at all?),
if it wasn't a fun game I wouldn't play it (part of the fun is also
losing on occasion or else winning isn't that appreciated), I'll stab
whenever I feel it is necessary or when it will add to my winning percentage (and
enjoy it, too), and a game-long alliance is very acceptable and
appreciated if it helps me to win. If I can make friends through the
game, the better.
<P>
As you said wisely, no one's style is made up entirely of any one of the four
you listed. But
I think you were inaccurate at times. I have never seen a good player
who decided that once he can't win (the Romantic) he will throw the game
to someone else and die quickly. That is unacceptable to people who want
to win, and only inexperienced players don't believe they can win <b>every</b>
position. In the game of Diplomacy, every position is winnable, though
it make some time.
<P>
Like I said earlier, one may choose to use that style of play to help
his cause. For example, Suppose Turkey and Russia had an alliance,
against France and England. They were doing fine, and suddenly Turkey stabbed and is
trying to get the solo. The ideal for France and England is that Russia is eliminated
and they get a three-way. Turkey wants a solo, and Russia wants to survive.
What will Russia do?  Had I been Russia, I would pretend to throw the
game away to Turkey, unless France and England come to my help at once. If that means
I'll need to leave <i>all</i> my SC's open for Turkey, so be it. But I never
really want to throw the game -- only convince the others I'm willing to.
In the likely event that the players are in favor of a draw, I will be
able to survive, and hold the last SC needed for the Turkish win, thus
being an important and unignored part of the stalemate line -- getting
the draw I wanted.
<P>
It is true, though, that your article still describes many people in the
game. I believe that this is because there are more inexperienced players
than experienced players. If I may be optimistic and immodest, then if
you put me in a game with six players who fit your descriptions (all sorts
of combinations of the four types), I am certain I will do well. Maybe that
is part of the thing, too. If I may alter your Romantic type, I might
say I am the ultimate Romantic: I play to win, but as an experienced
player I know I can always win. All you need is a sharp tongue and a
skilled strategic mind. I believe that all expert players will say the
same. I don't expect someone to believe a one SC power can win the game
until they actually saw it with their own eyes. And that requires a
fair amount of experience.
<P>
If there is something I can't agree with you more, it's the last
paragraph. Psychology is a big part in this game. There is much to be
learned through it. I suppose a doctor of psychology will always do well in
this game... However, I believe that when you are in a game involving
expert/experienced players, you should choose your approach more
carefully, because it might feed you with disinformation (an important
part of this game). If I were playing in an all-experts players game, I
wouldn't use the insights in your article, but regardless, it gave me some
interesting ideas for future games...
<P>
Thanks again for writing this interesting article,
<P>
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
I very much appreciate your feedback. You might be surprised to hear me
reply that I agree with your criticisms in large part. I did admit though
that my descriptions of styles were more caricature than character. The idea
being, as I said, to stimulate people to think about these kinds of issues.
I consider the effort successful if you took the time to think about my
effort--even if you've come to different conclusions.
<P>
Our most important point of agreement is that the better one gets, the less
one is capable of being described by my article. We share the view that the
best players are those that recognize that the game is sufficiently complex
to transcend what might be initially narrow motivations for playing the game
and recognize the broader universe of players, motivations and styles. I
would agree that this information is probably least valuable to experts
playing a game with experts. But since 90% of us do not reside in the top
10% of players, I suspect that for most of us in most games, the article can
be a help.
<P>
I will take issue with your statement that my characterization of the
Romantic "flame out" as inaccurate. If it's never happened to you, I'd say
that you've been very fortunate. I was the beneficiary of such a maneuver in
my very first Judge game, contributing to a 1907 victory for me. I've also
been the victim of such a maneuver. I suppose there is always room for
argument that it could have been a failed in-game bluff or tactic (as you
suggest), but I calls 'em as I sees 'em. You and I may share an opinion that
this type of play is inappropriate (and that would be a Classicist sentiment
<img src=../../Common/smiley.gif>), but I've no doubt in my mind that it occurs with regularity--even at
higher levels of play.</i></blockquote>

I'm a big fan of the Diplomatic Pouch, and I think you've been
doing a great job with it.  However, I have a suggestion.  Perhaps you
should start including onto your Face to Face section some articles
specifically geared towards Face to Face playing.  Maybe one about how
to read your opponents faces or actions, or about positioning your
pieces or whatever.  Just a thought...
<P>
<blockquote><i><b>Publisher's response:</b>
Anyone care to guess how I responded to this one?  (And if he doesn't
write it, can I get a volunteer from someone out there, please?)  Tim
Richardson, who handles the Face To Face section, could make good use
of a link from his section to an article like this in the Zine!
