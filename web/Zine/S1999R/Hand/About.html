<H3>One Score and Zero Issues Ago</H3>
Well, here we are for the twentieth time.  Another Pouch issue.  Another
couple weeks late getting to you.  Another nice crop of articles.
<P>
Again, I never got back to the bunch of volunteer editors (thus explaining
the issue's tardiness), so Simon and
I put this issue together.  Again, I promise to get back to them
soon.  (If anyone can tell me what I mean by that, I'll ally with you
for a season or something.  Or at least for a retreat phase.)
<P>
Oh, and -- since I've been asked -- don't worry; even though he is sitting
another issue out, the
Great Detective has neither retired nor fallen from a cliff.
Sherlock Holmes is busy solving
another Diplomatic mystery, and I'm sure Dr. Watson will catch us all up
next issue....
<H3>Can I Quote You On That?</H3>
Since the last issue, the collection of witty, pithy, and even sometimes
intelligent quotes about diplomacy -- from which one is shown
randomly each time you load the <a href=/DipPouch>front page</a> of The
Pouch -- has grown to 380.  A quote for every day of the year and then
some! (Which is good, since I'm sure you visit The Pouch more than
once a day, right?  I mean, doesn't everyone?)
<H3>The Discovery Pouch??</H3>
Simon reports that television has taken note of The Pouch!  Well, at
least a television-related Website.  On one of his forays to see who
all out in Webland has links to The Pouch, he found someone in TVland.
The Discovery Channel has an online "school" with lessons on various topics
in conjunction with their Assignment Discovery TV program.  One of the
lesson topics is Sun Tzu's Art of War.  If you head for
<a href=http://school.discovery.com/spring99/programs/artofwar/index.html>the
Webpage for that lesson</a>, then click on "Links,"
you get a list of online resources intended to supplement the lesson.  One of
them is the article Simon wrote for the Zine:
<a href=/Zine/F1995M/Szykman/Art.html>The Art of Diplomacy in The Art of
War</a>!
<P>
Pretty cool!  (Though you have to wonder if they actually read the article
since it's about the game of Diplomacy and not the concept of diplomacy.)
But anyway....
<H3>Almost as Many Queue Games As Years In The Millennium!</H3>
The <a href=/DP-cgi/setqueue>Diplomatic Pouch Game Queues</a> are just a few
games short of starting their thousandth game!  Will you be the lucky GM to
start game
number 1000?  Will you be one of the lucky seven players who gets to play it?
The whole
Internet Diplomacy hobby is on the edge of their seat as the milestone nears!
It's like a lottery atmosphere!  (Well, not quite, I suppose -- actually, I
haven't heard word one about it -- but it is kind of neat, huh?)
<H3>Speaking of the Game Queues...</H3>
One of the recent developments at The Pouch saw the addition of a new
queue.  In case you missed the announcement, you can now get into a queue
if you're willing to be a replacement player, and if you're a GM of a
game in need of that kind of assistance, you can grab willing players
(bless their hearts!) from the top of the queue just by asking.  Help
out your fellow judge PBEM players by using the Replacement player queue.
<H3>What's In Store?</H3>
In case you don't know because you didn't skim the table of contents, I'll
tell you that you've got a
very good issue in front of you, if I do say so myself (and it looks like
I do, doesn't it?)
Among the other treasures in the issue -- and it's chock full of them -- is
a spread on Hasbro Interactive's forthcoming release of Diplomacy!
<P>
So, with no further ado, I'll get out of your way and let you get to the good
stuff.
<H3>As Always, Enjoy The Pouch!</H3>
