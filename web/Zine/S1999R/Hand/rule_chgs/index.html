As far as I know there are:
* "1961 Rule Book" first commercial Diplomacy Version by Games Research
* "1971 Rule Book" revised version by Edi Birsan, Rod Walker, Allan Calhamer
  1976 Avalon Hill bought Diplomacy from Games Research, so they pressed
  their own "new rule version" with is nearly equivalent to 1971 Rule Book:
* "1976 Rule Book, first Edition" Avalon Hills first Dip-Rule Book
* "1983 Rule Book" or "Second Edition/Feb. 1982"
  indeed Feb.1982 is a printing error, because this new edition was
  finished in November 1982, but it was printed in February 1983
  It has 3 main changes concerning convoys (resolve of Pandins Paradox)
* "1992 Rule Book, 3rd Edition" by Avalon Hill
  new print for Deluxe Diplomacy Set, minor changes in words an section
  numbers, but rules exactly the same as "1983 Rule Book"
taken from an overview from Johannes Schwagereit Nov.1993
maybe the last poster has one of those old "1961 Rule Books"
this should have some value for a "Diplomacy fan".
