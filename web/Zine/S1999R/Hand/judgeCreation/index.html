The whole thing is pretty much documented in contemporary documents.  The
challenge is finding them.
The best place to start, is to ftp into ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu and start
looking through the material in Zines and Documents
in Zines, you will find the last few issues of Electronic Protocol Chapter
Two.  In it's own sort of way, Electronic Protocol Chapter Two
documents the rise of the first (Washington) judge.  I believe that
I might have the only archive of the earlier issues readily at hand.
(I think the ones at usgs start around issue 290 or so.
Also, I have as much of the other chapter's of Electronic Protocol I 
was able to get out of Eric Klien around 1992.
Many of the early games at USWA (1991 and on) are documented in the Hall of
Fame.  The earlier ones back to about 1988 I have the history logs for on 
disk somewhere.
(history logs being a lose term, as this all predates the history, and some
even the press command.)
Many of the characters from the early days are still floating around, 
and would probably answer questions.  Danny Loeb, Jamie Drier, Rick
Desper, etc.  Even Ken Lowe will answer the odd question.  I'm not
quite sure about Eric Klien though, I think he was last seen somewhere
in Utopia, chasing pipe-dreams.
