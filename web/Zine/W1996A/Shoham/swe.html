<H2 align=center>Sweden's End Of Game Statement from "fools"</H2>
<hr><p>

<b>Broadcast message from Observer in 'fools':</b>
<P>
Greetings, all. I was the original Sweden. I was going nowhere fast, when I
went abandoned thanks to spending too much time at work. (wry grin)
<P>
The most amusing thing about this game for me was the fact that in March of
'93, Rick Desper were talking about a no-press game I was in at the time:
<blockquote><i>
  On a different note, I thought about starting a no-press chaos on April 1,
  called Fools, and seeing how many people signed on.  My fear is that a lot
  of people would!
</i></blockquote>
I encouraged him, of course, but he declined on account of busy-ness. The
best part, though is that I know both Chris and Larry from real life -- and
that they came up with the idea of this game <b>independent</b> of my
conversation with Rick. It's a damn small world.
<P>
Good job, Dan. I didn't get a chance to do much long-term planning, but your
short-range plans sound a lot like what I remember thinking at first:
getting that second center is crucial, and being next to too many other
people is a nightmare.
