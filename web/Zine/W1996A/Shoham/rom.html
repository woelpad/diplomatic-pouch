<H2 align=center>Roman End Of Game Statements from "fools"</H2>

I played X-Rome for the first few years, until one time when I
had to leave town and didn't give quite lead enough time on my delay
request.  I've been watching the rest though..
<P>
Congrats to Dan on the win.  True, a lot of lucky things came together
(he beat me to W, which is my #1 choice for chaos too), but he also
an excellent game and made good use of what fortune gave him.  The
plans I had might have slowed him down, but someone would have hit
me from behind.. My approach was to secure Italy proper and Tunis,
then after a possible forray to TRI go after the Iberia/Mar region.
>From there, I planned to play each half of the null zone almost
seperately.. But I only got as far and working on Italy a bit
and fighting Tunis some before I was replaced.

  When I joined, I found myself with two centers and what seemed a war
with Tunis.  When he suicided against Portugal, Dan got Tunis, and I
managed to pick up Naples.  Since Portugal seemed intent on a northern
campaign, I was all to happy to let him continue - had I prosecuted
a war in his direction, I felt certain I would be attacked from the
East.  I let his army pass thru to Munich.  When he originally offered
to attack E-Bud, I thought it a good idea.  However, the rapid growth
or G-Con made me rethink that.
<P>
  I somehow thought that Portugal was NOT the biggest problem for me.
I had no war with him, and I thought that the northern powers would
certainly be avle to control him.  My fear was from Turkey.  Portugal
at least had to fight on two fronts - Turkey didn't.  I thought that
once he got going, G-Con would be unstoppable, and certainly a greater
menace.  So I thought of enlisting E-Bud help for the task of bottling
him up.  Imagine my thanks when Portugal attacks Munich, and not the
E-Bud I had been expecting, and hoping against.
<p>
  Several turns later, it dawned on me why Portugal didn't attack - he
didn't need to.  It would have been very difficult for him to go much
further thru the Med, but he was already across the Line.  I built
a fleet with Greece, and sent it West.  G-Con gave me Bulgaria - I
assumed for the purpose of building a third fleet to attack with.  At
this point, I wished for Proxy.  Setting Proxy to G-Con early on
might well have worked.  But I couldn't, so, well, I lost.
