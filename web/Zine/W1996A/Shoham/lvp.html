<H2 align=center>Liverpool's End Of Game Statement from "fools"</H2>
<hr><p>
<b>Broadcast message from N-Lvp in 'fools':</b>
<P>
My thanks to the Master and players for an enjoyable game!
<P>
I was quite happy to find that I received my top choice for
a power in 'fools'.  I <b>really</b> wanted to start out with an
army in Liverpool and conquer the British Isles, and from
there maybe all of Europe.
<P>
With 1900 builds, the first of my setbacks occurred when London
also built an army.  Little did I realize how difficult the
Londoner was going to make life for me.
<P>
In 1901, we both made a play for Yorkshire and bounced.  In the
fall, I thought I would try to make an ally out of London by
supporting him to Yorkshire.  It remained my intention to be the
first English power to pick up a second SC, however.  So, I knew
I would have to play it a bit cagey.
<P>
In 1902, I hoped that Yor would go to Edi and that I could
follow into Yor and see whether I could somehow play this into
picking up the London SC.  This was a pretty weak move on my
part and I think that it would have been far better had I taken
the Londoner up on his/her offer of Edi.  At least I would have
had an opportunity to guess whether London would come to Lvp or
Edi in the Fall.  I suspect that it was this move in the Spring
of 1902 (Lvp-Yor) which ensured that I would never have a
London ally.
<P>
Then, in Fall 1902, London outguessed me again.  I took Edi,
but at the loss of Lvp.  If I had only bounced in Lvp, London
would have been out of the game and I would have had the
position I was interested in -- my army and two fleets in
England.  Aaaarghh.
<P>
I don't know what London was trying to do in S1903.  Probably
simply get me out of position.  But I attacked Lvp, signalling
my intent to wage war with London for control of the Isles.
And, sure enough, we went head to head in F1903.  I kept hoping
against hope that someone would make a serious move to England
so I could bring another unit to bear against London, but it
was not to be.
<P>
In S1904, London apparently was willing to play the guessing
game with me again and moved out of Lvp, so I slipped in.  Now
all I had to do was hold that SC.  Of course, I misguessed again
and tried to bounce the non-existent London attack on Edi.  As
London slipped back into Lon, his build guarenteed my demise.
<P>
In 1905, London completed my elimination.  Kudos to London!
<P>
I wish I had an opportunity to play longer, but it was fun
while it lasted!  Congratulations to the eventual winner(s)!
