<H2 align=center>Budapest's End Of Game Statement from "fools"</H2>

<b>Broadcast message from E-Bud in 'fools':</b>
<P>
Congratulations Dan!
<P>
I don't have much to comment on about the game. I picked up Norway as
a replacement, and rapidly discovered that Portugal was the big
threat, and there was nothing I could do about it. I tried a few
things, eventually moving to StP before disappearing.
<P>
Then I watched the game for a while, and noticed that somebody else
had changed powers in the game, so decided to look out for an
abandonment, didn't think it could hurt, would get the game going more
quickly if I picked one up. Anyway, as it happens, E-Bud came up, and
I got to it first. It was clear that it would be touch-and-go whether
we could stop W-Por. G-Con and I disentangled ouyrselves and
headed for Germany, but it was too late, C-Ber was overrun and that
made 18.
<P>
Owen Lyne - stunned by the <b>big</b> names he just played with!
