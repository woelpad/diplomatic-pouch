<H2 align=center>Tunis's End Of Game Statement from "fools"</H2>
<hr><p>

<b>Broadcast message from 6-Tun in 'fools':</b>
<P>
     As 6-Tunis, I attempted to carve out a place for myself in Italy and
kept hoping that W-Portugal would go North.  Even though it took a few
turns, I felt like I was succeeding nicely, but there was not enough
pressure in the north to keep W-Portugal from coming over and pouncing on
me before I could consolidate my power.
<P>
     Once I realized that I was done-for, I made certain that *SOMEBODY*
was strong in Italy by pulling out and going suicidal against W-Portugal.
It even through W-Portugal temporarily out of position.  I'm glad to see
that X-Rome managed to pull through to the end.  X-Rome fought hard and
deserved to have Italy (at least if I couldn't have it.  :-)  )
<P>
     Now that I look at the board, I see that W-Portugal is indeed the best
starting position.  As long as Spain moves out, you gain a center in the
first year.  Even at that point you have some defense because both centers
are together.  I thought that Tunis was the best because of it's isolation,
but that isolation was only a temporary measure.
<P>
     This was a fun game.  I just wish that I had more time to play
Diplomacy...
<P>
     I don't remember the exact history of who's "idea" this was.  I do
remember talking with Josh about it a year before it actually happened (the
April Fools day joke of 1993).  I seem to remember that he and I joked about
it:  The ultimate chaos game.  When April Fools day of 1994 came around,
I asked Larry to start it so that I could play in it.  (I came out of hiding
for this event, I'm afraid that I'll have to go back into hiding now that
it's over...)
<P>
     While on the one hand I do believe that it is/was the ultimate
on the silliness scale, it's also the case that it is a very interesting
strategic puzzle.
<P>
     I will say that I did think that W-Por was the most obvious threat on the
board from about 1901.  I was really surprised when there was not much of an
organized defense against the hoards.  Of course, I needed 2-3 secure centers
before I could do anything to stop him.  Self-interest and a hope to be allowed
to continue to do one's own thing won out over trying to slow down a possible
threat.
