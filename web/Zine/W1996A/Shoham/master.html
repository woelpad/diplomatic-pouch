<H2 align=center>GameMaster's End Of Game Statement from "fools"</H2>

Wow!  A 34K EOG file.  Pretty impressive, Dan!
<P>
I thought I'd throw my 2 cents in for the reason FOOLS existed at all.
<P>
I was merrily minding my own business one day, when suddenly I get a message
from Chris Yoder, that insidious Hobbit!, asking if I would be interested in
starting a Foolish game (those that know Chris, know that this is not a
question that is asked lightly, or, dare I say it, foolishly!).  He and
several other players, while in Avalon, if I remember correctly, thought a
nopress Chaos game would be ... er ... fun.
<P>
So, naive and FOOLish me, agreed.  We started the game on April Fools Day,
so naturally it had to be called FOOLS.  It really wasn't a prank, despite
what Dan said.  I fully expected the game to get filled up and be played out
as normal.
<P>
It turned out to be both frustrating and enjoyable for me. I don't think
I'll Moderate another Chaos game, and I'm weary of nopress games.  Back to
good ol' Press, Standard for a while, I think.
<P>
Thanks to all for playing, and congrats to Dan for winning!
<P>
