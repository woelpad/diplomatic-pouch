<P>
<H4>PREPARING FOR FOOLS</H4>
For a very long time I have considered a NoPress Chaos game to be
the ultimate Diplomacy challenge. I fully understand that it
is entirely possible - even likely - for one to be eliminated for
no fault of one's own. But I just view that as a hazzard of Chaos.
I consider Chaos to be a great challenge because the large number
of players allows one to think in statistical terms. Alliances are
no more an issue of two (or sometimes three) players reaching a
comfort level with each other - and very much dependent on the
peculiarities of the personalities of the allies. In a Chaos game,
(early) alliances require the cooperation of many players, and
thus - statistically - one cannot depend on individual personalities.
NoPress games have their own attraction. By removing the negotiations
part of the game, and restricting it to orders only, the game become
much more mathematical. Much more discrete. There is a finite
number of strategies one may employ. The player's task is now well
defined: choose amongst those strategies the one to employ.
<P>
My preparation involved several aspects. First, I tried to get into
as many Chaos games as I could - even as a replacement player. There
aren't a great many chaos games, so this wasn't a difficult undertaking.
Once in those Chaos games, try to study every aspect of the game with
an eye as to how it might change in a NoPress game. Second, I moderated
3 games of the NoPress Pure variant - which I considered to be the
"baby" version of NoPress Chaos. Again, the objective was to learn lessons.
Third, join some NoPress games so as to learn the mechanics.
<P>
From the Chaos games I joined, I learned that contrary to my expectations,
the game is played much more individualistically than the mega-alliances
I envisioned. Sure, player would cooperate in large alliances, but they
never lose sight of their selfish "provincial" objectives.
<P>
From the NoPress Pure games I moderated I learned that the players who
are most communicative won. (By communication I mean supports and convoys
provided to other powers more as a way of sending a message than as
an actual useful order. Orders which are certain to be VOID are very often
utilized for "communication" purposes). I also learned that demoralization
can be a very potent weapon. A power can be demoralized out of fighting
and give up all-too-easily. Not everyone demoralizes, but it can be a
great boon to an aggressor if some of his victims do. Trying to gear one's
play to maximally instigate demoralizations, and take advantage of them
when they happen, is a promising strategy.
<P>
From the (other) NoPress games I learned that communication is perhaps
over-rated. Players ignore direct attempt at communication as often
as they take it into consideration; and very often, they can get the
message even without any explicit communication. The cost of immobolizing
a unit for communications sake is just too high. Ever more so, I learned
that a very successful deception can be founded on deliberately-misleading
communications. Ironic as it may sound, those who take communications much
to heart, appear to be the easy prey. Another lesson I've learned from
NoPress games is that there is a strong gang-on-the-one-who's-down
mentality. Everyone wants to get their cut. No one wants to play the good
Samaritan. The poor fella who is down can't even bargain for his life.
Although, I did wonder how would that be played out in a NoPress game,
where (early on) "ganging up" on someone is simply taking his lone center.
Yet another lesson I learned from NoPress play is that the "dash-for-victory",
starts much earlier. The "dash-for-victory", is that time when a player
has 14+ SCs (or so) and decides to violate every treaty and understanding
ever reached in the hope of reaching 18 centers before the rest of the
players (who always have more centers between themselves than the dasher)
get their act together and manage to form an effective opposition. It
takes so much longer to form an effective defensive barrier when press
isn't allowed. Each defender must individually reach the decision
that the time for selfless cooperation has arrived (to "stop the leader").
Then the moves which need coordination, often require guesses as to
whom should move, who should support?, and support what? It often takes
several turns to get the coordination in sync. All these extra delays
allow the "dash" to begin so much earlier.
<P>
It was my intention to moderate a NoPress Chaos game myself before trying
to play in one - as a further learning experience. However, I was
pre-empted. Larry started a NoPress Chaos game before I had a chance to
execute the final learning stage. Considering that Chaos games in
general don't start every day (since 34 players must assemble to get
a game going; and often by the time they all assemble, some already have
to leave, and also; with 34 players, rarely is there a turn which isn't
executed late, etc.), and that NoPress chaos are even more rare, my hand
was very much forced. Insisting that I moderate such a game before I
play would have meant I had to wait for FOOLS to finish, then start my
own game, carry it through to conclusion, and then hope that yet a third
game would form to allow me to play. This could easily prove a 2-3 years
affair. So, I decided to join FOOLS.
<P>
Larry meant the game to be an April's Fools joke. Figuring that no
one could possibly play such a "wacky" variant seriously. I didn't
see it that way. I asked Larry to remove the NMR provision of the game
so as to <i>allow</i> it to be taken seriously by those who would like to.
Larry wasn't to sure about NMR himself, and agreed to remove it. I was in.
<P>
This is going to be a carefully played game, I kept repeating to myself.
No "shoots from the hip". Every action must be taken after careful
thoughts and due considerations. I should act as if I'm trying to
justify every act in front of a skeptical audiance.
<H4>SET PREFERENCE</H4>
The first action was to set preference.
To do this, I collected the statistical performance of various Chaos
powers - as parameterized by local neighborhoods - in games I played.
(The idea to do this came from Neil Dodgson, who has done such a
review for Chaos game EVERYONE.) Here is what I've collected:

<P>
The trend is obvious. It is best to have exactly one neighbor. This
makes sense. With one neighbor you can't be dislodged in S01, but you
might get support and take a center yourself. Even if you are the one
doing the supporting, you might gain an ally. Two is not quite as good.
Three or more is dangerous. The statistics for zero are too small to
be conclusive, other than that it is inferior to one.
<P>
All these statistics were collected for games with partial press.
How would things change for NoPress? Well, first, I figured, there would
be a dearth of fleets. The number of starting fleets in Zenith and Everyone
were 14 each (I have no number for Avalon since I wasn't around when it
started, and couldn't collect the information from the history files
of the Washington judge after it was deactivated). However, with partial
press, and alliances forming before the 1900 construction phase, I was
sure many of those fleets were part of division-of-labor agreements.
In a NoPress, every-man-for-himself (at least initially), game there
is a strong disincentive to build fleets. The number one objective for
every player must be the attaining of a second center. The only
time a fleet is better than an army is if one wants to go through a body
of water to that second center. This means that the Admiral would have
to spend the Spring season NOT on top of a supply center (since there
are no water supply centers!). This is highly undesirable if there is
any other way. This expected dearth of fleet would seem to advantage
"out-of-the-way" powers. Powers which are hard to reach via land.
<P>
Portugal seemed the power to put on top of the preference list.
It was both a one-neighbor power, and poorly accessible by land.
A few other powers with that characteristic rounded up my top-6
(I allowed the two zero-neighbored powers in, 6-TUN and P-LON, since
I valued inaccessibility more than one-neighborness. In a partial
press game, one-neighborness would presumably be more valuable
since support against the neighbor may be arranged more easily).
I figured it would be unlikely I'll need more than a handful of
preferences - after all how many Chaos players submit preferences
to begin with, and how come would have a preference so similar
to my own that I'd be pushed down more than a handful of places
on the list. Nevertheless, I wrote out the entire list. Thinking
exactly what would I do if I got each, and how comfortable am I
with it. The less comfortable, the lower on the list.
<P>
The final preference list was: <tt>WN6ITP1A9QBVD4UHC23K8GJS7XL0E5YRFZ</tt>.
<P>
I was fortunate enough to get W-POR.
<h4>1900</H4>
Next decision, what to build?
Army was out of the question. It will amount to an open declaration
of war on 2-SPA (where else can a W-POR army go?). If I'm to take Spain,
it will be by stealth. I built a fleet.
<P>
When the builds were published, I was rather surprised.
The number of fleets built, 13, was not (significantly)
less than in the partial press game. However, they were
built so differently. England - which usually get 3 fleets
in a Chaos game - got only 1. The Black Sea coastline got 3.
<P>
I was surprised, but happy. In my region of the board there were
very few fleets. 2-SPA, Q-MAR, D-BRE, P-LON, and N-LVP all built
armies. The nearest fleets were 6-TUN, T-NAP, and B-BEL. All of them
had much higher priority - even after they get their first growth.
I wouldn't have to worry about a naval invasion for a long time.
And, as long as I make sure I don't leave POR for anything but SPA,
there will never be an overland invasion.
<H4>1901</H4>
Next, my first turn. The principle advantage of being a
one-neighbor-power is that you might be supported into that
neighbor on the first turn - an alliance forming gesture from
the fella on the other side of the neighbor (in my case Q-MAR).
There is therefore a definite argument in favor of just walking
over to the neighbor (in my case 2-SPA). And, besides, even without
support, there is always an excellent chance the neighbor would
just walk out. There was a problem however, and a problem I failed
to appreciate originally. To get support from Q-MAR, he will have to
guess which coast I'm going to. I would like to go to the South
coast (there is nothing of interest beyond the North coast), but
Q-MAR might not like it. I asked the GM what would happen if Q-MAR just
submitted a support order without specifying a coast. Which would
the judge default to. His answer was that it would be picked at
random. I knew that much, but my question was if it's a true randomizer,
or is it seeded (in which case, a second game faced with the same
instruction would come up with the same "random" choice). The GM
didn't know. I asked the Judge Keeper and he didn't know, but agreed
to post the question to the judge maintainance mailing list. From
there it transpired that the randomizer is indeed seeded, but the
seed is made up from the game name, the phase, and a secret judge
code-number. In other words, it would reproduce if a turn is
reprocessed, but not from game to game. So much for that thought.
There was a further problem with moving to Spain right off the top.
If 2-SPA didn't move out in the Spring, and I tried to take it,
2-SPA will never ever leave. We will just bang heads together
until some regional superpower formed and took care of us both
(as I have later done to V-PAR and D-BRE).
I fully appreciate that one does not go about a Chaos game
by playing safe conservative moves; but I had the luxury of no
threats to my home, so I could best time my attack.
<P>
I've decided to play deceptive. I've ordered "POR convoy SPA-BRE".
This is an illegal order, but one which the judge permits (although
it would always be <tt>*void*</tt>). It would presumably suggest to 2-SPA that
he move to GAS and I to MAO, whence I'll support him into BRE.
In the fall, I could then take SPA with greater safety.
<P>
A stunt like this tends to be more treacherous than I would
usually be willing to execute. It's one thing to simply attack
someone - unprovoked - and take them out, or to take advantage of
someone's troubles for my benefits, or even to attack someone
who offered me support (instead of accepting it). In all these
cases, <b>I</b> never "said" I'll ally with you. The <tt>*void*</tt> convoy I
gave is as close to "promising" an alliance as one can have in
a NoPress game. I was publicly asking a neighbor to take a risks
as part of an alliance, and was instantly abusing it. This will
mark me as a stabber, and very much shut off my ability to "talk"
opponents into taking risks with me.
However, the importance of getting a second unit <b>early</b> in a NoPress
game just can't be over-stated. It is like gaining sight where
everyone else is blind. The two units can support each other whereas
two allied units can only guess what each is doing - even if they
have complete confidence in each other's trustworthiness (which
never happens, especially in a NoPress game).
Any cost is justifiable for that second unit.
<P>
It worked. As it turned out, 2-SPA moved out of SPA already in the
Spring - so I <i>could</i> have taken it. But the important thing is that
he didn't return in the Fall - possibly thanks to the deception.
I took SPA in 1901. I had my early unit. I was well on my way.
<P>
Things looked even brighter when I surveyed the rest of the board.
Only 5 powers (including myself) gained a build. In this "few seeing
amongst the many blinds" world, these early builders are likely to
form the cores of growing empires, and the sources of my future opponents,
as the "blinds" are killed off. This prediction proved very accurate.
With one exception (E-BUD replaced Z-SER) these were exactly the 5 to
make it (to 4 or more centers). The die has been cast. There will be
very few additions to this select group of growers. I was in that
group, and the group was smaller than I could possibly have hoped for.
<P>
The news was brighter than that. Of the growers, my position was
the most secure - and hence easiest to move forward with. 3 of
the 5 growers were in the midst of many other powers. These
were C-BER, G-CON, and Z-SER (the sole casualty of the group).
One other, X-ROM, was in a reasonably safe position, but with
some headaches and no immediate prospects.
<P>
The news only got brighter when I focused on my immediate areas
of concern. The three French countries - my obvious next objective
- were all hostile to each other; and none of them had any good
prospects. The English powers haven't made any progress. I considered
that very important. The fact that there were two armies in England
was amongst my blessings. As soon as the intra-English battles have
been settled, the island is going to become a potent source of
unpleasant fleets. In the Spring, the English units executed the
"famed" Yorkshire Pudding move (all three units bounced in YOR.
Considered a joke move in standard Diplomacy, but apparently a
plausible move in NoPress Chaos). In the Fall, two of them started
cornering the third, but the one being cornered was the FLEET!
The nearest fleets have both moved away from me. B-BEL moved
to the NTH, and 6-TUN moved to the ION. There were no fleets
anywhere in sight.
<P>
The adjustment was also delightful. Three fleets were destroyed,
and only two built; and they were built further away from me than
where the destroyed fleet were.
<P>
I was doing great.
<H4>1902</H4>
I built an army. I would need two armies to take central France.
I had to build one, and the second would come from the taking MAR.
<P>
My next target was always going to be Q-MAR. With absolutely no threats,
and with no one available or interested in helping Q-MAR, I had all the
time in the world to execute a safe capture. It should take me 3 seasons
if Q-MAR resists. For reasons I fail to understand, he didn't resist
and I took him out in 1 year.
<P>
Other 1902 events were again cheerful, but not as much as the incredible 1901.
<P>
The number of "seeing" (powers with more than one unit) increased to 9.
Of them, I was the only one with 3 units, and the only one with no threats
whatsoever. Even X-ROM was being harassed (by 6-TUN) and in no position
to head my way. I had gained the lead, and I haven't looked back since.
<P>
The French situation was continuing to be cheerful. V-PAR and D-BRE
have, since the game begun, been attacking each other every turn.
A situation from which they couldn't escape. Whomever stops first
will lose.
<P>
England was getting ever more hilarious. The sole English fleet (I-EDI)
was destroyed, but the power which took it, N-LVP, lost his home to P-LON.
P-LON didn't get a build either. He lost his home to a fleet from B-BEL
(reminding one of pre-Roman English history...). But B-BEL didn't get
a build either. He lost his home to K-HOL. The bottom line is that, once
again, England had 2 armies and one fleet;  all controlled by three
different 1-SC powers. Wonderful. the longer the English threat is
delayed, the better prepared I will be to meet it.
<P>
The fleet count improved too, as another fleet was destroyed, and none
(other than mine) was built.
<H4>1903</H4>
The Q-MAR misdefense changed my schedule around. I could now move on
central France a lot quicker. The practical effect was that I changed
my intended build to a fleet for an immediate attack on BRE. My MAR
fleet would be free to provide perimeter defense, deterance, and if
available "fishing expeditions". I was the only one with such a luxury.
<P>
At that time, I considered myself as a likely winner. I've confided with
a local Diplomacy player that I already see myself winning FOOLS.
I was going to begin my dash-for-victory right away. I'm not going to
worry about getting too big and becoming a tempting target (the so called
"early leader syndrome"). I'm just going to "dash".
<P>
This is extraordinary. I've observed above that in a NoPress game,
one might want to start the "dash" from 11-13 SC instead of 14-15, but
I never imagined that I'll make the strategic decision to start the dash
from <b>three</b>!
<P>
The one thing I was going to allow to distract me was a decision to
try and avoid the other seeing powers while there are still blinds
to scoop up.
<P>
The French failed to unite in the face of my advancing forces, and
I took BRE in only one year. Again, ahead of schedule. My spare
MAR fleet was doing well in it's perimeter mission.
<P>
I was now at four units, and still no threats in the area. All the
other seeing powers had some problems on their hands.
<P>
There has been no change in the England situation. I could begin
to dream that England won't sort itself out at all before I could
get around to forcibly suppress the island.
<P>
The only cloud on the horizon was the fact that 6-TUN gained a
build. Obviously it's going to be a fleet. This will curtail
my ability to exercise fishing expeditions in the Med, and potentially
create a force that could approach my shores. I knew this had to be
dealt with, but I wasn't quite ready yet.
<P>
The number of seeing powers remained at 9, with two of them at 3
(and myself at 4). The fleet count remained unchanged.
<H4>1904</H4>
I built that second army that was designated to go after PAR.
<P>
I had no difficulties overcoming interference from the B-BEL fleet
in the English channel and use my 2 armies to take PAR.
<P>
Less expected, a "what the heck, I'll give it a try" play with my
Med fleet worked. I did to 6-TUN exactly what I did to 2-SPA in 1901.
I gave him a suggestive support in the Spring and took (one of his)
home in the Fall. I couldn't believe he would fall for it, with my
2-SPA record and all, but he did. This was great, not only did I take
a center, but I took it from a power I considered to be a mid-term
concern. What's more, I was anchoring a "neighborly" relation with
X-ROM - who has been nice enough to restrict his build to army -
by frying his headache. X-ROM was greatful enough and - for as long
as he could - has been "neighborly" with me too.
<P>
There was another, more long range, achievement in gaining TUN.
I considered it the 18th center for my future victory. I will now be
able to focus on taking the 17 centers West of the Barren Zone, and
already have TUN for the 18th. Being the largest power in the West,
and with a fully defended home, this was a feasible objective.
Of course, I <b>could</b> make some pushes into the Med - probing attacks,
perimeter defense, and fishing expeditions; but those won't be
an integral part of my strategic plan, and will have to be sustained
by their own growth. The only rule is that TUN and the perimeter
must be defended before any adventures may take place.
<P>
Getting two builds was great news. But there was plenty of good news
all around. The fleet count went down another notch, as two were
destroyed (the harassing B-BEL and one of 6-TUN's) and only one
built (other than by myself). The number of seeing powers was
still at 9, with myself in the lead with 6 and 3 powers (C-BER,
E-BUD, and G-CON) at 3.
<P>
The English situation was not only failing to develop, it was
retrograding. P-LON took his home back (from B-BEL), and choose
to build an ARMY. England now had *three* armies. It was clear
that P-LON intended to expel the N-LVP army in EDI to gain the
build that will give him the fleet he'll need to get off the
island. However, I was now in position, to begin and interfere
with that plan. I have been blessed, England would now never
be a factor.
<P>
All in all, 1904 was a great year; as good as 1901.
<H4>1905</H4>
1905 was the first year which wasn't stellar. It was also the
first year I didn't gain a build.
<P>
6-TUN choose to suicide on me. To make sure that his suicide
is indeed fatal to him, I had to make a move which X-ROM
is likely to interpret as an attack on him. He blocked the
attack, but "neighborliness" was seriously damaged. X-ROM
built a fleet in NAP - replacing the dying 6-TUN one on my
list of concerns.
<P>
More seriously, K-HOL - with 3 units, and C-BER - with 4;
were beginning to cooperate to block my progress. Between
them they had enough firepower to halt my land advance.
Of course, I had no backthreats, and they did - at least
a little - from (the still disorganized) Scandinavia.
<P>
The one bright spot was that my land defenses were now
as solid as my naval defenses.
<P>
The number  of seeing powers was still at 9. I was still
at 6, but my two nearest rivals, C-BER and G-CON, were
now at 4.
<P>
The fleet count stayed even with builds and two destroyed.
<P>
In England, P-LON knocked N-LVP out of I-EDI; as programmed.
He didn't, however, gain any build from it. K-HOL - my enemy -
did what I was unable to. He took LON, and made sure England
couldn't build a fleet. (Too bad he got one :).
<H4>1906</H4>
My good fortunes resumed in 1906. My war with K-HOL was
going very much my way. C-BER placed his focus on Scandinavia
and wasn't defending his K-HOL friend as much as the position
required. When K-HOL grabbed LON from P-LON, he ASSURED that
there will be a counterattack. There is absolutely nothing
on England to do for two (same-power) armies other than trying
to take the third center.  In the Spring I moved a fleet to
the NTH. K-HOL was so convinced that this was a flanking
move that he abandoned BEL and defended HOL (which wasn't
attacked). Actually, my NTH fleet was performing a duty I
have long been preparing. It took EDI just as P-LON took
his home from K-HOL. Making sure England *still* didn't
build any fleet.
<P>
K-HOL went down from 3 to 1 (becoming "blind"), I went from 6 to 8.
<P>
In other news, X-ROM seems to have forgiven me and was heading East
with his fleet. I was content to sit in TUN and not provoke X-ROM
for as long as he would allow me.
<P>
More good news. G-CON has gained control of the Black Sea perimeter
and was now in second place behind me with 6 centers. I considered
that good news since G-CON is going to provide a lethal distraction
for all the central powers, preventing them from coming to the aid
of the Western powers I was about to savage. I wasn't too concerned
with G-CON surpassing me. I had TUN, and I had the ability to defend
it (although, the defense, at the time was not there; neither was
the threat).
<P>
The manner in which I shall win was beginning to take shape.
I've already savaged K-HOL. One fleet will keep P-LON in
England unable to grow: whenever he gets two units to dislodge me
from one of his centers, another fleet will take some other center.
This will be done until I'm ready to systematically destroy P-LON
and take the island. (wow, it's happening. England is never a factor!)
Frontal fighting will have to be used to destroy C-BER, and a mop
up operation for Scandinavia. After I took out C-BER, no amount
of outside (i.e. from the East) help would save Scandinavia - since
units can come through StP only one at the time, and only armies.
<P>
The fleet count went down another notch in 1906 with the destruction
of the K-HOL fleet in LON. There were now only 8 fleets (beside mines),
4 in each sea; and none in a troubling place.
<P>
With some "blinding", the number of seeing powers went down to 7.
<P>
I built two armies to prepare for a frontal attack on C-BER in Germany.
<H4>1907</H4>
In 1907, I didn't gain any builds, but I positioned my forces
for a major attack on C-BER as planned. I took advantage of
X-ROM concerns about E-BUD to gain passage for my MAR unit to
PIE and toward TYL. I would use spare fleets to give void
convoys to tell X-ROM where am I going. The deception campaign
was designed to make it appear I'm bypassing my X-ROM friend
to start a harassment campaign on E-BUD. I was indeed bypassing
X-ROM, but the objective was to get to the C-BER German holdings
from around Switz, not to attack E-BUD.
<P>
Through a quirk, 4-SWE gained his first build and "sight". Great.
C-BER progress through Scandinavia might be slowed.
<P>
The fleet count remained unchanged.
<H4>1908</H4>
1908 was another of those great years. Accurate guessing and the
surprise from TYL allowed me to destroy the last K-HOL unit in
the spring and to take MUN+KIE from C-BER in the Fall.
C-BER, perhaps hoping to gain my favor, perhaps hoping to make
a stand in Scandinavia, disbanded all his German forces.
<P>
This was all I needed. Only extraordinary misfortune would
stop me from winning. Even if everyone united against me, I should
still be able to win. I was up to 11 units. I secured all of Germany.
I still had TUN. England was still being "held in reserve" immobile
with only armies and no way to gain a build. Scandinavia, mostly
under C-BER control, was all that needed to be taken. My Diplomacy
experience says that taking Scandinavia from the West is a straight
forward exercise.
<P>
I had now shifted to a mode of extreme conservatism. I shall assume
all players are now cooperating against me, and I shall assume they
are all making lucky guesses. The game is mine. I won't let rashness
and some bad luck take it away from me.
<P>
Fleet count stayed unchanged, but I built 3 fleets; I now had nearly
half of all fleets (7 out of 15).
<P>
The endgame has begun.
<H4>1909</H4>
Conservatism paid. Sending a second fleet to cover the vital TUN
(my "18th") proved accurate. X-ROM, realizing the threat I was
presenting, and the role TUN plays in that threat, sent two fleets
against it. E-BUD also has begun to brush with my German holdings.
C-BER has concluded his capture of Scandinavia.
<P>
I routinely took BER and LON, going to 13 centers.
<P>
4-SWE, continuing his quirk luck, managed to take refuge in LVP
as his Scandinavian home was demolished. I liked it. Even though it
was a fleet in my rear, it was on a short leash. It couldn't go
anywhere without losing his sole center. I choose not to pay the
required efforts to take it out, opting instead to use my forces
in conservatively defending the frontiers.
<P>
On the German front, I made some <i>safe</i> moves Eastward. The intention
was to slow down any potential advance toward my German holdings
until I have a full fledged stalemate line available.
<P>
G-CON was crushing right through the R-MOS lines to get to me.
It was obvious he was woefully too late. Well, what the heck,
I would use the R-MOS refugees for the delay functions.
<P>
I didn't <b>really</b> need all that, but it covered me against some
low-probabilities misfortunes.
<P>
Everything was going well.
<P>
I built two fleets gaining naval superiority over the the rest combined.
Those fleets would be used to seal off the Med completely, even before
any serious threat materialized.
<b>1910</b>
In 1910, E/X/G finally made a serious move to engage me. Too late.
My defenses were all up and prepared. Germany and the Med weren't
mathematically stalemated yet, but there was sufficient defenses
to hold against any threat until a formal stalemate would be constructed.
<P>
4-SWE made some lucky guesses to stay alive. I didn't really need to
take him out (early), but it would speed things up if I did.
<P>
The only place where things <b>could</b> go wrong was C-BER in Scandinavia.
Had he chosen to play aggressively, and then made some good guessed,
he might still give me troubles. C-BER didn't. He was content to sit
and calmly await his fate as I was tightening the noose about him.
In 1910, I took DEN from him.
<P>
C-BER disbanded a fleet, I built one.
<H4>1911</H4>
More of the same. I finally outguessed 4-SWE and took LVP. This freed
up all units I had in England.
<P>
I made a supported retreat into the formal stalemate line in Germany.
<P>
In the Med, I pushed forward - making sure I can always retreat to a
stalemate line - in case I can hunt a center in Italy. Nothing was
really expected to be gained from that offensive. Nothing was.
<P>
With the help of freed-up English units, I tightened the noose
around Scandinavia even further.
<P>
After the Fall executed, I reached the point of a forced victory.
I could assure no chance of losing any center or province as I
build up my forces against Scandinavia. Eventually, I'll guess
correctly and take some of the 3 centers I needed to win.
<H4>1912-1914</H4>
The forced win was executed. Nothing special.
<H4>GAME OVERALL</H4>
As a whole, I found the victory to have been much easier than
I anticipated. Fate smiled upon me repeatedly. Still, I was
following very much a game long strategy, with little deviation.
When I was at 3 centers, I've already decided to  "dash". When
I was at 6, I already had a detailed outline of how I'll win,
and which centers will I take. When I was at 11, I already had a
"high-probability" win. When I was at 15, I already had a Forced win.
<H4>COMMENT TO PLAYERS</H4>
E/X/G: You were much too slow to confront the threat I presented.
<P>
C-BER: I placed you in a very desperate position. Yet, this is no excuse
for your lack of action. I was rather surprised to find that C-BER
was played by a player I respect (Martin). For some time, you were
the only one who could have stopped me, and you never even tried.
You were often acting as "I'll be friendly. Please find your victory
margin elsewhere". Well, sorry, C, you were SITTING on *MY* victory margin!
<P>
P-LON: I sure hope you thought carefully before building that second ARMY.
Did you realize you were dooming yourself to never leave the island?
<P>
B/D: you two proved unable to break your skirmishes in face of my forces.
<P>
All in all, all players played a good game.
<H4>ACKNOWLEGEMENTS</H4>
Finally, I would like to thank the players of this game, Larry
Richardson - the GM, David Kovar, the Judge Keeper, the EFF for
providing the judge's hardware; and those on the judge-maint team
who all helped make this game what it was. Thanks all.
