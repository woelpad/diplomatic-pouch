My Favorite Stab

<P>
I don't know whether PBEM stories are generally bland, but I do
know that they are not always bland. [<A href="story1.html">Scott's first story</a>]
reminds me of the stab which I consider my most pleasing:
<P>
I first came to Diplomacy through Ecunet (a religious network,
I am a Presbyterian minister) and several minister friends. In
that community, there is a small group of us that play hand-adjudicated
games. My first game, I was asked to replace the Austrian diplomat,
who had resigned after some preliminary negotiations, but before
first moves.
<P>
Quickly surveying the situation, I knew that I would need an avenue
to surreptitiously post anonymous press, so, with the full knowledge
of the GM, I created an additional persona (completely legal under
the House Rules used on Ecunet), complete with inbox (internal
address) and information. In real life, Robert Waddell was a UCC
minister in New England, with a real address and serving a real
church. In the game, Robert Waddell was a minister new to Diplomacy
who was interested in observing the game before he played on himself.
<P>
My intention was simply to have Robert Waddell make some innocuous
comments on play now and then, and to pass messages to other players
from sources who wished to remain anonymous. However, within two
days, Robert Waddell was approached by the German diplomat with
a plan to allow Waddell to help shape German moves as a means
of &quot;on the job training.&quot; Waddell accepted. Soon, the
German diplomat was sharing his inmost plans and secrets. I was
quite pleased with the level of intelligence this was providing,
and only hoped that it would serve me well as the game progressed.
<P>
But then, my hopes were utterly surpassed. Immediately after the
first moves were announced, the German wrote me a note telling
me that he had asked the GM to give Waddell permission to submit
moves for Germany. After verifying that this request was valid,
the GM granted that permission.
<P>
As the second season progressed, the German was shaping a plan
of attack and supporting diplomacy to gain three builds. Playing
in his first full game, he was betting on the ability to stab
everyone early, devastate their plans, and sweep to a victory.
The diplomacy he used was mostly of the &quot;I'm better than
you are so you'd better do what I say&quot; style. I tried to
counsel that he bring his plans back to reality, and that he try
to build some solid alliances. He felt his plan better.
<P>
So I decided to try to eliminate him as early as possible. Five
minutes before the deadline, I submitted orders for all three
of his units to move to non-supply-center provinces. In a well
coordinated effort between me and my allies, two of his supply
centers fell the first year, and the third was undefended. It
fell in Spring of 1902.
<P>
Until the report was posted, he never knew what hit him. Within
five minutes after the deadline, he wrote to me exulting in his
great skill, and bragging about how I was learning at the feet
of the master. As for me, though I did not benefit directly from
the stab (my units had already committed to a Balkan attack),
I gained some tremendously valuable political IOU's from other
diplomats which I parlayed into an effective position.
<P>
Unfortunately, I cannot say that that stab helped win the game,
for after 1905, the GM quit, and the game dissolved due to the
disgruntlement of some of the players caused by the GM's actions.
But, it is my favorite stab up until know, and I suspect will
always be in my top 3 list.
<P>
