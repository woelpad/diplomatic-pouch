In a particular game, I was playing England -- one of my least favorite
countries to play. I don't know why, but sometimes I have good
success as England despite my mistakes. Call it luck. I'm like
a lot of other players -- drawing England gives me a safe feeling, but I'm
never confident of winning.
<P>
I did the usual talking with France and Russia, and with Germany.
Nothing unusual -- they all wanted to be my buddy. I decided to
wait it out. One nice thing about England -- you don't have to jump
in bed with anyone right away. Just relax and see who lets you
into Belgium. Oh, I almost forgot: we played without an Italy
in this game -- pretty common for our face-to-face games -- so some of
my options were limited.
<P>
In the game's opening moves, Germany moved to Denmark and moved
into position to grab Holland...hmmm, only one unit on Belgium.
Interesting...and he set up to do some bouncing in Sweden. Looking good
there. France opened with the &quot;Maginot,&quot; supporting
himself into Burgunday and taking the Mid-Atlantic. Standard,
slightly anti-German. I liked it and I decided right then to
make a play for Belgium, arguing with France that it was rightfully
English and would help him against the German. 
<P>
The Russian player opened to Silesia, a strange move which insured
his loss of Sweden, I thought. Austria went to Galicia, and Turkey
attacked Russia in Armenia, but got bounced in the Black Sea.
<P>
In the fall, Austria took Greece unopposed and supported himself
into Rumania, bouncing out the Turk and and hamstringing poor
Russia, who also tried and failed for Rumania and bounced in the
Black again. I tried to tell him to support himself into Rumania,
but it mattered little since Turkey hit Sevastopol. Russia anticipated
Germany's bounce in Sweden and decided to take the Kaiser down
with him, sending Silesia to Berlin and sailing into the Baltic
Sea.
<P>
Germany did go to Sweden, but showed a timid streak by covering
Munich as well as grabbing Holland. The fleet in Sweden was
hopelessly cut off. I began to salivate, visions of Scandanavian
dominance dancing before my greedy eyes.
<P>
France promised me support into Belgium, then bounced me there,
the dirty rat! He also took Portugal, and Spain, getting himself on
my bad side with his trickery. He would have been better off just
letting me have it. As it was, I grabbed Norway and decided not to
trust the French player again. He told me he wanted to &quot;control&quot;
my actions when I asked him why he screwed me in Belgium. Note:
never tell a player this, especially early in the game -- it just
makes you seem pompous. Better to lie!
<P>
Well Austria went up to six units, and I felt frustrated, building
only a fleet in London. While Austria dominated things in the south,
benefiting greatly from the lack of an Italian player, I decided
that Germany and Russia would beat each other up long enough for
me to get some revenge on the French. In Spring 1902, he bounced
me again in Belgium, but that was okay. France did not build any
fleets, choosing to concentrate on armies, building new ones in
Paris and Marseilles.
I thought not building a fleet in Brest was a big mistake.
<P>
I took the Channel while France repositioned himself by going
back to Marseilles and the MAO, and moving Paris to Picardy to try
and grab Belgium. Germany, meanwhile, scrambled for my support,
offering to help me to Belgium. He didn't count on such a vigorous
Russian counterattack. He didn't care what happened to France
as long as he could concentrate on Russia. He rushed back to Denmark,
leaving Sweden for me. I played it cool, holding in Norway -- not
wanting to tip anybody off -- content to let the mayhem continue.
Russia was dying in the south, but able to hold in Germany, with
Fleet Baltic, Army Berlin, and Army Silesia. Quite a wall. I decided not to
push on to St.&nbsp;Pete as long as he was doing the dirty work in Germany.
<P>
In Fall 1902, Austria began to crack open Italy's centers, grabbing
Tunis and threatening to run away with the game. Fortunately,
he got careless and Turkey snuck into Greece. Turmoil ensued,
as Austria's confidence was shattered by smart Turkish play. Russia
joined in the fun by getting Rumania. What was going on here?
One minute Russia was dead and Austria was a step away from eight
centers, then suddenly everything had changed as Turkey (wisely) decided
to use Russia to take down Austria a peg (good lesson for those
players who give up on a &quot;dead&quot; country).
<P>
As for me, with German support from Holland I convoyed London
to Belgium. I also held in Norway, although Sweden and St. Petersburg
were there for the taking. But sometimes, it's better to <b>not</b> take
centers. I gained <b>two</b> gamelong allies by letting Germany and Russia
hang onto their centers...and I insured that they would have plenty
of ammunition to throw at each other. There's another good lesson.
Sometimes it pays to be patient. And it paid off for me. Eventually,
Germany was able to re-take Berlin, but I took Sweden to ensure
that he didn't grow as a result. And to keep Russia weak I eventually
had to snag St. Petersburg, sealing off the north from further
fleets. And you know what? Neither one of them protested because
each one wanted me on their side in the Russo-German war! Germany
won the war in part because later, during a key exchange, Russia
did not allow room for a retreat and an army was destroyed, enabling
Germany to throw him back on the defensive. I guess it would be
fairer to say that Germany won the &quot;battle,&quot; because
I definitely won the &quot;war.&quot; France turned out to be
an easy mark, and I convinced him to go south and take over Italy
while Austria held off Turkey. He eventually built a fleet in Brest,
but I kept it pinned in, denying it access to the MAO.
<P>
I eventually got enough units to flank France in the Irish Sea.
It was a backbreaking move, and I took the Mid-Atlantic, collapsing
France and grabbing the Iberian peninsula. Marseilles was my 18th
center.
