<B>INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
One of the best things about meeting people who have played Diplomacy
is hearing their &quot;war stories&quot; if you will. Generally,
PBEM stories are pretty bland because they lack that human element.
Nothing beats face-to-face, and I hope some of these stories show
why. Anyway, enjoy this story, it's all true, although I've had
to consult old orders to jog the memory a bit.
<P>
Without exception all of my games took place in the student union
of the University of Northern Iowa, and the players were all collegues
and friends of mine from around Cedar Falls and in the History
Department, where I worked. (But mostly played diplomacy!) This
particular game was quite fun, marked as it was by a...
<P>
<B>STAB OF ENGLAND!!</B>
<P>
This occurred in a five or six player game in which I was Russia.
It was very early in my Diplomacy &quot;career&quot; if you can
call it that. I was playing it close to the vest and relying heavily
on the advice of my friend Tyler, whose board we were using that
day. Tyler was playing France, and with my trusting him, he was
doing quite well that afternoon. Tyler is a tremendous diplomacy
player, largely because he is a great liar, able to keep his emotions
and motives hidden. In another life he would be a great snake-oil
salesman. As it is, he's a history teacher, but I think he missed
his true calling as a car salesman or politician.
<P>
Anyway, Tyler was really rolling along by the time the game began
to approach midpoint. I was doing well too, growing modestly in
the north but coming to tentative blows with England, played by
Fred, our resident Germanophile and extreme right-winger, who
in-between his rantings about the liberal media managed to grow
at the expense of Germany, primarily by snatching Denmark, which
I had my eye on. However, I got back at Fred by fighting him for
Norway, much to his dismay.
<P>
Austria, as was so often the case, had been gobbled up by myself
and Turkey. This was good and I was able to put some extra muscle
in the north, but tensions were growing between myself and Turkey,
who also was struggling with France over Italy (Italy was a neutral
in this game. Well, actually we have several variations we use
when we're short a person, I'm not sure which one we used.)
<P>
Well, to get back on track, Germany was reduced to nothing more
than a buffer power. England (Fred) and France (Tyler) were, surprisingly,
beginning to come at odds with each other over the German spoils.
I, at the urging of Tyler, ignored most of those squabbles (Tyler
felt he could handle Fred on his own and wanted me to check Turkey
so he could gain in neutral italy--a wise strategy.) and stabbed
at Turkey, played by the ever-troublesome Brian. Now, Brian is
a good player, but not as good as he thinks and not as good as
Tyler. He's very aware of this and so he is extremely conscious
of what Tyler is doing. So when I stabbed him and grabbed the
last piece of Austria for myself he began a very logical argument
that if I stabbed him further it would allow France to win the
game.
<P>
I brushed him off and continued to campaign in his area, but he
persisted. Soon it was apparent that Tyler (France) was making
headway against England in their race for continental supply centers,
and soon Fred (Eng) joined in the argument. Fred also wanted to
divert my attention from him, as my northern fleets were what
was costing him mobility against France. So I relented...and the
three of us formed a plan, by which my Norwegian army would be
convoyed to London by Fred's English fleet in the Spring. In the
fall His channel fleet would put my army on French soil, where
it would tip the scales in favor of our English-Russian alliance.
Turkey was all for this and began to make plans for taking over
italy. I did very little on the planning of this but went along
with it, convinced by their arguments that Tyler (Fr.) was about
to win the game.
<P>
Now, Tyler wasn't really about to win the game, but the handwriting
was starting to appear on the wall that he would, so long as I
remained a thorn in turkey's and England's side. Neither one of
them could concentrate on France while I was a power in the east.
Meanwhile france was beating them both and pushing into central
europe.
<P>
When the spring orders were read a raucous scene ensued and heads
around the union turned. It was clear by Fred's convoying of my
English army to London and by my other moves threatening Kiel,
that I had joined forces with England against France. And mind
you, I really did intend to do this. I enjoyed the thought of
putting a russian army into France, where it would be guaranteed
either Paris or Brest the next year. All of us got a kick out
of that.
<P>
But Tyler (Fr.) isn't a good player just because he plays with
me all the time (although that doesn't always hurt). And he took
me aside and in the 10 minutes before we wrote our next orders
he managed to turn me completely around. Sort of. Tyler knew he
couldn't fight all of us and last out the hour. He had to get
me to back up. But how? I was already so committed to an attack
on him. Well, this is what he did, and let this be a good lesson
to those of you who resond to a stab by curling up into a little
ball or swearing revenge, or resigning, etc. It's never too late
to turn lemons into sweet lemonade!
<P>
The simplicity of Tyler's plan still makes me shake my head. He
pulled me aside and thrust his hands into pockest, a grim look
coming over his face. &quot;Now look, I know you're kind of stagnating
over there, I don't blame you for trying something like this.
(Of course he was upset but--hint to good players--he acted as
if he didn't.) But there's one thing I want you to consider. Fred
(Eng.) is no doubt promising you this and that once you help him,
Right? Well I can offer you three centers right now.&quot; 
<P>
My attention, of course was grabbed.
<P>
&quot;Stay in London,&quot; Tyler (Fr.) said.
<P>
&quot;Huh?&quot; I said, finally beginning to grasp the obvious.
<P>
&quot;Just stay there,&quot; Tyler said. &quot;When he writes
his convoy order just have Army London hold. It will destroy him.
There's no way he can get it off the island, ever. (England was
unoccupied, though fleets were around it) Now, he's also going
to support you into Kiel right? Don't worry about that. I'll just
vacate it and you move in. Then I'LL support YOU into Denmark.
Fred will LOSE three centers, I'll stay the same (tyler had picked
up a build from Eng. in the spring which he was going to hang
onto) and you will GAIN 3 builds.&quot; [I paraphrased this conversation,
but this was the heart of the deal]
<P>
Needless to say the plan was tempting. We carefully looked over
the board, Tyler motioning at the move angrily, so as to not let
Brian (Tur.) and Fred (Eng.) know what was going on. We broke
up, Tyler went and argued with Fred. I surveyed the board...the
move was winner. Fred would be defenseless, even if he knew it
was coming. But did I want to stab Fred? We had made such a good
pact, and after our previous fighting agains each other it was
a relief to be on the same side (another hint for players--sometimes
former enemies make the BEST allies because they are relieved
to be rid of the stress of combat. Watch out for this.)
<P>
I wavered, not knowing what to do. Fred, unaware of his mortal
danger, discussed the rosy forecast ahead for us, and all the
centers we would gain. We would gain lots of ground if we took
out France, although it would be later, not sooner.
<P>
With the clock ticking, Tyler gambled and told Brian (Tu) about
the plan he proposed. I am not 100 percent sure what reasoning
he gave Brian as to why it would benefit him if I stabbed Fred
(Eng.) but it must have been at least half-way convincing, because
Brian pulled me over and asked me if I was going to do it. He
thought I should keep the pressure on Tyler (Fr.) but he added
that it would be &quot;...a great move if it worked.&quot; I think
Brian didn't really believe that Tyler would give me all the support
he had promised me, but he also said later he thought (I don't
think Tyler put this in his head--Tyler said this was Brian's
own line of reasoning) that no matter what happened he would benefit
in the long run. Of course, he didn't want me to gain 3 centers
in one swoop, but he really thought the whole thing would just
embroil Eng, Fr, and Russia allowing him to win.
<P>
So Brian never leaked it to Fred in England. Instead he sat back
and waited to see what would happen. I myself didn't know what
I was going to do until I erased the order I showed Fred [A Lon-Pic]
and looked at A Lon...
<P>
So I sat there while eveyone wrote their orders. Tyler said he
would let me into Kiel and support me into Denmark. He even showed
me the orders...Of course we allowed erasing...which I had done
after showing Fred the orders he wanted to see...What if he backed
out? I would not get Kiel as I would have cut my own support to
it in Denmark, and instead of getting 3 SCs I'd get only one,
and a new royally pissed off enemy in Fred (Eng.) It would be
a great move by Tyler to really blunt this stab. But it would
still hurt him...and he did tell Brian about it. He must be serious
about supporting me. Should I risk my new alliance to join my
enemy? Who really was my enemy?
<P>
Well, what do you think I did?
<P>
I wrote &quot;hold&quot; after A Lon...and when the orders were
read the look on Fred's face was priceless. Eyes bugged out, mouth
hanging open, unable to speak, Fred watched as three of his supply
centers were conquered, and the prospect of taking off units would
leave his trousers down, to say the least. To top it off, his
capitol, London, was pillaged by barely civilized hordes of Russian
troops. To Fred, who lived and breathed German history and always
played the game in a different kind of reality (what difference
did it make if London is captured--it had no more significance
than any other center--but to Fred it did) losing to the Russians
was unthinkable, absolutely devastating. Brian howled with laughter
and pounded the table &quot;London held! London held!&quot; Tyler
celebrated the downfall of his rival and I sat embarrassed, trying
not to gloat over Fred, who finally looked up and said &quot;How
could you?&quot;
<P>
It was glorious. Fred recovered after a minute or two and we all
enjoyed the incredible turn of events, moving the pieces around
and supplying all the inside info that made the move possible.
<P>
We continued the game, which we decided to end in a four-way draw
due to time rather than positions. I followed my stab of Fred
in England by attacking Brian in Turkey, and we all agreed that
the game would end with Brian crowning the winner by deciding
who he would yield to in the south, Russia or France. England
still had a couple of rogue units around, intent on harrassing
me in Russia (Wouldn't you?) But after the BIG stab there wasn't
much energy left in the group, so who knows.
<P>
Anyway, we talked about that stab for years. And I've never seen
it duplicated. In fact I've never seen anyone in any of my games
purposely let the weasel into the hen house and then get stabbed
so swiftly. It's also one of the all-time fastest destructions
of a power I've seen, when you consider England was fairly strong
and we were approaching mid-game. We started calling it &quot;Fred's
Pearl Harbor,&quot; and then someone would always add stuff like,
&quot;except he let the Japanese bomb San Franciso too,&quot;
or &quot;Yeah but then Fred invited the Imperial Army to visit
Washington D.C.&quot; stuff like that. We got a lot of mileage
out of it, and amazingly, Fred and I formed many strong alliances
in other games, and stabbed each other both at times, always bringing
up &quot;Army London hold&quot; when we did.
<P>
Well, I hope this helps you when fortunes take a sudden turn in
your games.
