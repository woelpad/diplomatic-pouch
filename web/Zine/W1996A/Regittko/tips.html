<B>Introduction by Andy Schwarz</b><P>
The Judge which Ken Lowe, blessed be he, endowed the Diplomacy community
with in his wisdom and grace, has brought thousands of players together all
across the globe.  Postal Diplomacy and and its e-mail cousin both existed
before the judge, and both continue in good health, but the ease of Mr.
Lowe's creation has led to an explosion of interest in and play of
Diplomacy.
<P>
But, here's a heretical thought: the Judge is hard to use.  No, not for
wiley veterans with thousands of dedication points, but for the newcomer --
either to Diplomacy in general or to the Judge in particular -- the first
baby steps on the Judge can be fraught with peril.  Consider how easy it is
for a newbie to miss a deadline, create an error flag without knowing it,
accidentally broadcast his or her identity in a gunboat game, confuse grey
press and fake press, etc.
<P>
Many resources exist to help newcomers (modestly, may I recommend
<a href=http://haas.berkeley.edu/~schwarz/main.html>The Newbie's Guide
to the Judge</a> as a good starting point),
but nonetheless newcomers often find themselves in a game without an iota
of a shred of a hint of a clue.  In one such game, <tt>fornew</tt>, which
ran on the USEF judge in 1995, the GameMaster, Bruce Regittko, chose to
help out his new players with a series of tips on using the judge more
easily and more productively.  I was an observer in this game, having been
one of the two people who got Bruce involved in Judge Diplomacy.  Jamie
Dreier was the other, and he also observed this game.  Many of the tips
Bruce shared with his players (and now here, with the DP audience) came
from Jamie, and a few came from me.
<P>
I was so impressed with Bruce's compilation of tips and tricks I submitted it
to Manus to run in The Diplomatic Pouch.  And now, here it is,
available for all to read.  This is highly recommended for new judge users,
and I bet even old-timers may learn a thing or two.  Thanks to Bruce for
having authored this fine text, and to The Diplomatic Pouch staff for
sharing it with us all.  Consider this catechism a Diplomacy Christmas gift
from Bruce, et al., to the world.

<B>Preface</B>
<P>
From time to time, I will be broadcasting some information about
the judge either from my own experience or as a response to one
of your questions. The title of this series -- Tips from the Master
-- is really a play on words. Many of my tips I learned from making
some blunder when I was just starting to play Diplomacy on the
judge. 
<P>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #1</B>
<P>
I have &quot;tweaked&quot; the deadline settings slightly to ensure
that the next movement phase deadline is 3 days hence and that
the next retreat or adjustment deadline is 1 day hence. &quot;Why
was this necessary&quot;, you ask? When the &quot;next&quot; setting
is 72, it means that the earliest the next  deadline will be is
72 hours from when the moves processed. Normally, the deadline
then slides up to 11:30 p.m. EDT for a move but the orders will
be processed as soon as everyone has submitted error free  orders.
<P>
However, if someone has &quot;set wait&quot; then the orders won't
be processed until 11:30 on the day of the deadline but due to
the actual time it takes to process the orders and whether or
not any other games are processed before our game, it may be a
few minutes after 11:30 before the next deadline is calculated.
Thus, if for example, the judge processes orders at 11:45 p.m.
on Tuesday, 72 hours later will be 11:45 p.m. on Friday and the
deadline will slide up to 11:30 p.m. the following Tuesday. With
a 71 hour &quot;next&quot; setting, the new deadline  would be
on Friday at 11:30 or 3 days.
<P>
I am also going to change the &quot;clock&quot; setting for retreats
and adjustments to 1410 so that their deadlines will be set at
11:30. This will make things a little easier for you knowing that
any deadline will be at 11:30 and should not slow the game down
much.
<P>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #2</B>
<P>
I see that as of this writting, only 3 of you have submitted orders
and one of those has &quot;set wait&quot;. I encourage each of
you to submit orders as soon as possible and to &quot;set wait&quot;.
When you issue the command
<P>
<samp>set wait</samp>
<P>
you are telling the judge to not process orders before the deadline.
You may change your orders at anytime up until the judge processes
your orders. This way, if something comes up, you won't miss the
deadline and receive a late message (and lose a dedication point).
Once you are sure that your orders are final, you can turn off
wait  with the command
<P>
<samp>set nowait</samp>
<P>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #3</B>
<P>
A game that is rated will award or deduct dedication points from
players based on whether or not they get their orders in on time.
Rated  games also require that players attempting to signon have
at least a  minimum number of dedication points. The default minimum
is -10 but I  have seen this vary from a low of -2000 (no, that
is not a typo) up to  over 200.  Basically, players with a dedication
rating over 100 or so are considered fairly reliable while players
with a rating under -100 or  have most likely been naughty in
the past.
<P>
Everytime you get your orders in on time, you will receive three
dedication points and you will lose one for every &quot;late&quot;
message the judge has to mail to you. If you have the bad form
to not submit orders and allow the grace period to expire, you
will be listed as  &quot;abandoned&quot; and lose 100 dedication
points. This can be difficult to  recover from since most games
have a higher minimum to signon but  occasionally a rehabilitation
game will form with a very low minimum but ask yourself, &quot;Self,
do I really want to play with a bunch of  people who have proven
to have problems meeting the deadline&quot;? More  information
can be found in the deadlines file from the judge. 
<P>
And now for the real tip: Make sure that you confirm that your
orders are received by the judge and are free of errors. As you
are aware, anytime you send the judge information, the judge sends
back  confirmation to you and lists the status of that turns orders.
If you  have partial orders or errors, the orders will not be
processed and  you will miss the deadline. It might look like
it is okay, but any error (even if you submit valid orders and
then try to change them later on and have an error in the new
set) will cause the judge  will show you the orders but also say
that &quot;unless error free orders  are received by the deadline,
you will be considered abandoned&quot; or  words to that effect.
<P>
You *MUST* submit some valid orders or else you will have problems,
that is the last set of orders, either full or partial, must be
error  free. If you liek the orders entered but have an error
message, just  signon and then signoff. That will clear the flag.
In a game I was playing in recently, I submitted some valid orders
and then did something silly; I changed my orders and tried to
have a fleet support an army in an inland province. When the judge
confirmed my orders, there was the error message but it also listed
my previous valid orders so I assumed that all was well and went
away for a few  days. When I returned, I discovered that I was
listed as CD and had  missed the deadline but when the grace period
had expired, my orders  were processed (it was an NMR game).
This mistake cost me 150 dedication points (I think) and held
up the game for a few days.
<P>
In this or most any other game, if you know that you are going
to have problems making a deadline for some reason, as the GM
for an extention. Most will grant one for a good reason.
<P>
One final comment: Dedication points do not carry over to other
judges. It is possible to have a very high rating on one judge
and a  poor rating on another so whatever you do, get those orders
in on time.
<P>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #4</B>
<P>
Everytime that you correspond with the judge, the judge will comfirm
receipt of your message by emailing you a reply. If there is a
problem with the judge, you obviously won't get your reply.
<P>
The instinctive reaction by most people is to send the message
again  or to send multiple requests for game listings. Once you
know that the judge is down, you should not send any &quot;test&quot;
mail to the judge because  when the judge eventually does come
back up it will have to process all of its waiting mail including
your &quot;junk&quot; mail which will just  slow everything down.
<P>
When I suspect that the judge is down, i.e., I have not gotten
a reply from a message, I send one, repeat one other message.
The chances that two messages were missent or lost due to my own
fumbling are remote (I hope). Negotiations can still be carried
on via direct email with the other players unless the game is
a gunboat variety where the identities of the other players are
unknown.
<P>
Usually the judges are very reliable and if a problem occurs,
it is  fixed in a matter of a few hours. The judge keepers will
usually post a message on r.g.d. if the problem will take longer
to rectify. Nevertheless, occasionally a deadline will be missed
and a player could lose some dedication points and even become
abandoned. If the amount  of dedication points is small, don't
bother asking the GM to have the  points restored. However, if
you inadvertenly wind up CD or  abandoned, ask the master to have
the judge keeper restore the points  if you feel you need them.
<P>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #5</B>
<P>
Anyone who is runing either a postal or email game of standard
Diplomacy should get a Boardman Number (BN) from the current Boardman
Number Custodian (BNC). The BNC for email games is Nick Fitzpatrick
and he automatically assigns a BN to every non-variant, non-gunboat
Diplomacy game begun on any judge of which he is aware. For gunboat
games and variants, BNs are not used but rather, Miller Numbers
(MN)  are assigned. Nick is also the email Miller Number Custodian
(MNC). If you ever play in or moderate an email (or postal) non-judge
game of Diplomacy, you should contact the BNC/MNC and ask to be
assigned a  BN/MN. More information can be found in _Diplomacy
A-Z_, edited by Mark Nelson.
<P>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #6</B>
<P>
While this game only has &quot;white&quot; press, you should get
into the habit  of specifying the color of your press even though
you have no choice.  I'll assume that you all know what the difference
is between white and  grey press and I won't touch fake press
in this tip.
<P>
In other games, both white and grey press may be enabled and one
of  them will be the default. To avoid an embarrassing or potentialy
disasterous mistake, you should *always* indicate the color of
the  press. In a game that I am currently playing in one of my
allies sent  me a message via grey press, which is the default
in that game. At  first I was suspicious as to whether or not
he was the true author since he proposed a rather radical idea.
When I asked him for confirmation, he indicated that he thought
that white press was &quot;automatic&quot; and did not specify
it. Had the deadline been closer, I  would have probably just
have ignored the message since I could not  have expected a reply
in time.
<P>
Imagine the problems that could arise if the reverse situation
were true. A devious yet not too bright player decides to send
a grey broadcast questioning the reputation of other player's
parents but does not specify grey. In a white default game, this
player could be victim of massive shifts of alliegence.
<P>
Finally, on a related topic, *always* make sure that you spell
&quot;endpress&quot; or &quot;endbroadcast&quot; correctly. In
another game I was in, a player put a space between end and press
and I got a look at his orders further down in his text. Fortunately
for him, he was not stabbing me that turn. May you always stab
one turn before your ally.
<P>
One power sent me the question: <i>How do you set press white and grey?</i>
<P>
Do you mean, &quot;How does a player indicate white or grey press&quot;?
If so, you indicate the color of your press after the command
&quot;press&quot; or &quot;broadcast&quot;. For example,
<P>
<samp>press white to AF</samp>
<P>
would send a message to Austria and France and they would know
that you sent the message. Of course, in this game, white press
is the only  press allowed so it is not absolutely necessary to
include the word white. To send a message to England and Russia
and not let them know who sent the message, use the command
<P>
<samp>press grey to ER</samp>
<P>
Remember, however, that this game does not allow grey press so
the last example will not work. In games that allow both types
of press, you should always specify which color press you want.
If you omit the color, i.e., you send
<P>
<samp>press to TG</samp>
<P>
the default color will be used and if you forget which color is
the default, you (and the recipients) may be surprised. Always
specifying the press color even in monochrome games is a good
habit to get in so that you won't make a mistake in a game allowing
both types of press. As for the question, &quot;How does the master
set the press of a game&quot;,  I'll refer you to the index file
that you can get from the judge. If you do not have this file,
which has all of the commands the judge will accept, you can get
it by sending the command
<P>
<samp>get index</samp>
<P>
to the judge. Another useful file is flist which is a list of
all of the files you can get from the judge. The command
<P>
<samp>get flist</samp>
<P>
will retrieve this file for you.
<P>
By the way, don't try to send grey press to the master in a game
that allows grey press. The master will always know who sent the
press and you will look silly at best.
<P>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #7<BR>
</B>
<P>
If you don't want the judge to process orders until the deadline,
include the line
<P>
<samp>set wait</samp>
<P>
in the body of a message to the judge after your signon command.
(Of course, don't put it in a press message since the judge ignores
stuff  in press.
<P>
This way, you can submit tentative orders well before the deadline
and negotiate without fear of those orders being processed until
the deadline. You can change the orders at any time up until the
judge processes them. After you are satisfied that your orders
are final,  you should &quot;turn off&quot; the wait flag. Issuing
the command
<P>
<samp>set nowait</samp>
<P>
will clear the wait flag and allow orders to processed before
the deadline (assuming no other power has set wait and all powers
have submitted orders).
<P>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #8</B>
<P>
One thing that took me a while to figure out was that if I had
submitted orders for all units and later wanted to change the
order for one unit, all I had to do was submit the new order for
the one affected unit.  The other unit's orders were unaffected.
This can be a real time saver  when the number of units under
your control is in the double digits and can also help you avoid
typographical errors. Not that I have  much experience with having
that many units but I'm working on that.
<P>
However, for technical reasons, when you want to change your adjustment
orders (builds or removals), you should resubmit orders for all
units you wish to build or remove.
<P>
Suppose you have just one build. But you send in a whole long
list of  them. The judge takes only the last one seriously. Suppose
you have two  builds, but you send in a whole long list of them.
The judge takes only  the last two seriously. Suppose you have
n builds, and you send in a  long list of builds. The judge takes
the last n of your build orders as  the real ones. That's why
a new build order will replace the *first* on  your current list
of accepted builds, not the last. See? It  doesn't matter whether
the bunch of orders you send are all in the  same mail, or not.
<p>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #9</B>
<P>
You can always find out the status of each power's moves by listing
the game. Before the deadline, each power that a move is required
from  that turn will have the word &quot;move&quot; following
their power's name. Note  that this does not mean that you have
or have not submitted a move  yet. It only means that you must
make a move before the deadline if  you have not done so already.
Powers that have been eliminated and  powers that do not have
to make a move (such as in retreat and adjustment phases) will have
this field blank.
<P> 
After the deadline, powers that have submitted error free orders will 
be listed "<tt>move</tt>".  Powers that have not submitted moves will be
listed as "<tt>late</tt>".
<P>
Below is the current (partial) listing of our game which shows that
everyone has submitted moves except for Turkey.
<PRE> 
The following players are signed up for game 'fornew':
   Master                  124 bjregitt@wtcc-gw.wake.tec.nc.us
   Turkey     late    1/1  -38 matthew@paneltot.demon.co.uk
   England    move    3/3   69 bruceh@accessone.com
   Germany    move    6/6   33 ANGUS17@delphi.com
   Russia     move    8/8   30 mcmilla@ix.netcom.com
   Austria    move    5/5  -31 rhorto01@mail.win.org
   Italy      move    6/6   99 kkela@lyyra.otol.fi
   France     move    5/5   51 JKernaha@NTRNNTS1.TELECOM.com.au
</PRE>
<p>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #10</B>
<P>
Now that one power has been (virtually) eliminated, I guess I better
explain how the game ends.  The most obvious way is for one person to
control eighteen or more supply centers after a Fall retreat phase.  
Sometimes though, things don't work out that way.  A stalemate line can 
be set up by one or more powers that could prevent another from 
obtaining an outright win or two or more close allies could decide 
that they were satisfied with the way things were after eliminating 
all of their competition.
<P>
This game is set up as <tt>DIAS</tt> which means Draws Include All Survivors.
Basically, that means what it says.  If two powers have 17 supply 
centers each and the third has only 2 when a draw is agreed upon, all 
three share equally in the three-way draw.
<P>
To vote for a draw, you must not be eliminated and you must send the 
command
<p align=center><tt>
     set draw
</tt><p> 
to the judge.  Everyone must "<tt>set&nbsp;draw</tt>" or the game will continue.
Furthermore, the "voting" is secret.  You can broadcast a message
proposing a draw and then not vote for it -- a sneaky tactic to be sure!
<P> 
Finally, if a draw fails after you voted for it, you must "set draw"
again the next phase if you still want to end the game.  The draw flag is
cleared after each phase processes.
<P> 
Note that I am not suggesting that this game should or should not end 
in a draw.  I'm only mentioning this now for informational purposes.
<p>
<B>Tips from the Master -- Tip #11</B>
<P>
I received a message from a power asking, "How do you let the judge know that
you've changed e-mail addresses?"  Here's the answer.  From your new address,
send
<p align=center><tt>
	iamalso old-email-address
</tt><p>
using your old e-mail address, of course.  The judge will update the file
that it stores email addresses in.
<P> 
The FAQ also says that you may wish to re-register, but that it is not
necessary.  However, if you don't, anyone who does a <tt>whois</tt> command
to request your e-mail address from the judge will get the old address.
<P>
You also need to know that, in addition to the <tt>iamalso</tt> or
re-registration actions, each game you happen to currently be in will
need to be informed of the new address (assuming you want the new address
to be your primary one).  So you must sign on to each game and send
<p align=center><tt>
set address new-email-address
