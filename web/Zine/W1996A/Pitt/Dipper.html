Toto, We're Not in Kansas Anymore
</h2>
This issue, I'm going to return to my examination of interesting variants
which are implemented on the Internet judges.  Now in the barrel, the "Asia"
variant.
<P>
From the judge <tt>info.asia</tt> file:
<blockquote><i>
There are absolutely no rule changes
from the standard Dip rulebook. Just a new map. [...] Asian Diplomacy has
almost no historical basis. However, it is <b>very</b> well-balanced, which
should be the final criteria for a wargame. All powers have equal chances to
win.
</i></blockquote>
Well, that doesn't tell you much (and what it does tell you is,
unfortunately, inaccurate).  So, let me try to paint a clearer picture.
<H3>The Map</H3>
The territory covered by the Asia variant is, strangely enough, Asia.  More
specifically, start at St. Petersburg in the northwest corner, draw a line
south through Warsaw, the Balkans, and East Africa to Madagascar, turn east
through the Seychelles and Indian Ocean to Australia, head north through
the Philippines and Japan to Kamchatka, and then turn west through Siberia
and the Arctic Sea to link back up with St. Petersburg.
<P>
Major map landmarks include two landlocked seas, the Black Sea and the
Caspian Sea, both in the west, separating Russia and Persia and linked by a
canal through the Caucasus.  Additionally, the Himalayas (impassable) are
centrally located and divide India and China.
<P>
Significant areas of neutral SC's are Southeast Asia (Bangkok, Thailand,
Laos, Vietnam), Australia (Australia and New Guinea), The Stans (Pakistan,
Uzbekistan, Tien Shan, Novosibirsk), and the Mediterranean (the Balkans,
Turkey, and Egypt).
<P>
Here is the map for the variant.

<H3>The Play</H3>
I have played in a number of Asia variant games, as well as GM'ing several
more.  As with all Diplomacy games, nothing is fixed in stone but a number
of consistent observations can (and have) been made.
<dl>
<dt><b>Siberia</b>
<dd>
Siberia must settle with Russia and Japan in 1901, as well as China to a
lesser extent.  The Urals SC sits square between a Siberian home SC (Wsb)
and a Russian (StP).  Both parties are likely to want it and both are
likely to be nervous about the other holding it.  A typical solution is an
arranged bounce in the spring with Russia the more likely of the two to
take it in the fall if the R/S alliance is unfolding.  A part of that
agreement normally includes a stipulation that Russia will move the fleet
back to StP in 1902, leave Ura ungarrisoned, and not build further in StP.
<P>
With Japan, Siberia must resolve the status of the Novosibirsk and Yakutsk
SC's.  Japan's Manchurian army is pretty much powerless without support
from Siberia or China.  However, it can wreak havoc with Siberian lines if
it's not controlled.  Moreover, Siberia must worry about the activities of
the Japanese Hokkaido and Honshu fleets.  If they both head north,
Kamchatka is threatened.  All of this is unlikely, however, with just a bit
of willingness to compromise on Siberia's part.  Typically, Japan agrees to
stay out of the Bering Strait, takes Yakutsk with a fleet, and holds the
Manchurian army while Siberia picks up Novosibirsk.  Also, typically,
Siberia stabs Japan in 1902 with Chinese aid, especially if the R/S alliance
is in effect.
<p>
<dt><b>Russia</b>
<dd>
Russia's two parties of interest are Siberia and Persia.  The first factor
to resolve is the use (or lack thereof) of the StP fleet.  Any move by that
fleet to the Arctic Sea is certain to be received negatively by Siberia
since Arc borders two Siberian home SC's (Wsb and Kam).  However, the F StP
can go nowhere and do nothing useful without moving to Arc.  As noted
above, the most common use, if Russia is friendly to Siberia, is to take
Ura in fall 1901 and then garrison StP to ensure no future builds there.
This action pretty much stabilizes R/S relations and sets the stage for a
later (1902 or 1903) joint R/S push due south toward Uzb and Tia.
<P>
Since, almost without exception, the smart Russian and Siberian players
will form an early alliance, Russia is left with one other path for
expansion - namely, south and southwest through Persia and the
Mediterranean.  Alternatively, Russia can choose to sit back, take the
guaranteed Balkans SC, sweet talk Persia, and wait to see what develops.
Russia can afford to do this since his corner position is quite secure
unless he is besieged by both Persia and Siberia.  So long as the Russian
secures a solid alliance with one of those powers, he is in good shape
through the mid-game.
<p>
<dt><b>Persia</b>
<dd>
Persia has a leg up in some respects, in that he has guaranteed access to
the Turkey and Oman SC's in 1901, plus he's likely to get Egy in 1902.
That's the good news.  The bad news is that Persia is almost certain to
face a hostile Russian (as noted above).  In order to most effectively
stave off the Russian threat (assuming that no diplomatic solution is
achieved) Persia will be forced to build at least one inland fleet in
Irn/nc to control Cas and move or build another fleet in the west to close
off the Mediterranean.  While this can be more or less easily accomplished,
it leaves Persia with no freely available units to expand elsewhere
Madagascar, for example, is just sitting in the southwest corner begging to be
taken but, more often than not, India or Indonesia will take it first (or
take it away) because Persia has no fleet to get there or to hold it.
<P>
As a result of this imbroglio, Persia must make every effort to woo India
unless he has a rock-solid alliance with Russia.  Typically, this is not
very difficult, since India is normally focused eastward.  The only
potential sticking points are the Pak and Uzb SC's, both of which border
Irn, a Persian home SC.  Since Persia normally needs the Irn army to
protect Cau from Russian encroachment in spring 1901, the usual agreement
is for Persia to take Pak in fall 1901, then swap Pak to India in 1902 in
exchange for support into Uzb.  A normal stipulation is that India will
vacate Pak in 1903, leaving it vacant thereafter.
<P>
<dt><B>India</b>
<dd>
India starts well, as he is sure of the Tien Shan and Bangladesh SC's in
1901, likely to get Sri Lanka, as well, and, with a friendly Persia, likely
to get Pak or Uzb in 1902.  Because of the Himalayas, India and China are
effectively cut off from each other and, as a result of this lack of threat
or ability to directly cooperate, not much diplomacy happens between the
two until the mid-game.
<P>
As noted above, India is almost certain of gaining a Persian ally, so his
only remaining early concern is Indonesia.  Happily, that's not likely to
be a problem in 1901 since Indonesia is more likely to be concerned with
grabbing the plethora of available SC's in Australia and Southeast Asia.
In 1902, however, things tend to go sour for India and Indonesia is the
usual culprit.  It's not uncommon for Indonesia to get three new SC's in
1901, giving him six units in 1902.  That means he's almost certain to have
five fleets and it's a foregone conclusion that several of them will be
heading towards Sri and Ban.  India has the ability to respond by building
two fleets in winter 1901 but, if he does, he virtually cedes all future
northern expansion in The Stans to Russia, Siberia, and China.  Moreover,
his fleets will be acting in a purely defensive fashion, while Indonesia is
likely to still be grabbing one or more new SC's.
<P>
India's only hopes for long-term survival are a strong Persia building
fleets to use against Indonesia or a strong China or Japan doing the same.
Without a seaworthy ally to aid against Indonesia, India is ultimately doomed.
<p>
<Dt><B>Indonesia</b>
<dd>
The player who gets Indonesia gets the golden ring.  As noted above,
Indonesia has ready access to a number of neutral SC's in 1901 and 1902.
Further, while he's likely to tangle early with India, Indonesia enters
that fight with the upper hand and will only improve on it barring a threat
from another quarter.  If Indonesia exerts only a modicum of diplomatic
effort, that threat is likely to never develop.  Persia is probably going
to be involved in a war with Russia.  A little reassurance from Indonesia
(say, support into Madagascar) should mitigate any possible threat there.
China and Japan will likely want to compete with Indonesia for the same
Southeast Asia SC's.  However, since it will be very difficult for the two
of them to trust each other anyway (more below on that), Indonesia need
only choose one to give a small bit of support to (or just play them off
against the other) and they'll be too busy with their own squabbles to
coordinate any action against Indonesia until it's too late.
<P>
Indonesia's only down side is that it's likely to be very difficult to get
a solo.  Given his need to build many fleets early, he will find himself
army poor when it comes time for the land war through India.  Moreover, the
ease with which Siberia or Russia can shut off the northeast corner
(Kamchatka and Chucki Sea) means that Indonesia can't gain any ground north
of Japan without armies, too.  The smart Indonesia player must make the
most effective use of his fleets early and plan on an army campaign in the
mid-game in order to get a shot at a solo.
<P>
<dt><b>China</b>
<dd>
With the exception of Japan (which is just about hopeless), China starts
out with the most precarious position.  Though China appears to have ready
access to some of the available Southeast Asia SC's, he has to gravely
expose himself in order to go for them.  Japan's Manchurian army is poised
adjacent to China's Beijing home SC.  China has to make a great leap of
faith to move the Beijing army without covering it with his Shanghai fleet.
If he does that, however, Shanghai is exposed to Japan's Honshu or
Philippines fleet.  Typically, China opens conservatively, moving Sha to
SCS or HK in order to take Vie in the fall.  China is guaranteed Lao in the
1901 but, normally, will leave it until 1902 in order to use his Tibetan
army for coastal protection.
<P>
Ideally, China would enter into alliance with Japan and the two would put a
serious crimp in Indonesia's plans.  However, this rarely happens due the
extreme close proximity of their units, home SC's, and target neutral SC's.
Complicating this further is that a C/J alliance will be pressured from
both the north (Siberia) and the south (Indonesia).  Even when C/J alliances
form early, the strain on them is so great that they rarely last past 1902.
<P>
China does have one possible longer term ally, however, in Siberia.  Should
the two ally early, China will get Japan's Man SC, as well as Vie or Lao.
China then has to go full bore after Japan, eliminating the island nation
before Indonesia comes steaming north.  The chances of success are slim but
they are better than most of China's alternatives.
<p>
<dt><b>Japan</b>
<dd>
No chance.  None.  Really.
<P>
Here's the deal.  Japan has no guaranteed access to even one neutral SC.
Indonesia can (and most likely will) block access to New Guinea.  China
will do the same to Vietnam.  Siberia can do the same to Yakutsk.  In order
for Japan to even get a build in 1901, he will most likely have to resort
to the threat of hostile action, e.g. to Siberia - threaten Kam, to China -
threaten Bjg or Sha.  Those powers must cooperate if Japan is to get a
build.  The really bad news is that they are much more likely to cooperate
with each other to take a Japanese SC, not give one.  Worse yet, even if
they do allow Japan to get a build, they'll be in better position to steal
it back in 1902 than Japan will be to defend it.  Japan's only saving grace
is that the sea spaces in the area (Bering Strait, Okhotsk Sea, Yellow Sea,
and East China Sea) combined with his three fleets allow greater mobility
and flexibility.  However, this is essentially useless.  Playing fleet
shuffleboard may be fun but it accomplishes nothing except stalling and,
sooner or later, Indonesia or Siberia or China will come calling and the
game will be over.
</dl>
<H3>Analysis</H3>
This is an unbalanced variant, but one with a lot of promise.  Presently,
the corner powers, particularly Indonesia, Siberia, and Russia hold undue
sway on the outcome of the game.  I have yet to see a game where the three
of them did not last to the end game and, frequently, share in a draw.  The
distribution of SC's is uneven and unfair, with too many in the south, in
particular.  The large, centrally located, impassable area in the Himalayas
causes problem with hindering Indian/Chinese relations and also serves as
an anchor for far too many easy stalemate lines.
<H3>Suggested Fixes (Asia Redux)</H3>
<ol>
<li>Shrink the western end of the Himalayas and extend Delhi and Calcutta so
that they both border Kunlun; this would provide greater contact between
India and China and would reduce the ease and number of stalemate lines and
open up Indian/Chinese access.
<li>Move the Tien Shan SC to Kunlun, making it directly accessible to China
and India in spring 1901.
<li>Move the New Guinea SC to Korea; this gives Japan at least one guaranteed
1901 SC and takes a nip out of the Indonesian gravy train.
<li>Change Indonesia's starting Sum fleet to an army; this slows down Indonesian
growth a bit without reducing the number of SC's he has access to; it also
changes the dynamic in Southeast Asia by increasing the chances that
Indonesia will get an army ashore years earlier.
<b>Note:</b>  this change might unduly benefit India; accordingly, also
move the Ban SC to Bur, requiring India to extend himself more to take it,
leaving Cal a bit more exposed, and opening more potential for Indian/Chinese
interaction.
</ol>
Here, then, would be the map to this proposed second version of Asia.

<P>
So, there you have it.  As it is, Asia is an enjoyable, if flawed variant.
I have yet to play my suggested Asia Redux variant, however, so I can't
promise that it's better.  If there is sufficient interest, though, I will
gladly GM a game to try it out.  It's already been set up on a judge, so
get in touch with me if you'd like to give it a go.
