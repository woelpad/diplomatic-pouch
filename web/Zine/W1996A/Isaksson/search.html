<h1 align=center>In Search of the American Continent</h2>

<hr>

I have this theory of mine, not many share it with me, I am sad to say.
I do not believe in the American continent.  Well, why should I? Just because
everyone else does? No, and I have not yet seen any evidence of its existence.
This outrageous country, how could it exist? With all these strange people.
And strange things.
I say it is a hoax. A very well worked out hoax. With a long tradition and a
lot of resources to keep the conspiracy alive. From Columbus to 
today's media, everyone benefits from the hoax. What would they have been
without America? Nothing.
<P
I participate in the Diplomacy hobby less now than before, but still fairly
actively.  I have played the game since 1986, when I first encountered it
with the "help" from some of my "friends." I was somehow picked to play
Austria-Hungary, and a couple of turns later on my way home....
That year I also played my first tournament game, at the Bor&aring;s
Convention. I ended up in fourth place on the single board played. First
to third places went to my tutors.

Since then I have played a lot of games, mostly face-to-face in tournaments.
But also a lot of e-mail games and some by post (and facsimlie). My most
memorable, successful games are the GothCon tournament (18 center Germany
in the qualifications, and an 11 center Italy in the final), my first postal
game -- in which I played Russia and won (18 center), an e-mail game where I
was Turkey and, with patient diplomacy in the end, managed to break through
a true stalemate line (!) and win (18 center).
However, my most memorable achievements are those in the foreign tournaments
in which I have paticipated. At the first European Championships in Paris
(1993), I got the prize for Best France. And at the World Championships in 
1994, held in Birmingham, England, I got the prize for Best Austria-Hungary
and was the top player in the winning Swedish team.
<P>
This summer, I had the opportunity to try to find out for sure if my theory
about the American continent is correct. The World Diplomacy Championships
(WDC) were to be held in Columbus, Ohio (USA), so what could be more perfect
than going there, finding out if the place truly existed, and winning some
Diplomacy games?
<P>
For a long time it looked like I would not be able to make the trip. It costs
a lot to travel to America from Sweden. Even if the planes do probably only fly
in circles above the Atlantic before they land the plane in some remote,
secret part of Europe or Africa. But after a short talk with my boss
(Bosse W&auml;nghammar) at Algonet AB, the financing of my trip and those of
a couple of my friends was settled. My choice of teammates landed on Bj&ouml;rn
von Knorring and Leif Bergman, two active and successful players the last few
years. Maybe I would have chosen differently if some players had not been
caught in the plague called Magic: The Gathering.
<P>
Larry Peery kept us up to date with everything happening around the tournament
for a few months beforehand, providing us with lots of stuff to read. Most of
this was his own thoughts on different topics, as usual, and I am grateful for
that. Larry is one of those rare guys who not only talks but also get things
done. Even if he does talk too. And a lot!
<P>
Our plan was to get there one week in advance and have some rest and
recreation before the WDC. We decided to start with one week in Boston and
then move to Columbus and stay there for one week, including the tournament
weekend.
<P>
The trip there, as expected, took a very long time. We started from Arlanda
Airport in Stockholm, changed planes in London after a couple of hours waiting,
and landed in Boston several hours later. Tired.
<P>
Our expectations on the trip were high. I usually am very calm about these
things:  never worry or get excited over whatever may or may not happen.
No big difference this time, but I had high hopes for a fun and interesting
trip.
Bj&ouml;rn, on the other hand, is very much the worrying type. He always has
great "angst" prior to Diplomacy games and tournaments. I do not know which was
his biggest worry during this trip -- encounter a drugcrazed serialkiller with
three machine guns and a knife as big as a sword in an dark alley or facing
Diplomacy players older than his own father.
Leif is a communist. He probably expected to be caught by the CIA and tortured
at least once during the two weeks. But worry about it?  No, that is not Leif.
And besides, he has experienced it before.

As the future was soon to tell us, he got away easy. All that happened was
that a few things disappeared after passing through customs on the way there
and back: four (out of nine) boxes of Swedish wet snuff, a toothbrush, the
cap on a deodorant bottle, and a pair of shoes.
<P>
Boston. We arrived in nice weather. A bit too hot for my liking, but it could
be worse. Our hotel was situated quite centrally, just a few subway stations
from the city center. When we arrived, our room was not ready so we sat down
and waited in the lobby. And we had our first conversation (apart from the
cabby) with strangers in the USA. They were from Sweden! They said that they had
travelled around the States by car, but my assumption was that they probably
were agents of The Conspiracy. They looked like trustworthy middle-aged people,
but that just made me even more suspicious. 
<P>
The next morning, we read in a newspaper that a Swedish au-pair girl had been
butchered and that the police had found one half of her in a container not far
from our hotel. Just what you would expect. This was USA, just like on TV....
Actually,w Boston was not as much the American city that Bj&ouml;rn and Leif had
expected. Overcrowded streets, minority ghettos, drug addicts, and criminals
all was very scarce.
I must say that I liked Boston very much. Boston is a very nice city, green,
young (thanks to all the different schools), and clean. And I loved the view
from "the tallest building in New England"! It was great, far better than from
the Eiffel Tower in Paris. I especially liked to watch the planes leaving and
arriving at the airport by the seaside.
<P>
The vacation in Boston was very successful. We had a good time, stayed fairly
cool and looked around. We did some shopping (mostly records) watched the
USS Constitution (an -- in U.S. terms -- old warship), visited a computer
museum (where I sent some good advice to Bill Clinton), and tried to get in
to a baseball game. Apparently all the seats were sold out ages ago, and I
did not want to be standing for hours in the heat, watching a strange sport,
which I probably not would like.
<P>
American food. I like it! By Swedish standards, Americans get more
and tastier food for less cash. Probably this is because people seem to eat
out more than they do in Sweden. Breakfast, for instance. In Sweden, hardly
anyone eats breakfast outside their own kitchen. A slight hiccough to all this
is, of course, that Americans have a much harder time buying and making their
own meals. Columbus, especially, would prove to be such a place. No ordinary
grocery stores. Boston, at least, had its University Convenience Stores, where
you could buy bread, cheese, butter, etc. In Columbus you had to go to a
"supermarket."
<P>
Near Boston is Salem. We went there one day. Salem is a nice little town, but
slightly too hysteric. Just because they happen to have something called a
history. A few women were burnt as witches a long time ago, and now everyone
in the town has to make a buck out of it. On my map, a place called Castle of
Dracula is even situated there. Well, some things there were quite interesting.
Like a couple of shops with "mystic" things, and a theater performance of a
witch trial that we attended.
<P>
One week ends quickly when you are having fun. We went by USAir to Columbus --
a much shorter journey than the last one. Columbus was much hotter than Boston,
though. Aargh, pain!
<P>
We had some trouble with the reservations at our hotel (Best Western Columbus
North) -- they didn't want to accept our receipt. But it all worked out to
the best after a few phone calls to the agency in Sweden and to their
headquarters in New York.
<P>
Step by step we started to realize that Columbus was one of those cities which
has been cursed by the car demon (or something similar, like General Motors).
There was no subway or train whatsoever. Apparently there had been a train
station in Columbus long ago, but since no one used it, it closed. Trains
still pass right on through, though. How about buses then? Well, yes they
exist, but only on weekdays. And only <b>twice</b> a day, 6:47 and 7:10 in
the morning!
<P>
By cab on the highway, it took about ten minutes into the city center.
Very close to our hotel there was a small shopping mall. They had everything
there. Almost. Restaurants, arcades, cinema, records, clothes, liquor, tobacco,
and the largest candle shop in the U.S. But if you wanted bread or maybe some
ham, you had to take your car and go to the supermarket.
Apart from that Columbus is quite a nice city.
<P>
WDC VI joined forces with DipCon XXIX and Origins XXI this year. Origins is a
huge convention. In Sweden, GothCon, which is the biggest, comes close to one
thousand attendees, but Origins had about eight thousand. There are a few other
things that are different from Swedish conventions. At Origins there were a big
exhibit hall were a lot of game manufacturers and shops had booths. Not in
Sweden, where there are only a couple of gaming shops represented. The Swedish
convention is open around the clock, with tournaments at every hour, and the
gamers bring their own sleeping bags to sleep on the floor. This is not the
case in USA, probably because the gamers age is much greater there. But, as in
Sweden, "Magic" ruled. Everywhere you turned your head, there was a bunch of
card players, trading or gaming. Also like in Sweden there were art shows,
films, auctions, live role players (vampires), computer games, and minature
wargames.
<P>
One different thing that I noticed was that there was a much larger number of
tournaments -- all kinds of board games and lots and lots of different AD&D
adventures. But the number of attendees in every tournament was quite small.
In Sweden we have fewer but bigger ones.
<P>
I liked the exhibit hall: lots of things and games to look at and people to
talk to. Sadly it opened very late -- not until four in the afternoon the
first day. I had planned to buy more games, etc., than I actually did. but
the last day I hadn't any time to visit the exhibit hall. 
<P>
We first got to Origins the day before it officially opened. But you could
register and play/trade Magic with others who also had shown up early. We
walked around on the premises and talked to some people we had met earlier
in our lives. Like some Swedish card players and Steve Cox, a Diplomacy player
from England.
<P>
The next day, the tournament began, but not until in the evening. Which was a
big mistake. Since the games had no time limit (I like that!), some people got
little time to get any sleep before the second game started the next morning.
In Sweden we have time limits, usually set to 1908. Which is a bit sad, I
think. I like longer games. On the other hand, you usually are able to play
four or five games, whereas at WDC we only got to play three.
<P>
In my first game, I was appointed leader of all of Russia. The only other
player I knew anything about was Pascal Montagna (1994 WDC Champion), who
is from France and who played Italy. The other players were all Americans
(Austria:
Schneider, England: Ehlers, France: Avinger, Germany: Chase, Turkey: Sampson).
In the beginning things went alright. I was able to take positions in Austria
and to move down into Turkey after taking the Black Sea.
<P>
Sadly, Schneider was a complete beginner, and when I gave him all the help he
could possibly need against Pascal, who had stabbed him, he didn't take it.
He did not even defend. He did nothing.
<P>
I was in a hurry -- even though my war with Turkey went well, I hadn't had the
time to finish him off before Pascal was through Austria and on his way
against me.
<P>
He grew fast. And no one could stop him. So I pulled back, past the
stalemate line, and started to organize the defense. We did manage to put
up the line and the game ended. At that point, I had two centres left:  St.
Petersburg and Moscow. England, Germany, and Italy shared in the draw.
Pascal had 12 centers, excluding a few "free" ones in Turkey. This was all
early in the morning, and if I had been slightly less tired I might have
pushed harder for a greater draw. Turkey and I were both still both alive
and vital parts of the stalemate on our different sides.
<P>
After the first game, I got a ride back to the hotel by Pascal and Bruno
Giraudon. Thanks a lot! Great guys, both of them. By the way, Bruno was the
1995 WDC Champion.
<P>
Next day, and time for the team tournament right after breakfast. This was
the most important round. Sweden had won the two most recent WDC team
tournaments: at WDC IV in the U.K. (with me and Bj&ouml;rn on the team)
and in Paris at WDC V. 
I was selected to play Turkey this time. And now I met a completely unknown
set of players (to me). Apart from Jamie McQuinn, who I had bribed the other
day with a copy of our book (in Swedish!) on Diplomacy strategy and tactics.
He got to play Austria. The other players were: Singer (England), Milewski
(France), Stewart (Germany), Miller (Italy), and Brase (Russia).
<P>
It all started quite unusually. Italy came to me asking for a alliance between
him, me, and Austria. Interesting, I thought. I asked McQuinn if he was in.
And he was! Great. So we played along for a while. We split up the Balkans
and moved against Russia. While Miller headed for France.
When I had Sevastopol, Rumania, and Bulgaria with armies, and McQuinn still
had not been able to take Warsaw, I could not resist the temptation anymore
and I stabbed! They were shocked! I can not imagine why! I just very
peacefully moved my armies into Serbia and Budapest. And then I moved a
couple of new ones into Rumania and Bulgaria. Perhaps the fact that I stabbed
in the spring helped.  I also took Greece that year.
<P>
On the other side of the board, Germany was also growing, even faster than I
was. And suggestions for a draw started popping up. We voted on a G/I/T draw.
I said I was all for it, but I voted no. Stewart, on the other hand, said
before the voting that he was very reluctant to vote yes. Which, with some
help from me, made Italy think he was the bad guy, not I (though it was I,
of course, who had stabbed our ally). And so Italy started to help me move
further and faster north and west. In exchange, I spared some of his centers
(Venice, Vienna, and Tunis) which I could easily pick up at any time I
needed them.
<P>
The trouble was that Germany continued to grow and fast. When we both had
reached the stalemate line, we both got kind of nervous. I could break through
with the help of Miller, but to win I had to take his centers too. If I did
that, he would turn on me, and with his last two fleets (in Spain and Portugal),
he could give the victory to Stewart. So we decided for a two-way draw T/G
that passed. I finished with 14 centers.
<P>
And that was enough! Team Sweden had taken its third WDC gold out of three
possible! Bj&ouml;rn had a win with England and Leif a three-way draw as
Turkey.
<P>
After that there was only the Sunday game left in the tournament. It should
start in the morning (which it did) and end at a time we, as players, did
not know in advance.
<P>
As soon as I had heard the names of the other players in my Sunday game,
I knew it would be a very though one. I might even have screamed....
<P>
Known names was Bj&ouml;rn (known as an untrustworthy, lying bastard and one
of the best players in Sweden) who got Italy, Pascal Montagna (again) with
Russia, Steve Nicewarner (I had seen his name several times in the e-mail
community) as Turkey, and Bruce Reiff (one of the organizers, and a loud one,
too) who drew France. The other two players I had never heard of: Marc Borer
(Canada), who showed himself to be a very able Diplomacy player, got Austria,
and a guy named Mazza ended up as Germany.
<P>
I got to play England. I always have trouble playing England; it seems so hard
to get your armies into the continent. But if Germany starts as he did in this
game, moving to Denmark, Prussia, and Silesia, even I can handle England....!
<P>
At the start of the game, I had one objective: to keep Pascal from getting a
good position. I knew he was a threat to me and to others in the tournament.
I also knew I had to keep an eye on Bj&ouml;rn. If he was let loose, I had to
put a plug in the Atlantic to stop him from moving north.
<P>
As it happened, I seemed to be friends with everyone during the first couple of
years. Reiff had plans regarding Germany, who just wanted to take out Russia.
I myself just wanted <b>everything</b>! Ha ha! Hrmm.... Well, I started
picking on both Russia and Germany, and it went fairly well. But I was
increasingly worried about France. He was clever and had a few odd plans
going. Always including fleets. I did not like that. And neither did
Bj&ouml;rn. So when I got the oppurtunity, I moved into the Channel and
started the conquest of France. But I never got very far. He soon pulled back,
with all his forces. And when I did not get any help from the Italian (he too
was afraid of me, see), I was soon thrown off the French mainland again.
<P>
In the meantime, I slowly grew in Scandinavia, Germany, and Russia. Pascal
did not do much to stop me. Instead, he was very frustrated over Borer, and
wanted have him dead. Pascal, for some reason, did all he could to get to him.
That was okay by me! Even though I liked Borer and his style of playing -- he
is good and could become great!
<P>
Reiff took control of his country again and wanted, of course, to see my
fleets sail away. I, on the other hand, wanted to make a new try for his
centers, but since I didn't get any help, I took his offer to move into the
Medterranean. The plan was to either surround France even more and then launch
a new attack, or -- if France and Italy started to cooperate for real 
(which seemed likely) against my fleets -- disband the fleets off the board
and rebuild them as new fresh armies to be launched against central Germany
and Russia.
<P>
The latter case was what it was going to be, but before I had the opportunity
to rebuild them and march south, the game was over by virtue of the time-limit
being reached. It ended in a four-way draw.  Since we could not agree on what
else it should have been, the referee (Dan Mathias) chose the result for us.
I had 12 centers, in Spring. I'd have had a couple of more by the end of fall.
With a smaller draw, I would have climbed in the final standings. As it was,
I ended up on a ninth place. Same as last time at WDC IV in Birmingham, UK.
<P>
Well, I am more than pleased with my accomplishments at WDC VI. Team Champion
again, ninth place again, and a special honorable prize.
And Leif and Bj&ouml;rn did even better. Second and third place, with prizes
for Best Italy and England. Sweden dominated the tournament!!
<P>
Luckily for the Americans, Pitt Crandlemire won the individual trophy.
Congratulations, Pitt! I shudder to think what would have happened to
the American hobby if a native hadn't claimed the top spot!
<P>
I had a great time at the WDC! The best moments were, as always, the in-between
socializing. It was, as usual, great to talk to Larry Peery. And with
the new (to me) faces Edi Birsan and Pitt Crandlemire. Hopefully, we will see
each other again in G&ouml;teborg, Sweden next Easter, when it is time for
WDC VII. We expect to see full teams from the U.S.A., France, Norway, England,
and Finland. And maybe China! Who knows?! It is not as far-fetched as it
sounds. Apart, of course, from the many hungry Swedish teams who all want to
conquer the gold for Sweden for the fourth time.
Be sure to show up and beat the ruling European Champion (1995 in the UK and
1996 in Norway), Inge Kj&oslash;l of Norway.

<P>
After the tournament, there was not much more left of our trip. We stayed a
couple more days and then left by air. We changed planes in Pittsburgh and
London, and stopped by in Oslo. After that I slept for 26 hours, just waking
once.
<P>
Well, does the American continent exist? I still don't have any solid proof of
it. But I am begining to be inclined to believe so. Why? Well, commercial TV
at the hotels. Commercials every few minutes, and in-between, lousy gameshows
and the same news over and over again. To endure that you have to be from
another planet, or at least another continent.
