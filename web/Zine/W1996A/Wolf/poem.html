This little piece of insani....er, genius, came to me quite suddenly as I
looked over the Spring 1901 results of a game I'm in (I'm playing England).
Press from Turkey to me was rabidly anti-Russian prior to the move, perhaps
too rabid -- you just never know. In any case, it wouldn't hurt me to remind
A/I to be cautious, and then the poem began to whirl in my brain...and I
thought, what better way to make someone remember a particularly important
piece of Diplomacy than to make clever rhymes out of it? So what I originally
just shaped up for my own amusement, I actually ended up sending it on
as a joint diplomatic message to A/I in the game. :) And I'm just so darn 
taken by it I'm inflicting it on the Pouch readership as well.

<p align=center>'Twas Autumn, and the Turkish fleet <BR>
Did thorn and threaten in the Black:<BR>
An army in Armenia, <BR>
And Russia seemed under attack.</P></CENTER>

<p align=center>'Beware the Juggernaut, my friend! <BR>
The roll that steams, the plots that hatch! <BR>
Beware the pseudo war, and end <BR>
The devious center snatch!' </P></CENTER>

<p align=center>They took their rattled swords in hand: <BR>
Long time the battle fake they fought- <BR>
Unsurety plagued Hungary, <BR>
And the Archduke paused in thought. </P></CENTER>

<p align=center>And, as he paused with waffling thoughts, <BR>
The Juggernaut, to his great shame, <BR>
Came crashing through the Balkan dots, <BR>
And gobbled as it came! </P></CENTER>

<p align=center>Spring, Fall! Spring, Fall! And all to all <BR>
The Juggernaut just grew and grew! <BR>
The nations died in R-T tide: <BR>
The game, alas, was through. </P></CENTER>

<p align=center>But canst thou slay the Juggernaut? <BR>
Hark to my words, my I-A hearts! <BR>
Ally today, with no delay! <BR>
And stop it 'ere it starts. </P></CENTER>

<p align=center>'Twas Autumn, and the Turkish fleet <BR>
Did thorn and threaten in the Black: <BR>
An army in Armenia, <BR>
And Russia seemed under attack. </P></CENTER>
