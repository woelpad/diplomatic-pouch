About The Diplomatic Pouch

<HR>
Welcome back for another fun-filled issue of The Zine.  Much has happened
since I last talked to you in these pages, so let's get right to it,
shall we?
<H3>Pouch Skips Its First Phase</H3>
As you undoubtedly noticed, there was no Fall 1996 Retreat issue of The
Zine.  There were a few reasons for this -- I was busy, I was traveling --
but frankly, the most important reason was the low number of submitted
articles.
<P>
Right up front when the Zine went into production, I said that
the retreat issues might get skipped every so often, so there's no <i>blame</i>
as such to be laid, but I wanted to waste the first section of this "About
The Pouch" article by saying that a skipped issue is more your fault than it
is mine.  In fact -- and I didn't mean to go off on this tangent, but here I
go -- The Zine can only exist with articles, and if I don't get any articles,
there can be no Zine.
<P>
I can't write every article myself.  If you like The Pouch, if you like The
Zine, if you like the Hobby, get involved!  It doesn't take much time or
effort and you'll be helping the hobby a lot.  As Simon Szykman discusses
elsewhere in this issue, now is the time when the Pouch's delivery medium --
the Internet -- is growing fastest.  We know that there are already literally
thousands of readers of The Zine and The Pouch.  So why, when it is issue
publication time, are there so few authors represented?  Why do we find it
necessary to republish game broadcasts and
<a href=news:rec.games.diplomacy><tt>rec.games.diplomacy</tt></a> postings?
You tell me.
<P>
In fact, like Bruce Reiff, a leading light in the
postal hobby, says (also elsewhere in this issue) -- it is lamentable
that it often seems to be "the same names" contributing to the Pouch.
This is not
to say that I don't realize or appreciate the many new authors who have
joined the group of Pouch contributors (indeed, there are three more this
issue), but the number seems somehow smaller than I would think it would be.
<P>
I am probably making a mountain out of a molehill, but this molehill actually
became a fair-sized mound when the Fall 1996 Retreat issue of the Zine was
skipped.  Knowing that there are a scant three months remaining before the
publication of the next (Spring 1997 Movement) issue, I hope you'll forgive
me for perhaps taking a harsher line in hopes that we can prevent another
skipped issue for a while.
<H3>So Get Involved!</H3>
No, there's no financial incentive (unless we band together and publish a
book or something).  All I can offer is the "name in lights"
stuff.  But if you have something to say about the hobby, the game -- anything
-- send in an article!  The hobby is growing faster than it ever has, and
now is the time to stake your claim as an old-timer, an "authority," a hobby
deity.
<H3>Speaking of the Gods</H3>
Before I leave
<a href=../../W1996A/Szykman/letter.html>Bruce Reiff's message to the hobby</a>, I want
to comment on a couple of his points.  He is probably right that many of
the players who have joined the hobby recently don't know what came before,
don't recognize the names John Boardman, Rod Walker, or even Allan Calhamer.
This is indeed unfortunate if true, because the contributions of these men
and many others have given us the hobby we enjoy today.  (John Boardman
created the postal hobby singlehandedly, Rod Walker -- among other
accomplishments -- created Avalon Hill's <i>The Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i>,
which greatly popularized the play of the game, and Allan Calhamer, well
[genuflect], he invented the game of Diplomacy).
<P>
I myself must confess that I was only tangentially aware of postal Diplomacy
when I first learned the game face-to-face, and when I -- years later --
discovered e-mail play; I had never played by mail and knew nothing of
that part of the hobby.
<P>
Publishing The Pouch changed all that -- I began to receive postal
zines in my mail, I started corresponding with their publishers, and I
ended up traveling to Columbus to participate in the World Championships
where I came to know what the face-to-face hobby is all about at the highest
level.  As a result, I have become
acquainted with a great number of names from the postal and face-to-face
hobbies, and have learned a lot about their histories.  I agree that this
small bit of knowledge can go a long way to humble one, and that every true
hobbyist should have an appreciation for the hobby's history.
<H3>Breathing Thin Air</H3>
My new awareness of the postal world brought with it an awareness of the awards
which have long been established to recognize the accomplishments of the storied
names of the hobby.  It also brought to the postal hobby an awareness of The
Pouch, which had the happy result of seeing The Pouch Zine place high in the
Runestone Poll -- the list of the top zines in the hobby.  This without me
knowing that The Pouch -- as a non-postal zine -- was being considered or
that it was even eligible.
<P>
<img align=right width=200 src=miller.gif border=5>
Imagine, then, my surprise when I was informed that, for my humble work, I was
being considered for the Don Miller Memorial Award for Meritorious Service
to the Diplomacy Hobby.  This so soon after I'd even become aware that the
existing hobby had even been organized so well that there even <i>was</i> such
an award (and a whole host of others).  Imagine how that surprise doubled or
tripled when I was told that I had actually won the award!
<P>
Winning the Don Miller Award is a tremendous honor, and I hope those in the
postal world who nominated me and all who voted for me know that I truly
consider myself quite the least in the group of
winners of this prestigious award.
<P>
Still I confess that I thought having my name published in
the various postal zines as the 1996 winner was it.  To my great shock,
I actually received an <a href=dmaward.jpg>extremely nice engraved plaque</a>
in the mail.  The organization of the existing hobby surprised and humbled me
yet again.
<H3>The Awards Controversy</H3>
When the nominations for the Don Miller Award came out, and when voting
was being conducted, I was aware of a bit of a controversy surrounding my
nomination.  The award had always gone to a postal hobbyist, and the nomination
of someone who is known as more of a PBEM player was breaking some unbroken
ground.  While it is true that the Pouch is a resource for all the sub-hobbies
(and we continue to work to
make it even more so), it is also true that it is perhaps an injustice to
those before me in the PBEM hobby that their tremendous contributions have
gone unrecognized.
<P>
I would like to remedy this, and have proposed that the PBEM "sub-hobby"
create for itself a set of awards, just as the postal hobby did so long ago.
Ken Lowe, who created the Internet judge -- among so many others -- deserves
an immortal place in the annals of hobby history.
<P>
I don't want to overstate the "controversy;" indeed, no one was questioning my
eligibility or even my humble qualifications, and I want to commend the postal
hobby for not being "provincial" and for nominating and voting for me.  With
this in mind, I also don't want the proposal to create a set of PBEM awards to
sound provincial either -- from a "PBEM only, let's keep the PBM'ers out"
point of view.
<P>
Rather, my admittedly limited understanding of the awards suggests to me that
the Don Miller Award seems to be a general award which can be given to the
single person who has done the most for the hobby (be it one or more of the
sub-hobbies), while others of the heretofore PBM awards may be, by their
definition, more suited to postal play only.  Similarly, there are awards
in the face-to-face community (the World Dip Cup, for instance) which are
suited to that sub-hobby alone.  All I propose is that a similar set of
awards be created for the PBEM hobby.
<P>
It is my hope that the establishment of such a set of awards does not
divide the sub-hobbies in any way.  As Simon Szykman says, The Pouch is meant
as a vehicle for bringing the sub-hobbies together.  I myself am a testament
to the fact that it can do just that. Our current FTF World Champion,
Pitt Crandlemire -- who entered the hobby as a PBEM'er, got involved with
the Pouch, accompanied me and Simon to World DipCon, and who now is an
active postal player and even a sub-zine publisher -- is perhaps the very
best example.
<P>
For all the commonality and history that the sub-hobbies share and should
share, the fact remains that the three sub-hobbies are in fact sufficiently
different to warrant three separate awards sets.  Beyond this, however, I
hope that The Pouch can continue to provide incentive for players from all
sub-hobbies to involve themselves in each of the others.
<P>
So look for more information in thes pages and elsewhere on the formation of
a set of PBEM awards.  I myself have given some small amount of thought to
the topic, and would suggest that, like the postal hobby has done, the PBEM
awards be permanently named after the founders of the hobby (such as, for
example, Ken Lowe), and that a group of awards be granted <i>en masse</i>
to those who "would have won" in years past.
<H3>Other News</H3>
As you may have noticed, The Pouch has once again touched itself up for
the new year.  Since we've now done it twice in a row, we're thinking that
it will be an annual event.  You can check out the changes we made (which
are dwarfed by last year's overhaul) in <a href=../../W1996A/Szykman/1997.html>an
article elsewhere in this issue</a>.
<P>
<H3>Can Anyone Read Kanji?</H3>
<P>
If so, maybe you can tell us what the first known mention of The Pouch by the
Japanese press says.  This appeared in the November, 1996 issue of the Japanese
edition of MacUser magazine.  I hope it doesn't speak too ill of us!

<P>
If you can read what it says, drop me a line and give me the translation.
Your help will be appreciated and acknowledged.  You should know that I
am not even sure if this is the only part of the page that talks about The
Pouch.  I found this paragraph below a screen shot of the front page of The
Pouch, but there is a lot more text on the same magazine page, both preceding
and following the screen shot.
<H3>Well, That's It For Now</H3>
As always, I hope you enjoy The Pouch!
