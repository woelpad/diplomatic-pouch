Hi ho everyone.  It's time, once again, to reach into the mailbag and see what
comes out.  But before we do, let's set up a new topic for discussion, shall
we?
<P>
So far, we looked at waived builds and -- with this issue's letters --
at unit disbands and removals.  So we've covered the adjustment phase, and
discussed at least one aspect of the retreat phase.  What's left but to
bring up a movement phase topic, then, right?
<P>
So how about this:  let's talk about Spring stabs versus Fall stabs.
Obviously, both have their time and place.  Rack your brains and come up
with your favorite example of the "perfect" Spring stab or Fall stab.
What places on the board are just natural Spring stab terrain?  Where can
you and your ally reasonably be expected to be that would just be perfect
for a Spring (or Fall) stab?
<P>
Kind of a wide-open topic, but hopefully you know the kind of thing I'm
getting at.  Anyone who's been in Galicia while allied to Austria has
had the mind race and the mouth water when Spring approaches.  Tell
your favorite tale and earn yourself not only my gratitude for reading
this drivel and responding to it, but also a place in the next Pouch Deposits.
<P>
So get on the stick and <a href=mailto:manus@manushand.com>send in your story,
anecdote, bit of advice, whatever</a>.  I'll be looking for it.
<P>
Now, with that out of the way, let's stick the old Hand into the mail sack
and see what we have.  We had a wide range of letters this time, so let's
get right to them.  I've taken the liberty of removing those (always very
appreciated) messages which are just pats on my back (I figure I do enough
of that myself in the "About" column).
<P>
Stab you soon,
<P>

<H3>From "Tarzan"
(<a href=mailto:Tarzan.MonkeyMan@Verizon.net>Tarzan.MonkeyMan@Verizon.net</a>)</H3>
Here's a decent example of unit removal!!  I'm in a no-press Payola game,
playing Italy, and someone ordered my units to attack France
while I was allied with France.  This eventually resulted in them ordering
me into Marseilles (not what I wanted).  I needed <b>some</b> way to
"signal" France that this "wasn't me."  In 1904 I was required to remove a
unit.  My unit in Marseilles couldn't be touched and there were other units
that were certainly less critical to my situation.  I chose to disband the
Marseilles unit to "signal" France that I wanted him (back) as an ally!!
<P>
From a Payola no-press standpoint, sometimes retreats, builds, and disbands
are the only ways to let someone know your true intentions.
<P>

<H3>From Jay Albright
(<a href=HoosierJA@aol.com>HoosierJA@aol.com</a>)</H3>
I have <b>frequently</b> removed a fleet in order to build an army.  Less
frequently vice-versa.  In fact, my allies and I have often created "fleet
eating machines" to accomplish the fleet-to-army transformation quickly and
efficently.  It's easier with fleets because  you're less likely to lose a
supply center in the process.  You are also more likely to want to try it
when playing France or possibly Turkey, when you have built too many fleets
and wish to change your mind without losing too much momentum.  It can be hard
to pull off but it has won me one game and kept me alive in many others.
<H3>From Chuck Powell
(<a href=mailto:cepowe00@ukcc.uky.edu>cepowe00@ukcc.uky.edu</a>)</H3>
My first letter to the Pouch.  I feel so...involved.
<P>
Anyway, the best disband I've seen yet, which I'm sure many of the experienced
players out there know, was a modified Lepanto by Italy
at DragonCon in 1994 (this was actually the first time I'd ever heard the
term Lepanto).  Italy ordered Army Venice to Trieste in Spring 1901 and
then had it attacked and defeated by two Austrian armies.  Instead of
retreating home, he disbanded the army, thus allowing a fleet to be built in
its place.  Combined with the taking of Tunis (and the building of a fleet
as a result) this made for an Italy with three fleets in 1902; a naval Italy
of frightening proportions!  Unfortunately, I was the "Turkey in the middle"
of this and was fooled by the ruse of Italian aggression in Austria; I was
subsequently ushered from the game, a joyfully humbling experience.
Just goes to show that even decently experienced players haven't seen
everything.
<P>
<i><b>[Editor's response: My own favorite example is also along the same lines
of these last two letters.  As alluded to in my
previous articles, this scenario was going to be the subject of a full-length
article
in one of the issues of the Zine, but instead, I'll just cover it here.
<P>
I call it the "Slingshot Juggernaut" opening.  Since I came up with it, it
has been tried twice, both times with the result of a solo win for the Russian
player after a gamelong alliance with the Turkish player (well, gamelong until
the last move, of course).  Now that I'm writing about it here, of course,
I suppose it'll never work again.
<P>
Anyway, the two biggest
problems for the juggernaut opening are convincing the other players that
there is no juggernaut and determining what to do with the Russian fleet
in Sevastopol.
In the Slingshot, both problems are dealt with by a quick and efficient
fake war.
<P>
At the beginning of the game, both Turkey and Russia claim to everyone
(especially Austria) that they will be opening against each other while
promising otherwise, and indeed, both do -- in a particular way.  Russia
sends Warsaw to Ukraine, Moscow to Sevastopol,
and Sevastopol into Armenia, while Turkey sends Ankara to the Black Sea and
Smyrna to Ankara.  To the world, this looks like a total concentration of
forces in the southeast.
<P>
These Spring 1901 moves are perhaps just a touch off-beat, but
creative explanations to the Austrian are easy to come by.  For example,
Austria would be prepared for the Russian's grand "eastern attack strategy"
with a plan like: "Okay, I've
convinced the Turk to send his fleet to Constantinople to go out to sea,
but my fleet will head south to make sure he has to guard Ankara while
I build another fleet in Sevastopol and take the Black Sea."
<P>
After the initial moves, Russia also makes sure to
occupy all of Austria's attention with his continual hand-wringing -- mad at
the Turk for not sending the fleet west and now wondering
whether to support Armenia or to use Sevastopol to assure the take of Rumania.
Turkey, of course, is equally mad at Russia for the violation of the
fictitious Armenia plank of the DMZ agreement.
If Austria can be read well enough to assure a Russian Rumania, both Russia
and Turkey plead with Austria for his support into Rumania.
<P>
In the end, Russia guesses wrong, supporting Ukraine to Rumania with the
Sevastopol army (the bright spot being the failure of Bul-Rum), and the
Turkish army enters Armenia with support from the Black Sea,
dislodging the poor Russian fleet.  And -- horror of horrors -- there are no
retreats for the fleet.  It is destroyed.
<P>
Claiming that he is giving up on the fleet idea, since it worked so poorly,
Russia builds an army in Sevastopol.
<P>
While both Russia and Turkey make loud noises about their war, and while
both enter
into convoluted plans against each other with the Austrian, the Armenian army
busies itself preparing for a convoy across the Black Sea and into the Balkans.
Meanwhile, the Rumanian and Bulgarian armies are quietly deciding
any support scheme to use against the Serbian defenses.
Before the board knows what hit it, the juggernaut is through Austria.
It is truly a joy to behold -- especially as Russia (I say, knowingly).]</b></i>

I agree that Payola is an excellent game.  The zerosum variant is the
best of the bunch.
<P>
I like that fact that you have to manage your money wiser than in
standard Payola.  You have to choose your bribes carefully or you
end up giving money to your opponents needlessly.  There is also
more opportunity for other commands besides direct bribes to move or
direct bribes to hold.

Hello, there. I just want to say hello and thanks for
the kind words in your report about Columbus, but I don't think I deserve them.
Pitt is a very good player and I really hope to see and play with him
again. Bj&oslash;rn von Knorring and I are already saving our money for
the trip to Chapel Hill in '98.
<P>
I think you're right about the game in which you were Italy and I was
Turkey. If you hadn't sacrificed yourself, I could have taken Tunis and
then forced my way to 18 centers. I kind of lost my momentum in a vital
part of that game, I had one unit too few to do what was necessary for the
win. The funniest thing about it all is that in my game as Italy, when
I grabbed an 18 center win in 1907, I could have taken 19 (I didn't take
Bulgaria because I didn't need it; in Sweden we don't and will never separate
a solo from a solo, and I was thinking in Swedish terms) and in that
game as Turkey, the other players didn't want to proceed and thought that
I was delaying the game, so I didn't take Warsaw and Vienna.
Instead, I stopped at 12 centers. So I could have won the WDC. But I can
only blame myself for the failure.
<P>
Have a good time, and hope to see you again.
<P>
<b><i>[Author's response: That Leif could be our world champion right now
is easy for me to believe after having played against him.  I must agree
that in my book, a win is a win, and a 19-center win should be worth no
more than an 18-center win.  It seems to me that to do otherwise is to
invite a board to say, "well, it's a solo, so let's give him all the centers
we can to help him in his tournamenent standing."  I was overjoyed to hear
from you, Leif, and I look very much forward to our next opportunity to
play each other.  I won't underestimate you at the beginning next time!
