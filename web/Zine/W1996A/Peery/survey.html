        The Diplomacy Emotion Survey
<H3 align=center>
        by Larry Peery</H3>

<HR>
Greetings!
<P>
I am conducting a survey of Diplomacy players of all types regarding the 
feelings they have experienced during playing the game of Diplomacy
Here is the basic information.
<P>
First, I hope no matter what kind of Dipper you are, how much experience you 
have had, or where you are located, <b>you</b> will take a few moments to fill
out this survey, and then return it to me.  
<P>
Second, if you are a PBM or PBEM zine publisher, or FTF event host, I hope
you will reprint and distribute this survey in your publications or at your
event.  If English is your second language, please translate the survey form
into your own language, distribute it, and don't forget to send me a copy
(with an English translation).  
<P>
The bigger the response, the more interesting the results should be.  
<P>
Third, individual responses will not be revealed, so feel free to tell it 
like it was.  You are welcome to share specific comments or illustrations 
regarding the various feelings listed.
<P>
The results, along with whatever lessons I can learn from them, will be 
published wherever and by whomever is interested.  
<P>
If you have any questions, send them to me at peery@ix.netcom.com, or use the 
mail address: Larry Peery, 6103 Malcolm Dr., San Diego, CA 92115, USA.
<P>
The receipt deadline for all responses is 1 March 1997.
You can postal mail or email your responses.  No FAX please.  
<P>

<b>Instructions:</b> Thirty emotions and five possible degrees of response are
listed.  Please choose only one response to express the amount of that 
feeling you experienced during the game or event you are describing.
