<H1 align=center>The Russian End of Game Statement</H1>
<HR>
I don't have a lot to say about this game. It was my first Dip
game, and I did not play it very well. But I've learned a lot from it.
<P> 
I've made some serious mistakes, and after losing St. Pete and
Moscow all I could do was to be a buffer between Turkey and Germany,
and make German life as difficult as I could, to help Turkey. I could
not do much damage, of course.
<P> 
Congratulations on Turkey and thank you for the game.
