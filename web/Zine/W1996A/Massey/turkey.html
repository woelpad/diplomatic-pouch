A few after thoughts.
<P> 
I thought that there was a very critical turning point in the game at least
from my perspective. Early on, England was forced to retreat out of Norway
by Germany. At the same time, Russia had gained a supply center from
Austria. England, who was being attacked by France and threatened by the
size of Germany, had one of two retreat choices: St. Pete's or Finland.
<P>
We all know he chose St. Pete's. That move crippled Russia for the rest of
the game, and led directly to Russia's downfall. If England had gone to
Finland and subsequently disbanded that unit, Russia would have grown a fleet
up in St. Pete's in all likelihood been a very large threat to Germany,
and a possible ally of England. I would have retreated to Finland and
disbanded,
hoping to hold on long enough for help. Again, that is just my opinion. Any
others?
<P> 
This was my first win at Diplomacy. It was fun, and the pace of the game was
good. Congratulations to all on a well played game!
<P>  
Thanks to the GM, good job.
