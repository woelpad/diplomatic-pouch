I recently finished a no-press standard Diplomacy game, called
<tt>academy3</tt>,
on the USIN judge. During the course of the game, in which I played France,
I kept a running commentary of the action, with my humble opinions about
the game. When the game ended, I submitted it as what may be the longest
EOG statement ever: some 2500 lines and over 100 kilobytes long.
<P> 
When my brother Charles first introduced me to PBEM Diplomacy, he suggested
that I first get the help files from the judge and familiarize myself with
some of the terminology of the Judges and the quirks of playing a game through
that medium.  He then suggested that I print out the summary of a recently
completed game, with its End Of Game statements, so that I could see what a
game looked like from an observer's point of view -- without having to wait
six months for a new game to progress from opening moves to conclusion.
Thus armed and ready, I plunged into the hobby.
<P> 
Now -- coming full circle -- I offer my own set of End Of Game statements,
thinking that it might be useful for newcomers who don't understand some of
the caveats and subtleties of no-press Diplomacy (because this game served
to point out quite a few of them).  Observing a no-press game is a good
place to start as a judge newbie, because you can see and know everything
that the players do.  Break out your Diplomacy board, set it up, and
follow <tt>academy3</tt> move by move.  See if you agree or disagree with my
analyses.  Try to pick out the mistakes made by me and the other players.
I think that this game is fairly representative of a traditional PBEM game,
with a twist at the end!
