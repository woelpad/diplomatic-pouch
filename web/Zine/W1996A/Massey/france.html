<HR>
<dl>
<dt><b>Spring 1901 Movement (12 July)</b>
<dd>
This is a running EOG statement, started on July 12, the day of the
S1901M phase.  We had some trouble with the no-press violation by
Russia, but I'm hoping that there won't be any further issues and that
everyone here is honorable in their play.
<P>
I took the liberty of consulting the
<a href=/Online/Openings>Diplomacy Openings Library</a> at The
Pouch to do a little research concerning our respective openings:
<P><tt>
Austria: Army Budapest -> Serbia.<br>
Austria: Army Vienna -> Galicia.  (*bounce*)<br>
Austria: Fleet Trieste -> Venice.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
The Southern Hedgehog, used five times in over 300 games.  This opening gives
Austria complete protection against early attacks by Italy or Russia, while
still ensuring another supply center in Serbia.  Gal-Rum is a possibility
with this opening, but not in this particular game.  The moves seem
agressive, but are just defending against War-Gal, Ven-Tri.  A sensible
opening in gunboat play.
<P><tt>
England: Army Liverpool -> Edinburgh.<br>
England: Fleet Edinburgh -> Norwegian Sea.<br>
England: Fleet London -> North Sea.</tt>
<P>
The Churchill Opening, the most popular used by England (142 instances).
Usually ensures a build in Norway; flexible enough to let her explore other
opportunities in the fall.  If England is really interested in Scandinavia
(and hence, an attack on Russia), this may be hinting at an EFG alliance.
Another good gunboat opening.
<P><tt>
France: Army Marseilles -> Spain.<br>
France: Army Paris -> Burgundy.<br>
France: Fleet Brest -> Mid-Atlantic Ocean.</tt>
<P>
The second-most popular French opening -- The Burgundy Opening.  Defensive
with respect to Germany, without giving up the Iberian builds.  Also defends
against an Italian Ven-Pie.  Given that Mun held and Ven didn't go to Pie,
I'm in pretty good shape and will go for three builds in the fall.
<P><tt>
Germany: Army Berlin -> Kiel.<br>
Germany: Army Munich HOLD.<br>
Germany: Fleet Kiel -> Denmark.</tt>
<P>
A variant of the Anschluss.  Germany tries to keep Austria strong to
protect themselves, though diplomacy is normally needed to make this work.
By threatening Denmark, Germany weakens a Russian attack on Austria.
Leaves me to wonder what Munich plans to do, though -- it's useless for
F1901.  The second most popular German opening, after the good-ole
Blitzkreig.
<P><tt>
Italy: Army Rome -> Apulia.<br>
Italy: Army Venice SUPPORT Austrian Fleet Trieste.  (*void*)<br>
Italy: Fleet Naples -> Ionian Sea.</tt>
<P>
This is the start of a Lepanto attack.  Ven S Tri is the no-press
equivalent of a olive branch, and Rom-Apu (to be convoyed to Tunis in
the fall) is the standard beginning to a joint A/I attack on Turkey and
Russia.  R/T had better beware -- when these two runts get together,
they can beat up on the big boys.  Now, will Austria cooperate?
The second-most popular Italian opening, after the Tyrolia attack.
<P><tt>
Russia: Army Moscow -> Ukraine.<br>
Russia: Army Warsaw -> Galicia.  (*bounce*)<br>
Russia: Fleet Sevastopol -> Black Sea.  (*bounce*)<br>
Russia: Fleet St Petersburg (south coast) -> Gulf of Bothnia.</tt>
<P>
This is the Ukraine System, with a southern defense.  Sev-Bla is
cautious, but you never know what you neighbor's temperment is in a
no-press game.  The bounce of War-Gal and Sev-Bla sets Russia back,
and he may not get a build.  It's difficult recover from an early
stumble in this kind of game, so it doesn't look good for the Bear.
This was the second-favorite Russian opening.
<P><tt>
Turkey: Army Constantinople -> Bulgaria.<br>
Turkey: Army Smyrna -> Armenia.<br>
Turkey: Fleet Ankara -> Black Sea.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
The Crimean Crusher, number four on the list of Turkish openings.
Coupled with the Russian opening, it looks terrific.  Unfortunately,
A/I may get it together more quickly and Turkey might be scrambling
to save Smyrna by 1903.
<P>
Overall:  things look good for F, I, A, and E; so-so for G and T,
bad for R.  I expect England may try to convoy to Bel or Hol, in
addition to taking Nor.  Germany will try for Hol as well and will
probably bounce in Swe with Russia.  I'll take Iberia and try for Bel,
Italy will take Tun and support Tri again, Austria might gamble for
Ser-Gre, Tri-Ser, and will have to choose between Bud-Gal, Bud-Rum,
and Bud S Tri-Ser.  Turkey might as well try for Bla again and cut
any support Sev is trying to give, Bul could do just about anything.
Russia should pray.
<P><dt><b>Fall 1901 Movement (15 July)</b>
<dd>The crucial fall moves are in and the shape of this game is
forming:
<P><tt>
Austria: Army Serbia -> Rumania.<br>
Austria: Army Vienna -> Galicia.  (*bounce*)<br>
Austria: Fleet Trieste SUPPORT Italian Army Venice.</tt>
<P>
A more trusting Austria might have ordered Tri-Alb to start the joint
A/I attack, but this will probably suffice.  After building the army in
Bud, he'll have to try to take Serbia from an awkward position -- perhaps
a trade of Rumania for Serbia and Greece is his strategy?
<P><tt>
England: Army Edinburgh -> Norwegian Sea -> Norway.<br>
England: Fleet Norwegian Sea CONVOY Army Edinburgh -> Norway.<br>
England: Fleet North Sea HOLD.</tt>
<P>
This is very conservative, and it seems that he's waiting to choose an
ally between France and Germany, or hoping for an E/F/G.  Russia is weak,
so perhaps he want to go right after Swe and Stp.  I don't think that
would be wise with a 6-center France nearby.  I can't believe he didn't
try to stop either me in Belgium or Germany in Holland.  Right now, he's
my first target.  A build in Edi would be pro-EFG, a fleet in Lvp would
be anti-French, and a Fleet in London would be ambiguous -- I expect the
last option.
<P><tt>
France: Army Spain HOLD.<br>
France: Army Burgundy -> Belgium.<br>
France: Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean -> Portugal.</tt>
<P>
Can't ask for much more.  Munich didn't move (ask expected), I took Belgium,
and now have three builds to England's one, Italy's one, and Germany's two.
I'm going with F Bre, F Mar, and A Par.  This is obviously pro-F/G, and I
hope the German picks up on it (after he builds two fleets, I hope!).
<P><tt>
Germany: Army Kiel -> Holland.<br>
Germany: Army Munich SUPPORT Austrian Army Vienna -> Bohemia.  (*void*)<br>
Germany: Fleet Denmark -> Sweden.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
Okay -- Munich was used to communicate a treaty proposal with Austria,
rather than actually encouraging Vie-Boh.  I'm hoping for two fleets to
join me in an F/G vs. E battle, which will be to my advantage (particulary
if Italy heads east).  Kiel is the important build -- an army is anti-French,
a fleet is anti-English.
<P><tt>
Italy: Army Apulia -> Ionian Sea -> Tunis.<br>
Italy: Army Venice SUPPORT Austrian Fleet Trieste.<br>
Italy: Fleet Ionian Sea CONVOY Army Apulia -> Tunis.</tt>
<P>
Continues the Lepanto by taking Tunis, to be followed by F Nap.  The Venice
support for Trieste is the confirmation of the alliance with Austria proposed
in S1901M.  Now for the tricky part -- moving away from those centers and
taking their strength eastward.  I assume Italy will build F Nap and won't
freak out when he sees F Mar -- I'll order Mar-Spa(sc), Spa-Gas in the spring,
which should allay his fears.
<P><tt>
Russia: Army Ukraine -> Sevastopol.  (*bounce*)<br>
Russia: Army Warsaw -> Galicia.  (*bounce*)<br>
Russia: Fleet Sevastopol -> Black Sea.  (*bounce*)<br>
Russia: Fleet Gulf of Bothnia -> Sweden.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
Trouble, obviously.  His one chance is that Turkey sees the impending
danger of the A/I alliance and calls off the dogs, pronto.  He can try
for Sweden, but England might be coming after Stp (Nwg-Bar).  Sev-Rum
has a chance and he can defend against Austria and hope for I to stab
A (not likely).  But if England attacks, it's over.
<P><tt>
Turkey: Army Bulgaria -> Greece.<br>
Turkey: Army Armenia -> Sevastopol.  (*bounce*)<br>
Turkey: Fleet Ankara -> Black Sea.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
I really don't think Turkey's making a good decision here.  As soon as
A/I join forces, R/T had better get to the battlefield.  They can bounce
in Bla and Sev till the cows come home and not make any progress. I think
he'll wise up and call off the attack, but he's badly out of position.
<P>
My predicitions for builds:
Austria: A Bud;
England: F Lon;
France: F Bre, F Mar, A Par;
Germany: F Kie, A Ber;
Italy: F Nap;
Turkey: F Smy.
<P><dt><b>Winter 1901 Adjustment (16 July)</b>
<dd>The 1901 builds are in, and hold a few surprises.
<pre>
Italy:     Builds a fleet in Naples.
Austria:   Builds an army in Budapest.
France:    Builds a fleet in Brest.
France:    Builds an army in Paris.
France:    Builds a fleet in Marseilles.
Turkey:    Builds an army in Constantinople.
Germany:   Builds an army in Kiel.
Germany:   Builds a fleet in Berlin.
England:   Builds a fleet in Edinburgh.
</pre>
Italy, Austria, and France are as expected, but Turkey has made a
somewhat confusing build.  With three armies, he leaves himself in
very defensive position against Italy.  Furthermore, with the fleet
on the shores of the Black Sea, the Italian fleets will have free
reign of the Mediterranean and Aegean Seas, which will make the
Turk's supply centers very hard to defend.
<P>
Germany's build indicate a nervousness about my intentions and a longing
for the centers in Scandinavia.  Assuming Ber-Bal, he'll be able to
take Sweden in the fall.
<P>
England still seems to be hoping for an E/F/G, but with my fleet build
in Brest, he may high-tail it back to NAO and the English Channel to
pick up the fight.
<P><dt><b>Spring 1902 Movement (17 July)</b>
<dd>If you thought the 1901 builds were surprising, you ain't
seen nothing yet:
<P><tt>
Austria: Army Rumania SUPPORT Army Vienna -> Galicia.<br>
Austria: Army Vienna -> Galicia.<br>
Austria: Fleet Trieste CONVOY Turkish Army Armenia -> Sevastopol.<br>
Austria: Army Budapest -> Serbia.</tt>
<P>
A perfect set of moves for Austria -- he's in position to take
Serbia and defend Rumania.  The bizarre convoy is his way of telling
Turkey that he'd like to see Arm-Sev and presumably, a Austrian-Turkish
alliance.  The Italian probably isn't too fond of this, if
he wanted to continue the A/I vs. R/T theme.  This could just be a
tactic to convince Turkey not to order Gre-Ser, Bul S Gre-Ser.
<P><tt>
England: Army Norway HOLD.<br>
England: Fleet Norwegian Sea -> North Atlantic Ocean.<br>
England: Fleet North Sea -> English Channel.  (*bounce*)<br>
England: Fleet Edinburgh -> North Sea.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
As expected, England rushes to the French front.  The bounce in the
English Channel keeps a French fleet off of the cliffs of Dover.
<P><tt>
France: Army Spain -> Gascony.<br>
France: Army Belgium SUPPORT German Army Holland.<br>
France: Fleet Portugal -> Mid-Atlantic Ocean.<br>
France: Fleet Brest -> English Channel.  (*bounce*)<br>
France: Army Paris -> Burgundy.<br>
France: Fleet Marseilles -> Spain (south coast).</tt>
<P>
I manuever my fleets into place so I can try for the English Channel
or Irish Sea without risking MAO.  However, the Italian moves may force
me to rethink that strategy.  I ask for Germany's cooperation and...
<P><tt>
Germany: Army Holland SUPPORT French Army Belgium.<br>
Germany: Army Munich HOLD.<br>
Germany: Fleet Denmark -> Sweden.  (*bounce*)<br>
Germany: Army Kiel -> Holland.  (*bounce*)<br>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Baltic Sea.</tt>
<P>
...Germany replies in the affirmative.  Ber-Bal sets up the
taking of Sweden in the Fall, but I'm going to need Germany's help with
England.  Not sure what Kie-Hol was supposed to accomplish....
<P><tt>
Italy: Army Tunis -> North Africa.<br>
Italy: Army Venice -> Piedmont.<br>
Italy: Fleet Ionian Sea -> Tunis.<br>
Italy: Fleet Naples -> Tyrrhenian Sea.</tt>
<P>
Naturally, this is <i>extremely</i> troublesome for me in France.  I didn't
expect Italy to react in this way, and I hope that my moves (which were
clearly pro-Italy) will convince him that he doesn't need to fear his
western flank.  I'll have to order Bur-Mar and set up for the possibility
that Italy will order Pie-Mar, Tys-Lyo, Tun-Wes.  I'm not sure why
Italy is picking a fight with me, to be honest -- the A/I alliance was
going to work very well, and he won't pick up centers very quickly in this
fashion.
<P><tt>
Russia: Army Ukraine -> Sevastopol.<br>
Russia: Army Warsaw -> Galicia.  (*bounce*)<br>
Russia: Fleet Sevastopol -> Black Sea.<br>
Russia: Fleet Gulf of Bothnia -> Sweden.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
This is progress, and perhaps England will give him a hand in Sweden
(although the German already has brought two fleets to bear against that
supply center).  If Austria and Turkey do collaborate, it's even more
troublesome than that A/I alliance that looked like it had formed.  Or,
if Turkey helps him out, he might take Rumania.
<P><tt>
Turkey: Army Greece SUPPORT Army Constantinople -> Bulgaria.<br>
Turkey: Army Armenia -> Ankara.<br>
Turkey: Fleet Ankara -> Constantinople.<br>
Turkey: Army Constantinople -> Bulgaria.</tt>
<P>
What the heck is going on here?  The fleet is moving to the Med to
fight the Italians, but Italy never got the invitation.  Now he and
Russia have to guess about each other's intentions and try to figure
out who exactly they want to fight.
<P>
This game started out as a fairly well formed, standard Dip duel, with
A/I vs R vs T, and E vs F/G.  Now, it seems that Italy might help out
England and Turkey might join with Russia.  The board is in severe flux
right now, and the Fall moves might help to straighten things out.
<P><dt><b>Fall 1902 Movement (18 July)</b>
<dd>
<center><table border><tr><th>
<img width=575 border=0 src=F1902.gif><br>
Turkey stabs Austria, who stabs Italy, who's attacking France,
who's attacking England, who could have taken a center from Russia.
</table></center><P>
I was starting to get very concerned with my position in
France, since I'd manage to attract the attention of both Italy and England.
I needed a break this Fall, and perhaps I got it.
<P><tt>
Austria: Army Rumania SUPPORT Army Serbia.  (*cut*)<br>
Austria: Army Galicia SUPPORT Army Rumania.<br>
Austria: Fleet Trieste -> Venice.<br>
Austria: Army Serbia SUPPORT Army Rumania. (*cut, dislodged*)<br>
RETREAT: Army Serbia retreats to Albania.</tt>
<P>
Austria did me a huge favor by stabbing Italy.  Actually, I think
this is a dreadfully short-sighted move on his part, since it leaves
him without an ally (expect for Germany, I guess).  The army could
have retreated to Tri or Bud; he chose to go to Albania instead.
He only gets one build; I'm not sure I understand his motivation.
He's really stretched across three fronts and could collapse quickly.
<P><tt>
England: Army Norway HOLD.<br>
England: Fleet North Atlantic Ocean -> Irish Sea.  (*bounce*)<br>
England: Fleet North Sea -> English Channel.  (*bounce*)<br>
England: Fleet Edinburgh -> North Sea.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
England guessed right, bouncing me in Eng and Iri.  We'll try again
in the Spring.  He also passed on an opportunity to take Stp.  Hopefully,
Germany will join me in the attack in 1903.
<P><tt>
France: Army Gascony -> Spain.  (*bounce*)<br>
France: Army Belgium HOLD.<br>
France: Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean -> Irish Sea.  (*bounce*)<br>
France: Fleet Brest -> English Channel.  (*bounce*)<br>
France: Army Burgundy -> Marseilles.<br>
France: Fleet Spain (south coast) -> Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
I was repulsed on all attacks, but that's the guessing-game that no-press
Diplomacy boils down to sometimes.  Since England does not build this
winter, I'm still in good shape on that front.  Italy must disband; I hope
it'll be a fleet.
<P><tt>
Germany: Army Holland HOLD.<br>
Germany: Army Munich HOLD.<br>
Germany: Fleet Denmark SUPPORT Fleet Baltic Sea -> Sweden.<br>
Germany: Army Kiel -> Berlin.<br>
Germany: Fleet Baltic Sea -> Sweden.</tt>
<P>
Germany takes Sweden, as expected, and matches my six centers.  Kie-Ber
is encouraging; I hope it precedes a build of a new fleet in Kiel.  Hol H
and Mun H is very
cautious -- he might consider heading south or east with Munich as Russia
and Austria collapse.
<P><tt>
Italy: Army North Africa -> Tunis.<br>
Italy: Army Piedmont SUPPORT French Army Burgundy -> Marseilles.<br>
Italy: Fleet Tunis -> Western Mediterranean.<br>
Italy: Fleet Tyrrhenian Sea SUPPORT Fleet Tunis -> Western Mediterranean.</tt>
<P>
The Italian continues to confuse me.  He contines after me, but the
best attack he could have made on Mar and Spa is a 50% chance of success.
Now that he must disband a unit, that evaporates.  I hope he removes
F Wes, then convoys Tun back to the mainland to help expel Austria from
Ven.
<P><tt>
Russia: Army Sevastopol -> Rumania.  (*bounce*)<br>
Russia: Army Warsaw HOLD.<br>
Russia: Fleet Black Sea SUPPORT Army Sevastopol -> Rumania.<br>
Russia: Fleet Gulf of Bothnia -> Livonia.</tt>
<P>
What does Bot-Lvn accomplish?  If England had taken Stp, I would have
been severly upset.  All is not lost though; since A and I have thoroughly
blundered away their early advantage, Russia could now play a second-fiddle
to a strong Turkey.  Not bad for someone I had written off in 1901.
<P><tt>
Turkey: Army Greece SUPPORT Army Bulgaria -> Serbia.<br>
Turkey: Army Ankara -> Constantinople.<br>
Turkey: Fleet Constantinople -> Bulgaria (south coast).<br>
Turkey: Army Bulgaria -> Serbia.</tt>
<P>
Turkey makes the most of a bad guess early in the game.  After chasing
Russia, he realized that he had to head west.  The move to the south coast
of Bulgaria is a sign to Russia that Turkey sincerely wants to make amends.
Luckily for him and Turkey, Italy and Austria don't seem to be up to the
challenge.
<P>
My guesses on the builds (not that I was even close in 1901):
Austria:   A Tri;
Germany:   F Kie;
Italy:     Removes F Wes;
Turkey:    F Smy, A Ank.
<P><dt><b>Spring 1903 Movement (23 July)</b>
<dd>I tried the same moves again, guessing that England will switch
things around.  No luck; I'm falling behind in the progress of this game (to
Germany and Turkey).
<P><tt>
Austria: Army Rumania -> Serbia.<br>
Austria: Army Galicia -> Budapest.<br>
Austria: Fleet Venice CONVOY Italian Army Piedmont -> Venice.<br>
Austria: Army Albania SUPPORT Army Rumania -> Serbia.  (*dislodged*)<br>
Austria: Army Trieste SUPPORT Army Rumania -> Serbia.</tt>
<P>
Well, these moves are very defensive.  He's going to lose Rumania and
certainly communicated an intent to leave Venice (that's what that bogus
convoy is for).  Does this mean he's going to move Ven-Adr in the fall?
Or perhaps Tri-Alb, Ven-Tri.  What ever his choice, he'd better hope that
the Italian is very forgiving of that Venetian stab.
<P><tt>
England: Army Norway HOLD.<br>
England: Fleet North Atlantic Ocean -> Irish Sea.  (*bounce*)<br>
England: Fleet North Sea -> English Channel.  (*bounce*)<br>
England: Fleet Edinburgh -> North Sea.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
Dang-nab-it, he guessed right again.  Things look stagnant in this area
of the board, but I only have to guess right to throw things in my favor.
England will lose Norway this turn, I presume.  I'm surprised that he's
let that fleet in Edi stay where it is.
<P><tt>
France: Army Gascony -> Burgundy.<br>
France: Army Belgium HOLD.<br>
France: Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean -> Irish Sea.  (*bounce*)<br>
France: Fleet Brest -> English Channel.  (*bounce*)<br>
France: Army Marseilles SUPPORT Italian Army Piedmont.  (*void*)<br>
France: Fleet Spain (south coast) -> Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  (*bounce*)</tt>
<P>
Next turn, I'll try MAO-Eng, S by Bre, and Spa-MAO.  This prevents him
from moving to MAO (which would be very bad for me) and gives me a
protected convoy to the English mainland.  However, it land-locks the
fleet in Brest and reduces it to a supporting role.  Gas-Bur is only
to set up Bur-Bel when Bel convoys to the British Isles.
<P><tt>
Germany: Army Holland HOLD.<br>
Germany: Army Munich HOLD.<br>
Germany: Fleet Denmark -> Skagerrak.<br>
Germany: Army Berlin HOLD.<br>
Germany: Fleet Sweden SUPPORT Fleet Kiel -> Denmark.<br>
Germany: Fleet Kiel -> Denmark.</tt>
<P>
Germany's doing very well with a conservative gameplan.  I assume he'll
order Den-Nth, Ska-Nor, Swe S Ska-Nor.  This dislodges the English army
and get him another build.  I fear that he might build an army in Kie and
start thinking about moving against me; I hope he'll order Ber-Pru in
the fall and build A (or F) Ber.
<P><tt>
Italy: Army Tunis -> Tyrrhenian Sea -> Rome.<br>
Italy: Army Piedmont -> Venice.  (*bounce*)<br>
Italy: Fleet Tyrrhenian Sea CONVOY Army Tunis -> Rome.</tt>
<P>
About all he could do.  Perhaps Austria is sincere about moving F Ven;  I'd
still order the attack with a support.  I'm considering ordering Mar-Pie,
so Italy won't get that build back if Austria ordered F Ven to Hold, but I
want Italy to continue east after he gets the build, not turn around and
attack me again.
<P><tt>
Russia: Army Sevastopol -> Rumania.<br>
Russia: Army Warsaw -> Galicia.<br>
Russia: Fleet Black Sea SUPPORT Army Sevastopol -> Rumania.<br>
Russia: Fleet Livonia -> St Petersburg (south coast).</tt>
<P>
The white bear gets moving after all!  He should be able to hold Rum and
get a build.  An R/T alliance looks like a reality after all, and Russia
is probably ecstatic about it.  War-Gal, followed by A War?  or does he
need to build A Mos to protect StP (hint:  never let StP be captured)?
<P><tt>
Turkey: Army Greece SUPPORT Army Serbia -> Albania.<br>
Turkey: Army Constantinople -> Bulgaria.<br>
Turkey: Fleet Bulgaria (south coast) -> Aegean Sea.<br>
Turkey: Army Serbia -> Albania.<br>
Turkey: Army Ankara -> Constantinople.<br>
Turkey: Fleet Smyrna -> Eastern Mediterranean.</tt>
<P>
I don't like the growth of Turkey and I don't like two Turkish fleets
in the Mediterranean.  I need a strong Italy to help hold Turkey in place,
that's why I'm not going to interfere with A Pie.  I think Austria is
on the decline and R/T is about to pounce -- I just hope my attack on
England doesn't take so long that Turkey is off my southern shore before
I'm ready for him.

As expected, Austria's being attacked from both sides.  He's desparately
appealing to Russia for a treaty, but it will fall on deaf ears.  He should
have never stabbed at Venice....

Norway will get to retreat to StP -- why Russia left it unguarded is
beyond me.  That army is now completely out of the way; he won't be able
to protect it or capture anything else with it (unless Russia lets him
have Moscow, too).
<P>
France: Army Burgundy HOLD.<br>
France: Army Belgium HOLD.<br>

<P>
Third time's a charm, and I finally get into the English Channel.  I
would have much rather kept him out of the Irish Sea, but I needed to
get some pressure on the English Isles before Turkey makes it to my
southern shore.

He's up to seven centers and looking strong.  He didn't move Berlin,
though, and I don't really want him to build another fleet.  I wish he'd
move east, but I don't think he will yet.

Back to four supply centers -- he needs to get ready for Turkey, so building
a fleet in Naples is imperative.  By moving Pie-Vie (rather than Rom-Ven),
he all but assures me that there won't be a second attack on France.  This
is good news indeed, since I plan to move further north.

Gack!  StP-Bot?  "Here, Mr. Prime Minister, please!  Take St. Petersburg, I
don't want it!"  I wouldn't mind a Russia that could keep Turkey in check
(maybe with an I/R alliance), but I haven't seen many brilliant moves out
of the Russian yet, so I don't expect it.
<P><tt>

Turkey: Fleet Aegean Sea SUPPORT Fleet Eastern Mediterranean -> Ionian Sea.<br>
Turkey: Army Albania -> Serbia.<br>

<P>
Getting into Ionian is a crusher -- Italy has to guard against a convoy
now, and Tunis is exposed.  Taking back Serbia is nice -- maybe he and
Russia will reach some consensus about how to divide the evaporating
Austrian.
<P>
Austria's dislodged army was destroyed; its fleet will probably retreat
to the Adriatic.  England has nothing to lose by retreating to Stp, since
the Russian isn't helping him out against France and Germany.
<P>
Right now, here's how I rank the powers:
Turkey, Germany, France, Russia, Italy, England, Austria.  Russia is
only that high because of cooperation by Turkey (and collapse of the A/I
alliance).  If Germany plays it right, he could really hurt me just as
I go after England in force -- I'll have to be wary of that.  Turkey
is first mainly because of his position -- expanding, with a second-fiddle
ally and two enemies in disarray.
<P><dt><b>Fall 1903 Retreat (25 July)</b>
<dd>Austria disbanded his fleet, and, as predicted, England
retreated his army to St. Petersburg.
Now that I think about it, though, I don't think England's retreat to StP was
a very good idea for him.  Sure he saves the army from disbandment, but
it can't help him at all from that position and will likely fall in the
near future.  He is in desparate need of an ally and Russia might have
been the only option.  Well, he can forget about that now.
<P>
Austria's disband means he is trading the fleet for an army, which is probably
wise.  I don't think it will make a difference in a few years, though.
<P><dt><b>Winter 1903 Adjustment (26 July)</b>

Italy:     Builds a fleet in Naples.

</pre>
I'm really torn right now about how to attack England.  I could
try to convoy Bel to either Wales or London, but I really doubt it
would lead to a captured SC this fall.  I could focus on improving
my position by ordering Eng-Iri, S by MAO, and Bre-Eng (which might
get bounced).  I don't know what the German fleets are going to do --
I have to assume at least two of them are heading towards North Sea.
It's possible that England will be dislodged from that space and be
able to put fleets in London, Lvp, and Yorkshire.
<P>
Right now, I need to consider the more puzzling problem of Germany,
who is growing faster than I am and already has four fleets on the
board.  This means she'll want a piece of England and will be poised
to attack France after that.  I have to prepare for what will likely
be a conflict with Germany immediately following the conquest of
England.  Furthermore, I must capture London and Liverpool -- I can't
allow Germany to take the lion's share.
<P>
For the moment, I'm leaning towards a convoy.  But I don't think I
can afford another parried attack by the Brit.
<P>
In other news, it looks like Italy will fight Turkey after all.  Too
bad for him that it didn't start two years ago, when Italy had all the
aces in his hand.  He and Austria will have to cooperate, and cooperate
perfectly, to survive.
<P>
Russia is toast, once again.  England can move to Moscow and camp there
for the forseeable future.  Geez, what a boneheaded move that allowed
England to retreat to Stp.

Iri-Lvp, supported by Wal would secure that SC, followed by Eng-Lon, supported

support one another.  England could order Nwg-Cly or Nwg-NAO, which would
force me to protect the fleet that takes Lvp, but I don't think he will.
F MAO could move to NAO to block this, but I'm still behind Germany and
need to take a chance to get caught up (especially since the German is

Ah, this is good news.  Now I'm assured of keeping Lvp and Lon and picking
up two builds this fall.  I'm thinking about MAO-Naf, to help Italy in
the south.  It's tricky -- I want him to think that I'm coming to help
him, not fight him.  Of course, if Germany derives this fact, he'll
realize that he's my next target.
<P>
Actually, I'm not totally convinced that I should attack Germany.  But he
has four fleets, and I have to believe he's not going to let them rust
from disuse.  So how do I proceed?  England will have to disband two units
this winter, but it isn't clear whether or not he'll hold onto that army.
That means he might have one fleet or two defending Edinburgh, and we don't
know which (of Cly and Nwg) he might keep.  I'd bet he keeps Nwg, since
Germany can't easily break Edi S Nwg, Nwg S Edi.  Of course, keeping Nwg
means giving up A Mos, which means Stp can move to Bar and support the
attack on Nwg -- oh well, how much defense can you put up with two fleets?
<P>
I need to get into position to (a) protect Belgium and London, (b) keep
Edinburgh from falling to Germany or take it myself.  I'm hoping that
England orders Mos S War to prevent Germany from gaining another SC.
<P>
For the fall, I think I'll try MAO-Eng, Lon-Nth (to prevent a potential
Hol-Bel, S by Nth, Mun-Bur from succeeding), Wal-Yor, Lvp H, Bel H,
Bur S Bel.  Then build F Bre, A Mar, maybe?  moving Mar-Pie-Tyr would
help a lot.  This would depend on what Turkey and Germany do in the fall,

</pre>
Germany has gone abandoned and been replaced by a much more experienced
player.  At first, I thought this might be an advantage for me, since he
might not be as ready for my attack as the first German.  His build in
Berlin is certainly not very threatening to me, yet.  Time will tell,
though, if he's going to be a fierce competitor.  His HoF record shows
that he has a good bit of experience (more than me), but not much success.
<P>
A quick check of the board shows that I have a guessing game in Belgium.
Germany *could* attack with Nth-Eng, Hol-Bel, Ruh S Hol-Bel, and Mun-Bur.
This would break any potential supports from Eng and Bur and leave Belgium
dislodged (and considering my Par-Pic, destroyed).
<P>
However, I could order Bel-Ruh, S by Bur and Lon-Nth, S by Eng, which would
be a strong counterstrike to that attack.  Gaining Nth would be
enough compensation for the supply center, in my opinion, especially
since I could take Edi if I wanted to, or I could try to hold onto Nth
(against all three German fleets, though) or push into Ska or Hel, just
to drive the Kraut back.
<P>
Germany also has an opportunity in Burgundy, if he guesses that I might
move from Par-Pic.  I could attack with Mun and Ruh and open a hole in
my defenses.
<P>
The only positive from this is that he can't do all these things at once.
I just have to outguess him -- risk a loss to make a gain.  I'll leave
Bur open by ordering Par-Pic.  Bre-MAO will travel to NAO in the fall,
to help form my naval front in the north.  Lvp travels freely to Cly, if
I can safely predict England's move (or lack thereof) at this point.
Lon and Eng present the sticky problem.  Lon-Nth, S by Eng?  or Eng S Bel?
I think Nor-Nwg is a safe bet, but Stp must hold (England is still in
Moscow and could move in at any time).  Will Hol S Nth?  Or will
Hol-Bel, S by Ruh.  Mun-Bur is a given, so Bur's support is useless --
maybe I'll try Bur-Ruh, just to break a support that might be coming
from Ruh.  But if Germany orders Ruh-Bel, S by Hol, Nth-Eng, Mun-Bur,
then Ruh AND Mun succeed, I take Ruh, but he can take Mar or Par in the
fall and is behind my lines.
<P>
If Germany goes after Belgium, it will probably be with F Hol, since
any other attack would leave that fleet behind the battle line.  I hope
that attacking Nth and Ruh will be enough to prevent the fall of
Belgium.  I'll make a bid for Nth with Lon-Nth, supported by Eng.  If all
goes well, I'll have F MAO, F Cly, A Yor, F Nth, F Eng, A Bel, A Pic,
A Bur to match up against his F Nwg, F Den (probably), F Stp, F Hol,
A Ruh, A Mun.  In the fall, I hold Belgium, take Edinburgh (well, maybe),

I'm very happy to take Edinburgh.  There's a small hole in my

probably have to build another fleet in Brest, because Germany's
going to build a fleet (in Kiel, I suspect).  With fleets in NAO,
Edinburgh, London, English, and Brest, I'll have a good chance of
taking the North Sea.  And once I do that, good things happen.

the North Sea; I'd like to try to retake Belgium and keep it.  I'm still
between a rock and a hard place.  Italy will likely disband F Tys this
winter, which means Turkey will reach Mar/Spa by 1909.  I hoped to steal
a center from Germany this year and the next to fortify that side; now it
seems highly unlikely.  Perhaps I'll try to take Belgium back while
making peace with Germany.  Perhaps Nwg C Mun-Swi would do the trick,

He has five fleets surrounding North Sea.  Methinks that I'll won't have

I'd order Ven-Rom, Apu-Nap and take one or both.  Ion will probably
support Tunis, but I'd consider supporting Apu-Nap, or even trying Ion-Nap,
Aeg-Ion, Apu-Rom, S by Ven.  I actually like the latter one quite a bit.
<P>
I'm going to do my best now to speed up the death of Italy and the
growth of Turkey (well, short of handing him my SC's).  Germany must
realize that attacking me will not win him the game.  Soon, Turkey will
have 11 SC's, plus whatever he can take from Russia (perhaps Budapest,

I've protected everything and taken Norway as I needed to, but I
did so at the expense of my southern fortification.  This may have
been a big mistake on my part, since Turkey might be able to press
the issue and take Mar and Spain and push to 18 centers.  Hopefully,
Germany will pull back (as will I) and we'll dig in against Turkey.
It won't be so easy, though, because he has a fleet in NAO and I
have a fleet in Norway.  I'm hoping that he'll order NAO-Nwg and we
can get this straigtened out before it's too late.  No-press games
can get very tangled....

Germany will be able to dislodge Norway in the fall, and I'll disband
rather than retreat to Stp to show my non-agression.  I hope he reads it

My fleet has three places to retreat, including St. Petersburg, but I
will disband it instead.
This is the best news I've received in a while, actually.  I can make
my intentions crystal clear to the German by <b>not</b> taking StP.  This helps
set up a detente in the north, so we can focus on the south.  Brest-Gascony
is another hint to Germany -- I don't care to fight him anymore.  Let's

Of course Germany has to stop  Turkey.  I think we can take back Munich;
losing Ukraine (no retreats) doesn't hurt that bad.  If we can stop the
Turk's expansion at Tun, Rom, Nap, Ven, Tri, Vie, Bud, Ser, Gre, Bul, Rum, Sev, Con, Ank, Smy, War, and Mos --
that would only be 17 centers.  Germany has enough fleets to hold Ber and
StP; I can help him hold onto Munich.

I guessed right about which German army would attack Munich, although
it didn't really matter.  My pieces are in place; I can hold off
Turkey indefintely with Mar H, Spa(sc) H, Bur S Mar, Gas S Spa, MAO S Spa,
Eng S MAO.  Unfortunately, Munich may need help, so I should try to
either slip a unit into Por (freeing Gas to support Mar and Bur to support
Munich) or move an army into Ruhr.  Easier said than done.

Germany wants to hold onto Stp, Ber, and Mun.  He'll lose Warsaw in
the fall, but he can retreat to Pru.  F Nor and A Stp can hold onto
Stp indefinitely.  Armies in Mun, Ber, Sil, and Pru form a good defense,
but Turkey could break it with War-Pru, Tyr-Mun, Gal-Sil.  Then Boh
could support either Gal-Sil or Tyr-Mun, and if he guessed right (with
Ber S either Sil or Mun), he'd destroy an army.  If he takes Munich,
he wins the game; if he takes Silesia, he wins quicky thereafter.
So I need to count on Bur S Mun.  I'd better try to get Bre-Por.  Only
Gas need support Spa (I don't know why I thought it needed two supports),
so I'll have to order Bur S Mar this season, one last time.  Hopefully,
Turkey won't take Mun and War both this season and win outright.

Germany loses Warsaw (removing the Norway fleet) and has decided to occupy
Livonia and Prussia instead.
It's a good thing I freed up Burgundy to support Munich.
Germany should order Mun S Sil, Sil S Mun, Pru S Mun, Lvn S Stp, Stp S Lvn.
He doesn't even need his four fleets -- good work by the German in
setting up an even better stalemate line than I anticipated (I'll admit,
I'm no expert in the area).  He has to hope that Bur S Mun -- and it will.

Turkey:    Builds an army in Constantinople.
Turkey:    Builds an army in Smyrna.
Turkey keeps growing, this time building two armies, in Constantinople and
Smyrna.  He can now attack Mar with a force of two, but Gas S Mar.  He can
attack Spa with a force of two and cut supports from Mar and MAO, but Por S
Spa.  He can attack MAO with two, but Eng S MAO.
He can attack Mun with a force of two and cut support from Sil, but
Bur S Mun.  He can attack Sil with three and cut Munich's support, so he
could take Sil and push that army to Berlin.
Okay, given that he does that, he can attack Mun with three, but Ber and
Bur S Mun.  He could attack Pru with two, but Bal S Pru.  He could attack
Lvn with two, but Bot S Lvn.  So he can take Silesia, but he can't get
another SC.  Looks like the three-way draw I've been working towards
since 1906, back in August....

Germany's taken a slightly different stance on the stalemate line:  he

Oh brother.  Germany tries to retake Silesia, for reasons known only to
himself.  Turkey takes Munich, game over.
<P>
I don't understand this maneuver, and it's particularly hard to swallow
first thing on a Monday morning.  I don't know if he didn't see the
stalemate line and still thought he was fighting for his life, or what.
Oh well, that was a simple three-way draw that he tossed away for both of
us.  Damn.
</dl><P>
Anyway, congratulations to Turkey on the win -- I give him full credit
for taking the opportunity when it was given to him.  From the start of
this game, he played solidly and made sure that he never had a serious
threat from any direction.  He always seemed to have the superior
numbers against his foes.  He also played the Russian alliance perfectly;
never letting the Russian have any real autonomy, but giving him enough
reason to keep helping out Turkey.
<P>
My review of my own play is that I did an okay job; I got off to a
rotten start, since Italy attacked me in 1902, just as I was starting
an English offensive.  By the time England was destroyed in 1905, Germany
was dominant in the north and Turkey was meeting no resistance in the
east.  After 1902, I never rated myself higher than third.  I played for
a three-way draw from 1905 on, and that's what I <b>should</b> have gotten.
Oh well; it's just a game and the wounds have already healed.
