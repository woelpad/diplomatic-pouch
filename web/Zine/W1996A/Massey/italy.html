<H1 align=center>The Italian End of Game Statement</H1>
<HR>
Congratulations to Turkey for an impressive win! Many thanks to the GM and
the other players. Although I didn't have much of a say in the game, it was
fun.
<P>  
I just read France's comments. Very accurate
reporting! It is a nice idea to make notes every turn. My opening was as
standard as they go. Indeed I intended a Lepanto. So why didn't I?
<P> 
Austria started with a safety first opening, where you want him to go for
Greece. Turkey opened anti-Russian, and he wasn't the only one. So a
"juggernaut" R/T didn't seem very realistic. Furthermore, Turkey decided to
build an army, not a fleet. And finally, France decided to build a fleet in
Marseilles. France had three new builds; he didn't need to build in
Marseilles. Why didn't he wait a year and build it in Brest if he wanted
peace with me?
<blockquote><i>
French response:
Good point.  I suppose I'd have sent a better message to you if I'd
chosen not to build that F Mar.  But I really wanted to hammer England
early (no offense to the Englishman) and wanted to set up Mar-Spa/sc-MAO.
I took a risk that you'd overlook the build and it didn't pay off.
Next time, I'll probably waive the build and try to squeeze it into
Brest the following year.
</i></blockquote>
To me this didn't look like the most ideal start for a Lepanto. And then I
was surfing the net and found some articles from Scott Kauzerlich on playing
Italy. In short, this is his advice: "shore up the west, plug that gap at
Gibraltar, and then turn to those bickering eastern neighbors with terrible
vengeance, all while ensuring that no one power gets too huge in the West".
So I headed west.
<P>  
At first, this strategy seemed to fall in place pretty well. England was also
battling France, and France would need fleets on both front lines. Austria
offered peace to Turkey (so much for Lepanto aspirations from that side) and
that A/T alliance could have a promising start with the southern SC's of
Russia. My turning west could be an encouragement for the two to do so.
But then Austria sailed into Venice. This was unbalancing both of us. And I
bet England wasn't happy with this development either. I had no choice but to
take my units home. Turkey came out fine of course. By the time Austria and I
had rearranged our units, Turkey was already stronger than both of us
together. I tried to slow Turkey down and waited for support from France. And
waited, and waited....
<P>
Losing Tunis wasn't very important from a strategical point of view. Or was
it? Parking an army there is not going to influence the battle over the
Ionian. It showed Turkey's eagerness to convoy, and I am happy to have
prevented the first two landings in Apulia.
<P> 
After 1907 I had only two fleets left. Of course I could sit still and lose
them one at a time. I decided to move to the awfully empty west for my only
chance on more. But France defended her coasts just in time, and I ended up
losing my fleets one at a time anyway. By 1910 Italy was down and out. My
apologies to the Italians.
<P>  
Once again, thanks for the game!
