<H1 align=center>The German End of Game Statement</H1>
<HR>
This is the first 'diplomacy' message I will have sent out, as per the game
rules (at least to the players).
<P>
I <b>knew</b> I should have supported Munich with the Berlin unit instead of
taking Silesia, but I made a stupid and unnecessary risk.
<P>  
It just proves my ineptitude.  ;)
<P>   
My other major mistake was fighting France too long, letting Turkey (or as I
liked to sometimes call him in my messages to the master, Turnkey) grow too
powerful to keep him staved off.
<P>
Anyway, that's my 2 pfennig worth.
<P>
In the preface to his EOG, France asked, "who wasn't setting draw during the
last couple of seasons?  Was it Germany or Turkey?  It looked for all the
world like Turkey was resigned to a 3-way."  For my part, I set draw after the
master mentioned it.
<P>
France also wrote:  "Germany has gone abandoned and been replaced by a much
more experienced player.  At first, I thought this might be an advantage for
me." --Ha!
<p>
He also wrote, "His HoF record shows that he has a good bit of experience
(more than me), but not much success."  This shows that (despite my experience)
I'm a <b>newbie</b>!
<P>
France noted after my first Fall moves: "Pretty darn conservative for fall
moves.  He's letting me catch up.  He'll be able to munch on a few more SC's
in the east though -- I have no such opportunity in the west." I had looked at
the history, and had seen that it was basically F/G/T.  I wanted to be in
position to defend against either (or both) of you, and not attacking you
(for the time being), but yet staying in position to attack, I felt, was
the best decision.
<P>
Later, France wondered why I retreated from the Norwegian Sea.  Strike it up
to big, fat, stupid newbie mistakes.
<P>
Speaking of the Norwegian, France soon thereafter appealed for peace using a
fleet there while simultaneously taking Belgium from me by force.  In his EOG,
he wondered how I would read that.  I was quite confused by the signal sent by
the fleet.  When I saw that, I thought, "That's odd," and the mixed signal
made me dismiss it altogether.
<P>
When France noted, in his EOG, that Turkey had been passed by me for the spot
of endgame leader, it is true that at that point, I thought I was on the way
to victory.
<P>
After a particular (1908) build season, France said that he thought at that
point (because of my choice of an army build in Berlin) that I was gearing up
to fight Turkey.  Well, at that point, I was still looking to attack France,
but felt my five fleets would be adequate.  I just needed defensive strength
in the east.
<P>
France -- when I dislodged you in Norway and you disbanded rather than retreat
to St. Petersburg, it was this show, in and of itself, that showed (to me) your
intention to hold off Turkey.
<P>
At the end of the game, I actually wasn't trying for a stalemate line with
Munich (though I know in retrospect that I should have been).  It just seemed
to me to be the place to go with the forces I had available.  The stalemate
line as France pointed it out in his EOG would have worked...had I had the
grey matter to make it work...which I have clearly demonstrated in this game
to be non-existent.
<P>
My sincere condolences to France for my blundering mistakes constantly
throughout the game.  It really <b>should</b> have been a 3-way.
<blockquote><i>
French response: Don't sweat it; I wasn't angry for more than a day (wink).
Seriously, I don't take HoF points as seriously as some others do.  It leaves
me with a bad taste to finish a well-played game with a loss.  But hell, the
same sort of thing is happening in another game that I'm playing right
now, so I'm getting used to it.
<P> 
You might want to be more conscious of stalemate lines in the endgame of
future Dip games, though.  Other people might be quite furious about that
sort of an ending.  Once it became clear that France and Germany wanted to
contain Turkey, that should have been the only goal.  Just something to keep in
mind for the future.
</i></blockquote>
Yeah, I've definitely learned something from this one.  I'm glad that you're
not angry with me.  I only play games once in a blue moon, so it probably
won't happen again.  I'll just get smashed before anything can happen.  ;)
<P> 
The main lesson that I've learned is the one you mentioned in your response;
be more conscious of stalemate lines.  I will definitely do that.
<P> 
Anyway, I hope I can be an ally of yours in the future.  ;)  (I wouldn't
want to go against you.)
