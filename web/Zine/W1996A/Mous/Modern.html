The Fourth Reich
</H1>
<H2 align=center>Germany in the Modern Variant</H2>

<em>Vincent Mous</em>
</H3>
<H3>Brief Introduction</H3>
Welcome to the fifth article in my continuing series about the Modern
variant. In the <a href=../../W1995A/Mous/Modern.html>first article</a>
you got an introduction to the modern
variant, as well as information on how to get started playing it. In the other
three articles I discussed the opening strategies for
<a href=../../S1996M/Mous/Modern2.html>Britain</a>,
<a href=../../S1996R/Mous/egypt.html>Egypt</a>, and
<a href=../../F1996M/Mous/Modern.html>France</a>.
<P>
This time we are looking at the new powerhouse in western Europe,
reunified Germany. With the capital moving from Bonn to Berlin, Time Magazine
has called the new Germany the Berlin Republic and the old one the Bonn
Republic. Who knows what the Berlin Republic will bring to Europe -- will it
pursue European unity, or fall the way of the Weimar Republic and give way
to a Fourth Reich? Well, one way or another, you may soon find yourself as
the leader of this new country as Europe disintegrates around you in a game
of modern diplomacy?
<P>
First things first, though. Since last issue, a few more modern games have
ended. Turkey, led by Christopher Hack, swept to another solo victory in
<a href=lie2me.html><tt>lie2me</tt></a> (partial press, no-NMR), making it
two in a row after Robert Shepard's victory in
<a href=../../F1996M/Mous/liarliar.html><tt>liarliar</tt></a>. Russia, under the brilliant
command of
Anthony Nichols, then conquered Europe in an impressive blitzkrieg,
doubling from 14 to 29 centers in four years, before coasting to victory in
<a href=day2day.gif><tt>day2day</tt></a> (no press, no-NMR). An honorable
mention goes to Rick Desper who
played France and ended up in second place with the best showing until then
for that country.
<P>
Russia then participated in two three-way draws. In
<a href=euro95.html><tt>euro95</tt></a> (no press,
no-NMR), the longest lasting modern game --- it finished in 2023, the spoils
were shared between Egypt, Turkey and Russia, led by Eric Moore, Joseph W.
Carl, Jr., and Dean Gordon/Dave Kleiman respectively. The final position in
that game is interesting, with Egypt holding North Africa, Spain, France
and Italy, but not Egypt. Russia's other three-way draw was in
<a href=despair.html><tt>despair</tt></a> (no
press, NMR), along with France and Italy. Congratulations to Michael Walsh,
Kent Liljegren, and Ian York for leading these countries to victory in this
fast-paced game.
<P>
Just as I finished writing this article, the game <tt>cairo</tt> finished
in a four-way draw
between Spain, Poland, Italy, and Turkey. These are the first
draw participations for both Spain and Poland. You'll have to wait until
the next article to see the end game map, summary and end-of-game
statements for this one.
<P>
For those of you who want a challenge, try winning or drawing with a
power that has not been able to do so yet. The rankings until now are:

And now, having updated you on the state of the current Modern games,
let's move on to take an in-depth look at Germany.

By the way, I am still looking for comments about strategy and opening
names for the remaining countries (everything except Britain, Egypt, France and
Germany), so feel free to send your thoughts and suggestions to me at
<a href=mailto:vim2@rocketmail.com>vim2@rocketmail.com</a>.
The next article will be on Italy, so I am especially interested in your
thoughts on it.
<H3>List of Openings for Germany</H3>
What follows is a list of the different openings used for Germany in the
Modern games that have been played until now, as well as a few more that
may be of interest. As I am the GM of many Modern games, and an observer in
many more, I asked players for their opinions on strategies for the various
powers in the modern variant, but also to propose some openings and to
suggest a name for them -- the winning name and the name of the person
suggesting it appears along with every opening.
<dl>
<dt><H4>Neutral Openings</H4>
<dd><dl><dt><strong>Pax Germanica</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.	(Baltic Variant)<br>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Hamburg. 	(Coastal Variant)<br>
Germany: Army Munich HOLD.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Holland.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
This is probably the most neutral opening for Germany -- especially the
Coastal Variant. Germany tries to pick up Belgium, Holland, and Denmark. The
move to Bornholm Sea may alarm Russia a bit, but since Germany didn't move
to Denmark, Russia will easily be convinced that Denmark is the
destination.
<p><dt><strong>Eurocracy</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin, No Order Processed.<br>
Germany: Army Munich, No Order Processed.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg, No Order Processed.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt, No Order Processed.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Okay, I was wrong -- <b>this</b> is the most neutral opening!
<p><dt><strong>Lebensraum (Nate Johnston)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.	(Baltic Variant)<br>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Hamburg. 	(Coastal Variant)<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Austria.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Holland.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Here, Germany pushes towards all neutral SCs, trying to get some breathing
space. This is neutral, because Germany doesn't concentrate on anyone. If
Italy has claimed Austria, the move may be seen as hostile. Gives a chance
at Austria in addition to the Lowlands and Denmark.
</dl>
<dt><H4>Alliance Building Openings</H4>
<dd><dl><dt><strong>Axis (Ian York)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Hamburg.<br>
Germany: Army Munich SUPPORT Italian Army Milan -> Austria.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Holland.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Saxony.	(Bavarian Variant)<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.	(Rhine Variant)<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Ian York points out that "the aim is to gain a strong alliance with
Italy without offending potential allies in Britain, France, and Russia."
<p><dt><strong>Franco-German Accord</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.<br>
Germany: Army Munich SUPPORT French Army Lyon -> Switzerland.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Holland.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Rick Desper notes this as "a possible opening for allying with France."
</dl>
<dt><H4>General Offensive Openings</H4>
<dd><dl><dt><strong>Anschluss (Ian York)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Austria.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Holland.	(Lowlands Variant)<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Denmark.	(Baltic Variant)<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Saxony.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Ian York says,
"A strong push east might be interesting, but doesn't seem to offer many
rewards. It might start with an Anschluss of Austria? This might alienate
Italy, Poland, and Russia, so France and Britain would be good allies."
<P>
Nate Johnson, though, notes that he "can't think of a good application,
unless Balkan dominance is your goal. Probably good if in concert with
Italy and Ukraine, and if England and France are friendly."
<p><dt><strong>Atlantic Wall</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Ruhr.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Holland.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Hamburg.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
This opening sends all your forces towards
your Atlantic coast. The openings allows Germany to try sending Holland
into the North Sea in case Britain moves out, but still take the
center by moving the army in Hamburg in behind the fleet.
<P>
Says Stephen Breininger,
"This aggressive opening leaves your southern flank open! but it might work
to gain the upper hand on Britain. You lose the chance to support your
allies into Switzerland and Austria, but if Italy and France bounce in
Switzerland, you're all set."
<p><dt><strong>The Keg (Simon Withers)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Austria.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Denmark.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Saxony.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
This opening seeks to take control of both Scandinavia and Austria. As
such, it is likely to offend Russia, Britain, and Italy. Only one center,
Denmark, is guaranteed.
<P>
Simon Withers call this a "good second choice for an opening, sending both
fleets towards Sweden, but instead of moving on Holland bringing two armies
to bear against Austria. This opening would be used when you fear a hostile
Italy, and also can be turned into an assault on Poland (which, in my
opinion, is not a good thing to do)."
<p><dt><strong>Vaterland</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Austria.	(Austrian Variant)	<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Switzerland.	(Swiss Variant)		<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Denmark.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Another opening in which Germany goes for Sweden. Germany's power is
diffused, though, as he also goes for German-speaking Austria or Switzerland --
probably against the wishes of Italy or France.
</dl>
<dt><H4>Anti-French Openings</H4>
<dd><dl><dt><strong>Western Offensive (Michael Walsh)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm	(Baltic Variant)<br>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Hamburg.	(Dutch and Danish Variants)<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Switzerland.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Denmark.	(Danish Variant)<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Holland.	(Dutch and Baltic Variants)<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
This is anti-French unless France has offered to give up Switzerland,
which would be unusual. In such a case, the move to Ruhr is both defensive
and allows a supported move into Alsace in the fall or an attack on
Belgium. The two fleets go after neutrals to get some builds. The Dutch
Variant gives a better chance at Belgium, in exchange for a lesser chance
at Denmark.
<P>
Ian York notes that "The Frankfurt to Ruhr move is good if you are unsure
of France, or if you want to stake a claim on Belgium."
<P>
"If I'm going after France," Michael Walsh writes, "this would be my opening.
Concede the possibility of losing Denmark to a bounce in favor of securing
Belgium with the support from Holland.  Bounce the French (or Italians) in
Switzerland as many times as necessary to deny them the extra build early."
<p><dt><strong>Schleiffen Plan (Nate Johnston)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.	(Naval Variant)<br>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Hamburg.	(Coastal Variant)<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Alsace.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Holland.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Nate Johnston comments that "this would be fairly effective in securing the
Lowlands, and in an optimal scenario you might even secure the Lowlands,
Denmark, and a French center
before anyone knew it.  You must rely on the good faith of Poland, however,
who will probably be occupied with either Russia or Ukraine at this point."
<p><dt><strong>Rhine Charge</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Alsace.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Denmark.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Germany launches an offensive against both Russia and France. If Munich
makes it to Alsace, Ruhr will have to defend Munich from Switzerland.
Otherwise, Ruhr can take Belgium or be supported into Alsace.
</dl>
<dt><H4>Anti-Italian Opening</H4>
<dd><dl><dt><strong>Alpine Gambit (Dean Gordon)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Hamburg.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Austria.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Holland.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Munich	<br>
</tt></blockquote>
A strong move on Austria, including the backup to hold it or attack
Switzerland. The fleets probably pick up two centers. Italy might be
offended, but other powers will not.
<P>
Dean Gordon calls this opening "Pro-Poland and possibly Anti-British."
</dl>
<dt><H4>Anti-Russian Openings</H4>
<dd><dl><dt><strong>Bismarck</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Ruhr.		(Rhine Variant)<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Austria.	(Austrian Variant)<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Denmark.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Hamburg.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
This opening, while not pro-British, is anti-Russian as it attempts to
take Sweden. This is a strong
opening as Germany could possibly hold Belgium, Holland, Denmark and Sweden
at the end of 1995. The Austrian Variant might be seen as aggressive by
Italy.
<P>
Writes Mark Friedman, "a pretty unconventional move for Germany!? The idea
is simple: don't
antagonize the French.  Antagonize the British.  I don't have much faith in
this opening, but if the French
don't take a piece out of your hide, you could have the core of a nice
alliance."
<P>
Simon Withers believes that "the strongest opening for Germany would be one
that pushes with as much
might as possible into Scandinavia. My preference is to go for Holland
(with the Hamburg army) and leave the defense of the nation to the last
army and diplomacy."
<P><dt><strong>Scandinavian Squeeze (Robert Shepard)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Bornholm Sea.<br>
Germany: Army Munich SUPPORT Italian Army Milan -> Switzerland.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Denmark.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
With this opening, writes Robert Shepard, "you are in solid shape to get
three builds the opening year, letting Britain and France fight it
our for Belgium, and making the Italian a friend in the south by giving him
Switzerland. With allies like these, not to mention Spain, does France even
have a chance?"
</dl>
<dt><H4>Anti-Polish Openings</h4>
<dd><dl><dt><strong>Prussian Gambit</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Prussia.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Austria.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Denmark.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Here, Germany sends a unit in each direction. Berlin, east, Munich, south,
Hamburg, north and Frankfurt west. While it's not clear what Germany aims
to achieve, an attack on Poland seems the most likely. The fleet in Prussia
might force Poland to bring the fleet in Lithuania back to protect Gdansk,
while Prussia actually moves on to the Baltic Sea, a good position to hold
when attacking Poland. The army in Austria, together with new ones in
Frankfurt and Berlin could indeed launch a strong eastwards attack in 1996.
Still, going east is always a risk, and this gives up a possible unit for
positioning.
<P>
Rick Desper calls moving the Berlin fleet to Prussia "a very strange idea.
If it were an army, an opening to Prussia would be very strong."
<p><dt><strong>Czech Gambit (Michael Walsh)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Prussia.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Saxony.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Denmark.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Ruhr.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
Again, the fleet in Prussia might take Gdansk or position itself in the
Baltic Sea. With Italian help, the Czech Republic might indeed be taken.
<P>
"If I'm going after Poland, I'd choose this opening," says Michael Walsh.
"One of Holland or Belgium
should still be available in Fall 1995.  The Polish player may have taken
the Czech Republic for granted, and you can take it from him next turn
(with Italian help), even threatening his home SC's by Spring 1996."
<p><dt><strong>Barbarossa (Nate Johnston)</strong>
<dd><blockquote><tt>
Germany: Fleet Berlin -> Prussia.<br>
Germany: Army Munich -> Saxony.<br>
Germany: Fleet Hamburg -> Bornholm Sea.<br>
Germany: Army Frankfurt -> Berlin.<br>
</tt></blockquote>
This is an all-out attack on Poland, though Rick Desper calls it
"silly to open with Hamburg to Bornholm."

<H3>Strategy for Germany in Modern Games</H3>
As a centrally located country in Modern, Germany faces either great
opportunity or great danger.  There are four neutral SCs within a single
move of German home centers, and another three within two. That's seven
neutral SC's reachable in 1995! This means that Germany has ample room to
grow in the first year, and should easily gain three centers, perhaps even
four.
<P>
That is a great opportunity, but because of these strong initial
prospects, Germany might attract the early attention of its neighbours.  In
1996, Germany often has five direct neighbours, Italy, France, Britain and
Poland, as well as Russia in Sweden. If many of these decide to cooperate
against Germany, Germany cannot last very long. However, unlike France,
whose neighbours don't have natural enemies, there should be no problem for
Germany to find allies, because hers do.
<P>
All five neighbours bordering Germany will indeed have more pressing
matters. Poland and Russia will be fighting each other and Ukraine over
Bielorussia, Britain will be distracted by the loss of Gibraltar, France
wants to keep Spain from becoming a major threat in her back, and Italy
will be lured by the many centers in the Balkans. If one of these turns
against Germany in the early game, they can be easily held back while
Germany searches for an ally.  Spain will almost always be a willing ally
against France, Egypt or Turkey against Italy and Ukraine against Poland or
Russia. The only threat without a major counterbalance is Britain, and
Germany should either strive to keep her happy or build up a major naval
force and take her out.
<P>
I therefore think the decision on whether to build a strong navy or not
qualifies as a crucial decision for Germany has to make. This will
influence both your choice of targets and allies, as well as the direction
you will head towards until the mid-game.  A large German navy will
probably be seen as hostile by Britain and Russia, but should reassure
France and Italy of your peaceful intentions towards them. Poland will
probably be neutral towards this unless you are also sending armies towards
it. Likewise, a large inland force will put you in the good graces of both
Moscow and London, while raising worries in Paris, as well as Rome and
Warsaw to a lesser degree. Either way, the way you position your units can
still influence the perception of other powers, as a large land army
heading towards Poland is not much of a threat to France!
<P>
What is a large navy useful for? The first use of building up your navy
is to lay claim to Scandinavia. Denmark should hopefully be yours already
as it borders Hamburg and is vital for controlling the Heligoland Bight and
the Bornholm Sea, which are both essential to your defense. Sweden and
Norway are another matter. As in Standard dip, Russia will most likely have
Sweden and Britain Norway. Unlike Standard however, Russia has more units
to send to Scandinavia, and she also has an extra port in Murmansk. This
makes it more likely for there to be a war in the north between Russia and
Britain. This is good, but your objective should be to ensure that neither
of them wins!
<P>
Imagine a north totally controlled by Britain, from Murmansk through
Sweden and Norway and then west to the Atlantic. Worse, imagine one
controlled by Russia, with fleets in the Baltic Sea, Scandinavia and the
Atlantic, and probably soon armies on your eastern front as well. With so
much force to your north, the only way you can defend yourself is by
leaving your back open to whatever power is dominant in the south - not an
endearing idea!  This could very well happen if either of them controls
Scandinavia.
<P>
You should therefore make sure that neither of them gains it, either by
supporting one to hold against the other, or by making sure that you get
the extra centers.  To get Sweden and Norway, you will probably require
from three to four fleets, though you'll have an easier time if you can
convince
Britain and/or Russia to help you in. Perhaps they'll appreciate you being
a buffer between them? Either way, control of all of Scandinavia improves
your defensive position tremendously, but also gives you new offensive
capabilities, both in the west against Britain, and in the east against
Russia or Poland.  With three or four fleets already built and a surprise
build of
two more in Berlin and Hamburg, you stand a good chance of grabbing control
of the northern seas and becoming the dominant northern power.
<P>
Still, controlling Scandinavia yourself is not essential, and keeping the
balance between Russia and Britain while holding on to Denmark should be
sufficient for a start.  Instead of building a navy, you could concentrate
on building a massive land army. Either way, a minimal army force is needed
to deter France and Italy from attacking you early in the game. The
Lowlands, Holland and Belgium, play a major factor in this. Controlling the
Lowlands gives you two extra units to defend yourself with, and gives you a
nice western defense. It is also a prime position to attack France from,
whenever you may decide to do so.
<P>
The greatest concentration of centers in the game is in the Balkans.
While the Balkans are far away, and Germany cannot get any fleets there, it
is still possible to gain control of a good part of it.  The gate to the
Balkans and to the east, for Germany, is Austria. From Austria, you can
move south into Milan and Venice and then east towards Croatia and Hungary.
It may even be possible to reach and hold Serbia and Rumania. You could
also move east towards Poland and then south. Either way, with a large land
army, you can strive to control everything from Hungary to Poland to Milan
and Switzerland.
<P>
There's quite a nice concentration of centers in France as well. The key
to holding southern France if you don't have any fleets in the Med though,
is to hold Monaco, Marseilles and Piedmont. However, these are hard to
capture in the first place. How should you invade France. Control of
Belgium and Switzerland are important for an invasion of France. However,
it's much easier to attack France when he is concentrating elsewhere, on
Spain for example, than attacking him straight off the bat. France can put
up quite a defense in the early years and by the time you win the battle,
if indeed you do, other powers will have grown much stronger compared to
yourself.
<P>
What about Spain? You probably shouldn't think about Spain unless you've
taken out Britain and France already.  Spain will be a hard nut to crack
unless she is facing pressure from the Med as well. If she has time to
position herself, you can be blocked out of Spain and the Mediterranean with
only four
units: an army in Madrid supporting one in Barcelona, and a fleet in the
South Atlantic supporting one in Portugal.  Therefore, timing is essential
if you are to break through Spain and into the Mediterranean, but it is a
worthy
prize to capture. It takes a lot of skill and luck as Germany to capture
Spain and break through to the Med, but if you do, you have a very good
chance of winning.
<H3>Initial Tactics for Germany in Modern</H3>
Now we'll move on to some initial considerations for Germany. What should
you do in the first year? This comes down to a philosophical choice between
the cautious and blitzkrieg approaches, and a decision about what to do
about Switzerland and Austria.
<P>
Since Germany has many neutral centers to go for in 1995, it is possible
to concentrate on building alliances in the first year. Why go after
someone's home centers when you can get neutral centers instead. It is
usually a good policy to let others start fighting first and then pick a
side to ensure that you are on the winning side. Taking three of Denmark,
Holland, Belgium, Switzerland and Austria should be no problem at all. The
last three can also be used as bargaining chips to be given away to
Britain, France and/or Italy. Support one in, or come to an agreement about
"letting one of them have one of them." This will build up goodwill and be
useful to you. Ideally, France will start fighting Italy or Spain and
Britain will fight Spain or Russia. You can then enter one of these fights
on whatever side you choose and gain a few centers.
<P>
A blitzkrieg is not a bad idea either. After all, your neighbours
probably think you will be too busy collecting neutral centers in 1995 to
worry much about you. If you strike quickly and successfully at a
neighbour, you could cripple him sufficiently to allow you to eliminate him
in a few years while gathering the neutral SC's you missed in 1996 or 1997.
Still, a blitzkrieg holds a risk, because if it is defended against, you
will not gain as many SC's as you could have, and will end up weaker for it.
<P>
Your possible targets are all of your neighbours. Striking at Russia or
Britain is essentially a lightning strike for control of Scandinavia. If
Russia only sends one unit west in 1995, you can grab Sweden instead of him
and put an end to his Scandinavian ambitions. You could stop there or
pursue your blitzkrieg by moving a fleet into Skagerrak and trying to get
hold of the North Sea and Norway. If you go for Poland, the initial strike
will lead you through Austria and Silesia to the Czech Republic, usually
held with but one army in 1995.  An army build in Berlin and a fleet
heading for the Baltic Sea could then be the start of a successful campaign
against Poland. However, beware that by taking his place, you will then
have to deal with Ukraine and Russia!
<P>
A lightning strike on Italy actually involves sneaking into Milan via
Austria. That's because in this case you will probably want to ally with
France and let him have Switzerland. By holding Milan and Austria, you can
then strike at Venice and Croatia. Your drive south will probably stop
there, with someone else picking up the pieces in the south, but you will
have secured your southern border from the Italian threat. As for France, a
blitzkrieg is quite difficult. Still, you can move into Alsace in the
spring, forcing France to move units back to Paris and Lyon and hopefully
robbing him of neutral SC's. Meanwhile, you can support yourself into
Switzerland. France could be limited to one neutral SC, while you take 3
yourself and gain the upper hand.
<P>
As stated before, Switzerland and Austria are useful bargaining chips for
you to gain allies with. You can trade one or both to France and Italy in
exchange for help into the other. Both of them border Munich, a home SC of
yours, so they are nice to hold, but they also border two French or Italian
home SC's.  If you can manage it, take Austria and help Italy into
Switzerland. This will surely get France and Italy fighting, and Austria is
a superior position to hold, as it allows you to help yourself into the
Czech Republic, it defends Saxony, and it borders Milan, Venice and
Croatia. If you let Italy into Austria, you should consider defending your
border with armies in Munich and Saxony, or you might face a lighting
strike of your own later in the game. Switzerland is a difficult matter. If
France moves to Switzerland and Alsace, Munich is threatened, so caution
must be exerted. If you hold it, you will have to defend it constantly
against France, but it is a good staging ground for launching attacks into
France.  If you don't want war with France, it is again good to have Italy
hold it, at least initially, because Munich will be safer, and you will
turn France against Italy instead of you.  Still, if France looks like he
is going to get Switzerland anyhow, help him into it! That's a cheap way of
getting an ally!
<H3>Allies for Germany in Modern</H3>
Let's take a look at the pros and cons of the various alliances for
Germany. First is Britain. Britain is more dangerous to you in Modern than
in Standard. That's because it is very difficult for Britain to go after
France. She therefore has to choose between attacking you and Spain, and
most of her home centers are closer to you. Still, an alliance or
non-aggression pact with Britain, especially one allowing you to take
control of Scandinavia, is a very useful one, as it should allow you to
grow quickly, since it is unlikely you will face another direct attack.
Finally, an alliance with Britain gives you one more important advantage:
the possibility of stabbing Britain and quickly taking a few centers on the
British Isles! Only by moving quickly to take some British home centers
will you avoid a long and protracted war against Britain if and when you decide
to attack it. If you plan on taking Britain, better to send her down to
Spain before sailing across the North Sea.
<P>
How about an alliance with France? I believe that France can make a
strong ally for Germany. In Modern, France is more of a Mediterranean power
than an Atlantic one. She no longer has a port in Brest, and has one in
Bordeaux instead. This makes it harder for her to attack Britain. She also
has to concentrate on Spain early on. For an alliance with France to
succeed, you need to resolve the issue of security on the Switzerland to
Belgium line. You can either demilitarize either side of this, or keep
armies in Munich, Ruhr and Belgium to defend  yourself. Either way, you
should get French support into Austria as you will be heading eastwards
over land if you are allied.
<P>
A very good alliance to consider is an alliance with Italy. Italy, like
you, is a central power, and can head both east and west. This means you
can cooperate in the Balkans, or against Poland, France or even Spain.  You
wont get help from Italy against Britain, but you probably wont from France
either, however Italy is so far away by sea that it wont challenge you for
control of the Med, allowing you to block off the Atlantic around Spain.
Italy is still an overland threat to you, via Switzerland and Austria, just
as you are a threat to him, and whoever holds Austria has the upper hand as
it border 8 other SCs. Therefore, you should either hold Austria, insist
that it is demilitarized, or keep armies in Munich and Saxony, as well as
the Czech Republic, once you get that.
<P>
An alliance with Poland is usually a given at the start of a game. There
is an easy DMZ for you to establish in Prussia and Silesia, perhaps Saxony
as well. While the areas of cooperation are reduced, they are also
important. If Poland is fighting Russia, he may be willing to help you take
Sweden to rob him of  center. This would establish your domination of
Scandinavia. Likewise, for more help, or just to keep you pointed away from
him, you may get help into Austria, from which you can move into
Switzerland and Northern Italy. This is more useful in the middle game, but
Italy may well be taken by surprise. As for security vis-a-vis a Polish
ally, the DMZ mentioned above is probably the best solution, though you may
want to add Berlin in exchange for being allowed an army in Saxony.
<P>
Another very strong ally for Germany in Modern is Spain. Spain gives almost
all the advantages of an alliance with France. She can help you against
Italy and take care of any naval threat. Like France, she can also send a
bit of help against Britain. In an alliance with Spain however, your border
with Spain will not be so close to home - it will be in the middle of
France. This provides you more security, and more centers as well. This
advantage is balanced by the fact that Spain will probably have a larger
navy than France, and may decide to contest the dominance of the Atlantic,
and thus fight you over Britain later in the game. A strong eastern Med
power may deter Spain from moving north though.
<P>
Finally, all other countries on the board make good allies later in the
game. Russia and Ukraine make good allies when attacking Poland, though
Russia's Atlantic navy may pose a problem. Turkey and Egypt make good
allies in the Balkans or against Spain, Italy or the Ukraine.
<P>
Germany is a difficult power to play, but can be rewarding as well.
Define a clear objective for yourself and pursue it, only changing course
if you have to. One thing is for certain, you will never be bored while
playing Germany!
<H3>Player Comments on Germany in General</H3>
Toby Tyrell feels "that Germany is weak in no-press because he or she almost
invariably gets picked upon by Britain after a few goes.  Poland usually
follows soon after."
<P>
Nate Johnston thinks "Germany is stronger <em>vis-a-vis</em> Britain and
France in my opinion than in Standard."
<P>
Says James Gemmill: "Being in the middle, Germany <b>must</b> be active
diplomatically. It is not for the player of few words."
<P>
Rick Desper concludes that "a German victory would not appear to be easily
won."
<H3>Player Comments on German Strategy</H3>
James Gemmill believes "there's no point in opening east. The gains are
little, it leaves you
extremely vulnerable in the west, and basically indicates you are planning
an early exit from the game."
<P>
Craig Thomson agrees.  "Go west: more potential gain and less risk at your
back...also the richest area of supply centers....the fleets would head to
Holland and Denmark....an assurance to Russia of no threat to the north,
and to Britain the same message."
<P>
Ian York advocates "moving the Hamburg fleet into Holland or Denmark
(depending on your deal with
Britain), with the Berlin fleet moving into Hamburg in its wake. Britain is
most likely to
want to stay in the west in order to keep his fleets in proximity with each
other, and he'll want you to have a constructive role for German fleets in
the Baltic. Therefore giving Belgium to Britain in exchange for German
domination of Scandinavia could eliminate any conflicts of interest."
<P>
Toby Tyrell thinks that "all tactics with Germany must revolve around how to
deal with
Britain. Either come to an agreement or else try and make an alliance to
take out Britain."
<P>
Rick Desper advises that "the Berlin fleet should almost always go to
Bornholm. The only other reasonable
option is moving to Hamburg.  Fleet Hamburg can move to Denmark or Holland
in first move.  I would suggest Holland unless you to try to grab Sweden
the first year. Army Frankfurt is the interesting force.  It could move to
Saxony to try to grab the Czech Republic or maybe Austria.  It could move
to Ruhr to influence Low Countries.  It probably should move to Ruhr. The
Munich army could try for Austria or Switzerland in first move. Alternatively,
it could move to Alsace if frightened by France, or it could move to Ruhr.
It seems to be a matter of personal taste, but is also useful for
communication in a no-press game."
<P>
Alexander Woo says, "the middlegame key for Germany is that it has to be big
enough (at least
ten SC's) to handle the time when some power starts coming over
Prussia/Silesia/Saxony.
Either that, or it has to have no Western enemies at that time.  This
power could be Poland, Italy, Russia, Ukraine, or
even Turkey (in order of decreasing likelihood)."
<P>
Stephen Breininger cautions: "Avoid the 'eastern migration.' It is natural for
Poland to head east toward
Russia. Likewise, if Spain starts to push into France, then France will
retreat eastward into your homeland. I would advise that Germany would
restrain from falling eastward into Poland. When this happens,
France, Germany, and Poland will all fall, and either Spain or Britain
will pick up the lion's share of centers."
<P>
Simon Withers believes that "the power that manages to dominate the Atlantic
sets themselves up very
nicely to control the flow of the game.  Germany can and should do this, by
taking on Britain as a primary target.  Depending on how alliances work
out, Germany may end up killing France before Britain, but Britain should
almost always be the target."
<H3>Player Comments on Winning with Germany</H3>
Ian York notes that
"33 SC's is a lot to ask. So is getting fleets into the Mediterranean. So if
Germany holds the west, he requires everything from Seville through Spain,
France, the Alps, Poland, and Russia (and all that's west of it). By going east
Germany needs everything from Belgium to Venice to Serbia, through the
Ukraine and Russia, plus either Britain, France or something further south
(Italy, Iran?). So: grab the north and Poland, stab Russia or Britain, and work
from there. Simple, eh?"
<P>
Nate Johnston advises:
"Knock out France first, then either attack a weak Britain or turn east and
go for  Poland...either way, attempt to secure the north if it's owned by
the designated 'victim,' then head south for the kill!"
<P>
Here is Joseph Carl, Jr.'s four step plan:
"First, eliminate France.
Second, attack Britain, and eliminate him.
Third, go for Spain with fleets, and round the corner.
Then march on to victory!"
<P>
James Gemmill's advice is to "open West, taking out France. Once done,
check your chances against
Britain [usually slim] and then decide to take him out or worm your way into
Central Europe. There is much flexibility in the mid-game -- if you've
survived that long -- but the south and the east are where the dots are.
Britain is a threat, but not as much as in Standard, so you can afford to
let him live."
<P>
Simon Withers notes that "Germany should have these 24 SC's when looking
to the end game, and is probably allied with Spain or France:
Germany [4], Lowlands [2], Scandinavia [3], Britan [3], Ireland,
Milan, Venice, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Poland [3],
Lithuania, St. Petersburg, and Murmansk.
The last nine would look something like Paris, Lyon, Marseilles, Gorky,
Moscow, Croatia, Hungary, Bielorussia, and one of Kiev or Bordeaux. In an
alliance with Italy, Switzerland, Milan, and Venice are going to be replaced
with three centers from France, and a stab may include some Spanish bases as
well."
<P>
Rick Desper offers this:
"Start by convincing Britain and France to attack Spain.  Attack Poland
with Russian help, taking Sweden, Czech Republic, and a couple more. Make
sure Ukraine is still strong enough to hit Russia from the South so you can
grab all of Scandinavia.  At this point turn West.  Invade British isles.
Make deal with France splitting world.  Move East taking Russian lands
while France attacks Italy.  Since you move faster you can push South to
Kiev/Kharkov.  Encourage Egyptian and Turkish growth to make sure Balkans are
weakly held.  Move into the Balkans and grab 33.
<b>Or:</b> start with an alliance with Spain.  Hit the always-vulnerable
France,
perhaps with Italian help.  Then invade Britain, letting Spain have
Ireland.  Foment discord between Italy and Spain, and try to make sure
Eastern situation is chaotic.  Help Russia get slight upper hand
against Poland.  Hit Spain hard, while making sure Italy does not get too
strong.  Reach Gibraltar and seal off France and points North. Hit
Russia/Poland hard for victory.
Germany has to either invade the Balkans in force or reach Gibraltar.
Neither would appear to be an easy task.  I would concentrate upon trying
to be the land power of Central Europe.  To this end your natural rivals
are Poland and Italy.  Germany is naturally a touch stronger than Poland,
so you should be okay there.  Don't let Britain into the Bight!"
<H3>Player Comments on Early German Targets</H3>
James Gemmill thinks "Germany's #1 target should always be France.
Cooperation between
them is possible I guess, but for Germany, turning to another front brings
little benefit, and would make it extremely vunerable in the long run in
the West."
<P>
Rick Desper thinks otherwise.  "Germany should go after Britain or Poland
first.  Whichever is an easier
mark.  The general idea would be to build a fleet or two and try to
dominate Scandinavia.  I would usually say go after Britain, since Poland
is a bit less of an initial threat.  Do not let Poland into the Bornholm
Sea."
<P>
Nate Johnston likes both ideas.  "If I was Germany I would always go for
Britain or France."
<P>
Michael Walsh likes Poland.
"Since France and Poland are immediate neighbors, they are the obvious
first targets.  If Poland ignores you and concerns itself with Russia and
Ukraine, you can sweep in behind it quite nicely and position yourself to
vie with Italy for Cze, Aus, and Hun.  If France concerns itself with
Britain or Spain, you could do the same, but there are fewer SC's to scoop
up.  Poland would be my first choice."
<P>
Joseph Carl, Jr. doesn't even consider it a question.
"Germany should take out France as fast as possible!!!! Not even something
to debate in my opinion."
<P>
Ian York prefers to let the chips fall around him.
"To be facetious, it all depends on who is most responsive to your
diplomacy. I guess I'd rather not fight France, but let someone else do the
dirty work for me while I use neutrals to expand --  only then would I
choose a target."
<P>
Craig Thomson says, "take out France, preferably with support from Spain
and/or Britain. Poland
is further away and despite having it's own concerns in the east requires
that Germany expose itself to France and Britain in the rear. Italy is too
hard to attack from the north initially."
<H3>Player Comments on Switzerland and Austria</H3>
Ian York says, "Hand 'em over! And try and look like you're being generous!
I don't think
they are worth fighting  over when you need at least one of Italy and France
as an ally."
<p>
James Gemmill calls them "a gamble at best, thus early diplomatic
negotiations with especially Italy
are necessary to divide up these two. The goal should be to deny Switzerland
to France at any rate."
<P>
Says Robert Shepard, "I always think Germany is better off
supporting Italy into Switzerland.
He can't take it himself against France, and even if
you are allied with France, France taking it points him towards your rear
front in your joint assault of Britain."
<P>
Stephen Breininger advises to "use your army in Munich to build alliances.
In the opening Spring,
support France into Switzerland. In the fall support Poland from the Czech
Rebpublic into
Austria! Your allies in Switzerland and Austria will hopefully provide a
safe buffer for you."
<P>
Craig Thomson comments, "You need both, but you can't get them -- it's
a tough question...I really don't know.
I definitely would prefer Italy to get the one Germany doesn't rather than
France -- this allows
Germany to buffer itself somewhat...although its home provinces are still
dangerously exposed."
<P>
Simon Withers calls both centers "very important to Germany's defense.
Far more
important than owning them in the early game is ensuring that they are
owned by powers friendly to you."
<P>
Rick Desper says, "Switzerland will almost surely be French.  Austria can be
contested, but I'm
not sure it's worth the fight.  Italy is unlikely to move on Munich, at
least not early.  And if you support Italy into Austria you might get help
in case France is menacing."
<P>
Nate Johnston writes,
"I don't think Germany should try for Switzerland, for one reason.  Unless
you are attacking Britain, the army in Munich will be necessary as a for
ward unit to be used against whoever your first victim is. France or Italy
shall get it.  Italy will probably also want Austria as well, and
you might be able to bargain for it in return for support into Swi."
<P>
Ian York thinks that
"in the south, supporting Italy into Austria is perhaps the most
constructive use for the Munich army -- anything else could provoke
tension or weaken
your defensive position. Once in Austria, Italy may want to go after France
-- let him, he can afford to because he has easy builds to pick elsewhere."
<P>
Joseph Carl, Jr.'s advice is that "Germany should take Austria immediately
and set up for a bounce in Munich to keep France at bay!"
<H3>Player Comments on Saxony</H3>
Ian York's "advice is to move to Saxony in consultation with Poland and Italy:
you have a strong defensive position around Munich and you are sure to receive
offers of support from both France and Italy."
<H3>Player Comments on the Lowlands</H3>
Nate Johnston says, "attack the Lowlands in force on the first turn."
<P>
Joseph Carl, Jr. agrees.  "Take them, moving a fleet across the top to help
out against France.  Try not to threaten Britain."
<P>
Ian York advises: "Don't back down to France, but you might let Britain into
the Lowlands to
secure a DMZ in NTH or an British campaign against France."
<P>
Craig Thomson takes a similar stance.  "Gobble them up entirely -- give one
to Britain if required to keep France weak and place a buffer unit in the way."
<P>
James Gemmill thinks along the same lines.  "Totally go for it if the
anti-French stance is adopted. Britain is your friend in this matter."
<P>
Rick Desper joins the crowd.  "Germany should definitely take the Lowlands.
I would make it a first-year priority.  Try to convince France that it's
better if you have Belgium since he'll get Switzerland.  That leaves Britain,
who will probably not open to the Channel."
<P>
Simon Withers thinks "Holland should always be held as a German SC, but
Belgium can be good bait to offer the French in an effort to have them
help Britain's collapse."
<H3>Player Comments on Scandinavia</H3>
Robert Shepard says that, if allied with Britain, you should "insist that
you keep all the Scandinavian
provinces, including Norway.  This gives you a small naval presence to
defend against a stab, and sets Britain off in the direction you want him,
namely the Mediterranean."
<P>
Simon Withers says,
"Germany must move strongly into Scandinavia, if Germany is to have any
hope against Britain.  With the help of either Russia or Poland, Germany
should be able to use Scandinavia as a launching ground for her invasion of
the Isles."
<P>
In James Gemmill's opinion, "hard bargaining and a few naval units should
allow you to participate in
the Scandinavian carve-up. At the very least, you should attempt to curry
diplomatic favor by playing Russia off of Britain."
<P>
Rick Desper says, "conquering it would be nice.  I suggest trying to figure
out what Russia is up to, and going along with it."
<P>
Alexander Woo likes the pro-Russian position as well.
"What you really want is a balance of power in the East, and Russian
control of Scandinavia."
<P>
Michael Walsh says that "to get control of the North Sea, you must
first control Sweden and Norway!"
<P>
Ian York advises to "only back out if you are encouraging a B/R war (if
this is the case, go for the Lowlands instead)."
<P>
Craig Thomson also likes setting Britain and Russia at odds.
"Capture Denmark and then let Russia and Britain fight it out -- giving help
as required to maintain the balance."
<P>
Nate Johnston's advice is to "attack Scandinavia if Britain is the target."
<P>
Joseph Carl, Jr. advises to stay out.  "Germany should seek an alliance with
Britain or Russia and just give it
away, except for Denmark.  Then have Britain wrap around the north or help
out against France.  Then guard himself against the stab that is likely
from Britain.  If allying with Russia, which I think is a weak alliance at
best, then help Russia take Scandinavia so that Russia can keep Britain
from helping France against you. Russia will have enough problems as it is
against Poland, and Austria. So I'd prefer an alliance with Britain in
Scandinavia."
<H3>Player Comments on the Baltic Seas</H3>
Ian York says that "the Baltic Sea areas should be part of your DMZ with
Poland, and furthermore opening to <tt>BOR</tt> may upset Russia (who, as
in Standard, will be after Sweden)."
<H3>Player Comments on the German Navy</H3>
On the idea of a large navy, Rick Desper offers an emphatic "Yes!!!
More of the 'natural' German SC's (Hamburg, Berlin, Denmark,
Holland, Belgium) are coastal than inland."
<P>
Craig Thomson, though, says that it "depends on the game -- I'd be
inclined to forget it,  provided that Britain is moving elsewhere."
<P>
Michael Walsh likes the naval approach.
"If the opportunity comes to expand north, by all means build fleets! A
fleet in Bornholm could both anchor a drive into Poland or an attack into
Sweden and Norway." -
<P>
Simon Withers says flat-out that "Germany needs to have the strongest
navy in the Atlantic."
<P>
Alexander Woo says,
"Build a navy?  If you're friends with Britain, no.  If you're not, yes,
and as fast as you can.  Personally, i'm a fan of naval power, so this is
for me a good reason to choose to attack Britain over France.  That and
that Britain is more likely to fight you in the Lowlands and Denmark than
is France."
<P>
James Gemmill is moderate on the issue, advising "Build only so much as to
create a deterrent to the naval powers that surround you and to gain a seat
at the Scandinavian table. At least early on. Later, you may decide to
build up your naval strength, especially if Britain is doing well [or, better,
not so well]."
<P>
Joseph Carl, Jr., likes the overland approach.
"Germany should forget a bout a navy initially and get as many armies as he
can moving south."
<P>
Ian York also advocates a smaller navy.
"Unless you want to go to war with Britain, two to three fleets should be
enough to
rule the Baltic: Scandinavia and Poland are good targets if you are friendly
with Britain."
<P>
Nate Johnston thinks the navy can wait as well.
"A Navy is useful, but probably not in the first few turns.  In the middle
game, taking on Britain usually gets to be a priority and it is very useful
there."
<P>
Robert Shepard thinks sticking to dry land can help diplomatically.
"While Britain is a natural enemy, he can make a powerful ally if you are
willing not to build any more fleets."
<H3>Player Comments on German Allies</H3>
<dl>
<dt><h4>General Comments</H4>
<dd>
James Gemmill is adamant:  "POLAND, POLAND, POLAND!!!"
<P>
Michael Walsh says,
"Against Poland, I'd want Russia as an ally, Against France, I'd want
Britain or Spain."
<P>
Craig Thomson's "first choices would be Britain, Spain, and Italy."
<P>
Nate Johnson thinks "Germany's best allies are Poland and Italy."
<P>
Rick Desper says Germany's best allies are "Everybody!  Seriously, Britain,
France, Italy, Russia, Poland all make
good early allies in different ways.  I think it's important to achieve at
least three peaceful fronts."
<P>
Simon Withers says, "the three best allies in the game for Germany are Poland,
Italy, and Spain,
with France coming in fourth. All in all, if you're playing for a good draw
ahead of a win, Spain is your best choice, you'll have a hard time stabbing
each other, and can very easily dominate the west. If you're looking for a
win first Italy or France are better choices. Both should be easy to stab
for the final few centers, and allying with one should always leave you the
option of turning to the Spanish later."
<dt><H4>Britain</h4>
<dd>Toby Tyrelll notes that "Britain occupies the nearest corner and so Germany
might have a good chance once (if) Britain can be removed."
<P>
Joseph Carl, Jr. says,
"Britain is a threat (but also) the most desirable ally!"
<P>
Stephen Breininger thinks otherwise:
"Your main opponent is Britain. Your main goal will be to control the north
sea and then push into Britain's homeland."
<P>
Ian York says,
"In the north, Britain presents the greatest threat. Britain has three
northern fleets to your two. Fortunately, the Liverpool fleet is likely to
head south via
Ireland. Britain is likely to be a thorn in your side if you want to hold
any SC's bordering the North Sea. As in the Standard game, lend him an SC
normally in the German sphere of influence in order to win friendship and
direct him elsewhere (Belgium vs. France or Denmark vs. Russia)."
<P>
Robert Shepard says,
"In most games Germany needs to eliminate Britain in order to have any
naval significance, but this alliance can work as long as you can establish
clear rules for Britain.  Give Britain all of Spain and Bordeaux, and
insist that you keep the rest of France and Scandinavia. If successful,
Britain will do most of his builds in Gibraltar, so all the better for you.
With your massive armies by that point, a coordinated assault on Italy
should prove to be no problem."
<dt><H4>France</H4>
<dd>
Joseph Carl, Jr. thinks
"France will almost certainly be an enemy. I believe France is the superior
land force initially, and if anyone allies with France, Germany will
crumble."
<P>
Ian York says,
"France has three armies that could held your way, but are more likely to
take Switzerland and Monaco, and defend borders with Italy and Spain. France's
naval capability isn't worth worrying about in the early game. Don't think
about fighting with France over Switzerland: France is
likely to defend it at all costs, and the person most likely to benefit will
be Italy."
<P>
Simon Withers thinks
"France is nowhere near as good an ally as Spain is.  France will surely want
to keep any gains France makes against Britain, and won't really be willing
to share any of her gains in Spain, not that you'd want to go that far out
of your way to pick them up.  At the same time France is going to want to
keep a decent navy hanging around waters you don't want her sailing in..."
<P>
Stephen Breininger advises to
"convince France to go after Spain. If not, Spain will go after France. If
Spain has the upper hand, make sure France does not fall into your
homeland. At this point, consider joining forces with Spain. Remind him
that England is an enemy to both of you.  Try to strike the best possible
deal with Spain."
<dt><H4>Italy</H4>
<dd>
Michael Walsh says that
"a neutral Italy is very important; as long as Italy isn't heading north,
Germany has a decent chance to expand early on."
<P>
Nate Johnston points out that
"Italy has great opportunities to expand, all at the expense of German
enemies."
<P>
To Simon Withers,
"Italy is almost as good an ally as Spain.  The only drawback is the
inability to assist you against Britain, but otherwise Italy is in a better
position to dominate the Med than Spain is, when you are ready to turn
East. Unfortunately Italy will probably not survive very long as a German
ally as Italy usually needs Swi/Aus/Mun in order to have enough centers to
win a 2 sided war against Spain or France in the west and Turkey or Egypt
in the east."
<P>
Alexander Woo calls Italy
"a key power.  Italy cannot make more than a nuisance attack
on Germany, but it is very helpful if Italy attacks France.  This both
takes care of one of your neighbors and frees Spain to take out the
southern British position and then, hopefully, attack either France or
Britain.  It means that you can hopefully achieve rapid growth in your
choice of Britain (with Russian help) or France (with Italian help).  An
attack on Italy is out of the question; Germany can hold neither Italy
against naval attack nor the Balkans against land attacks from all sides."
<P>
Ian York says,
"Italy has two armies that are likely to head in your direction, while two
Mediterranean fleets grab easy SC's (so watch out for more Italian armies!).
Only fight over Austria if you are sure of French support. Otherwise, strike a
deal with Italy, and make sure you occupy Saxony quickly -- this is vital as a
defensive move, but could also see Italy supporting you into the Czech Republic
as the start of a I/G juggernaut eastwards."
<dt><H4>Poland</H4>
<dd>
Nate Johnston says,
"Poland (is a good ally) because it has many targets elsewhere to occupy
it, and it's neutrality is useful."
<P>
Joseph Carl, Jr. thinks that
"Poland will almost certainly be an ally, but won't help you much."
<P>
Ian York likes the Polish alliance.
"The Czech Republic is as far west as Poland will even think about in the early
game. Big tension in the east around Bielorussia make a Polish-German
neutrality pact almost automatic."
<P>
So does Robert Shepard.
"Poland usually heads east and you are best to let him, you have problems
in the west that must be resolved first."
<P>
Stephen Breininger agrees.
"Build a strong alliance with Poland. There is a natural buffer zone of
Prussia/Silesia/Saxony. He should head east and you should head west."
<P>
Simon Withers says,
"Poland (is a good ally) simply because if Poland falls before the Germany
is ready, Germany is in big trouble.  Poland is an excelent buffer against
Russian forces, and can also help keep the Ukraine and Italy from getting
greedy in Austria.  Just keep in mind that to win the game you need those
Polish home centers."
<dt><H4>Russia</H4>
<dd>
Ian York advises:
"Keep friendly with Russia -- he's more useful to you than the Ukraine or
Poland. He can share Scandinavia, Poland and Britain with you, as well as
giving you a good share of the Balkans (normally under Ukrainian, Turkish,
or Italian control)."
<P>
Alexander K. Woo thinks that
"most important for Germany is a strong Russia, and especially for
Ukraine and Russia to be allied.  A strong Russia keeps both Poland and
Britain in check.  Unless you can arrange an Egypt-Turkey stalemate (so
that Ukraine is free to attack Russia), however, Russia cannot get too
strong."
<dt><H4>Other Powers</H4>
<dd>
Ian York says,
"A southern power with a strong navy can be valuable ally: one of Spain,
Italy, Egypt, or Turkey can dominate the Mediterranean and its coastal
territories while
Germany cleans up inland. An aggressive Spain is particularly useful to
Germany because he can tie up forces from any of France, Britain, and Italy."
<P>
Nate Johnston poins out that
"the distant countries such as Ukraine or Spain or Turkey, whose enemies
are your enemies, are useful as well."
<P>
In James Gemmill's opinion,
"Spain, too, can be valuable against France, and is often favourable to
your overtures."
<P>
Simon Withers likes courting Spain as well.
"Spain is perfectly situated to build a navy to help kill Britain, and then
send it elsewhere to keep you happy.  A Spanish/German alliance should,
with a good start dominate the western half of the board, and have strong
influence in the eastern half.  While you and Spain are working on Britain,
you can also team up on France for some extra centers, and then trade
Spanish bases in Britain for German ones in France to create a very clear
line between the two of you."
