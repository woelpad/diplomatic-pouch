<H3>Egyptian End of Game Statement</H3>
Not much to say here for an EoG, as it was basicly over when I  took
over as Egypt.  Turkey still had some fight left in them so they had to
flex there muscle until I established a statemate line.
<P>
Thanks for the game.

<HR>
<H3>Russian End of Game Statement</H3>
Need to update the summary - I actually started subbing for Dean
Gordon/Russia about 2-3 game years ago.  And to that end, I've really 
little
to say about the game except congrats especially to Joseph Carl, Turkey, on
playing the ENTIRE GAME!  Very, very well done.
<P>

<H3>Spain's End of Game Statement</H3>
This will also be brief, as I also took over Spain at a time when there was
little left to do but resist the slow advance of the eventual victors.
Things went OK at first, partly because with 7 units it was possible to
enact a slow defence.
<P>
My only doubt on how to play this was whether I should try to favour one of
Russia, Turkey, or Egypt. With Egypt relentlessly hammering away at me, I
confess that I was
tempted to throw everything I had on the Eastern front, thereby favouring
the Russian, who was coming from the North and who had expressed at least
some tentative support for one of my units.
<P>
But none of this mattered in the end. Congratulations to the victors!

<H3>Turkey's End of Game Statement</H3>
In the opening of the game, I wanted an alliance with Egypt.  The
fights I've seen between those two countries seems detrimental to
both of their growth.  I was pleased to see that Egypt was willing
to go along with it as well.
<P>
I was a bit frustrated that Egypt kept using the EMed instead of
moving over a little bit.  It hampered my development, but I endured.
<P>
The war was pretty easy up until I hit Russia.  Russia made one
mistake early on that allowed me to advance much further than I
should have been allowed to do.    But I returned the favor and got
pushed right back, and worse.  The Ukraine is a strange battle field
to fight in.  I needed to get into Germany or have Egypt stop that
stalemate line so I could make the advances I wanted to.  It never
happened, too difficult to coordinate in a no press game.
<P>
I asked for the first draw, don't know why it didn't go through at
that time.  But I felt that Egypt was trying for more and I started
bouncing my men and bumping into him indicating I wanted his Fleet
in the EMed to get away from my territory.
<P>
The message never got through, and my patience had finally worn
thin, and I hit Egypt, trying to convince him that a draw was at
hand.
I don't know if that was the case or not, but that's who I thought
was holding it up.  Since Russia was bottled up and only Egypt was
making gains at that time.
<P>
After I took Egypt's homeland I asked for another draw, but it failed
again.   But finally I think it became obvious to us all that it was
indeed a draw.
<P>
I may have forgotten to put my draw in a few times, or maybe someone
was hoping another power would go abandoned.
<P>
I enjoyed the game very much.  I would like to thank Egypt for his
excellent cooperation throughout the game.  With out it I don't
think either of us would have been contenders.  I would also like to
thank Russia for a game well play.  You did great!
<P>
Thanks Vince for hosting the game, and keeping up with it.  I
appreciate your dedication and would be willing to help you out
anytime.
<P>
Joe Carl (Turkey)
