<H3>Turkey's End of Game Statement</H3>
This was my first game of the "modern" variant.  A friend showed me a map
of the variant, and I was intrigued.  Several countries, like France, had
much more challenging opening positions than their equivalent countries in
the original game.  Others, like Britain, seemed to have more advantages
in modern as opposed to standard.
<P>
I hate playing Turkey in standard variant games.  It's options are so
limited and, with smart people playing Italy and Austria, it is usually
bottled up in the corner with no place to go.  In modern, however, Turkey
has (in my opinion) a much more interesting opening position, and that is
why I requested it.
<P>
I started off on very good terms with both Egypt and Ukraine, and either
one would have suited very well as a strong ally.  Unfortunately, keeping
both of them as allies would have been very unwise, as had they decided to
team up against me, Turkey soup would have been relatively easy to
prepare.  Ukraine was growing much faster than I was, so Egypt was the
recipient of my first stab.
<P>
I was planning to stay with Ukraine all the way through the game and end
with a 2-way draw.  I tend to be leery of such arrangements when the
winning condition is just 1 more than half of all centers, but since eight
extra centers were required to win this game, I felt confident that a
mutual deal could be reached.  Indeed, the Ukraine-Turkey steamroller
seemed at least as effective as legendary Russia-Turkey steamrollers in
the standard variant.
<P>
In that comparison, however, Ukraine in "modern" has one major drawback --
it cannot build fleets on the north coast.  Therefore, when Russia was
eliminated, Britain had an easy time walking into the Scandinavian centers
and threatening the Murmansk/St.Petersburg area.
<P>
The game had settled down to the game of "Cleanup" about which Italy was
complaining when I managaed to get 4 builds and Ukraine got none.  I
thought long and hard before stabbing Ukraine because I calculated that
UBF would be able to set up a stalemate line, but I decided to give it a
try anyway.  UBF were successful in setting up a line which could have
worked had the right set of orders been given, but I was lucky in that
nobody remembered to support Barcelona.  After that, it was just a matter
of systematically pushing forward for the win.
<P>
I had a lot of fun playing this game (regardless of the fact that I won,
although that certainly didn't hurt).  I didn't particularly appreciate
some of the personal attacks or excessive whining that occured during the
midgame, but I guess that comes with the territory (I do, however,
appreciate any apologies which followed said attacks).  Commendations to
Egypt, Britain, and Ukraine for their impressive play and to France,
Britain, and Ukraine for staying with the game all the way to the end.
Also to Brian, who helped us all through judge crashes and unforced
abandonments and such like.  It's been a pleasure gaming with you all, and
I hope to see you all again in future games.

I also had a lot of fun. This was my first modern variant as well.
I could do without the personal attacks but they are par for the course.
It was a long game with some interesting twists.
<P>
Congrats to Turkey as well as to the other players who stuck it
out or stepped in to help finish the game.
