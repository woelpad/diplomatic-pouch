<H3>Italian End of Game Statement</H3>
I was pleased to be allocated Italy. IMHO it has one of the best chances
of survival (perhaps Vince's stats will back me up here?), and plenty of
room for diplomatic manoeuvring (although this isn't as obvious in a
No-Press game).
<P>
My initial strategy was establish myself both as a power by both land
and sea. The former required avoiding conflict with both Germany and France,
and the latter needed quick fleet builds from the SCs I gained in '95/'96.
<P>
I decided to promote conflict amongst my neighbours: France's invasion
of Italian soil was quickly aborted when German units occupied much of
western France. I tried to slow Egypt's initial grow in the hope that
he wouldn't overwhelm Turkey too quickly, but instead Turkey appeared
too powerful, so I quickly left Egypt to muster his defences.
<P>
I found dealing with NMRs and powers going CD quite difficult. Should one
respond immediately and grab territory, and so risk losing an ally (who may
simply have missed one particular deadline)? By the mid-game I was
supporting as many CD units as I was attacking. Notably, Spain
barely made a move, and with a strong Britain I need to act quickly to
keep the western Med Italian. Hence my lone fleet strike for Morocco.
This led to Italian fleets setting up a stalemate line around SOG
against an angry Britain.
<P>
I was very pleased that France responded positively to my support of
his units, and he didn't appear intimidated by the size of Italy when I
crossed the Alps and quickly subdued German home territory. This success
against Germany was the foundation of our alliance -- but we had a lot of
work to do together before securing the draw.
<P>
By this stage I had sealed up the Med, and controlled half of Germany and
the Balkans. To my dismay, Poland (who had been waging a successful
campaign against Russia) went CD. Russia, already controlling half of
the CD Ukraine was free to drive west at an alarming rate. Furthermore
Russo-Turkish cooperation was such that Turkey was free to focus on
eliminating Egypt.
<P>
In central Europe I tried to use CD Polish and Ukrainian units to hold
up the Russia advance, while attacking working with Egypt to break
the Turkish position along Gre-AEG-EME. Coordination with Egypt wasn't
good enough: in the end Egypt crumbled and I was forced to attack Turkey
alone in order to take Gre. With Russia armies outnuimbering me in
central Europe I began to fall back from War-Rum in order to:
<dd>a) find a defendable position
<dd>b) bring Russian troops into conflict with France or Britain and hence
cement a western alliance.
<P>
Russia did attack Britain in Scandinavia, but Britain appeared
to believe that I was the true threat and threw armies in Spain and fleets
into the Altantic. France recognized that his room for expansion into
central Europe was limited by Italian positions, and so drove strongly
into Spain with the builds he had gained from his victory over
Germany. French fleets were able to break out of the Bay of Biscay, and
Britain (having lost SCs in Scandinavia and Spain) fell. The Italian
fleets that Britain had feared so greatly barely made it past the
Straits of Gibraltar, and instead rushed east in reaction to a new
development.
<P>
My struggle against Turkey had won me Gre and Bul. Then Russia units
(currently restricted to Rum) appeared in Turkey, crossing the
Caucasus and the Black Sea. I was greatly confused, because I didn't
know how to help Turkey. Turkey disbanded his Med fleets, which I
took as a sign that he was pro-Italy. I tried to support Turkey in
Ist-Izm, but the Turkish armies remained in the Middle East, lined
up against Egyptian fleets. Egypt was no longer of any use to Italy:
I stabbed him and supported Turkey into Egypt, hoping that his armies
might be enough to push back the Russian in the south-east.
<P>
France had achieved a strong naval position in the Altantic and Italy
had enough armies in Germany and the Balkans to find a stalemate line.
A few refinements were needed - convoyed attacks provided the threat
that took Bul from Russia to Italy (and Bul is strong position to hold
from the south-west), and late in the game Russia conceded Hamburg and
Berlin to IF to secure his defensive position in the north. I had
decided mid-way through the game that Russia could not obtain 33
centres from a solid IF alliance - bottlenecks at Cai, Ist and NTH
should be fought over. Russia wasn't able to break into the Altantic
or the Med, and with enough armies in central Europe, Italy was able
to hold a line.
<P>
I'd like to apologise to Egypt and Turkey for treating such dedicated
players so ruthlessly, and thank our GM and all the players who played out
their position to its full. A special acknowledgement to France, who
put up with a willful, overbearing ally in the early game, handling
me very well in the mid-game (only snapping at me once, when an
Italian fleet sailed too far west), before patiently establishing his
position while Italy and Russia played out a side-show in the south-east.
<P>

<H3>Russian End of Game Statement</H3>
This was my first modern game, as well as my first no-press game.  It 
seemed
like a good combination, as I could concentrate on the tactics required by
the new board.
<P>
My opening was non-committal, trying to get extra units into Scandinavia
and avoiding the appearance of directly attacking anyone, especially 
Turkey.
(I was fairly certain I'd have a bad game if both Poland and Ukraine turned
on me, so I didn't worry about that possibility.)  I did have to spend the
early part of the game repelling Poland, but I was able to pick up the 
extra
SCs needed by gobbling up the Ukraine.
<P>
Like Ian (Italy), I was in a quandary when powers went CD.  Having been
forced against the ropes already in the opening, I didn't want to assume
that the player had dropped permanently, because I had no idea if a new
player would step in.  It took me three extra turns to gobble up Poland 
from
that caution, and that caution also probably cost me the solo win when I
didn't at least grab Edinburgh from Britain.  Without a foothold there, I
had no hope of getting to 33.
<P>
There was a good stiff struggle in the center of the board against the
Italian armies, and I was able to take advantage of the fleets in Bornholm
and Baltic Seas to anchor the attack that got me as far as I did.  That
became a static situation very quickly, even though we traded off control 
of
Krakow and Berlin.
<P>
The decision to stab Turkey in 2002 wasn't taken lightly.  He'd been a good
ally, and, at the time, Italy appeared overextended on the continent and it
wasn't certain that his alliance with France would hold.  But I thought a
quantum leap in units would allow me to sweep through.  Italy was able to
quickly form a defensive line, however, only conceding Bulgaria and Krakow.
And, since ruthlessness and tentativeness make a bad combination, I ended 
up
making the rest of my gains by gobbling up the remainder of Turkish
territory.
<P>
I was amused to find how Italy was able to make diplomatic suggestions with
his excess fleets, a maneuver I copied too late for it to do any good....
<P>
The most frustrating part of the game was trying to manipulate my northern
forces.  My fleets kept getting in each other's way.  The convoy of an army
to Iceland was, I thought, the only I could get all my fleets to the front.
In retrospect, that was my best opportunity to get a toehold on the British
Isles, as France had already invaded the south.
<P>
At the end, I knew I could form a stalemate line by conceding the two 
German
SCs, knowing that I had two superfluous fleets to drop when Italy forced 
its
way into Istanbul and Izmir.  (I can hold everything else.)  (It does seem
that there are many more opportunities for stalemate lines in this game,
since there are more units to deal with.)
<P>
Congratulations to Ian and Kent for a well-played game and a solid alliance
(darn it).  Also, a hearty congratulations and sincere apologies to Erik,
who played very well.
<P>
I like this variant.  I'm ready to do it again!
<P>
It was asked if Russia considered 33SCs a possibility, in the face of such
a solid I/F alliance.
Well, I had some hopes it wasn't all that solid, what with the Italian 
fleet hanging about in Gibraltar and the small dustup in the South Atlantic 
around 2008 or so.  I also wondered if Italy might try for the solo win with a
timely stab of France.
<P>
I knew I couldn't get to 33 when I was unable to get any of the British
Isles.
<P>
I knew the IF alliance wouldn't break after Britain was removed.  There was
no other opportunity for instability.
<P>
I wasn't secure in the draw until I'd locked up Cairo.  If Italian fleets
get into the Red Sea, Italy could easily get to 25 or so, making a stab of
France much more tempting and likely to work.
<P>
The Master noted that "Some of the powers in Modern fall back on a defensive
position when attacked, leaving them invulnerable to an invasion on a single
front."
That's what made the most inviting places to attack those where the forces
of three countries met.  I doubt I could have gained Hamburg and Berlin, 
nor kept them as long as I did, if not that the adjoining territories were 
split between French and Italian forces, allied or not.  The co-ordination isn't
there.  Similarly, I could really only force my way into Bulgaria while
Italy and Turkey were splitting the influence.  Italy was easily able to
recapture it (and I wonder why it hadn't fallen sooner) once it controlled
the Aegean.
<P>
I was tempted, when I was first forced out of Berlin, to retreat to Saxony,
and hope to cause some havoc behind the Italian lines by hopping from SC to
SC and perhaps forcing a collapse of the frontline.  If Italy hadn't held a
build or two in reserve at that time, it might have proved effective.  As 
it was, it wouldn't have been an annoyance for more than a year.
<P>

<H3>France's End of Game Statement</H3>
In the beginning of the game, I saw two important things close to France.
<ol>
<li>No Spain (smile)
<li>Germany and Italy attacking me (frown)
</ol>
<P>
In fact Spain did move once. He bounced me out of Portugal. Well done, you
know how to pick your enemies. :)
<P>
In 1902 I felt the wind of fortune when Italy decided to join me against
Germany. Suddenly my defensive strength was enough and when Italy walked in
to Germany it all was over. I also was lucky when Britain got into CD.
giving me the whole isle.
<P>
Italy played very clever and growded slowly but shurely. In fact I think
Italy made the best game of us all. He didn't gain so much help from CD's
like I and Russia. I'm very pleased that he invited us to a threeway-draw 
so
that we didn't have to try and stab each other. I like keeping an ally to
the end. :)
<P>
Russia had a very interesting opening, not clearly good with enemies in
Poland and Ukraine. With a little luck and good play he got the upper hand
and with Turkish help it seemed like he was able to win alone but feel on
the goal line (at least that's what we say in Sweden).
<P>
A special thanks to Turkey who played to the end, and after reading his
story I believe he was worth a better finnish.
<P>
I wanted to mention to Italy tht
I didn't notice any extreme "diplomacy" during the game, only simple 
"attack him" and "I'm your friend"
<P>
Russia wrote that he wasn't secure in the draw until he'd locked up Cairo,
and that if Italian fleets got into the Red Sea, Italy could easily get to
25 or so, making a stab of France much more tempting and likely to work.
<P>
If Italy would have come that far I had moved my armies against him to try
to force the draw. With 2 builds pending this was one thing I always had to
count on. With 3 armies in Europe ready to defend, Italy couldn't have 
gotten his SC's fast enough.
<P>

Thanks to the GM for taking good care of us.
You're not the only one trying to win with another country that has never 
won.
Who knows, we even might be allies in another game!
<P>
Best regards, Kent Liljegren.
