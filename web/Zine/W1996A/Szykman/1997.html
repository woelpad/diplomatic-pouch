Happy New Year!
<p>
Some of you may recall that in 1995 The Diplomatic Pouch appeared as a web-based
Diplomacy zine.  Then, at the beginning of 1996, we unveiled The Diplomatic
Pouch as a full blown Diplomacy resource, which in addition to the zine, was to
provide information about all aspects of Diplomacy to all player communities.
<p>
Although there is no way to pull off a repeat performance of the magnitude of last
year's upgrade, we decided to try to do another overhaul of The Pouch for 1997.
Some of the new things you'll see around here are ideas we came up with on our own;
others are ideas that were submitted via the survey which
you may have noticed appeared on our pages back in November.
<p>
We've tried to be
responsive to the feedback that we've gotten, but few of the people who filled out
the survey took the time to send in comments and it's hard for us to guess at what
people want.  If you have suggestions on how we can improve The Pouch, please
let us know... we're listening.
