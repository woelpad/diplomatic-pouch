<p>
This is just a sampling of some of the things that were done at The Pouch
since last year's major expansion:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="/Online">Online Resources</a> section has grown from a single page to several sections containing links to over 65 resources in all.
<li>Created the <a href="/Online/maps.html">maps page</a>, our most
popular resource, which currently has links to
over 100 Diplomacy maps in a variety of formats for the standard game and popular variants.
<li>Created the <a href="/Registry/">Hobby Registry</a>, which now contains over 250 people.
<li>Maintained a convention calendar
and information about clubs and
organizations in the <a href="/Face">Face-to-face</a> section.
<li>Expanded the <a href="/Email">Email</a> and <a href="/Postal">Postal</a> sections.
<li>Accumulated a hefty number of accolades and reviews (if you haven't
already, see the amusing review excerpts listed at the top of the &quot;And What
They're Saying&quot; part of the <a href="/reviews/">accolades page</a>).
<li>And of course, we've brought you another year's worth of the finest
<a href="/Zine">zine</a> around.
</ul>
