Here's a list of some of the things you can look for in the future:
<ul>
<li>We'll be making the entire contents of the <a href="/Zine">zine</a>
searchable and putting up a search page to quickly find articles on
topics you are interested in.
<li>We will be putting up a judge status page which will let you find out
the status of various judges.  Actually, that information is already available
on Bjoern Tore Sund's openings lists, but for some reason, people still keep
posting those annoying messages to
<a href=news:rec.games.diplomacy&lt;/a><tt>rec.games.diplomacy</tt></a> whenever
they don't get a reply from a judge asking if the judge is down.  Maybe this
page will help decrease the number of those messages.
<li>We'll actually be putting some clamored-for content in the
<a href="/Showcase">Showcase</a>
section.  We regret having let it slide, but we lost (to real life)
the person who was to be maintaining it.
<li>Depending on use and demand, we may add additional game types to the
<a href="/DP-cgi/setqueue">game queues</a>.
<li>And (although it goes without saying we'll say it anyway) we'll continue
to be the best Diplomacy resource by adding to our content with new issues of
the <a href="/Zine">zine</a>, new <a href="/Online/maps.html">maps</a>,
<a href="/Online/variants.html">variants</a>, and other
<a href="/Online/">online resources</a> as they come to us.
</ul>
