<p> 
Here's a list of the brand new things you'll find in our pages (as of the release 
of the W1996A issue of the zine) as part of our New Year's remodeling:
<ul>
<li>We've moved!  David Kovar has kindly made disk space at his site available, and we
	are greatly indebted to him for it.  Our new URL is
	<a href="../../../"><tt>http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch</tt></a> (We'll be
	keeping the front
	page at both sites so that links to the front page do not
	need to be updated, but update links you have to any other pages).  Thanks
	to this move, we now have cgi capabililty again.  Because of this, The
	Pouch has some new functionality already, with more to come in the future.
<li>We've added a <a href="../../../Online/variants.html">variants page</a> to the Online
	Resources section as a complement to our maps page.
<li>You can now <a href="../../../Online/search.html">search</a> for information in the
	<a href=news:rec.games.diplomacy><tt>rec.games.diplomacy</tt></a>
	newsgroup archives.
<li>Frustrated at not being able to get into a popular type of game on the
	Internet judges?  Check out our
	new <a href="/DP-cgi/setqueue">game queues</a> and sign up there.
<li>You can now jump to our most-often-accessed resource, the
	<a href="../../../Online/maps.html">maps page</a>, directly from the front
	page.
<li>We've created a <a href="../../../Email/registration.html">judge registration page</a> so that
	you can register with any of the PBEM Internet judges directly from the web.
<li>The <a href="../../../Registry/">hobby registry</a> has been updated.  Now that
	we have CGI capability again, it is once again searchable
	and now you can add new entries directly, using an online form.
<li><a href="mailto:lawyerted@prodigy.net">Ted Miller</a> has come on board as the
	maintainer of the E-mail section.  Look for that section to get the
	attention that we didn't have time to provide.
</ul>
