<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>This is the first article in a series discussing the Payola Diplomacy
variant.  The current article provides a high-level overview of the very basic
mechanics of the game from the player's perspective.  Future articles will
discuss more complex tools at the player's disposal, some player tactics,
strategy, and some coming changes to the game itself.</p>

<p>Payola is a Diplomacy variant (designed by the immortal Manus Hand)
where each turn the orders for <b>every</b> <a HREF="#Unit">unit</a> are
"auctioned off" to the highest "bidder"
or "team" of bidders (bidders may
combine themselves to form a team either deliberately or accidentally!).
Players may bid on <b>any and all</b>
units, and are limited only by their creativity and their funds (calculated
based on Supply Center ownership).</p>

<p>The <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a> consists of a "closed" bidding system,
where all <a HREF="#Bribe">bids</a> are submitted anonymously and "opened"
simultaneously.  No player ever knows which units other players have bid on or
how much money they offered.  All bids are processed by the
<a HREF="#Auctioneer">auctioneer</a> who informs the players of the results.
This auction format allows a player to influence the orders issued by <b>any</b>
unit (including units owned by other players!).</p>

<p>Since each player is unaware of what bids (or how much
<a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a>) other players are offering, he can never be
certain as to which of his bids
will be accepted.  This actually makes Payola an exciting and dynamic game where
stalemate lines are <b>never</b> assured!

<p>The complete annotated Payola rules can be found in the
<a HREF=../../W1995A/Payola>Winter 1995 Adjustment issue of
<i>The Pouch</i></a>.</p>

<p>Before we discuss the mechanics of the game, some of the terminology used in
this article is presented in the glossary below:</p>

<dl>
  <dt><a NAME="Accept"><b>ACCEPTED</b>

	<dd>A <a HREF="#Bribe">bribe</a> (or bid) is said to be <b><i>accepted
	</i></b> if it "wins" the <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a>.  The monetary
	amounts of similar bids from different players are added together by the
	<a HREF="#Auctioneer">auctioneer</a>.  Each <a HREF="#Unit"> unit</a>
	automatically <b><i>accepts</i></b> the bribe(s) paying the largest sum of
	money.  The <b><i>accepted</i></b> bribe(s) determine what order that unit
	actually issues.</p>

  <dt><a NAME="AcceptList"><b>ACCEPTANCE LIST, REFERENCE LIST, or
  TIE-BREAK LIST</b>

	<dd>A "prioritized" list for each player that is used to "break ties" in
	the event that the <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a> results in a "tie"
	between 2 (or more) <b>different</b> orders for the <b>same</b>
	<a HREF="#Unit">unit</a>.</p>

  <dt><a NAME="Auction"><b>AUCTION</b>

	<dd>Each turn, the order issued by each <a HREF="#Unit">unit</a> is
	<b><i>auctioned</i></b> off to the highest bidder.  Players submit "closed"
	bids (also called <a HREF="#Bribe">bribes</a>) to the
	<a HREF="#Auctioneer"> auctioneer</a> for <b>any and all</b> units.  The
	auctioneer processes these bids and informs the players of the results
	(that is, he only reveals the order which each unit performs).  The
	identity of the bidders and the individual bids they made are <b>not</b>
	revealed until the conclusion of the game.</p>

  <dt><a NAME="Auctioneer"><b>AUCTIONEER</b>

	<dd>One of the duties of the <a HREF="#GM">GM</a>.  There is no "gavel
	banging" since the <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a> is conducted in a
	"closed" format, where <a HREF="#Bribe">bids</a> are submitted anonymously
	and secretely without knowledge of other players bids.</p>

  <dt><a NAME="Bribe"><b>BRIBE or BID or OFFER</b>

	<dd>A monetary (<a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a>) "donation" which is
	surrendered if the specified <a HREF="#Unit">unit</a> "agrees" to issue the
	designated order.</p>

  <dt><a NAME="GM"><b>GM</b>

	<dd>Game Master (also serves as the <a HREF="#Auctioneer">auctioneer</a>
	and the <a HREF="#Banker">"Swiss Banker"</a>).</p>

  <dt><a NAME="OfferList"><b>OFFER LIST, OFFER SHEET, BRIBE LIST, or
  BID LIST</b>

	<dd>Each movement phase every player submits an <b><i>offer list</i></b>
	to the <a HREF="#Auctioneer">auctioneer</a>.  This list contains any
	number of <a HREF="#Bribe">bribes</a> for any number of
	<a HREF="#Unit">units</a> (including the units of other players!).</p>

  <dt><a NAME="Silver"><b>SILVER PIECE</b>

	<dd>The unit of currency used in a Payola Game (abbreviated AgP).</p>

  <dt><a NAME="BankAccount"><b>SWISS BANK ACCOUNT or BANK ACCOUNT</b>

	<dd>The treasury in which each player safely stores his
	<a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a>.  The <b><i>Swiss Bank Account</i></b> of each
	player is maintained by the <a HREF="#Banker">Swiss Banker</a>.</p>

  <dt><a NAME="Banker"><b>SWISS BANKER or BANKER</b>

	<dd>One of the duties of the <a HREF="#GM">GM</a>, involving the
	maintainance of each player's <a HREF="#BankAccount">Swiss Bank
	Account</a>.  The <b><i>Banker</i></b> makes the necessary credits and
	debits from the players' accounts.</p>

  <dt><a NAME="Unit"><b>UNIT</b>

	<dd>An Army or Fleet.</p>
</dl>

<a NAME="SimpleBribe"><hr><h3>The "Simple" Bribe</H3>
<dl>

  <dt><b>What exactly is a <a HREF="#Bribe">bribe (or bid)</a>?</b>

	<dd><p>Think of a bribe as a binding contract.  You offer a
	<a HREF="#Unit">unit</a> a certain amount of <a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a>
	along with a <b>specific</b> order you want that unit to issue.  If the
	unit "agrees" to <a HREF="#Accept">accept</a> your bribe (and issue the
	order which you designated), then your <a HREF="#BankAccount">Swiss bank
	account </a> is debited accordingly.  A player's account is <b>not</b>
	charged for bribes which are <b>not</b> <a HREF="#Accept">accepted</a>.</p>


  <dt><b>What happens if other players also bid on one of the same
	<a HREF="#Unit">units</a> on which I bid?</b>

	<dd><p>Similar bids made by <b>different</b> players are combined together
	during the <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a>.  Although a unit "considers" all
	bribes, the bribe (or combination of bribes) which pays the most
	<a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a> will <b>automatically</b> be <a HREF="#Accept">
	accepted</a>.</p>

  <dt><b>What happens to the <a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a> that is "paid" to the
	bribed <a HREF="#Unit">unit</a>?</b>

	<dd><p>The monetary value of all <a HREF="#Bribe">bribes</a> which are
	<a HREF="#Accept">accepted</a> is automatically deducted from the
	<a HREF="#BankAccount">Swiss bank account(s)</a> of the "bidder(s)."  This
	money is (theoretically) paid to the unit accepting the bribe and is never
	"seen" again by any of the players.</p>

  <dt><b>How and when are <a HREF="#Bribe">bids</a> processed?</b>

	<dd><p>Bids are processed by the <a HREF="#Auctioneer">auctioneer</a> after
	all players have submitted their <a HREF="#OfferList">offer lists</a>.
	Players must submit an offer list in every movement phase of the game.
	Retreat and adjustment phases are handled normally (that is, there is <b>no
	</b> <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a> during these phases).</p>

  <dt><b>Does the <a HREF="#Auctioneer">auctioneer</a> "reveal" my
  <a HREF="#Bribe">bids</a> to other players?</b>

	<dd><p>No, the auctioneer does <b>not</b> "reveal" any bids (or their bid
	amounts) to the players until the conclusion of the game.  Each player is
	<b>only</b> informed as to which of his or her own bids were
	<a HREF="#Accept">accepted</a>.  Additionally, the "owner" of each
	<a HREF="#Unit">unit</a> is told how much <b>total</b> <a HREF="#Silver">
	AgP</a> his unit received in bribes during the <a HREF="#Auction">auction
	</a>.</p>

  <dt><b>How do you "write" a <a HREF="#Bribe">bribe</a>?  What is the format
  used?</b>

	<dd><p>There are essentially two components to a "simple" bribe:  a
	monetary <b>amount</b> (in whole pieces of <a HREF="#Silver">silver</a>)
	and a <b>specific order</b> that you wish the <a HREF="#Unit">unit</a> to
	issue.  For example, let's say you would like the army in Paris to HOLD,
	and you are willing to "surrender" 7 AgP if it "agrees" to issue this
	order.  This bribe would be written as:</p>

	<p ALIGN=CENTER>
		<tt>7&nbsp;:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;HOLD</tt>

	<p>Notice that the ":" (colon) character separates the monetary amount from
	the specific order.  This ":" (colon) character indicates the simple "type"
	of bribe (other bribe "types" will be described in future articles in this
	series).</p>

  <dt><p><b>Can a player issue more than one <a HREF="#Bribe">bid</a> for the same
  <a HREF="#Unit">unit</a>?</b></p>

	<dd><p>Yes!  For example, let's say that the "bidder" is willing to spend
	seven
	<a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a> if Paris HOLDs, but is willing to spend ten AgP if
	Paris SUPPORTS a move from Munich to Burgundy.  This would be represented
	as follows:</p>

	<center><table>
		<tr><td><tt>&nbsp;7&nbsp;:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;HOLD<br>
		10&nbsp;:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;SUPPORT&nbsp;A&nbsp;Munich&nbsp;->&nbsp;Burgundy
	</table></center>

	<p>Notice that by issuing multiple bribes for the <b>same</b> unit with
	<b>different</b> monetary <b>amounts</b> the player attaches a "value" to
	the bribes he offers.  In this particular case, the player indicates that
	the SUPPORT order is of greater "value" to him than the HOLD order (ten AgP
	vs. seven AgP).</p>

  <dt><b>What happens when more than one player attempts to <a HREF="#Bribe">
  bribe</a> the same <a HREF="#Unit">unit</a>?</b>

	<dd><p>All bribes are considered and processed simultaneously.  Each unit
	will automatically "choose" to issue the order which pays it the most
	money.  For example, consider the following scenario:</p>

	<center><table>
		<th>France<th>Germany<th>Italy
		<tr>
			<td valign=top><tt>&nbsp;2&nbsp;:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;HOLD<br>
		10&nbsp;:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;->&nbsp;Burgundy
			<td valign=top><tt>5&nbsp;:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;HOLD
			<td valign=top><tt>4&nbsp;:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Paris&nbsp;HOLD
	</table></center>

	<p>These <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a> results can be summarized as
	follows:</p>

	<center><table BORDER>
		<th>Order<th>France<th>Germany<th>Italy<th>Total
		<tr>
			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Paris&nbsp;HOLD
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>2 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>5 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>4 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>11 AgP
		<tr>
			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Paris&nbsp;->&nbsp;Burgundy
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>10 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>10 AgP
	</table></center>

	<p>The Paris Army will <a HREF="#Accept">accept</a> the bribe(s) for the
	order which will pay it the most <a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a>.  If Paris
	orders a move to Burgundy then it will "receive" 10 AgP (all from France).
	However, if Paris HOLDs, then it will "receive" 11 AgP (2 AgP from France,
	5 AgP from Germany, and 4 AgP from Italy)!  Since a unit <b>always</b>
	issues the order which maximizes its profit, Paris would therefore "choose"
	to HOLD.</p>

	<p>The <a HREF="#BankAccount">Swiss bank accounts</a> of these players will
	be adjusted by the <a HREF="#Banker">Banker</a> accordingly (France will be
	charged 2 AgP, Germany 5 AgP and Italy 4 AgP).  Notice that France's bribe
	of 10 AgP for Paris to move to Burgundy is <b>not</b> accepted.  Therefore,
	France's bank account</a> is <b>not</b> charged for this bribe (and is
	<b>only</b> charged 2 AgP for the HOLD order).</p>

  <dt><b>Is a player limited in how many or what combinations of
  <a HREF="#Bribe">bids</a> he can make?</b>

	<dd><p>No!  Any number or combination of bids can be submitted.  The
	player is only limited by his imagination and creativity.</p>

  <dt><b>Can a player submit <a HREF="#Bribe">bids</a> which <i>offer</i> more
  <a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a> than he actually <i>has</i> in his
  <a HREF="#BankAccount">Swiss bank account</a>?</b>

	<dd><p>Yes, a player can <b>submit</b> bids totalling as much AgP as he
	wants!  However, a player cannot <b>spend</b> more AgP than he has in his
	bank account.  After the <a HREF="#Auctioneer">auctioneer</a> has
	calculated the <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a> results, if the total AgP
	offered by any player's <a HREF="#Accept">accepted</a> bids exceeds the
	amount in that player's Swiss bank account, the auctioneer will
	automatically reduce <b>each and every</b> bid offered by that player by
	one AgP and then recalculate the auction results.  This process is repeated
	until no player <b>spends</b> more AgP than he has in his bank account.</p>
</dl>

<a NAME="Ties"><hr><h3>"Breaking Ties" and the Acceptance List</h3></a>

<dl>
  <dt><b>What if the <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a> results in a "tie" when
  determining what order a given <a HREF="#Unit">unit</a> will issue?</b>

	<dd><p>When a "tie" occurs, it is resolved using the <a HREF="#AcceptList">
	acceptance list</a> of the unit's <b>owner</b>.  Consider the following
	scenario:</p>

	<center><table>
		<tr>
			<th ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP>Russia
			<td VALIGN=TOP><tt>5&nbsp;:&nbsp;A Rumania&nbsp;->&nbsp;Bulgaria
		<tr>
			<th ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP>Turkey
			<td VALIGN=TOP><tt>7&nbsp;:&nbsp;RUSSIAN A Rumania&nbsp;->&nbsp;Budapest
		<tr>
			<th ALIGN=RIGHT VALIGN=TOP>Austria
			<td VALIGN=TOP><tt>7&nbsp;:&nbsp;RUSSIAN A Rumania&nbsp;HOLD
	</table></center>

	<p>These auction results can be summarized as follows:</p>

	<center><table BORDER>
		<th ALIGN=CENTER>Order<th>Russia<th>Turkey<th>Austria<th>Total
		<tr>
			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Rumania&nbsp;->&nbsp;Bulgaria
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>5 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>5 AgP
        	<tr>
			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Rumania&nbsp;->&nbsp;Budapest
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
		<tr>
			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Rumania&nbsp;HOLD
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
	</table></center>

	<p>In this case, a "tie" has occurred concerning which order the Rumania
	Army will issue (it would receive 7 <a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a> for a
	move to Budapest and 7 AgP to HOLD).  In order to "break the tie" the
	<a HREF="#Auctioneer">auctioneer </a> must refer to the
	<a href="#AcceptList">acceptance list</a> of the player who <b>owns</b>
	the Rumania Army (in this case Russia).</p>

	<p>Each player submits an acceptance list to the auctioneer which may be
	modified at any time during the course of the game.  An acceptance list is
	only "consulted" when deciding "ties."  In all other (that is, non-"tie")
	cases, the acceptance list is not used and is ignored.</p>

  <dt><b>How do you indicate your <a HREF="#AcceptList">acceptance list</a> to
  the <a HREF="#Auctioneer">auctioneer</a>?  What is the format used?</b>

	<dd><p>An acceptance list merely consists of the word "ACCEPT" followed by
	a list of the players in the game in <b>priority</b> order.  Each player
	in the list is abbreviated using the first letter of the power he or she is
	playing.  The order of powers in the list is from highest to lowest
	priority.  For example, let's look at the following <b><i>acceptance
	list</i></b> submitted by Turkey:</p>

	<p ALIGN=CENTER>
		<tt>ACCEPT ITFREGA</tt>

	<p>In this case, Turkey has set the following priorities in his
	<b><i>acceptance list</i></b> (from highest to lowest):  <b>I</b>taly,
	<b>T</b>urkey, <b>F</b>rance, <b>R</b>ussia, <b>E</b>ngland,
	<b>G</b>ermany, and <b>A</b>ustria.</p>

	<p>In the event that the <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a> results in a "tie"
	when determining the order issued by any <b>Turkish</b>
	<a HREF="#Unit">unit</a>, Turkey's <b><i>acceptance list</i></b> will be
	"consulted" to determine which order takes priority.  An order for which a
	bribe was received from Italy takes precedence over one which was received
	from Turkey, which has precedence over an bribe received from France, and
	so on.</p>

	<p>Notice that it is possible for a player to make his <b>own</b> bribes to
	his <b>own</b> units have <b>lower</b> priority than bribes to his
	<b>own</b> units made by <b>other</b> players.  As seen in this example,
	Turkey has indicated that (in the event of "ties" concerning his <b>own</b>
	units) Italy's bribes take precedence over even his <b>own</b> (Turkish)
	bribes!</p>

  <dt><b>How is the <a HREF="#AcceptList">acceptance list</a> used to resolve
  "ties" that occur during the <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a>?</b>

	<dd><p>Consider the following scenario:</p>

	<center><table>
		<tr>
			<th VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>Italy
			<td><tt>6&nbsp;:&nbsp;RUSSIAN A Rumania&nbsp;->&nbsp;Bulgaria<br>
			5&nbsp;:&nbsp;RUSSIAN A Rumania&nbsp;->&nbsp;Budapest

			<td><tt>2&nbsp;:&nbsp;A Rumania&nbsp;->&nbsp;Budapest
		<tr>
			<th VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>Austria
			<td><tt>7&nbsp;:&nbsp;RUSSIAN A Rumania&nbsp;HOLD
	</table></center>

	<p ALIGN=CENTER><tt>RUSSIA'S Acceptance List:  RAIFTEG</tt></p>

	<p>These auction results can be summarized as follows:</p>

	<center><table BORDER>
		<th>Order<th>Italy<th>Russia<th>Austria<th>Total
		<tr>
			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Rumania&nbsp;->&nbsp;Bulgaria
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>6 AgP

			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>A Rumania&nbsp;HOLD
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
	</table></center>

	<p>Since the auction produces a "tie" between two <b>different</b> orders
	for the Rumania Army (7 <a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a> for a move to Budapest
	and 7 AgP for a HOLD), the <b><i>acceptance list</i></b> that was submitted
	by the <b>owner</b> of the Rumania Army (in this case Russia) must be
	"consulted" to "break the tie."</p>

	<p>Checking Russia's acceptance list reveals that (in cases of "ties")
	Russia's (own) <a HREF="#Bribe">bribes</a> have priority over Austrian
	bribes (the "R" appears before the "A" in Russia's <b><i>acceptance
	list</i></b>).  Therefore, Rumania will <a HREF="#Accept">accept</a> the
	Russian bribe and order a move to Budapest.</p>

	<p>Note that it is the <a HREF="#Unit">unit</a> <b>owner's</b>
	<b><i>acceptance list</i></b> which is "consulted" to decide "ties,"
	and <b>not</b> the "bidder's."</p>

  <dt><b>What if the same player has submitted two (or more) bids to the same
  unit, both of which are involved in a tie?</b>

	<dd><p>Under these circumstances the <b>earliest</b> bid in that player's
	<a HREF="#OfferList">offer list</a> is used to "break the "tie" between
	these orders.  For example:</p>

	<center><table cellpadding=2>
		<tr>
			<th VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>England
			<td><tt>5&nbsp;:&nbsp;FRENCH F Brest&nbsp;HOLD
		<tr>
			<th VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>France

		<tr>
			<th VALIGN=TOP ALIGN=RIGHT>Germany
			<td><tt>4&nbsp;:&nbsp;FRENCH F Brest&nbsp;->&nbsp;English Channel<br>
			1&nbsp;:&nbsp;FRENCH F Brest&nbsp;->&nbsp;Picardy
	</table></center>

	<p ALIGN=CENTER><tt>FRANCE'S Acceptance List:  AFIETRG</tt></p>

	<p>These <a HREF="#Auction">auction</a> results can be summarized as follows:</p>

	<center><table border>
		<th>Order<th>England<th>France<th>Germany<th>Total
		<tr>
			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>F Brest&nbsp;HOLD
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>5 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>2 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
		<tr>
			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>F Brest&nbsp;->&nbsp;Picardy

			<td ALIGN=LEFT><tt>F Brest&nbsp;->&nbsp;English Channel
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>0 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>3 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>4 AgP
			<td ALIGN=CENTER><tt>7 AgP
	</table></center>

	<p>In this case, the auction</a> produces a "tie" for the Brest Fleet
	(7 <a HREF="#Silver">AgP</a> for a HOLD and seven AgP for a move to English
	Channel).  The <b><i>acceptance list</i></b> submitted by France (the
	<b>owner</b> of Fleet Brest) is "consulted" and reveals that Austrian
	<a HREF="#Bribe">bribes</a> have the highest priority.  Since Austria did
	<b>not</b> offer any bids for the Brest Fleet, we move to the next entry on
	France's <b><i>acceptance list</i></b>.</p>

	<p>Re-checking France's <b><i>acceptance list</i></b> we see that French
	bribes have the second highest priority.  However, France has offered two
	<b>different</b> bids for the Brest Fleet, <b>both</b> which result in
	paying it seven AgP (two AgP to HOLD vs. three AgP to move to the English
	Channel).  To "break the tie" the bribe which occurs <b>earliest</b> in
	the French offer list is accepted (in this case, the move to English
	Channel).</p>

	<p>Notice that once a "tie" has occurred, only the bids which produce the
	"tie" are considered.  Additionally, all bids "participating" in the "tie"
	are considered equally, irrespective of their monetary <b>amounts</b>.
	Only the <b>sequence</b> in which those bids were submitted is used to
	resolve the "tie."</p>

<dt><b>Is this all I need to know?</b>

	<dd><p>To get started?  Yes!  But be warned, Payola is <b>highly</b>

<dt><b>So what's next?</b>
<dd><p>The next article in this series will
discuss more complex bidding strategies and begin to explore some of the
various tactics that a player can use when bidding.
Additionally, we'll discuss other forms of bribery that are available,
making the bidder's job easier.  Later on down the road,
the next generation of bribe syntax will be introduced.  This new syntax
will allow for the expression of all types of bribes and will even permit
some new bribes which are currently inexpressible!</p>
