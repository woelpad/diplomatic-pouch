<p>Welcome to the Spring 2013 Movement issue of the Pouch!</p>
<p>I'm afraid the offering of articles in this issue is smaller than it was in the previous <a href="/Zine/W2012A/">Winter 2012 Adjustment Issue</a> &#8212; but to be fair, that really was the biggest issue we'd had in a very long time! However, remember that you can always help us make the next issue bigger by submitting your own article to <b><a href="editor@diplom.org">editor@diplom.org</a></b> for the next issue, the <b>Spring 2013 Retreat</b> issue in May.</p>
<p>It is with sadness that we must note the loss of the creator of the wonderful game of <b>Diplomacy</b>, Mr. Allan Calhamer, who passed away on February 25th of this year. I am sure that the Pouch Zine's readers will agree that he enriched all our lives by creating this wonderful hobby, and we offer our heartfelt condolences to his family.</p>
<p>It would have been fitting if we had been able to make this issue a dedication to Mr Calhamer. Unfortunately, with the limited resources at our disposal and little time, we were not able to turn this current issue into one that I feel would be a suitable tribute to him. I hope we will do a dedicated issue in honor Mr. Calhamer at some point in the future.</p> 
<p>However, in a larger sense, this entire Zine &#8212; this entire site &#8212; is already a tribute to him. The work and thought and effort that he has inspired in all of us through the game of <b>Diplomacy</b> is truly remarkable. There are few commercial games that have enjoyed the fifty-plus-years run of success that <b>Diplomacy</b> has; and I am sure that none of them inspire the same fascination that <b>Diplomacy</b> does.</p>
<p>I hope you will enjoy the articles in the issue, and continue to play this amazing game. While we are saddened at his loss, I am sure we will all continue to enjoy the hobby he created for a long time to come. And perhaps that is the best tribute to Mr Calhamer that we can all offer.</p>
<h3>Enjoy the Pouch!</h3>
