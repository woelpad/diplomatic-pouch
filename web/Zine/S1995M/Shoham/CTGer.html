<H2>Germany's End of Game Statement from Game Cut-Throat</H2>
</center>

<PRE>
For the most part of the game my plan was defence.
I tried to get together with two other nations to attack a third, but the
cooperation between EF was very strong, so being attacked by EFA forced me
to make a deal with R.

I wanted to go after R but EF kept up the pressure so as to pin down my units
resulting in an interesting draw between me and them.

It is hard to work with someone who has Armies and Fleets in attack position.
Austria's attack on me gave France the advantage with England's support
At this point I knew I was doomed and needed another ally to keep France under
control, namely Italy. Italy kept to themselves and France came into a position
to do some damage to Italy that was only saved by my rogue Fleet.
After the way FEIA treated my through the whole game I was not about to work
with them.

At this point some tragic events in my *real* life led to a total lack of
interest in games, I probably should have resigned, but from my point of veiw
it was over, so I just went through the motions until it was over.
Sorry if this ruined the game, but I have to ask, where were you when I needed
to make a deal?

England would not help me against France.
France would not help me against England.
Italy would not help me against France.

In fact, Italy did not respond to any of my messages until Russia was on their
door-step; a little too late, buddy.

I would still refuse to attack three bordering nations with no support.
