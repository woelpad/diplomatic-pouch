This game will be played with CutThroat play strongly encouraged.
The CutThroat Option:
The following guidelines describe the CutThroat Option.  Note that CutThroat
is only a style of play, not a variant.  As player behavior
is difficult to regulate, a CutThroat game will be treated as a normal game
for purposes of GMing.
CutThroat players are expected to follow the principles of the CutThroat
Code:
CutThroat Code:
1) I will look toward victory as my sole aim.
2) Any alliances formed along the path to victory may be discarded
when convenient to me.
3) Only fools should believe my promises.
4) Should another player break a promise, I will laugh at the suckers
who believed my fellow rogue.
5) I will only seek solo victory.  Should a draw be inevitable, I will
work toward eliminating as many small powers as possible, even if
they have been game-long allies.
Naturally, in seeking a victory, it is quite necessary that no other
players win.  As such, alliances are allowed, in the name of self-preservation
and for the purposes of growth.  CutThroat players are even allowed to
promise other players a share of a draw, as long as they have no
intention of following through with the promise.
The CutThroat Option is being offered as a counterpoint to the
CareBear Option.
