<H2>France's End of Game Statement from Game Care-Bear</H2>
</center>
<HR>
<PRE>
At the beginning of the game I cemented an accord with England, but we
were both hoping for EFG.  This led us to restrain our aggression
against Germany in 1901, which may have cost us the game in the long
run.  Had we taken Belgium in 1901 instead of letting Germany in there
we might have been able to gather enough momentum to stop the oncoming
Juggernaut.  Even though we took Belgium in 1902, it was already too
late, as RT were making extremely quick progress in the Balkans and
Scandinavia.

At that point the game was pretty much lost, given the likely
stability of the alliance structure.  I was still hoping to convert
Germany to our side, and we engaged in intensive negotiations during
Spring 1903, with the ER Scandinavian dispute in the background.  The
spring moves indicated a tentative ceasefire, but our talks
unfortunately broke down in the fall, and we resumed the war.
Meanwhile I hoped that at least we could slow Turkey's progress in the
Mediterranean.

All hope disappeared when Italy attacked me.  From that point on the
only thing to play for was honor.  Austria came through for me, and
Germany also gave me time to deal with Italy.  England and I had some
fun as I continued to proxy my fleet to him even though I needed it,
and he promptly returned it to me.

Once it became likely that I would outlive Italy, I worked on my only
remaining hope in the game which was to encourage an abortive stab by
one of GRT.  Russia was in the best position to stab, so I sent him a
gentle hint that I would support his victory.  Unfortunately, the stab
was successful and Russia won.

England:  You were a loyal and honorable ally in a losing cause.  For
that, and for returning my fleet even though you still could have used
it, you win my vote for the Golden Bear award.

Austria:  Thanks for letting me move towards Tyrolia, and turning on
Italy when he stabbed me.  You are runner-up for the Golden Bear.

Germany:  Did you ever genuinely consider allying with me?  If you
were committed to GRT from the start you did a great job of stalling,
and Russia has a lot to thank you for.  I enjoyed our negotiations
immensely, and was amused by the way our moves reflected them.  You
would have been in the running for the Golden Bear had you not pettily
destroyed my army on this last turn.

Italy:  Apology accepted.

Turkey:  We never had much of a chance to interact.  I was rather
upset when you abandoned the game after being stabbed.

Russia:  Congratulations!  I figured out who you were after reading
the CutThroat summary.  It seemed natural for you to go for the
CareBear/CutThroat double as Russia, and you achieved it!  From the
first move you looked like the most dangerous player on the board,
getting all those proxies from Turkey.

I am insulted that you would think your real life circumstances would
affect my play in the game.  I may root for you in real life, but in
Diplomacy I will do all I can to beat you.
