<H2>England's End of Game Statement from Game Cut-Throat</H2>
</center>
<HR>
<PRE>
As I interpreted the cutthroat (gosh it is hard to spell it correctly
with two t's now isn't it) motto, the game would basically be normal,
except with a higher importance on breaking alliances in the endgame.
France and I seemed able to trust each other for a while, and I congratulate
R/G for their ability at confusing me as to whether they were cooperating
in the early stages.
At some point however, it became clear that Russia was to be stopped,
or I (and Germany and Italy . . .)  had no chance of winning.  Russia
continued the friendly chatter, and I responded in kind; we were not
seriously even trying to deceive one another, but just being
sociable.  Germany on the other hand simply went silent!
If Germany would have pepped up once at some point, he could have
at least *said* he was on my side; I would have believed him, and
he would have crushed me.  Then he could have survived with more
than two units!
In conclusion, I must congratulate Russia, especially for wrapping Germany
around his finger.  (I thought this might have been a secret Juggernaut
game :-)  However, I concur with Italy that Germany's play really
took something out of the game for me.  I will not reinstigate the discussion
about the meaning of cuthroat, but Germany's play would have been exceptional
even in a standard game.  I did nothing to earn such vengeance IMHO.

PS Upon rereading, the last paragraph sounded a little harsh.  I bear no
malice towards the German player, but I am dissapointed in the outcome.
Oh yes, one last thing.  A great deal of the grey press
early on was due to me (sorry if it flooded the mailboxes).
I tried to create a great deal of paranoia, especially
in Russia so as to secure allies.  Unfortunately, Russia
was a *rather* experienced player, and I ran out of steam.
- England
