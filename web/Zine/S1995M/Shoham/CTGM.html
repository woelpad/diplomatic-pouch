<H2>The GameMaster's Comments on Russia's End of Game Statement in
Game Cut-Throat</H2>
</center>

<PRE>
One point of Russia's EOG which I would like to respond to:
he made mention that I made a broadcast about what I thought CutThroat
play should be.  I thought that necessary, as I felt that I ought to
make some explanation of what I was thinking of when I started this game.
I do have a habit of broadcasting answers to questions, and
not citing the questioner.  I do this when I receive a question whose
answer I believe to be of interest to all player.  I answer the
question without reiterating the question, as I feel questions are
often meant to be confidential.
I was impressed by Dan's play.  The twist of convincing Turkey
that an alliance was CutThroat idea was one that I foresaw. Of
course, Turkey really asked for a stab.  The use of grey, partial
press to create the Serbian Intelligence was a stroke of genius.
I was disappointed  that nobody made any serious effort to
stop Russia.   I never understand why petty bickering prevents players
from stopping a loss.
Oh well.  Nice game, Dan.  This win puts you atop the Hall of
Fame standings, I think.  Good luck in the future for all players.
