<H2>Italy's End of Game Statement from Game Care-Bear</H2>
</center>
<HR>
<PRE>
I began the game by allying with Austria, and then attempting to convince
him to play the Key-Lepento.  It took some convincing, but since it WAS a
carebear game, he finally consented.  Then he botched it, to my dismay.  I
was bounced by Turkey in Serbia (I'm curious, was that happenstance, or
were you expecting that move?) because A didn't support me in.  To make the
position even worse, he neglected to retake Trieste after I did finally
get Serbia.
By the time we finally got our units into place, it was way too late. Before
the new-year break, I had agreed to let France move to Piedmont and then to
Tyrolia to help us out.  Unfortunately, I forgot about that over the long
break so when he moved there, I became... well... indignant (grin).
Convinced that I had been stabbed and in a dying position anyway, I decided
to go after France with everything I had, fully aware that I was throwing the
game to Russia.  It wasn't until I was completely developed against F that
I remembered that in fact, he was right.  Ooops :)  Sorry 'bout that, France.
