<H2>Turkey's End of Game Statement from Game Cut-Throat</H2>
</center>

<PRE>
Well, thus ends my first PBEM diplomacy game.  It was a learning experience
of sorts.  I certainly knew what I was getting into (not your usual newbie
game).  I have to admit Russia's twisting of the CutThroat code got me
thinking I had a (relatively) long-term ally.  His argument that "since
alliances are frowned upon in cutthroat play, we should form one as the
rest of the board wouldn't expect it" seemed sound, and away we went.
As for the 1903 stab, I was asking for it.  However, I knew this was
coming.  I gambled that Russia would be too preoccupied in the north
to stab me that year, and I lost.  I never had the chance to recover after
that, and I joined Austria as a sideliner.  Italy tried to help me in 1904,
but it was too late.
In short, it was an unsatisfying, yet educational (i.e. learning the
ropes) game.  Congratulations to Dan for his win, and thanks everyone
for the game.  Good luck in your future games.
