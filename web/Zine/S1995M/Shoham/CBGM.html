<H2>The GameMaster's End of Game Statement from Game Care-Bear</H2>

GM's EOG:

	My concept of "CareBear" was "Don't break any deals you
make."  The intent of the CareBear Oath was to provide players with
some law which they could refer to, to punish deal-breakers.  The idea
of sharing the world with one's allies was definitely implied, but it
was also specifically not required.  Any player who was willing to
suffer the consequences of breaking the oath was allowed to play as he
wished.
	I thought it was fairly obvious that the Stab-to-Win option
was very possible, as I had set things up.  Apparently only Dan
considered this seriously.  The rest of the players seemed to buy
completely into the idea of Game-Long-Alliances.  I never intended the
game to only be about Alliances.  As I envisioned this variant,
players would make small deals, like DMZ's and 2-year alliances, to
facilitate their progress toward a victory.  Of course, should you be
in a 2-year alliance while your enemies are in a game-long alliance,
your alliance may be forced to grow.  I think that such changes
happened here.
	A few things I was pleased to see: (with the benefit of some
eavesdropping):

1) Key Lepanto opening.  This is the opening where Italy goes through
   Trieste to Serbia in 1901.  Actually, I should say "botched Key
   Lepanto."  Turkey and Russia saw what was going on, bouncing the
   Italians in Serbia, and left Austria with no build.
2) EFG triple.  Actually, I should say "attempt at EFG triple."
   Neither England nor France pushed this idea with Germany strong enough
   before the GRT triple formed.
3) Russia's attempt to rally all Bears against England.  This seemed
   rather contrived to me.  I felt Russia's case was paper-thin, but I
   was glad to see somebody trying to use the format to his own advantage.
4) The Russian stab.  Serves the other bears right for letting their
   guards down.  After all, this is Diplomacy, not CandyLand! :)

	It was a fitting conclusion to the game that Dan should win,
just as he won CutThroat.  After all, Dan was heavily involved in the
discussions of both games.

	I will prepare a commentary of the CutThroat and Carebear
styles, for posting to rec.games.diplomacy.  I think this was an
interesting experiment.
