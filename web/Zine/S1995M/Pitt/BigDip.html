Well...don't just lurk there in the corner.  Come in, shut
the door, stop the draft, pray for peace, pass the
ammunition, repent, etc., etc., etc.  We've got a lot to
cover and there will be a quiz later.  Best grade gets the
negatives showing Manus and the Bandini twins with the Good
Humor man.
<P>
What we have here is the grand opening of a little column
devoted to in-depth but irreverent discussion of whatever
aspect of <em>The Game</em> (Diplomacy, of course) that happens to
strike my fancy.  (And though my fancy has been struck quite
a few times, it's still in working order, thank you...)  At
the suggestion of your beloved Editor (was that good enough,
Manus?), we're going to devote this and most future issues
to a piercing (modest, ain't I?) analysis of a single
land province or water area on the standard Dip map.
<P>
We're going to take a look at the most common tactical and
strategic uses of each province for openings, retreats,
stalemate lines, and so on.  Additionally, when I can get
them (that was a subtle hint to you, Gentle Readers), we'll
have actual war stories from our correspondents on the front
describing real world best, worst, and weirdest use of the
province.  Since this is the first issue and I don't have
the benefit of my Gentle Readers' feedback (that was yet
another subtle hint, GRs), I've picked this issue's province
all by myself (don't worry...my stunt double actually did
all the dangerous parts).  And the winner is...<B>The Black
Sea!</B>
<P>

<H2>
	<center>To Be Black Or Not To Be Black</center>
</H2>

When asked why the Black Sea is a critically important
province, 98% of respondents said "Huh?"  When we then
narrowed our survey group to actual Diplomacy players, 95%
responded, "It's the Russia-Turkey thing, stupid."  (The
other 5% still said, "Huh?" and we immediately asked them to
be our ally in the next HoF game...)
<P>
As the majority knew, the Black Sea plays a pivotal role in
the development of the RT relationship.  Typically, Spring
1901 moves have Russia ordering <samp><B>F SEV-BLA</B></samp> with Turkey
ordering <samp><B>F ANK-BLA</B></samp>.  These orders serve the dual purpose
of protecting each party's interests in the area while at
the same time not giving away any hint of RT's real
relationship.  The bounce is just as likely to be due to a
planned agreement between RT as it is to a failure to come
to terms.
<P>
On the other hand, a successful Spring 1901 move into <samp>BLA</samp>
by either Russia or Turkey is strongly indicative of either a
firm, trusting alliance between the two or all-out war.  The
problem is, no one else can really tell which it is until
Fall 1901.  For example, Spring 1901,

<A NAME=Map1>
<B><pre><A HREF="Map1.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>Russia:  F SEV - BLA, A MOS - UKR, ...
Turkey:  F ANK - CON, A CON - BUL, A SMY - ARM</pre></B>

looks like the two may well be at each other's throats.  However, Fall 1901,

<A NAME=Map2>
<B><pre><A HREF="Map2.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>Russia:  F BLA - CON, A UKR - RUM, ...
Turkey:  F CON - AEG, A BUL - GRE, A ARM - SEV

	       -- or --

<A NAME=Map3><A HREF="Map3.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>Russia:  F BLA S A UKR - RUM, A UKR - RUM, ...
Turkey:  F CON - AEG, A BUL - GRE, A ARM - SMY</pre></B>

is just as likely and deadly to Austria.  A wee bit of
diplomacy on the part of Turkey can enlist the support of
<samp>SER</samp> for <samp>BUL</samp> in Fall 1901
and then, the <samp><B>A BUL-GRE</samp></B> stab
signals lights out for Austria.  In both cases, the
early indications of an RT free-for-all turn out to be
anything but.  In fact, the first option above (<samp><B>F BLA-CON,
A ARM-SEV</samp></B>) goes a long way to solving the biggest stumbling
block in a long term RT alliance.  Namely, what to do about
the Russian fleet in <samp>SEV</samp>.
<P>
The Black Sea plays a long term role in the success of an RT
alliance for one simple reason: it's very difficult to
establish a DMZ there.  Turkey wants to build fleets and
head west through the Mediterranean very early on.  It's
hard to feel comfortable doing that when you know that
there's a Russian fleet sitting in your rear with nothing
constructive to do except plan your downfall.  The options
are:

<OL>
<LI>Let it sit there and try not to worry about it
<LI>Dislodge it and have Russia disband it rather than retreat it
<LI>Let it out into the Med where it is no threat and it can do some good
</OL>

Option 1 is chancy at best.  Recently, in game <samp>togo</samp> on
the EFF judge, Italy discovered this fact the hard way.
<P>
<A NAME=Map4>
<A HREF="Map4.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>
A solid RI alliance left Italy in sole possession of all the
Turkish SC's.  Unfortunately, Italy faced the hard choice of
leaving the conquering units sitting in Turkey serving no
other purpose than guarding against a Russian stab or moving
them to the front where they could gain more SC's.  Russia,
of course, could justifiably (if somewhat disingenuously)
claim that he could not do the same with his <samp>SEV</samp>
fleet since he'd have to move through Italian held territories to do so.
<P>
<A NAME=Map5>
<A HREF="Map5.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>
Italy decided to trust Russia and left a single unit in the
area to protect his Turkish holdings.
Russia, of course,
took the first opportunity to order <samp><b>F SEV-BLA</B></samp> (and then
<samp><b>F BLA-CON</B></samp>).  Worse yet, once Russia had engaged in the stab
via <samp>BLA</samp>, he used the newly gained SC's to build another
fleet in Sevastopol, which he could (and did) order to <samp>BLA</samp> and
continue the cycle.
<P>
Option 2 is worth exploring but frequently difficult to
pull off.  Since Turkey starts with only one fleet, he must
dislodge Russia's fleet on land.  A dislodgement in <samp>BLA</samp> is
not an option unless Turkey builds another fleet.  A Russian
ally who willingly allows Turkey to build another fleet
<B>and</B> use both fleets to dislodge a Russian fleet in <samp>BLA</samp>
deserves no mercy.  Even dislodging the Russian fleet on land
is problematic because it must be done into a Russian held
SC (<samp>RUM</samp> or <samp>SEV</samp>) unless
it's done in <samp>ARM</samp>.  For reasons not
clearly understood, allies often frown on attacks to
dislodge and disband one of their units when this also
results in the loss of an SC....  If the attack is done
into into <samp>ARM</samp>, it requires that Turkey have 2 units located
and attacking toward the far eastern edge of the board.
This begs the question of just exactly what Austria and
Italy are doing all this time....  The net result of all this
is that Turkey and Russia can usually not agree on the
proper time and place to dislodge and disband the Russian
fleet until well into the game.  Frequently, it ends up
never happening at all and then we're back to option 1.
<P>
Option 3 is actually the most sound method of dealing with
this problem because it resolves it immediately (as early as
Fall 1901) and it allows both parties to get some offensive
use out of the fleet.  A Russian move into <samp>BLA</samp> in Spring
1901, followed by <samp>BLA-CON</samp> in the Fall, coupled with a
Turkish move to <samp>ARM</samp> in the Spring and
<samp>SEV</samp> in the fall is
ideal.  Of course, this set of orders requires a great deal
of faith by both powers.  Either could easily block the fall
move of the other with no sacrifice to themselves.  Caveat
emptor.

Though this is our first issue, we've spared no expense to
make sure that you receive the pithiest and wittiest
analysis of the Black Sea.  My theoretical musings above
notwithstanding, I'm pleased to bring you some real life
stories of the not-so-Rich and the not-so-Famous.  Any
similarities to real events or people is purely
coincidental.  Any errors, omissions, or inaccuracies are
purely your own and you accept complete responsibility for
spontaneous self-combustion while reading this.  If you like
the stories, I take full credit.  If you don't, blame the
bum...<em>er</em>...wonderful folks who passed them along to me.
Without further ado, the Best, Worst and Weirdest uses of
the Black Sea (edited to be suitable for viewing by all
audiences by yours truly).
<HR>
<B>
Our first story comes from Rick Desper
<A HREF="mailto:desper@math.rutgers.edu">(desper@math.rutgers.edu)</A>.
This is arguably the worst use of Black Sea....</B>
<P>
The Black Sea story I have has to do with the lasting nickname of Dave
"Convoy" Williams.   The player who was Turkey in this face-to-face game
at Georgetown University was viewed as a
Diplomacy God.  Dave was, unfortunately, Russia.
<P>
It seems that Russia and Turkey were at war.  Russia had a good
position, including a fleet in the Black Sea.  However (due to
circumtances which have become lost in the legend) Russia wanted to
sue for peace.  Perhaps the other front was collapsing.  In any case,
Dave spoke with the Turk, who said something to the effect of 
"Sure we can have peace, but you'll have to remove that fleet in the
Black Sea.  Since you'll have to lose a supply center to do so, why
not convoy one of my armies to Rumania?"  Rumania was Russian-owned at
that time.
<P>
For some reason (we think hypnosis must have been involved) "Convoy"
ordered both
<P>
<PRE><B>     Fleet Black Sea CONVOY Turkish Army Armenia -> Rumania
</B></PRE>
in the fall move and
<PRE><B>     Remove F Black Sea 
</B></PRE>
in the adjustment phase.
<P>
Naturally, the Turk proceeded to render Russia to tiny pieces, winning
the game, if my memory of the legend is correct.
<HR>
<B>Next we hear two gems from David Partridge
<A HREF="mailto:dharmas!dbp@uunet.uu.net">(dharmas!dbp@uunet.uu.net)</A>....
<P>His first story is captioned "Who says you can't swap units?"</B>
<P>
<A NAME=Map6>
<A HREF="Map6.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>
Having successfully eliminated Turkey, but now under pressure from a 
turncoat Italian, Russia found himself in the following position:
<samp><B>A CON, F BLA, F EAS, A RUM, A SEV</samp></B>,

while Italy had
<samp><B>A SMY, A ANK, F AEG, F BUL/sc, F GRE, A SER, A BUD, F ION</samp></B>.
<P>
There were Russian armies available in the north, but the question was
how to hold on until they could be brought south.
<P>
<A NAME=Map7>
<A HREF="Map7.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>
Russia pondered for 
a while and finally decided that Italy's best attack would be:<BR>
<samp><B>SER - RUM, BUD S SER - RUM, GRE S BUL, BUL S ANK - CON,
		     SMY S ANK - CON, AEG S ANK - CON, ION - EAS.
</samp></B>
<P>
This seemed to rule out any method of saving <samp>CON</samp>.
<samp>EAS</samp> could not cut the
support of both <samp>AEG</samp> and <samp>SMY</samp>, so it would be
a double attack.  If <samp>BLA</samp>
supported <samp>CON</samp>, then it would be 3 (<samp>ANK</samp>,
<samp>SMY</samp>/<samp>AEG</samp>, <samp>BUL</samp>) to 2 and <samp>CON</samp>
would be destroyed.  If <samp>BLA</samp> attacks <samp>BUL</samp>, then it
was 2 to 1.  If <samp>RUM</samp> attacked <samp>BUL</samp> and <samp>BLA</samp>
supported <samp>CON</samp>, <samp>CON</samp> could be saved, but
<samp>RUM</samp> would be lost.
<P>
<A NAME=Map8>
<A HREF="Map8.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>
What to do?  <samp><b>SEV S RUM, EAS - SMY, BLA C CON - ANK!</samp></b>
The army was saved
from almost certain destruction, centers are swapped, and Russia's tactical
position was actually improved enough to hang on while armies came down from
the north to shore up the lines.  A nice save!
<P>
<B>David's second story is entitled "The Russian Feint."</B>
<P>
As Turkey, I enjoyed playing the following sequence of feints within a feint.
Austria wanted an ally against Russia, so I agreed to attack with him in 1902,
holding off in '01 because Russia had said he wanted to send forces north and I 
wanted to give him time to do so (or so I told Austria, that is).  Austria
agreed to play along and pretend to be friendly to Russia.  Russia and
I had already decided to form a solid R/T alliance, so we put into effect
a plan to set up Austria for the fall.  The first year went as Austria 
expected:
<P>
<A NAME=Map9>
<A HREF="Map9.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>
In Spring, 1901, everyone is friendly.  Austria opened <samp><B>VIE-TRI,
TRI-ALB, BUD-SER</B></samp>, Russia moved <samp><B>SEV-RUM, WAR-UKR,
MOS-STP, STP-GOB</B></samp>, and I ordered <samp><B>CON-BUL, ANK-CON,
SMY HOLD</samp></B>.
<P>
<A NAME=Map10>
<A HREF="Map10.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>
Then in the Fall, Austria ordered <samp><B>TRI HOLD, SER S ALB-GRE,
ALB-GRE</samp></B> (no need to tip off Russia), the Russian moves were  
<samp><B>UKR S RUM, GOB-SWE, RUM HOLD</samp></B>, and <samp><B>STP-NWY (bounce)
</samp></b> (by agreement with England, who supported himself in), and my
orders were <samp><B>
CON-BLA, SMY-ARM, BUL-RUM (bounce)</samp></B>, followed by the expected "you
scum" comments from Russia.
<P>
In Spring 1902, after Austria had built 2 armies, and Russia a pair of armies
in Sevastopol and Moscow, and I a fleet at Constantinople, Austria promises
peace to Russia, which Russia appears to believe, and the A/T attack on Russia
goes off perfectly with Austria getting into both <samp>RUM</samp> and
<samp>GAL</samp>.
<A NAME=Map11>
<PRE><B><A HREF="Map11.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>Austria:  VIE-GAL, SER-RUM, BUD S SER-RUM, GRE HOLD, TRI HOLD
Turkey:   ARM-SEV, BUL S SER-RUM, BLA S SER-RUM, F CON S F BLA
Russia:   MOS-WAR, STP-MOS, UKR S RUM, SEV S RUM, RUM S SEV (destroyed)
</PRE></B>

<A NAME=Map12>
Fall 1902:  Now comes the crusher.
<PRE><B><A HREF="Map12.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>Austria:  GAL-UKR, RUM-SEV (bounce, destroyed), BUD S BUL-RUM, GRE HOLD, TRI HOLD
Turkey:   ARM-BLA-BUL, BLA C ARM-BUL, CON-AEG, BUL-SER
Russia:   UKR-RUM, SEV S UKR-RUM, WAR-GAL, MOS S SEV
</PRE></B>

In Winter of 1902, things stood as follows:  Austria held his home centers and
Greece, Russia held Sweden and Rumania in addition to his home centers, and
Turkey had ownership of the Turkish centers, Bulgaria, and Serbia.  Both Russia
and Turkey had a build, while Austria was forced to remove a unit.
<P>
Not only was Austria reduced to four centers but two of his units were
hopelessly out of position, and it wasn't long before he was out of
the game.  In addition, Russia got to trade his southern fleet for
an army -- always desirable when allied with Turkey -- thanks to its 
carefully planned destruction.  I've seen the convoy from <samp>ARM</samp>
used a number of times to change an apparent attack on Russia into a sudden
assault on Austria.

<HR>
<B>
And finally we hear from Ken Samuel
<A HREF="mailto:samuel@cis.udel.edu">(samuel@cis.udel.edu)</A> about
the happenings in the game named "1889" on the Washington judge.</B>
<P>
	Many people seem  to think  that the  Black Sea  is absolutely
crucial for Russia and  Turkey in the  opening. They seem to have  the
idea  that if one gets  control  of this  territory early, the other's
hopes   for success  in  the  game   diminish  too significantly   for
words.  For this reason, in  nopress games, it  is rare to see a first
move with  no attempt on the Black  Sea. But often  you won't actually
see  A Smy-Arm or A Mos-Sev,  which implies that  the move  to Bla was
being used for defensive rather than offensive purposes. In games with
press, Turkey and Russia will  commonly agree to  bounce in Bla on the
first  move, and sometimes  on the second  move  too, for their mutual
security. Everyone is scared  to death of  seeing an enemy fleet enter
that territory.
<P>
	In fact, though, it's not so big a  deal.  If Turkey gets into the
Black  Sea, he's   still generally going  to   have to  make some good
guesses to capture Rumania and Sevastapol. (And if Austria allies with
Russia,  Turkey won't get anything.)   And even if he  does make it to
<samp>SEV</samp>, he'll never   go any further  without significant   help
from the
north. What I'm  saying is that the  worst case scenario here is  that
Russia will  have to temporarily  surrender two supply centers.  I say
temporarily, because once Turkey gets  to Sevastapol, he's very likely
to go  to war with  Austria,  and then  Russia has  a  good chance  of
reclaiming his centers.
<P>
	If Russia gets into the Black Sea, he won't be  able to go any
further  without significant help from both  Austria and Italy. Turkey
is a very hard nut to crack. You have to hit  him from all three sides
to make any progress  at all. So Turkey  doesn't have to worry about a
Russian  fleet in Bla, unless Austria  and Italy are  both hostile, in
which case  he's dead no  matter what he does, so  what's the big deal
about Bla?
<P>
	As an extreme example, there was a game where I was playing
Russia, and I destroyed Turkey by actually <em>inviting</em> him into the
Black Sea! Before the first move of the game, I told him I didn't mind
him occupying <samp>BLA</samp>. If he wanted to, he could move there and
stay for as long as he wanted. So he did.
<P>
	The  result was  that  this  caused Turkey   to trust  me very
much.  Why not? As   I kept telling him,   there  was nothing I  could
possibly do to him while  he was sitting in  the  Black Sea. And  this
trust  clearly influenced  his moves.
<P>
<A NAME=Map13>
<A HREF="Map13.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>
When  he  caught wind of a rumor
about an Italian   Lepanto, he decided to  build   <samp><B>F SMY</samp></B>
and order   <samp><B>F SMY-AEG, A CON-SMY</samp></B>, since he was unconcerned
about me.
<P>
<A NAME=Map14>
<A HREF="Map14.html"><IMG height=30 hspace=5 align=left SRC="../../Common/ShowMap.gif"></A>
	Then, when the Lepanto did occur, Turkey moved <em>significantly</em>
away from me in order to concentrate on the Italian threat, because he
trusted me completely. His Fall 1902 moves  were, if I remember right:
<samp><B>F AEG-SMY, F BLA-CON,   A  SMY-SYR (!)</samp></B>  And he   even
told me  he  was ordering  this,  so I ordered  <samp><B>F  RUM-BLA, A MOS-SEV,
A  SEV-ARM</samp></B>. Turkey was  so incredibly weak to my attack that he
crumbled quickly!
<P>
	I  realize this is  an extreme  example, but  I think it shows
just how much of an exaggeration most people's conception of the Black
Sea really is.
