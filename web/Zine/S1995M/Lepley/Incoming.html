<H2>Diplomacy Observations From A Newbie</H2>
<H3><em>Stephen Lepley</em></H3>
</center>
<HR>
It was the <em>Internet</em> magazine which brought Diplomacy-by-email
to my attention.  I suspect that you can thank the folks at <em>Internet</em>
for a lot of the more recent newbies.
<P>
I proudly possess many common "newbie" handicaps -- never played the
game before, am fairly new to the net, have no usenet access, have no
personal contact with other net users.  So, how did this raw newbie
come to command the gloriously losing Italians in the EFF game
<samp>interact</samp>?
<H3>Things That Helped</H3>
<DL>
<DT><B>The FAQ</B>
<DD>The <A HREF="ftp://rmii.com/pub2/starkey/rec.games.diplomacy.FAQ.html">
dip faq</A> was <em>very</em> helpful. Through it I was able to
locate judges, register on a judge, contact Avalon Hill, obtain
<samp>mapit</samp>, etc.
<P>
<DT><B>Avalon Hill</B>
<DD>They processed my order, accepted my visa card, and got
the game to me (with that vital rule book) in good time.
<P>
<DT><B>The DIP-L Gateway.</B>
<DD>This gateway is a life saver for me.  Without it
I have no access to the <samp><B>rec.games.diplomacy</samp></B> newsgroup.
Through dip-l, I was able to call for help and follow advice which led me
into a game.
<P>
<DT><B>Observing</B>
<DD>Observing a few moves in one game gave me the chance to
<samp>SIGNON</samp> to a game, recieve game output, and play with a few of
the judge commands.  Observing for a few turns was helpful.
<P>
<DT><B>Joining A Game For Newbies</B>
<DD>An inspired game master started a newbie game (<samp>interact</samp>)
and generated a lot of helpful press for his flock of beginners.
<P>
<DT><B>Organization</B>
<DD>In a three ring binder I have, among other things,
<DL><DT><DD><SL>
<LI>the FAQ,
<LI>the judge intro packet,
<LI>email from the newbie game describing how to do things,  and
<LI>the Diplomacy rule book.
</SL>
</DL>
When something goes wrong or I have a
question, the answer is often right beside me in the binder.  That helps!

<HR>
<H3>First Impressions</H3>
<DL><DT><B>The email Diplomacy format is great!</B>
<DD>My old gaming pals no longer
live nearby but there is a whole world of gamers I can now compete with via
email and the internet.
<P>
<DT><B>Diplomacy moves faster than I expected.</B>
<DD>By that I mean,  it seems to
me that you have to become aggressive almost immediately with a close
neighbor or you'll probably wind up the way I have in my first game.
<P>
<DT><B>I am impressed with all the dedicated people in the game.</B>
<DD>Those who
keep judges, master games for us players, maintain openings lists, set
up the usenet email gateway, or work on the FAQ.  There seem to be a lot of
hardworking dippers dedicated to maintaining the hobby and expanding
it in more areas than I have mentioned.
<P>
<DT><B>The <samp>rec.games.diplomacy</samp> newsgroup really adds "flavor" to
the hobby.</B>
<DD>This is in addition, of course, to its many and varied practical uses.
</DL>
<P>
So, that is my story.  How one newbie got started and some of his
impressions.  I'm also making a list of strategic advice for myself
based on my first failures, sucesses, and what others have done in my
first game that worked and didn't work.
<P>
Diplomacy anyone?
