<H1>Problems In Designing Fantasy Variants</H1>
<H2><i>Stephen Agar and Mark Nelson</i></H2>
</center>
<HR>

   The basic ingredient of any Diplomacy variant is a scenario in which
several (usually at least five) more or less equal Powers take part in a
conflict for domination of a geographical area.  The scale of this
conflict is not of itself important, it could be a city (as in
the variant "Mobtown"), a country (as in "War of the Roses"), a continent
(as in
"Abstraction"), the planet (as in "Mercator"), the solar system (as in
"Apposition"), and so on.
<P>
This approach is fine for historical
variants; the budding designer merely confines himself to those periods
of conflict where a number of competing factions have been battling it
out, and ignores those conflicts which were essentially two-sided
(for example, the Hundred Years War, the American Civil War, th
Franco-Prussian War, etc.).  Since the essence of Diplomacy is the ability
to have a
changing alliance structure, games where the number of protagonists is
small are not going to be very exciting or practical.
<P>
There are several difficulties in adapting fantasy novels to this basic
formula.  First, although there may be a superficial appearance in the
novel of a number of powers battling it out (Elves, Dwarves, Orcs, Ents,
etc.) all too often the basic story often revolves round the age-old
Good vs. Evil storyline --- a two-sided fight with restricted scope for
diplomacy.  Second, in fantasy novels the impact of individuals is
often out of all proportion to their numbers --- the effect that a Conan,
an Elric or a Sauron may have on a campaign may be far more important
than the weight of numbers behind him or against him.  Third, fantasy
novels are, in the end, novels.  They are telling a story. While it is
possible to place a Diplomacy variant in a fantasy world, if you want
the variant to have the flavour of the plot, then you will need to make
the rules very complex indeed.
<P>
Therefore, the variant designer must make one basic choice before he
gets very far in his new design --- is he just going to use the geography
of the fantasy world, turning his game into essentially a map change
variant (such as "Age of the Young Kingdoms"), is he going to tackle the
problems posed by the characters and the plot of the novel which will
usually involve Personality Units and special locations (such as "Black
Blade"), or is the variant going to be some compromise between the two
(such as "Young Kingdoms I" and  "Young Kingdoms II").

Elsewhere in this issue, we discuss in detail the <A HREF="Elric.html">variants
based on Michael Moorcock's Elric novels</A>.  A couple of these variants
were developed by Stephen Agar.  Stephen's initial attraction
to the Elric stories was the idea of having a map which consisted of land
masses clustered around a central sea, because he thought this would provide
an ideal vehicle for Fred Davis's A/F (Army-Fleet) rules.  By building the
game around the A/F rules he hoped to avoid Lew Pulsipher's warning in
<em>Diplomacy World #1</em> that the worst thing you can do is to simply hunt
down a map of some area, split it into provinces and countries, use the
regular rules, and call that a good variant.  It is much more likely to be a
junkheap.
<P>
In
"Young Kingdoms II," Stephen endeavoured to improve the map balance, add a
device for breaking stalemate lines in the form of Chaos Armies, and
then threw Elric himself in for good measure.
<P>
One inevitable problem in trying to introduce characters from the book
is that the ratio of Heroes to Powers is invariably not one-to-one.  Some
Powers will have no Heroes or "Personality Units," other will have
several.  Therefore, you must either find counterbalancing Personality
Units for the Powers without them (which involves stretching the
original story), give off some of the Heroes/Personalities to
additional players (which can make the variant need so many players as
to either become difficult to get off the ground or introduce players with a
lessened degree of involvement in the game), or just accept that the
game cannot be equally balanced in terms of manpower.
<P>
A surprising number of the plots in fantasy novels also revolve around
unequal conflicts --- that is, the forces of Evil are large and powerful
and sweep all in front of them, but are ultimately defeated not by the
armies of Good but by the Hero.  This tends to mean that the Evil
player or players start off very strong (hence Mordor's double armies in
"Downfall"), which can make the game very imbalanced, or the Personality Units
end up dominating the game.  The designer then has to come up with some
restrictions on alliances in the game to stop the Orcs from teaming up with
the Elves and the Ents from crushing the Gondor/Mordor alliance, because
such an alliance structure would be contrary to the mythical or historical
premise on which the game is based.
<P>
When you consider all the chrome which has been added to the various
versions of "Downfall" (Personality Units, the Ring, Special Locations,
Multiple Units, Cavalry Units, Special Rules, etc.) you can perhaps
understand why it has been through nearly 20 revisions.  Some versions
seek to make the variant more like the book, some seek to make the
variant more playable, and it seems that never the twain shall meet.
