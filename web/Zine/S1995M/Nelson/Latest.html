<H1>Through the Looking Glass</H1>
<H2>The rec.games.diplomacy Newsgroup in March, 1995</H2>
<H3><i>Mark Nelson</i></H3></center>
<HR>
   This article summarizes postings to the usenet group
<samp><b>rec.games.diplomacy</samp></b>.  It is based on the posting which
remain on my
usenet feed at the time of writing, roughly speaking the last three weeks in
March.  I have excluded some non-Diplomacy postings.
<P>
   I have classified the 178 postings in this period into the following
groups.  You may easily look at the summary of each topic by clicking on

<A NAME=AI>
<H3>Artificial Intelligence</H3>
   The postings on using AI for a computer Diplomacy player were 
sparked of by a cross-posting from another group.  The original poster
was not aware of the work that has been done in this field by Daniel
Loeb at Bordeaux University.  If you're interested in this topic you
should look at Daniel's WWW page:

</center>
Alternatively, you should get the next issue of <i>The Mouth Of Sauron</i>
which is expected to appear before the end of the century (maybe).

<A NAME=Articles>
<H3>Articles</H3>
   There were no "Diplomacy articles" this month.  The articles were
an automated weekly posting of the FAQ (which comes in two parts) and the 
Judge Opening List, now maintained by Brad Stuart. 

<A NAME=CluelessNewbie>
<H3>CluelessNewbie</H3>
   The clueless newbie questions were, as ever, clueless and once
again "do people play diplomacy by email?" appeared.  Names have been 
removed to protect the guilty, but one of those responsible used an
<samp>aol</samp> account.

<A NAME=DedicationPoints>
<H3>Dedication Points</H3>
   Although there was only one post on revising the dedication
point system, this is the next "hot topic."

<A NAME=Fanzines>
<H3>Fanzines</H3>
The three fanzine postings
included Jim Burgess' usual plug for the latest issue of
<i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> (well known 
as the only fanzine where the editor regularly reprints
<samp><b>r.g.d.</samp></b> discussion
to liven the zine up, sad but all too true) and two posts on a new zine
set to explode onto the hobby scene in March 1995: <B>The Diplomatic Pouch</B>.

<A NAME=EPHouserules>
<H3>EP Houserules</H3>
   There was no pattern to the houserule postings: grey press, the 
difference between gunboat in postal and email games and a post asking
if it was acceptable for a player in a bad position to resign/disband all
their units.  The difference between postal/email gunboat games is almost
a FAQ.  In both arenas the identities of the players are unknown, except
to the GM.  Press may or may not be allowed.  In postal games press
is always non-partial whereas in email games press may either be partial
or non-partial depending upon the settings of the game.

<A NAME=JudgeFinance>
<H3>Judge Finance</H3>
  The main topic this month has been the financing of a `stand-alone' Judge.
This idea has been floated before and although the current thread started in 
private email just before Christmas it has only recently made its way onto RGD.
<P>
   David Kovar's original suggestion was to finance a stand-alone Judge
which did not piggyback its internet access from either a commercial or
university account.  The main advantages in having such a machine would be
to provide:
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>A machine to support some services (WWW, FTP, and mailing lists)
<LI>An official, shared home for the judge code.
<LI>One judge for "high quality play."  If you pay X dollars to play the game,
   you might have more incentive not to drop out.
</UL>
Kovar continued, "I would definitely not approve of
charging fees for
all of the Judges.
Given that most of them are running on University machines, you couldn't
charge money for running games there without serious ramifications."
<P>
   Pitt Crandlemire was quick to enlarge upon David's
original ideas and suggested
that a fee structure be introduced as a <i>de facto</i> standard for 
Judges, including machines which piggyback their feeds.  In two posts,
Pitt wrote,
"I'm sure that twenty dollars is
a picayune amount for just about everybody. I'm certain there are <B>some</B>
exceptions to this but I think that they'll be few and far between.  
I find it hard to believe that anyone can't afford twenty dollars a year."
Pitt's ideas generated more feedback than David's original suggestion.
<P>
   Michael A. Bachelor and Rob Paar 
pointed out that the introduction of fees would 
increase record keeping and several postees (notable Marc Potter) 
suggested that charging fees would result in legal complications which
would might be too much of a problem to be practical: would it be legal to 
collect money, and would a nonprofit 
corporation have to be setup?
Marc Potter commented, "I don't like penalizing
those players who can't (or won't) afford to send money" and
Tim from Penn State University pointed out that twenty dollars is a
considerable amount
of money in some countries. I make the observation
that using the internet would become considerable less friendly if there
was a fee for every utility.
<P>
   Most posters preferred to raise money through voluntary, rather than
compulsory, means.  Tyler Maschino, in a posting dated 10th March, wrote:<P>
   <DT><i>If money is needed I would strongly urge raising the necessary funds
    through  donations.  If a fee is required I fear the reaction would not
    be positive... Let's not spoil the favour of internet Dip by requiring
    fees.  I think most of the players that use the Judges would be willing
    to donate some money on their accord if they knew exactly where the money
    was going.</I></DT>
<P>
Fintan Costello noted that 
   "[the] initial money for the purchase of the machine would
be easy enough to raise, however the monthly comm bill would be more
difficult to raise consistently.  Charging fees for games would be 
too much of a hassle to be practicable."
<P>
   Pitt commented that "JK's richly deserve compensation for their
efforts.  We cannot continue to count on them (them being the current JK's or
some hypothetical replacements) being willing to continue to do this to
the extent or degree that we've become accustomed."
<P>
   Larry Richardson responded, "The reason I am a JK, and the reason why I work
on the Judge code is because I really enjoy doing it.  I seriously
don't want any money." Several posters pointed out that the amount of
money raised would not be enough to compensate Judge Keepers for the 
amount of time they invest running their Judge, even if the legal
issues could be overcome.
<P>
   Rob Paar suggested that Avalon Hill be approached with the idea
that they might be willing to subsidise a Judge.  The idea that AH should
be encouraged to play a more active role in the internet hobby was not
popular; Avalon Hill have already shut down email diplomacy over 
one network because it was not run the way they wanted it run.
<P>
  After the smoke had cleared David agreed to accept donations 
towards funding a stand-alone machine.  In Europe donations can be sent
to:
<PRE><B>     Michael Zwahlen, Marinsburggstr.33,
     9016 St. Gallen, SWITZERLAND</PRE></B>
Michael entered the internet
hobby recently, but is already a major poster to <samp><B>r.g.d.</samp></b>
and is actively
involved in several discussions: supernova or future BNF?
<P>
  Finally,
Adrian Appleyard suggested that "LOTS of players would pay for a reliable
judge.  I'm sure a PBeM Dip fee would be paid for by heaps of players."
This raises the issue of whether Adrian can be portrayed as the
ideal example of a responsible postal diplomacy publisher and leads neatly
onto our next topic.
<A NAME=JudgeQuestions>
<H3>Judge Questions</H3>
   There were 16 question on the `up/down' nature of Judges:
<UL COMPACT>
	<LI>USEF: 8
	<LI>USNM: 3
	<LI>CAMA: 2
	<LI>USCA: 2
	<LI>USTO: 1
</UL>
and a general post by Andy
Schwarz.  Andy wondered if there was an "easy" way to let players know that
a Judge had gone down or come back up (propagation through usenet is too slow
for <samp><b>r.g.d.</samp></b> to be used for this purpose).  This was
discussed elsewhere.
<P>
   There were three questions on the number of users on EFF.  David Kovar's
   response, dated 12th March, ran as follows:
   "There are currently 1170 unique email addresses in USEF's dip.master
   file, which is the file that describes all of the active or recently
   completed games on the Judge.  There are over 3500 registered players on
   the Judge.  I'd guess that 300 of those are duplicate, bogus, or
   otherwise invalid."
<P>
   A survey of EFF users in 1994 is reproduced for The Diplomatic Pouch,
   available by
   <A HREF="Appendix.html">clicking here</A>.  There were
five miscellaneous questions on the Judge, four on the use of fake press
and one on the syntax for the proxy order.

<A NAME=Miscellaneous>
<H3>Miscellaneous</H3>
   The twenty miscellaneous questions covered a wide area, mostly with
one posting to each topic: there were 5 posts looking for FTF players,
3 on WWW dip resources (lookout for the Leeds University Dip Page, 
real soon now!) and two on updating the FAQ.

<A NAME=Openings>
<H3>Openings</H3>
  There were 27 postings loosely collected together under the openings
label (is it time for the creation of
<samp><b>rec.games.diplomacy.openings</samp></b>?).  
There were ten posting on newbie games,
where to find them and who wanted them, 13 postings advertising new games,
two on all-Australian games, one for a roleplay game in which 
diplomacy should be in the style of the period and one for a human-moderated
game.  I must mention that Bill McNair and 
Michael Zwahlen provided <i>full</i> details on their openings.  Too many
GMs post "opening in new diplomacy game on EFF: game name new" without
providing the full listing of flag settings, which many players need to see
before they can commit to  a new game.  This criticism also applies to 
standby positions.
<P>
   Michael Zwahlan is setting up an e-mail tournament and in one of
his postings he commented on the rating system that he intends to use:
"I know that honoring a survivor with 1 point
means that it is worth more to survive than a 4-way draw (0.75 pts).
A 4-way draw is unnecessary in my opinion as there is still space for
negotiations till they get a 3:1 situation and another one is
killed.  If none of the players wants to take that risk they will
have to take less points.  This means: I don't want to reward cowards."
<P>
   I was surprised that none of the rating boffins took the bait...

<A NAME=RuleQuestions>
<H3>RuleQuestions</H3>
   There were sixteen postings on the Diplomacy rules (does anyone want to
create the newsgroup
<samp><b>rec.games.diplomacy.rtfm</samp></b>?).  Most of these seemed to be
on whether a unit
that is dislodged can protect itself by cutting one of the support of the 
attacking  unit.  Jamie Dreier should be given a gold medal and
Jonathan Haas a silver for taking time to
answer these questions.  Jamie tends to answer by providing examples, whereas
Jonathan quotes the relevant portions of the rulebook. This led Gordon Riley to
ponder if rules can be legally quoted to answer questions or if they should
be merely referenced.
  
<A NAME=StalemateLines>
<H3>Stalemate Lines</H3>
   Two postings on Stalemate lines.  The simple answer is use anonymous
ftp and download Mark Nelson's "STALEMATES: AtoY" package from
<DL><DD><A HREF="ftp://ftp.nda.com/pub/diplomacy/Documents/stalemates.tar.Z">
<samp><B>ftp.nda.com/pub/diplomacy/Documents/stalemates.tar.Z</samp></B></A>.
</DL>

<A NAME=StandbyPositions>
<H3>Standby Positions</H3>
The five standby 
positions were all variant games: Aberration (2), Youngstown (2) and 
Gunboat.

<A NAME=TacticalPuzzles>
<H3>TacticalPuzzles</H3>
   Tactical Puzzles were big this month, with 16 postings.  Unfortunately,
most of the puzzles were badly worded; either the puzzle was plain wrong, or
the composer forgot to include vital information, such as the current season.
The remaining puzzles often used unwanted convoys or obscure interpretations
of the rules governing convoying armies and support that they cut (or don't).
<P>
   Jamie Dreier deserves an honourable mention for Debunker of the Month,
whilst Ethan Spring gets the award for Best Composition of the Month, quoted
below from his post of 14th March:
<PRE>
     "This is a little tougher than the other one.  You are Italy. It is
     Spring 1901.  All units (of all countries) start in their normal positions.
     You know the following about other countries' orders: zilch.  Task:
     find a set of orders (for all appropriate phases) that will result in
     an Italian Victory by 1911."
</PRE>
<A NAME=Variants>
<H3>Variants</H3>
   Variant postings split into three groups: four postings on obtaining 
non-postscript format maps, two on Colonial Diplomacy, and one on two-player
variants.
<P>
   Comments on Colonia again concentrated on its excessive price and
playability.  Jurrien de long wrote:
   "I saw it at a convention some time ago but it is very expensive
   ($75 and up in the Netherlands). 
   Is it much better than the original dip?"
<P>
Edward Kenworth responded as follows:
   "I don't rate it much.  It's even less balanced than the original
   Diplomacy was -- to the point that France is unplayable. I like the
   increased number of supply centres but feel that they could have made a
   much better job of it.  And at GBP45 it's severely over-priced."
