   And now, from the man who could never resist a statistical
challenge, Judge usage stats for 1994.
<P>
I have been working on a program that will search the Hall
of Fame file on any field. 
Using the search program I found out that 1443 different people
either played in a game or served as Master for a game that
ended in 1994. The average person played and/or Mastered 3.6327 games.
<P>
Below is a distribution of how many people involved themselves in how
many games: <PRE>
