<H1>Elric of Melnibone:</H1>
<H2>Diplomacy Variants Based on The Young Kingdoms</H2>
<H3><i>Mark Nelson and Stephen Agar</i></H3>
</center>
<HR>
<i>
<DD>This is the tale of Elric before he was called Womanslayer, before the final
collapse of Melnibone.  This is the tale of his rivalry with his cousin Yyrkoon
and his love for his cousin Cymoril, before that rivalry and that love brought
Imrryr, the Dreaming City, crashing in flames, raped by the reavers of the Young
Kingdoms.  This is the tale of the two black swords Stormbringer and
Mournblade, and how they were discovered and what part they played in the
destiny of Elric of Melnibone -- a destiny which was to shape a larger destiny:
that of the world itself.  This is a tale of when Elric was a king, the
commander of dragons, fleets, and all the folk of that half-human race which had
ruled the earth for ten thousand years.
<DD>
This is a tale of tragedy, this tale of Melnibone, the Dragon Isle.  This is a
tale of monstrous emotions and high ambitions.  This is a tale of sorceries and
treacheries and worthy ideals, of agonies and fearful pleasures, of bitter love
and sweet hatred.  This is the tale of Elric of Melnibone.  Much of it Elric
himself was to remember only in his nightmares.
<DD><B>- the Chronicle of the Black Sword</B>

<HR>
Elric was created by Michael Moorcock in 1972 when <em>Elric of Melnibone</em>
was first published.  This volume contained the map of the Young Kingdoms which
is the main source for all Elric variants.  The books tell the story of
Elric, the albino King of Melnibone and of Stormbringer, his sword.  After many
books and many adventures, Elric, having been deposed, even connives at the
destruction of Imryrr (the capital of Melnibone) with the aid of pirates from
the Young Kingdoms and thus brings on the destruction of his own race.
<P>
Stormbringer is as much the central figure of the stories as Elric himself,
being in fact a chaotic evil sentient being from another plane.  It drains
energy from all it wounds, eventually draining the very souls of the wounded.
At times, the
sword takes control of Elric and he goes on a killing frenzy which may include
his closest friends.  If you want to try one of the books to see what they are
like, we recommend <em>Stormbringer</em>, even though it is sequentially the
last in the
series.
<P>
Elric is unlike most fantasy heroes is that he is really a sad and
lonely figure who ultimately brings death to all around him.  As such,
the Elric novels are a refreshing change from the "comparable to Tolkien
at his best-cum-fantasy role playing game campaigns" that, unfortunately,
dominate the Fantasy market.
<P>
The United Kingdom Variant Bank (UKVB) holds four variants based upon
Michael Moorcock's Elric books:
<PRE><B>     fy02/06 The Age Of The Young Kingdoms Kedge Neuman    30p,
fy01/07 The Young Kingdoms            Stephen Agar    30p,
fy03/07 Black Blade                   Rob Nott        40p,
fy??/07 The Young Kingdoms II         Stephen Agar    20p.
</B></PRE>
Stephen Agar's "The Young Kingdoms I" has for many years been listed
as "The Young Kingdoms III" in the North American Variant Bank (NAVB)
catalogue, Ken St. Andre
having designed "The Young Kingdoms I" and "The Young Kingdoms II" in
the mid 1970's.  However, these earlier
designs are lost, and the UKVB catalogue accordingly lists Stephen's
designs as I and II.
<P>
We review here the four Elric variants in their order of publication.
<P>
<B>"The Age of the Young Kingdoms"</B> is a  six-player variant in which
the powers are: Agrimiliar, Lormyrr, Jharkor, Ilmiora, Pan Tang
and Melnibone. There are five fortresses in the game, four of which are
garrisoned by a single unit, and the other (Melnibone) garrisoned by
double-garrison.  The only unit types in the game are army and fleet.
<P>
In addition Pan Tang and Melnibone have a Sorcerer unit.
There are ten different spells; at the start of the game
each Sorcerer is randomly given four of the ten spells, and
the remaining two spells are hidden by the GM on the board.
Eight of the spells are relatively low
key, allowing the Sorcerer to attack or support a unit, or to create a
Standing Army.  Two are much more powerful, Kelmain Horders and
Destruction.  All the spells may be used once only.
<P>
The game starts in 1400, and the victory condition is ownership of fourteen
supply centres.
<P>
<em>Quick Summary:</em> "The Age of the Yong Kingdoms" is a very simple
map/rule change Diplomacy variant with the addition of
a simple magic system to recreate the atmosphere of the books.
<P>
<B>"Young Kingdoms I"</B>, designed by Steve Agar in 1980, is a 7-player
variant, the powers being Agrimiliar, Dharijor, Kurfar, Lormyr, Melnibone,
Shazar and Vilmir.
The game starts in Spring 6480 and there are the standard two seasons per year.
All players except Melnibone
start with three supply centres;  Melnibone
has one double-centre, and consequently will
usually be playing short.
However Melnibone may, "by virtue of its better
organisation," have double units. The rules do not specify what is
meant by double units.  Presumably, you can use two builds to build a
double strength unit.  However, some questions remain.  Does a double strength
unit act at double strength when
supporting? Does an unsupported attack on a supporting double strength
unit cut <em>all</em> the support or just one of the supports? Can Melnibone
merge units together to create double units?
<P>
In addition to the standard army and fleet units, Melnibone has a
Dragon unit.
This unit requires no supply centre to support it,
has a strength of 1.5, may move up to two provinces per
season and can share provinces with other Melnibone units.  It neutralises
supply centres rather than capturing them, and it may not be rebuilt
if destroyed.
<P>
Instead of building a standard unit in a Winter season,
players may order the build of a Mercenary unit.  These units, which may
be either army or Fleet, may be built
in one of 15 designated provinces, two of which are neutral supply
centres and one of which, Sequaloris, is a garrisoned neutral supply centre.
Provided that the build province is vacant the mercanary unit appears
after the Summer retreats.
In order to create confusion as to the ownership
of the mercenary unit, the build order is not listed in the game-report, and
orders for mercenary units are listed at the end of the
report. However, unless two, or more,
players are playing one unit short, ownership will be apparent from the Winter
builds (or rather, the lack thereof).
Each
of the designated provinces can only support one mercenary unit at a time.
The rules do not cover the circumstance in
which two, or more, players order a build in the same province.
Neither do they say whether a Mercenary unit built in Sequaloris is sufficient
to capture this garrisoned supply centre.
<P>
The victory condition is ownership
of 17 supply centres, with Imrryr being a double supply centre.
Four of the supply centres are garrisoned, two of these (Imrryr and Tanelorn)
have double
strength garrison units.  The rules do not say what happens to the garrison
if the supply centre is captured by a hostile power; the usual rule in
these circumstances is that the garrison is destroyed and that it may not
be rebuilt.  In addition the rules do not state whether garrisons may be
supported nor if the strength of the garrison is added to the strength
of any defending unit in the province.
<P>
In addition, the "Abstraction" Army/Fleet rules are used.  When the game was
originally published Steve wrote, "The central
feature of the board is the predominance of sea spaces, when you use
the "Abstraction" A/F rules it [the game] becomes very fast.  For example,
in the first year Melnibone can have a supported attack on a home centre
of four of the other six powers, and an unsupported attack on a home
centre of the other two. You will find that it is as easy for a power
to attack another country across the ocean as it is for it to
attack its next door neighbour.  This fluidity should raise the level
of Diplomacy.  Careful building of mercenary units can make any well
planned stab more effective, for you will be able to control units
behind your victim's line of defence, forcing him to fight on two fronts.
Stalemate lines do not exist on this board."
<P>
<em>Quick Summary:</em>Simple Map/Rule change variant using A/F and Mercenary
build rules to add excitement, fluidity
and to break down stalemate lines.  Several
of the rules should be clarified by the GM before starting a game.
<P>
<B>"Black Blade,"</B> dated January 1986,
is a seven-player variant in which the powers are Ilmiora, Jharkor,
Lormyr, Melnibone, Pan Tang, Pikaryd, and Vilmir.
<P>
Rules 2 through 7 recap several ideas from "Machiavelli":
<SL COMPACT>
<LI>players receive
revenue from the provinces they own,
<LI>the amount of revenue produced
by a province depends upon its status (city, land province,
sea province or capital province),
<LI>capital, city and land provinces are captured
whenever entered, whilst sea provinces generate revenue only if
occupied at the appropriate time
<LI>there are Assassination, Bribe and
Counter-Bribe orders
<LI>garrisoned cities have to be captured by an uninterrupted siege of two
seasons duration,
<LI>it is possible to destroy and rebuild cities,
<LI>money may be borrowed from
a money lender, and
<LI>an army (fleet) unit that is in a city
may convert into a garrison and subsequently convert into a fleet (army).
</SL>
In addition, it is possible to support a support, in which case a single
unsupported attack does not cut the support.
<P>
Rules 8 through 22 flavour the basic Machiavellian stew with exotic flavours
based upon the book. Units in this game are either army, fleet or
garrison, but Melnibone has a <em>triple</em> fleet, known as the Battle
Barge, and Jharkor a double army, representing the White Leopards.  Although
Melnibone, an
island, has several provinces, enemy units can only enter at Imrryr, although
they may order attacks on other provinces of Melnibone to cut support.  The
province of Imryrr is immune to standard bribe orders.
<P>
There are also rules covering the Dragons of Velra, Mordaga's Castle (the
Chaos Shield), the Duke of Chaos (owned by Pan Tang), the Marshes of Mist,
The Silent Lands  (Dharzi spirits), Tanelorn, The Weeping Waste
(The Desert People act as Mercenary armies which can be bought),
Rlin K'ren and A'a Kaneloon (which is Home of Myshella the Sleeping
Sorceress).
<P>
Perhaps reflecting the designer's penchant for free-form
role-playing, this variant has no victory criteria and  there are no rules
covering the the naming of the turns.  A game of this variant was started
in the RPG postal zine <em>Gingwatzim</em> but it was abandoned after a few
seasons of play. It is possible that it was played in <em>LSD</em>,  Rob
Nott's zine.
<P>
<em>Quick Summary:</em> A "Machiavelli"-based game with some exotic rules to
reflect the world portrayed in the books.
<P>
<B>"Young Kingdoms II"</em> is, in the words of the designer, a "total
redesign" of "Young Kingdoms I."
The <a href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/youngk2.htm>rules and map</a>
for the Young Kingdoms II are available via The Diplomatic Pouch's
<a href=/Online/variants.html>variants page</a>.
<P>
The game remains a seven-player game with two changes in the player powers;
The Isle of the Purple
Towns replaces Agrimiliar and Oin-Yu replaces Kurfar.  The Purple Towns
is a two province island, a single supply centre and a double supply centre,
with starting units of a Fleet and an
Army/Fleet.
<P>
Melnibone no longer starts with an army, a fleet and a
Dragon in Imrryr, but instead has an A/F and the Dragon starting there.  This
is a sensible change, to create more fluidity at the start of the game.
The rules for the Dragon Unit are the same as in "Young
Kingdoms I," whilst
the concept of Mercenary Armies has been replaced by
Chaos Units, which are described below. Melnibone still has the problem of only
having one home supply centre, but is no longer "sufficiently well organised"
to merit double units. The game starts in Spring 6480.
<P>
The victory condition is ownership of 18 supply centres, with
Imrryr and Fortress of Evening being double supply centres.  Four of the
supply centres are garrisoned.  The rules now cover the possibility
that garrisoned provinces may be captured by hostile powers,
and also state that garrisons may be supported.  They do not state
if the garrison
adds to the strength of any unit occupying the province.
<P>
"Young Kingdoms II" introduces an Elric personality unit into the game.
Any power who is <B>not</B> allied to Elric may build a Chaos Unit in one
of three specific provinces, provided that any Chaos Unit previously built in
the chosen province is no longer on the board.
The rules do not cover the possibility that two players order a build in
the same province.  The Chaos Unit has to be supported
in the usual way.
Chaos Units can change into a fleet or army at will,
they may not be part of either a multiple unit or an A/F, they neutralise
supply centres they occupy at the end of an Autumn season
rather than capture them, and they are the only unit type which may
enter The Silent Land, The Sighing Desert and Kelmain.  No combat is
permitted within these provinces and Chaos units in these provinces may not
offer support into adjacent provinces.
<P>
Elric is a personality unit which starts the game hidden
in a neutral supply centre determined randomly by the GM.
The first power to discover Elric has the option of
allying with him. Elric is a 0.5 unit which can capture supply centres.
He may not share a province with a Melnibonean unit, and will neither
support a Melnibonean unit nor ally with Melnibone.
If Elric occupies Imrryr, the Melnibonean player is eliminated, the
Melnibonean units are eliminated (including Melnibonean Chaos units if
appropriate), the provinces of Imrryr, The Caves and
Tanelorn become permanently neutral and impassable -- occupying units have to
retreat -- and the victory condition is
reduced to ownership of 16 supply centres.  Control of Elric is lost
either by renouncing him or if he is forced to retreat; in either
instance the GM randomly hides him in one of the neutral supply
centres.
<P>
Elric, Elric-led units, and Chaos Units are the only units which
may enter Tanelorn; Chaos Units destroying Tanelorn in the process.
<P>
<em>Quick Summary:</em>  Simple Map/Rule change variant using the
"Abstraction" A/F rules and Chaos builds to
add excitement and breakdown stalemate lines.
The Elric personality unit is an attempt to recreate the atmosphere
of the book.
<HR>
Which of the three basic designs is best?  "Black Blade" will appeal
to those who prefer the Machiavillian economy to the supply centre
based economy of regular Diplomacy. It also goes the furthest in the creation
of extra rules to recreate the atmosphere of the books.  The use of the
"Machiavelli" economy means that this game requires the most book-keeping
by the GM.
<P>
"The Age of the Young Kingdoms" is a simple map and rule change
variant, reflecting the prevalent fantasy style before "Downfall" achieved
prominence in the 1980's.  The use of spells reflects the attempt  of
several variant designers of the 1970's to merge
Diplomacy with "Dungeons and Dragons."  Although
old, it is by no means either a poor design or an unplayable game.
<P>
Since "The Young Kingdoms I" has not been play-tested
postally, it is not clear which of the rule changes in "The Young Kingdoms II"
represent an improvement in playability. "The Young Kingdoms" variants are the
only designs to make use of the possibilities offered by the A/F rules on
a map which contains a large central section of water;
the A/F rules could easily be included in the other designs.
<P>
In order of complexity we rank the designs:
<OL COMPACT>
<LI>"The Age of the Young Kingdoms"
<LI>"The Young Kingdoms," and
<LI>"Black Blade"
</OL>
although none
of them will require constant reference to the rule book.
<P>
If Mark ever came out
of retirement from Mastering to run one of these variants he would be happy to
run either "The Young Kingdoms" or " The Age of the Young Kingdoms,"
with the addition of the A/F rules to the latter.
If he came out of retirement as a <em>player</em>, he would prefer the former.
<P>
As for Stephen, he thinks it is about time the rules of "Young Kingdoms I"
and "Young Kingdoms II" were clarified in "Young
Kingdoms III," taking out Oin-Yu as a power and replacing it with Pang Tang.

This is the order in which the events happen, but the

as an octology; Moorcock has written new books whenever he needed the
money.  In addition to the above, there is <em>Elric at the End of Time</em>,
which does not fit into the above time sequence.
<P>
You can draw inspiration for your press releases by either
reading the books and/or listening to the music!
Hawkwind released a double LP based upon the Elric novels
called <em>Live Chronicles</em> which was recorded live on the
"Chronicles of the Black Sword" Tour in 1985.
