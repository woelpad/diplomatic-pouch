"All the reasons that led us to conclude that Russia, Turkey,
and England were proof against first-year elimination apply
to Fleet Rome as well as to Standard Diplomacy; but how about
Italy?  Can Italy be eliminated in 1901 in Fleet Rome?
<P>
"In answering this, we observe as before that Fall convoys must
occur into <i>both</i> Rome and Naples.  The fleet that begins at
Naples cannot, then, participate in the convoy into Rome, since
its services will be required to convoy an (Austrian) army into
Naples.  But no foreign army in the Spring can reach a land
province adjacent to the Tyrrhenian Sea -- the only ocean
province the fleet from Rome can reach -- so no convoy into
Rome is possible, and Italy still cannot be eliminated.
<P>
"All the reasons I gave earlier still hold, as to why no two of
France, Germany, and Austria can be eliminated.
<P>
<B>"So we see that even in the Fleet Rome variant, no two powers
can be eliminated in the first year."</B>
