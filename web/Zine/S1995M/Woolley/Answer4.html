Holmes took up a position at the Diplomacy table, pointing,
as he spoke, to the various provinces and units mentioned.  I
record here only his words.
<P>
"Your Lordship, Dr Watson, let me proceed logically bit by bit
and see how many of the initial 22 units I can account for.
<P>
"We know, first, that inland home supply centers <b>must</B> begin the
game with an army, since (by the rules) fleets cannot be placed there.
This fact determines the placement of six armies -- <B>Army Paris,
Army Munich, Army Warsaw, Army Moscow, Army Vienna</B>, and <B>Army
Budapest</B> -- and we have six of the 22 units accounted for.
<P>
"We also know the initial position of the Austrian fleet, as I
pointed out earlier, since Austria has no coastal SC besides
Trieste in which to put his fleet.  Allow me to place <B>Fleet Trieste</B> on
the board.  7 down, 15 to go.
<P>
"Russia, as Dr Watson was so good as to remark, has two fleets
and two coastal SCs.  What the good Doctor missed is that St
Petersburg has two coasts, so the exact initial placement of
the northern fleet is uncertain.  But the Russian
<B>must</B> begin with <B>Fleet Sevastopol</B>.  Eight down.
<P>
"From our reasoning in determining just how France and Austria
came to be eliminated, we know Italy's (and the rest of
France's) initial setups -- Italy's as in the Standard game
(with <B>Fleet Naples, Army Venice, and Army Rome</B>),
France's being <B>Fleet Marseilles, Army Brest</B>, and
Army Paris.  (We already knew about the army in Paris.) Thirteen initial
placements determined!
<P>
"We know that Turkey captured Trieste, and that he did so by a convoy using
his own fleet.  By this, we can conclude that the Turkish fleet did not
begin the game in its usual location at Ankara, and thus that one of the
Turkish armies was placed there.  With <B>Army Ankara</B>, we now have
the initial position of fourteen units determined.
<P>
But Turkey, we now are told, is unable to build in 1901 despite the capture
of Trieste.  So either all his home
supply centers are occupied, or he had no net gain of centers in
the year.  Now it is
<i>impossible</i> for more than one Turkish home SC to have been
captured -- the only foreign units 'in range' and unaccounted for
being the Russian Sevastopol fleet and Moscow army (of course, we know
the Austrian Budapest army didn't convoy in, since Austria was
eliminated); but if the Moscow army took a Turkish SC, the
Russian fleet had to have convoyed it, because the Turkish fleet
(the only other possibility for a convoy in that part of the
world) is engaged in convoying a Turkish army to Trieste.  So
there is at most one foreign unit in Turkey, and at least two
of the Turkish units departed Turkey -- the army to Trieste and the
fleet out to sea for convoy duty.  So we know that Turkey did have
a home SC open in which he could build -- which means, given his inability
to build, that Turkey had no
net gain of SCs.  His gain of Trieste <i>must</i> have been offset by
his loss (definitely to Russia) of either Ankara or Constantinople; and Turkey
certainly captured no other SC besides Trieste.  Hold this thought.
<P>
"Russia captured either Budapest or Vienna from Warsaw (Italy
capturing the other from Venice) -- we know this because
the only other non-Austrian unit that could reach Vienna or
Budapest is the German army from Munich, which (we know)
captured Paris.  And we just determined that Russia captured a
Turkish home SC.  So Russia owned at least two non-Russian SCs
at the end of 1901.
<P>
"But Russia <B>also</B> was unable to build in 1901, and a home SC was
certainly open.  (Moscow is utterly out of foreign range in
1901; Sevastopol is in range from either Austria or Turkey, but
Austria was eliminated and we know Turkey had no net SC gain, so we
know neither Moscow nor Sevastopol was captured.  Furthermore,
we know that neither of the Russian units that began at Warsaw
or St Petersburg ended the year either at Moscow or Sevastopol to
cover those centers to prevent a build there -- the St Petersburg fleet
can't have moved inland, and the
Warsaw army, we know, moved into Austria.  And one or the other of the
two units that began in Moscow and Sevastopol ended the year in
a Turkish SC -- all of which means that at least one Russian
home SC was open.)  We conclude that Russia, like Turkey, had no net SC gain
in 1901, in spite of having taken both an Austrian and a Turkish
home SC; which means that Russia <i>must</i> have lost the only
other two SCs he owned -- Warsaw and St Petersburg!
<P>
"It is simple to see how Warsaw must have been lost -- Berlin
went there.  No other foreign unit is within range (except the
Austrians, and they were eliminated).  So Germany began with
<B>Army Berlin</B> and, consequently, <B>Fleet Kiel</B>, and we have deduced
initial placements for sixteen units.
<P>
"But how was St Petersburg captured?  By convoy, certainly, but
from where?  The German fleet in Kiel could have moved into the
Baltic Sea in the Spring, and the St Petersburg fleet into the
Gulf of Bothnia -- but there's no army anywhere around for them
to carry into St Petersburg.  (Munich went to Paris, remember,
and Berlin to Warsaw.)  So the convoy into St Petersburg must
have been a <i>northern</I> one, through (at least) the Norwegian
Sea and the Barents Sea, involving units beginning the year
(respectively) as <B>Fleet Edinburgh</B> and <B>Fleet St Petersburg (north
coast)</B>.
Two more initial placements known -- our total is now eighteen!
<P>
"The army that convoyed to St Petersburg <i>must</I> have been the
English one.  (The only other armies unaccounted for are French,
and France was eliminated.)  Which leaves only the second
English fleet as the unit that took Brest; which in turn
means that this second English fleet began as <B>Fleet London</B>, since it
couldn't have reached Brest from Liverpool in two moves.  The
English army, then, had to begin as <B>Army Liverpool</B>.  (We also
know this from the fact that Liverpool is the only starting location from
which an English army could setup to convoy in Fall 1901 through the
Norwegian Sea.)  Twenty known; two still uncertain.
<P>
"In fact, the only initial placements not known are those of the Turkish
units which set up on the Mediterranean coast -- one a fleet and the other
an army.  But consider -- we're told
that three neutrals were occupied on the Spring move.  Which
units did the occupying?
<P>
"Not the St Petersburg fleet by a move to Norway -- we know it moved to the
Barents Sea.
Not Marseilles by occupying Spain -- it moved to the Gulf of Lyon.  Not
Sevastopol moving to Rumania -- it moved either to the Black Sea or to
Armenia, which we know because it was involved in capturing a Turkish home SC
in the Fall.  There are only three remaining units that could
possibly have occupied a neutral in the Spring -- the Kiel
fleet, moving to Denmark or Holland; the Budapest army, moving
to Serbia or Rumania; and a Turkish unit in Constantinople,
moving to Bulgaria.
<P>
"But we <i>know</i> this Turkish unit from Constantinople was not the
fleet, since the Turkish fleet moved in Spring into either
the Aegean Sea or the Eastern Mediterranean, there to convoy an
army to Trieste in the Fall.  So Turkey began the game with
<B>Army Constantinople</B> (we don't know whether this is the army which
convoyed to Trieste, or whether it moved back to Constantinople
in the Fall -- these are the only two choices for this unit which 
cooperate in the requirement not to increase the Turkish supply center count),
and <b>Fleet Smyrna</b>.
