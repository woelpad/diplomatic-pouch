"Attend closely, Watson," said Holmes, "and you will just
possibly learn something of my methods.  First, let us ask
again, but this time with respect to 'Flexible Setup', which
individual powers can possibly be eliminated in 1901?
<P>
"Russia cannot be.  Still, no unit could take Moscow.
<P>
"Turkey still cannot be.  A Russian unit (or the Austrian army
from Budapest) could reach either Constantinople or Ankara, and
an army (Italian or Austrian) could be convoyed into either
Constantinople or Smyrna; but there is no way for a third
foreign unit to reach a third Turkish home SC.
<P>
"England is still proof against first-year elimination.  To
eliminate England, one English fleet would have to begin at
Edinburgh and be occupied in the Fall in convoying a foreign
army <i>into</I> Edinburgh, since no other fleet can reach either
the Norwegian Sea or the North Sea in the Spring.  The other
English fleet must start the game at Liverpool and be cooperating in
Fall with the French fleet (from Brest) in convoying a foreign army
into Liverpool.  But no other fleet (besides the two English and the
one French) can have reached a position adjacent to London, so no fleet
can either capture London or convoy an army into London in the Fall.
<P>
"Nor can Italy be eliminated.  The same reasoning applies
with equal force as before, as Rome still must be taken by convoy;
note that Rome cannot be reached
overland by an Austrian army beginning the year in Trieste,
because the Austrian fleet would then have to have begun inland
-- a violation of the Flexible Setup rules.
<P>
"France, Austria, and Germany are still vulnerable as before;
if a series of events is possible under Standard rules, it
remains possible under Flexible Setup, since it is possible
for every unit to begin a Flexible Setup game in its Standard
location.
<P>
"But now we ask, can any <b>two</b> of these be eliminated?
<P>
"Our reasonings regarding the first two pairs of powers apply
just as before.  France and Germany cannot both be eliminated
in 1901; nor can Germany and Austria.
<P>
"But France and Austria <B>can</B> both be eliminated!  The key here
is to realize that with Flexible Setup, there is a third unit
(besides Munich and Venice) that could take Marseilles -- one of the
Italian armies can convoy in!
But if an Italian army
convoys into Marseilles -- and remember that the other Italian
army must take either Vienna or Budapest (Warsaw taking the
other, and Munich taking Paris) -- how can the capture of Trieste (which was
the task we had assigned to this second Italian army in our discussion of
Austrian elimination in a standard game) possibly be
effected?  Only by a Turkish army, convoyed by <B>three</B> fleets
-- the Turkish fleet in the Aegean Sea or the Eastern
Mediterranean, the Italian fleet in the Ionian Sea, and the
Austrian fleet in the Adriatic Sea!"
<P>
I was speechless.  Holmes continued.
<P>
"We still have to answer the question, though, as to which
Italian province contains a unit in Spring 1901?
<P>
"We know that the Italian fleet must move in Spring into the
Ionian Sea to be ready for the Turkish convoy in the Fall, and
likewise that an Italian army must start in Venice and move
immediately into Trieste or Tyrolia, preparatory to taking
either Vienna or Budapest in the Fall.  So the Italian army
that is to convoy into Marseilles must begin in Rome and move
to a location from which it can be convoyed by the single
French fleet, no other fleet being available to help with the
convoy -- and that French fleet must have begun at Marseilles.
<P>
"Now the French fleet is necessarily in the Gulf of Lyon, the
only ocean province to which it could have moved in the Spring.
So the convoyed army must have moved from Rome to Tuscany in
the Spring, Tuscany being the only land province adjacent both
to Rome and to the Gulf of Lyon.
<P>

<B>"So we see that France and Austria are the only two powers which can both be
eliminated in 1901, and that Tuscany -- and no other Italian province --
contains a unit after the Spring movement!"</B>
