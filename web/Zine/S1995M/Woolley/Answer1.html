"Why <i>impossible</i>, Holmes?" I asked.  "I've never seen it
happen, and it might be very unlikely, but it seems as though,
cooperating in their own demise, it should be at least
<i>possible</i> for two powers to be eliminated in the first year."
<P>
"Watson, Watson, illogical as ever!  'It seems as though'!
Think, man!  In affairs of this sort, logic, not emotion, not
'seeming,' should govern us.  Now let us <i>think</i>, and leave
seeming behind.
<P>
"In considering the possible events in 1901, observe first that
no fleet can end the year more than two spaces from where it
began; that no army can do so, either, unless it is convoyed;
and that no convoy can take place in the Spring (since all the
fleets begin in coastal provinces and a fleet in a coastal
province cannot convoy).  These things being so, let us focus
and clarify our thinking on the point by asking ourselves this
question --
<P>
<B>"Which individual powers <i>can</i> be eliminated in 1901?</B>
<P>
"First, it is most easily seen that Russia cannot suffer a
first-year elimination, since it is impossible to convoy into
landlocked Moscow, and no foreign unit begins the year within
two spaces of Moscow.
<P>
"Neither, secondly, can Turkey be.  Smyrna is completely
unreachable in 1901 by foreign units; no unit sets up close
enough to reach it by land, and no fleet can reach the
necessary convoying position in the Aegean Sea (or the Eastern
Mediterranean) in the Spring.
<P>
"Nor, as a third, can England.  A foreign army would have to
arrive in Liverpool by convoy in the Fall -- but no fleet of
any nationality can reach either the North Atlantic Ocean
or the Irish Sea in the Spring, and so no Fall convoy into
Liverpool is possible.
<P>
"Fourthly, Italy is safe.  Foreign armies would have to convoy
into both Rome and Naples in the Fall (since none starts close
enough to reach either SC by land), requiring the presence of
convoying fleets both in the Tyrrhenian Sea and in the Ionian
Sea.  But the only fleet that could reach either province is
the one from Naples, which could convoy an army into at most one of
them; so Rome and Naples cannot both be taken."
<P>
I was flabbergasted.  "Holmes, this is excellent!  It seems so
simple when you explain your reasoning, but I'm sure I never
could have deduced what you conclude so easily.  What about the
remaining powers, though -- France, Germany, and Austria?"
<P>
"The odd fact about them, Watson, is that any one of them might
be eliminated in 1901, but no two of them can be.  Follow
closely.
<P>
"France can be eliminated -- either the Liverpool army or the
London fleet could reach Brest, for instance (as, in fact,
could either German army); the army from Munich can take Paris;
and Marseilles is in range both from Venice and from Munich.
<P>
"Austria could be eliminated.  Vienna can be taken from Munich,
Venice, or Warsaw; Budapest from Venice or Warsaw; and Trieste
from Rome, Venice, or Munich.
<P>
"And Germany could be eliminated as well.  Paris, Marseilles,
Venice, or Vienna could any one of them reach Munich; Kiel
can be taken by any of the armies beginning in Moscow, Warsaw,
Liverpool, or Paris; and (even given that the German fleet is
busy convoying an army into Kiel) Berlin is still within range
of Warsaw.
<P>
"So the only powers susceptible to elimination in 1901 are
France, Austria, and Germany.  But, as I said, no <B>two</B> of them
can be eliminated -- we see this by considering the three 'in
pairs' as it were.
<P>
"The only unit that can capture Paris is the German army from
Munich.  So either France or Germany will hold Paris at the
end of the year; and so France and Germany cannot both be
eliminated in 1901.
<P>
"Germany and Austria cannot both be eliminated.  The only non-German
units that can capture Vienna and Budapest are the
armies that start in Warsaw and Venice.  (Munich is out of the
question as a conquering army, of course, since we are trying
to find a way to eliminate Germany as well as Austria.)  So the
Warsaw army must end the year in an Austrian SC -- but then no
other unit could take Berlin, unless it were convoyed there by
the German fleet (the only fleet that can move into the Baltic
Sea in the Spring and so be able to convoy an army to Berlin in
the Fall).  But if the German fleet is convoying into Berlin,
there remains no way to convoy an army into Kiel; either Kiel
or Berlin must remain untaken; and Germany is not eliminated.
<P>
"Finally, it is impossible that France and Austria should both
be eliminated.  Since Munich must go to Paris, only Venice is
left to capture Marseilles.  But that would leave the Warsaw
army as the only foreign unit within range of either Vienna or
Budapest; and so one or the other must remain untaken.
<P>
<B>"And so we see, Watson, that no two powers can be eliminated in
1901."</B>
