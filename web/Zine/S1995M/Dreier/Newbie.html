<H1><center>Running Newbie<BR>E-Mail Games</H1></center>
<h2><center><em>Jamie Dreier</em></center></h2>
<HR>

The e-mail version of the Diplomacy hobby is seeing a surge of interest
these days. Each week a few newcomers post to the
<samp><B>rec.games.diplomacy</samp></B> newsgroup asking for information
on how to become involved. As a consequence, there is a growing need for
games catering to newcomers. Herein a few notes on my experiences GM'ing
such games.
<P>
Any GM ought to read the
<A HREF="http://www.ugcs.caltech.edu/~roustk/judge/data/master.html">
help file, available from the judges, on Mastering
a game</A>. Since I assume all potential GM's will be experienced in obtaining
judge files, I'll just leave this part to you (or, to make it easy
on you, you could click on the
hotlink found in the previous sentence)!
<P>
I first distinguish between newcomers to the game of Diplomacy, on the one
hand, and newcomers to the e-mail world, on the other. If you're GM'ing a
game for people who have never played Diplomacy, or who have played only a
game or two, you'll need to explain a good deal more than you have to say
when the players have some Diplomacy experience but are somewhat dazzled by
the judges. Most of the notes below are aimed at helping newbies to the
net or at least to the play of Diplomacy through it.

<HR>
<H3>Setting Up And Signing On</H3>

<samp>CREATE</samp> a game, <samp>BECOME master</samp>, and <samp>SET</samp>
a <samp>COMMENT</samp> for the game, explaining
(briefly) that it is intended for newcomers.
<P>
Personally, I like to <samp>SET ALL PRESS</samp>. For one thing, it's always
fun to
watch. But for a newbie game, it can be functional, too. You'll be able
to keep an eye out to see whether anyone's negotiating past the deadline
(which is against House Rules).
<P>
Notices of forming Newbie games should be posted to r.g.d. It would be
unwise to expect newcomers to know how to list forming games from the
judges. It's helpful to scan the newsgroup for recent requests from
newbies, and write to each poster announcing the formation of your game. In
your mail and in your newsgroup posting, include your e-mail address
explicitly and tell anyone interested to write to you directly if they
don't know how to <samp>SIGNON</samp>.
<P>
Explain to all interested parties just how to <samp>REGISTER</samp>, how to
<samp>SIGNON</samp>, and
also how to <samp>SET PREFERENCE</samp>s. Thereafter, explanations can be
via <samp>BROADCAST</samp>.

<HR>
<H3>The Gamestart</H3>

I strongly urge GM's of newbie games to keep a list of players' addresses.
If the judge goes down (cf. <A HREF="#Outages">below</A>), newbies are not
likely to know what's happening.
<P>
Write a <samp>BROADCAST</samp>, saying hi, and explaining the basics of press.
Also explain how to <samp>GET HELP</samp> (and other) files from the judge.
Point out the deadline, and the period which you <samp>SET</samp> for the
<samp>DEADLINE</samp> calculations for future moves.
<P>
Don't assume that anything is obvious from the help files. Newcomers to the
e-mail world are going to be confused, as a matter of course, by lengthy
explanations of syntax. I recommend giving short, basic introductions to
the main topics, oversimplifying if necessary. For example, to explain how
press works, give a very simple example of how to send press to France. I
got several requests for clarification of how to send press to the GM, so
it's wise to explain that too. In particular, one player thought that
<PRE>   press to gm</PRE>
would do it. Fortunately, he realized that there was a possibility that the
press would go to Germany!
<P>
A simple, basic example will get them started. Once they've internalized
the simple case, the rest of the <samp>HELP</samp> file will be vastly more
comprehensible.
<P>
Similar remarks apply to order syntax. Giving an example of a move order,
and a convoy order, and a support order will prove much more helpful than the
big help file for <samp>syntax</samp>.

<HR>
<H3>Answering the Frequently Asked Questions</H3>

<DL>
<DT><B>How do I interpret that confusing mass of garbage that's supposed to
indicate the deadline calculation?</B>
<DD>The main thing to explain here is the <samp>NEXT</samp> parameter. If
anyone is interested, explain the <samp>CLOCK</samp> parameter, too. (This is
likely to come up, because at some point a deadline will be set further in the
future than expected. I didn't really understand this myself! I bet few GM's
do.  Suppose the <samp>NEXT</samp> parameter is set to 72 hours. When a move
is processed after 23:30 [the default for <samp>CLOCK</samp>], say on a Monday,
the judge won't set the next deadline for Thursday 23:30, but rather for
<em>Friday</em>. GM's can work it all out from
<A HREF="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/usr/ss8c/dip/deadline.html">
the <samp>deadline</samp> file</A>
and explain it.)

<DT><B>What is a Dedication Rating?</B>
<DD>The short, sweet explanation is that everyone starts with a dedication of
zero, gains 3 points every time he or she submits a move on time, and loses a
point for every lateness day. Abandoning costs 100 points, a deficit
difficult to recover from. Mention that it is reasonable to ask for
deadline extensions, and that most GM's will grant any reasonable request.

<DT><B>How can I find out the current position?</B>
<DD>It might be good to mention the <samp>LIST</samp> command right off the
bat, without waiting for someone to ask.
</DL>

<HR>
<H3>Some Things They'll Never Think To Ask About</H3>
It's a good idea to explain the following three things, maybe during a lull
in the game, or between the game start and the processing of the first move.
<OL>
<LI>The <samp>HISTORY</samp> command
<LI><samp>GET SUMMARY</samp>
<LI><samp>SET WAIT</samp> (actually, some people do get the idea on their own)
</OL>
<HR>
<H3>The First Move</H3>
When more than one of the players is a newcomer to Diplomacy, I think it's
very valuable, and worth the effort, to post a short discussion of all of
the opening moves. I used the <em>Gamers' Guide</em> second edition. If you
stick to fairly standard analysis, you're in less danger of ruining someone's
carefully planned surprise. It ought to go without saying that comments on
play should not influence the outcome of the game any more than you can
avoid.

<HR>
<A NAME=Outages>
<H3>When The Judge Goes Down</H3>
First, write to the players. (If you have newbie observers, write to them,
too. I forgot to do this in my games. Stupid of me.)
<P>
Explain that the things usually come back up in a few hours.
<P>
Ask them <B>not</B> to send tons of mail to the judge testing to see whether
it's back. When a judge goes down, it will come back up to find a very
large queue of mail, and its first priority will be to empty that queue.
The judge won't process moves until it gets through its mail queue. So
sending lots of mail will only postpone the processing of moves. It would be
just great if <em>experienced</em> judge-users would pay attention to this
rather obvious fact. Let's try to educate a new generation, shall we?
<P>
Point out that they can continue to negotiate via direct e-mail while they
await the return of the judge.
<P>
This would be a good time to spring any amusing pastimes you've saved up. I
like to pose some map questions, such as the following
<UL COMPACT>
<LI>Which spaces border the largest number of supply centers?
<LI>Which spaces border the smallest number of supply centers?
<LI>Which neutral centers can the various powers <em>guarantee</em> for
themselves in the first year by making the right opening moves? And which
power has no such 'safe center'?
</UL>
Players seemed to enjoy these.

<HR>
<H3>In Closing....</H3>
As this goes to press, both of my newcomer games are still in progress. No
doubt some important new issues will come up. I will keep you posted.
<P>
In a short separate contribution to this issue, I explain, in a way intended
to be understandable to newcomers to the game (not merely to the net),
<A HREF="NoTheory.html">why there is no opening theory to speak of in
Diplomacy</A>. Players in my games seemed to find this interesting. It's a
good deal more controversial than the banal and mundane notes above, but I
hereby release it to the public domain.
