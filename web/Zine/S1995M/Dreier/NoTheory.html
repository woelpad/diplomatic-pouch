<H1><center>The Lack of Opening<BR>Theory in Diplomacy</H1></center>
<h2><center><em>Jamie Dreier</em></center></h2>
<HR>
This is an essay I wrote for and distributed to players in my Newbie game,
<samp>younguns</samp>. I had given the players some standard (<em>Gamers'
Guide</em> Second Edition) comments on their opening moves, but said that I
would not comment much after that. I decided to explain why not: why there is
nothing general and standard and useful to say about openings beyond the
relatively simple remarks from the <em>Gamers' Guide</em>.
<P>
I believe there are two reasons. It is instructive to compare Diplomacy
with chess, which has voluminous opening theory, and with backgammon, which
has much less, but still a substantial amount of opening theory.
<P>
There is an extremely obvious difference between Diplomacy, on the one
hand, and chess and backgammon, on the other, and that is the number of
players. Two player games are not susceptible to coalitions. Everything
that's good for one player, in chess or backgammon, is bad for "every
other" player in the same game. And this means that tactics dominate those
games completely. Once you find the tactically best move, you know what
your best move is. It is a mistake in Diplomacy to assume that the
tactically best move is the overall best move. Let me explain by an
example.
<P>
Tactically speaking, it is almost <em>always</em> better to have more centers
than fewer. That is, comparing two possible future positions, you should almost
always prefer the one in which you have more centers, from the tactical
point of view. But it is a notorious fact that for some powers, rapid early
expansion is to be avoided like the plague. This is a consideration for
every power, but for some more than others. Russia is especially
vulnerable. If Russia gains four centers in the first two years, she looks
so big and threatening that she is likely to attract a coalition against
her. Even an eight-center Russia cannot survive a concerted attack by England,
Austria, and Turkey (say). In the endgame this matter is even more touchy
than in the opening.
<P>
Besides rate of growth, there is commitment to an ally. It is pretty easy
to see why the Churchill opening is superior, tactically speaking, to
<samp><B>A LVP-YOR</samp></B>.  <samp><B>LVP-EDI</samp></B> preserves the
possibility of convoying across <samp>NWG</samp>, and has no
tactical disadvantages compared to <samp><B>LVP-YOR</samp></B>. But, England
might wish to
signal an intent to ally with Germany. She might hope to persuade Germany
to move against Russia, or at least to remain neutral in a coming war
against Russia. <samp><B>LVP-YOR</samp></B> almost proves that England will be
convoying across <samp>NTH</samp>, likely
leaving <samp>NWG</samp> free to move to the Barents Sea, and ruling out
<samp><B>NTH-DEN</samp></B>, <samp><B>NTH-HOL</samp></B>, or
<samp>NTH</samp> moving into or supporting a French move into Belgium. If
diplomatic
considerations favor alliance with Germany, <samp><b>LVP-YOR</samp></B>
may be preferable to
the Churchill, despite its tactical inferiority.

<HR>
So this is one main reason that there is little in the way of opening
theory in Diplomacy. Whatever tactical considerations might be adduced,
they can always be swamped by diplomatic ones. And diplomatic
considerations are much less susceptible to analysis, depending as they do
on psychology, and on extremely complex factors.
<P>
Now for the second reason, a less obvious one. Allan Calhamer, Diplomacy's
creator, said that there is no luck in Diplomacy after the initial random
assignment of powers. He was mistaken. Diplomacy does have lots of luck in
it. Let's see why.
<P>

To fix ideas, take this fairly common scenario. Turkey has made peace in
the opening with her neighbors, leaving her free to sail out into the
Mediterranean. Getting the jump on Italy, and probably with an assist from
an Austrian fleet in Greece, Turkey dislodges the Italian fleet in Ionian,
which retreats to <samp>TYS</samp>. Italy, let's suppose, has no army
available to
defend Naples. Turkey has two main options. She can order
<samp><b>ION-TUN</samp></b>, or
<samp><b>ION-NAP</samp></b>. (<samp><B>ION-TYS</samp></B> might be good, too,
but let's suppose Turkey feels she
needs the immediate build if possible.) Italy also has two options: she can
defend <samp>TUN</samp> with <samp><B>TYS-TUN</samp></B>, or she can defend
<samp>NAP</samp> with <samp><B>TYS-NAP</samp></b>.
<P>
Now, which is the better move for Turkey? Well, there <em>is</em> no better
move.
Suppose <samp><B>ION-NAP</samp></B> were better. Then Italy
would be able to tell that it was.
So Italy would order <samp><B>TYS-NAP</samp></B>. That means
<samp><B>ION-NAP</samp></B> is not as good as <samp><B>ION-TUN</samp></B>,
for obvious reasons! Likewise, <samp><B>ION-TUN</samp></b> could not be the
'better' move.
There is no "better move," <em>tout court</em>, here; there are only
<OL>
<LI>the better move given that Italy orders <samp><B>TYS-NAP</samp></B>, and
<LI>the better move given that she orders <samp><B>TYS-TUN</samp></B>.
</OL>
And Turkey doesn't know which Italy will order.
<P>
Technically speaking, Turkey must adopt a "mixed strategy." This is a term
from game theory. It means that Turkey should be introducing a randomizing
factor, say, the toss of a coin. (It could be a weighted coin -- maybe Turkey
believes that taking <samp>NAP</samp> will be more damaging to Italy than
would taking <samp>TUN</samp>, and so will weight her coin toward the
<samp>NAP</samp> side. But her ideal tactical mixed strategy must give
<B>some</B> chance to <samp><B>ION-TUN</samp></B>, and some to
<samp><B>ION-NAP</samp></B>.)  Note that Italy is also forced into the same
strategy.
<P>
The luck factor is now obvious. To take an Italian center, Turkey must be
lucky. To hold all her centers, Italy must be lucky. Luck <em>does</em> play
a role in Diplomacy.
<P>
<B>Technical Note:</B>
I have just explained the fact that Diplomacy is a "game of imperfect
information." This is another term from game theory. The idea is this: when you
submit your orders, you don't know what orders others will submit. From the
perspective of the game theoretician, you could pretend that all other players'
orders have already been submitted and plotted on the board, but you can't
see the board. You have to make your move in partial ignorance of the
current position. You have imperfect information. Since chess has
sequential moves, it is a game of perfect information. Backgammon should be
thought of as an imperfect information game, because each player is
ignorant of the dice rolls. Imagine that a thousand rolls of the dice for
each player are made in advance, but the players can't see what they are.
They are revealed one at a time. Think of these as part of the position,
and you see a parallel with Diplomacy.
<P>
The luck factor in Diplomacy makes the combinations of opening strategies
explode. There are infinitely many possibilities! France could order
<samp><B>MAR-BUR</samp></B>, or <samp><B>MAR-SPA</samp></B>, or
<samp><B>MAR S PAR-BUR</samp></B> (among the plausible openings).
That's three. But she could also toss a coin to decide between
<samp><B>MAR-BUR</samp></B> and
<samp><B>MAR-SPA</samp></B>. And she could give the coin any one of an
infinite number of weightings.
<P>
This explosion of possibilities threatens to make opening theory
unmanageable. The explosion can be tamed to some extent, temporarily.
Compare backgammon, where first moves for each possible opening dice roll
are well-analyzed, but there is virtually no opening theory after that.
Diplomacy is similar. Both are games of imperfect information, where luck
is a factor, and the variety of probabilities leaves analysis in the dust.
<P>
I believe that these two factors -- the combinatorial explosion engendered by
the information imperfection and the infection of tactics by
considerations of allegiance, coalition, and diplomacy -- are what make the
game so interesting; that these are responsible for the remarkable absence
of useful opening theory in Diplomacy.
<P>
To conclude the lesson, let me remind and warn you that this is <B>my</B>
view, and is not a matter of well-established Diplomacy lore like the
<em>Gamers' Guide</em> commentary.
<P>
Even so, I think I'm right.
<P>
Fight on,
<P>
