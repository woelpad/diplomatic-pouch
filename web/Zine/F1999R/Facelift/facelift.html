<dt><b><a href=/Zine>The Zine and the Front Page</a>
	<br>By <a href=mailto:manus@manushand.com>Manus Hand</a></b>
<dd>
Well, the Zine (as you can tell) continues essentially unchanged.  As
for the front page, we have a minor reorganization planned, in response
to some recent complaints that The Pouch is not newbie-friendly enough.
In true Manus Hand fashion, I roped one newbie who made this kind of
report into creating a "Newbies' Guide to The Pouch."  Hopefully he
will have this to me sometime soon and The Pouch will be as newbie-friendly
as we all want it to be.  With the Hasbro re-issues, the number of newcomers
to The Pouch and the hobby has already started to climb.  Just as we all
hoped.

	<br>By <a href=mailto:doug@diplom.org>Doug Massey</a></b>
<dd>
We've reorganized the E-Mail section a bit, in the great tradition
of moving a bunch of existing stuff around to make it look original.
Primarily, the E-Mail section now has a bit of hierarchy to it:  the
main page has one link for new players and one link for experienced
players.  The new players are "treated" to a monologue about their
various options for on-line play and given further links where they
can investigate those options and embark on their on-line Diplomacy
careers.  The veterans are given links to the various on-line 
resources that comprised the previous incarnation of the Email section 
-- the ratings systems, the subject index, etc.  We felt that the
newbie shouldn't be immediately exposed to so many details . . .
<P>
With the release of Hasbro's computer game, the hobby is likely to 
experience an influx of new players.  Since the game is, apparently,
still most enjoyable with seven human players, the new E-Mail section
will hopefully help bring them together with like-minded dippers 
around the world.

<dt><b><a href=/Showcase>The Showcase Section</a>

<!--
Whew, with my update to the Showcase in place, the WhatsNew file
updated, and bigger plans in motion I no longer have to feel guilty
whenever I think 'diplomacy'.  Here's the showcase blurb:
<P>
-->
Even the slowest changing (most neglected?) section of The Pouch
has undergone a few changes.  The main page has been
redone to be slightly more attractive, marginally more navigable, and
infinitely less seizure inducing (fewer animations). 
<P>
In addition to looking nicer, the new summaries for each showcase
include a link to an archive file containing all the files within that
showcase.  This feature has been requested by a number of people --
though I can't for the life of me figure out why.
<p>
Let me know what you would like to see in the Showcase, and as always,
feel free to point me at games that deserve to be put into the fishbowl.

<P><dt><b><a href=/Openings>The Openings List</a>
<br>by <a href=mailto:graaff@diplom.org>Hans de Graaf</a></b>
<dd>
The Openings List will soon offer maps in two different
formats. Currently the list offers PostScript maps. They have a few
nice properties, such as easy printing and good scalability, but it
requires a PostScript viewer to view them on-screen. Since there is no
single graphics format that covers all the advantages, maps will now
appear in two formats: PDF and PNG. PDF has most of the properties of
PostScript such as easy printing and scalability, and many people have
already set up their browsers for viewing PDFs. PNG is a pixel-based
format supported by modern browsers that can be displayed directly in
the browser. Will the PostScript format stay? That is up to you: let
me know.

<P><dt><b><a href=/Online>Online Resources</a>
<br>by <a href=mailto:simon@diplom.org>Simon Szykman</a></b>
<dd>
The Online Resources section has undergone a total renovation.  Among
the changes are a complete facelift with brand a brand new appearance.
The new appearance includes improved navigation within a section, visual
cues (arrows and highlighting) to help identify where you are.  To make
finding the information you are looking for easier, the content has been
revised in addition to the improved navigation. All the main section
pages have been updated, with some links removed, new ones added, and
content of the sectional generally reorganized to be more coherent.
Comments and feedback are welcome.

<P><dt><b><a href=/Postal>The Postal Section</a>
<br>by <a href=mailto:stephen@diplom.org>Stephen Agar</a></b>
<dd>
The Postal section has been streamlined (well, all the references to
dead zines have been stripped out) and it is hoped that it will soon be
restocked with the details of those thriving enthusiastic postal zines.
With the help of John Harrington it is intended that the zine listings
will all include a brief review, rather than just the bare bones. Truth
to tell though, with the growth of the Internet, times are hard for
postal Diplomacy.
<P>
We're considering a rather major rework that would put all zines (postal
and electronic) into a single section. (The current Postal Section would become
the Zines section.)  What would you think of that?  Should "zines"
in a particular medium be kept together (of course, some 'zines now operate
in more than one medium).
or should things be categorised by content rather than by the means
of distribution? Please let me know so that my section of The Pouch can be
as useful as possible to you.
Personally, I think that what Pouch surfers are looking for is
content. Detaching postal zines from the rest just makes it less
likely people will consider their unique selling points (and they do
still have some!).


<P><dt><b><a href=/Face>The Face-To-Face Section</a>

<br>and <a href=mailto:tim@diplom.org>Tim Richardson</a>
</b>
<dd>
There are a few interesting things going on in the
Face-To-Face section.  The
front page of the section looks the same as it has for
months; both of us agree that at this point an
"Ain't broke, don't fix it" approach is appropriate for the
front end!
<P>
Tim has faithfully maintained the Upcoming conventions
page, a fact which makes Matt eternally grateful! For Matt's
part, he's been woking on an ambitious process of taking The
Pouch's tradition of collecting FTF results to the next
level.
<P>
Matt's contributions, in turn, make Tim grateful.  Matt has done
all of the reoganization, reformatting
of the results section -- especially the ADR work.  It's everything Time wanted
to do, but never had the time or technical ability to pull off.  With Matt
around, the FTF Hobby has a new ally at the Pouch!
<P>
We continue to keep the Clubs and Organizations list updated.  Please let
us know if the information there changes or if new groups spring up!
<P>
Over the last few months, results from about  fifty new
convention announcements have been added to the Pouch, with more coming
in every day. As we type this, Tim has a stack of 20 or 30
more conventions sitting on his piano that he hopes to have up
soon!
<P>
We're also proud that the Pouch is displaying results from the
ADR Grand Prix. This is Buz Eddy's North American answer to the very
popular Swedish Diplomacy Rally.
<P>
Expect a slow and steady of Diplomacy records to collect on
the Pouch over the coming months. Results, stories, and
announcements are all welcomed. If it's information about
FTF Dip, it has a home at The Pouch!
