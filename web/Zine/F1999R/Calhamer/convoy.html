Dear Manus,
The computer I was using bollixed after I got one letter off to you.
I was in the middle of one on the subject of alternate convoy routes
when the thing went into irrelevant mode and wouldn't respond to input.
I'm enclosing an opinion on the alternate convoy rule.  I wrote it up
separately because it seemed worth sending also to a few print publishers.
A fan named David Partridge also e-mailed me, from rebhuhn@rocketmail.com,
with what seemed to be the same argument about alternate convoys, leaning
heavily on the analogy with the support order.  I didn't get a chance to
respond to him, before the library version of Y2K took over.  If you had
a spare minute you might contact him and send my regrest.  I would send
him the accompanying letter, but I don't have his postoffice address.
Best regards,
(sig)
Allan
Then the opinion letter:
-->
<H1 align=center>On Convoy Path Specification</H1>

<H3>What This Is</H3>
As a longtime devoted e-mail player, your humble publisher approached
the inventor of The Game with a suggestion that the Internet "judge"
computer's convoy syntax be adopted for the Hasbro computer and board game.
<P>
For those of you who may be unaware of the judge's syntax, and with my
reasons for preferring it over any other convoy syntax, I reproduce my
letter to Mr. Calhamer, and then his response.
<P>
<HR>
<H3 align=center><font color=red>My Inquiry</font></H3>
Allan:
<P>
As you might be aware, I was asked to proof-read the game manual for
the Hasbro CD-ROM and to contribute a couple of articles to it.
Like tens of thousands of others, I have played for years using Internet
judge computers, which require a convoying army to specify its convoy path,
thus:
<dd><tt>A Lon - NTH - Bel</tt></dd><br>
This took just a little getting used to, as I had of course played
face-to-face without this little nuance.  However, the convention is so
extremely useful (not only to the computer but to avoid ugly points of
the rules) that the multitudes of online players quickly find themselves
swearing by it.
<P>
This rule avoids all the "unwanted convoy" problems.  The only "tactic"
it removes (assuming that the kidnap convoy is not a tactic that should
be condoned -- and I have heard from Edi Birsan that you have come out
against it; yay!) is the provision for multiple convoy routes.  For
example:
<tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	A Lon - Bel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	F NTH C A Lon - Bel<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;	F ENG C A Lon - Bel<br>
</tt>
(with the convoy going through [per the 1982 rules] even if one of the
fleets is dislodged -- as you know, the 1976 rule had the convoy failing).
<P>
There are two schools of thought on this:
<ol>
<li><b>Multiple routes should not be allowed anyway.</b><br>
	The provision for multiple routes, and allowing the army to
	follow whichever route is not disrupted is analogous to the
	situation of having to guess which opposing unit is supporting
       and which is moving.  It seems to those in this position that
       the ability to have extra routes should <i>not</i> be allowed, since
       it effectively means you don't have to guess in a situation in
       which, elsewhere on the board, you <i>would</i> have to guess.
<P>
<li><b>Multiple routes should be allowed but...</b><br>
       These people have no problem with the judge computer's rule
       to specify a route, because the fact is that the wish to specify
       multiple routes is so <i>extremely</i> rare that, in practice,
       the issue never comes up.  However, they stand on principle
       that -- since multiple routes are allowed by the face-to-face
       rulebook, they should be allowed by the judge computers.
</ol>
My question to you is: In which school of thought would you
count yourself?
<P>
It seems to those of us who are familiar with the judge computer's syntax
that it might should be adopted by you and Hasbro if you like it.  The
reason being that it completely eliminates all ambuiguity in orders.
Frankly, the part in the rules which forbids ambiguous orders has always
seemed to me to be contradicted by the fact that orders like:
<dd><table>
<tr><td><tt>England:<br>France:<br>Germany:
<td><tt>
    A Bel-Hol<br>
    A Hol-Bel<br>
    F NTH C A Bel-Hol</table></dd>
are considered valid.  That seems very ambiguous to me.  It may be a kidnap
but it may be Germany helping his Anglo-French partners swap centers.
<P>
I have heard that you are in favor, in this case, of requiring any army
that could reach its destination overland but wishes to do so by convoy
to actually <i>specify</i> that it wishes to be convoyed.  I think this is an
excellent decision.
<P>
I am writing to ask if you would consider extending that requirement, for
the sake of consistency and simplicity, to adopt the judge computer's rule
that the full convoy <i>path</i> be specified in the army's order.
<P>
I myself am currently in school of thought #1, and do not consider
myself a big fan of allowing multiple convoy routes.  I am curious to hear
your opinion on these issues.
<P>
I did not bring the judge computer's solution up with Hasbro since it
is non-Calhamerian and I knew they were taking direction from you.  But
now that the hobby is generally aware of the contents of the game manuals,
there has been an expression of sentiment for making an attempt to get
the nice, clean solution of the judge computer adopted by the powers that
be.  And of course, that means you.
<P>
I do not know if you have ever even been made aware of this solution.  If
this is the first you have heard of it (or even if it isn't), please let
me know your opinion of it.
<P>
I apologize for the length of this message, but it is a matter that is
considered very important by the hobby, so I am curious to know your response.
<p>
Stab you soon,<br>
Manus

<H3 align=center><font color=red>Mr. Calhamer's Response</font></H3>
<P>
Dear Manus,
<P>
I have read with interest your well-thought-out arguments against
the rule permitting multiple convoy routes.  You have noted that
earlier they were not permitted.  I decided to permit them in
response to fan representations; now, quite a few years later, I
find fans building up an attack on that position.
<P>
In a discussion of
<!--
You mention
-->
a case in which France has the position <tt>A Tun</tt>,
<tt>A Rom</tt>,
<tt>F TYS</tt>, and <tt>F ION</tt>; and Italy has the position
<tt>F LYO</tt>, <tt>F ADR</tt>, and <tt>F Nap</tt>.
<P>
<!--
You call for
-->
And the French attack thus:
<tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Tun-Nap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F TYR C A Tun-Nap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A Rom S A Tun-Nap</tt>
<P>
Against this <!-- you mention --> would be offered the defense:
<tt><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F LYO-TYS<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F ADR-ION<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F Nap S F LYO-TYS</tt>; or, in the alternative,
<tt>F Nap S F ADR-ION</tt>.
<P>
It appears that this attack wins 100% of the time.  Except for
this attack, all optimal attacks result in guessing games.
<P>
If the multiple convoy routes were not permitted, all optimal attacks
in this situation would lead to guessing games.
<P>
Obviously the good player would be likely to order the multiple
convoy routes.
<P>
A defense of the present rule might go as follows:
<P>
It should be mentioned that the attacker can achieve this 100%
certainty only if he has four pieces to the defender's three, and
a precise position.  Interestingly, the defender actually
outnumbers the attacker in Fleets, three to two; but the attacker's
Fleets are perfectly placed for the attack, whereas the defender's
Fleets are scattered and out of touch with the objective.
<P>
Direct analogy of convoys to supports suffers because supports
fail if attacked with a force of one; convoys fail only if attacked
with a force of two.  Furthermore, supporting a supporting piece
does not protect at all against the cutting of the support of that
supporting piece; whereas supporting a convoying Fleet does
protect it against vitiating the convoy by dislodgment.
<P>
Thus convoys are stronger than supports anyway.  In return, of course,
you can't use them in as many situations.
<P>
Also under the present rules it is all the same whether one
convoy route succeeds or more than one; whereas it makes a difference
how many supports to a given action survive uncut.  This much in and of
itself seems realistic.
<P>
You argue that the attacker is allowed too many options.  If one convoy
route fails, he has the automatic option of using the other.  It is true
that if a player writes a conditional order it is no good.  However,
the orders generally have certain well-recognized conditions implicit
in them.  Thus if you order an Army to support, you know that, on
the condition that it is attacked, it will ignore its order to support
and defend its position.  Frequently you will rely on this conditional
possibility when you choose the support order.
<P>
Your argument from realism, and harmony with the tenor of the rules
generally, that the Army would not know in advance which convoy
route would be disrupted, is a hard one to meet.  However, we might
reasonably suppose that maintaining control of a body of water was
a six-month job for a Fleet.  Each convoying Fleet gives up its move
for this task.  It might further be supposed that crossing the
body of water, capturing a province on the far shore, setting up on
a new shore, being supplied by sea, and so forth, was a six-month
job for an Army.  The ousting of a convoying Fleet might be seen
as a deterioration of sea control, similarly over a period of six
months.  Now the Army, engaged in a six-month operation to gain a
foothold on the far shore, might easily during that time be diverted
entirely to the other convoy route.
<P>
The counter-argument, however, that, if only one route were
specified, and it were disrupted, then the Army should be free to
move overland in an entirely different direction (i.e., conditionally),
would fail because the six-month period would have been devoted to
attempting the crossing.
<P>
Thanks very much,<br>
Allan
