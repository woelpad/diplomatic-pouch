How do these affect the relative success rates of the powers?  Most
significantly,  how can you take lessons from this study to better
your own performance as each power?

<A HREF="Leotard/perception.html">Another Analysis of the "Risk-Taking" Experiment</a></b><dd>
Marc takes a fresh look at the data generated by Simon Szykman's tricky
"Risk-Taking" experiment of a few issues back.  In that experiment, Simon

board -- positioning within a space; be it "facing" either towards or away
from another part of the board -- had any effect on player perception of
coming events.
