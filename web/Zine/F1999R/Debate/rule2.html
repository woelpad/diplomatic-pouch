<H1 align=center>In Defense of Paradox Resolution Proposal 2</H1>

Welcome to the argument for proposal 2.
This page argues that convoy paradoxes should be resolved by adding the
following provision to the rules:
<blockquote><i>
If a situation arises in which an
army's convoy order results in a paradoxical adjudication, the turn is
adjudicated as if the convoying army had been ordered to hold.
</i></blockquote>

<H3>Examining the Outcome of Proposal 1 (The "Other" Rule)</H3>

Let's take a look the outcome of paradox-eliminating rule 1.  First off,
the attack via convoy on London is 2 on 1, so it succeeds.  The fleet in Lon
has no retreat and is destroyed.  With the existing rules of the game,
this results in a paradox.  With proposal 1, the convoying army does not
cut support on the fleet it has destroyed.  Because the support is not
cut, Wales and Belgium are both attacking Eng with a strength of two,
causing a standoff, Eng is not dislodged,
and therefore the convoy succeeds.  The rule has successfully
eliminated the paradox, but the result is one that I find rather
counter-intuitive.  The fleet in London was not only dislodged, but it was
<i>destroyed</i>.  Despite having been destroyed, it successfully
supported Wales to the English Channel, to bounce the German attack on the
Channel.
<p>
The rule
works fine for getting rid of paradoxes.  But it asks you to accept
that a destroyed unit can successfully support an attack.  Granted,
a destroyed fleet providing successful support is not a general rule,
but only comes into play in a paradoxical situation in order to eliminate
a paradox.  But for me, saying it applies as an exception rather than a
general rule does not make it easier to swallow.  To me, a destroyed
unit should simply not be able to successfully support an attack, any
attack, at any time.
<p>
While the existence of paradoxes is certainly
distasteful, that a given situation is paradoxical in my opinion does
not merit bestowing upon a fleet the ability to support an attack even
if it gets destroyed.  First of all, this directly contradicts Section
X of the rules (Cutting Support).  But even if we accept that this is an
exception to the rules on cutting support, allowing a destroyed unit to
still offer valid support seems to go against the basic spirit underlying
the support order.  The idea behind an attack cutting support in the
first place is based on the principle that in order to provide support,
military forces must be unhampered by a separate attack.  This reflects
real life in a somewhat reasonable way (though of course Diplomacy is just
a game).  Proposal 1 takes away that realistic element by allowing a
military force to provide support while being attacked so severely that
it is annihilated.
<h3>An Aside</h3>
I speak only for myself here, and I have no
doubt that there will be people who feel more strongly than I about
this issue of realism, as well
as people who are not particularly bothered by the idea.  It's just me.
<p>
Personally, I don't think there is a perfect solution to the problem.
Any solution will have some drawbacks.  The question here, is, what is
the least bothersome of the potential problems?  Which is worse, Pandin's
Paradox or allowing a destroyed unit to offer a valid support?  The
idea of having a destroyed unit give support for an attack is not one
that I like.  On the plus side, it does get rid of Pandin's Paradox.
But on the negative side, I have never seen Pandin's Paradox actually
occur in a game.  Do we really need to introduce a solution to that
problem (which doesn't come up) if it introduces a new problem (which
may (or may not) come up more often?  Again, I don't know the answer.
<p>
So let's look now at proposal 2.  Here again is the proposed rule:
<blockquote><i>
If a situation arises in which an
army's convoy order results in a paradoxical adjudication, the turn is
adjudicated as if the convoying army had been ordered to hold.
</i></blockquote>
The scenario presented earlier is a paradoxical situation.  And as such,
with this rule the convoyed army is treated as if it had been ordered to
hold, the fleet in London is not attacked, and its support is not
cut, thereby eliminating the original paradox.
<p>
But let's look at this rule again.  Because the army is treated as
if it had been ordered to hold in this situation, it is implicit in
that statement that army cannot cut support of a fleet supporting
an attack on the convoying fleet.  This happens to be exactly what
proposal 1 says.  However, the difference between the two is significant
because of what proposal 2 says that proposal 1 does not say: that the
turn is adjudicated as if the convoying army had been ordered to
<b>hold</b>.
In other words, with proposal 1, convoy succeeds, destroying a unit that
nevertheless successfully supports an attack, while with proposal 2,
the convoy does not happen since the army is assumed to hold.  Because
the convoy does not happen, the fleet in Lon is not attacked, and therefore

there is no need to grudgingly accept the idea of a destroyed unit giving
valid support.
<p>
Of course, what this rule does require is that you accept the idea of a
unit not moving despite being ordered to convoy, despite the fact that
the convoying fleet is not dislodged, and despite the fact that the
army has support for moving to its destination.
<p>
In that context, does this make sense? No!  This rule
makes an exception (in rare cases) that contradicts the basic rules
of Diplomacy.  In that respect, the rule is guilty of the same thing
that proposal 1 is guilty of.
<p>
But is such a rule better than leaving paradoxes in Diplomacy?  In my
opinion, yes.  Paradoxes bug me, even if they don't occur often.  And
since software will loop infinitely when presented with a true paradox,
adjudication software will have to pick one outcome or another to
present to players should such a situation arise, so you can't really
push off the issue as being irrelevant.  Even if it is an albeit
uncommon occurence, a software developer is forced to chose one
outcome as being "right" (or allow the alternative which is to have
software that hangs or crashes in paradoxical situations).
<p>
So the final question: is proposal 2 better than proposal 1?  And here,
peoples' opinions may differ.  It's a matter of which contradiction to
the existing rules one finds less distasteful.  With proposal 1, you
must accept a destroyed army giving valid support.  As I mentioned above,
in my opinion not only does that go against the spirit of the support
order, but it goes against the real-life situation that support and
support-cutting rules are intended to reflect.   With proposal 2, you
must accept an army holding for no apparent reason.  And while there is
no real-life justification for why that would happen, I don't find it
as blatant a contradiction to the reality that is intended to be captured
by the rules of the game.
<h3>Summary</h3>
I'll go back to the main argument against proposal 2 from the
purist point of view.  There is no reason that the army should hold
given the other rules, and therefore proposal 2 contradicts the other
rules.  I can't argue with that because it's true.
<p>I think what this all boils down to is a fundamental
problem with simultaneous adjudication. I don't think it is possible
to have a set of rules governing convoys as they currently exist
which is (1) consistent <u>and</u> (2) paradox-free.  There are undoubtedly
other ways aside from these two proposals to eliminate paradoxes, but
none will avoid being inconsistent because the current rules on their
own, without any paradox-eliminating modifications are inconsistent
(which is why paradoxes arise in the first place!)
<p>
So you either accept to live with paradoxes, or you introduce a rule
that can lead to an inconsistency.  I acknowledge the inconsistency in
my proposed rule, but personally, I find it more palatable than the
one introduced by proposal 1, and I find both proposals much more
palatable than allowing paradoxes to remain in the rules.
<p>
And, as I said before, there is no right answer.  It's just a matter of
deciding which is the most acceptable of the not-right ones.

<P>
And so, if you're ready to make that call for yourself, let us know
what you think:
