Here is the paradox article.  This is the basic setup.  Towards the
end, you will see the place where there will be links to a discussion
of Rule 1 over Rule 2 and the discussion for Rule 2 over Rule 1.

I will be writing the one for Rule 2 over Rule 1.  I'll try to get it
to you tomorrow.  It won't be very long.  I'm basically going to take
the email message I sent you the first time around and smooth it out 
a bit.

Also, you will notice that I didn't actually say anywhere in the text
which of us came up with which rule.  That was intentional... part of
the mystery.  You'll see at the end that the page that comes up after
their final vote will reveal which was which.

<H1 align=center>Eliminating the Paradox in Diplomacy</H1>
<H2 align=center><i>By Simon Szykman and Manus Hand</i></h2>
<HR>
<H3>What's Up Here?</H3>
Back during their input into the development of the Diplomacy Player's
Technical Guide, the issue of how to adjudicate convoys came up, in
particular as it related to paradoxical situations.  Both Simon Szykman and 
Manus Hand had their own opinions about it.  Time passed....
<p>
More recently, Manus dropped Simon a note, bringing up the topic again,
with a proposal.
<!--
saying he had come up with
a way of eliminating paradoxes that had not (to his knowledge) been
proposed before.  
-->
<p>
Simon examined Manus' proposed rule, and replied with a rule of his
own which he had always had in mind to use should a paradoxical situation 
arise in a game he was running (it never did get used, as paradoxes are
extremely uncommon situations).  This rule also eliminated paradoxes,
but in a different way and therefore resulting in a different outcome.
<p>
They now present these ideas for scrutiny by and for comment from the
Diplomacy community.
<p>
<!--
They felt it was important to solicit a "gut reaction" before actually
presenting
-->
Here are
the two proposed rules and the point/counter-point exchange
between Simon and Manus.  Consider the following situation (a 
slight modification on the traditional Pandin's paradox):
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr><th rowspan=5><img src=paradox.gif>

<th>Order

<td>English Fleet Wales<br>
    English Fleet London
<td><tt>F Wal - ENG<br>
    F Lon S F Wal - ENG
<tr>
<td>French Army Brest<br>               
    French Fleet English Channel<br>

    German Fleet North Sea

    F NTH S F Bel - ENG 
<tr><td colspan=2>&nbsp;
</table>
</center>
<p>
If you adjudicate this situation according to the Diplomacy rules,
you will find that it leads to a paradox.  If the convoy to London
fails, England and Germany have equally-well supported attacks on
the English Channel, therefore there is a standoff.  This, in turn,
means that the Channel fleet is not dislodged, and
therefore the convoy succeeds, cutting the support ordered by London.
This causes Wal to lose support, eliminating the standoff in the Channel,
allowing the German attack on the English Channel to succeed, dislodging
the fleet there, and disrupting the convoy.  This means that Brest does
not attack London, reinstating the support given by London, causing a
standoff, allowing the convoy to succeed, which cuts support... and so on
and so on.
<p>
Why does this happen? Because there
is an inconsistency in the Diplomacy rules that makes it impossible
to adjudicate this situation without a paradox.  Or, put slightly 
differently, there is no one single result that is consistent with the 
combination of rules on convoys, support, and support-cutting.
<p>
So how to eliminate the paradox?  Simple.  Add a rule that forbids
paradoxes from happening.  But you can't just add a rule that says
"Paradoxes are forbidden" because such a rule would not tell you <i>how</i>
the above (currently paradoxical) situation should be adjudicated.
You need to come up with a rule that allows players to determine
a single outcome for that situation.
<p>
Okay.  Before we actually talk about specific paradox-eliminating rules,
let's assume for a moment that we live in a world where such a rule 
exists.  Okay?  There is no paradox.  Say it out loud.
"There is no paradox."  Good.  The question is, since we have (in this
imaginary world) a set of
Diplomacy rules that does not result in a paradox for the above orders,
what does the board look like after they are adjudicated?
Here are two possibilities:

Support from London is not cut.
	<br>This allows a standoff in the Channel.

Before discussing any actual rules, Simon and Manus
want to get a gut reaction to the situation from readers.  So please
click on one of the buttons below to proceed to the rules and discussion.
Note that you may not be 100% satisfied with either outcome, because 
this situation is one in which there fundamentally is no possible outcome
that is completely consistent with all the Diplomacy rules.  So we are
not asking for absolute satisfaction... just which seems more right (or
less wrong).  If you absolutely just cannot make up your mind, you can
click the third button.  Regardless of how you answer now, you will be
asked again after the discussion and will have the opportunity to change
your mind.
