<H1 align=center>In Defense of Paradox Resolution Proposal 1</H1>

Welcome to the argument for proposal 1.
This page argues that convoy paradoxes should be resolved by adding the
following provision to the rules:
<blockquote><i>
"If a convoyed army attacks a fleet
that is supporting an action in or into a body of water that contains a
convoying fleet, that support is not cut by the convoyed army under
any circumstance (but a convoying army does cut all other supports
normally)."
</i></blockquote>
Essentially, this means that
even if a convoying army succeeds in dislodging the the fleet at its
destination location, it does not cut the support offered by that fleet,
if that support for was an attack on a fleet that carried the
attacking army.
<!--
Other than this single exception, the convoying army cuts <i>all other
supports normally</i>.
<!--
<H3>An Amendment to the 1976 Rule</H3>
I want to discuss the second of those two sentences first, since I would like
to make sure that this proposal is viewed properly.  This proposal is a minor
change to the
1976 rule on support cutting by convoyed attacks.  This proposal would
call for players to
completely ignore the 1982 rule that took the place of the 1976 rule when
paradoxical situations were discovered.
<P>
The problem of convoyed attacks cutting supports has caused a lot
of people a lot of head-scratching over the years.
In the 1976 rulebook, an initial attempt was made to remedy the problem.  In
this rulebook, an army cannot cut support that is
directed against any fleet convoying that army.  The proposal I make is
simply to remove the unstated but implied "(except by dislodging)" provision.
<P>
Some modification to the 1976 rule is (and was) necessary, of course, because
the 1976 rule was not airtight.  Instead, the 1976 rule introduced other
paradoxes.  The revised rules (1982) made a second attempt to provide a rule
by which paradoxes are avoided, but it, too, failed.  The 1982 rule attempted
to aid resolution by forbidding a convoying army from cutting even <i>more</i>
supports than simply those directed against a fleet that would carry <i>that
particular</i> army.  The 1982 rule keeps a convoying army from cutting
any number of different kinds of suports) -- it states that a convoying army
cannot cut support that is offered for or against <i>any fleet in water!</i>
<P>
 I've always
        preferred the 1976 rule, and never liked the 1982 attempt
        to resolve the paradoxes that arise from it.
The 1976 rule just always seemed logical to me.  A convoying army "comes from" its
        original location and also "from" each fleet location along the way,
        so it seemed natural that the army should not be able to cut support
        directed against <i>any</i> of those spots.  But I saw no reason to
        restrict its support-cutting power any further.  I feel pretty strongly
        that if a convoying army attacks a unit that is offering any support
        <i>other than</i> for an action against that convoying army's original
        location or the location of any fleet that is convoying the army,
        the support <i>should</i> be cut (as long as the convoy
        is not disrupted, of course).
        <P>
        The 1982 rule did more than grate at my sense of order, though:
the worst part is that it does not even resolve all paradoxes.
Instead, it introduces new and even hairier paradoxes.
<P>
It makes sense to me to go back to the 1976 rule (which has a logical
"feel" to it) and see what is truly necessary to make it provide a unique
resolution for all situations.  This is what I did when I came up with
my proposal.
<P>
The second proposal before us (which would rule that a convoyed army that
would introduce a paradox should be declared to have held) does not
address the counter-intuitive results introduced by the 1982 rules.  It
would uphold these and simply address only the paradoxes.  (The second
proposal <i>could</i> indeed be applied to the 1976 rules as easily as
to the 1982 rules -- I do not mean to imply that it cannot.  In this initial
part of my argument, though, I simply wished to make clear that the basis
for this first proposal is the 1976 ruleset.)


<blockquote><i>Note:  Rick Desper contacted me with a convincing
justification for the 1982 rules.  I am re-thinking my position on
whether this proposal should amend the 1976 or 1982 rules.

<H3>A Dislodged Unit Offering Uncut Support???</H3>
<!--
Having made a case for the proposal's second, less earth-shaking, sentence
(which states that the standard, pre-1982, rules be followed in nearly all
circumstances), let us
now discuss the proposal's first sentence.  Once again, that sentence is
as follows:
<P>
<blockquote><i>
Even if a convoying army succeeds in dislodging the the fleet at its
destination location, it does not cut the support offered by that fleet,
if (and only if) that support for was an attack on a fleet that carried
the attacking army.
</i></blockquote>
<P>

Yes, this proposal introduces an exception to the otherwise concrete rule that any
support offered by a dislodged unit is always cut.  This fact
affords perhaps the soundest basis for any objection to this proposal.
Unfortunately, this objection is perhaps the most difficult to address.
<P>
The simple fact is that any proposed resolution to the paradox problem will,
of necessity, include some change to the base rules.  If we acknowledge this,
the task becomes to determine which of the base rules should be modified,
and how.  The proposal that is advocated here should be given equal weight to
any other, and perhaps it becomes a question of "gut-feel" which of any
number of proposed changes best preserves the spirit of the rules.
<P>
The question before us now whether the
"support offered by dislodged units is always cut" rule should be left
alone for consistency's sake, or whether an exception should be made to it
to resolve paradoxes in a particular way.  I argue that this exception
is the most palatable exception possible, and that the results given by the
modified rule are sensible and proper.
<P>
Obviously, the first crucial question is whether, in resolving the situation
described in this article, the army convoying from Brest should be allowed to
cut the support of the fleet in London.  If this were the <i>only</i>
question, the answer would be obvious.  The answer simply <i>has to be</i>
no.  No matter what paradox-resolving rule is preferred, the answer must be
no.  If the fleet's support is declared cut, the result is a paradox.
<P>
Therefore, we can decide right now that if we wish to resolve the situation
without a paradox, the support must not be cut.  This brings us to the
difference between the two proposals.  In this first proposal, the army's
move is allowed to succeed.  In the second proposal, it is not.
<P>
Why do I argue that the convoying army should reach its destination?  First,
because disallowing it would introduce a <i>second</i> exception to the rules.
An exception that I believe is unnecessary.  Consider that we have already
declared that at least one exception to the existing rules is needed in
order to resolve the paradoxical situation.  This exception -- "a convoying
army cannot cut a support that is keeping a convoying fleet afloat" -- is
an exception that <i>must</i> be made by <i>any</i> rule.
<P>
This first proposal stops here and allows the remainder of the existing
rules to take their normal effect.  The second proposal actually adds
a second exception.  It acknowledges that the London support is not cut (the
first and necessary exception), but -- and here is the second exception -- it
then forbids the English Channel fleet to convoy the army from Brest as ordered.
<P>
Consider that once the unavoidable decision has been made that the London
support cannot be cut (or else a paradox arises), the English Channel
fleet must be ruled a beleaguered garrison.  As such, it should be allowed
to carry an army via convoy.  To rule otherwise would be a (second)
special-case exception to the rules.
<P>
My preference is to allow the fleet to act as any other beleaguered fleet
would be allowed to act.  It should be allowed to carry a convoying army.
If we simply bear in mind the one acknowledged
necessary exception to the rules that
will keep the London support intact (despite the dislodging of the London
fleet), the existing rules resolve themselves.

<H3>Whose Offensive <i>Should</i> Prevail?</H3>
At its most basic, the question is one which asks for an almost instinctive
answer:  "should the Brest army succeed or fail in its move to London?"
Perhaps no textual argument can take the place of each player's personal visual
sense of order when looking at the map.  However, I believe that a legitimate
case can indeed be made that it is "correct" to rule that the Brest
army should succeed and dislodge the London fleet.
<P>
Let us consider the effective strength in theatre of the two combatants
in our scenario:  France and England.  France has three units engaged (Brest,
English Channel, and Yorkshire) while England has only two (London and Wales).
From this alone, one could perhaps conclude that any "gut feel" resolution
of a situation such as the one we are working with should be in favor of
France.
<P>
Of course, there are German units involved as well, but I argue that these
should be ignored in any "gut-feel," who-<i>should</i>-win assessment.  The
German fleets are effectively protecting the convoy by making it a beleaguered
garrison.  But can we conclude that Germany is therefore pro-France?  Certainly
not.  It is just as likely that Germany expected to dislodge the English
Channel fleet by his attack.  An argument can be made that it is in fact
<i>more likely</i> that Germany is anti-French.  If one feels strongly enough
that this is indeed the more likely case, perhaps it could be concluded
that the number of units in the arena is actually not three-to-two for France,
but four-to-three for England.
<P>
But if we choose to say that Germany was acting against French interests
by his attack, and that therefore his units should be declared pro-England,
we are faced with the question:  why did Germany, if he is so pro-England,
not simply support the attacking English fleet into the Channel?  The only
conclusion (other than perhaps this is a game in which no communication
between players is allowed) is that Germany is not as pro-England as he could
be.  In fact, his attitude toward England could perhaps best be viewed as
disinterested.
<P>
However, we cannot rule Germany to be pro-France, since again, he had a much
better way to make this attitude known.  The German player could have
simply supported the French fleet in the English Channel against the English
attack.  Because the German neither supported the English attack on the Channel
nor the French fleet in the Channel, we must avoid any temptation to rule
the German actions as favoring either of his two neighbors over the other.
<P>
Because of this, I argue that the German units must be ignored in this
"gut-feel" strength-involved assessment.  And this means that whatever
paradox resolution is chosen, the German units should not be affected by
it -- their orders should be left to operate as the standard rules dictate.
In this case, the standard rules, in combination with the exception (that
both proposals make) that the London fleet's support simply cannot be cut
by the Brest army, dictate that the effect of the German orders is to
render the French fleet in the English Channel a beleaguered garrison.
And so it is (in both proposals).
<P>
Therefore, my argument is that the situation described is analogous to a
three-on-two, and that the party with three units in the theatre should be
given the benefit of any doubt in any resolution to an otherwise paradoxical
adjudication.
The second proposal (which would rule the army to have issued a
hold order rather than the convoy order that was actually given to it)
actually favors the party that (I maintain) actually devoted less strength
to the theatre.
The second proposal also results in a "big nothing," which, frankly, is
no fun for anyone.  "Big nothings" are fine if one side or the other had
actually planned to create it, but it is my belief that the second
proposal would constitute something of a "surprise" big nothing, of a
sort that no party really expected.

<H3>Summary</H3>
To summarize, both proposals agree that the London support must be uncut.
And both agree that the English Channel fleet is (therefore) a beleaguered
garrison.  At this point the two proposals diverge.  This first proposal
chooses to go no further and to simply allow the existing rules to
take effect.
Their effect in this case is to allow the French army to dislodge the
English fleet in London.
<P>
Note that in most other cases where this rule
would be applied, this result (a dislodged fleet) would actually be uncommon.
This is because the exception that is being proposed (to forbid a convoying
army from cutting support for an attack on one of the fleets carrying the
convoying army, even when the army dislodges the supporting fleet)
is rendered completely moot if there is no support for
the landing of the convoying army.  In order to arrive at a situation in
which this rule would result in anything but a bounce for the convoying
army, the following two conditions would have to exist:
<ol>
<li>Enough support must be given for the attacking army to dislodge the
	fleet at the convoy destination.
<li>The convoying fleet that is being attacked must be a beleaguered garrison.
</ol>
In point of fact, this situation is so tremendously rare that 
the acceptability of any proposal to resolve the paradox is actually enhanced.
Work through the proposed rule.  You will see that it takes a very specific
situation (such as that contrived for this article) to cause the singular
logistical oddity that it makes possible -- a
dislodged fleet actually offering valid, uncut support -- to occur.  In all
other cases, the results obtained by adjudicating results under this first
proposed rule
are completely without surprise.  The convoying army either bounces (if its
attack was through a beleaguered garrison but did not have enough support to
succeed), or remains in place (if its failure to cut the support at the destination
means that a fleet that was to have convoyed it is dislodged, which disrupts
the convoy).
<P>
However, this simple addition to the rules resolves all paradoxes, and allows
a convoying army to cut supports (with just this one very rare exception) just
as any other unit would.
