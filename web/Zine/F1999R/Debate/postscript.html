<center><h2>Proposal 2 Postscript: The Science of Paradoxes</h2></center>
Disclaimer: this afterthought will probably only appeal to some
physicists and sci-fi geeks, but what the heck.
<p>
I once heard or read an interesting theory from a physicist having to
do with time travel and paradoxes.  I don't exactly remember what the
source was, but if it was something I read it was most likely in something
like <i>Scientific American</i>, and if I heard it somewhere it was most
likely at a lecture I heard by Lawrence Krauss, the physicist who wrote
the book <i>The Physics of Star Trek</i> among others).  Despite my
incomplete recollection, I'm pretty sure the source of what I'm about to
discuss was a "real" physicist.  The
discussion went something along the following lines:
<p>
We know that at the level of sub-atomic particles and quantum physics,
time travel may be possible.  In some situations, you can even view certain
particles moving forward in time as those particles' antiparticles moving
backwards in time, and this view is not inconsistent with the laws of
physics as we understand them.  As of now, however, we do not know how to
make use of this to send information or matter back in time.
But there are physicists who believe that it may be possible to someday
have time travel.  Perhaps not sending matter back in time, but perhaps
information.
<p>
The classic time
travel paradox situation says that if time travel were achieved by
people, a time traveler could go back in time, kill one of his (or her)
parents, preventing the traveler from ever being born, so that the traveler
could never go back in time to kill the parent, so that there is nothing
preventing the traveler from being born, so that the traveler would be
born, and could go back in time and kill the parent, etc.  Now this
paradox would require sending matter back in time, but one could come up
with a contrived scenario in which sending some signal or information
back in time could result in somebody else's death, this paradox is in
principle one that could occur even if time travel were restricted to
information or a signal.  Yes, that's a big if, in and of itself.
<p>
Now for the theory that was suggested in the lecture/article I mentioned.
The universe is a complex mechanism.  Such a paradox
would throw this mechanism into some incomprehensible looping state that
could not truly exist given the laws of physics.  And therefore, there is
something about the laws of physics that would prevent a paradox from
ever arising, because a paradox is something that simply cannot
physically exist in reality.  It would be physically impossible for a
time traveler to go back in time and kill his (or her) parent because
it would lead to a situation that cannot physically exist.
<p>
I don't believe there is any physical evidence to support this theory,
nor at the moment, even an experiment designed that could test the 
theory.  It's more of a thought experiment on the part of some physicist
or some group of physicists to answer the question "If time travel
is indeed theoretically possible, what will stop the universe from being
caught or destroyed by a paradox?"  Put a little bit differently, some
people have argued that time travel is impossible because it would lead
to paradoxes, and physicists who believe that time travel may be possible
are saying that (1) the possibility of a paradox caused by time travel
does not necessarily make time travel impossible, and (2) if time travel
is possible, paradoxes may not be a concern because it may be that 
paradoxes cannot exist.
<p>
Back to Diplomacy... in the case for proposal 2, I acknowledged that
there was no real-life justification for
why the army required to hold in rule 2 should have to hold.  But
maybe this isn't completely true.  Loosely translated, one could restate
the spirit of proposal 2 to something like: "If an army is ordered to
move in a way that would cause a paradoxical situation, then that army
is not allowed to move."  Basically, this says that the army isn't
moving because its moving would cause a paradox and a paradox cannot
exist.  And maybe, this does reflect a real-life situation because
maybe there is something about the universe that will act to prevent
a paradox because paradoxes are inherently forbidden by the physical
laws of the universe.
<p>
Not very compelling, is it.  I'm not particularly convinced by this
argument myself.  It sounds like somebody saying a paradoxical situation
cannot exist because paradoxes cannot exist.  If you assume one, then the
other follows, but there's something a bit circular about it.  And is
there really a sound basis for thinking that a paradox cannot phsyically
exist even if time travel is possible?  People used to say that singularities
could not exist physically and were merely a fabrication of mathematics, but
I think it is commonly agreed now that black holes are indeed singularities
in space-time.  But for anyone who has nothing better to do than to read
this far through my ruminations, there's some food for thought.  And who
knows... at some point in the distant future, some physicist may prove
that there really is a real-life basis for proposal 2.  Me, I think it's
the best solution even if it's completely without foundation.
