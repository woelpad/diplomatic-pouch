<h1 align=center>WDC IX at Namur, Belgium 1999:</H1>
<h2 align=center>A Peerispective</h2>
<H3 align=center><i>By Larry Peery</i></h3>
<HR>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<p>Was it an ideal WDC?  No.  Was it
the best WDC to date? Yes.  After the excellent WDC VII hosted by
GOTHCON in Goteborg, Sweden in 1997 I really didn't expect the Belgian
Diplomacy hobby and Namur, Belgium to outdo the Swedes in 1999, but they
did.  And there is no doubt in my mind that the Namur event was superior
to WDC VIII held in Chapel Hill, USA in 1998.  Namur has set a very
high standard that the Hunt Valley, USA event in 2000 and the Paris, France
event in 2001 will have a difficult time equaling, let alone surpassing.
<p><b>Why?</b>
<p>Why was WDC IX so successful? 
Here are just some of the reasons: a great venue; an inspiring site; a
supportive local hobby and host organization; a dedicated and hardworking
staff; and perhaps most important, a bossy tournament director and caring
host, Jean-Louis Delattre! I could spend pages elaborating on those reasons,
but I'll do that on my own web site.
<P>
From the pre-event publicity, to the actual running
of the event, and through the post-event reports, Namur did an outstanding
job.  Perhaps there were some grumbles about the tournament format
and scoring system; but those are inevitable, especially among the losers. 
I was particularly impressed with the way Namur managed to mobilize their
national media to promote their event.  That will pay off in future
benefits to future events.
<p>Equally impressive was the speed with which
the post-event reports were posted on the internet! By the time I returned
home from my trip, the early results were waiting in my email box.
<p>I think Jean-Louis himself identified the
key reason for the success of this year's event.  It was the first
WDC ever in which the host country did not dominate the play.  This
is of great significance in the development of WDC.  Now, perhaps
the Belgians would have preferred otherwise....
<p><b>Why Not?</b>
<p>So why wasn't Namur an ideal WDC?  I'll discuss
that at another time; when I'm not in such a good mood.
<p><b>Thanx for the Namuries!</b>
