      <H1>The Diplomatic Corps:<br>
      Opening Announcement</H1>

    <p>The Diplomatic Corps is a nonprofit, worldwide player group 
      chartered to help support and promote the Diplomacy hobby -- be it
      face to face games, tournaments, e-mail or postal play.
    </p>
    <p>The organization will be providing a network of personal and
		organizational contacts around the world who
      will be available to demonstrate the play of Diplomacy and to act as 
      hosts and game masters for local events.  It  will be providing services
      to players such as
      disseminating information on play and various rating systems, offering 
      support for local/regional/international tournaments, and working with
      Hasbro to bring new players into the hobby.
    </p>
	<H3 align=center><a href=http://www.diplomaticcorps.org>The Diplomatic Corps Website</a><br>
	contains full details on all Corps activities and resources,
	<br>and is
	constantly updated!</H3>
    <p>Initially the group will be headed up by Edi Birsan who has been
      in the hobby over three decades and has had experience with hobby
      groups going back to the early 70's.
    </p>
    <p>Membership fees will be collected and used to provide for prize
      support as well as to promote the international aspects of the
      hobby.  The membership fee is set at US$15.  Registrations are most
      welcome in the following fashions:

    <p>Some of the projects already underway are:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>The donation of Best Country award plaques to the World Email
	Masters Tournament (currently going with 79 boards in the initial
	round).
      <li>The establishment of a donation fund for International overseas
	housing support for the World DipCon 2000 in Baltimore next
	August.  Currently collected is $300 to provide some housing for
	the long distance travelers.
      <li>The drafting of a Tournament Rules Guide to help provide tournament
	directors with an overview of different approaches taken by and
	methodologies used by past tournaments.  The Diplomatic Corps
	recognizes the importance of the autonomy of local tournament 
	directors and hopes the Tournament Rules Guide will be used as a
	source book and reference, but not as a rule book.
    </ol>
    
    <p>The Diplomatic Pouch will be the official zine of the Diplomatic 
      Corps and will handle much of its information distribution needs. 
      Postal arrangements will be made for those members without email or web
      access.
