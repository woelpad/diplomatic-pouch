I am putting together a player group called the Diplomatic Corps as a non profit group.
The purpose of the group is to support the Diplomacy hobby in all three of its mainstream activities: face to face, postal 
and mainstream.
Part of it will be to provide a visible group of players who can demonstrate and help support the Diplomacy Hobby 
through putting on tournaments, demonstrations or simply hosting games for new or local players. A nominal membership 
fee will be used to sponsor events and members in regional and national tournaments as well as to help sponsor players at 
the World Diplomacy Convention where ever it is held each year. We will be getting some support from Hasbro in terms 
of new player and flyers in games so we hope to be able channel new players in the hobby mainstream. We will also have 
a small quarterly zine to help keep everyone informed as well as making use of the Net.

On the email side we are putting together a web site which is awaiting Net approval.

What I am looking for from you all in this pre release notice are volunteers to be the initial 'diplomats' or mentors around 
the world that we can place on the web site or use in initial flyers. What we ask of the 'diplomats' is that they are prepared 
to host a game every two months (face to face) or gm a regular postal or email game. 

Let me know if you are available and if you are willing to support as a member or the next level as a mentor/diplomat.
I am especially looking for people outside of the US that can act as national and regional contact people.


Please provide:
Full Name
email address
postal address
If you want to be listed as a Diplomat then:
field: Face to Face, Postal, Email
phone contact times and number

We have arranged with Midnight Games to be able to accept credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) and can 
accept checks at: Diplomatic Corps c/o Midnight Games, Suite B, Medford, OR 97501

Great, can you give me a street address and a phone number and times so people who want to call about the things can 
get in touch with you or do you want me to list only your email address and preference for email

THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS
OPENING ANNOUNCEMENT

The Diplomatic Corps is a non profit world wide player group to
help support and promote the Diplomacy playing hobby be it
through face to face games, tournaments, email or postal play.

We will be providing a network of contacts around the world who
will help host, Gamesmaster, and demonstrate the play of
Diplomacy.  We will be providing services to the players such as
information on play, various rating systems, support for local-
regional-international tournaments and working with Hasbro to
bring new players into the main streams of play.

Initially the group will be headed up by Edi Birsan who has been
in the hobby over 3 decades and has had experience with hobby
groups going back to the early 70's. 

Membership fees will be collected and used to provide for prize
support as well as promote the international aspects of the
hobby.  Membership fee is set at US$15.  Registration can be made
by email to
          edi@mgames.com
by post to:
          Diplomatic Corps  c/o Midnight Games
          PO Box 280 
          Medford OR 97501  USA
Credit cards (MC, Visa, American Express)

Some of the projects already under way are:
1. Donation of Best Country award plaques to the World Email
Masters Tournament (currently going with 79 boards in the initial
round).
2. Establishment of a donation fund for International overseas
housing support for the World DipCon 2000 in Baltimore next
August.  Currently collected is $300 to provide some housing for
the long distance travelers.
3. Tournament Rules Guide directed to the Tournament Director to
give him an over view of different approaches and a template to
cut and paste his own views into.  We recognize the importance of
local directors autonomy and wish to support it.

The Diplomatic Pouch will be the official zine of the DC and for
those non Email members we will make arrangements for paper
mailings.

Following is the initial set of 'Diplomats' who will be starting the network
to help the Diplomatic Corps get going.  If you would like to be added please contact
Edi Birsan at edi@mgames.com
