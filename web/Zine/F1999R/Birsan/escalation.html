<H1 align=center>When You Do Not Have Exactly Seven Players:<br>
Escalation Diplomacy</H1>
<H2 align=center><i>by Edi Birsan</i></H2>

Diplomacy is a time-proven classic seven player game with a fine play balance between all the
countries.  However, at times players can not assemble seven players.
At other times, there may be are eight or more players. 
Escalation is the system that provides a solution and a unique game experience each time played.
<P>
<H3>The Rules</H3>
<ol>
<li>Start with a map and no pieces on it.
<li>Each player takes a different color set of pieces; if more than one player
must use the same color, have each player position his pieces differently on the
board (facing north rather than east, etc.)
<li>Decide the order in which players will place units on the board during
the 'Escalation Placement' phase of the game.
(It is recommended is that the owner of the game places first and then players
proceed in alphabetical order by name.)
<li>Decide on the number of pieces that each player will place during the Escalation phase.  (Suggestions are given below.)
<li>The game then begins with the "Escalation" phase.  One by one, each player places one of his own pieces on the map. This is the "Escalation" as players react to
each other's prior single piece placement.
The piece may be an Army or a Fleet and it may be on a Supply Center, a non Supply Center
province, or a sea zone with the classical rules of only one piece per space.
<li>Players continue to place pieces until the agreed number of pieces are placed by each.
<li>Each player starts the game owning any Supply Center in which he initially positions a piece.
<li>Play the Spring 1901 and the Fall 1901 seasons simultaneously like a
normal game.
<li>When the Winter 1901 adjustment phase arrives, each player chooses and writes down his 'home' supply centers (up to three -- selected from among any that he owns at this time) and he
may build on each, if possible, starting in Winter 1901 and for the rest of the
game.
Players are not limited to declaring traditional home centers, nor do they have to be adjacent. 
For example, a player may declare that Brest, Portugal, and Naples are his three home centers if he
owns those centers in the Winter of 1901.
</ol>
<H3>Suggested Initial Piece-Count</H3>
The table below provides a suggested number of pieces to be placed by each
player during the "Escalation" phase of the game:

<table border cellpadding=5>
<tr><th>Number of<br>Players<th>Pieces to be Placed<br>by Each Player
<tr><th>2<th>12
<tr><th>3<th>8
<tr><th>4<th>6
<tr><th>5<th>5
<tr><th>6<th>4
<tr><th>7 or more<th>3
</table>
</center>
<P>
As a Diplomacy teaching device for two players, you may wish to increase
the number of starting pieces to 17 to give players a more intense
Escalation Phase of the variant and to teach planning ahead.
<H3>Negotiation</H3>
Discussions can be limited to table-side only (all discussions open to all), none ("Gunboat")
or traditional secret/private talks.  Generally, it is recommended that for four or fewer players,
there be no discussions other than at the table.
