<H1 align=center>Out Of My Depth</H1>
<H2 align=center>Thoughts from A Tournament Novice</H2>
<H3 align=center>by Richard Horton</H3>

<blockquote><i>
<H4>Introduction and Background<br>
by Ted Miller, 1999 World E-Mail Masters Tournament Director</H4>
	Mr. Horton has written a vibrant article which well depicts his entry into
the 1999 World E-mail Masters Diplomacy Tournament. Hopefully, he will keep
his promise and submit follow-up articles. I thought I would briefly
outline how the tournament got started for readers unfamiliar with it.
<P>
	Maurice Jean of the Cat-23 community sponsored a team tournament in 1997 &
1998. This brilliant idea was well received. However, despite having
players from all over the world, it was never heavily promoted as a World
tournament. In 1999 Ray Setzer (Mr. Cat-23) and Emeric Miszti combined to
organize and publicize a truly world-wide tournament. There were strenuous
efforts to recruit from around the world, and to bring Judge players into
the tournament. (Up until then, the judge and human moderated e-mail player
communities were largely separate.) 
<P>
	They succeeded beyond their wildest expectations. The organizers hoped for
40-50 teams; no less than 79 teams signed up, and several more would have if
we hadn’t run out of time. The seven-man teams meant 553 players had
signed up,
with many more composing a reserve list, hoping to enter as a substitution.
<P>
	These 79 first round games are administered by volunteer GMs, many using
Judges for adjudication. The 49 highest scorers will enter the semifinals,
which is also the first round of the individual tournament. A seven player
final will determine the tournament champion.
<P>
	Next year we anticipate many more entries. I hope to see you there!
<P>
And so, with no further ado, here is what Richard Horton has to say....

	 <H3>Me? In a Tournament?</H3>

<P>
	It all started with an e-mail announcement I found in my box this  
summer.  It seems there was a e-mail Diplomacy World Championship coming  
together out there somewhere, and I was cordially invited.  I'd like to  
say that my imagination was fired from the start, but it wasn't.   
While I had played a good deal of Diplomacy, both on the Judges and FTF,  
I had never taken part in an organized tournament of any kind.  As my  
professional life had taken me further away from those friends I used to  
spend afternoons with plotting the fate of Belgium and Greece, I had  
toyed with the idea of attending a FTF tournament, but nothing ever came  
of that.  Part of this was due to the busy life I had accidentally  
created for myself, but I must admit that I found the idea of competing  
in a FTF tournament a little intimidating.  I'd read the accounts of  
various tournaments in the pages of the Diplomatic Pouch, and while they  
sounded like glorious fun (particularly when it was Australians and New  
Zealanders doing the Dipping), the thought kept occurring that I might  
find myself completely out of my depth!
<P>
	However, I could think of a few reasons why an e-mail tournament might be a different beast all together.   
<ol>
<li>I had plenty on experience playing Diplomacy on the Judges.  <li>The  
e-mail format gives you plenty of time to devote on your diplomatic  
overtures <i>and</i> tactics.  <li>The chances were greater, or so I reasoned,  
that most players in a world e-mail tournament would be complete  
strangers to one another.  I wouldn't be singled out as some sort of  
interloper by a cadre of players familiar with one another.</ol>
All in all  
it looked like the perfect opportunity to ease myself into the world of  
tournament play.  So I took the plunge and signed myself up on the  
tournament bulletin board, and waited.
<P>
	It took awhile to get going, but as October 1st neared (the tournament
entry deadline) things started  
hopping.  I was assigned to team USA East II, which was later re-named  
the XYZ Affair. (Most of the other players organized their own teams and
entered <i>en bloc</i>.)  None of my teammates expressed much interest in  
specific countries so I'm not even sure how it was decided who would  
play which.  I was assigned France and I was pleased with that.  My best  
Judge results had come while playing France.  I'd never had a solo win  
on a Judge, but I had been a part of two three-way draws.  Both times I was  
France.  Things were looking good!
<P>
	It was at this point that I discovered some interesting things.  It  
seems that one of my teammates, Stephen Koehler was well known in the  
world of Diplomacy.  For this reason the early scuttlebutt about the  
tournament placed the XYZ Affair as one of the "Teams to Watch."  That's  
just great.... Here I am trying to get my feet wet and now I'm worried  
about dragging my whole team down.  The pressure had already started,  
and I hadn't even been placed on a board yet.  And then....
<P>
	I was placed on a board.  Not just any board but a board that was  
picked one of the "Boards to Watch."  There was not one, but three  
players of noted reputation on the board, including a former European  
Champion and another who runs one of the better known Diplomacy zines.   
I wanted to wet my feet and I found myself swimming with the sharks!  It  
is a good thing I can roll with the punches (as opposed to reel with the  
stabs), as this offers me a golden opportunity to get a feel for what  
tournament play really entails.
<P>
	As I write this, the game is entering its second year.  I won't go into  
much in the way of details as this is an on-going game, but I feel  
pretty good about the way things have started.  Germany and my France  
have moved against England, and, despite a balky Russia, the rest of the  
board is looking lively.  In future issues of The Pouch I'll update my  
progress in the game, as well as giving my evolving opinions on e-mail  
tournament play.  Who knows, maybe I'll scratch my way into the second  
round.  I wouldn't bet the farm on that, but I've got as good a shot as  
any.  (Famous last words, anyone?)
