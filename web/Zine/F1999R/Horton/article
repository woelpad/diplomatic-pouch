Hi Manus,

Attached is my article for the Dip Pouch.  At the end of it I'd like to add
a link to a page that was set up to follow the game I'm in (9925).

The address is:  www.math.kth.se/matstat/users/perh/diplomacy/

Hope all is well.

Rich Horton

Great idea!  You're the first to suggest it!  It's all yours, which
means I'll hound you endlessly until you send something in!

Stab you soon,
Manus

Thoughts from A Tournament Novice



	It all started with an Email announcement I found in my box this =
summer.  It seems there was a Email Diplomacy World Championship coming =
together out there somewhere, and I was cordially invited.  I'd like to =
say that I my imagination was fired from the start, but it wasn't.  =
While I had played a good deal of Diplomacy, both on the Judges and FTF, =
I had never taken part in an organized tournament of any kind.  As my =
professional life had taken me further away from those friends I used to =
spend afternoons with plotting the fate of Belgium and Greece, I had =
toyed with the idea of attending a FTF tournament, but nothing ever came =
of that.  Part of this was due to the busy life I had accidentally =
created for myself, but I must admit that I found the idea of competing =
in a FTF tournament a little intimidating.  I'd read the accounts of =
various tournaments in the pages of the Diplomatic Pouch, and while they =
sounded like glorious fun (particularly when it was Australians and New =
Zealanders doing the Dipping), the thought kept occurring that I might =
find myself completely out of my depth!
	However, an Email tournament might be a different beast all together.  =
1) I had plenty on experience playing Diplomacy on the Judges.  2) The =
Email format gives you plenty of time to devote on your diplomatic =
overtures AND tactics.  3) The chances were greater, or so I reasoned, =
that most players in a world Email tournament would be complete =
strangers to one another.  I wouldn't be singled out as some sort of =
interloper by a cadre of players familiar with one another.  All in all =
it looked like the perfect opportunity to ease myself into the world of =
tournament play.  So I took the plunge and signed myself up on the =
tournament bulletin board, and waited.
	It took awhile to get going, but as October 1st neared things started =
hopping.  I was assigned to team USA East II, which was later re-named =
the XYZ Affair.  None of my teammates expressed much interest in =
specific countries so I'm not even sure how it was decided who would =
play which.  I was assigned France and I was pleased with that.  My best =
Judge results had come while playing France.  I'd never had a solo win =
on a Judge, but I had been a part of two 3-way draws.  Both times I was =
France.  Things were looking good!
	It was at this point that I discovered some interesting things.  It =
seems that one of my teammates, Stephen Koehler was well known in the =
world of Diplomacy.  For this reason the early scuttlebutt about the =
tournament placed the XYZ Affair as one of the "Teams to Watch."  That's =
just great.... Here I am trying to get my feet wet and now I'm worried =
about dragging my whole team down.  The pressure had already started, =
and I hadn't even been placed on a board yet.  And then....
	I was placed on a board.  Not just any board but a board that was =
picked one of the "Boards to Watch."  There was not one, but three =
players of noted reputation on the board, including a former European =
Champion and another who runs one of the better known Diplomacy zines.  =
I wanted to wet my feet and I found myself swimming with the sharks!  It =
is a good thing I can roll with the punches (as opposed to reel with the =
stabs), as this offers me a golden opportunity to get a feel for what =
tournament play really entails. =20
	As I write this the game is entering its second year.  I won't go into =
much in the way of details as this is an on-going game, but I feel =
pretty good about the way things have started.  Germany and my France =
have moved against England, and, despite a balky Russia, the rest of the =
board is looking lively.  In future issues of the Pouch I'll update my =
progress in the game, as well as giving my evolving opinions on Email =
tournament play.  Who knows, maybe I'll scratch my way into the second =
round.  I wouldn't bet the farm on that, but I've got as good a shot as =
any.  (Famous Last Words anyone?)
