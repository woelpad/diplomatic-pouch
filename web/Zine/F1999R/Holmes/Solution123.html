    <h4>Solution Part 1</h4>
-->
    <P>The next day, when Holmes finally roused himself, I accosted him
    angrily.  "How could you just go to sleep with Masters languishing in jail.
    Didn't you owe it to him to do your utmost to solve the case?"  I was
    referring, of course, to 
      <a href="../../F1999M/Holmes/lethal.html">The 
	Case of the Lethal Alliance</a>
      which had been presented to Holmes and myself the night prior by the
      valet of General Masters, the accused.
    </P>

    <P>Holmes looked at me while rubbing his scalp. "My dear Watson, of course
    I owed that to him. Furthermore, I did indeed solve the case. Would you
    care for an explanation?" Holmes continued without looking up to see
    whether I had nodded (I had): "I didn't know whether or not I had
    sufficient information to solve this case. Now that I know that I did, of
    course, the solution is obvious, but that is the crisp beauty of
    hindsight.</P>

    <P>"Since we are assuming a single killer who wished to remain undetected,
    we need simply to determine whether anyone was alone with Whipple during
    conference at the fateful moment. </P>

    <P>"Examining the board we see that builds have been made, so we have
    direct evidence of a Winter 1901 adjustment. Further, we see that some
    built units have been moved two spaces – for example, the Fleet built in
    Marseilles. The Turkish fleet in Tunis also guarantees that moves progressed
    through Fall 1902.  This gives us all the information we need to establish
    the time line of the evening's diplomatic activities.</P>

    <P>"Adding up the time periods which Masters always allowed we see that
    there was time between 6:00 and 8:35 for four movement seasons with no
    retreats and two builds, four movement seasons with two retreats and no
    builds, or four movement seasons with one retreat and one build. Since we
    don't have evidence of a second build we can rule out the first option and
    conclude that play was halted after the resolution of movement orders Fall
    1902 and before build orders were processed (Winter 1902). Since we know
    that there was one build, we can also safely rule out the second option.
    </P>

    <P>"Thus we had one build and one retreat through Fall 1902. The question,
    then, is when was the retreat? As any beginning player knows, the initial
    set-up on the map guarantees that a retreat is impossible in Spring 1901.
    So let us consider, in turn, the possibility that the retreat occurred in
	each of the other three seasons of this game… Would you
	like me to do this on paper?"</P>

    <P>"Yes please," I said, rather weakly.</P>

    <P>"Since Whipple became ill around 8:35, the poisoning would have occurred
    ca.  7:45-7:50. Of the three candidate timelines, only the one with the
    Fall 1901 retreat allows for a conference at that time. This places the
    administration of the poison during the Spring 1902 diplomacy conference
    period. Spring 1902 is commonly a crowded session as alliances are becoming
    more reliably established and detailed plans can now be drawn. Plus there
    are the new builds to discuss.  So the murderer could count on a reasonable
    amount of time alone with the victim during Spring 1902!"</P>

    <P>"But Holmes", I interrupted, "Knowing when the retreat phase occurred
    doesn't tell us anything about the murder!"</P>

    <P>"My dear Watson" -- Holmes began to fill his pipe with a particularly
    aromatic tobacco -- "if you have learned anything from our association, I
    would hope that it is the necessity of methodical deduction, which if done
    properly and with full knowledge of the relevant facts of the case, should
    inescabably lead one to the correct and unique solution."</P>

    <P>Holmes smiled and busied himself for long minutes lighting his pipe
    before continuing. "Now you see, this is where the case becomes
    interesting. What might the single retreat in Fall 1901 tell us about the
    game a full year later?" Holmes paused dramatically. "Actually, it is the
    <i>absence</i> of a retreat in 1902 which is most informative about the
    disposition of units that year. To start with, since there were no retreats
    in 1902 and the build phase was never reached, we can begin to determine
    the supply center count for the end of Fall 1901. The units on the board at
    the end of Fall 1902 movement become a fairly reliable indicator of the
    supply center distribution at that time, especially since builds were not
    allowed to go unused in this game."</P>

    <P><img hspace="5" src="../../Common/stopsign.gif" align="left">
      <b><i>Now that Watson has provided a sense of the time-line and some
	additional clues towards the full solution can you deduce who 
	poisoned Whipple?  The more patient among us are invited to stop here
	and try to work further.</i></b>

<!--
    <h4>Solution Part 2</h4>
-->
    <P>Holmes pulled himself closer to the board. "Perhaps we should now begin
    a more detailed examination of the board. Consider for example the curious
    positioning of the Austrian fleet..."</P>

<P>
<center>
<table border=5><tr><td><img src=/Zine/F1999M/Holmes/lethal.gif></td></tr></table></center>


    <P>"But Holmes, there is no Austrian fleet!" I interrupted.</P>

    <P>"Precisely. The starting Austrian fleet has been disbanded. It could not
    have been disbanded during Winter 1901 adjustments because clearly Austria
    built a third army. As any Diplomacy player should know, a forced disband
    for that fleet is impossible in 1901, so it must have been disbanded when
    forced to retreat in 1901 or it was forced to disband without a retreat
    possible in 1902 (this latter possibility is obviously unlikely and we can
	    rule it out definitively once we have determined the movement of
	    the Turkish units). If Austria disbanded the fleet during the Fall
    1901 retreat, then it must have been immediately rebuilt with an army. This
    would suggest that it is most likely that Austria had a count of three
	supply centers at the end of 1901.</P>

    <P>"We can examine how Italy would have dislodged the fleet later.  Before
    deciding that, we should examine a few other pieces in this puzzle.  We see
    tactically and strategically interesting battles with Turkey and Austria
    emerging by the end of 1902. However, nothing about them suggests immediate
    relevance to the Spring of 1902. However, there is a single Italian army
    which is quite revealing."</P>

    <P>"An Italian unit in Holland is most peculiar this early in the game! Is
    that what you mean?" I asked.</P>

    <P>"Well," said Holmes growing amused, "how then do you suppose it got
    there?"</P>

    <P><img hspace="5" src="../../Common/stopsign.gif" align="left">
      <b><i>The next step in the solution is to determine the unit orders
	necessary for the Italian army to be in Holland by the end of the
	movement phase for Fall 1902.  It may be that you are able to find
	the full solution from there.  Give it a try!</i></b>
    </p>

<!--
    <h4>Solution Part 3</h4>
-->

    <P>I looked at the map for a few moments and decided that this was a fairly
    simple question. Holmes was right when he had told me while solving other
    cases that all solutions are simple if you just break them down into small
    enough parts. "Well," I began, "there are only two direct routes around
    Switzerland. To the West requires five moves, which you showed is
    impossible in terms of the timeline. So VEN-TYR-MUN-RUH or KIE - HOL is
    fairly obvious." I smiled graciously to Holmes to indicate that I too could
    be adept at solutions. I thought for a moment longer and frowned. "However,
    this still doesn't show us anything about conference communications."</P>

    <P>Holmes smiled in a way that seemed more patronizing than usual. "By
    itself, it does not. But let us keep what you just said in mind and now
    turn our attention to the East and the puzzle of the missing Russian. I
    think you will find this considerably more informative. "</P>

    <P>On this matter, I must admit, I was more uncertain. "But Holmes! This
    disappearance of the Russian units is surely impossible!" Holmes raised an
    eybrow at me when I uttered the word "impossible." Undaunted, I continued,
    "We saw from your very first case (<A
	    HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/Zine/S1995M/Woolley/Puzzle.html">The
	    Double Elimination Conundrum</A>) that Russia cannot be eliminated
    in the first year. If the game ended before adjustments in 1902, he should
    still have…" At this point I glanced at the board, "…at least two units
    remaining. Perhaps only one if you assume that Russia himself convoyed a
    German army into STP.&quot;</P>

    <P>Holmes smiled. &quot;No, Russia made a disasterous opening, but there is
    no reason to assume that he was suicidally helping the German to take
    Russian SCs. The solution to the Russian’s disappearance shows a clear
    interest in self-preservation. Indeed, without Russia’s attempts at
    self-defence, he would not have been eliminated so quickly!&quot;</P>

    <P>I frowned at the board. &quot;So you suggest that Russia would not have
    disbanded his last units instead of retreating?"</P>

    <P>Holmes continued, &quot;There would be no point in disbanding when you
    are losing your supply centers and have no hope of rebuilding. Besides,
    even if Russia had wanted to issue disband orders to dislodged units, they
    would have needed to have been written during a retreat order phase --
    which we have already demonstrated could not exist. The Russian units
    constitute the counter case to my general claim that the unit count
    indicates supply center ownership at the end of 1901. The original F STP/sc
    is missing and if you study the board for a minute, you can confirm that it
    could not have been from a forced disband." Holmes looked at me for
    confirmation. I nodded assent on the usual assumption that trust in Holmes'
    reasoning was warranted -- although the reader might wish to confirm this
    as well. </P>

    <P>Holmes smiled and continued, "Further, how might F SEV have disappeared?
    While this could have been disbanded during the F01 retreat, it or its
    replacement from W01 could not have been disbanded with both of the other
    Russian armies in 1902 as should be clear after we consider disbanding just
    the two Russian armies. So, Russia was obviously reduced to two supply
    centers by the end of 1901 and exactly two Russian units were dislodged in
    1902. However, they both could have had no opportunity of retreat since we
    have already determined that there were no retreat orders in 1902!" </P>

    <P>"Ah yes, obviously…" I muttered.</P>

    <P>&quot;James gave a useful hint to this effect when he reported that a
    player had remarked at the suspension of play that he had just become the
    only player to have issued orders in all phases. We can be fairly confident
    that Austria and Russia both issued retreat orders in Fall 1901. Only
    Russia could have had no orders to issue for movement in Fall 1902, and
    only then if his two armies had already been forced to disband in Spring
    1902. In principle, the moves could have been infered without that hint,
    but that casual statement allowed me to get to sleep considerably earlier
    than if it had not been made."</P>

    <P>"Even with this hint, there was still some work necessary to determine
    the positions of the two Russian armies at the beginning of Spring 1902.
    Since Russia disbanded both fleets, he could not have had control of any
    supply centers beyond Saint Petersburg and Moscow at the end of Fall 1901.
    That means that the armies could only have been located in GAL, BOH, PRU,
    LIV, FIN, SIL, UKR, ARM, or of course STP and MOS themselves. Finding a way
    in which one army in one of those positions could have been eliminated is
    trivial. Fortunately, the task is a bit more complex when two armies must
    be dislodged with no possibility of retreat!"</P>

    <P><img hspace="5" src="../../Common/stopsign.gif" align="left">
      <b><i>The next step is to determine the unit orders that allow for this
      state of affairs.  Keep in mind the final position of all units, of
      course.  Perhaps determining Russia's road to ruin will suggest a
	  solution as well.
      If you feel you have a solution, please <a href=mailto:dippouch@diplom.org>send it to The Pouch</a>. 
      Note that virually all orders for all powers will need to be determined 
      before you can be confident of a solution.  If you cannot determine a
      solution, then you will need to wait for the next issue to watch
      Holmes finish laying out his solution.  Happy sleuthing!</i></b>
