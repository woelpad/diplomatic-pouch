<H1 align=center>Avoiding Stabs 101</H1>
<H2 align=center><i>By Simon Szykman</i></H2>

<b>Background</b>
<p>
Last month, there was a message posted on <a href=news:rec.games.diplomacy>rec.games.diplomacy</a> by
somebody who was a repeat stab victim and wanted some advice.  
Now everyone who plays Diplomacy enough is a repeat stab victim
in the sense that every is going to get stabbed sometimes, and
the more you play, the more often those "sometimes" come up.
However, this player was stabbed a lot, and by a lot I mean
eight times in eight games.  The message ended with an appeal:
<p>
<i>No matter what I do, I'm stabbed by my ally.  I'd just like to
know why it is that this happens.  [...] While I
love the game and will continue to play, I'd just like to know what
prevents everyone else from being stabbed.</i>
<p>
Now that's an extreme case, I present it not to draw negative attention
to this one player.  Quite the opposite, actually--I comment the player
for feeling compelled, by virtue of his track record, to attempt to
identify a source of what was obviously a problem.
<p>
It was clear to him that he was doing
something wrong.  However, there are people out there who are at times
doing things wrong but may not be as aware of it if their record is not  
quite as consistent.  So I thought I'd share some of my own thoughts
on the subject of avoiding stabs.
<p>
First off, let me preface my remarks by drawing attention to the title
of the article: Avoiding Stabs 101.  Note the 101.  That means this is
introductory-level reading.  Not necessarily only for the complete newbie,
but aimed more at the novice players than experienced players.  I have a
high level of confidence that the advice which follows will be helpful
for many of the people who get stabbed often, and don't always know why.
If you don't have a problem with being stabbed (many novices don't and
more experienced players even less) then this article will not be of great
use.  It will either seem pretty obvious to you, or you will think "I 
don't do any of those things but I still don't get stabbed."  Well, good
for you; it means you've found a different set of solutions on your own
that work for you.  You don't need this article. 
<p>
I should also reiterate that you *will* get stabbed.  Even if you follow 
my advice, you will get stabbed.  I get stabbed.  It's inevitable if you
play enough, simply because an allies actions are fundamentally not something
you have complete control over.  All you can do is nudge, guide, and 
influence.  
You can do everything right and still get stabbed, but if you get stabbed
a lot, then you are probably not doing everything right.
You can't avoid stabs altogether, but you can avoid walking around 
with a big red bullseye painted on your back.  And that is what I hope to
help repeat stab victims do better.
<P>
Back to the original thread on r.g.d.  I was surprised at how many of
the responses to the question of how to avoid being stabbed went something
along the lines of "Stab first!".  Yikes.  That's a really silly reply.
That kind of reasoning can lead to a trigger happy power who is liable to
stab unpredictably out of fear of being stabbed.
<p>
Yes, if you plan to stab first, you will end up being stabbed less often.
However, the time to stab is when it is in your best interest to do so.
Obviously if you have good reason to believe you are about to be stabbed,
then stabbing first can be in your best interest.   But stabbing only in
order to be the one to stab first will often not be in your best interest.
If you stab merely to avoid being stabbed, then you may not be stabbing
for the right reasons, nor at the right times, and if you do not stab for
the right reasons nor at the right times, then you will not be as successful
in your games as you might otherwise be.
<p>
Now I am not saying that I've never been stabbed, but I have gone full
games, online and in tournaments, allied with cutthroat players for the
whole game and not been stabbed.  Why?  Because good players only stab
when it's in their best interest, so the best way to avoid being stabbed is
not to stab-just-to-stab-first, but to make conditions such that it is not
in your allies best interest to stab you.  Ironically, if you can do this
well, you will be less likely to be stabbed when playing with good players,
and more likely to be stabbed when playing with trigger-happy newbies who
stab-just-to-stab-first.
<p>
<b>Lesson 1: Don't make yourself a target</b>
<p>
If you want to
avoid being stabbed, then the first thing you need to learn is to not leave
yourself ripe for stabbing.  If you are being stabbed in every single
game you play, then the most likely problem is that you are leaving your
allies in a position that is too good to resist.  Some players will ally
with you and stick with you for the entire game no matter what.  But you
cannot rely on that occuring.  You cannot assume that you are playing with
somebody who will be faithful to the end.  If you do, you will find that
you are wrong much more often than not.
<p>
Most players only pass up so much
in the way of potential gains before they take action, whether you are their
ally or not.  If an ally can stab you for
multiple centers, with good prospects for more gains to follow, and
leaving you in a position where you are too crippled to hurt him back, then that
ally is often going to take the opening you've left available.  You need
to keep enough of a defense up that you are not ripe for a stab.  That
doesn't mean a putting up a solid defensive line like one you would put
up against a power you are at war with.  If you did that, you'd commit so
many of your resources defending against your ally that you couldn't
afford to commit units on a different front in a real war, making real gains.
It means having enough of a defense that the payoff for your ally
of attempting a stab is is questionable rather than overwhelming.  Whether
you realize it or not, if you are getting stabbed every single time, it's at
least in part because you are inviting your ally to do so by leaving
yourself open and inadequately defended.
<p>
<b>Lesson 2: Create incentive for sustaining an alliance</b>
<p>
The second thing you need to do to avoid being stabbed is use diplomacy.
When you talk to your ally make it clear why your ally should not stab you.
That does not mean you should threaten to retaliate or to throw the game
if you are attacked.  It means making clear to your ally why it is in his
best interest to keep you as an ally?  Why does he need you?  Why is he
better off with you than without you?  Why would stabbing you be a bad move?
<p>
I am not suggesting that you write a message saying "Hey ally, you should not
stab me because...."  A message that lacking in subtlety is unlikely to do
the trick.  Don't tell him "You need me because..."  Instead, inject these
things into your general discussions so that they make a case for
why the alliance is in your ally's interest.  Giving your ally reasons to
remain allied with you will be more effective if you aren't outright telling
him that you are giving him reasons why he should remain allied with you.
<p>
If yor make a convincing
enough case, then a good player will not stab you.  The issue, obviously, is
that you don't always know what to say.  What might convince one person may
not be the same argument that would convince another.  And as I said above,
you will not always be playing with a player who stabs only when it's in his
best interest, in which case offering reasons to remain allied, even good
ones, will not always be successful.  With players such as these, you rely
more on Lesson 1 than Lesson 2, since even a more erratic stabber will be
less likely to stab you the less likely he is to gain from it.
<p>
<b>Lesson 3: Be a "good" ally</b>
<p>
I mentioned above that while I
don't advocate stabbing merely to stab first, stabbing first is in somebody's
interest when they have reason to believe they are going to be stabbed. 
Therefore, the flip side of everything mentioned above also applies.  You
should, in the course of diplomacy, attempt to convince your ally that it
is in your best interest to remain allied with him.  The simple reason for
this is because the less worried he is about you stabbing him, the less it
is that he thinks it is in his best interest to stab you.  And you can bet
that there will be times when other powers are trying to convince your
ally to stab you, and that sometimes the argument they will make for why your
ally should stab you is an assurance that you are about to stab your ally.
The less your ally is worried about you, the safer you are.
<p>
<b>Lesson 4: Conflict resolution</b>
<p>
There will unavoidably be some conflict in the options that face you if
you decide to follow the advice given above.  You want to be
well defended enough to make the payoff of a stab low, and yet you want
to convince your ally that you are not a threat to him.  This is sometimes
hard to do when you are trying to use some of your units to defend against
an ally since your ally may see your defensive units as potential offensive
units.
<p>
Overinvesting in defense not only makes it hard for you to carry out offensive
actions against real enemies, it is also a source of concern to an ally that
if sufficiently strong, could lead to a stab.  But it is equally important to
note that while demilitarization can be part of making yourself
less threatening to an ally, do not demilitarize yourself to the point where
you are open to attack and unable to respond.  As pointed out in Lesson 1,
you'll only be inviting trouble by doing that.
<p>
There is not much I can say specifically about resolving these conflicts, 
other than drawing attention to them.  You need to figure out the right
balance between these conflicting suggestions, and that needs to be done
on a game-by-game basis because there is no one right balance.
<p>
<b>Lesson 5: The Post Mortem</b>
<p>
The most important lesson you can learn is one that applies to all aspects
of Diplomacy: to learn from your mistakes.  As I've said before, stabs are
inevitable, so the best thing you can do when they do happen, is to analyze
the situation and find out why it happened.  Did somebody convince your 
ally to stab you by convincing him you were going to stab him (and could you
therefore have done a better job at getting across your commitment to the
alliance)?  Did you get stabbed because you made yourself too attractive
a target (and could you therefore have done a better job at making yourself
less vulnerable)?  Did an excessive number of defensive units result in a
preemptive strike by your ally who was paranoid about the possibility of
you attacking him (and could you therefore have done a better job at 
ensuring your safety in a manner that would appear less threatening to your
ally)?
<p>
Of course, in some cases, being stabbed will just be "one of those things".
You may get stabbed because your ally thinks he's in a position to successfully
go for a solo or shrink a draw by getting rid of you.  When an ally believes
that, it's hard for you to make a convincing argument for why he needs you.
Sometimes you get set up from the start and it turns out that your ally was
never really your ally to begin with.  While the advice imparted in this article
has to do with how to avoid being stabbed by somebody who is at some point
really your ally, it is still worth asking yourself why it happened even in
other cases.  For example, if it turns out that you are being set up quite often
by a neighbor who pretends to ally with you only to stab you early on, that 
may point to the need to improve your negotiation skills for how to 
establish an alliance early on in the game (something that is outside the
scope of this article.
<p>
The point is, the advice given above is not clear and crisp.  I fully
acknowledge that everything I've said above is easier said than done.
Every game is
different, and every player is different and has different levels of trust, 
different levels of paranoia, different levels of temptation or fear he's willing
to tolerate before stabbing.  You need to not only know the information I've
presented above, but you need to know how to read a situation and/or a player
in order to apply it at the appropriate level.  You need to know how to find
the right balance between the conflicts I highlighted.  In order to improve
your ability to do that, every stab should be a learning experience.  Do
not allow a stab to happen without learning something from it that will make
you more likely to avoid a similar mistake the next time around.
<p>
<b>Homework</b>
<p>
I personally, have found the above lessons invaluable in my
own play, and I've learned from experience.  In my early days as a
Diplomacy player, I learned these lessons the hard way--I got stabbed
a lot.  So I distilled what I've learned since then into Avoiding Stabs
101.  I cannot guarantee that you will never be stabbed again if you follow
the above advice.  But if you've had a problem being the victim of stabs
in an excessive percentage of the games in which you play, I think the
above advice may be of help.  If you are such a player, your homework
is to apply the above knowledge in the next few games you play and let
me know if it makes a difference.
