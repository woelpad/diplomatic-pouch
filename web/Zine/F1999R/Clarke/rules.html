<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">TOURNAMENT DIRECTOR:</font> </b>Grant Torrie
<p><b>DISPUTES COMMITTEE: </b>Grant Torrie, Craig Sedgwick, Quentin Ball,
Jimmy Millington. The Tournament Director may alter the members of the
Disputes Committee at his sole discretion.
<p><b>1. The Rules:</b> The standard 1982 North American rule book applies
except where amended below. A copy of this rulebook will be on the Tournament
Director's table.
<dl><b>2. Rounds:</b> The Tournament consists of three rounds, played over
two days:
<dl>
<ul>
<li>
Day one: Saturday August 28, 1999</li>
<li>
Day two: Sunday August 29, 1999</li>
</ul>
</dl>
</dl>
In each round players will be allocated to tables and countries by the
organiser according to a secret roster. Players may play in any or all
of the rounds.
<p><b>3. Round timings:</b> Players are required to report to the venue
at 9:00a.m. Saturday, and 10.00a.m. on Sunday. All efforts will be undertaken
to commence games on time, so please do not be late as you may miss out
on a game. The Tournament Director reserves the right to delay the start
of any round at his sole discretion. To avoid a "last minute rush" for
supply centres, the times at which each round finishes are set by the Tournament
Director, and are NOT available to any other person. The second round will
commence sometime in the afternoon of the first day's play and the third
round will commence sometime during the second day's play. Round 2 may
continue overnight, at the Tournament Director's sole discretion.
<p><b>4. Registration:</b> All prospective tournament entrants MUST complete
a Tournament Registration Form upon arrival at the Tournament Director&#8217;s
table at the venue. Please complete all parts of the form and return to
the Tournament Director&#8217;s table.
<p><b>5. Stand-downs:</b> If there is not a multiple of seven players the
Tournament Director may make up a multiple of seven by playing GM positions,
or may ask people to stand down. Standing-down players shall be at the
sole discretion of the Tournament Director however, this will only be requested
if absolutely necessary.
<p><b>6. Seasons:</b> Games will be played with a "Spring" negotiation
period, and a "Fall" negotiation period. Retreats and Adjustments will
be part of the negotiation time for the following period. The time allocated
to the "Fall" negotiation period will start immediately after the time
allocated to the "Spring" negotiation period has elapsed, and the time
allocated to the "Spring" negotiation period will begin immediately after
the time allocated to the preceding "Fall" negotiation period has elapsed.
For the first two game years of each round each season shall be 20 minutes.
Starting with Spring 1903 this will be reduced to 15 minutes per season.
At any stage after 1908 the times may be reduced further at the Tournament
Director&#8217;s sole discretion. At the end of each season, when the time limit
expires the Tournament Director will call "Time". Negotiation periods will
be displayed at the tournament venue and will be adhered to strictly. Adjustment
of times may occur at the Tournament Director's sole discretion. It is
the players&#8217; responsibility to resolve Retreats and Adjustments quickly
to avoid losing much time from the subsequent negotiation period.
<p><b>7. Retreats and Adjustments:</b> The Retreats and The Adjustments
phases are each regarded as seperate phases. No negotiating or "diploming"
is allowed during Retreats or Adjustments phases. Any player may request
clarification of the available retreat options for a dislodged unit, but
otherwise no Diplomacy is permitted. Retreats MUST be written down, and
are revealed simultaneously. Winter adjustments happen AFTER the resolution
of Fall retreats. For the adjustments phase all builds and disbands MUST
also be written down and then revealed simultaneously.
<p><b>8. Warnings of approaching deadlines:</b> It is each player&#8217;s responsibility
to be aware of approaching deadlines. A warning may be given 2 minutes
before the expiration of the negotiation period, and again at 1 minute,
30 seconds and 10 seconds before the completion of the negotiation period.
However, failure of the Tournament Director to announce these warnings
will not result in the deadline being extended.
<p><b>9. Submission of orders:</b> Deadlines will be strictly applied.
On each table there will be a designated box for collection of orders.
Players must have their orders in the "orders box" when the Tournament
Director calls the completion of the negotiation period. In the event that
a player places their orders after the Tournament Director has called the
completion of the negotiation period then that player&#8217;s orders shall be
considered "late". The first time that a player's orders are late, they
will receive a verbal warning. On second and subsequent occurrences any
player without orders in the "orders box" at the completion of the negotiation
period i.e. whose orders are late, will be considered in Civil Disorder
as per Rulebook Rule XIV Civil Disorder. Persistent offenders may be disqualified
from the round, or indeed the whole tournament, at the Tournament Director's
sole discretion, or incur any other penalty (such as a points deduction)
that the Tournament Director deems appropriate. No orders may be accepted
once the reading of orders has commenced. In the event that no orders have
been received by a player once the reading of orders has commenced, that
player&#8217;s country will be considered in Civil Disorder as per Rulebook Rule
XIV Civil Disorder.
<p><i>Please note:</i> A verbal warning is applicable for the entire tournament.
<p><b>10. Order content:</b> All orders should include the year, season,
game name (or designated letter), country being played and player name
and must be signed. Failure to do so <u>may</u> mean that the orders are
disallowed, at the Tournament Director's sole discretion. Joint orders
signed by two or more players are acceptable, perpetual and proxy orders
are not acceptable.
<p><b>11. Notation and syntax:</b> The use of army and fleet notations
and country designators where appropriate is recommended, but not compulsory.
All orders must use unambiguous space abbreviations or full names. A list
of <i>recommended</i> space abbreviations is appended to these Tournament
Rules. (See <font face="Lucida Sans"><a href="#Appendix A">Appendix A</a>)</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>12. Reading the orders by the 'designated
power': </b>Each season, after the time allocated to the negotiation period
has elapsed, the designated power for that turn will read their own orders
FIRST, and THEN read each of the other power's orders for that season.
In Spring 1901 'the designated power' at each table will be Austria-Hungary.
Each subsequent season the 'designated power' will pass one power <i>clockwise</i>,
based on <b>the order in which the powers are printed around the border
of the Diplomacy Board</b>. If the designated power is not at the board
for whatever reason (late, eliminated, etc.) then "the designated player"
shall pass <i>clockwise </i>one player until there is a designated player
present.</font>
<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">13. Game Ending Conditions and Provisions:</font></b>
<dir><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>Concessions: </b>No games may be conceded
to a player as a solo victory. All games must be played out until the Tournament
Director calls a time draw, or all players agree to a draw as provided
for in "voted draws".</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>Time Draws:</b> Due to the need to get three
rounds of Diplomacy in one weekend, the Tournament Director may, at the
expiration of <u>any</u> deadline, enforce a time draw. If the deadline
that has just expired is a Fall deadline, retreats will be allowed (with
NO negotiations) but builds will be unnecessary. SC counts will be conducted
and recorded after the Fall retreats. If the deadline that has just expired
is a Spring deadline, the game will stop immediately and the SC counts
from the previous Fall shall be the game end positions.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>Voted Draws: </b>At any time the players
of a game may request the Tournament Director conduct a draw vote. All
surviving players must agree to a vote for a draw for the vote to proceed.
The definition of a surviving player is: 'A surviving player includes any
player who, when the draw is proposed, owns at least one supply centre
regardless of who occupies that centre'.&nbsp; Please do not call the Tournament
Director to your table if you do not have a unanimous agreement to conduct
a draw vote. <i>Please note: Agreeing to participate in a draw vote does
NOT mean you intend to vote FOR the draw.</i></font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">The tournament Director will provide each surviving
player with two voting tokens, which the players MUST keep from view of
the other players for the duration of the draw vote. Failure to do so will
be looked upon seriously by the Tournament Director. No distinction is
made between accidental and deliberate revealing of draw tokens. Revealing
a draw token <b>may result in disqualification.</b></font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">One voting token will be white and one will
be brown. The white token will indicate support for the draw proposal;
the brown one will indicate the player is against the draw proposal. <u>Draws
Include All Survivors</u>. The Tournament Director will have a box which
he will hold aloft, and he will invite each surviving player to place one
of their voting tokens in the box, whilst keeping the other token hidden.
Once all surviving players have voted the Tournament Director will announce
whether the draw is carried. All surviving players must place a white token
in the voting box for the draw to be carried.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">If the draw is carried, the game ends immediately,
and the last completed fall turn (including retreats) will be counted as
the game ending position. If the draw vote is not carried all surviving
players will place their other voting token in the box (without revealing
it to anyone at all) and the game will continue.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">Only one draw vote per season per board will
be allowed.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">Any games ending in any process other than
that outlined above, excluding those ending in a solo victory (18 centres
or more) to one player, will be considered abandoned games, and all players
in that game will be scored zero points for the game.</font></dir>
<b><font face="Lucida Sans">14. Convoys:</font></b>
<dir><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>The unwanted convoy: </b>'Unwanted' convoys
for Armies moving along the coast are legal, cannot be refused. If players
are concerned about this sort of thing they should employ the Ken Lowe
Convention of specifying the convoy route they intend for their army in
the order of the army (e.g. A WAL - IRI - MAO - NAF).</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>More than one convoy route: </b>If the orders
as written permit more than one route by which the convoyed army could
proceed from it's source to it's destination, the order is not void on
account of this ambiguity; and the army is not prevented from moving due
to the dislodgement of fleets, unless all the routes are disrupted.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>Convoying an attack on one of your own units:
</b>An
order by one country which convoys an attack by another country against
a space occupied by one of the first country's units does not permit a
move dislodging that unit, but may be valid for other purposes.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>Pandin's Paradox: </b>If an army being convoyed
would cut a support being offered by a fleet, which is needed to dislodge
one of the fleets convoying THAT army ("Pandin's Paradox"), then the convoy
does not succeed, but neither is the fleet dislodged.</font></dir>
<b><font face="Lucida Sans">15. Building and Disbanding:</font></b>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">Fleets may not be built in inland provinces.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">Players should note that under rule XIII. <b>Gaining
and Losing Units </b>part 2. Building and removing units (adjustments)
it says: "...If he has fewer centres than units, he <b>MUST</b> [my emphasis]
disband the excess units only, by removing them from the board. The units
removed may be any of his units he chooses. If he has more centres than
units, he <b>MAY</b> [my emphasis] build units...". Failure to disband
when you are required to <u>may</u> be viewed as cheating by the Tournament
Director.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>16. Misorders:</b> The Rulebook's ruling
on misorders is somewhat ambiguous, and doesn't provide much scope for
Deliberate Misorders when there isn't a G.M. Hence, the following rules
on misorders will apply :</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Players may use any valid, unambiguous abbreviation,
or the full name, for a province.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">It is preferred that you always specify coasts
for fleets in multi-coasted provinces. You must always specify the correct
coast when moving (or supporting) a fleet to a multi-coasted province,
or building a fleet in St Petersburg.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Orders which are not ambiguous, but which nevertheless
indicate an attempt by a unit to do something impossible under the rules,
will be interpreted as "illegal orders". Units with Illegal orders simply
stand in place, and may NOT receive support to hold. Note: attempts to
move to a space occupied by one of your own units (i.e. self dislodgement)
does not constitute an illegal order.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Misorders which are nevertheless legal, if unambiguous,
are followed.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Ambiguous orders (ones which could admit more
than one meaning) are not followed. Units so ordered simply stand in place,
and MAY receive support to hold.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">An order that has bad or incomplete syntax, but
which nevertheless can admit only one meaning, is followed. If necessary
the Tournament Director will rule on this issue. Be warned, the Tournament
Director will tend towards ruling the order ambiguous, so write clearly
and if in doubt write the space's full name and the nationality of the
units concerned.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">The Tournament Director, if required, will be
the final judge of whether an order is ambiguous or not, but may choose
to consult members of the disputes committee at his convenience.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><b>17. Miscellaneous: </b>The following rule points
are worth emphasising:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Spain and North Africa are not adjacent. Norway
and St. Petersburg are adjacent.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Fleets may support another fleet moving to the
other coast of a multi-coasted province (e.g. F(GOB) S F(Nwy)-StPNc is
legal).</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Coastal crawl and Crawling Retreats are not permitted
(e.g. two units moving F(SpaNc)-Por, F(Por)-SpaSc is a stand-off).</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Convoys can be disrupted only by attacking and
dislodging the convoying fleet -- merely attacking it is not enough.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">If two units are ordered to the same space, and
one of them is dislodged by a unit coming from that space, the other unit
may move.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><b>18. Errors:</b> Any errors in move resolution
must be pointed out to the Tournament Director immediately for rectification.
Errors which remain undetected until after the next seasons adjudication
will only be corrected at the discretion of the Tournament Director.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>19. Seeding and the Tournament Draw:</b>
Players have not been rated for this tournament. Players have however been
assigned a random seed which has been applied to a set draw. While two
players may meet twice (but not 3 times) over the 3 rounds, attempts have
been to reduce the number of groups of 3 players meeting more than once
in a tournament to zero. Board allocations are made at the sole discretion
of the Tournament Director.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>20. Country Assignment:</b> Countries for
each player have been pre-assigned so that each player only plays one Great
Power from each of 3 groups. The three groups are:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">England, France and Germany</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Russia and Turkey</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Austria/Hungary and Italy</font></li>
</ul>
<dir><b><font face="Lucida Sans">Please note that rules 20 &amp; 21 are
a guide to the conduct of the tournament and may be altered at the Tournament
Director&#8217;s sole discretion.</font></b></dir>
<font face="Lucida Sans"><b>21. Negotiations:</b> There are "no holds barred"
in dealings between players. However, the use of physical force or physical
damage to property is banned and may lead to disqualification. Likewise,
bribery is frowned upon and offenders will be "exposed before their peers."
The organisers can in no way be held responsible for any illegal acts performed
by players.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>22. Outside assistance: </b>No player from
outside the board may aid or abet another player, directly or indirectly,
with their orders or their diplomacy. Players doing so may be disqualified
from the tournament and, if the Tournament Director sees fit, the Player
"receiving the outside assistance" will be scored as zero in that game.
Players that have been eliminated from a board may still participate by
way of offering assistance to players still in that game.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>23. Finishing positions:</b> Players&#8217; relative
positions will not be revealed until the awards ceremony on Sunday. The
Tournament will be scored using the <a href="#Appendix_B">Detour98f </a>scoring
system. The Tournament Director&#8217;s calculations will not be open for scrutiny
and the Tournament Director is under no obligation to enter into correspondence
regarding any aspect of the tournament placings.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>24. Misconduct:</b> Misconduct by players
may result in: a) a verbal warning, b) a season suspension, c) a game suspension,
d) disqualification from the championships without refund. The Tournament
Director may incur any other penalty that he feels is appropriate e.g.
deduction of points scored in a round or in the tournament. Penalties are
not necessarily applied in that order.</font>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans"><b>25. Indemnity:</b> All players agree to
accept all judgements and directions given them by the Tournament Director.
The Tournament Director may rule in areas not covered by these rules and
may over-ride these rules at his sole discretion.</font>
<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">26. </font>Teams Competition: </b>The third
round of the Tournament will double as the Teams Round. The Rules for the
Teams Round are as follows:
<p>To enter the teams competition a player must fill out the a portion
of a teams entry form which will be available from the Tournament Director
during enrollment, and throughout rounds 1 and 2. One teams entry form
needs to be filled out per team, but each player in the team must fill
out and sign their section of the form. Teams are limited to a maximum
size of three players per team. Each player may only be a member of one
team.
<p>In round three no two members of the same team will be playing on the
same board. As well as counting towards a player's overall individual score
in the tournament, each player's score in round 3 will count towards that
player's team's score. The team with the highest combined score will win
the teams competition. The same tie breakers will be used to split any
ties in the teams competition as will be used in the individual competition.
See <a href="#Appendix_B">Apendix B</a>.
<p><b>27. Board Games Competition:</b> Throughout the tournament there
will be a board games competition run along side the main Diplomacy event.
Players may play in as many or as few boardgames in the boardgames competition
as they like. Any game of the listed games played is elligible to be included
in the boardgames competition (if a score sheet for the game is submitted),
unless the players agree before the game starts that it will not be included
in the boardgames competition. For a game to count in the boardgames competition
a "Boardgames Competition Score Sheet" must be completed and handed in
to the Tournament Director by the end of Round 3 in the Diplomacy Tournament.
Games which finish after the completion of Round 3 of the Diplomacy Tournament
will not count. Any player may submit a "Boardgames Competition Score Sheet",
which must be signed by the players in that game. Players refusing to sign
a score sheet which they played in will be handled at the Tournament Directors
discretion. If you played in a game, sign the sheet. If you want to leave
before the game is completed, sign the sheet.

<p><b>Scoring</b>
<br>Points will be scored according to the finishing position of players
in each game. This will then be weighted according to the average length
of each game, so that someone playing lots of short games doesn't have
an undue advantage over someone playing a few long games. Points vary depending
on the number of players in the game:

<p><a NAME="Appendix_B"></a>
<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">Appendix B: Scoring.</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">The tournament will be scored using the
DETOUR 98f Scoring System:</font></b>
<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">Part 1. Scoring of games resulting in a
DRAW</font></b>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">(total of scores from a drawn game = 100 points)</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Each player will score one point for every centre
that they hold at the termination of a game.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Each player is awarded 1 point for survival (holds
at least 1 centre) at the completion of the adjustments phase following
Fall 1905.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Each player that has 1 or more centres at the
end of the game is awarded 1 point. Please note that a player need not
actually have units on the board, it is ownership of supply centres that
matters.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">If one player is the outright leader (has more
centres than any other player) he is awarded points equal to the difference
between the number of centres he holds and the number of centres held by
the player with the second highest number of centres. If more than one
player finishes on the most number of centres, no points are allocated
in this section.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">The first four players are allocated the following
points: 1st: 4, 2nd: 3, 3rd: 2, 4th: 1. Where two or more players finish
on equal centres points are allocated to those players for the lower position.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">All scores resulting from a draw game will be
standardised (calculated as a percentage of total scores from that game)
and converted so that the total of scores from a draw game equals 100 points
(individual scores will be rounded to three decimal places, so the total
score from a game could conceivably exceed 100 points)</font></li>
<dt>
</dt>
</ul>
<b><font face="Lucida Sans">Part 2. Scoring of games resulting in an 18
centre WIN</font></b>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">1.The winning player will score 110 points.</font>
<br><font face="Lucida Sans">2. All other players in the game will score
0 points.</font>
<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">Part 3. Tournament results</font></b>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">At the end of the tournament, scores from each
player's games will be added together and the player with the most points
declared the winner. Tiebreakers will be used to separate players on equal
points, with the following tiebreakers used in order:</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">The player with the most wins.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">The player included in the most drawn games.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">The player with the better 'best' game.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">The player with the better 'second best' game.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">The player with the better 'third best' game.</font></li>
</ul>
<font face="Lucida Sans">If two or more players cannot be split after using
tiebreakers then they are considered to have finished equal.</font>
<p><b><font face="Lucida Sans">Part 4. Comparing Games</font></b>
<p><font face="Lucida Sans">Games will be compared in the following order
for tiebreakers, including tie-breaking best country awards. If a condition
cannot split two players then the next condition is used.</font>
<ul>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Win beats Draw beats Elimination beats Loss (therefore
a game where a player loses will be considered below an Elimination or
Draw even though more tournament points may be gained).</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Points from game.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Position finished in game based on centres (1st,
2nd 3rd etc.). Note an equal 1st is considered behind an outright 1st but
ahead of a 2<sup>nd</sup>, also the more players finishing equal, the less
it is worth. E.g. equal 2nd with 2 players is better than equal 2nd with
3.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">If both eliminated, longest survival based on
fall supply centres. If both survived the same number of game years, the
higher SC count in the last year in which SCs were held.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Highest score when subtracting the score of the
player finishing 1st in that game.</font></li>
<li>
<font face="Lucida Sans">Same for 2nd to 7th (zero used for eliminated
players).</font></li>
</ul>
