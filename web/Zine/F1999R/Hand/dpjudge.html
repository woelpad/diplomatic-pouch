<H2 align=center>An Overview, a History, and a Status</H2>
<H3 align=center><i>by Manus Hand</i></H3>
<HR><P>
Even before I published the first issue of The Pouch Zine -- fully five
years ago now (wow!) -- I had a vision of a Web-based adjudicator.  Now
this vision is close enough to reality to write about.  In this article,
I plan not only to hit on some of the unique features of the DPjudge,
but also reflect on the rather strange path that led to its realization.
<P>
I set out writing this article intending to keep it short.  The plan was
simply to list for you the features of
the DPjudge.  This is still done (at the bottom of the article) but my
typing fingers took me on more of a trip down memory lane than I thought
they would.  So before we get started, I'd like to apologize beforehand to
any of you who might not find the history of a software development project
interesting reading.  I've tried not to be too dry and boring, and, well,
believe it or not, it's actually exciting reading for people like me, so
give it a shot; it's not bad.
<H3>What is the DPjudge?</H3>
Before discussing how the DPjudge came to be, it might be nice to actually
explain what the DPjudge is.  Perhaps the best way to do this is simply
to point you to the DPjudge itself and let it teach you.
<H4 align=center>
The DPjudge can be found at:
<a href=/dpjudge>http://www.diplom.org/dpjudge</a>.
</H4>
What will you find when you get there?  In brief, you will find a number
of active and completed Diplomacy games (and perhaps a few that are forming --
waiting for players).  Right there on the Web.  A map is viewable for each
game, and if you happen to be playing a power in any of the games, you may
enter your password at the Website and be treated to a page all your own,
where you can enter orders, compose press messages, and do all other things
the leader of a major power should be able to do.
<P>
That's about all the explanation that I will give in this brief article.  We'll
be discussing, later in this article, some of the features of the DPjudge
that make it unique, but for the complete story, head for the DPjudge
itself, and explore its documentation pages (by clicking on
<a href=/dpjudge?page=About>"About the
DPjudge"</a> and
<a href=/dpjudge?page=Questions>"DPjudge
Questions"</a>).
<H3>Origins of The Pouch</H3>
I named the DPjudge after The Diplomatic Pouch.
This is because -- as you're about to find out -- the two Websites really
grew out of each other.
<!--
(By the way, yes, someday a DPjudge installation will be put here at
<tt>diplom.org</tt>, home of The Pouch.  More on this later.)
-->
<P>
In 1994 I had my first Diplomacy article published: an article laying out
the rules for the <a href=/Online/variants/crystalball.html>"Crystal Ball
Diplomacy"</a> variant that I had created with
John Woolley.  This article appeared in the pages of <i>Diplomacy World</i>,
and by then the bug had bitten me hard.  I quickly submitted a second article,
this one on the <a href=/Zine/W1995A/Payola>"Payola Diplomacy"</a> variant.
<P>
At just this time, though, <i>Diplomacy World</i> seemingly ceased publication.
As the scheduled publication date fell further and further in the past, I decided
to take action on my own so that the hobby could read my all-important article
(I've never been the most modest guy; maybe you've noticed).
The result, of course, was The Diplomatic Pouch.
<P>
As I said in an interview in these pages a couple of years ago, the original
intent was that The Diplomatic Pouch would be a print magazine, not a Webzine.
(In 1994, there was no such thing as a Webzine.)  A couple of
things caused The Pouch to blaze its trail on the Web rather than into
postal mailboxes:
<ol>
<li>I dreaded maintaining a mailing list, printing reams of paper, licking
envelopes, collecting subscription money.  I had resigned myself to the
necessity of all this, but I truly dreaded it.  To be honest, I probably
would have folded after about the first two issues if The Pouch had
been a postal zine.  Frankly, I don't know how the Postal 'zine publishers
do it.
<li>I couldn't find a decent desktop publishing package (remember, this was
1994), or, if I did, I didn't want to pay for it.  So I decided to
compose The Pouch Zine using HTML and the Web.  My intention, though,
was to push "Print" on the formatted Web pages, and still go through
the postal rigamarole.
</ol>
Luckily, the light bulb went on during the editing of the first issue.  I
realized that all I needed to do was make the formatted Webpages publically
accessible, <i>et voila!</i>  No subscriber list, no printing and enveloping,
and no real restriction on issue size.  Good thing, too, because it turns out
that the first issue of The Pouch (and those subsequent, of course) is
something like 100 pages long.  I could never have afforded to mail such a
tome around.
<P>
Nice capsule history of the early Diplomatic Pouch, but I hear you asking
"what does this have to do with the DPjudge?"  Well, I'll tell you.
<P>
When that light bulb went on and I realized that I had birthed the concept of
Diplomacy on the Web, my natural inclination was to plan to bring more than
just article content there, but to host games, with maps and everything.
Easier said than done, of course, especially when you're as busy as I have
made myself with The Pouch and everything else.  But the seed of the DPjudge
had been planted in my mind coincident with the germination of The Pouch itself.
<P>
And remember, the whole <i>raison d'etre</i> for The Pouch was my impatience
to announce my "Payola" variant after having foisted "Crystal Ball" on the
unsuspecting hobby.  These two variants were to continue to play a crucial
role in driving the DPjudge to completion.
<P>
Before we actually get into that, you might be interested to know how The
Pouch eventually fulfilled its original mission -- to publicize the "Payola"
variant.  If you look back in the pages of The Pouch, you will see that I
didn't actually publish an <a href=/Zine/W1995A/Payola>article on Payola</a>
until the fifth issue of the Zine.  There were a few reasons for this:
<ol>
<li>Unlike my Crystal Ball article, I decided to actually have Payola
playtested before publishing anything about it.  (Yes, that's right,
I believe Crystal Ball was completely untested when it was announced in
<i>Diplomacy World</i>.  Perhaps the first game was underway but not
completed.  Luckily, <a href=/Online/variants/crystalball.html>the Crystal Ball rules</a> have remained virtually
static since initial publication, though.)  So I waited until a few
Payola games were completed before publishing my article.
<li>The quality and size of the Pouch Zine issues were not being hurt by
my holding the Payola article (this is a credit to all the contributors
who answered my earliest calls for articles).
<li>I had time (and -- with the decision to publish <i>via</i> the Web -- the
space) to revise and expand the article, and make it truly what I wanted
it to be: a complete set of rules, fully annotated with design
notes and anecdotes from play.
</ol>
<P>
And so Payola was announced.  And the base of Payola players started to grow.
By contrast, the Crystal Ball variant, having had no exposure on the Internet,
lived only in the back of my mind.  Even the first-ever test game was
quietly abandoned in mid-stream as I got too busy with editing The Pouch.
<H3>Origins of the DPjudge</H3>
Why did I find it necessary to abandon (as its Master) the first-ever
Crystal Ball game?  As I said, I got too  busy with The Pouch to do the
hand-adjudication that was necessary.  Because, by its nature, Crystal Ball
could not be run on a normal Ken Lowe Internet judge computer, I adjudicated
all the turns myself, and out of stubbornness and an interest in reading
all the press, I insisted that the players not know against whom they were
playing, so I was also a human forwarding mechanism for all the
player-to-player messages (again, remember this was 1995; yes, I know it
could have been automated even then, but the fact is that I didn't go to
the trouble).
<P>
The point is that Hand-adjudicating Crystal Ball Diplomacy was a pain.
And the Payola variant suffered from the same problem.  Both variants
required either an attentive and active GameMaster, or some form of
automatic pre-processing before moves could be resolved.  Since no such
automation existed, I was forced to be an attentive and active GameMaster.
And given that I was already overactive here at The Pouch, the variants
could have suffered.
<P>
One of them did.  As I mentioned, Crystal Ball was basically forgotten.
In fact, it wasn't until the most recent issue of The Pouch, when Joe
Carl submitted an <a href=/Zine/F1999M/Carl/crystal.html>article on Crystal
Ball</a> that any space in the Zine was devoted to it.
However,  I did force myself to make time to start creating something to aid in
the adjudication of Payola variant games.  This started as a standalone
program, completely unattached to anything (let alone to the World Wide
Web) to which I, the GM, would feed each player's "bribes" and which would
spit out to me the orders to be issued to each of the players' units.
<H3>Initial Interaction With The Ken Lowe Judge</H3>
The rest, as they say, is history.  But since I'm writing the history of
the DPjudge, I can't use that cop-out, so -- before you can get to all the
cool stuff that makes the DPjudge unique -- you have to put up with me telling
you about how the snowball grew as it rolled downhill.
<P>
The most important early development in the Payola bribe adjudicator was
the ability to feed the output of this standalone program directly to a Ken Lowe
judge.  By allowing a Ken Lowe judge to do all the grunt work (actually
deciding on bounces, dislodges, and -- most of all -- press forwarding and
deadlines!), I was freed to concentrate on fine-tuning and expanding the bribe
processing code.
<P>
In fact, the pre-existence of the Ken Lowe judge
was by far the most important single factor in the eventual growth of the
DPjudge.  Were it not for being able to run games on a Ken Lowe judge, the
player base would never have expanded for my variants, and they may have
ended up on the heap.  Also, the Ken Lowe judge provided a model for the
eventual functionality (especially the e-mail input and output) of the DPjudge.  As you'll
read later on, the results and other e-mailed output of the DPjudge have
been constructed to mimic the Ken Lowe judge in nearly every respect.
This enables the DPjudge to take advantage of all the hobby projects that
have grown up over the years which accept and expect Ken Lowe judge-formatted
text as their input.
<P>
But I'm getting ahead of myself.  At the point I went off on this tangent,
remember that the DPjudge was still nothing but a standalone computer program
that I, the GM, would execute whenever I had mail from a player.  I would
then manually forward the output to the Ken Lowe judge (which would either
<tt>HOLD</tt> a player's units when his "bribe" offers were received, so as
not to mark him late if another player didn't make the deadline, or
actually issue the orders for adjudication if all of the players' "bribes"
were submitted).
<H3>The Webification</H3>
Slowly, the outlines of today's DPjudge started to take shape.  Players in
the active Payola games were given a Webpage that interfaced to the standalone
bribe processing program.  It was a rough fit, but a fit nonetheless.  The
Website grew a Payola player ratings system, started affording the capability
to study the completed games, and so on.  The messages sent to the player
by the bribe processor improved in content and appearance.
At this point, I had a set of Web pages that accepted bribe offers, and which
then used a completely separate program to validate the bribe offers and/or
mail a Ken Lowe judge the appropriate output.  Three truly separate pieces
of software, passing information from the player to the first (the Web pages),
then to the second (the bribe processor), then to the third (the Ken Lowe
judge), and finally back to the player.  Clunky, but it worked.
<P>
Years passed.  Literally.  The Website and the Payola bribe processor code
both matured constantly (but separately), but the thought of integrating the
latter into the former was too daunting to think about.  Mostly because I was
too busy.
<P>
Eventually, both the Payola Web pages and the Payola bribe processor grew
very stable.  So it seemed the perfect time to put all that success in danger.
<P>
And the way to do it was to resurrect Crystal Ball.  I contacted the players
of the long-abandoned first game of CBD, and invited them to finish it by
submitting their orders on Webpages for automatic adjudication (so that no
inconsiderate human GM could possibly abandon them again on some flimsy
excuse).  Having taken a copy of the Payola adjudicator and quickly converted
it to an equally clunky Crystal Ball adjudicator, I was happy that the players
(with some replacements) climbed back into the game.  And I was even
happier that they put up with the growing pains as Crystal Ball went to the Web.
<H3>De-Clunking</H3>
Once Crystal Ball and Payola each had their own separate Websites, both
up and running well, my work on the sites was limited to providing
enhancements that were requested from the players.  It was then that my
attention turned to generalizing from the specific solutions for these
two variants.
<P>
The first thing to be done was to pull the separate pre-processing programs
into the Website code.  Once that was done, the Website communicated
directly with the "hosting" Ken Lowe judge for each game.  I was able to
finally throw away the code that started it all -- the standalone GM helper
"bribe processor" program.
<P>
The next thing to do was to add retreat and adjustment phase support to
the Webpages. Until this time, all retreats and adjustments needed to be
sent directly by the player to the Ken Lowe judge.  New pulldown menus
were added to give players the option to have the Website forward the
retreat and adjustment orders for them.
<P>
During this de-clunking effort, the Payola and Crystal Ball Websites started
sharing code and it became
possible for other variants to be implemented by similarly modifying
the base code.  The decision was made that the next such "variant" to be
supported would be the non-variant.  Standard Diplomacy.
<H3>Meet The Press</H3>
<!--
Here is an e-mail I sent to philby on 2 Aug 1999
Hello!
As we all know, FROG is down, at least for now, which has
left this game waiting for processing of a game phase.
That's the bad news.  Now here's the good news.
I will be hand-adjudicating the game until FROG comes
back.  You will soon receive the results for the "stuck"
phase, and the Website will update itself, you can then
put in your next offer sheet or retreat and adjustment orders
(whatever the case may be), etc., etc.
What about press, you ask?  Well, here's the answer.
Actually, TWO answers.
First off, as you probably noticed, you can now send press
from within the Payola Place Website.  Until this morning,
this was the same as you sending it directly to FROG (the
Website just forwarded it, basically).  I flipped the switch
for this game this morning, so that it delivers the press
to each player itself.  The mail will come to you (like
this one) from dpjudge@diplom.org.
Now for the REALLY good news.  You can also send e-mail TO the
dpjudge@diplom.org account, treating it just like you treated
FROG, SIGNONing to the game, and sending press, just like you do
on the real judge.
For example, to mail me using your e-mail client, you would
send the mail to dpjudge@diplom.org and it would say:
signon Xphilby yourPassword
press to m
Hey, good job, Manus!
Signed,
Power X in "philby"
So now you have the luxury of "r"eplying to mail sent to you via
the dpjudge@diplom.org account.
The full scoop on press via the dpjudge (which I recommend you read,
because there are some slight differences between the dpjudge and
the Ken Lowe judge we all know and love) can be found <!-- as the answer
to the BOTTOM-MOST question -->
in the "DPjudge Questions"
page at the Website.
Oh, one more thing I should mention.  The results will come
to you the same way this message did -- under the subject "Diplomacy
press (philby)".  I could change it to set the subject to "Diplomacy
results philby F1923B" but it's not worth my trouble to do so.
Also, you should know that your account statements for any movement phase
that is processed this way will NOT come to you via e-mail.  You'll have
to just head for the Website to see them.
Anyway, there you have it.  Complaints, criticisms, etc.,
are being entertained.  But unless I hear a good reason
not to continue, the game is about to go on.  FROG (and
sadly, any observers we had, whose e-mail addresses I had
not recorded into the game data on my end) can catch up
with us later.
Manus
-->
The Website was still a front-end that relied on the Ken Lowe judge for
a number of things.  The easiest of these to add to the Website was the
ability for players to compose and send press messages.  The press messages
that players could compose at the Website were still simply forwarded to the
Ken Lowe judge, but events were soon to take a hand.
<P>
At this time, the Ken Lowe judge known as <tt>FROG</tt> went down.  And
it never came back.  Since <tt>FROG</tt> had proven to be the most
resilient judge in my experience, I had used it to host nearly every
one of the games I ran.  The fact was that virtually all of the
Payola and Crystal Ball games came to a sudden stop when <tt>FROG</tt>
went off-line.
<P>
So I quickly taught the Websites to forward press to actual player e-mail
addresses, rather than to the judge, so that the players could continue
communication.
And I resigned myself to either manually adjudicating the results (by simply
telling the Websites that I myself was its "Ken Lowe judge," and manually
processing any e-mail it sent me), or moving the games to another judge.
<P>
The players appreciated the ability to use the Website to compose press,
but the fact was that it was an imperfect solution.  Players could not
really respond to e-mail they received without cutting and pasting the
received text into the Web page.  A far cry from the convenience of just
hitting "reply" in their favorite e-mail client.
<P>
Accordingly, I added an e-mail interface, so that players can send and receive
messages <i>via</i> an e-mail address that is managed by the Website code.
The Ken Lowe <tt>SIGNON</tt>, <tt>PRESS</tt>, and <tt>BROADCAST</tt> commands
were suddenly understood in any e-mail sent to the DPjudge address.  The
die was now cast.
This was when the Websites truly became the DPjudge.
<H3>The Big, Important (Scary) Stuff</H3>
Ever since I entered the online Diplomacy hobby (actually, since well
before then), I had wanted to write a
computerized move adjudicator such as the Ken Lowe judge.  I can't tell you
how many times I started and gave up, frustrated either by seemingly
irresolvable problems or by the obscure nature of the Ken Lowe judge's code (when
I decided to seek help with such a problem).
<P>
When <tt>FROG</tt> went down for the count and I was forced to face
Hand-adjudication of all the games I was running, I finally bit the bullet
hard enough to get through the operation.
<P>
The surprising thing to me was that I didn't really have to bite that hard.
I wrote the move adjudication code in two evenings, and it performed nearly
flawlessly in its first test.  I honestly was flabbergasted.  In the course
of writing the move processor, I came up with a novel approach to resolving
convoy paradoxes.  Elsewhere in this issue of the Zine, Simon Szykman and I
<a href=/Zine/F1999R/Debate/paradox.html>debate the merits of his own pet
paradox-resolution rule and mine</a>.  Once a convoy paradox resolution rule was
chosen, writing the adjudication code became a breeze.  (Okay, that's not
quite true, but anyway, it got done.)
<P>
As I say, this surprised me no end, because within a matter of two
days, the Payola and Crystal Ball Websites went from being front-ends to the
Ken Lowe judge to being part of a system that included a full-fledged
integrated adjudicator.  A system that no longer needed to host its games on a Ken
Lowe judge at all.  (I made sure, though, that the DPjudge still retains all
its Ken Lowe judge integration capabilities, and it is available to provide
a Web face for any game hosted by a Ken Lowe judge.)
<P>
The adjudication piece was in and active so quickly that I never even
Hand-adjudicated a single turn!  Necessity is the mother of invention.
<H3>Working to a Deadline</H3>
The only thing that was missing at this point was deadline setting and
enforcement.  Games run by the DPjudge ran for a month or so without
deadlines, and players played by the honor system.
<P>
After all the little bugs in the adjudication code were worked out,
though, I added deadlines to the DPjudge.  This was actually a major
effort, since the DPjudge code had to be prepared for asynchronous, scheduled
execution to check and remind players about deadlines.
<P>
Additionally, something for which the players had been clamoring since the
earliest days of the Website finally became possible:  the final player
to submit orders actually gained (as with the Ken Lowe judge) the
ability to panic and change what he or she had submitted.  Until deadline
support
was added, the final player to submit orders caused an immediate processing of
the moves.
<H3>Supporting the Normal People Out There</H3>
Once deadline support was provided, the DPjudge was nearly ready for
prime-time.  But it
still knew how to run only Payola and Crystal Ball Diplomacy games.  Most
players (sadly for them) don't (yet) play these variants on a regular basis.
So a quick trip through the Crystal Ball code module resulted in a module that
knew how to run the standard, non-variant game.  Test games proved the new
module, and standard Diplomacy came on-line. By now, nearly a whole handful of
standard games have been run by the DPjudge.
<H3>Incorporating the Mapping</H3>
Since the first days of the Website, players had been treated to
graphical game-maps made by the <tt>mapit</tt> program (which takes Ken Lowe
judge output and creates a PostScript map), long a staple tool of the
PBEM hobbyist.
<P>
The DPjudge's adjudication code was programmed to issue output in the Ken Lowe
judge's format, so that <tt>mapit</tt> could continue (as a standalone, separate
program) to fulfill all map creation needs even when the games were
disconnected from the Lowe judge.
<P>
However, as more and more features kept being added to the DPjudge (see below),
small divergences from the Ken Lowe output format were the outcome.  Either a
specialized version of <tt>mapit</tt> would have to be created, or a
replacement for mapit would need to be written and incorporated into the
DPjudge.
<P>
I chose the latter, and the result was <tt>dpmap</tt>, which is not only
a standalone program (like <tt>mapit</tt>) but is also an integrated module,
part and parcel of the DPjudge package.  The DPjudge now relies on absolutely
no external hobby tools, so I finally felt like the time had come to
announce it.  Here we are.
<P>
Well, there's a nutshell history (okay, it's a big nut) of the DPjudge.
And with that, let's (finally) take a look at some of its new and
different features -- what you can find at the DPjudge....
<H3>Ten Selected Features of the DPjudge</H3>
<!-- <table width=100%><tr><td> -->
<dl>
<a name=orders>
<p><dt><b>Bulletproof Order Validation</b>
<dd>One thing that had bothered me about the Ken Lowe judges was that
some impossible orders (such as convoying an army to Switzerland)
are not considered erroneous, but others
(such as supporting an army into a water space) <i>are</i>
caught and forbidden.  This inconsistency had as its result the growth of
an arcane set of knowledge --
<a href=/Zine/W1995A/Szykman/NoPress.html>a "language" used by no-press
game players</a>
to communicate future intentions and alliance requests through their
moves.  No-press players have taken what they can and cannot
get past the Ken Lowe judge and made it into an interesting
subculture, but the fact that the rules of communication they follow are
based more on the accident of an incomplete implementation than on any
intentional design has always bothered me.  I had
always dreamed of the "all or nothing" validation that the DPjudge
now provides.  Either an order is valid
or it's not, and there is no
inbetween.  At the DPjudge, nothing falls through the cracks.  Unless
a specific "rule" is used on a per-game basis (see below), every order is
<i>guaranteed</i> to be a valid order at the time it is submitted by
a player.
<p><dt><b>True No-Press</b>
<dd>Making the order validation
bulletproof (such that <i>no</i> invalid orders are acceptable) was
actually one of the first features of the original Payola bribe processor --
because complete bulletproofing is a necessary feature of the Payola
variant.  For the longest time, the "all or nothing" wish discussed
above sat at half-finished (the "all" was done, but no work had been done
on the "nothing"), with every order always being rigorously checked.
With every invalid order always caught, this meant that no-press games
became truly no-press.  Players could no longer issue convoys to
Switzerland to hint at their intentions to their allies and enemies.
This is both a good and a bad thing.  True, no communication, no-press
is something
that has not been available to the PBEM player, so it's good to be able
to have it.  The bad part is that no-press PBEM players have grown to
expect to be able to use spurious orders to communicate, and with all
orders strictly validated at entry-time, this was not possible.  So...
<p><dt><b>Face-to-Face Order Writing</b>
<dd>
In addition to the inability to write off-kilter orders to signal
intentions in a no-press game, the fact that all orders are completely
validated also means that there was no possibility of human error
in order entry (either accidental or otherwise).  Every face-to-face
player knows that human error (misordering a unit at a crucial moment, or
forgetting to write down a vital order) is often a big part of the game.
In fact, I have used the intentional misorder tactic myself at the 1998
World Championships. (Hi, Scott!  Yes, I know, "Eastern Med to Smyrna, not
to Constantinople!" Woops!)  The play-by-email player has never had any
such capability.  Not until the DPjudge.
<P>Prompted by the wish to follow the conventions of
face-to-face play when running certain games for the 1999
E-Mail "Masters' Tournament," the DPjudge was taught the "nothing" half
of the "all or nothing" edict.  It is now possible for the DPjudge to
run standard Diplomacy games that accept pure garbage orders (as long as
they are sensible Diplomacy orders, syntactically), and report them as
invalid only in the adjudicated results.
<P>Not only does this allow
for the dynamics of a face-to-face game, but no-press games can be run
at the DPjudge using this rule. Instead of checking every order for
validity when it is entered, no checking is done until adjudication time,
and the result is that the play-by-email no-press player finally has
the ability to use <i>any</i> invalid order (and any number of them)
to signal his intentions.
<P>
The DPjudge retains (and probably always will retain) the mandate that players
must list all fleets to be used in a convoy in the army's convoy order.
This feature of the Ken Lowe judge just solves too many programmatic
problems to be easily removed.  Frankly, my opinion (as expressed
<a href=/Zine/F1999R/Calhamer/convoy.html>elsewhere in this issue</a>) is that
convoy path specification is also the logically "proper" way to write
an army's convoy order.  It avoids the unwanted ("kidnap") convoy and
all of the (to my mind) inconsistencies that arise from the possibility of
an army being able to follow any one of many possible convoy routes.
<p><dt><b>Vacation Handling</b>
<dd>Perhaps the biggest headache that Ken Lowe judge players face is
accidental abandonment.  A player who suffers a network outage or who
forgets to request a deadline extension for an absence often finds
himself declared abandoned.  His position is taken over, and then he
requests his spot back.  My biggest shortcoming as a Ken Lowe judge
GM, in fact, is forgetting to extend deadlines when requested.  The
result is that a player ends up abandoning, is replaced, and then returns
from his absence to ask for his position back.  All my fault, but
caused by the Ken Lowe judge taking action to boot a player from the
game after a period of inactivity.  The DPjudge doesn't do that.
The only way out of a game is to <tt>RESIGN</tt> or be <tt>RESIGN</tt>ed
by the GameMaster.  Player abandonment is one place where, in my opinion,
the human touch is indispensible.
<P>
Deadline management, as implemented by the DPjudge, is much easier,
though, and as a GM at the DPjudge, I no longer miss deadline extension
requests.  This is because the DPjudge supports what could be called
post-dated deadline extensions.  The most common deadline extension
request that a GameMaster receives is of the form, "I will be gone three
weeks from now for a week and a half.  Please don't let any deadlines
fall on those days.  Until then, though, I'm still here and playing;
let's keep the deadlines moving as they are."
Using the Ken Lowe judge, the GameMaster has to remember, three
weeks from now, to enter an extension.  As I recounted above, I often
did not remember to do so.  The DPjudge, on the other hand, has
the ability to "remember" for me.  The GM can tell the game at any time
of any future planned absences, and it will be sure to set deadlines
around them all.
<P>
<i>Note:  At some point after this article was published, the Ken Lowe
judges started supporting the <tt>SET ABSENCE</tt> command, duplicating
this DPjudge innovation.</i>
<p><dt><b>All Games Anonymous</b>
<dd>
When I first entered the hobby, I felt sorry for anyone who played
anonymously.  What fun was that?  Before too long, though, I was
sold on the concept.  In fact, I am now so sold on it that the DPjudge
has been told <i>never</i> to reveal player identities during a game.
There is no way to get it to do so.
(Player identities are, of course, revealed after the completion of a
game.)
<P>
I have had too many bad experiences with players deciding to either
befriend or attack a power based on his or her record or reputation.
Since my name is widely known in the hobby (that's about as humbly as
I can put it -- who, me? humble?), I am perhaps more attuned to this
than others might be, but the fact is that this point of view is not based only
on my own experiences as a "marked man." In fact, the true motivation for
this DPjudge philosophy came when I saw two players in one of the
games I was running
targeted immediately and not really given a chance to participate in
the game, simply because they were good or well-known players.
<P>
(Non-anonymous games are obviously possible simply by announcing
one's own identity, and this is usually acceptable in games for a select
invited audience.)
<!--
DPjudge game players are free to make any claim
about their identity.)
-->
<p><dt><b>New Draw Mechanisms</b>
<dd>The DPjudge provides three different methods in which a game could be
ended in a draw.  By default, each player has a permanent silent "vote"
on record, which he may set either to
<ul><li>"I expect to win the game and
won't accept anything less"<li>"I will accept a draw that includes
all players currently in the game, especially me" or
<li>"I will concede this game to any one of the other players."
</ul>
In this scheme, the game may either end in a solo victory, or by a
concession to a <i>single</i> player (if all other players vote to
concede and the victorious player votes otherwise) or in a draw that
includes all survivors (DIAS).
<P>
The second possibility is if a game is set up to allow NoDIAS draws
(draws that can be shared by a subset of the surviving powers).  Personally,
I'm not a fan of NoDIAS, but I bowed to the possibility that sometimes
they are expedient.  Certainly in face-to-face tournaments, they can save
a lot of time if foregone conclusions can be acknowledged.  As an aside,
though, I argue that conclusions should never be considered foregone,
and simply the fact that NoDIAS is a possible conclusion can actually
affect the play of each player in a way detrimental to the game.  Despite
this personal philosophy, NoDIAS is supported at the DPjudge.  It works
just like the scheme described above except that instead of three voting
choices ("a solo for me," "a DIAS draw," "a concession to someone else"),
each player can also specify the maximum number of players he will accept
(including himself) in any declared draw.  If enough other players ever
are found to be voting to concede to any other power or coalition, the
draw will be declared.
<P>
In both these schemes, each player's "vote" is private and never revealed
to the other players.  The "vote" is perpetually "in effect" and can
be changed at any time.
<P>
The third scheme of declaring draws is meant to mimic the face-to-face
game.  Under this scheme, a player actually publically <i>proposes</i>
a draw or a concession, and the players secretly vote either "yes" or
"no" on the proposal.  As soon as the proposal is vetoed, it is taken
off the table, but if all players agree to it, it passes and the game
ends.  Under this scheme, <i>only</i> DIAS draws and single-player
concessions are supported.  This method is intended to best implement the
Calhamer rules on game termination.
<p><dt><b>Multiple Game Maps</b>
<dd>The DPjudge supports a great many game maps, from the standard map (of
course) to those for the Modern, Pure, Classical, Hundred, and Sail Ho!
variants.
Minor variants of the standard map, such as Crowded and Britain and
1898 are also supported, of course.
<P>
Adding support for any new map variant to the DPjudge is
relatively simple once a graphic map that is attractive enough and that
is in proper
PostScript template form for display on the Web pages has been created.
<P>
Juho Snellman was the first to really answer my call to take
the work I had done to prepare a few maps (standard, modern, etc.) for
the DPjudge and do the same for others.  His maps for Classical
and Hundred and Pure and Sail Ho! are works of art, and at the time of
this writing he is busy preparing more for the collection.
<p><dt><b>Easily Customizable for Addition of New Variants</b>
<dd>
Because of the way the DPjudge matured from a modular and object oriented
design, and since it was actually built initially to provide support for
a couple of very non-standard variants, the fact is that it is a fairly
simple task to add support for other non-standard rule variants.  I'm not just
saying so myself.  Juho Snellman (who I mentioned above) is working on
adding support for the <a href=/Zine/S1996M/Shoham/ICFOS.html>"It Came
From Outer Space"</a> variant.  Here is
what he had to say just a few hours after receiving the DPjudge code:
<blockquote><i>
By the way, I really need to compliment you on the dpjudge design.
I've already made a small toy-variant by modifying a copy of your
standard variant code module and it was truly much easier and (especially)
cleaner than I expected based on the adjudicators I've seen earlier.
</i></blockquote>
Some concepts for non-standard play (such as having new and different
phases -- in addition to movement, retreat, and adjustment -- and having
any number of movement phases per game-year, etc.) are already supported
in the base code.
<p><dt><b>Ken Lowe and Ken Lowe-esque E-Mail Commands</b>
<dd>
As was mentioned earlier, the DPjudge was modeled in many of its
particulars after the Ken Lowe judge.  Importantly, the format of
the results mailings is in line with the Ken Lowe judge, so as to
allow processing by the many hobby tools that have grown up over
the years.
<P>
Equally important was the wish to make the format of the commands
that players send <i>to</i> the DPjudge as consistent as possible
with the commands that the players have grown accustomed to using.
For this reason, the DPjudge player will find himself using a number
of familiar commands, including <tt>PRESS</tt>, <tt>SIGNON</tt> and
<tt>SIGNOFF</tt>, <tt>LIST</tt>, <tt>SET PASSWORD</tt> and
<tt>SET ADDRESS</tt>.
<P>
A couple of the commands were changed, though.  For example, the
command <tt>JOIN</tt> (rather than <tt>SIGNON</tt>) is used to enter
a forming game, and similarly <tt>TAKEOVER</tt> takes the place of
Ken Lowe's <tt>SIGNON</tt> when it comes to replacing an abandoned
player position.
<P>
There are also a couple of new commands, notably <tt>PREVIEW</tt>,
which allows a Game's Master to "pre-process" a phase.  This will
send the Master (only) a sneak peek at the results of adjudicating
the orders as currently entered, but will not actually advance
the game to the next phase.  This command was suggested by Dave
Partridge, who has served as a very patient and helpful guinea pig through
the testing of the face-to-face written order emulation support (that
is, the "don't report erroneous orders until adjudication" feature).
<p><dt><b>Multiple Press and Rule Variants</b>
<dd>
The DPjudge supports, as options, a great many minor rule and press
variants, including the following:
<ul>
<li>David Norman's <a href=/Zine/S1998R/Norman/VarLength.html>Variable
Length</a> game rules.
<li>Chaos and Aberration variant-style build rules.  (Build in any center
and build in any center if and only if a home center is owned.)
<li>All the usual press settings (white, no-partial, grey, and fake).
<li>True black press (sending a message and having it claim to have
been sent from another power).
<li>Face-to-Face press restriction (no communication after deadline or
during retreat and adjustment phases).
<li><a href=/Zine/S1995R/Szykman/Backseat.html>Backseat Driver</a> and
<a href=/Zine/W1995A/Schwarz/Touch.html>Touch</a> variant press rules.
<li>A GameMaster can make any normal observer "omniscient" -- able to see
(but not affect) all player
orders and to receive all partial press messages.  This is an
excellent learning mechanism; far better than observing a game on
the Ken Lowe judge.
<li>Pre-deadline reminders.  Any player who has not submitted orders
eight hours prior to a deadline is gently reminded of the approaching
deadline.  This timespan is modifiable by the GameMaster.
<li>Real time games without problems.  The Ken Lowe judge does not
work well with deadline periods shorter than 24 hours.  The DPjudge
has no problem with short deadlines, so that things like
ten-minute-per-move games are easily accommodated.
<li>So many more features to list, but I said I'd stop at ten (and even so,
I cheated by using this last one as something of a catch-all), so I'll
just refer you again to the
<a href=/dpjudge>actual
DPjudge</a> and its documentation pages.
</ul>
</dl>
<H3>Taking It From Here</H3>
Well, I've spent a lot of your time telling you what the DPjudge has.  Now
it's time to tell you what it doesn't yet have.  Here's just a few of the
items on the laundry list:
<ul>
<li><i><font color=red>(The following item was completed and implemented after
initial publication of this article.)</font></i>
<!--
A couple more functional features of the Ken Lowe judge will be supported.
-->
The most important of the features yet-to-be-added
is the ability to obtain a list of
all games active on the DPjudge <i>via</i> e-mail.  The reason this is
so important is that once this feature is implemented, the DPjudge will
appear on the <a href=/openings/openings.html#USDP>Openings List</a> alongside the Ken Lowe
judges where players every day find positions to fill.
<P>
<li><i><font color=red>(The following item was completed and implemented after
initial publication of this article.)</font></i>
Another important
e-mail command that is yet to be implemented is <tt>SUMMARY</tt>.  At the
very least, a shortened version of a game summary will need to be
available by request, if for no other reason than to support efforts to
provide player ratings.
<P>
<li><i><font color=red>(The following item, world conquest, was begun, with
the addition of another DPjudge, UKDP, in September, 2001.)</font></i>
Right now, there is one DPjudge.  This will change so that (like the
Ken Lowe judge) multiple installations of the DPjudge will be running
on various computers all over the world.  The code is ready to be installed
on any CGI and Web-enabled computer that has a Python language interpreter.
Tests are currently underway to ensure that even a lowly PC can be a
DPjudge.  Before any but the first DPjudge becomes usable, though, a
single player database that will be shared by all the different DPjudges,
will be implemented.
<P>
<li><i><font color=red>(The following item was completed and implemented after
initial publication of this article.)</font></i>
Yes, a player database.  It will be called the "dppd", will be created
and hosted here at The Pouch (possibly using the existing or a modified
version
of <a href=/Registry>the Diplomatic Pouch Hobby Registry</a>.  As it
stands (unlike the Ken Lowe judge), the DPjudge does not require a
player to <tt>REGISTER</tt> with it before using it.  Eventually, though,
it will do so, mainly to help maintain player ratings.  The player
database (including the ratings for all DPjudge games played) will live
here at The Pouch as a completely separate entity from the DPjudge.
All the different DPjudge installations will consult and update it, so
that registration with a single player database will register a player
to use any of the different DPjudges (by contrast, each Ken Lowe judge
maintains its own separate player database).
<P>
<li>Another separate tool to be added to the DPjudge suite will allow a
variant designer to easily create a map for his variant that will be
ready-made for the DPjudge.  This is a project that is still on the
drawing board, but there are some nice drawings on the board.
<P>
<li>Everything else, both known and unknown.  The
DPjudge is full of features that were suggested by player and variant
creators, and these requests
will by no means abate.  I've already mentioned the ongoing effort to add
support for "It Comes From Outer Space," and there are many other
enhancements either pending or planned.  To list only one such enhancement,
the DPjudge will someday support the Blind variant (don't hold your
breath, but it's on the list). <i><font color=red>(Those who ignored
my advice and held their breath were able to stop holding it in September,
2001, when the DPjudge indeed became the first-ever automated adjudicator
to support the Blind variant.  You're welcome.)</font></i>
</ul>
<P>In discussing the "feature creep" that has built the DPjudge, it
seems that I have finally found a place to work in a very necessary and
overdue nod to Bruce Duewer and to "Tarzan," the two most ardent suggesters
of DPjudge enhancements.  Both of these players come at the DPjudge as
variant creators, and their wishes to have the DPjudge support their
new variant concepts truly drive the evolution of the DPjudge.
Answering their requests (or heeding their reminders about brilliant feature
ideas of my own that I had bounced off them) also guarantees that my focus
as the creator of the DPjudge
is never far from the modular design that allows all these "weird bits"
to fit in nicely and cleanly without introducing spaghetti.  As a matter
of fact, so much of the impetus for moving this project to its current
state from just a standalone Payola bribe adjudicator and the separate
Web pages that fed it belongs to Bruce (for pressing me to support his
<a href=/Zine/W1998A/Duewer/Exchange.html>Exchange variant</a> of Payola)
and "Tarzan" (for spurring the first true move towards "judgehood" -- the
addition of press to the DPjudge).
To both Bruce and "Tarzan," thanks, and don't worry; the
things you've asked for will get done.
<!/ul>
<H3>And That, My Friends, Is The DPjudge</H3>
Thanks for taking the time to read about the DPjudge.  I hope you weren't
too bored.  I'll end this article with an invitation and an appeal:
<ul>
<li>First,
the invitation:  feel free and encouraged to
<a href=/dpjudge>head for the DPjudge</a>
and take a look at what it can do.
<li>As for the appeal, be gentle with my baby.
Although the DPjudge will happily <tt>CREATE</tt> games for you (the
documentation pages can tell you how to do so if you are actually
inclined), please do me the favor of e-mailing me personally
for permission <i>before</i> you <tt>CREATE</tt> a game.  I just want to keep
an eye on things for a while yet.  It's a big world out there, and I need to
see how well the DPjudge responds as it is given a greater load of games.
<i><font color=red>(Years have passed since the publication of this article.
Not only has the DPjudge continued to grow by leaps and bounds -- indeed,
the list of ten important features are not even close to the ten I might
choose today -- but it has been proven resilient as all heck.  There is
no need to be gentle with it, or to ask me for permission to do anything
there.  Enjoy it!)</font></i>
