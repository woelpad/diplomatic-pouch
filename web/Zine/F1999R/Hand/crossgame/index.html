I am sorry your are having this experience, I am lucky because my name is
not that well known. Nathan Detroit is a very well known player, I am
surprised that others in your game don't know that [I don't know him but my
teamates do, they say he is very nasty]. Who else is in your game? As for
you being Kasparov, well we both know that you are much better than him! <g>

 I absolutely agree that the games should be gunboat and we should use a
judge, this format sucks!!  I also think we have lots of gullible rookies
involved ie. The Russia in my game missed his moves Fall 1901 changing the
whole dynamics of the game as Austria I had to throw out all agreed upon
alliance and start over because now Italy and Turkey see a huge opportunity
to work together
Later
