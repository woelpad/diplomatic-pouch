Hi Manus,
   Yes the newbie guide is posted. Simon actually had to do a bit of work to
get it up since the program I used didn't format things right. Thanks for
changing all my addresses to btamil@excite.com. I will indeed order some
'Pouch apparel when I get the chance. Speaking of chances, I'm wracking my
brain for fodder for another article. I'll let you know when I get a good
idea.
Best Wishes,
Tim Miller

Fellow Diplomats,
I have what I think is some terrific news for the Hobby.
As many of you know I have been the custodian of the Hoosier 
Archives of Diplomacy Zines.
This collection, created by Walt Buchanan, contains virtually every 
Diplomacy zine published in North America from the beginnings of 
the Hobby to 1978.  When I accepted custody of the collection, it 
was with the understanding that I would preserve it and make it 
available to Hobbyists and researchers.  My ultimate goal was to 
find a permanent home for it in an academic library/archive.
I am please to announce that today I filled up my van with 33 cases 
and delivered the Hoosier Archives to the Popular Culture Library of 
Bowling Green State University here in Ohio.  They already have a 
small collection of fanzines (SF, music, etc., even some 
Diplomacy World) and are delighted to add these to their collection.
Alison Scott, the Head Librarian, will be inventorying these items 
over the next several months, and then will begin the process of 
cataloging.  The remainder of the Hoosier Archives collection 
(consisting of correspondence, Diplomacy World subscription 
records and camera ready copy) along with the more recent 
acquisition of the Hobby Award plaques will be part of an archival 
special collection.
All of these items will be available at the Popular Culture Library for 
Hobbyists and/or researchers to access.  I believe that this is the 
best solution for the archives.  I always considered the archives to 
only be in my care temporarily.  Now they have a permanent home. 
 I have been in communication with Walt Buchanan about this and 
he gives his blessings as well.  And now they are out of my 
basement (just in time, since I may be moving again soon).
This now brings up two more important issues.  First, does she 
want more?  You bet.  When I took on the HA, I received queries 
from several people asking if I wanted more.  I said no!  No room!
When I asked the Head Librarian she said, "yes, please!"  So, 
those of you who have large zine collections and are loathe to toss 
them, here's your chance.  As I said, they collect Diplomacy and 
just about any other type of fanzine.  However, before you send her 
anything, please contact her directly and let her know what you 
have.  Here is her contact information:
Alison M. Scott
Head Librarian
Popular Culture Library
Bowling Green State University
Bowling Green, Ohio  43403
419-372-2450
mailto:alisonms@yahoo.com
Keep in mind of course, that if you are going to donate your zines 
to the library, it is up to you to get them there.  They do not have 
any funds available to purchase your zines or pay for shipping.  
Which brings us to the second point:  No gift to a library is truly 
free.  They will have many costs associated with the processing of 
the collection.  Besides the staff time involved, they will need to 
purchase archival quality storage materials that will preserve the 
archives (folders, boxes, etc.).  If you or other members of the 
Hobby would like to make donations to the library for the Hoosier 
Archives, they will be gratefully accepted.
Make your checks payable to:  "Popular Culture Library"
Mail them directly to Alison Scott at the address above, with a 
notation that you wish this gift directed to the Hoosier Archives.
As part of the collection, I also recieved two cases of back issues 
of Diplomacy World from the 1970's.  These are muliple copies that 
were never sold when Walt was publishing DW.  With Walt's 
permission I am going to sell these back issues as a fund raiser for 
the library.  Watch for more information soon.
Please pass this information on throughout the Hobby.  Print it in 
your zines, post it on the Diplomacy newsgroup and in the 
Diplomatic Pouch, etc.  If anyone has any questions, feel free to 
contact me.
Jamie McQuinn
Former Custodian of the Hoosier Archives

Jamie,
I'm delighted at this news.  It is good to know the HA now has a permanent
home, and I want to thank you for your efforts.  It will be interesting to
see if this ever generates a Ph.D dissertation on a postal community.
Actually, I was approached about that years ago, but I don't think anything
came of it.
Of course you have my blessing to sell the back issues of DW as a fund
raiser for the library.  I would also to happy to work with Alison if she
has any questions about the collection in the future.  BTW, note my new
email address.
Best regards,
Walt

Jamie, I too want to add my voice of thanks, as well as a hope that 
somehow the material that Larry Peery wants to pass on is combined with
it.  Larry has a whole lot of material from the early 1980's that I'm
not sure is exhaustively covered in the Hoosier Archives.
And, to Walt, you should join us for one of our Face-to-Face Diplomacy
get-togethers in the Boston area.  We just had one last week, but I'll
let you know when the next one is.  I'd like to meet you.  I'm a 
Professor too, in the School of Public Health at Boston U.
The best of the academic studies of Diplomacy have still been pretty
weak (I've seen about five, mostly Master's theses) and also hope that
someone attempts that soon.
