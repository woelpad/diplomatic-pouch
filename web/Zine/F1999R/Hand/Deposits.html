<H3>Our Favorite Borders</H3>
I was gratified to receive a virtual flood of e-mail in response to my
question, "What is your favorite border?"  Overwhelmed, in fact.  I've
never before had such voluminous response to any of my suggested topics for
discussion!  Thanks to all of you who mailed me your answer, and you'll
all find my own answer revealed in my responses to the incoming mail.
There seemed to be something of a trend.  People (myself included) seem
to have a liking for moves that suddenly transfer pressure from one theatre
to another.  In fact, in thinking about the responses, I have come up with
an idea for an article (how like me, huh?) -- a discussion of the different
traditional DMZ's, where they overlap, and moves into one DMZ from a location
inside another. Anyone want to write it for me?

I've been playing e-mail Diplomacy for a few months now after playing at
university for a few years.
The change from FTF dip to e-mail is quite shocking.
But to answer your question.....
My favorite border crossing?
Well I enjoy playing Russia and often find myself penned into a southern
battle with Turkey and/or Austria.
As such I especially enjoy "breaking out." This comes most easily moving from
StP-Nwy.
It semms somehow to "free me" and increase my sphere of influence from
south-eastern
Europe to the whole of North Europe in one single move.
I immediately have increased relevance to England, France and Germany then
previously.
<H4>
From Brandon Clarke
(<a href=mailto:bjc@stevensons.co.nz>bjc@stevensons.co.nz</a>):
</H4>
Unquestionably my favourite border to cross is the StP - Fin - Nwy
border. I <i>love</i> seeing my units cross that border when I'm
playing Turkey, Austria or Italy.
<P>
Having said that, everytime I play Turkey (and to a lesser extent, Italy
and Austria) I aim to get a fleet into the Barents and an army into
Clyde. I think the crowning glory of my Diplomacy career will be a game
where I'm Turkey, and I finish participating in a draw with a fleet BAR
and army Cly, preferably owning say Budapest and Munich.
<P>
<i>That</i> would be grand!

From Ian Cooper
(<a href=mailto:20c@sprintmail.com>20c@sprintmail.com</a>):
</H4>
I dunno about a favourite border, but I do tend to begin to really enjoy
the game whenever anyone goes into Galicia.  There's just something
about that province that, once it's taken (especially late in the game),
makes the game more exciting in every game I've played.  I don't know
what it is.
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's response: Bingo!</b></i></blockquote>
<P>
As for <u>national</u> borders; well, for me it'd have to be the French/Italian
border - sparks tend to fly when someone crosses that one.
<H4>
From David Hertzman
(<a href=mailto:knave@idirect.com>knave@idirect.com</a>):
</H4>
Well, obviously crossing into Marseilles from Piedmont is the nice
biggee that tells you that you are on your way to a sweet solo victory.
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's response:</b>
Not a bad choice....
</i></blockquote>
That said, my favourite move is the Galicia-Bohemia slide when I am
Russia and planning on attacking Germany.
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's response:</b>
You're very close to my choice, which is the Galicia-Silesia
border.  Any move from Gal to Sil or vice-versa is just such a big momentum
shifter, and it seems like it's so rarely expected.
</i></blockquote>
It is <i>so</i> easy to claim that you are going after Austria....
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's response:</b>
I guess we have the same take.  The whole Pru-Sil-Boh-Gal area is so
often DMZ'ed between a number of powers; usually, it's two <i>separate</i>
DMZ's, and no one thinks that you'd enter the one simply because you
<i>really</i> want to go to the other.
</i></blockquote>
<P>
I also get little squirms
around Prussia since that usually signals a big change in game policy,
but I am very biased towards the Russia-Germany dynamic for some reason,
I think it is the most interesting on the board.  They absolutely must
remain friends at the beginning, but each benefits somewhat from the
other's downfall.
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's response:</b>
Indeed so.  And Russia can so easily be in Gal "to finish Austria" and then
quickly move to Sil to put Germany in <u>huge</u> trouble.  (Germany has a harder
time doing the reverse, but Boh-Gal, as you pointed out, is similar -- sudden
unexpected pressure on War, Rum, and Ukr-Sev/Mos).
</i></blockquote>
<i><B>Response from David:</b></i>
Hmm, now that you mention it, the Gal-Sil is a biggee, Boh-Gal is the
preparation, but the Gal-Sil is the shift from the attack on Austria to the
direct assault on the German home supply centres.
<P>
We do indeed have the same take, though. Boh/Sil/Pru is often an "automatic"
DMZ, and as such it is always exciting when it is broken.  In fact, I always
make a point of trying to be the first into that zone if I am nearby, since
you can pick up a very nice tactical advantage if your attack is unexpected.
<P>
Sil-Gal would not be as exciting though... why is Germany in Sil to begin
with?  Very anti-Russian, so why would he be doing that unless Russia was
dead or some treaty was made?  Hmm... I'm beginning to clue into something
here.  Galicia is pretty much an Eastern province, while Sil is a Western
province... crossing means that you are changing theatres of operation...
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's response:</b>
Actually, I prefer Sil-Gal to Gal-Sil.  One of my favorite things to see
(much like Brandon's wish to occupy Barents and Clyde) is a German army that
runs straight for Rumania via Mun-Sil-Gal-Rum.

I agree with you that Silesia to Galicia is cute

are about to begin with a different digit, Larry would
like to know which real-life diplomats would be considered (by us armchair
Diplomats)
the ten greatest of the "millennium" (yes, I know the millennium
won't end until 31 December 2000, but "the ten greatest diplomats of the
years beginning with '1'" just doesn't have the same ring).

In a couple of months the book "Calhamer on

from <a href=http://www.1stbooks.com/>1stbooks.com</a>.
It proceeds topically, discussing aspects of the Game of
Diplomacy and parallel events drawn from diplomatic history.  My hope is that
the Game will make the history more interesting, and the history will make the
Game more interesting.          This is not a how-to manual, although it may
contain some strategic tips.  It may be illuminating and occasionally
controversial in its analysis of the history.

Whether Diplomacy is Worth an Emotional Toll</a>

From Brandon Clarke

</H4>
Hi, I've been asked this question myself, and I agree with Manus:  the answer
is,
"Definitely."
<P>
Through Diplomacy you learn more about yourself, and how you interact
with others. In addition, you make fantastic friends. Some of us even
meet interesting women.
<P>
If you feel you're paying a price for it emotionally, I say keep
playing. I pay an emotional price for playing Diplomacy when I lose,
but it's a small price. However, when I win the payoff I get is
enormous. Learning to win sometimes takes time, but once you get enough
experience under your belt, and develop your game you learn that, as
disappointing as the setbacks are, they are <i>far</i> outweighed by the
rewards of playing.
<H4>
From Jos&eacute; Torres
(<a href=mailto:r28738@email.sps.mot.com>r28738@email.sps.mot.com</a>):
</H4>
Shortly after sending in my question, I realized that I knew
the answer all along and that it agreed with your position - I
was merely fishing for validation.  So I registered on USIN and
USEF and began observing in several games.  When one of them
needed a replacement player (that never happens!) I eventually
took the bait and signed on.  After getting my feet wet, writing
a few press messages, and (!) convincing my country's nemesis
(based on history) to switch and ally with me, I figured I was
on to something.  I have since joined two games for Newbies (one
by accident.  Honest!  I don't know how I got signed up for the
second one! <img src=/Zine/Common/smiley.gif>, one foreign language game, and one
Bliztkrieg 15Hr per phase mad dash.  Yes.  I am currently in
five games, and I have only been late twice.
<P>
Foremostly, I am writing to say how amazed I am at how much I
have learned about myself and human nature.  I am embarrassed at
how 'wimpy' my initial comment seems to me today.  Geez, if a
player took that tone in their first press in a game, they would
be waving a big flag that said "Please, take advantage of me,
stab me first or second!  Pretty please!"  I must laugh at how
enthused I would be today to get a message with that tone from
one of my neighbors.  (Drooling!)
<P>
I have not yet finished a game (1905 is the latest I've gotten,
simply because there is a lot of waiting...) but I no longer
consider myself a 'hapless newbie.'  I sniffed out a Key Lepanto
and split the Austro-Italian alliance with press.  I was the
decision maker in another and convinced my fellow dippers to
concentrate on targets of my choice (causing wo eliminations,
soon to be three).  As the replacement player I convinced my
country's previous nemesis to cooperate against the local bully
to gain my first SC (one I'll remember with pride) and then
eventually stab that old nemesis down to 1 oneC (the best I could
do in one turn).
<P>
Dan Shoham or Jamie Dreier I am not.  But I feel like I can do a
decent job of dipping my fellows to roughly do what I want a
reasonable amount of time.  Where did I learn it?
WWW.Diplomacy-R-Us.com!  Of course it was The Pouch.  I'm not
trying to flatter you, but you've worked hard to help the Dip
community with The Pouch and I must say you've made the world a
better place (for dippers).
<P>
Particularly, I learned a great deal from the following
articles:
<ul>
<li>Paul Windsor - <a href=/Zine/S1999M/Windsor/point.html>What's Your Point?</a>
<li>Paul Windsor - <a href=/Zine/F1997R/Windsor/lawdip.html>Lawyer/Diplomat</a>
<li>Dan Shoham - <a href=/Zine/S1995M/Shoham/Academy.html>Carebear & Cutthroat</a>
<li>Matthew Self - <a href=/Zine/W1995A/Tactics>Library of Tactics</a>
<li>Manus Hand's <a href=/Online/Openings>Library of Opening Moves</a>
<li>Doug Massey - <a href=/Zine/W1996A/Massey/annotate.html>Annotated No Press Game</a>
</ul>
<P>
By the way, I was disappointed to read about Paul's wife.  My wife and
child mean everything to me (well, after Diplomacy!) and the
Windsors are in my prayers.
<P>
The first three articles really go for the heart of the reason to play
Diplomacy - learning about onesself and human nature.  (If you
can't tell, I am a fellow who reads the entire owner's manual
before even plugging in a television set, and I have read at least half
of all of the articles that are not on variants, and only half because I
do have a wife and kid.)
<P>
I see an excellent potential article for Newbies to
be entitled "Advice on writing your first press."  After joining
my first two games, I took an hour to write my first messages
because I was so inexperienced and a bit overwhelmed with the
feeling that I was going to "do it wrong" or "not do it the
right way."  (I did do it 'wrong,' anyway; that's for sure.) I learned so
much from trying to dig my way out of the hole I'd put myself
in.  It may be counter-intuitive from reading such a rambling
e-mail that I've become so much better at edifying a thesis with
supporting facts, but in fact I have improved greatly.  For the
first time in my life I now feel like I have the skills to
persuade someone to do what I think is best.  That is part of
the true value of Diplomacy, as I am sure you agree.
<P>
Gunboat games have given me freedom to adopt personas very
different from my own.  In real life I used to be far too
considerate of other people to my own detriment.  Now, I realize
that everyone is a backstabbing son-of-a-bitch and a carebear
all at once, and perhaps not only socialization but also
position and opportunity which dictated which trait guides a
person.  I have yet to be eliminated in any of my games (all of
my positions are up at least one SC over start/takeover) but I
have no real fear of being beaten.  If you lose this game it is
not too often because you were tactically inferior but beacause
you were unable to pursuade other people to act as you
want/needed them to.  Learn from it and move on.  Or if you find
yourself playing with Dan Shoham, resign immediately!  I
have found that I respect people who take their lumps fighting
gracefully, and I never have any respect for unjustified
resignations (life intruding is justifiable).  If players have a
problem emotionally with having their positions wiped out after
months of work (playing a <i>game</i>) then they need to have their
heads examined.
<P>
Every night, I promise myself I am going to write shorter
press.  All of my games are waiting for a late power, so I
checked the Zine and found the recent issue, and well, here's
the outcome.  I would be happy to create a succinct summary of
this for the next dip pouch issue, but I thought you might
actually be this interested in what I had to say on the subject
because of the dedication level you show for the hobby and the
'zine.  Is your dedication rating default at the machine
overflow value?
<P>
I don't know when one graduates from being a newbie, but I sure
feel like I have already.  It is too bad I can't just play Dip
for a living.

I had to choke back a tear when I read that The Pouch was going to be mentioned in the in-box literature.  I recall all the nervous paranoia during Avalon Hill's takeover by Hasbro on r.g.d. as everyone feared the worst sort of treachory
courtesy of Avalon Hill.  I recall my mind being filled with visions David Kovar being forced to establish guerrilla camps around the globe, keeping the judges running on contraband servers while imperial stormtroopers of the Hasbro empire hunted them down.  I was overcome with happiness that the treachory was kept in the game where it belongs and in real life we all seem to be getting along.  I'm also proud to have been a member of the hobby during this historical moment for The Pouch, as it gains official status continuing a noble tradition started by "The General."

I'm just e-mailing you with a very short evaluation of the new Diplomacy
computer game released by Microprose/Hasbro.  I purchased the game over the
weekend, installed it and proceeded to play a single player game against six
computer opponents.  I was very disappointed in the AI for this game.  I had
no problem defeating the computer opponents in a very short period of time.
I proceeded to play 2 more single player games with the same results.  Three
single player games against 6 computer opponents each game, all on the
highest level of AI/difficulty, with a solo victory for me in each game.
The ease of my victory was pathetic.  The AI for the game was laughable.
I'm taking over supply centers from other players and those computer players
are asking me to make some of their territory neutral zones.  Hello, I'm
taking your country...
<p>
Maybe the multiplayer option has something to offer but the single player
games are worthless.  I plan on trying to bring the game back for a refund
or at least to exchange for a game that gives me a challenge.
<H4>
From Ian Cooper
(<a href=mailto:20c@sprintmail.com>20c@sprintmail.com</a>):
</H4>
Well, I'll start by saying that I'm an old-time Diplomacy player who
fell by the wayside a few years ago, and hasn't played the game since.
Both my wife and I were avid players, until we found that a minority of
Diplomacy players don't seem to like women playing the game.  So, in
order to have a more pleasant life, we left the game even though we were
both often very successful at tournaments.  However, I digress.
<P>
I just picked up the new Diplomacy computer game and played it for the
first time tonight (single player).  Here's a quick review:
<P>
The game looks great.  It seems to play well - no bugs seen yet.
Gameplay is very smooth and the interface is very intuitive.  You can
literally load the game and be playing quite happily straight away
without looking at the manual.  While I haven't yet played a multiplayer
game, the multiplayer interface also seems very good - it's a snap to
set up on the Microsoft Gaming Network, and again, you can be up and
running in minutes.  The only thing I miss (having been spoiled by the
recent 'chrome is all' trend in computer gaming) is more pretty graphics
and sounds - the game could have used a nice intro soundtrack (perhaps a
nice 'History Channel' type introduction to the world as it was in 1900)
and a few more graphical extras.  But for the dedicated Diplomacy player
who just wants a no-nonsense approach, it does the job well, and I think
it will be a great tool for making multiplayer games much easier than
they are at present, and much more accessible for players new to the
game.
<P>
The only real problem I have with the game so far is in single player
mode.  The AI is quite simply atrocious.  The old Avalon Hill computer
Diplomacy had better AI, and gave the player a far better run for
his/her money than does this version.  I played one game as England
against the computer opponent with all the difficulty options turned to
high, and I gained my 18 supply centres fairly easily by 1907.  I had
allied with the German 'player' early on in the game, and I backstabbed
him pretty ruthlessly in 1903 - but at the end of the game, with only
one supply centre left (all the rest had been taken by me), the German
was still happily talking to me.  If this was a human vs. human game,
the guy would have been trying to throttle me, while pleading with his
neighbours to 'fight the common foe'.  The AI doesn't even play well
tactically - missing obvious moves, and seeming not to care whether it's
a Spring or Fall move.  Basically, the single player game will work as
an introduction for the complete neophyte, but for seasoned players,
it's a complete waste.
<P>
However, I don't think anyone really expected a chess-type AI for this
game - what we need is a nice base from which to mount multi-player
games over the internet.  This, the latest version does admirably,
although with little fanfare or chrome.

Is it just me or did Hasbro and Microprose drop the ball on this one?
Granted the graphics are nice and the pre-WWI pictures were a good idea but
the game is just no fun.  For the single player mode the opponents don't
have a strategy that I can discern, they just send you gibberish.  They
suggest that I do anything and everything.  In the end it is meaningless to
converse with the other countries.   It is worthless to ask another country
to support a move or to agree to support another countries move because it
<i>never</i> happens.  Firm alliances are never made and therefore "stabs" never
occur because nobody is ever "friendly" enough to fool, or be fooled. So by
1904 I stopped talking to my opponents all together and I won by 1910 (I was
England).  So I started over as Italy and put all my opponents to the
hardest setting.  Still they sent me gibberish.  I stopped conversing with
them in 1903 and won in 1907.  Keep in mind that I have played maybe three games
of Diplomacy in my whole life so I am not exactly a master player here.  If
a complete novice can sit down, ignore his opponents' press (to me the
whole fun of Diplomacy is talking with one's opponents), and win consistenly
with Italy by 1907 something is very very wrong.

</h3>

From Keith Ammann
(<a href=mailto:geenius@albany.net>geenius@albany.net</a>):
</H4>
OK, it's goofy to be responding to an article written a year ago, but
reading the Pouch isn't always a completely linear experience.
<P>
I'm surprised that there was no mention of the "least squares fit" method
of power assignment.  It's like maximizing satisfaction, but instead of
going for the high score, you go for the low.  To take Tarzan's recurring
example:
<P>
<center>
<table border>
<tr><th>Cornelius   <th><tt>GEFTARI
<tr><th>Cheeta      <th><tt>RTGIEFA
<tr><th>Manus       <th><tt>ETRAFIG
<tr><th>Tarzan      <th><tt>FETRIGA
<tr><th>Simon       <th><tt>EFATGIR
<tr><th>Dave        <th><tt>RTEFAIG
<tr><th>Petar       <th><tt>EFRTIAG
</table></center>
<P>
Ideally, you evaluate all possible combinations of powers and choose the
best one, but that's impractical if you're working by hand, so a good
place to start is with a bottom-up method.  Looking at the lists, nobody
has placed Italy higher than fourth place.  <u>Someone</u> is going to have to
be Italy, so it looks like it'll be Cheeta.  Similarly, no one has placed
Austria higher than third, so Simon gets Austria.  All other powers are
now somebody's first or second choice.  Cornelius, Dave and Tarzan get
Germany, Russia and France uncontested, leaving Manus and Petar to fight
over England.  Turkey is still unclaimed, and it's Manus' second choice
and Petar's fourth, so Manus gets Turkey and Petar gets England.
<P>
So here's the assignment evaluation table:
<p>
<center>
<table border>
<tr><th>Player<th>Power<th>Rank In Player's List<th>Square of Rank
<tr><th>Cornelius  <th>Germany   <th>1st    <th>1
<tr><th>Cheeta     <th>Italy     <th>4th   <th>16
<tr><th>Manus      <th>Turkey    <th>2nd    <th>4
<tr><th>Tarzan     <th>France    <th>1st    <th>1
<tr><th>Simon      <th>Austria   <th>3rd    <th>9
<tr><th>Dave       <th>Russia    <th>1st    <th>1
<tr><th>Petar      <th>England   <th>1st    <th>1
<tr><th colspan=2><th>Avg.: 1.86<th>Sum: 33
</table></center>
<P>
It so happens that this is the outcome generated by Tarzan's "group
satisfaction" method.  Is there a better one?  My guess is that there
isn't.  A swap of a first- and a third-place power for two second-place
powers would knock two points off the sum of squares, for example, but in
this case that opportunity doesn't exist, because no one placed Austria
(the only third-place power) higher than third.  What's interesting is
that in the above table, satisfaction has been optimized not only for the
players <i>but for the powers as well</i>.  That is, every country has been
assigned to a player who ranked it as high or higher than all other
players did.  If you whimsically assume that Turkey is "happiest" being
run by a player who wants to play Turkey, then being played by Cheeta,
Manus or Dave is the best possible outcome for Turkey.  By maximizing the
"happiness" of the powers, you also maximize the satisfaction of the
players!
<P>
The next realm I would like to see explored is the evaluation of grouped
powers.  For example:
A[EFGIR]T
<p>
Austria is clearly the first choice.  But what are [EFGIR]?  Are they
counted as second place?  If so, is Turkey third or seventh?  Or does the
group have a "center of gravity," putting it in fourth place?  (This is
what I generally assume.)
<blockquote><i><b>Author's response:</b>
Thanks for you feedback.  Actually, my article does address exactly
what you presented.  I believe I referred to it as as yielding the
"Least Dissatisfaction" or something like that.  Perhaps, I didn't
score it the same way you did (you refer to least squares)
but I still would consider
what you suggest as a variation of the "Least Dissatisfaction"
method.
<P>
What we really need is someone (like me?) to code all these various
methods into a Judge (yes, Manus, I'll work on it!!).
<img src=/Zine/Common/smiley.gif>
</i></blockquote>
Here's another interesting thought on the topic of power assignment and
satisfaction:  The preference matrix
<P>
<center><table border>
<tr><th>Alice   <th>RAFEIGT
<tr><th>Bob     <th>AIRTGEF
<tr><th>Carol   <th>TIRAGFE
<tr><th>Doug    <th>ETRAFIG
<tr><th>Eddie   <th>GRATFIE
<tr><th>Frank   <th>GERAFIT
<tr><th>George  <th>FRAGTIE
</table></center>
<P>
is equivalent, if you imagine the powers themselves to have "preferences,"
to
<P>
<center><table border>
<tr><th>Austria  <th>BA[EG][CDF]
<tr><th>England  <th>DFAB[CEG]
<tr><th>France   <th>GA[DEF]CB
<tr><th>Germany  <th>[EF]G[BC]AD
<tr><th>Italy    <th>[BC]A[DEFG]
<tr><th>Russia   <th>A[EG][BCDF]
<tr><th>Turkey   <th>CD[BE]G[AF]
</table></center>
<P>
A least squares fit on the first matrix would produce one of the following
assignments:
<P>
<center><table border>
<tr><th><th>Option 1  <th>Option 2
<tr><th>Austria  <th>Bob       <th>Alice
<tr><th>England  <th>Frank     <th>Doug
<tr><th>France   <th>George    <th>George
<tr><th>Germany  <th>Eddie     <th>Frank
<tr><th>Italy    <th>Carol     <th>Bob
<tr><th>Russia   <th>Alice     <th>Eddie
<tr><th>Turkey   <th>Doug      <th>Carol
</table></center>
<P>
(Both options sum to 16, all get 1st or 2nd choice)
Now, when you apply a least squares fit to the second matrix, you get:
<P>
<center><table border>
<tr><th><th>Option 1  <th>Option 2
<tr><th>Alice   <th>Russia    <th>Austria
<tr><th>Bob     <th>Austria   <th>Italy
<tr><th>Carol   <th>Italy     <th>Turkey
<tr><th>Doug    <th>Turkey    <th>England
<tr><th>Eddie   <th>Germany   <th>Russia
<tr><th>Frank   <th>England   <th>Germany
<tr><th>George  <th>France    <th>France
</table></center>
<P>
(Both options sum to 13, all get 1st or 2nd choice)
<P>
Which happens to be exactly equivalent to the assignments done in the other
direction!  Thus, a happy country makes for a happy player.

In your reaction against the scoring system you focused on my game in the third round.  What you reported was not quite
the situation that occurred.  As Italy I swept rather quickly through Austria and into Turkey.  Meanwhile the West was a
tangle of alliances and stabs and what not between France/England and Germany.  David Hood had the highest profile of
having announced that he had won the last five tournaments he played in and having won his prior game as Russia.  This
combined with a slashing set of alliance shifts in the west had earned him few friends.
<P>
As the game progressed I maintained a deal with the French player to dominate our respective East/West portions of the
map.  Time was going on and I had to make a decision as to whether I could win the game within the tournament time
period and I concluded that I could not.  Being of the old school: Win Only or another result, the another result that I
wanted was a 2 way draw as combined with a prior 2 way and 3 draw I had a decent chance of ending up in  top 7
positions of the tournament.  The downside was the voting system.  If the game went on a dead lock at the end then it
would be draws include all survivors and not only would knock my position down in the tournament but would have
elevated Hood's who was not allied with me in the game. The players in the west also wanted to extend their rating in the
tournament and there was the basis of the deal that was negotiated.  The small survivors in the game knew that they would
be eliminated if the game was not ended by a draw vote.  Therefore for them the best bet was to vote to end the game.
Their survival and their score was higher because the game ended early.   In fact as I recall at the end,  even David was
suddenly not sure if he would survive if the game went on.  Therefore, the game was voted an end to the two way draw of
Italy and France...where the remaining survivors all received points based on their supply centers.  I believe that the vote
was unanimous at the end and that even David voted for it, though technically he was not needed as he had only 4 centers.
But it should be noted that David ended up with a higher score for surviving in the game than being eliminated.  The game
was not a bad display of abuse, in fact it was an excellent use of the voting concept in a game to achieve a result that could
not be obtained by board play.  It was a very diplomatic way to end the game.
<P>
Now whether there should be any vote in a scoring system or not is a different issue.
<P>
Also if prior rounds should affect the game in a tournament or not.  These are tournament design issues.
<P>
However, I simply wanted to explain the game you saw and to correct your feeling that there was something very odd
going on, it was just diplomacy.

Thank you for pointing out something that has been bothering me for years.  I have played in the ORIGINS Dip Tourney for several years.  I have the highest praise for the chap who has been running the thing in every single regard except for the execrable system for ending/scoring the game.  It is so frustrating to have been playing very well, dominating the board, on your way to a solo or fairly exclusive draw, and then have time run out and have to go through endless pettyfogging to share the draw with nearly everyone else, no matter how poorly they had played.

From Jack Sinnott
(<a href=mailto:Jack.Sinnott@hboc.com>Jack.Sinnott@hboc.com</a>):

<p>
I read your follow-up articles and the response threads. I think I have
another take on your data. Why not drop the assumption that a respondent's
"France/Turkey Attack Differential" is relevant? If you're trying to measure
map effects, why not measure responses between maps?
<p>
What I'd like to see is the differential across experience and risk profiles
between the <i>maps</i>. Why not plot the map response differentials for each
population as data points? For example, try comparing the responses from
both maps to "...likelihood that Italy is setting up to attack you..." for
"somewhat conservative experts". In the end, you'd get 50 data points for
each map: 25 for each unique population x 2 for the "likelihood" questions.
You could graph it in two dimensions (y= {experience, risk}, x=likelihood) or
in 3 dimensions (x=experience, y=risk, z=likelihood) depending on how you
want to slice the results.
<p>
With 100 separate data points, some interesting comparisions could be made.
How do aggregate responses between maps to one question contrast with
aggregate responses to it's mirror question? Does the sum of those aggregate
comparisons equal zero? Can you spot trends by altering your choice of which
variable to plot as x/y/z (assuming each variable is plot independent?) In
addition, you could easily make comparisons that adjust for map bias, such
as comparing the aggregate of "Map A Likely + Map B Unlikely" vs. "Map A
Unlikely + Map B Likely"
<p>
In addition, you might better explain statistically significant deviations
by viewing each respondent as a unit. In that case, you'd get 446 data
points to answer such questions as "Are experts more likely than
intermediates to describe themselves as cautious and if so, could this be
controlled for given the data?"
<p>
The possibilities are endless...
<p>
<blockquote><i><b>
Author's response:</b> I think I see what you are saying.  I took data that
went across multiple dimensions (which map, level of expertise, level of
risk-taking) and flattened it by plotting only one dimension at a time
(differential vs level of expertise for map 1, and for map 2, and
differential vs level of risk-taking for map 1, and for map 2).  You are
suggesting plotting the three dimensional cube and looking for trends
or patterns in volumes or areas along slices.  Interesting.  I've already
had one person take me up on my offer to pass on the data I have (see
the article by Marc Leotard in this issue).  I again extend the offer if
you are interested in exploring some of your endless possibilities.
</i></blockquote>
<p>
p.s. I have no idea how anyone could not have seen the orientation! I didn't
consiously recognize it at the time (I didn't actually take the test - I
read the article only after the Spring issue came out so I was too late),
but I certainly recognized the 3-D nature of the map. I really wonder about
the spatial-reasoning/depth perception abilities of some of our fellow
Dippers...
<p>
<blockquote><i>In defense of the unwitting experimental subjects, I
don't think that people did not notice the 3-D nature of the map.  But
I think it's easy to not take notice of how 3-dimensional objects
are spatially oriented.  A pattern can be in front of you without you
noticing.  Having read the article about the test before having seen
ruined the possibility of your having missed it.  It's like looking
for an object hidden in a picture.  You can look right at and fail to
see it, but after it's been pointed out to you, it's so obvious that
you can't not see it.

I read the results of your survey, and your interpretation of them, in the
'Zine.  I was very interested in them, and I'm pleased to see how seriously
and intelligently players study the game.  I'm a novice player, but I have
some experience in chess, and some of the more sophisticated articles strike
me as being very similar to those written about chess.
<p>
I was fascinated by both your hypothesis and the study.
<p>
<blockquote><i><b>
Author's response:</b> Thanks for the kind remarks.
</i></blockquote>
<p>
I had some thoughts
on why, perhaps, you didn't get the results you expected, as well as the
irregularities.
<p>
My first thought is about the maps.  The visible "end" of each of the pieces
is on the left in both maps; perhaps those surveyed subconsciously took this
into account when they determined the likely target of the Italian forces.
My second thought is methodological.  The accuracy of at least the breakdown
by skill level relies solely on self-reporting.  Could it be, perhaps, that
rather than experts being more likely to be swayed by the orientation of the
pieces, that those surveyed misrepresented themselves?  It simply seems
unlikely to me that "experts" would be the least likely to base their
conclusions about the possibility of a stab on the actual position of the
pieces.  I have no data to back it up, but it would seem to me that those
unsure enough of themselves to misrepresent themselves as experts (due to
discomfort over inexperience?) would also be the most likely to base their
interpretations on the orientation of the pieces.
<p>
<blockquote><i> The first thought is a possibililty.  The second
is not only possible, but likely.  I mentioned this in my followup to
the original article.  True experts might intentionally downplay their
expertise, but since they have no reason to do so in an anonymous survey,
it is more likely that some players who are experts relative to a large
population of players may not personally consider themselves to be experts.
</i></blockquote>
<p>
Again, I have nothing to support any of these ideas, but your piece got me
thinking.
<blockquote><i>I've received enough comments indicating that I got
people thinking,
that I consider the experiment a success for that reason even if the
results themselves weren't conclusive.   Thanks very much for the note.
