<p>
I recently played a face-to-face game of Diplomacy, my first in about two years.
I was by far the most experienced dipper at the table.  Only
two others had played the game before.  It was about 1903.  I, as
Germany, had a deal with England
to invade Russia, while a non-aggression deal had been reached
whereby France was left free to attack Italy.  Anyway, I was on
the front porch, reassuring Russia that I did not have any plans
to attack him, and that I would be moving from Silesia to Galicia 
in an attack on Austria.  I stepped back into the living room and
as I did so, France and England looked up, somewhat startled by my sudden
return to the room.  Each had in his eyes a look of paranoia, and
nervous guilt.  In turn they scanned my face trying to ascertain how long
I'd been at the door.  I smiled and nodded which seemed to reassure them,
for they had been standing upright with shoulders high, and after my gesture 
they both returned to their normal slouching posture, exhaling just slightly
more than usual.
<p>
France had finally talked England into attacking me.  I knew he'd been trying 
to talk England into attacking me for a while.  I'd been delaying my attack 
on Russia, and France had been getting nervous about his flank, as
his units were now committed to a Mediterranean invasion.
<p>
So an Anglo-French stab on me was obvious, but the negotiation phase
was over and there was no chance to talk them out of it.
I don't think I could have anyway.  Besides, I would have had
to reveal my knowledge of the stab, and it's usually better
to always know a little more than anyone thinks you know.
Holland was the obvious target; the only question remaining was how
it would be attacked.
<p>
At this time, I recalled Simon Szykman's little experiment, and decided
to look at the pieces on the board.  I looked 
carefully at the English fleets in North Sea and Edinburgh, 
the French armies in Belgium and Burgundy.  The angle of the fleet
in Edinburgh suggested a move to North Sea.  Such a move only made
sense if England expected his North Sea fleet to be moving out, not supporting.
It also meant that the attack on Holland would not be made by a convoyed army, but a fleet.
<p>
Based on the assumption that they'd shifted their units while planning and demonstrating their
attack, and had neglected to restore Edinburgh to a less suggestive position (or had not noticed that it had been left as such), I 
did not move Denmark to the North Sea, for this would have been percieved
by England as a stab on him.  I merely moved Ruhr to Belgium, and that single
move foiled the entire operation of G/F.  It turned out to be what I considered
the decisive move of the game. England wouldn't be able to take a single
SC for 
a whole extra year.  In that time, I gained Russia's loyalty
by slipping into Venice unexpectedly.  This also gained the loyalty of Italy
who was fighting a hopeless battle against Austria-France.  The extra unit 
allowed me to build a German fleet which effectively made it impossible for England
France to crack open the <i>Vaderland</i> for another year.  
<p>
While France had planned to support England in a quick and crippling blow,
he was now faced with the prospect of supporting England in a war in which 
Germany would probably not lose any SCs for two years, and those that
were most vulnerable, Denmark and Sweden, would obviously go to England first.
I managed instead to convince France to convoy his army in Belgium into
Wales, and
promised that I would not interfere with his attack on England, but
instead focus on Austria.
<p>
At the same time France invaded Liverpool, Russia retook St. Petersburg.  England
basically
determined that he had lost, and resolved to offer anything to see
Russia -- but especially
France -- suffer.  Italy was also resigned to defeat, bitter at both
Austria and France.  Russia
planned to attack me later, but for now was willing to work with me. 
France was divided fighting
England and Italy, and by attacking Austria, France was alone against
Italy while I kept Austria
occupied.  France no longer had sufficient forces to take Italy
quickly.  My attack on Austria was
going unexpectedly well, and France began negotiating with me for help
in a division of Italy.  I had
everyone on my side, and there was not so much as a non-aggression pact
between any 
other two members of the game.  My growth continued apace from
that point on, and in the final
year (circa 1910) I had about 14 SCs. I realized that if I
stabbed every single player
left on the board
I was sure to reach 17, and I figured if I made enough unexpected moves,
someone was bound to 
not give proper support, allowing me to reach 18.  As it turned out,
every single attempted stab worked out
better than I could have imagined. In fact, even one move that had been
intended to cut support, ended up
occupying Venice.  I went from 14 SCs to 22 SCs in a single Fall season! 
<p>
This was only my second FTF solo victory, my third in my entire
Diplomacy career,
and the first time I'd ever been a part of a FTF game that had ended in
a legitimate
solo (rather than giving the solo to whoever has the most SCs after 8
hours, or the
first to reach a lowered victory condidtion).  It was also the first FTF
game that finished
before the scheduled time had elapsed.
<p>
Of course, I invited all the other players to celebrate my
spectacular victory by treating them to a round of beer and
chicken wings at a local pub.  Yay me, and thank you Simon!
