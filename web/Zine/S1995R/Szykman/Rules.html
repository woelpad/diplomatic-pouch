<h2><center>Rules to the Backseat Driver Variant</h2></center>

<hr>
Below are rules for the Backseat Driver variant.  Different rules apply to
players who control powers and to observers.  Please make sure you know all
the rules and adhere to the correct ones.  If you have any questions or if
something isn't clear, please let me know.
<p>
<b>The following rules apply only to players who control powers:</b>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>As far as powers are concerned, this is a <b>no-press gunboat</b> game.
    You may not send any press messages whatsoever.  NOTE:  There is no way to
    set a game to be no-press for powers while still allowing press for
    observers. Thus, although the judge will not prevent you from sending 
    press, doing so is against the rules.  The only exception is sending 
    messages to the Master using <samp>PRESS TO M</samp>.
<LI>You may not sign on to this game as an observer.
<LI>You may not ask somebody you know to sign on to the game as an observer.
<LI>As with any no-press gunboat game, you may not attempt communicate with
    any players (powers or observers) in any manner except in &quot;usual&quot;
    non-verbal ways, such as using supports, convoys, etc.
<LI>The integrity of the game depends on adherence to the above rules.  Any
    player found
    violating these rules will be ejected from the game.
<LI>Observers will act as advisors to the powers.  Their advice is non-binding.
    At any point in the game, you may follow it or ignore it.  I will try to
    make sure that every power gets at least one advisor, but there are no
    guarantees.  You can still play without an advisor - you just won't have
    anybody suggesting moves or strategies to you.
</OL>
<p>
<b>The following rules apply only to participating observers:</b>
<p>
<OL>
<LI>As far as observers are concerned, this is a <b>no-partial white
press</b> game.
    Messages will be <samp>BROADCAST</samp> and seen by all players (powers
    and observers).
<LI>Press in the Backseat Driver variant is assumed to come from
    &quot;advisors&quot;
    to the powers.  The players who control the powers may decide to take the
    advice given by an advisor or ignore it and do what they want.
<LI>Each observer can control two advisors.  This means you may take on two
    distinct personae.  Selecting what powers to advise will take a bit of
    thinking.  You might decide to be an advisor to two neighboring powers,
    and get them to work together, or you may give "bad" advice to one in
    order to help the other.  You might be an advisor to two weak powers to
    help improve their chances of winning.  You may even decide to use both
    your advisors to advise the same power, giving similar or conflicting
    advice.  It's entirely up to you.
<LI>Observers may not &quot;play&quot; more than two advisors.
<LI>White press games differentiate between powers, but the judge refers to all
    observers as just &quot;observer&quot;.  Therefore, to make the game white
    press, all messages must identify the advisor (not the player) and
    the advisee.
    A good standard to adopt is for all players to begin their messages
    with this
    information in brackets, e.g. &quot;[Sir Laffalot, advisor to
    England]&quot;.
    Having the information at the beginning of the message makes it easy
    for all
    readers to identify the sender without having to read to the bottom of the 
    message.  Observers can, of course, sign their messages in whatever fashion
    they wish, and will have different signatures for each advisor they play.
<LI>No anonymous messages are allowed.  If you accidentally send an unsigned
    message, please send a correction as soon as you notice.
<LI>Since this is white press, observers may not forge messages using the
    signatures of other advisors.  The copies of messages received by
    the Master
    show the sender's address, even in gunboat games, so the identity of anyone
    attempting to forge messages will be known to the Master.
