<h1>The Backseat<BR>Driver<BR>Variant</h1>
<P>
<hr>
<p>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>
This column describes a new Diplomacy variant, called the <i>Backseat
Driver</i>
variant. The Backseat Driver variant is a press variant and can therefore be
combined with other Diplomacy variants.
<p>
The archetypal image of a backseat driver is the nagging mother-in-law who sits
in the back seat of your car while you drive, telling you how to drive
and where
to go.  You might not do what she tells you to do, but because your wonderful
spouse is sitting next to you, you have to sit quietly and listen.  This
variant
was not inspired by my mother-in-law, who is nothing like that, and my saying
this has nothing to do with the fact that my wonderful wife is sitting next to
me while I'm typing.
<p>
The Backseat Driver variant works much the same way.  The various powers
have one
or more advisors (i.e., observers) giving them advice, suggesting moves, and 
conducting negotiations on their behalf. However, the powers themselves are not
allowed to communicate verbally.  All negotiation is done by advisors on behalf
of the powers they represent. These negotiations are non-binding and
advice does
not have to be followed by the powers.
<p>
There are a couple of additional twists. First, not only can powers not
communicate
verbally with other powers, they can't communicate with their advisors either.
All they can do is listen and do what they think is best.  Second,
negotiations 
are done at a round table, meaning that everybody (both powers and
advisors) gets
to read all negotiations.  To put things simply, as far as the players
who control
powers are concerned, the game is a <b>no-press</b> game.  As with any no-press
game, the powers can attempt to communicate with others through their
orders (e.g.
supports or convoys).  As far as advisors (observers) are concerned, the
game is
<b>no-partial white press</b>.
<!p>
<A NAME=Rules>
<!--
Since there is currently no way to have separate press settings for powers and
observers on the judges, the game is set up as a no-partial white press game,
with the understanding that powers are forbidden from sending press even though
the judge would permit it. Obviously, since the game is a no-partial
press game,
it must also be a gunboat game.

In the following section, there's a brief summary of the first Backseat Driver
variant game, followed by a discussion of a few issues that came up during the
game.  If anyone decides to run a game using the Backseat Driver variant rules,
I'd love to hear about it.  If anyone is interested in playing in a Backseat
Driver variant game, please let me know.  If there's enough serious interest,
I'll start another one.

<H3>The Game</H3>
<p>
The first Backseat Driver variant game began last summer and recently ended,
just in time for this column to make it into this issue in fact.  The game
was called, aptly, &quot;<samp>backseat</samp>&quot;, and was a standard game.
(As I mentioned above, the rules can be used with any variant.)  For anyone
interested
in the full history of the game (yeah, right), it was played on the USEF judge
(<A HREF="mailto:usef@diplom.org">usef@diplom.org</a>).  By the
way, the game generated over one megabyte of press.
<p>
As I'll discuss in the following section, it's particularly important
for players
in a Backseat Driver variant game to have a high level of dedication. 
This game
ran under a set of  
<A HREF="../../S1995M/Szykman/Dedicate.html#DPHR">
Dedicated Player House Rules</A>, which impose stiffer dedication rating 
penalties for undedicated players. The DPHRs were discussed in my 
<A HREF="../../S1995M/Szykman/Dedicate.html">"Dedicated to the Game"
column</A> in the last issue of <A HREF="../.."><b>The Diplomatic
Pouch</b></a>.  The game had 72
hour deadlines which is long enough to allow sufficient time for negotiations.
<p>
To briefly summarize the game, there were 11 active observers.  We lost
a couple
of them along the way, but most stayed around until the end of the game.
Because
observers were allowed to advise one or two powers, this translated to
15 advisors.
We also had a total of  around 18 silent observers at some point or
another, six
of which saw the game through to the end.
<p>
<A NAME=Links>
If you are interested, you can, with a click of your finger, read the
end-of-game reports <A HREF="EOG_play.html">from the powers</A> and
<A HREF="EOG_back.html">from the advisors</a>.  If you aren't interested
in the game-specific comments but do want to read
<A HREF="Opinions.html">opinions of the players on the variant itself</a>,
I've excerpted
them from the EOG reports and you can read them separately.
<p>
To summarize the opinions for those of you who prefer pre-digested information:
everyone who commented on the variant liked the game with the exception of one
power who thought the advisor idea was fun but didn't like not being able to
send press (it had been his first experience playing in a no-press game).
<p>

<p>
<H3>Discussion</H3>
<p>
In Mastering this game, a broad set of issues came up.  I thought I would 
describe some of the discussions that went on early on in the game and pass on
some of my own thoughts as well.  Hopefully, this be useful for both Masters
and players in subsequent games of this variant.
<p>
<h4>On The Advisors</h4>
It is desirable for the advisors to be evenly distributed among powers for
reasons of balance.  However, to sustain a level of interest and dedication on
the part of observers, I didn't want to force people to advise powers they 
didn't want to advise.  So, I told observers that they were free to advise 
whomever they wanted, but if they didn't have a preference for one or both of
their advisors, that I would appreciate their letting me assign them to a 
power who needed/wanted advisors.  This worked out pretty well; most observers
were willing to let me assign at least one of their powers.  I think making
this policy voluntary is important.
<p>
The choice of number of advisors per observer took a bit of thinking.  Ideally,
there would be enough observers so that every power could get a couple of
advisors without observers having to double up. In practice, I think the
likelihood of finding that many interested people is low.  Conversely, I
wouldn't suggest going to more than two advisors per observer because observers
would have to spread their time and effort too thinly and would run into
undersirable conflicts of interest (as opposed to intentional ones such as 
trying to use one advisor to sabotage a power in order to help a different 
power and advisor).
<p>
A couple of related questions came up early on.  Can powers fire advisors?
Can powers hire new advisors?  Can advisors switch to a different power during
the game?  My replies were no, yes and in a way.  In the spirit of backseat 
drivers, you can't stop an advisor from giving advice, though you obviously
can ignore it.
<p>
In terms of hiring new advisors, some advisors are more active than others and
some inevitably drop out.  So, if a power wanted more advisors, I was always 
willing to send a call for new advisors to the <B>rec.games.diplomacy</B>
newsgroup and to observers who
were only advising one power.  Obviously, I couldn't guarantee results, and
priority for new advisors went to requesting powers having the fewest advisors.
<p>
As for advisors switching powers, I had a couple of reservations.  First, 
every advisor who left a power would mean work to find a new advisor for that
power.  Second, I didn't want to have advisors blackmailing powers by saying
things like &quot;if you don't do this, I'll leave and go advise Russia&quot;.
I also didn't want advisors abandoning a power whose position took a bad turn
since it would only make things worse for that power.  However, if a power
were eliminated and the advisor wanted to keep playing by advising a
different power, I had no objections.
<p>
<h4>On Player Interactions</h4>
The concept behind the Backseat Driver variant is that the people who are
in control of the units are not the people doing the negotiating.  This makes
for some interesting dynamics which is, of course, the whole point.
<p>
Each observer can play two advisors having distinct personae.  The choice of
which power or powers to advise is one that takes a bit of thinking.  One can
advise two neighboring powers and get them to work together; one can use the
role of advisor to sabotage one power in order to improve the position of
another; one can even play two advisors for one power giving similar or
conflicting advice. Is there a preference to advise a particular power,
perhaps to help a power that generally does poorly, or to try a specific
opening?  Will the
choice of advising depend on the observer's opinion of draws versus wins?
There's quite a bit of freedom involved in how to approach the advisor role.
<p>
Once the game starts, both powers and advisors have decisions to make about 
how to interact.  Who has a position of greater power?  Should a power always
follow an advisor's suggestions?
<p>
In the opening moves of the game &quot;<samp>backseat</samp>&quot;, one advisor
was disturbed that some powers did not follow their advisors' advice.  Somebody
else suggested that perhaps powers should have to follow suggestions from
advisors.  I disagreed, since it would simply make the powers little more
than move-submitters.  Another player pointed out that there may be reasons
for not following advice, not the least of which is the opinion that a
different set of moves would be better. This could be particularly true for
the first move because people tend to favor certain openings over others.  
In addition, powers and advisors have not yet established a solid relationship
this early in the game.
<p>
On the flip side, if advisors are never listened to, the game would be the same
as a no-press game.  There are good reasons for following advice since an 
advisor may see possibilities a power missed.  More importantly, the advisors
are in a position to conduct negotiations, create DMZs and form alliances much
more readily than the powers. Further, one observer made two good
points.  First,
following an advisor's suggestions most of the time gives the advisor
credibility,
which could make others more likely to work with that power.  Second, a
maverick
power who nobody feels can be negotiated with will make an obvious target for 
attacks.
<p>
To summarize, both powers and advisors need to adapt to one another's actions.
Again, this is what makes this game different from a standard (press or
no-press)
game where players act much more independently.  In this variant, cooperation
has enough of an advantage over working independently that I believe it
would be
extremely difficult for a power to do well by ignoring advisors and
working alone.
This takes a little work and a little time.  Players who have played in
no-press
games may recall that it takes a while to become accustomed to negotiating and
communicating without press.  A similar learning period is required here.
<p>
Another suggestion that came up during the game was the possiblity of allowing 
communications between powers and their advisors - perhaps constantly or
perhaps
only one message every so often.  This is a reasonable suggestion, but my 
preference is to not allow that communication.  One reason is that just like I
wouldn't want the powers to be just move-submitters for the advisors, I
wouldn't
want the advisors to become microphones for the powers.  Not allowing powers
and advisors to communicate gives advisors a much better role in the game,
handing them a large amount of decision-making and giving them the opportunity
to take quite a bit of initiative. Perhaps more importantly, I think in terms 
of the issues discussed above (dynamics, adaptation, cooperation) this makes
things much more challenging and therefore (hopefully) fun.  Granted, it may
make things easier, but who wants things to be easier?
<p>
<h4>On Player Dedication</h4>
Player dedication is probably more crucial in the Backseat Driver variant than
in other variants because poor dedication can easily cause the game to
degenerate into a simple no-press game.  In particular, Masters should make
clear that observers should not sign on unless they are ready to make a
commitment to the game.  Disappearing advisors are quite disrupting to the
game and can lead to unfair advantages for other powers.
<p> 
Similarly, long delays due to abandonments or excessive late moves will cause
advisors to lose interest, so dedication on the part of the powers is equally
important.  As I mentioned earlier, the game &quot;<samp>backseat</samp>&quot;
ran under
the Dedicated Player House Rules and was quite successful in that respect. I
also requested that all players (powers and active observers) give me as much
advance notice as possible if they had to leave the game since finding
replacements would be more difficult.
<p>

<h4>Miscellany</h4>
A couple of last little things.   The game I Mastered had 72 hour deadlines.
I wouldn't suggest going to, say, 48 hour deadlines, due to the importance of
allowing adequate time for press.  Not only do advisors need time for
negotiation,
but powers need time to catch up on their advisors' negotiations, proposed
alliances, and suggested moves.
<p>
Another question that came up was HOF points.  I asked Nick Fitzpatrick about
either (1) also giving HOF points to advisors of winning powers or (2) allowing
winning powers on a voluntary basis to share their HOF points with their 
advisors if they so choose.  Nick said no.  He had some pretty good reasons 
and I'm not sure if I disagree in retrospect.  But for anyone who was
wondering, the issue did come up and this was the outcome.
<p>
Early on, somebody asked if draw/concession proposals from powers would be
accepted by me and broadcast. My opinion is that such proposals should be
allowed from powers in no-press games in general.  To prevent using such
proposals as press, the identity of the proposing power would not be
revealed.  Broadcast proposals would look something like &quot;A draw has
been proposed, <samp>SET DRAW</samp> if you agree&quot; or &quot;A concession
to Italy has been proposed, send me your vote with <samp>PRESS TO
M</samp>&quot;.  However, 
because some people have strong opinions on this issue, I suggest the 
Master use his or her preferred policy on this matter and make sure the
policy is stated clearly from the start.
<p>
Well, I hope this discussion has been interesting.  As I said before, if anyone
gives this variant a try, or would like to play if I start another game, please
let me know.
