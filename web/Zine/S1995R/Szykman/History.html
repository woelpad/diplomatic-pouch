<h1>Diplomacy:<BR>An<BR>Historical<BR>Perspective</h1>
<p><hr><p>
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<p>
Most of us probably realize that Diplomacy didn't just come into existence
in 1976 with the introduction by The Avalon Hill Game Company of a game by
that name.  However, for many of us, that is probably the extent of what
we know about diplomacy outside of <b>the game</b>.  I say &quot;us&quot;
and &quot;we&quot; because until I wrote this column, that was the extent
of my own knowledge on the subject.  It was this realization that prompted
me to take what was going to be just a very brief etymological definition
of diplomacy (<i>i.e.</i> where the word &quot;diplomacy&quot; came from),
and expand it into an article on the history of diplomacy.
<p>
Surely the concept of diplomacy goes farther back than does recorded history.
However, trying to think that far back I can't help conjuring up an image of
a <i>Far Side</i> cartoon illustrating an aborted attempt at diplomacy between
two Neanderthals named Ugh and Urk involving a rock, a club and maybe a stone
wheel.  I will therefore stick to what I was able to find out doing a little
research, which necessarily limits this article to the written record.
<p>
<H3>On &quot;Diplomacy&quot;</H3>
<p>
According to <i>Webster's Third New International Dictionary</i>, two
definitions for &quot;diplomacy&quot; are:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>The art and practice of conducting negotiations between nations for
the attainment of mutually satisfactory terms.
<LI>Adroitness or artfulness in securing advantages without arousing
hostility: address or tact in conduct of affairs.
</OL>
<p>
To begin, I will return to my original intention for this piece and describe
the origin of the word &quot;diplomacy&quot;.  The word stems from the Greek
word <IMG SRC="delta.xbm"><IMG SRC="iota.xbm"><IMG
SRC="pi.xbm"><IMG SRC="lambda.xbm"><IMG
SRC="omega.xbm"><IMG SRC="mu.xbm"><IMG
SRC="alpha.xbm">, or diploma, which literally means two fold
(not &quot;twofold&quot;, but as in folded in two).  In ancient Greece, a
diploma was a certificate certifying completion of a course of study,
typically folded in two.  In the days of the Roman Empire, the word diploma
was used to describe official travel documents, such as passports and passes
for imperial roads, that were stamped on double metal plates.  Later, the
meaning was extended to cover other official documents such as treaties with
foreign tribes.  In the 1700's the French called their body of officials
attached to foreign legations the <i>corps diplomatique</i>.  The word
diplomacy was first introduced into English by Edmund Burke in 1796, based
on the French word <i>diplomatie</i> (the -tie in French is pronounced like
the -cy in English and therefore <i>diplomatie</i> sounds very much like
diplomacy only with a French accent). 
<p>
<H3>Diplomacy in Primitive Societies</H3>
<p>
The concept of diplomacy may seem like one that would follow naturally 
once any society reaches a certain level of sophistication.  As it turns out,
this hypothesis is supported by the fact that ideas relating to diplomacy
have arisen in many primitive societies, seemingly without external
intervention.  
<p>
As an example, the idea of diplomatic immunity is known among the
Australian aborigines.  A study of the diplomacy of primitive peoples
encompassing societies in Australia, Asia, Africa and the Americas
showed familiarity with ideas such as messengers and envoys to 
maintain intertribal relations.  Some had beliefs that messengers
are in possession of a protecting taboo that should not be violated.
Others received envoys and their messages according to a given
ceremonial. Messengers were often selected not from among the
expendable members of the society, but from the leading men and
women of the tribe.
<p>
<H3>Diplomacy in Ancient History</H3>
<p>
Due to a lack of a preserved written record, very little is known
about diplomacy in ancient history.  While few in number, there
are references to diplomatic concepts across many societies, such
as the Egyptians,  the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Hebrews, 
the Chinese and the Hindus.
<p>
Documents dating back to ancient Egypt have been discovered that
describe the exchange of envoys between the Egyptian pharaohs and
neighboring monarchs.  In addition to these descriptions, a treaty 
dating to 1278 BCE between the pharaoh Ramses II and Hatursi
II, the king of the Hittites, was found.
<p>
Thanks to a cuneiform library founded by Sargon II in the 700's
BCE, there is a plentiful record of envoys between Assyria,
Babylon and Elam during the reign of Assurbanipal of Assyria,
which lasted until 626 BCE.
<p>
The ancient Chinese were isolationists and did not encourage
contacts or relations with outsiders.  However, records have been
found that describe protocol and rules to be used in such dealings
when they occurred.
<p>
The Hindus also recognized the importance of diplomacy as is
shown by the following quote from the <i>Laws of Manu</i>
(an important Hindu text): &quot;Peace and its opposite (that is
war) depend on the ambassadors, since it is they who create and
undo alliances.&quot;  A political treatise by Kautylia written 
circa 300 BCE includes a chapter about envoys that outlines
their responsibilities, including transmitting points of view of
their rulers, preserving treaties, defending their countries'
positions and gathering information.
<p>
The most abundant source of information is the books of the
Old Testament which document many points in the history of
the Hebrews.  The book of Judges describes the dispatching of
messengers by Jepta to negotiate with the Amnonites, and the 
book of Samuel describes the sending of messengers from the
house of Saul to the house of David to bring peace to the two 
houses.
<p>
<H3>The Greeks</H3>
<p>
One of the first diplomatic figures appears in Greek mythology.  Hermes,
the brother of Apollo, was known for his charm, cunning and trickery.
What better qualities for a diplomat?  Zeus having a similar opinion,
employed Hermes for the most sensitive diplomatic missions and he came to
be regarded by the other gods as the intermediary between the upper and
lower worlds.  The Greeks regarded him as the patron of travelers, merchants
and thieves.  
<p>
Moving from mythology to history, among the earliest diplomats were the
heralds of the Homeric period (the eighth century BCE)  The heralds were,
among other things, official agents of negotiation and were chosen for such
qualifications as a good memory and a loud voice.  As relations between the
Greek city-states became more sophisticated, so did the qualifications for
diplomatic representatives.  By the sixth century BCE, only the best
orators were chosen to be ambassadors.
<p>
By the fifth century BCE, the Greeks had implemented a system of
continuous diplomatic relations.  A good deal of what is known about
diplomacy in ancient Greece comes from histories recorded by Thucydides,
which include an account of a diplomatic conference that took place in
Sparta in 432 BCE.  This conference included such &quot;modern&quot;
concepts as making speeches, debates, proposing motions and carrying out
votes.  Also interesting is the fact that the idea of diplomatic immunity
had already taken root, allowing representatives from city-states with
antagonistic relationships to take part in these conferences.  Demosthenes,
another important historical figure, acted as an ambassador for Greece
for a time. 
<p>
<H3>The Romans and the Italians</H3>
<p>
The Greek system of diplomacy acted as a foundation for that of the Roman
Republic, which grew over the next several centuries and became the Roman
Empire in 27 BCE.  The contribution of the Romans to diplomacy was not
to its practice, but to its theory.  The Romans stressed the importance
of adhering to agreements and treaties.  Rather than producing skilled
negotiators, the Romans produced a skilled archivists who specialized in
diplomatic procedures.  Thus, the Roman diplomat was more an administrator
than a negotiator.
<p>
Whether it was due to a lack of skilled negotiators or those darned leaded
goblets, the Roman Empire eventually started to decline and gave way to the
Byzantine Empire in the sixth century AD.  The Byzantine emperors recognized
the importance of diplomatic skill and revived the art.  Under Emperor
Justinian's rule, the Byzantine Empire grew partly through the use of three
diplomatic strategies: (1) weakening the barbarians by inciting rivalry
between them, (2) securing the friendship of frontier tribes with money and
flattery, and (3) conversion of heathens to Christianity.
<p>
As the Byzantine Empire, too, eventually declined, the playing of one
despot against another became a common diplomatic strategy.  In this
period, the skills desirable in diplomats changed from simple orators to
trained observers who could also provide reports about internal politics
in the courts of the despots as well as in foreign countries.
<p>
In the dark ages in feudal Europe, there was little in the way of an 
established system of dialogues between countries.  The Italian city-states
more than any other nation at the time remained outside the feudal system.
During the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, the diplomatist-statesman
began to appear as a consequence of both common interests and rivalries
between city-states.
<p>
The Venetians were reputed to be among the best in this capacity.  Their
archives include diplomatic documents spanning from the ninth to the
eighteenth centuries and include written instructions given to their
ambassadors,  replies brought back from foreign countries, and reports
written upon completion of missions.
<p> 
<H3>The French</H3>
<p>
Diplomacy did not become a true profession until the fifteenth century, at
which time the Italian States began to appoint permanent ambassadors.
Among the more well known ambassadors were Dante, Petrarch, Boccaccio
and Machiavelli.  Although the profession of diplomat started with the
Italians, it was the French who began to create the very early framework
for modern diplomacy.
<p>
In the 1600's, Cardinal Richelieu made significant advances in diplomatic
theory and practice.  He stated in his <i>Political Testament</i> that
diplomacy should be a continuous process aimed at creating durable
relationships rather than attempting to make opportunistic advances.  At
the time, this was an important shift of the emphasis and purpose of
diplomacy.  
<p>
Up until the eighteenth century, the language of diplomacy was Latin.
Diplomats both wrote and conversed in Latin; documents such as the Treaty
of Westphalia (1648), the Anglo-Danish Treaty of 1670 and the Anglo-Dutch
Treaty of 1674 were all drafted in Latin.  During the eighteenth century,
the French repeatedly tried to have French adopted as the language of
diplomacy.  The idea was so disliked by other powers that four major
treaties that were signed in French had special articles inserted into
the treaty specifying that these should not be considered precedents.
<p>
By the middle of the eighteenth century, however, French had become the
<i>de facto</i> language of diplomacy and at the Congress of Vienna and
the Congress of Paris all proceedings were conducted in French.  It was
only at the Paris Conference of 1918-19 that an English text - the Treaty
of Versailles - was recognized as official.
<p>
Diplomacy was conducted by statesmen and politicians until the beginning
of the nineteenth century.  It was not until after the Congress of Vienna
in 1815 that diplomatic service was recognized as a profession unto itself
in various countries.  It was then that rules and protocols of modern
diplomacy began to take form, based on the precepts set forth by the
French during the preceding two centuries.
<p>
<H3>Modern Diplomacy</H3>
<p>
The next major revolution in diplomacy came with the end of the World War
I.  The most famous of all peace proposals following World War I was the
program of Fourteen Points, delivered by President Woodrow Wilson in 1918.
Two of the fourteen points were: open covenants openly arrived at (which
implied an end to &quot;secret&quot; diplomacy) and the establishment of
a League of Nations.
<p>
Before the establishment of the League of Nations, diplomacy was conducted
between individual representatives of nations or for larger treaties at
congresses such as those described above.  The new idea accompanying the
League of Nations and carried later to the United Nations, was diplomacy
through a somewhat permanent state of conference between representatives
of many nations.
<p>
This system of &quot;multilateral diplomacy&quot; is still in place today,
for better or  worse; diplomatic relations are presently regulated according
to the <i>Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations</i>, a document that
was written in 1961 and was adopted in 1964.  A great deal of the world's
diplomacy that has been conducted since the creation of the United Nations
in 1945 has been done in the same building at the United Nations Plaza in
New York City.
<p><hr><p>
<i>The continuity of the diplomatic institution throughout thousands of
years and in all known civilizations shows that diplomacy is an institution
inherent to international life itself, one that may undergo transformations
or may be used with more or less intensity, but cannot be dispensed
with.</i>
