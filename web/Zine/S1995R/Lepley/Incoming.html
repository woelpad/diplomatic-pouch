<H2>More Reflections from a Diplomacy Newbie</H2>
<H3>Stephen Lepley</H3>
</center>
<HR>
Manus asked for a "Newbie" follow-up regarding what I had learned and
how it actually held up under game play.  My own "rules" of engagement, if
you will.  I not only made up the rules, I got a chance to try them out in
another game for newbies.  By the way, some of these "newbies" have
been playing Diplomacy for years!  That makes it tough on us REAL newbies!
<P>
What follows are my first "rules of engagement" and more or less
how they worked out.  Also, a bit of personal feelings regarding the game.
Since I am playing Russia in this new game (it is still underway), I
have to be a little careful here.
<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Rule #1:  Make one or two allies early on and try to stick with them.</B>
<DD>
This worked out pretty well.  Turkey and I seemed to hit it off and we
promptly took out Austria (with help from Italy).  Do you remember
the recent "Integrity Thread" on the dip news group?  It was "our"
Austria that started it (regarding his sudden demise).  I, unfortunately,
stabbed Turkey in order to convince France and Italy to attack Germany,
who was killing me!  It seemed to work out all right.  They attacked
Germany, Turkey and I made up, and now R/G/T are facing off against I/T.
Rule one is a fairly good one I think.
<P><DT><B>Rule #2:  Get VERY aggressive VERY fast.</B>
<DD>
In my first game, my Italy sort of "wimped" out.  I was determined not
to let my Russia do that.  Rule two was easy!  With Turkey as an ally, Austria
was a natural target!  A few lies, a few moves, and Austria was history.
Never having played beyond the first opponent, I became a little lost
after that first enemy was gone.  It all got much more complicated after
that.  I think rule two is a good one though.
<P><DT><B>Rule #3:  Take advantage of 24 hour a-day home access to the internet.</B>
<DD>I had read that those who sent out volumes of press did better
than those who didn't.  I spent hours sending the stuff out!  I was
determined to bury those who have press limitations.  Did it help?  I don't
know!  Austria is gone.  England is just one nomadic fleet.  I am a part
of a three way alliance and have 7 scs, the same as my other partners.  Rule
three may be good, but next time I will <b>not</B> send out so much press.  I do
have a life!  Or rather, I used to!
<P><DT><B>Rule #4:  Take advantage of the emotional players who become
involved in real spats in the game.  Go out of your way to side with them
and use their emotional over-involvement for your own good.  </B>
<DD>
I wont comment on where and how I used this.  But I did, and it
worked.  Nasty?  I know!  Distasteful too.  Will I do it again?  Is it
good strategy?  Is it moral?
<P><DT><B>Rule #5   Settle the Balkan issue quickly.  </B>
<DD>
In game one I saw how the Balkan conflict could ruin the game for
all involved. Once I had a Balkan enemy, I was paranoid about getting rid
of him fast.  I moved Moscow south on turn one to help.  I didn't want
another Balkan disaster to ruin my chances.  This worked out pretty well.
Italy nearly gave me a Balkan headache but I eventually landed upright
and the Balkans are not keeping the east from standing up to the west.  Not
much wrong with this "rule."  It's usually good to settle all your
conflicts quickly and favorably.
<P><DT><B>Rule #6    (Last rule)  Project all moves out two or three moves into
the future.</B>
<DD>Boy did this rule bomb out!  Mostly due to all the "what ifs" in the
game.  Also due to my still lacking basic knowledge of how to do things.
Not to mention the fact that it takes hours and I am not willing to give
it that time.
</DL>
I didn't realize that I had come into my second game with a basic
misconception.  I had felt that the basic philosophy of the game was to
lie, and stab your way to the top.  I came into game number two
determined to lie and stab with the best of them!  However, more and more
I disliked the lying.  The knowledge that the lies  actually,
personally hurt some of the players bothered me as well.  I became more
depressed about all of it and decided that game #2 would be my last
Diplomacy game ever.  About the time we wiped out Austria, I was starting
to put-off dealing with the game.  I just wanted out.
<P>
At this point, Austria started the "Integrity Thread" on the dip
news group.  I assumed that everyone would just blast him.  I was amazed
at the actual responses.  Many feel that a basic honesty and civility should
be the rule.   Lies and stabs only come in where diplomacy and strategy can
no longer work.  Someone mentioned how cut-throat diplomacy can ruin your
game, in the end.  Man was he right!  I felt some of that backlash in this
game.  One player said he was going to gladly commit suicide seeing that
my game was ruined.  He then proceeded to effectively do it.  Only by
stabbing a good ally and lying did I save my position.
<P>
The "Integrity" thread was a turning point for me.  There are all
kinds of valid philosophies one can use to play this game.  I am starting
do find a technique that I can live with.  I am glad I wont be alone in it.
I'm now more interested in the game, a better allie, and still willing to
lie and stab where need exists!  So, I'm back before I even left.
<P>
I would still like to see an in-depth discussion of these
emotionally over-involved players!  The using of them for your own good.
Manipulating them at a point when they are vulnerable as human beings.
The morality of manipulating individuals who really aren't prepared
emotionally to deal with Diplomacy.  Those people are out there!
<P>
Take it from me, the life of a Diplomacy newbie can be a bit of an
emotional roller coaster as he learns to juggle all the elements of this "game."
