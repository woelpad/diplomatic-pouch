Last time in this column, I presented a couple of my pet failed openings and
asked for the readers to comment on them and to follow this topic.  Indeed, I
did receive a few letters, and you will find them below.
<P>
This time, though, my tack will be a bit different.  This issue is noticably
smaller than the first issue, and so, rather than presenting a topic
for discussion in the next issue, I intend to spend some time discussing this
difference.  Heck, I guess that <em>is</em> a topic for discussion in and of
itself, so if you feel like writing to me about the way the five different
annual issues of the magazine are organized in my mind, feel free.  Yes,
I like that.  Let's call this my and your topic.
<P>
As you surely know, the Retreat issues of the magazine are intended to be
smaller than Movement issues.  This issue proves the point nicely.  Let me
give you a quickie history of the last three months.
<P>
Most of my time in the last three months was taken up administering the
LoebBourse "dippouch" game.  Upwards of fifty investors are now active, and
each, of course, needed to be supplied with a portfolio for their investments,
and their questions answered.  There must have been a megabyte of discussion
about the rules of the game.  (Check out the <samp>HISTORY</samp> of the game
to see what I mean.)
<P>
I thank God that Andy Schwarz stepped forward and answered my plea for someone
to take the Mastering duties away from me, even though this meant giving up his
own investment portfolio.  As I have pointed out in the game, Andy is fast making
a name for himself in the hobby, and accepting the arduous task of Mastering
"dippouch" was not only the best thing he could do for me, but the hardest
and most difficult thing he could possibly choose for himself.  Take it from
a veteran Master and from the one who handed it to Andy:  Mastering "dippouch"
is the toughest, most demanding job the hobby has ever created.  Andy and all
who follow him in this task deserve all of our greatest appreciation.  He
most certainly has mine.
<P>
As it happens, my statement about not requiring articles from regular
contributors for Retreat issues was heeded by most of them, and this worked
out fine for me, since, as I mentioned, my time was totally consumed by the
game.  So I'm actually real happy with this issue.  It confirmed my idea of
the prototypical Retreat issue.  I hope it doesn't disappoint anyone by its
relative brevity compared to the first issue, because I hope it sets a tone
which I plan to follow.  Retreat issues will be a nice rest for all of us
(especially me) who work on this magazine.
<P>
This is not to say, of course, that I will ever discourage contributions.
No indeed.  I'm just saying that it worked out well for me this time that
the contributions didn't number as many as last time.  It also fit right in
with my totally baseless prediction about the size of Retreat issues.
<P>

</A>
So I guess what I'm saying is, "Isn't this Retreat issue idea great?"  There.
There's your question.  Send me your answer, keeping in mind that the said
idea was mine to begin with, so consider your audience (just joking).
<P>
Okay, enough about this issue.  Let's let you see the letters received from
the readers of the first issue.

<h3>From Travis Ruelle
(<A HREF="mailto:ruelle@comware.com">ruelle@comware.com</A>)</H3>
I made a very similar opening as Italy
to the one you described in your "Pouch Deposits" section, at
least in the opening moves.  Strong ties to both Austria and France,
fake war with Austria, go for Munich.  Only France backed out
on me, so it took me a little longer to get it.  And I didn't
go for Warsaw, or try to stab Austria.  Anyway, I thought you
might like hearing that you're not the only one "foolish" (as
the <i>Gamer's Guide</i> calls us) enough to try that.
<P>
<B>My response:</B>  Good!  It's high time all us fools came
out of the closet!  (Oh, wait...maybe not....)

<H3>From Bruce Hitchcock
(<A HREF="mailto:BruceH@accessone.com">BruceH@accessone.com</A>)</H3>
Manus, you asked for openings to explore, so how about England?  Specifically,
I have heard
advice that if England is going to attack France it must be done at once
because France gains
too much in the first year.  So, what are your thoughts on the
<samp><B>F Lon-Eng</samp></B> and <samp><b>A Lvp-Wal</samp></B>
opening?  Is there any way to camoflauge this opening and use it against
the German (perhaps with a convoy into Belgium)?
<P>
<B>My response:</B>  I'm sure the readership will chime in with all sorts of
comments.  Here is a quickie from me.  The most memorable game I played where
this opening was employed by England involved a negotiated E/F/G three-way,
which England chose to break right off the bat with German knowledge.  Germany,
though, saw this rift between England and France as his chance to build three,
and got into Belgium with support from <i>both</I> of the combatants.  This
resulted in
a one-turn surprise E/F, taking Belgium from German hands in Spring of 1902.
However, it remained under German rule because England and France were very easy
for Germany to bust apart diplomatically given their earlier falling-out.  Once
there was a second disagreement, the two were irreconcilable, and Germany played
each against the other for a good long time.

<B>Regarding Simon Szykman's article on dedication points:</B>
I liked your article in the Dip Pouch about dedication points.  I am also
frustrated by the slow progress and abandonments in the games that I am
in. I definitely agree that the -1/+3 rule is quite silly.
<P>
The other thing I have wondered about is a possible bonus for joining a
game that needs replacments.  It would obviously have to be much smaller
than the penalty for quitting, but this might help encourage people to
help out with mercy positions, etc., and get games going again faster.
<P>
It seems like some games wait for a long time for replacements.  To try
to help out, I make half my game starts replacements, trying to
vary the quality of the positions that I take on.
<P>
<B>Simon's response:</B>
Thanks for the message.  I'm glad you liked the article.
<P>
Your point about a bonus for joining games which are waiting for replacements
is a good one that I would have been worth mentioning.  But the
reason I didn't mention it is not because I hadn't heard of the idea,
since I have been following the recent dedication discussions on
rec.games.diplomacy.  It actually looks a lot like a thread that went on
around a year ago, in which I was a much more vocal participant.  In
fact, I may have started the thread but I don't recall for sure.  At the
time I was in something like 18 games at once, only six of which were
not stalled for one reason or another.
<P>
At any rate, I was pushing pretty hard to get the dedication system
reformed and there were many ideas, including the one about giving
people points for signing on as replacements.  The concensus among
a few of the people who actually write judge code was that things like
changing late penalties or CD penalties are relatively minor changes -
just a number here or there.  On the other hand, giving points to
replacements would take quite a large amount of time and effort for
writing new code.  They said they'd be happy if somebody took that
on but that they had things on their to-do list that had a higher
priority so the chances of that actually happening were slim (there
actually is a to-do list for judge programming).
<P>
Since then, I've directed my efforts at convincing people about the
things that are easy to modify, since those are the things that are
actually likely to get changed.  When the idea about dedication
points for replacements first came up, I thought it was a fine idea
and I still think it is.  But, since I don't think it's likely to change,
I've stopped making a big push on that point.
<P>
I think your personal decision to make half your gamestarts replacements is
great.  I've recently signed on to three games that
needed replacements.  If more people did that, we wouldn't need to
suggest giving dedication points as an incentive.

<H3>From Danny Loeb
(<A HREF="mailto:loeb@delanet.com">loeb@delanet.com</A>)</H3>
<B>Regarding Jamie Dreier's "Mastering Newbie Games":</B>
Jamie mentions enforcing the rule against negotiating past the
deadline. I'm not sure if this is in the house rules. (Why not include
a copy of the rules in DP!) In any case, I don't see why such a rule
should apply to the people who got their moves in on time.
If this really was so bad, then the Judge itself would outlaw it,
since that would be easy to prevent.
<P>
<B>Jamie Dreier's response:</B>
If I wrote something inconsistent with this rule, it was a typo. I endorse
this rule entirely. I think Conrad Minshall put it well. It is not fair for
some players to gain a negotiating advantage by negotiating past the
deadline, when others are sticking to the deadline. Thus, anyone not marked
"late" should be free to negotiate with anyone else not marked "late." But
no negotiations by or with lateniks should be tolerated.
Of course, it's up to the gm. But I'm glad it's in the house rules this
way, and I run my games by it.

<B>Also from Danny Loeb, regarding Dan Shoham's "Diplomacy Academy":</B>
I liked the DipAcademy articles. Are we going to see any articles in
which he loses!? Or is he unbeatable!?
<center><HR width=300></center>
<B>Also from Danny Loeb, regarding my "Missing Man Diplomacy" variant:</b>
I suggested once some other ways to cover an empty position. (By the
way, these rules could also be quite easily adapted to cover NMR and
CD situations as well.)
<OL>
<LI>Before each phase and random player is chosen to submit orders for
that country.
<LI>After submitting orders but before revealing them, a random player
is chosen to submit orders.
<LI>All players submit their orders along with orders for all unplayed
countries. A random set of orders is chosen for each unplayed country.
(Or a random order is chosen for each unit of an unplayed country.)
<LI>All players submit their orders along with orders for all unplayed
countries. All orders are revealed. Each unplayed country follows the
set of orders identically submitted by the most countries. A random
choice breaks any tie. (This makes negotiation quite interesting as
players campaign for THEIR favorite set of orders.)
<LI>The weakest player is given the right to submit orders for the
strongest unplayed country. The 2nd weakest player submits orders for
the 2nd strongest unplayed country, and so on.
</OL>
<center><HR width=300></center>
<B>Also from Danny Loeb, regarding Simon Szykman's article on player
dedication:</B>
I like the following system of penalties.
We don't assume that a player who is late or abandons is "bad" but
simply busy. Thus, if a player is late, he is black-listed for a few
days from taking on new committments. If a player abandons a position,
he is black-listed for say a month. Such "penalties" could be sent by
Judge's to an automatic server that Judge's consult after signons to a
game. A human manager could remove these "penalties" on request. (Ie:
if due to judge error...) The penalties would be cumulative and apply
to all judges involved with this system. Players would be allowed to
continue their existing ONGOING games regardless of penalties.
<P>
It would be nice to add a column to DP about work going on improving
the Judge code. There is a list "judgemaint". Could someone there
become a columnist? Perhaps readers could make suggestions.
I have one:
<P>
Sometimes a game starts with players unsuitable for the game for one
reason of another.
<UL>
<LI>He lost interest while the game was forming
<LI>He doesn't get along with the other players
<LI>His dedication has dropped too much since joining the waiting list
<LI>He doesn't understand the rules
<LI>He is involved in simultanous games with the other players
<LI>He doesn't speak the language used in the game
<LI>etc., etc.
</UL>
Or sometimes a player takes over an open position that wasn't quite
that open.
<P>
I suggest that all current situations where a player is assigned a
power, be replaced with a situation where the player receive a letter
saying that he is being considered for the following game (and giving
him the chance to back out immediately), and the GM receives a letter
giving information about the player. The GM would have a special
command allowing him to install the player in the position he has
requested.

<B>Regarding Jamie Dreier's article on the lack of Diplomacy opening theory:</B>
Whilst I agree with the thrust of Jamie's article, I disagree that
the "explosion of possibilities threatens to make opening theory
unmanageable".
<P>
To return to Chess. If I always open <B>1. P-Q4</B> then I must
prepare myself for one of a number of defences (there are at least
10 common defences to this opening).  In response to each of these
choices I must prepare my variation.  But, typically, Black will
have 3 or 4 responses to each of my variations.  So I must prepare
a response to Black's subvariation...
<P>
Opening theory in Diplomacy starts from the premise that you know
what you want.  Suppose that I am playing France.  Then I have a large
number of possible openings.  Certain openings are "better" if I
want to be pro-England, others if I want to be pro-Germany.
Can I rely on Italy not to
open agressively against me?  Am I going for two or three centers?
Where do I want to put my fleet?  There is no one great opening,
but given certain assumptions about the state of diplomacy there are
better and worse openings.
<P>
It is interesting to note that several authors (including myself)
have written articles examining how a nation's choice of openings
effects the result of the game.  There are trends.  We can't say that
"this is a bad opening, don't use it," because there are always games
where a country chose it and did well (in one postal game Germany NMR'd
in Spring 1901, but still won the game!) but we can say that "France
scores significantly better with this opening."
<P>
It is worth remembering that certain authors (such as Richard Sharp)
have developed opening theory based around certain ideas, e.g. that Germany
must keep Austria strong or that Italy and Austria must ally together
against Russia and Turkey.

<H3>From The Unknown Reader</H3>
<B>Regarding Jamie Dreier's article on the lack of Diplomacy opening theory:</B>
After reading your interesting article on "Opening Theory"
I was struck by one thought. I would not consider the
elements a matter of luck. Too much resides in the knowledge
of your opponent and in the knowledge of the importance of
strategic locations. Many people, when placed in the
tactical position you described would have a specific reason
to defend or attack one space over another.
<P>
The cautious player would immediately protect his home
territory, while a more risky, expansionist player might
try to defend the frontier. This plays a much greater role
in the (addmitedly few) games I have played.
<P>
In the end, there are no completely random events,
and most events that some might consider luck, often rely
on trying to predict an opponents psyche. Addmitedly not a
very precise thing, but not random either...
<P>
<B>Jamie's response:</B> I don't agree.  Let me explain.
<P>
Take the main example I gave, the one where Turkey is trying to invade
Italy.
<P>
Take Turkey's role for a moment. You are trying to guess whether Italy will
protect Naples or Tunis. You realize that he is trying to guess, too, of
course. You try to assess whether he is conservative or risky. Suppose you
(correctly) decide that he is a risky-type.
Does that mean he will cover Tun instead of Nap? No, it doesn't.
<P>
As for many, many situations in Diplomacy and other imperfect information
games, the 'best' strategy (technically, the Nash equilibrium) is going to
be a <i>mixed</i> strategy. A typical mixed strategy is, flip a coin, cover Nap
if it comes up heads and cover Tun otherwise. There are many mixed
strategies available. Actually, there are infinitely many. In fact, a large
infinity! An uncountable one. Essentially, the coin Italy flips could be
weighted in any number of ways.
<P>
If Italy adopts a mixed strategy, there is no way on earth that Turkey can
figure out what Italy will do, not just by his smarts. He *has* to be
lucky.
<P>
This sort of thing happens <i>all</i> the time. Practically every move in
Diplomacy involves mixed strategies in the ideal case.
<P>
Now, as a matter of practical gamesplaying, you may be right that in
practice many, most, players will not adopt a genuine mixed strategy at
all. There is certainly room for some psychology. But I don't believe that
all the psychology in the world will let you figure out for sure what the
other guy is going to do.
<P>
Whether there are truly 'random' events or not is actually a red herring, I
think. All that matters is whether the next move is predictable given the
information available to players. So, even if coin flips are deterministic,
we can regard predicting Italy's coin as out of the question!
<P>
(I would be very pleased to have Dan Shoham, or some other accomplished
Game Theorist, comment on the above.)

Congratulations on a fine puzzle! Trying to figure out how a

<P>
I am a chess puzzle fanatic, but Diplomacy puzzles (especially
this one) are, IMO, much more challenging, since Diplomacy has
greater flexibility in how pieces can move.
