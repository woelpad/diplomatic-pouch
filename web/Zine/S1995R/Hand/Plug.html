<H1>Welcome Back, <i>Diplomacy World</i></H1>
<H2>An Interview with Douglas Kent</H2>
<H3><i>Manus Hand</i></H2>
</center>
<HR>

<i>Diplomacy World</i>, one of the flagship postal magazines, recently
was revived from a period of inactivity by Douglas Kent.  As a matter
of fact, the inactivity of <i>DW</i> was one of the many factors which
drove the creation of the magazine you now behold, <i>The Diplomatic
Pouch</i>.
<P>
Jack McHugh successfully guided <i>Diplomacy World</i> through issue #73,
and Douglas Kent picked up the ball thereafter.  Issue #74, dedicated
to McHugh, was Kent's first as <i>DW</i> editor, although Doug's contributions
to the hobby have been legion.
<P>
I greeted the revival of <i>Diplomacy World</i> with joy when I removed it
from my mailbox.  <i>Diplomacy World</i> #74 is filled with tremendous
articles from all around the hobby.  I won't give you a complete
table of contents or review, but one irresistible piece is Allan Calhamer's recounting
of the first Caspian Sea fleet build.
<P>
I've had occasion to talk with Douglas Kent in e-mail quite a bit of late,
discussing how <i>DW</i> and <i>DP</i> can compliment and assist each other.
I thought it would be fitting to transcribe our recent conversations into
interview form and present them to the readership of <i>The Pouch</i>.
As evidenced by the fact that this interview does indeed appear below,
Douglas kindly assented to this.

<DL>
<DT><B>I've been considering making my rave review of <i>DW</i>'s return
	more of an "Interview with
	Douglas Kent" format (like the <A HREF="../../S1995M/Nick/KenLowe.html">Interview
	with Ken Lowe</A> published in the S1995M DP).
	Would you be amenable to being the giving end of an e-mail
	interview?</B>
<DD>Sure, why not?  I haven't been interviewed for a zine since John Fisher Jr.
	did one with me maybe 4 years ago in his late zine <i>California Acres</i>.
	That was mainly a humorous kind of thing, with no
	serious questions and no serious answers.  Probably only 40 people saw it,
	and half of them would be out of the hobby by now.

<P><DT><B>Many readers of The Pouch probably will begin reading this
	interview saying to themselves, "Sure I know who Douglas Kent is; he's the new
	editor of <i>Diplomacy World</i>."  In other words,
	they might not know of your other contributions to the hobby.  I don't
	mean to ask you to blow your own horn or anything, but could
    you fill us in a bit?</b>
<DD>Let's see.  My contributions to PBM and PBEM, eh?  In order of
	appearance, I guess (with some mistakes), they would be:
	<P> 
	Publisher of <i>Maniac's Paradise</i>, my Dip zine [with lots of subzines
	and other stuff] since March 1989.  The 76th monthly issue just hit
	the mail this week.  This is my main area of participation in the hobby,
	and will continue to be so for some time to come.  As far as I'm
	concerned, all other hobby projects are secondary to this zine, because
	it was my first creation and I still get a lot of enjoyment out of it.
	<P> 
	Chairman of the People's Diplomacy Organization (PDO), which runs the PDO
	Relief Auction (PDORA) to raise money for hobby services (BNC, MNC, NAVB,
	Pontevedria, etc.).  I've done this for 3 or 4 years now, after taking over
	for the original PDORA head John Caruso.
	<P> 
	Published <i>Your Zine of Zines</i>, a zine review zine co-edited with Jack McHugh.
	This was meant as a compliment to the <i>Zine Register</i>.  Jack and I would do an
	in-depth review of 3 to 5 zines each issue.  Came out every 2 to 3 months.
	We did 11 issues before we started running out of zines (and entusiasm) and
	gave up.
	<P> 
	Published <i>Foolhardy</i>, a letter column zine dedicated to the discussion of any
	Diplomacy-related topic.  This was meant to fill the void left by the fold
	of Dick and Julie Martin's zine <i>House of Lords</i>.  The first issue was titled
	<i>Painful Rectal Itch</i>, but I changed it to <i>Foolhardy</i> because too many people
	complained, and I wanted to have as wide an audiance as possible.  Sixteen issues
	were published, with the 17th combined with my first issue of <i>Diplomacy World</i>.

<P><DT><B>I saw that.  A smart move by you, lightening your workload
	without forfeiting anything.</b>
<DD><i>Foolhardy</i> had been slowing down a bit anyway, so this was the best way to
	keep it going on a smaller scale.
	<P>
	I published 2 issues of <i>Diplomacy World</i> with the one and only Jack McHugh as
	editor.  So far I've published one with myself as editor, and I'm hard at
	work on my second issue.
	<P> 
	How did I come to take over from Jack?  I said I'd do it, and took it upon
	myself to annouce it to the world.  Jack hadn't been able to get an issue
	out for some time, and no one was sending him any material, so unless
	someone new took over the zine would have died.  I was the only volunteer.
	<P>
	I don't know exactly what's going to be in issue 75 yet...an article on 7X7
	Gunboat Tournaments, Japanese strategy in Colonial Dip, a few other articles
	so far, but no solid table of contents.
	<P> 
	I've been a frequent GM and player on Compuserve as well, and for the past
	two years or so I've edited and compiled <i>The Eccentric Diplomat</i> (TED), where
	all the Compuserve variant games are played.
	<P> 
	Can't think of anything else offhand.  Can you?

<P><DT><B>Don't be modest.  You've also won a few awards, haven't you?</B>
<DD>The hobby at large was kind enough to award me the <b>Melinda Holley Award</B> for
	quantity participation in 1993, and the <B>Don Miller Memorial Award</B> for
	service to the hobby in 1994.
	<p> 
	<i>Maniac's Paradise</i> has done well in the various hobby zine polls, winning the
	Marco Poll 3 times in a row (I think) and coming in the top 3 in the
	Runestone Poll for a number of years.  I never won the Runestone Poll though (yet).

<P><DT><B>I think someone should start a poll on Dip Web zines.  I should clean up!</B>
<DD>Nah, what if you didn't?  You'd feel too bad!
 
<P><DT><B>Since it's what you enjoy most, let's talk a bit about <i>Maniac's Paradise</i>.
	Out of curiosity from a co-zine publisher, how much time do you spend getting
	out each issue?  If this is the 76th issue since '89, that's like one a
	month, isn't it!?  Wow!  What kind of volume are we talking about?</B>
	
<DD>Yup, one a month like clockwork.  Every issue has been in the mail within 48
	hours of the deadline -- many within 24.  In the beginning issues were maybe
	10 to 16 pages long.  Nowadays they are bigger - around my mid-60's I was
	hitting 50 pages an issue, now I'm down to an average of 40 pages per
	issue.
	<P> 
	I work on the zine throughout the month, so it is hard to measure how much
	time it takes.  I would guess 20 hours or more per issue.
 
<P><DT><B>If you could give me the "how to subscribe" stuff, I'm sure the Pouch
	readers would copy it down.</B>
<DD>Sure, send money to me at 6151 Royalton Drive, Dallas, TX  75230.  The zine
	is published monthly, in full-page format.  Issues are $1.50 in the US and
	Canada, $3 elsewhere.
	<P>
	My e-mail address is
	<A href="mailto:73567.1414@compuserve.com">73567.1414@compuserve.com</A>, so
	anyone who wishes to subscribe to MP or DW can get a hold of me that way too.
<P><DT><B>Most people know that I am an e-mailer by trade.
	Since you have some expertise in the snail mail side of the hobby, I wonder
	if you could give all us e-mail snobs the lowdown on how PBM works?  I
	only started receiving snail mail 'zines since making my own contributions
	to the literature of the hobby, and have found that the 'zines run snail
	mail games.  Is this the main forum for play?
	How often, therefore, can one expect to find a gamestart?  How long
	are the deadlines?  How many games are run by a typical zine?
	Too many questions?  I'll shut up.</b>
<DD>Zines are the only PBM forum for play.  There are numerous gamestarts
	available at all times - probably 15 Dip games open for sign-ups right now
	in the US at least.  Most deadlines are between 4 and 6 weeks, depending on
	the frequency of the zines.  Most zines run 4 or 5 regular Dip games or
	variants, while some (like mine) run a lot more than that (I currently run
	12 Dip games, 2 games of Gunboat, 1 of Woolworth, 1 Narnian Wars, 1 7X7
	Minimalist Dip tournament, and 1 game of Enemy in Sight - with other games
	run in subzines).

<P><DT><B>Do you know how many PBM players are active right now?</b>
<DD>I compiled two Census listings of all active North American PBM Dip players
	(the last one compiled in late 1992), but I don't know how many active players
	there are now -- Tom Howell is doing a new census as we speak to answer that
	question.
 
<P><DT><B>Can you tell us more about the PDO?  Is there a publication?  How can
	people help out?</b>
<DD>There is no publication.  I distribute a beg-a-thon letter annually,
	looking for Dip players to donate items for auction (subs to zines, old
	games, software, anything of value).  Then I distribute a list of all items,
	let people submit bids, and coordinate the collecting of money and the
	shipment of items to winners.  The PDORA Financial Committee then votes on
	each funding request they receive, and I send out checks to those receiving
	funds.
	<P> 
	If you want funding for a hobby endeavor, you submit a funding request and the
	committee votes on it.  You can be as detailed as you want, spelling out your
	losses, or just say "I want money for such-and-so in the amount of $X" and
	they'll vote on that.
 
<P><DT><B>Let's turn to some more general Dip questions.  When did you first play
	Diplomacy?</B>
<DD>I probably first played The Game in some form when I was about 9 or so.  My
	neighbor Mike Plog had many Avalon Hill games -- he introduced my older
	brothers and me to Waterloo, Feudal, Diplomacy, and a few other games.

<P><DT><B>How did you get into the play-by-mail hobby?</B>
<DD>I have only played maybe 4 games face-to-face.  I don't socialize much -- I prefer to
	spend my time at home with my wife and 4 cats.  I have never attended a Dip
	convention (yet).  I first saw an ad for PBM gaming in <i>The General</i>, and through
	that was contacted by a fellow named Shawn Erikson, who published a zine
	called <i>Victims Wanted</i>.  PBM seemed perfect for an anti-social person like
	myself.  In fact,
	I have managed to avoid meeting any member of
	this hobby personally except for 2 (1 stopped by my office uninvited, the
	other I met when I visited the widow of a Dip friend).  I like to keep
	things mysterious.
 
<P><DT><B>Do you remember your first game and how you did, or which power you were?</B>
<DD>I think I was France in my first PBM game, and I either drew or maybe it
	was abandoned.
 
<P><DT><B>What is your favorite power to play and why?</B>
<DD>No preference - I like to switch around.  I'm in quite a few games at one
	time (although I have cut down a lot in the last 2 years), so it doesn't
	matter much to me, as long as I don't play one country all the time.  I like
	Italy and Austria because of the desperation feel they give, where you can
	try wild openings in the hopes that you'll at least survive the game.
 
<P><DT><B>What do you think is the one thing an expert Dipper does which a newbie
   has to learn to do?</B>
<DD>Two things, really.  An expert Dipper communicates often, in a thorough
	manner.  An expert PBM dipper also submits orders early, and then changes
	them later if he has to.  I've seen many promising positions go down in
	flames because a player waited till the last minute to get his orders in,
	and then for whatever reason NMR'd.
	<P> 
	I always do the latter...I've yet to succeed on the former on a dependable
	basis, probably because I play too many games and also wait for players to
	write me before I write them.

<P><DT><B>Okay, I think I have all I need to make
	a pretty good interview article.  Would you like to look at it before
	publication?</B>
<DD>Nahh, surprise me.
 
<P><DT><B>Okay...surpriiiise!</B>
