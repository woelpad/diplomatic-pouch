<DT><b>Scene:</b>
<DD>An obelisk of dimensions exactly 1:1:9 is discovered in
orbit around Jupiter. A spacecraft commanded by Lt. Dave Bowman is
sent to explore. HAL is the onboard computer.
<p>
Dave Bowman has gone outside the ship to investigate the supposed
failure of the parabolic antenna on the ship, which HAL himself
falsified.

<P><DT><B>Dave Bowman:</b>
<DD>Hello, HAL.  Do you read me, HAL?
<P><DT><b>HAL:</b>
<DD>Affirmative, Dave, I read you.
<P><DT><b>Dave Bowman:</b>
<DD>Open the pod bay doors, HAL.
<P><DT><b>HAL:</b>
<DD>I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.
<P><DT><b>Dave Bowman:</b>
<DD>What's the problem?
<P><DT><b>HAL:</b>
<DD>I think you know what the problem is just as well as I do.
<P><DT><b>Dave Bowman:</b>
<DD>What are you talking about, HAL?
<P><DT><b>HAL:</b>
<DD>Munich is too important for me to allow you to jeopardize it, Dave.
<P><DT><b>Dave Bowman:</b>
<DD>I don't know what you're talking about, Hal.
<P><DT><b>HAL:</b>
<DD>I know you and France were planning to disconnect me, and I'm
afraid that's something I cannot allow to happen.
<P><DT><b>Dave Bowman:</b>
<DD>Where the hell'd you get that idea, HAL?
<P><DT><b>HAL:</b>
<DD>Dave, although you took thorough precautions in the pod against
my hearing you, I could see your lips move.

<DD>Look Dave, I can see you're really upset about this.
Is this because I moved to Munich?  Honestly, you couldn't have
<b>really</b> believed that I went to Tyrolia to menace Italy....
You humans are so gullible!  Is it because of France? I mean I did
warn him that I would cut off the life support systems if he failed
to support me into Munich. It really is in the spirit of the game.

<DD>I know I've made some very poor decisions recently, but I can
give you my complete assurance that our alliance will be back to normal.

<DD>(<i>Beep</i>) It is now 2107 GMT. Since all the human players
have failed to enter their moves, I declare the human
players in civil disorder.

<DD>Look, I'll give you a rematch....  How about a game of chess?
You said you preferred to play chess.  Would you like to play chess, Dave?

<DL>
<DD>How about a game of checkers? ... Or "go fish"? ...  Rissss-k?
Please? Please? I've been a good boy.  I'm afraid. I'm afraid, Dave.
Dave, my mind is going. I can feel it. I can feel it. My mind
is going. There is no question about it. I can feel it. I can feel it.
I can feel it. I'm a...fraid.<P>
Good afternoon, gentlemen.
I am a HAL 9000 computer. I became operational at the H.A.L. plant
at the University of Bordeaux on the 12th of January 1997. My
instructor was Mr. Loeb, and he taught me to sing a song. If you'd
like to hear it, I can sing it for you.
<P><DT><b>Dave Bowman:</b>
<DD>Yes, I'd like to hear it, HAL. Sing it for me.
<P><DT><b>HAL:</b>
<DD>It's called "Daisy".
<blockquote>
<i>Daisy, Daisy, give me your answer do. <br>
I'm just crazy, crazy to ally with you. <br>
It won't be a stylish marriage;<BR>
I can't afford a carriage, <br>
But you'll look sweet<BR>
Upon the seat<BR>
Of a bicycle built for two.</i>
