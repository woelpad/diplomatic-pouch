<h1> The<BR>Observation<BR>Module </h1>
<HR>
In the S1995M issue of Diplomatic Pouch,
 we described the functioning
of the strategy finder, that is the strategic code on which our
Bordeaux Diplomat is based. 
This lower brain of the diplomat does all the calculations and thus
forms the basis for the decisions taken by the upper brain, or
negotiator part of the diplomat.
<p>
The negotiator does not know the details of the map, nor the rules of
the game. On the other hand, it must be able to communicate with the
other players, distinguish between friends and enemies, form
alliances, and so on. To make decisions, the negotiators poses
concrete questions to the strategic core, and following the answers to
these questions, it choses the appropriate moves to submit, or
messages to send out.
<p>
The strategic core does not know what country the diplomat is playing.
It is simply a disinterested, objective observes who calculates the
best moves countries given a certain number of constraints
along with the value of the resulting position of all countries.
<p>
The negotiator determines these diplomatic constraints in two ways:
<ul>
  <li> by negotiating with the other players, and
  <li> by observing the moves made on the board      
</ul>
In this article, we will discuss the observation module which is
responsable for this second task. This module has been partially
implemented thanks to Arnaud Moulard and Christophe
Moustier.
<p>
The program was written in LCS (a version of SML developped in
Toulouse for parallel processing). It takes as input the adjudicated
moves from a single season, and a friendliness matrix. The program
output a revised friendliness matrix. This 7 by 7 matrix of real
numbers indicates the  
love/hate relationship between each pair of players. Positive values
indicate friendliness and negative values indicate animosity.
<p>
It is to be noted that "trustworthiness" is tracked with an
independant data structure called StabLimit. StabLimit is the observed
minimum gain required for a country to violate its agreements. For
example, in the game DipPouch, England stabbed France by opening to
the English Channel. If the diplomat judged that such a move gained
little for England, then he would be given a low StabLimit. Thus, even
if England finally did make peace with France, the program would
continue to anticipate that a stab would be made under similar
circumstances. 
<p>
The following factors are used to update the Friendliness Matrix.
(Factors not yet implemented are in paratheses.)
<ul>
  <li> <b>Violation of Specific Agreements</b>. Agreements not to
       occupy a certain space <b>DMZ ...</b>, to make certain moves
       <b>XDO ...</b>, or to <b>not</b> make certain moves <b>NOT(XDO
       ...)</b> can be automatically verified. A bonus 
       is given in case of respect. In case of
       violation, a penalty  is given,
       (and the "ambassador" process for the
       nation in question is signalled so that it can ask for an
       explanation. The bonus achieved by stabbing or ignored by
       refusing to stab are computed, and stored as STABLIMIT data
       while updating friendliness accordingly.)
  <li> (<b>Violation of General Agreements</b> such as "peace"
       <b>PCE</b> or absence of agreement in the case of  a
       silent partner. Use strategy finder to check if moves
       correspond better to those where 
       countries are allied and to those where country is not allied.)
  <li> <b>Coordinated Moves</b>. If a country supports or convoys the
       units of another country <b>SUP, CNV, CTO</b>, this indicates
       that the two countries are probably coordinating their moves,
       and a bonus is awarded.
       If a support or convoy was refused <b>NSO</b>, then this may
       indicate a possible stable, and a small penalty is given.
  <li> <b>Attacks</b>. Penalties are given for all conflicts,
       according to whether support was <b>CUT</b>, units bounced
       <b>BNC</b>, or the attacked totally failed <b>FLD</b>.  An
       especially big penalty is given if the defender is forced to
       retreat <b>RET</b>.
  <li> <b>Movement</b>. If an attempt is made to move, convoy, retreat, build
       or destroy a unit of player X, then compare distance to the
       nearest supply center of player Y        with the attempted 
       supply center. The distance is calculated according to whether
       the unit is an army of a fleet. In the case of units being
       built or destroyed, the distance is considered "infinite" for a
       non-existant unit.  
       This change in distance is filtered (0-1 is a big difference,
       4-5 hardly counts at all) and reduced by 50% if move failed
       <b>FLD</b> or bounced <b>BNC</b>.
       This filter function with first derivative negative, second
       positive, serves to weight the distance between the unit and
       player in question. The larger the distance, the less the
       importance of that unit.
       We weight successful advances more heavily than unsuccessful
       attacks.
  <li> <b>History</b>. To take into account the history of the game,
       we add in a 70% of the previous friendliness matrix.
  <li> (<b>Size</b>.        The fact that builds are always considered
       agressive and removal are always considered friendly will allow
       us to concentrate on our most dangerous opponents. However,
       additional penalties must be given to any country much closer
       to victory than the other country. This could be measured by
       number of supply centers, or better by how far many moves would
       be needed to capture 18 under ideal circumstances.)
  <li> <b>Symmetry</b> The friendliness is stored in a matrix F. 
       F is replaced with F + F-transpose. This represents the fact
       that friendliness is a symmetrical relationship. The
       relationship between X and Y is the same as that between Y and
       X. 
  <li> <b>Transitivity</b>. F is then replaced with F plus a small
       multiple        of F^2. This means that the friends of our
       friends and the enemies or our enemies have a tendancy to be
       our friends, and the friends of our enemies and the enemies of
       our friends have a tendancy to be our enemies.
</ul>  
We thus calculate the friendliness matrix.         
We use so many different critirea so that it is as difficult as
possible to fake true friendship or true war.
Alliance thresholds are determined from this friendliness matrix in
order to divide the seven countries into about 4 "blocs" or
"alliances". These 
blocs are used as parameters of the strategy 
finder in its calculations. 
<p>
The rules allow 15 minutes for negotiation after a movement phase.
Our observation module requires about 15 seconds to calculate the new
matrix leaving the bulk of the available time to negotiate and
calculate new orders.
