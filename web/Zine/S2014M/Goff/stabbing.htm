<p><b>Diplomacy</b>, as played by social players around the world, would have been better 
named “Stabby McStab goes to Stabville”. It’s all about taking centres where you 
can; negotiating turn-by-turn to make the most of the glorious mess that is 
<b>Diplomacy</b> when played by beginners, however talented.</p> 
 
<p>As players gain more experience, and especially when they are exposed to face-to-face tournaments, the elements of the game beyond the tactical are 
developed: Alliances last more than a few turns.</p>  
 
<p>The stab, however, is rarely ever far from the mind of intermediate players. This 
is a critical phase of development in your play. If you don’t learn to stab, you will 
always be vulnerable to the stabs of others. You must develop a sense for your 
vulnerabilities, however much you go on to stab in your <b>Diplomacy</b> life.</p> 
 
<p>Here is a great example to practice your stabbing sense, from a game Bernard 
Andrioli provided on Facebook recently. Spring 1907 is coming up, and EF is 
allied against RA, with Austria having just stabbed Italy. Can you find the best 
tactical stab? Here is the map; take a few minutes to consider it before you read further.</p>

<p>The stab I think is the tactical best here is for England against France:

<p>It’s a 3 centre stab, with all the spring moves being alliance-oriented (setting up 
to land armies in Northern Russia and helping France into Munich while 
covering Kiel from retreat) and the fall moves all pretty much guaranteed as 
France must defend Munich.</p> 
 
<p>It leaves England with armies in Ber, Kie, Hol, and Bel and fleets in all the right 
places to continue the attack. France is losing units everywhere and the moment 
they defend against England Italy will open a second front. Pretty awesome, huh? 
And when you see stabs like this and defenses against such dark magic, your 
results improve dramatically.</p> 
 
<p>I wouldn’t do it. This is the crux of the article.</p> 
 
<p>Stabs are a great way to gain centres, but if you want to win games of <b>Diplomacy</b>, 
you need to look beyond the next few years’ centres and see the endgame. Stabs, 
however tactically pretty, need to lead to wins, not just taking you from 8 to 11 
to 13 centres. </p>
 
<p>That’s what this stab does. Step back a moment. England has clearly the best 
position on the board, so how do they leverage this to turn it into an 18?</p> 
 
<p>Well, on this board England almost certainly won’t get Por, Spa, or Mar. France 
can defend them until Italy takes them off her (or forever). Let’s assume England 
gains everything else in the West (Lon, Lpl, Edi, Par, Bre, Bel, Hol, Kie, Ber, Mun, 
Swe, Nwy, Den, StP), making 14. It’s not unreasonable to see this, though Munich 
is a tough ask. To get these 13/14 centres, this stab is superb and all but assures 
them. But where are the next 4? Mos and War are not enough. That’s dubious, 
and still only 16. Sev? Vie?</p>  
 
<p>If you stabbed France, you just got a 13-16 centre England, but threw away any 
hope of an 18. This is why you shouldn’t stab. Not because you don’t gain enough centres; not because you don’t cripple your opponent; and not because it’s a 
mean thing to do. Because you just ruled out winning the game.</p> 
 
<p>England’s 18 on this board is still possible (not likely, but then 18s never are ) 
but only if France brings down the stalemate line. Once France takes Tunis, and 
can force Piedmont and Austria loses Munich, there is a genuine pressure 
situation on for Austria to hold the line with Russia, even if Italy is on-side. 
There’s a stray Turk&#8230; And the East has the wrong units.</p>  
 
<p>Best play says it is possible to hold the stalemate line &#8212; it can be done, but I’ll 
leave it to you to figure out (Assume this game is EFT v RAI and see if you can 
find RAI’s guaranteed stalemate). The point is &#8212; it’s very hard and if the position 
slips at all, the line can come crashing down.</p>  
 
<p>If it does, Enlgand now gains access to the centres she needs to get to 18. With 
work, an English army in Galicia is possible, and this army helps other armies 
into Vie, then Bud. From that position it is possible to envisage an English 18, and 
once you are in that position, then is the time to stab France. Even if you don’t get 
Brest and Paris, you can now pick up Rum, Tri, or Sev &#8212; your options have 
expanded to needing 2 centres from 5 possible &#8212; far better odds than 4 from 0.</p> 
 
<p>So, if you want to win, the correct move above is to get your armies into 
Northern Russia as rapidly as you can. Breakdown the stalemate line. Then, once 
you have leveraged open the shot at winning, it’s time to find the tactical stab. 
Strategy first; then tactical.</p> 
 
<p>Remember, also, that not stabbing is a diplomatic tool. After you don’t stab, it’s 
worth considering telling the player you didn’t stab how you didn’t stab them. 
It’s an effective disarming tool against many players; having said that strategy 
always trumps tactics it is also important to remember that all elements of the 
game interact with each other.</p> 
 
<p>The stab is the most powerful tool of the tactical arsenal, but only when you see 
it as a tool to achieve your strategic objectives will you go from intermediate 
stabs that look good to seeing the stabs that genuinely lead you to game winning 
positions.</p>
