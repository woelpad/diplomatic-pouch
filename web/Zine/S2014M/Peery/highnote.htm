<p>Since this is WACcon’s last event and since they are trying to go out
in style; I decided to try and come up with an Old Fart’s alternative
to a Roast featuring an Elvis impersonator!  I don’t think you can get
much different from Elvis than the music of J. S. Bach, if I do say so
myself. The piece I picked is “Schafe konnen sicher weiden,” known in
English as “Sheep May Safely Graze.” I chose it because the tune is
universally known and loved, and relatively easy to hum along to even
if you can’t sing. Long before there was “Hound Dog” there was “Sheep
Safely Grazing.”
<p>The sheet music can be found online at:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.freegigmusic.com/content/piano-vocal/pn-vcl_sheep-may-safely-graze/">http://www.freegigmusic.com/content/piano-vocal/pn-vcl_sheep-may-safely-graze/</a></strong></p>
<p>You can find some background information on Bach’s work at:</p>

<p>Below are the original German words, and an English translation.</p>
<blockquote><i>
<p>(<b>English</b>):<br/>
Sheep may safely graze on pasture<br/>
When the shepherd guards them well.<br/>
Where rulers govern well<br/>
we may feel peace and rest<br/>
and what makes countries happy</p>
<p>(<b>German</b>):<br/>
Schafe können sicher weiden,<br/>
Wo ein guter Hirte wacht.<br/>
Wo Regenten wohl regieren,<br/>
Kann man Ruh und Friede sp&#252;ren<br/>
Und was Länder glücklich macht.</p>
</i></blockquote>
<p>Many, many recordings of this are on YouTube. Alas, I couldn’t find
the one I wanted by the Japanese soprano and Bach/Schubert expert
Tomoko Yamamoto, but these are all good. The next to last one, by
Flagstad was recorded when she was 63. Ip is a Hong Kong Chinese and
notice how much faster the tempo here is. She knocks more than a
minute off the length of the piece. Asians tend to play classical
music faster than Westerners. I’m not sure why, but her diction is
superb.</p>

<p>Using the English text it wasn’t difficult to come up with a
“Diplomacy friendly” version which follows, along with a German and
French translation of the English text&#8230;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><i><u>Dippers May Safely Play, from WACcon 2014</u></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>&#8212;by Larry Peery</i></p>
<i><b>English:</b><br/>
Dippers may safely play,<br/>
where a good gamesmaster watches.<br/>
Where a Tournament Director governs well,<br/>
one senses peace and harmony<br/>
and what makes the players happy.</p>
<p><b>German translation:</b><br/>
Wasseramseln k&#246;nnen sicher spielen,<br/>
wo eine gute Gamesmaster-Uhren.<br/>
Wenn ein Turnier-Direktor regelt auch,<br/>
ein Frieden und Harmonie spürt<br/>
und was macht die Spieler gl&#252;cklich.</p>
<p><b>French translation:</b><br/>
Cincle peuvent jouer en toute s&#233;curit&#233;,<br/>
o&#249 un bon ma&#238;tre du jeu regarde.<br/>
Si un directeur de tournoi r&#233;git bien,<br/>
on sent la paix et l'harmonie<br/>
et ce qui rend les joueurs heureux.</p>

<p>How these revised words will meld with Bach’s tune remains to be
heard; which brings me to the next point. How to get this performed at
WACcon? Originally I was going to attempt to persuade some of the
attendees at the Roast to try singing it, but I gave up on that idea.
Instead I’m proposing moving this world premier (and probably last
time ever) performance to that deadly dull period that happens at cons
during the interval between when the playing stops and the winners are
announced. That will give the “volunteer” singers a chance to
practice, I hope, for a few minutes.</p>
<p>Ah, what volunteer singers you are wondering? And I can see the beads
of sweat forming on some of your brows already. Well, you’re getting
this because I either know or suspect you can sing or you know one of
the languages (English, German, or French) I’d like to use. Hopefully
during the event we can recruit a few other volunteers, especially
among our foreign guests. I remember the French Diplomacy players at
WDC II when, after winning the championship, they spontaneously
climbed up on the stage and sang a rousing rendition of La
Marseillaise as the English players looked on in horror! It was a
truly memorable moment, and I’m sure WACcon can come up with something
just as good.</p>
<p>So: Bernard, Yann, Goff, and Nathan: it’s up to you guys to help me
recruit some singers!</p>
<p>And unless you’re into a cappella vocals it might be nice to have CD
of Bach’s music and a CD player to use. Nathan, can you find those, or
find somebody on site who can? If nothing else that will help disguise
our less than heavenly voices. I just went through my collection and I
don’t have a LP or CD recording of this.</p>
<p>Any questions, other than the obvious one, “Has he gone mad?”</p>
