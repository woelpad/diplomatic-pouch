<h2>Introduction: Disaster in 1901</h2>

<p>Russia 
is a more difficult country to play in <b>Diplomacy</b> than it first appears.   
Not only does she have four neighboring opponents compared to the usual 
three for the other corner powers, but the dual sea frontage means she 
cannot coordinate her four units effectively. Even worse, 
Russia is not guaranteed at least one build at the end of 1901.   
Russia not building at all in the 1901 adjustment phase is an increasingly 
seen occurrence in <b>Diplomacy</b> tournaments as well as PBEM games, and 
this trend has started to reduce her overall ranking in recorded game 
statistics.   What I wish to address at length in this article 
is one particular problem: the tendency of German distrust to lead to 
no Russian builds in 1901, which is usually followed by a Russian collapse 
in the next few turns.  Of course, there is no perfect opening 
strategy for Russia or any other country in <b>Diplomacy</b>, so solving this 
problem may well lead to others; but the solution should at least reduce 
the tendency of Russia to suffer an ignominious early elimination.   </font> <br>


<p>The 
primary blame for Russia not building at the end of 1901 lies with Germany 
and with Russia herself.  Numerous articles have been written 
about how disadvantageous it is for Germany to pick an early fight with 
Russia by bouncing the northern Russian fleet in Sweden.   
The reasons seem to be straightforward: Germany should keep her eastern 
border at peace while she confronts the problem of the western triangle, 
and Russian friendship is also a key advantage when Germany confronts 
England, who is her most dangerous long-term adversary.   
So most <a href="http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/germany.htm">conventional 
and conservative advice</a> (which 
fits with Bismarck's historical policy of keeping friendly relations 
with Russia in order to secure German hegemony in central Europe) is 
to maintain friendly relations with Russia, starting first of all by 
not bouncing Russia out of Sweden in Fall 1901. 
<p>Unfortunately, 
this sound approach for Germany is under increasing challenge by a more 
cutthroat approach.  The thinking is that Russia's ability 
to expand on two sea fronts and to fight on both sides of the Finland-to-North 
Africa empty zone, negating stalemate attempts, makes Russia Germany's 
most dangerous long-term opponent.  Already the logic is suspect 
here, as articles by <a href="http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/turnbull-russian.htm">Don 
Turnbull</a> and <a href="/Zine/W2000A/Tuft/Fear.html">Ole 
R. Tuft</a> make it clear that Germany 
has at least as much if not more to fear from England's potential 
expansion, but there is something about starting with four units and 
all that extra board space which tends to trigger Russophobia in many 
players handling Germany.
<p>Short 
of an immediate EFG triple alliance, Germany cannot launch a full attack 
on Russia in Spring 1901 without suffering serious consequences.  
So instead, Germany fights Russia from the outset by proxy.   
The first step is to bounce Russia out of Sweden in Fall 1901 (more 
sneaky and less common is to let Russia into Sweden while playing F 
Den-Bal, A Kie-Den and Sweden falls in Spring 1902, but this strategy 
fails against Russia's German attack described below).   
The second step is to whisper in the ear of Turkey or Austria that Russia 
is too dangerous (for geographical or personal reasons) to be allowed 
even the slightest expansion in 1901, and so should therefore be bounced 
out of Rumania.   If successful, the result of such diplomacy 
is that Russia gets no builds in 1901.   Germany can then 
sit back and throw his units at either England or France, while the 
neutered Russian bear is brought down by Austrian and Turkish wolves 
in the south and/or English pirates in the north.   Once Sevastopol 
and St. Petersburg fall, Germany needs only to send a pair of armies 
towards Warsaw in order to grab his share of the kill.   This 
overall pattern accounts for the substantial majority of early Russian 
eliminations in <b>Diplomacy</b>.
<p>Russia's 
share of the blame in this outcome is even more straightforward.  
The set of opening moves played by the majority of Russian players is 
the Ukraine System: F StP - Bot, A Mos - Ukr, A War-Gal, and F Sev - 
Bla.   This opening plays right into the hands of Germany's 
anti-Russian strategy. The Ukraine System is one of 
many openings in <b>Diplomacy</b> which is tactically well-motivated (and still 
a good choice in no-press gunboat games) but that is also diplomatically 
unsound, primarily because it concentrates Russia's units too early.   
This opening sets off alarm bells in the one country that Russia should 
not alienate in 1901: Austria. The Austrian player not only 
sees both of Russia's armies move in his direction, but realizes that 
one of these armies (probably A Ukr) is headed to Rumania, where it 
threatens Austria's centers in Budapest and Serbia and also links 
up with and supports Turkey's potential anti-Austrian moves.   
Experienced Austrian players will react predictably: either they will 
ask Turkey to support Austria into Rumania in return for Sevastopol 
and destruction of Russia's southern fleet, or, if Austria is under 
pressure from Italy in the west, they will even offer to support Turkey 
into Rumania themselves.  And of course, Austria will ask Germany 
to bounce Russia out of Sweden.  Germany's anti-Russian missives 
to Austria are thus reinforced by Russia's opening move, and the wonder 
is that Russia even occasionally gets Rumania out of this sequence, 
to say nothing of Sweden. Even worse, the Ukraine System 
leaves only a single unit to guard Russia's northern flank; maybe 
England might be persuaded to support Russia into Sweden after Fall 
1901, but it is much more likely that a Russia with only one or no builds 
will tempt England to make a standard early attack on St. Petersburg.  
Enough said.
<p>Unless 
German friendship is guaranteed from the outset, a much better approach 
for Russia is to court diplomatically Austria while opening with A Mos 
– StP, keeping his units spread out. This stands a much 
better chance of gaining Austrian friendship, while putting more strength 
in the important northern sector which is all too likely to be the early 
target of an Anglo-German alliance. Nevertheless, I don't 
think that this improvement will be sufficient if Germany is hostile 
from the outset and has potential allies in England and Turkey.   
So you should be able to see where I'm going with regards to opening 
moves: the <a href="http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/german_attack.htm">German 
Attack</a>.  Germany's 
anti-Russian strategy, as pursued historically by Kaiser Wilhelm II 
and his military planner Helmut von Moltke, was in fact the strategy 
that led Germany to total disaster in 1914-1918. It should 
also lead Germany to disaster on the <b>Diplomacy</b> board as well, but only 
if Russia is able to back up an aggressive anti-German opening with 
sound diplomacy. Without sound diplomatic preparation, an 
anti-German opening will lead the Tsar to an early execution, as also 
happened in history.  The diplomatic preparation and 
the subsequent on-board moves are the subject of the rest of this article.

<br><br>
<h2>Prelude to War: Russo-German Relations</h2>

<p>Russia's 
immediate problem in the opening is to secure at least one build by 
1901, and the most straightforward way to do so is to secure Sweden 
by getting Germany's good will.  So the first country that Russia 
should approach in diplomatic negotiations is Germany.    
And the approach should be as generous and humble as possible, while 
not tipping Russia's hand.  First, Russia guarantees that the 
Baltic, Prussia, and Silesia will remain inviolable DMZ's (Germany 
is of course not told that such a guarantee is only as good as the Kaiser's 
willingness to let Russia have Sweden). Second, no mention 
at all should be made of Germany's Kiel fleet: requests or demands 
that Germany open F Kie - Hol rather than F Kie - Den will only alienate 
the German player.   Third, stress that you are perfectly 
willing to help Germany against England in Scandinavia provided you 
get at least one build in the north and that in the south you have no 
hostile intentions towards Austria. Fourth, the crux of 
the matter: is Germany willing to let Russia's northern fleet into 
Sweden in Fall 1901?
<p>There are only four outcomes to this 
question:
<ol type="a"><li>Germany states that he will let 
you have Sweden (with or without pro-Austrian conditions such as staying 
out of Galicia), and based on your knowledge of the player or his reputation, 
you have good reason to believe that this commitment is genuine.  
Good enough–this is the one case where the Ukraine system (with an 
arranged bounce in Galicia) might be a good opening, though I would 
still prefer A Mos-St.P in order to show that you mean business with 
your offer of alliance against England.<br><br>
<li>Germany states that he will let 
you have Sweden, but you have no previous knowledge of the player and 
therefore no way to tell whether or not his answer is genuine.  
In this case, the German player should be granted the benefit of the 
doubt but Russia should now definitely open with A Mos - StP in order 
to put more force in the north and to make clear to England that taking 
StP won't be easy even if Russia is initially bounced out of Sweden<br><br>
<li>The German player states that 
he will let you have Sweden, but you have good reason to believe that 
his commitment is not credible.  He might already have a 
reputation in your group as a habitual liar, or you have known him to 
bounce Russian out of Sweden in past games for no good reason, or in 
a face-to-face game he immediately goes into a long huddle with England 
while mostly ignoring France.  This means trouble.<br><br>
<li>Germany does not commit to letting 
Russia have Sweden.  Either he refuses outright or he temporizes 
("Let me think about it and get back to you") which puts his commitment 
immediately in doubt even once he says he's reconsidered and is willing 
to let you in.  If this happens, do not worsen the damage by threats, 
or make the German think that you're a weasel by begging for Sweden.  
Simply shrug your shoulders, say "Ok, it was worth a try", and walk 
off.</ol>
<p>The rest of the advice that follows 
assumes that you are faced with cases (c) or (d).   Because 
1901 builds are so essential to Russia due to her wide defensive front, 
either case indicates that Germany is most likely pursuing an anti-Russian 
strategy, and this calls for <i>immediate</i> retaliation even before 
you get bounced out of Sweden.   And retaliation begins not 
with your opening moves, but with a diplomatic strategy calculated to 
make the German player regret he ever messed with his eastern neighbor 
in the current game or even in past games.<br><br>
<h4>Austria: The Southern Ally</h4>


<p>If 
you have strong reason to believe that Germany is hostile, Austria must 
then be your next diplomatic stop, with the aim being to make him an 
active ally (though not against Germany itself). If Russia 
is going to open with an anti-German move, he needs relative security 
on his southern flank, and I simply don't see how this can be accomplished by allying with Turkey.   Any experienced Italian player will realize that a Russo-Turkish alliance is bad news for him, and so he 
will drop whatever he is doing and come to Austria's help.  With 
firm Austro-Italian cooperation, Turkey can be kept out of the key breakthrough 
spaces of Serbia, Greece, and the Ionian, and without the possibility 
for western expansion, he has no options left but to ally with Austria 
against Russia.  Unless one of Austria or Italy is too short-sighted 
to be a strong opponent, Russo-Turkish alliances will usually lead to 
a temporary stalemate in the south that can only be broken against Russia's 
interests.   For this reason, I believe Austria is a much 
better choice for an ally, especially given that in any conflict with 
Germany, you need Austria's neutrality at worst and his good will 
at best.
<p>Which 
makes Russia's approach to Austria clear: move him away from Germany's 
orbit by convincing him that Russia, not Germany, is the key to Austria's 
long term survival. The greatest advantage of this line of argument 
is that it is true. Germany cannot help Austria against 
Turkey; Russia can. Germany has little influence over Italy; 
Russia, as Italy's valuable eastern counterweight, can make Italy 
dance to his tune most of the time. So Russia's approach 
to Austria should be to bend over backwards in order to make Austria 
feel secure.   Open to the Black Sea?  Done.  Occupy 
Rumania in Fall 1901 with a fleet, so as not to threaten Austrian centers?  
Done. Or open to Rumania in Spring 1901, in order to support an Austrian 
army into Bulgaria?  Unless the Turkish player has a penchant for 
opening F Bla-Ank, A Smy-Arm, you should strongly consider it. Your 
main objective with Austria is a working alliance against Turkey where 
he and Italy do most of the work and consequently get most of the Turkish 
centers (this is necessary, as A/R by themselves have only two fleets–insufficient 
to outflank Turkey's position).   Most Austrian players 
will find that giving Rumania to Russia and letting Germany go is easily 
a price worth paying for such an arrangement.

<p>Above 
all, stress to Austria that you are willing to leave Galicia a DMZ by 
not moving there in Fall 1901.  If Austria is open-minded, he will 
rejoice at not having to defend the space and being able to use A Vie 
in order to cover Trieste or Tyrolia while sending his fleet south to 
Albania.   Alas, if Austria is paranoid as so many Austrian 
players have a right to be, he will think "lying weasel!" and then 
move into Galicia after agreeing to keep it empty, or, if he is honest, 
he will ask for a bounce in Galicia.  In the latter case, you are 
better off agreeing, as you do not want him to pass on to Germany that 
Russia's army in Warsaw is headed elsewhere.   Many Austrian 
players might be tempted to see Russia's accommodating stance as a 
sign of weakness.   In order to avert the danger, you then turn 
to Russia's hugely important non-neighbor: Italy.

<h4>Italy: The Southern Counterweight</h4>

<p>What 
Russia needs most from Italy is a commitment to the east.  If Italy 
gives any indication of moving to attack France in the opening, squash 
any thought of that idea by telling France immediately and letting Italy 
know that you have done so.   What you need from Italy is 
an opening that is aggressively oriented to the east but that is flexible 
enough to not commit Italy too early.   For this reason, you 
should firmly discourage Italy from sending <i>both</i> armies north 
in the standard A Rom-Ven and either A Ven-Tyr or A Ven-Tri sequence.   
Telling him that you do not intend to move to Galicia should be enough 
to discourage him from such an immediate attack. Make it 
clear that you intend Austria to be your ally and will not support him 
in any anti-Austrian ventures, so that he is better off opening with 
the A Rom-Apu, F Nap-Ion convoy sequence as a prelude to an attack on 
Turkey. 
<p>Most 
important, however, is Italy's army in Venice. He doesn't 
need it urgently in the opening; you do.  So you need to 
do everything in your power to persuade Italy to open to the key central 
space of Tyrolia.   Sell the move to him in any way that you 
can think of, including the possibility of having you or France help 
him into Munich.  Even if A Ven-Tyr bounces (and you can encourage 
Italy to have an arranged bounce with Austria or Germany if he is the 
cautious type), he will have drawn off one German or Austrian army and 
that is exactly what you need. And if A Ven-Tyr succeeds, an Italian 
army next to Vienna and Trieste is your single best defense against 
an aggressive Austrian move to Galicia.   As to where Italy's 
gains will come from, you need to point him to the yellow menace and 
tell him that both you and Austria will be on his side.   
This should keep him happy.
<h4>Turkey: The Southern Target</h4>

<p>Little 
needs be said here.  If Germany is your enemy, then Turkey is most 
likely to play the role of Germany's southern counterweight, just 
like she did in the 1914-1918 war. Given that you need Austria's 
good will in any conflict with Germany, the Austrian arch-enemy Turkey 
will thus have to be the sacrificial lamb. Negotiations 
with Turkey should be straightforward and you should remain firm: you 
are willing to ally, but you will protect your southern flank by playing 
F Sev - Bla (whether or not you are considering an Austrian proposal 
for F Sev-Rum), and any order of A Smy-Arm will likely see the end of 
cooperation with Russia.

<p>Regardless 
of how Turkey opens, you should prod Austria and Italy in the direction 
of playing their strongest anti-Turkish Spring 1901 moves: A Rom-Apu, 
F Nap-Ion, A Bud-Ser, F Tri-Alb. This will be your strongest 
protection against an anti-Russian Turkish opening.  After this, 
you should be patient and avoid making ineffective moves against Turkey, 
and just wait for the moment that Turkey sends both fleets to fend off 
the Austro-Italians, after which the Black Sea will be yours and Turkey's 
position will sooner or later collapse.
<h4>England: The Northern Ally</h4>

<p>England 
is Russia's most difficult problem, given that England needs both 
Sweden and St. Petersburg's corner position in order to put together 
the necessary stalemate line against the southern powers as well as 
to create his own chances for a solo win.  As such, England is 
likely to try for St. Petersburg at some point in the game.   
It's your job to prevent this possibility, and as usual, the humble 
and subtle approach is best.  Do not bluster or threaten to incite 
France against him if he moves north; this will only ensure that he 
attacks sooner rather than later.   Remember that he too will 
be looking for allies, and if you pass on that Germany will probably 
bounce you out of Sweden and you will therefore assist him against Germany, 
you may be on to a good thing. The usual trick is to let England 
know that you will be moving to the Baltic in Fall 1901 and that he 
might thus succeed in sneaking into Denmark while Germany naively plays 
F Den-Swe. However, since any opening to Silesia or Prussia 
on your part will alert Germany, he is equally likely to play to the 
Baltic, so you will have to try something more long-term.</font> <br>

<p>The 
best approach is to let England know you will not be his enemy and will 
actively help him against the German. This includes the usual 
promises of not building fleets in StP (north coast) and of letting 
him permanently keep Norway, promises which Russia should keep as long 
as Germany is hostile. In addition, Russia should not hesitate 
to offer England support into Denmark once he's into Sweden.   
Russia must at all times stress that a well-played Germany will be a 
hard nut to crack even if England succeeds in eliminating France; the 
sooner that Germany's vital northern flank in Denmark and the Baltic 
can be turned, the better for England.   There is of course, 
the possibility that these arguments will fail to persuade England and 
that he might still lunge for Sweden and St. Petersburg in 1902.  
The best insurance against such aggressiveness, of course, is France.


<h4>France: The Northern Counterweight</h4>

<p>France, 
of course, is Russia's best security against English hostility and 
is even more vital if there is an Anglo-German alliance, so your approach 
should be clear.  Do not give yourself away by inciting him to 
open against England (i.e., to the English Channel), as this will only 
make him suspicious. Instead, tell him that you need a viable 
France in order to protect yourself and that you therefore have his 
best interests at heart. Which makes it easy: the moves 
that keep France safest from his two northern neighbors are the very 
ones that Russia would like to see. Which means you should urge 
France to (a) get at least two builds in 1901 by taking both Portugal 
and Spain, so that his units can immediately head back north instead 
of mucking around in Iberia in 1902, (b) cover Burgundy with at least 
one unit in Spring 1901; even if the French move to Bur bounces, it 
has drawn off Germany's army in Munich and thus filled a vital role 
as far as Russia is concerned, and (c) build at least one fleet, preferably 
in Brest, in order to shield himself against a sudden English takeover 
of the Mid-Atlantic or take advantage of an English northern attack.  
The standard French Burgundy opening, A Par-Bur, F Bre-Mao, A Mar-Spa, 
followed by the build of F Brest and any other unit, is ideal for Russia's 
purposes (the Maginot opening, A Par-Bur, A Mar S A Par-Bur, F Bre-Mao 
is even better as it guarantees that A Par-Bur succeeds, but urging 
this opening might make France suspicious and more likely to inform 
Germany).
<p>The 
key is to keep France's expansion impulses pointed north and east.  
The last thing you want to see as Russia is for France to enter an EFG 
triple alliance where she sends all of her fleets south into the Mediterranean, 
where they are of no use to you at all and also immobilize Italy, an 
ally you desperately need.  If you suspect this is happening, warn 
Italy immediately (and tell France <i>and</i> England about it) and 
then tell England that you will open A Mos-StP and that he will have 
to pry St. Petersburg from your cold dead fingers, while an unsuspecting 
Germany might be an easier victim.  Give it your best shot.


<h2>The German Attack Opening</h2>

<p>The 
moves you choose for Fall 1901, of course, depend on how successful 
you are with the diplomatic initiatives described above.  Suppose 
that the worst happens: Austria says he's going to Galicia, Turkey 
refuses to write off the move to Armenia (to say nothing of the Black 
Sea), Italy doesn't feel like moving to Tyrolia, and England seems 
uninterested in an anti-German alliance.  If this is really 
the case, you are better off going into defensive hedgehog mode: F StP-Bot, 
F Sev-Bla, A War-Gal, and A Mos-St.P (this is Richard Sharp's <a href="http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/god/six.htm">Octopus</a> 
opening, which is also Russia's best defense if he faces both northern 
and southern aggression).   This is the best way of slowing 
down both Turkey's southern offensive and the English push to St. 
Petersburg.  In the north, you then move F Bot-Bal, and choose 
whether to inform England of this depending on your appraisal of the 
player.  In the meantime you can negotiate for Rumania by arguing 
to Austria that you are not interested in attacking him, and your moves 
show this, while pointing out to Turkey that an Austro-Italian attack 
is in the making and that he is aiming his units in the wrong direction.

<p>However, 
this is all too pessimistic.  Chances are that the diplomatic moves 
outlined above have had at least a partial success. France 
says he will play safe by moving to Burgundy and will build an insurance 
fleet in Brest against England. Italy agrees to move to Tyrolia.  
England is receptive to the offer of Denmark, even if he doesn't yet 
fully commit himself. Austria agrees to a DMZ in Galicia, whether 
or not he means it.  You now have enough diplomatic capital 
to make Germany regret he ever considered bouncing you (or any past 
Russian player) out of Sweden.  The opening moves for the 
Russian fleets are straightforward: F StP.-Bot and F Sev-Bla (F Sev-Rum 
should only be considered if Russia is sure Turkey won't open to Armenia; 
such certainty is highly unlikely). 

<p>Army Warsaw's move is the bear's 
bite:<b>A War-Sil. </b>
<p>If this succeeds, two of Germany's home centers are under attack 
and Russia can also consider negotiating to support either Italy's 
army in Tyrolia or France's army in Burgundy into Munich. Or 
Russia can play A Sil-Ber in the Fall, which still costs Germany the 
neutral center in Holland if he does defend Berlin. However, the 
problem with A War-Sil is that it might bounce if Germany is on the 
alert, for example if you've gotten a reputation for opening this 
way as Russia.
<p> In that case you should 
strongly consider the alternative, <b>A War-Pru</b>, which still puts 
pressure on Berlin.  <i>Because it is more likely to succeed 
than A War-Sil, and because it still disarranges Germany's defenses 
in Fall 1901, A War-Pru should be played as often as A War-Sil, if not 
more.</i>  Even if Germany bounces A War-Pru in the Spring, his 
Berlin army is out of position and the army in Munich/Ruhr will not 
be able to both guarantee Munich against French/Italian raids and make 
sure of taking Holland.  A War-Pru also has the slight diplomatic 
advantage that the Russian army is not adjacent to Galicia, making Austria 
feel safer.

<p>If 
the German player reacts in surprise or anger to your move, simply shrug 
your shoulders and say "You didn't give me a credible commitment 
on Sweden, so I had to retaliate by attacking you right off." 
Let's be clear: <i>an anti-German opening by Russia is normally a bad 
move because it almost guarantees that you will get bounced out of Sweden. 
But if you already had good reason to believe that a Swedish bounce 
was in the offing, then you have nothing to lose and German players 
should learn to expect such retaliation. </i></font> <br>
<p>This 
leaves the Moscow army as the reserve unit. Where it goes 
depends on your feel for your neighbors' intentions. If you 
are confident that neither A Vie-Gal nor A Smy-Arm are coming, you can 
order A Mos-St.P in order to put additional pressure on Sweden after 
moving to Finland in Fall 1901, or even A Mos-Lvn or A Mos-War if you 
can be sure England will leave you alone in the north.  Otherwise, 
you should play A Mos-Ukr, where you can defend whichever of Warsaw 
or Sevastopol looks most threatened.<br><br>
<h4>Aftermath of an Attack on Germany</h4>

<p>
If your diplomacy has been good and Austria and Turkey have played
reasonably friendly moves while Germany is caught napping, the board
at the end of Spring 1901 might look as follows:
<p><center><img src="example1.gif"></center>

<p>
Germany's position is a first turn nightmare, with both Berlin and
Munich under attack.  He cannot even be sure that a bounce in Sweden
will be good for him, as he'll be wondering if Russia's fleet will
move to the Baltic while the English North Sea fleet slides into
Denmark.  Even without an English move to Denmark, Germany will be
tempted to cover his Baltic soft spot, which leaves you with a good
Sweden/Baltic guessing game.  More importantly, Rumania is almost
guaranteed for Russia unless Austria and Turkey cooperate just to
bounce you out.  Germany might even abandon Berlin in order to make
sure of Holland, and of course he may also have to write off Munich
provided Italy and France can agree who gets in, with Russia possibly
lending support as well.   In short, Germany's anti-Russian
provocation has been deservedly punished.

<p>Of course, nothing in <b>Diplomacy</b> is guaranteed.   Austria and Turkey
might, for example, play more aggressively, while Germany might cover
himself in Silesia (and you open to Prussia if you suspect this),
leaving the issue a lot more confused.   In that case the end of
Spring 1901 will look like:

<p><center><img src="example2.gif"></center>
<p>Now Russia is under a lot more pressure, but both France and Italy
have come through with pro-Russian moves, so Russia can still hold her
own and might even make progress by getting a build.   Germany still
has to play the Sweden/Baltic guessing game.  The more uncertain he is
(and Russia talking to England makes it worse in a face-to-face game),
the more likely that either F Bot-Swe or F Bot-Bal succeeds.
Psychology is also useful: a safety-minded German player will play to
Sweden in order to make sure of a supply center, while a more
risk-taking German player will move to the Baltic to keep Russia out.
Take your pick.

<p>Further south, the key will be Russia's reading of Austria.  If he
played A Vie-Gal in the spring out of paranoia rather than aggression,
chances are that the Galicia army will scuttle back to cover Vienna
against an Italian move.  But if you read Austria as an aggressive
player anti-Russian player, then you should give Italy the green light
to try for Vienna, and make sure Austria sees this in a face-to-face
game.  It is highly unlikely that Germany will attack Warsaw or
support Austria into Warsaw given the vulnerability of both Munich and
Berlin.  Either A Ukr or (more likely) A Pru should be sufficient to
guard Warsaw (or A Ukr-War, A Pru-War can be played, which also
protects the Ukraine soft spot and leaves Warsaw open for a build).
In the south, you point out to Turkey that a Lepanto attack by Italy
and Austria is in the making, and that if he leaves you alone you will
leave him alone.   And provided Austria is sane, you convince Austria
and Italy that they have much more to gain by uniting their forces
against Turkey: you won't help Turkey and will help them provided that
Austria does not interfere with your move into Rumania, ie F Sev
slides into Rumania, if possible with A Serbia's support, while A Ukr
covers Sevastopol and  A Pru covers Warsaw if you're still uncertain
about Austria.

<p>In the meantime, Germany has to decide which of Berlin, Munich or
Holland he wants to make sure of, and may well get only one or even
zero builds instead of the usual two if he guesses wrong.   Even with
the best outcome for him, Germany will find 1901 a lot more stressful,
even agonizing, than the quiet life he could have had those two turns
if he had guaranteed Sweden for Russia.
<h2>Conclusion: On to Berlin!</h2>

<p>A good Russian player should not take an anti-Russian German
strategy lying down, and any move which denies Russia a needed build
in 1901 is in effect anti-Russian.   If Germany fails to make a
credible commitment to let Russia into Sweden (and it might well
happen that the German could be sincere but still be found
untrustworthy due to his shady past), then Russia must react
immediately.   The first part of this reaction is the diplomatic Bear
Hug: an Austro-Italian-Russian alliance in the south (aimed primarily
against Turkey but also with an eye to Italian raids against Munich
and lack of Austrian cooperation with Germany) combined with an
English alliance in the north, with France opening to Burgundy
regardless of which way she leans, but still pointed northeast.  The
second part is the Bear Bite: an opening of either A War-Sil or A
War-Pru if the Bear Hug has been at least partially successful, with F
Sev covering the Black Sea, F Bot going most (but not all) of the time
to the Baltic in Fall 1901, and A Mos going to either Ukr or St.P as
needed by circumstances.  When more Russian players get in the habit
of opening in this manner, I predict that German players will become
practically religious about promising Sweden to Russian in 1901 and
then keeping that promise.

<p>Needless to say, all of the above strategy makes the vital
assumption that the players are roughly equal in ability and are
reasonably open-minded, which is not always the case.  If both Austria
and Turkey are blindly hostile to Russia, for example, Russia will
have to change his strategy and may well be better off choosing the
Ukraine system and trying to break Austria and Turkey apart in time
enough to get new builds to defend the north.  Also of course, this is
an article on opening strategy.  Russia is unlikely to get further
benefits from an alliance with Austria once Germany and Turkey are
both eliminated, and a good Austrian player will keep this long term
problem in mind.  Similarly, there is still room for peace with
Germany (e.g. if there is a strong E/F alliance) provided that Germany
yields Sweden and Norway to Russia and refrains from further
anti-Russian moves.  In the end there is no guarantee of victory if
Russia reacts against Germany, but if the reaction is properly applied
and also has the good luck of neighbors who are receptive to Russian
proposals, then the finish of a <b>Diplomacy</b> game may well end up
looking more like 1945 than 1917, and that is something a Russian
player should be proud of.
