<p>This time, we hear from one of the variant designers whose work was examined in the Variant Overview column!
<p>As always, we encourage you to write even more. Let us know what parts of the Pouch you like, what we could improve, and what other items you'd like to see. We want your input!<br><br><br>

<p>Greg,
<p>I've just read the National Diplomacy Scholarship article on the new issue
of the Pouch.
<p>Are you aware of the Diplomacy Travel fund? It already exists, and I
believe, has a four-figure amount already in the account, for players who
want assistance with the cost of travelling to Diplomacy conventions.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Mail Received Concerning<BR><A HREF="/Zine/S2007M/Roburn/renaissance.htm">Variant Overview: Renaissance</A> 
</H3>
<HR>
<H4>From Michael Cuffalo(<A HREF="mailto:m_cuffa@yahoo.com">m_cuffa@yahoo.com</A>): 
</H4>
<p>I'm the principal designer of the Renaissance
variant and I just now read your review in the
Spring 2007 Movement Issue of the Zine.
<p>Thank you very much for reviewing the variant! Thank
you also for the positive comments. I'm glad that
people are enjoying it.
<p>FYI I playtested the variant on the Cat23 group a
few times (less than five) and Poland usually did
much better, while often the Ottoman Empire did not
manage to break out of its corner position in time
to rival Venice and HRE. Strangely enough, England
usually did not do nearly as well in my playtests as
in the judge games.
<p>FYI a little history, re: Poland. In the original
version of this variant I had a Russian power in
Moscow, Sev, and StP. But after four or five
playtets resulted in a solo for Russia each time
(coupled with early defeat for HRE) I knew something
was wrong. The solution was to move one of the
centers closer to the action in order to make it a
little more vulnerable to HRE. The playtests of
version II seemed to be successful: Russia/Poland
was no longer dominant but still did reasonably
well.
<p>Actually my main concern initially was that Spain
was too weak due to the spread out nature of its SCs
and also due to heavy competition for the
Meditteranean area, and that was borne out in the
few playtests I had done - though it was arguable
whether this was due to bad luck (Spain usually got
the short end of the stick in terms of player
quality). But I was very pleasantly surprised to see
that it is holding its own on the judge.
<p>BTW: If you're, interested here are some stats on the
playtests I ran on Cat23 for the Renaissance v.2
variant. I do not have info on surviving powers, but
I am pretty sure (though I may be wrong) that in the
first two games Poland finished somewhere in the
middle of the pack:<br><br>
<table border="0"><tr><th>game 1:<td>Venetian solo.
<tr><th>game 2: <td>HRE solo.
<tr><th>game 3: <td>4-way draw: England, France, Poland, Venice.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Well, there you have it. Another Deposits column.
Yep, it sure is.</H3>
