				I stumbled across a YouTube video of Sade's Smooth Operator. The term lends itself quite handily to Diplomacy, of course.
				<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JMMKSa8DBME" target="_blank">Listen as you read.</a> Of course, who needs a reason to listen to this song again?

			<h4>
 				<br>Smooth Operator (with apologies to Sade)
			</h4>
			<div class="italic">
				<br>Diamond smile, dagger eyes,
				<br>Promises made, you watch your hopes fade, and you realize
				<br>You have lost and she's the boss.
				<br>Cutting you out, like gutting trout. You are her floss,
				<br>You do her dirty work, she throws you away.
				<br>"Thanks for your help, you were great.
				<br>Now run along, I've got a game to play."
				<br>
				<br>No need to say,
				<br>She's a smooth operator.
				<br>Smooth operator
				<br>Smooth operator
				<br>Smooth operator
				<br>
				<br>Coast to coast, Baltic to Western Med, she will take.
				<br>North to South, Norway to Africa, she wants it all.
				<br>
				<br>You must fight before it's too late,
				<br>Bottle her up in a stalemate!
				<br>I'm such a fool.
				<br>She's batting her eyelashes, don't be swayed!
				<br>Resist all her advances with all you've got,
				<br>Or you'll wind up like me, thoroughly caught.
				<br>
				<br>I'll fade away,
				<br>She's a smooth operator.
				<br>Smooth operator
				<br>Smooth operator
				<br>Smooth operator
				<br>
				<br>Coast to coast, Baltic to Western Med, she will take.
				<br>North to South, Norway to Africa, she wants it all.
