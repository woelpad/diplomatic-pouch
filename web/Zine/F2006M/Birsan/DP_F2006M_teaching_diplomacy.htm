<b>Players</b>: there are 7 players in the game, one for each of the major powers in Europe in 1901: 

<blockquote>	
England, /France, /Germany, /Italy, /Austria, /Russia and/Turkey.
</blockquote>

<b>Turns are divided</b>: Spring and Fall with the game starting in Spring 1901.
<p>
<b>Players discuss</b> their plans for their pieces privately at the beginning of the Spring and Fall moves.
<p>
<b>You are not bound</b> by anything you say or do with another player.
<p>
<b>Players secretly</b> write down their orders for their pieces and then they are revealed and adjudicated simultaneously.
<p>
<b>Abbreviations</b> in order writing are listed on the conference map with S for Support and C for Convoy.
<p>
<b>When writing a support</b> for a piece to move you have write where the target piece is moving to.
<p>
<b>There is no discussion</b> when players have to retreat or make adjustments to their positions.
<p>
<b>The map</b> is divided into different named spaces (called provinces in the game).
<p>
<b>Provinces</b> can be water or land.  Land provinces may be coastal or inland.
<p>
<b>Split Coasts</b> exist in St. Petersburg, Bulgaria and Spain.  A fleet in those provinces must be on one coast or another.
<p>
<b>There are 34</b> supply centers on the map (stars/dots) scattered in 75 named provinces.
<p>
<b>To win</b> you need 18 supply centers at the end of a Fall move.
<p>
<b>Players start</b> with 3 or 4 supply centers; these are your home centers in one of 7 Great Powers.
<p>
<b>The two piece</b> types are: Army and Fleet.
<p>
<b>For every supply center</b> you own at the end of the Fall you may have one piece on the board.
<p>
<b>If you are short</b> of pieces you build new ones in unoccupied home centers.
<p>
<b>If you have more pieces</b> than supply centers you must reduce your pieces to equal the number of supply centers.
<p>
<b>Each piece has equal strength</b> so it moves with a force of 1 plus 1 for each of its supports.
<p>
<b>An Army may move</b> or give support for another piece to move into or hold an adjacent land .
<p>
<b>A Fleet may move</b> or give support for another piece to move into or hold an adjacent water or coastal land province or convoy an Army to a coastal land province.
<p>
<b>Only one piece</b> may be in a province at any time.
<p>
<b>You may move all</b> or some of your pieces each turn.
<p>
<b>A piece moves only one</b> province at a time to an adjacent province unless you are an Army being convoyed.
<p>
<b>No switching</b>. Units ordered to each other's province do NOT switch positions unless one is being convoyed.
<p>
<b>Your piece may only do <u><i>one</i></u></b> of the following things in any turn:

<ol type="i">
<li><b>MOVE</b>         to an adjacent province or be convoyed from a coastal land province to a coastal land province
       Fleets in split coasts may only move to adjacent coastal land or water provinces.

<li><b>SUPPORT</b>   to defend another adjacent piece in place if you could have moved there and it is not moving.

<li><b>SUPPORT</b>   a specific piece to attack another province that your unit could move to; fleets in split 
                                    coasts may only support moves into a province that they could have moved on.

<li><b>CONVOY</b>   if a fleet at a sea space, you can assist in convoying an army.

<li><b>HOLD</b>         (also called Stand) in place doing nothing.
</ol>
<b></b>When giving support</b> you are adding your force to the mover on, or the holder of, a province.
<p>
<b></b>You may support</b> other people's pieces.
<p>
<b>Bounce: if units of equal support</b> try to move to an unoccupied province then they <b>BOUNCE</b> and no one gets in.
<p>
<b>Supports are CUT</b> by a piece moving on the supporter from other than the province that the support is directed at.  
<p>
<b>To force someone out</b> of a province requires that you have greater force than the piece that is holding the province plus all of its supports to Hold.  A move with one support and a hold with one support bounce. 
<p>
<b>Cut supports</b> do not count for the determination of who has the most force.
<p>
<b>A convoy is a move</b> of an army in one  coastal land province to another by a fleet or a chain of fleets in adjacent water provinces.
<p>
<b>A fleet in a coastal land province may not convoy</b>.
<p>
<b>You cannot dislodge</b> or cut support of one of your own units.  No 'friendly fire'.
<p>
<b>Units forced out</b> of their province are dislodged and must retreat to a vacant adjacent province that it could otherwise legally move to.
<p>
<b>You may not retreat</b> to a province that was the site of a Bounce.
<p>
<b>You may not retreat</b> via a convoy.
<p>
<b>If you cannot retreat</b> or decide not to retreat, the piece is disbanded.
<p>
<b>A piece that is dislodged</b> has no effect on the province from which the mover came that dislodged it.
<p>
<b>A convoying fleet that is dislodged</b> disrupts the convoy and the convoy does not take place.
<p>
<b>Oddities</b>:  Kiel and Constantinople have a single coast due to their waterways (Kiel Canal/Bosphorus).  Denmark connects with Sweden so armies can go between them but the Danish and Swedish coasts are not divided in two. As a coastal land province you may not convoy through Denmark, Kiel or Constantinople.
