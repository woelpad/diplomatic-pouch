				<i>
					<p>Whoever follows Harold on Facebook or elsewhere knows one thing: He loves wordplays. Over the years he has created an impressive collection with which to entertain &mdash; or pester &mdash; his opponents on the <b>Diplomacy</b> board. And he's more than happy to share them with you.</p>
					<p>For your convenience and general education every pun gets attributed to a single Power in the Crowded variant (borders as in 1914 at the outset of WWI) and classified as follows: Great (Power), Neutral (Dot) and Impossible, I mean, Impassable. Is that a pun?</p>
