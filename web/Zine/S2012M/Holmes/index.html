		with Holmes in the cases presented below.
		I would like to strongly encourage my gentle readers to revisit and

<p align="justify">
It was a particularly cold and snowy night in London, and as I entered the
quarters at 221B Baker Street which I share with my good friend Sherlock 
Holmes, I stamped my feet and shook the evening's precipitation from my
trenchcoat before removing it and hanging it upon the hook.  Emerging from 
the foyer and stepping toward the fire to warm my hands, I found my friend
seated at the table, a contented smile upon his face.  "Good evening, 
Holmes," I said.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Indeed it is, Watson," came his reply.  "Pray, come and see what I
have been up to whilst you tended to hangnails and the other assorted 
ailments and complaints of your subscribers."
</p>
<p align="justify">
Rubbing my hands briskly together one final time, I left the fire and took
note of the fact that the cause of Holmes's rather jovial mood was certainly
the Diplomacy set laid 
out on the table before him.  Upon the board stood only a single English army,
planted squarely and proudly upon
the capital of that Great Power which has lately
been the subject of so much press.
<!--
the capital of that most pretentious of Great Powers,
having ambitions matching only those of Great Britain.
-->
I quickly grasped 
something of my friend's afternoon activity, and said, "Holmes! You have been
engaged in a game of Last Man Standing!"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Engaged, yes; but only after the fact, Watson.  What we have here is
indeed the concluding position of a particularly interesting Last Man 
Standing exhibition.  I am delighted to know that you are familiar with
such things; they are admittedly rather frivolous, and a not-inexpensive
diversion for many men."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Certainly I am aware of it, Holmes;
it is presently all the 
rage throughout Europe.  In a Last Man Standing exhibition, 
the exhibitor reduces the number of pieces on the board to one by
reproducing for his audience a game that he has previously concocted,
and whose orders sit in a sealed envelope.
Before replaying the game, it is customary for him to
describe some of its interesting features to his audience, after which
the assembled gentlemen often place wagers amongst themselves concerning
such things as which power will survive, the final position, and any number 
of other events that could transpire as the game is played out.
Obviously, as gentlemen all, every bettor vouches to having never
been made privy to the sealed moves. It is the case, however, as you point
out, that just as often as not a man may be found to be less
interested in the beauty of the Great Game being displayed than he is in
the promise of financial gain to be had through succeeding in these
wagers.
Whilst I have never attended such an exhibition, I do admit that
the idea attracts me &mdash; though I would of course be unable to attend
in any role other than that of a spectator, unless 
the wagers be only for very small
stakes; this separates me, surely, from so many of the game's most ardent
patrons, who, while they may have no more love for The Game than I,
certainly possess much more financial wherewithal!"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Well described, Watson," my friend said.
"Such an exhibition game is, in fact, precisely what we have here.
Are you aware of the
Congress for Permanent Balkan Settlement currently underway in this city?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
The sudden change of subject initially caught me by surprise.
I was indeed &mdash; from coverage provided by <i>The Times</i> &mdash;
familiar
with the fact that
London was presently filled with diplomats from all across the Continent, 
meeting daily at Westminster discussing the future of that troubled part
of Europe. "Most certainly I am aware of the Congress, Holmes," I answered him.  
When Holmes only puffed on his pipe silently, I continued, rather
mystified, launching into a non-sequitur.
"As Fleet Street would tell it,
the present difficulties in debate concern
<!--
the dangerous calls for Serbian autonomy that some fear will
eventually drag the entire Continent to arms,
-->
the bold reassertion by agitators of the Habsburg Empire's claim to
Transylvania."
<!--
, and allegations of interference in the internal affairs of the Bulgars,
and Greeks by
powers having colonial ambitions in Africa, Iberia, and Scandinavia.
It is also said that the representatives from Low Countries are threatening
to depart the conference, believing that their interests are being
ignored by controlling diplomats from the Great Powers."
</p>
<p align="justify">
-->
I paused once again, and Holmes still kept silent. Searching my mind for another
piece of information about the Congress, I was suddenly struck by the reason
for my friend's question.  "By Jove, Holmes! Is this game the
work of the
great Baron Hervé?  Did he visit our apartment to-day whilst I was occupied in
my unpleasant drudgery at the chemist's?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"The great Baron Hervé", as I had referred to him, was of course
Baron Hervé van Rompuy-Leterme, long the toast of the continent,
and certainly among the most well-respected and
talented men of our age.
A universally acclaimed diplomat in the theatre of European politics,
the baron was also one of the foremost Diplomacy players of the past decades.
Some years ago, citing advancing age, he had 
retired both from politics and from the active play of The
Game.
Of late, however, he had become something of an elder statesman,
both on the board and off.
His ardent passion for
peace in the Balkans had proven sufficient to draw him from his retirement and
place him as the presiding officer of the
great Congress now in session, and his passion for The Game had recently seen
him treating Diplomacy clubs all across the continent to exhibitions of his
keen talents in the construction of Last Man Standing games.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Yes and no, Watson," came the reply. "This game is indeed the work of Baron
Hervé, but unfortunately, I have not had the pleasure of his company here
at Baker Street.
It seems, happily, that despite his busy schedule presiding over the Congress,
he has managed to make time to entertain
a number of his fellow delegates, also boarded at the Calhamer Club,
as well as some invited members and guests of the Club,
with his skills.  He has, in fact, brought with him from Brussels
his famously large Diplomacy board."
<p align="justify">
Hearing this, and that Baron Hervé was quartered at our Club, I was delighted.
"So you have been out to the Calhamer Club this afternoon, Holmes?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"No indeed, Watson; I would not presume to venture out in this weather.
<!--
and I was not invited to the exhibition that the baron 
conducted last evening.
-->
The game itself was brought to me, here, earlier to-day, by our friend
Sir Malcolm
Walpole-Price, down from Liverpool for the Congress, who was privileged
to attend the exhibition conducted last evening.
<!-- given last night by Baron Hervé. -->
Sir Malcolm was in excellent
good spirits, for he had (like many of the others in attendance at 
the club) patriotically wagered on England to win.  In fact, Sir Malcolm was
doubly successful, for he also wagered upon the survival of the army 
that begins the game in his home-town of Liverpool, and, indeed, that unit
did become the Last Man Standing,
beating a Russian and a Turk to the pitch, which were the only two other survivors in the final year."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I see, Holmes; it sounds like Sir Malcolm had capital fun."
(I groaned at my own pun, but
Holmes seemed to take no note of it.)  "I wish we had been on-hand for 
it.  If I may ask, were you told which 'marvels' the baron exhibited in last
night's game?
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I was.  For one thing, Watson, this final position was obtained after the
conclusion of only four game-years."
</p>
<p align="justify">
It took a moment for my
face to register the surprise I experienced on hearing that such a thing
could be accomplished.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Noting my delayed reaction, Holmes smiled and continued.
"And that is not all, Watson.  The claim was made 
&mdash; and proven &mdash; that not a single neutral centre would be captured,
and &mdash; most marvelous to the audience, in a game that was to achieve 
its <i>denouement</i> after 1904 &mdash; that every one of the seven Great
Powers would survive into 1903.  Those facts, apart from the information that
the Last Man Standing would be found, as you see here,
sitting upon one of the capitals of the Great Powers
of Europe, which, as Sir Malcolm gleefully added, had itself been eliminated before the start of the final year, amounted to the sum total of the baron's description."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Astonishing, Holmes!  As I see the board here in its final position, I must
presume that Sir Malcolm brought with him the litany of the game's 
moves.  Might I see them, and thus do as you and he did, playing the game out
for my own entertainment and amusement?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
Holmes dismissed my assumption with the wave of his hand.  "I suppose that Sir
Malcolm may have had with him a transcribed copy of the game's orders, he may
even have intended to leave such a copy with me; the subject did not
arise, however, and I did not inquire.  Rather, using the details he 
had provided, I considered it an enjoyable diversion to reproduce for him the
game in its every detail, and that is how I have spent my 
afternoon."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Your skills never cease to amaze me, Holmes!  Simply from the fact that this
sole English army survived, 
ending up in the capital of a power eliminated before the start of the final year, 
when its only remaining opponents were a Russian and a Turk, 
and the three other spare facts you were 
given &mdash; that no neutral centres were taken, that the game reaches this
position before Spring of 1905 is played, and that all powers survive 
into 1903 &mdash; you reconstructed the entire exhibition game?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Quite so, Watson," Holmes said nonchalantly, as if what I had described were
mere child's play.

<p align="justify">
After pulling deeply on his pipe, admiring the near-empty board as he did so,
Holmes continued.  "Were it not for the inclement weather, I would have sent
a boy to you at your offices to suggest that we attend the Calhamer 
Club to-night should you have been able to extricate yourself from your duties
lancing the boils of London,
for Baron Hervé has acceeded to a request to conduct another
presentation 
this evening.  Indeed, Sir Malcolm rushed away from here a mere two hours ago,
concerned that he would arrive there too late to attend the exhibition.
He wished very much to 
join the other Britons there in displaying their pride in country by
betting once again upon His Majesty's armed forces,
just as his fellow delegates to the conference all mean to repeat their own
wagers upon the success of their respective home-nations."
</p>
<p align="justify">
As if on signal, a rap came at the door of our quarters.  Startled that we
would have visitors on such a night, I nevertheless resolved to protect 
our landlady from the freeze in the air.  "I will attend to it, Mrs Hudson," I
called, and stepped to the door.
</p>
<p align="justify">
Opening it, I found there our Liverpudlian friend, the diplomat Sir Malcolm
Walpole-Price, who rushed past me with barely a nod.  "Tragedy, Holmes!  
Tragedy!" he cried, entering the drawing room where Holmes still drew on his
pipe.
</p>
<p align="justify">
In stark contrast to the frantic behaviour of our visitor, Holmes merely said,
"Good evening, Sir Malcolm; it seems from your entrance that England did not
fare so well in this evening's game?  I do trust that your financial
reverses were at least minimal."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"You are correct that the funds I wagered ended the evening in another man's
pocket, but no, Holmes, I am exceedingly distressed to admit that they were not 
minimal; not at all.  I am afraid that they were quite substantial indeed.
And I am far from alone in this my unhappy situation, Holmes.  A great many men
left the Calhamer Club in the same sad state as I, having become bereft of
considerable sums of money.  Oh, Holmes, I feel completely ruined!"
</p>
<p align="justify">
Holmes appeared not to notice what my trained medical eye did: that Sir
Malcolm was quickly throwing himself into a weakened state, overwrought as 
he was, his flushed face hot and sweating, arms flailing about as he paced,
the heat of the fire only adding to the shocks his system had 
experienced, come in as he was so soon and suddenly from the harsh weather.
"Do calm down, Sir Malcolm,"
I tried, "and tell us what transpired."
</p>
<p align="justify">
Sir Malcolm did not, however, calm down, though he did, in panting frantic
breaths, tell us about his misfortune at the Calhamer Club.  "Once 
again, Holmes, Baron Hervé told us that the game would end as quickly as last
evening's game had done &mdash; with the Last Man Standing alone after the 
conclusion of 1904.  My hopes rose immediately for another successful night
like the last!"  He paused, breathless, shaking his head sadly and in 
disbelief, then immediately began pacing again.  "We were then promised that
we would see a convoy move performed during every phase in which any 
fleet were in water, and again, my intended wager upon England seemed all the
more sure &mdash; Britannia Rule the Waves and all that rot, you 
know."
</p>
<p align="justify">
Holmes nodded, and tried to be sympathetic.  "How unfortunate that England did
not come out of 1904 with the sole unit, Sir Malcolm.  You would have been wise
to have wagered to-night only as much as you had won last night, so that you
could not have come out of the two exhibitions less flush than you went in."
</p>
<p align="justify">
Sir Malcolm neither needed nor appreciated the reproach, his face reddening all
the more in shame (if not indignation at Holmes for pointing out the 
error of his ways).  "You are of course correct, Holmes," he sputtered, "but
it is not simply that I bet more upon the English survival than I 
should have; you see, we engaged ourselves in a particular set of
side-bets this
evening &mdash; bets that have left me not only impoverished but quite
astonished at the proven failure of my bets."
</p>
<p align="justify">
I approached our visitor and, clapping my hands upon his shoulders, tried to
drag him to the stuffed chair, but he only threw me off and continued 
pacing, wringing his hands in his agitated state.  "What were the terms of the
side-bets, Sir Malcolm?" inquired Holmes.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Oh, it's just terrible; terrible, Holmes!" came the reply.  "Baron Hervé
announced
that, unlike last evening's game, some number of neutral centres would be
captured, and then some one of our party struck on the idea that we should
bet upon those centres that would and would not come under the control of
one of the Great Powers during the course of such a brief game having the
aim of eliminating every unit save one.
<!--
, and which centres
each Great Power would own, and...oh, Holmes, it's terrible!
-->
I and many others laid much money on what we were certain
were fool's bets being offered us, so positive were we that precious few
neutrals could possibly be captured in such a short game, laying even more
heavily against particular centres that seemed truly unreachable during the
course of the game." As if to himself, he added, "And some of these men,
one in particular, are seemingly quite wealthy; why oh why 
did I wager so much?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
I saw that Sir Malcolm was beyond calming, so I resigned myself to what seemed
our task: to simply allow him to purge the evening's experience from his 
system by telling us of it.  "And how many neutrals were captured, Sir
Malcolm?" I asked.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"When the game finished, Baron Hervé claimed that he had captured
every last neutral centre!" came the response.
</p>
<p align="justify">
At this, Holmes immediately sprung to his feet, his attention suddenly rapt.
"Impossible!  Are you quite sure, Sir Malcolm?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
Our guest was visibly flustered at Holmes's outburst.
"I will take your word that it is impossible, Holmes, and indeed the baron 
had not, in fact, done so.  He
had, only slightly, overstated his accomplishment, and he was quickly corrected.
Would that he had captured them all, however!  It would have meant a slightly
better result for me," he said, shaking his head sadly.
"In fact, Holmes, there was a single neutral centre uncaptured.  Yes, only a
single one.  And this single centre &mdash; alas! &mdash; was one of the
very few that I had bet a considerable sum <u>would</u> be taken!"  Pacing
frenetically now, Sir Malcolm muttered,
You'll forgive me for the state I'm in, gentlemen," and then he rushed on.
"Yes, yes; eleven neutrals were taken &mdash; all of them during the first year &mdash; while we with grand sums of money laid
against any such thing being possible all watched in
horror!... and one, only one, was not.  Even though there were many units skirting it, none ever set foot there, let alone captured it."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Sir Malcolm, you have clearly been under too much tension. At least take off your coat," said I, reaching out to take off his winter coat, but he shrugged me off.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"It doesn't stop there.  
After that first tumultuous year the pieces came streaming back to the same area of the board as the night before,
raising our hopes that we might luck out on the final destination, but alas, ..."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"It was not the same capital?" Holmes helpfully offered, dimly suppressing a smile.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"My good man, it was not even a home center!   And then
&mdash; oh, then, Holmes! &mdash; the terrible costs were accounted!"
</p>
<p align="justify">
His body could take no more of what his mind was putting it through, and Sir
Malcolm collapsed suddenly on the floor of our drawing room, before 
the fire.  I rushed to him, calling to Mrs Hudson for smelling salts, but his
heaving body failed immediately to revive.  Informing Holmes of the 
gravity of Sir Malcolm's condition, I sent for an ambulance, and readied
myself to accompany Sir Malcolm to hospital.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I was surprised to see that Holmes had apparently decided to ride with
us, for he grabbed his deerstalker and began to bundle up against the 
weather.  I protested that he need not travel to the hospital with me, and
that I would manage the care of my sudden patient, whereupon Holmes 
said, "I do not intend to accompany you, Watson.  Rather, I am off to the
Calhamer Club.  Indeed, while you were seeing to our guest, I dispatched
a boy to Scotland Yard to convey to Inspector Lestrade my urgent request that
he join me there, and that he locate and detain the confidence men who mean
to abscond with their ill-gotten gains.  You see, I know which power won
the game, I know where his solitary unit sits, and I am also convinced that I
know which neutral centre remained uncaptured.  I only hope that I might arrive
at the club in time to see the game board, which will go a long way toward
confirming my suspicions."

Holmes's suspicions that Sir Malcolm and the others were
the victims of a sly hustle are correct, of course, and at the Calhamer
Club he will indeed find a particular single unit standing on a particular
space on the Diplomacy board. Is it an army? Is it a fleet? On which space
does it sit? And which Great
Power owns it?  Holmes also is correct about which centre was never taken,
and in fact, the Great Detective can correctly specify the ownership of every
centre on the board.  When you, like Holmes, have reconstructed this
