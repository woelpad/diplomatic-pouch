<p align="justify">
It was a particularly cold and snowy night in London, and as I entered the
quarters at 221B Baker Street which I share with my friend Sherlock 
Holmes, I stamped my feet and shook the evening's precipitation from my
trenchcoat before removing it and hanging it upon the hook.  Emerging from 
the foyer and stepping toward the fire to warm my hands, I found my friend
seated at the table, a contented smile upon his face.  "Good evening, 
Holmes," I said.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Indeed it is, Watson," came my friend's reply.  "Pray, come and see what I
have been up to whilst you tended to hangnails and the other assorted 
ailments and complaints of your subscribers."
</p>
<p align="justify">
Rubbing my hands briskly together one final time, I left the fire and took
note of the fact that the cause of Holmes's rather jovial mood was certainly
the Diplomacy set laid 
out on the table before him.  Upon the board stood only a single English army,
sitting upon the continent.  I quickly grasped 
something of Holmes's afternoon activity, and said, "Holmes! You have been
engaged in a game of Last Man Standing!"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Engaged, yes; but not as one of the players, Watson.  What we have here is
indeed the concluding position of a particularly interesting Last Man 
Standing game.  I am delighted to know that you are familiar with the variant;
it is rather frivolous, and a not-inexpensive mode of play."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Certainly I am aware of it, Holmes."  As if proof were needed, I
proceeded to explain what I knew of the variant, which was lately all the 
rage not only across Europe but at our own favourite venue, the Calhamer Club.
"Last Man Standing is a game wherein the players are certainly 
motivated not only by the joy of the Great Game, but by financial gain.
While I have never played the game, even for small stakes, I understand 
that it is, at its root, a betting game.  The seven players each provide an
equal share into a pot, held by the Game Master, and awarded at the 
conclusion of the game to whichever player owns the sole remaining unit on the
board.  Throughout the game, players actively arrange for the 
dislodgement of their own units &mdash; orders for the accomplishment of
which are usually secured by the further
transfer of money from one party to another &mdash; so that such units 
might be disbanded rather than retreated, and the players almost invariably
waive any builds to which they are entitled.  In additon to the collective
ante making up the pot to be awarded at the end of the game, and to the
constant selling of one's orders to other players, any number of
side-bets are usually entertained.  As I understand it, Last Man Standing
provides, Holmes, great sport indeed
for those of the upper-classes having the wherewithal to properly enjoy such
a wagering game."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Quite right, Watson.  As you also certainly know, Last Man Standing games
rarely achieve the coveted final position, more often than not ending 
by agreement, with the financial stakes divided among the survivors.  A game,
such as this one" &mdash; Holmes gestured with his pipe to the board 
before him &mdash; "which reaches its stated aim such that only a single unit
remains is rarely seen, except as an exhibition or academic 
exercise.  This, in fact, is precisely what we have here.  Are you aware of the
Congress for Permanent Balkan Settlement currently underway in this city?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
From coverage provided by
<i>The Times</i>,
I was indeed familiar
with the fact that
London was presently filled with diplomats from all across Europe, 
meeting daily at Westminster discussing the future of that troubled part
of Europe. "Certainly I am, Holmes," I answered, "As Fleet Street would tell
it,
the present difficulties in debate concern
the dangerous calls for Serbian autonomy that some fear will
eventually drag the entire Continent to arms,
the bold reassertion by agitators of the Habsburg Empire's claim to
Transylvania,
and allegations of interference in the internal affairs of the Bulgars,
and Greeks by
powers having colonial ambitions in Africa, Iberia, and Scandinavia.
It is also said that the representatives from Low Countries are threatening
to depart the conference, believing that their interests are being
ignored by controlling diplomats from the Great Powers."
</p>
<p align="justify">
 Holmes
continued, "As you can imagine, Watson, such a congregation of 
politicians and statesmen necessarily brings any number of vendors and showmen
along with it, all with the aims of relieving some of these 
statesmen from the burden of carrying a weighty pocketbook augmented by
the generous travel <i>per diem</i> to which they are allowed by their
home nations.  This game is the concoction of just such 
a showman, a rather clever chap, if I do say so."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"A Last Man Standing <i><u>showman</u></i>, Holmes?" I asked.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Precisely so.  One of many such barnstormers traveling throughout Britain and
Europe to-day.  This particular fellow, it seems,
has brought his talents here and has found a ready and
grateful audience at our very own Calhamer Club, which is hosting frequent
games of Diplomacy between the visiting statesmen of Europe."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"So you have been out to the Calhamer Club this afternoon," I concluded, but
was corrected.
</p>
<p align="justify">
"No indeed, Watson; I would not presume to venture out in this weather.  This
game was brought to me, here, earlier today, by one of its players."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Players, Holmes? I thought you said this was an exhibition game."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"And indeed it is, but this particular fellow chooses to engage his audience in
his presentation, allowing them to participate by &mdash; as Last 
Man Standing players are so wont to do &mdash; betting on the outcome as he
proceeds through it.  It was one of our very own British diplomats, 
our Liverpudlian acquaintance Sir Malcolm Walpole-Price, who was at the
Calhamer Club for last night's exhibition, and who had then wagered 
on the game that is now reflected here.  Sir Malcolm was in excellent
good spirits, for he had (like many of the others in attendance at 
the club) patriotically wagered on England to win.  In fact, Sir Malcolm was
doubly successful, for he also wagered upon the survival of the army 
that begins the game in his home-town of Liverpool, and, indeed, that unit
did become the Last Man Standing."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I am afraid I do not understand the concept of betting on an exhibition,
Holmes.  Could the exhibitor simply not manipulate the game, as he plays 
it out, so as to arrange any particular outcome?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"No, Watson; you see, the moves to be exhibited were sealed in an envelope
before the exhibitor described the marvels of the game that he would 
reproduce.  Only then, with such details about the game provided, and the
interest in witnessing the skills of the exhibitor thus raised to a fever
pitch, does the betting 
begin.  Obviously, as gentlemen all, every bettor vouches to having never
been made privy to the sealed moves; indeed, the exhibitor from the Continent
professed to be a complete stranger to all assembled at the
Club last night."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I see, Holmes; it sounds like capital fun." (I groaned at my own pun, but
Holmes seemed to take no note of it.)  "I wish we had been on-hand for 
it.  You say that the game contains 'marvels' that prove the exhibitor's
skills and talent?  I assume you were made familiar with those of this 
particular game?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"I was.  For one thing, Watson, this final position was obtained after the
conclusion of only four game-years."  It took only a moment before my 
face slowly registered the surprise I felt on hearing that such a thing
could be accomplished.  "And that is not all, Watson.  The claim was made 
&mdash; and proven &mdash; that not a single neutral centre would be captured,
and &mdash; most marvelous to the audience, in a game that was to achieve 
its <i>denouement</i> after 1904 &mdash; that every one of the seven Great
Powers would survive into 1903."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Astonishing, Holmes!  As I see the board here in its final position, I must
presume that Sir Malcolm brought with him the litany of the game's 
moves.  Might I see them, and thus do as you and he did, playing the game out
for my own entertainment and amusement?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
Holmes dismissed my assumption with the wave of his hand.  "I suppose that Sir
Malcolm may have had with him a transcribed copy of the game's orders, he may
even have intended to leave such a copy with me; the subject did not
arise, however, and I did not inquire.  Rather, using the details he 
had provided, I considered it an enjoyable diversion to reproduce for him the
game in its every detail, and that is how I have spent my 
afternoon."
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Your skills never cease to amaze me, Holmes!  Simply from the fact that this
sole English army survived, and the three other spare facts you were 
given &mdash; that no neutral centres were taken, that the game reaches this
position before Spring of 1905 is played, and that all powers survive 
into 1903 &mdash; you reconstructed the entire exhibition game?"
</p>
<p align="justify">
"Quite so, Watson," Holmes said nonchalantly, as if what I had described were
mere child's play.

"Were it not for the inclement weather, I would have sent
a boy to you at your offices to suggest that we attend the Calhamer 
Club to-night should you have been able to extricate yourself from your duties
lancing the boils of London.
For, you see, the same exhibitor was scheduled to conduct another presentation 
this evening.  Indeed, Sir Malcolm rushed away from here a mere two hours ago,
concerned that he would arrive there tardy.  He wished very much to 
repeat his pride in country by betting once again upon His Majesty's army."
</p>
<p align=justify>
As if on signal, a rap came at the door of our quarters.  Startled that we
would have visitors on such a night, I nevertheless resolved to protect 
our landlady from the freeze in the air.  "I will attend to it, Mrs Hudson," I
called, and stepped to the door.
</p>
<p align=justify>
Opening it, I found there the diplomat from Liverpool, Sir Malcolm
Walpole-Price, who rushed past me with barely a nod.  "Tragedy, Holmes!  
Tragedy!" he cried, entering the drawing room where Holmes still drew on his
pipe.
</p>
<p align=justify>
In stark contrast to the frantic behaviour of our visitor, Holmes merely said,
"Good evening, Sir Malcolm; it seems from your entrance that England did not
fare so well in this evening's game?  I do trust that your financial
reverses were at least minimal."
</p>
<p align=justify>
"You are correct that the funds I wagered ended the evening in another man's
pocket, but no, Holmes, I am exceedingly distressed to admit that they were not 
minimal; not at all.  I am afraid that they were quite substantial indeed.
And I am far from alone in this my unhappy situation, Holmes.  A great many men
left the Calhamer Club in the same sad state as I, having become bereft of
considerable sums of money.  Oh, Holmes, I feel completely ruined!"
</p>
<p align=justify>
Holmes appeared not to notice what my trained medical eye did: that Sir
Malcolm was quickly throwing himself into a weakened state, overwrought as 
he was, his flushed face hot and sweating, arms flailing about as he paced,
the warmth from the fire only adding to the shocks his system had 
experienced, in so soon from the freezing wind.  "Do calm down, Sir Malcolm,"
I tried, "and tell us what transpired."
</p>
<p align=justify>
Sir Malcolm did not, however, calm down, though he did, in panting frantic
breaths, tell us about his misfortune at the Calhamer Club.  "Once 
again, Holmes, we were told that the game would end as quickly as last
evening's game had done &mdash; with the Last Man Standing alone after the 
conclusion of 1904.  My hopes rose immediately for another successful night
like the last!"  He paused, breathless, shaking his head sadly and in 
disbelief, then immediately began pacing again.  "We were then promised that
we would see a convoy move performed during every phase in which any 
fleet were in water, and again, my intended wager upon England seemed all the
more sure &mdash; Britannia Rule the Waves and all that rot, you 
know."
</p>
<p align=justify>
Holmes nodded, and tried to be sympathetic.  "How unfortunate that England did
not come out of 1904 with the sole unit, Sir Malcolm.  You would have been wise
to have wagered tonight only as much as you had won last night, so that you
could not have come out of the two exhibitions less flush than you went in."
</p>
<p align=justify>
Sir Malcolm neither needed nor appreciated the reproach, his face reddening all
the more in shame (if not indignation at Holmes for pointing out the 
error of his ways).  "You are of course correct, Holmes," he sputtered, "but
it is not simply that I bet more upon the English survival than I 
should have; you see, the exhibitor also encouraged a particular set of
side-bets this
evening &mdash; one that has left me not only impoverished but quite
astonished at the proven failure of my bets."
</p>
<p align=justify>
I approached our visitor and, clapping my hands upon his shoulders, tried to
drag him to the stuffed chair, but he only threw me off and continued 
pacing, wringing his hands in his agitated state.  "What were the terms of the
side-bets, Sir Malcolm?" inquired Holmes.
</p>
<p align=justify>
"Oh, it's just terrible; terrible, Holmes!" came the reply.  "We were told
that, unlike last evening's game, some number of neutral centres would be
captured, and we were set to the task of betting upon those that would and
would not come under the control of one of the Great Powers during the course
of the brief game.  I and many others laid much money on what we were certain
were fool's bets being offered us, so positive were we that precious few
neutrals could possibly be captured in such a short game, laying even more
heavily against particular centres that seemed truly unreachable during the
course of the game." As if to himself, he added, "And some of these men,
one in particular, are seemingly quite wealthy; why oh why 
did I wager so much?"
</p>
<p align=justify>
I saw that Sir Malcolm was beyond calming, so I resigned myself to what seemed
our task: to simply allow him to purge the evening's experience from his 
system by telling us of it.  "And how many neutrals were captured, Sir
Malcolm?" I asked.
</p>
<p align=justify>
"When the game finished, the exhibitor claimed that he had captured
every last neutral centre!" came the response.
</p>
<p align=justify>
At this, Holmes immediately sprung to his feet, his attention suddenly rapt.
"Impossible!  Are you quite sure, Sir Malcolm?"
</p>
<p align=justify>
Our guest was visibly flustered at Holmes's outburst.
"I will take your word that it is impossible, Holmes, and indeed the exhibitor
had not, in fact, done so.  He
had, only slightly, overstated his accomplishment, and he was quickly corrected.
Would that he had captured them all, however!  It would have meant a slightly
better result for me," he said, shaking his head sadly.
"In fact, Holmes, there was a single neutral centre uncaptured.  Yes, only a
single one.  And this single centre &mdash; alas! &mdash; was one of the
very few that I had bet a considerable sum <u>would</u> be taken!"  Pacing
frenetically now, Sir Malcolm muttered,
You'll forgive me for the state I'm in, gentlemen," and then he rushed on.
"Yes, yes; eleven neutrals were taken...while we with grand sums of money laid
against any such thing being possible all watched in
horror!...and one, only one, was not.  And then
&mdash; oh, then, Holmes! &mdash; the terrible costs were accounted!"
</p>
<p align=justify>
His body could take no more of what his mind was putting it through, and Sir
Malcolm collapsed suddenly on the floor of our drawing room, before 
the fire.  I rushed to him, calling to Mrs Hudson for smelling salts, but his
heaving body failed immediately to revive.  Informing Holmes of the 
gravity of Sir Malcolm's condition, I sent for an ambulance, and readied
myself to accompany Sir Malcolm to hospital.
</p>
<p align=justify>
I was surprised to see that Holmes had apparently decided to ride with
us, for he grabbed his deerstalker and began to bundle up against the 
weather.  I protested that he need not travel to the hospital with me, and
that I would manage the care of my sudden patient, whereupon Holmes 
said, "I do not intend to accompany you, Watson.  Rather, I am off to the
Calhamer Club.  Indeed, while you were seeing to our guest, I dispatched
a boy to Scotland Yard to convey to Inspector Lestrade my urgent request that
he join me there, and that he locate and detain the confidence men who mean
to abscond with their ill-gotten gains.  You see, I know which power won
the game, I know where his solitary unit sits, and I am also convinced that I
know which neutral centre remained uncaptured.  I only hope that I might arrive
at the club in time to see the game board, which will go a long way toward
confirming my suspicions."

<b>	<i>	Holmes's suspicions that Sir Malcolm and the others were
