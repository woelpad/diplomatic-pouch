<p>I am the judge keeper for <a href="http://usak.asciiking.com/about.html">USAK</a>, and I moderate the house games on that
judge. This article is my opinion, although I write much as if it were
fact. I am also a security advocate in the judge community and a play
by post player.</p>

<p>The proper goal of security in an on-line game is not to create an
impenetrable fortress to deny cheaters entrance. That would be
impossible. It is possible, however, to create a reasonably safe
environment for play. This process begins with a threat assessment and
uses that information to implement relevant security measures.</p>

<p>Duplicate position cheating is a real threat, but one that can be
handled. Servers already track the addresses used to access the game
and report to the administrators when players make mistakes and post
orders from the wrong account or use the same computer.</p>

<p>Collusion, in the form of friends and family joining a public game, is
indistinguishable from duplicate position cheating in most cases. It
is caught and punished in the same way on most servers.</p>

<p>The above forms of cheating usually happen in novice games, which
gives some credence to the perpetrators' claims that they did not know
or understand the rules.</p>

<p>The most common form of accusation, however, is collusion among
unrelated players. This can rarely be proven, but can often be
disproved. It is rare in practice, certainly hard to notice, but the
payoff is so small compared to the risk of a permanent ban such that
it is believable this form of collusion might be as rare as it seems.
My own approach to this problem is to examine the press (or signals in
no press games) and to lower the ban hammer if I cannot disprove the
allegation. So far, I have zero bans for this reason in seven
accusations among nearly 300 games I have recently moderated.</p>

<p>Eliminating duplicates requires more draconian measures, steps that I
am willing to take as an administrator. For the US, it is possible to
confirm physical addresses to a certain level and to follow that by
limiting play in one game to those who do not live close enough to be
the same person. This breaks down some overseas, but there is still
the option to limit a game to one UK player, for example. The severe
part of the security measures are when it comes to enforcing a ban.</p>

<p>Enforcing a ban means blocking all registrations that look like they
came from the same computer, now and for the foreseeable future.
Practically speaking, that means blocking a network address lasts 1 to
6 months. That's not long, but hopefully long enough for the cheater
to move on to a different hobby.</p>
