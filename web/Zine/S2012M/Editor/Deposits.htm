<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Mail Received Concerning<BR>Diplomacy Openings Listed On The Pouch!
</H3>
<HR>
<H4>From List Magazine (<A HREF="mailto:listzine@gmail.com">listzine@gmail.com</A>):</H4>
<p>Dear DP Council,</p>
<p>Hello from a small corner of the internet known as List Magazine.</p>
<p>I'm pleased to share we've just published a list of "10 Debonair Openings from the Board Game Diplomacy," by Racan Souiedan.</p>
<p><b><a href="http://listmagazine.org/opening-moves-from-diplomacy.html">http://listmagazine.org/opening-moves-from-diplomacy.html</a></b></p>
<p>Each of the entries links to your database at the Diplomatic Pouch, and you are credited with a link in the footnote. I'm sure these moves are all well known to you, but our list may raise a few eyebrows among those who have not heard of Diplomacy and attract a few new players to the game.</p>
<p>I thought you might like to see this, and perhaps would like to share with friends and followers.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>@listmagazine</p>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Mail Received Concerning<BR><A HREF="/Zine/S1998R/Nichols/ratings2.html">A Player Rating System for Diplomacy</A>
</H3>
<HR>
<H4>From J&#233;r&#233mie LeFran&#231;ois (<A HREF="mailto:jeremie.lefrancois@gmail.com">jeremie.lefrancois@gmail.com</A>):</H4>
<p>Hi!</p>
<p>I am the webmaset of the <a href="http://www.stabbeurfou.org/">www.stabbeurfou.org</a> web site dedicated to playing <b>Diplomacy</b> (automated in French and in English).
Have you heard about it?</p>
<p>I have implemented EXACTLY the  "A Player Rating System for Diplomacy
from the article in the DipPouch.</p>
<p>I have duplicated the article on the stabberfou site without changing a comma, here:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://www.stabbeurfou.org/docs/articles/en/DP_S1998R_Diplomacys_New_Rating_System.html">http://www.stabbeurfou.org/docs/articles/en/DP_S1998R_Diplomacys_New_Rating_System.html</a></b></p>
<p>I do not find exactly the same results as in your example, but I will soon make more detailed tests to find out why, and try to get closer
This allow me to have a list of what I call " the most skilled players".</p>
<p>If you have a revised version or any comments I will take them.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the work, it helps the community, it helps the stabbeurfou players, it helped me.</p>
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's Response:</b> Merci beaucoup, J&#233;r&#233mie! Je suis tr&#232;s content. I'm glad you've implemented the rating system, and that you're happy with the results. And I do know about your site - it's certainly the premier French language site in our hobby. Thanks for writing!</i></blockquote>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Mail Received Concerning<BR>A Black and White Diplomacy Map
</H3>
<HR>
<H4>From Jeff Kaufman (<A HREF="mailto:jeff@alum.swarthmore.edu">jeff@alum.swarthmore.edu</A>):</H4>
<p>I went to the page:</p>
<p><b><a href="/Online/maps.html">/Online/maps.html</a></b></p>
<p>Expecting to be able to find a detailed black and white map that I could print out.  I didn't find one, but I did find a scan of a conference map on an abandoned forum:</p>
<p><b><a href="http://sccs.swarthmore.edu/%7Ecbr/diplomacy-conference-map.jpg">http://sccs.swarthmore.edu/~cbr/diplomacy-conference-map.jpg</a></b></p>
<p>Is this something you could add to your page?</p>
<blockquote><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> In response, Nicholas Fitzpatrick was kind enough to offer a link to this other example of a black and white map: <a href="http://www.sentex.ca/%7Enfitz/Maps/standard.pdf">http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/Maps/standard.pdf</a>.</i></blockquote>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER>Mail Received Concerning<BR><A HREF="/Zine/S2010M/Wiens/sailho.htm">Thought on Game Balance in No-Press SailHo</A>
</H3>
<HR>
<H4>From Manus Hand (<A HREF="mailto:manus@manushand.com">manus@manushand.com</A>):</H4>
<p>John:</p>
<p>I just wanted to say that your article on the balance of <b>Sail Ho!</b> was truly well-done!  As someone who has played the variant, I have often thought that South has an advantage, but never stopped to analyze it deeper, especially because, well, I've played South more often than not.  <img src="/Zine/Common/smiley.gif"/></p>
<p>I truly enjoyed your article, and would be very interested if you would follow it &#8212; either as another article or in a continuation of this correspondence &#8212; with any suggestions you might have concerning changes to the variant that might shift the balance.</p>
<p>Stab you soon,</p>
<p>Manus</p>

Yep, it sure is.</H3>
