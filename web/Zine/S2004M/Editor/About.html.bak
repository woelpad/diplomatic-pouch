		Hello, and welcome to the 2004 Spring Movement of the Diplomatic Pouch.  
		What!?! The Pouch? Yes, we are back, and in the honor of never having 
		NMR's for a movement phase, this edition is the spring movement.  This 
		edition will also have the unique feel of two editors.  This hopefully will 
		allow us to continue this great project in a more timely fashion. 
		<br>
	</p>
	
	<p align="justify">
		So, great, you now have a monkey who once given some food will hit random 
		keys hoping some form of intelligent thought comes out of him.  
		First; a bit about this monkey, I like Bananas, but with peanut butter, 
		and no skins.  I have also been stabbed and have stabbed people repeatedly 
		for the last 13 years or so.  And have enjoyed everything that this hobby 
		has given me.  With great awe I used all the resources that people have 
		created to make this hobby what it is today.  A great global community that 
		reaches right around this world of ours.  I thought that it was time to 
		give back, and the fact that winter is fast approaching in Ontario and 
		I will have months and months of hibernation and will therefore be able to 
		dedicate the time and energy needed for this endeavor. 
		<br>
	</p>
	
	<p align="justify">
		We also have another monkey who has been given food in return for tricks 
		doing most of the editing.  With his large vocabulary of "oooh" and  
		"eeeeh" this pouch will be grammar free in no time.  His best trick is 
		using a fountain pen with his tail.  Just don't get too close to the 
		bars, he likes to shoot ink at spectators. <i><b>Second Monkey's note:</b> I don't 
		like bananas, but but a hot cup of coffee to keep me stimulated would be nice...</i>
		<br>
	</p>
	
	
	<p align="justify">
		Now that you know a little bit about the monkeys, please feel free to 
		drop them some scraps...letters, articles, peanut butter, articles...and 
		did I mention articles?  When I started this hobby, I was in awe of these 
		people who had this vast knowledge about the game and would get articles 
		published, and I thought "wow I could never do that."  Now, I'm a Co-editor! 
		What I am saying is that even if you are playing in your first game, write an 
		article.  I would especially love if newcomers to the game would submit an 
		article on how it was to play in their first game. 
		<br>
	</p>

	<p align="justify">
		<i><b>Second Monkey's note:</b> I only started playing Diplomacy recently, but got hooked 
		on it right away. When I saw that the Pouch, my favorite place to go for a little 
		light Dip reading, hadn't gotten an issue out for quite some time, I contacted Manus 
		(through some kind soul whose name escapes me at the moment), and asked if I could be 
		of service. He said he already had this "Scott" guy on the job, but he was sure Scott 
		would love an extra hand. I got in touch with the First Monkey, found out that he had 
		what I didn't (computer skills), and I had what he didn't (extra time to edit), and 
		we paired up. And in the next many articles, you will find the fruits of our 
		programming and editing labors, as well as the hard work of many Diplomatic authors. 
		Thanks to all those who submitted articles, hope you enjoy this issue of the Pouch.</i>
	</p>

	
	<p align="justify">
		Well, now that I have the obligatory whining for articles out of the way, 
		sit back and enjoy.   We have a great line-up for you all starting with David 
		Cohen's third article on the Maharajah variant.  He shows very good insight 
		into what goes into making a viable variant.  Actually we have 3 variant articles 
		this time, with one focusing on how the variant has been improved on the nJudges.
		Before the DPjudge, the only option was to play (with a computer moderator) on 
		the nJudges, where I got my start.  Segio shows that those judges are still 
		the core of online diplomacy and enlightens us with the enhancements to 
		that system with regard to the Machiavelli variant.
		<br>
	</p>

	<p align="justify">
		Sherlock Holmes is back again with his solution to another of the Sultan's 
		notes.  Not to be outdone, our very own co-editor Randy Lawrence dips his 
		quill to ink and pens a fine article about Balkan negotiations.  And with 
		"Peloponnesian Wars", another variant takes us thought the paces using India 
		as the basis for this variant. My favourite article is from Mr. 
		Tomlinson--"Those who can, teach", as he treats us to a wonderful concept 
		to help new people in our community.  We also have a little treat, Eva has
		thrown together some "lost" Beatles* songs that they made when they were playing 
		Dip.  
		<br>
	</p>

	<p align="justify">
		One last thing.  Alain Tésio is a name a lot of you might not know.  But he is
		responsible for floc.net and creating the automatic maps that we have all come to rely on.
		For those of us who remember having that real board sitting at home set or those
		pieces of paper laying around with lines all over the place, we all thank you. 
		For those who are new to this and get the see the benefits instantly, it's good
		to take a step back once in a while and go "Wow, look at all the things Alain
		and others have done and <b>shared</b> with us, just because they love the game.
