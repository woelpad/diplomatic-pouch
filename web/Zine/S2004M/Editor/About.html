<b>We're Back, For The First Time</b>
<p align="justify"> Hello, and welcome to the 2004 Spring Movement issue of The
Diplomatic Pouch Zine. What!?! The Pouch Zine? Yes, we are back,
and in honor
of never NMR'ing for a movement phase, this edition is the Spring
Movement. This issue is also the first to have the unique feel of
two editors.
This will hopefully allow us to continue this great project in a more
timely fashion.</p>
<p align="justify"> So, great, you now have a monkey who, once given some
food will hit random keys hoping some form of intelligent thought comes
out of him. First; a bit about this monkey, I like bananas, but with
peanut butter, and no skins. I have also been stabbed and have stabbed
people repeatedly for the last 13 years or so. And have enjoyed everything
that this hobby has given me. With great awe I used all the resources
that people have created to make this hobby what it is today. A great
global community that reaches right around this world of ours. I thought
that it was time to give back, and the fact that winter is fast approaching
in Ontario and I will have months and months of hibernation and will
therefore be able to dedicate the time and energy needed for this endeavor helps too.</p>
<p align="justify"> We also have another monkey who has been given food
in return for his tricks doing most of the editing. With his large vocabulary
of "oooh" and "eeeeh," this Pouch will be grammar-free in no time. His
best trick is using a fountain pen with his tail. Just don't get too
close to the bars, he likes to shoot ink at spectators. <i><b>Second
Monkey's note:</b> I don't like bananas, but but a hot cup of coffee
to keep me stimulated would be nice...</i> </p>
<p align="justify">Now that you know a little bit about the monkeys, please
feel free to drop them some scraps...letters, articles, peanut butter,
articles...and did I mention articles? When I started this hobby, I
was in awe of these people who had this vast knowledge about the game
and would get articles published, and I thought "wow, I could never do
that." Now, I'm a co-editor! What I am saying is that even if you are
playing in your first game, write an article. I would especially love
if newcomers to the game would submit an article on how it was to play
in their first game.</p>
<p align="justify">
<i><b>Second Monkey's note:</b> I only started playing Diplomacy recently, but got hooked
on it right away. When I saw that The Pouch, my favorite place to go for a little
light Dip reading, hadn't gotten an issue out for quite some time, I contacted Manus
(through some kind soul whose name escapes me at the moment), and asked if I could be
of service. Manus tearfully told me that The Zine had been editorless
since Edward Hawthorne's departure,
and that he himself was unable to return to the Zine editor job
since he was so busy in the DPjudge section of The Pouch.
The happy news, though, was that I was not the only concerned
guy out there.
Manus said he already had this "Scott" guy on the job,
but that he was sure Scott
would love an extra hand. I got in touch with the First Monkey, found out that he had
what I didn't (computer skills), and I had what he didn't (extra time to edit), and
we paired up. And in the next many articles, you will find the fruits of our
programming and editing labors, as well as the hard work of many Diplomatic authors.
Thanks to all those who submitted articles, hope you enjoy this issue of The Pouch.</i>
</p>
<p align="justify"> Well, now that I have the obligatory whining for articles
out of the way, sit back and enjoy. We have a great line-up for you
all starting with David Cohen's third article on the Maharajah variant.
He shows very good insight into what goes into making a viable variant.
Actually we have three variant articles this time, with one focusing on
how the variant has been improved on the nJudges. Before the DPjudge,
the only option was to play (with a computer moderator) on the nJudges,
where I got my start. Sergio shows that those judges are still the core
of online diplomacy and enlightens us with the enhancements to that
system with regard to the Machiavelli variant. </p>
<p align="justify"> Sherlock Holmes is back again with his solution to
another of the Sultan's notes. Not to be outdone, our very own co-editor
Randy Lawrence dips his quill to ink and pens a fine article about Balkan
negotiations. And with "Peloponnesian Wars," another variant takes us
through the paces, using India as the basis for this variant. My favorite
article is from Mr. Tomlinson -- "Those Who Can, Teach" -- as he treats
us to a wonderful concept to help new people in our community. We also
have a little treat: Eva has thrown together some "lost" Beatles songs
that they wrote while they were playing Dip. </p>
<p align="justify">One last thing. Alain TÃ©sio is a name a lot of you
might not know. But he is responsible for floc.net and creating the
automatic maps that we have all come to rely on. For those of us who
remember having that real board sitting at home, or those pieces of
paper laying around with lines all over the place, we thank you. For
those who are new to this and get the see the benefits instantly, it's
good to take a step back once in a while and go, "Wow, look at all the
things Alain and others have done and <b>shared</b> with us, just because
they love The Game.</p>
<b>Breaking Hobby News</b>
<p align="justify">It was with a heavy heart that the hobby received word
of Buz Eddy's intention to retire his post as leader of the North American
Diplomacy Federation so that he can spend more time with his family.
Buz's steady leadership will be missed not only on the North American
continent but worldwide. We at The Pouch express the thoughts of the
entire Diplomacy world when we thank Buz for his tremendous contributions
to grow, strengthen, and further the state of the Diplomacy hobby in
North America. The DP Council stands ready to support the incoming NADF
leadership in attempting to fill the large shoes that Buz is stepping
out of, and we intend to dedicate the next issue of The Pouch 'Zine
to Buz Eddy, founder and now past president of the NADF.<br>
