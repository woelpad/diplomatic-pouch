			<i>'Hellenes, ye must guard the pass by Olympos, in order that both Thessaly and 
			the whole of Hellas may be sheltered from the war. We are prepared to join with 
			you in guarding it, but ye must send a large force as well as we; for if ye shall 
			not send, be assured that we shall make an agreement with the Persian; since it is 
			not right that we, standing as outposts so far in advance of the rest of Hellas, should 
			perish alone in your defense: and not being willing to come to our help, ye cannot apply 
			to us any force to compel inability; but we shall endeavor to devise some means of safety 
			for ourselves.'</i>  
			<br>
      			<br>
      			Is this a final and desperate PRESS FROM THESSALIA TO BOEOTIA, ATHENS AND SPARTA ? 
      			A BROADCAST GREY made by the Persian, intended to confuse people ? No. These are 
      			Thessalians representatives' words delivered to Greek cities' delegations, called 
      			together on Corinth's Isthmus in 480 BC to face up to Persian threat. (Reported by 
      			Herodotus in his History, VII, CLXXII, translated by G. C. Macaulay )
			<br>
      			<br>
      			Another example:
      			<br>
      			<br> 
			<i>'And be assured of this, if by any chance ye were not assured of it before, that 
			so long as one of the Athenians remains alive, we will never make an agreement with 
			Xerxes. […] Now therefore, with full conviction this is so, send out an army as speedily 
			as ye may: for, as we conjecture, the Barbarian will be here invading our land at no far 
			distant time but so soon as he shall be informed of the message sent, namely that we shall 
			do none of those things which he desired of us. Therefore before he arrives here in Attica, 
			it is fitting that ye come to our rescue quickly in Bœotia.'</i>
			<br>
			<br>
			(Herodotus , ibid. VIII, CXLIV) 
			<br>
      			<br>
      			We would like to know the contents of the PRESS FROM ATHENS TO PERSIA that preceded this one !
			<br>
      			<br>
      			Such is the reason why I have devised Aegean - because on reading Thucydides or 
      			Herodotus one feels as though one were engaged in an exceptional game of Diplomacy , 
      			a game in which the players are not only cunning strategists, but gifted writers and 
      			talented diplomats. 
			<br>
      			<br>
			The story begins with a minor fight between the Ionian League and its powerful 
			neighbor the Persian Empire. It ends some two centuries later with the breathtaking 
			solo performance of Alexander, king of Macedonia. 
			<br>
      			<br>
      			
      			<br>
			<big>
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">2.   "La Géographie, ça sert d'abord à faire la guerre." </span>
			</big>
			<br>
			('The main use of Geography is in warfare' - to borrow the title of French 
      			geographer Yves Lacoste 's book) 
			<br>
      			<br>
      			A few minutes exploring the site of The Diplomatic Pouch will be enough to see 
      			the enormous number of variants of the game. It came as a surprise to me that 
      			among more than a hundred of them only very few were devoted to Ancient Greece, 
      			whereas several important ones are about Rome. 
			<br>
      			<br>
			I personally side with Allan B. Calhamer in thinking that a 'game should 
			be as simple as possible, so long as the game is of indeterminate length and 
			reasonably rich in strategic choices . According to this opinion, my purpose 
			was to devise the simplest variant, the one closest to the Standard game, at 
			once avoiding over-specific rules and yet remaining true to the historical and 
			geographical reality of Ancient Greece. 
			<br>
			<br>
			The first condition was not to locate the game at any precise date : at no time 
			in Greek history before Alexander can one find forces numerous enough and 
			geographically balanced to justify an interesting adaptation of Diplomacy . 
			Either the powers were too small (archaic cities, for example) or there were too 
			few of them (Sparta, Athens and Persia in the 5th century BC). My solution was to 
			situate the game not at a given date, but within the limits of a well-defined 
			period - the so-called 'classical age' , from the early Median Wars to the crowning 
			of Alexander the Great, covering the 5th and 6th centuries BC. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Five nations were prominent then : Athens, Sparta, Thebes (the Boeotian Confederacy), 
			Macedonia and Persia. The necessities of the game called for two more : 
			<br>
			<br>
			- Ionia : though it never materialized into a state, it was nevertheless an 
			important cultural and artistic centre in archaic times, and boasted several 
			naval cities, such as Chios and Samos, later to be integrated into the Athenian 
			Empire. Its rebellion against Persia was the starting-point of the Median Wars. 
			<br>
			<br>
			- Thessaly: famous for its cavalry, whose misfortune it was to coalesce into 
			a federation precisely when Philip of Macedonia started building in its 
			vicinity an overpowering irresistible kingdom. 
			<br>
			<br>
			Therefore, the date at which the game begins is totally arbitrary (475 BC, just 
			after the Median Wars). But as the Judge works with positive dates only, and 
			since the Greeks computed time from the first Olympic Games (776 BC), 475 BC 
			becomes 301 after the first Olympiad ( S301M). 
			<br>
			<br>
			[Map #1] 
			<br>
			<br>
			As to Territories. I have tried my best to keep to the known borders of the various 
			cities, countries, kingdoms, federations or Persian satrapies. The smallest 
			territories, though, have been suppressed or reorganized, hopefully without damage 
			to cultural or historical integrity. Thus I have had to downsize Athenian 
			possessions, allowing the city only one dominion in the Aegean Sea, the Delos 
			Sanctuary facing alone the Ionian navy. If Athens is bent on a maritime empire, it 
			will have to build it up in the course of the game. I have also included Naupactus, 
			which in reality was a loyal ally of Athens, in the Boeotian Confederacy, which 
			otherwise would have been too weak. The location of supply centres was defined more 
			in accordance with the requirements of the game than on a historical basis, although 
			they are all cities or sanctuaries which were actually or symbolically important. 
			Ithaca or Troy, for example, had no major role in the classical age, but it would 
			have been frustrating to leave them out and not to revisit the Iliad (the Trojan War) 
			and the Odyssey (Ulysses' return to Ithaca). 
			<br>
			<br>
			Similarly, the maritime provinces have retained, if not their complete historical 
			reality, at least a sort of geographical relevance. The intricate outline of the 
			Aegean space, with its peninsulas, isthmuses, islands and archipelagos, on top of 
			the economic and strategic importance of the maritime space and of insular territories, 
			absolutely required a few specific rules listed and explained below : 
			<br>
			<br>
			- Six Athenian, Ionian and neutral territories are 'insular centres ', that is 
			sea-bound countries, conceived as both sea and land. There are none in the standard 
			rules, but they exist in some variants. A fleet in such a district can convoy an 
			army. Conversely, no army can go there unless it is first convoyed, or unless a 'bridge' 
			connects the territory to the mainland, or again unless part of the territory is 
			on the mainland (such is the case for Ithaca). These six centres are Ithaca, Aegina, 
			Delos, Lesbos, Chios and Samos. Obviously, it is more profitable to control these 
			centres with a fleet rather than an army, but one cannot be sure. Delos might serve 
			as a convenient relay station for troops on the way from Europe to Asia... 
			<br>
			<br>
			- Contrary to the Standard game, there are no distinctions between coasts in the 
			three territories which have two seafronts (Corinth, Megara and Thebes). Although 
			it seems to us unlikely that a fleet arriving in Thebes via the Corinth gulf would next 
			leave it via the Euboic gulf, yet it is true to historical reality and to the very plain 
			fact that boats and crews carried so little weight as to make transfer by land easy and 
			frequent. The isthmus of Corinth, moreover, offered early in Antiquity a canal which 
			made the crossing of this strategic obstacle even easier. 
			<br>
			<br>
			- Similarly, armies would have had no problems in negotiating the Straights 
			(sailing coastwise). Hence the presence on the map of thirteen 'bridges' between 
			neighboring inland provinces or between one of them and a few islands off the coast. 
			These bridges help in making the game less constricted (they solve such questions 
			as how to enter Peloponnesus or to cross Propontis). The specific rules concerning 
			these bridges are explained in the help file of the 'Classical' variant, to which 
			I refer the reader. Just remember that the crossing of a bridge by an army in 
			no way affects the movements of fleets 'under' the bridge. 
			<br>
			<br>
			- When Athens eventually built up its maritime empire, the cities it conquered 
			were immediately required to sustain its military power : Samos and Lesbos provided 
			a number of ships yearly, other cities paid tribute, all to the same end. 
			Similarly, the allies of the Peloponnesian League provided Sparta with troops, 
			in the same way as the provinces under Persian dominion. So it would have been 
			irrational to allow constructions only to national centres : the powers may launch 
			constructions, as in the 'Aberration' variant, in any of the free centres they 
			rule over so long as they hold on to at least one of their original centres. 
			<br>
			<br>
			One last point : to prevent isolation and the subsequent excess of tranquillity 
			enjoyable by corner powers such as Sparta, Macedonia or Persia, I have deliberately 
			tried to 'bring together' neighboring countries. Distances from East to West in 
			particular are considerably shortened by the greater extension of land and sea 
			provinces (Thrace or Cretan Sea, for example), so as to increase the relations 
			between Europe and Asia. For the same reason, extensive territories to the periphery 
			allow for quicker movement around. Basically, the map should be seen as circular, 
			with Delos, the ''navel' or 'omphalos' ', at the centre, two maritime inner powers 
			(Athens and Ionia) and five inland powers adjacent two by two. 
			<br>
			<br>
			[ Map #2 ] [ Map #3 ] 
			<br>
			<br>
			Yet one should not make too much of this apparent circularity : it covers a strong 
			dissymmetry between ancient Greece, with its numerous provinces and centres, and the 
			more sheltered territories on the periphery to the North and in Asia Minor, with 
			their looser structure and their fewer centres. A quick survey of the available 
			centres (38 of them altogether, which means that victory is obtained when 20 have 
			been secured) and of their location on the map shows two main structures, of vital 
			importance to those that crave hegemony : 
			<br>
			<br>
			- a binary structure : 19 centres are in European Greece, if one includes 
			Thessaly and leaves out Delos and Dodona ; the other 19 are elsewhere on the map, 
			to the North, in the Aegean sea and in Asia. 
			<br>
			<br>
			- a ternary structure : 12 centres are in central and southern Greece : 
			Boeotia (except Lamia and Chalcis), Athens (except Delos) and the Peloponnesus ; 13 
			in northern Greece, Macedonia and Thrace ; 13 in Asia Minor and the Aegean sea. 
			<br>
			<br>
			All this is true to the facts of the age ; whilst the old cities, enclosed in 
			restricted areas, fought over trivial questions, new powers that had for long 
			been looked down upon as barbarians in spite of their Greek culture took a 
			broader and more prospective view of things, settled on the margins of the 
			Greek world and rang the knell of their preeminence (Macedonia, later on the 
			Hellenistic kingdoms that superseded the Persian Empire, finally Rome).
