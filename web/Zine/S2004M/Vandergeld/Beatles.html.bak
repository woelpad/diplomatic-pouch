			When I find my France in times of trouble<br>
			Turks and Russians come to me,<br>
			Speaking that word of wisdom:<br>
			Burgundy<br>
			<br>
			And when my press all goes unanswered<br>
			Even from loquacious Italy<br>
			Somewhere, someone whispers:<br>
			Burgundy<br>
			<br>
			<i>1st Chorus:</i><br>
			Burgundy, Burgundy<br>
			Burgundy, yeah Burgundy<br>
			Picardy's not the answer-<br>
			Burgundy<br>
			<br>
			When the deadline's fast approaching<br>
			And black armies are all that I can see<br>
			Usenet dorks advise me-<br>
			Burgundy<br>
			<br>
			"England's lied-he'll hit the Channel<br>
			But you can always trust in me."<br>
			Nein. Army Paris goes to-<br>
			Burgundy<br>
			<br>
			<i>2nd Chorus:</i><br>
			Burgundy, Burgundy<br>
			Burgundy, yeah Burgundy<br>
			Gascony?! Get real!<br>

			<i>[A quick note: this one focuses on perhaps the three greatest sources 
			of first year lies. The first verse/chorus is a call/response for England 
			going to the Channel. The second verse/chorus concerns dialogue between 
			a conciliatory German and a jilted Russian over Sweden. The third 
			verse/chorus is between Turkey and Russia over the Black Sea.]</i>

			Nothing in my inbox.<br>
			On the old hard drive.<br>
			Nothing but invective<br>
			In broadcast now will fly<br>
			I didn't want to make it<br>
			But Berlin said you'd try<br>
			I don't want Brest!<br>
			Does this mean you don't trust me anymore?<br>
			<br>
			<i>1st Chorus:</i><br>
			Don't pass me lies, don't make me cry, don't make excuses<br>
			'Cause you know England, I see through your ruses<br>
			You'd better know, I hate you so. That fleet had better go.<br>
			You told me lies. You made me cry.<br>
			<br>
			I hear the plots a'forming<br>
			'Tween Moscow and London.<br>
			You know I really love you<br>
			This year take Sweden<br>
			But the Archduke sent me money<br>
			My kids need medicine!<br>
			"Three builds too much"!?<br>
			Does this mean you don't trust me anymore?<br>
			<br>
			<i>2nd Chorus:</i><br>
			Don't pass me lies, don't make me cry, don't make excuses<br>
			'Cause you know Kaiser, I see through your ruses<br>
			You'd better know, I hate you so. To the Baltic I will go.<br>
			You told me lies. I hope you die.<br>
			<br>
			I'm sorry someone lied to you-<br>
			Yes, it really quite unfair.<br>
			We DMZed the Black Sea<br>
			But somehow my fleet's there.<br>
			You sent me press filled with hate<br>
			And said that we're through.<br>
			But that's alright, I'm waiting here<br>
			Just waiting to here from you!<br>
			<br>
			<i>3rd Chorus:</i><br>
			Don't pass me lies, don't make me cry, don't make excuses<br>
			'Cause you know Sultan, I see through your ruses<br>
			You'd better know, I hate you so. That fleet had better go.<br>
			You told me lies. I hope you fry.<br>

			There are sharp knives sticking out of me<br>
			Oh, bad fortune came suddenly…<br>
			Why they had to stab, I don't know, they didn't say.<br>
			I said something wrong, now I long for yesterday.<br>
			Yesterday, Dip was such a friendly game to play,<br>
			Now I need a place to hide away,<br>
			Oh, I believe in yesterday…<br>
