			<i>Editor's note: This is my favourite article as it talks about
			a great way to get new people who are interested into Diplomacy
			but don't feel comfortable jumping in by themsleves.  I have a friend
			who has always stayed on the fringe as he feels daunted to jump into
			a game.  This would be a great option for him and others like him.
			I think we should try and promote more of these type of games.  
			I like it so much one I will dedicate my next "Canadian" series
			of games, which I run on the DPjudge, to this concept.)</i>	
			<br>
			<br>

			The TeachMe format has comprised a series of standard partial press 
			games where each power is played by a relative newbie, each 
			accompanied by an experienced coach that sees all
			the press that is being sent to and from that newbie, with the coach
			being only allowed to communicate with their own power.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The intention of the format is to provide a learning experience for all
			concerned - often the best way to learn something is to teach it, and
			for the newbies this is a golden chance to learn from a previously
			experienced player.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			There have been three games in the series to date. I took part as a
			relative newbie playing Austria in teachme3. From my perspective I
			found the experience immensely helpful. There was a fair bit of
			discussion in the EOG of teachme3 about the format, improvements that
			could be made, problems that might need addressing, and it seemed
			appropriate to me to try and develop these ideas into a more structured
			reflection on the whole series. (Maybe after reading this you'll think
			otherwise!)
			<br>
			<br>
			
			I therefore sought the view of other past participants in the series,
			whether as players, coaches, or GMs (some have fulfilled more than one
			role over the course of time). I asked some general questions, and some
			directed specifically at coaches or players. I've done my best to
			summarize and collate the responses below.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<br>
			<big>
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">What did you learn from your participation in TeachMe?</span>
			</big>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			"Teaching guys like Brent Warner and Chris Aanstoos the secrets
			 of advanced play can have a negative effect on your JDPR Rank." - Eric Hunter
			<br>
			<br>
			
			As might be expected, players in general felt that they learnt <b>a lot</b>
			from having the almost instant feedback on how they were doing from an
			experienced player. A number reported how much better their play became
			as a result of playing in a TeachMe game - in most cases the
			improvements were noticeable even as the game itself went on. It was
			interesting to note that coaches as well as players found TeachMe a
			learning experience. Even GMs felt that being 'in' on everything being
			said, both between players and between players and coaches, was a great
			learning experience.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			There was also felt to be a significant learning opportunity at the end
			of the game with the availability of the complete press archive -
			enabling players to look back through the various stages of the game,
			seeing how their press and tactics were being analyzed by other players
			and coaches. The difficulty with this was making the press available in
			a user-friendly format (realistically web-based) and also the sheer
			volume of press involved (in teachme3 around 3600 messages) which at
			the end of a long game takes a bit of ploughing through. You can view
			the full press archive from the teachme3 game at 
			the <a href="http://diplopress.topcities.com">Diplomacy Press Archives</a>.
			<br>
			<br>
			 
			<br>
			<big>
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">What works well about the TeachMe format, and what are the drawbacks?</span>
			</big>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			A general view is that the key innovation
			of the TeachMe format - i.e. the presence of a coach offering
			near-instant feedback on the nuances of press, strategy and tactics -
			is extremely useful, and the huge opportunities for all involved for
			learning and improving your game.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The only major drawback identified (which is unavoidable to a large
			extent) is that there is a lot riding on the quality of the
			relationship between the player and his/her coach. If that relationship
			goes well, the game seems to be a great learning experience for all
			involved. If for some reason player and coach don't hit it off (whether
			due to lack of time, commitment to the game, no rapport etc etc etc)
			then the game becomes a bit more of a struggle, especially if as a
			player you are not benefitting from the sort of advice and discussion
			that other players may be.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Another potential downside is the additional complication of having the
			extra press flying between coach and player, which can result in
			unfortunate errors (e.g. press intended for a coach being sent to a
			rival power, which could reveal an awful lot about your intentions) and
			as a practical issue inevitably requires longer deadlines, and may
			result in less spontaneous press than might otherwise occur. The sheer
			volume of all this press can become a little overwhelming, and if
			communication between player and coach drops off too much, the main
			benefits of the format are lessened somewhat. That said, a certain
			amount of 'tailing off' of the flow of advice seems to be inevitable,
			as the players grow more confident and begin to 'spread their wings'.
			The way that coaches handle that loosening of the reins seems to be
			another key theme that emerges. And beneath it all there is always the
			danger that the coach uses their player as little more than a puppet to
			act out their desires - for the format to be of benefit, it is crucial
			that the player makes the final decision in all matters.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<br>
			<big>
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">What sort of issues were discussed most?</span>
			</big>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			A common theme was the way in which the game was split into 
			various facets - Diplomacy, Tactics, and Strategy (and also
			 Psychology, in the view of some). The balance between each of
			these varied depending on the perceived strengths and weaknesses of
			both players and coaches, and the changing game situation. Many players
			felt a major issue was learning how to analyze press, reading between
			the lines, and the use of subtle emphasis in both their own press and
			the press of others. Developing the skill of analyzing the board
			position in its widest sense (not just tactics) and managing the
			transition from opening to midgame, and midgame to endgame (so far as
			these distinctions exist) was also a valued theme.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			<br>
			<big>
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">Any improvements that could be made?</span>
			</big>
			<br>
			<br>
			
			There was a general feeling that the TeachMe format 
			works well as it is. Any possible modifications seem to
			revolve around trying to increase further the feedback from coaches to
			players. One suggestion was to have more than one coach for each player
			- but it can already be difficult to find suitably experienced coaches
			with the time to devote to the game, and having more than one set of
			advice coming in could be confusing for a novice player.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Another option is the concept of a "Coaches Corner", where coaches pass
			comment on the press and play of all the players - either in the form
			of a diary (which only becomes available at the end of the game, and
			doesn't allow much discussion between coaches) or via some form of
			discussion forum. The catch with the discussion approach is trying to
			avoid situations where game information spills out in the discussion -
			a suggested way round this might be for coaches to refrain from
			commenting on their own player or responding to the comments of others
			about 'their' player.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Richard Judd, GM of the original TeachMe game, suggests that one
			modification could be for observers to sign on to receive all the press
			sent and received by one particular power, including the coach-player
			correspondence. To a certain extent this merges the teachme format with
			the commentary style that has been followed in the comments and
			pinnacle games recently. It might also reduce the strain on observers
			of trying to digest all the press from a game such as this. Perhaps
			such 'power observers' could even have some mechanism of making
			comments to the coach (or allowing the coaches, but not players, to
			have access to this discussion forum) for the coach's use, allowing the
			coach to make additional suggestions to the players as they see fit.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			The possibility of alternative coaches has been suggested (with the
			necessary proviso relating to the difficulty of recruiting coaches, see
			above). This would allow students to have the opportunity to 'fire'
			their coach if they don't feel things are working out. Chris Aanstoos
			(a player in teachme2) explained that in his situation, although his
			initial coach was perfectly friendly, he didn't feel that he was
			getting the advice he needed. So he requested to have a different coach
			of his choosing, in this case Joe Brennan, who he had already struck up
			a good relationship with in a previous game.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			By the same token, students should recognize that involvement in a game
			like this is really a privilege, and therefore they should take an
			active role. There is an argument that players who are not taking a
			truly active role (e.g. persistently late, even if they meet the grace
			period; not involving a great deal of discussion with their coach)
			should be replaced.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Addressing the recruitment of coaches seems to be a key issue. It's
			perhaps worth emphasizing that, based on the comments received, there
			is no expectation that coaches have to be perfect or very highly-rated
			players (though of course it is a help, and there is a need for at
			least a certain amount of experience). A number of coaches commented
			that in some aspects of the game their players were as good or better
			than them; in those situations the coach focussed their attentions on
			the player's weaker areas, and those areas in which they felt most able
			to offer constructive comment - sometimes this was in the area of
			tactics, in others addressing the area of strategy and press.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			
			<br>
			<big>
			<span style="font-weight: bold;">My comments</span>
			</big>
			<br>
			<br>
					
			Andy Tomlinson (no relation) commented that involvement 
			in teachme3 helped him feel more like a part of the wider 
			Dip community - before then he had felt more like an outsider
			looking in. I can certainly concur with that feeling. I found that
			being involved in teachme3 was a great learning experience, and in
			combination with following both games in the comments series, has
			allowed me to develop a much greater understanding of how to improve my
			play. I hope that the series will continue - with appropriate
			modifications where necessary - and that other players, coaches and GMs
			can gain the benefits of involvement with such a great format.
			<br>
			<br>
			
			Thanks to all those who responded to my requests for comments; in
			particular Ben Harris, Chris Aanstoos, Brent Warner, Eric Hunter, Andy
			Tomlinson, Randy Hudson, Richard Judd, Thorfinn, and anyone else I've
			carelessly forgotten!
