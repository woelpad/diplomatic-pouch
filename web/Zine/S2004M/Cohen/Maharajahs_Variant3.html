More than a year has passed since the last Design of a Variant
article was published here.  Readers unfamiliar with the content
of the  <a href="/Zine/S2002R/Cohen/Maharajahs_Variant.html">first</a> or <a href="/Zine/F2002R/Cohen/Maharajahs_Variant2.html">second</a>
articles may wish to read them before
continuing.  As with the previous articles, I am writing now
to document the process of variant development so that people
might more easily develop variants themselves.  There have been
several important developments concerning Maharajah's Diplomacy,
the most important being that I have overhauled the map, based upon
comments received, and the outcomes of some playtest games, resulting
in the release of version 2.0 of the variant.  Updating the code on
the USTV judge has also been completed (though at this the time of
this writing, the accompanying "floc.net" still awaits completion),
and Maharajah's Diplomacy has been added to the Realpolitik
adjudication program.  A download of the Realpolitik files
for the variant may be obtained, among other places,
at the variant home page.
<br>
<br>
Regarding the map, I had kept an open mind as to possible changes.
The most frequent comment I received from players and observers of
the playtests concerned congestion in parts of the subcontinent,
which led to a certain feeling of diplomatic inflexibility, that
is, some players would not leave a fully defensive stance because
they felt that the closeness of the various positions left them too
vulnerable, or that any maneuvering at all might be construed as
hostile by multiple neighbors, not all of whom were the intended
target.  Also brought up fairly often were the superiority of the
edge positions, especially that of the Safavid Empire, and the
inferiority of the positions of the central Powers, though just
which Powers were central was subject to some debate.  In addition,
I received several comments concerning the limited usefulness of the
navigable rivers, and of fleets in general.  Finally, upon review
of my research materials, I had noticed several instances where I
had used province names that were either geographically or
chronologically inaccurate, and I wanted to fix or at least minimize
those errors.  So, as the results and comments came in, I began
tinkering.  The former and current maps for the variant are reproduced
here for ease of comparison.

<b>Figure 2. New Map</b>
</center>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The first thing I did was combine Indus Delta with Sind, and Ganges
Delta with Bengal, both historically accurate changes, which had the
added benefit of entering the large river valleys easier.  I then
looked once more at the possibility of enlarging the map.  Going north
would add no water of consequence, and did not seem to offer any other
benefits.  Expanding to the south would add water, but no land worth
mentioning, so that didn't seem a productive avenue to explore either.
Adding to the map on the east would add both land and water, but the
water areas would be disconnected unless I also expanded the map to
the south.  Doing so would probably change the scale of the variant,
which I wanted to keep close to that of Standard, and the new Supply
Centers created would be located far from the center of the board,
probably ending up as additional safe builds for only a few of the
Powers, most likely Vijayanagar, which didn't really need the help,
as it presently had the option of two different possible "safe"
builds already.
<br>
<br>
That left the option of expanding the map to the west.  I could only
do this by a small amount, or once again the scale would be off, but
that small amount enabled me to include the tip of present day Somalia
(Seylac, in the variant) which I made a Supply Center, and it also gave
me the opportunity to enlarge the portion of the Arabian Peninsula
covered by the map, while still maintaining it as separate from the
main part of Asia.  I decided that Yemen, which I could now separate
from Oman by (three, as it turned out) buffer provinces, could also
be given Supply Center status.  With two Supply Centers and five provinces
in total, the Arabian Peninsula would also offer some visual and play variety,
since the geography would be different from the other offshore land areas,
which were "lonely dots" (one or two province islands).  Unlike the other
offshore areas, an army might have real use there.
<br>
<br>
The total number of Supply Center provinces now stood at 37, which
appealed to me.  Keeping the number of supply centers odd (and changing
it from 35, in the previous version, to a prime number) should continue
to discourage draws.  By redrawing the western water provinces, Bahmana
(formerly the Bahmanid Sultanate) could be given good access to these
Supply Centers, beefing up the position considerably.  With five offshore
Supply Centers (Aceh, Kandy, Oman, Seylac and Yemen), the use and importance
of fleets would increase.  The additional land on the mainland portion of
the map would also allow me to redraw the boundaries in and around Persia
(formerly the Safavid Empire), which, if done correctly, would lessen its
offensive and defensive capabilities, which were often perceived by
commentators as being too strong.
<br>
<br>
The expansion also put the southeastern portion of the Caspian Sea as a
disconnected body of water in the northwest corner of the map.  I considered
connecting it to the main water areas, but could find no historically
appropriate way to do this.  No canal had ever connected the Caspian Sea
to the Persian Gulf or the Arabian Sea, either directly, or linked by rivers.
The longest river in the area, the Oxus (today, the Amu Darya), flowed
west through the northernmost portions of the map to the Caspian Sea in 1501,
the year in which Maharajah's Diplomacy begins (the course of the river has
since changed; it now flows north, to the Aral Sea).  But adding the Oxus
River and Caspian Sea did not add to the play potential in that part of the
map, so I decided to leave the Oxus off, and I made the Caspian Sea impassable.
<br>
<br>
The outer boundaries of the revised map were now set.  The tasks I now set
for myself were to make good use of the map area, by increasing the ability
of players to maneuver, and by increasing the usefulness of fleets, while
simultaneously compensating for the natural positional advantages of the edge
Powers.  I will discuss the changes I made geographically, on a Power-by-Power
basis rather than chronologically, both because of the numerous changes made
and because, from time to time, I had multiple designs under consideration
simultaneously.  I will also use the province names from version 2.0 rather
than from the previous version of the map, but as I have done previously in
some instances here, I will note the old name parenthetically, where it differs,
the first time a province is mentioned.  I will begin the discussion with Persia,
and go around the map in a roughly clockwise manner, so that the flow and
relationship of the changes may be more easily followed.
<br>
<br>
As previously stated, Persia was generally viewed as the strongest of the
Powers in the first version of Maharajah's Diplomacy, with the Safavid players,
Suzanne Castagne and Kwok-Sum Poon, each soloing in their respective games.
While I did not think that the variant was especially unbalanced (in fact, the
Safavid player was the first eliminated in both the third and fourth playtests),
I was not averse to making Persia a bit weaker, especially if doing so got me
closer to my other goals.  In the redesign, I moved the Supply Center in Shiraz
to Isfahan, added several buffer/flank provinces (from the north, Kara Kum,
Elburz, Dasht-I-Kavir and Qom), and merged Khorasan into Yezd.  Together,
these changes reduced the offensive capability of Persia, because a player no
longer had the option of an all-purpose offensive and defensive move to Kandahar
(and Kandahar didn't front on Rajputana anyway, because I had extended Peshawar
so that it bordered on Sind).  Defensively, Persia was weakened as well, because
of the increased isolation of the Supply Center in Meshed.  Persian players would
now need to commit earlier, or adopt a more defensive outlook.
<br>
<br>
On the other hand, with the addition of a second coastal home Supply Center,
and the additional offshore neutrals, a predominantly naval strategy was now a
more realistic option for Persia, and the increased separation of Persia from
its neighbors would tend to make a long term alliance with Persia easier to form.
If Persia forgoes an immediate attack on its neighbors, Bahmana, Mughalistan
(formerly the Mughal Empire) and Rajputana, and is not attacked itself, it has
a reasonable chance of obtaining multiple first-year builds.  Depending on specific,
in-game negotiations, Oman, Herat, Sind and Gujarat are all possible conquests.
Persia may also be in contention to take Yemen in 1502, since (due to the
configuration of the map) Yemen will be one of two neutral Supply Centers vacant
at the end of 1501.
<br>
<br>
My concern with Mughalistan was primarily one of getting more separation from its
neighbors, so that it could expand in one direction without appearing to be a looming
threat to everyone else.  I had already accomplished this with Persia, but the more
serious problem lay in the east, with Delhi (formerly the Delhi Sultanate) and
Rajputana.  After some more thought, I decided that the best way to do this would be
to get rid of the Supply Center in Lahore.  Kashmir would still be a source of conflict
between Mughalistan and Delhi, but the problem of early, long-term tactical gridlock
due to the mass of closely packed dots in the area would be alleviated.
<br>
<br>
But I couldn't just remove the supply center.  Mughalistan could very easily be
held out of its most likely neutral targets, Kashmir and Herat, and have no builds in
the first year, unless a successful first year attack was mounted on Delhi, Persia or
Rajputana.  I therefore placed a Supply Center in the north, in Samarkand, which I had
combined with Tashkent.  Now Mughalistan had a "sure" build, but moving there from Balkh or
Badakhshan, since I had shifted the border of Ferghana to allow for access by either Mughal
army, would mean a decreased chance of taking another neutral, so this advantage did
not come without a price.  Finally, to give Mughalistan more of the reason to care about
what was happening in the ocean, in addition to having Peshawar border on Sind, I extended
the Indus River a bit further to the northeast, and gave Kabul river frontage.
<br>
<br>
Delhi, along with increased separation from Mughalistan due to the removal of the Supply
Center from Lahore, has a new buffer province, Mewar, increasing the breathing room between
Delhi and Rajputana.  Further south, however, the buffer province of Mahanadi has been
removed, so relations between Delhi and Gondwana may be a bit tenser, though both could
still easily ally or go their separate ways, since a band of buffer provinces remains
between them.  The more significant changes for Delhi lie in the southeast, where the
border I created between Ava and Muzzafarpur (formerly Bihar) will enable Delhi to try
for either Pegu or Ayutthaya, instead of Ayutthaya only being a possible first year
conquest for Vijayanagar.  Other possible neutral conquests for Delhi in 1501 include Malwa,
or Orissa, and of course, Delhi can mount direct attacks on Gondwana, Mughalistan or
Rajputana.  Finally, the previously mentioned combination of Ganges Delta with Bengal
should make strategies featuring a significant naval component more viable.
<br>
<br>
Gondwana underwent several significant changes.  In addition to gaining a river frontage,
all of the Gondwanan home provinces and several of the neighboring spaces were renamed and
reconfigured.  I added the river frontage after noting on my reference maps that an arm
of the Ganges River, the Hooghly, flowed south to the Bay of Bengal considerably west of
the main river delta.  Since many of the likely initial moves for a unit in the newly
created province of Sambalpur would be to other river provinces, I decided to start Gondwana
with a fleet in Sambalpur.  My thought was to add some tactical variety to that
area of the board.  In the prior version of Maharajah's Diplomacy, Vijayanagaran command
of the eastern water provinces often went unchallenged for most of the game.  I also
moved one of the Gondwanan starting armies away from Bidar (formerly Hyderabad).
Gondwana, Bahmana and Vijayanagar would now each initially have one army next to Bidar
(Rajpur, in the case of Gondwana), which would make for some very interesting
negotiations.  Similarly, the army in Jabalpur, Gondwana's third starting unit, would
be two moves away from the neutral Supply Center in Malwa, as are armies from Bahmana,
Delhi, Rajputana and Vijayanagar, so any Power attempting to take Malwa must be prepared
for intense negotiations.
<br>
<br>
Unlike some of the other Powers, Gondwana has no "automatic builds" in 1501.  It does,
however, have an excellent chance to obtain multiple builds from a group of Supply Centers
including Bidar, Malwa, Orissa and Pegu, and of course, a Gondwanan player can mount first
year attacks on Bahmana, Delhi, Rajputana or Vijayanagar.  I believe that the strength of
Gondwana lies in its great flexibility.  Gondwana can make an excellent ally for any of
its neighbors, and with purposeful negotiation, it is well situated for further expansion.
Each of the Gondwanan starting units has several potentially effective moves, arguably
giving Gondwana a more flexible initial position than any of the other Powers.
<br>
<br>
In contrast, I left the Vijayanagaran initial home Supply Centers unchanged, but I did
alter some of the nearby provinces.  I split the province of Kra off from Ayutthaya, and
split off the eastern part of Maldive Sea (which was connected to Seylac), renaming it
Sea of Ceylon (the old sea of Ceylon was renamed Nicobar Sea).  These changes gave the
Powers in the area more maneuvering room.  Vijayanagar no longer has a choice of "automatic"
neutrals for its fleet, and the improved access to water for Delhi and Gondwana makes
the Vijayanagaran position less secure, since it can no longer send its fleets west
while being unconcerned about foreign naval units in the east.  The neighboring Powers
may contest control by Vijayanagar of any of the nearby neutral Supply Centers except
Aceh, those being Ayutthaya, Bidar, Kandy, Orissa and Pegu.  That said, Vijayanagar
still has a good defensive position, and with the addition of new "offshore" neutral
Supply Centers, Vijayanagar's excellent access to water could form a good basis for
further expansion, if an immediate or delayed attack on Bahmana or Gondwana is not
considered advantageous.
<br>
<br>
My main concern with Bahmana was giving it some additional separation from its neighbors,
accomplished by several previously mentioned changes, and by the extension of the province
of Ahmadabad (formerly Anhilwara) to the Arabian Sea.  While this cuts Bahmana off from
immediate access to Gujarat, this is compensated for by the addition of Seylac, to which
only Bahmana has first year access.  Bahmana also has the sole immediate access to Khandesh,
as well as a chance to take a number of other neutral Supply Centers, including Kandy,
Malwa and Oman, and first year attacks on Gondwana, Persia, Rajputana or Vijayanagar
can be mounted.  Bahmana, then, has excellent first year, which provide compensation
for its less than secure central starting position.  With ready access to the dot-rich
center of the board, and frontage on the Arabian and Laccadive Seas, Bahmana has a
flexible position with excellent opportunities for growth.  Depending on the ally,
Bahmana can move strongly with armies, or adopt a primarily naval orientation.
<br>
<br>
Greater separation from Bahmana, Delhi, Mughalistan and Persia has also benefited the position
of Rajputana.  With the movement of the Persian Supply Center of Shiraz to Isfahan, Persia
must forego Oman to contest an immediate occupation of Sind by the Rajputanan fleet
(changed from an army) in Jaisalmer (formerly Ahmadabad). Further, the army in Jodhpur
(formerly Chitor) cannot be opposed if an immediate move is made to Gujarat.  Though the
province of Peshawar has been extended south to Sind, a Spring 1501 move there by Mughalistan
is not overly likely, since Army Kabul will often be need elsewhere.  Still, Rajputana has a
remedy to that in its third unit, Army Multan.  The unit has a large variety of possible uses.
A defensively minded Rajputanan could move to Bikaner (formerly Jodhpur), covering all the
Rajputanan home Supply Centers, while players more inclined toward offense have possible moves
to Jaipur, Lahore or Peshawar to consider.  Depending on whether the Rajputanan player wishes
to make certain neighbors nervous or angry, or upon how successful Rajputanan diplomacy has
been, neutral dots could also be gained in 1501 in Bidar, Kashmir, Khandesh or Malwa, or
immediate attacks can be attempted on Bahmana, Delhi, Mughalistan or Persia.
<br>
<br>
I will now move on to a discussion of the map as a whole.  With 37 Supply centers out of
a total of 77 provinces (48.05%), Maharajah's Diplomacy is slightly bigger and more
densely "dotted" than Standard Diplomacy, which has 34 Supply Centers out of a total of
75 provinces (45.33%).  By itself, this increased density would tend to make stalemates
slightly more likely to occur in Maharajah's Diplomacy.  David Norman has pointed out some
"majority" stalemate lines (stalemate lines where two or more Powers can hold a majority
of the Supply Centers on the board indefinitely against another Power or Powers).  I am
aware of others, and though no comprehensive analysis has been made, my present belief is
that such majority lines will prove to be slightly less common in Maharajah's Diplomacy
than in Standard.
<br>
<br>
Where the particular configuration of the board and the specific variant rules have a
big influence is in making "minority" stalemate lines (where a Power or Powers holding
less than half of the Supply Centers on the map may hold off the other Powers on the
board indefinitely) much less common, despite the slightly higher map density.  With
the ability of the Powers to gain new home Supply Centers, the inability to build anywhere
on the board, one of the major aids to creating stalemates in Standard Diplomacy, is no
longer a factor.  Not having an impassable province in the middle of the map, dividing
possible avenues of attack, also makes stalemate lines more difficult to form.  Paul
Stuckwisch (with some help from me) has performed a fairly extensive analysis of possible
minority stalemate positions.  I will not discuss our minority stalemate findings here,
but they can be viewed, along with the special variant rules, at the Maharajah's Diplomacy
home page.  Suffice it to say that all the stalemate positions discovered so far are
large (the smallest contains 15 Supply Centers) and are not too easy to get to.  I expect
that stalemate lines will not figure prominently in most games.
<br>
<br>
The general opinion of those who have studied the maps of both versions of the variant
is that the original version of Maharajah's Diplomacy was already fairly well balanced,
and version 2.0 was a significant improvement, certainly having better balance than
Standard, though proof of this will, of course, only come after enough games have been
played to provide a representative sample of results.  The modified Chaos build rule
should also help with game balance, since with some foresight in choosing expansion
paths, the comparatively inferior starting positions (for purposes of defense) of the
more centrally located Powers can be improved dramatically.
<br>
<br>
On the software and support front, as previously stated, Maharajah's Diplomacy is
now supported by Realpolitik.  I knew that some people would not undertake to GM a
variant without having an adjudication program they could use.  After looking at
several, I concluded that Realpolitik was widely used, and had technical support
in place.  It was also readily adaptable to variants, since some two dozen variants
were already available.  With invaluable help along the way from Joe Janbu, Gregory
Alexopoulos, Frank Bacher and Davlin Stoy, the basic variant (river convoys and the
special build rule must be handled manually) was successfully programmed.  The
process for developing the files necessary to add the variant to Realpolitik is
somewhat tedious, but when all is said and done, not that complicated.  A special
map is created to help place icons (which can be standard, or customized to suit the
variant, as is the case for Maharajah's Diplomacy) on the map that the players see.
Other files are created which name the Powers, set their colors, designate the "fill
patterns" by which ownership of Supply Centers are indicated, and so forth.  The most
time consuming task is creating a gigantic list of border relationships.  For each
province, a list is made of all the provinces that border it.  Errors can creep in very
easily in the process.  Hopefully, there are no bugs in the implementation, but if any
are found, I am sure they can be fixed.  I have also learned that more than one variety
of judge program exists.  Some additional work is necessary to make the latest version
variant available on certain of the judges.  Fortunately, Yarden Livnat has volunteered
to do what is necessary to make Maharajah's Diplomacy available on the USDP judge, and
Juho Snellman will be creating the map which I am told is all that is needed to add the
variant to the USTV judge.
<br>
<br>
On the publicity end of things, in addition to this latest article in the series, and
various announcements and listings in different forums and websites, I thought that
organizing a tournament might be a good way to get that variant "on the radar" of
the hobby.  Even if I could get the players (which would be impossible), I did not
want to try to duplicate the size and complexity of a large tournament, like the
Worldmasters.  But a two-round, top and advance type tournament did seem like a
realistic goal.  I would be the Tournament Director, and could get an assistant, a
roster of GMs, and a group of people to form a review committee to deal with any problems
that might arise.  Since I had been involved in organizing and/or running the last
three Worldmasters tournaments, I was familiar with rules and structures that worked,
and I was able to adapt the Worldmasters rules as a template, tweaking and adapting here
and there, and stripping out those sections I did not need.  At the time of this
writing (July, 2004), the "Maharajiad I" tournament is entering the closing phases
of the first round.
<br>
<br>
Future installments in this series will discuss the results of the tournament, and other
variant related developments.  As always, I welcome any help or comments from members
of the hobby.  I hope this series of articles will continue to be of assistance to
anyone attempting to design a variant of his or her own.
