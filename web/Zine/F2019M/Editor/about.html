2019 was for me a year of meetings, of loss and recalibration. As you will notice, this is not going to be the issue in which we're going to bid farewell to Larry Peery. He left a ton of material, enough to fill up a few Zines, and it's simply more practical to do them in chronological order a couple at a time.
</p>
<p>
As I'm writing this on the last day of the year, knowing very well that this will be the only issue published this year, I can put into perspective the value that editing this Zine has to me personally. I do sometimes get some feedback on the impact the Zine and the Pouch makes on other people's lives, but those are few and far in between. And so I need to consider what its worth is in the absence of outside encouragement.
</p>
<p>
It's an outlet for my creativity, most demonstrably in the various puzzles that I continue to publish, and for any writer ambitions I have. It brings me into contact with people in the Hobby (writers, readers, other contributors) from anywhere around the world. It teaches me various aspects of publishing an online magazine, things like deciding on the content, creating the layout, soliciting for articles, promoting the publication, and yes, working towards a deadline (and the trade-off with quality, which usually trumps it). It's a hobby, and as such I need to weigh it off against my job and family obligations (or opportunities) and other hobbies. It doesn't always come out the winner, but I realize it has enough appeal to continue the effort.
</p>
<p>
A year has gone by in which the Hobby hasn't stood still. Another WDC came and went, which we're not going to cover. Congratulations to the winner, Gwen Maggi, and kudos to all other participants in Marseilles, France. It will be in Vermont next year, then come to Bangkok (of all places) for the very first appearance in Asia. As I understand it, we don't have any local representation there, but Andrew, Lei and others are going to set it up using low cost airfares and with the help of the international tourist industry. Keeping an eye out and an ear open for more news.
</p>
<h3>Enjoy the Pouch!</h3>
