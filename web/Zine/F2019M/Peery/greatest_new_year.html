				<h3>
					How To Celebrate Christmas In Japan
					<br />
					By Alicia Joy
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					<a href="https://theculturetrip.com/asia/japan/articles/how-to-celebrate-christmas-in-japan/">theculturetrip.com</a> &mdash; Christmas in Japan is a fun, festive time of year. Since there are few Christians in the country, none of the religious connotations associated with Christmas were brought over from the West, and it isn&#8217;t a national holiday. However, many of the things traditionally associated with Christmas – festive trees in the shopping malls, Christmas markets, and LED lights – make an appearance, as well as a few unique traditions that are purely Japanese.

					Why Japan Is Obsessed With Kentucky Fried Chicken on Christmas
					<br />
					By K. Annabelle Smith

					<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/why-japan-is-obsessed-with-kentucky-fried-chicken-on-christmas-1-161666960/">smithsonianmag.com</a> &mdash; Christmas isn&#8217;t a national holiday in Japan &ndash; only one percent of the Japanese population is estimated to be Christian &ndash; yet a bucket of &#8220;Christmas Chicken&#8221; (the next best thing to turkey &ndash; a meat you can&#8217;t find anywhere in Japan) is the go-to meal on the big day. And it&#8217;s all thanks to the insanely successful &#8220;Kurisumasu ni wa kentakkii!&#8221; (Kentucky for Christmas!) marketing campaign in 1974.

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					James F. Dunnigan (born August 8, 1943 in Rockland County, New York) is a game designer, author, lecturer, and commentator who is one of the most important figures in the history of wargaming, founding SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in 1969 after having his first wargame Jutland published by The Avalon Hill Game Co in 1967. Between 1966 and 1992, he designed over 100 wargames. He also wrote &#8220;The Complete Wargames Handbook&#8221; in 1980. He previously served in the military as a repair technician and has a degree in history from Columbia University.

			<p>
				One of the greatest losses in Diplomacy history took place at DIPCON XXII in San Diego when I very naively traded my carefully acquired set of the first 30 or so issues of S&amp;T &mdash; that I had acquired by trading my Diplomacy &#8216;zine XENOGOGIC for them &mdash; with Jim Dunnigan while he  was in Japan. At that time the &#8216;zine was actually printed in Japan and then shipped to the US for distribution.
			</p>

			<p>
				What did I get in return? Ron Spitzer offered me two copies of the European version of Diplomacy for my never punched S&amp;Ts. As first I hesitated, but Ron had a way with words and the ability to charm oil out of a snake and I eventually agreed. Not since the Russians sold Alaska has &hellip; Steve Cooley still cries when he remembers that story. I only mention this because it shows how far back the history of Diplomacy actually goes in Japan.  Dunnigan was trading with a half-dozen or so of the postal Diplomacy hobby&#8217;s earliest publishers, probably looking for prospective S&amp;T subbers.
			</p>

			<h2>
				BUT WHERE TO HOST OUR EVENT?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Dip venues are famous in Japan.  Here are two from Tokyo, one from Kyoto and one from somewhere else.  Can you guess?
			</p>

			<div class="centered">
				<img class="image" src="../images/queen_elizabeth.jpg">
			</div>

			<p>
				Love hotels are part of Japan&#8217;s tradition, and the Queen Elizabeth is regarded as the most popular of them all. It&#8217;s not because of the great service, but more because of its wacky design. At 92 the Grand Old Dame would be proud!
			</p>

			<div class="centered">
				<img class="image" src="../images/sunburst.jpg">
			</div>

			<p>
				Ground prices are sky high in Tokyo, so every square meter counts, even if they&#8217;re not square. Triangular buildings, where two streets meet at a sharp angle, can be found all over the city. This one, the Sunburst in Meguro, takes the cake by virtue of the giant red ball attached to it like an oversized tumor. (dh)
			</p>

			<div class="centered">
				<img class="image" src="../images/kinkakuji.jpg" height="492">
			</div>

			<p>
				Given the abundance of temples and shrines in the country, it&#8217;s not entirely impossible that one might be rented for a peaceful conference, DipCon style. This golden temple in Kyoto, called Kinkakuji, is probably not the first place to look into. (dh)
			</p>

			<div class="centered">
				<img class="image" src="../images/tv_tower.jpg">
			</div>

			<p>
				Whenever you see a TV tower in Japan, you might be excused for thinking you just landed in Paris. Tokyo started the trend with Tokyo Tower, a red version of the Eiffel Tower, now eclipsed by the similarly shaped Sky Tree. Pictured here is the TV tower in Sapporo (Hokkaido). (dh)

					Monkey D. Luffy, also known as &#8220;Straw Hat Luffy&#8221; and commonly as &#8220;Straw Hat&#8221;, is the main protagonist of the manga and anime, <i>One Piece</i>. He is the founder and captain of the increasingly infamous and powerful Straw Hat Pirates, as well as one of its top four fighters. His lifelong dream is to become the Pirate King by finding the legendary treasure left behind by the late Pirate King, Gol D. Roger. He believes that being Pirate King means having the most freedom in the world. After his invasion of Totto Land and actions against the Yonko Big Mom, he is currently considered by the global press to be the Fifth Emperor.

He is the descendant of Chilled, the second son of King Cold, the younger brother of Cooler, and the father of Kuriza. Frieza is the catalyst antagonist of the entire franchise, as it is his actions that led to Goku arriving on Earth. He has made several comebacks since his fight with Goku on Namek, including multiple invasions of Earth. Recently, he has been chosen to represent Universe 7 as the tenth member of Team Universe 7 for the Tournament of Power as a replacement for Good Buu. This makes him the most recurring villain of the <i>Dragon Ball</i> series. After the events of the Tournament of Power, he is revived and recovers his title as Emperor of Universe 7.

			<p>
				Japanese manga and anime series tend to be very long-lived with an ever expanding caste of characters, none of whom is actually allowed to die. You need a cheat sheet just to find out who's who, as so many of them appear even in a single episode. Unless you&#8217;re an <i>otaku</i>, that is. (dh)

I saw ads all over Tokyo showing smiling faces gathered around a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, with the slogan &#8220;Kurisumasu ni wa Kentakki&#8221; (&#8220;If It&#8217;s Christmas, It Must Be Kentucky&#8221;). &#8220;Is this a thing?&#8221; I asked a Japanese friend. She explained that on Christmas, people in Japan do indeed feast on fried chicken, along with Champagne and Christmas cake—usually a strawberry shortcake. &#8220;Then your boyfriend takes you to a love hotel,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like Valentine&#8217;s Day in America, a couples holiday.&#8221;

Indeed, it was a fixture of my childhood. In local supermarkets, there they&#8217;d be, stacks of Boston cream pies on a table in the bakery department, protected in see-through plastic containers and slapped with a sticker proclaiming a great deal ending in .99. True to its classic form, the dessert consisted of two layers of sponge cake, a thick center of yellow cream and a chocolate-frosted top.
				</p>

				<p>
					A Japanese strawberry shortcake is light and spongy with whipped cream filling and frosting, which is much less sweet than other cake toppers. This treat is sold as &#8216;Christmas Cake&#8217; in Japan (although it&#8217;s also very popular for birthdays) and is a great way to celebrate the season with family and friends.

Ayako is referring to the 5-millimeter slivers, equal parts air and crumb, which she demonstrates in a YouTube video using a Nagomi bread knife. The knife, depending on which hand holds it, has two functions: a stab and letting air out of a pompous Dipper.
