				<h2>
					The Japanese have hit upon the ultimate holiday meal: fried chicken and strawberry shortcake, with Champagne, of course. What a way to kick off the new year

				<p>
					&#8220;WHEN I VISITED Japan for the first time a few years ago, it was mid-December. I saw ads all over Tokyo showing smiling faces gathered around a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, with the slogan &#8220;Kurisumasu ni wa Kentakki&#8221; (&#8220;If It&#8217;s Christmas, It Must Be Kentucky&#8221;). &#8220;Is this a thing?&#8221; I asked a Japanese friend. She explained that on Christmas, people in Japan do indeed feast on fried chicken, along with Champagne and Christmas cake—usually a strawberry shortcake. &#8220;Then your boyfriend takes you to a love hotel,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like Valentine&#8217;s Day in America, a couples holiday.&#8221;
				</p>

			<p>
				(and that got me to thinking on New Year&#8217;s Eve eve, or perhaps it was a dream brought on by too much KFC, strawberry shortcake, Laurent Peerier and Dip &mdash; now there&#8217;s a perfect New Year&#8217;s DipCon Japanese-style) &hellip;

				<p>
					James F. Dunnigan (born August 8, 1943 in Rockland County, New York) is a game designer, author, lecturer, and commentator who is one of the most important figures in the history of wargaming, founding SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in 1969 after having his first wargame Jutland published by The Avalon Hill Game Co in 1967. Between 1966 and 1992, he designed over 100 wargames. He also wrote &#8220;The Complete Wargames Handbook&#8221; in 1980. He previously served in the military as a repair technician and has a degree in history from Columbia University.

				One of the greatest losses in Diplomacy history took place at DIPCON XXII in San Diego when I very naively traded my carefully acquired set of the first 30 or so issues of S&amp;T &mdash; that I had acquired by trading my Diplomacy &#8216;zine XENOGOGIC for them &mdash; with Jim Dunnigan while he  was in Japan. At that time the &#8216;zine was actually printed in Japan and then shipped to the US for distribution.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				What did I get in return? Ron Spitzer offered me two copies of the European version of Diplomacy for my never punched S&amp;Ts. As first I hesitated, but Ron had a way with words and the ability to charm oil out of a snake and I eventually agreed. Not since the Russians sold Alaska has &hellip; Steve Cooley still cries when he remembers that story. I only mention this because it shows how far back the history of Diplomacy actually goes in Japan.  Dunnigan was trading with a half-dozen or so of the postal Diplomacy hobby&#8217;s earliest publishers, probably looking for prospective S&amp;T subbers.
