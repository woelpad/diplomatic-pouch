				<h3>
					How To Celebrate Christmas In Japan
				</h3>
				
				<h3>
					By Alicia Joy
					<br>Tokyo Writer: 23 April 2018
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					&#8220;Christmas in Japan is a fun, festive time of year. Since there are few Christians in the country, none of the religious connotations associated with Christmas were brought over from the West, and it isn&#8217;t a national holiday. However, many of the things traditionally associated with Christmas – festive trees in the shopping malls, Christmas markets, and LED lights – make an appearance, as well as a few unique traditions that are purely Japanese.&#8221;
				</p>

				(and that got me to thinking on New Year&#8217;s Eve eve, or perhaps it was a dream brought on by too much KFC, strawberry shortcake, Laurent Peerier and Dip &mdash; now there&#8217;s a perfect New Year&#8217;s DipCon Japanese-style) &hellip;

				<p>
					James F. Dunnigan (born August 8, 1943 in Rockland County, New York) is a game designer, author, lecturer, and commentator who is one of the most important figures in the history of wargaming, founding SPI (Simulations Publications, Inc.) in 1969 after having his first wargame Jutland published by The Avalon Hill Game Co in 1967. Between 1966 and 1992, he designed over 100 wargames. He also wrote &#8220;The Complete Wargames Handbook&#8221; in 1980. He previously served in the military as a repair technician and has a degree in history from Columbia University.

				One of the greatest losses in Diplomacy history took place at DIPCON XXII in San Diego when I very naively traded my carefully acquired set of the first 30 or so issues of S&amp;T &mdash; that I had acquired by trading my Diplomacy &#8216;zine XENOGOGIC for them &mdash; with Jim Dunnigan while he  was in Japan. At that time the &#8216;zine was actually printed in Japan and then shipped to the US for distribution.
			</p>

			<p>
				What did I get in return? Ron Spitzer offered me two copies of the European version of Diplomacy for my never punched S&amp;Ts. As first I hesitated, but Ron had a way with words and the ability to charm oil out of a snake and I eventually agreed. Not since the Russians sold Alaska has &hellip; Steve Cooley still cries when he remembers that story. I only mention this because it shows how far back the history of Diplomacy actually goes in Japan.  Dunnigan was trading with a half-dozen or so of the postal Diplomacy hobby&#8217;s earliest publishers, probably looking for prospective S&amp;T subbers.

			<h2>
				BUT WHERE TO HOST OUR EVENT?
			</h2>

			<p>
				Dip venues are famous in Japan.  Here are three from Tokyo, one from somewhere else.  Can you guess?
			</p>

			<div class="centered">
				<img class="image" src="../images/queen_elizabeth.jpg">
			</div>

			<p>
				Love hotels are part of Japan&#8217;s tradition, and the Queen Elizabeth is regarded as the most popular of them all. It&#8217;s not because of the great service, but more because of its wacky design. At 92 the Grand Old Dame would be proud!
			</p>

			<div class="centered">
				<img class="image" src="../images/sunburst.jpg">
			</div>

			<p>
				Ground prices are sky high in Tokyo, so every square meter counts, even if they&#8217;re not square. Triangular buildings, where two streets meet at a sharp angle, can be found all over the city. This one, the Sunburst in Meguro, takes the cake by virtue of the giant red ball attached to it like an oversized tumor.

				AND WHO SHOULD THE HOST AND TOURNAMENT DIRECTORS BE?

				<h3>
					The Greatest New Year&#8217;s Menu on the Planet
				</h3>
				
				<h3>
					By Gabriella Gershenson
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					&#8220;WHEN I VISITED Japan for the first time a few years ago, it was mid-December. I saw ads all over Tokyo showing smiling faces gathered around a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, with the slogan &#8220;Kurisumasu ni wa Kentakki&#8221; (&#8220;If It&#8217;s Christmas, It Must Be Kentucky&#8221;). &#8220;Is this a thing?&#8221; I asked a Japanese friend. She explained that on Christmas, people in Japan do indeed feast on fried chicken, along with Champagne and Christmas cake—usually a strawberry shortcake. &#8220;Then your boyfriend takes you to a love hotel,&#8221; she said. &#8220;It&#8217;s like Valentine&#8217;s Day in America, a couples holiday.&#8221;

				<h3>
					Is Boston Cream Pie the World’s Most Delicious...Cake?
				</h3>
				
				<h3>
					By Gabriella Gershenson
				</h3>
				
				<p>
					&#8220;HAVING GROWN up in Massachusetts, I am no stranger to Boston cream pie. Indeed, it was a fixture of my childhood. In local supermarkets, there they&#8217;d be, stacks of Boston cream pies on a table in the bakery department, protected in see-through plastic containers and slapped with a sticker proclaiming a great deal ending in .99. True to its classic form, the dessert consisted of two layers of sponge cake, a thick center of yellow cream and a chocolate-frosted top. 
				</p>

				<p>
					A Japanese strawberry shortcake is light and spongy with whipped cream filling and frosting, which is much less sweet than other cake toppers. This treat is sold as &#8216;Christmas Cake&#8217; in Japan (although it&#8217;s also very popular for birthdays) and is a great way to celebrate the season with family and friends.
