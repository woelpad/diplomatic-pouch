				INTRO
			</h3>

			<p>
				2018 was not a great year for the publishers, authors or the kind of readers who like the kind of books I do. Still, if you dug through enough dirt you could find the occasional diamond in the rough or a real gem.  I’ve got a baker’s dozen examples for you.
			</p>

			<p>
				Why do authors and readers keep going back to the same old subjects (people, places, events)…? The answer is simple: because we are churning out authors and readers faster than we are creating new people, places and events to write about.
			</p>

			<p>
				“If this is a subject that you are passionate about; then this is a book that belongs on your book shelf.”  So obvious, but so true.  I remember discussing this with some French Dippers and one of them mentioned that the average Frenchman owns 90 books, the average literate Frenchman owns 300, and the younger generation just has an internet link to Wiki, Google, FB and Flickr --- it’s all they think they need.
			</p>

				<b>The Best History Books of 2018:</b> Can we mine the past for clues that explain the present? That's the central theme of many history books in 2018, as writers and historians, academic and popular alike, attempt to uncover and recount the stories that say something about the state of the world today. But what about tomorrow?  After all, isn’t history nothing more than premature futurology?
			</p>

			<p>
				The increased popularity of historical fiction a/k/a alternative realities a/k/a “The what ifs…” is due to one fact: it is easier to write a work of historical fiction than a real history book.
			</p>

			<p>
				Here’s the way Wiki tells the story:
			</p>

			<blockquote>
				<p>
					“<b><i>If the South Had Won the Civil War</i></b> is a 1961 alternate history book by MacKinlay Kantor, a writer who also wrote several novels about the American Civil War as it actually happened. It was originally published in the November 22, 1960, issue of Look magazine. It generated such a response that it was published in 1961 as a book.
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The book is written in the manner of a history text published in the alternate reality of 1961 and describing the developments of the past century, in which the Confederate States of America had existed as a separate nation-state. It includes numerous footnotes and quotations from various (fictional) historical writings. 
				</p>
				
				<p>
					The book had a considerable influence on the development of the subgenre of American Civil War alternate histories, one of the two most frequent subjects of American alternate history. Later writers of such books, such as Harry Turtledove, explicitly stated Kantor's influence on their own work.”
				</p>
			</blockquote>

			<p>
				I know. I read the article, played the game, bought the book and was hooked for life.  Apparently I wasn’t the only one.  The fans of Kantor’s book quickly discovered James Dunnigan’s 1958 game “Gettysburg” and brought the Civil War and board gaming to a whole new generation.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>The decline of science fiction’s influence on Diplomacy:</b> The passing of Comic Con co-founder <a href="http://www.folkartsrarerecords.com/news/lou-curtiss-remembrance-and-celebration-nov-18th/">Lou Curtiss</a>, and Jerry Pournelle, reminds me to remind you that a lot of early Dippers were sci-fi, chess and other board game fans long before Dip came along.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>The Other Great War:</b> Cambridge vs. Harvard Universities and their Presses doesn’t get the publicity of some other wars but in its own way it is just as important and, in the long term, perhaps more so.  After all, these two are duking it out not only over what history books will be published but in what language. The quality of content, expertise of authors, physical size, financial cost and Cambridge or Harvard imprint practically guarantees a book on WWI will become a best seller and a highly reviewed work.
			</p>

			<p>
				<b>Amazon’s “Look Inside!” feature, a preview of some of the book’s contents:</b> If you don’t use it already get in the habit. It can save you buying a book that won’t hold your interest or teach you something new. This is an easy way to keep up with new books or new editions of old books as they appear.
			</p>

			<p>
				The Death and Resurrection of John Le Carre (1 new novel,  2 new reviews after years of silence) came as a shock to many who thought he’d died.    In 2017 he published his first George Smiley book in 27 years “A Legacy of Spies”.  Now comes word that next year he will be publishing his 25th book, “Agent Running in the Field” at age 87.  John le Carre is back... His next novel will be out in 2019. “Agent Running in the Field” will feature a 26-year-old character. It is not George Smiley.
			</p>

			<p>
				I’m also eagerly  waiting for Seymour Hersh’s forthcoming book on Dick Cheney.
			</p>

			<p>
				A new book about Mussolini is taking Italy by storm. Not everyone is pleased. We report from Rome.
