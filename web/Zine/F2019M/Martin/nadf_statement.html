			<p>
				A Statement from Chris Martin (outgoing President) and Siobhan Nolen (incoming President) of the North American Diplomacy Federation (NADF) on disciplinary proceedings following allegations of misconduct against Mr. Eric Grinnell at the most recent WDC, October 4-6 2018, hosted by the Potomac Tea and Knife Society.* 
			</p>

			<p>
				In October 2018 Mr. Grinnell was ejected from the tournament by its director, Peter Yeargin.  Subsequently, Mr. Grinnell’s conduct was reviewed by the board of the NADF, and deemed to merit referral to the NADF Community Standards Committee.  Per Section C, (1), of <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pn74yxSJ3hSVOL8HOuzoGjrSrp8h__AZmJpjbE6vI8s/edit">NADF Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Proceedings</a>, <i>“Community Standards Protocol,”</i> such a committee was formed.
			</p>

			<p>
				This Conduct Committee, consisting of volunteers Randall Lawrence-Hurt, Siobhan Nolen, and Jorge Zhang, was charged by the NADF with the purpose of reviewing allegations of misconduct against Mr. Grinnell and, if such misconduct was confirmed, determining whether additional sanctions were appropriate in accordance with the NADF Code of Conduct and the good of the Hobby at large.
			</p>

			<p>
				After an extensive review, On February 11, 2019, the committee concluded:
			</p>

			<div style="margin-left: 20px">
				<strong>
					<p>
						Eric Grinnell did violate the NADF Code of Conduct at the most recent WDC in Tempest. Specifically, he violated provisions 1 and 2 of the CoC; he failed to treat other participants with respect, and he disrupted the ability of other participants to enjoy themselves.
					</p>
					<p>
						Mr. Grinnell has expressed no remorse or intention of changing his behavior in the future. He has variously denied his behavior occurred, denied that it was as bad as it has been characterized, alleged that other players have behaved in similar fashion in the past and not faced consequences, and alleged the existence of a conspiracy against him. It is the hope of this Committee that this investigation has been impartial enough to persuade him that it was not the result of a conspiracy, and that facing consequences for his actions will convince Mr. Grinnell that certain types of behavior are not appropriate at NADF-sanctioned events. We believe Mr. Grinnell can be a valuable and welcome member of the NADF community; we also believe, however, that before that happens, he will need to address his past behavior, think carefully about his effect on others, and resolve to change his behavior in the future.
					</p>
					<p>
						Based on our review, we recommend Mr. Grinnell’s NADF tournament-going privileges be revoked for one year, to be reinstated effective January 1st, 2020. The suspension, if enacted, should bar Mr. Grinnell from any Diplomacy-related NADF activities for the year. That includes participating and helping, but also attending. 
					</p>
				</strong>
			</div>

			<p>
				After the review and recommendation of the Code of Conduct Committee, Section D of the NADF Code of Conduct and Disciplinary Proceedings calls for a review of the findings by a Tournament Committee consisting of a representative from each NADF-recognized event which has taken place within the past 24 months.
			</p>

			<p>
				The following Tournament Directors (in place in 2018) reviewed the committee’s findings & recommendation:
			</p>

			<ul>
				<li>Adam Silverman (Whipping)</li>
				<li>Alan Levin (Massacre, TotalCon)</li>
				<li>Bill Hackenbracht (Liberty)</li>
				<li>Bryan Pravel (WeaselMoot, CodCon)</li>
				<li>Chris Brand (Cascadia)</li>
				<li>David Hood (DixieCon)</li>
				<li>David Maletsky (Carnage)</li>
				<li>Peter Yeargin (Tempest)</li>
			</ul>

			<p>
				On February 14th, more than ⅔ of the TD’s above ratified the committee’s recommendation.  
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Accordingly, Mr. Grinnell is not permitted to attend any NADF-sanctioned tournaments until January 1, 2020.  </strong>
			</p>
