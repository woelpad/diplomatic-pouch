As in the game of Go, Diplomacy openings can be analyzed and tabulated
for specific regions of the board. In Go these opening patterns
are called <I>joseki</I>, and many books of <I>joseki </I>have
been published. <B>The Diplomatic Pouch</b> already has its own
library of Diplomacy <I>joseki</I>
in the <A HREF="/Online/Openings">Diplomacy Openings Library</A>.
<P>
The Go literature also describes and catalogues the best tactical
moves for specific positions which arise frequently. These are
called <I>tesuji</I>, and are the focus of the present article.
I have tried to collect all of the practical tips and tricks that
might help you reach that next level of tactical play.
<H4><CENTER><HR><I>A player can advance beyond Intermediate by mastering
all of these tricks,<BR>
or beyond Beginner by comprehending many of the tricks.<BR>
--Jamie Dreier</I><HR></CENTER></H4>
<P>
Many of these tactics are simple, but I felt that there was a
gap between the expert commentary I read in the Diplomatic Pouch
and some of the tactical missteps I have witnessed in the games
I play. Whatever your level, I hope you'll find something of value
inside.
