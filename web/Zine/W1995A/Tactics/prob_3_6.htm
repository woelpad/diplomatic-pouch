<H4>Answer to Problem 3 (part 6) </H4>
<P>
If you remember, we said that the order B -&gt; A didn't protect
A because &quot;any units which could protect A by supporting
B -&gt; A could just as easily support A directly.&quot; This
is true, but what if those other units were foreign, and didn't
know that A would be supporting something else? Maybe they think
that A is moving somewhere else. It might be possible to trick
a country into supporting B -&gt; A even though they wouldn't
be willing to support A directly.
<P>
Here's an admittedly contrived example. England is about to be
attacked by Russia. Russia is going to support himself into the
North Sea while cutting any potential support from Edinburgh.
England is allied with Germany, but he cannot help. Only France
can help protect the North Sea.
<P>
The problem is, France doesn't want to help. Not unless England
backstabs Germany, that is. France will support Edinburgh to the
North Sea (thereby keeping it from Russia) if the North Sea will
attack Holland.
<P>
England appears to have no choice, so he agrees to go along with
France's plan. But Perfidious Albion is subtle as well as treacherous!
Knowing the French support will protect the North Sea, he orders
the North Sea to support Germany against Russia!

<P>
The point is that while the French fleet <I>could have</I> supported
the North Sea to hold, he didn't know that it would be holding.
In fact, if he had known that it would be holding, he wouldn't
be offering his support at all.
<P>
<!--  Of course, in this example, the North Sea support
Uh, something was here, I imagine, but I don't know what!  And I
removed a single line way up at the top of this file that was:
bounced,
I don't think that went here!
<P> -->
Is anyone still with me? I hope you've had as much fun with Manus's
question as I have. I can certainly see why it's his favorite!
