<H3><A NAME="ForwardRetreat">The &quot;Forward Retreat&quot;</A>
</H3>

<P>
By working with an ally, it is sometimes possible to intentionally
dislodge your own units to achieve a &quot;forward retreat.&quot;
While you are not allowed to dislodge your own units, there is
nothing to prevent an ally from doing so. This can be very useful,
since you can choose where to retreat <I>after</I> all of the
other players have moved. In Example 2.1, Italy can only defend
Naples or Tunis, but not both. Austria and Turkey are allied against
Italy, and Austria wants very much to take a supply center this
turn (it is Fall). By using a forward retreat, Austria can assure
his success:
<H4>Example 2.1 </H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Austria: Fleet Ionian Sea HOLD. (*dislodged*) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The dislodged Austrian fleet can retreat to whichever port Italy
fails to defend.
<P>
But Italy has a trick you must watch out for. By lending &quot;unwanted
support&quot; to the Austrian fleet, he can prevent it form being
dislodged!
<H4>Example 2.2 </H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Turkey: Fleet Greece SUPPORT Fleet Aegean Sea -&gt; Ionian Sea.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Austria: Fleet Ionian Sea HOLD. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Italy: Fleet Tyrrhenian Sea SUPPORT AUSTRIAN Fleet Ionian Sea.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Unfortunately for Italy, it is easy to block this defense too.
The support will be void if the fleet is ordered to move:
<H4>Example 2.3 </H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Turkey: Fleet Greece SUPPORT Fleet Aegean Sea -&gt; Ionian Sea.
<BR>
Turkey: Fleet Aegean Sea -&gt; Ionian Sea. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Austria: Fleet Ionian Sea -&gt; Naples. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Italy: Fleet Tyrrhenian Sea SUPPORT AUSTRIAN Fleet Ionian Sea.
(*void*) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
If Austria doesn't want to move to Naples (or Tunis), then he
can order his unit to Greece or the Aegean Sea instead. Either
of these moves is sure to fail, but prevents Italy from supporting
the Ionian Sea to hold. Whatever you do, you must not hold, since
then Italy's support might succeed.
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="WaitToRetreat">Retreating is Sometimes Better than
Moving</A> </H3>

<P>
If you know that you're going to be dislodged and you don't have
a clear escape route, it may be better to hold and wait to be
dislodged. Then when you choose where to retreat you have the
advantage of seeing your opponent's moves. Furthermore, trying
to escape during the movement phase may create a standoff that
reduces your options for retreating.
<P>
In Example 2.4, Austria knows he will be dislodged from Munich,
but wants to push through the opening in the German lines to threaten
the Lowlands. If he blindly charges into the Ruhr, then he might
bounce with the army in Burgundy. Since you can't retreat to a
space where a standoff has occurred, he would be forced to retreat
back toward Austria.
<H4>Example 2.4 </H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Germany: Army Burgundy -&gt; Ruhr. (*bounce*)<BR>
Germany: Army Berlin -&gt; Munich.<BR>
Germany: Army Silesia SUPPORT Army Berlin -&gt; Munich. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
On the other hand, if Munich simply holds and waits to be dislodged,
then he will be able to retreat to Burgundy or Ruhr, whichever
Germany has left open. The general rule is to be careful of creating
standoffs when you know you might have to retreat, since a standoff
would allow one enemy unit to block you from two spaces at the
same time.
<P>
Note that moving to Burgundy would also be safe, but doesn't offer
any real advantage in this example (you never know, Germany might
not throw you out of Munich after all). If the situation were
slightly different and the German fleet was in Denmark instead
of Kiel, then it might make sense to attack Kiel instead. By bouncing
Denmark in Kiel and then retreating to either Ruhr or Burgundy,
the army in Munich is effectively making two moves in a single
turn!
<P>

<H3><A NAME="DelayDisbanding">Delay Disbanding until Adjustments</A>
</H3>

<P>
Don't disband a unit which is forced to retreat if you know you'll
have to remove it in the immediately following adjustment phase.
By keeping the unit through the retreat phase, you make it harder
for the other players to plan their own builds. Even if it seems
completely irrational that you would retain an isolated unit at
the expense of another unit back home, it is still possible that
you would do so. Players who are near elimination are the least
likely to behave rationally (since it is not clear what constitutes
&quot;rational&quot; play in a hopeless situation anyway).
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="DisbandAndRebuild">Disband and Rebuild Instead of
Retreating</A> </H3>

<P>
On the other hand, if you won't have to remove units in the adjustment
phase, then it may be better to disband the unit and rebuild it
elsewhere. You can essentially teleport a unit back home, where
it might be better positioned for defense.
<P>
In Example 2.5, Italy is sure to capture Spain, but France wants
to be sure to occupy Marseilles so as to be able to defend it
next turn. But there is no need for Burgundy to support Spain
to Marseilles, since if the move fails France can disband the
unit and rebuild it in Marseilles anyway. It's as if the move
to Marseilles were guaranteed. This frees the army in Burgundy
to do something else this turn, such as attack Belgium.

<P>
Another reason to disband and rebuild is simply to hide your intentions
a little while. Let's suppose a unit is forced to retreat after
a Fall turn and you wish to retreat to one of your home supply
centers. By disbanding and rebuilding in that same spot you make
it harder for the other players to plan their own builds. Or you
might change your mind about where to build after seeing the other
players' retreats.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/rules.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Rules" HEIGHT="24" WIDTH="24">
Note that unlike retreats, there is no rule saying that you can't
build in a supply center where there was a standoff during the
movement phase.<!-- (Open question for would-be game designers: Should
there be?) -->
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="ConvertingUnits">Converting Fleets into Armies</A>
</H3>

<P>
If you have fleets or armies which you no longer need, it is generally
difficult to convert them to the other kind of unit. If Russia
and Turkey are allies, then the Southern Russian fleet is often
of little value. Similarly, after conquering England, the attackers
may find themselves with an excess of fleets.
<P>
There are two basic ways you can trade old units in for shiny
new ones. The first is to have an ally dislodge the unit so you
can disband it and rebuild it, as we saw in the previous section.
You may even hope to have an enemy dislodge you by failing to
protect the unit.
<P>
The other approach is to &quot;borrow&quot; a supply center for
a year (either from a willing accomplice or an unwilling one).
The new center lets you raise a unit of the desired type, and
when the debt is repaid you remove the other, undesired unit.
You can reverse the order of these events by &quot;lending&quot;
the supply center for a year instead of &quot;borrowing&quot;
it. The choice depends on whether you or your ally can spare a
unit for a year.
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="KeepHomeSCsOpen">Keep Home Supply Centers Open for
Builds</A> </H3>

<P>
If you're anticipating a build, be sure to keep your home supply
centers open. If you want to build a fleet, make sure that a coastal
supply center will be open. This may seem obvious, but it sometimes
requires planning ahead. In certain situations you can use a self-standoff
to defend a supply center while leaving it open.
<P>
Conversely, if your enemy is anticipating a build, try to arrange
for their home supply centers to be occupied. Italy can often
prevent Austria from building another fleet by simply keeping
a unit in Venice and being a little vague about its intentions.
The mere threat of hopping over to Trieste in the Fall may cause
Austria to occupy it himself, blocking any possible fleet build.
<P>
If you can take the fighting to your enemy's homeland, you are
likely to interfere with his ability to build new units.
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="DestroyingUnits">The Value of Destroying a Unit</A>
</H3>

<P>
Sometimes it is especially valuable to destroy an enemy unit instead
of merely dislodging it. A unit which has pushed out far from
its homeland is more valuable to your opponent than one back at
home, so it is especially worth destroying. (This is similar to
the concept in Chess that if you trade an undeveloped piece for
a developed one then you are ahead by however many moves went
into developing that piece.)
<P>
If your opponent's home centers have been captured or are occupied,
or he already has a backlog of unused builds, then any units that
you destroy won't come back for a long time, if ever. Destroying
a unit in a Spring turn is better than in a Fall turn, of course.
<P>
The flip side of this argument is that some units are not as valuable,
and can be given risky assignments which might allow them to be
destroyed. 
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="WaivingBuilds">Waiving Builds </A></H3>

<P>
Sometimes it's better not to build a unit, even when you're able
to. For example, if Russia intends to attack England and gets
two builds, it might be better to build one fleet in St. Petersburg
(North Coast) and waive the other build. This allows him to build
another Northern fleet next year, even if he gains no new centers
in the meanwhile.
<P>
A pending build can also be a good deterrent against a potential
backstab. Rather than building a unit to sit at home, you can
waive a build. Should the attack come, you can build the right
kind of unit in the best position for defense. And if it doesn't,
you can build the most appropriate unit for some new offensive.
<P>
Since it's usually quite difficult to remove a unit once you've
built it, you should consider waiving a build rather than building
the wrong kind of unit.
