<H4>Answer to Problem 3 (part 1) </H4>
<P>
You may be thinking that the attack on A could help defend A if
additional units were supporting the move:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
Country1: Unit A SUPPORT &lt;something&gt;.<BR>
Country1: Unit B -&gt; A.<BR>
Country1: Unit C SUPPORT B -&gt; A.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This is true, but C could have just as easily supported A to hold,
which would have been just as effective. Any unit which can support
B -&gt; A can also support A to hold, so unit B's order does not
add any value.
<P>
What other purpose could the order to unit B serve?
