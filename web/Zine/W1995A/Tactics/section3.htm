<P>
Since a convoy isn't disrupted by an attack that fails to dislodge
the convoying fleet, the fleet can in essence attack a coastal
province while holding a body of water at the same time. Two moves
for the price of one!
<P>
In Example 3.1, what is the best way for France to attack Piedmont?
Any support from the Gulf of Lyon is likely to be cut, so you
must support the attack from Marseilles. Attacking with the fleet
is sure to succeed, but won't threaten Venice and will probably
let Italy occupy the Gulf of Lyon. It is much better to use a
&quot;leapfrog&quot; attack, convoying the army from Spain with
support from Marseilles.

<H3><A NAME="OneOnOneFleets">One-on-One Fleet Tactics</A> </H3>
<P>
In both the Black Sea and the Baltic region, you often find yourself
with a single fleet opposing a single enemy fleet. In this situation,
it is important to recognize that you can never dislodge an enemy
fleet at sea with only a single fleet of your own. Therefore,
you won't be able to make any headway against the enemy fleet
unless it withdraws voluntarily. Your enemy would be wise to consider
very carefully before doing this, since it often can't be undone!
<P>
The only options, then, for singleton fleets are to attack the
other fleet, support into a coastal province or convoy. Attacking
the other fleet is usually unsuccessful, but safe. Supporting
is likewise usually unsuccessful since the enemy fleet will probably
attack you. Convoying, however, is often an excellent option,
since there is no risk of the convoy being disrupted. Cutting
supports from coastal provinces is also possible, but beware of
being helped ashore by your opponent!
<P>
In this example, the only sure way to take Prussia requires attacking
with the German fleet. Unfortunately, the Russian fleet would
almost certainly advance to the Baltic Sea where it would be unassailable.
Since attacking this way is too risky and supporting is probably
futile, convoying is a good idea. Here is one possibility:

<P>
The German army in Livonia is devastating! Note that this is an
example of a no-risk move for Germany. If it works, Russia's fate
is sealed. If it doesn't then the status quo will be maintained.
Another possibility would be to convoy to Prussia, supported by
Berlin and Silesia. This is another instance of the &quot;leapfrog&quot;
attack we saw in the previous example.

<H3><A NAME="ConvoyParadox">The Convoy Disruption Paradox</A>
</H3>
<P>
The basic Diplomacy rules of convoys, supports and cutting of
supports can fairly frequently produce paradoxes, such as the
one shown in Example 3.3.

<P>
Does the convoyed attack cut the support, thereby protecting the
convoy? Or does the supported attack disrupt the convoy, preventing
the support from being cut? Both possibilities seem plausible.
The original Avalon Hill (1976) rules resolved this particular
case by asserting that &quot;a convoyed attack does not protect
the convoying fleets.&quot; Specifically, the rules state:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>If a convoyed army attacks a fleet which is supporting a fleet
which is attacking one of the convoy fleets, that support is not
cut.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This resolves the issue for simple cases like this one.
<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="SecondOrder">The Second-Order Paradox</A> </H3>
<P>
Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of it. There are more complicated
cases of essentially the same problem, which aren't covered by
the 1976 wording. Example 3.4 shows a &quot;second-order&quot;
convoy disruption paradox where there are two convoys which are
protecting each other's fleets (not their own).

<P>
Do both convoys succeed, or are both fleets dislodged? Again,
both possibilities seem plausible. By analogy with the first-order
case, one would assume that both fleets should be dislodged. However,
it is worrisome when we are resorting to analogies instead of
rules.
<P>
Because of problems like this, Avalon Hill amended the rules in
1982 to specify a more general solution to these problems. The
new rules state:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>If a convoyed army attacks a fleet which is supporting a an
action in a body of water; and that body of water contains a convoying
fleet, that support is not cut.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This change handles both the first-order and second-order paradoxes
shown above as we would expect.

<H3><A NAME="Nightmare">The Game Designer's Nightmare</A> </H3>
<P>
Unfortunately, some may feel that the cure provided by this rule change
may be worse than the disease. Example 3.5 shows a case
which was never ambiguous, but has been altered by the new rule.

<P>
What happens in the Mid-Atlantic ocean? Under the original rules,
the attack on Spain would cut its support, causing the convoy
in the Mid-Atlantic Ocean to be disrupted. The fact that the attack
on Spain is by a convoyed army was irrelevant.
<P>
Under the new rules, however, the support (of an action in a body
of water containing a convoying fleet) would not be cut, and the
Mid-Atlantic convoy would succeed. This remains true even if the
army in Marseilles supports the attack on Spain, thereby dislodging
it.
<P>
Some maintain that this result is illogical, and
that the original rules were better in this case. What's really
unfortunate is that the cases the new rules mess up are probably
more common than the pathological cases they were meant to fix.
<P>
<i>Note that The Pouch's e-mail and Web-based adjudicator,
<a href=/dpjudge>The DPjudge</a>, uses this rule (see <a href=#DPjudge>below
for more details</a>),
but is also able (by use of a specific game flag) to resolve
convoy paradoxes
using a different rule as well.</i>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="TheJudgeRules">The Ken Lowe Judge's Convoy Rules</A> </H3>
<P>
The Ken Lowe PBEM judge tries to get the best of both worlds, but it does
so at the expense of simplicity.
<i>
<OL>
<LI>Normal non-convoyed movement cuts support.
<LI>Any armies being convoyed by fleets that would be dislodged
without further support cuts are flagged &quot;maybe no convoy&quot;.
<LI>Any convoyed armies without the &quot;maybe no convoy&quot;
status cut support provided by units in their destination provinces.
<LI>Any armies being convoyed by fleets that still would be
dislodged are flagged &quot;definitely no convoy&quot;.
<LI>Any armies still flagged &quot;maybe no convoy&quot; status
cut support of units in their destination provinces. The &quot;maybe
no convoy&quot; status is cleared.
</OL></i>
<P>
For all you computer programmers out there, this should be clear
as crystal! The rest of you will probably need to work through
a few examples to get it straight. You'll find that the judge
rules get both the first- and second-order cases right without
the unpleasant side-effects of the 1982 rules.
<P>
So is this the final word on this topic? I doubt it. There are
probably even more obscure cases where the judge rules don't produce
the &quot;correct&quot; result (assuming everyone even agrees
what the most reasonable result is). But they do seem to be a
workable solution for at least the medium-term.
<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="PandinsParadox">Pandin's Paradox</A> </H3>
<P>
Just when you thought all of these convoy paradoxes were behind
us, up pops Pandin's Paradox. This one is even more unsettling
than the previous ones.

<P>
Like the original example (3.3), the convoyed army is trying to
cut a support directed against the convoying fleet. But this time,
that attack is actually defending the convoying fleet by standing-off
an equally well supported attack. If the convoy is assumed to
succeed, then the convoy ends up being disrupted. Conversely,
if the convoy is assumed to fail, then the convoy isn't disrupted!
<P>
In the ordinary convoy disruption paradox there are two possible
resolutions, each of which is self-consistent -- the difficulty
is choosing between them. In Pandin's paradox there are two possible
resolutions, neither of which is self-consistent!
<P>
Both the original and revised Avalon Hill rules result in the
support not being cut by the convoyed attack, even though this
results in the convoy not being disrupted. The judge rules, on
the other hand, result in both the support being cut and the convoy
being disrupted. The judge rules could be brought into line with
the Avalon Hill rules in this case by changing step 2 of the process
slightly to read:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>2) Any armies being convoyed by fleets that would be dislodged
<B>depending on whether further supports are cut</B> are flagged
&quot;maybe no convoy&quot;.</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
This makes this step blind as to whether the convoyed attack is
cutting a support which is attacking or defending the convoying
fleet.
<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="DPjudge">The DPjudge Resolution</A> </H3>
<P>
The Pouch's <a href=/dpjudge>DPjudge</a> resolves
the paradoxes by implementing the 1982 rule.
That is, a convoyed army <u>cannot</u> cut a support that is offered
in defense of or for an attack on the position of any convoying fleet --
<b><i>not even if the army <u>dislodges</u> such a supporting fleet.</i></b>
(All other supports are cuttable as normal, but supports directed against a
convoying fleet cannot <u>ever</u> be rendered cut by a convoying army.)
<P>
This rule nicely resolves the paradoxes, leaving the only possible
(though rare) inconsistency <a href=#Nightmare>described in Example 3.5</a>
that a valid support which establishes a convoying fleet as a beleaguered
garrison could be offered
by a dislodged fleet.  More information can be found in the
<a href=/dpjudge/docs/faq.cgi>DPjudge
Common Questions list</a>.
<P>
<HR>
<H3><A NAME="AmbiguousConvoys">Ambiguous Convoy Orders</A> </H3>
<P>
The 1976 Edition of Diplomacy states that ambiguous convoy routes
are allowed, but if <I>any</I> of the possible routes is disrupted,
then the army is not convoyed. Apparently the motivation was to
make players choose a specific convoy route, but without penalizing
players who write confused, but nonetheless intelligible orders.
<P>
The 1982 Edition modified this rule so that the convoy succeeds
unless <I>all</I> routes are disrupted.. This change adds a new
tactical element to the game by permitting backup convoy routes.
<P>
The current judge rules essentially correspond to the 1976 rules
by forcing players to specify the convoy route in their orders.
Thus there can be no ambiguity. However, I suspect this choice
was made to avoid complexity in the judge programming, and not
because of a strong preference for the 1976 rules. It would certainly
be possible to implement the revised rules instead (although there
are probably better things to work on). Would this be better?
Does anyone care? Has anyone ever seen a situation where a backup
convoy could have made a difference?

In this contrived example, Italy increases the likelihood of a
successful convoy in face of uncertainty about his neighbors'
intentions. Realistically, though, supporting one fleet with the
other would usually be a better choice.

The only cases where this strategy fails and the other succeeds
is if France attacks with support and Turkey cuts the support
from the Ionian Sea without dislodging it.

<HR>
<H3><A NAME="BlockadingGibraltar">Blockading Gibraltar </A></H3>
<P>
Here's a simple position that everyone should know. England (or
any Northern naval power) can permanently blockade Gibraltar using
only three fleets. No conceivable attack from the Mediterranean
can ever break through. The only possible way to get though is
to build a fleet in a Northern port to assist in the attack.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
England: Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean HOLD.<BR>
England: Fleet Portugal SUPPORT Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean.<BR>
England: Fleet Irish Sea SUPPORT Fleet Mid-Atlantic Ocean.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The fleet in the Irish Sea could also be in the North Atlantic
Ocean or the English Channel instead. Even if the enemy has fleets
in Spain (South Coast), the Western Mediterranean and North Africa,
they cannot break through.
<P>
This position is one of the simplest examples of a stalemate line
-- a position which can never be broken through. They are particularly
useful for countries that cannot win, but that want to assure
themselves of a place in any draw. Over 50 different stalemate
positions have been catalogued in <A HREF="/Online/StalematesAtoY">Stalemates A to Y</A>,
which has now been republished in <I>The Diplomatic Pouch</I>.
See Robert Bryan Lipton's &quot;<A HREF="/Online/StalematesAtoY/northern-progressive.htm" >A Series of Progressive Northern Stalemate Positions</A>&quot;
for a detailed discussion of this particular position.
