<P>
Rick Desper has pointed out that the example given isn't quite
air-tight. There is <I>another</I> order which can be given to
Venice to prevent Piedmont from supporting it to hold. Venice
can be ordered to Albania via the Adriatic Sea. The convoy will
fail since the Adriatic Sea isn't ordered to convoy, but any support
of Venice will still be rendered void.
<P>
This development doesn't change the fact that it may be useful
to order a unit to move into one of your own units which is supporting
something else. It merely means that there may be other ways to
accomplish the same thing. (In fact, the whole example can be
moved inland to avoid this loophole.)
<P>
On the other hand, I have found an entirely different example
which illustrates a <I>different</I> reason why such an order
could be useful....
