Austria: Army Tyrolia -&gt; Venice.<BR>
Austria: Fleet Adriatic Sea SUPPORT Army Tyrolia -&gt; Venice.

Italy : Army Apulia SUPPORT Army Rome -&gt; Naples. <BR>
Italy: Army Venice -&gt; Apulia. (*bounce, dislodged*)

<P>
If Venice moves to Tyrolia, then Piedmont might support that move,
creating a standoff. If Venice moves to Tuscany or Rome, then
Venice wouldn't be dislodged and Italy wouldn't get a build. Similarly,
if Venice moves to Piedmont, Piedmont might move to Tuscany and
Venice would again not be dislodged. If Venice moves to Trieste
then Austria is sure to take Venice, but he will not be able to
build a fleet because Trieste is occupied.
<P>
Therefore, the <I>only</I> safe move for Venice is to Apulia,
which relies on the fact that you cannot cut your own support.
The move to Apulia is safe precisely because it has no effect
on any other units. Its only effect is to prevent France from
supporting Venice to hold.
<P>
So there you have it. The final word on Manus's &quot;favorite
question.&quot; Or is it?
