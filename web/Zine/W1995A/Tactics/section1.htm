<H3><A NAME="SelfStandoffs">Self-Standoffs</A> </H3>

<P>
We'll start with a simple tactic that everyone should be familiar
with -- the self-standoff. In Example 1.1, France hasn't yet occupied
Spain on a Fall turn and is wary of Germany's intentions. He must
therefore prevent Italy from taking Marseilles while at the same
time wishing to remain in Spain and Burgundy.
<H4>Example 1.1 </H4>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
France Army Spain -&gt; Marseilles. (*bounce*)<BR>
France: Army Burgundy -&gt; Marseilles. (*bounce*) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
The self-standoff guarantees that Italy cannot enter Marseilles,
and also holds Spain and Burgundy whether Piedmont attacks Marseilles,
holds or moves back to the East.
<P>
Unfortunately, most Diplomacy players can vividly remember the
first time their opponent upset their self-standoff by lending
&quot;unwanted support&quot; to one of their own moves instead
of attacking!
<H4>Example 1.2 </H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Italy: Army Piedmont SUPPORT French Army Spain -&gt; Marseilles.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
France Army Spain -&gt; Marseilles.<BR>
France: Army Burgundy -&gt; Marseilles. (*bounce*) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Using this trick, Italy has denied France the build for Spain,
and furthermore prevented her from building a fleet in Marseilles!
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="UnwantedSupport">Unwanted Support</A> </H3>

<P>
The previous example showed how you can use unwanted support to
disrupt an opponent's self-standoff. But there are also many other
situations where an unexpected support can alter the results of
your opponents' moves.
<P>
In Example 1.3, Russia has told Austria that he intends to attack
Turkey. Austria hopes to take advantage of this situation by attacking
Warsaw while Russia is distracted in the South. In order to make
sure the sneak attack goes according to plan, Austria lends unexpected
support to one of Russia's moves.
<H4>Example 1.3 </H4>

<P>
Without the support from Rumania, the army in the Ukraine might
bounce in Sevastapol and would then be able to defend Warsaw next
turn.
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="UncuttableSupports">Look for Uncuttable Supports</A>
</H3>

<P>
Whether you're on the offensive or on the defensive, one of the
first steps in analyzing a position is determining which supports
can be cut and which cannot. You need to be able to find the uncuttable
supports at a glance, since they are the pillars your plans will
rest upon.
<P>
In Example 1.4, Italy is trying to take Trieste using the following
(faulty) logic: &quot;I have two supports and so does he, but
I can cut one of his, so I will win.&quot;
<H4>Example 1.4 </H4>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Austria: Army Vienna SUPPORT Army Trieste.<BR>
Austria: Army Trieste HOLD.<BR>
Austria: Fleet Albania -&gt; Adriatic Sea. (*bounce*) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Unfortunately, Italy hasn't looked closely enough. The support
from Tyrolia is reliable (because Vienna can't cut it and support
Trieste at the same time), but the support from the Adriatic Sea
is not. It can be cut from Albania. If Italy wants to be assured
of taking Trieste this turn, he must use the uncuttable support
from Venice instead of the unreliable one from the Adriatic Sea.
Unfortunately, this means that Italy must take Trieste with his
fleet instead of one of the armies, which will probably slow further
progress. That is the price of the guaranteed move.
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="AttackingYourself">Defending a Space by Attacking
It Yourself</A> </H3>

<P>
An effective way to defend a space you occupy is to attack it
with your own units. If your enemy also attacks the space, then
the unit is protected by the &quot;beleaguered garrison&quot;
rule. If your enemy does not attack, then you are protected by
the rule that prevents your from dislodging your own units.
<P>
A frequent advantage of this approach is that the attacking units
can be behind the front line. This frees the unit on the front
line to attack without concern for defending itself.
<P>
In Example 1.5, Turkey has agreed to support the Russian army
in Galicia to Budapest. Having mastered the previous topic, you
quickly note that a support from Serbia cannot be cut, but a support
from Trieste could be. Therefore, Turkey supports the attack from
Serbia and uses Trieste to cut any possible Austrian support from
Vienna. This leaves open the possibility of an attack on Trieste,
so Turkey attacks Trieste himself from Albania and the Adriatic
Sea. Finally, Venice cuts a possible second support against Trieste
from Tyrolia. This assault cannot be stopped!
<H4>Example 1.5 </H4>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Be sure to contrast this result with the more obvious defense
of Trieste -- supporting it in place. Since Trieste cannot attack
Vienna while being supported in place, it must rely upon adding
a second support to the attack on Budapest. Isn't adding another
attacking support as good as cutting one of the defender's supports?
No, because the support from Trieste is itself vulnerable to being
cut, whereas the cutting of Vienna's support cannot be prevented.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
There are a couple of very important generalizations here. First,
the act of cutting a defender's support is a guaranteed move,
whereas the act of supporting an attack may be vulnerable to being
cut.
<P>
Second, you should think about using the units that are most exposed
to the enemy to attack or to cut supports; those that are partially
exposed to support your attack; and those behind the lines to
protect the others. This is the simplest recipe I know for finding
a good set of attacking moves quickly.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/rules.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Rules" HEIGHT="24" WIDTH="24">
Remember that self-dislodgment is not allowed even if some of
the attacking or supporting units are foreign. Players often misinterpret
the rules in this area. The one exception is that if the foreign
forces <I>alone</I> are strong enough to capture the space, then
the attack succeeds. (This is to prevent a defender from turning
an otherwise successful attack upon himself into a forbidden self-dislodgment
merely by adding his support to it.)
<P>
<HR>

<H3><A NAME="DislodgedSupport">A Dislodged Unit's Support is Always
Cut</A> </H3>

<P>
Although you normally can't cut a support of an attack directed
against yourself, any unit that is dislodged has its support cut.
Therefore you <I>can</I> cut a support into yourself <I>if</I>
you dislodge the supporting unit.
<P>
In Example 1.7, Russia has agreed to support Serbia to Budapest.
Albania will cut any possible support from Trieste. But what happens
if Budapest supports Trieste to Serbia?

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
Because Serbia's attack on Budapest dislodges it, Budapest's support
into Serbia is cut and Trieste does not capture Serbia. Note,
however, that this tactic can be very dangerous, since it relies
on the <I>successful</I> dislodgment of Budapest (ordinarily cutting
a support is a guaranteed thing). If Russia fails to order the
support as anticipated, then disaster ensues.

Instead of capturing Budapest, Turkey now loses Serbia!
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/rules.gif" ALIGN="BOTTOM" ALT="Rules" HEIGHT="24" WIDTH="24">
There is one exception to this rule (in the 1982 rules only).
A convoyed army doesn't cut supports given by certain fleets,
and these supports aren't cut even if the fleet is dislodged.
See the section on <A HREF="section3.htm#Nightmare">Convoy Disruption Paradoxes</A>.

<H3><A NAME="AttackYourAttacker">The Only Defense May Be to Attack
Your Attacker</A> </H3>

<P>
If you can't defend a unit by supporting it in place or by cutting
the attacker's support, you may still be able to defend the unit
by supporting it into the attacker's space.
<P>
In Example 1.9, England wants to defend Brest from a French attack.
He cannot support his fleet in Brest because the support will
probably be cut; he can't cut the French support from Paris; nor
can he attack Brest himself with other units. The only defense
that blocks the French attack is to attack the attacker right
back!

<P>
Although Belgium does not border Brest and cannot support Brest
to hold, it does border Picardy and can therefore support Brest
to attack Picardy. If the attack does indeed come from Picardy,
this is just as good.
<P>
If France does not attack as expected, Brest may actually advance
to Picardy, so England must also defend Brest from the Mid-Atlantic
Ocean.
<P>
Note that if France supports his attack from Picardy instead of
Paris, then the support will still be cut because the fleet in
Picardy is dislodged (as we saw in <A HREF="#DislodgedSupport">Example 1.7</A>):

</H3>

<P>
There are at least five different ways to defend a unit which
is being attacked. Make sure you don't overlook the more obscure
options!
<OL>
<LI><B>Offer defensive supports</B>. Use your adjacent units to
support the attacked unit to hold. Make sure your supports can't
be cut. The attacked unit cannot move (but may support or convoy).
<LI><B>Cut attacking supports</B>. Use your nearby units to attack
the units you expect to support the attack. You may have to guess
which enemy unit will attack and which will support. Your attacked
unit is free to move if you are sure that all attacking supports
will be cut. Otherwise it will need defensive support as well.
<LI><B>Attack the space yourself</B>. Use your adjacent units
to support another adjacent unit into the attacked space. The
attacked unit is free to move. (see <A HREF="#AttackingYourself">Example 1.5</A>)
<LI><B>Dislodge an attacking support</B>. Cut an attacking support
by dislodging it with the attacked unit. The support is only cut
if the attacked unit actually dislodges the supporting unit. (see
<A HREF="#DislodgedSupport">Example 1.7</A>)
<LI><B>Attack your attacker</B>. Use units adjacent to the attacker
to support the attacked unit into its attacker. (see <A HREF="#AttackYourAttacker">Example 1.9</A>)
