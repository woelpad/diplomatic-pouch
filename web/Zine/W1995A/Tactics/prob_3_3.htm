<H4>Answer to Problem 3 (part 3) </H4>
<P>
Here's a real-world situation where an order with no effect is
useful.
<P>
Italy and Austria are allied against France. France is about to
descend on them with an armada of fleets, so Italy and Austria
need to build two new fleets immediately. It is a Fall turn, and
neither Austria nor Italy will get any builds as it currently
stands (Italy owns Tunis). How can Italy and Austria be assured
of building one fleet each?

<P>
Italy can clearly gain a new fleet in Rome by recapturing Naples.
Austria could also build in Trieste if he gained another supply
center, so Italy must give him Venice. But if Italy gives up Venice,
he won't get a build unless the army in Venice is also destroyed.
Therefore the task at hand is to assure that Venice is destroyed
no matter what France does.
<P>
The problem is that if Venice simply holds, then Piedmont might
support Venice to hold and the plan would fail. So Venice must
move somewhere -- anywhere -- to prevent France from supporting
the unit to hold. But where can Venice safely move without potentially
interfering with the plan?
