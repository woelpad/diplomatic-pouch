<H4>Answer to Problem 3 (part 2) </H4>

<P>
Still having difficulty? I'll give you a clue. Let's make a list
of what we know about the order B -&gt; A:
<OL>
<LI>The order will always fail. This is because of the rule prohibiting
self-dislodgement. Even if a foreign power supports the move,
it will still fail.
<LI>The order does not cut the support being given by A.
<LI>The order by itself does not protect A. Any units which could
protect A by supporting B -&gt; A could just as easily support
A directly. 
</OL>

<P>
In sum, the order B -&gt; A <I>does not affect A at all!</I>
<P>
So if the order B -&gt; A doesn't affect A, what possible use
can it have? It turns out that the move can be useful precisely
because it is guaranteed <I>not to have any effect!</I>
<P>
I think it's time for a more concrete example....
