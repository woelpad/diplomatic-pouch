<H3>Introduction</H3>
In this article I present statistics on non-orphaned postal and CompuServe
games.  The analysed games have been culled from <i>Everything</i> #83
(January-December 1990) through <i>Everything</i> #92 (June 1995).
Games played over America OnLine and Internet networks are excluded, in
the former because the sample size (eleven games) is too small.
A game is considered orphaned if it had more than one GameMaster and/or
if it was GM'ed in more than one zine.  However a game which
had one GM and which appreared in two or more zines is not considered to
be an orphan game if the name change in zines is "cosmetic"
[the change is considered to be cosmetic if the publisher either changes
the name of the zine but the "nature" of the zine remains, more-or-less,
the same (for example, <i>The Boob Report</i> to <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>)
or if the publisher converts smoothly from non-warehouse to warehouse
(for example, <i>Penguin Dip</i> to <i>Black Tie Affairs</i>).
<H3>Presentation of Statistical Data</H3>
Table 1 provides basic statistical data on the games, using the
indicator functions introduced in <a href=/Zine/F1995M/Nelson/Dropout.html>an
earlier article</a>.  In that article, I
analysed non-orphan games reported in <i>Everything</i> #85
(May 1992) through <i>Everything</i> #88 (September 1993).
The survey size in this earlier article was 112 postal games and 28
CompuServe games.
<P>
There is little difference in the statistics in the
earlier article and the current article, suggesting that there has been
little, or no, change in postal (CompuServe) Diplomacy in recent years.
Although the win number has decreased very slightly since the earlier article
(where it was 49% and 46% for postal games and CompuServe games respectively),
this change does not appear to be significant;
the dropout number has decreased slightly, but again this does
not appear to be significant,
(2.86&plusmn;1.65 and 2.07&plusmn;1.36 for postal and CompuServe games,
respectively);
the length number has slightly decreased since the
first survey, the figures are
1910&plusmn;3.45 and 1909.75&plusmn;3.44 respectively for postal and
compuserve games; the QR ranking
for postal games has increased from 3.50 to 3.77, whilst that for
compuserve games has decreased from 4.71 to 4.58.

<P>
Table 2 contains the percentage Calhamer points gained by each
power in non-orphaned games. In interpreting such data we normally have
to worry about how significant any differences are (are the differences
due to random fluxs?); in this case it is clear
that there are considerable differences between results of postal games and
results played on CompuServe; Italy is underachieving in CompuServe
games, scoring a dismal 3.75%.
<P>
What I find fascinating about this is how
little Austria is benefiting from Italy's under-achievement.
The beneficiaries are Germany (+3.95%), France (+2.73%),
Austria (+0.52%), and England (+0.49%).  Note that Russian Calhamer
Point Score has hardly been affected (-0.007%).

The win number for postal and CompuServe games are very similar:
48% and 43.7%.  Is there any difference in the type of draws achieved
in the two mediums?  To answer this question, Table 3 contains
the Draw Spectrum for each
medium.  Clearly the spectra are distinct, there have been no "large"
(5-way or greater) draws in CompuServe games and, most importantly,
just over three draws in four on CompuServe are two-way.

<H3>Discussion</H3>
Suppose a group of Diplomacy players is randomly distributed into two
groups.  One plays postal Diplomacy and the other
plays over CompuServe.  Does the medium of play affect
how long it takes to play the game?  If the average gamelength varies
significantly with the medium then this variation might
be sufficient to explain any differences in Calhamer Point scores for
the seven powers.
For example,
games which finish "quickly" are more likely to see Russian, rather than
Turkish, wins, so that in a survey of quickly finished games, Russia would
score higher, and Turkey lower, than in a survey based on all games.
<P>
If the number of original players who drop out is significantly different
between the two mediums than this might cause a difference in the
structure of results.  One might expect that in games with
a larger number of dropouts there are smaller draws, either because standby
players are more willing to concede draws to the original players, who are
fewer in number, or because the original players, who are fewer in number,
have better positions because they have not NMR'ed.
<P>
In <a href=/Zine/F1995M/Nelson/Dropout.html>my earlier article</a>, I
analysed how the result of postal games varied with
the number of original players to drop from the game.  The data was scattered
but
when presented in the form of rolling averages suggested that games with
fewer dropouts (0-2 and 1-3) and large number of dropouts (5-7) were
less likely to end in a win than games with an "average" number of dropouts
(2-4, 3-5, and 4-6).
<P>
Table 1 shows that there is negligible difference in the average
game length in postal (1909.80&plusmn;3.89)
and CompuServe (1909.26&plusmn;3.00) mediums.
Any difference in
Calhamer point scores can not be explained on the basis of differing
game lengths.  In addition,
Table 1 shows little difference in the number of
dropouts between the two mediums (2.6&plusmn;1.54 for postal and
2.02&plusmn;1.30 for CompuServe).  The number of wins is
slightly lower for CompuServe games (43.7% against 48.0%) and this
is consistent with the analysis of my earlier article (assuming that we
can move from
a discrete to continuous analysis). However, the distribution of
draws is opposite to that expected:  the medium with fewer dropouts has
an increased number of small-way draws.
<P>
Italy is considered by many to be the most difficult power to play,
and this suggests an explanation for the dismal performance of Italy in
CompuServe games: Is the selection of postal and CompuServe players
equally random?
<P>
Many postal players played Diplomacy face-to-face prior to entering
The Hobby.  For those not having FTF experience, the
"long" deadlines of postal play provide an opportunity to study the
rulebook, to study the game position, and to play through suggestions mentioned
in correspondence.  In addition, there is the opportunity to
play through games reported in zines that the player receives and
to analyse current positions -- this is
particularly easy these days since so many zines print game maps.
<P>
From my involvement in the Internet Diplomacy
community, I know
that there are Internet players who start playing only days
(perhaps hours!) after discovering Diplomacy.  Internet deadlines
are "quick;" there is less time to study a position and to consider
correspondence.  In theory, it is easier to get complete games to play
through; in practice, I believe most players (particularly beginners)
pay no attention to games other than those in which they are playing.
In particularl, this
means that absolute novices do not look at other games.  In theory,
Internet players have access to more games than postal players; in practice
they access fewer games than postal players -- they do not access
games unless they are playing.  This means that a complete beginner has
nothing to go on -- this would certainly explain some of the strange and
bizarre openings that have been reported!
<P>
I suspect that something similar happens on CompuServe.  It is almost too
easy for an absolute novice to enter a game, with no exposure to other games
and no expectations.  As a consequence the "standard of play"
in CompuServe games is lower than that in postal games,
and the power which is the hardest
to play (Italy) fares worse.  However, it is difficult to believe that this
could account for such a dramatic decline (-7.48%) in Italy's performance.
<P>
It is not presently
possible to explain the poor performance of Italy in
CompuServe games.  What is required is a more in-depth survey of CompuServe
games: is Italy scoring poorly because it is being eliminated unusually
early in the game?  Is Italy reaching four centers and then remaining
static for the rest of the game?  Is Italy surviving until the endgame but just
not scoring results? An analysis based on supply center count variation during
the course of each game would be required to answer these questions.
<P>
Whatever the explanation for Italy's poor performance, is it possible
to explain that the main beneficiaries of weak Italian play are
France and Germany?  It would be more logical if the main beneficiaries
were Austria and Turkey, and perhaps Russia.
<P>
In making the comments that I have made,
I am assuming that each power has an intrinsic
strength which is independent of the player pool. An analysis of
British postal games played since 1969 shows that the relative
strength of the powers has been constantly evolving.  Two
explanations are usually offered for this behaviour: Diplomacy statistics
have often been widely reported in British zines, so the fact that one
power has done well in the recent past results in it performing relatively
poorly in the recent future, and, since the British Hobby is fairly compact,
new ideas in "opening theory" are rapidly disseminated.
<P>
Whilst fluxs of this kind could account for "small" differences
between postal and CompuServe results, they can not account for the large
difference observed. I can only conclude that CompuServe players just don't
know how to play Italy!
<P>
As noted above,
the draw spectrum for CompuServe games is very different to that for
postal play.
My anecdotal explanation for this, which I noticed whilst entering
data from <i>Everything</i>, is that
CompuServe games are not DIAS.
Although I haven't examined any CompuServe
game positions, I believe that
CompuServe players are agreeing to two-way draws prematurely. They are
agreeing to draws when there is still play left in the game.  If the standard
of players on CompuServe is lower than that in postal games then it may be
the case
that players are not aware of minority stalemate lines.  Additionally,
small powers may not be using the threat to throw the game to gain larger
draws.
<P>
I noted in my earlies article that it would be interesting to examine
the effect that DIAS rules have on game results, I also commented that
it is difficult to know which zines ran DIAS games.
Without knowing the house-rules of the zines, it is still possible to gain
an approximate insight into the DIAS effect.
Although a draw which includes all survivors
has not necessarily been played to DIAS rules, a draw which excludes one,
or more, survivors is obviously not DIAS.  By examining the number of
survivors not included in the draw it is possible to gain an insight into
the difference between DIAS/no-DIAS games.  At the moment, my databases do not
include this information (I didn't know it would prove interesting!). At a
later date I hope to add this data and examine the DIAS/no-DIAS divide.
<H3>Conclusion</H3>
From Table 1 and the discussion above,
I conclude that differences in results between postal and
CompuServe games are not due to differences in the time taken to complete
the game and the number of dropouts.
<P>
Any firm conclusions drawn from the data presented in this article are likely
to be controversial.  At first sight it appears that CompuServe players
aren't up to the task of playing Italy, but the poor Italian results
may be a result of strategic failure on the part of other powers.
Austria is not greatly benefiting greatly from Italy's dismal performance,
Russia appears not to be touched by it, and Turkey appears to be
slightly suffering -- it may be that Compuserve players don't know how to
play Austria, Italy, Russia, <b>and</b> Turkey!
<P>
The draw spectrum?  CompuServe players are weak-willed and easily
dominated; they do not have the fighting spirit, preferring to head home
for an early bath rather than to fight to the last breath.  Shame on them.
Shame.
