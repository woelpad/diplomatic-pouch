<h2>The Diplomacy<br>Programming Project</H2><H1>
The Combinatorics<BR>Of Adjustments</h1>
<h2><i>Danny Loeb</i></h2>
</table>
<hr><p>
<blockquote>
<i>After the Fall moves have been played, and the
retreats (if any) made, each player's number of
units must be adjusted to equal the number of
supply centers his Great Power controls.</i>
</blockquote>
<a href="/Zine/F1995R/Loeb/ret.html">Last issue</a> we discussed 
the complexity of the search problems posed to the computer diplomat
by the retreat  
phase in the game of diplomacy. In comparison, how difficult a problem
is posed by winter adjustments (builds/removals)?
To measure this problem, we analyze the worst-case scenario that
a potential computer diplomat might face.
<p>
An initial version of the adjustment portion of the strategy finder 
of the Bordeaux diplomat was written by Brian Chojnowski (University
of Illinois, Champaign-Urbana). 
Some alternate algorithms were proposed by Jean-Michel Faure (Bordeaux) and 
Per Westling (Linkoping, Sweden). 
The current version  programmed by Gilles Schaeffer
(Bordeaux, ENS/Paris) is presented below. We conclude with possible 
future developments.
<h2>Search size</h2>
The difficulty of a search problem is proportional to the number of
the choices. 
<p>
As we have seen there are 4,430,690,040,914,420 significantly
different Spring 1901 openings in Diplomacy.  Searching completely
such a large space 
 is an impossible task that grows worse in successive
movement phases as a typical game of Diplomacy progresses.
<p>
On the other hand, a typical retreat phase involves only a small
number of units with limited interactions, and tightly constrained
movements. We can thus make a complete search of all possible retreats
combinations. (Actually, we don't really consider all combinations,
since "independent" retreats are optimized separately in order to gain
time for a 2 or 3-ply look-ahead in our search.)
<h2>How many removals are possible?</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>
If he has
fewer centers than units, he must disband the
excess units only, by removing them from the
board. The units removed may be any of his units
he chooses.
</i>
</blockquote>
A player can have any number <i>n</i> of units up to 17. He may then be
required to remove <i>k</i> of them where <i>k</i> is some number
between 0 and <i>n</i>. He can remove any <i>k</i> he wants.
He can remove no more and no less.
<p>
Thus, the number of choices is exactly the binomial coefficient
<i>n</i>!/<i>k</i>!(<i>n</i>-<i>k</i>)! as given in the table below.

</pre>
<p>
By inspection we see that the largest number of choices, namely
<b>24,310</b>, 
arises when a 17-unit superpower is forced to remove roughly half of
his forces.
<h2>How many builds are possible?</h2>
<blockquote>
<i>
If he has more centers than units, he
<b>may</b> build units by placing them, one in each
unoccupied supply center, in his home country only
(provided that such supply centers are still under
his control). He must specify a fleet or an army
in a coastal supply center 
(if Russia builds a	
fleet in St. Petersburg, he must specify the coast
on which it is to appear, or the build is
invalid).
</i>
</blockquote>
The number of builds possible will vary depending upon:
<ul>
<li> Up to how many units may be built,
<li> How many centers 0-3 are available for builds (0-4 in the case of
Russia), and
<li> Whether or not they are coastal (or bicoastal in the case of St. Petersburg).
</ul>
Since we are computing maximal numbers of build possibility, we can
ignore
the possibility that a center is occupied or
owned by another power, and thus unavailable for a build.
<h3>Turkey, England, Italy</h3>
These powers have three coastal centers.
<ol> 
<li> 2 + 2 + 2 = 6 choices for one build.
<li> 2x2 + 2x2 + 2x2 = <b>12</b> choices for two builds. (18 counting waives)
<li> 2x2x2 = 8 choices for three builds. (<b>26</b> counting waives)
</ol>
<h3>Two coastal centers: France, Germany</h3>
These powers have two coastal centers and one inland.
<ol>
<li> 2 + 2 + 1 = 5 choices for one build.
<li> 2x2 + 2x1 + 2x1 = <b>8</b> choices for two builds. (13 counting waives)
<li> 2x2x1 = 4 choices for three builds. (<b>17</b> counting waives)
</ol>
<h3>One coastal centers: Austria</h3>
These powers have one coastal centers, and two inland.
<ol>
<li> 2 + 1 + 1 = 4 choices for one build.
<li> 1x1 + 2x1 + 2x1 = <b>5</b> choices for two builds. (9 counting waives)
<li> 2x1x1 = 2  choices for three builds. (<b>11</b> counting waives)
</ol>
<h3>Russia</h3>
Russia has 2 inland centers, a coastal center, and a bicoastal center.
<ol>
<li> 1 + 1 + 2 + 3 = 5 choices for one build.
<li> 3x2 + 3x1 + 3x1 + 2x1 + 2x1 + 1x1 = <b>17</b> choices for two builds. (22 counting waives)
<li> 3x2x1 + 3x2x1 + 3x1x1 + 2x1x1 = <b>17</b> choices for three builds. (39
counting waives)
<li> 3x2x1x1 = 6 choices for four builds. (<b>45</b> counting waives)
</ol>
Russia has the most choices to consider for its builds. Up to <b>45</b>
counting waives when it has 4 builds.
<p>
Occasionally, it may be in a countries interest to waive a build that
it might otherwise be able to use to create a new unit. For example,
Austria might save a build in order to build one fleet now and one
fleet next year.  
Since our program can only look-ahead one or two phases at a time, it
is unable to anticipate any advantages that 
waiving a build might bring next year. Thus, we do not even consider
doing so unless so 
required by diplomatic constraints (eg. demilitarized zones) imposed
by the negotiation module.
Not counting waives then, Russia still has the most choices (<b>17</b>) when
it has 2 or 3 builds.
<h2>Open problem</h2>
The total size of the search space is given by the product of the 
number of the choices available to each player. How can we maximize
that?
<p>
Other than the share combinatorial challenge of tackling such a
problem, there are practical implications of answer.
It may be acceptable to write a diplomat that occasionally submits
poor moves. However, it is unacceptable to write a diplomat that hangs
for decades in certain rare situations trying to compare all  the
possible build combinations.
<p>
If the total search space can bounded by a reasonable number, then
we can apply symplex methods to the resulting game matrix and find
all of the Nash equilibria. However, if the total search space is too
large, then (at least in some circumstances) only approximative
methods may be practical.
<p>
So just how bad <i>can</i> things get?
<p>
The "obvious" solution of having two 17-unit powers each lose 8 supply centers
does not work, since we must also assign 16 units to capture their
centers. Also, note that a power must have 3 (or 4) units to control 
all of its supply center (as we assume above).
<p>
One possible solution with over 11 billion combinations is the following

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
Even in the example given above, it might be possible to 
program a computer to consider all of the possibilities.
However, the time available for an adjustment phase is severely
limited and we also want to anticipate possible Spring moves 
while planning our builds.
<p>
Our current strategy finder calculates winter orders 
in two steps.
<ol>
<li> First, a good move is found sequentially for each country using
an algorithm by Brian Chojnowski.
<li> Second, moves are optimized with respect to
each other using a simulated annealing algorithm by Gilles Schaeffer
similar to that used in the movement phase.
</ol>
<h3>Preliminary Search</h3>
First, optimal adjustments are found for each country under the
simplifying assumption   
that the builds or removals of each country do not drastically effect
those of another country.
<p>
This assumption allows us to calculate the builds and removals for
each country independently. For each country, we consider all the
possible combinations or builds and removals, and chose the option
that maximize the value of the  resulting position. This value
may be calculated  directly by the position evaluation
subprogram. Or if sufficient time is available, the values may be
calculated  via a recursive call to the strategy
finder itself so that the diplomat can anticipate the Spring moves
while planning its Winter adjustments. 
<p>
However, the adjustments of one country <i>can</i> affect those of
another.  
<ul>
<li> If Italy suspects France will build a fleet in Marseilles then he
should build a fleet in Rome or Naples.
<li> If Turkey suspects that Italy will build a fleet in Naples as
part of a <i>Lepanto</i>, then he might want to build a fleet in
Smyrna, but if he suspect that Russia will build a unit in Sevastopol
then he might prefer to build another fleet in Ankara.
</ul>
Nevertheless, the results of the above search produce reasonable
winter orders based on the consideration independently of all of the
options for each country.
<p>
That is, each country finds the best adjustment for its alliance under
the (false) assumption that all other countries will skip their
adjustment phase.
<h4>Possible Improvement</h4>
Calculate the adjustment of country <i>i</i> under the assumption that
only countries <i>i</i>+1  through 7 will skip their adjustment phase.
This may produce slightly better orders for country 7.
This would be especially helpful if we arrange for country 7 to be 
our country. (We should note however that the strategy finder
as currently implemented has no knowledge about what country we play. 
The strategy finder simply finds the best moves for all countries
based on diplomatic constraints.)
<h3>Secondary search</h3>
If time is limited, for example if this search is part of 
a recursive search, then the results of the preliminary search 
are taken as final.
<p>
Given additional time, our strategy finder will attempt further
improvements using simulated annealing.
Each country is considered successively an random modifications
of its adjustments are proposed until time runs out.
The modifications are adopted if the resulting position is better for
the country in question given the adjustments currently being
considered by the six other powers. 
As the search progresses, we assume that the moves being considered
are practically optimal, and we therefore modify smaller and smaller
subsets of adjustments orders at a time.
<h4>Possible Improvements</h4>
<strong>1. Combined Search</strong><P>
These two phases of search could be combined as follows.
<ol>
<li> For each country, let new list be its list of legal adjustment orders
(subject to diplomatic constraints), and let old list be an empty
list. Let <i>n</i> be 7 times the length of the longest new list.
<li> Let <i>P</i> be the position on the board given the first set of
orders on each countries new list.
<li> Remove the first set of orders from each countries new list, and
place it in old list.
<li> Let <i>C</i> be Austria.
<li> If <i>C</i>'s new list is empty, then go to step 15.
<li> Let <i>b</i> be the first set of orders on <i>C</i>'s new list.
<li> Consider the position <i>P'</i> obtained by replacing <i>C</i>'s
adjustment in <i>P</i> with <i>b</i>.
<li> Evaluate the value of <i>P'</i> for all countries using the
position evaluator (if the <i>flag</i> has not been set) or using a recursive
search (if it has).
<li> If <i>P'</i> is better for <i>C</i>'s alliance than <i>P</i>,
then 
  <ul>	<li>replace <i>P</i> with <i>P'</i>,
	<li>update the value of the currently considered move for all
	countries,
	<li>concatenate the old list to the end of the new list
	for each country, and
	<li>empty list of old moves for each country.
  </ul>
<li> Insert <i>b</i> into <i>C</i>'s old list according to
the value of <i>P'</i> for <i>C</i>'s alliance.
<li> Remove <i>b</i> from <i>C</i>'s new list.
<li> If all new lists are empty and <i>flag</i> is set, then
go to line 16.
<li> If all new list are empty and <i>flag</i> is not set,
then set <i>flag</i>, replace new lists with old lists, and empty old
lists. 
<li> After <i>n</i> iterations, set the <i>flag</i> if recursive
search has been specified.
<li> If time remains, let <i>C</i> be the next country, and go to step
4.
<li> Return first element of each old list with their
values, and halt. 
</ol>
This algorithm combines the two searchs above into a single search.
Each country is guaranteed to consider all of its options. 
Moreover, no one country is especially privileged in its ability 
to anticipate the moves of the other countries.
<p>
Once a country exhausts its list of possible moves, then it stops 
searching until another country changes its mind about its best move.
There is no point considering exactly the same combination of moves
two times. When it resumes searching it will consider moves in the
order of their value as determined in the previous search under the
theory that moves that were good under the prior circumstances are
likely to still be good. 
<p>
If all countries exhaust their lists, then each countries adjustment
is optimal with respect to the adjustments being considered by the six
other countries. We have thus found the "Nash equilibrium" we are
looking for.
<P><strong>2. Mixed Equilibria</strong><P>
Occasionally, Nash equilibria involving pure strategies might fail to
exist. It might be possible to detect an "infinite loop" in the above
search using a hash table, and then use linear programming to find a mixed Nash
equilibrium. 
<P><strong>3. Disband and Build</strong><P>
The 
builds should be redesigned to interface with the retreats in a
multipli 
search so that disbanding a unit and rebuilding it elsewhere is
considered.
This should be done whenever there are units to retreat, and
no removals to consider, and at least one home supply center open. In
that case, the best retreats will be recalculated in each "component"
for various subsets of our units. The best builds will then be
factored in, and the results compared.
<p>
In anticipating the number of builds, we will assume that any unit
which can do so will capture an enemy or neutral supply center with
its retreat. 
<h2>For more...</h2>
In conclusion, the problem of analyzing build combinations is slightly
more difficult than the problem of analyzing retreat combinations, but
child's play in comparison to the problem of analyzing moves. We thus
have programmed the Bordeaux diplomat to conduct a very thorough
search. Nevertheless, in order to leave time to look-ahead at future
phases, this search is not perfect.
<p>
More work could be done on integrating the search for retreats and
builds, and especially on testing the work done so far.
