Bernard Cornwell never played Payola Diplomacy, but you sure wouldn't know it
by reading the above quote, taken from his <i>Sharpe's Revenge</i>.  The
Payola variant, developed by John Woolley and myself, adds Cornwell's
"treasury" to the arsenals of Diplomacy's combatant nations, and the result
is an addicting game with no stalemate lines, multiple levels of intrigue,
and in which even the closest of allies can be actively working against each
other from the first turn until the bitter end.
<p align=justify>
Since its introduction into the play-by-email hobby, Payola has quickly grown
into an accepted and respected variant, with a great many devoted players.
<p align=justify>
This article discusses Payola Diplomacy in depth by annotating (using
hotlinks) the formal rules of the variant.  In this way, the rules of the
game may be read (and printed, etc.) without intrusion by these annotations,
and yet the reasoning behind each rule, examples of play, anecdotes from
actual games, and other interesting tidbits contained in the annotations
are always available.  A further reading of the rules may be necessary to
provide context for some of the annotations, so it is suggested that
<a href=notes.html>the annotations</a>
only be perused after the complete rules have been read.
<p align=justify>
Be sure to also check out the other way-cool appendices, including
<a href="strategy.html">some further reflections on the game</a>
and on <a href="variants.html">other contemplated variants</a>.

<DL>
<DT><H4>1.1 Scope</H4>
<DD><p align=justify><a href="notes.html#name">Payola Diplomacy</a> is played on a normal
Diplomacy board, using the standard Diplomacy rules except as amended
herein.
<p align=justify>
<a href="notes.html#theory">The Payola concept is also easily applied
to other games</a>; application of Payola to other Diplomacy variants
is discussed in <A HREF="#R6">Section 6</A> of these rules.
<DT><H4>1.2 Deviations</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>The modifications that are made to the standard game are summarized
below:
<p align=justify>
<OL>
<LI><a href="notes.html#gm">The play of the game cannot be
accomplished without a GameMaster.</a>  Strictly, this is
only the case in face-to-face games, since in
an Internet game, a computer adjudicator serves the
purpose of this extra human.  Face-to-face games may also
be conducted with<i>out</i> an adjudicator, but only by
sacrificing the important secrecy of the players' bribe offers,
as described below.
<LI>Each player has a bank account, the balance of which is
maintained and adjusted by the GameMaster (or computer
judge).  Rules
regarding these accounts are contained in
<a href="#R2">Section 2</a> of these rules.
<LI>Rather than giving orders for each of hir units, the
players use the monies in their accounts at each turn
to offer bribes to the various units on the board.
These bribes will be used to determine the order that
shall be issued by each unit &mdash; each unit will
always issue the order for which it was offered the
most money, regardless of the origin of the bribe(s)
for this order.  Rules regarding bribes are given in
<A href="#R3">Section 3</a> of these rules.
<LI>To assist in determining the order that will be
issued to a player's unit in case of a high-bid tie,
each player also maintains an "acceptance list."  Rules
regarding acceptance lists are given in <A href="#R4">Section
4</a> of these rules.
<LI>The GameMaster (or computer judge) will issue all movement
phase orders (for
all units) after determining these orders (from the
bribes offered by all players).  Rules governing these
determinations are contained in <A href="#R5">Section
5</a> of these rules.  Note, however, that
<a href="notes.html#retreats">each player shall have
complete and solitary control of his units and their
orders during retreat and adjustment phases</a>.

<DT><H4>2.1 Income</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>Before every Spring movement phase, each power on the board
receives &mdash; added to its bank account &mdash; a number of
"<a href="notes.html#megafrancs">silver pieces</a>" (abbreviated AgP).
This income is termed "taxes" received from each owned supply
center, and the total amount of this income is therefore based
on the number of supply centers controlled by the power.  On
the principle that bureaucratic overhead costs rise as government
expands, the total net tax income is <a href="notes.html#income">a
simple decreasing sequence</a>:
the first supply center owned by a power will generate an income of 17
silver pieces, the second will add 16 silver pieces, the third
will add 15, the fourth 14, etc., etc.  The table below shows
the annual tax revenue received by powers of each size:

Thus, at the beginning of the game, every power starts off with
a bank balance of 48 silver pieces, except Russia, which
starts with 62.
<a href="notes.html#bancmeister">This money is disbursed to the
players by the GameMaster</a>.
<p align=justify>
Any power that begins a game owning <i>no supply centers</i>
but with one or more unit on the board (such as in the
<a href=/dpjudge?page=about:void>Void variant</a>) will receive as
initial funds one-half of the amount that the power would have received
had each unit been supported by an owned supply center.
<DT><H4>2.2 Expenditures</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>Before each movement phase, each power may offer money in the form of
bribes to any or all of the units on the board.  The GameMaster
determines (from all offers made to each unit, and using the methods
specified in these rules) what order each unit will issue, and the
GameMaster is then responsible for issuing all these orders.  All
powers who offered money for any order that is issued will have the
offered amount subtracted from their account at that time.
<DT><H4>2.3 Transfers</H4>
<DD><p align=justify><a href="notes.html#transfer">Players may transfer any amount of money
from their account into the account of any other player</a>, including
that of any eliminated player, by requesting of the GameMaster that
such a transfer be made.
<DT><H4>2.4 Elimination</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>Eliminated players (that is, players owning no supply centers)
may continue to use any money remaining in their
account to influence the remainder of the game, but
if an eliminated player resigns his position, any money remaining
in his treasury is forefeited.
<DT><H4>2.5 Administration</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>The GameMaster shall be responsible for accurately maintaining the
balance of each power's account, making it available to its owning
player on request, and reporting it to that player every time it
changes.

No information concerning account balance or account activity shall be
revealed by the GameMaster to any player other than the owner of the

3. Offers
</H3>
</center>
<DL>
<DT><H4>3.1 Offer Sheets</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>During a movement phase, rather than submitting the order to be
issued for each of their own units, each player submits a single
"offer sheet." An "offer sheet" contains a series of bribe offers,
each of which is made to a specific single unit and given on a
separate line of text.  An offer consists, in order, of:
<p align=justify>
<OL>
<li><font color=red><b>Optionally,</b></font> a repetition count.  This is a positive number
-- followed by an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) &mdash; that indicates
how many times in succession the offer will be repeated.
Repetition is a convenient shorthand
to assist a player in <a href=notes.html#noDupes>scaled offer
reduction</a>.
<LI><b>A bribe amount.</b>  This is any non-negative number (including
zero) of whole silver pieces.
Note, however, that if the bribe is being
offered to a unit that is <b>not</b> owned by the offering
player, the bribe amount must be positive (in other words,
<a href="notes.html#zero">zero silver piece offers to foreign
units are not allowed</a>).
<li><font color=red><b>Optionally,</b></font> <a href="notes.html#plateau">a <i>plateau</i>
amount</a> to be used for this bribe.  As discussed in
Rule 5.5, offers made by the players may need to be reduced
automatically to avoid overexpenditure.  However, a bribe
may be set to reduce no lower than a specific plateau
amount, and then to remain at that amount as long as
possible (decreasing again, eventually to zero if need be,
only when <i>all</i> bribes have reached their plateau and
overexpenditure still exists).  This is done by giving
a pound sign (<tt>#</tt>) followed by the plateau amount.
If no pound sign is given in a bribe, the plateau amount to
which it will reduce is zero.  If a pound sign is given with
no amount following it, the plateau amount is the same as
the bribe amount (no reductions until all bids reach their
plateau).
<li><font color=red><b>Optionally,</b></font> by using a plus-sign (<tt>+</tt>), other
bribe amounts (with optional repetition counts and plateau
amounts) may be given.  This is known as "augmentation".
For example,
<tt>4*3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2*4#2</tt> is a series of two bribe
amounts given using this technique.
<LI><b>A single character indicating the type of the offer.</b>  The
six valid offer types (each is described in full in Rule
3.2) are designated using the colon (<tt>:</tt>), ampersand
(<tt>&</tt>), at-sign (<tt>@</tt>), exclamation point
(<tt>!</tt>), greater-than (<tt>&gt;</tt>), and dollar-sign
(<tt>$</tt>) characters.  If the character is a dollar-sign,
the offer ends at this point; otherwise, it continues.
<LI><b>The unit</b> &mdash; any unit, of any nationality, anywhere on the
board &mdash; to which the bribe is being offered.
<LI><b>A <a href="notes.html#legal">valid, legal order</a> that
could be issued to that unit.</b>
<LI><font color=red><b>Optionally,</b></font> a vertical bar (<tt>|</tt>) character, followed
by another order (<b>only</b> the order part, <b>not</b> a
repetition of the unit description) that could be issued to
that unit.  There is no limit to the number of orders that
may thus be listed in a single offer
<a href="notes.html#noDupes">but no two of these orders
may be identical.</a>
</OL>
<DT><H4>3.2 Offer Types</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>Based on the character appearing after the bribe amount in an offer
(see Rule 3.1, item 5), the offer is one of the six "offer types."
These types are described below.
<p align=justify>
<DL>
<DT><b><i>Direct Bribe</i></b>
<DD><p align=justify>A <i>direct bribe</i>
offer is recognized by the appearance of a colon character
after the bribe amount in an offer.
<a href="notes.html#direct">A <i>direct bribe</i> offer</a>
is a promise to pay the bribe amount if (and
only if) the unit in the offer issues the order (or any one

is mentioned in the offer.
<p align=justify>
<DT><b><i>Negative Bribe</i></b>
<DD><p align=justify>A <i>negative bribe</i> offer is

<b>any</b> order that is <b>not</b> the order (or, if
vertical bars are used, any order that is not <b>any</b> of
the orders) mentioned in the offer.

<b>any order</b> (any order at all) not mentioned in the
offer.
<p align=justify>
<dt><b><i>Savings Request</b></i>
<dd><p align=justify>A <i>savings request</i> is not a bribe, but it appears in
the player's offer list.  It is recognized by the appearance
of a dollar-sign after the monetary amount in an offer.  The
function of a savings request (which contains nothing more
than the amount and the dollar-sign character) is to cause
the given number of silver pieces in the player's treasury to
be <a href=notes.html#savings>"held back" in savings</a>, and
not to be made
available for use in any bribes.  Basically, the sum total
of all savings requests in a player's offer sheet will be
the guaranteed minimum balance in the player's treasury
after all bribes have been paid.
</DL>
<DT><H4>3.3 Multiple Offers and Orders</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>A player may make any number of different offers to each unit in an
offer sheet.
<p align=justify>
Using the vertical bar to separate them, any number of orders to the
same unit may be given in a single offer.  In all but <i>negative
bribe</i> offers, such multiple orders are equivalent to each
order after the first appearing by itself, in sequence, as a separate
<i>direct bribe</i> offer.  In the case of <i>negative bribe</i>
offers, multiple orders separated by vertical bars impose further
restrictions on the promise to pay &mdash; to wit, if <b>any</b> of the
listed orders is issued, the bribe will <b>not</b> be paid.
<DT><H4>3.4 Offers Required</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>Each uneliminated player <b>must</b> submit an offer sheet
containing at least one offer before the GameMaster will determine
and process orders.
<p align=justify>
If, for any specific movement phase, a player does <b>not</b> issue
any offer to one of his own units, a zero silver piece <i>direct
bribe</i> offer from that player for the unit to <tt>HOLD</tt> is
entered for that player by the GameMaster before processing offers.
<DT><H4>3.5 Publication</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>At the conclusion of the game, the GameMaster shall make available to

4. Acceptance Lists
</H3>
</center>
<DL>
<DT><H4>4.1 Acceptability of Different Currency</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>In addition to "offer sheets," the GameMaster will also maintain
a separate
<a href="notes.html#reference">"acceptance list"</a> for each player.
An acceptance list is simply an ordered list of <b>every</b> power in
the game (including the power submitting the list, and including any
eliminated powers).
During the game, the GameMaster shall not reveal the acceptance
list of any power to any other power.
<p align=justify>
If ever a player's unit would receive the same amount of money for
issuing any one of two or more different orders, and no other
order would pay as much, the player's acceptance list is consulted to
decide which order the unit will issue.  The use of acceptance lists to
make this determination is described in full in <a href="#R5">Section
5</a> of these rules.
<p align=justify>
A power specifies its acceptance list to the GameMaster on a single
line of text containing the
word "<tt>ACCEPT</tt>" followed by the single-character
abbreviations, in any order of the player's choosing,
for each of <b>every</b> power in the game (including any eliminated
powers).
<!p>
A player may omit one or more of the other powers from his acceptance
list if and only if the acceptance list contains
<a href="notes.html#randomaccept">exactly one
question-mark</a>.  That question-mark represents a list of
all of the omitted powers; the specific sequence of these
powers will be determined randomly
every time the adjudication of a movement phase begins.
<p align=justify>
The first power listed in an acceptance list is the power which &mdash; in
the eyes of all units owned by the power submitting the list &mdash; is
considered to offer the <b>most</b> preferred currency.  Subsequent
powers in the acceptance list
are considered to offer less and less preferred currency, descending in
preference until the final power listed (which is deemed to hold the
currency <b>least</b> preferred by the units that are owned by the
list submitter).
<DT><H4>4.2 Acceptance Lists Required</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>
An acceptance list must always be on record for each power.
<p align=justify>
Each power begins the game with an acceptance list containing its
own abbreviation followed by a question-mark (indicating that its own
currency takes precedence over that of all other powers, which are
randomly ordered).
<p align=justify>
A power may modify his acceptance list at any time.
It remains unchanged and will be used for all
movement phases after its submission until such
time as the player submits another acceptance list, which shall
then completely replace the earlier list.
<DT><H4>4.3 Eliminated and Unplayed Powers</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>
The acceptance lists for eliminated powers are ignored and unused.
<p align=justify>
Acceptance lists are also not used for powers that are not being
played (so-called "dummy powers").
Instead, any monetary tie that would need to be broken to
determine the order to be issued to a dummy unit is resolved
by having the unit accept its own default offer to <tt>HOLD</tt>,
and reporting (if need be) to the players that it did so in response
to a bribe or bribes totalling one silver piece
greater than the highest total bribe offer that the unit actually
received.

5. Orders

</center>
<DL>
<DT><H4>5.1  Determination by Total Bribes</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>When all offer sheets have been submitted, all non-<i>direct
bribe</i> offers are converted by the GameMaster to <i>direct
bribe</i> offers as described in Rule 3.2.  The <i>direct
bribe</i> offers then are used to form the <b>complete</b> list
of the different <b>orders</b> from which each unit can choose.
All money offered by all players for each of these separate
<b>orders</b> &mdash; including any money offered in <i>negative
bribe</i> offers for which the order meets the stated requirements &mdash;
is then totalled, giving the <i>total
bribe</i> for each order.  If, of the potential orders for a given
unit, <a href="notes.html#det_by_total">the <i>total bribe</i> for
one of these is higher than the <i>total bribe</i> for any and every
single one of the others</a>, this is the order that the unit will
issue.
<DT><H4>5.2 Determination by Acceptance Rank</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>If <b>no</b> single order has a higher <i>total bribe</i> amount than do any
of the other potential orders for that unit, the decision as to which of
those orders involved in the tie will be issued for the unit is made
using the acceptance list of the power that owns the unit in question.
<a href="notes.html#det_by_ref">The bribe offered by the power that,
among all those powers to have
submitted offers for the competing orders, is listed <i>earliest</i>
in this acceptance list, will be accepted</a>; that is, the order for which
that power offered a bribe will be issued.
<DT><H4>5.3 Determination by Sequence</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>If the earliest power (in acceptance list order) that offered a bribe
to a unit in competing orders has offered a bribe for two or more of
these competing offers, <a href="notes.html#det_by_seq">the order that
will be issued is the order
that, among these, appeared earliest in this power's offer sheet</a>
(note that <a href="notes.html#neghold">each <i>negative bribe</i> offer
is considered to appear immediately below the <i>direct bribe</i>
offer to <tt>HOLD</tt> that is "built" from this offer</a>, as
described in Rule 3.2).
<DT><H4>5.4 Determination by Further Acceptance Rank</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>If two or more competing orders have (as the earliest listed
offer submitted by the power described in Rule 5.3) the
<B>same</b> <i>negative bribe</i> offer,
<a href="notes.html#det_by_fr">then the next power down the
unit's acceptance list that offered to contribute to any of the
orders under consideration is consulted</a>.  Using this other power,
Rules 5.2 and 5.3 are applied again (as would be this current rule if
necessary; that is, if the situation described herein is true for the
newly considered power as well, a power even further down the acceptance
list must be consulted).  This procedure does guarantee that a unique
order will be chosen.
<DT><H4>5.5 Overexpenditures</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>The amount a player can <i>offer</i> is <B>not</b> limited by his
account balance.  However, player expenditures are.  Once the order
for every unit is determined (using the process described in Rules 5.1
through 5.4), the total expenditure for each player is calculated.  If
any player would pay more money than he currently has available in
his account (honoring any savings request he has made),
<B>every single one</b> of the offers made by each such
"would-be-overdrawn" player is reduced by a single silver piece.
(However, note that bribes with specified <i>plateau</i> amounts are
not reduced beyond that amount unless it is the case that every bribe
has already reached its plateau and overexpenditure still exists.)
After these reductions,
<a href="notes.html#redecide"><b>all</b> the units that were
subjects of these offers "re-decide"</a> all over again which order
each will issue.  If the same situation occurs again, this procedure
is repeated (subtracting yet another silver piece from the offers of
such player or players), until no player would end up with a negative
balance.
<p align=justify>
Note that although a player's bribe may be reduced to zero,
<a href=notes.html#intent>the fact
that the player had made the offer is still considered</a> for the
purposes of determining the order to be issued in the case of a tie,
according to sections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.

Note that although <i>all</i> of a player's <i>bribe offers</i> are
subject to reduction when the player is in this situation, any

are <b>not</b> reduced.
<DT><H4>5.6 Balance Adjustments</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>When orders are determined, all money offered for each order being
issued is subtracted from the accounts of those players who offered
money for that order.  Money offered for orders that are <b>not</b>
issued stays in the players' bank accounts.
<DT><H4>5.7 Information Revealed</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>When orders are issued, the GameMaster shall report the following
information to each player:
<p align=justify>
<OL>
<LI>the order to be issued by each of the player's own units,
<LI>the amount of the <i>total bribe</i> (nothing, however, about
the origin or origins of the funds) that was accepted by each
of the player's own units,
<LI>a list of the orders for which the player had an accepted
bribe (including the amount of each such bribe),
<LI>the total amount of money expended by the player, and finally,
<LI>the new balance in the player's account.

6. Variations
</H3>
</center><blockquote>
<i>The variants listed below are the major variants that are currently
supported by the
Payola adjudication code.  Each of these variants includes a number of
distinct elements which could be used separately.  For example, the
capability to specify different values for separate supply centers is
mentioned as being used in the Exchange variant &mdash; this capability can be
used in any Payola game set up to allow this.</i></blockquote>
<DL>
<DT><H4>6.1. Payola Classic</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>The game may be played under <a href="orgrules.html">the original
rules to the variant</a>, which would mean the following six
changes to the rules above:
<p align=justify>
<DL>
<DT><B>Rule 2.1</B>
<DD>Powers receive seven silver pieces per year per supply
center controlled.  (Income is <b>not</b> on the diminishing
returns scale described in rule 2.1.)
<DT><B>Rule 3.1</b>
<dd><dl><dt><b>item 1</B>
<DD>Repetition counts are not allowed.
<DT><B>item 2</B>
<DD>Zero silver piece offers to foreign units are allowed.
<DT><B>item 3</B>
<DD>Plateau amounts are not allowed.
<DT><B>item 4</B>
<DD>Augmentation (<tt>+</tt>) is not allowed.
<DT><B>item 5</B>
<DD>The only legal separator in an order is the
colon (<tt>:</tt>).
<DT><B>item 8</B>
<DD>The use of the vertical bar
(<tt>|</tt>) to permit multiple orders to appear in an
offer is <b>not</b> allowed.
</dl>
<DT><B>Rule 3.2</B>
<DD>Only <i>direct bribe</i> offers (colon offers)
are accepted.  All other bribe types are invalid.
<DT><B>Rule 3.3</B>
<DD>Multiple offers to the same unit are <B>not</b>
permitted, and therefore, combining multiple offers to the
same unit using the vertical bar syntax is also not permitted.
<DT><B>Rule 5.3</B>
<DD>This rule is unnecessary, given the above changes.
<DT><B>Rule 5.4</B>
<DD>This rule is unnecessary, given the above changes.
</DL>
<DT><H4>6.2 Application to Map Variants</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>The Payola system is easily applied to map variants such as Loeb-9,
Youngstown, Colonial, etc., etc.  The only necessary modification to
the rules is that the amount of tax income per supply center is
adjusted so that the amount gained from the first center is one silver
piece fewer than the
number of supply centers that is the variant's victory criteria,
and subsequent centers then follow the same "one silver piece less"
tax pattern.
<DT><H4>6.3 Tin Cup Diplomacy</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>Payola Diplomacy is combined with
<a href="notes.html#blind">the Blind variant</a> by making the
following four changes or additions to the rules above.  This variant
is called Tin Cup Diplomacy because it is blind with money, much like
a street-corner pencil salesman.
<p align=justify>
<DL>
<DT><B>Rule 1.1</B>
<DD>The usual
<a href=/dpjudge/?page=Rules#blind>rules
of the Blind variant</a> apply and govern which
portions of the board each player can "see" in the results
of a game phase delivered to that player.
<DT><B>Rule 3.1, item 6</B>
<DD>If a player offers a bribe to a
non-existent unit (which would be forbidden by this point of
the rule), the GameMaster will
<b>not</b> report this fact to that player (nor to any other
player).  All such bribes are simply ignored, but may be
revealed by the GameMaster at the conclusion of the game.
<DT><B>Rule 3.1, item 7</B>
<DD>Likewise, if a power offers a bribe
that <i>mentions</i> any unit that does not exist (which
would be forbidden by this point of the rule &mdash;
for example, an offer
to an existing unit to support a unit that does <b>not</b>
exist), this offer will be similarly ignored.
<DT><B>Rule 5.7, item 3</B>
<DD>In the informational message delivered
by the GameMaster before adjudication of each movement phase,
players are only told the specific amount of that player's money
that was paid to each unit, and the nationality of each such
unit, but are <a href="notes.html#mystery"><b>not</b> told the
order that the unit will issue in return for this
compensation</a>.
</DL>
<DT><H4>6.4 eBayola</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>In this variant, suggested by Payola co-creator John Woolley on
3 August 2005, the total cost of a successful bribe is reduced
(if possible) to one silver piece more than the highest
<i>non-</i>winning bribe.
Any <a href="notes.html#rebates">resulting cost savings</a> for the
contributor(s) to the winning bribe are awarded to the contributing
powers
according to their position in the acceptance list of the bribed unit.
There are a couple of
<a href="notes.html#eBayola">interesting twists</a>,
but that's the basic idea.
<DT><H4>6.5 Unbribeable Units</H4>
<dd><p align=justify>Payola can be played with each human player's
own units being loyal (and ordered as in standard Diplomacy), but with
units of unplayed (<tt>DUMMY</tt>) powers being bribeable per these
Payola rules.  This is not only useful as a technique when
the required number of human players for a game cannot be gathered,
but also in variants in which neutral supply centers (Belgium,
Greece, <i>et al.</i>) are provided with units.
<DT><H4>6.6 Alternate Income Schemes</H4>
<dd><p align=justify>The income scheme outlined by these rules (that is,
17 AgP for the first supply center, 16 for the next one, etc.) can be
modified to be any different (fixed, decreasing, increasing, capped)
scheme, and income can be distributed more often than once a year.
<DT><H4>6.7 Zero Sum Payola</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>In Zero Sum Payola, developed by Michael Schmahl,
<!--		(<a href=mailto:fxmgs@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>fxmgs@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu</a>), -->
there is a fixed amount of money in the world.
Contrast this with standard Payola, in which new money is printed
each year for taxpayers to contribute to their governments.  Zero
Sum Payola uses the standard Payola rules with the following
modifications:
<ol>
<LI>Each power begins the game with a treasury containing 10 silver
pieces for each owned supply center.
<LI>Powers do <b>not</b> receive tax income.  Instead, money is
transferred as follows:
<ul>
<LI>The amount of money that was paid as bribes to the units of
each power during any particular gameyear is deposited into the
account of that power at the conclusion of the Fall turn.
<LI>When a neutral supply center is first captured, the power
that occupies it is awarded a one-time 10 silver piece bonus.
<LI>When an owned supply center changes hands, the new owner receives
an amount of money <em>from the treasury of the former owner</em>.
This amount of money is the total treasury of the disenfranchised
power divided by the number of supply centers owned by that power
at the beginning of the gameyear, rounded down.
</ul>
</ol>
<DT><H4>6.8 Exchange Payola</H4>
<DD><p align=justify>Exchange Payola, created by <a href=mailto:beduewer@eos.ncsu.edu>Bruce
Duewer</a>,
disassociates players from the powers on the game map.  Each player
is instead an independent investor who can purchase stock in any
of the powers on the board.  One player is periodically elected by
stockholders to serve as CEO of
each power; that player controls the power's treasury,
sets the worth (in silver pieces)
of each of the supply centers that are owned by that power,  and
issues dividends to its stockholders.
Each power's CEO also enters bribe offers for his power.  (Investors may
also use their own private treasuries to bribe units, of course.)  A
<a href=/Zine/W1998A/Duewer/exchange.html>Pouch Zine article</a>
