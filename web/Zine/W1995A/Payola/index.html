Bernard Cornwell never played Payola Diplomacy, but you sure wouldn't know it
by reading the above quote, taken from his <i>Sharpe's Revenge</i>.  The
Payola variant, developed by John Woolley and myself, adds Cornwell's
"treasury" to the arsenals of Diplomacy's combatant nations, and the result
is an addicting game with no stalemate lines, multiple levels of intrigue,
and in which even the closest of allies can be actively working against each
other from the first turn until the bitter end.
<p align=justify>
Since its introduction into the play-by-email hobby, Payola has quickly grown
into an accepted and respected variant, with a great many devoted players.
<p align=justify>
This article discusses Payola Diplomacy in depth by annotating (using
hotlinks) the formal rules of the variant.  In this way, the rules of the
game may be read (and printed, etc.) without intrusion by these annotations,
and yet the reasoning behind each rule, examples of play, anecdotes from
actual games, and other interesting tidbits contained in the annotations
are always available.  A further reading of the rules may be necessary to
provide context for some of the annotations, so it is suggested that
<a href=notes.html>the annotations</a>
only be perused after the complete rules have been read.
<p align=justify>
Be sure to also check out the other way-cool appendices, including
<a href="strategy.html">some further reflections on the game</a>
and on <a href="variants.html">other contemplated variants</a>.

for your entertainment and education.

2. Accounts
</th></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>2.1 Income</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>Before every Spring movement phase, each power on the board
receives &mdash; added to its bank account &mdash; a number of
"<a href="notes.html#megafrancs">silver pieces</a>" (abbreviated AgP).
This income is termed "taxes" received from each owned supply
center, and the total amount of this income is therefore based
on the number of supply centers controlled by the power.
<p align=justify>
The number of silver pieces awarded for the first supply center
owned by a player
is one fewer than the number of supply centers that defines the
victory condition of the game.  Thus, for
the standard map, with a victory condition of 18 supply centers,
an owner of one supply center receives 17 AgP of annual income.
<p align=justify>
On the principle that bureaucratic costs rise as government
expands, the total net tax income is <a href="notes.html#income">a
simple decreasing sequence</a>: while
the first supply center owned by a power will generate an income of 17
silver pieces, the second will add 16 silver pieces, the third
will add 15, the fourth 14, etc., etc.  The table below shows
the annual tax revenue received by powers of each size, when using
the standard map and victory condition:

3. Offer Sheets
</th></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>3.1 Offers</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>During a movement phase, rather than submitting the order to be
issued for each of their own units, each player submits a single
"offer sheet". An "offer sheet" contains a series of offers,
each of which is made to a specific single unit and given on a
separate line of text.  In its simplest form, an offer is a monetary amount
followed by a colon and the unit and order for which the amount
is bring offered.  For example,
an offer of four silver pieces if the army in London is ordered to move to Yorkshire
is given as:
<center><tt>4&nbsp;:&nbsp;A&nbsp;LON&nbsp;-&nbsp;YOR</tt></center>
<p align=justify>
Using a number of <font color=red>optional</font> modifiers, an offer can be much more involved
than the simple example above.  This is illustrated by the example below:
<center><tt>4*5#2 + 5*10#3 + 6#1 &gt; A LON - YOR | S F EDI - YOR | S F NTH - YOR</tt></center>
<p align=justify>
The complete description of an offer format follows.  An offer consists, in this order, of:
<p align=justify>
<OL>
<li><font color=red><b>Optionally,</b></font> a repetition count.  This is a positive number
&mdash; followed by an asterisk (<tt>*</tt>) &mdash; that indicates
how many times in succession the offer will be repeated.
Repetition is a convenient shorthand
to assist a player in <a href=notes.html#noDupes>scaled offer
reduction</a>.
<LI><b>A monetary amount.</b>  This is any non-negative number (including
zero) of whole silver pieces.
Note, however, that if the offer is being made
to a unit that is <b>not</b> owned by the offering
player, the amount must be positive (in other words,
<a href="notes.html#zero">zero silver piece offers to foreign
units are not allowed</a>).
<li><font color=red><b>Optionally,</b></font> a hash sign (<tt>#</tt>)
followed by <a href="notes.html#plateau">a <i>plateau</i>
amount</a> to be used for this offer.  As discussed in
Rule 5.5, offers made by the players may need to be reduced
automatically to avoid overexpenditure.  However, an offer
may be set to reduce no lower than a specific plateau
amount, and then to remain at that amount as long as
possible (decreasing again, eventually to zero if need be,
only when <i>all</i> offers have reached their plateau and
overexpenditure still exists).
If no hash sign is given in an offer, the plateau amount to
which it will reduce is zero.  If a hash sign is given with
no amount following it, the plateau amount is the same as
the ful amount of the offer (no reductions until all bids reach their
plateau).
<li><font color=red><b>Optionally,</b></font> a plus-sign (<tt>+</tt>)
followed by another monetaty amount (with optional repetition count and plateau
amount).  This may be done any number of times in succession.
For example,
<tt>4*3&nbsp;+&nbsp;2*4#2&nbsp;+&nbsp;1</tt> is a series of three 
amounts given using this technique.
<LI><b>A symbol indicating the type of the offer.</b>  The

</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>A player may make any number of different offers to each unit in an
offer sheet.
<p align=justify>
Using the vertical bar to separate them, any number of orders to the
same unit may be given in a single offer.  In all but <i>negative
offers</i>, such multiple orders are essentially equivalent to each
order appearing by itself, in sequence, in a separate
<i>direct offer</i>.  In the case of <i>negative offers</i>,
multiple orders separated by vertical bars impose further
restrictions on the promise to pay &mdash; to wit, if <b>any</b> of the
listed orders is issued, the amount will <b>not</b> be paid.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>3.3 Offers Required</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>Each uneliminated player <b>must</b> submit an offer sheet
containing at least one offer before the GameMaster will determine
and process orders.
<p align=justify>
If, for any specific movement phase, a player does <b>not</b> issue
any offer to one of his own units, a zero silver piece <i>direct
offer</i> from that player for the unit to <tt>HOLD</tt> is
entered for that player by the GameMaster before processing offers.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>3.4 Savings Requests</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>A <i>savings request</i> is not an offer, but it is
submitted with the player's offer sheet.  It consists in its entirety
of a non-negative amount followed by
a dollar-sign (<tt>$</tt>).  The
function of a savings request is to cause
the given number of silver pieces in the player's treasury to
be <a href=notes.html#savings>"held back" in savings</a>, and
not to be made
available for use in any offers.  That is, the sum total
of all savings requests in a player's offer sheet will be
the guaranteed minimum balance in the player's treasury
after all the amounts of all accepted offers have been paid.
<p align=justify>
Savings requests are specific to the offer sheet with which they were
submitted; like offers, they do not persist from turn to turn.  Players
must re-submit new savings requests with each turn's offer sheet.
<p align=justify>
Note that it is <u>not</u> an
error if the total of all savings requests exceeds a player's
current balance; if this is the case at the time offers are
processed, any player having requested more savings than are
possible will be considered as having requested to expend no
money (and will be left with his full account balance).
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>3.5 Commentary</b>

<p align=justify>
Players may include comments in their offer sheet.  This is done
by using a percent sign (<tt>%</tt>), either on its own line
or at the end of a line containing an offer or savings request,
after which all text until the
end of a line is considered to be commentary.  Typically 
this is done by players to record money management
and campaign planning notes for their own use (although if offer
sheets are published during
or after the game, these comments will of course be exposed to all).

4. Acceptance Lists
</th></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>4.1 Acceptability of<br />Different Currency</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>In addition to the players' "offer sheets",
the GameMaster will also maintain a separate
<a href="notes.html#reference">"acceptance list"</a> for each player.
An acceptance list is simply an ordered list of <b>every</b> power in
the game (including the power submitting the list, and including any
eliminated powers).
During the game, the GameMaster shall not reveal the acceptance
list of any power to any other power.
<p align=justify>
If ever a player's unit would receive the same amount of money for
issuing any one of two or more different orders, and no other
order would pay as much, the player's acceptance list is consulted to
decide which order the unit will issue.  The use of acceptance lists to
make this determination is described in full in <a href="#R5">Section
5</a> of these rules.
<p align=justify>
A power specifies its acceptance list to the GameMaster on a single
line of text containing the
word "<tt>ACCEPT</tt>" followed by the single-character
abbreviations, in any order of the player's choosing,
for each of <b>every</b> power in the game (including any eliminated
powers).
<!p>
A player may omit one or more of the other powers from his acceptance
list if and only if the acceptance list contains
<a href="notes.html#randomaccept">exactly one
question-mark</a>.  That question-mark represents a list of
all of the omitted powers; the specific sequence of these
powers will be determined randomly
every time the adjudication of a movement phase begins.
<p align=justify>
The first power listed in an acceptance list is the power which &mdash; in
the eyes of all units owned by the power submitting the list &mdash; is
considered to offer the <b>most</b> preferred currency.  Subsequent
powers in the acceptance list
are considered to offer less and less preferred currency, descending in
preference until the final power listed (which is deemed to hold the
currency <b>least</b> preferred by the units that are owned by the
list submitter).
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>4.2 Acceptance Lists Required</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>
An acceptance list must always be on record for each power.
<p align=justify>
Each power begins the game with an acceptance list consisting of its
own abbreviation followed by a question-mark (indicating that its own
currency takes precedence over that of all other powers, which are
randomly ordered).  That is, the German acceptance list, unless changed
by the player, will be "<tt>G?</tt>".
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>4.3 Acceptance Lists Persist</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>
Unlike offer sheets, which must be submitted anew with
each movement phase, acceptance lists persist from turn to turn.
A power may modify his acceptance list at any time.
It remains unchanged and will be used for all
movement phases after its submission until such
time as the player submits another acceptance list, which
then completely replaces the earlier list.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>4.4 Eliminated and<br />Unplayed Powers</b>
<td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<p align=justify>
The acceptance lists for eliminated powers are ignored and unused.
<p align=justify>
Acceptance lists are also not used for powers that are not being
played (so-called "dummy powers").
Instead, any monetary tie that would need to be broken to
determine the order to be issued to a dummy unit is resolved
by having the unit accept its own default offer to <tt>HOLD</tt>,
and reporting (if need be) to the players that it did so in response
to an offer or offers totalling one silver piece
greater than the (tied for) highest total offer that the unit actually
received.

<p align=justify>When all offer sheets have been submitted, all non-<i>direct

offers</i> as described in Rule 3.1.  The <i>direct
offers</i> then are used to form the <b>complete</b> list
of the different <b>orders</b> from which each unit can choose.
All money offered by all players for each of these separate
<b>orders</b> &mdash; including any money offered in <i>negative
offers</i> for which the order meets the stated requirements &mdash;
is then totalled, giving the <i>total

<b>5.5 Overexpenditures</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>The amount a player can <i>offer</i> is <B>not</b> limited by his
account balance.  However, player expenditures are.  Once the order
for every unit is determined (using the process described in Rules 5.1
through 5.4), the total expenditure for each player is calculated.  If
any player would pay more money than he currently has available in
his account (honoring any savings request he has made),
<B>every single one</b> of the offers made by each such
"would-be-overdrawn" player is reduced by a single silver piece
(except those offers that are already at zero).
(However, note that offers with specified <i>plateau</i> amounts are
not reduced beyond that amount unless it is the case that every offer
has already reached its plateau and overexpenditure still exists.)
After these reductions,
<a href="notes.html#redecide"><b>all</b> the units
which were subjects of these offers
"re-decide"</a> all over again which order
each will issue.  If the same situation occurs again, this procedure
is repeated (subtracting yet another silver piece from the offers of
the "would-be-overdrawn" player or players), until no player would
end up with a balance less than either their requested
savings amount (if any), or zero.
<p align=justify>
Note that although the amount of a player's offer may be reduced to zero,
<a href=notes.html#intent>the fact
that the player had made the offer is still considered</a> for the
purposes of determining the order to be issued in the case of a tie,
according to sections 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4.
<p align=justify>
While <i>all</i> of a player's <i>offers</i> are
subject to reduction when the player is in this situation, any
<i>savings requests</i> that were listed in the player's offer sheet
are <b>not</b> reduced.

<b>6.2 Application to Map Variants</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>The Payola system is easily applied to map variants such as Loeb-9,
Youngstown, Colonial, etc., etc.  The only necessary modification to
the rules is that the amount of tax income per supply center is
adjusted so that the amount gained from the first center is one silver
piece fewer than the
number of supply centers that is the variant's victory criteria,
and subsequent centers then follow the same "one silver piece less"
tax pattern.
<p align=justify>
In variants in which any power begins a game owning <i>no supply centers</i>
but with one or more unit on the board (such as in the
<a href=/dpjudge?page=about:void>Void variant</a>), such a player
will receive as his
initial funds one-half of the amount that the power would have received
had each unit been supported by an owned supply center.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>6.3 Tin Cup Diplomacy</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>Payola Diplomacy is combined with
<a href="notes.html#blind">the Blind variant</a> by making the
following four changes or additions to the rules above.  This variant
is called Tin Cup Diplomacy because it is blind with money, much like
a street-corner pencil salesman.
<p>
<table>
<tr><td valign=top>
<B>Rule 1.1</B>
</td><td valign=top colspan=2>
The usual
<a href=/dpjudge/?page=Rules#blind>rules
of the Blind variant</a> apply and govern which
portions of the board each player can "see" in the results
of a game phase delivered to that player.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top rowspan=2>
<B>Rule 3.1</b></td>
<td valign=top><b>item&nbsp;6</b></td><td valign=top>
If a player makes an offer to a
non-existent unit (which would be forbidden by this point of
the rule), the GameMaster will
<b>not</b> report this fact to that player (nor to any other
player).  All such offers are simply ignored, but may be
revealed by the GameMaster at the conclusion of the game.
</td></tr><tr>
<td valign=top><b>item 7</b></td><td valign=top>
Likewise, if a power makes an offer
that <i>mentions</i> any unit that does not exist (which
would be forbidden by this point of the rule &mdash;
for example, an offer
to an existing unit to support a unit that does <b>not</b>
exist), this offer will be similarly ignored.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top>
<B>Rule&nbsp;5.7</b>
</td>
<td valign=top><b>item&nbsp;3</td>
<td valign=top>
In the informational message delivered
by the GameMaster concerning the results of each movement phase,
players are only told the specific amount of that player's money
that was paid to each unit, and the nationality of each such
unit, but are <a href="notes.html#mystery"><b>not</b> told the
order that the unit will issue in return for this
compensation</a>.

<b>6.4 eBayola</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>In this variant, suggested by Payola co-creator John Woolley on
3 August 2005, the total cost of a successful total bribe is reduced
(if possible) to one silver piece more than the highest
<i>non-</i>winning total bribe.
Any <a href="notes.html#rebates">resulting cost savings</a> for the
contributor(s) to the winning total bribe are awarded to the contributing
powers
according to their position in the acceptance list of the unit's owner.
There are a couple of
<a href="notes.html#eBayola">interesting twists</a>,
but that's the basic idea.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>6.5 Loyal Units</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>Payola can be played with each human player's
own units being loyal (and ordered as in standard Diplomacy, immune to
monetary offers), but with
units of unplayed (<tt>DUMMY</tt>) powers being ordered per these
Payola rules.  This is not only useful as a technique when
the required number of human players for a game cannot be gathered,
but also in variants in which neutral supply centers (Belgium,
Greece, <i>et al.</i>) are provided with units.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>6.6 Alternate Income Schemes</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>The income scheme outlined by these rules (that is,
17 AgP for the first supply center, 16 for the next one, etc.) can be
modified to be any different (fixed, decreasing, increasing, capped)
scheme, and income can be distributed more often than once a year.
</td></tr><tr><td valign=top bgcolor=#ddd align=right>
<b>6.7 Zero Sum Payola</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>In Zero Sum Payola, developed by Michael Schmahl,
<!--		(<a href=mailto:fxmgs@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu>fxmgs@camelot.acf-lab.alaska.edu</a>), -->
there is a fixed amount of money in the world.
Contrast this with standard Payola, in which new money is printed
each year for taxpayers to contribute to their governments.  Zero
Sum Payola uses the standard Payola rules with the following
modifications:
<ol>
<LI>Each power begins the game with a treasury containing 10 silver
pieces for each owned supply center.
<LI>Powers do <b>not</b> receive tax income.  Instead, money is
transferred as follows:
<ul>
<LI>The amount of money that was paid by successful offers made to the units of
each power during any particular game year is deposited into the
account of that power at the conclusion of the Fall turn.
<LI>When a neutral supply center is first captured, the power
that occupies it is awarded a one-time 10 silver piece bonus.
<LI>When an owned supply center changes hands, the new owner receives
an amount of money <em>from the treasury of the former owner</em>.
This amount of money is the total treasury of the disenfranchised
power divided by the number of supply centers owned by that power
at the beginning of the game year, rounded down.
</ul>
</ol>

<b>6.8 Exchange Payola</b>
</td><td colspan=3 valign=top bgcolor=#ddd>
<p align=justify>Exchange Payola, created by <a href=mailto:beduewer@eos.ncsu.edu>Bruce
Duewer</a>,
disassociates players from the powers on the game map.  Each player
is instead an independent investor who can purchase stock in any
of the powers on the board.  One player is periodically elected by
stockholders to serve as CEO of
each power; that player controls the power's treasury,
sets the worth (in silver pieces)
of each of the supply centers that are owned by that power,  and
issues dividends to its stockholders.
Each power's CEO also enters offers for his power.  (Investors may
also use their own private treasuries to make offers to the units
on the map, of course.)  A
<a href=/Zine/W1998A/Duewer/exchange.html>Pouch Zine article</a>
