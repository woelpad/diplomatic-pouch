<p align=justify>
In addition to the scattered strategies presented throughout
<a href="notes.html">the annotations</a>,
here are some random observations on the play of Payola Diplomacy.
Payola allows a meaningful cooperation of any two (or more)
powers at any time.  England and Russia can ally against Italy
in 1902, if they want, and do him real hurts.  Turkey, France,
and Austria can join up to make England's life difficult from the
very beginning.  In exploring these possibilities and playing
the game, there are a
lot of nuances to be explored, and here I present only a few.
<p align=justify><HR>
<H3 align=center>Spending Patterns</H3><p align=justify>
The most common money management strategy for the Payola player is to bid
defensively in the Spring, and then &mdash; seeing what your position is after
the Spring &mdash; more heavily in the Fall.  Since income occurs only once a year,
you quickly learn that you do not want to leave yourself without
sufficient Falltime money to cover your own supply centers or to complete
an assault to gain one or more new centers.  To illustrate this, I have
chronicled the percentage of money spent in each season of a particular
game.  This is presented in the table below.
<p align=justify>

<p align=justify>
From the above table, it becomes apparent that the common practice is to
spend less than half of one's reserve in the Spring, and then more than
half of the remainder in the Fall.  In fact, the table contains no Spring
season in which <b>more</b> than 50% of the available money was spent, and no Fall
season in which <b>less</b> than 50% of the available money was spent.
Of course, when offers are made, it is
difficult to forecast exact spending; only the spending <i>ceiling</i> can be set.
If we assume that expenditures in both seasons amount to a similar
precentage of this ceiling, though, the fact that this money management
scheme is a conscious one becomes clear.  Indeed, this pattern of spending
is also apparent from individually submitted offer sheets.
<p align=justify><HR>
<H3 align=center>One Reason to Deviate</H3><p align=justify>
The normal spending pattern described above
is tried and true, but this is not to say that
there are not sound reasons to use other patterns.  To illustrate this, here
is an anecdote from one of the games I Mastered.
<p align=justify>
A player who had gained a strong advantage over the other players on the board,
reaching 14 centers or so, sumbitted a Springtime offer sheet that stabbed his
one remaining ally but that was virtually guaranteed to cause an outflow of far
<b>greater</b> than half the balance in his considerable bank account.
Curious as to why this player chose to deviate from the normal light
Spring/heavy Fall spending pattern which had gotten him so far, I inquired
(after the processing of the Spring moves that impoverished him) as to his
reasoning.  His response was enlightening,
revealing a novel tactic that I had not previously considered.  I paraphrase
it below.

<blockquote><p align=justify><i>
Perhaps I overspent &mdash; I have no way of knowing.  Of course I wish I had more
money, but my Spring strategy was to win every single one of my offers no
matter the cost, pushing myself as far forward as I could, and
into as many SC's as possible.  I wasn't really interested in keeping them in
the Fall (though if I do, all the better).  Rather, I was more interested
in making the (surely united after this last move!) opposition spend
<b>together</b> in the Fall,
hopefully a ton of cash, which will all go only to push me back to where I was
before this year.  With their treasuries drained, then, my hope is to rely on
the weight of my year-end income to get me a solo next year with the typical
conservative Spring, heavy-spending Fall cycle.
</i></blockquote>
This is an excellent and very valid strategy, a nuance I never thought about,
and it shows how other considerations can determine spending patterns.

<p align=justify><HR>
<H3 align=center>The Payola Endgame</H3><p align=justify>
If you're playing Payola Diplomacy, you can throw your stalemate line references
out the window.  Think about it.
<p align=justify>
France and Germany are eliminated and England has taken St. Petersburg, so
no one but England can build a northern fleet.  Now he sets up fleets in Portugal,
the Mid-Atlantic, the Channel, Norway, Denmark, and St. Pete.  In a standard game,
you can't touch him.  He can <tt>HOLD</tt> and <tt>SUPPORT</tt> until kingdom
come.  He has guaranteed himself a part of any draw.
<p align=justify>
Not in a Payola game.  In a Payola game, it takes more than just orders to hold
this stalemate line &mdash; it takes money.  On every turn, the line stands a chance
of breaking down.  Denmark could suddenly step aside and allow the Austrian to
enter Scandinavia.  The St. Pete fleet could decide to sail the Barents rather
than accept Norwegian support.  The Portuguese fleet might leave Lisbon,
tempted by Italian lira.
<p align=justify>
In fact, every turn in which this traditional stalemate line <i>does</i> hold
fast means that the money supply of the English player dwindles while that of
his foes doesn't, and this makes it that much easier for the opposition to
break the line on the next turn.
<p align=justify>
Do stalemate lines exist at <i>all</i> in Payola?  I am tempted to say that
they don't.  However, I do wonder if they can arise under certain economic
conditions.  Consider the situation described above (where England has
blocked Portugal, Denmark, and St. Petersburg) and assume that it takes
every bit of money that England has to outbid the constant efforts to
break this line.  Consider also that England is offering money to each of
the enemy units (money that is not accepted, but that drives up the prices
that the opposition must pay to hold their side of the line &mdash;
for example, he is successfully ordering
<tt>Den-Kie</tt> while unsuccessfully bribing the Austrian army in Kiel and
the Italian fleet in Spain to step aside).  Finally, consider that because
of these English bribes, the opposition coalition is therefore spending 100%
of its money to keep its side of the line (Kiel and Spain) from slipping.
<p align=justify>
If either side
lowered their bids by one silver piece to any unit, the line would break down,
allowing the opposition to advance (or allowing the opposition to save
money for use in the next year, and <i>this</i> would tip the scales by then
allowing a key bid to be <i>raised</i>).  Assuming that such a situation is
reached &mdash; and that all parties <i>realize</i> that such a situation is
reached &mdash; then a true stalemate situation would exist and a draw would need
to be declared.  I contend that it would be mighty difficult for such a
situation to arise, and that it would be even more difficult for it to be
noticed by any of the players if it did.
<p align=justify>
For this reason, my initial thoughts were that every Payola game should
end in a solo victory and that I, as a GameMaster, would only accept this
result.  However, stalemates, as we all know, are not the only &mdash; and
not even the most common &mdash; reason for which draws are declared.  More
common is the situation in which three or more players can each find
themselves afraid that someone other than himself can win on the coming turn,
and so decide for their own sakes to call a draw.  For example, two
players in a game could each control 16 SC's, with a third power, pinned
between these powers, controlling the other two centers.  This third power
could broadcast a call for a three-way draw, since each of the other powers
could be afraid that the two centers owned by the small power could fall into
the hands of the other large power, giving that player the solo victory.
<p align=justify>
In a standard game, these same two large powers could &mdash; if they'd
properly positioned themselves &mdash; be set up such that each of the two
would safely capture one of the small power's centers, to end the game
in a two-way draw.  In Payola, the money in the small power's account
(and, indeed, in any eliminated players' accounts) is a wildcard that
makes this tactic much more risky and difficult.
<p align=justify>
It would seem from this discussion that Payola games are <b>most</b>
likely to end in solo victories, and <b>least</b> likely to end in
two-way draws.

<p align=justify><HR>
<H3 align=center>Leaving Yourself Open</H3><p align=justify>
Payola games can provide at least some metric as to how tightly an alliance
binds.  For example, if the French player promises England that he will offer
some money on a certain English order, the English player has some chance to
test the fulfillment of this promise.  If the order is issued and the only
money spent for it is English, the English player will know it and will be
able to point out to the French that he has welched on his promise.  Similarly,
if a <b>different</b> order is issued for that unit, and at an expense only
slightly higher than the price offered by England for the wanted order, the
duplicity of the French can also be deduced.
<p align=justify>
From this, we can see that the ability to find an ally who will agree to
coordinate bribes on one's own units is to find a reliable ally.  In the
same vein, it becomes apparent that promises to coordinate bribes should
only be made when the consequences of failure to follow-through have been
considered (and/or planned).

<p align=justify><HR>
<H3 align=center>Working at a Disadvantage?</H3><p align=justify>
The so-called witches of Diplomacy &mdash; England and Turkey &mdash; would appear to
be disadvantaged by Payola.  England can be kept from building in 1901 simply
by successfully bribing his two fleets to stay home in the Spring.  The power
or combination of powers that managed this feat would then be able to ignore
England in the Fall and spend money elsewhere, confident that England is
crippled.  Similarly, the trip from Constantinople to Bulgaria, which is
so important to Turkey not only at the beginning of the game but throughout
it, can be foiled with a single bribe, and Turkey can find himself with a
lot of trouble and no room to maneuver.
<p align=justify>
Additionally, Italy could be stunted in growth by some malicious Spring 1901
bribery.  By keeping the Italian fleet off the water, Tunis cannot be taken.
Indeed, by bribing Naples to <tt>HOLD</tt> and Venice to move to Tuscany
(unopposed by Rome), the Italian is guaranteed not to build in 1901.
<p align=justify>
One would think that France and Germany (and/or Russia) would instinctively
combine in 1901 to bribe the English fleets to <tt>HOLD</tt>, that Russia
and Austria would find good cause to pool their resources to keep Constantinople
(and therefore the rest of the Turkish units) locked in Asia, and that France
and Austria might wish to shut Naples and Venice in.
In every one of the actual games played so far, however, none of these
1901 crippling actions were undertaken (or if they were, they were unsuccessful).
<p align=justify>
My belief, then, is that this initial perception that these powers are easy
victims is a false one.  It may be true, though, that they are forced
to either conduct some inspired diplomacy or else to work together to avoid the fates
outlined for them above.  Perhaps, however, the simple greatness of the game of
Diplomacy is what has kept these crippling actions from taking place.  For
every action, after all, there is an equal and opposite reaction.  Just as it
would seem to be in <b>France and Russia's</b> best interest to keep the English
fleets on the island in Spring 1901, it would likely be in <b>Italy and Austria's</b>
best interest to assist in getting the Edinburgh fleet to sail.  After all, Italy
usually does not look kindly on the early exit of England at the hands of France
&mdash; who, then, would attack the Frenchman from the rear when he turns south?

<p align=justify><HR>
<H3 align=center>Of Mice And Men</H3><p align=justify>
In Payola, there are a multitude of ways in which the best laid plans can go
awry.  A unit that you're counting on to provide a key support could be bribed
away from you.  Worse yet, all the supports are there, but the moving unit
has been bribed not to use them.
<p align=justify>
Perhaps the most difficult move in Payola Diplomacy is the convoy.  To
successfully pull off a convoy, a minimum of two bribes must go through (as
opposed to one for other moves).  This would seem to compound the perceived
(though apparently non-existant) disadvantage of the English player, who
relies on the convoy more than does any other player.
<p align=justify>
Additionally, you must not discount the possibility that your moves will not
just fail, but that they will turn against you.  Just ask any English player
who has offered to pay his North Sea fleet to carry his army to Norway but
instead saw it decide to convoy an invading German army into London.
<p align=justify>
For a number of reasons, the units of any particular power in a Payola game
tend, I believe, to spread themselves out more than they do in standard
Diplomacy.  In standard Diplomacy, the norm is to maintain all your units,
if not adjacent to each other, then within spitting distance.
In Payola, it is not uncommon that
units from more than one nation will tend to roam far behind or far in front
of the lines, either purposely or accidentally (as a by-product of the war).
<p align=justify>
All this truly makes for an interesting game, even
to watch.  I am often struck with the feeling, when looking at maps of Payola
games &mdash; with the failed supports, the missed convoys, the
unexpectedly routed units and the dramatic turns of fortune &mdash;
that they resemble actual real-world war maps much more than do
standard Diplomacy games.
<p align=justify>

<p align=justify><HR>
<H3 align=center>Overage</H3><p align=justify>
A very interesting statistic for a Payola GameMaster to keep is "overage."
Define "overage" as any money spent that didn't affect the outcome of the
move.  For example, if a unit receives two offers, one for five silver pieces
and the other for three silver pieces, then the person offering the five
silver pieces could instead have offered four silver pieces (or even three if
the acceptance list for the unit would break a tie in his favor), meaning this
player had an overage of one (or two) for this offer.  Now
obviously, a country should try to reduce overage as much as
possible, but the players don't have any good way to know how much
overage they have!  Consider this overage calculation from Spring,
1901 of a Payola game.
<p align=justify>
<center>
<table border>
<tr><th><th>Overage<th>Expenditure</tr>
<tr><th>Austria<td align=center>6<td align=center>11</tr>
<tr><th>England<td align=center>2<td align=center>4</tr>
<tr><th>France<td align=center>8<td align=center>10</tr>
<tr><th>Germany<td align=center>4<td align=center>4</tr>
<tr><th>Italy<td align=center>4<td align=center>12</tr>
<tr><th>Russia<td align=center>17<td align=center>24</tr>
<tr><th>Turkey<td align=center>2<td align=center>3</tr>
<tr><th>TOTAL<td align=center>45<td align=center>71</tr>
</table></center><p align=justify>

Note that <b>all</b> of Germany's (modest) spending was overage;
that almost three-fourths of Russia's spending
was; and that fully 63% of the total money spent was spent unnecessarily.
<p align=justify>
The players themselves, however, do not know what their overage is, and
so their adjustments may be made incorrectly.  Consider what the players
would know after the above move.
<p align=justify>
<center>
<table border>
<tr><th><th>Expenditure<th>Amount Bid</tr>
<tr><th>Austria<td align=center>11<td align=center>20</tr>
<tr><th>England<td align=center>4<td align=center>9</tr>
<tr><th>France<td align=center>10<td align=center>10</tr>
<tr><th>Germany<td align=center>4<td align=center>9</tr>
<tr><th>Italy<td align=center>12<td align=center>12</tr>
<tr><th>Russia<td align=center>24<td align=center>31</tr>
<tr><th>Turkey<td align=center>3<td align=center>4</tr>
</table>
</center><p align=justify>
Austria, England, and Germany had around half their offers
taken &mdash; they will likely feel they should raise a bit.  France and
Italy had every offer accepted &mdash; they will think they bid a
bit too high.  But from the overage chart, we see that while
France will be correct to lower his bids (overage 8 of 10 spent),
Italy would be wrong (4 of 12).
<p align=justify>
It is interesting to watch, as a GameMaster, adjustments made by the
players to their overage as the game proceeds.  This can show how
adept each player is becoming at determining the "going" prices for
various units.
<p align=justify>
There are a million ways to think about this data!  Mastering Payola
is great fun.

<p align=justify><HR>
<H3 align=center>Lean, Mean, Fighting Machines</H3><p align=justify>
One tactic that is used far more often in Payola games than in standard
games is the waived build.  One way to think about this is to realize
that every unit you build is one more unit that could be used against
you.  Sure, if the unit behaves itself, it can gain you supply centers,
but just as often your own units can actually prove more bothersome to
you than anything, and can actually show up as a hindrance rather than
as a help.
<p align=justify>
Nothing is worse than having your attack go off perfectly except for
one of your own uninvolved units, fouling the whole thing up by
bouncing a key move of yours or by supporting the very enemy unit that
you are attacking.  It sure makes you wish you hadn't built that unit.
<p align=justify>
By maintaining fewer units on the board than the number of supply centers
you control, you are also able to devote a greater amount of money to each
of your own units.  This becomes important, especially given the decreasing
amount of income that each new supply center gained brings you.
<p align=justify>
As I mentioned above, the Payola game seems to me to even more closely
resemble real-world war situations than does the standard game, and 
I feel that a fair number of waived builds
is one more way in which this realism is enhanced.  At the very least,
the fact that Payola provides new and very legitimate reasons to consider
waiving builds makes the players' decisions that
much broader, deeper, and more important.  Perhaps it is this that provokes
me to say that it more closely resembles real life.

<p align=justify><HR>
<H3 align=center>Playing Possum</H3><p align=justify>
I have seen an interesting tactic employed in some Payola games, and
that is to spend very minimally (if at all), allowing your units to be
pushed around by other players while you save money.
<p align=justify>
Assuming you are on friendly terms with your neighbors, you can
allow faroff powers to indicate how interested they are in attacking
your neighbors by simply waiting to see how your own pieces are put
to use.  At that point, you can elect either to join the fray or to
use your savings to protect your neighbor and expose his enemy.
<p align=justify>
An added &mdash; perhaps accidental &mdash; benefit of this tactic is that when
no one has any interest in using your units, your units will likely
<tt>HOLD</tt> turn after turn.  Even this can be a plus, since
many, if not all, players will misinterpret these <tt>HOLD</tt>s as expensive
purchases by foreign powers.  You will find that sympathy will pour out
for your "failed plans," and that the players who <b>truly</b> have
had units purchased out from under them will see you as a natural (and
rich) ally to fight with them against those who oppose them.
<p align=justify>
To pull off this tactic as, say, Italy, perhaps it would be better not to 
apathetically let your units <tt>HOLD</tt>, but instead to make small offers
for orders that any sensible Italian would not make (for example,
<tt>Ven-Tus</tt>
with <tt>Rom-Tus</tt> in Spring of 1901).  This can make your units
<i>look</i> bought off, something
that can come in quite handy in alliance building.  If these orders
go through, you could then openly claim to have been bought-off, and
petition all those who <b>truly</b> had rogue units to sympathize with
you and chip in some dough for a joint endeavor.
<p align=justify>
This strategy can backfire too, of course.  If everyone assumes that your
nation is "bought," they could set out to find the bandwagon to jump on,
thinking that you obviously have no friends so why bail water from a sinking
ship?  The fact that your treasury is probably undepleted will perhaps
offset this risk.
