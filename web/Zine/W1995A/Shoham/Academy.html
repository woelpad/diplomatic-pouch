<H3>Introduction</H3>
Hello Again.
<P>
<tt>Chopin</tt> was one of my favorite games. It was certainly the game
where my life depended on the most outrageous string of luck. In the opening I
survived an attack which I had later calculated had a probability of
over 99% of eliminating me. Later on, when my position was secure, I
risked everything for a shot at victory. Once again, I needed -- and
got -- an incredible deal of luck.
<P>
<tt>Chopin</tt> was a Crowded variant game. The Crowded variant plays on
the standard map (except that the Ruhr is promoted to a supply center) but
4 new powers are formed out of the previously neutral supply centers:
Norway, Spain, Balkan, and Lowland. With 11 players, and no neutral
centers, the game is bound to be intense from the start. I played Austria.
Like nearly all games I played, <tt>Chopin</tt> was anonymous.
<P>
Still, the most interesting aspect of the game, from my standpoint, was
the final position, one turn before the last. I have heard, on more than one
occasion, players say that there is only so much to Diplomacy tactical play
and that, once mastered, there is nothing left to learn. The final position
of game <tt>Chopin</tt> is my answer to this claim. I challenge anyone who
thinks they have mastered tactics to the point of knowing all there is to know
about them to solve the position presented below. This is not a theoretical
exercise or an after-the-fact musing. It is a real position, from a real game,
which was solved by the real player (myself) in real time.
