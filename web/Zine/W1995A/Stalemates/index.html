<h1>Stalemate Lines Again?</h1>

<P>
While soliciting feedback on my <A HREF="/Zine/W1995A/Tactics" >Library of Diplomacy Tactics</A>,
several reviewers suggested adding a section on stalemate lines.
 Although a bit more strategic in scope than the tactics I had
covered thus far, everyone felt that understanding stalemate lines
represented a significant watershed in mastering Diplomacy (rather like
the breakthrough to <I>shodan</I>, to continue the Go analogy).
<H4><CENTER><HR><I>Understanding stalemate lines is almost always
what pushes a player up a notch.<BR>

<P>
There was only one problem -- I had no idea what a stalemate line
was myself!  Fortunately, someone pointed me at Mark Nelson's
archive of articles on stalemate lines, <I>Stalemates A to Y</I>,
which I proceeded to devour.  There is an enormous amount of material
here, representing hundreds -- or more likely thousands -- of
hours of research over the last 25 years.  I was overwhelmed.
I was also struck by the sense of rediscovering a forgotten landscape
that had already been carefully charted by past explorers.  Who
were these men whose words I was reading?
<P>
It quickly became obvious that instead of trying to write an inadequate
summary of what I had just learned, I should instead republish
Mark's archive in <I>The Diplomatic Pouch</I> to make it more
readily accessible.  In the graphical medium of the Web, adding
maps was an obvious imperative.
<P>
Here, then, is the new and improved <A HREF="/Online/StalematesAtoY" ><B>Stalemates A to Y</B></A>
for your reading pleasure!
<P>
I have thus far resisted all temptation to search for more stalemate
lines, or to add my own commentary about what they're good for
and how to use them.  I am proud, however, of the new <A HREF="/Online/StalematesAtoY/visual.htm" >Visual Index to Stalemate Positions</A>
that I have added.  The sheer volume of material necessitates
a better indexing system to help you find the items that you need.
