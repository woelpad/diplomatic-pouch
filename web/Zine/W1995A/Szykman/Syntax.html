<h3>Syntax</h3>
</center>
This section describes the syntax of the various types of orders on the
PBEM judges as well as discusses what the judge does and does not check
for regarding the validity of these orders.  It should be noted that in
this section, validity is considered only in the context of what orders
the judge will accept or reject.  In many cases, the judge will accept
orders which are not legal according to the <!Avalon Hill>Hasbro Diplomacy rules,
although the adjudication or resolution of orders does follow the rules.
As long as the judge accepts an order, it will appear in the move results
and can be used for communication.  As to whether or not the judge should
accept illegal orders, that's a different matter altogether - one that I
will come back to in the <a href="Commentary.html">commentary</a> at the end
of this article.
<p>
The syntax section is divided into the following
sections:<br>
<a href="#movement">Unit Movement Orders</a><br>
<a href="#convoy">Fleet Convoy Orders</a><br>
<a href="#support">Support Orders</a><br>
<a href="#proxy">Proxy Orders</a><br>
<a href="#other">Other Orders</a><br>
<a name=movement></a>
<p><b>Unit Movement Orders</b><p> There are two different types of movement
orders.  The first is a &quot;standard&quot; move, which allows a unit to
move from one space to an adjacent space.  The second type of move is a
convoy move which allows an army to move from one coastal province to another
via fleet convoys.  On the PBEM judges, the syntax for the standard move
is:
<p>
<samp>&lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt; &lt;moves&gt; &lt;d-prov&gt;
</samp>
<p>
and the syntax for an army being convoyed is:
<p>
<samp>&lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt; &lt;moves&gt; &lt;c-prov&gt;
&lt;moves&gt; &lt;c-prov&gt; ... &lt;moves&gt; &lt;d-prov&gt;</samp> <p>
where
<p>
<samp>&lt;type&gt;</samp> = &quot;a&quot;, &quot;army&quot;,
&quot;f&quot;, &quot;fleet&quot;, or &lt;empty&gt;, <br>
<samp>&lt;moves&gt;</samp> = &quot;-&quot;, &quot;->&quot;, &quot;m&quot;,
&quot;move&quot;, &quot;moves&quot;, &quot;move to&quot;, &quot;moves
to&quot;, <br> <samp>&lt;s-prov&gt;</samp> = source province, <br>
<samp>&lt;d-prov&gt;</samp> = destination province, <br>
<samp>&lt;c-prov&gt;</samp> = intermediate water province in a convoy
route.  <br>
<p>
For all moves (including those discussed in subsequent
sections) the judge always checks that there is a unit present in the
source province; any move involving a source province that does not contain
a unit is automatically rejected.  <p> For regular moves, as stated in the
rules, an army may not move into a body of water, a fleet may not move to
an inland province, and a destination province must always be adjacent to
the source province for a move to be valid.  The judge checks for all of
these things and rejects invalid moves.  Switzerland is considered to be
impassable, so the judge rejects moves into Switzerland, even from adjacent
provinces.  <p> For army moves via convoy, the judge checks to make sure
that the unit type is an army, that both the source province and the
destination province are coastal provinces, that all the intermediate
convoy provinces are bodies of water and that the intermediate convoy
provinces contain fleets.  Any army convoy move not satisfying all these
criteria is rejected.
<a name=convoy></a>
<p><b>Fleet Convoy Orders</b><p>
Fleet convoy orders allow one or more fleets to convoy armies from one
coastal province to another.  On the PBEM judges, the syntax for a fleet
convoy order is:  <p> <samp>&lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt; &lt;convoy&gt;
&lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt; &lt;moves&gt; &lt;d-prov&gt;</samp> <p> where
<p> <samp>&lt;convoy&gt;</samp> = &quot;c&quot;, &quot;convoy&quot;,
&quot;convoys&quot;.  <p> Since only fleets can submit convoy orders and
only armies can be convoyed, the judge checks to make sure that the first
unit type in a convoy order is a fleet, that the second type is an army,
and that the destination province for the army is not a body of water.
Any orders where this is not true are rejected.  <p> However, the judge
does <b>not</b> check to ensure that the convoying fleet is in a body of
water, nor does it check that the source and destination provinces for the
army are coastal provinces, nor does it check that the bodies of water
between the army's source and destination provinces contain fleets
(<i>note</i>:  in contrast, as described in the previous section, the judge
does check for the presence of fleets along a convoy path for the army move
via convoy order), nor does it check to see if a destination province is
Switzerland.  This means that a fleet in a coastal land province can submit
a convoy order, that a fleet can order a convoy for an army in any province
to any other land province (including Switzerland) regardless of whether a
source and/or destination province is coastal or not, and irrespective of
the presence of fleets along a possible convoy path.
<a name=support></a>
<p><b>Support Orders</b><p> The two types of support orders are to support
a unit in its current position, or to support an attack.  The syntax for
these two support orders on the PBEM judges is:  <p> <samp>&lt;type&gt;
&lt;s-prov&gt; &lt;support&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt;</samp> <br>
<samp>&lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt; &lt;support&gt; &lt;type&gt;
&lt;s-prov&gt; &lt;moves&gt; &lt;d-prov&gt;</samp> <p> where <p>
</samp>&lt;support&gt;</samp> = &quot;s&quot;, &quot;support&quot;,
&quot;supports&quot;.  <p> According to the rules of Diplomacy, you can
only give support into a space that you could move into.  The judge checks
to see if a support order is feasible in this respect, and rejects orders
that are not.  Consequently, in the first type of order above, the two
source provinces must be adjacent and in the second case the first source
province (your unit's position) must be adjacent to the destination
province of the unit you are supporting (though not necessarily adjacent to
its source province).  Since armies cannot move into water bodies and
fleets can not move to inland provinces, armies cannot support moves into
water and fleets cannot support moves to inland provinces.  Because
Switzerland is impassable, an army can not support an attack into
Switzerland.  These moves will also be rejected by the judge.
<a name=proxy></a>
<p><b>Proxy Orders</b><p>
While there are few no-press games where proxy orders are permitted,
they're included here because there is the occasional game that does
allow them.  On the PBEM judges, the syntax of the proxy order is:  <p>
<samp>&lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt; &lt;proxy&gt; &lt;power&gt;</samp> <p>
where <p> <samp>&lt;proxy&gt;</samp> = &quot;p&quot;, &quot;proxy&quot;,
&quot;proxy to&quot;,<br> <samp>&lt;power&gt;</samp> = the first two or
more characters of a power name (for some reason, the judge does not accept
the one character abbreviations that it accepts for press).
<p>
When proxy is enabled, you can submit an order to proxy control of any unit
- even units that do not belong to you - to another power.  You can also
submit an order for any unit belonging to any power, though for you to
actually take control of that unit it must have been proxied to you by its
owner and not another power.  When you proxy control of a unit to another
power, this is shown in the judge's confirmation of your moves.  When you
submit orders for units that are not yours, that also shows up in the move
confirmation message.
<p>
Once the moves process, all orders that proxy control of one unit to another
power show up in the judge's move results regardless of whether or not that
power actually used the proxy by ordering the unit, and regardless of whether
or not the order was submitted by the owner of the unit.  However, orders
that you submit for units of other powers only show up in the move results
if moves for those units were proxied to you by the other power.  Orders
you submit for units that were not proxied to you do not appear in the move
results.  <p> One final bit of information: when a unit which is proxied to
a power is not ordered by that power and the judge processes the moves, the
result for that unit is &quot;No order processed&quot;.  It should be noted
that the judge's interpretation of a unit marked &quot;No order
processed&quot; is not actually no order at all, but a hold order.  Thus,
you can support a unit that you are proxying to somebody and if they don't
order the unit, the unit will hold and receive support despite the fact
that no order was submitted for the unit.
<a name=other></a>
<p><b>Other Orders</b>
<p>
On the PBEM judges, the syntax of the hold order is:
<p> <samp>&lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt; &lt;holds&gt;</samp> <p> where
<p> <samp>&lt;holds&gt;</samp> = &quot;h&quot;, &quot;hold&quot;,
&quot;holds&quot;, &quot;stand&quot;, &quot;stands&quot;.  <p> The syntax
of a retreat order is one of:  <p> <samp>&lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt;
&lt;moves&gt; &lt;d-prov&gt;</samp> <br> <samp>&lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt;
&lt;disband&gt;</samp> <p> where <p> <samp>&lt;disband&gt;</samp> =
&quot;d&quot;, &quot;disband&quot;.  <p> The syntax of adjustment orders is
one of:  <p> <samp>&lt;build&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt; </samp> <br>
<samp>&lt;remove&gt; &lt;type&gt; &lt;s-prov&gt;</samp> <br>
<samp>&lt;waive&gt;</samp> <p> where <p> <samp>&lt;build&gt;</samp> =
&quot;b&quot;, &quot;build&quot; or &lt;empty&gt;, <br>
<samp>&lt;remove&gt;</samp> = &quot;r&quot;, &quot;remove&quot;,
&quot;d&quot;, &quot;disband&quot; or &lt;empty&gt;, <br>
<samp>&lt;waive&gt;</samp> = &quot;w&quot;, &quot;waive&quot;.
<p>
Given the simplicity of these orders, there's not much room for flexibility.
The limitations of using these orders should be rather obvious: you can't
retreat or disband a unit during a retreat phase unless it has been
dislodged, you can't build or waive a build during an adjustment phase
unless you have more supply centers than units, you can't build a unit
unless you have a free home supply center (though in a chaos game any
supply center you own counts as a home supply center for this rule), you
can't build fleets in inland provinces, etc.  Any orders that are not valid
will be rejected by the judge.
