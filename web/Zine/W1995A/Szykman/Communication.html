<h3>Communication</h3></center>
The previous section described the syntax of different types of orders.
This section discusses different ways of communicating without press
using these various moves.  However, not only should this set of techniques
provide you with the means to do that, but it should also give you a good
idea of what to keep an eye out for as the possible recipient of
communications from other powers to you.  As is shown in this section, one
can communicate with powers that are quite far away geographically.  Your
neighbor's neighbor may be your enemy's enemy, meaning that you should not
be looking for communication just from your neighbors, but from other
potential allies as well.
<p>
You will notice that many of the orders discussed below are not legal
moves according to the rules of Diplomacy.  However, that a move is
illegal does not mean that you cannot submit the order.  In hand-adjudicated
diplomacy, you can order an army from London to Naples.  It won't succeed,
but you can order it.  While the PBEM judges are a little more restrictive,
they too allow certain types of infeasible orders.  Keep the distinction
in mind as you may find yourself saying &quot;But you can't do that!&quot;
in response to many of the techniques I present.
<p>
The communication section is divided into the
following sections:<br>

<p><b>Declaring War</b><p>
Declaring war is probably the easiest thing to do without the use of press,
since it is done almost exclusively without press even in games that allow
press.  Declaring war is usually a means to an end, and not an end itself.
In other words, one does not usually decide to try to communicate declaration
of war to somebody, as much as one engages in acts that negatively affect
the position of another power in order to improve one's own position.  This
negative impact is taken by the other power as an act of war, and is followed
by a retaliation in the form of offensive or defensive moves.
<p>
Since there is usually not an explicit attempt to communicate a declaration
of war, I won't belabor the point.  If anyone isn't aware that somebody who
is attacking you or supporting attacks against you might be declaring war,
you may want to observe a couple of Diplomacy games before jumping into one
yourself.
<a name=suggest></a>
<p><b>Suggesting Moves</b><p>
There are a number of ways to suggest a move to another power.  The first
way is using a move order.  The only way to suggest a move using a move order
is to request a convoy from another power by ordering your own unit as if it
were receiving the convoy you want.  For example, if you are Turkey and you
want Austria to use its fleet in the Ionian Sea to convoy your army from
Greece to Naples, you would order <samp>Army Greece -> Ionian Sea ->
Naples</samp>.
<p>
As stated previously in the syntax section, the PBEM judge rejects moves if
there is no valid convoy path (fleets in each of the bodies of water you
specify) for the order.  In other words, the judge would reject the above
move if there were no fleet in Ion.  In hand-adjudicated games, that
restriction does not exist, allowing you to request convoys more than one
phase in advance.  Thus, if Austria had a fleet in the Adriatic, you could
send in the above order to suggest that Austria move to Ion and convoy you
the subsequent turn.  Whether or not it is likely that Austria would do so
is of course a different matter.
<p>
Two other ways to suggest moves without press are by either supporting or
convoying the move you want to suggest.  For example, if as Germany you
order a unit in Holland to support a French unit from Picardy to Belgium,
the meaning of that support is an indication that you want France to make
that move.  Likewise, if as Germany you order a fleet in the North Sea to
convoy a French army from Belgium to London, that too has an obvious meaning.
<p>
In games which are hand adjudicated, you can support or convoy pretty much
any move at all.  Unless your GM decides to impose his own requirement for
valid moves as the judge does (which is usually not the case), there is
nothing to prevent you from supporting or convoying any unit from anywhere
to anywhere, regardless of whether or not the move is possible.  You can
convoy fleets, convoy units to inland provinces, or order support from
anywhere to anywhere; you can even send in orders for nonexistent units.
An extreme example would be Russia suggesting that France attack England
by using an army in Warsaw to support an army from Paris to London when
there isn't even an army in Paris (not that an army in Paris could get to
London if there were one there [not that Russia could support that move
from Warsaw even if the move were possible {get the idea?}]).  In other
words, the language of communication in hand-adjudicated games is extremely
flexible, allowing you to suggest virtually any move at all if you have a
unit to spare.
<p>
In PBEM judge games, the fact that the judge checks certain things for a
support order to be valid cuts down on your options.  The judge only accepts
support orders that follow the <!Avalon Hill> Hasbro Diplomacy rules - meaning that
you have to be able to move into the space into which you are offering
support.  Because you have to be adjacent to that space, you can only
suggest moves using support orders if you happen to want a power's unit
to move adjacent to you, which is usually not the case.
<p>
Fortunately, the judge is not nearly as strict with convoy orders.  The
judge does not check for the existence of valid convoy paths, so you can
order convoys that could not possibly succeed.  This means that if you are
Germany and are at war with France, you can use a fleet in the North Sea to
order a convoy for an English Army in London to Brest (to suggest that
England join you in attacking France) even if there is no fleet in the
English Channel to complete the convoy.  Aside from not having enough fleets,
the judge also accepts orders for a convoy that is invalid because there is
no convoy path that includes a particular body of water.  For instance, a
German fleet in the North Sea could never be part of a path for the convoy
of an army from Naples to Marseilles because the army could not both leave
and reenter the Mediterranean through the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  Yet, the
judge will accept this order as well.
<p>
But what really makes the convoy order a useful tool for communication is
that the judge allows a fleet to order a convoy even if it is in a coastal
province.  This allows you to use any fleet to communicate even if it is
not in a body of water.  Furthermore, the judge does not check that the
source province and destination province are coastal provinces, so you can
order convoys for armies from inland provinces to inland provinces.
<p>
Because there are so few restrictions on what the judge will allow for
convoy orders, using a fleet you can suggest nearly any move at all.
There are a couple of exceptions: because the judge checks to make sure
that convoy destination province is not a body of water, you can't suggest
an attack on a body of water using a convoy order.  Finally, since the
judge only allows you to order convoys for armies, you can't suggest
orders for another power's fleet using convoy orders.
<p>
The last way to suggest a move is using a proxy order, although proxy
no-press games are not very common.  Because the judge
will accept an order for the proxy of a unit that does not belong to you,
you can suggest that a power proxy a unit to you (or to another power) by
ordering that proxy yourself.  For instance, Italy can submit an order
that proxies a Russian unit to England, and while the order can not
succeed, it will show up in the move results. (Interestingly enough,
there seems to be a bug in the judge code that prevents the order from
succeeding in the once case when it should: if Russia proxies that unit
to Italy, Italy's proxy order is a valid order for that unit and control
should therefore be proxied over to England.  The result, however, is
&quot;No order processed&quot;.)
<a name=peace></a>
<p><b>Proposing Peace and Forming Alliances</b><p>
There are a number of ways to communicate a desire for peace to another power.
One rather obvious way is to support a unit of a power that you want peace
with.  For instance, if Italy wants to propose peace to Austria in Spring
1901, Venice can support Austria in Trieste.  Even if the Austrian fleet moves
instead of holding and the support is not used, Italy's peaceful intentions
will be understood.  You can also propose an alliance by supporting an attack
against another power, or even supporting an attack which is clearly in the
direction of another power.  As was mentioned in the previous section,
communication using the support order is relatively easy in hand-adjudicated
games but is  somewhat restrictive when playing with the PBEM judges since
the judges only accept orders that are legal according to the Diplomacy rules.
<p>
You can also communicate a proposal for peace or an alliance using a convoy
order.  The peace proposal is communicated by using a fleet to order a convoy
for an army of the power you want peace with to Switzerland.  Switzerland,
which according to the rules is not in the game because of its neutrality, is
a clear indication of your desire not to be at war with a power.  To propose
an alliance with a power, you order a convoy for one of its armies to a
supply center or province that belongs to an enemy power.  Both of these are
relatively easy to do since the judge is not very strict about the convoy
orders it accepts.
<p>
Another way to express a desire for peace is to propose a demilitarized zone
with a power.  There are a variety of ways of doing this - some a little more
risky than others.  Probably the best way to do it if you have units
available is to force a province to demilitarized by setting up a self-standoff
(i.e. a self-bounce) that will keep it empty.  A common example of this in a
Spring 1901 phase is for the French armies in Marseilles and Paris to bounce
in Burgundy.  That communicates your desire for a DMZ in Burgundy and also keeps
the German army in Munich out that turn.  In this case, France would probably
self-standoff once and leave the next turn (in order to take Spain and/or Belgium).
This can be risky since France doesn't know whether Germany has &quot;agreed&quot;
to the DMZ.  Later in the game, when you have units to spare, instead of leaving
the next move you can continue to self bounce until the unit of the power
leaves or at least communicates some peaceful intentions to you.
<p>
Another way to set up a DMZ is to end up with a <i>de facto</i> DMZ.  This
is done also through bouncing, but using one unit of two different powers.
For example, in Spring 1901, both Russia and Austria may move units to
Galicia and bounce.  They can then continue to order the same units there,
repeatedly bouncing, without ordering other units to attack each other or
to support the attack into Galicia (see Declaring War, above).  This approach
is effective in keeping Galicia empty, but requires both powers to dedicate
a unit to do so.  Of course, having expressed the desire for a DMZ, one of
the powers can stop bouncing and hope that the other, after moving into
Galicia due to the lack of bounce, wishes to preserve the DMZ and pulls back
out.  If both powers are agreeable, they can both then use their units elsewhere.
<p>
You can also use the techniques described in the previous section for suggesting
moves to communicate a proposal for a DMZ to another power.  This is achieved
by suggesting that the other power's unit move away from the province you want
to demilitarize.  For example, an Austrian fleet can order a convoy for a
Russian army in Warsaw to Prussia to indicate a desired DMZ in Galicia.
<p>
One more way to attempt to set up a DMZ is simply to not move into a space
and hope that a neighboring power doesn't move there either.  This is a bit more
risky because by moving away from a province without explicitly communicating
the desire for a DMZ, you leave an opening for another power to move right in.
For instance, if France moves Marseilles to Spain and Paris to Picardy in Spring
1901, he risks letting Germany walk right into Burgundy that move.
<p>
Once established, this type of DMZ sounds more tenuous than the others since
it was never explicitly expressed by both powers.  However, DMZs tend to be
more temporary in no-press games than in games with press.  It is not uncommon
for DMZs that were set up bilaterally to only last as long as both powers are
otherwise occupied with wars at other fronts, or so long as neither power would
have a significant payoff from breaking the DMZ, so it may be more proper to
say that all types of DMZs are equally tenuous.  One should be cautious in
leaving DMZs of any type undefended or underdefended.
<p>
Finally, if proxy orders are allowed, you can show peaceful intentions by
proxying one of your units to another power.  Manus Hand came up with a way
of proposing a three way alliance by you ordering a proxy for a second power's
unit over to a third power.  I'm not sure if this has ever been done since
proxy no-press games are uncommon and because most people don't know that you
can submit a proxy order for a unit that isn't yours, but the intent of such
an order will hopefully be clear to the other powers.
<p>
It should be noted that you can use more than one of the above techniques at
once if you have the units to spare.  The more ways you communicate something,
the more likely it is that the recipient will get the message.  While this
won't guarantee that the other power will accept your proposal, it does reduce
the chances that he misses it.
<a name=draws></a>
<p><b>Proposing Draws</b><p>
Most of the methods for communication have been discussed in the previous
sections on suggesting moves and proposing peace and alliances.  Many of
the ways of proposing draws are used using similar communications, but in
a different context.  For instance, you can communicate peace by ordering
a convoy for another power's army to Switzerland.  If you are one of three
remaining powers and you convoy one of each of their armies to Switzerland,
(and perhaps even one of your own armies if you have an extra fleet to order)
the suggestion of peace among the remaining powers is a draw proposal.
You can similarly suggest a draw by supporting units of all other powers to
hold, ordering proxies for various units of one power to the other, or by
repeatedly suggesting peace using any of the other various means that were
discussed above.
<p>
The one way to further emphasize your desire for a draw is to start waiving
builds.  Waiving a build implies that you have no further use for additional
units, which indicates that you don't plan on further expansion.  Of course,
you may not want to waive build if you have a defensive use for additional
units, even if you do want a draw.
<p>
Obviously, the best thing to do to achieve a draw is to establish stalemate
lines first whenever that is possible.  From that safe position, you can
propose a draw using support or convoys without the danger of being attacked.
Furthermore, since some Diplomacy players refuse to accept draws unless the
position is a stalemate, it is much more likely that a draw will pass.  If
you communicate a desire for a draw, other powers who agree to the draw can
also start moving toward stalemate lines even if not every power agrees to
the draw.  You will often be able to help establish and support stalemate
lines for other powers as well as yourself.  Once stalemate lines protect
all the powers and not just you, any powers who did not agree to the draw
earlier are left with little choice but to accept it.
<p>
<a name=discussion></a>
<p><b>Discussion</b><p>
When playing in no-press games, one should
always examine the move results carefully.  At the very least, one should
scan all move results looking for the name of your power in somebody else's
orders.  You shouldn't be looking only for units that are attacking yours,
but you should look for somebody trying to support or convoy your units.
You also shouldn't be looking at just the orders of your neighbors, but
of all the powers.  A power quite far from you may be trying to ask you
to attack a neighbor, or may be asking neighbor to attack you.
<p>
By looking only for your power's name in other players' orders, you may
be missing important information .  You should also be looking for
convoy or support orders that involve provinces (not only supply centers
but non-supply center provinces) that you occupy.  By &quot;occupy&quot;,
I don't mean that you necessarily have a unit in the province, but one
that is behind your front lines or that you consider to be within your
sphere of control.  For instance, if Russia has eliminated Turkey, a
suggested attack on Smyrna is a suggested attack against Russia.  As
will be described below, intentional bounces also have meaning, so you
should keep an eye out for a power that is bouncing its own units as well.
<p>
However, you should be looking for communication not just to you, but
between other powers as well.  If you only look for communication that
involves your units or your territories, you will miss information that
is as important if not more-so: everyone else's communication!  Because all
communication is done through orders, which everyone gets to see, there
is no such thing as private communication without press.  In a game with
no-partial press, would you only read messages that are addressed to you?
Obviously not; you'd read them all.
<p>
It's relatively easy to tell which
powers are attacking which others.  You should make it your business to
know not just that, but which powers are suggesting attacks against you,
who is trying to create alliances with their neighbors (or your neighbors
for that matter), who is making enemies, who can be trusted and who can't.
You can't know a power's future intentions, but you can know a power's
current standing with any other power based on past history as well as
anybody else does, because all communication between them was there for
you to see.
<p>
Now that you have a variety of techniques for communicating without press,
probably the most important cautionary comment I can make is to use them
with discretion.  In some cases, you can order a unit to do something you
want it to do and still communicate with that order.  However, more often
than not, using a unit to communicate means not using it to improve your
offensive or defensive position, attack a power or defend yourself.  You
are far better off holding off on communication attempts until you can
spare a unit than you are in detrimentally affecting your position by
wasting a potentially useful move.
<p>
Another point I wish to draw your attention to is that just about every
order discussed in the syntax section can be used to communicate a
number of different things: a DMZ, an alliance, a suggested move, etc.
You should keep in mind that there may be situations in which although
your intention is clear to you, it may not be clear to the power with
whom you are communicating.
<p>
This ambiguity can cause problems or can
be used to your advantage, if you are trying to cause a problem.)
For instance, as England you may convoy a Germany fleet from Holland
to Norway to suggest create an alliance against Russia.  Germany could
interpret this as your offering a convoy and might order Holland to
convoy to Norway the next move.  If your next move is to attack Norway
thinking that Germany will move against Russia in another way, Germany
may feel deceived or irritated at having wasted Holland's move on a
convoy that you didn't provide.
<p>
Similarly, if you support power to
hold or to attack another power simply to indicate a desire for peace
or for an alliance, that power may misinterpret your action as an
offer of support and may expect it the following phase.  If there is
no detrimental effect to not receiving the expected support, it
generally won't cause problems.  If, on the other hand, the power loses
a supply center or a good position due to not receiving your support,
there may be repercussions to you.  While ambiguity can not always be
avoided, it should be in cases where the consequences could be
significant (unless, of course, that is your intent).
<p>
One last note of caution is that just as with games that allow press,
deceit and stabs occur in no-press games.  They may even occur more often
since I've heard people say that it's easier to stab in no-press games
because your ally seems more anonymous than somebody with whom you have
actually exchanged written messages.  So play as cautiously as you would
in any game: don't leave yourself vulnerable to attack by an ally, don't
assume that any DMZ or alliance is permanent, and always consider the
possibility that communications could be intentionally ambiguous or
misleading if the sending power has something to gain from it.
