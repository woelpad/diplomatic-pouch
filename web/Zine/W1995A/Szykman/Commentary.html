<h3>Digressive Commentary Regarding the Judge Code</h3></center>

Many PBEM players, particularly those who do not play no-press Diplomacy,
may not have known much about the details of what the judge does and 
does not test in order for orders to be accepted.  While I don't lose
a great deal of sleep over what the judge does and does not allow, I
must admit that it bothers me a bit.  It's not so much whether or not
the judge checks to see if a set of orders is legal that bothers me,
but rather the lack of consistency in what gets checked.
<p>
Let's take a look at a couple of examples:
<UL>
<li> The judge will let you use a fleet to order a convoy to an inland
province.  Why does it not check to see if the destination province is
legal (i.e. a coastal province) when it does check to make sure that a
destination province is not inland when you order an army through a
convoy?
<li> Why is it that Switzerland is an allowable destination province for
a convoy, but not for a support order or a move order?  Obviously none
of those orders to Switzerland could succeed when moves are processed,
but why allow some and not others?
<li> Switzerland aside, why can you order a fleet to convoy to a place
that the convoy can't possibly reach when you can't order a move or
support to a place you can't reach?
<li> Why can a fleet that can't be used to convoy (one that is in
a coastal province) still submit a convoy order, when an army that can't
be used to convoy (one that is in an inland province) can't order a 
convoy move?
<li>  Why does the judge put some proxy orders in the move
results but not others?  For instance, if Italy proxies control of a
unit to England but England doesn't use the proxy, the order still
appears in the move results.  However, if England submits an order
for an Italian unit and Italy hasn't proxied control of that unit
to England, the order does not appear.
</UL>
These are just a few examples - the <a href="Syntax.html">syntax</a>
section above is full of many more.  
<p>
As I see it, the judge should either allow <b>any</b> move, whether it
is feasible or not, or it should reject <b>all</b> infeasible moves.

Rejecting all infeasible moves would hinder one's ability to communicate
without press, but would by no means eliminate it.  My own preference
would be to have the judge allow any order, feasible or not.  This would
make communication much easier (as it is with hand-adjudicated games).
But that's not the reason for my having that preference.
<p>
What it comes down it is what is the role of the judge?  If the role of
the judge <i>is</i> to ensure feasibility for moves, then it should do
so for all moves, not just some of them.  I'm of the opposite opinion.
As I see it, the judge is an adjudicator, not a babysitter.  It shouldn't
look over my shoulder and tell me I'm making mistakes - submitting correct
orders is my own responsibility.  If I order an army from Greece to the
Ionian Sea, the judge rejects it telling my that that is not a legal move.
Why?  The judge should accept the move (as a human adjudicator would)
and when moves process, the move fails and it's too bad for me for
not having paid attention, just like in hand-adjudicated games.  After
all, could you imagine being at the table in a FTF game and when they
start to adjudicate moves they get to your order for Army Greece - Ionian
and you say "Wait!  You should have told me I was making a mistake so
that I could enter a different move!"  You'd either get laughed at or
beaten up.
<p> 
Because the judge is a computer and not a human, it is understandable 
that it checks actual syntax of orders.  If I misspell &quot;hold&quot;
as &quot;lold&quot; in a hand-adjudicated game, the GM would correctly
interpret the order.  The judge is not, not being a little more rigid
in its syntax, would not correctly parse the order.  However, testing
of correct syntax of orders says nothing about their validity or
feasibility, and could be done independently of all the other tests
that currently cause the judge to reject syntactically correct orders.
<p>
But I'm quite curious about other peoples' opinions.  Do you agree, 
disagree, or not care?  Should the judge be consistent, and if so, which
way - by testing everything or testing nothing?  If enough people agree
with me, I would be willing to compile a comprehensive list of
inconsistencies.  Eliminating tests should be relatively easy from a
coding point of view. In terms of the other side of the coin - testing
everything - most of the changes would also be simple to implement.
There are a couple of exceptions, such as calculating all possible
convoy paths for testing feasibility of convoy orders, but nothing that
couldn't be overcome if people think it matters.  Let me know what you 
think.
