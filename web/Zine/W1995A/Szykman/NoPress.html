<h1>Communication in <br> No-Press Diplomacy</h1>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
In this article, I'll be discussing how to communicate in Diplomacy
without press.  The readers of this article probably cover quite a range
of expertise, including players who have never played a no-press Diplomacy
game, players who have played or observed a no-press game without
realizing that communication is possible, players who have some experience
with no-press Diplomacy, and &quot;the experts&quot; who know all the in's
and out's.
<p>
This article should benefit people in
almost every category.  For people in the first two categories, it should
provide a good introduction to the concept of communication without press.
For people in the first three categories, it should give a variety of
techniques for no-press communication.  I've done some extensive testing of
the play-by-e-mail (PBEM) judges, so there are probably even a few people
in the fourth category who can pick up some useful information that they
didn't know from this article.  I myself, having played in 25-30 no-press
games, still learned a couple of little things I didn't know in doing that
testing.  
<p>
The first time I played a no-press Diplomacy game, I was a
member of the first category and had no idea that one could communicate
without press.  I assumed everyone was playing with an
every-man-for-himself strategy (excuse the sexist idiom, but in this
community it's probably not too far off).  Needless to say, I was rapidly
obliterated by players who (unlike me) knew what they were doing.
<p>
Subsequently, I picked up the idea of communication, but it took quite a
while to learn how to do it well (or at least as well as I can do).  I'm
not really one for observing games, so I'd play in no-press games, and try
to learn the ropes by watching what the other players were doing, losing
quite a few games in the process.  When I finally won my first no-press
game, I felt I had paid my dues getting there, having a win-and-draw to
loss ratio quite a bit lower than for my with-press games.  Had there been
an article like this one, I probably could have cut that learning curve by
quite a bit, and so I hope that other people find this article useful.
<p>
This article is meant to be useful for the general reader.  Since many (if
not most) of the
readers of <B>The Diplomatic Pouch</B> play Diplomacy via the PBEM judges,
the next section discusses information about the
syntax of various types of orders.  In the absence of press, the only way
to communicate with other players is through the orders you submit for
your units.  Players of PBEM judge Diplomacy, even those who are familiar
with the general syntax of orders, should still read that section because in
addition to the basic syntax, implementation-specific information is given,
regarding what the judge does and does not allow.  This, in turn, affects
the types of communication that can be achieved via the judges.  Players
of hand-adjudicated (face to face, postal or non-judge email) Diplomacy
may want to skip directly to the section on
communication which follows the syntax section.  That section contains
a general discussion of ways to communicate without press, and describes
the subset of those ways that are actually allowed by the judges.  The
article then concludes with a brief commentary on the judge code.
<p>
Finally, while this article is directed towards people who want to learn
about communication in no-press games, it should be noted that all of the
techniques for communicating without press can also be used in games
that do allow press.  In games that allow press, players tend to scrutinize
move results less carefully, and it is more likely that attempted
communication will be missed.  However, the lack of scrutiny can also work
to your benefit.  For example, in a no-partial press game, you can't use
press to make plans without having everyone see them, but there's a
possibility that you can communicate without press to suggest moves or
encourage an attack without everyone noticing it.  If you are lucky, the
intended recipient will notice, and the intended victim won't.  Of course,
keep in mind that it could also happen the other way around and backfire.
