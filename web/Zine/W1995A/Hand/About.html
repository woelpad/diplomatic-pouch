About The Diplomatic Pouch

<HR>
<H3>Hi Ho!</H3>
Notice anything?  Well, in case you didn't, brace yourself.
<b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b> you know and love is no longer.
Yes, what used to be <i>just</i> this way excellent Webzine has turned
into <b>The
Diplomacy Home Page</B> (taking over for Josh Smith's page).  As I'm sure
you've noticed, the Pouch now contains a bunch of subPouches, a mere one of
which is the magazine you've grown so accustomed to curling up with.
<P>
I won't go into any details here on the new layout, the contents
of and plans for the various sections -- this is done elsewhere.  Instead,
what we're concerned with here is what's happened to The Zine, how this
came about, and why.
<p>
<H3>Why The Pouch Metamorphosed</H3>
From the beginning, <b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b> was intended to provide forums
for all types of Diplomacy play -- not just play-by-email, and, indeed, not
even just provide only what are called "sercon" ("serious constructive")
articles.  The grand vision was to make <b>The Pouch</b> <i>the</i> zine
for the whole Hobby.
<p>
<b>The Pouch</B> was handicapped in its effort to fulfill this charter, and to
some
extent, it still is.  However, as the year wore on, word about the magazine
spread and some postal players and tournament goers began to take notice
and to enter into correspondences with me.  <b>The Pouch</b> began publishing
announcements of upcoming face-to-face tournaments, and was actively working
with postal 'zines on limited cooperative ventures.
<P>
It was a pet peeve of mine that tournament announcements (in particular)
would be published in <b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b>.  Not because I'm against
having
these events publicized or being the one publicizing them, of course,
but rather because after each issue is published, the plan was to
never touch it again -- just as if it was an old-fashioned paper magazine.
This meant that tournament announcements would stay in the zine forever,
even though the chances of someone ten years from now wanting to read
about the "upcoming" 1995 tournaments was very remote.  Why should I pay
for diskspace to keep useless information around?
<P>
Another problem was the magazine's links to other Diplomacy pages.  This took
the form of a Simon Szykman article entitled "We Are Not Alone" which
was published in the initial issue of the 'zine.  Simply by virtue of the
way the world works, this article was constantly being updated, in direct
contradiction to the plan that the published issues of the magazine would
be set in stone.  Compounding this, there was no way to tell you, the
all-important reader, when these updates were made and what they entailed.
<P>
The new layout of The Pouch addresses these issues and more.  I'll once
more resist the temptation to go into the contents and agenda for the
various other sections of <b>The Pouch</b>, leaving it to you to explore
them for yourself.  I hope you like what you see, and the plans for the future.
<P>
I also want to say that while the original vision of <b>The Pouch</b>
as <i>the</i>
zine for the Hobby might actually be a little bit closer to reality now, one
thing I have learned over the past year is that it's a very big hobby.  I am
very happy and proud of the respect that <b>The Pouch</b> has garnered from
everyone everywhere, but I know now that the best it could ever hope to become
would be one of many hundreds of Hobby efforts.
<P>
<H3>What Happened To The Zine</H3>
In keeping with this plan to make the zine issues unchanging beasts (well,
as authors' e-mail addresses change, this much will be kept updated), the
"We Are Not Alone" article was pulled out of the Spring, 1995 movement issue.
Not only did it bother me to be having to update this article all the time,
but I received mail from more than one reader that the set of links to
other resources seemed to be in an odd, out of the way place, to say the least.
So this article initially became the genesis of the new Online Resources
section
of The Pouch.  Josh Smith, when apprised by Simon Szykman of this new section,
indicated a willingness to hand over
the mantle of "The Diplomacy Home Page" and so the Online Resources section,
as you can tell if you visit it, became a lot more than this initial article.
<P>
One of the resources to which the new Online Resources section links is the
"Openings Library,"
initially published in the Spring 1995 Retreat issue of the magazine and
billed as an unfinished, changing document.  In the remodel, then, the
library was removed
from the magazine and became the first deposit in what will be called
the "DP Library;" those resources contained and maintained in The Pouch
itself.
<P>
Other obvious removals from the various issues of the magazine, per the
discussion above, were the articles concerning face-to-face tournament play.
As mentioned, it seemed that these would soon be outdated, and so they
became the initial foundation of a new "outside the zine" section
devoted to face-to-face play.
<P>
Finally, a number of factors influenced the creation of what is called
"The Diplomacy Showcase."  Some of these included the interest in running
more games than just the one <tt>dippouch</tt> game for which the magazine
is known; games which would educate, entertain, and tie in with articles
in the magazine.  The first games to be showcased will be an educational
series ("exactly why'd he make that move?"), with plans for a No-Press Payola
game (see my <a href="/Zine/W1995A/Payola">article on Payola</a> and Simon's
<a href="/Zine/W1995A/Szykman/NoPress.html">article on No-Press</a> elsewhere in this
issue).
<P>
The <tt>dippouch</tt> game, as the faithful reader knows, was
chronicled in a Stephen Beaulieu subzine called <b>The Garden</b>.  Due
to the nature of the game, the subzine had news to report about the game
at various times throughout the year -- not only at the publication date
of the main magazine.  Because of this, there was always a logisitical
issue --
<b>The Garden</b> would be published and then updated a couple times as time
went by in each issue of <b>The Pouch</b>.  Yick!
<P>
So <b>The Garden</b> -- and all information about the <tt>dippouch</tt> game --
has been removed from the new incarnation of the magazine and placed in
Stephen's Diplomacy Showcase, which is one of the many constantly-updated
sections of the <i>new</i> Pouch (indeed, the magazine will be the only
section which will publish to deadlines).
<p>
To sum up, if you're looking for something from the above selection of
articles, you're looking in the wrong place if you're still looking in
The Zine.  <b>The Pouch</b> is now a great big, better organized place.
<P>
<H3>Who's With Me?</H3>
Did I do all this alone?  Heck, no.  I couldn't.  No one could.  The longtime
reader knows that even publishing the zine is not a one man job.  Over the
first year of the zine, I've adopted two <i>ad hoc</i> co-publishers.  First,
<b>Simon Szykman</b>,
who basically single-handedly put the Fall Movement issue out.  Second,
<b>Stephen Beaulieu</b>, who did the same for Fall Retreat.  (I had a
very busy real-life Fall!)
<p>
When putting the vision of the <i>new</i> Pouch together in my mind, I sent the
initial ideas to these two great friends of mine asking if they would like to
be involved in moving <b>The Pouch</b> toward this vision.  To their immense
credit
and my elation, they both said yes.  The three of us formed ourselves into
what we came to call the "DP Council" and we set to work designing and
building the <i>new</i> Pouch.
<P>
While this remodeling effort progressed, the Winter issue of the magazine
was being put together. I received the <a href="/Zine/W1995A/Tactics">Tactics Library</a>
from <b>Matt Self</b> as an article contribution.  I was understandably
impressed by his effort, and before I knew it, Matt had knocked himself out
doing a <b>lot</b> more stuff for The Pouch.  I couldn't resist asking him to
join the DP Council, and he's been an integral part of the team ever since,
even bringing in a graphic designer to assist in setting up the new scheme of
things.
<P>
We're sure that <b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b> will continue to evolve as
time passes.  Don't be surprised to be back here in the "About The Pouch"
article reading about some other minor or major Zine changes which are
implemented with the next issue, due out in March.
<P>
Well, that's the story.  I hope you like the current issue of the magazine
and <b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b> as a whole.
I don't think the zine suffered as a result of our efforts; rather, I believe
<b>The Pouch</b> benefits by this new organization.  I also believe that this
new
organization leaves room for growth, for the addition of other sections
(which as yet are just taking root in this fertile mind of mine).  As you can
see if you take a stroll around, the DP Council is looking for a
few more members, because we realize we can't do everything we want to do
without them.  Perhaps you are thinking you are just the one to fill a void,
and if you <i>are</i> thinking that (I hope you are), don't hesitate to
get in touch.
<H3>The Benefactor List Grows!</H3>
I hope you'll all be happy (and perhaps a bit ashamed) to know that
<B>The Diplomatic Pouch</b>
received its first cash contribution from a happy reader.  I, as the
Publisher, couldn't have been more pleased to graciously accept, from my
new hero,
<a href=mailto:stevel@clinton.com>stevel@clinton.com</a>, a twenty-five
dollar bill sent to me through snail mail.
<P>
Yes, that's right.  A twenty-five dollar bill.  Those of you outside
the United States might or might not know that currency is not issued
in twenty-five dollar units.  Nonetheless, the twenty-five dollar bill I
received was legal tender in every way, and I've even passed -- er, spent --
it already.
<P>
I used the twenty-five dollars which Steve sent to fund the remodeling of the
Pouch.  Just think what could be done if you too contributed to offset the
diskspace and access charges which <b>The Diplomatic Pouch</B> makes my wife
write a monthly check to support.
<P>
<b>Thank you thank you thank you, Steve!</b>
I promised from the inaugural issue that anyone
contributing money would be listed in a benefactor's list in the magazine.
Well, you've got the list to yourself for now.  And in my book, you
deserve it.
<P>
<H3>Enjoy The Pouch, Everyone!</H3>
