Manus,

I think the best cross reference would be something like this. In my
current Masterclass, there's a parenthetical remark, "(following Dan
Shoham)". You might add, "And see Dan's current Academy entry for an
example from a real game", and then put a link. Also, in the little
Questions and Answers at the bottom of my article, in my Answer to Q1, I
actually mention Dan's game, but not by name. You could add the same link
there.

Apparently the file for the "Challenge" part of Dan's article is not yet
ready. Or for some reason I couldn't get to it. There is a grey question
mark button that's inoperative. I would like to see what the file says, if
possible.

Lastly, it would be nice if there could be a crosslink back from Dan's
Academy page to my article. I'll leave it to you to decide how, in
conjunction with Dan. (Or if you'd rather, I'll figure out how I'd like it
to be done, as soon as I can get a look at the 'Challenge' file.)

I did say (F1995 movement) that since you had disappeared from the net, I
thought your column would suffer a temporary absence. Manus should feel
free to insert something like [Ed.: Happily, there was no interruption in
Dan's column.]. This has the virtue of honesty, since I did, at the time,
think that Dan had disappeared, and of veracity, since in fact he hadn't
(to any intent or purpose).

Manus (etc.),

I think you should just add a "For further explanation of the type of
endgame strategy at work here, see...." with a link to my article.

And I think it would be best placed on Dan's "Challenge" page.

But if Dan has a different idea, that's fine.
