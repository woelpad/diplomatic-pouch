The Diplomacy Showcase serves as a venue for games that might be of
interest to the entire Dip Community.  Some games are present for
entertainment value, others exist to instruct and inform people about
tactics and strategy.

Exactly what information is available at the site depends on the nature of
the game being presented.  Some games, like dippouch, will have updates
every month with the trading, as well as articles about the game.

Others will have updates with every movement phase, possibly including
press.  Still others will be presented in their entirety after the fact,
perhaps with explanations as to why certain moves we taken at the time.

The make-up of the game and the style of the presentation will be
determined by the gm and by the people doing the leg-work for the section
(I imagine mainly me)  We will be sponsoring many of the games, but people
will be able to suggest games to be showcased, and if there is the interest
and ability to get it on-line, we will do it.

Well, that is my somewhat rambling take on the Showcase section.  It needs
to be more properly formatted so it can be available and intelligble to our
readership, but it's a start.
