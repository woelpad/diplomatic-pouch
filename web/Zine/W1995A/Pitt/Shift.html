This issue: a discussion of the Shift variants, Shift-Left and Shift-Right.
The judge's <tt>info.shift</tt> file describes these variants as follows:
<blockquote><em>
The Shift-Right and Shift-Left variants of Diplomacy follow the same rules
as normal Diplomacy; the only difference is
in the starting positions of the powers. The concept is simple: everyone
begins the game with their units occupying the home centers of another power.
</blockquote></em>

<P>
This sounds simple, but it makes for a very interesting variant, to say the least.
Each Great Power starts with the same number and type of units that the
country they are occupying would normally start with; thus, in Shift-Right,
Austria starts in England and has <tt>F Edi</tt>, <tt>F Lon</tt>, and <tt>A Lvp</tt>,
just as England
normally would.  The crucial difference, however, is that <tt>Edi</tt>, <tt>Lon</tt>,
and <tt>Lvp</tt>
are still <em>English</em> home supply centers, <strong>not</strong> Austrian ones.
Austria's home
supply centers are still <tt>Vie</tt>, <tt>Tri</tt>, and <tt>Bud</tt>.
If Austria ever wants to build a unit, he must capture his home SC's.  
<P>
Therein lies the rub.  Each player must migrate from his starting
point to his home SC's, must arrive at those SC's still in possession of
enough in-transit SC's to keep the units he started with, and do so in a
timely manner if he hopes to have any chance of winning the game.  Thus, the
key issues become distance and migratory path to one's home SC's.
<P>
As the <tt>info.shift</tt> file can tell you, the starting positions for Shift-Right
and Shift-Left Diplomacy are as depicted in the table below.

<P>
As the table shows, Shift-Left Diplomacy shifts everyone in the opposite direction
than does Shift-Right (Germany and Turkey still just trade).
<P>
A quick review of the starting board positions suggests that several powers
have particular advantages due to their starting positions.  Here's an
examination of each power's starting position in Shift-Left based on their
possible avenues for getting home.  These are evaluated by distance,
SC availabilty, and the possibility of conflict (this analysis works equally well
for Shift-Right; simply swap the powers):
<P>
<DL>
<DT><strong>Germany</strong>
	(starting in Turkey with <tt>F Ank</tt>, <tt>A Con</tt>, <tt>A Smy</tt>)
    <dd><sl>
	<LI>via Russia - distance: fair, SC's: fair, conflict: low
    <LI>via Balkans/Austria - distance - poor, SC's: good, conflict: high

<P>
<DT><strong>France</strong>
	(starting in Russia with <tt>F Sev</tt>, <tt>A Mos</tt>,
							<tt>A War</tt>, <tt>F Stp/sc</tt>)
    <dd><sl>
	<LI>via Germany - distance: good, SC's: fair, conflict: average
    <LI>via Scandinavia - distance: fair, SC's fair, conflict: low
	</sl>
<P>
<DT><strong>Austria</strong>
	(starting in France with <tt>F Bre</tt>, <tt>A Par</tt>, <tt>A Mar</tt>)
    <DD><sl>
	<LI>via Germany - distance: fair, SC's: fair, conflict: average
    <LI>via Italy - distance: fair, SC's: poor, conflict: low
	</sl>
<P>
<DT><strong>England</strong>
	(starting in Austria with <tt>A Bud</tt>, <tt>A Vie</tt>, <tt>F Tri</tt>)
    <dd><sl>
	<LI>via Germany - distance: poor, SC's: fair, conflict: average
    <LI>via Italy/France - distance: horrible, SC's: fair, conflict: average
    <LI>via Mediterranean/Atlantic - distance: poor, SC's: fair, conflict: low
	</sl>
</dl>

Add to this mix a few special factors:
<ul>
<LI>Any power electing to move by land through Italy is going to be subject to
	the <tt>Pie</tt>/<tt>Ven</tt>/<tt>Tyr</tt> bottleneck and also be forced
	to go off the most direct
	route to their home SC's in order to pick up in-transit Italian SC's.
<P>
<LI>Any power electing to move through the Balkans and Austria is in dire need
	of a traffic cop since at least 4 powers <em>could</em> move through there and one
	power (Austria) <em>must</em> move <strong>to</strong> there.
<P>
<LI>Most of the starting fleets have no chance of getting to their owner's
	home SC's; Germany's <tt>F Ank</tt>, France's <tt>F Sev</tt>, and Turkey's
	<tt>F Kie</tt> are just too far away; Russia's <tt>F Nap</tt> and England's
	<tt>F Tri</tt> face a lot of traffic with little chance of support.  As a
	result, these units are probably only useful to harass the other
	powers or usually end up as early write-offs.
<P>
<LI>On the other hand, England <strong>must</strong> get one of his fleets near
	home if he's ever going to take any home SC's, so he <strong>has</strong> to
	try and find some way to get <tt>F Tri</tt> home.
<P>
<LI>Austria starts out in pretty good shape but is likely to end up in big
	trouble the closer he gets to home; this is one variant where being centrally
	located just doesn't pay.
</ul>

In discussing the likelihood of success for each power, I would rank the powers
in Shift-Left in the following order:
<dl>
<dt><strong>France, Germany, Turkey</strong>
<dd>All have good starting positions and a decent chance to get home
    early without losing units (a slight edge goes to France because
    of the extra starting unit).
<P>
<dt><strong>Italy</strong>
<dd>A good starting position and a quick journey home; Italy's only problems 
    are that he's almost guaranteed to tangle with England on the 
    way and that Austria will probably still be sitting in Venice trying to 
    get into Austria.  On the other hand, once he gets home, Italy will 
    probably still be holding a few English SC's so he will build 
    quickly.
<P>
<dt><strong>Austria</strong>
<dd>Good starting position and a fairly easy path home but, boy oh 
    boy, once he gets there, he's in big trouble.  If Russia hasn't 
    cleared the area yet or if France, Germany, or Turkey decided
    to go through, Austria is going to end up sitting on his own
	doorstep with no way in.
<P>
<dt><strong>Russia</strong>
<dd>Looks good until you realize he's going to have to deal with 
    France, Germany, and Turkey (either in Austria/Balkans or in
    Russia) and meanwhile, Austria's going to be breathing down his 
    neck.
<P>
<dt><strong>England</strong>
<DD>You're kidding, right?  England has virtually no chance in this variant;
    he's got the longest trip home, all of his possible paths put him squarely
    in conflict with another power, and -- to add insult to injury -- he has to be 
    sure that his <strong>single</strong> fleet gets through to his island nation
	or else his home SC's will just sit there belonging to Italy.  (Or he could
	convince other powers to become able and willing to convoy the English armies
	home...fat chance of that!)
</dl>

Regardless of which power you are assigned in a Shift variant game, the key
issue during the opening game is to lose as few units as possible while
getting from the start to your home SC's.  Ideally, you would lose none and pick
up one or two extra along the way, so that you can build quickly once you
take your home SC's.  Assuming you survive the opening game (what? no
England left?), the mid-game and end-game play out pretty much the same
as in standard Diplomacy.
<P>
Ultimately, I don't think the variant is very well balanced.  If you get
England in either Shift-Right or Shift-Left, your work is cut out for you.
On the other hand, if you overlook the distinct disadvantage that England
has (and this could actually be ameliorated somewhat in Shift-Right by giving
England two fleets to start), the variant is quite enjoyable.  In the early
going, you find yourself playing with a sort of "slash and burn" or "loot
and run" mentality.  You know that you have no chance of keeping the SC's
you start with, so you plan strategy to grab new ones even as you plan how,
which, and to whom you will lose your old ones.  I had the sense of being a
medieval mercenary warlord roaming and ravaging the coutryside.  Once you
get to your home SC's, the game takes on a bit of the flavor of the 1898
variant as you rush to occupy all your home SC's and build the units of
your choice faster than your opponents.
<P>
All in all, I highly recommend the variant.  If you'd like to check a game
out, grab a <tt>HISTORY</tt> of game <tt>twist</tt> on

And, if you're interested in playing in a game, drop me a line and I'll
start one (or more) if there's sufficient interest.
