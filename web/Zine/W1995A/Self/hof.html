<H3>The Hall of Fame </H3>
<P>
Last issue I tried to distill whatever useful information there
might be in the judges' registration databases. This issue we'll
take a look at the Diplomacy <A HREF="ftp://ftp.sentex.net/usr/nick/halloffame.gz">Hall of Fame</A>,
which is faithfully maintained by <A HREF="mailto:nfitz@sentex.ca" >Nick Fitzpatrick</A>.
What could be more appropriate for a Winter Adjustment issue than
a summary of the latest Diplomacy results?
<P>
The Hall of Fame maintains a record of the outcome of every game
played on any judge since 1991 (as well as some earlier non-judge
games). I used version 18, which is dated September 1, 1995.
<P>
Of the 635 games which ran to completion (and were eligible for
Hall of Fame points), almost exactly half resulted in a single
power conquering all of Europe. The other half ended in some kind
of draws. There were even two cases of a seven-way draw! Here's
the complete breakdown:
<H3>How Many Winners? </H3>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="winners.gif" HEIGHT="290" WIDTH="513" ALT="Number of Winners">
</CENTER>
<P>
It is interesting to note that two-way draws are much less common
than three-way draws. This is no doubt because of the difficulty
of arriving at an even 17-17 split without somebody getting greedy
and grabbing that 18<SUP>th</SUP> center!
<H3>Who are the Winners? </H3>
<P>
Of course, the question burning in everyone's mind is &quot;which
country wins the most?&quot;
<CENTER><IMG SRC="wins.gif" HEIGHT="290" WIDTH="513" ALT="Number of Wins">
</CENTER>
<P>
The answer is France, but it's a tight race. Poor Italy really
is noticeably less likely to win than the other countries, but
I'll bet you already knew that. Don't take these percentages too
seriously, however. Even with about 45 wins per country, the margin
of error is still plus or minus 1.4 points. We'll have to play a lot
more Diplomacy to know the rankings for sure.
<H3>What About the Draws? </H3>
<P>
Solo wins only account for half of the games, so let's look at
which countries are most likely to be included in a draw:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="draws.gif" HEIGHT="290" WIDTH="513" ALT="Number of Draws">
</CENTER>
<P>
This chart shows that the three corner countries are almost 50%
more likely to be included in a draw than the central countries
(including Russia). Presumably this is because they are harder
to eliminate. It is also interesting that Russia is the second
most likely to win alone, but the second <I>least</I> likely to
be included in a draw. Perhaps this confirms the common feeling
that Russia is a &quot;make or break&quot; country -- you sometimes
roll right over everyone, but if things go sour it can get pretty
ugly. Italy still brings up the rear, but the gap is much smaller
this time. The margin of error here is about 2.3 points.
<H3>Hall of Fame Points </H3>
<P>
So how can we reconcile these two charts? Which country is <I>really</I>
best to play? If your goal is to maximize the number of Hall of
Fame points you will receive, then we should calculate the average
number of Hall of Fame points awarded to each country. This should
appropriately balance the wins and the draws:
<CENTER><IMG SRC="points.gif" HEIGHT="290" WIDTH="513" ALT="Average Hall of Fame Points">
</CENTER>
<P>
France is still on top, but England and Turkey now edge out Russia
and Austria to share second place. For ease of copy and paste,
here is the optimized Hall of Fame preference list:
<P>
<CENTER><B>FETRAGI</B> </CENTER>
<P>
The average game awards 4.9 Hall of Fame points and the average
player receives 0.7 points per game completed. At that rate you
can expect to finish 14 games to just make it onto the bottom
of the Top 100 Players list. To catch <A HREF="mailto:shoham@hnc.com">Dan Shoham</A>
at the top of the list you can expect to play about 133 games!
<H3>Which Alliances Win?</H3>
Let's turn now to look at which coallitions most often divide Europe.  The seven
most frequently victorious alliances are tabulated here:

<TD ALIGN="RIGHT">8</TD>

</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>
Note that Austria and Italy do not occur in <I>any</I> of these, and these top seven
represent 25% of all draws!
Since there are too many possible combinations of allies to make an easy picture,
let's just concentrate on the pairwise combinations.  The small
charts below show the number of games in which each country shared in a draw with
each other country.  The chart is symmetrical, since a two-way EF draw shows up in
both England and France's charts.  A three-way EFT draw is counted six times, twice
in each of England, France and Turkey's charts.
<CENTER><IMG SRC="allies.gif" HEIGHT="239" WIDTH="513" ALT="Alliances">
</CENTER>
<P>
The three combinations EF, ET and FT stand way up above the rest.  Note also that
France is the most likely ally of <I>every</I> country except for Turkey, where France
is a close second to England.
To simplify this even further I have created an &quot;alliance map&quot;,
in which I have drawn an
arrow from each country to its two most likely allies.  The thickness of the arrow
(crudely) indicates the likelihood of the alliance.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="map.gif" HEIGHT="197" WIDTH="259" ALT="Alliances">
</CENTER>
<P>
Note that these are not necessarily the best or most likely alliances to form at the
beginning or middle of a game.  They are simply the ones mostly likely to finish the game.
<H3>How Long to Win? </H3>
<P>
I recently saw a reprint of an article by <A HREF="mailto:amt5man@amsta.leeds.ac.uk">Mark Nelson</A>
(originally published in <I>Electronic Protocol</I>) where he
analyzed the games played in <I>EP</I> to find the average length
of time it takes each country to win. Here are the updated results
using the latest Hall of Fame data.
<P>
The top chart shows the number of games which were won in each year.
The earliest wins are in 1905, and the latest in 1938
(just in time to start WWII!).  The lower charts break out the data
for each winning country. The red arrows indicate the average winning
time for each country.
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="try2.gif" HEIGHT="485" WIDTH="513" ALT="Winning Times">
</CENTER>
<P>
It is immediately apparent that Russia wins sooner than the
other countries. Fully half of all wins in 1905, 1906 and 1907 are
Russian.
<P>
The average winning times are all virtually identical for all countries
(1911.7), except Austria
which tends to win one year earlier (1910.7), and Russia which tends
to win two years earlier (1909.5).  In computing these averages, I
excluded games ending after 1925 (2% of the data) since these outliers
perturb the results strongly, and there are too few of them to draw
useful conclusions about long-running games.
<P>
Well, that's all for this issue.
(Here's the <A HREF="tables.html">raw data</A> from which most of the
charts were derived.)
I'm pretty much fresh out of
databases to analyze, so if you have some interesting information
lying around but haven't had time to scrutinize it, send it my
way....
