I make mistakes.  Always have.  Always will.  I've heard there are others
with that problem.  In Diplomacy, making mistakes can be fatal.  Both when
you are submitting your orders, and when you are talking to the other
players in the game.  This article is about one particular type of the
last kind of error.<p>

Like most of this world's population, I do not have English as my native 
language.  One consequence of that is that my command of English cannot 
compete with that minority who <i>do</i> have English as their native 
language.   Clearly, that will put me at a disadvantage in circumstances
where English is the language used.  For instance, in almost all games of
Diplomacy played via e-mail, or at larger conventions.<p>

People whose native language is something other than English (from
now on called foreigners, with no slight intended) can be divided
into two groups.  Those whose command of the language is obviously
inferior, and those who speak the language well enough that others
don't think their English is inferior.  Which group has the bigger
problem very much depends on the opponent and on their own awareness
of their problem.<p>

How does the average native English-speaker respond to someone who
doesn't understand (or doesn't correctly <em>mis</em>understand)
anything said to them, and to top
that, is unable to present even the most simple concept in a marginally
coherent way? One, unfortunately very common, reaction is to assume that
the person is stupid.  People are accustomed to defining <b>native</b>
English speakers who misspell every second word and who make simple
grammatical errors as "stupid," and -- consciously or unconsciously --
these people assume that the same
applies to foreigners.  Usually it doesn't, but by the time they
find that out, it is too late.  The "stupid" foreigner will be
wiped off the board, since nobody wants to have an "unpredictable
idiot" as a neighbour for very long.  Occasionally, the foreigner in
question will find less prejudiced people nearby on the map, or other 
foreigners for that matter, but usually, he'll be dead.  And, incidentally,
out of the hobby, or playing no-press only, since his success no longer
depends on his skill as a player, but on his skill at English.  And the
latter takes much longer to build up to a sufficient level than does
skill at Diplomacy.  Believe it or not.<p>

However, given patience, any person will improve their skill at English to
a level where it is no longer obviously inferior to the native speaker.
You would think he would then have solved all his problems, right? Probably, yes,
but he will have gained a whole new set of problems in the process.  He no
longer suffers purely xenophobic problems; instead he suffers from problems 
with thoughtlessness.  There will be words or expressions he doesn't 
understand.  Not too much of a problem, since he can always ask people to
clarify, and usually they will.  Only once have I been attacked in a
game of Diplomacy for asking someone to clarify something I did not
understand, and that person later on told me he thought I was 
<i>pretending</i> ignorance.  What <b>is</b> a problem, and a much more common
problem than <em>not</em> understanding, is <em>mis</em>understanding.  The tendency,
especially among the many Americans who have hardly met anyone
who isn't American, and who have definitely not talked to such a person, is
to assume that anyone who anyone whose English is good will have
a command of the language on par with their own.  This is, if not
impossible, then at least very very difficult to achieve.  In general, I
do not encounter American or British slang in my daily life, and so  I
won't understand it, or else will take it at face value.  Literary allusions 
will be lost on me, since my literary upbringing will have been in 
my native language.  They do not show the same TV shows here, and 
many Europeans will be used to seeing English movies in a dubbed 
version.  When talking to a foreigner, expect him to take anything 
you say at face value.  To drive the point home, and make sure you 
never forget it, take a look at what you've written to people over 
the years, and consider what happens if they take everything at 
face value.  Maybe now you understood that otherwise unmotivated 
stab which someone performed on you, just after you made that combined 
allusion to "Hamlet," "Huck Finn," and "The Hitchhikers Guide to 
the Galaxy.'<p>

I'll close off with a word of warning.  Don't take this text at
face value.  Much of what is written is based upon the culture I 
come from, that of northwestern Europe.  It is very different 
from that of southern Europe, of eastern Europe, and, surprisingly 
to many, that of North America.  And when you comment upon it,
then remember that though I don't easily get offended, my upbringing
and cultural background ensures that I may get offended at what you
might consider just a funny little remark.  And you don't need to
talk to me in words of no more than two syllables, or sentences
with a maximum of one comma.  I can handle up to four, on both 
counts.
