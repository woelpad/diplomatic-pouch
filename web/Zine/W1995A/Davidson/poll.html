<H1>The Great Diplomacy Poll</H1>
<H2><i>Paul Davidson</i></H2>
</center>
<P>
No great 'zine is complete without statistics.  In a recent poll on the
<a href="news:rec.games.diplomacy"><tt>rec.games.diplomacy</tt></a> newsgroup,
I asked people to send me their preferences and
opinions regarding different facets of Diplomacy.  Let's take a look at the
results, and see how <I>you</I> measure up to the average player of
Diplomacy!
<P>
<H2>Favorite/Least Favorite Countries</H2>
First of all, I asked people not only what their favorite countries were,
but also their least favorite.  While processing the results, I used a system
whereby each person's favorite country got three points; second or third
favorites, when mentioned, received two and one points, respectively.  I
added up the totals for each country, calculated the percentages, and these
were the results:
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<caption><b>What Are Your Favorite and Least Favorite Powers?
</b></caption>
<tr><th colspan=2>Favorite Power<th><th colspan=2>Least Favorite Power</tr>
<tr><td align=center>France<td align=center>24%<td><td align=center>Austria<td align=center>30%</tr>
<tr><td align=center>Austria<td align=center>18%<td><td align=center>Italy<td align=center>24%</tr>
<tr><td align=center>Turkey<td align=center>15%<td><td align=center>Turkey<td align=center>21%</tr>
<tr><td align=center>England<td align=center>14%<td><td align=center>Germany<td align=center>15%</tr>
<tr><td align=center>Italy<td align=center>12%<td><td align=center>Russia<td align=center>6%</tr>
<tr><td align=center>Russia<td align=center>12%<td><td align=center>England<td align=center>4%</tr>
<tr><td align=center>Germany<td align=center>5%<td><td align=center>France<td align=center>0%</tr>
</table>
</center>
<P>
One of the most interesting things I noticed when I first
examined the results is that Austria is very high on both lists, being both
second favorite and least favorite!  It seems that people either like
Austria, or they hate it.  Russia is quite the opposite, being near the
bottom of both lists.  People neither strongly like it nor strongly dislike
it.  Italy was slightly more popular than I thought it would be, since many
consider it to be the weakest country on the board.  As for the most
popular, France is the clear winner.  In fact, not even a single person
that France was their least favorite country.
<P>
There was also a small number of people who said they had no country
preference.
<P>
At any rate, it would seem that personal style has a great deal to do with
which country a particular person likes to play.  After averaging out all
results, a preference list from most to least favorite would be:
<center><B>
France, England, Turkey, Russia, Germany, Italy, Austria.
</B></center>
The astute reader will note that this list is remarkably similar to the
ordering based on Hall of Fame point awards which is presented in Matthew
Self's <a href="/Zine/W1995A/Self/hof.html">"Lies, Damn Lies, and Diplomacy"</a>
article in this issue of the Zine.  Only Austria is misplaced; it seems
the dual monarchy is less well-liked than its success record would dictate.
<P>
<H2>Role-Playing</H2>
The next question was, "Do you role-play?"  The answers which I got are
shown below.
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<caption><b>Do You Role-Play?</b></caption>
<tr><th>Yes<th>Sometimes<th>No</tr>
<tr><td align=center>36%<td align=center>46%<td align=center>18%</tr>
</table>
</center>
<P>
The "sometimes" category is quite broad, ranging from
"almost always" to "rarely."  Most of the people in this category stated
that it depended on the other players in the game.  At any rate, those who
do role-play outnumber those who don't by a fair margin.
<P>
<H2>Press Preference</H2>
White/grey partial press was by far the most popular
overall press setting.  The complete statistics are given in the table
which follows.
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<caption><b>Which Press Settings Do You Prefer?</b></caption>
<tr><th>White Press<td align=center>58%
<th>Grey Press<td align=center>36%
<th>Fake Press<td align=center>6%</tr>
<tr><th>Partial Press<td align=center>79%
<th>Broadcast Only<td align=center>4%
<th>No Press<td align=center>17%</tr>
</table>
</center>
<P>
<H2>Variants</H2>
Not enough people had a favorite
non-standard variant to provide reliable statistics, but Fleet_Rome was the
most popular.  Youngstown was also quite popular, followed by Chaos,
Aberration, and Crowded.  Personally, I think there are some great variants
out there, and I'd encourage more of you to try them.
<P>
<H2>Gunboat</H2>
When asked if people preferred gunboat (anonymous) games or "normal",
54% preferred gunboat, 32% preferred normal, and 14% had no preference.
<P>
<H2>Games</H2>
I also asked people how many games each person like to be
involved with at once.  While this varied greatly from person to person,
the average turned out to be 3.5 games.
<P>
Many people indicated that a
number of their games were merely mercy positions that they had taken over.
I decided not include these in my calculations.  In one instance, a player
told me that he had been in as many as 40 games at a time, when mercy
positions, takeovers, etc. were included.  This would obviously have thrown
my figures off.
<P>
<H2>Judge Pet Peeves</H2>
Most respondents did not
really have a pet peeve.  Those who did usually mentioned abandonments and
judge crashes, which aren't really the judge's fault.  One complaint,
however, which came up several times, was that players aren't sent
reminders before the deadline arrives.
<P>
<H2>Favorite Alliances</H2>
Unfortunately, there are so many 2 and 3-way alliances possible, that I was
unable to put the results into any proper statistical format.
Russia-Turkey tended to be a popular alliance for both powers.  Most people
chose England and France as good allies.  Everyone had different ideas for
Germany, Austria, and Italy, although the Austria-Italy alliance was quite
popular.  This kind of thing depends on your style of play and the
situation at hand.
<P>
<H2>Stabbing</H2>
While sorting through all the
various stabbing opinions and philosophies, I divided people into 4 groups:
those who stab only for a win, those who will also stab for a kill or large
advantage, those who stab for any advantage, and those who will do it for
no reason at all.  Although these categories are somewhat vague, here's how
it turned out:
<P>
<center>
<table cellpadding=5 border=2>
<caption><b>When Do You Stab?</b></caption>
<tr><th>Only For A Win<td align=center>18%</tr>
<tr><th>For A Large Advantage Or A Kill<td align=center>39%</tr>
<tr><th>For Any Advantage<td align=center>37%</tr>
<tr><th>For No Reason<td align=center>5%</tr>
</table>
</center>
<P>
One stabbing philosophy which deserves mention is that of Jim Burgess:
<blockquote><i>
"Stabbing is part of the contract of the game.  When you sign up for
the game (unless you have a CareBear contract in which [agreeing with Dan
Shoham -- shocker] only stabbing for the win is permissible) part of the
implicit contract is that stabbing is permitted by the rules.  Diplomacy
players who have ethical standards strive for a strength of character
whereby they will admit their stabs freely within the context of the game
and any "bad feeling" will stay within the context of the game.  Stabbing
and being stabbed is fun, in my (humble) opinion."
</i></blockquote>
<P>
Well said!
<P>
<H2>Cool/Unusual Stuff</H2>
A number of people related interesting
stories of cool stuff they had done.  There were a number of impressive
convoys, as well as other interesting stories.  Andy Schwarz wrote:
<blockquote><i>
"I won, outright, the very first Judge game I signed on to, <tt>Empress</tt>,
on USEF.  In it I stabbed England and France twice, once on the same move, and
managed to race to a win by 1906 or 1907.  I am very proud of this."
</i></blockquote>
<P>
I would be too.  Here's an interesting tactic for gaining allies, sent to me
by G. Broster:
<blockquote><i>
"As Russia, I once came into the game at about 1905 and
attacked Germany, England, Austria, and Turkey in my first turn. The next turn
I had 4 offers of alliances sent to me."
</i></blockquote>
<P>
<H2>Dumb Mistakes</H2>
One common mistake is that of submitting incorrect orders to the judge (as I
have done on occasion).  Andy Schwarz gives an example of what he once did:
<blockquote><i>
"In a nopress game as Italy, in Fall 1901, I order <tt>F Ion-Nap</tt> instead
of <tt>F Ion-Tun</tt>!  Then someone posted to
<a href="news:rec.games.diplomacy"><tt>rec.games.diplomacy</tt></a> that in
one of his games, some lamebrain had ordered <tt>F Ion-Nap</tt>!"
</blockquote></i>
<P> Andy has this bit of wisdom to add:
<blockquote><i>
"I was in too many games at once. I used MacDip to click in my moves
and I somehow misclicked it.  I copied and pasted without checking the
Judge reply, and I learned my lesson the hard way: <b>always</b> verify
when the Judge accepts your moves."
</blockquote></i>
Another mistake many respondants had made
was forgetting to occupy an SC through to the fall, or forgetting to occupy
it altogether.  Rick Jenkins writes:
<blockquote><i>
"I forgot to recapture a SC that
was mine to begin with, lost to another power and then vacated, ready  for
me to walk into.  I had to remove a unit and that cost me the game."
</blockquote></i>
<P>
Other common mistakes were trusting the wrong person too much and sending
press to the wrong power.  It seems even the best Diplomacy players have
made and still make these mistakes.  It's comforting, in a way.
<P>
<H2>Player to Beat</H2>
Well, as you might guess, Dan Shoham is the man
to beat.  Jamie Dreier and Conrad Minshall were also mentioned by a lot of
people.  The only other player whose name came up a couple of times is Joel
Furr.  It seems a lot of people would like to beat him.  As one person put
it, "I would like to beat Joel Furr... Oh, you mean in a game."
<P>
This person wisely chose to remain anonymous. ;-)
<P> I know that deep down, we all appreciate Joel.
