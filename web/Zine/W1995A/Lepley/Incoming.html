Further Reflections from a Diplomacy Newbie

<p>
	For a moment there, game number three looked like another draw.  Our 
alliance had just turned the corner on the opposition.  France (in England) was 
doomed, Turkey was one turn away from elimination, Germany was folding in the 
center, and France could make no more significant gains in the Meditteranean.
A few more months and it would all be over.
<p>
	Suddenly, disaster struck our alliance.  The original Italy quit 
playing Diplomacy. We had a new player on the scene.  The new Italy and I 
(Russia) soon had a falling out.  Things got abusive and personal.  I got hot 
and stabbed. I believed that the new Italy would not include me in a draw and I 
didn't think I could take him out later in the game.  There was also the 
personal element to the conflict -- "Better get him now before his hands are on 
my throat and there's nothing I can do."  At least, that was my thinking at 
the moment of the stab.  It was an emotional decision.
<p>
	The blame in this breakup is shared. Our alliance didn't fall apart 
because we weren't coordinated, or because our moves were bad, or even because 
we didn't have good board position.  No sweet talking enemy lured an ally away. 
This was a clear cut case of poor (little-d) diplomacy.  It was a winning
alliance that self-destructed.
<p>
	I had believed that the only danger in a replacement player was that the 
new guy might go to the other side.  A personal squabble that leads to a stab 
was not something I considered.  Well, now that it happened to me, I understand 
it.  
<p>
	The stab itself went okay. Italy was down by three SC's after the first 
year of the stab.  I got none of them, but I had helped two of them disappear by 
passing along information.  The next turn should see the loss of one to three 
more. I should be up two SC's in two years thanks to former allies and I would
be larger than my former big brother, Italy.
<p>
	Lessons learned?  One lesson must be that I can be as big a problem to 
an alliance as a new player.  Next time go slower, feel the guy out, get a sense 
of what kind of a person he is.  Try to see the problems coming and defuse them 
in advance.
<p>
	The reaction of the other players was revealing.  There were several 
emotional outbursts centering around that stab.  It is clear that regardless of 
the age of our little Diplomacy group, most of us become emotionally involved in 
our game.  Even though it is Diplomacy and lies are legal, trust can be built 
and cruelly broken.  Disappointment brought out some strong, emotionally charged 
press in this game.
<p>
	I think the greatest thing I've learned over the last few months of 
Diplomacy has to do with human nature. We say it is "only a game" but it is 
clearly more than that.  It is the planning, plotting, socializing, and dreaming 
of seven individuals over a period of months or even a year.  When the dreaded 
stab occurs, dreams go down in flames and the emotions flare up.  It is a human 
reaction and will always be a part of this game.  Perhaps an emotional outburst 
when things fall apart is more of a normal, healthy thing rather than a sign of 
a player who is overly involved.
<p>
	There may be some "iron men" of Diplomacy to whom all this is nothing 
more than the movement of little pieces on a chess board.  Those to whom the 
manipulation of the game and its players causes no great emotional response. 
The kind of guy that put it all into mathematical percentages and only spends a 
few minutes on any turn. I say most of us aren't put together that way.  When 
five months of labor, hours of press, and even more hours of planning and 
thinking go down the drain, most of us "mere mortals" have an emotional 
reaction.  
<p>
	Saying "it is only a game" doesn't really help because we know (deep 
down) we are trying to delude ourselves.  Perhaps we should acknowledge the 
disappointment and tell ourselves to meet defeat and deception with all the 
grace and maturity that we can muster.  I admire the players I have met who have 
shown such grace.  That is something worth striving for.  It's called 
"character."  All in all, though, it would be easier on everyone if the game
were over in a few hours some evening, instead of taking 6 months on the
Internet.
