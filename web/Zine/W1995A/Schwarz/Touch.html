<H3>Introduction</H3>
Adjacency Diplomacy, or, less formally, Touch Dip, really began as a
mental exercise to devise rules which minimized the impact of my various
Diplomacy weaknesses.  My main weakness is a difficulty communicating
to players every season, especially in games with short deadlines.
During a hectic real-time partial-press game, I realized I was barely
communicating with anyone but my immediate neighbors and because of the
short deadlines (25 minutes) and the pressures of using the judge in
real time, I doubted anyone else was either.  Though this constraint was
imposed from outside the game, it seemed like it would be a fairly
interesting variant even without the time pressure that made it a
necessity.  Thus was born Touch Diplomacy.
<P>
The rules are fairly straightforward.  The map and all movement is as
per standard Diplomacy.  Press, however, is severely restricted. Players
are allowed a single 250-word (later upped to 500, though I think 100
might suffice) public broadcast per season.  This broadcast, however,
has to be submitted to the GM prior to the adjudication, much like press
which is published in traditional (snail mail) postal games.  Players
with units in adjacent provinces, however, may also send partial press,
which means that powers on opposite sides of the board, say Turkey and
England, may go for long stretches of the game without being able to
communicate privately.
<P>
<H3>How Adjacency Press Works</H3>
Of course, it is not exactly clear what adjacency means in Diplomacy. Is
a fleet in Trieste adjacent to an army in Serbia?  It cannot move to
Serbia, and it cannot support a unit in or into Serbia, but  can it
communicate with the unit in Serbia?  In the first playtest of the game
(cleverly entitled, "Touch" and run on Larry Richardson's Northern
Virginia Judge [USVA:
<a href="mailto:judge@intertv.com">judge@intertv.com</a>]), adjacency was
defined by the same rules by which
legal support is determined; that is, if a unit could provide legal support
to a unit holding in a given space, it was determined to be adjacent to
that unit.  Furthermore, if unit <i>A</i> was adjacent to unit <i>B</i>,
unit <i>B</i> was ruled adjacent to unit <i>A</i> regardless of its ability
to support unit <i>A</i>. In
the example above, the army in Serbia is clearly adjacent to the fleet
in Trieste, since it could support that fleet, and thus Trieste is ruled
adjacent to Serbia (even though it could not support into Serbia).
Similarly, an army in Trieste and a fleet in the Adriatic would be
considered adjacent even though that army has no hope of supporting the
Adriatic fleet.  Note, however, that a fleet in Rome and a fleet in
Venice are still not adjacent by this liberal ruling, since neither can
support the other.
<P>
In the second playtest, equally cleverly entitled touch2 (apologies to
the anti-sequel crowd, but no one seemed to confuse the games since they
were not run concurrently), the liberal second adjacency clause was
removed, so that one-way communication was enabled.  An power with an
inland army (like Serbia) could talk to neighboring powers with
coastal fleets, but the power with the fleets could not send partial
press back and had to use the 500-word broadcast for replies. Similarly,
fleets at sea could talk to coastal armies, but the armies could not
reply directly.
<P>
One final form of written communication was allowed.  If two powers with
no adjacent units attempted to enter the same space and neither
succeeded <tt>(*bounce*)</tt>, they were allowed a 30-word "communique"
for each set of bounces.  For example, in Spring 1901 if France orders
<TT>A Par-Bur</tt> and Germany orders <tt>A Mun-Bur</tt>, they would end
the turn without an adjacency.  Because of the bounce, however, each power
was allowed 30 words of partial press.  In <tt>touch</tt>, I required
<B>both</b> powers
to send the communique or neither would receive it (I made them send the
press to me and I redistributed it).  This was more hassle than it was
worth and in
<tt>touch2</tt>, I merely monitored the communiques to ensure they stayed under
the word limit.  These communiques proved extremely rare, and I would
consider dropping this rule from future games.
<P>
<H3>Envisioned Game Changes</H3>
When I developed these rules, it was my assumption that the interior
powers, Austria, Germany, and Italy, would benefit from their position
and the resulting multilateral communication.  As an extreme example,
before the Spring 1901 moves, the only powers allowed to send partial
press to each under Touch rules are Italy and Austria.  Once again, this
feature coincided with a personal weakness; I still haven't survived as
Italy in a standard game, and it was my hope that the enhanced early
communications might overcome what I've seen as an imbalance in the
game, or at least in my game.
<P>
After this first advantage for AI, it still seemed that central location
would aid communication in the midgame.  Again, a personal weakness:
managing a middle country faced with alliance between a successful
western power (England or France) and a successful eastern one (Russia or
Turkey) who have teamed up to eliminate the center and share a two-way
or slug it out for the win.  Since Touch rules might prohibit direct
communication between a successful England about to enter the Mediterranean
and a successful Turkey about to break past the Ionian, the middle
powers would have another advantage.  Or so I hoped.
<P>
Another weakness, another theory:  I assumed that once a power reached a
certain hegemonous critical mass, maybe 14-16 centers, it would be
difficult for the scattered small fry to stop the leviathan unless they
were all mutually adjacent, since the coordination would be hampered by
the need to daisy-chain all press.  This is something I've seen in
NoPress games; stop the leader is much harder in the end-game.  As a few
of our readers can attest, I'm pretty good at reaching 16 centers, but
getting to 18 has always baffled me.
<P>
As so many great variant designers before me have discovered, things
don't always work out the way they're planned.  The two games run under
Touch rules, <tt>touch</tt> and <tt>touch2</tt>, could not have had more
varied results,
and very few, if any, of my assumptions about the impact of the press
rules were born out.
<P>
<H3>How the Theory Panned Out</H3>
<tt>Touch</tt> was a rapid victory for an edge power, Russia, played by Timothy
Moore (<a href="mailto:TimothyMMV@aol.com">TimothyMMV@aol.com</a>).
In the early phases of the game, the German
player (Mark Hanneman, no current e-mail address) broke out to an early
lead and the almost inevitable stop the leader alliance formed in the
west.  Mark did his best to strengthen the coalition against him by
using his central position to lie a little too often to most of the
powers on the board.  As press was passed from power to power [a
consistent phenomenon I had not anticipated], Mark's deceptions became
clear and his duplicity united Europe against him.  As Germany was
whittled down, Russia became the clear leader, but when it was obvious
that the only way to stop Russia was to work with the treacherous
German, the other powers chose to accept Russian domination.  Austria
was about the only power with a chance of matching Russia in a slugfest,
but the Austrian player,  Bruce Regittko
(<a href="mailto:bjregitt@wtcc-gw.wake.tec.nc.us">bjregitt@wtcc-gw.wake.tec.nc.us</a>)
chose to stab Italy on the very turn
he was stabbed by Russia, leaving him without allies and with his units
facing away from the real enemy.  Austria accepted Russia's terms of
surrender and chose not to defend his home supply centers, letting
Russia complete the solo win in 1905.
<P>
<tt>Touch2</tt> started off with a strong FG alliance which quickly reduced
England to a few armies in Scandinavia and was already pressing into the
Mediterranean and toward Warsaw while AIRT squabbled in the east.
Italy, played masterfully by Alexander K. "Smiley" Woo
(<a href="mailto:Alexander.K.Woo@williams.edu">Alexander.K.Woo@williams.edu</a>),
saw he had no hope of surviving if
France and Germany stayed allied, and he issued an ultimatum to Austria,
Russia, and Turkey, demanding an eastern alliance and threatening to
throw the game to France if he was not heeded.  In <tt>touch2</tt>, as in the
previous game, players were quite willing to forward partial press
verbatim to those powers not adjacent to the author, so my theory of
disjointed coordination against a hegemon was thoroughly discredited.
Though Turkey, played by Charles Severance
(<a href="mailto:cseveran@gmu.edu">cseveran@gmu.edu</a>) took a few
turns to be convinced that Smiley was not trying to lure him to his death,
eventually the eastern AIRT alliance gelled and France (who had by this
time stabbed Germany) was stopped just short of the victory.
<P>
<H3>Touching The Future</H3>
We didn't start up <tt>touch3</tt> for a variety of reasons.  GameMastering
Touch Dip is more difficult than is Mastering a standard game.  The GM has
to be vigilant for adjacencies, which change from turn to turn.  If the
judge were coded up for this, the task of the GM would be much easier.
Furthermore, the GM has to be alert and remember to broadcast all of the
press he's received after each turn adjudicates.  In Touch, I actually
misplaced Russia's opening verbal salvo against Austria, and the delay
of a day before I found it and broadcast it was enough for the two to
begin negotiations.  Even though I broadcast the press well before the
Fall moves, the gap allowed Russia to explain it away as bravado, and
had Austria seen Russia's words before direct talks began, he might not
have chosen the Austro-Russian alliance.  I had not even intended on
GMing <tt>touch2</tt>, but when the GM from <tt>touch2</tt> lost Internet
access, I
stepped in to finish things off.  At the end of the second session I was
pretty burned out, and I'd advise anyone toying with playing by these
rules to simplify things (like allowing regular hundred word broadcasts
rather than snail-mail style press) before leaping in to the job.
<P>
However, even had I been willing (and had the time) to GM a third
round, I'm not sure the players were all that interested.  As I write
this article, many of the judges are down, and I think I could start a
game allowing only one syllable words starting with X, and I could get 7
players in a day or two, but at the time, there was not a huge amount of
interest in starting a <tt>touch3</tt>.  Nonetheless, if this article has
stimulated interest, I encourage someone to give GM'ing a whirl.  I'd be
happy to send you the rules for both <tt>touch</tt> and <tt>touch2</tt>
and let you devise a synthesis that suits your tastes.

<H3>The View From The Trenches</H3>
What you have above is how I saw it.  Scanning through the reams of broadcasts
and various EOG statements, I thought two were particularly well written
explanations of what happened from the players perspective, and these are
presented below.  For <tt>touch</tt>, I've chosen
the losing Austrian's point of view, and for <tt>touch2</tt>, the galvanizing
Italian's version of how the anti-French coalition was formed. Perhaps I
like their perspective best because they were the central powers who,
even if they did not storm to victory, at least talk to the greatest number
of powers and thus had a great view as others outpaced them, though of
course, in Smiley's case, he was able to keep Austria and Italy in the draw.
