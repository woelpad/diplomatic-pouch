<H2>Austria's End Of Game Statement In Game "Touch"</H2>
</center>

 Well, let me be the first to offer congratulations to Russia.  I really  
enjoyed this game (although a victory would have been nice) and would 
definitely play in another adjacency game. 
<P>
 In the beginning, Italy and I decided on a mutual non-aggression pact 
with him going west and myself going east.  Italy really wanted me to go 
after Turkey while I really preferred to attack Russia.  After the 
opening moves I was still undecided despite the fact that Russia's 
opening was  rather anti-Austrian.  Two things led me to ally with the 
Bear.  The first was the press that I received from Turkey told me that 
if I didn't  ally with him I would be eliminated in short order.  When I 
suggested that due to the no-press status between our two countries that 
there was  still room for negotiation, Turkey reiterated his assertion 
that I would not survive without his help.  I didn't like his strong-arm 
approach to  negotiating and was worried that I would become a puppet of 
his if things went wrong. 
<P>
 The other thing that tipped the scales was that Russia's initial  
broadcast press was delayed.  Had I read that inflammatory message 
before  making a deal with him, the deal would not have been made. 
<P>
 After my Fall 1901 "stab" of Turkey I was kind of happy to be out of  
touch with him as I know he was not pleased.  His vow to throw his dots 
to Russia was blunted by Russia's initial willingness to share them. 
<P>
 The real credit for Russia's victory should go to Germany.  After he 
moved into Tyrolia in Fall 1902, he started telling me that he wanted to  
attack Italy and, according to Italy, that he wanted to attack me.  We 
were passing this info. along to Russia who decided to attack Germany 
the  following Spring.  Instead of moving against Italy (and me) he 
should have guarded his eastern boarder.  (Isn't hindsight wonderful?) 
<P>
My biggest blunder in the game was not attacking Italy in Fall 1903.  
Turkey was almost dead and I could have established myself in Italy and  
kept pace with Russia's northern conquest.  The extra units  would have 
allowed me to be able to watch my weak eastern  flank, also.  
Unfortunately for me, I decided to honor my agreement with Vittorio 
until it was too late.  
<P>
Had our positions been reversed, I [as Russia] also would have stabbed 
Austria despite assurances of holding out for a 2-way draw.  Coupled 
with  Germany's full scale retreat and my delay in westward growth, 
Russia would have had to stop dead in his tracks for a few years to 
allow me to catch up. After the Russian stab, I decided not to fight 
back since the final  result would have been the same anyway with 
Germany was playing  Kingmaker. 
<P>
 France & Turkey, I hope that you didn't take my ribbing too personally.  
You were both in difficult positions and did the best you could.  
Turkey, I would have liked to have seen some broadcast press from you 
even though  there was no strategic or tactical advantage to be gained. 
England, thanks for taking over the position and keeping the game alive. 
<P>
Also, did any bounce press get exchanged?  I know that my 25 words  to 
Turkey were never reciprocated so I gave up after two tries.  All in  
all, I liked the format although there were times when I really wanted 
to  know what England or Germany were thinking and we were not adjacent. 
<P>
 Well, I'm off to get the <a href="touchSUM.html">summary</a> and see who all of you really are. 
<P>
