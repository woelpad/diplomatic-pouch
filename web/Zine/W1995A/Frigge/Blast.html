<H1 align=center>Turkish Opening Moves -- A Catalog</H1>
<H2><i>Michael L. Frigge</i></H2>

   The author does not mention this more general problem in his introduction.
I would strongly recommend that he enlarge the introduction, outlining the more
general setting.
<P>
In calculating the number of positions, support orders are generally not
    important (so the number of Autumn 1901 positions can be calculated by
    considering adjacent provinces).  They are important when calculating the
    number of distinct openings which can lead to the positions.  The author
    states that he will ignore unneeded supports and this is not unreasonable.
<P>
    However, the author does not include the possibility of self-standoffs,
    except when the units are also involved in standing off a unit of a 
    different nationality.  The set <tt>A Con-Bul, A Smy-Arm</tt>
	and <tt>F Ank-Arm</tt>
    is considered a valid order but <tt>A Con-Bul, A Smy-Con</tt> and
	<tt>F Ank-Con</tt> is not valid.
<P>
    I believe that some readers may object to this distinction.  Certainly
    the author can not claim to calculate "the total number of Turkish
    Openings in Spring 1901," only a <i>reasonable</i> subset of them.  At the
    moment, the introduction is slightly misleading.  The author does not 
    attempt to "explore in detail the possible Spring 1901 openings for 
    Turkey"; only the <i>reasonable</i> openings.  The introduction needs to be
    expanded to clear-up this point.  I believe that the reason why 
    self-standoffs are ignored (unless there is the possibility of a foreign
    unit entering the space) should be moved from the `Opening Moves' Section
    to the Introduction.
<P>
    In the more general position, it is clearly reasonable to ignore `vanity'
    self-standoffs.
<P>
Along similar lines to my second point the author's comment in the 
    conclusion about "exact number of opening moves and end positions" needs
    to be clarified.  His method calculated the exact number of end positions,
    but not the exact number of moves which lead to those positions; only the
    subset of <i>reasonable</i> ones.
<P>
    The "How Many Openings Are There" article should be referenced and the
	difference between 
    their approach and his outlined.
<P>
Tables 4 (listing the 40 possible end positions) and 5
    (enumerating the 40 possible end positions) contain the same information.
    One of them is redundant.
<P>
The article is split into four sections: End Positions, Opening
    Moves, Some Observations and Conclusions.  These should be numbered.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

<H3>Introduction</H3>

Since, in standard Diplomacy, Turkey is the most restricted 
in its set of opening moves, I set for myself the task of 
exploring in detail the reasonable Spring 1901 openings for 
Turkey.  

<H3>End Positions</H3>

As a baseline, construct an upper bound for the number of 
possible positions of the Turkish units at the end of the 
phase.  To do this, simply list the starting position of
each Turkish unit; and then, for each unit, the possible end 
positions.
<center>
<table border>
<caption><b>Table 1.  Possible End Positions</td></caption>
<tr><th>Starting Position<th>Ending Position</tr>
<tr><td><tt>A Con</tt><td><tt>Ank Bul Con Smy</tt></tr>
<tr><td><tt>A Smy</tt><td><tt>Ank Arm Con Smy Syr</tt></tr>
<tr><td><tt>F Ank</tt><td><tt>Ank Arm Bla Con</tt><tr>
</table>
</center>

Since there are four end places for <tt>A Con</tt>, five end places for 
<tt>A Smy</tt> and four end places for <tt>F Ank</tt>, then a starting upper
bound is 4 times 5 times 4, which is 80 [formally, (4 Choose 1) 
times (5 Choose 1) times (4 Choose 1)].  
<P>
Clearly, this number is too high as it allows more than one 
unit to occupy the same space at the end of the phase.  
Simply counting arguments does not help much in establishing the
effects of this constraint.  A modest programming effort, or
even a simple enumeration and thought, will allow these and
subsequent reductions.  This constraint reduces the number 
of possible end positions from 80 to 50 possibilities as 
follows:
<center>
<table border>
<caption><b>Table 2.
<tr><th>A Con<th>A Smy<th>F Ank</tr>
<tr><td>Ank<td>Arm<td>Bla Con</tr>
<tr><td><td>Con<td>Arm Bla</tr>
<tr><td><td>Smy<td>Arm Bla Con</tr>
<tr><td><td>Syr<td>Arm Bla Con</tr>
<tr><td>Bul<td>Ank<td>Arm Bla Con</tr>
<tr><td><td>Arm<td>Arm Bla Con</tr>
<tr><td><td>Con<td>Ank Arm Bla</tr>

<tr><td><td>Syr<td>Ank Arm Bla</tr>
<tr><td>Smy<td>Ank<td>Arm Bla Con</tr>
<tr><td><td>Arm<td>Arm Bla Con</tr>
<tr><td><td>Con<td>Ank Arm Bla</tr>
<tr><td><td>Syr<td>Ank Arm Bla Con</tr>
</table></center>
There are still too many end positions listed.  Diplomacy
rules do not allow two units to switch spaces (unless one
unit is convoyed via a fleet in an adjoining body of water 
-- which is irrelevant for the Spring 1901 move 
considerations).  The two possible switches for Turkey are 
<tt>Con&lt;--&gt;Ank</tt> and <tt>Con&lt;--&gt;Smy</tt>.
Removing these possibilities 
reduces the number of possible end positions from 50 to 44 
as follows:

        A Con    A Smy    F Ank
        -----    -----    ---------------
         Ank      Arm     Bla 
                  Con     Arm Bla
                  Smy     Arm Bla 
                  Syr     Arm Bla 
         Bul      Ank     Arm Bla Con
                  Arm     Ank Bla Con
                  Con     Ank Arm Bla
                  Smy     Ank Arm Bla Con
                  Syr     Ank Arm Bla Con
         Con      Ank     Arm Bla
                  Arm     Ank Bla
                  Smy     Ank Arm Bla
                  Syr     Ank Arm Bla
         Smy      Ank     Arm Bla Con
                  Arm     Ank Bla Con
                  Syr     Ank Arm Bla Con

End positions don't take into consideration where the unit 
came from.  Thus, a position resulting from A Con --&gt; Ank 
and A Smy --&gt; Con cannot be distinguished from a position
resulting from A Con Hold and A Smy --&gt; Ank.  Dropping the 
source information, but retaining the unit type, reduces the 
number of possible end positions to 40:

         A Ank    A Arm   F Bla 
                  A Bul   F Arm Bla Con
                  A Con   F Arm Bla
                  A Smy   F Arm Bla Con
                  A Syr   F Arm Bla 
         A Arm    A Bul   F Ank Bla Con
         A Arm    A Con   F Ank Bla
         A Arm    A Smy   F Ank Bla Con
         A Bul    A Con   F Ank Arm Bla
                  A Smy   F Ank Arm Bla Con
                  A Syr   F Ank Arm Bla Con
         A Con    A Smy   F Ank Arm Bla
         A Con    A Syr   F Ank Arm Bla
         A Smy    A Syr   F Ank Arm Bla Con

Here is an enumerated list of the possible end positions
for Turkey.

OPENING MOVES
-------------

A starting point is to set an upper bound on the number of 
opening moves.  First, for each starting unit list the 
possible opening moves of that unit.  A move is one of four
types: Hold, Move, Support or Convoy.  For the purposes of 
this investigation, do not consider orders which have no
possible tactical benefit.  This rules out impossible
supports, impossible convoys and unneeded supports.  For
Spring 1901 no Convoy of any type need be considered.

               A Con       A Smy       F Ank
   ---------------------------------------------
   Hold    |   Hold        Hold        Hold
   ---------------------------------------------
   Move    |   -Ank        -Ank        -Arm
           |   -Bul        -Arm        -Bla
           |   -Smy        -Con        -Con
           |               -Syr
   ---------------------------------------------
   Support |               S Ank-Arm   S Smy-Arm
   ---------------------------------------------

The Hold and Move orders are self-evident, but the Support
orders may require justification.  For Turkey, the only 
contested end spaces in Spring 1901 are Arm and Bla.  The
only supports (which might possibly be needed) into these 
contested areas are the two indicated supports into Arm.  

This produces an upper bound on the number of distinct
opening moves for Turkey at (4 times 6 times 5) = 120.

This is an upper bound because it allows joint moves which
are not allowed (two units switching places) and includes
joint moves which have unneeded bounces.  Enumerating the
opening moves in a similar fashion to the end positions
above yields 54 distinct openings.  Below is a table of
these openings along with an index into the possible end 
positions each set of orders allows.

----------------------------------------------------------

Here it is allowed to bounce two units in Arm since that has 
the tactical result of keeping F Sev from entering Arm.  
Further, since Sev could support either Ank or Smy to Arm, 
this gives tactical impact to allowing Con --&gt; Ank or 
Con --&gt; Smy during this bounce as the Con move could 
possibly succeed.  

Below is the table which lists the end positions and which 
opening moves could possibly achieve them.

SOME OBSERVATIONS
-----------------

&gt;From the above tables it is seen that 17 end positions, if 
desired, can be guaranteed.  The other 23 end positions
depend on the orders submitted for F Sev.  Those end 
positions which can be guaranteed are:

  t04 t07 t09 t12 t15   t17 t20 t23 t24 t26 
  t27 t30 t31 t32 t34   t37 t40

Also, 21 possible end positions can only be generated from 
one opening.  Those end positions are:

  t01 t02 t03 t04 t09   t10 t11 t13 t14 t16
  t19 t21 t22 t28 t29   t30 t35 t36 t38 t39
  t40

CONCLUSIONS
