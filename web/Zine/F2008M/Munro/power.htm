<blockquote><i><p><b>Editor's Note:</b> The following article originally appeared in the november 2006 issue of </i><b>Owls Diplomacy News</b><i>, Thorin Munro's newsletter for players in the Owls series of games on <a href="http://www.floc.net/dpjudge/">the DPjudge</a>.

<p>What is power? I like the working definition
taken from physics, that power is the rate at
which work is done! Or, expressed as a formula,
power = work / time. The more power you have,
the more work you'll be able to do. And while in
a game of <b>Diplomacy</b>, power is more likely to
be thought of in terms of influence and control,
considering it in terms of 'the ability to get work
done (to your advantage)' is very relevant!
<p>Ultimately success in a game of <b>Diplomacy</b> will
boil down to how well you can get other players
on the map to work with you . Typically, the way
to do this is to find objectives or uncover
leverage that meets others' needs while also
delivering your own agenda. It is all about
'power'; understanding the power you have,
and how you go about using it&#8230
<p>When considering 'power' most people will
immediately think of the negative connotations
of power; abuse, manipulation, corruption. As a
result, many people have an aversion to the
concept and also the use of power. It feels dirty
and corrupting! However, when considered in
the light of power equating to the ability to get
things done, power begins to have a more
constructive and useful face. In fact,
understanding power in all its forms and
impacts becomes a key for success in
<b>Diplomacy</b>, and in life!
<p>There are six formal 'power bases' which, when
exercised, have differing impacts on people's
actions, thinking, and feelings. An awareness of
these types of power and an ability to judge
which power/s to exercise in a given situation,
will be the hallmark of a superior Diplomat!

</table>
<p>The first power base most of us learn to use is
<b><i>Coercion</i></b> &#8212 direct force or threat. This is the
classic 'stick' approach: "You will do what I say,
because if you don't there will be negative
consequences". In a <b>Diplomacy</b> game this will
usually be the threat of loss of territory, centres,
and elimination; but it <i>can</i> be psychological
coercion. "If you don't do what we agreed, I will
be angry, or will form an alliance with another
player," are threats that can often be very
powerful. The problem with this power base is
that whilst applied, it does produce immediate
action in the desired direction; but there will
likely be a building underground resentment
and desire for revenge. If the threat or leverage
is lost, there is often a reaction based on this
build-up.
<p>The next power base most people who work in
a job will be familiar with is <b><i>Reward</i></b>, or the
'carrot' approach. In its constructive form it can
be fair payment offered for services rendered.
It can, however, be corrupted into bribery and
pay-offs. Related to <b>Diplomacy</b>, the obvious
reward is a supply centre; but a creative
Diplomat will be attuned to what other players
want in the context of the game, and can
shape rewards in that manner. For example,
one player may have never survived a game,
and offering that may be a strong inducement.
Or another may have been wronged by a
neighbour and not have the forces to do
anything about it, whereas you do&#8230 Reward is
a double-edged sword. It is right to
compensate someone in exchange for what
you gain. However, prices have a tendency to
escalate; and beware the recipient finding
someone else prepared to pay a higher price.
Loyalty based purely on a payment is not likely
to be very strong.
<p><b><i>Positional</i></b> or <i>legitimate</i> power usually refers
to powers vested in a specific role. Policemen,
judges, managers, and even game-masters
have power based purely on their function and
laws or agreements. It is probably not a power
that is accessible to players in a <b>Diplomacy</b>
game. Still, there are times when a player will
try to leverage the power of the game-master.
Exercising legitimate power will get action, but
may not change attitudes. A speeding ticket
will get you to slow down in the short term, but
how effective it is in the longer term is
debatable.
<p>The use of <b><i>Information</i></b> is a power base key to
any Diplomat's success. Gaining information
from allies will be critical to your plans and
actions. Sharing information or spreading
misinformation will similarly influence actions
by others. As discussed in <a href="/Zine/S2007M/Munro/Lying.html">a previous article on
lying</a>, lies are a valid element in the game, but
breaking one's word is one of the most
important strategic decisions you will make in
the game. One of the best ways to build a
reputation as a reliable ally is through the
judicious sharing of information. The more
credible your reputation as a source of good
information, the more influence you are likely to
have with other players' actions. This virtuous
cycle can keep building until you have reached
the decision to play for a solo. Being found to
spread misinformation is likely to paint you as a
target by others.
<p>Closely aligned with the information power
base, <b><i>Expertise</i></b> as a power base means you
leverage past experience to try to influence
actions. Have you had experience in a
particular alliance, in organising a stalemate
line, invading a country, and playing a power or
with another player? Sharing this experience is
a solid way to build credibility and influence
action. The challenge is to do it in such a way
as to avoid coming across as a know-it-all,
because no one likes a know-it-all!
<p>Finally, the <b><i>Referent</i></b> or <i>trust</i> power base is
where you have built a credible, respectful
relationship, and are able to leverage it to gain
action from another. Operating from this power
base is likely to maintain or even enhance
goodwill and regard from others. The reward is
the relationship itself. Some players are very
skilled at establishing this rapport. Often it is
established over time through exercising a
combination of the previous power bases; but
it can be built on chatting about family,
holidays, politics, etc. The referent power base
is the hardest to build, but is usually the most
powerful one to be operating from. With the
relationship primary, there is a great reluctance
to stab or break an agreement. I would argue
that in the context of the game, building this
power dynamic is a strong way to play for the
solo &#8212 if you are ruthless enough!
<p>So what is the 'best' power base to use? In my
view it is purely situational. There are times
when a direct threat is the only way to prevent
or influence an action. The classic would be "If
you attack me I will throw the game to France".
A very powerful threat, if real and carried out.
However, the more sophisticated power bases
up to Referent are more sustainable. Threats,
Reward, and to some extent Positional power
are only able to maintain traction through
constant exercising of them. Once you remove
the threat or reward or oversight, actions are
very likely to shift, probably adversely to your
interests.
<p>The other factor to note is that it is rare for a
power base to be present in pure form.
Combinations and layers of power are used
constantly. Highlighting them as discrete forms
is purely to give more clarity to the range of
options and levers available to Diplomats.
<p>So remember, power is not a dirty word. You
want to have as much power as possible in
your <b>Diplomacy</b> games. This is how you will get
things done. The art is to not overtly display it
at all times; rather, use it well and wisely. The
awareness of these different forms of power
will broaden your arsenal, and help improve
your ability to shape the fate of Europe.
<p>Have fun!
