<blockquote><p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> Last issue, we introduced <a href="../../S2008M/Editor/bismark1.htm">the first Bismark lecture</a>, from a series of articles written anonymously back in the late 1980's in Australia. This time, we continue the series with a look at two different playing styles&#8230 </i></blockquote>

<p align=justify>Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. By now most of you have had the
opportunity to play <b>Diplomacy</b> through the demonstration games organised by
your friend and mine, Nurse Ratchet. I must say, I was surprised and
delighted at the level of deviousness and manipulation displayed in the
games, particularly by the paranoid schizophrenic cartel! Believe me, you
guys are naturals at the game. I should point out however, that the hospital
administration has requested Nurse Ratchet be returned unharmed and
immediately. It's been over a week now; and although, as some as you a have
pointed out, the tactic is perfectly legal under the <b>Diplomacy</b> rules, Nurse
Ratchet's loved one's are beginning to worry.

<p align=justify>And now, let us proceed further with our informal dissection of the
<b>Diplomacy</b> cadaver. As stated previously, it is not our intention to bore you
with recommended opening moves and established lines of play &#8212 what we seek
here is to explore the instincts of the <b>Diplomacy</b> player, and develop some
useful mental approaches to the game.

<p align=justify>The first approach for any novice player to consider is <i>the Bunny Syndrome</i>.
The Bunny Syndrome postulates that the new player will be perceived as
na&iuml;ve, insecure, anxious to ally, and therefore easy to manipulate. In other
words, a controllable ally, ripe for the stabbing at the appropriate moment.
Such a beginner or Bunny can therefore find himself powerfully allied and
doing extremely well, while more experienced or notorious players fall by the
wayside.
<p align=justify>Of course, developing the Bunny persona is an art that will only come with
practice and experience. In the best performers of the technique one can
liken it to a forty year old harlot successfully playing a reticent virgin.
Typical opening gambits that will identify you as a bunny are &#8212 "What do the
little black dots on the map mean?" and "Be gentle, I've never done this
before".
<p align=justify>It's important also to establish trusting eye contact with your senior ally
and generally carry on like on of the more endearing characters in an
animated Disney movie. What we are seeking here is a big brother type of
relationship, where your ally perceives himself to be in total control.
Some <b>Diplomacy</b> players claim that their pride and sense of dignity could
never allow them to play the Bunny role. A good <b>Diplomacy</b> player doesn't
pounce around agonising about pride, dignity, or self-respect when supply
centres are up for grabs. There is only one shame in this game, and that is
not winning &#8212 or even more unspeakable, being eliminated. Besides; in a game
which prizes the convincing liar, the skilful thief, the great deceiver,
what could be more glorious than the master of subservience? Those who
consider the Bunny persona weak are missing the point. Nerves of steel are
required to stand in a slaughterhouse next to an "ally" who holds a dripping
meat cleaver, stare him straight in the eye, and say "Why butcher me now when
you can do it later after you've used me for a few turns?"
<p align=justify>The other crucial skill of the Bunny is timing. There comes a moment when
your big brother's guard is down, and you must metamorphose from stumbling,
compliant Bunny to ruthlessly efficient hit man. When the Bunny delivers the
killing stroke, ideally he should be close enough to fully appreciate the
look of stunned surprise in his big brother's eyes. Sometimes, of course,
the professional Bunny chooses not to strike at all. Most typically this
would occur at a tournament where the Bunny might be content to play for
second place during the opening rounds, rather than surge into prominence
with a stab.
<p align=justify>Which brings us to <i>the Piranha Factor</i>. The Piranha Factor is triggered in a
game by the following causes &#8212 where one of the players has:<br><br>
<ol type="a"><li>previously won a prestigious <b>Diplomacy</b> competition; 
<li>positioned himself to win a game outright (e.g. gets more than ten centres); 
<li>displayed conspicuous bad breath, rancid body odour etc; or 
<li>(in PBM games) doesn't write letters.
</ol>
<p align=justify>When one of the above conditions applies, we are likely to see the Piranha
Factor &#8212 several players will spontaneously unite to rip the heart out of
their unfortunate victim, in a single-minded vicious attack reminiscent of a
feeding frenzy. Usually no amount of tricky diplomacy will deflect the
Piranhas from their goal.
<p align=justify>The only recognised defence against the situation is to underplay your hand
in all games and to hover one step behind the leader, within stabbing reach
if possible. If you go on to win, the trick is to appear stunned at this
apparent fluke, grin sheepishly, scratch your head in a vacant fashion, and
generally behave like a post-lobotomy patient who has stepped in dog poopy
and isn't sure what to do about it. The wise <b>Diplomacy</b> player plays like a
Bunny, and stabs like a Piranha.
<p align=justify>And now ladies and gentlemen, as the manic depressives among us are
beginning to foam at the mouth, I suggest we adjourn to the recreation room
for straitjackets and medication. I would also like to speak to a
representative of the paranoid schizophrenic cartel regarding Nurse
Ratchet's disappearance. Thank you.

In 1969 he delivered a series of lectures designed to introduce the art of <b>Diplomacy</b> to hospitalised schizophrenics. These lectures were later published in the Envoy from 1988-1990 and again in FIST! from 1995-1997, and are considered a vital part of the modern day diplomatic arsenal.
<p align=justify>Next time: Lecture 3, where Arthur Bismark examines the cadaver, probes
into the deepest parts of both the upper and lower bowel, and then brings
forth the guts for detailed discussion.</i></blockquote>
