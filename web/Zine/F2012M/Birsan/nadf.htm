<p>PRESS RELEASE:
<p>In yet another blow for (*or to) Progressive Management and
Cooperation, the leaders of the hobby of Diplomacy ("Ruining
friendships since 1959") has decided to appoint Chris Martin (nick
named-Dancing Queen &#8212; but not in the San Francisco meaning, not that
there is anything wrong with that) also known as "he who shall never
be supported into Belgium." as the new Chief of the North American
Diplomacy Federation.</p>
<p>The main requirement was that he was the one person who unanimously
was agreed that "all of us would gladly and repeatedly stab him
without loss of conscience or goodwill so as to demonstrate both the
promotion of good play and to gain a supply center or three."</p>
<p>The secondary requirement was that he has a pulse and not  sober
enough to actually refuse the &#8230;hmmmmm&#8230; honor (we all would rather
have Belgium) and&#8230; well&#8230; prestige (though we might have to read
that part of the orders ourselves to make sure it said prestige and
not something rude like Army Venice to Trieste).</p>
<p>All HAIL the new Chief of the NADF!</p>
