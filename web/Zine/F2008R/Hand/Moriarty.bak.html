    <TD align=JUSTIFY>
      <P align=justify>My friend Sherlock Holmes and I had taken our supper a 
      bit earlier than usual, and so it was with some pleasure that we realised 
      we could spend the remainder of our evening at the Calhamer Club. After 
      calling for a boy, Holmes dispatched messages to a number of our 
      acquaintances, informing them that we would enjoy their company there 
      should they be available and so inclined. Having sent the young courier 
      off to deliver these messages, we hailed a hansom cab and were on our way. 

      <P align=justify>Arriving at the club, we were gratified to see a number 
      of ongoing games, as well as a group of seven members holding a lively 
      conversation at the fire. Joining them, we inquired as to why they were 
      not engaged in a game, as they made up the perfect number for play. 
      <P align=justify>"Alas, Dr Watson, indeed we had been hoping to share a 
      board this evening," said a tall gentleman.

<!--
<P align=justify>
"It seems, however, that we will not be able to do as we had planned.
<p align=justify>
"Why might this be, sir?" I asked.
<p align=justify>
-->

	"In 
      point of fact, we had gathered here to-night to play our club's turn in 
      the All-Britain Rotation Game. Are you familiar with this event?" 
      <P align=justify>Being longstanding members of the Calhamer Club, Holmes 
      and I were most certainly aware of the game that had brought these seven 
      members to the club. "Indeed so, my good man!" I said. "The All-Britain 
      Rotation Game is a diversion shared each year by the various Diplomacy 
      clubs in Great Britain. <!-- is it not? -->The idea, if I am not mistaken, 
      is that members in each club play a single turn in the game and then 
      dispatch the position and other details of the game to some other club of 
      its chusing. On receiving these details, this next club will assign its 
      own group of seven to issue the orders for the next turn, then once more 
      pass the game details along, to yet another club." 
      <P align=justify>"Precisely correct, Watson," commented Holmes. "Before 
      transmitting the game to the next club, each club issues one set of 
      movement phase orders (and, if necessary, any retreat orders that might 
      ensue). That is, of course, unless the club receives the game in the 
      Winter phase, when instead it becomes their mission to provide adjustment 
      orders." 
      <P align=justify>"Quite right, Mr Holmes," the second man said. "And, as I 
      am sure you are aware, the All-Britain Rotation Game is something of a 
      shared whimsy&nbsp;. an inter-club lark, if you will&nbsp;. as each club 
      attempts to do the others one better in providing unconventional orders 
      that tickle the fancy. As you know, at year-end, each club supplies all 
      others with every set of orders that it had contributed, and the game is 
      replayed to great hilarity at each club's annual New-Year's reception. The 
      seven of us had been looking forward to expending our own best efforts 
      to-night to add the next humorous chapter to the game. Unfortunately, it 
      seems that we will not be able to do so...as least not this evening." 
      <P align=justify>"Why might that be?" I asked. 
      <P align=justify>"Sadly, Doctor, the details we received from the Order of 
      Devonshire Diplomats seem to be incomplete." 
      <P align=justify>Holmes furrowed his brow at the mention of the other 
      club. "Gentlemen, I am well-aware of the Order of Devonshire Diplomats, 
      and most particularly with one of their members, whose devious mind, with 
      all likelihood, is at the root of your problem. Pray, tell us what 
      confounds you." 
      <P align=justify>One of the seven stepped forward, holding an unsealed 
      envelope. "I seriously doubt that our situation is any way intended, Mr 
      Holmes, but you are definitely welcome to look at what arrived from 
      Devonshire. As I'm sure you will see, it seems clear to us that
	information was 
      inadvertantly left out of the envelope we received. In fact, we discussed 
      wiring Devonshire to-night to procure the missing information&nbsp;. and 
      would do so except that the club there is closed for the holiday. First 
      hunt there, you know." 
      <P align=justify>Holmes was then handed a single sheet of note paper, 
      reading: 
      <P align=center><IMG 
      src="torn_paper6-24.gif">

      <P align=justify>"This solitary torn sheet of paper is all we have, Mr 
      Holmes. Certainly this is not the entirety of what was to be transmitted 
      to us." 
      <P align=justify>"I agree, Holmes," said I. "This is simply a list of 
      armies, and an incomplete list at that! The page is torn, after providing 
      only five army locations. In fact, the list does not even indicate which 
      Great Power controls each of these five armies! Obviously this 
      information, along with the remainder of the list of armies and the list 
      of fleets, was accidentally left out." 
      <P align=justify>"We presume exactly that, Dr Watson," said a man in an 
      Eton blazer. "Additionally, we expect that the information that did not 
      reach us would specify which game-phase is next to be played, and would 
      also provide us with details regarding the ownership of the various supply 
      centres. Indeed, we theorise that it is not merely the torn portion of 
      this page that is lost to us; it seems quite likely that a second and 
      perhaps a third page&nbsp;. and conceivably even a game-map&nbsp;. were 
      also mistakenly omitted from the post. 
      <P align=justify>"...or may have somehow gone lost while in custody of the 
      Royal Mail," another man chimed in. 
      <P align=justify>I fully realised why these men had felt compelled to 
      abandon their evening plans. "Ah yes, fellows! Even had the full board 
      position been supplied intact, still without the game's phase known, you 
      would yet be in the dark as to whether you are to add a set of movement 
      orders or a set of adjustment orders to the game's history! I definitely 
      see your problem, gentlemen," I said. "It does seem as if you will need to 
      wait for the Devonshire club to re-open to receive correspondence and 
      forward the missing information to you." 
      <P align=justify>"Yes, Doctor; and 'tis most unfortunate timing for such 
      an accident to have occurred, what with the hunts in Devonshire," agreed 
      one of the other members. "However, Mr Holmes, since you say you are 
      acquainted with a member there, possibly you might do us the favour of 
      communicating our need to him, so as to reduce the delay as much as 
      possible? Even so, we will certainly be obliged to postpone our own 
      contribution to the game until we receive more from Devonshire." 
      <P align=justify>"Let us not resort to that, gentlemen," said Holmes. "In 
      fact, I believe my acquaintance <!Professor Moriarty>has it in mind to 
      bring some shame and disrepute on our fine club should we feel it 
      necessary to make a request for more information. Rather, I propose that 
      you sit and write orders for the next phase this evening!" 
      <P align=justify><IMG hspace=5 
      src="../../Common/stopsign.gif" align=left 
      border=0><B><I> Holmes intends to best the nefarious Professor Moriarty 
      once again. Can you position all the pieces for the next turn? Are the 
      Calhamer Club members to play a movement phase, or an adjustment phase? 
      And which power owns which supply centre? Can you give the members enough 
      information to allow them to play a turn then pass along everything that 
      the next club will need to know? Sherlock Holmes can do so. If you can 
      too, <!P align=justify><A href="mailto:manus@diplom.org">mail your answers
