    <TD align=JUSTIFY>
      <P align=justify>My friend Sherlock Holmes and I had taken our supper a 
      bit earlier than usual, and so it was with some pleasure that we realised 
      we could spend the remainder of our evening at the Calhamer Club. After 
      calling for a boy, Holmes dispatched messages to a number of our 
      acquaintances, informing them that we would enjoy their company there 
      should they be available and so inclined. Having sent the young courier 
      off to deliver these messages, we hailed a hansom cab and were on our way. 

      <P align=justify>Arriving at the club, we were gratified to see a number 
      of ongoing games, as well as a group of seven members holding a lively 
      conversation at the fire. Joining them, we inquired as to why they were 
      not engaged in a game, as they made up the perfect number for play. 
      <P align=justify>"Alas, Dr Watson, indeed we had been hoping to share a 
      board this evening," said a tall gentleman.

<!--
<P align=justify>
"It seems, however, that we will not be able to do as we had planned.
<p align=justify>
"Why might this be, sir?" I asked.
<p align=justify>
-->

	"In 
      point of fact, we had gathered here to-night to play our club's turn in 
      the All-Britain Rotation Game. Are you familiar with this event?" 
      <P align=justify>Being longstanding members of the Calhamer Club, Holmes 
      and I were most certainly aware of the game that had brought these seven 
      members to the club. "Indeed so!" I said. "The All-Britain 
      Rotation Game is a diversion shared each year by the various Diplomacy 
      clubs in Great Britain. <!-- is it not? -->The idea, if I am not mistaken, 
      is that members in each club play a single turn in the game and then 
      dispatch the position and other details of the game to some other club of 
      its chusing. On receiving these details, this next club will assign its 
      own group of seven to issue the orders for the next turn, then once more 
      pass the game details along, to yet another club." 
      <P align=justify>"Precisely correct, Watson," commented Holmes. "Before 
      transmitting the game to the next club, each club issues one set of 
      movement phase orders (and, if necessary, any retreat orders that might 
      ensue). That is, of course, unless the club receives the game in the 
      Winter phase, when instead it becomes their mission to provide adjustment 
      orders." 
      <P align=justify>"Quite right, Mr Holmes," the second man said. "And, as I 
      am sure you are aware, the All-Britain Rotation Game is something of a 
      shared whimsy&nbsp;&mdash; an inter-club lark, if you will&nbsp;&mdash; as each club 
      attempts to do the others one better in providing unconventional orders 
      that tickle the fancy. As you know, at year-end, each club supplies all 
      others with every set of orders that it had contributed, and the game is 
      replayed to great hilarity at each club's annual New-Year's reception. The 
      seven of us had been looking forward to expending our own best efforts 
      to-night to add the next humorous chapter to the game. Unfortunately, it 
      seems that we will not be able to do so...as least not this evening." 
      <P align=justify>"Why might that be?" I asked. 
      <P align=justify>"Sadly, Doctor, the details we received from the Order of 
      Devonshire Diplomats seem to be incomplete." 
      <P align=justify>Holmes furrowed his brow at the mention of the other 
      club. "Gentlemen, I am well-aware of the Order of Devonshire Diplomats, 
      and most particularly with one of their members, whose scheming mind,
	  with all likelihood, is at the root of your problem. Pray, tell us what 
      confounds you." 
      <P align=justify>One of the seven stepped forward, holding an unsealed 
      envelope. "I seriously doubt that our situation is any way intended, Mr 
      Holmes, but you are definitely welcome to look at what arrived from 
      Devonshire.
	  <!-- As I am sure you will agree,
	  -->
	  It seems clear to us that information was inadvertantly left out of
	  the envelope that we received. In fact, we discussed 
      wiring Devonshire to-night to procure the missing
	  information&nbsp;&mdash; and 
      would do so except that the club there is closed for the holiday. First 
      hunt there, you know." 
      <P align=justify>Holmes was then handed a single sheet of note paper, 
      reading: 

      <P align=center><IMG src="torn_paper6-26.gif">

      <P align=justify>"This solitary scrap of paper is all we have, Mr 
      Holmes. Certainly this is not the entirety of what was to be transmitted 
      to us." 
      <P align=justify>"I agree, Holmes," said I. "The page is torn, and
	  lists only two army positions and the owned status of only one
	  supply centres!
      Obviously, the remainder of the list of armies and of supply centres,
	  and the entire list of fleets was accidentally left out." 
      <P align=justify>"We presume exactly that, Dr Watson," said a man in an 
      Eton blazer. "Additionally, we expect that the information that did not 
      reach us would specify which game-phase is next to be played, and would 
      also provide us with details regarding the ownership of the various
	  supply centres. Indeed, we theorise that it is not merely the torn
	  portion of this page that is lost to us; it seems quite likely that a
	  second and perhaps a third page&nbsp;&mdash; and conceivably even a
	  game-map&nbsp;&mdash; were also mistakenly omitted from the post. 
      <P align=justify>"...or may have somehow gone lost while in custody of
	  the Royal Mail," another man chimed in. 
      <P align=justify>I fully realised why these men had felt compelled to 
      abandon their evening plans. "Ah yes, fellows! Even had the full board 
      position been supplied intact, still without the game's phase known, you 
      would yet be in the dark as to whether you are to add a set of movement 
      orders or a set of adjustment orders to the game's history! I definitely 
      see your problem, gentlemen," I said. "It does seem as if you will need
	  to wait for the Devonshire club to re-open to receive correspondence and 
      forward the missing information to you." 
      <P align=justify>"Yes, Doctor; and 'tis most unfortunate timing for such 
      an accident to have occurred, what with the hunts in Devonshire," agreed 
      one of the other members. "However, Mr Holmes, since you say you are 
      acquainted with a member there, possibly you might do us the favour of 
      communicating our need to him, so as to reduce the delay as much as 
      possible? Even so, we will certainly be obliged to postpone our own 
      contribution to the game until we receive more from Devonshire." 
      <P align=justify>"Let us not resort to that, gentlemen," said Holmes. "In 
      fact, I believe my acquaintance <!Professor Moriarty>has it in mind to 
      bring some shame and disrepute on our fine club should we feel it 
      necessary to make a request for more information. Rather, I propose that 
      you sit and write orders for the next phase this evening!"

      border=0><B><I> Holmes intends to best the nefarious Professor Moriarty 
      once again. Can you position all the pieces for the next turn? Are the 
      Calhamer Club members to play a movement phase, or an adjustment phase? 
      And which power owns which supply centre? Can you give the members enough 
      information to allow them to play a turn then pass along everything that 
      the next club will need to know? Sherlock Holmes can do so. If you can

<p align=justify>
The group of men and I stood dumbfounded by Holmes's words.  At last, a
red-headed man said, "Surely you jest, Mr Holmes!  Why, there is no way we
could possibly determine the game's phase&nbsp;&mdash; let alone the board
position!&nbsp;&mdash; from the sparse information we have received!"
<p align=justify>
I was entirely in accord. "Holmes," I pointed out, "the message from Devonshire
is quite incomplete.  You must agree with that!"
<p align=justify>
"I most certainly do not," my friend said.  "Incomplete, Watson?  No, indeed;
there is no
conclusive evidence of that.  The note is definitely sparse, and rather
stingy with the information that it imparts, but that is the most we can
say of it.
For all we know, it may yet provide us with a complete picture of the game.
Gentlemen, the author of this
note possesses a keen and devious mind.  I have had the occasion&nbsp;&mdash;
might I say, the misfortune&nbsp;&mdash; to have matched wits with him before.
As he was the party responsible for forwarding to our club all
information concerning
the All-Britain Rotation Game, it seems much more reasonable to presume 
that he has in fact done precisely that than it would be to
presume some failing on
his part, or on the part of His Majesty's post-handlers."
<!--
<p align=justify>
A tall fellow spoke next.  "I suppose you are correct, Mr Holmes, but the note has been
torn.  Certainly this is evidence that some information has not reached us."
<p align=justify>
"I think not," said Holmes.  "The fact that the paper has been torn is
evidence of one thing only, and that is that the paper has been torn.  We
can take from this fact nothing whatsoever concerning the words that may
be intended for us.  No, we have only the words that did reach us for that!"
-->
<p align=justify>
"Are you suggesting, Mr Holmes," asked the man with the Eton blazer, "that
we should behave as if this note were <u>not</u> torn,
and that it were instead neatly ended with some
text such as <i>'The End'</i> or <i>'And Nothing More Needs Be Said'</i>?"
<p align=justify>
"Well put, my good man," responded Holmes.  "The fact that the text
of the note
happens to have been written upon a torn sheet of paper
can be held of no consequence."
<p align=justify>
The eight of us who were gathered around the Great Detective found ourselves
wordless yet again.  At length, I put our case once more to my friend.
"Holmes," said I, "how can you possibly claim that this note contains all
that would be needed by these gentlemen?  Why, the note speaks only of
the owned status of one centre.
<!--
, and does not even give the controlling
power for the one it lists as no longer neutral.
-->
Further, it gives only two army locations, and avoids entirely the
details of unit and centre ownership.
The incomplete information about centres and armies is problem enough,
Holmes, but to top it all off, the note
says nothing at all about fleets!"
<p align=justify>
"Indeed, Watson!  You have struck the nail upon its head.  That
particular fact is undoubtedly
of primary importance to us!  The note says nothing at all about fleets!"
<p align=justify>
This did not alleviate our confusion in any way; the seven men and I simply
looked at one another in
dismay.  A bespectacled gentleman finally broke the silence.  "Perhaps
I have misunderstood, Mr Holmes.
You have asserted
that the note provides everything at all that is
necessary to allow us to re-create the game situation and position.
However, you concede that&nbsp;&mdash; among its great many other
shortcomings&nbsp;&mdash;
the message is completely silent on the subject of fleets!"
<p align=justify>
"Precisely so, fellows!" said Holmes, moving to take a seat at a game
table.  "I believe that this paper must include all necessary information
concerning the game...and it makes no mention of fleets whatsoever!"
