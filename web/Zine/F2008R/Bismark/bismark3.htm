<blockquote><p><i><b>Editor's Note:</b> This is the third in a series  of articles written anonymously back in the late 1980's in Australia. We introduced <a href="/Zine/S2008M/Editor/bismark1.htm">the first Bismark lecture</a> at the beginning of this year, and presented <a href="/Zine/F2008M/Editor/BISMARK2.HTM">the second</a> last issue. This time, the professor makes a few observations about the mindset of the successful <b>Diplomacy</b> player&#8230</i></blockquote>
<p>Ladies, gentlemen and the gender bewildered. Today I would like to explore
the mobster approach to the game: i.e. how to "heavy" six people and not go
to jail for it. To prepare for this role one must first grasp the essential
contradiction of the game &#8212 and that is that <b>Diplomacy</b> is not about
diplomacy at all, as practiced between nations in international affairs.
Stripped of the atmospherics, the game is about one predator feeding off
and striving to destroy six other predators. In the final analysis there is
nothing diplomatic, subtle, or dignified about this.
<p>The more useful parallel for the aspiring "heavy" would be Chicago in the
1930s. Enter the mind set of this style of play by imagining yourself as a
gang leader intent on expanding your blackmail and corruption rackets into
an adjoining territory. Anyone who stands in your way has just bought
himself a ticket to Morguesville; alliances are affectionate and brotherly
until the sucker has outlived his usefulness, betrayal is met with total war
and the realisation that your timing is off &#8212 somebody has shafted you
before you did the job on him.
<p>This is <b>Diplomacy</b> played today. The successful player is street wise and
stab smart. He earns the respect of fellow diplomats by spotting the stab
and deflecting it before the opposition even decided to go through with it.
Respect is the key here, with reputation translating into a decided edge in
the opening negotiations (but see <a href="/Zine/F2008M/Editor/BISMARK2.HTM">Lecture Two, "The Bunny and the Pirahna"</a> for what
can sometimes occur if your reputation is too awesome).
<p>Patients and friends, I know what you're thinking &#8212 how can an average,
everyday, institutionalised mental patient like yourself become what the
Sicilians term a "man of respect"? The answer to this, I believe, is to think
like a thug.
<p>Whereas many players would maintain that it is not too wise to be too
aggressive or threatening in the opening moves, I would recommend that the
aspiring Godfather go for the jugular. Whose jugular? The most exposed one
of course. Every country is vulnerable and/or insecure in the opening couple
of moves before alliances have been set. By burying the boot early into an
unsuspecting groin the Godfather hopes this will pin a bullseye onto the
victim, thus hopefully delineating the target for other vacillating players.
The hit must be executed professionally, with the target cut badly enough to
make retaliation unlikely. Nothing erodes the reputation of a diplomat more
than a tentative stab. The essential element of respect &#8212 as every good Mafia
boss knows &#8212 is <i><u>fear</i></u>. The other players must be wary of attacking you. The
best way to achieve this is by disruption of the Rhythm. The attacker must
find himself outguessed tactically, unnerved psychologically, and off
balance emotionally.
<p>When it comes to tactics I lean toward the maxim: "plan complex moves
against simple players and simple moves against complex players". Like all
maxims it is a little too glib but there is a truth in it. The less subtle
players will be dazzled by the unexpected and the advanced players, who
routinely expect the unexpected, are incapable of opting for the obvious
moves due to their pre-occupation with prestige. There is a great deal of
pressure at the top to try the flash moves that will vindicate reputations.
If, however, you are taking on a really advanced player who suspects you
will presume he will make a complex move and thus turns the tables by moving
like a moron, you will obviously have to double bluff him. It is this
convoluted logic like the latter that makes <b>Diplomacy</b> such a meaningless
intellectual pastime. In any event one of you is bound to look like a
tactically limited idiot by the end of this move.
<p>To psychologically unnerve the opposition requires a chilling reputation.
Remember, you are the Godfather, the Boss of Bosses. Any reckless fool that
even contemplates glancing at one of your centres must learn the hard way
that you are infamous for your single minded counter-attacks which drag on
for game years and spill over into vindictive Dip zine articles and letters
of abuse, finally culminating in assault and kidnapping at a convention
where such things are permitted and even encouraged.
<p>As an integral member of the mob you will have connections &#8212 friends who
will avenge you. The attacking player must fear that you are on better, more
intimate terms with the other players than he is. Your confident and
energetic diplomacy style should reinforce this. If you look like a winner
and talk like a winner it is surprising how often an opponent can be
manipulated into the role you have designed for him &#8212 the victim. The
psychological aspects of <b>Diplomacy</b> strategy tend to be underrated by most
players.
<p>The third aspect of disruption of rhythm is the most controversial and
recommended for only the committed Mafiosi style player. The theory is that
the Godfather verbally "heavies" the opponent to the point where the latter
loses his cool and reacts negatively under stress e.g. misorders, neglects
to diplome, opens himself to attack in his haste to attack you. Such verbal
taunting could range from the undermining, "My God, only a congenital idiot
could make a move like that", to the possibly truthful but nonetheless
distressing, "I hear your mother gives a great blow job".
<p>Insulting (or "ranking" as it is known in the States) is already prevalent in
high pressure tournaments. However, the Godfather takes it out of the realms
of the merely petulant and transforms the taunts into a consciously applied
propaganda tool guaranteed to get right up the nose of the opposition
player. Indecently, this sort of psychological warfare is common in most
hobbies and sports, and one only has to look at the World Chess
Championships to see where top level <b>Diplomacy</b> competitions are heading.
<p>The true gangster style employs a range of dirty tricks. In PBM games he
would kick off in Spring 1901 by writing a series of forged letters
purporting to be from two or three other players just to confuse matters and
assassinate the characters of potential targets. Following this he could
send a forgery on behalf of his targeted enemy to the GM informing him of a
change of address. If this works the fake address would consequently appear
in the games Dipzine and result in no communication getting through to the
targeted enemy for a move or two.
<p>In face to face the Godfather has a wide selection of low blows at his
disposal: submission of fake orders is currently proving very popular,
shadowing your opponent so that he simply cannot talk to any other player
alone is a nasty but legal tactic; and let's not forget the humble eavesdrop,
which really comes into its own at tournaments where space tends to be
confined.
<p>But now ladies and gentlemen and the gender bewildered, I see by the clock
that it now time for the Happy Hour at the pill dispensing counter. Good
night.

In 1969 he delivered a series of lectures designed to introduce the art of <b>Diplomacy</b> to hospitalised schizophrenics. These lectures were later published in the Envoy from 1988-1990 and again in FIST! from 1995-1997, and are considered a vital part of the modern day diplomatic arsenal.

reveal the cause of death, and makes some profound statements on this and
other related issues.
