<CENTER><FONT SIZE="6"><FONT COLOR="RED">'T</FONT></FONT>was the night before DipCon, and all through the halls,
<br>All the Dippers were bragging and scratching their balls 
<br>(where applicable).
<br>All the game boards were laid on the tables with care
<br>In the hope that Saint Calhamer soon would be there.
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">T</FONT></FONT>he players had gathered all their favourite snacks
<br>And were planning and plotting out sneaky attacks.
<br>The boards and the powers had been chosen by lot
<br>And the coffee was made in a ten-gallon pot.
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="RED">T</FONT></FONT>he moonlight was shining with a sick greenish glow,
<p>It’s Larry bent over and his pants are too low.
<br>Then out in the parking lot there was a loud crash.
<br>It sounded like a car knocking over the trash.
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">W</FONT></FONT>e charged to the window and we saw an old coot,
<br>Dressed up like a penguin in a decades-old suit.
<br>He came into the hall with a smile and a wave.
<br>“I’m a really good guy, not a scoundrel or knave!”
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="RED">“I’</FONT></FONT>m Allan Calhamer. I created this game.
<br>“It causes much discord, but I won’t take the blame!”
<br>The Diplomats whispered and their phones all came out.
<br>Web searches confirmed it, and they all nerded out.
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"<FONT COLOR="GREEN">H</FONT></FONT>is silver hair ruffled by the force of the breeze
<br>Of all the Diplomers falling down on their knees,
<br>“It’s great you adore me, but it’s only a game!”
<br>And he picked up some pieces and called them by name.
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="RED">“W</FONT></FONT>hite Russia! Blue England! Red Austria is best!”
<br>“Green Italy! Black Germany! Cyan French west!”
<br>“To play yellow Turkey in the corner takes guts!”
<br>Red Austria is best? He just proved he was nuts.
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">A</FONT></FONT> voice came from the back, from a skeptic named Claude:
<br>“Allan Calhamer is dead! I think you’re a fraud!”
<br>“A fraud? That is nonsense!” as our hopes ran aground.
<br>“I’m the most authentic Calhamer around!”
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="RED">H</FONT></FONT>e was beating a hasty retreat when he bounced,
<br>Off two extra-large gents who’d come in unannounced.
<br>“Come along Mr Hammer,” the rightmost one said,
<br>“Play time is all done now, please return to your bed.”
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="GREEN">“H</FONT></FONT>is name is Cal Hammer”, said the other, named Bob.
<br>“He wants to hang out with the Diplomacy mob.”
<br>“They will not let us play in the nursing home, man,
<br>“So I must get my fix in what places I can!”
<!>
<p><FONT SIZE="5"><FONT COLOR="RED">A</FONT></FONT>s he was taken away, we had to know how
<br>The ruse was detected. Claude stood up and said “Now,

<p><FONT SIZE="6"><FONT COLOR=GREEN>“I</FONT></FONT>t’s a lesson I learned when divorced by my wife.
<br><FONT SIZE="4"><B><I>“It’s much more than a game; it’s a whole way of life!”</I></B></FONT></CENTER>
