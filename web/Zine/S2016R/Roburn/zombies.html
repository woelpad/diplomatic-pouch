<p>Most honoured gentlemen,</p>

<p>I was perusing the old (and nearly defunct) e-mail account I used to use
for <b>Diplomacy</b> games, and I came across something that may be of
interest to you. I thought I would send it on.</p>

<p>A few years ago, I wrote an article in <a href="../../S2010M/">the
Spring 2010 Movement issue</a> entitled "<strong><a
href="../../S2010M/Roburn/zombies.htm">All Zombies Must Die!</a></strong>"
that described my "zombie" experiment. This was simply a game where I
decided to base my play purely on the press I received.  Playing England
and adopting the persona of the mad Lord Salisbury, I pledged to fight
silent players (that is, ZOMBIES) and to ally firmly with whichever player
sent me the best press. </p>

<p>As the article explains, that player turned out to be Germany. Together
we eliminated the silent France and Russia by 1905. </p>

<p>When the last ZOMBIE army fell, Lord Salisbury was overjoyed. In
celebration I wrote a short poem &#8212; a Shakespearean sonnet, actually
&#8212; but I forgot to include that poem in the article!</p>

<p>I therefore offer it for your consideration now:</p>

<blockquote><i><p><b><u>ON MY ANTI-ZOMBIE QUEST</u></b></p>

<p>Five years ago, I swore a swearing dread<br/>
To fight the greatest threat that man has known:<br/>
The MENACE of the HIDEOUS UNDEAD,<br/>
Who do not write, but merely LURCH and GROAN.<br/>
From Syria to Norway's northern fjords,<br/>
From Lisbon to the arid Russian plain,<br/>
I sought to stop the EVIL ZOMBIE HORDES;<br/>
To free all Europe from their HORRID REIGN!<br/>
Now, thanks to God and my good German friend,<br/>
Our object is achieved, and we have won!<br/>
The MIMES and ZOMBIES both have met their end!<br/>
We fought our fight, and now our fighting's done.<br/>
So join me as I thank our forces brave<br/>
For sending the damn things back to the GRAVE.</p></i></blockquote>

<p>Though it may be rather late to add it to the main body of the article
(honestly &#8212; has it been six years already? <em>Tempus celeriter fugit!)</em>,
I hope it may provide of some interest to yourselves and your readers.</p>

<p>I remain your devoted servant,</p>

<p align="center">Lord Salisbury, aka Charles Roburn</p>
