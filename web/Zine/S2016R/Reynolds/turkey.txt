The Trojan horse was a gift too...

A clever young lady played Turkey
With allies allergic to work-y.
To those lazy chumps,
She dealt out hard lumps
And chewed them all up like beef jerky.

Now see what you've done??? 8-)

Well, you're gifted.

I tried using geographic names (There was a young lady from Turkey... BLOCK
.)

I got a peek at the edition (which should be posted momentarily) and wanted
to let you know your talent is appreciated.

Good weekend to you and yours, too.

Hi, Kevin.

Thanks for your note! I appreciate your comments. I find that I have to be
in a certain frame of mind for the limericks to come. I'll go through long
spells with none, then for no good reason (and there can never be good
reasons for limericks 8-)) I'll produce a bunch of them in a row. Same with
the other types, though each has its own frame of mind/thought patterns.
Lately, I've been too busy to be thinking about much of anything... and
it's summer, with its attendant distractions. 8-)

Enjoy your weekend!

Harold

Great minds...

After the haiku in the last issue I tried the limerick artform.

I couldn't do it - and I'm glad I couldn't.

Yours, as per the normal standard, are excellent (and, of course, very
funny).

Thank you for saving myself from embarrassment.

Kevin
