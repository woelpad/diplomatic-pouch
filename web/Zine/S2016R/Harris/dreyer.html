<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%">It&#39;s
been a long time since I played FTF Diplomacy in any serious tournament. Still
Toby asked me for opinions about playing Italy. I&#39;m flattered of course. But
perhaps the evolution of playing styles have rendered my comments archaic and
irrelevant but still, this is what you get from a Swede living in exile in
Åland. BTW, living in Åland (autonomous region within Finland) makes me soon a
Finnish citizen. It would be fun to one day re-open my Diplomacy career, now
under Finnish banners...Toby, is there some special prize for someone who wins
the WDC twice for two different countries? :-)</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%">Anyway,
Italy is a hugely underestimated power to play. Sure, you can win with many
powers but generally Italy is considered a bad roll of the die. Contrary to
popular belief Italy is a good country both in the short term
&quot;c-diplo-ish&quot; game and the long term standard game. Let me elaborate
a little.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%">In
a short term game Italy doesn&#39;t grow too fast. Sure that&#39;s somewhat a limiter,
but it has also an upside. Grow too fast in the beginning of the game and
people will turn against you. I have played games as France or Russia where I
have actively been trying NOT to grow, and even asked people to attack me or
promised them a bounce in Galicia and not gone there myself. That makes people
think you&#39;re under attack and they don&#39;t bother so much about your doings.
Italy has this built-in. Another good thing with Italy is that Italy can almost
always influence the board balance. France getting too big? Send a unit to Pie
or lend Munich a support from Tyrolia. Turkey growing? Help Russia a little
into Munich. Or move away from France so that England might feel French
pressure which relieves pressure on Russia in the north and voila Turkey has
some Russian resistance. You get the point.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%">In
a long term game Italy is perhaps not the most likely to win, but I find it
easy to be part of a stalemate with Italy. If you expand east, then you will
probably be part of the alliance that later stops France from entering the Med.
If you expand west, then maybe you will be the one holding Por+Spa forever. Of
course, if you expand well you might instead be the one breaking all stalemates
since you are almost already on both sides of them.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%">My
favourite strategy as Italy is to bond with Austria as long as possible. Never
attack Austria unless you think you take all or almost all from him/her very
quickly. Otherwise you end up with a pissed Austria and a juggernaut rolling on
you. In a long game a perfect development would be to have Turkey build no
fleets, attack Turkey with Austria and then stab Austria together with Russia.
Unfortunately this is very obvious, so you need to come up with something else.
You need to make sure Russia and Turkey never are really allied. It can be okay
if they together help you take out Austria, but ONLY if you are 100% that one
of them will join you after the massacre. If you are not, then help Austria
survive and try everything you can to make R/T stab each other. As always, no
rule without exception. Perhaps if Austria is a really bad player it might not
be worth helping him/her because s/he will screw up the plan anyway by not understanding
the different defensive tricks one might come up with. I almost never attack
France seriously until later in the game. If you play the diplomacy well you
make sure France is somewhat open at a later stage, either because a sudden
attack by an ally or because of overstretching while trying to land in England.
Ideally France has taken one center and have two units in England when you
slide into Mid.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%">In
a short game the strategy would be totally different. Play safe, keep still,
powergame to make sure no-one grows more than 1-2 centers. Then at the right
time, stab the neighbour of your choice so you get up to 8-ish centers and win
the game. It can be noted that it might be worth it to make really bad moves to
prove to your neighbour that you&#39;re a nice guy. Up until 1906-1907 your
priority is to make a neighbour trust you and be vulnerable at exactly that
time. That&#39;s almost all you have to do. If he&#39;s open for a stab in 1903, don&#39;t
do it. 1904? No. 1905? Yes if you can take like three centers and at least two
more next year. </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:12pt;line-height:107%">Tactics
is not my best quality. That&#39;s why I suck on online diplomacy. But talking and
talking and talking and judging people&#39;s intents, that is how I win games. No
surprise then that Italy is a country I like to play. It&#39;s there in top three
with Germany and Austria. </span></p>
