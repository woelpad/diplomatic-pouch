<CENTER><h2>Goffie or Yoffy?</h2>						 
<strong>By Toby Harris</strong></CENTER>
<p>I will come to Yoffy in just a moment  just in case you were wondering. But this is all about the direct assault on Austria: Nap-ION, Rom-Ven, Ven-Tri.
<p>Truth is, how could anybody compete with that masterpiece of an article from Yann in the last few pages? So I figured it was best to play good host and take the comedown myself, rather than let some <em>unsuspecting newbie past WDC winner</em> [lol] fill the next gap.
<p>The truth is that I love this opening, and know from personal experience on the receiving end as Austria (WDC 2008) that Andrew Goffie does too. We are not alone. I am going from memory now, but after the first WDC in 1988 my team captain (Brian Frew) who played Austria wrote something along these lines by way of a post-WDC write-up;
<p> <em>Not sure whether or not I could trust Italy (Dane Maslen), I told him that I would open with the Hedgehog (Tri-Ven, Vie-Gal, Bud-Ser). Just as well, because Dane later confessed that he would have been into Trieste like a shot had I moved south with the fleet!</em>
<p>The next convention I saw Dane and asked him about this move (Ven-Tri). He replied:
<p><EM> If you know Trieste will be left open,  its a gift.</em>
<p>The logic is simple. Once in Trieste, it is near impossible for Austria to dislodge you in the Fall (or a retreat to Vie/Bud) so you get up to 5 centres in 1901. And the follow-up of Rom-Ven-Tyr is likely to be successful too. With a new army in Venice (as well as a F(Nap)), Italy starts 1902 in a very good position. All you need do from here is invite the others to join in

<p>
<p>If you get really ballsy with this opening, asking Russia to hold in Warsaw in Spring 1901 means that Austrias Vie-Gal succeeds. That leaves your new A(Tri) a 50/50 on Bud/Vie in the fall, so you can try for a second centre with Rom-Ven-Tri by way of follow-up.
<p>Tyrolia is usually the best final destination for your a(Rom) in Fall 1901 though; most Austrians should order Ser-Tri in Fall 1901 to bounce you, also meaning that you dont get to build a new army in Venice, so any new army remains bottled up in your Italian peninsula.
<p>I guess this is the question to ask; just how lucky do you feel  punk? Some of it is indeed a 50/50 guess. So here is a quote from Cyrille Sevin which explains 50/50 guesses perfectly: <em>There are GOOD 50/50 guesses, and there are 50/50 guesses that are not so good.</em>
<h2>Yes, but who is Yoffy?</h2>
<p>Not so fast  not done with Goffie yet. Truth is that I really love the Ven-Tri opening as much as he does, but we are also agreed in that theres a time and a place for everything. He said to me after that WDC08 game: <em>They (Austrias) dont usually defend themselves so well.</em> 
<p>Truth is that with various scissor combinations, Austria is far more defensive in the right hands than many give credit for. And there are often other personality combinations around the board to consider as well. For that reason, on a top table, Ven-Tri is usually a move that has been made with prior Austrian agreement. Perhaps a diplomatic gesture to give Italy a second fleet to attack France or Turkey (e.g. see Yanns brilliant article above!)
<p>There was a phase in the 1990s where I had a killer reputation as Italy; in another postal game, Harry Bond was playing Austria and his opening letter to me read <em>Toby Harris as Italy? I want my mummy!</em>. Harrys words stopped any early shenanigans  chances of entering Trieste were close to zero, so why waste the goodwill early on a limp chance?
<p>I saw Harry the following year at <strong>Manorcon</strong>  in a dress, with long hair and breast implants plus a name badge which read Sandra Bond. She was quite the talk of the event. In days gone by, where such operations were more new in concept to the average board gamer than they were to the more liberated characters such as <strike>Harry</strike> Sandra. It was a surprise.
<p>With typical <em>Scouse</em> (Liverpool) wit, James Hardy quipped that (s)he would now slide down the bannister quicker. And I will (for once) refrain from stating how he ended this sentence.

<p>So although I truly love the Goffie opening, with Danes <em>its a gift</em> comment and all, it is only good when they dont see you coming. So this is actually a <em>great</em> move for a less experienced player to spring on a grand master. If you want to scalp a big head then this is probably the way to do it. Just say you will hold in Venice, let the master trust you and then you have your position. But just beware  masters are good defenders of Austria too.

<p><strong>Yoffy </strong>was a puppet master. Search Wiki/Google for him, along with the keyword fingerbobs. And the hobby only has one true Yoffy where Italy is concerned  Cyrille Sevin. Dont get me wrong, there are many others in this class, but Cyrille made famous the Tyrolia (rather than Trieste) options for Austria. And he backed this opening up with an entire cornucopia of options. Flexible, defensive, aggressive and always looking like his weak Italy will very soon become a dominant Italy. Ven-Tyr every time.
<p>I learned to play Italy the <strong>Hard Way</strong>  mis-ordering F(Tun)  ION in Spring 1901 at the first World Dipcon. Ok, so I got an equal top of the board in that game, but a no-build Italy in 1901 is a scary place to be when there are three French fleets headed your way.
<p>But my real lesson playing Italy was two years before  Midcon 1986, during a friendly game.
<p><strong>The Midcon 1986 Friendly</strong> <p>I dont remember every player in this game (it was after the Saturdays main game and just a friendly) but can name a few; John Colledge, Brian Frew, Julian Shepley, John Wilman. Names I refer to from time to time. John Colledge will be at EDC Manorcon in July, and Brian Frew was at the last UK EDC. We drew countries out of the hat and when given Italy it was clear I was unhappy. Worse still  I mis-ordered my bog-standard 1901 build (+ F(Tun) ??!!).
<p>My entire attitude towards Italy changed during this game, and it is best to switch to Brians post-game write up in his zine of the day (<em>Veni Vidi Vici</em>) which read <em>something</em> like this:

<p><em>The highlight of the game came when Toby, after trying to build a fleet in Tunis in 1901 (the lad was a bit jaded), recovered in 1903 by being supported into Con by Austria, supported into Bul by Russia and helped himself to Trieste. Nice one!</em>

<p>I have never re-quoted this paragraph before. It was something I just kept as a fond memory. And the whole point is not about me; it is to ask yourself how would you <em>feel </em>if you despised playing Italy, mis-ordered your 1901 build and then this happened? Suddenly the country springs to life. And thats how I felt at the time, why I love Italy (and always will) and why you should never give up when playing Italy. In all truth, the others all wanted to help me after such a bad start, and most got punished for their kindness . (wicked grin).
<p>Maybe Italy is the <em>Cinderella</em>  but a Cinders in high-heeled boots who knows how to kick?

<p><strong>Making This Italy Article Extra Special?</strong>
<p>I have written articles on playing each country before, culminating in my historic postal DipZine (Smodnoc)s celebratory 50th issue in May 1993. For that particular issue I planned all along to make the Italy article one of the zines centre pieces, and a copy of it remains visible on the internet. 

<p><a href=http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/why_italy.htm>
This is what I had to say about Italy in 1993</a>.
<p>Check out the reasoning behind when to build a fleet in Venice  its still good.
<p>Indeed, I doubt many of our greats will give good reason for building a fleet in Venice!
<p>Because that article was so well received historically, I wanted to improve upon it here. 
<p>I am not a regular character and could not write seven Bibles  one for each country. <p>But do check out that link above on playing Italy  It covered a lot of ideas. And do heed the ideas of the WDC greats in this article, because there is more yet to come. Much more.

<p><strong>F Nap  Ion; A Ven  Tri; A Rom  Ven </strong>
 <p>There are a lot of ways to attack Austria as Italy, but by far the best one is the all-out assault. The trade-off is that if it fails, it tends to fail spectacularly <strong>[indeed, Andrew?]</strong>.
<p>Italys great advantage in <strong>Diplomacy</strong> is that it can control the speed of the game. The idea of this blatant attack is to ramp the speed up as high as possible, starting a race with you in first position and hopefully no one else even noticing the race is on!
<p>The bad news is that if you get bounced then youve still created the race and youve lost any hope of gaining enough tempo to be in the lead. Do not do this opening unless you are very sure that you will walk into Trieste. Lets be perfectly clear about this: bouncing in Trieste is a disaster for Italy. So, given the risk, why do it?
 <p>The opening cripples Austria and the objective is for you to be playing as both Austria and Italy by 1903. Speed is everything in this strategy. Key to this is the Fall 1901 follow-up of A Ven  Tyl. This is because for the plan to work you must build another army in Venice or you are not going fast enough <strong>[love it  as you say, it must work though]</strong>.
<p>It doesnt matter if you get kicked out of Trieste as there will always be an open centre for you to retreat to. In fact, you want this to happen since then Austria is wasting even more units. One suggestion is Tri  Ser with (TUR) Bul - Gre as this is very attractive to most Turkeys and leaves Austria build-less.
<p>In Spring 1902, you force Trieste up to Vienna, and in fall you should force Venice into Trieste and hold Vienna  building another army. You can also have fleets in Albania and Ionian or may even support a Turkish fleet to Greece (a fleet will only get in his way when it comes to Serbia later on). 
<p>Diplomatically, you need to play Russia and Turkey off against each other. Working with Turkey (You attack Russia, Ill attack Austria) is most common, but anything that gets the job done is fine. 
<p>This is the strategic vision for this game  by Fall 1903 youll have all the five traditional Austrian centres and can play as if you were Austria  roll into the Balkans, flank against Turkey, or just keep those armies moving North to Russia. 
 <p>Speed is everything. Absolutely everything. As soon as the rest of the board realizes what is going on, your progress will slow dramatically. If that is in Spring 1901 with a Trieste bounce, then youre in trouble. If its in Spring 1906 after youve taken all of Turkey as well, then you are guaranteed 15. And any later than that
<p><strong>The core of it is: </strong>
<p>Italy controls how fast the game moves.
<p>If Italy can move very quickly, then it can get big very quickly. But the risks are high.
<p><em>Dont</em> consolidate. The moment you sure up a centre the gig is up - you must keep pushing faster faster faster. 
 <p>I did also fib... [Ven - Tyl - Vie] + [Rom - Ven - Tri] is better, but no Austrian is <em>that</em> stupid.

<p><strong>[Toby Harris:  Andrew thank you so much for this. Actually, this is my favourite opening as Italy also, but I so rarely ply it now. My best ever results as Italy (i.e., the 18s) have mostly come via this opening also. It is so fast and potent. But when it goes wrong its a disaster.
<p>There are two conditions to make it go wrong
<OL>
<li>A Competent Austria
<p>Andrew successfully opened this way on me at WDC 2008. Rom-Ven, Ven-Tri. It worked. By mid-game he said Austrias dont usually defend themselves so well. 
<p>
<li>The Rest of the Board
<p>The other time this opening went badly for me was at an Italian EDC. Actually the opening went so well (I took both Tri & Vie in Fall 1901) that everyone else took note and piled into me. I faced not only the greatest and almightiest players but also  Davides finger! I was doomed !!</li></ol>

<p>But in reality Davide Cleopadre played well  he took precautions and was ready for a full frontal fight. He beat me in that game, was focused and knew his objective  an Italy who takes 6 centres in 1901 is a danger.

<p>Now, back to Andrew Goffs article. Andrew has a masterful talent for diversion for sure!]</strong>
