<H3>Here's the Mail</H3>
<p>It's back! At long last, we have some modest feedback to include in a Pouch Deposits column!</p>

<p>Without further ado&#8230;</p>

<p>In your article on China and South Africa,</p>

<p>You could have mentioned that at the first DipCon in South Africa I attended (and won) and I was able to negotiate with Hasbro for a 5K publication of the DipMap for South African school distribution.</p>

<p>If it isn't too late and you and Charles have a bit of space (e.g. maybe a little box somewhere), I'd like to put out a call for volunteers to help on an article having to do with the subject of "Taking the Measure of a Dipper? How do you read another player?"</p> 

<p>It's not exactly a Strategy, Tactics, and Diplomacy subject; more like a Negotiations subject, I guess. Edi would be the logical person to ask since he's a master at it, but I'd like to get some input from new contributors!</p>
