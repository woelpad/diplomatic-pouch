<p>I recently drew Turkey for the third time in a row, and that did not appeal to me at all. I like a bit of variety in my Powers, but more importantly my Turkish games are very stressful. In the first game I was brought down to 2 centers and managed to crawl back to 9 centers until I was part of a three-way draw. That sounds cool, until you have to do exactly the same in your very next game (except that I got 11 centers, not 9). I had no particular wish to go through the process a third time.</p>

<p>Still, it was clear that the Universe ordered me to improve my Turkish play. So here we go again. But let’s use our brains this time.</p>

<p>As usual, initial press was vague, and despite their courteous replies I trusted neither Russia nor Austria. So I went into the Spring 1901 moves without a clear alliance &#8212; or even a clear tactical goal beyond picking up BUL. What I did have was distrust of Austria and Russia. Especially of Russia, since he’s closer. And bigger.</p>

<p>That’s when I decided to play:</p>

<code>A CON - BUL<br/>
F ANK - BLA<br/>
A SMY H</code>

<p>It’s that last order I’d like to discuss in this article. As far as I know it has never been treated systematically, even though I think that, in certain situations, it is preferable to the more common A SMY - CON.</p>

<p>I analyzed 252 games from the <a href="http://www.floc.net/dpjudge/">DP Judge</a> “owls_” series that ran from 2005 to 2012, <a href="A_SMY_H.txt">noting</a> Turkey’s opening with A SMY, and especially the A SMY - CON - BUL sequence. I found that in only 19 of those games (8%) the Sultan orders A SMY H in Spring 1901. Moreover, in 16 of those games it was combined with F ANK - CON, obviously as part of some Russo-Turkish deal. Only three out of 252 games used A SMY H in combination with F ANK - BLA, as I did.</p>

<p>So either I’m a Dip genius who’s invented a new Turkish opening, or I’m a silly newbie with no knowledge of opening literature and not enough wits to see the obvious deficiencies of his idea. This article tends toward the former point of view, but the truth will, boringly, lie somewhere in the middle.</p>

<br/><h2>A SMY openings</h2>

<p>What is A SMY’s best opening move? That’s clear: A SMY - ARM. It deploys the army satisfactorily and brings it in direct contact with a pickup possibility, SEV. Combined with a succesful F ANK - BLA it is the most powerful Spring 1901 move Turkey can make. There’s but one tiny problem: it plunges you into an irrevocable death struggle with the Tsar. If that’s what you want, go to ARM. If that’s not what you want, do something else.</p>

<p>So. Which orders do Sultans give A SMY?</p>

<p>Nothing too surprising here.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The most popular order is A SMY - CON. Over half of Sultans opt for 
it. This article will argue that that popularity is somewhat undeserved.</p></li>

<li><p>One out of four Sultans go to war with Russia immediately by moving A
 SMY - ARM. I laud their courage, but so far I declined to follow their 
example.</p></li>

<li><p>Next comes A SMY - ANK, in 31 out of 38 cases combined with a 
pro-Russian F ANK - CON. There is nothing the army can do in ANK what it
 cannot do in SMY, so this move is useless. These Sultans give A SMY 
something to do because all units should do something in Spring 1901.</p></li>

<li><p>19 Sultans play A SMY H, but 16 of them combined it with the 
pro-Russian F ANK - CON. This is the more honest version of the moves in
 the previous bullet point.</p></li>

<li><p>Then there’s the lone soul that played A SMY - SYR. Let’s take a moment to appreciate his capacity for confusion.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>We’re left with three eaxct copies of my move, and seven cases where A
 SMY - ANK is combined with F ANK - BLA, which sets up nearly the same 
tactical and diplomatic situation, though I will argue later that the 
hold order is slightly preferable.</p>

<p>Ten out of 252. 4%. Not a lot.</p>

<br/><h2>A SMY - CON &#8212; and on</h2>

<p>Why do half of the Sultans play A SMY - CON? The commonly stated 
reason is that in Fall it could move on to BUL in case A BUL picks up 
one of the other Balkan centers.</p>

<p>Does the data bear this out? Let’s define “success” as the picking up of an extra Balkan center, and see where that leads us.</p>

</table></p>

<p>A 75% failure rate is not very good. But maybe we’re being unfair 
here. Maybe some of the options that don’t bring in a second Balkan 
center have other merits.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>A CON S A BUL sounds useful in case the Balkan is wilder than 
expected. 
However, A BUL was attacked 0 out of 8 times (0%). Four times Austrian A
 SER and Russian F RUM were present but did not attack A BUL, and the 
other four times only one of them was present, so the support order was 
unnecessary. Supporting A BUL turns out to be useless.</p></li>

<li><p>A CON - SMY, back to where we came from. Why? In 7 out of 8 cases 
Turkey wanted to build F CON in Winter. That’s an excellent reason for 
keeping CON empty, and kudos to these seven players for seeing it. 
Still, if they saw the truth why did they send A SMY - CON in the first 
place?</p></li>

<li><p>A CON - ANK. Sounds like trouble with Russia &#8212; and that, in turn, 
means that the army should never have been sent to CON. Five out of 
seven cases are related to Russian incursions, the sixth was to help 
destroy the Russian southern fleet with the Tsar’s permission, and I 
have no idea why the seventh Sultan chose to go to ANK. I’m afraid the 
Sultan himself didn’t, either.</p></li>

<li><p>A CON H was the favourite passtime of seven Sultans. The most likely
 explanation is that they ordered a nice parade to impress their latest 
concubine.</p></li>

<li><p>Finally, seven attempts were made to convoy the army elsewhere. 
That’s the best thing you can do when not going to BUL, and three 
convoys were even succesful.</p></li>

</ul>

<p><em>All</em> orders that do not attempt to move the army to a supply 
center are either pointless, or show that the army should not have been 
sent to CON in the first place. Thus it is proven that the sole reason 
for A SMY - CON in Spring is to conquer a second Balkan center in Fall.</p>

<br/><h2>The risk of A SMY - CON</h2>

<p>How risky is moving to CON in Spring? Worst case scenario: bounce in 
BUL while the Tsar invades ARM. The Spring move to CON did not yield any
 results <em>and</em> invited an incursion. How often does this happen?</p>

<p>In about 1 out of 8 cases, a Sultan moving A SMY - CON is subjected 
to a Russian invasion in ARM in Spring 1901, Fall 1901, or Spring 1902. 
That’s not too huge a risk to run.</p>

<ul>

<li><p>In five cases the Tsar invaded immediately in Spring, and the Sultan
 was forced to reply with A CON - ANK. These Sultans misjudged their 
diplomatic position.</p></li>

<li><p>9% of Sultans playing A CON - BUL suffer an invasion of ARM &#8212; likely
 because ARM is indefensible and the Sultan, again, misread his 
diplomatic position. Still, a chance of less than 1 in 10 means the move
 is pretty safe.</p></li>

<li><p>It seems that attempting and failing to convoy A CON - RUM is a good
 indicator of an invasion of ARM in the next turn. Russia and Turkey are
 seriously at war, and Turkey fails to harm Russia in RUM. Hence the 
Tsar is in a mood <em>and</em> a position to extract revenge. (Still, 
there are only three failed attacks on RUM, so we may see a statistical 
artifact here. The theory sure <em>sounds</em> nice, though.)</p></li>

</ul>

<p>While I had expected to find that many Sultans moving to CON would be
 invaded in ARM, the data does not bear that out. Moving A SMY - CON is 
relatively safe &#8212; probably because it’s combined with F ANK - BLA, which
 almost forces the Tsar to play F SEV - BLA (bounce) and thus keeps ARM 
safe from incursions.</p>

<p>Moving A SMY - CON may be fairly safe, but that doesn’t make it useful. Or succesful.</p>

<br/><h2>A CON - BUL</h2>

<p>How can a Sultan know if A SMY - CON in Spring is a good idea? Which factors make a grab for a second Balkan center succesful?</p>

<ul>

<li><p>In about half the cases Austria or Russia or both are distracted by 
wars elsewhere. They may fight each other, or Austria may become 
embroiled with Italy, or Russia may opt for a northern strategy. All 
these occurrences lead to a profoundly happy Sultan and Balkan pickup 
opportunities.</p></li>

<li><p>In about a quarter of the cases Turkey concluded an alliance with 
Austria against Russia. This, too, is a clear advantage for a Sultan 
seeking happiness and the picking up of a second Balkan center.</p></li>

<li><p>The rest is a mixed bag of other alliances, NMRs, and stupidity, 
though I would like to take a moment to praise the diplomatic brilliance
 of the two Sultans who were supported into RUM by Austrian <em>and</em> Russia.</p></li>

</ul>

<br/><h2>Summary so far</h2>

<p>So we’ve seen the following:</p>

<ul>
	<li><p>Out of four Sultans, two send A SMY to CON, one to ARM, and one does something else &#8212; usually a pointless move to ANK.</p></li>
	<li><p>Out of eight Sultans who move A SMY - CON, one is invaded in ARM over the course of the first three turns.</p></li>
	<li><p>Out of four Sultans who move A SMY - CON, two subsequently order A 
CON - BUL but bounce, one orders the same and succeeds, and one does 
something that proves the army should never have been sent to CON.</p></li>
	<li><p>Out of four Sultans who conquer a second Balkan center, two succeed
 because Austria and/or Russia fight elsewhere, one thanks to Austrian 
support against Russia, and one for other reasons.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>So the A SMY - CON move is a fairly safe one, but it’s only useful in
 certain specific diplomatic circumstances: Austria or Russia fighting 
elsewhere, or an Austrian alliance against Russia.</p>

<p>We can go even further: A SMY - CON only makes sense if the Sultan knows about these diplomatic circumstances <em>in Spring</em>. If he doesn’t he’s just guessing when he sends off A SMY - CON.</p>

<br/><h2>The useless army</h2>

<p>Why do so many Sultans resort to guesswork? I think they don’t know 
what to do with A SMY. Let’s face it: if you don’t want to go to ARM 
straight away, A SMY is a rather useless army. Who hasn’t wished for F 
SMY instead?</p>

<p>Still, Sultans think they are required to make it do something 
because all units should do something in Spring 1901. That’s mostly 
true, but not entirely. A VEN H is fully accepted as part of Italian 
openings.</p>

<p>I believe that the same should go for A SMY H. I believe that, if it 
cannot play a well-defined role in ARM or the Balkan, A SMY should be a 
garrison unit, aimed at defense rather than offense.</p>

<p>A SMY has one use that A CON does not have. It can guard your frontiers against treacherous Tsars. By threatening A SMY - ARM <em>in Fall</em>
 you have a lot more leverage in your negotiations. Even better, you 
haven’t actually declared war on him &#8212; you just hover there menacingly.</p>

<p>Turkey is strong in defense. If you’re unsure of your alliances, 
unclear on what the rest of the board is going to do, and generally 
groping around, you should consider keeping A SMY right were it is in 
order to strengthen your defense even more.</p>

<p>Using a unit defensively is not ideal in the early game, but these 
are the sub-optimal cards Calhamer has dealt the Sultan, so we should 
play them as well as we can. If 75% of the attempts to deploy into the 
Balkan fail, it’s time to look for other options.</p>

<br/><h2>The useful center</h2>

<p>There’s a second fact that’s overlooked too often: CON is Turkey’s prime building center.</p>

<p>Winter 1901. The Sultan has one build, and that means a fleet. But where to build it? SMY and ANK are so dreadfully <em>final</em>:
 you proclaim to the world at large that you’re either going after Italy
 or Austria, or after Russia. Sometimes you want that, but at other 
times you want to hedge your bets.</p>

<p>Solution: build F CON. This offers you maximum flexibility and 
leverage in negotiating with both sides &#8212; unless a by now 100% useless 
army sits in CON for the Sultan’s concubines to admire.</p>

<p>The other use for CON is as a destination for F BLA in case you 
strike a deal with the Tsar between the Spring and Fall moves. If it 
were occupied by a 75% useless army you’d have to either play it safe 
and send your fleet back to ANK (a tactically ridiculous move if there 
ever was one), or move A CON back to SMY (proving A SMY - CON should 
never have been ordered in the first place).</p>

<p>I believe that, because they play A SMY - CON too often, Sultans are 
generally not making enough effort to keep CON open in Fall and Winter.</p>

<br/><h2>A SMY’s role</h2>

<p>Concluding, we can see that A SMY has three distinct roles it can play:</p>

<ol>
	<li><p>Attack the Tsar. Tactically, this is the best option. Diplomatically, it may not be wise.</p></li>
	<li><p>Grab a second Balkan center. This works only if you have a good 
Austrian alliance, or if Austria and/or Russia are waging war elsewhere.
 And you have to be sure of all that <em>in Spring</em>.</p></li>
	<li><p>Defend against Russia while keeping CON open for a build.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Right now the second option is overrated at the expense of the third.
 I would argue that, in the absence of A SMY - ARM, A SMY H should be 
the default order, to be used <em>unless</em> the diplomatic circumstances I described apply <em>in Spring</em>.</p>

<h3>A SMY - ANK?</h3>

<p>There remains one more point to argue: A SMY - ANK. It offers the same benefits as A SMY H: it covers ARM and keeps CON empty.</p>

<p>I believe A SMY H is superior to A SMY - ANK in case Russia plays F 
SEV - ARM &#8212; a stupid move, but that doesn’t stop some Tsars. With an 
army in ANK you must hold, but with an army in SMY you can try to set up
 a bounce that leaves ANK free for a build.</p>

<p>Still, that scenario is an edge case, and my real reason for 
preferring A SMY H is psychological. If A SMY is a defensive unit, let 
it behave as one. A SMY - ANK is a non-move, so be consistent and don’t 
move A SMY at all.</p>

<p>By underscoring them with a Spring 1901 HOLD order that’s bound to 
raise eyebrows, you can make A SMY’s strong defensive capabilities clear
 for all to see &#8212; especially the Tsar.</p>

<br/><h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Thus I argue that, in the absence of a move to ARM, the default order
 for A SMY should become a hold instead of a move to CON. This offers 
extra security against the Tsar without declaring war on him, and it 
keeps CON free for a build. Conversely, three out of four times the A 
SMY - CON move is useless.</p>

<p>If necessary you should not hesitate to send A SMY to CON, but you 
should first evaluate your diplomatic position for any signs of a second
 Balkan pickup, and not order A SMY - CON just to give the unit 
something to do.</p>

<p>A SMY H allows you to negotiate with Russia from a position of 
strength. That’s a lot better than ordering a 75% useless army to occupy
 your prime building center in order to ogle concubines.</p>
