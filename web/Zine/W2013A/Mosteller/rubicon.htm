<p>On the big map that charts the entirety of play-by-mail gaming, there exists a Rubicon that many a brave soul has never yet dared to cross.</p>

<p>Indeed, both the signs and the evidence all point to a common convergence. There is <b>Diplomacy</b>, with its die-hard cadre of <b>Diplomacy</b> purists, and then there is all the rest of play-by-mail. Between them lies the infamous Rubicon, the point of no return.</p>

<p>The line, itself, is intangible &#8212; but, that doesn't make it any the less real. It is a boundary. It serves as a border. The question that I would pose, though, is: What does it divide?</p>

<p>The bare truth be known, I have no vested interest in persuading any <b>Diplomacy</b> player to enjoy <b>Diplomacy</b> less than they already do. My interest in writing this article, in authoring this opinion piece, is a very narrow one, and I constrain it to the splitting of a single hair.</p>

<p>If anyone can appreciate perspective, then unquestionably, it is the <b>Diplomacy</b> player. The Rubicon that runs between us runs long, to be certain, yet at its narrowest point, it is but a hair's breadth wide. By this, I simply mean that I think that crossing this Rubicon is possible. In fact, I think that it's more than possible. I think that it's feasible. And, at the risk of being called a heretic by both camps, I dare say that not only should this Rubicon be crossed, but that it is imperative that it be crossed with frequent regularity.</p>

<p>I need not remind <b>Diplomacy</b> veterans of <b>Diplomacy</b>'s role in exploring the concept of gaming by mail. Indeed, was it not the stalwart souls of <b>Diplomacy</b> that led fervent expeditions across countless zip codes long before Rick Loomis ever tried to fly a buffalo? Flying Buffalo! Why, who had ever heard of such a thing?! The dawn of commercial play-by-mail gaming transpired well after the sun first rose on <b>Diplomacy</b> enthusiasts using the postal service as their beast of burden to facilitate that which they loved.</p>

<p>The Internet casts a long shadow, and it is all too easy to get lost or distracted by it. Many are the fingers that point to the Internet as a threat to our mutual existence &#8212; a bane to both <b>Diplomacy</b> and PBM.</p>

<p>I grow weary of attending the funeral of play-by-mail gaming. I cannot even begin to count the number of times that I have heard the tired refrain of its death march. Hell, I, myself, have preached its funeral on more than one occasion. After all, if it's a funeral that they are a hankerin' fer, then by God, it's a funeral that they shall have!</p>

<p>Into the eye of the Internet, myself and a few others have spit. With the 21st Century already well under way, and with the Internet increasingly permeating everyday life of the masses, we decided to launch, of all things, a new PBM magazine. Why, who's ever heard of such a thing, in this day and age?!</p>

<p>Over the years, staring across the Rubicon has proven to be an exercise akin to watching grass grow. Rest assured, I have no desire to disturb the comfortable. What I'm looking for are a few lads and lasses that might be itching to try their luck on an expedition of a new sort. What I'm needing are a few daring souls well-versed in intricacies of <b>Diplomacy</b>. What I'm after is a Rubicon Brigade!</p>

<p>We have a new PBM magazine. I entreat you, one and all, to form a <b>Diplomacy</b> honor guard for this publication still in a state of relative infancy.</p>

<p>Both <b>Diplomacy</b> and PBM gaming share a common legacy. I believe that we can share a common destiny, as well.</p>

<p><a href="http://playbymail.net/mybb/forumdisplay.php?fid=17"><i><u>Suspense & Decision</u></i></a> is the name of this PBM magazine. One only has to cross the Rubicon to find it.</p>
