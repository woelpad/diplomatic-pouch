<p>The curtain is closing on WACcon. It's been a great ride.  WACcon 2014 is the last annual WACcon event. On January 23rd, 2014 we will host our 10th full-blown Seattle WAC tournament and our 12th year of hosting WAC-related events.  As appropriate for a swan song, WACcon will also hosting the North American Diplomacy Convention.</p>
<p>Since 2003, 138 players have attended one or more WACcon events. Since its inception, WACcon has tried to create an environment for players to play some good <b>Diplomacy</b> and enjoy themselves.  We host it at the Washington Athletic Club (WAC), a private club with a vibe and atmosphere that is a little different than your usual hotel convention space.  Because itâ€™s a little different, attending WACcon is something special. You join an elite group for an experience unlike any other. You come as acquaintances; you leave as brothers.  In January 2014 we will raise a glass to that bond.</p>
<p><b>Diplomacy</b> and a celebration of WACcon will begin on Thursday, January 23 with a roast/remembrance dinner. We will tell war stories, roast our friends, and savor the memories. The floor will be yielded to all those wishing to share their favorite moments.  Bring a speech, as everyone will have a chance to share their thoughts and memories.  We are estimating that this will run about $50 a person to attend.  Four rounds of <b>Diplomacy</b> beginning on Friday, January 24 and concluding with an awards ceremony on Sunday the 26th.</p>
<p>This is not an optional event. We will see you in January 2014.</p>
