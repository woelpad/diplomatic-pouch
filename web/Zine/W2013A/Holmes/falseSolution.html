Alone in the library of the Calhamer Club, I spent eighty minutes lost in
thought, devoted to my vain attempt to resolve what I had come to think of
as <a href="/Zine/F2013R/Holmes/false.html">The Curious Case of the False Start</a>.
On the surface, it seemed a simple enough problem, set for the British Crown
by the deviously clever Sultan of Suwat. To obtain an extension on an
important mineral lease at the Port of Suwat, my friend Sherlock Holmes
had been asked to supply the solution to the following puzzle:
<i><blockquote><p align=justify>We are given a <b>Diplomacy</b> board set up with the pieces in their starting positions,
but we are told that despite this fact, the game has already begun. Further, we
are told that although no neutral supply centres have been captured and all of the
players' home centres are in their own possession, it is also true that no piece on
the board started the game in its current position. In short, each power has managed
to depart from &mdash; and then return to &mdash; its original board position, without having
any of its original units sitting on the spot where it started the game.
<!--
In addition,
two of the powers must accomplish the feat one game-year quicker than the other five.
-->
</i>
<p align=justify>
<i>The problem is to determine how quickly this rearrangement of pieces can take place.
Not only that, but
<u>the Sultan required that the number of dislodgements be maximized,</u>
and that
to ensure that the mystery was properly solved, the number of dislodgements should be
brought by royal messenger to him. As if this was not enough, the Sultan's location
(where he was waiting to receive this dispatch) was also left unspecified, except to
say that the Sultan awaits the royal courier at the location into which the single
unit that retreated in the puzzle withdrew after having been dislodged.</i></blockquote>
<p align=justify>
Before Holmes stepped away to dine with an acquaintance, leaving me in my puzzled
state staring at the <b>Diplomacy</b> board, I had discussed the problem with my friend,
exhausting all of the "trick question" possibilities. I was told that (far from
being a variant game in which pieces do not begin the game in their usual location)
the game is standard in every way. I also learned that the resolution to the problem
did not revolve around the fact that the pieces had been accidentally or intentionally
removed from the board, and simply replaced with different pieces of wood.
<p align=justify>
When Holmes returned to the game room, I was quite pleased with my efforts. "Holmes,"
said I, "I am happy to report to you that I have made significant progress toward solving
the Sultan's puzzle."
<p align=justify>
"Indeed?" questioned Holmes. "Perhaps my continual urging to use your not inconsiderable
talents for deduction have not been wasted! Let us see what you have determined."
<p align=justify>
With some measure of pride, I began. "I am fairly certain that the feat can be accomplished
in a mere four movement phases. That is, a game could in fact be beginning 1903 with the
positional and centre ownership situations identical to those as at the start of the game,
but with the pieces in each position different from those that began the game there."
<p align=justify>
"Excellent," cried Holmes. "You are precisely correct. I admit, Watson, that I was slightly
concerned for you after your initial ruminations had you sailing the Russian fleets all the
way from one port to the other."
<p align=justify>
I flushed a bit at the recollection. My first thoughts had indeed concerned the lengthy
trip that the two Russian fleets would need to make to dock themselves each in the other's
port. With a twinkle in his eye, Holmes had left to take his sustenance while I was busily
counting the length of time that would be required for a Sevastopol to St. Petersburg sail.
<p align=justify>
"Yes, Holmes," I responded. "I quickly realized that the task of rearranging the pieces
could be done much quicker by cooperative action with foreign units. I reasoned that by
dislodging the two fleets and rebuilding them with new fleets, the problem's central
requirement (that the pieces on the board would be different from those that started the
game there) would be fairly met."
<p align=justify>
"Quite so, Watson, and indeed dislodgements are the key to every facet of the solution to
this fascinating puzzle."
<p align=justify>
"So I realized, Holmes, and I admit that it was with some measure of self-satisfaction that
I have spent the past hour or more trying my level best to quickly return the board to its
starting position &mdash; but with different pieces at each location &mdash; without taking possession
of any neutral centres and while dislodging as many pieces as possible. It was while doing
this that I realized with surprise that the task can be completed in a mere two game-years."
<p align=justify>
Holmes picked up from here. "Surprise, Watson? Surely it is more than obvious that it can
be accomplished for any single power in two game-years."
<p align=justify>
"True, Holmes, but I admit I was astonished to find that all of the powers can do so in
the same timeframe simultaneously."
<p align=justify>
"Indeed they can, Watson. In fact, as is easily seen, some powers can do it in half that time,
finishing the task in only one game-year, although it is not a stipulation of the puzzle that any
of the powers in fact do so."
<p align=justify>
"Yes, Holmes. France, for example, can arrange to have its fleet dislodged by an English
attack into the Channel in Fall of 1901 and rebuild the lost fleet in the coming Winter
adjustments phase, while having moved his Marseilles army to Paris and vice-versa."
<p align=justify>
"Correct, Watson. Like France, Austria, Russia, and Turkey can (with assistance) also accomplish
the feat in a single year, by simply swapping the positions of their two armies while
suffering the Falltime dislodgement of their fleet or fleets. As with France, the key, of
course, is that the dislodged fleet is removed and then rebuilt, rather than retreated.
<p align=justify>
"Since the English army and the German and Italian fleets cannot possibly be dislodged
and disbanded (and then rebuilt) in the first game-year, these three powers require two
game-years to accomplish a rearrangement."
<p align=justify>
The great detective then concluded his lucid restatement of the task. "The ability of those four powers to accomplish the task in a single year
is, of course, interesting, though not of consequence to us, as our task remains
simply
<!--
Recalling that two
of the four powers that can do so &mdash; France, Russia, Austria, and Turkey &mdash; do indeed find
their pieces thus rearranged after only one game-year, the task is
-->
to accomplish it for all
powers within the minimum time, which as you have found is two
game-years, while maximizing the number of dislodgements."
<p align=justify>
"Yes, Holmes, and to this end, I have devoted the past hour to rather gleefully dislodging
as many units as I could while recreating the game's starting position within the span of
two years."
<p align=justify>
"Excellent, Watson, and to what conclusion have you come as to the number of dislodgements
and the Sultan's location?"
<p align=justify>
"I am afraid, Holmes, that I remain a trifle confounded regarding those details. I have
determined that a total of nine dislodgements can be made, but as to which single unit
must have been retreated rather than disbanded, and the location into which the retreat
must have been made, I am in a quandary. I fear that my nine dislodgements must simply be
incorrect, for I am unable to determine from them where the Sultan awaits."
<p align=justify>
"Nine dislodgements is a fair attempt, Watson, and you are to be commended. You are correct,
however, that a greater number is possible and until you discover those that you have thus
far missed, the Sultan's location shall remain hidden to you."
<p align=justify>
"I regret, then, Holmes, that I feel I must request your assistance. I have been dislodging
units willy-nilly throughout your luncheon, and despite being fairly sure in the knowledge
(that you have just confirmed for me) that it must be possible &mdash; as I have begun to say &mdash;
to 'squeeze' more dislodgements into the two game-years, I have been unable to better my total
of nine."
<p align=justify>
"Right, then, Watson," said my friend, checking his pocket-watch. "Although my potted ferns
will require their care before long, I believe that we have time for an illustration of the
solution." With that, Holmes sat with me at the <b>Diplomacy</b> board, restored it to the starting
position, and addressed me.
<p align=justify>
"Let us begin, of course, with the Spring 1901 moves. As you may have realized, the key
moves of the solution will take place at the crossroads of Europe."
At this point he pulled the Russian fleet on St. Petersburg's south coast to
Livonia, the German fleet in Kiel into the Baltic Sea, and the Berlin army
to Prussia,
putting beyond doubt the short-lived fate of Russia's Northern
fleet.  He then
pushed the Budapest army into Galicia and the Warsaw army into Silesia, where it found itself surrounded by red and black armies, when (rather
to my surprise) he
advanced the Munich army northeast into Berlin.
</p>
<p align="justify">
I had indeed determined that maximizing the number of
dislodgements involved rushing the armies on the board toward each other. It seemed to me,
and now it stood confirmed by Holmes, that the proximity of the German, Austrian, and Russian
armies must be put to good use.
However, while I was sure in the knowledge that the Bavarian army, being so centrally
located at the start, would play a significant
role, I wondered why Holmes would have chosen to concentrate the action where
he did, putting the Munich army into Berlin, when
he could just as well have let units congregate on Warsaw, Galicia, or,
in cooperation with Vienna or Venice, on that very magnet of the board where it
begins the game, Munich.
I chose to stay silent at this time, and not reveal that this was where my thoughts had been attracted to for most of the evening.
</p>
<p align=justify>
"We have but two game-years to replace the Turkish fleet and
Russia's southern fleets by dislodging and rebuilding them.
Obviously, then,
<!--
"We have already discussed the fact that four powers can &mdash; and two powers must &mdash; accomplish
what is required of them in a single year. Obviously, the pair cannot be Russia and Turkey,
as
-->
only one of the Sevastopol and Ankara fleets can be dislodged in 1901."
<!--
As it happens, only
France and Turkey may indeed rearrange their pieces in a single year while serving the
requirement that the maximum number of dislodgements occur in the two game-years we have
before us."
-->
Holmes moved the Turkish fleet to Armenia, the Sevastopol fleet into the Black Sea,
the Moscow army to Sevastopol (both in preparation for a Falltime dislodgement of the Turkish fleet), and moved the Turkish armies into a position to allow them to end the first game-year in each other's original location, sending Constantinople to the vacated Ankara, and Smyrna into Constantinople. Turning his attention to the west, Holmes moved the French fleet from Brest to the
English Channel, and to prepare a Falltime dislodgement of that fleet, Holmes then moved the English fleet from Edinburgh into the North Sea for
cooperative action with London.
<p align=justify>
As if I should know his reasons, Holmes quickly moved the Italian
units from Venice to Rome, from Rome to Tuscany, fleet Naples to
Apulia, and the Austrian
army from Vienna to Tyrolia and the Austrian fleet into Venice.
My friend proceeded to finish with the French turn by pushing
Paris to Burgundy and, to my surprise, Marseilles to Piedmont.
<p align=justify>
Taking all this in, I felt obliged to contribute something at this point. "I find your opening curious, Holmes.
Most strange to me is your moving the Marseilles army to
Piedmont.  I had not considered such a thing and while I see that
it masses a great many units together, the easy road to Paris
through Gascony,
to achieve the exchange of places of the two French armies, seemed
far too obvious to avoid.  Are you quite sure of your footing here?
As you had mentioned to me, one of the powers meets the conditions
a year early, and what you are proposing with Piedmont seemingly
makes it impossible for France to do so....unless &mdash; I see! you
intend to dislodge that army and rebuild it in Paris, with Burgundy
moving to Marseilles to complete the French swap in the single year with
one more dislodgement than I had divined!  Brilliant!"
<!--
From this position, only Turkey will be able to accomplish the feat in a single year, for
unless the French fleet is dislodged from the English Channel and not Picardy (as you would
have it here), with the German army opening to Burgundy, the French armies cannot possibly
exchange their positions in 1901. To send each French army to the other's location in a
single year will require the two to travel in the first game-turn to Gascony and to Burgundy.
Your proposed German invasion of Burgundy would prevent this!"
-->
<p align=justify>
Holmes smiled. "Some but not all of that is indeed my intention,
Watson.  And yes, I believe we have found what may be the first of the dislodgements you
overlooked."

<b>Spring 1901 Movement Phase</b>
</center>
<p align=justify>
"We have now created the game position going into Fall of 1901, Watson.
Obviously, as with every standard game, no dislodgements have yet occurred.
They will, however, begin to come quickly as we progress toward the
solution."
<p align=justify>
"I can see that, Holmes. Here in the first Fall phase, you have managed to
set up many units for destruction. The French fleet in the English Channel,
the Turkish fleet in Armenia, the French army in Piedmont, the Russian army
in Silesia, the Austrian fleet in Venice and the Russian fleet in Livonia
are all vulnerable to attacks having the strength to dislodge."
<!--      			<p align=justify>
[Seventh dislodgement?] -->
<p align=justify>
"Well done, Watson. Indeed, each of these dislodgements does transpire.
Attend while we step through the Fall turn. As you recounted, the French
army in Piedmont is dislodged by an Austrian attack from Tyrolia, supported
by the Italian army in Tuscany."
<p align=justify>
"Could it have been otherwise, Holmes? That is, could Italy have made the
attack supported by Austria instead?"
<p align=justify>
"Perhaps so, Watson, but taking account of the geography in this part of
the board, seeing as how only armies are involved here, and because
Piedmont is not a supply centre, it matters not in this case. In other
situations, however, the manner in which the units are dislodged is quite
important to the solution. If the wrong unit is moved, the number of
possible dislodgements is reduced."
<p align=justify>
Taking this as his lead, he then dislodged the French fleet by moving the
English fleet from the North Sea, indicating that it was given support from
the fleet in London.
<p align=justify>
"An amusing opening, Holmes. The normal move to develop the English
position would be for North Sea to support London into the Channel. Why
would you choose such a hideously compact form?"
<p align=justify>
"Foresight, my dear Watson. Knowing how the English army will
be replaced, the choice should be obvious, no?"
<p align=justify>
I did not admit to the great
detective that the question of the lone English army had stumped me before.
It could not be swapped, so either would have to be dislodged or disbanded in
Winter if a home centre were taken, something that was unlikely to happen
now. But on the where and how, I was completely in the dark.
<p align=justify>
Holmes appeared to take no notice of my discomfort, as he pushed the
Italian fleet from Apulia into Venice, indicating that it was supported in
this move by the army in Rome, and in this way dislodging the Austrian
fleet. This I could understand, as it put the Italian fleet immediately in
peril from an attack by the Austrian army in Piedmont and a rebuilt
Austrian fleet in Trieste. Furthermore the Italian armies would have no
difficulty swapping positions, as Venice had already moved to Rome and the
army in Tuscany was next to Venice.
<p align=justify>
Encouraged by this, I held out my hand to stop Holmes from picking up
the next piece. "Allow me." The Turkish fleet in Armenia could either be
dislodged by the Russian fleet in the Black Sea or the Russian army in
Sevastopol. As in the previous case I reasoned that the fleet would need to
be set up for a future dislodgement, but the army, which had started in
Moscow, could end in Warsaw only if it stayed in Sevastopol this turn.
Unhesitatingly I therefore attacked the Turkish fleet with the Russian
fleet from the Black Sea, making the army in Sevastopol support the attack.
<p align=justify>
Before Holmes could comment I briskly tapped the army in Silesia, gesturing
for a moment of thought. Either Galicia or Berlin could dislodge it. But if
the attack came from Berlin, that army could just as well have held in
Munich, as both spaces border Silesia. Knowing my friend's penchant for
avoiding meaningless moves I concluded that Berlin was there to support, so I
dislodged with the Austrian unit from Galicia instead. Observing this, Holmes
seemed to relax as he took out his pipe and started to relight it.
<p align=justify>
For the Russian fleet in Livonia I had again a choice between the German
fleet in the Baltic Sea and army Prussia. Applying the same logic as for
Armenia I moved the fleet to Livonia supported by the army, as Prussia was
only two moves away from Munich. While taking the Russian fleet off the
board, I considered its options. The Prussian army could move either back
through Berlin or through Silesia. Both spaces were occupied, Berlin by the
second German army, Silesia by the Austrian army having just dislodged the
Russian army there. Berlin would be able to support Prussia to Silesia, and
again to Munich if an army would be waiting there. But what army? Tyrolia
had just moved away to Piedmont and the French army in Burgundy was heading
to Marseilles in order to complete the replacement in one year.
<p align=justify>
As I thoughtfully executed the move to Marseilles, I looked again at
Silesia and the pieces taken off the board. And then it struck me! Barely
hiding my excitement I picked up the discarded Russian army, placing it
squarely in the centre of the board while triumphantly proclaiming: "It
appears to me, Holmes, that you have informed the government to send a courier to
Munich, where the Sultan will be waiting for him in
anticipation!"

</center>
<p align=justify>
"Not unless I wanted the mission to fail," Holmes said shaking his head. "Did I not tell you that no centre
would change hands at any time?"
<p align=justify>
"But that was not a criterion of the puzzle," I protested, before
continuing in good stride: "Munich will be recaptured by Germany when
Prussia moves through Silesia towards Munich, dislodging armies on every
step and aided in this by the army in Berlin. As Prussia started in Berlin
and Berlin in Munich, the end situation will have them swapped. Furthermore
the temporary capture of Munich allows the disband of the German fleet,
which can be rebuilt a year later when Munich is recaptured. Surely this much progress cannot
be improved upon?"
<p align=justify>
Almost immediately I started to regret what I had just said. The great
detective, with a bemused expression on his face, continued his attempts to
relight his pipe before commenting: "Watson, you did an excellent job
lining out the path that the German army in Prussia will be taking to
arrive at the Bavarian heimat. However in your haste to get there, you
missed a few opportunities to increase the number of dislodgements. Take
this German fleet. Instead of disbanding, it would be more profitable if it
could be dislodged, no?"
<p align=justify>
"Perhaps so, but it's stranded in the middle of nowhere with no enemy units in
sight."
<p align=justify>
"They can be built. Tell me how many Russian units were dislodged."
<p align=justify>
"Well, Livonia of course, and Silesia. Ah, and no home centres lost. So
Russia is entitled to two builds. The fleet in St. Petersburg and either
Moscow or Warsaw, all border Livonia. So that's how you plan to dislodge
the German fleet!"
<p align=justify>
"We have thus proven that there's no need to capture a home centre, that it
even would prove to be counterproductive to do so." And with that Holmes
picked up the Russian army in Munich and tossed it back in the box.
<p align=justify>
"But then there will be no unit in Munich to dislodge when the army from
Prussia arrives there?"
<p align=justify>
"All in its own time. That army will only arrive in the Falltime, giving us
one more season to station a victim there."
<p align=justify>
To my astonishment he then pushed the French army back to Burgundy.
<p align=justify>
"Holmes, wait, you said that one power would accomplish the feat in one year.
If not France, then who?"
<p align=justify>
"I believe you overlooked this move," said Holmes, as he pushed the Turkish
army in Ankara to Smyrna. "We have thus swapped the Turkish armies and are
able to rebuild the dislodged fleet in its original home centre, all in the
first year. Speaking of which, that Russian fleet could better stay in the
Black Sea."
<p align=justify>
He moved the Russian fleet back and put the army from Sevastopol in its
place.
<p align=justify>
"Really?" I exclaimed. "But then the army can't move back to Warsaw? You
would need to dislodge them both!"
<p align=justify>
Holmes mysteriously pointed to the open space in Ankara. "See here the lion's den."

<p align=justify>
Smiling, he added: "We have now established the complete Fall 1901 season,
and can move on to the Winter adjustments."
<p align=justify>
"Well, if there are no Fall retreats, ..." I said, leaving a small pause, but
to my disappointment Holmes didn't interrupt. Vowing to do better in the
second year I continued: "... the adjustments will hold no surprises. All the
dislodged fleets are undoubtedly rebuilt in their starting centres."
<p align=justify>
I took up the discarded fleets and placed them back on the board, the
Austrian in Trieste, the French in Brest, the Turkish in Ankara and the
Russian on the south coast of St. Petersburg. "As for the armies, if you
would do the honors?"
<p align=justify>
That was a smart move. With the French army holding in Burgundy France had
two open build locations for its army, while Russia even had three. Of course in order
to dislodge the German fleet Sevastopol would be of little use, but Warsaw
and Moscow were equally eligible. It might not matter, but I had a feeling
that Holmes still had something up his sleeve.
<p align=justify>
Holmes complied in good humor and unhesitatingly placed an army in Paris.
Of course, the English army! To get rid of it Holmes was planning to convoy
it to Picardy where it would be surrounded by the complete French military
might!
<p align=justify>
Imitating the way he had referred to Ankara as the lion's den I pointed to
the empty space of Picardy and said: "The pirate's cove." I laughed
heartily at my own joke, but Holmes only frowned. "Picardy, Pirate's Cove.
Pirate's Cove, Picardy. It's a wordplay!" I cried.
<p align=justify>
"I see, " Holmes replied and nodded. Then turning his attention to Russia
he picked up the fleet I had placed in St. Petersburg, studied it for a
moment, then said: "Undoubtedly this will come to you as a surprise, but it
shouldn't. One should always take all possibilities into consideration. In
this case the fleet is of limited help."
<p align=justify>
Putting the fleet aside he took two armies and placed them in Warsaw and
Moscow.
<p align=justify>
"But then Russia will be lacking a fleet?"
<p align=justify>
"There's no condition that the same combination of units should exist
throughout the game. To satisfy the condition of returning to the initial
situation, it is sufficient to build the fleet at the end of the final year,
which we are now ready to engage."

<b>Winter 1901 Adjustment Phase</b>
</center>
<p align=justify>
Holmes started off by moving the Austrian army from Piedmont to Venice
indicating support from the fleet in Trieste to dislodge the Italian fleet
stationed there. As if to further illustrate his previous point he remarked: "Observe how
even this fleet could have been an army. In Fall, as the Italian army in Tuscany mounts an attack on Venice with Roman support, it
relocates to Vienna or Budapest, allowing the dislodged army from Venice to
be rebuilt as a fleet. But as this variation does not alter the result we
will let it stand as is."
<p align=justify>
Turning his attention to the West he asked: "I believe you have
discovered the reason for moving North Sea to the Channel?"
<p align=justify>
Eagerly I replied: "Indeed I have. The fleet in the Channel is needed to
convoy the English army to the continent in Spring. In Fall it has to move
to London, as that is the only English home centre bordering the Channel.
Meanwhile London must move to Edinburgh, either through Yorkshire or the
North Sea, to complete the fleet swap. If London would have moved to the
Channel first, it wouldn't have been able to reach Edinburgh in time."
<p align=justify>
I moved the fleet from London to Yorkshire, then picked up the army in
Wales and dropped it in Picardy, saying: "As to the destination of the
convoy, it must be here, the pirate's cove!"
<p align=justify>
"Very well. Except that the true pirate's cove is not Picardy,"
said Holmes dryly, making the army trade places with the French fleet in
Brest, "... but Brest. The reason is elementary, my dear Watson. If the English army were
to be sent to Picardy, France would need to dislodge it there and would end
up with a unit outside its home centres at the end of 1902. It is therefore
that any unit dislodged in the final movement turn must be in a home centre
belonging to the attacking power. The only exception is if that power is
allowed to disband units in Winter after losing centres, something which is
not the case here as no power has gained or lost any centres."
<p align=justify>
I had to admit that what he said made sense. "I can see that now. And Ankara fits the requirement, that's why you called
it the lion's den. After the Turkish fleet moves out to dislodge the
Russian army in Armenia with support from Smyrna, the Russian fleet in
Black Sea can move in from behind. Turkey then simply needs to reverse its
action to dislodge the Russian fleet in Ankara. It's as if it had
unwittingly entered the lion's den only to be devoured when the animals
return."
<p align=justify>
Executing the Turkish-Russian moves, Holmes smiled. "You're becoming
poetic, Watson. To finish the puzzle only one part is left."
<p align=justify>
"But we have still not discovered the whereabouts of the Sultan. Now,
Holmes, I have given this some thought. You might accuse me for being
incorrigible, but if it's not the Russian army last turn, it must be the
Austrian army this turn. Dislodged by Prussia
with support from Berlin, it will retreat forward to Munich only to be
dislodged once again by the same two armies. The Sultan must be in Munich
after all!"
<p align=justify>
"As close as we have come to solving the riddle, it pains me nonetheless,
Watson, to see that you have not yet understood the significance of the
French army in Burgundy and the second Russian army build. A forward
retreat, that cherished tactic in the arsenal of the offensive player, seeks
out the best place to retreat only after all moves have been executed. As
Silesia gets dislodged in the manner described, let Burgundy move to Munich
and Warsaw dislodge the German fleet in Livonia supported by Moscow."
<p align=justify>
Executing the moves, Holmes held up the dislodged Austrian army, then
firmly planted it in the vacated Russian home centre, saying: "Now here is where the Sultan is
located. Instead of a single dislodgement, we have two, Munich and
Warsaw. Had we built a fleet, we would have been unable to attack or
support an attack on Warsaw, as Warsaw has no coastline. Quite elementary,
Watson."

<b>Spring 1902 Movement Phase, with Retreats</b>

<p align=justify>
I sat stunned at the unassailable logic and beauty of my friend's reasoning.
Holmes looked quizzically at me, then back at the board. Suddenly he stood up
and paced to the lobby, where he had a short conversion with the desk clerk.
<p align=justify>
Clearly pleased with himself, he returned to his chair and sat down.
Perplexed I asked: "Will you tell me what the sudden rush was?"
<p align=justify>
"With pleasure. I asked the clerk to transmit a message from me to the Foreign Office.
It's an invitation to the Sultan of Suwat to visit London with excursions to
Wales and the Channel islands. If they hurry, they can still wire the courier
and let him deliver it to the Sultan along with the answer."
<p align=justify>
"For what purpose?"
<p align=justify>
"An innocent quid pro quo. Now, to return to the board, ..." said Holmes,
indicating he considered the subject closed. "At this
point, Watson, it should have become clear how many dislodgements transpired."
<p align=justify>
Obediently I started to count. "There were
six in the first Fall season. In Spring I count four: Venice, Armenia, Silesia
and Livonia. As for the second Fall season, let me see."
<p align=justify>
One after one I executed the final dislodgements: Picardy to Brest with
support from Paris, dislodging the English army; Tuscany to Venice with
support from Rome, dislodging the Austrian army; Armenia to Ankara with
support from Smyrna, dislodging the Russian fleet; Silesia to Munich with
support from Berlin, dislodging the French army; and Livonia to Warsaw with
support from Moscow, dislodging the second Austrian army after it had
retreated there. I also moved the English fleets from the Channel to London
and from Yorkshire to Edinburgh.
<p align=justify>
Having done that, I announced: "And five in
Fall 1902 for a grand total of fifteen. That's just fabulous, Holmes! Nearly two
thirds of the starting units have been dislodged in a mere two years, one
even twice, without ever increasing the unit tally as no neutral centres
were captured. That's an average of five dislodgements per season!"

<p align=justify>
Holmes tapped his pipe to empty it.
"I will agree with you that it is quite a marvel. Did you notice that the eight
units that were never disbanded belong to a mere four powers? These four
powers only had to replace the unit of which they only held one, while the
other three ended up replacing every one of their units."
<p align=justify>
"You mean it is possible to divide the powers in two camps, those that lost
all their starting units and those that kept their identical units by
swapping them around? That's astonishing."
<p align=justify>
"In fact, there are many more remarkable facts about this solution. But let
us first complete the circle by rebuilding all missing units."
<p align=justify>
And with that he placed one French, one English and two Austrian armies,
and furthermore one German, one Italian and two Russian fleets in their
respective home centres, restoring completely the starting position.
<p align=justify>
"How remarkable indeed," I marveled. "An equal number of armies and fleets
respectively built by an equal number of powers. What a perfect
equilibrium."

<b>Winter 1902 Adjustment Phase</b>
</center>
<!--
<h3>2013 EDITING ENDS HERE</h3>
At this point, Holmes moved the Parisian army to Gascony (which was not
unexpected by me), and then quickly made the following moves: the French army from Marseilles
was pushed into Piedmont, the Italian armies were rearranged such that Rome was moved to
Tuscany and Venice into Rome, and the Austrian army from Vienna was sent into Tyrolia. I saw
at once that the French unit in Piedmont could be a Falltime victim of an Austro-Italian attack
from Tyrolia and Tuscany. Of course! This dislodged French army could then be removed, and a
new one built at Paris. With the army that was originally in Paris making its easy unobstructed
journey <i>via</i> Gascony to Marseilles, France would still fulfill the requirements of the puzzle
in a single game-year.
<p align=justify>
Before proceeding, Holmes made one more move that surprised me, casually moving the English
army from Liverpool into Wales. At the time, I thought it of no importance, and allowed it to
pass without comment.
<p align=justify>
Satisfied that I had understood the situation in Piedmont and how that not only provided
another dislodgement but allowed France to be completely restored to its original position
but with different units by the end of the first game-year, Holmes continued. "Surely, Watson,
you progressed far enough to conclude that the proximity of Venice and Trieste is of great
advantage to us." Holmes moved the Austrian fleet into the vacated Venice, and the Italian
fleet from Naples into Apulia.
<p align=justify>
At this point, Holmes had illustrated all of the Austrian, Italian, French, Turkish, and
Russian moves (for he had indicated that both Warsaw and St. Petersburg held in the first turn)
for Spring of 1901. He finished creating the position for Fall 1901 by moving the German fleet
and the second English fleet. Remarking that "like the army we have moved from Smyrna to
Constantinople, some units can simply move directly to take up residence at their similar
unit's starting location," Holmes moved the Edinburgh fleet to Yorkshire, its obvious final
destination being London. Turning to the German fleet, he sent it into the Helgoland Bight,
a rather curious opening for that unit and one that I had not considered for it. Asked about
it, Holmes smiled and said simply, "Other choices are possible, of course, but why should we
occupy any neutral supply centres at all, even in a Spring turn?"
<p align=justify>
"We have now created the game position going into Fall of 1901, Watson. Obviously, as with
every standard game, no dislodgements have yet occurred. They will, however, begin to come
quickly as we progress toward the solution."
<p align=justify>
"I can see that, Holmes. Here in the first Fall phase, you have managed to set up many units
for destruction. The French fleet in Picardy, the Turkish fleet in Armenia, the French army
in Piedmont, the Russian army in Warsaw, and the Austrian fleet in Venice are all vulnerable
to attacks having the strength to dislodge."
<p align=justify>
"Well done, Watson. Indeed, each of these dislodgements does transpire. Attend while
we step through the Fall turn. As you recounted, the French army in Piedmont is dislodged by
an Italian attack from Tuscany, supported by the Austrian army in Vienna."
<p align=justify>
"Could it have been otherwise, Holmes? That is, could Austria have made the attack supported by
Italy instead?"
<p align=justify>
"Perhaps so, Watson, but taking account of the geography in this part of the board, seeing as
how only armies are involved here, and because Piedmont is not a supply centre, it matters not
in this case. In other situations, however, the manner in which the units are dislodged is
quite important to the solution. If the wrong unit is moved, the number of possible
dislodgements is reduced." Taking this as his lead, Holmes dislodged the Turkish fleet by
moving the Russian fleet from the Black Sea, indicating that it was given support from the army
in Sevastopol. He then pushed the Italian fleet from Apulia into Venice, indicating that it
was supported in this move by the army in Rome, and in this way dislodging the Austrian fleet.
<p align=justify>
Next, Holmes caused the French fleet in Picardy to be dislodged by the English army, convoyed
from Wales by the Channel fleet, and supported in its landing by the German army in Burgundy.
I had not considered this possibility, but almost at once I saw the significance. "Beautiful,
Holmes! I now see the solution to what I had found to be one of the most troublesome areas of
the puzzle, the problem of how to replace the lone English army with a new and different
English army! After the French fleet is rebuilt in Winter of 1901, the English army you just
landed at Picardy is immediately in peril and can be dislodged and removed from the board!"
<p align=justify>
"Quite correct, Watson. I had assumed you had already discovered this when you said that it
was apparent to you that the feat could be done in two game-years." A bit ashamed, I did
not admit to the great detective that I had leapt to an early conclusion on this point.
<p align=justify>
Completing the fifth and final dislodgement of Fall 1901, Holmes sent the Austrian army from
Galicia into Warsaw, indicating a support from the German army in Silesia. I began to protest
what seemed to be an unwarranted assumption, but then, remembering what Holmes had said about
the importance of moving and supporting with the proper unit, I did not query my friend as
to whether the move could alternatively have been made by Germany with Austrian support.
<p align=justify>
"Now, Watson, we have five dislodged units, but before we address the retreat phase, allow me
to finish the Fall movement phase by completing the journey of a few pieces." Holmes moved
the English fleet from Yorkshire to London, the French army from Gascony to Marseilles, and
the Turkish army from Ankara to Smyrna. "Other than this," &mdash; Holmes dramatically pushed the
German fleet from out of the Helgoland Bight into the North Sea &mdash; "all the other units held,
and we thus have completed the Fall movement phase."
<p align=justify>
<p align=justify>
Pausing only a moment to admire his handiwork, Holmes pushed on. "We can now concentrate on
the fate of the five units we have dislodged."
<p align=justify>
I hoped that Holmes did not see the surprise that certainly showed on my face when he made
the final fleet move, and partly to cover this surprise, I decided to contribute at this point.
"The fates of these dislodged units are clear, Holmes. In order to allow the powers to rebuild
new units (to, in this way, help fulfill the requirement that different units than those which
began the game at each position are in place there at the conclusion of the puzzle), the
units must be removed rather than retreated."
<p align=justify>
"That is true of most of the dislodged units, Watson, but is not the case for all of them. You
are quite correct that all three of the dislodged fleets must be removed from the board, as
each of these powers began the game with but a single fleet, and this is the chance to exchange
that for a new one, to be built in the same location." Holmes removed the Turkish fleet from
Armenia, the French fleet from Picardy, and the Austrian fleet from Venice.
<p align=justify>
"It is also the case that the dislodged French army must be removed &mdash; indeed, because Gascony
moved to Marseilles, no valid retreats exist for the dislodged unit regardless!" Holmes removed
the French army from Piedmont.
<p align=justify>
"However," Holmes quickly continued, "the Russian army that was just dislodged from Warsaw
is another matter. That unit cannot be voluntarily disbanded. It simply must retreat, and it
must retreat to Moscow."
<p align=justify>
"Why is this, Holmes?" I asked, completely astounded by what seemed to be an unwarranted leap
in logic. "Why not remove the army and rebuild it in Moscow for the same effect?"
<p align=justify>
"This cannot be done, and the reason is elementary, Watson. Consider what has happened to the
Russian player's home centres. He has suffered one of them &mdash; Warsaw &mdash; to be captured by a
foreign power, so Russia is now left in possession of only three of his four home centres.
If Russia chooses to remove the dislodged Warsaw army, he would be left with three units
on the board. Thus, he would become ineligible to issue any orders in the upcoming adjustment
phase."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I finished the thought. "Of course! If he disbands the army,
his loss of Warsaw means that he could not rebuild it in Moscow
after all!"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Yes, but even more important, Watson, he simply could not take advantage of the opportunity
to remove one of his troublesome fleets!"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Brilliant, Holmes! I see now the importance of retreating and not removing that army!
Further, with Moscow being the destination of the retreating army, I now see that the Sultan
must be awaiting His Majesty's courier in the city of Moscow!" After a moment's thought,
spent by a very satisfied-looking Holmes in the effort of relighting his pipe, I realized
that Holmes still had not justified his conclusions to me. "Why Moscow, Holmes? Could not the
Sultan be in Prussia or Livonia or the Ukraine? It seems to me that the dislodged army could
just as easily have retreated to any of those locations as well!"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
Holmes chose not to respond, and continued, with a bemused expression on his face, his
efforts to relight his pipe.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
After another second, I felt compelled to amend my declaration. "In fact, Holmes, even
Silesia could be the retreat location! I don't see any reason why the German army from
Berlin was forced to open to Silesia rather than to Prussia."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
Holmes sucked on his pipe, reclining in the overstuffed chair. "You are quite right,
Watson, that the German army could have made its first move into Silesia. Be it Prussia
or Silesia, whichever of these was occupied by the Berlin army after Spring of 1901 is
of no consequence, but the dislodged Russian army definitely retreated to Moscow."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"How can you know this, Holmes?" I asked.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Remember always, Watson, the requirement to maximize the number of dislodgements that
will occur during the four moves making up the puzzle's solution. As we shall see, that
Russian army will be so busy in 1902 that it is simply impossible for it to begin the
year anywhere other than Moscow." For the moment, I accepted this, but it was only with
a skeptical look on my face that I retreated the dislodged Russian unit into Moscow.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
<p align=justify>
<!br>
Holmes began again. "Before getting to 1902, however, shall we now consider the adjustments of
1901?"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I nodded my assent and Holmes continued. "Both France and Turkey, still in possession of all
three of their home centres, and having taken no foreign centres, are eligible to control three
units and thus they rebuild in Winter of 1901, restoring these powers to their original position
but with different units than those that began the game at each location. Holmes pulled a
Turkish fleet from the box and positioned it in Ankara, and similarly put a French fleet
onto Brest and a French army in Paris.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Austria finished the year in possession of his home centres and having taken Warsaw. Having
voluntarily disbanded his dislodged fleet, Austria is thus eligible at the end of 1901 to make
two builds." My friend then placed a new Austrian fleet in Trieste, and a new Austrian army
in Budapest.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"England, Germany, and Italy, of course, suffered no dislodgements, and neither captured nor
lost any supply centres. Thus, these three powers have no adjustment orders to issue. That
leaves only Russia. As we've determined, Russia retreated his dislodged army rather than
disband it. This leaves him with four units but only in possession of three centres. He
can now remove one of his two fleets. The question as to which fleet should be removed is
elementary to answer, is it not, Watson?"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I was prepared. "Russia must remove St. Petersburg, Holmes. Without doing so, that unit cannot
possibly be taken off the board before the end of 1902 and still allow all foreign units to
take up positions in home centres. The best we could do is have Germany dislodge it from
Livonia in Fall, but this would leave Germany unable to return his attacking unit to Berlin,
Kiel, or Munich."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
After a pause, I added, "However, Holmes, I do not see why that fleet elected to hold in Spring
of 1901. It could be in Livonia or the Gulf of Bothnia or even further west by now, could it
not? If it were, could it not be just as eligible to be chosen to remain on the board through
the adjustments phase? After all, the southern fleet, having successfully dislodged the Turk
from Armenia is itself an obvious candidate for dislodgement by Turkish units in Spring of 1902,
and can in this way be removed in 1902 instead."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"No, Watson; this could not be done without adversely affecting the total number of
dislodgements. As I said, the units along the steppes of Russia and Poland will be far too
busy to assist in removing Russia's northern fleet through dislodgement. It simply must be the
case that the St Petersburg fleet &mdash; whether it has held (as we have postulated here) or moved
in the first game-year into Finland, Livonia, or elsewhere &mdash; is removed by Russia voluntarily
in the adjustment phase." Holmes picked up the fleet from St. Petersburg and casually tossed it
into the box.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Two moves down, with two to go, Holmes!" I said excitedly. "We have made only five dislodgements
so far, however. I admit I am anxious to learn how many more than the nine I discovered are to be
made."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Then let us proceed apace, Watson, to Spring of 1902. Remembering that paramount attention
must be paid to maximizing the number of dislodgements, what possible victim units have we
laid before us?"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
Looking at the board, I answered. "The Russian fleet in Armenia. That is a certainty. Turkey
will surely dislodge it and then in the Fall return to its assigned home centre whichever of
his two units advanced in the Spring into Armenia. After removing his dislodged southern fleet,
and coupled with the fact that we know Russia must recapture Warsaw this year, Russia will be
eligible to build not one but two new fleets to replace his original pair!"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Quite correct, Watson. Well done!" Holmes made the moves, showing that Turkey supported one
of his own units into Armenia in Spring of 1902, and the attacking unit then simply returned
to its earlier position in the next movement phase. Tossing the Russian fleet into the box,
Holmes remarked, "Just as you reasoned, Russia must voluntarily disband this dislodged fleet
and rebuild it as a new fleet."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I addressed the next candidate for dislodgement that I saw. "The English army must also be
dislodged from Picardy in the Spring, Holmes. Only in this way can the unit that attacked
it be able to reach its final position on a home centre after the Fall turn. The English
army is surrounded by the French in both Brest and Paris and the German in Burgundy, and
it is obviously doomed." Proud of myself, I reached for the English army, intending to remove
it from the board.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Tut tut, Watson," said Holmes, "You are right that the English army must be removed by force
of enemy arms, but it is not wise to do so yet. Indeed, if we did so, the lease held by the
Crown on the Port of Suwat would be just as 'doomed' as you accurately described that army.
The royal courier would be delivering the incorrect number of dislodgements to the Sultan in
Moscow, for we can obtain the correct maximum count only by allowing the English army to
survive the Spring."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I was taken aback by this. I had assumed that the puzzle was as good as solved, and that simply
taking advantage of every dislodgement available would lead to a successful resolution.
Studying the board, I haltingly began the correction of my mistake. "I believe I understand,
Holmes. There are two units in this area of the board that stand in peril. Picardy, yes, but
also Burgundy. It too is eligible to be dislodged. I see now that only one, and not both, of
these dislodgements can be made. It would seem that I made the wrong choice in Picardy."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Precisely, Watson. To maximize our dislodgement count, Burgundy must be attacked in the Spring,
and the English unit can meet a similar fate in the Fall."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"I would like to agree with you, Holmes, but I fail to see how the pieces of every player will
end 1902 on a home centre if the English army in Picardy is dislodged there on a Fall turn!"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"I never said, Watson, that the English army will be dislodged from Picardy." Holmes thereupon
moved Marseilles to Burgundy, indicating that it received support for this Spring move from
the newly-built army in Paris. Then he pushed the French fleet out of Brest and into Gascony,
while sliding the English army into the vacated Brest.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Of course, Holmes! In the Fall, the French fleet returns from Gascony to Brest, with the
support of the Parisian army! The other French army simply reoccupies Marseilles, and, as
our friends across the Channel say, '<i>voila!</i>'"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Exactly, Watson." Holmes made the moves, picked up both the dislodged units &mdash; the German army
from Burgundy, which was dislodged in the Spring, and the English army that was dislodged from
Brest in the Fall, and placed them into the box. "Both of these units, of course, were
voluntarily disbanded. We know this is true of the English army, for only by rebuilding
it can a new army be established at Liverpool. As for the German army dislodged during the
Spring turn, it is less clear. Certainly it could have been retreated to Munich, and then
spent the Fall turn in moving to Berlin, where it would fulfill the requirements of the
Sultan's puzzle. However, remember that we have been told that only one unit availed itself
of its opportunity to retreat, and we have earlier proven conclusively that the Russian army
dislodged from Warsaw must have been that unit."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Yes, Holmes, but I still await your proof that Moscow must have been the destination of that
army's retreat."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
Holmes smiled. "Patience, Watson. First, let us attend to the other events of Spring 1902.
What more can we deduce?"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Well," I began, "in addition to his Burgundy army (the disposition of which we have already
determined), Germany stands vulnerable in the North Sea." After only a moment's thought,
I added, "Obviously, the Channel fleet attacks the North Sea (with support from London), and
can thereupon end 1902 by landing at Edinburgh, a new position for it."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Correct, Watson," said Holmes, executing the moves. Putting the German fleet into the box,
he said, "Again, the German fleet could only have been voluntarily disbanded, and of course,
Germany will clearly be eligible to rebuild it along with a new army to replace the one lost
in Burgundy."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I was anxious to get to Holmes's assertion that the Russian army must have retreated to Moscow,
but in scanning the board, I noticed one more detail west of the steppes. "The Italian fleet
in Venice is vulnerable to an Austrian attack, Holmes!" Remembering how Holmes had corrected
me a moment earlier concerning the fate of the English army, I quickly added, "This unit must
either be dislodged now, or must be sent into an Austrian centre &mdash; Trieste, obviously &mdash; for
dislodging in the Fall."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Quite accurate, Watson. Your skills continue to improve. In point of fact, it must be dislodged
now. Just as we saw in Picardy, there is but one way to maximize the final number of
dislodgements, and in this case, we can obtain two dislodgements rather than one by dislodging
Venice now." Holmes pushed the Austrian army from Tyrolia into Venice, indicating the
support it received from the Austrian fleet in Trieste, and then put the dislodged Italian
fleet into the box.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Yes, Holmes, I see now! In the Fall, the Austrian that took a position in Venice in the
Spring is dislodged by one of the two Italian armies &mdash; the one in Tuscany that started the
game in Rome &mdash; with support of the other army &mdash; the one now in Rome and which started the
game in Venice!" Pleased with myself, and the fact that Holmes did not interrupt or correct
me, I made the moves I described, and finished by saying, "Controlling his three home centres
only, then, at the end of 1902, Italy is eligible to rebuild the fleet he removed in the Spring,
establishing at Naples a fleet that did not begin the game there!"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Your logic is impeccable, Watson. As it stands, we have added to the five dislodgements that
were accomplished in 1901 by successful 1902 attacks on German units in the North Sea and
Burgundy, an English army in Brest, a Russian fleet in Armenia, and an Italian fleet and an
Austrian army, both in Venice."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"That's a total of eleven, Holmes! We have already bettered my effort and Russia has yet to
re-take Warsaw! The final total is therefore an even dozen, and I am once more impressed by
your skill, Holmes. Quite impressed indeed."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I continued headlong toward the solution. "Russia retakes Warsaw with support from the German
unit in Silesia, and Germany then uses the Fall turn to move that unit to Munich! Now, the
Austrian, of course, pulls the army dislodged from Warsaw off the board in the Spring, and as
this was his fourth unit and he owns only his three home centres, he need not even rebuild it!
All of this explains quite nicely why Germany must have opened by moving Berlin to Silesia,
and why Austria and not Germany must have captured Warsaw!"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I had raced ahead of myself, however, and Holmes calmly reined me in. "Unfortunately, Watson,
nearly everything you just said is completely in error. For one thing, the total number of
dislodgements to be reported to the Sultan is not twelve. For another, the issue of whether
the German opened the game by moving his Berlin army to Prussia or to Silesia is immaterial.
In point of fact, he very well could have made either of the two moves. I noticed that you
held your tongue earlier as to the question of whether Warsaw could have been taken in Fall
of 1901 by Germany instead of by Austria. Like the question of whether Germany opened to
Silesia or Prussia, this is, in fact, another case in which we cannot know and happily do
not need to know. Perhaps the attack on Warsaw was made by Germany rather than Austria;
either way it happened, you will find that the answers to the Sultan's questions are the
same in the end. Whichever of Germany or Austria it was that took Warsaw, the unit-build
that was generated by this capture may even have been waived. Since each possibility produces
the same result, I simply chose one of the alternatives, and assumed that it was Austria that
took Warsaw, and that Austria took full advantage of his opportunity to build two new units."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I was astounded by this. "How can the position of the German army not be of consequence to us,
Holmes? Surely only from Silesia can that army be sent to Munich!"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"You assume too much, Watson. The army never makes it to Munich. The answer to your questions
is wrapped up in that retreated Russian army. Recall too, Watson, that I have yet to prove to
your satisfaction that the Sultan must be in Moscow. You have apparently not given that point
its due thought."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"You are right, Holmes. I still see no reason why Russia cannot retake Warsaw after having
retreated to Livonia, or anywhere else."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Watson, you have overlooked one most important detail. The army that retreated to Moscow
cannot be the unit that ends 1902 in Warsaw! Remember, that is the army which started the
game there!"
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I was mortified that I had missed it. "Of course," I cried. "The other Russian army &mdash; which
opened the game by moving from Moscow to Sevastopol where it assisted in the dislodgement of
the Turkish fleet &mdash; must be the army to end up in Warsaw! It must march to Warsaw from
Sevastopol in 1902, and therefore must move to the Ukraine or to Moscow in the Spring and
into Warsaw in the Fall."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Quite correct, Watson, and its path must go through the Ukraine, not Moscow."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
A moment's thought convinced me that Holmes was right. "Yes, I see that, Holmes, but I still
fail to understand why the lone retreat was necessarily made to Moscow. Russia could have
retreated his Warsaw army to Livonia then moved it to Moscow on the Spring turn before using
it in the Fall to aid in the recapture of Warsaw by its fellow army advancing from Ukraine.
During all this, the German army walks into Munich while the Austrian army, dislodged from
Warsaw in the Fall, is removed and rebuilt as a new army at home. With this, the deed is done!"
<p align=justify>
"If that were the case, Watson, consider how many more dislodgements we would obtain. Certainly
you see that if the retreated unit must spend a turn moving to its final position in Moscow,
we can, as you described so well, accomplish only one more dislodgement, giving us the total
of twelve that you mentioned earlier. However, if the army had been retreated, as I claim it
must have been, directly into its final position at Moscow, it can spend both the Spring and
the Fall turns of 1902 in the execution of support orders, and we can reach thirteen, not
twelve, dislodgements."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
I saw at once, and I slumped back in my chair, amazed once again at my friend's powers of
analysis. Holmes concluded the tale for me as I watched. "In the Spring, the Russian moves
his Sevastopol army to Ukraine, and orders his Moscow army to support a German attack on
the Austrian unit in Warsaw (or, as I have said, perhaps it was an Austrian attack on a
German unit; we do not need to know). This dislodged army must be disbanded (although I
note that without the restriction on the number of retreats that were made, the dislodged
army could perhaps have instead chosen a retreat from which it could simply move during
the Fall turn into the home centre where it did not begin the game).
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Whether it be it an Austrian or a German unit dislodged from Warsaw in the Spring, we
proceed regardless to the next season. In the Fall, having already seen a second consecutive
dislodgement accomplished in Warsaw, we see a third, with the Russian now using Moscow to
support his own attack from the Ukraine."

I sat stunned at the unassailable logic and beauty of my friend's reasoning, while he
continued making observations and tying loose ends for me.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Assuming, as we have, that the German army was dislodged in the Fall rather than the Spring
turn, and therefore Germany was not the foreign power to earn a build from the capture of
Warsaw, it is interesting to note that at this point, Germany is left in the curious position
of having absolutely no units on the board! Still owning all three of his home centres,
however, he rebuilds in each one, recreating the position he held at the start of the game.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Elsewhere, Russia finds himself with but two units remaining (these being his armies, which
have swapped their original places) and once again in possession of all four of his home
centres, so he simply rebuilds his two fleets.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Austria &mdash; which as you may have noticed, and like Germany as well, could perhaps have issued
absolutely no orders at all in Fall of 1902 &mdash; has, in our choice of scenarios granting him
the temporary ownership of Warsaw, lost two armies by force during the second game-year, and
has lost possession of one centre, making him eligible to build the single army that it takes
to restore him to the same position in which he began the game.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"On the subject of powers that may well have issued no orders at all, this is true of Italy
for the Spring 1902 moves. Italy spent that phase simply watching his fleet be expelled from
Venice, and then used his two remaining units to retake Venice in the Fall, thus allowing
him to rebuild his lost fleet in the Winter.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"England has managed to use the four movement phases to send his army to meet its end in
foreign lands while swapping the position of his two fleets without gaining or losing any
centres, so he stands able to build a new army at Liverpool at the end of 1902.
<p align=justify>
<!br>
"Turkey and France, as we have seen, spent the second game-year simply aiding in the
destruction of other powers' pieces, neither gaining nor losing any centres while
doing so, then returning to the position they held at the beginning of the year."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
Holmes tapped his pipe to empty it. "So you see, Watson, His Majesty's courier has been
instructed to proceed to Moscow, where the Sultan of Suwat awaits with poised pen to sign
an extension on the crucial lease. Further, the courier has been instructed to inform the
Sultan that the answer to his conundrum as to how many dislodgements can be made while as
quickly as possible recreating the game-start position with units other than those that
started the game is not an even dozen, but rather a <i>baker's</i> dozen &mdash; thirteen."
-->
<p align=justify>
"Here are a couple of other curious facts in the solution as it was
reconstructed here:
<p align=justify>
"In every season where there were dislodgements,<br>
"there was one unit that did nothing but hold;<br>
"there was one space that was attacked every turn and the unit on it dislodged;<br>
"each time a different power issued nothing but hold orders (and thus was
technically in civil disorder).<br>
"Furthermore there were two powers whose units never crossed their own national borders."
<p align=justify>
"Trivialities, Holmes. The more important question is: How can we know for
sure that this is the optimal solution? Perhaps more dislodgements can be
found in any one season? Take the first Fall season. Six dislodgements is
awesome, but couldn't there be seven or eight?"
<p align=justify>
"You are correct that we have no ultimate proof, but we can gain confidence
by exploring the alternatives. As a single dislodgement requires at a
minimum three units involved, being the dislodged party, the dislodging party
and the supporting party, when starting out with twenty-two units the
maximum number of dislodgements is logically seven."
<p align=justify>
"Ah, right. And the limitations of the board setup will prevent us from reaching
this maximum so soon."
<p align=justify>
"On the contrary, Watson, it is quite possible to get to seven
dislodgements in Fall 1901, without even changing too much to the orders in
our solution. The problem is rather that it is impossible from there to
arrive at a solution."
<p align=justify>
<!br>
Consulting his pocket-watch, Holmes rose up saying, "But before going into that,
Watson, we simply must return post-haste to the apartment in Baker Street, where my potted
ferns will be wanting my full attention."
<i><blockquote><p align=justify>Can you confirm for yourself the statements that Holmes made
in the time it takes Holmes and Watson to call a hansom cab and get back to
Baker Street? And what caused Holmes to invite the Sultan to London?
Was it something he saw on the <b>Diplomacy</b> board?
