<p>As one might expect, the German perspective of and on WWI is quite different from that of Belgians, Frenchmen, Brits, Americans and even some Germans.  Today, a hundred years it is less stressful, although not easy, to deal with the factual questions: who, what, where, when; but the how and why are more difficult; and discussing the consequences of the War is still even more difficult.</p>

<p>Stories in chronological order going back in time: most recent story is at the end.</p>
