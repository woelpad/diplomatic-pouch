<br />
<p>Wars don&rsquo;t change just because we flip a page over on the calendar. The transition from August to September on the Western Front didn&rsquo;t mean much to the average Doughboy, Tommy, Poliu or Kraut. The fighting went on with little to show for it except the ever-lengthening casualty lists and the larger numbers of wounded in the hospitals. The soldiers died. The staff officers planned. The generals commanded. And the politicians schemed.</p>
<p>Still, one thing did not die --- the hope, on all sides, that this would indeed be &ldquo;the war to end all wars&rdquo;. Yes, in spite of everything that had happened in the last four years some people still hoped. This month is theirs.</p>
<br />
<p align="center"><img alt="We Are Making a New World" src="../images/100F2A_image14.jpg" style="width: 624.00px; height: 488.38px"></p>
<p align="center">&ldquo;We Are Making a New World&rdquo; (Imperial War Museum)</p>
<br />
<p>The War to End All Wars: World War I was unprecedented when it happened. War on a global scale with that many casualties and advances in military technology was something no one had ever seen. After all the destruction the hope was that it would be the last war.</p>
<p>32 nations &ldquo;so furiously waged together&rdquo; for a period of time that even historians cannot agree on but ranged from four years, three months and one week (time of fighting) from 1 August, 1914 to 11 November, 1918 (or 1564 days ((or 1568 days if you include the start of the Austro-Serbian War)) ). If you count all the fighting in Turkey as part of WWI, then eight years, two months (or 3002 days).</p>
<p>World War One was one of the deadliest conflicts in the history of the human race, in which over sixteen million people died. The total number of both civilian and military casualties was around thirty-seven million (about equal to the entire population of California in 2018). The war killed almost seven million civilians and ten million military personnel.</p>
<p>In terms of treasure the numbers were unbelievably high --- until later wars came along. In total costs the United States spent $22.625 billions, Great Britain $35.334 billions (plus another $1,408 billions from the Empire), France $24.265 billions, Russia $22.293 billions, and Italy $12, 413 billions. On the other side, Germany spent $37,775 billions, Austria-Hungary $20.622 billions, Turkey $1,430 billions and Bulgaria $815 millions.</p>
<p>To put all that in perspective keep in mind that Mother Nature, in a single season, at no cost to herself, managed to kill well over fifty million people.</p>
<p>Fall will arrive in September, bringing with it lower temperatures and lower humidity. For September: the average daily temperature is: 16C, 61F; with average daily highs and lows of: 21C and 13C; and 61F and 55F; average rainfall for the month is 16 mm over 11 days; number of hours of sunshine is 8.</p>
<p>Please note that as the pace and scope of the fighting, especially on the Western Front, increases, the format for the daily news dispatches has changed to include a bit more information in a hopefully more readable format.</p>

<p align="center">British tank passes dead German horse at Battle of Peronne</p>
<p>Keep in mind that by the beginning of WWI cavalry was a thing of the past on the Western Front, although it still played a role on the Eastern Front and an important role in the Middle East. Still, over a hundred thousand horses were used on the Western Front for transportation and food, but by the end of the War most transport needs were being handled by railroad, motorized transport or, at the front, foot.</p>

<p>Battle of Baku &ndash; British General Lionel Dunsterville, commander of the Allied force in Baku, Azerbaijan, called Dunsterforce, met with leaders of the Centrocaspian Dictatorship and warned if the situation to hold the city from the Islamic Army of the Caucasus did not improve in the next few days, his force would withdraw. He was convinced to stay on until a White Russian reinforcement of 600 troops arrived.</p>

<p align="center">A picture of Fanya Kaplan's attempt to kill Lenin, painted by P. P. Baloyusov</p>
<br />
<p>On Aug. 17, Moisei Uritsky, the head of the Cheka in Petrograd, was assassinated by Leonid Kannegisser, an Imperial Russian Army cadet, in retaliation for executions carried out by the Cheka on fellow officers. On Aug. 30 Vladimir Lenin was shot and critically wounded by Fanya Kaplan in Moscow, with his life in the balance for days after.</p>
<p>The Cheka then launched a crackdown on dissidents in what became known as the Red Terror, based on Lenin's long-time advocacy for mass terror as a means to accomplish rapid societal transformation as seen in the French Revolution. At first they targeted the Socialist Revolutionaries, their former allies, to which Ms. Kaplan had belonged, but this was soon expanded to include the "bourgeois" and all anti-Bolshevik opposition, including strikers and farmers (who were accused of monarchist sympathies).</p>
<p>At the same time the White Armies (Denikin's Kossacks in the south, Kolchak's Siberians in the east) executed their White Terror campaigns in the territories under their control, which were equally merciless and mainly aimed at the Bolsheviks and the Jews, which they treated as one and the same (both Trotsky and Uritsky were Jews, just as Uritsky's murderer Kannegisser, proof that there were Jews on both sides). The local populations in the ebb and flow of the three year long Civil War were literally between hammer and anvil.</p>

<p>Lieutenant-General Sir George Mark Watson Macdonogh GBE KCB KCMG (4 March 1865 &ndash; 10 July 1942) was a British Army general officer. After early service in the Royal Engineers he became a staff officer prior to the outbreak of the First World War. His main role in the war was as Director of Military Intelligence at the War Office in 1916-18.</p>
<p>He succeeded Edmonds as head of MO5, drafting measures to control aliens in the event of war. Henry Wilson, Director of Military Operations, distrusted him as a convert from Methodism to Roman Catholicism. In March 1914 Macdonogh was one of the few officers in the War Office willing to coerce Protestant Ulster during the Curragh Incident.</p>

<p>The Battle of Havrincourt begins the attack on the Hindenburg Line. Despite their numerical superiority and strong fortifications within the town, the Germans were unable to hold their position and by the day's end Havrincourt was in British hands. The victory was not particularly showy or impressive, but it highlighted a growing lack of fighting spirit among the German soldiers on the Western Front. While some took no notice of this small battle, others noted its significance &ndash; indeed, Field Marshal Julian Byng himself saw it as a turning point of sorts. This victory encouraged Field Marshal Douglas Haig to approve an attack on Epehy the following day, along with other operations to prepare for the assault on the Hindenburg Line.</p>

<p>September 12, 1918 - The first stand-alone attack by Americans occurs as the U.S. 1st Army attacks the southernmost portion of the Western Front in France at St. Mihiel. The offensive is supported by an unprecedented 1,476 Allied aircraft used as part of a coordinated air-ground attack.

<p>Let's get deeper into perhaps the most consequential battle of the entire War, the Battle of Dobre Pole. Caution for Star Wars fans: The Bulgarians had the high ground and the numbers, but they still lost. Because the other side had better morale &hellip; and better artillery.</p>
<p>September 15, 1918 - The Allies push the Bulgarians out of Serbia as French, Serbian and Italian troops make rapid gains, advancing nearly 20 miles northward from Greece in three days. Bulgarian troops attempting to redeploy westward through the narrow Kosturino Pass are relentlessly bombarded by airplanes and overall troop morale collapses. Meanwhile, political turmoil strikes at home as anti-war riots erupt in Bulgaria's cities along with Russian-style revolutionary fervor that results in the proclamation of local soviets.</p>
<br />
<p><b>Western Front</b></p>
<p>British capture Maissemy, five miles north-west of St. Quentin.</p>
<p>Germans make ineffective counter-attacks south of the Oise.</p>

<p><b>Southern Front</b></p>
<p>The Vardar Offensive begins. The Allies (mainly French and Serbs) break through the Bulgarian lines at Dobro Pole, high up in the Moglenitsa Mountains. Bulgarian position breached on front of seven miles, and 800 prisoners taken.</p>

<p><b>September 26, 1918</b> &ndash; After a six hour bombardment and led by over 700 Allied tanks, the U.S. 1st Army and French 4th Army begin a joint offensive to clear out the strongly defended corridor between the Meuse River and the Argonne Forest. Here, the Germans do not fall back and the battle soon resembles action from earlier years in the war. Amid a steady rain, the troops advance yard-by-yard over the muddy, crater-filled terrain with 75,000 American casualties suffered over six weeks of fighting.</p>
<p>At 5:30 on the morning of September 26, 1918, after a six-hour-long bombardment over the previous night, more than 700 Allied tanks, followed closely by infantry troops, advance against German positions in the Argonne Forest and along the Meuse River.</p>
<p>Building on the success of earlier Allied offensives at Amiens and Albert during the summer of 1918, the Meuse-Argonne offensive, carried out by 37 French and American divisions, was even more ambitious. Aiming to cut off the entire German 2nd Army, Allied Supreme Commander Ferdinand Foch ordered General John J. Pershing to take overall command of the offensive. Pershing&rsquo;s American Expeditionary Force (AEF) was to play the main attacking role, in what would be the largest American-run offensive of World War I.</p>
<p>After some 400,000 U.S. troops were transferred with difficulty to the region in the wake of the U.S.-run attack at St. Mihiel, launched just 10 days earlier, the Meuse-Argonne offensive began. The preliminary bombardment, using some 800 mustard gas and phosgene shells, killed 278 German soldiers and incapacitated more than 10,000. The infantry advance began the next morning, supported by a battery of tanks and some 500 aircraft from the U.S. Air Service.</p>
<p>By the morning of the following day, the Allies had captured more than 23,000 German prisoners; by nightfall, they had taken 10,000 more and advanced up to six miles in some areas. The Germans continued to fight, however, putting up a stiff resistance that ultimately forced the Allies to settle for far fewer gains than they had hoped.</p>
<p>Pershing called off the Meuse-Argonne offensive on September 30; it was renewed again just four days later, on October 4. Exhausted, demoralized and plagued by the spreading influenza epidemic, the German troops held on another month, before beginning their final retreat. Arriving U.S. reinforcements had time to advance some 32 kilometers before the general armistice was announced on November 11, bringing the First World War to a close.</p>
