<p align="center">The message becomes news, propaganda and a patriotic paean.</p>
<br />
<p>Posters were a big deal during WWI. Every belligerent produced them in massive quantities and varying qualities. The cheapest broad sheets were mostly text on cheap paper, unsigned, and used as throw-away promotional and recruiting posters to hang anywhere and everywhere a space could be found. The most expensive posters were produced on good quality paper, signed by the often well-known artist, and frequently used in promoting special events and given out as rewards to big donors in war bond drives, Red Cross charity drives, and other patriotic occasions. Surprisingly, the most valuable posters were signed by the artist and a famous celebrity. Even more surprising, the highest prices paid for such posters were not for those of sports stars, movie stars, but opera singers! The three highest known prices ever paid (in the form of a donation --- remember there was no income tax or tax deductions at that time) for posters were all in excess of $100,000 for posters signed by Enrico Caruso, John MacCormack and Madam Ernestine Schumann-Heink (who raised another $50,000 for singing &ldquo;Stille Nacht&rdquo; in German at a Navy Hospital concert in San Diego --- I only know that because my grandmother was there that night). They could all afford it. Caruso&rsquo;s tax-free income in those days was the equivalent to $30 million a year today. During her long career (she died in 1936) she raised millions of dollars for her beloved adopted homeland (she was born and raised in Austria). America.</p>

<p><b>The War to Make the World Safe for Democracy</b>: This name is based on a speech given by US President Woodrow Wilson to Congress on April 2, 1917 in which he asked them to declare war on Germany. This was his statement</p>
<p>&ldquo;The world must be made safe for democracy. Its peace must be planted upon the tested foundations of political liberty. We have no selfish ends to serve. We desire no conquest, no dominion. We seek no indemnities for ourselves, no material compensation for the sacrifices we shall freely make. We are but one of the champions of the rights of mankind. We shall be satisfied when those rights have been made as secure as the faith and the freedom of nations can make them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>October definitely brings cooler temperatures to Paris with October&rsquo;s average daily temperature falling to 12C and 54F; average daily highs and lows are: 16C high and 10C low; and 61F high and 50F low; rainfall is up considerably to 25mm average for the month over 13 days. One quirk of Paris&rsquo;s seasons is that October has more days of rain than November but gets less rain. Hours of sunshine is down to four hours a day.</p>

<p align="center">Plateau of the Chemin des Dames</p>
<p>The Third Battle of the Aisne came as a complete surprise to the allies, including British troops who had been sent there to rest in a quiet sector. A German breakthrough was aided by orders of a French general to mass troops in the front line - a tactic by this date discredited. The penetration broke into open country and fighting went on from 27 May to 6 June 1918, but ran out of energy owing to lack of a strategic objective and lengthening supply lines. During the Second Battle of the Marne, the last fight on the Chemin des Dames occurred between 2 August and 10 October 1918.</p>

<p>The Alsace-Lorraine region where the offensive played out, was important as it contained many railroads and communication lines between the German heimat and the frontline. Breaking through would effectively cut the German Army in two. But the terrain was difficult and the enemy well-entrenched. What was Pershing's plan and what were the difficulties encountered? Learn it through the story of the Lost Batallion.</p>

<p>In an era when there were many more crowned heads of state than there are now, the King of Belgium stood out as the only one on the frontline in command of his troops. It's said that the German troops refused to shoot at him for fear of retribution for killing a person related in blood with their own Kaiser. But bombs and mines have no conscience, and when your country is reduced to nothing more than a big beach and some farmland, there's not much space to hide either. Still he stayed with his men for the whole duration of the war, a soldier, a king and a diplomat respected both by his countrymen and abroad. His son would fare much worse, forced to abdicate after spending the next World War as a hostage (some say a traitor) of the same German invaders. But that's another story.</p>

<p>President Wilson replies to German Note of the 20th, and agrees, to submit the matter to the Allied and Associated Governments.</p>
<p><b>October 23, 1918</b> - Under pressure from the French and British, President Wilson informs the German government that armistice negotiations can not ensue with the current military or Imperial war leaders still in place. An outraged General Ludendorff then disavows the negotiations as &#39;unconditional surrender&#39; and is forced to resign by the Kaiser. In the face of such turmoil, the armistice negotiations are conducted principally by civilian members of Germany&#39;s government. This will become the basis of a postwar &quot;stab in the back&quot; claim by German militarists asserting their troops at the Front were sold out by the politicians back home.</p>
<p>Under pressure from the government of Chancellor Max von Baden, Erich Ludendorff, the quartermaster general of the German army, resigns on October 27, 1918, just days before Germany calls for an armistice, bringing World War I to an end after four long years.</p>
<p>Second in command to Chief of Staff Paul von Hindenburg for most of the war effort, Ludendorff had masterminded the final, massive German offensive during the spring of 1918. Beginning that summer, however, the Allies&mdash;spearheaded by British, French and American troops&mdash;made a great resurgence, reversing many of Germany&rsquo;s gains and turning the tide decisively toward an Allied victory. By the end of September, the Germans had been forced to retreat to the so-called Hindenburg Line, the last line of their defenses in eastern France and western Belgium; on September 29, that formidable line was breached.</p>
<p>That same day, at a meeting of Kaiser Wilhelm&rsquo;s crown council at the resort town of Spa, Ludendorff demanded that Germany seek an immediate armistice on the terms set forth by U.S. President Woodrow Wilson in his famous Fourteen Points address the previous January. A week later, the newly appointed chancellor, von Baden, contacted Washington to open peace negotiations. Fighting continued, however, as Wilson and the other Allies refused to negotiate with an undemocratic Germany governed, in effect, by the army&rsquo;s Supreme Command. A defiant Ludendorff and Hindenburg resolved to fight on, issuing a letter to all army group commanders calling the Allied demands that Germany submit to its armistice terms unreasonable and &ldquo;nothing for us soldiers but a challenge to continue our resistance with all our strength.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This telegraphed &ldquo;fight to the finish&rdquo; order was withdrawn after an army commander protested&mdash;its message was largely impossible for the demoralized and broken German army to carry out. It was leaked to the newspapers, however, and published on October 25 to the great outrage of the German government. Von Baden went to Kaiser Wilhelm to demand Ludendorff&rsquo;s resignation; for his part, Ludendorff traveled to Berlin to convince the kaiser to reject the latest note from President Wilson. He blamed defeat on the battlefield to discontent on the home front, stating that if the German people would support their troops, &ldquo;the war can be maintained for some months.&rdquo; Although backed by Hindenburg and the chief of the German navy, Admiral Reinhardt Scheer, Ludendorff had angered the kaiser, and was forced to tender his resignation. Hindenburg tried to resign as well, but was refused by Wilhelm, and he remained as a mere figurehead for a great German war-making machine that had lost its driving force. Less than two weeks later, the kaiser himself abdicated, and World War I was over.</p>
