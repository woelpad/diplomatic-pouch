<h2>INTRO</h2>
<p>As it got closer to the end of the WWI Centennial commemoration, something I had been writing about in both TDP and DW, I realized I wanted to do something &#8220;special&#8221; to mark the end of the conflict that wasn&#8217;t original but it seemed to be what I wanted to do &mdash; something that would focus on the lesser known events, places and personalities of the so-called Great War. I shared my idea with Mario and he embraced it and gave it a real purpose and format. From then on it was just a matter of putting together a 100 piece picture puzzle with some of the pieces still blank.</p>
<p>Even after the official end of the celebration on 11 November 2018 in Paris (more on that below) good scholarly articles, news reports (especially on the centennial commemoration events held not just in Western Europe but around the wortld), and photos continued to appear in my WWI Google search list. You can still see these on TDP&#8217;s Facebook page. Taken all together they make up a fifth chapter to this article.</p>
<p>Larry Peery: The Hundred Last Days &ndash; <a href="100F1.html">Part 1, August 1918 &ndash; The Great War</a><br />Americans flood the battlefield.</p>
<p>Larry Peery: The Hundred Last Days &ndash; <a href="100F2.html">Part 2, September 1918 &ndash; The War to End All Wars</a><br />The allies are pushing on all fronts.</p>
<p>Larry Peery: The Hundred Last Days &ndash; <a href="100F3.html">Part 3, October 1918 &ndash; The War to Make the World Safe for Democracy</a><br />The central powers start to crack.</p>
<p>Larry Peery: The Hundred Last Days &ndash; <a href="100F4.html">Part 4, November 1918 &ndash; The War of the Nations</a><br />The last of the central powers throws in the towel. It's Armistice Day!</p>
<h2>NOVEMBER 11, 2018</h2>
<p>Just after the infamous November 11, 2018 meeting in Paris that was supposed to mark the official end of the Great War centennial celebration but instead turned into a demonstration of a spoiled child&#8217;s hysteronics by the president of the Unite States, I wrote several articles on the meeting and the diplomatic fiasco it became. I&#8217;m calmer now but my feelings remain the same. Anyone interested in WWI and especially the Paris Peace Conference that followed it should read up on that one day meeting that was a perfect example of how NOT to conduct international diplomacy.</p>
<h2>THE PARIS PEACE CONFERENCE, 1919</h2>
<p>I wanted to do a much shortened and condensed version of the WWI timeline for the PPC but real time issues got in the way. And that seems like a perfect way to wrap up this little addendum to the WWI commemoration project. I&#8217;m waiting for the powers that be to come and take away my personal Diplomacy Archives and this computer, among other things.</p>
<p>So, perhaps this will be the last bit of peeriblah. Who knows.</p>
