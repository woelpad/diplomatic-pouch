<p align="center">Can you identify the battle and when and where the picture was taken?</p>
<p><b>The War of the Nations</b>: Thirty-two countries were involved in World War I, thus the name the War of the Nations.</p>
<p>Winter will definitely arrive sometime in November, usually indicated by when the leaves have fallen from the trees and the city takes on a gray and gloomy look. The average daily temperature will fall to 7C and 45F. The average daily highs and lows will be: 11C high and 6C low; and 52F high and 43F low. The amount of rainfall will decline to 22 mm, but the possibility of snow increases. Rain occurs on about half of all days. The hours of sunshine are down to 2, as winter sets in. &nbsp;The key thing to keep in mind was that in the trenches and forward areas everything was damp or wet most of the time and the chill or cold was of that constant piercing kind that goes right down to the bones. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Note that in general as one moves north and east of Paris the extremes in the weather will increase. And, as one moves south and west there may be a slight improvement in the weather. &nbsp;The statistics on Spanish influenza cases and the weather patterns show that there was a definitely relationship between the Spanish influenza pandemic and WWI. &nbsp;The weather of the winter of 1918 was one of the worst in century in the Western Front. That, combined with the number of soldiers living in unsanitary conditions and the tens of millions of people who were not getting a healthy diet, made the entire region a major center for the Spanish flu pandemic. Although precise numbers are hard to come-by it is clear that many more millions of people died from the flu than the war. &nbsp;</p>
<p>First Spanish flu cases in Spain, where reports on the disease are published freely due to the lack of wartime censorship. &nbsp;News about the rapidly spreading pandemic was carefully controlled &nbsp;on the Western Front and in newspapers at home until the story got too big to hide. </p>
<br />
<p>FOUR PHASES OF WWI:</p>
<p>1) From the day the War began on 28 June, 1914 to 15 July 1918, the period of German military ascendancy --- 1481 days, 4 years, 0 months, and 20 days </p>
<p>2) From the beginning of the German military decline on 18 June 1918 to the end of military hostilities, the Armistice, on 11 November, 1918. --- 116 days, 0 years, 3 months, and 24 days</p>
<p>3) From the Armistice signing on 11 November, 1918 &nbsp;to the signing of the Paris Peace &nbsp;Conference Agreements or Treaty of Versailles on 25 July, 1919. --- 256 days, 0 years, 8 months, and 14 days</p>
<p>4) From Paris Peace Conference on 25 July, 1919 to the signing of Treaty of Severs with Turkish Republic on 24 July, 1923. &nbsp;--- 1460 days , 3 years, 11 months, 29 days</p>
<br />
<p>TOTAL HOURS, DAYS, YEARS:</p>
<p>79512 hours, 3313 Days, 9 Years, &nbsp;0 Months, &nbsp;26 Days</p>
<p>We are now approaching the end of Phase 2. &nbsp;</p>

<h3><center>9 DAYS TO GO &nbsp; &nbsp;WEDNESDAY &nbsp; 2 NOVEMBER &nbsp;1918 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;7C/45F</center></h3>
<br />
<p>As an example of the grim nature of the battle, two bodies were found in one street locked together, one of a German officer with revolver in his hand, the other of his victim, a Scottish soldier clutching his rifle with bayonet which he had run through his opponent&#39;s body.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The commander of the relieving French division, General C. Gassoins, on establishing his headquarters in Buzancy, seeing the still-fresh aftermath of the attack and receiving reports of what had occurred, was so impressed that he ordered the immediate construction of a memorial to the 15th Division on the position of the soldier&#39;s body found furthest forward on the battlefield, in the open fields beyond the village.&nbsp;On its plain granite plinth is sculpted a circular bas-relief showing an intertwined rose and thistle, below which is inscribed (in French): </p>
<p>&quot;Here will flourish for ever</p>
<p>the glorious thistle of Scotland</p>
<p>among the roses of France&quot;</p>
<p>and on the side </p>
<p>The 17th French Infantry Division</p>
<p>to</p>
<p>The 15th Scottish Infantry Division</p>
<p>It was the only monument erected in the field during the First World War by a French unit dedicated to a British one. It was a visible manifestation of the significant resurgence which the various actions at the time of XXII Corps brought about in the French command&#39;s faith in the continued fighting ability of its British ally, a faith which had lately been badly shaken by the dramatic British retreat at the start of the German Kaiserschlacht&nbsp;offensive.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The monument was later removed from the position near the crest of the ridge where first erected and placed in the care of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission&nbsp;within the precincts of the military cemetery on the western edge of the village, where those of the 15th (Scottish) Division who fell in the action are interred.&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>November 3, 1918</b>&nbsp;- Mutiny strikes the German Navy at the ports of Kiel and Wilhelmshaven as sailors refuse orders to put to sea to engage in a final colossal battle with the British Navy. Along with this, revolutionary fervor and Bolshevist-style uprisings erupt in German cities including Munich, Stuttgart and Berlin. The extent of the unrest stuns German leaders, and even the Allies, who fear Germany might now succumb to a violent Bolshevist revolution in the manner of Russia. This brings a stark urgency to the armistice negotiations.</p>

<p>&quot;These are some of our Marines buried here,&quot; said U.S. Marine Sergeant Major Darrell Carver of the 6th Marine Regiment as he walked among the graves of U.S. soldiers, most of them killed in the World War I Battle of Belleau Wood, during a ceremony to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the battle on Memorial Day at the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery on May 27, 2018, near Chateau-Thierry, France.

<p align="center">Three small Commonwealth WWI cemeteries are located on the same farm in France. The British custom is to bury soldiers where their bodies were found or on the battlefield. &nbsp;</p>

<br />
<p>Archaeologists in the city of Arras in northern France discovered the intact remains of 24 British servicemen who were buried in 1917 during World War I. The discovery of the skeletons, which lay side by side with their army boots still intact had evidence they were from the same town. They were unearthed during the excavations for a new BMW plant at the end of May 2001. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission who took possession of the remains, identified 20 of the soldiers who were buried together to be from the 10th Lincoln Battalion. Three others, found in a nearby shell hole, were from the Marine Infantry and one other was found buried alone.</p>

<p>Albert Ballin acted as mediator between the United Kingdom&nbsp;and the German Empire&nbsp;in the tense years prior to the outbreak of World War I. Terrified that he would lose his ships in the event of naval hostilities, Ballin attempted to broker a deal whereby the United Kingdom and Germany would continue to race one another in passenger liners but desist in their attempts to best one another&#39;s naval fleets.&nbsp;Consequently, the outbreak of war deeply disillusioned him. Many of the Hamburg-America Line&#39;s ships were lost or suffered considerable damage during the hostilities.</p>
<p>Completely distraught upon hearing the news of the abdication of his benefactor and protector, Kaiser Wilhelm II, Ballin committed suicide by taking an overdose of sleeping pills&nbsp;two days before the armistice&nbsp;ended World War I. Ballin&#39;s fears were soon to be realized; the company&#39;s flagships, the triumvirate SS Imperator, SS Vaterland&nbsp;and SS Bismarck&nbsp;were ceded as war prizes to Great Britain and the United States</p>

<p><b>November 9, 1918</b>&nbsp;- The Kaiser&#39;s Imperial government collapses in ruin as a German republic is proclaimed with Friedrich Ebert heading the new provisional government. Kaiser Wilhelm then seeks refuge in Holland amid concerns for his safety after his generals warn him they may not be able to adequately protect him from the volatile situation in Germany.</p>

<p><b>November 11, 1918</b>&nbsp;- At 5:10 am, in a railway car at Compi&egrave;gne, France, the Germans sign the Armistice which is effective at 11 am--the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month. Fighting continues all along the Western Front until precisely 11 o&#39;clock, with 2,000 casualties experienced that day by all sides. Artillery barrages also erupt as 11 am draws near as soldiers yearn to claim they fired the very last shot in the war.</p>

<p>The British landscape painter presents an aerial view of the Belgian city of Ypres after it was first bombed in 1915, employing the abstract motifs used by cubists and futurists. Nevinson, a devotee of Italian futurism, initially believed the conflict was a sign of progress in the machine age. But after serving as an official war artist in France, he became ardently anti-war.</p>

<p>Luxembourg is a member of NATO today but one opposition infamously said in Parliament, &ldquo;Today our main line of defense is our ATM machines.&rdquo; &nbsp; (about 1.574 per 100,000 adults). Total population is about 591,000.</p>

<h3><center>The Siamese Expeditionary Forces</center></h3>
<p>The Siamese EF seemed to spend more time squabbling with their French &ldquo;hosts&rdquo;, who seem to confuse them with other Indo-chinese under the command of the French, than fighting the Germans.</p>
<p><span class="c1">Read the <a href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Siamese_Expeditionary_Forces&amp;sa=D&amp;ust=1541901981597000">wiki story</a>. It&rsquo;s not a particularly pleasant one.</span></p>
<br />
<p>The Meuse-Argonne Offensive lasted from 26 Sept. &ndash; 11 November, 44 days</p>
<p>Over 600 KIA per day, 2,175+ wounded per day.</p>
<br />
<p>The Siamese King, Rama VI, is considered the father of Thai nationalism.</p>
<br />
<p>The Siamese Expeditionary Force landed in France at the end of July 1918. The ground forces underwent brief training and proceeded to the fighting front in mid-September. All their equipment was provided by the French military authorities. The Siamese personnel themselves wore khaki uniforms similar to those of the British Army. The motor transport and medical detachments of the Siamese Expeditionary Force reached the front in time to participate in the Champagne and Argonne battles. The Siamese soldiers gave excellent service in these actions. The force, consisting of 850 men, lost 19 killed. Of the 19 killed, half died from the influenza pandemic and the rest in accidents.</p>

<br />
<p>On 22 July 1917 Vajiravudh declared war on Germany and Austria-Hungary. He allied Siam with the Allied Powers and expelled German and Austrian officials from the Railway Department and Siam Commercial Bank. He also put the properties of the Central Powers under a Siamese government protectorate. Vajiravudh saw the war as an opportunity to create and promote Siamese nationalism. He changed the Flag of Siam from the elephant banner to the tricolor. King Vajiravudh is considered the father of Thai nationalism, which was later built upon by Field Marshal Phibunsongkhram and Sarit Dhanarajata. He introduced the practice of using the name Rama for the Chakri kings in deference to foreign practice. </p>
<p>Other than 140,000 Vietnamese colonial troops and workers drafted by the French, Siamese troops were the only Southeast Asians in the European theatre. However, the Siamese troops did not see much action, as they arrived in Europe towards the end of the war. Participation in the war allowed Siam to later negotiate with the Western powers as a partner, albeit a junior one.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve learned after studying history, geography and international relations for over fifty years and traveling all over the world visiting what I call famous &ldquo;war and peace sites&rdquo; is that no book, no movie, no work of art can replace an actual visit to a location or the hands-on experience of actually touching relics from these sites.</p>
