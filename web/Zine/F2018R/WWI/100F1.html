<p>World War I&nbsp;or the First World War:&nbsp;The name &ldquo;world war&rdquo; came into use shortly before the First World War and likely came from the German word &ldquo;Weltkrieg,&rdquo; or world war.</p>
<p>The Great War: World War I was one of the largest wars in history. It was the first global war and it lasted over four years. 70 million combatants were involved, 10 million of whom were killed and 20 million of whom were wounded.</p>
<p>One thing the doughboys couldn&rsquo;t do much about during WWI was the weather, although Pershing soon after he arrived set up a primitive AEF weather service that monitored weather reports from as far away as Spitzbergen, Norway and Ireland. &nbsp;Here&rsquo;s a monthly summary for August: Daily temperature: 20C/68F, Daily average temperature: High 25C, Low 16C, High 77F, Low 61F. Monthly rainfall: 21 mm in 10 days; Daily hours of sunshine: 8.</p>

<p>The General Pershing WWI casualty list&nbsp;was a list of casualties released to the media by the American military&nbsp;during World War I. Newspapers like the Evening Public Ledger&nbsp;would title the list&#39;s summary, General Pershing Reports&nbsp;or Pershing Reports.&nbsp;The name General Pershing&nbsp;refers to General John Pershing&nbsp;who was in command of the American Expeditionary Forces&nbsp;(AEF) the expeditionary force&nbsp;of the United States Army&nbsp;during World War I. While fighting the Germans on the Western Front&nbsp;the AEF would take daily casualties in the form of those killed in action (KIA), those who died from their wounds, those who died from disease, accidental deaths, soldiers missing in action (MIA) and soldiers wounded in action (WIA). These numbers would be tabulated by the American military and then released to the American news media.&nbsp;Much after the war the real numbers were mined from the military bureaucracy as opposed to the fog of war. During WWI 4,734,991 served in the American military.&nbsp;There were a total of 116,516 deaths with 53,402 of those in battle.&nbsp;Another 63,114 died in accidental deaths but around 45,000 died due to the 1918 Spanish Flu outbreak&nbsp;(30,000 before they even reached France).&nbsp;Of those that survived the war 204,002 were wounded in some way.</p>
<p>One of the publications that printed this data along with the names who were reported dead and wounded was the Philadelphia newspaper Evening Public Ledger. The Public Ledger&nbsp;was a daily newspaper&nbsp;in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania&nbsp;published from March 25, 1836 to January 1942. Its motto was &quot;Virtue Liberty and Independence&quot;. For a time, it was Philadelphia&#39;s most popular newspaper, but circulation declined in the mid-1930s. In 1913, Cyrus H. K. Curtis&nbsp;purchased the paper from Ochs for $2 million ($ 49,520,000 in 2018) and hired his step son-in-law John Charles Martin&nbsp;as editor.&nbsp;Under Curtis&#39; ownership, the conservative appearance of the Ledger&nbsp;was increased: it avoided bold headlines and seldom printed photographs on the front page. Its conservative format has been compared by scholars to the Wall Street Journal&nbsp;or New York Times&nbsp;of the twentieth century.&nbsp;Curtis built the Ledger&#39;s&nbsp;foreign news service and syndicated it to other papers. From 1918 to 1921, former President William Howard Taft&nbsp;was on staff as an editorial contributor. To broaden the market, and compete against The Evening Bulletin, in 1914 Curtis began publishing the Evening Public Ledger, a bolder paper designed to appeal to a broader public.</p>

It was the Britsh who favored the larger tanks, the French the smaller tanks, and the US who saw their potential as the replacement to horse-drawn artillery.</p>

<h3><center>AMERICA GIRDS FOR WAR</center></h3>
<p>Considering its relatively short duration for the United States, WWI produced a fair share of leaders during the War who went on to important positions in WWII. Among them, president-to-be Dwight Eisenhower, already in the Army, served state-side and never joined the A.E.F. &nbsp;Former President Teddy Roosevelt&rsquo;s request for a commission was turned down by President Wilson for a variety of reasons (mostly political) and excuses (age, health, etc.). Instead Roosevelt sent his youngest son, Quentin, who eventually rose to flag rank, was killed, awarded a Medal of Honor and is buried in Western Europe. Harry S Truman, served in the A.E.F. with the 129th&nbsp;Field Artillery,an artillery regiment from Missouri. Later, of course, he became president. &nbsp;Herbert Hoover&rsquo;s invaluable war relief efforts were recognized and he later became president. Unfortunately his White House performance did not match up to his WWI record. &nbsp;Charles W. Dawes, was a key aide to Gen. John J. Pershing who later held positions under President Harding where he created the Dawes Plan that allowed Germany to borrow money from the United States to pay off its huge war debts to the Allies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Virtually unknown today, Thomas Riley Marshall served as Vice President for both of Wilson&rsquo;s terms in the White House. &nbsp;Perhaps his most important &nbsp;contributions were creating the filibuster rule that prevented anti-War senators from blocking needed war powers acts and helping Mrs. Wilson deal with the President&rsquo;s health and governance issues after his stroke.</p>
<p>In 1914 the USA had a standing Army of 100,000 men and a National Guard and was outnumbered by the German Army 20:1. &nbsp;By the end of WWI the US armed forces included 1.3M volunteers and 3.0M draftees. &nbsp;That didn&rsquo;t just happen. For the first year and a quarter the Army (the Navy and Marines were doing the same, but it takes longer to build a ship than a rifle) vastly expanded the number of regular Army and National Guard cantonments (e.g. forts) and mobilization camps (e.g. camps). Usually by doubling the size of existing facilities and then doubling that number again with temporary new facilities; which came in very hand when WWII and Korea rolled around. New aviation &nbsp;training camps and fields were built, along with plants to build ammo (seventeen, 12,000 acre ammo factories were built in rural areas of the country). New railroads, shipping terminals, etc. were built to build &nbsp;a 66 and possibly100 division USA. Remember, each USA division was the size of two German divisions. &nbsp;It was a huge and expensive process, although in today&rsquo;s dollars it seems so cheap. &nbsp;Mistakes were made by many at all levels. Some of them are funny when we look back. The Army General Sent Pershing a shipload of typewiters were he asked for 50. &nbsp;He ordered 50,000 fighter planes from the French, but forgot that we didn&rsquo;t have engines for them and neither did the French. &nbsp;The Navy decided that 14-inch guns weren&rsquo;t going to work for their new battleships that would take 3 years to build, so they offered the already built (at a cost of $1 million each) gun barrels to the A.E.F. which promptly converted them into railroard transported cannon. More on that later. </p>

<p align="center">&ldquo;Making Soldiers: Ready for Service&rdquo;, by Norah Nielson-Gray, (1917)</p>
<p>The first US Army units that went with Pershing to France in 1918 formed the beginning of the A.E.F. (American Expeditionary Forces. Note the British, Belgians and most of the Allies also had similarly named units. The French, of course, still referred to their Army as an army.) and included just about all the trained and experienced (from service in the Philippines or Mexico). They barely made up a division-sized unit, including the Marines who came with them. &nbsp;As the chart shows the trickle of A.E.F. troops grew to a flood and peaked at over 300,000 in one summer month in 1918. It was a fantastic operation. Unfortunately, it was not an army. Most of the men arriving were barely trained and equipped. Perhsing&rsquo;s first War was to build a real US Army in Western Europe. All that is beyond the scope of this project. Instead, we pick up the story in the summer of 1918 when the first large A.E.F. forces take to the field and have a major impact. &nbsp;And the rest, as they say, is the story of The Hundred Days.</p>

<p>A.E.F. support network in France, also created in 18 months. &nbsp;Pershing gets much of the credit for creating the Supply of Services organization that linked the A.E.F. in the trenches with the States, but even more of the credit should go to his chief of staff and chief purchasing officer. Without them he would not have won his first War. Even with them, he barely made it to the beginning of the end at the Second Battle of the Somme.</p>

<h3>By The Numbers</h3>
<p>From Calais to Strasbourg is 500 km, straightline, 310 miles</p>
<p>From Calais to Strasbourg, 616 km. by road, &nbsp;about 380 miles</p>
<p>X 100 miles for the width of the battle front (layers of trench lines (easily 14 miles deep) and additional zones for reserves, supplies, training, etc.) so figure 100 miles</p>
<p>1 km equals .62 miles</p>
<p>38,000 sq miles &nbsp;(between Indiana and KY)</p>
<p>Traditonal provinces involved: Calais, Picardy, Champagne/Ardennes, Lorraine, Alsace</p>
<p>Current: Hauts du France (Calais and Picardy), and Grand Est, other three)</p>
<p>Hauts du France = 12,283 sq miles.Grand East, 22,275 square miles.</p>
<p>It is good to review these numbers because, unless you&rsquo;re a WWI history buff or have actually visited the Northeast and Northwest of France, you probably don&rsquo;t realize just how small that Western Front was. Altogether it was about the size of an U.S. state between the size of Indiana and Kentucky! &nbsp;</p>
<p>By and large the A.E.F. fighting on the Western Front fought in fields, forests, small hills, small rivers and streams, and the occasional village (commune) or small town. During the course of the war almost everything manmade in the battle areas was either badly damaged or completely destroyed. Still, having experienced it before, the locals who survived returned to their homes, farms and small businesses and rebuilt them --- only to go through the same thing a generation later. &nbsp;Keep in mind that the Germans, French and British had been fighting in this area for well over a century and knew every square inch of it. &nbsp;The A.E.F., on the other hand, had probably never been in France, let alone north of Paris. &nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">&ldquo;Oppy Wood, 1917: Evening&rdquo;, by John Northcote Nash, Imperial War Museum</p>
<p>The <b>Capture of Oppy Wood</b>&nbsp;was an engagement on the Western Front&nbsp;of the First World War&nbsp;on 28 June 1917.&nbsp;The Arras Offensive&nbsp;of 1917 ended with the Germans in possession of a fortified wood to the west of Oppy, Pas-de-Calais, which overlooked British positions. The wood was 1 acre (0.4&nbsp;ha) in area and contained many German observation posts, machine-guns and trench mortars. New German defensive tactics adopted after the Battle of the Somme&nbsp;of defence in depth and rapid counter-attack, had been enforced on the German 6th Army&nbsp;after the disaster of 9 April. A British attack was defeated everywhere on 3 May except at Fresnoy, which was captured by the 1st Canadian Division. The attack on Oppy Wood by the 92nd Brigade&nbsp;of the 31st Division&nbsp;during the Third Battle of the Scarpe&nbsp;(3&ndash;4 May), was repulsed with many British casualties. The area was defended by the 1st Guard Reserve Division and the 15th Reserve Division, which had not needed to call on specialist Eingreif&nbsp;(counter-attack) divisions. </p>
<p>A second attack took place on 28 June, as part of a series of feints, intended to simulate a threat to the cities of Lens in the First Army area and Lille in the Second Army area. The attack was conducted by the 15th Brigade, 5th Division&nbsp;and the 94th Brigade, 31st Division, which advanced on a front extending from Gavrelle&nbsp;in the south to the north of Oppy Wood. After a hurricane bombardment, the objectives were captured with few British losses and German counter-attacks were defeated by artillery-fire. An attack at the same time, by the 4th Canadian Division and the 46th Division astride the Souchez river also succeeded. Operations to continue the encirclement of Lens by an attack by the Canadian Corps&nbsp;on Hill 70 to the north, were postponed until August due to a shortage of artillery. The feint attacks failed to divert German attention from Flanders, which included the transfer of ten divisions to the 4th Army, despite claims by the 6th Army command that the British were preparing an offensive towards Lens; the operations did succeed in diverting German attention from the French front further south. </p>
<p>Bottom line: 3 thousand casualties for the Brits yielded 1 V.C. &nbsp;and 2,100 German casualties.</p>
