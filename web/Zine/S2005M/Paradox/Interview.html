<em>[Editor's Note: I wanted to say that this is the most exciting article
that I have had the pleasure to work on. I hope that you all find it
as exciting as I did. When compiling the questions, I tried to ask the
ones that this community in general had asked. I stayed away from what
other articles have done. Other articles compared Paradox's past works
and focused on what was different about this game. Since we know what
we think about Diplomacy, I thought it best to focus on that area. I
also tried to ask pointed questions so they would be straightforward
answers. I think that Paradox did a wonderful job of answering every
question I posed!!! From the effort they put into getting my questions
answered as a getting it back on time for the release of this issue
shows the interest they have in making us part of their endevour. Well
on to the article.]</em>
<p>Well, first off, we at the The Diplomatic Pouch would like to say
thanks for the interview. We were thrilled to hear that a developer
had taken in interest in making Diplomacy into retail computer game.
Since this is an email interview, I have decided that the best format
is to ask questions in more of a F.A.Q style then an interview style.
</p>
<p> The
intention of this article is not to give an opinion. It is to try
and answer questions that a lot of hobbyists in our community have
been asking. We will not be giving judgement of the game as I don't
believe that it can be done based upon words alone. The other point
that I am going to make is that these questions are from the point
of view of people who play Diplomacy and not from a video game community.
The reason I want to say that is that we will not be asking things
like how much ram you need, and will it run on this or that. We are
more concerned with how it matches up with wants of the Diplomacy
community.</p>
<p> Now I don&#8217;t expect you to be saying, &#8220;Yes, we will be
doing everything you ask.&#8221; with these questions. I know getting
all that is asked here included would be a large undertaking indeed.
But we are a curious type, us Dippers. We really like to know who
people we negotiate with are, and what they are thinking...</p>
<p>(These question's were answered by the development team, so you know
that the answers are coming from the people right in the thick of
things.)</p>
<p align="center"><strong><font size="5">"General Questions"</font></strong></p>
<p><strong>Question #1<br>
I guess my first question is, who are you as a company? Our readers
would like to know a bit about the company that&#8217;s taking on
this endeavour.</strong></p>
<p>Answer #1<br>
We are a fairly small sized company with a global audience within
our niche of Grand Strategy Games. Those who work here all have a
long history of playing board games and computer games. One thing
that characterizes Paradox is that we all put a lot of effort and
commitment into what we do and that in its turn has translated into
a very loyal and continuously growing fan base. But perhaps the most
important thing is that we love what we do for a living! </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #2<br>
Does Paradox know the history of past endeavours with this game? Do
you believe you know what they missed that you can correct, change,
or differentiate enough to succeed?</strong></p>
<p>Answer #2<br>
Yes, we believe we do. Earlier commercial attempts at computer adaptations
of the board game showed us the many challenges we knew we would have
to face if we decided to make this game. The fact that we knew we
were about to tackle a hard problem when we wrote our design has helped
us immensely throughout the project. We also knew there had been several
important advances made in AI research and other applicable computer
game technologies and wanted to make use of state of the art technology
to make a strategy game. We are convinced Diplomacy is a game that
is fundamentally well suited for a computer adaptation, but up until
now the right tools to do so have been lacking.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #3<br>
This game has a very active hobby community with a long history, which
I know you know of. You have mentioned that you want to work with
the hobby community with your product. This interview is an indication
that you are sincere in that regard.</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p> <em><strong>(My question I guess is how well do you know the
game or us? Did anybody on this project ever play postal Diplomacy?
How active are people on this project in the Diplomacy community?
If you could give us a sense of how connected you are to the hobby,
it would help to calm fears that this is just some project by
some computer company that has no idea what Diplomacy is. I guess
we want to feel a sense that you know your audience, or at least
one of your audiences.)</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Answer #3<br>
All those involved in the project have played the board game. I guess
you can say we have two extremes where a few have played it for the
first time in the office when the project started all the way to the
other extreme with a Paradox executive who managed to acquire this
license and has been playing Diplomacy since before some of us were
even born.</p>
<p> Personally, I first played it in high school over ten years ago
and have since enjoyed face-to-face games with friends. To close the
gap further we have also invited a group of initiated Diplomacy players
to take part in our Advisory Board and they have been giving valuable
input along the way. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #4<br>
What is the target audience you are trying for? Is it to create more
mainstream games that 12-16 years will want to play? How about more
mature players? Or is it a combination of both? I am realistic enough
to know that our community is not the only audience you want if you
want to make money, but if the game matches our needs and you build
it, we will come.</strong></p>
<p>Answer #4<br>
Historically, our core target audience for our games have been males
in the age of 18-45 but of course we often find that younger and older
gamers alike enjoy playing our games. For Diplomacy we believe the
target group will be fairly similar, i.e around this age bracket but
stretch a bit in both directions to 16-55. Our aim is to make the
game easy to learn but hard to master, which will attract those who
are sometimes scared away from strategy games on PC (due to the sometimes
steep learning curves). Our ambition is mainly to bring Diplomacy
to a larger audience but we also believe that Diplomacy players can
use it as a complement to their current ways of playing Diplomacy.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p> <strong>Question #5<br>
Will a portion of this game at least be a direct port of the game?</strong></p>
<p> Or as one reader asked --- &#8220;It has been stated that while
not a direct port, the game will &quot;Remain true to the spirit of
the board game.&quot; Could you elaborate on this? Exactly how will
it remain faithful, while what elements do you plan to add, besides
the presumably real-time system?&#8221;</p>
<p> Most people in our community think that this is a fundamental question.
It drives a lot of other questions. If it has lots of other bells
and whistles then great, but being able to play a standard Diplomacy
game like the board game, but electronically is something we would
like.</p>
<p> If it is a direct port portion, will the official board game rule
set be used? </p>
<p>Answer #5:<br>
We are doing a direct port in the sense that we are keeping all the
fundamental rules of the game intact, in particular we will keep the
phases of the game, the simultaneous movement, the turn resolution
rules, the units, the map and the standard scenario. <br>
What we will change are things that aren't as fundamental, but rather
incorporated in the rules to work in a board game environment, such
as civil disorder (we will allow an AI to take over), incorrectly
written orders (won't happen through our GUI), spatial constraints
(i.e., no room metaphor, instead you can negotiate with any player
or any group of players at any time).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #6 <em>(Assumes a &#8220;yes&#8221; for answer #5)</em><br>
Will the game have an AI? The AI I am referring to is one that can
play a standard Diplomacy game. Our community&#8217;s interest is
that the AI engine is something that was found lacking in other past
systems. You might be aware that there is an AI project that has for
the last couple of years tried to create a rudimentary AI. We in the
Diplomacy community think that a real AI is beyond the scope of most
video games because of the interaction with humans. Humans are hard
to match, especially in a game that calls for lying. </strong></p>
<p> <strong>If you are going to have an AI, will it automatic take over
for other players if they leave the game (assuming multiplayer but
more on that later)? </strong><strong>How will the AI handle the existing
paradoxes (no pun intended) that exist in the current rules? </strong></p>
<p><strong> Will it use existing Diplomacy Adjudicator Test Cases (DATC)
like the following?<br>
<a href="http://web.inter.nl.net/users/L.B.Kruijswijk/">http://web.inter.nl.net/users/L.B.Kruijswijk/</a></strong></p>
<p><br>
Answer #6:<br>
Making a Diplomacy AI is really difficult. Not only because it is
always hard to make a good AI (basically no grand strategy games out
there has a good AI in the sense that it can stand up to a good human
player in a fair fight), but also because the AI makes or breaks Diplomacy
as a single player experience. Knowing this, we are doing what we
can to make this an achievable task for us, in particular we are introducing
a graphical negotiation language where the AI&#8217;s can communicate
with each other and with the human player. </p>
<p> Often when Diplomacy and AI are mentioned in the same sentence,
people tend to think about chess AI's, however once they do a bit
of studying they find that it is computationally unfeasible to solve
Diplomacy with a similar approach. When they do additional studying
they find that it is not only unfeasible, it&#8217;s the totally wrong
approach. Diplomacy is a game with imperfect information, without
this characteristic there could be no lying. There is no lying in
chess or in any other game with perfect information for that matter.
So the first thing you need to do when making a Diplomacy AI is to
look beyond the traditional approaches made for perfect information
games.</p>
<p> One game with imperfect information which involves a lot of lying
besides Diplomacy is Poker, and recent progress in this area have
produced AI's with near perfect play. I find that very inspiring!
Those papers, together with what has been published on Diplomacy AI&#8217;s
from the community, have been a tremendous asset in the development.
With all this said though, we would not want your readers to harvest
expectations that the first AI we make will beat them in a fair fight.
To guarantee that any player can get a challenge out of playing versus
our AI we will allow the player to subtly tilt the table in the computers
favour. One way to do this is to change the initial bias against the
human player, however any such tricks will be clearly stated and it
will be possible to turn it off.</p>
<p> Yes, the AI will be able to act as a stand-in. </p>
<p> Yes, DATC was a tremendous asset when we wrote our turn resolution
engine. We have made each of the tests there into a unit test for
it, have followed the recommendations there and apply the Szykmans
rule to resolve convoy paradoxes. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #7 (Assumes a &#8220;yes&#8221; for answer #5)<br>
Will the game support any variants? If so, will they be of your own
creation, or will ones that others have created?</strong></p>
<p><strong> Assuming that there will be variants, will there be things
like:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Different Rule Sets</strong></li>
<li><strong> Variable Strength Units</strong></li>
<li><strong> Different Unit Types</strong></li>
<li><strong> Advancing Technology</strong></li>
<li><strong> Different Map Sets</strong></li>
<li><strong> Economic Rules (example the Payola Variant)</strong></li>
<li><strong> Different Forms of Press</strong></li>
<li><strong> The ability to mix and match the above</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer #7:<br>
I'd prefer to wait with this question; we are still deciding exactly
which variants and what will be supported. Priority for us in the
development is to get the standard game as good as possible before
touching the variants.</p>
<p align="center"><br>
<strong><font size="5">"Game Play/Player Matching/Community"</font></strong></p>
<p><br>
<strong>Question #8<br>
Will the game support single player, multiplayer (MP), or both? Is
the game focus on one more then the other? What I mean by that is
that will most players get more enjoyment out the game in multiplayer
(MP) mode or single player? </strong></p>
<p>Answer #8<br>
It will support both. In its essence Diplomacy is always multiplayer,
but sometimes all the other players are AI&#8217;s. What a player
prefers depends on what they are looking for. I think many will use
it to play a relaxing game versus AI&#8217;s that they can play any
time they want and while the AI&#8217;s do get upset when you stab
them in the back they cannot quite cause the professional dilemma
you get when you know you must stab your boss in the back to win the
game ;-).</p>
<p> I also think many people new to Diplomacy will start by enjoying
the game in single player and then move on to the multiplayer arena.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #9<br>
If there are multi-player modes what are they?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> One computer, probably to be used by a GM?</strong></li>
<li><strong> Multiple computers connecting to a MP service?</strong></li>
<li><strong> Is there GM role needed or available if wanted? (related
to question #10 and maybe better suited there).</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer #9<br>
We will support LAN play and Internet play through a matchmaking service
we are developing. We will not support &quot;hot-seat&quot; as we
are not very partial to this way of playing Diplomacy, however you
will be able to use the program as an adjudicator support tool through
our sandbox-mode.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #10<br>
Assuming an MP service in the prior question, will the service provide
support for:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Tournament play</strong></li>
<li><strong> Ladders</strong></li>
<li><strong> Stratified game &quot;advertisements&quot; like 'rookies
only,' 'no rookies,' etc.?</strong></li>
<li><strong> Rating systems</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer #10<br>
Yes, we plan to have support for all the things mentioned above. Finding
the right opponents at the right time is one thing where Internet
shines and as community software has shown, is reason enough in itself
to bring the board game to the computer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #11<br>
Can there be &quot;observers&quot; to MP games? Meaning, can others
watch a game being played?</strong></p>
<p>Answer #11<br>
Again, I'd prefer to wait with this question. At this stage I can
say that you will be able to have a complete log of everything said
and done in a game after it is finished, whether or not we will allow
observers during real time is still undecided.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #12<br>
Will Paradox establish some form of community (other than its forum)
that provides &quot;advice&quot; for players?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Articles on strategy and tactics</strong></li>
<li><strong> Opening moves libraries</strong></li>
<li><strong> Chat rooms</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer #12<br>
Actually we will not establish one but THREE different channels for
the player community. <br>
We will have a Diplomacy home page where official information about
the game and its development will be published, then we will have
the multiplayer match-making service and finally we have the Paradox
forums where we hope to see as much activity and community cooperation
as we have for our other games. Naturally these will all be closely
linked to each other and we will also continue to refer the players
to the existing Diplomacy communities.</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p><strong>Question #13<br>
Will there be a &#8220;God&#8221; mode? This would allow a player
to set and study &#8220;what if&#8221; game situations.</strong></p>
<p>Answer #13<br>
Yes, we call this mode &quot;sandbox-mode&quot; and it allows the
advanced player to play out various what-ifs as well as changing the
set-up by adding or removing units.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #14<br>
Will it have the ability to save a game in progress, and resume it
at a later time? Will this just be available for both single player
and multiplayer? Perhaps even allowing replacement players? </strong></p>
<p>Answer #14<br>
Besides a simple YES on the question if we will support save/reload,
we are looking into ways to arrange designated backup human replacement
players (in addition to your AI standing), especially for long-term
games.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #15<br>
Will the game support Play By Email (PBEM), so that players who want
to play with your game, but not have to sit down for hours at a time,
can play? </strong></p>
<p><strong> If it does support PBEM, will it support the Njudge and
DPjudge format?<br>
</strong><strong>If it does support PBEM, will it allow storage of
game turns with map history and correspondence?</strong></p>
<p>Answer #15<br>
Yes. We call this &quot;long term games&quot; as they are played over
several weeks rather than over a few hours. We will not be using any
existing protocol for the communication as we want to allow the player
to communicate using our graphical negotiation language. Instead of
sending each other e-mails, players will connect to our meta-server
and download negotiation messages and upload new suggestions and their
orders any time they want to.</p>
<p> If the game was set up that way all this communication will be stored
and once the game is finished you will have a complete log of the
game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #16<br>
What type of graphical modes will be there to show the map? </strong></p>
<p>Answer #16<br>
We will show the map in 3D. This actually give the players a better
overview than a simple top-down (we do allow the camera to be moved
into a strict top-down view for those who insist on this) and it will
also allow us to use the height dimension to draw the arrows regarding
negotiation in a way that allows for several simultaneous negotiations
to be shown at once without cluttering each other.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #17<br>
Will there be multiple &quot;windows&quot; for communication with
other players? ( I.E. one window per opponent + perhaps a broadcast
window + perhaps a &quot;diary&quot; window)</strong></p>
<p>Answer #17<br>
All communication will take place on the same map, but you will be
able to toggle on and off what you are currently seeing. Think of
it as a map with several transparent plastic sheets, each one where
you draw suggestions directed to a particular player or a particular
group of players, you then select which ones you want to show at the
same time. The negotiation language will be graphical with textual
communication optional for human players.</p>
<p><br>
<br>
<strong>Question #18<br>
Will there be the ability to print maps</strong>?</p>
<p>Answer #18<br>
No, we are currently not planning for such a feature, other than through
screen capture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question #19<br>
Will communication be written, graphical, or a combination of both?
I am assuming that for an AI to work that you will either have pull
downs for phrases or graphic pictures to represent deals or communication.
This would also allow players of different languages to play against
each other.</strong></p>
<p>Answer #19<br>
Mostly graphical. We will support flexible textual communication for
human players but using that feature will severely handicap any AI
playing in that game. Just as people today sometimes choose to play
limited press games we think many will play our game with only graphical
communication, it puts focus on strategy, eliminate language barriers
and makes for a quicker game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>&#8220;Modifications&#8221;</strong></font></p>
<p><br>
<strong>Question #20<br>
Paradox has historically made their games very modifiable by their
community while the Diplomacy community has extensively modified Diplomacy.
Will the game be modifiable, and to what extent?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Ability to create maps</strong></li>
<li><strong> If there is an AI, control files to allow modification</strong></li>
<li><strong> Special Rules</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Answer #20<br>
Yes, we strive to make the game as modifiable as possible. This means
we are using accessible formats for our map and data-files. AI's will
be modifiable both though parameters and in a more fundamental way
through an API. Regarding changing the rules I don't see us supporting
that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Well that's it! I hope you enjoyed reading this as much as I did
putting this together. I believe this is a very exciting project and
am looking forward to it's release. I have to say that when I first
heard of the project and was reading the information that was available
in the forums, I was worried and had my doubts. I lot of those doubts
have gone away. But more importantly, I hope this article helped to
answer a lot of questions you all had.</p>
