<dd>It's been a long winter and a longer spring. It's time for the spring ?!?
issue. Well here it is. This issue might look light, but it's got content,
with my faviourite being the interview with Paradox Interactive. As well,
we have a question within these page that we'd like you to answer. Sit back,
relax and dig in.</dd>

</dt>
<dd>In working, as always, to further the Diplomacy hobby throughout the globe,
and come up with new and exciting ways to play, Edi Birsan has provided us
with yet another variant, this one involving the more diplomatic formalities
of international relations.</dd>

<dd>One can never have too many Diplomacy variants. That's my motto, and I'm
always thrilled to meet other people who share it. So, naturally, it is with
pleasure that I introduce this article, detailing two new variants, Punic
Wars and Australian Diplomacy. Based on Sail Ho! and Five Italies (though
you wouldn't know it to look at them), these are ingenious pieces of work,
with some very attractive artwork.</dd>

<p><b> <a href="Vonpowell/EOG.html"><img src="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif" border="0" height="45" hspace="5" width="45"></a></a>
<i>Baron VonPowell &amp; Charles Roburn:</i> <a href="Vonpowell/EOG.html">Monte
Carlo</a></b></p>
</dt>
<dd>Proving yet again that jobs and families are no impediment to Diplomacy,
the Baron has sent us what is by far the largest article ever published in
these venerable pages. It is the EOG of the Russian player from a 1900 game
Baron hosted, and well worth its thirty-six pages.</dd>

<p><b> <a href="Paradox/Interview.html"><img src="../../Zine/Common/Article.gif" border="0" height="45" hspace="5" width="45"></a></a>
<i>Scott Webster :</i> <a href="Paradox/Interview.html">Paradox Interactive
Interview!!</a></b></p>
</dt>
<dd>Paradox Interactive, a computer game development company, has begun work
on a new Diplomacy computer game. Our own Scott Webster, with the help of
the Diplomatic Council and our readers, sent a list of questions to Paradox,
that we believed would be of the most interest to Diplomacy players. Paradox
graciously answered every question, and we have the interview for you here.</dd>

<dd>Letters, letters, letters! Our mailbox has been overflowing with the deluge
of letters coming in. Why, in the past month since we published the last issue,
we've gotten three letters!!! Ok, so we have a really small mailbox, and it's
easy to overflow it. But the point is, we've gotten a few letters, all well
worth reading. So, thank you, letter-writers! And to the rest of you, don't
be afraid to write us! We love getting your comments, observations, and ideas.<br>
