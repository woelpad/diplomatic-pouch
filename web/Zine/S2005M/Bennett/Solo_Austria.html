<span style="font-weight: bold;">Preface to the Solo by Numbers Series</span>
</big>
<br>
<br>
Success in Diplomacy involves three distinct, though interrelated,
elements: strategy, tactics and negotiation. A solo victory necessarily
requires attention to, and success with, all three elements. Although
strength in one area can compensate for weakness in another, few solos
have arisen without all three. The Solo by Numbers series presents
statistics from 100 solo victories of each power from 1901 through
1906, with some additional data from the games' final turns. The aim
is to reveal the broad strategic trends which characterize solo wins.
Many results will be instantly recognized by experienced players,
but there are plenty of interesting nuggets to discover. <br>
<br>
The tactical value of statistics drawn from game summaries drops off
dramatically after 1901. While it is a reasonable assumption that
Russian control of Sweden in 1901 is tied to the frequency of German
F Den-Swe (or Russian F Bot-Bal) that Fall, control in 1902 could
be based on any number of things - tactical cooperation with Germany
or England, a 1901 build in St. Petersburg, an Russian Northern opening,
etc. To varying degrees, the same goes for Italian control of Trieste,
Russian control of Rumania, or English control of Belgium. After 1901,
the diplomatic and tactical variables grow too numerous to reliably
draw any one conclusion. <br>
<br>
Statistics may influence diplomatic decisions, but they don't reflect
them very well. Game summaries alone cannot answer questions like:
how often are solos born of irreconcilable differences among the losing
powers which render late game alliances impossible? How many solos
result from a player surrendering to the solo power to spite another
player? How often did one player's failure to send press come into
play? One power controlling another power's home centers is an unambiguous
sign of hostilities, but it doesn't tell us anything about the diplomacy
that led up to those hostilities. That, as it goes, is why they play
the game. <br>
<br>
The statistics presented in this series are most effective at portraying
the grand strategic picture which predominated in each power's solo
victories. The overall results of the soloists and corresponding losers
can imply many things about tactics and diplomacy, but the ultimate
value lies in the big picture of the soloists' victories. Which Western
power did Turkey prefer to do well? When Russia wins, what happens
to Italy and France? What expansion paths did each power tend to take?
Answers to questions like these present a picture of the broad trends
which characterize solo victories by each power. What diplomatic and
tactical conclusions can be drawn from these results are up to the
reader to infer. In my comments I have encapsulated some of the inferences
I see, but I'm sure others will see different and additional things.
<br>
<br>
The games selected were mostly played from 1999 through 2003, with
the exception of Russian solos (1997-2000) which were collected in
2000. Game summaries were drawn from the collections available through
Doug Massey's JDPR page. Each game has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li> White, partial press.</li>
<li> The victor captured 18 centers to win the game.</li>
<li> The game was played on a standard map, with standard rules.</li>
<li> No anomaly flags.</li>
<li> Movement deadlines of at least 24 hours.</li>
</ul>
<p> This series grew out of an effort to duplicate for Russia Derek
McLachlin's "A Study of Italian Wins on the Judges". Without that
article this project would never have been attempted. </p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<big> <span style="font-weight: bold;">An Introduction to the Charts</span>
</big>
<br>
</p>
<p><em>Source of the Averages:</em> In most charts, the value found for
the given power's solo games is compared against an "average" value.
This average is simply the result of combining all 700 solo wins together.
These doubtlessly are not pure averages - at the very least, the powers
that solo the least often overall, Italy and probably also Austria,
will appear stronger than they actually are in truly average games.
A quick comparison of these 1901 averages against those found in The
Scribe's "A Statistical Look at 1901" confirms this. However, this
impure average still provides a useful way to see the numbers from
another angle, and assists tremendously when comparing the results
of the different sets. In studying these results, I have found that
their full significance can only be appreciated when the results for
the different powers' solo wins are seen side-by-side. </p>
<p>Except for center count information, all values can be read as percentages.</p>
<p>This series will use four kinds of charts:</p>
<p><em>Average Center Counts 1901-1906:</em> This chart displays the
average number of centers owned by each power at the end of each of
the first six years, with change from previous year and difference
from average to assist in comparison. The aim of this chart is to
give as broad a picture as possible of the big game trends before
delving into a center-by-center analysis. These charts are especially
useful when comparing one power's solos against another's. "A Statistical
Look at 1901" provided the model for this chart. </p>
<p><em>Final Year Center Ownership, Soloing Power:</em> This chart gives
a quick look at how often each center was owned by the soloing power
at the end of the game. This can give some ideas about how the game
progressed after 1906. </p>
<p><em>Percent of Games Eliminated:</em> As the name implies, this chart
simply tells how often each non-soloing power was eliminated. Center
Ownership, by Power, 1901-1906: Each power's center ownership from
1901-1906, with differential from the average. Where both actual and
average values were null they have been deleted so the charts can
be read more easily. In the interest of easing comparisons, each power's
chart is the same. </p>
<p><em>Center Ownership, by Power, 1901-1906:</em> Each power's center
ownership from 1901-1906, with differential from the average. Where
both actual and average values were null they have been deleted so
the charts can be read more easily. In the interest of easing comparisons,
each power's chart is the same.</p>

<big> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commentary:</span></big>
<br>
</p>
<p>The vast majority of articles addressing Austria strategy agree on several points.  Early on, non-aggression with
Italy and Germany is universally recommended.  This allows Austria to focus on the more immediate menace of a
potential Juggernaut.  Few authors recommend allying with Turkey, for the simple reason that Turkey will always
have a superior position from which to stab.  This leaves as Austria's only options either an alliance with Russia
or at least a deft splitting of the Russo-Turkish relationship at least until Austria can control the Balkans.
The authorities are mixed as to whether a Lepanto-style alliance with Italy is advisable, given the risk of encirclement
by Russia and Italy once Turkey is defeated.  As for the west, geography dictates that England is Austria's natural ally.  </p>
<p>Table 1 strongly supports these general principles.  Turkey was by far the weakest power in the game, on
average being on the verge of elimination going into 1907, and eliminated in almost every game.  Russia
meantime was slightly weaker than average and Italy slightly stronger, though both were eliminated more often.
The center-by-center tables will provide illustrations of how Turkey's demise benefited each of the other three
eastern powers.  Given the difficulties of breaking into Turkey alone, Austria certainly needed help to achieve
such dominance over Turkey in the early to mid-game.  </p>
<p>It makes sense that Austria's 1901 results would be substantially better than average.  After a Spring and
Fall of paranoia at home and pity (or lust) abroad, two builds can turn Austria into a major power overnight.
At the very least two builds can give Austria leverage over a hostile Russia, who suddenly cannot count on an easy
time getting across the Gal-Rum border.</p>
<p>Of the non-soloing powers, only England consistently grew relative to average, which along with England's
low rate of elimination confirms England's status as Austria's natural ally.  Where England is strong Germany
is less likely to have an effective response to a late Austrian attack, and France less likely to have fleets
deep into the Mediterranean.  English results were generally stronger than Germany's in the early going,
suggesting English dominance of Scandinavia (possibly with Russian help?) earlier than normal.  French
interests would traditionally be attacked in Belgium early and Brest, Spain and Portugal somewhat later.
This may explain why France shows increasing decline from 1904.  This bears-out the traditional doctrine
that Austria and France are inherently opposed to one-another in the long-run.  However, it also shows that
an over-strong Germany is probably not in Austria's best interests.</p>
<p>	Chart 3.  Austrian Center Ownership (Austrian Solos)</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<big> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commentary:</span></big>
<br>
</p>
<p>Early game, 1901-1902:  To be successful, Austria must first overcome its inherent weaknesses.  Although Hedgehog
openings can provide security against a combined attack by Italy, Russia and Turkey, the results of these games imply
that it was more likely for Austria to have come to some diplomatic understanding in the early going to get out of its
bad starting position, rather than tactical tricks alone.</p>
<p>It should come as no surprise that Austria's control of the four Balkan centers (Serbia, Greece, Rumania and
Bulgaria) was substantially higher than average in 1901-1902 for each center.  Turkey's overall weakness
shown in Table 1 is already partially explained by a much higher incidence of Austrian control of Greece
and Bulgaria.  Meantime, and again without surprise, Austrian home centers were rarely captured immediately.</p>
<p>Finally, while a handful of soloists captured Venice early on, it is clear that an early eastern (or,
from Austria's perspective, southern) strategy was the overwhelming preference.  This indicates a high
incidence of at least nonaggression with Italy, though Austrian control of Bulgaria and Greece could each
be explained, at least partially, by active alliance with Italy.</p>
<p>Early to Mid-Game, 1903-1906:   By 1903 Austria controlled all the Balkan centers at least half the time.
From this base of strength, four routes of expansion become available: first, an attack against Russia in
Warsaw and Sevastapol; second, an attack (with necessary allied support) against Turkish home centers;
third, a shift to a western campaign aiming to control Italy; or fourth, an immediate campaign against
Germany.  The results show no overwhelmingly favored route in 1904, though an attack of Germany (Munich)
was clearly disfavored.   Control of an Italian center (Venice), Russian center (Warsaw) and Turkish
center (Constantinople) each occurred about a third of the time.  Given Turkey's overall weakness, it
follows that regardless of which path Austria chose at this juncture, someone often continued to
attack Turkey at home.</p>
<p>The values for 1906 indicate that an attack against Russia was probably the most common route (Sevastapol 59%),
though no absolutes can be drawn.  Control of Sevastapol is a natural continuation from Rumania.  Elsewhere,
attacks into Turkey and Italy occurred with equal frequency.  Only the German attack remained steadily lower.
A look at the final year centers controlled by Austria can shed some light on how things might have developed
from this point forward.</p>
<p>Chart 4.  Austrian Centers in Final Year of Solo Victory</p>
<p>The Austrian core centers, consisting of the home centers and the Balkans, make up the top 8.  The next ten
centers include all of Italy and Turkey, with Russia contributing all but St. Petersburg and Germany surrendering
Munich.  The capture of Tunis in over half the games, and reasonably frequent control of Spain and Marseilles,
shows that many soloists avoided the error of neglecting to build enough fleets for the late game.  It is
reasonable to assume that capturing Tunis this often could not be accomplished without an adequate fleet to
counter Italy, France and/or England.  It is probably also reasonable to assume that Tunis was captured fairly
late in the going.  All 18 of the top centers are on the eastern side of the major stalemate line except Munich.</p>
<p>The bottom 16 centers represent increasingly more radical approaches, until English centers are
falling to a presumably sea-based Austria.</p>

<br>
<br>
<big> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commentary for the West:</span></big>
<br>
</p>
<p>As Chart 1 shows, England is the strongest Western power overall.  There appear to have been two
primary sources for this.  First, ownership of Scandinavian centers was significantly higher than
normal (with a corresponding decrease in German and especially Russian influence).  Secondly, though
less dramatically, English control of the Lowland countries saw a solid up-tick.  Successful attacks
against Germany (Denmark, Kiel) were slightly more frequent than successful conquest of Brest, and were
also substantially above average.  Perhaps Austria should favor English dominance of Scandinavia, and
an Anglo-French alliance against Germany?  If so, only slightly.</p>
<p>France was on-par with average, with the notable exceptions of Iberia and invasions of England.
The combination of Italian and English pressure on Iberia must explain why French control begins to
slip off the average by 1906.    The relative strength of England in these games would naturally suggest
less frequent invasions by France.  Although French control of Belgium was fairly average, control of
Holland fell short of normal.  The one glimmer of light for France is a slightly better showing against
Italy, especially for control of Tunis.  I suspect the rarity of French penetration beyond Tunis
reflected in the averages arises from Italian and Turkish solos accounting for almost a third of the data set.</p>
<p>Germany was also close to average, except in Scandinavia where England dominated more frequently.   Note
the difference between German and English control of St. Petersburg.</p>

<br>
<br>
<big> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Commentary for the East:</span></big>
<br>
</p>
<p>Because this article deals with the Austrian solo, I have included Italy among the Eastern powers.</p>
<p>Turkey's decline now comes into better focus.  Italy's role was higher than average across the board,
especially in Smyrna.  Russia captured Ankara about a quarter of the time by 1905, the strongest evidence
of a Russo-Austrian alliance.   By 1906 Turkey controlled each of its home centers only about a third of
the time.  This is partly explained by an increase in Italian control of those centers, but as Chart 3
shows, it mostly has to do with an Austrian invasion of Turkey proper.  How could Austria dominate Turkish
home centers while the two powers which could help it, Russia and Italy, take so much less of a role?
Sharpen those knives.</p>
<p>Italy attacked France at Marseilles and Iberia more frequently than average.  This further helps explain
why France was relatively weak.  In contrast, Italian control of Greece was always lower than average,
conceding ground to Austria.   In fact, while Italy controlled Marseilles and Spain about a third of
the time in 1906, the Turkish centers were controlled less than a quarter of the time.  It would
make sense for Austria to prefer a western-oriented Italy, since getting units facing off against
France in the West not only contains France but leaves Italy that much more exposed for a stab at
some point (in Chart 2, this looks like it's as early as 1903).</p>
<p>Although in 1901 Russia captured Rumania and Sweden at an average pace, it tended to not keep
control for long, as England began to dominate.  Not surprisingly, Russia's control of Balkan centers
past Rumania was a generally rare event.</p>
<p>
<br>
<br>
<big> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Final Thoughts</span></big>
<br>
</p>
<p>Comparing the results of one power's solos against those of others can clarify the significance of
different results.  If England does well when Austria wins, does the opposite also hold true?  The answer
is yes, and then some.  In English solos Austria was still eliminated about half the time (this is still
Austria, after all), but through 1906 it controlled about half a center more than average each year.
Conversely, in Russian solo wins Austria fared very poorly (averaging about 2 centers per year by 1906,
with the highest elimination rate in the game (82%).  Hopefully as other installments of this series arrive
at the Pouch, readers will be able to draw their own conclusions.</p>
<p>Ultimately the statistics for Austria point to a diplomatically strenuous game.  Control of Rumania,
Bulgaria and Greece much of the time in 1904 indicates no small amount of conflict with all the Eastern powers.
Preventing a grand anti-Austrian alliance from arising out of such conditions is perhaps the greatest single
challenge these soloists overcame.</p>
