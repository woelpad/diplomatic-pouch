Often we find ourselves after a morning/afternoon session of standard
Diplomacy without enough time for a second full round and the various
forms of Escalation, Wilson and Gunboat are used to fill the void. <p>
One variant that works well with Wilson Diplomacy (where all discussions
are at the table and in the open in five minute rounds) is to have
what I call Formal Diplomacy.</p>
<p> Each player has in front of him two areas to hold other player&#8217;s
pieces or equivalent chits, or you can just write it down on a piece
of paper: one area for countries they are at war with and the other
for countries that they are allied with. All other countries they
are neutral towards.</p>
<p> The formal relationship between the powers dictates what you may
or may not do to each other under each of the various states of hostility.
It also is a nice way to do away with such awkward problems as the
unwanted convoy, screwing up an intended self bounce by supporting
what amounts to your enemy&#8217;s piece against himself, as well
as some other awkwardness of those who like to see things a little
closer to the historic norms. This still allows for sudden stabs and
declarations of war, but it does give a more Formalistic Patter to
the game.</p>
<p> <strong>Restrictions are as follows:</strong></p>
<p><strong><em>For Allied Powers</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Move: </strong>You can move through their home provinces
and their owned provinces. You cannot dislodge their units under
any circumstances.</li>
<li> <strong>Support:</strong> You can receive and give support for
each other&#8217;s pieces. If you move on a province that is occupied
by them and that issued support, however, you do not cut support,
just as you cannot dislodge them.</li>
<li> <strong>Convoy:</strong> You can convoy each other&#8217;s armies.</li>
<li> <strong>Centers:</strong> Ifyou occupy your allies&#8217; center
you do NOT take control of it from them.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><em>For at Neutral Powers</em></strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Move:</strong> You cannot move to a province that contains
their piece. You can order there in the hope that they are successful
in moving out, but your movement there is void and treated as a
hold if the neutral does not move. You cannot enter a neutral power&#8217;s
home country or any of his owned supply centers. You can both move
to an un-owned supply center, province (North Africa and Albania
are the only un-owned non-supply centers) or sea province and bounce
each other there but not dislodge the other. Example: Germany <br>
is neutral towards France. France orders Burgundy to Belgium (un-owned)
and Germany moves Ruhr to Belgium supported by Holland. Then Germany
gets in since no one was dislodged and Belgium was un-owned to begin
with. </li>
<li><strong>Support:</strong> You cannot cut the support of a neutral
piece since you cannot move into their occupied space. You cannot
issue support for a neutral power&#8217;s piece.</li>
<li> <strong>Convoy: </strong>You cannot convoy a neutral power&#8217;s
army.</li>
<li> <strong>Ownership:</strong> You cannot enter, let alone take,
a neutral power&#8217;s supply center.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em><strong>For Powers at War</strong></em></p>
<ul>
<li><strong> Move:</strong> You can move on any of their pieces anywhere
even if that would mean moving on a neutral power&#8217;s home area
if it is occupied by a piece of the designated enemy. This way a
neutral cannot set up a sanctuary for your enemy.</li>
<li><strong> Support:</strong> You cannot support a piece of a power
that you are at war with.</li>
<li><strong> Convoy:</strong> You cannot convoy an enemy&#8217;s army</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<strong>Declarations:</strong><br>
At the end of the 5 minutes of negotiations BEFORE the writing of
orders, all Declarations are written down in secret and then exposed.
Declaration of Alliance must be made in conjunction with the other
power for them to be effective. Declarations of War are unilateral.
A state of Neutrality is the automatic default for countries neither
at war nor allied to each other. During any Declaration period, an
Alliance member may break the alliance unilaterally. It takes mutual
consent to end a War. Declaring Neutrality or Alliance may do this.
Even if these declarations are mismatched the default then applies
and the countries are neutral towards each other.</p>
<p><strong>Neutrality violations:</strong><br>
Any unit that is in violation of neutrality at the end of the movement
phase is interned by the neutral power and disbanded.</p>
<p><strong>Home Non-Supply Center provinces:</strong><br>
All the powers have non-supply center Home owned provinces:<br>
England: Clyde, Yorkshire and Wales<br>
France: Burgundy, Picardy, Gascony<br>
Germany: Ruhr, Prussia and Silesia<br>
Austria: Tyrolia, Bohemia and Galicia<br>
Italy: Apulia, Piedmont and Tuscany,<br>
Russia: Finland, Livonia and the Ukraine<br>
Turkey: Syria and Armenia</p>
<p> These provinces are considered owned by the original power unless
they do not have an equal or greater number of owned home supply centers
adjacent to it compared with enemy occupied home centers. Example:
Russia occupies Berlin. Prussia is now considered part of Russia while
Silesia is considered part of Germany as long as Germany owns Munich.</p>
<p> Albania and North Africa are always considered neutral provinces
when not occupied.</p></td>
