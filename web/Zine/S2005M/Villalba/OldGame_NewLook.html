            <br>
            I am a frequent reader of the 'Zine, and I find especially interesting 
            those articles related to variants. However, I realized that I don't 
            get so interested on the variants themselves, but on their maps: from 
            the one in the Classical variant to those whose shape changes over 
            time (as in those where the water level increases and some land provinces 
            become sea spaces). <br>
            <br>
            So that is why I decided to focus on them, rather than on creating 
            new variants. <br>
            <br>
            Also, digging into the resources page of the Pouch, I found an excellent 
            programme that helps you create your own variant maps. The maps created 
            with it were not particularly attractive, but the underlying idea 
            of the software was: a map is simply a network of "nodes", where each 
            node is a land or sea space. This was what I needed to know in order 
            to engage in creating maps. <br>
            <br>
            Why? Well, a usual problem with variants is that their "playability" 
            is not evident from the outset, and so a period of play-testing is 
            required. As I said, I am not so interested in creating new variants 
            as in creating new maps, and so I wanted to minimize the need of playtesting. 
            So, what should I do? I've always been a rather lazy boy, so I found 
            the optimal solution: create maps for already existing variants! <br>
            <br>
            You are just thinking: "What? Why create a map for a variant that 
            already has one?!!" Well, the idea is not (as) stupid as it sounds. 
            What I thought is: there are several variants where their maps are 
            fantasy ones. I'm not saying they're not good maps, but I prefer those 
            based on historical or geographical grounds, as they lead (at least 
            in my case) to an extra involvement with the game: I find it more 
            amusing to be Attila the Hun or Napoleon than the commander of an 
            unheard of power on an unrecognizable planet. <br>
            <br>
            So, what I needed to do was simply: 1. Find a variant with a fantasy 
            map, 2. Find a geographic area that could resemble it, 3. Find a period 
            where several warring parties fought in that area, and finally 4. 
            Draw the map (technically speaking, I am just drawing a new map that 
            is topologically identical to the original one). <br>
            <br>
            I am not going to bore you with all the steps in each case. I am just 
            going to show you the maps I drew, and will mention the variant that 
            inspired me. I hope you like it. <br>
            <br>

            <big> <span style="font-weight: bold;">Punic wars</span> </big> <br>
            <br>
            Based on the Sail Ho! variant, the map shows the Italian peninsula, 
            Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily and the north of Africa. The four powers 
            are Romans, Etruscans, Carthaginians and Greeks (North, West, South 
            and East respectively). <br>
            <br>
            I just renamed the land and sea spaces, and designed army and fleet 
            icons that reflect the period (circa 200 BC). <br>
            <br>
            The good thing about this map is that the variant was playtested for 
            a long period, and it works well (the map is based on the revised 
            Sail Ho! map), so every strategic analysis of the Sail Ho! powers 
            is also applicable to the powers of Punic Wars <br>
            <br>

            </big> <br>
            <br>
            Based on the "5 Italies" variant, the map shows Australia, New Zealand, 
            Tasmania, Malaysia and Papua-New Guinea. However, I reduced the number 
            of players to only four, that I named Tasmans (south), Kiwis (east), 
            Papuans (north) and Malays (west). I don't know much about Australian 
            history, so I invented the powers based only on geographical considerations. 
            <br>
            <br>
            As an a-priori assessment, and though not exactly identical to the 
            "5 Italies" variant, this map is "part of the family" of perfectly 
            balanced symmetric games. <br>
