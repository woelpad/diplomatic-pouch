<p><em>[Editor's Note: Although this might seem like a daunting article
to read, that is not the case. Here is a trick I do. I skim the article,
reading the intro, then move on to looking at all the maps and the
general flow of the game. I then went back and read the article fully.
It made it more enjoyable and it didn't seem so long then. ]</em></p>
<p>I have always wanted to include a demonstration game in the Gamers&#8217;
Guide to <strong>1900</strong>. My inspiration for this idea came
from the two versions of The Gamers&#8217; Guide to <strong>Diplomacy</strong>,
both of which contained demonstration games. I felt these demonstration
games contributed a lot to the reader&#8217;s understanding of how
<strong>Diplomacy</strong> is played. The primary problem I had was
finding a good game to write about. As luck would have it, the perfect
game fell right into my lap. This game was 1900 040414/Monte Carlo,
a contest played via e-mail. It had many things going for it. It was
not too long or too short, it was generally well played, and it was
special because it was the first recorded Russian solo in a <strong>1900</strong>
game. What made it ideal for my purposes was the fact that the Tsar,
Charles Roburn, provided an incredibly detailed account of the game
from Russia&#8217;s perspective. I would barely have to write a thing!
Instead, I could simply use Charles&#8217;s comments nearly verbatim
to describe the ebb and flow of the war from start to finish. What
more could a lazy editor ask for? </p>
<p> Charles provides us with what I think are fascinating insights on
how he balanced Russia&#8217;s priorities against the priorities of
the other Great Powers, allies and enemies alike. As we all know,
a player&#8217;s ability to pursue his own goals without alienating
other players to the point where they will no longer work with him
is one of the great challenges of <strong>Diplomacy</strong>. Clearly
the final result, a Russian solo, showed that he navigated this potentially
dangerous path quite ably. The journey was not always an easy one,
however.<br>
<br>
In the article that follows, Charles&#8217;s comments are in italic,
while my own are in regular script. This article should find its way
into the Gamers&#8217; Guide to <strong>1900</strong> soon, perhaps
even before you read it here. Enjoy!</p>

<p align="center"><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font size="5">The
Players</font></span> </big> <br>
</p>
<p align="left"> <br>
<strong>Austria-Hungary:</strong> Robert Stein. Robert was a veteran
of many 1900 campaigns on USDP Judge. In seven 1900 games that started
prior to this contest, he had soloed as France, Italy, and Turkey;
and he had managed a 3-way as Britain. Since Robert had played every
Power except Austria-Hungary, it seemed appropriate to assign him
the Dual Monarchy this time around. While Robert didn&#8217;t object
too strenuously, he did have reservations about playing a predominantly
land power. This is because he enjoyed fleet maneuvers and didn&#8217;t
expect to have much of a navy in this game.</p>
<p align="left"><strong>Britain</strong>: Mike Oliveri. Mike had never
played 1900 before, but he was hardly a rookie. On the contrary,
he had a long history of involvement in the Diplomacy hobby. I met
Mike while we were both serving as officers in the AOL Diplomacy
Club and I was anxious to get him into one of my games. After turning
me down several times, he finally agreed to play in this contest.
His primary concern was grasping the new dynamics 1900 offered as
quickly as possible, particularly since 1900&#8217;s Britain would
clearly play very differently from Diplomacy&#8217;s England.</p>
</div>
<p><strong>France:</strong> Jerry (JT) Fest. JT was another 1900 veteran
with a proud record of success. In four 1900 games that started prior
to this one, JT had secured a solo as Germany (the Reich&#8217;s first
recorded solo in a 1900 game), a rare 2-way as Austria-Hungary, and
a 3-way as Italy. JT&#8217;s involvement in 1900 went far beyond simply
playing it, however. Almost from the beginning, he was actively involved
in discussions concerning the development of the variant, and his
support and contributions over time were invaluable. JT had never
played France before, so this would be his opportunity to shine as
the President.</p>
<p><strong>Germany:</strong> George Collins. George had played 1900
twice before, once as Britain and once as Italy, but in both of those
games he had entered as a replacement. This was going to be his first
opportunity to actually start a game. While George had been successful
in those earlier games, with a 4-way as Britain to his credit, he
wanted to try a new more aggressive approach to negotiating in this
contest. He felt the Reich provided him with an excellent tool with
which to experiment.</p>
<p><strong>Italy:</strong> Tiago Barros. Tiago was another player I
recruited from the ranks of USDP Judge subscribers. He had played
in three 1900 games on USDP Judge and had earned two 3-ways, one as
France and another as Russia. Originally from Portugal and living
in Finland at the time this game started, Tiago had to overcome two
obstacles. The first was that English was his second (or third!) language.
The second was that Tiago was several time zones ahead of the other
players. Given his strong performances in his other games, it seemed
unlikely to me that these disadvantages would handicap him too much.</p>
<p><strong>Russia:</strong> Charles Roburn. Charles, who hailed from
Canada, had played one game of 1900 previously. In that game, he had
enjoyed some initial success as Austria-Hungary, but had eventually
been overwhelmed and forced to settle for survival. Post game comments
from other players in that game suggested that Charles&#8217;s negotiating
style worked against him, so he, like George, was going to use a different
technique when having discussions with the other players. </p>
<p><strong>Turkey</strong>: Markus Kellner. Markus lived in Austria.
He had contacted me about playing in a 1900 game and had waited patiently
for months until a new game started. Of all the players in this game,
he was the one I knew the least about since I had not seen him in
any USDP Judge games or GM&#8217;d a game he had played in previously.
Given the quality and quantity of his correspondence, however, I was
not the least bit concerned that there would be any language or time
zone difficulties.</p>
<p>Now that the introductions are out of the way, let&#8217;s get to
the game.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><span style="font-weight: bold;"><font size="5">Introduction</font></span>
<br>
</p>
I&#8217;d like to start by thanking Baron for once again providing an
excellent gaming experience &#8211; it&#8217;s always a pleasure playing
in one of his games. I&#8217;d also like to thank all my fellow players
&#8211; the quality of the participants is one of the main reasons why
Baron&#8217;s games are so much fun! The fact that there were no replacements
or even NMRs throughout this entire game is a testament to everyone&#8217;s
exceptional commitment and reliability.<br>
I've been taking notes all along, so this End-of-Game report is, um,
kind of long -- even for me. I hope that everyone will find it interesting
in spite of its length!</p> <p> I started preparing for 040414 shortly
after accepting Baron&#8217;s invitation to play. I had played in
one previous game, 1900 030319, where I was the Archduke. That had
ended in a French solo (by Bill Leake) and saw Austria surviving with
4 SCs. I suppose it wasn&#8217;t too bad for a first try at 1900,
but this time I wanted to do better!</p>
<p> I wanted to win a solo this time round if I could, so I tried to
plan my general approach. I began by revisiting the Diplomatic Pouch
site and re-reading articles there. I then reviewed the End-of-Game
comments from 1900 030319. I hoped to remind myself of some of the
important general lessons I&#8217;d learned in that game and apply
them in 040414 regardless of the country I got (my thanks to Baron,
Chris Dziedzic, Bjoern Lengers, and Chris Pickrell in particular for
their comments on my play in that game).</p>
<p> The two 1900 games that I&#8217;d seen already were both solo wins
(by Bill Leake as France in 1900 030319 and Lynn Mercer as Germany
in 1900 030827). In both cases, the winner kept pace with one or two
main allies for most of the game (there were several draw proposals
in each). One ally was then attacked by a second (Germany in 1900
030319 was stabbed by my Austria, while Austria in 1900 030827 was
stabbed by Turkey [played by our own Jerry Fest]). In the ensuing
scuffle, the third ally managed to seize the prize. Clearly, this
is a good general pattern to follow. <br>
In both cases, the country stabbed had been situated in between the
winner and the stabber. Once I received my country assignment, I would
try to identify countries that would fit this pattern and start my
initial negotiations with this general long-term plan in mind. Failing
that, I would try to have two allies closer to each other than to
me, to facilitate their stabbing each other. At the very least, I
should make sure that I would never find myself sandwiched between
two &#8216;allies&#8217;, lest I get stabbed myself. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center">The View from St. Petersburg<br>
by <strong>Charles Roburn</strong></p>
<p align="center"> The Kaiser, Archduke, Sultan, King:<br>
These four are my good neighbors dear,<br>
Encircling Russia in a ring<br>
That fills my heart with dread and fear.</p>
<p align="center"> Monsieur and Pontiff, I will bet,<br>
Are safe. They can&#8217;t invade me&#8230;yet.<br>
And since we have no common borders<br>
I need not fear their armies&#8217; orders.</p>
<p align="center"> But from the rest I must find friends,<br>
For if I don&#8217;t, they&#8217;ll overwhelm<br>
My poor defenseless Russian realm,<br>
And then my dream of empire ends.</p>
<p align="center"> I must make choices. Which are wiser?<br>
The Sultan, Archduke, King, or Kaiser?</p>
<p>&nbsp; </p>
<p>When Baron told me that I would be the Tsar, I was actually quite
pleased. I studied some Russian in school and it&#8217;s the one European
country that I&#8217;ve actually visited for over a week. In regular
Diplomacy, Russia is one of my favorites and I had a number of theories
that I wanted to try out in 1900. Besides, Russia in 1900 had never
yet won a solo &#8211; quite a challenge! [Just to clarify, Russia
had not won a solo in any game that I had GM&#8217;d or observed.]</p>
<p>Looking at the board and considering my earlier analysis, I could
see that I would have a lot of options available to me. I could set
up a &#8216;sandwich&#8217; configuration with either Germany or Austria
in the middle, and France or Italy (or even Britain) on the other
side. Any of these combinations would set up the right configuration
for a Russian solo.</p>
<p>I could also encourage an F-I. Such an alliance was long overdue
in 1900 (according to Baron, it had NEVER been tried). From my point
of view it would be critical to ensure that France and Italy did not
come to blows early on or at least not until I was sure that I would
not be attacked by B-G-A-T. I needed France to be ready to help against
Britain and Germany, and Italy to help against Austria and Turkey.
So encouraging F-I non-aggression would almost certainly be a cornerstone
of my early policy. If that continued further into end game, so much
the better. I think Baron has done a good job of creating friction
between the two countries, so if they both continued to be my main
allies to the end, there would be a better likelihood of one stabbing
the other, which could lead to a Russian win.</p>
<p>First, though, I would have to keep from being eliminated by my four
neighbors! I was well aware of Russia&#8217;s poor performance to
date. In the short- to mid-term, I would need at least one ally in
the north and one in the south. I must choose between Britain and
Germany, and Austria and Turkey.</p>
<p>In the North, Britain seemed the better choice if I could manage
it. In both 1900 and Diplomacy, I&#8217;m amazed at how often Russia
and Britain seem to end up fighting very early in the game. In my
view this is potentially catastrophic for them both. I thought Germany
would be less comfortable as a long-term ally. The Kaiser poses far
more of a threat to Russia than the Prime Minister does in that he&#8217;s
closer and he has the armies required to invade and hold Warsaw and
Moscow. I was perfectly willing to give up Sweden to Britain to gain
British friendship, especially if that caused B-G conflict. </p>
<p align="center"><img src="1899.jpg" width="468" height="448"></p>
<p> In the South, I had a slight bias for an A-R. Austria could be a
big help against Turkey and especially Germany, while still being
able to expand west (or be hit from the west if needed).</p>
<p>Given my druthers, I would pick Britain and Austria over Germany
and Turkey. However, I would do my best to restrain my geopolitical
biases in favor of the players I found easiest to work with, since
that ultimately is much more important. I also knew that as Russia
I couldn&#8217;t afford many mistakes. I would probably be well served
by a careful and conservative playing style, at least at first, until
I had a good sense of what was going to happen overall. <br>
In the long term I hoped to be part of a triangle of some kind: F-I-R,
B-I-R, F-A-R, or F-R-T. Those seemed to me to offer the best chance
of a Russian win or draw. My eighteen centers would most likely come
from Russia (4), Germany (4), Austria (3), Turkey (3), and the Balkan
states (4), though these could be adjusted as the game developed,
particularly if I invaded Scandinavia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Spring 1900</strong></font></p>
<p>The starting gun went off. I immediately sent friendly messages to
all the others and waited to see how they would reply.</p>
<p>I saw that JT had been cast as President of France, which pleased
me since I&#8217;d had a chance to read his End-of-Game comments for
1900 030827 [in which JT survived as an 11 SC Turkey] and he seemed
like a possible ally. He was the first to reply to my message. Initially
he seemed a bit suspicious, but after I answered his questions I seemed
to pass the test, and we soon had fairly open communications between
us that lasted to the very end of the game. I still believe that between
us we accounted for over half of Baron&#8217;s 040414 related e-mail!
[Very true] We were soon discussing game-long plans and whom to approach
as the third member of a three-way alliance. We agreed that we would
see how things went before making any final decisions, but it seemed
that France and Russia would be solid allies throughout the game.
</p>
<p> The second to answer was Sultan Markus. I&#8217;d asked for DMZs
in Armenia and Black Sea, and casually suggested a bounce in Black
Sea. I didn&#8217;t seriously want one, but I did want to see how
he&#8217;d react. He very properly pointed out in the friendliest
way that the proposed bounce would guarantee two Balkan centers for
Austria, and he&#8217;d rather see me order F Sevastapol to Rumania
while he did F Ankara to Constantinople. It was exactly the kind of
reply I would have written myself. So I wrote back agreeing that a
bounce in Black Sea would be wasteful. I didn&#8217;t promise (yet)
to order F Sevastapol to Rumania, but I assured him that it was under
serious consideration. </p>
<p>To Germany I&#8217;d written asking for DMZs in Prussia and Silesia,
and telling Kaiser George that it would be most friendly for him to
let me take Sweden. His first reply made me uneasy. He said that he
had no objections on either point, but that he didn&#8217;t want to
make firm commitments before talking to everyone, since they could
be seen as provocative. I had a hard time seeing how DMZs in Prussia
and Silesia would be &#8216;provocative&#8217; unless he was hoping
to convince my neighbors to gang up on me! In the next paragraph,
he then suggested that we could get together to stomp on Austria.
Coming right after his cautious answer on the DMZs and Sweden, it
didn&#8217;t seem particularly sincere. However, I didn&#8217;t want
to discourage him so I responded positively and suggested that we
each take a few days to gauge everyone else before finalizing anything.
For some reason this seemed to make him defensive, but I tried not
to read too much into that.</p>
<p>I heard from Britain next. Prime Minister Mike responded very positively,
though I had the feeling that part of his message was a sort of form
letter. No matter&#8230;we seemed to get along well. He asked me not
to order A Moscow to St. Petersburg and I agreed at once. He also
spoke about a long-term B-R-T alliance. I wasn&#8217;t sure about
that and I was skeptical of his commitment to it, but it didn&#8217;t
seem worth the trouble to make a fuss about it at this stage. </p>
<p>Finally I heard from Austria. Archduke Robert was fairly blunt about
his conditions for an A-R. He insisted that I not move to Galicia,
that I let him have Serbia (no problem, it&#8217;s not like I could
prevent it!), and requested that I take Rumania with a fleet and support
him into Bulgaria afterward. At first this worried me, because the
direct tone reminded me of Germany&#8217;s blunt &#8216;no&#8217;
to my DMZ request. After re-reading Robert&#8217;s message, I decided
that it was actually a good sign that he was discussing specific terms
and commitments. We exchanged a few more messages. I suggested that
we talk about my going to Galicia, which he argued against extensively,
and I gave way. He then spoke strongly in favor of F Sevastapol to
Black Sea. I was reluctant, having already agreed with Turkey that
the bounce would be wasteful. I decided I might ask for (demand) a
bounce at the last minute, though.</p>
<p> I heard from Italy last of all. After so much silence I was afraid
my opening message had made Pope Tiago afraid to talk to me because
I&#8217;d asked him not to attack France when (it seemed) he was aiming
for a B-G-I. Still, I wanted to forge a good relationship with him
with an eye toward the mid-game. It turned out that his silence was
due to real-life concerns. When I did hear from him, Tiago expressed
good wishes and agreement that Russia and Italy would be good long-term
allies. </p>
<p>As the week went on, I had the best communication with France. Every
day we seemed to exchange at least three messages. Britain wrote less
frequently, but the messages I did receive were friendly and fairly
long. Toward the end of the week, there was a lot of silence from
everyone, even though I was waiting for replies from G, A, T, and
I. Germany finally did write to apologize for the delay and to ask
whether I&#8217;d build F St. Petersburg (nc) in exchange for Sweden,
but I politely declined to so in Winter &#8216;00. JT and I seemed
headed for a B-F on his side and an A-R on mine; we would choose which
of our respective allies to keep as the third when we&#8217;d had
a chance to witness them both in action.</p>
<p>Still, I agonized over the choice between A and T. If I picked Austria,
would I be going for position over personality? I wasn&#8217;t getting
the same level of warning signals from Robert that I&#8217;d gotten
from false allies in previous games, but after a few days&#8217; silence
I was a bit concerned. I finally heard from Robert again on Tuesday
(five days after his last message!). He said that unless I agreed
to order F Sevastapol to Black Sea, he must ask for a bounce in Galicia
and would let me into Rumania with the fleet. Five days earlier I&#8217;d
actually started to consider whether I could cancel my arrangements
with Turkey at the last minute and demand a bounce in Black Sea&#8212;it
would have been only slightly less annoying to Turkey than an outright
stab, but would have kept my honor intact. </p>
<p>However, I wasn&#8217;t willing to make this demand on such short
notice when Markus had been writing me on a regular basis. I was especially
not interested in making a last minute demand given the time zone
difference. Markus would have been justifiably very angry. Instead
I cheerfully accepted Robert&#8217;s request for the bounce (all the
more so since it meant that I could put off the final decision between
him and Markus for longer) and tried to make the point that his long
silence had hurt the relationship. He apologized and we resolved to
compare notes after the moves. I hoped my refusal to attack Turkey
would not affect Austria&#8217;s plans to order A Vienna to Tyrolia,
which I thought would have very interesting diplomatic consequences.
At that time I actually favored Turkey (in spite of my strategic misgivings).</p>
<p>I heard from Germany, finally confirming the DMZs in Prussia and
Silesia. He still wouldn&#8217;t guarantee Sweden, but I tried to
take that calmly. When I asked, he said Britain had asked him to bounce
me and if he ended up allied to Mike he would. The day of moves, George
sent a message asking whether I&#8217;d consider an arrangement where
he would move north and west, and I would go west and south (eventually
giving up Scandinavia, presumably). I replied that I was very open
to that idea and we should discuss it in detail after the Spring moves.</p>
<p> The same day, Mike indicated that he would open in a somewhat anti-Italian
fashion rather than go for the all-out attack on France. He&#8217;d
previously hinted that he was more pro-French than anything else (in
spite of Italy&#8217;s attempts to form a B-G-I, he said), and I passed
that on to France with the warning that Mike probably expected me
to do so. </p>
<p>So I went into the Spring &#8216;00 moves feeling that things were
going reasonably well. I wasn&#8217;t sure what would happen in the
west, but I thought the east was under control. </p>
<p>And of course, everything started to go wrong right away. </p>

<p>Things went pretty much as I&#8217;d expected in the east. Turkey
didn&#8217;t attack me, but instead moved as planned; Austria did
indeed order an army to Tyrolia; and Italy didn&#8217;t attack France.
However, both Britain and Germany did move against France. Very decisively.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been told since then that the joint British-German moves
were a coincidence, not the result of a strong B-G alliance. That&#8217;s
ironic because JT and I (and I think the rest of us) were absolutely
convinced that there **WAS** a strong B-G, very likely with Turkey
involved as a silent third partner, and this fear proved to be the
catalyst for the F-A-R alliance. It was the primary reason why I allied
with Robert against Markus (sorry Markus!). I personally was convinced
that B-G had an entire master plan worked out: Russia and Austria
were to keep each other busy while B-G decimated France with Italy&#8217;s
help. B-G would then hit Italy and me next. Turkey would thus get
the lion&#8217;s share of R-T efforts against Austria, and then turn
against Russia and Italy. It all made sense! [Not one bit of this
was true, but perception is reality in Diplomacy.]</p>
<p>JT immediately sent out a message to the rest of us asking for help
against the obvious threat of B-G, and a private message to me to
discuss the situation. We compared notes and decided that Turkey was
probably on B-G&#8217;s side, while Italy was probably being cautious.
JT was hopeful that Austria would help save him and thought (after
a few exchanges with George) that Germany might not be so committed
to the anti-French alliance. I wasn&#8217;t sure that Turkey was as
deeply involved as JT feared, though the revelation that Markus had
sworn F Egypt would not hit Mid-Atlantic Ocean seemed to be a point
against him. Of course, it may be that Mike had deceived Markus in
order to discourage A Damascus to Palestine and to pass false information
to France just as he&#8217;d done with me. But I was also highly suspicious
of Mike&#8217;s repeated talk of a B-R-T alliance&#8212;I thought
that it might really be a B-T and that I was being set up between
the two of them.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t agree with JT&#8217;s read of Germany. I had several
exchanges with George and got the impression that he was deliberately
evading my questions and jerking me around. In any case, it was practically
moot; I would have to attack him and once begun there would be no
stopping. JT hoped George could be convinced to let me take Sweden
and build a fleet St. Petersburg (nc), but I was pretty sure this
was a pipe dream. We decided that it would be better for me to head
straight for the Baltic Sea rather than make a futile bid for Sweden
(JT expressed admiration that I was willing to do it &#8211; he thought
most Tsars wouldn&#8217;t have been able to resist trying for Sweden).</p>
<p> As the week went on, our fears of a B-G-T grew stronger. However,
it looked like a solid F-A-R was forming to counter it. Italy was
the wild card. We barely heard from Tiago and were not sure what he
would do. JT said that he had discussed an alliance with Tiago, but
in my own exchanges with Italy it seemed there had been a miscommunication.
In the Spring, Tiago had expected French support for a move to Switzerland.
However, I made it clear that I wished Italy would move to Greece
and NOT attack France. We hoped Italy would be benevolently neutral
at worst.</p>
<p> In the last two days, Robert asked whether we thought it wouldn&#8217;t
be better for him to order his army Tyrolia to Bohemia and Budapest
to Serbia, because he thought for sure that he would only bounce Germany
in Munich, but that we would take Bulgaria. George had apparently
told Robert that he was covering Munich, so it wouldn&#8217;t be worth
trying for it. JT and I talked Robert around to trying for Munich
after all, pointing out that George had already tricked him once (having
apparently promised to support Austrian A Tyrolia to Switzerland after
bouncing Italy in Switzerland in the Spring, something he didn&#8217;t
do). Robert reluctantly gave in, although the event proved us right.
This incident was uncomfortable for me. The abrupt last-minute suggestions
made me feel like Robert was trying to worm his way out of attacking
Germany directly. However, I&#8217;d already given in to his request
that I order A Warsaw to Prussia instead of A Warsaw to Silesia, so
he in turn went with JT&#8217;s and my votes to try for Munich. </p>

<p> [I should mention here that negotiations prior to retreats and adjustments
are prohibited by the rules of Diplomacy. Given my inability to enforce
this provision in an e-mail contest, however, I allowed them.] The
Fall &#8216;00 moves went about as well as we had dared to hope. France
prevented Britain from getting a single western build; Austria did
indeed take Munich; the German fleet sailed into Stockholm while I
went to Baltic Sea; and our joint attack forced Turkey out of Bulgaria.
Turkey even moved A Konya to Constantinople, thus guaranteeing that
he would lose either Black Sea or Armenia in the next season!</p>
<p>I proposed that I build F St. Petersburg (sc) and A Sevastapol. [Remember,
the Russian Steamroller Rule allows Russia to have &#8220;n+1&#8221;
units as long as it controls &#8220;n&#8221; SCs and one of those
SCs is a home SC.] I didn&#8217;t want to build F St. Petersburg (nc),
since that would be tantamount to a declaration of war against Britain
(whom I actually didn&#8217;t want to fight at all), but I knew France
would request it. To my moderate surprise, Robert agreed with my reasons
for F St. Petersburg (sc) (which were sensible in their own right).
Robert decided on armies in Trieste and Budapest. JT decided on armies
in Paris and Marseilles. We all agreed that F Marseilles would not
be a good idea just yet.</p>
<p> Markus wrote to warn me that F Sevastapol would make peace between
Russia and Turkey impossible. I said I&#8217;d take that into account
(pointing out that such a fleet could always be dislodged and disbanded
later), but that surely it offered strategic benefits? He repeated
his point and I continued to let him think I was building F Sevastapol,
the better to make A Sevastapol look like I was responding to his
wishes. To my surprise, he built A Ankara instead of F Ankara. I think
I accidentally psyched him into thinking I really would build F Sevastapol
and that A Ankara was thus more useful! <br>
When Markus sent out the message about wanting to build in Damascus,
I suspected it might be a ruse (as I pointed out to JT) to make us
all think there were problems in the B-T relationship. Baron confirmed
that such a ruse would be permissible, if it were indeed a ruse. </p>
<p> In the last day before builds were due, George wrote me and offered
to support my A St. Petersburg into Norway and to build F Kiel. JT
had been plying him with encouragement to build F Kiel and hope A-R
fell apart. I told him I&#8217;d already committed to F St. Petersburg
(sc), but I would talk to my allies and might change it if there were
time. I encouraged him to build F Kiel, saying it would send a positive
diplomatic message about his willingness to fight Britain, and I outlined
how we could seize the North Sea in 1901. None of this came to pass.
Germany built two armies and our war continued.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Spring 1901</strong></font></p>
<p> The F-A-R alliance discussed possibilities for Spring &#8216;01.
Diplomatically, JT seemed to think that both Germany and/or Britain
might change sides given the A-R intervention. In private messages
with me he rejected the proposal that we ask Italy to take Alsace
on the grounds that Germany must be allowed to retreat out of Burgundy.
He seemed confident that George would so order. We also discussed
the likelihood of Italy coming in completely on our side to make it
an F-A-I-R alliance.</p>
<p>Robert wrote a long message to F-R with his tactical suggestions
for Spring. He pointed out that B-G could convoy the new A London
to Brest right away (something which I stupidly hadn&#8217;t noticed)
and suggested moves that would destroy the German A Burgundy, including
Italian A Switzerland to Alsace.</p>
<p>JT tried to veto this, repeating that it was crucial for his survival
that Germany move A Burgundy out to Alsace. I sent him a few messages
pointing out that Robert was probably right and it wouldn&#8217;t
hurt his position even if Germany did order Burgundy to Alsace. I
pointed out privately that we needed an allied A Alsace to crack Germany&#8217;s
western frontier, and Austria and Italy might be discouraged if that
didn&#8217;t happen. Publicly I repeated that A Burgundy would be
destroyed, so there was no need to worry.</p>
<p>T hen Robert wrote back. He was very, VERY blunt in telling JT that
the suggestion of letting Germany back into Alsace was outrageous
and that he had no interest in an F-A-R where A-R only served to run
interference for France. I was both surprised and delighted at this
tone. It would force JT to go for Robert&#8217;s suggestions (which
were good and would dismantle Germany ASAP) and also make JT more
willing to go for F-I-R over F-A-R when push came to shove.</p>
<p>Privately, Robert expressed doubts about JT&#8217;s commitment and
said that A-R should keep the bridges open to a B-A-R instead of an
F-A-R, if need be. I replied that I hoped JT was just worried about
A Burgundy and we would see what he said. Robert revealed that he&#8217;d
already asked Tiago to order Switzerland to Alsace and asked whether
I&#8217;d heard from him. I replied truthfully that I hadn&#8217;t
mentioned Switzerland to Alsace as such, but had hinted at it. I was
a bit dismayed that Robert had made his request without consulting
JT and myself first, but didn&#8217;t want to challenge him over it.
<br>
I didn&#8217;t tell JT about this conversation at this time, since
he was already giving way on the Alsace issue and there seemed to
be no point in making him more nervous about Robert. However, I did
keep it in mind for later. JT and I had agreed that if Italy joined
us we would eventually distill the F-A-I-R down to a three-way alliance
with France, Russia, and whoever we agreed was the better ally between
Italy and Austria. Geo-politically I preferred Italy, but so far Robert
was communicating far more regularly and reliably than Tiago. Still,
if Tiago got drawn into the alliance more fully and proved trustworthy,
he might be the better choice.</p>
<p> From this point onward, my diplomacy with Germany and Turkey died
down. George started to behave in a way that I thought of as frivolous
and I decided to respond in kind. I was friendly and tried to be funny,
but did not discuss serious matters with him. Markus only sent me
very short messages to which I also replied in kind. Thus, while I
continued to talk to each of them and keep communications open, nothing
of great import was said. <br>
I made a few moderate noises in Italy&#8217;s direction about keeping
an eye on Austria, but encouraged him to join the attack on Germany
and Turkey. Tiago seemed perfectly willing.</p>
<p>I continued on friendly terms with Britain. Mike appreciated my build
on the south coast of St. Petersburg, which he correctly interpreted
as a sign that I had no (immediate) designs on Norway. [To answer
a question from Chris Dziedzic, that&#8217;s why I built the fleet
and kept it there for a year. It was a concrete way of showing peaceful
intent toward Britain and encouraging him to move out of Norway.]
JT told me that Mike had promised to convoy his new army to Egypt,
which I found doubtful. Relations between France and Britain were
obviously bad. It seemed, as Mike commented at one point, that they
were in a death grip with each other. I thought this could be a good
thing for me, as long as neither of them got the upper hand over the
other. </p>

<p> The Spring moves were ambiguous, but favorable overall. Germany&#8217;s
withdrawal surprised me and gave him a strong defensive position,
which was annoying. However, in the south my gambit of ordering A
Sevastapol H worked. Turkey ordered to Armenia, leaving Constantinople
vulnerable for a Fall attack. In the west, the German army was destroyed
as hoped. Expectedly, Britain did not convoy to Egypt as Mike had
told JT he would, but to Gibraltar instead&#8212;not good, but better
than Brest!</p>
<p>Overall I was reasonably satisfied, though I didn&#8217;t like the
look of the German defenses in the north. I thought I might have to
make a deal with Britain to finish him off or it would be a long war.</p>
<p>There was a bit of a breach early in negotiations. The fireworks
started when I suggested to Robert that we should support Italy into
Constantinople instead of Austria. Robert went ballistic and accused
me of being in an I-R alliance that was plotting to surround him.
I replied calmly, reiterating my reasons, pointing out why Tiago might
ask for it, and why it might be a good idea to agree. </p>
<p>Robert sent back a message stating that the point was mostly moot
anyway because Tiago had just agreed to Austrian occupation of Constantinople
without the slightest murmur. Robert went on to ask insultingly for
my assurance that I would not try to change Tiago&#8217;s mind. SEVERAL
TIMES. JT then told me that Robert had BCC&#8217;d him on the message
and suggested that France might have to make peace with Germany and
Britain if war broke out between Russia and Austria. It was at this
point that I let JT know of Robert&#8217;s earlier threats to drop
F-A-R for B-A-R. I was annoyed and worried about Robert&#8217;s reliability.
I assured Robert that I wasn&#8217;t going to get Tiago to change
his mind and things seemed to settle down after that. However, I didn&#8217;t
forget this episode. </p>
<p>Tiago then sent a message asking about Damascus and Egypt, and whether
I saw any problems with the proposed arrangement&#8212;I can only
assume Robert had said something to him. I replied that I thought
he might want Constantinople first, but it was too late now. I agreed
that Damascus and Egypt should be his. Again, we agreed to keep an
eye on Austria.</p>
<p>Britain warned me of his intent to order F English Channel S German
A Belgium and expressed the hope that this would not harm B-R relations.
I replied that I knew his reasons were anti-French rather than anti-Russian
or anti-Austrian, but it implied that Germany would bounce Austria
in Cologne. We discussed the situation amicably, but in the end it
didn&#8217;t matter because Germany unexpectedly bounced himself in
Cologne anyway, leaving it open to rebuild the sixth army (curses!).</p>

<p> The main issue here was Austria&#8217;s builds. Robert had two.
According to a previous agreement, he couldn&#8217;t build in Budapest,
so he was building an army in Vienna. That left a unit in Trieste.
Robert had asked Tiago what he would prefer, but did not hear back
for a long time. I convinced Robert first not to build a fleet, which
would have been a direct threat to Italy, and then to waive the second
build altogether. I was very annoyed when Tiago finally answered,
telling Robert to build whatever he pleased!</p>

<p> An Austrian convoy to Tunisia and an Italian move to Burgundy were
the main points of discussion. Tiago agreed to go to Burgundy, although
he did so reluctantly. This plan was originally Robert&#8217;s suggestion.
Looking back now, it seems he was setting Italy up for the stab. However,
the suggestion of the convoy to Tunisia was mine, which made it less
suspicious. Robert also proposed moving an army out of the Balkan
centers and into Macedonia, using the need for an A-R DMZ as an excuse
&#8211; an argument I supported.</p>
<p>I was worried about how long it was taking to reduce Germany. I approached
Mike with the idea of working together against Germany in Scandinavia.
I would support F Norway to Sweden and F North Sea would support a
Russian convoy to Denmark. Mike liked the idea. I then broached the
subject with France, Austria, and Italy. Only France was against it.
As things turned out, I&#8217;m glad the joint B-R operation went
ahead. If it hadn&#8217;t, Germany would still have been at six when
I was forced to change direction and the game might have ended very
differently.</p>
<p> George started talking to me about becoming a puppet. I responded
positively, saying that I felt no need to destroy Germany for destruction&#8217;s
sake, but I thought he was premature &#8211; Germany wasn&#8217;t
crippled yet! We agreed to keep talking. In my messages to Austria
I stuck to a strict &#8220;Germania delenda est&#8221; line, but I
was afraid that I would need to declare a truce with Germany if the
F-A-I-R alliance fell apart, so I was laying the groundwork for that.
It was a good call, as it turned out. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Fall 1902</strong></font></p>
<p> This turn ended up being a decisive moment in the game. I wasn&#8217;t
directly involved in any of the A-F-I negotiations that led to Italy&#8217;s
Fall &#8216;02 moves, so I can&#8217;t really comment on how they
happened. I had some hints of what was coming, but I didn&#8217;t
put them together in time. <br>
It began when Tiago asked me anxiously whether Robert had been complaining
about him (apparently as a result of Austrian demands on Italy). He
pointed out that he&#8217;d been a loyal member of F-A-I-R and deserved
the SCs that had been promised to him. I replied that Robert had said
a few things, but didn&#8217;t seem about to stab and hadn&#8217;t
asked me not to support Italy to Damascus. I assured him I would support
him there and warn him if Robert told me he was attacking Italy.</p>
<p>I then suggested to JT that Italy might want to cover Greece with
F Ionian Sea and left it to him to pass that thought on. Robert&#8217;s
earlier accusations of I-R plotting made me wary of making the suggestion
directly (a benefit of his aggressive style, I guess!), so I counted
on France to drop the hint instead. I later wished I had been more
direct, but at the time I didn&#8217;t want to risk being linked to
such an Italian demand of Austria.</p>
<p>Mike wrote to ask me whether I knew what Austria was going to do
with A Tunisia. I replied that I wasn&#8217;t sure, but thought he
was going to support France into Algeria. Mike expressed disappointment
at this, but we agreed he should take it up with Robert. Meanwhile,
we finalized the plan to hit Denmark and Sweden. I warned Mike that
I might order A Livonia to St. Petersburg to keep from having to build
F St. Petersburg (nc), but said he shouldn&#8217;t be alarmed because
I *still* wasn&#8217;t going to attack him. At the time, it was true.
I saw the bitter feud between France and Britain as a good development
for Russia. While I would intervene on JT&#8217;s side if necessary
to save France, what I really wanted was to keep them stalemated against
each other for as long as possible. Helping Britain stay at six while
France grew minimally to seven would help achieve this objective.</p>
<p>The F-A-I-R alliance made further plans for the Fall moves. I would
work with Britain in the north, while France, Italy, and Austria would
make attacks against Germany in Belgium and Cologne. In the south,
F-I-A would support the Grande Armee back into Algeria; A-I-R would
finish off Turkey; and (a last-minute arrangement) Italy would cede
Switzerland to France so JT would be able to build a fleet in Brest.
It all seemed to be settled.</p>
<p> Then at the last minute Robert asked me to get Mike to order F North
Sea to Netherlands, to cut a support so I wouldn&#8217;t get two and
he would be sure of taking Cologne. I was annoyed at this sudden,
selfish proposal, but tried not to show it. I replied that there wasn&#8217;t
enough time for last-minute changes, that it was tactically inferior
(since it gave up a guaranteed Denmark without guaranteeing Cologne,
and made it harder to press Germany even if it worked), and that I
could waive a build or place a fleet in Sevastapol if he was worried
about my growth (though I suggested that he make a fuss about it in
F-A-I-R messages, so a build of F Sevastapol would look like something
to placate him, not a threat to Italy). I also sent a message to Mike
reiterating my request for support to Denmark in case Robert had already
asked him to make the move of F North Sea to Netherlands instead.</p>
<p>Overall Robert seemed to be making all his allies uneasy. His style
was extremely nerve-wracking &#8211; pre-emptive accusations, relentlessly
pushing for his own advantage, abrupt last-minute changes of plan.
This was great from my point of view, as long as he didn&#8217;t make
people *so* nervous that they attacked him prematurely &#8211; or
he attacked them. I doubted he would go for a huge stab, but I couldn&#8217;t
rule it out completely. I didn&#8217;t really expect it, though, so
his actual moves were a shock. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Winter 1902</strong></font></p>
<p> Austria had stabbed Italy massively. Robert supported A Alsace into
Switzerland and slipped into both Tripolitania and Greece. Austria
gained three, Italy went down one, and poor France &#8211; which had
been counting on getting Switzerland after Italy&#8217;s generous
donation &#8211; also lost one. Mike&#8217;s and my attacks on Denmark
and Sweden both went through smoothly. Britain grew by one and Russia
by two. </p>
<p>As soon as I saw the results, I was in turmoil. In quick succession
I realized this meant I would have to build A Warsaw and A Sevastapol,
and rush to the rescue of Italy. Then I reluctantly realized I would
probably have to make peace with Germany and attack Britain too.</p>
<p>Of course, if things worked out, I would be in a potentially winning
position. Britain and France already had a bitter feud between them
and now there was one between Austria and Italy. If I was careful,
I need have little fear that JT or Tiago would suddenly switch sides
on me, even if I started to become the clear leader. </p>
<p>However, I would be sabotaging my relationship with Britain, which
had so far been pretty good. I was displeased. It honestly had never
been my intention to attack Britain until the very end if I could
avoid it. But I didn&#8217;t think I could avoid it. I needed more
SCs to build armies to face Austria and the vulnerable British holdings
were the only place I could get them. Furthermore, I needed to take
pressure off both Italy and France so they&#8217;d be able to help
me against Austria. </p>
<p>Making peace with Germany was something I was extremely reluctant
to do. Not only might I have to give back Berlin, but it would open
the door to a possible A-G alliance &#8211; a sure harbinger of death
for the Rodina! Besides, one of the valid criticisms of my play in
my previous 1900 game had been my failure to complete any offensives.
I was afraid that making peace with George would be a similar mistake.
But I honestly couldn&#8217;t see any alternative. If I took the time
to finish off Germany, a bloated Austria would destroy Italy and France.
I couldn&#8217;t afford that. </p>
<p>I decided that I would probably have to attack both Mike and Robert.
This was potentially very high-risk. If Germany rejected my overtures,
I thought an A-B-G alliance would make short work of me. I wasn&#8217;t
terribly afraid of that, though, at least until Germany recovered
Munich. Besides, until Austria was knocked down again, he was a clear
threat to win. The main risk to Russia wasn&#8217;t direct. The real
danger was that I would find myself stalemated against Austria in
the east, while Robert picked up enough centers to win in the west.
</p>
<p>The alternative was an awkward B-A-R, with me right next to aggressive
Robert &#8211; hardly an appealing situation. Mike later commented
that a B-A-R would have left me squeezed between my allies with little
room to expand, compared with a F-I-R that gave me free access to
all the centers in the middle of Europe. This was undoubtedly true
and I did think of it at the time. However, it was my fear of Austria
that was the deciding factor. Better to face Robert now while I still
could do so with a chance of winning. </p>
<p>I also have to admit that greed and glory played a factor. I liked
the idea of seizing Scandinavia. Something about attacking the two
other largest countries on the board appealed to me. I also realized
that, if I could pull things off well enough, I would be in an excellent
position to go for the solo. <br>
This phase actually saw a lot of negotiations. I had two main objectives:
to get Germany to join F-I-R rather than A-B and to convince Robert
not to build A Budapest so I could move to both Galicia and Rumania
without opposition in Spring &#8216;03. We had already established
that he wouldn&#8217;t build there without my express consent, as
part of our larger Balkan DMZ, but things had just changed dramatically!
</p>
<p>Robert wrote saying he was sure that I wasn&#8217;t pleased with
his Fall &#8216;02 moves, but that I should understand why he had
done it. There followed a long exchange of messages in which he at
first offered to let me build in Warsaw, then qualified that as only
one of Warsaw or Sevastapol (and F Sevastapol at that). I did toy
with the idea of building A Warsaw and F Sevastapol as Robert suggested
early on, but I continued to insist that he hold to our original bargain
and not build in Budapest. He continued to push for that, saying that
without it he couldn&#8217;t pursue the attack on Germany. Ultimately,
he insisted that if he didn&#8217;t build in Budapest, I must only
build in Moscow. I was left gasping with indignation &#8211; here
he had just destroyed the F-A-I-R alliance and yet was demanding that
**I** make all the concessions! </p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t refuse him outright or he would build in Budapest,
so I agreed to his conditions &#8211; but I insisted that he not build
in Budapest or I would have to come after him with everything, even
(gasp!) if that meant making peace with Germany. Evidently this hit
the right psychological note. He reluctantly agreed, reiterating one
final time that this meant he would not be able to help against George.
I feared he might build in Budapest anyway despite my warning. It
made no difference to my builds. I went ahead with A Warsaw and A
Sevastapol exactly as planned. <br>
F-I-R was firming up solidly. Both JT and I promised our full support
to Tiago and we all consulted each other on builds and disbands. For
France, the removal of A Southern Algeria was obvious. Italy&#8217;s
choice was harder, but we determined that A Egypt should be the one
to go. I asked JT to act as a mediator between George and myself.
I was afraid to send George anything directly for fear he would forward
it to someone. While I hated to give up my offensive, I thought it
was important to get George on our side before Robert got him on his!
In the end Germany retreated to Skagerrak and removed Netherlands,
just as I had asked him to do through JT&#8217;s mediation.</p>
<p>When the adjudication came, it turned out that Robert did indeed
waive his build in Budapest, while I built in Warsaw and Sevastapol.
Normally I wouldn&#8217;t have wanted to destroy my credibility with
Robert for such a small advantage, but I think that this may have
been the determining point in the game. In any case, Galicia and Rumania
were now open to me. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Spring 1903</strong></font></p>
<p> Robert was predictably irate at my builds and basically declared
total war. I wrote back saying that his aggressive stance had driven
me to it. If I had done anything else the entire board would have
thought me an idiot and been right. I said that perhaps he was angry
that I&#8217;d managed to trick him, but we could talk after that
had passed. There was no need for war.</p>
<p>Many, many messages were sent between St. Petersburg, Paris, and
Rome. We reiterated our commitment to each other, agonized over whether
Germany would join us, and tried to come up with the best tactical
moves possible. We were under the gun because JT was leaving for a
business trip from Tuesday morning until Thursday. [Moves were due
on Wednesdays.] However, I felt confident in both him and Tiago. The
only question mark for me was George. He claimed he hadn&#8217;t been
hearing from Austria or Britain a lot, which was sort of suspicious.
Then again, George&#8217;s messages tended to be brief with JT and
JT said they had a good relationship. Since Mike apparently wasn&#8217;t
sending messages to JT either, silence between Britain and Germany
actually seemed plausible. [This was, in fact, the case.]</p>
<p>After JT left I exchanged a few tactical messages with George. The
discussions seemed to go okay. I was still nervous about whether he
would follow through, but overall hoped he would. I wasn&#8217;t sure
of how to handle him, though. I&#8217;m glad I never followed through
with my original impulse to offer to return Berlin to him. I now think
that the mass of units I kept in his area were instrumental in persuading
him to work with F-I-R. These units were the iron fist that I was
careful to keep covered in a velvet glove.</p>
<p>Mike was anxious to create a B-A-R alliance. He sent a few three-way
messages to try to keep things under control. Robert and I both adopted
a more reasonable tone. Robert proposed that I order Warsaw to Silesia
and Sevastapol to Armenia. We discussed exchanging Rumania for Constantinople.
He offered me temporary control of Munich. His primary demand in return
was that I not order Warsaw to Galicia and Sevastapol to Rumania.
If Robert had approached me with these proposals the turn before,
I might have reacted much more favorably to them. It was too late
now, though. I went along with these negotiations even though I didn&#8217;t
really intend to follow through with them. I was convinced that if
I did go for the B-A-R, the game would end in an Austrian win. </p>
<p>In my private correspondence with Mike, I sounded him out on his
attitude about all this and awaken him to the danger of an Austrian
solo. I pointed out that in a B-A-R he wouldn&#8217;t be able to use
his fleets to keep Austria in check and delicately inquired about
him leaving Italy alone for a while. Mike&#8217;s response was that
Italy had been a thorn in his side from the beginning due to Tiago&#8217;s
refusal to hit France. Mike was glad to see Italy being attacked.
That, as much as anything, finally made me decide that I had no choice
other than to attack Britain, as well as Austria, in spite of my reluctance
to do so. <br>
JT and I had long suspected that the A-B relationship was stronger
than either Mike or Robert was letting on and I saw Mike&#8217;s attitude
as more evidence of that. He was interested in surrounding and destroying
the German fleet, but didn&#8217;t suggest a direct attack through
Helgoland Bight to finish off Germany quickly. To be fair, I only
hinted at this option. I think the press had made him worry about
the isolation of his lone F Sweden so he wanted to reinforce it. But
whether there was a strong A-B alliance or not [Vienna and London
were cordial, but not working together too closely at this time],
I felt that I *HAD* to take pressure off of Italy and France, or it
would be all over. While I believed Mike&#8217;s claim that I could
safely leave St. Petersburg open to him, he didn&#8217;t seem to appreciate
the threat that Robert posed and the necessity to counter immediately.
</p>
<p>I wrote orders to smash the British fleet in Sweden and set up a
Fall attack on Norway, while coordinating with France and Germany
to stymie British fleet movements and set up a Fall attack on Munich.
F-I-R discussions came up with a plan to hinder the Austrian advance
into Italy and put pressure on Switzerland. It looked grim, though.
Italy was in bad shape. </p>

<p> My Spring moves worked reasonably well. I was set up to take Bulgaria,
Sweden, and Norway. It was only after looking at the board for a while
that I realized how vulnerable I was to a German stab. I would have
to be extremely careful to keep George&#8217;s attention focused on
Austria and to get JT to do everything in his power to make sure George
stayed on our side. I immediately sent a message to George in which
I casually mentioned that he and JT should split the British home
SCs because I didn&#8217;t want to get too big. I asked if he&#8217;d
be interested in Vienna. Thus began my campaign to play down my imminent
success.</p>
<p>I was apologetic when I wrote Mike. I explained that I just *needed*
the SCs to fight Austria (which was indeed another reason I&#8217;d
attacked him). I didn&#8217;t expect he would accept this excuse,
but we&#8217;d had a pretty good relationship so far and I wanted
to keep that door open as wide as possible. <br>
Robert was (obviously) displeased, especially after I offered a lame
excuse for the stab. We exchanged a message or two, and then that
was the last I heard from him for a while. I continued to send brief
greetings &#8220;just to say hello,&#8221; but didn&#8217;t receive
any reply this season, nor for the next few turns. <br>
George continued to be friendly and undemanding, and I continued to
be friendly and not offer anything more than I had to. I started to
think that keeping a whole bunch of units near his centers might be
the key to keeping him in line, along with keeping all my promises
to him. </p>
<p>F-I-R discussed several tactical options. We expected to lose Egypt
without getting anything in return, while keeping Switzerland vacant
(but still Austrian-held) for capture in &#8216;04. It looked pretty
grim for Italy. In a private mail sent around this time, I told JT
that if Italy had to disband (as seemed likely), F Constantinople
should be the one to go since I could still cover it with A Ankara.
I might end up taking Constantinople accidentally, however. His response
woke me to the dangers of getting too cocky. He told me bluntly that
my message had frightened him and that friendly though we were, France
was no keener to see a Russian solo than a solo by anybody else. I
tried to excuse myself by pointing out that it might be tactically
necessary, but decided to try to be less forthright in the future.
</p>
<p>We also discussed whether we might be forced to end up in F-G-R,
but we both agreed that we would much, much prefer a F-I-R as a reward
for Tiago&#8217;s exemplary loyalty. </p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Winter 1903 / Spring 1904</strong></font></p>
<p> There was a wide gap between Winter &#8217;03 and Spring &#8217;04,
since JT had asked for a delay. In my memory, the two seasons get
confused easily. <br>
The Fall &#8217;03 moves were a pleasant surprise for Italy. Tiago
held on to Egypt due to an Austro-British misunderstanding in the
orders and he also managed to take Switzerland and Constantinople
from Austria &#8211; Switzerland being an unexpected bonus that let
Italy grow! Austria also used both A Vienna and A Trieste to cover
Budapest, which meant one less army on the Italian front. For the
rest, everything went as expected: Russia took Norway and Bulgaria,
and Germany recovered Munich. Austria was knocked down from ten to
seven, while I jumped ahead from eight to eleven, placing me far in
the lead. </p>
<p>Almost immediately, JT warned me that there were rumblings about
my size. That surprised me a bit, because I&#8217;d thought it was
obvious for a while that I&#8217;d get eleven. Of course I set out
immediately to reduce fears as best I could. I advertised to both
Tiago and George (separately) that I had no intention of growing any
more in 1904, that my job now was to pin down Austria and Britain
while they recovered a bit, and that they should get gains from now
on.</p>
<p>George asked me not to take Kiel in exchange for his support into
Edinburgh. I was puzzled at this, but assured him I had no designs
on Kiel. I said F Baltic Sea was there only to support Berlin or cover
Prussia if Austria retreated A Munich to Silesia. Germany had nothing
to fear from me. I repeated that he and JT should be the ones to make
gains in Britain, but allowed that I could live with taking Edinburgh
for myself if we all agreed it was okay. I promised to help his advance
toward Britain regardless. We also discussed whether I should build
F St. Petersburg (nc). <br>
Tiago seemed grateful for my repeated pledge of loyalty. We discussed
with JT what Italy should build in Naples. I favored an army, but
Tiago and JT both wanted a fleet, so a fleet it was. </p>
<p>For myself, I obviously had to build A Warsaw and A Sevastapol. The
main question was whether the third unit should be A Moscow or the
dreaded F St. Petersburg (nc) that I had fought against for so long.
Even though I had just stabbed Britain, I still didn&#8217;t particularly
want to see it invaded. In some ways I thought A Moscow was a better
choice, but diplomatically F St. Petersburg (nc) seemed the best.
It was a way to demonstrate that I was committed to the fight against
Britain and to reassure Germany.</p>
<p>I had had no (substantial) exchanges with Mike and Robert, so their
retreats and removals surprised me. It seemed that they were both
ignoring me to hit west. I had ambivalent feelings about that. On
the one hand, I&#8217;d attacked primarily to get their attention
and force them to face me instead of beating up on Italy, so their
refusal to be distracted was smart in that sense. On the other hand,
I didn&#8217;t think they could take down everyone else in time to
turn against me and prevent a Russian solo, so I wasn&#8217;t sure
why they were doing it. As it turned out, they were reportedly both
threatening to throw the game to me unless France and Germany helped
them conquer Italy in time to turn against me. Naturally, JT wasn&#8217;t
keen on this idea. He didn&#8217;t tell of the Austro-British diplomatic
tactic until the Spring deadline approached. </p>
<p>This A-B strategy made me nervous about being attacked, of course,
but I was already holding strictly to my stated line of just gaining
position to threaten more Austrian centers without actually taking
any for Russia and encouraging my allies to make all the gains for
themselves. I&#8217;d been doing my best to reassure them (especially
Germany, my unfairly-not-very-trusted-ally) that my new size hadn&#8217;t
gone to my head and I was fully prepared to help them gain like stature.
I could only hope that approach would go over better than any A-B
&#8220;join us or die&#8221; ultimatum. </p>
<p>In another sense, the suicide threat was actually a positive development
for me. If their attempts to break up F-I-R-G didn&#8217;t work, Mike
and Robert would have a reason to help me win (i.e., to maintain diplomatic
credibility, presumably only in future games, but hey). This would
be ideal once it came time for me to make a solo push. I had already
thought of how to approach them with the argument that a Russian solo
would guarantee them a survival, while a F-I-R draw would see them
both eliminated. This &#8220;suicide&#8221; strategy added a new incentive
for them to help me win. </p>
<p>First, though, I had to be sure I&#8217;d be in a position to try
for it! As always, Germany was the one causing me the most headaches
&#8211; not that George had done anything. It was just that I was
paranoid. </p>
<p>Well, actually, George *had* done something in our tactical discussions.
He was thinking of ordering Cologne to Netherlands, Belgium to Netherlands,
and Kiel to Helgoland Bight. That would cover all possible retreats,
if Britain was forced out of North Sea in the Spring. However, I thought
Britain would just support North Sea in place or possibly go for a
supported attack on Belgium (English Channel S North Sea to Belgium).
I tried to recommend Cologne S Belgium and Belgium S Kiel to Netherlands
instead to protect Belgium and set up the attack for the Fall. I didn't
want to make a big deal about it because I didn't want George to worry
that I was planning to order Denmark to Helgoland Bight or something
equally dumb. It occurred to me (belatedly), however, that a G-F Helgoland
Bight could be used in a successful attack on Denmark in the Fall.
While unlikely, the prospect did set my Tsar-sense tingling. </p>
<p>Also, prior to this there had been an issue in F-I-R discussions.
I wanted to see the Italian fleet sail out of Constantinople to Aegean
Sea so I could move through to Macedonia in the Fall. JT was against
this, partly because he feared it favored me and ostensibly because
Germany might see it as a stab and turn to the A-B side. JT had emphasized
this with me before. How accurate JT&#8217;s concerns were, I didn&#8217;t
know, because George had always seemed content in my direct dealings
with him. Nonetheless, JT was afraid that if seen as a stab of Italy,
George would take my move to Constantinople as his cue to join Mike
and Robert. </p>
<p>Of course, JT was (unfortunately for me) very aware of the potential
for a Russian solo. He had already suggested I might give up Ankara
to prop up Italy, a prospect that filled me with horror, though of
course I couldn&#8217;t say so. He reiterated a previous point that
sometimes it was diplomatically wisest not to make the best tactical
moves. I (nervously!) agreed, but said that in this one instance at
least the advantage in moving aggressively was so great, and the threat
of a Russian solo so distant, that it didn&#8217;t make sense to hold
back. This was especially true when time was of the essence if we
were to save Italy from certain doom given the A-B strategy. </p>
<p>Ironically, Tiago didn&#8217;t seem to mind the idea of my passing
through Constantinople at all, so that basically cut off the argument,
though JT ended by repeating his warning that Germany might react
badly (which he later admitted might just be his own paranoia at work).
I was slightly amused because it reminded me of all the effort I&#8217;d
put in to convince Robert to make concessions to Italy, only to have
Tiago turn around and declare them completely unnecessary. JT continued
to drop a few hints that I was getting too powerful, like saying George
might consider Italy to be Russia&#8217;s &#8220;dupe,&#8221; but
didn&#8217;t go further than that &#8211; or not in F-I-R mail. I
suspect he was beginning to work behind the scenes to prepare against
any Russian solo shot. [Actually, France&#8217;s relations with Austria-Hungary
and Britain had deteriorated so badly by this point that JT didn&#8217;t
generate any anti-Russian messages that I can recall.] </p>
<p>Anyway, with the Constantinople issue resolved our tactical plans
fell into place. Italy would try for Mid-Atlantic Ocean with French
support, and we hoped that would be a nasty surprise for A-B, while
I helped Germany against Britain and Austria, and brought my armies
up to the Austrian border. I would indeed move through Constantinople,
but move out in the Fall. </p>

<p>The Spring moves went almost exactly as planned. Italy took Mid-Atlantic
Ocean, Russia moved to Silesia, Germany went to Helgoland Bight (ignoring
an offered British support to Denmark), and Italy deployed fleets
into the Aegean and Ionian Seas. Better still, Austria and Britain
failed to take Egypt. Britain, in fact, didn&#8217;t even try for
Egypt, though evidently Austria had expected it to. This was evidenced
by Austria&#8217;s support for a non-existent British move to Egypt.
I thought this tactic odd if Robert was trying to put together a real
stop-Russia coalition with Italy in it.</p>
<p>There was an unexpected bonus: Austria pulled back from Italy completely.
As a result, Italy was able to take back Milan and seemed sure to
hold it. Austrian armies rushed back to the east where I could keep
them pinned down. It seemed Robert&#8217;s threat to throw the game
to Russia might just be a bluff, though I hoped that eventually he
would have to live up to his suicide threats. [Robert rebuked himself
rather harshly after the game ended for turning east in the Spring
instead of crippling Italy when he had the chance.]</p>
<p>JT and Tiago were both happy with the results. So was I. I felt we
had turned the corner and that F-I-R would now be able to hold it
together even if Germany turned against us. Russia seemed guaranteed
a draw and had a very good shot at a solo if I could manage things
right. JT almost immediately started pointing out the path for me
(inadvertently, of course) by saying that when the time came to stab
Germany I should hit him first, so he wouldn&#8217;t suspect France
and Italy until it was too late. Otherwise George might try to throw
the game to Russia. Hmmmm&#8230;</p>
<p>An unplanned one-week delay was declared on the day of the Fall adjudication.
There was a lot of silence until the next Monday. I sent one or two
messages to Mike and Robert (eventually confirming that they were
still receiving them, though many to Robert were returned undelivered
for a while). Mike was very gracious about my stabbing him, saying
that it had been a much better choice for me than the B-A-R. Other
than that, we didn&#8217;t discuss anything. </p>
<p>I sent a message to George in which I apologized for my silence and
stated that nothing had changed. He replied, claiming that Robert
hadn&#8217;t contacted him. I didn&#8217;t believe him, as JT had
already assured me there was &#8220;stop Russia&#8221; movement underway.
However, I didn&#8217;t want to press the issue, especially as these
negotiations were apparently going badly (due to unspecified unreasonable
demands). JT assured me that George wasn&#8217;t
going to attack me unless A-B-F-G-I all stopped fighting each other
and that simply wasn&#8217;t going to happen. I got the impression
that this was either because Tiago refused to turn against me (according
to JT, which sort of implied that JT *would* turn against me if necessary)
or because Robert was making demands that Tiago and/or JT were not
willing to meet. Mostly I was just grateful it didn&#8217;t work out!
[Nothing much was happening actually. A/B relations with F/I remained
dreadful. I suspect that JT made the claim in the vain hope that the
threat of a &#8220;stop Russia&#8221; campaign would make Charles
nervous about trying for a solo.]</p>
<p>In fact, it seems that negotiations were going so badly that in a
subsequent e-mail JT said outright that he thought a Russian solo
was only a matter of time unless I decided otherwise. He asked me
to stick to the F-I-R draw for the sake of justice or at least to
wait on the solo until both Britain and Austria were eliminated. I
was both elated and taken aback by this missive, and not sure of how
to respond. I could never admit that I was going for a solo, but JT
was appealing to me to &#8220;cut through all the crap&#8221; he was
getting from others. In the end I wrote back reiterating several times
that I was not about to get a solo. I ended my note by saying that
in the extremely theoretical case of my going for a solo, I could
try to eliminate Austria and Britain, but it would depend on whether
I could do so without endangering my win. </p>

turned or was turning. I asked George about it. He claimed it was
a last-minute decision and that he knew ahead of time that it wouldn&#8217;t

<p>Slight cracks began to appear in F-I-R when JT opposed the idea of
my growing this year. I tried to convince him that I had to attack
Austria, but he insisted that I could just sit tight and contain A-G
while France and Italy grew. He said that if I went on the offensive,
that meant I was going for the solo and to please not pretend otherwise.
</p>
<p>Of course he was right, but I think he also misunderstood my previous
message in which I had outlined a plan for the Spring moves which
he seemed to interpret as &#8220;you guys sit tight while I grow&#8221;
&#8211; obviously not a good message to send. I explained how my suggestions
for this year would help France and Italy too. At the end I said that
I still thought there was danger from A-G, but I didn&#8217;t want
to argue about fighting them if it was only going to make JT think
I was jerking him around. I repeated that I wanted to hit Austria
hard in 1905. </p>
<p>Soon after I received a reply from George. He didn&#8217;t answer
my questions about supporting me to Norwegian Sea, whether things
were patched up with Italy, or if he&#8217;d be able to help against
Austria. Instead he said that he was trying to decide whether to convoy
an army to Britain in Spring, or support France into the Channel and
ask for support to London. He asked whether I thought he could trust
JT. This immediately made me suspicious that he was just trying to
pretend that his relationship with JT wasn&#8217;t as close as it
was and that JT was already asking George to turn against me in the
near future. I replied neutrally by saying I had been thinking of
the convoy as well. </p>
<p>F-I-R continued to hammer out plans. Tiago responded to my suggestions
and I further outlined how France and Italy might get two SCs each
this year. Taking Trieste would depend on my hitting Serbia in the
Spring so I said I hoped he and JT would agree to that at least, especially
since it would be a shame not to when the move could not fail. </p>
<p>In the following days I heard little from anyone. JT finally sent
a mail explaining he had real-life things that were taking priority
and submitted some orders. Tiago decided to order F Aegean Sea to
Eastern Mediterranean, which might leave me in the position of having
to take Constantinople in the Fall, but I could live with that. I
ordered the attack on Serbia and also tried for Budapest with the
one army. That would cause problems if it worked and Germany had ordered
to Silesia; but after considering, I decided it was worth the risk.
George too had been largely incommunicado. I feared it might be because
he was plotting against me (I took this suicide stuff with a big grain
of salt), but decided to try for Budapest anyway. Even if it worked
and left Warsaw open, I&#8217;d be getting Budapest to compensate.</p>

<p> The Spring moves went well. George didn&#8217;t move to Silesia
or Burgundy. Robert seemed to follow through on his suicide threat,
which meant that I got into both Serbia and Budapest. Instead of racing
for Damascus, Austria bounced Italy in Cyrenaica. Germany did support
an Austrian move to Tyrolia, which increased my uneasiness about him.
To my surprise, Mike didn't cover Clyde at all, leaving Liverpool
open for French occupation in the Fall. <br>
I decided that Fall would be the turn when I would stab Germany and
begin the final push. I wasn&#8217;t sure whether this would work,
but so far it seemed likely. However, I didn&#8217;t want to tell
my French and Italian allies until after the fact, in case they objected
and tried a last-minute effort to prevent a Russian solo. This was
probably wise. I think JT may have been hoping to work with George
to stop me once Mike and Robert were out of the way.<br>
JT implied that G-A were trying to get him to help against Italy and
would let him know what their plans were. However, in the end this
didn&#8217;t happen. F-I-R discussed whether I should order my F Constantinople
to Macedonia or Aegean Sea. At first I was going to try for Macedonia,
but at the last minute it was agreed that Aegean Sea was the safer
move. </p>
<p>On Monday, I finally sent a longer message to George (who had ignored
my earlier message). I probed for a little information on what was
going on. Was he supporting France to London or vice versa? Would
he convoy the army again? He avoided the question.</p>
<p>A little before the moves, JT asked me to support F English Channel
to North Sea. I agreed. While I did have some idea of offering Mike
a survival if he helped me solo, I didn&#8217;t see what he could
do for me other than what he was already doing. JT mentioned a Russian
solo in a message, but I didn&#8217;t comment. Henceforth I tried
to ignore it whenever the subject came up. </p>
<p>Just before the Fall adjudication, I received another message from
George asking me to support him in North Sea and offering support
into Norwegian Sea. I didn&#8217;t answer, since I was about to stab
him!</p>

<p> My turn proceeded well. I stabbed Germany for two of his remaining
home centers, supported France into the North Sea, and ended up growing
by four. Somebody (George, as I later found out) proposed a concession
to Russia. </p>
<p>Very soon after the adjudication came out, I wrote to both George
and Robert (separately) pointing out that my immediate victory was
now their best chance for survival and expressing the hope that they
would see things this way too. While this might not have been necessary,
I didn&#8217;t want to rely completely on the suicide threat reports.
At the least, I wanted to reassure them that I was indeed thinking
of a solo bid so they would continue to help me by facing west!</p>
<p>I apologized to George for stabbing him, saying it was my F-I allies
in F-I-R who had insisted on it (this was of course false, but I wanted
to make him angry at them). George was a very good sport about it,
saying he had expected the stab at some point and he was the one who
had proposed a Russian solo. He very kindly told me I&#8217;d played
a great game and said, &#8220;If you don't play for a solo you are
a weenie,&#8221; a message I took to heart! <br>
JT wrote begging me to hold off from the solo until Britain was done
and also asking me to get my eighteen without taking any from Tiago.
My reply was non-committal. I had real-life reasons for wanting to
finish the game before September, since I was going back to school.
Besides, I didn&#8217;t feel any need to see Robert or Mike punished
for frustrations they had caused me. I was the one who had attacked
them, after all! I knew that from a ruthlessly pragmatic point of
view that it was in my best interest to keep all the countries alive
until I actually reached eighteen. It would be much easier to force
a solo against a coalition of five small, war-weary nations than against
a strong Italy and France. I was sure that JT was thinking of this
aspect of things as well. </p>
<p>Robert seemed happy at my message. He wanted to keep his home centers,
if he could, and asked me what Austrian disbands would suit my purposes
best. After discussion and negotiation, I agreed to leave Vienna alone
in Spring &#8216;06 in return for his removal of A Greece and A Macedonia,
which would leave both Constantinople and Greece open to me. I would
build A Sevastapol and order it to Armenia in Spring. If Damascus
was open, I would take that instead of Vienna for my eighteenth center
in Fall &#8216;06. I didn&#8217;t expect to have to follow through
on this offer, since even before the F-I-R tactical discussions I
was pretty sure Italy would keep F Eastern Mediterranean in position.</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Spring 1906</strong></font></p>
<p> There were many tactical discussions, with more pleas from JT to
postpone victory. My preliminary orders were very conservative, but
I changed them after negotiations. F-I-R worried about whether the
G-A alliance could take Switzerland, but JT was not willing to cut
support in Burgundy, instead fearing a German thrust to Picardy. In
the end we went for a less sure option. This served my purposes, since
it meant I didn&#8217;t have to risk losing Munich.</p>
<p>Robert asked whether my not attacking Vienna would apply to Trieste
and Tyrolia too. I replied that I wouldn&#8217;t attack Trieste, but
couldn&#8217;t promise to leave Tyrolia alone. He seemed pleased at
this much warning. </p>
<p>JT wanted to take out Britain in a single year, but it didn&#8217;t
seem very likely. He wanted to make sure that French units seized
all British centers, which made it even harder. I proposed a plan
where France would support me into Edinburgh, but this was rejected.
JT then asked again for me to wait on the solo until Britain was completely
conquered, but for all the reasons previously discussed I couldn&#8217;t
do that, so I didn&#8217;t promise it. Of course, I thought he might
just be delaying for time anyway. In spite of what JT was saying,
I didn&#8217;t think he was resigned to a Russian win and I wasn't
about to count my solo as assured until I hit 18! In the end I agreed
to cut support in Norwegian Sea. [JT confided to me that he wouldn&#8217;t
hold off on claiming a solo if he was in Charles&#8217;s position,
but he had to try something or the game was over.] </p>
<p>I mentioned that JT should order his army back up to cover Spain
in case Germany hit Gascony. He asked whether I was dropping hints
to the enemy, which I denied (accurately, at least in this case).
There followed more discussion about whether JT could order Piedmont
to Marseilles without endangering Switzerland. We decided that we
couldn&#8217;t guarantee it, but that it might be okay to lose Switzerland
in the Spring if we could take it back in Fall. It was decided that
I would have a crack at Tyrolia. </p>
<p>At the last minute I sent a message saying I would order units &#8216;south&#8217;
to defend against an Austrian dash for Damascus. I meant this to explain
A Bulgaria to Constantinople and A Sevastapol to Armenia.</p>

<p>The A-G alliance didn&#8217;t attack Switzerland after all. Austria
hit Venetia, while Germany retreated back toward the Rhine. Tiago
advanced toward Egypt, but was dismayed to see me occupy Greece. I
tried to excuse this by pointing out that if I didn&#8217;t, Austria
would keep it another year, but there was no answer. I think war fatigue
was beginning to set in. </p>
<p>Right after the Spring moves, I sent in my preliminary Fall orders.
I was determined not to NMR!</p>
<p>Austria did indeed order A Egypt to Palestine in what looked like
a dash for Damascus, but which I thought might be a bid to support
me in instead. Sure enough, Robert wrote immediately offering the
support in exchange for my leaving both Vienna and Trieste alone.
My initial impulse was to accept, but JT&#8217;s talk about ending
F-I-R on an amicable note was starting to have an effect. If I hadn't
been so close to winning I would probably have agreed to support Austria
as a Janissary/puppet, but it seemed unnecessary. I delayed answering
Robert until after the weekend, when I finally replied that I felt
I had to go for all the centers I could in the Fall. However, I pointed
out, as I had previously, that he could at least save Vienna by ordering
Trieste to Budapest and Venetia to Tyrolia, so he would get a survival.
</p>
<p>The proposal for a Russian solo failed. I had forgotten to vote,
but I was pretty sure JT would veto it anyway. Besides, having come
this far, I wanted to win outright with a clear 18+ centers! </p>
<p>George wrote me and we started talking about the game as though it
was already over, exchanging a few such mails. I thought this *might*
be a ploy to make me overconfident, but I really wasn&#8217;t that
worried. </p>
<p>In F-I-R discussions I agreed to hit Norwegian Sea again so that
JT would be assured of taking London. Soon after that, he too started
talking like the game was already over. </p>
<p>I decided to change my default orders somewhat to include an attack
on Germany. I sent them in (along with press) and waited. And that
was it!</p>

<p align="center"><font size="5"><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></font></p>
<p> Thoughts on various issues that came up during the game&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>British-Russian Relations:</strong> As I said earlier, I&#8217;m
amazed at how often Russia and Britain seem to end up fighting very
early in the game. I think that such conflict is pointless and dangerous
for both of them. For Britain, St. Petersburg is a dead end&#8212;especially
in 1900, where the British start without any army to press further
inland. Even if the BEF did exist, it would be no match for the large
German, Austrian, and Turkish armies that will also be competing for
the other Russian centers. Britain has no business building armies
on that scale and doubly not in sending them so far away from the
homeland. Even if Britain remains content with St. Petersburg alone,
it may still have to defend its prize against a three-unit assault
from the south (or more, if the attacker is Germany using the Reich&#8217;s
Baltic fleet). On the Russian side, the situation is similar. Britain
is too far away to invade, and the Tsar has no business building many
fleets on his north coast. [Of course, there are those who, with merit,
disagree with this assessment.]</p>
<p>On the positive side, this army/fleet dichotomy means that Britain
and Russia have no need to get in each others&#8217; way. In fact,
their natural axes of expansion lie on opposite sides of the board.
Russia is most concerned with the east and Balkans, while Britain
is concerned with the West and the Mediterranean. The only real area
of direct conflict is in Scandinavia. If that can be resolved satisfactorily,
I think that Britain and Russia are among the most compatible neighbors
on the map. The Scandinavian border is easily demilitarized &#8211;
a Russian F St. Petersburg (sc) cannot attack Norway, which can then
be safely vacated. If one of Britain or Russia is being invaded, it
makes sense for the other to seize what he can. Barring that, I think
war between them is generally ill advised. </p>
<p>Of course, things turned out rather differently in this game. That
was due to pressing factors that made me want to get Britain&#8217;s
attention&#8212;namely, the need to rescue France and Italy so I would
have reliable allies on the other side of Austria. If not for the
immediate need to distract Mike from attacking JT and Tiago, I doubt
I wouldn't have taken the British holdings in Scandinavia until the
very end of the game, as per my initial plans. </p>
<p><strong>Russian Steamroller Rule:</strong> I now appreciate how necessary
this rule is! Without it, Russia would have been crippled. I could
never have faced both Turkey and Germany at the same time. As it was,
it was a close thing. If B-G had been fully committed, they could
have taken both Brest and St. Petersburg in 1901. As I pointed out
during the game, I didn&#8217;t actually overtake Germany (who had
lost a home supply center!) in terms of numbers of units until the
beginning of 1902. Even then, I was vulnerable. After Robert&#8217;s
stab I had only two armies in position to face him in 1903. It was
only when I grew to eleven in 1904 that I started to feel a little
secure. </p>
<p>Baron already explains his rationale for the Russian Steamroller
Rule in the Gamers&#8217; Guide to 1900, and I would add that Russia&#8217;s
two starting fleets mean that at least one unit will normally be unable
to intervene on either the northern or southern front. </p>
<p>As far as balance is concerned, I don&#8217;t believe the Russian
Steamroller Rule is unbalancing. While Russia&#8217;s alliances did
well in this game, I believe that was due less to the extra unit than
to carefully considered tactics and superb co-ordination between the
allies. While Russia did well individually, I think that was simply
because I was never attacked. If the &#8220;stop Russia&#8221; negotiations
had worked out or if the A-B alliance had been better coordinated,
I think I could still have been contained. </p>
<p><strong>A-R Alliance vs Germany and Turkey:</strong> In the Fall
&#8216;00 adjudication, Baron said that Robert and I had just shown
how effective an A-R alliance could be against both Turkey and Germany
at the same time. He even called us &#8220;ruthless&#8221; &#8211;
a compliment I will treasure forever. However, I&#8217;m not sure
the A-R proved as effective against the Kaiser as Baron had hoped
it would be. </p>
<p>While we were able to dispatch Turkey in record time, especially
with Italy&#8217;s help, we had a much harder time of it against Germany.
Even with French and Italian aid against the Reich, Germany managed
to stay at six for two years while fending off our combined might.
It was only by working with Britain that I managed to knock George
down to four (and just in time, too!). If it had held together (a
big if) I think the awkward F-A-I-R alliance would eventually have
worn Germany down on its own, but it would have been more difficult
than you would normally expect in a four-against-one fight. <br>
Given this, I think that A-R has only limited prospects against Germany
unless they are joined by at least one other power able to hit the
Kaiser with fleets on the other side or Russia is able to send a fleet
or two to the North Sea. In this game, the alternative to getting
British help would have been a long Russian march through Scandinavia,
leaving me open to an Austrian stab.</p>
<p><em>[I think Charles is being pessimistic about A/R&#8217;s chances
against Germany. In this contest, Britain didn&#8217;t pile on Germany
until &#8217;02, France never attacked German soil, Italian aid against
Germany was actually rather minimal, and A/R &#8220;cooperation&#8221;
was strained at best. Even so, Austria-Hungary reached 10 SCs by &#8217;02,
while Russia was at 8 SCs. In the meantime, Germany had been reduced
to 4 SCs and Turkey had been utterly destroyed. From my perspective,
that&#8217;s an impressive performance for A/R. Needless to say, if
the 4-Power A/F/I/R alliance had held, Germany would have been crushed
like a bug, not slowly worn down as Charles suggests. I estimate the
Reich would have been eliminated in &#8217;03. Only the ensuing Austro-Russian
conflict enabled Germany to avoid complete annihilation.....B.M Powell]</em></p>
<p><strong>F-I Alliance:</strong> The F-I alliance in this game was
obviously very solid. I don&#8217;t think we got to see the full potential
of an F-I because both countries spent most of their time in defense.
We didn&#8217;t even get to see them co-operate fully against Germany.
They were only able to fight Britain and not with their full strength.
</p>
<p>One thing that struck me, however, was how vital they were to each
other&#8217;s defense. Thanks to early Italian neutrality (which I
thought made sense, since Italy didn&#8217;t seem likely to get much
territory if France fell to a B-G alliance) and later help, JT was
able to weather the initial B-G attack and eventually turn the tide
against Britain, even though Mike held a positional advantage. France&#8217;s
survival was also due to A-R interventions, of course, but I think
Italy&#8217;s role was crucial. </p>
<p>From the Russian point of view, the F-I alliance was a huge plus.
I&#8217;m surprised F-I hadn&#8217;t happened before. I would expect
any Tsar to push for it as hard as possible! As it was, F-I-R was
my preferred combination from the start and I was glad to see it form.
As an added bonus, relations between France/Britain and Italy/Austria
each became terrible. It wasn&#8217;t exactly the kind of sandwich
I&#8217;d envisioned when planning my strategy for this game, but
it was close enough. Under these circumstances I was able to attack
Scandinavia and the Balkans with impunity.</p>
<p><strong>Austrian Stab in Fall &#8216;02:</strong> I&#8217;ve already
identified Robert&#8217;s stab of Italy as a turning point in the
game. It was a bold gamble. Diplomatically it did him a lot of damage,
ending any hope of good Austrian relations with Italy and France.
However, the truth is that by that point JT and I had already agreed
that Tiago would be a better long-term ally than Robert. The diplomatic
damage had already been done and we were headed toward F-I-R anyway.
[Just as Robert feared all along.] Given this, the stab wasn&#8217;t
really such a bad choice. If anything, it may have been Robert&#8217;s
best chance of changing the diplomatic scene and forcing me into a
B-A-R. However, it did sabotage his relationships with everyone except
Britain and I suspect that hurt him when he later tried to organize
an alliance to stop me.</p>
<p>Militarily, the stab was brilliantly done and it was made all the
more effective by the way Tiago left himself open to it (presumably
due to Robert&#8217;s negotiations). I remain utterly convinced that
if I had hesitated to come to Italy&#8217;s rescue, the game would
have ended in an Austrian solo. Even as it was, it was a very close
thing. For several turns afterward, it looked like Italy would be
slowly ground down, center by center. If Robert had focused exclusively
on finishing off Italy before turning eastward again to face me or
if he had made more efforts to get Germany on his side, [or if Britain
had taken Egypt in Fall &#8217;03 as Austria-Hungary had planned,]
I think he might have pulled it off. </p>
<p>Fortunately for me, though, he didn&#8217;t win over George and my
attack seemed to distract him. There were also problems in the Austrian
relationship with Britain &#8211; Robert and Mike failed to coordinate
their moves properly. In contrast, the F-I-R alliance discussed tactics
thoroughly, and made sure that our moves were completely coordinated.
Combined with a few A-B mistakes (particularly the failure to take
Egypt), that turned the tide. But it was a worthy effort!</p>
<p>So I guess that&#8217;s all I have to say (more than enough, eh?),
except to thank everyone again for a most enjoyable game!</p>

<p>I was seriously considering including the end game comments of all
of the players, but given the extreme length of this article I decided
against it. I hope you all found Charles&#8217;s observations as interesting
and educational as I did. Happy Stabbing!<br>
