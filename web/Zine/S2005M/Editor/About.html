<td align="justify"> <p>Well It's Spring 2005 and that means another issue
of the Pouch. As I get older I notice how time seems to slip by...and
how deadlines fast approach. Randy also mentioned that he notices the
sound that deadlines make...&quot;whoosh&quot; as they go by. Yes, this
is a late issue, and I won't bore you with the details.</p>
<p>But on to the here and now!! This spring issue might look a little
light on its feet at first glance, but first glances can be deceiving.
While we only have 4 articles, you will find that there is still a bit
on content. Indeed you will find that the Baron&#8217;s article &#8220;Monte
Carlo&#8221;, a small book, having been converted from a 36-page word
document.</p>
<p>As most of you know, Paradox Interactive is developing a video game
version of Diplomacy in their own unique style. We contacted them and
were graciously allowed an interview!! We hope that this will wet your
appetite until the game comes out later this year. When we know more,
we will let you know.</p>
<p>Because we value the input our readership, I have been thinking about
something for the last month. A reader suggested that it might be better
to have a more dynamic site, if articles were published on a more regular
basis. This has been sitting in the back of my head for a while I mull
it over. Well mulling stuff over by yourself is grand, I believe that
it would be better to get your opinion.</p>
<p>What would you think of limiting the Dip Pouch to only 2 issues a year
and publishing one other article a month (except for the months of the
Spring and Fall issues). What this does it take an issue and &frac12;
and stretch it over a year. I would love your suggests, rants, or raves.
So drop us a line using the Dear Dip page, we&#8217;d love to hear from
you&#8230;.</p>

<p align="left">Well on to my past reflections...</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<p><strong>Past Reflections</strong></p>
<p align="justify">Before talking about another 2 articles from the past,
I wanted to close the loop on one of the &quot;Past Reflections&quot;
articles that was featured last issue:<a href="/Zine/F1999R/Debate/paradox.html">Eliminating
the Paradox in Diplomacy</a> (F1999R). This article went into detail
about a paradox in diplomacy with 2 solutions (in which both were right
by the way). Of course, you are probably wondering what become of that
discussion? Did it die? What choice did the DPJudge make? </p>
<p align="justify">That leads me to a the next article for this issues'
&quot;Past Reflection&quot;. The first one is actually the pouch deposits
for the W1999A issue. The mail was so overwelming that they had to create
a deposits section just for that article alone! Take a glance at the
stir that article caused. I hope that one day we can bring that kind
of excitement to Pouch again. The second item I want to point out to
you is not an article, but the resolution to the problem. The DPjudge
uses solution 1 from the above article and the documentation for it
can be found below</p>
<p align="justify">&quot;But wait...Manus coded the DPjudge for solution
one? But you said both were correct and I want to use Solution 2!&quot;
Well knowing that some people will want that option, you can add a rule
to your games to allow for this. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/Zine/W1999A/Clarke/paradox_response.html" align="justify">W1999A
Pouch Deposits</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.floc.net/dpjudge/?page=Questions#7" align="justify">What
rule does the DPjudge use?</a></li>
<li><a href="/dpjudge?page=Rules#SAFE_CONVOYS">Rule
SAFE_CONVOYS</a></li>
</ul>
<p align="justify">The other article is from one author that I absolutely
loved. His articles are beautifully written. The one I would love you
to read is one called &quot;Chainsaw Diplomacy&quot;. I'll take a quote
from the article: </p>
<p align="justify">&quot;<em>There are times, however, when all of your
best laid plans have gone astray. There are times when you need most
to be heard by someone who is least inclined to listen. These are occasions
that call for a more aggressive tone and style. Every once in a great
while, the occasion calls for Chainsaw Diplomacy.</em>&quot;</p>
<p align="justify">It is a great read and adds another tool for your diplomacy
toolbelt. It goes against conventional wisdom of being nice in conversations,
but it comes at a price. Give it a read and let me know what you think.</p>
