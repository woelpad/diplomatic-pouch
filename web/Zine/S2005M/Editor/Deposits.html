<p>Hi friends,<br>
I live Mexico City and I am a fan of Diplomacy. I just found you in
the internet and am very happy for this opportunity. Years ago I did
play by post Diplomacy, and it took a lot of time to end some games,
unless you surrendered from boredom. Here is a new, for me, way to play.
<br>
<br>
Are there any players who live in Mexico, so we can play sometime, face
to face? I have two sons who can, and love to, play Diplomacy. Please
give my best compliments to the people who work at all the necesary
jobs to be done, to have success in Diplomacy&#8217;s development. </p>
<p>Reciba un atento y cordial saludo de: <br>
Julio Sanz C. </p>
<p> direccion de correo electronico: <br>
56611850@prodigy.net.mx <br>
Mexico, D. F. <br>
</p>
<p><em>[Editors Note: Well Thanks for the compliment Julio. Generallly
This kind of email would go to the face to face section, but I felt
it best to post it here. I will send this along to the editor of that
section to update. I have personal contact information for anybody in
the Mexico city area that wants to get in touch with Julio, just please
contact me.]</em></p>

<p><em>[Editor's Note: in the Pouch Deposits in the F2004M issue Adrien
submitted a letter about the paradox problem. In it I mentioned that
I didn't know the answer to which solution the DPjudge used, but that
I would find out. Please see the &quot;<a href="/Zine/S2005M/Editor/About.html">About
the Diplomatic Pouch</a>&quot; for the answer.]</em></p>
<p><B>Andy writes about Adrien's <a href="/Zine/F2004M/Editor/Deposits.html#Paradox">letter</a>
to the Pouch in F2004M:</B> </p>
<p>I read the article, but the voting buttons seemed broken. In response
to the gut reaction question I selected rule 2, and was presented with
<br>
a blank screen. Using back and the can't decide button I saw the arguments
for the two rules, but all of the buttons then led to a blank screen.</p>
<p><em>[Editor's Note: Manus looked into the buttons and repaired them.
They now work although they do not tally votes anymore.]</em></p>
<p>Adrien's second proposal suggests that a beleaguered garrison is dislodged
if the balanced attacking forces exceed the defending force. That <br>
is a bad resolution as it affects non-paradox situations, and is likely
to happen in practice. Also, it doesn't resolve the modified paradox
if Mao s Eng is added, as there is a 2 on 2 on 2 situation.</p>
<p>Adrien's first proposal also seems bad to me. It seems to be saying
an attacked unit cannot convoy or support. Again, it affects non-paradox
<br>
situations, and happens all the time. Of course normally support is
cut by an attack, unless support is for an attack on the attacking unit
and the supporter is not dislodged. However, that exception is quite
common. Also the rule effectively means only a single attack on a convoying
fleet is required to stop the convoy.</p>
<p>On first reading I didn't realise the first rule in the article applied
in non-paradox situations, but the arguments for both rules do point
this out. That suggests to me the combination of the two rules may be
better, as follows.</p>
<p> <strong>Paradox-eliminating Rule Number 1:</strong> &quot;If a convoyed
army attacks a fleet that is supporting an action in or into a body
of water that contains a convoying fleet, that support is not cut by
the convoyed army under any circumstance (but a convoying army does
cut all other supports normally).&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Paradox-eliminating Rule Number 2:</strong> &quot;If a situation
arises in which an army's convoy order results in a paradoxical adjudication,
the turn is adjudicated as if the convoying army had been ordered to
hold.&quot; </p>
<p><strong>Paradox-eliminating Rule Number 3</strong>: &quot;If a situation
arises in which an army's convoy order results in a paradoxical adjudication,
then if that convoyed army attacks a fleet that is supporting an action
in or into a body of water that contains a convoying fleet, that support
is not cut by the convoyed army under any circumstance (but a convoying
army does cut all other supports normally).&quot; </p>
<p>An advantage of rule one over rule two is that both rules require support
not to be cut, and rule one goes no further. The advantage of rule three
over rule one is that it doesn't change existing non-paradoxical adjudications.</p>

<p>Randy Lawrence-Hurt,</p>
<p>As the poor fool who played Turkey in regularflavor, I don't think
that the game makes a very good example of the point you make in your
DP article. At no point did I truly consider Italy to be a strong ally,
nor did I see the expansion path through Russia as more tantalising
than the one through Italy. We were not allied for years as you suggest
but for a brief period while I made serious diplomatic and tactical
blunders.</p>
<p>The game started as a fairly powerful AT through 1903, which I destroyed
when I misjudged Italy and France's intentions and made a poor stab
of Austria. Our alliance was more the result of that badly timed stab
by me of Austria. Had I not been distracted by your well placed suggestions
that I attack Austria and France's offers of help which never materialised
then we would have never entered our short lived alliance.</p>
<p> The Italian Turkish alliance lasted only one year until you and France
stabbed me an exposed the error of my plans against Austria. I congratulate
you on your victory, but I don't think that it was an example of an
Italian-Turkish alliance made good.</p>
<p>Yours,<br>
Josh Uretsky</p>
<p>P.S. At least I got my revenge in the sequel, an example of why France
and Italy can fight in their first years and still solo.</p>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH=100% SIZE="-1" COLOR="GRAY"> <p>Josh,</p>
<p> You make a good point. I suppose regularflavor wasn't the best example
I could have come up with, as you're right, it doesn't show an ITALY
alliance from the beginning. I mentioned it, however, because I did,
for a short while, consider you an ally. Granted, this only lasted a
year or so, until France and I got rolling, but I thought it made a
decent example of Italy and Turkey being allied for a little while,
and the advantages given to Italy by this. I still hold the ITALY to
be the best, in most circumstances, alliance for Italy, despite its
risks.</p>
<p>Regards,<br>
Randy</p>
<p>P.S. Oh, and hearty congratulations on your win in regularflavor2;
I haven't gotten around to sending my EOG yet, though I plan to, and
maybe I can explain my position in that game a bit better.</p>

<H3>Players Needed For A 1900 Diplomacy Tournament</H3>
</CENTER>
<HR ALIGN="CENTER" WIDTH=100% SIZE="-1" COLOR="GRAY">
<!------------------------------------------------------------>
<!----------------------- Topic Header ----------------------->
<p>We all know and love Baron Powell&#8217;s great variant, 1900. Everyone
loves the improved play balance, the increased player interaction, and
the greater historical accuracy. Over the seven years since the variant
was first playtested, there are lots of people who have whetted their
appetites by indulging in the variant. Now is your chance to try you
hand against the best of the best -- the best players from the DPJudge
and the non-judge PBEM games. </p>
<ul>
<li> To register as a player, contact Aki Halme at &lt;akihalme@surfeu.fi&gt;.
You will need to provide your full name and current e-mail addresses.
The 49 seats in the tournament will be awarded on a first come, first
served basis.</li>
<li> It is a three round tournament. Everyone plays in the first two
rounds. In the first two rounds, one will neither play the same power
twice nor play any of the same opponents twice. The seven players
with the highest cumulative scores from the first two rounds will
advance to a final round championship table. The games of the first
two rounds will last from 1900 to 1909, and the game of the final
round championship table will have no time limit.</li>
<li> All the games for the tournament will be run on the DPJudge. Players
will need to register to play on the DPJudge, if they are not already
registered. All games will have the following settings:
<ul>
<li> ALWAYS_WAIT,</li>
<li> WHITE_GREY,</li>
<li> LIST_UNORDERED,</li>
<li> EAVESDROP!,</li>
<li> NO_DIAS,</li>
<li> MUTE_OBSERVERS,</li>
<li> CIVIL_DISORDER in effect starting from 1903,</li>
<li>CD_BUILDS in effect starting from 1903,</li>
<li>CD_RETREATS in effect starting from 1903,</li>
<li> NO_REVEAL until the tournament is completed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> The tournament is for individuals only; there is no team aspect.</li>
<li> The tournament is set to begin on June 1, 2005. The pace of the
tournament will be a full game year every two weeks. That means that
the first two rounds will take at least forty weeks, plus whatever
extensions may be necessary and required. Expect a full year commitment
to participate in the tournament.</li>
</ul>
<p><br>
<strong>From the 1900 Designer,</strong><br>
<em>&quot;I've been pleased by the reception 1900 has received from
the Diplomacy community since it was first introduced seven years ago.
The variant's increasing popularity on such forums as USDPJudge seems
to confirm my own belief that 1900 offers something that fans of Diplomacy
find appealing. Now, it appears the variant is taking another step forward
by becoming the focus of an on-line tournament. At this time I cannot
help but feel the future of 1900 is bright indeed.</em></p>
<p><em> Before the games begin, I want to the acknowledge the tournament
organizers, GMs, and players. Without you, this event would not be possible.
I wish all of the tournament participants the best of luck and I look
forward to seeing how the games play themselves out. May the best diplomat
win!&quot;</em></p>
<p><em> Happy Stabbing,<br>
Baron P</em><em>owell (VonPowell)</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong><br>
Of course, everyone wants to know how the games will be scored to determine
the seven players who will advance to the final round championship table.
The scoring system developed rewards both influence and outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li> The influence is determined through a sum value of the annual supply
center counts throughout the game. To determine this sum value, total
the number of supply centers held by each power at the end of each
game year. Those powers that start with only three supply centers
get +1 added to their total number of supply centers unless they have
been eliminated from the board. The point value per supply center
goes up by one each year, beginning with 10 points awarded for supply
centers held at the end of year 1900. Points for the final game year
are provided an additional +1. So as not to give an edge to longer
games, each power's influence points are divided by the sum of the
points of all seven players, then multiplied by 390. Fractions are
rounded so that the total will be exactly 390. </li>
<li> The outcome is weighed by awarding 180 points amongst the winners
when the game ends, or when DIAS is called at the end of 1909. This
outcome points are forfeited in the rare case of a seven-way draw.
</li>
<li> The sum of the influence points and the outcome points is the final
score for that power in the game. Two examples of the use of the scoring
system can be found below. </li>

history!</p>
<p align="left">The Potomac Tea &amp; Knife Society (PTKS) is very pleased
to invite you to the <strong>Fifteenth World Diplomacy Championship
(WDC XV)</strong> to be held at the <a href="http://www.holidayinncapitol.com/">Holiday
Inn Capitol</a> from 29-31 July 2005!</p>
<p align="left">The <a href="http://www.holidayinncapitol.com/">Holiday
Inn Capitol</a> is the ideal venue for this event, offering great gaming
space and an excellent location--just a block from the Washington, D.C.
Metro--which makes the entire city accessible to our guests who want
to see all of the sights Washington has to offer.</p>
<p align="left">And it couldn't be easier to get here from there! The
Washington, D.C. metropolitan area is served by three major airports:</p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.bwiairport.com/">Baltimore-Washington International
Airport (BWI)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.mwaa.com/national/">Ronald W.Reagan National
Airport (DCA)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.metwashairports.com/Dulles/">Washington-Dulles
International Airport (IAD)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In fact, Reagan National is just a few Metro stops away from the hotel!</p>
<p align="left">For those who prefer the train, Washington D.C.'s <a href="http://www.unionstationdc.com/">Union
Station</a>, is also just a few Metro stops from the hotel.</p>
<p align="left">Would you rather drive--find I-95 and drive north or south
as appropriate. You won't be able to miss D.C., and the traffic on the
Beltway will give you plenty of time to admire the sights!</p>
<p align="left">The <a href="http://www.holidayinncapitol.com/">Holiday
Inn Capitol</a> is in the final stages of a complete renovation. The
rooms are large, comfortable and, at $129 per night, very affordable.
They also include in-room Hi-Speed Internet access at no additional
charge. You can reserve those rooms now, by phone or online at the website
above. Just use this three digit code: <strong>WDG </strong>to get the
reduced rate.</p>
<p align="left">Diplomacy in D.C. with the Pitkissers as your host? Do
you really want to take a chance on missing this? I didn't think so.
