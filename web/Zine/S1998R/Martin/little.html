   On the trip down to World DipCon VIII, excellently run by David Hood and
   the Carolina Amateur Diplomats (hooray!). There was much speculation
   as to how one would be able to get to the final round. Surely anyone
   who had a "name" in the hobby, and there were a bunch of 'em there, believe
   you me!, would be at a disadvantage, as well as anyone who did really well
   in the first or second round. So it was my intention from the beginning
   to play a strong-but-unspectacular first game, take a few chances the second
   game, and to play all-out the third and fourth rounds.
   
  <p>
   This proved to be a pretty solid strategy. I pulled Turkey in
   the opening game, and had Larry Peery as Russia to the north. We
   struck a deal that would let us fight our own fights, without doing a
   traditional Juggernaut. He went north and east; I fought for the Balkans.
   And this brings me to the first virtue of Being the Little Guy:
   
   <dl>
   <dt><b>1) Patience Pays Off

  <p><dd>
   The big problem with Turkey without a strong Russian ally is that A/I
   can slowly chew away at you. But, in my experience, something will
   usually happen, around 1904 or so, that will cause one of them to falter,
   If I am still alive and kicking then, I thought, I should be in good shape.
   Especially since, to my good fortune, no one was coming out as a strong
   winner on the other side of the board. Eventually, I got "out of
   the box," and was up to 12 centers when the board voted a two-way R/T.
   It was late on the first night, and I felt pretty good about the round.
   Solid performance, and while the game was really by no means over, I decided
   that a two-way would probably stand up in the final accounting as a "good
   board." There weren't many two-way draws, and a lot of three- and four-ways.
   
  <p>
   In Round 2, I drew Germany, and was the victim of the dreaded Western
   Triple. Yes, I meant that. In tournaments, the W3 rarely works out
   for Germany, but I figured this was my round to be bold, and it wasn't
   impossible that it could work! So, I supported France through Munich,
   worked England into St. Pete, and was on the verge of Warsaw when England
   stabbed me...for Belgium. That was it, a one center stab,
   but in the end, it forced France to choose between me and England, and
   heck, he already had Munich! However, I learned virtue #2 of Being
   the Little Guy:
   
  <p><dt><b>
   2) Bold, Honorable Play Pays Off
  </b>
  <p><dd>
   France and I were tight in this game, and if England hadn't stabbed
   (badly -- no I'm not bitter, I just hate to see a bad stab)
   we almost certainly
   would have had a three-way. Nonetheless, word got around the boards that
   I could be trusted, and having only a two center (one center? I forget)
   survival, this was clearly the game to drop.
   
  <p>
   So to Round 3. I draw England, and Vincent Mous, inventor of the
   Modern Variant, is France. A fellow named Steve Mauritas (sp?) is
   Germany, and I find myself forced to decide on my strategy for the game
   in 1901. On the one had, Vincent, will make an excellent ally, his
   tactics will be sound, and in the end, he can almost certainly out-play
   me given a chance. On the Other Hand, Steve is (As far as I could
   tell, I had met him at PrezCon previously) a solid player, without
   much feel for the endgame, who, as Germany, would almost certainly have
   bigger problems than me! I convince Steve to work with me for Vincent's
   demise. And So it goes. A Relentless assault on our part, and
   Italian intervention in Iberia, seal Vince's fate. No one can fight three
   at a time, but he holds on until 1904, when he goes from four centers to
   zero.
   (ouch!)
   
  <p>
   And, just when things are looking pretty rosy for the E/G alliance,
   Russia springs west, and captures Munich. A long fight ensues, wherein
   the R/A/I alliance scrambles to get to the Stalemate line. And here
   I learned virtues 3 and 4:
   
  <p><dt><b>
   3) Alliances Pay Off
  </b>
  <p><dd>
   Steve was brilliant as Germany. At one point he had 5 centers,
   four units and only one home center, With his other three behind our lines
   in France. (I'm pretty sure he had a fleet in Portugal!) As
   hard as R/A tried, they couldn't break past him. I held the North
   in an Iron Hand, but Italy, in the process of taking down France, had gotten
   the West Med locked up. For four years I had to wait and not stab Germany.
   I mean, those four centers were mine, whenever I wanted them -- but as
   England, I couldn't project the power onto the continent, to take His position,
   and prevent R/A from getting past Switzerland. Four years went by, and
   at that point, John Quarto (austria) approached me. He also had a
   two-way draw in round one. We both agreed that a four- or five-way draw was
   no good for anyone. I said "As soon as you stab Italy, I'll stab
   Germany", and I encouraged Russia to look to Austrian centers for growth
   as I put full-court-press on the Med. Virtue #4?
   
  <p><dt><b>
   4) Patience Pays Off
  </b>
  <p><dd>
   Sure enough, Austria stabs Italy. Russia stabs Austria.
   Italy abandons the Med, and heads home to take down the Archduke.
   My fleets scream into the Med, getting to Tunis and threatening the Italian
   home centers. Russia and Austria spar at seven centers each for two years,
   exchanging something like eight SC's in the process. And I get a little
   bigger each year. Russia invites me into Warsaw to help him against
   Austria, and at this point Steve, my erstwhile ally says "Y'know something,
   Chris? There are 18 SC's behind our lines. I wouldn't be too
   upset if you stab me for the solo. Just give me credit in The Diplomatic
   Pouch. (Okay, he didn't say the part about the credit in The Pouch, but it
   sounds nice.) So I did, and a mis-written order takes me to seventeen (I
   wrote Picardy instead of Paris), and the board votes me the solo so we
   can get some sleep!
  </dl> 
  <p>
   In the end, a solo and a two-way were just barely enough to get me the
   win. As the Little Guy, the one who no one had really heard of, and
   who certainly didn't appear capable of taking the whole shebang, I was,
   I think, a little underestimated -- if only as someone not to "key onto."
   Many of the veterans, like Simon, Manus, and Edi, had such strong reputations
   going in that they probably fared less well than if they had equal abilities
   and no reputation. <i>[I hope not.  I intend to win someday, despite any
   notoriety I might have.  --MH]</i>
   My last thought on the matter is one about tournaments,
   and something I learned while competing in Ballroom Dancing:
   
  <blockquote><p><em>
     Win the Tournament, Not The Event</em>
   </p></blockquote>
  
  <p>
   If you focus too hard on getting the solo win in every game at a tournament,
   odds are against it happening. Have fun, play boldly, with solid
   tactics and reasonable diplomacy.  That was my formula, and it worked for me!
   
  <p>
   See ya in Belgium!
