Manus,

Sorry for the delay, I didn't finish before I had to go out of town  . . .

I have two things here:

Reflections on the Merits of Becoming World Diplomacy Champion
(Or, How I Lost My Friends, and My Allies become Enemies)
by Chris Martin

And

"Be the Little Guy",
(Or Never let them See you Win)

Not long after I returned from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, I opened some
E-mail to discover a letter to the Cat-23 Chat list, from Mike Ashland.  Mike
asked:

"What does it take to become the World Champion of Diplomacy?"

I thought, 'how particularly timely!', and jotted off a reply, the gist of
which was:

"Go to the World Diplomacy Championship, wherever it may be held, and win.
Simple.  I just did it!"

This, simple, innoccent remark, made totally in a fun and facietious manner,
was the begining of a cycle of hatred, envy, and uglyness, which has not ended
yet.  Or, as my associate and perhaps only remaining diplo-friend says:
"Bummer of a Birthmark, Hal."  (This is in reference to a "Far Side" Cartoon.
Those of you not familiar with the genre might find this enlightening.  Two
Deer are standing in the woods, and one has a 'target', concentric circles, on
its chest.  The other one comments on the unpleasentless of such markings.  In
America, this passes handily as humor.)

Indeed, there has been more shock and disbelief that I was able to come away
with this honor than can at first be acounted for by reasonable means.  While
the initial reaction was positive -- good show, pip pipi, that sort of thing,
--as evidenced by one Brian Ecton, another legend of the hobby's post to the
Cat23

"CONGRATULATIONS TO CHRIS MARTIN, OF CAT23 FAME FOR HIS 2 SOLOS AFTER
BEING WITH US ONLY 5 MONTHS!

HE IS THE WORLD CHAMPION!  THE MAN THE LEGEND!  AFTER AN AMAZING SHOWING
IN WHICH HE HAD A SOLO AND A TWO WAY!

Cat23 players beware!  Chris is on the loose and is most assuredly no joke!

My hat is off to you Mr. Martin"

Soon things took on a slightly different note.  Phil wrote

"Actually, Blue just pointed out to me that I beat Chris in Dip174 (I am
Britain, he France).....my fifteen seconds of fame! :) <hehe>"

And Mr. G.A. Flowers:

" be thankful i wasn't in that solo win of yours.  mark my word i
would have forced a 7-way draw if i had to."

Then it finally came to a head, when one of the regular members of "The Old
Republic" learned of the victory.  His reply:

       " I return home from a long and difficult business trip in full
anticipation of finally seeing my family and enjoying a relaxing weekend
together only to see my "friends" trying to ruin it with this vile,
heathenistic blasphemy. And here I thought it was illegal to send
pornography over the internet! Some day Tim, God will get you for the
things that you do!

RM"

(It should be pointed out at this time that Tim Richardson is the person named
here.  Aside from running The Old Republic, the e-zine whos motto is "Our
players are so good, the World Champion of Diplomacy Regularly gets handed his
head!"  (Its a little long, I think, but maybe I'm biased), maintaining the
Face-to-Face section of the Diplomatic Pouch, is also the current Prince of
Darkness.  This has been firmly established.  please direct any inquiries
regarding the PoD to rusty@ici.net.  He is currently in charge of all
investigations of the PoD's activities, nefarious and (rarely) otherwise.)

Never fear, I thought, some of my comerades will leap to my defense. Well,
first Ben offered his congratulations.:

"Hey Chris!  Also other former "ADAMites" - call the exterminator.

Great news, Chris. Congratulations on your victory.."

This only incensed RM further.

"Ben,

        You're not actually buying this charade are you? This is just another
sick and evil scheme from the twisted minds of Timothy Richardson,
Michael McMillie and.... well ... you know who... our "World Champion".
It's devised to torment their fellow man. C'mon Ben, let's consider the
source of this news!

        Enless... you're in on it!!! BEN!!! How could you??? After all we've
meant to one another, you would would perpetuate this foul concoction
with these perverted minds! You've burst my bubble here Ben. You've
rained on my parade. You've pissed on my rose garden. My God Ben, why
don't you just tell me that my little sister dates Kennedys!"

At this point , the Prince of Darkness, father of lies, etc. etc., stepped into
the fray:

"Clearly, Roland's under a lot of stress.

He's cracked, folks, CRACKED!  All this paranoia conspiracy Oliver Stone
nonsense when we all know it was ROLAND who conspired two games running to
get "Smacko" his two ADAM victories.

And we all know that it's Roland's _daughter_ who's dating Kennedys!"

Needless to say, this did little to help the situation.

"I'm cracked???? I would have to be cracked to believe this! I would
have to fall through a crack! I would have to have my head up my crack!
In fact I would probably have to be _on_ Crack to believe that out
little RAT killer, out little one unit wonder, is "World Champion"! So
what does that make Smacko? Galatic Champion?

        Take note gentlemen, just for future reference, as to how easy it is to

work the Beltway mentality and logic into Diplomacy. Notice first the
general "Non-denial denial" approach here. Then you call into question
your opponents sanity, shift the blame for the stab and finally you
change the subject. We need to write a book on this Tim! Hahahaha!

        I just want to know three things: who's idea was it, how many of you
were in on it and how many beers did it take to come up with the idea?
Excellent and interesting try though boyz. I do appreciate the effort!
:-)

RM"

Ouch!  It was the one-unit wonder crack (as it were) that really hurt.  It is
well known in the circles in which I move that I am one of the deadliest
players in the game with one unit left.  Seriously.  Empires have been
toppled.  Berlin to Kiel!  Berlin to Kiel!

Ahem.  Sorry -- had a bit of a flashback there.  I'm better now.  Where was I?
Ah, yes, RM  still believes this is a fiction.  Never Fear!  The Prince of
Darkness jumps right back in!

"I think this pretty much verifies what I was saying.  I mean, such raving is
hardly characteristic... OK, maybe is does sound a little like Roland's old
self.  The beer had nothing to do with it.  I mean, it's not a joke.  I am
_serious_.  Really.  Guys... tell him!

--Tim"

The Silence was Deafening.

"Yeah guys, tell me! See Tim, you haven't managed to
corrupt everybody yet. Their silence is selling you down
the river! So this was all your idea, huh?

RM"

Well, I thought, Surely Mike McMillie, My teamate and oft-times conqueror, will
set the record straight.  He was there.  He has an un-impeachable record, and
should the situation warrant it, he can try to convince Mr. Peabody to use the
Way-Back Machine to fix things so that his account is accurate.  Sure Enough,
he comes to my rescue.

"Roland and all

Yes Roland, one of those really sad days in history. Mark it on your
calender, 24 May 98, the day the earth stood still and Mr Martin was
pronounced King of the Diplomacy world."

So far, I thought, So Good.  Smacko was really coming through for me!

(Smacko, or 'Soldier Minus Ability, Co-ordination, and Knowledge' is Mr.
McMillie's affectionate nickname.  Seriously.  He's got it on his liscence
plates.  No joke!)

But then comes the accounting.  Note that, not only does he transpose my first
and third rounds . . . well, see for yourself!

"Chris pulled off one of those easy boards in round one and wound up
having 6 people fight each other and let him run amuk on the board.
Then rather than stand up like men and turn to face the filthy swine,
they continued to ignore him until  the end was inevitable. No real
allies, no need to really diplome, but as luck would have it, they
handed him the win. Now that is not to say he didn't have some fun
and actually make a tactical decision or two (not to mentioned he did
have to stay up until 3 before they conceded the inevitable) so there
was some Diplomacy playing involved."

Lies!  Scurruoulous Lies!  It was in Round Three!

"In his second round (the team event, where he was to help Tim and
me), he was Germany and failed miserably, letting down his teammates
(no I shall not say that he has any friends) who both scored quite
well that round (overall the TOR team finished 5th, but if Chris
could have ordered something other than 'Berlin to Kiel' and kept up
even his home centers we would have placed better."

Note the Petty comments.  The Daggers are really starting to come out now!

"Chris did well in the third round and scored a two-way, again with
little opposition. This lead to his big decision. The rules of the
road were your bottom score was dropped and the remainder (2 or three
games) were then averaged to determine your final score. The wimp
decided that his round two would be dropped and rather than charge
forward like a man he slunk to the corner and let his solo and 2-way
stand, thinking any other game would only hurt his score. A REAL Dip
player would have gone all 4 rounds (I did) and take his lumps as
best as possible."

Lies Again!  It was the First Round!  And can he let it stand at that!  N o o o
o!  The final blow came at the end, as I guess is typical for final blows:

"I just want to reitterate that in the 4th round, I got to play
against John Quarto as I was higher up in the rankings and so was he.
I managed to stiff arm him enough that he could only get a 3 way and
that was the difference between the Sultana finishing first or
second. I should have bagged the last round. ;-)"

( In the first game I played on The Old Republic the Prince of Darkness
mistakenly represented me as female to certain other players in the game.  This
has led, as one might imagine, to some . . . humor at my expense.  Most
recently as the "Sultana of Swing")


Sigh.  All of this for a plaque (unengraved), a moment of applause, some neat
Babylon5 cards (if only I had someone to play against!) and a
most-expenses-paid trip to Belgium next year to defend the Title.  I ask you,
is the Glory of Winning the World Diplomcay Championship worth the backbiting,
the second-guessing, the infighting that have been the result of it?  The
"Target" that is now painted on my back wherever I go?  Can it possibly be
worth the whispers, and the "yeah, I can take him"'s and the young dip-slingers
constantly seeking em out to challenge the "Champ"?

Well, yes, of course it is.  What else would you expect after winning a
Diplomacy Tournament?


Be the Little Guy

On the trip down to World DipCon8, excellently run by David Hood and the
Carolina Amature Diplomats (hooray!)  There was much speculation as to how one
would be able to get to the final round.  Surely anyone who had a "Name" in the
hobby, and there were a bunch of em there, believe you me!, would be at a
disadvantage, as well as anyone who did really well in the first or second
round.  So it was my intention from the begining to play a
strong-but-unspectacular first game, take a few chances the second game, and to
play all-out the third and fourth rounds.

This proved to be a pretty solid strategy.  I pulled Turkey in the opening
game, and had Larry Peery as russia to the north.  We struck a deal that would
let us fight our own fights, without doing a traditional Steamroller.  He went
north and east, I fought for the Balkans.  And this brings me to the first
Virtue of Being the Little Guy

1) Paitience pays off.

The big problem with Turkey without a strong Russian ally is that A/I can
slowly chew away at you.  But, in my experience, something will usually happen,
around 1904 or so, that will cause one of them to falter,  If I am still alive
and kicking then, I thought, I should be in good shape.  Especially since, to
my good fortune, noone was coming out as a strong winner on the onther side of
the board.  Eventually, I got "out of the box", and was up to 12 centers when
the board voted a 2-way R/T.  It was late on the first night, and I felt pretty
good about the round.  Solid performance, and while the game was really by no
means over, I decided that a 2-way would probably stand up in the final
accounting as a "good board".  There weren't many 2-way draws, and a lot of 3
and 4 ways.

In Round 2 I drew Germany, and was the victim of the dreaded Western Triple.
Yes, I meant that. In tournaments, the W3 rarely works out for Germany, but I
figured this was my round to be bold, and it wasn't impossible that it could
work!  So, I supported France through Munich, worked England into Stpete, and
was on the verge of Warsaw when England stabbed me for . . .  Belgium.  That
was it, a one center stab, but in the end, it forced France to choose between
me and England, and heck, he already had Munich!  However, I learned Virtue #2
of Being the Little Guy:

2)  Bold, Honorable Play pays off.

France and I were tight in this game, and if England hadn't stabbed (badly (no
I'm not bitter, I just hate to see a bad stab)) we almost certainly would have
had a 3 way.  Nonetheless, word got around the boards that I could be trusted,
and having only a 2 center (one center?  I forget) survival, this was clearly
the game to drop.

So to Round 3.  I draw England, and Vincent Mous, inventor of the Modern
Variant, is France.  A fellow named Steve Mauritas (sp?) is Germany, and I find
myself forced to decide on my strategy for the game in 1901.  On the one had,
Vincent, will make an excellent ally, his tactics will be sound, and in the
end, he can almost certainly outplay me given a chance.  On the Other Hand,
Steve is (As far as I could tell, I had met him at PrezCon previously)  a solid
player, without much feel for the endgame, who, as Germany, would almost
certainly have bigger problems than me!  I convince Steve to work with me for
Vincent's demise.  And So it goes.  A Relentless assault on our part, and
Italian intervention in Iberia, seal Vince's fate. Noone can fight three at a
time, but he holds on until 1904, when he goes from 4 centers to 0.  (ouch!)

And, just when things are looking pretty rosy for the E/G alliance, Russia
springs west, and captures Munich.  A long fight ensues, wherein the R/A/I
alliance scrambles to get to the Stalemate line.  And here I learned Virtues 3
and 4:

3)  Alliances pay off

Steve was brilliant as Germany.  At one point he had 5 centers, four units and
only one home center, With his other three behind our lines in France.  (I'm
pretty sure he had a fleet in portugal!)  As hard as R/A tried, they couldn't
break past him.  I held the North in an Iron Hand, but Italy, in the process of
taking down France, had gotten the West med locked up.  For 4 years I had to
wait and not stab Germany.  I mean, those four centers were mine, whenever I
wanted them -- but as England, I couldn't project the power onto the continent,
to take His position, and prevent R/A from getting past Switzerland.  4 years
went by, and at that point, John Quarto (austria) approached me.  He also had a
2-way draw in round one.  We both agreed that a 4 or 5 way draw was no good for
anyone.  I said "As soon as you stab Italy, I'll stab Germany", and I
encouraged Russia to look to Austrian centers for growth as I put
full-court-press on the Med.  Virtue #4?

4) Patience pays off

Sure enough, Austria Stabs Italy.  Russia Stabs Austria.  Italy abandons the
Med, and heads home to take down the Archduke.  My fleets scream into the Med,
getting to Tunis and threatening the Italin home centers.  Russia and Austria
spar at 7 cneters each for 2 years, exchanging something like 8 sc's in the
process.  And I get a little bigger each year.  Russia invites me into Warsaw
to help him against Austria, and at this point Steve, my erstwhile Ally says
"Y'know something Chris?  There are 18 Sc's behind our lines.  I wouldn't be
too upset if you stab me for the Solo. Just give me credit in the Diplomatic
Pouch. (Ok, he didn't say the part about the credit in th pouch, but it sounds
nice)  So I did, and a mis-written order takes me to 17 ( I wrote Pic instead
of Par), and the board votes me the solo so we can get some sleep!

In the End, a Solo and a 2-way were just barely enough to get me the win.  As
the Little Guy, the one who no one had really heard of, and who certainly
didn't appear capable of taking the whole shebang, I was, I think, a little
underestimated -- if only as someone not to "key onto".  Many of the Veterans,
Like Simon, Manus, and Edi, had such strong reputations going in that they
probably fared less well than if they had equal abilites and no rep.  My last
thought on the matter is one about tournaments, and something I learned while
competing in Ballroom Dancing:

Win the Tournament, not the Event.

If you focus too hard on getting the Solo win in every game at a tournament,
odds are against it happening.  Have fun, play boldly, with solid tactics and
reasnable diplomacy, was my formula, and It Worked for me!

See Ya in Belgium!

<P>The Silence was Deafening.

<P>"Yeah guys, tell me! See Tim, you haven't managed to
<BR>corrupt everybody yet. Their silence is selling you down
<BR>the river! So this was all your idea, huh?

<P>RM"

<P>Well, I thought, Surely Mike McMillie, My teamate and oft-times conqueror,
will set the record straight.&nbsp; He was there.&nbsp; He has an un-impeachable
record, and should the situation warrant it, he can try to convince Mr.
Peabody to use the Way-Back Machine to fix things so that his account is
accurate.&nbsp; Sure Enough, he comes to my rescue.

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Yes Roland, one of those really sad days in history.
Mark it on your</FONT>

still and Mr Martin was</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">pronounced King of the Diplomacy world."</FONT>

<P>So far, I thought, So Good.&nbsp; Smacko was really coming through for
me!

<P>(Smacko, or 'Soldier Minus Ability, Co-ordination, and Knowledge' is
Mr. McMillie's affectionate nickname.&nbsp; Seriously.&nbsp; He's got it
on his liscence plates.&nbsp; No joke!)

<P>But then comes the accounting.&nbsp; Note that, not only does he transpose
my first and third rounds . . . well, see for yourself!

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">"Chris pulled off one of those easy boards in
round one and wound up</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">having 6 people fight each other and let him
run amuk on the board.</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">Then rather than stand up like men and turn to
face the filthy swine,</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">they continued to ignore him until&nbsp; the

<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">allies, no need to really diplome, but as luck
would have it, they</FONT>

didn't have some fun</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">and actually make a tactical decision or two
(not to mentioned he did</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">have to stay up until 3 before they conceded

<P>Lies!&nbsp; Scurruoulous Lies!&nbsp; It was in Round Three!

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">"In his second round (the team event, where he
was to help Tim and</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">me), he was Germany and failed miserably, letting
down his teammates</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">(no I shall not say that he has any friends)
who both scored quite</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">well that round (overall the TOR team finished

<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">could have ordered something other than 'Berlin

<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">even his home centers we would have placed better."</FONT>

<P>Note the Petty comments.&nbsp; The Daggers are really starting to come
out now!

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">"Chris did well in the third round and scored
a two-way, again with</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">little opposition. This lead to his big decision.
The rules of the</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">road were your bottom score was dropped and the
remainder (2 or three</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">games) were then averaged to determine your final
score. The wimp</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">decided that his round two would be dropped and
rather than charge</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">forward like a man he slunk to the corner and
let his solo and 2-way</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">stand, thinking any other game would only hurt

<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">player would have gone all 4 rounds (I did) and
take his lumps as</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">best as possible."</FONT>

<P>Lies Again!&nbsp; It was the First Round!&nbsp; And can he let it stand
at that!&nbsp; N o o o o!&nbsp; The final blow came at the end, as I guess
is typical for final blows:

<P><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">"I just want to reitterate that in the 4th round,
I got to play</FONT>
<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">against John Quarto as I was higher up in the

<BR><FONT COLOR="#FF0000">I managed to stiff arm him enough that he could
only get a 3 way and</FONT>

first or</FONT>

;-)"</FONT>

<P>( In the first game I played on The Old Republic the Prince of Darkness
mistakenly represented me as female to certain other players in the game.&nbsp;
This has led, as one might imagine, to some . . . humor at my expense.&nbsp;
Most recently as the "Sultana of Swing")
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Sigh.&nbsp; All of this for a plaque (unengraved), a moment of applause,
some neat Babylon5 cards (if only I had someone to play against!) and a
most-expenses-paid trip to Belgium next year to defend the Title.&nbsp;
I ask you, is the Glory of Winning the World Diplomcay Championship worth
the backbiting, the second-guessing, the infighting that have been the
result of it?&nbsp; The "Target" that is now painted on my back wherever
I go?&nbsp; Can it possibly be worth the whispers, and the "yeah, I can
take him"'s and the young dip-slingers constantly seeking em out to challenge
the "Champ"?

<P>Well, yes, of course it is.&nbsp; What else would you expect after winning
a Diplomacy Tournament?
<BR>&nbsp;

<P>Be the Little Guy

<P>On the trip down to World DipCon8, excellently run by David Hood and
the Carolina Amature Diplomats (hooray!)&nbsp; There was much speculation
as to how one would be able to get to the final round.&nbsp; Surely anyone
who had a "Name" in the hobby, and there were a bunch of em there, believe
you me!, would be at a disadvantage, as well as anyone who did really well
in the first or second round.&nbsp; So it was my intention from the begining
to play a strong-but-unspectacular first game, take a few chances the second
game, and to play all-out the third and fourth rounds.

<P>This proved to be a pretty solid strategy.&nbsp; I pulled Turkey in
the opening game, and had Larry Peery as russia to the north.&nbsp; We
struck a deal that would let us fight our own fights, without doing a traditional
Steamroller.&nbsp; He went north and east, I fought for the Balkans.&nbsp;
And this brings me to the first Virtue of Being the Little Guy

<P>1) Paitience pays off.

<P>The big problem with Turkey without a strong Russian ally is that A/I
can slowly chew away at you.&nbsp; But, in my experience, something will
usually happen, around 1904 or so, that will cause one of them to falter,&nbsp;
If I am still alive and kicking then, I thought, I should be in good shape.&nbsp;
Especially since, to my good fortune, noone was coming out as a strong
winner on the onther side of the board.&nbsp; Eventually, I got "out of
the box", and was up to 12 centers when the board voted a 2-way R/T.&nbsp;
It was late on the first night, and I felt pretty good about the round.&nbsp;
Solid performance, and while the game was really by no means over, I decided
that a 2-way would probably stand up in the final accounting as a "good
board".&nbsp; There weren't many 2-way draws, and a lot of 3 and 4 ways.

<P>In Round 2 I drew Germany, and was the victim of the dreaded Western
Triple.&nbsp; Yes, I meant that. In tournaments, the W3 rarely works out
for Germany, but I figured this was my round to be bold, and it wasn't
impossible that it could work!&nbsp; So, I supported France through Munich,
worked England into Stpete, and was on the verge of Warsaw when England
stabbed me for . . .&nbsp; Belgium.&nbsp; That was it, a one center stab,
but in the end, it forced France to choose between me and England, and
heck, he already had Munich!&nbsp; However, I learned Virtue #2 of Being
the Little Guy:

<P>2)&nbsp; Bold, Honorable Play pays off.

<P>France and I were tight in this game, and if England hadn't stabbed
(badly (no I'm not bitter, I just hate to see a bad stab)) we almost certainly
would have had a 3 way.&nbsp; Nonetheless, word got around the boards that
I could be trusted, and having only a 2 center (one center?&nbsp; I forget)
survival, this was clearly the game to drop.

<P>So to Round 3.&nbsp; I draw England, and Vincent Mous, inventor of the
Modern Variant, is France.&nbsp; A fellow named Steve Mauritas (sp?) is
Germany, and I find myself forced to decide on my strategy for the game
in 1901.&nbsp; On the one had, Vincent, will make an excellent ally, his
tactics will be sound, and in the end, he can almost certainly outplay
me given a chance.&nbsp; On the Other Hand, Steve is (As far as I could
tell, I had met him at PrezCon previously)&nbsp; a solid player, without
much feel for the endgame, who, as Germany, would almost certainly have
bigger problems than me!&nbsp; I convince Steve to work with me for Vincent's
demise.&nbsp; And So it goes.&nbsp; A Relentless assault on our part, and
Italian intervention in Iberia, seal Vince's fate. Noone can fight three
at a time, but he holds on until 1904, when he goes from 4 centers to 0.&nbsp;
(ouch!)

<P>And, just when things are looking pretty rosy for the E/G alliance,
Russia springs west, and captures Munich.&nbsp; A long fight ensues, wherein
the R/A/I alliance scrambles to get to the Stalemate line.&nbsp; And here
I learned Virtues 3 and 4:

<P>3)&nbsp; Alliances pay off

<P>Steve was brilliant as Germany.&nbsp; At one point he had 5 centers,
four units and only one home center, With his other three behind our lines
in France.&nbsp; (I'm pretty sure he had a fleet in portugal!)&nbsp; As
hard as R/A tried, they couldn't break past him.&nbsp; I held the North
in an Iron Hand, but Italy, in the process of taking down France, had gotten
the West med locked up.&nbsp; For 4 years I had to wait and not stab Germany.&nbsp;
I mean, those four centers were mine, whenever I wanted them -- but as
England, I couldn't project the power onto the continent, to take His position,
and prevent R/A from getting past Switzerland.&nbsp; 4 years went by, and
at that point, John Quarto (austria) approached me.&nbsp; He also had a
2-way draw in round one.&nbsp; We both agreed that a 4 or 5 way draw was
no good for anyone.&nbsp; I said "As soon as you stab Italy, I'll stab
Germany", and I encouraged Russia to look to Austrian centers for growth
as I put full-court-press on the Med.&nbsp; Virtue #4?

<P>4) Patience pays off

<P>Sure enough, Austria Stabs Italy.&nbsp; Russia Stabs Austria.&nbsp;
Italy abandons the Med, and heads home to take down the Archduke.&nbsp;
My fleets scream into the Med, getting to Tunis and threatening the Italin
home centers.&nbsp; Russia and Austria spar at 7 cneters each for 2 years,
exchanging something like 8 sc's in the process.&nbsp; And I get a little
bigger each year.&nbsp; Russia invites me into Warsaw to help him against
Austria, and at this point Steve, my erstwhile Ally says "Y'know something
Chris?&nbsp; There are 18 Sc's behind our lines.&nbsp; I wouldn't be too
upset if you stab me for the Solo. Just give me credit in the Diplomatic
Pouch. (Ok, he didn't say the part about the credit in th pouch, but it
sounds nice)&nbsp; So I did, and a mis-written order takes me to 17 ( I
wrote Pic instead of Par), and the board votes me the solo so we can get
some sleep!

<P>In the End, a Solo and a 2-way were just barely enough to get me the
win.&nbsp; As the Little Guy, the one who no one had really heard of, and
who certainly didn't appear capable of taking the whole shebang, I was,
I think, a little underestimated -- if only as someone not to "key onto".&nbsp;
Many of the Veterans, Like Simon, Manus, and Edi, had such strong reputations
going in that they probably fared less well than if they had equal abilites
and no rep.&nbsp; My last thought on the matter is one about tournaments,
and something I learned while competing in Ballroom Dancing:

<P>Win the Tournament, not the Event.

<P>If you focus too hard on getting the Solo win in every game at a tournament,
odds are against it happening.&nbsp; Have fun, play boldly, with solid
tactics and reasnable diplomacy, was my formula, and It Worked for me!

<P>See Ya in Belgium!
