At World DipCon VIII, I played a type of game that I (and <i>most</i> of
the British and
European players) have never played: variable length tournament Diplomacy.

<p align=justify>
Diplomacy is a long game. Played properly, it can last twenty game-years or 
more, and playing face-to-face, a game-year usually takes around forty minutes. 
This makes for a game that is rather difficult to organise for a tournament. 
Tournament rounds usually only have six or seven hours of playing time available,
and so 
fitting in a full game is not possible. Speeding up the game is not an option, 
as even forty minutes per game year can feel rather rushed at times. And so the only 
other alternative is to limit the number of game years that can be played.
<p align=justify>
However, this causes problems. Because the end of the game is false, players 
play to maximise their position at the end of the available time, rather than 
playing as they would play in a full game. Last-turn stabs are common, with players breaking 
alliances that they would have needed to continue were they to survive to the
end of the full normal game,  simply 
to gain an extra centre or two at the false-end to which they are
playing.
Larger powers can even be allowed to reach a position from where, given more
time, they could force a win.
<p align=justify>

There have been attempts to solve this problem before. One idea was to score
the game based on the centre count a year or two before the year in which the 
players were told the game would end. However, once players caught onto what was 
happening, this stopped working. Also, there is the idea of selecting a random 
game-year in which to end the game from a list of possibilities, and announcing it to the
players only when they arrive at that game-year. However, this also causes 
problems, especially if a year towards the end of the available range is chosen, as
players can still play the last couple of turns strictly for centres,
with the panic that comes with knowing that the end of 
the game is near.

<p align=justify>
And so, I decided that what is needed is a system in which
the end of the game is more 
like the end of a real game. In order to do this, I determined there are two 
requirements that are not in any of the previous methods. Firstly, the
end of the game should 
not rely on any hidden information, such as the unannounced scoring method
or the randomly selected end-point. Anything along these lines is subject to
attempts by the 
players to outguess the system. Second, the point at which the game ends 
should be decided by events on the board, and not by a single fixed decision 
for all games in the tournament.

<p align=justify>
So I came up with the following plan. Like a full game, the game is played 
until either somebody wins, or until a draw is agreed by all survivors. The
change is in what is required for someone to win. In order to win,
you must simultaneously fulfill the following three conditions:

<b>
<ol>
<li>Have more centres than anybody else on the board
<li>Have more centres than you had the previous game-year
<li>Have at least the number of centres specified in the table below:<p>
</b>
<center>
<table border=1>
<tr><th align=right>Game-Year:
<th>1904<th>1905<th>1906<th>1907<th>1908<th>1909<th>1910<th>1911<th>1912<th>1913+
<tr><th align=right>Centres to Win:
<th>18<th>17<th>15<th>14<th>12<th>11<th>9<th>8<th>6<th>5
</table>
</center>
</ol>
<p align=justify>
The first of these three conditions is obvious. You cannot win unless you are
the single biggest power. The second condition is to force you to grow to
win -- you cannot just sit on a number of centres, and wait for the winning
condition to come down to your level.
<P align=justify>
The third condition is what makes it all work. As the game years go by, the
ease with which you can win becomes greater, and so the game should finish in 
reasonable time. Some games will finish by about 1907, and the vast majority 
should be over by 1911. As players approach the winning conditions, then,
like in a full game, it should become the objective of the other players to
stop worrying about their own success, and instead play to stop the leader
from getting any bigger.
If they do not manage this successfully, then they
will lose, and if they <i>do</i> manage to stop the leader,
then getting a draw vote accepted should not be too much of a problem.
Thus we see that the perceived disadvantages of a "fixed-end" (be it clock-time
or game-year) are avoided.
<P align=justify>
Of course, some tournament directors may want their game-rounds to run slightly
shorter or longer than that 
recommended above. In order to achieve this, the required centres table can be 
adjusted by adding or removing 18's at the beginning. So for instance, to make 
the game three years shorter, the following table would be used:
<P align=justify>

<center>
<table border=1>
<tr><th align=right>Game-Year:
<th>1903<th>1904<th>1905<th>1906<th>1907<th>1908<th>1909<th>1910+
<tr><th align=right>Centres to Win:
<th>15<th>14<th>12<th>11<th>9<th>8<th>6<th>5
</table>
</center>
<p align=justify>
Once all the games are over, the next job is to put all the players from all the 
games into a rank order, and decide on the tournament winner. For this, all game 
winners beat all draw participants, and all draw participants beat all losers 
and eliminated players.
<P align=justify>
Winners are subdivided by winning year, earlier beating later, and then by 
number of centres. Should there be any ties on both these criteria, they are 
then split by centre count in the previous years, working backwards until a 
difference is found. The player with the higher centre count at this point is 
the winner.
<P align=justify>
Participants in a draw are ranked by the number of people in the draw, and then 
subdivided by number of centres held.
<P align=justify>
Losses and eliminations are ordered by number of years played and the player's
number of centres at the end (if any).
<P align=justify>
Finally, there is one other problem issue in tournament scoring
that I do not address here: how to rank players in tournaments 
having more than one round. Simply ranking results is sufficient for one round, 
but when there are multiple rounds, then there must be some way to combine 
results to give each player an overall score. However, this
requires that some decisions be made and agreed to as far as what should beat
what. For instance, 
should a solo win and an elimination beat two three-way draws? This is a
separate problem in itself, and so no attempt is made to solve it here.
<P align=justify>
Comments on the above system are very welcome. Will it work better than the 
current systems? Will it solve the problems it sets out to solve? Will it make 
for a better game? I would appreciate some opinions on this.
