Manus,

A couple of things.

Firstly, the article I gave you at WDC, which is in need of a complete rewrite, 
but is based on what I believe is a good sound idea. If you would like to 
rewrite it, and credit the article as "by Manus Hand, based on an idea by David 
Norman", then that is fine by me. I do not think I could do much better if I 
rewrote it myself.

Secondly, have a new article. I think this one is usable as is. If you want me 
to send a version that has no line breaks, except between paragraphs, then let 
me know. Also let me know what you think of it.

David.

Scoring Draws.
--------------

At World Dip Con earlier this Month, I played a type of game which I have never 
played before - Tournament games, without a time limit. The way that these games 
went has lead me to seriously question the way that games are scored. In 
particular, in the rules, it says that "Players may terminate the game by mutual 
agreement before a winner is determined, in which case all the players who still 
have pieces on the board share equally in a draw". I now feel fairly strongly 
that the word "equally" should not be there.

To back this up, consider the Saturday and Sunday games I played in. In the 
Saturday game as England, I walked the Northern half of the board, seriously 
knocking down Germany and then France, before knocking them both out completely, 
while Turkey was having similar success in the South. In then end, I held the 
Northern 17 centres, and Turkey held the Southern 17, for a two-way draw.

In the Sunday game, I played Austria. Russia and Turkey tried the Juggernaut, 
and so Italy and I fought back as one, and the four of us slugged it out, with 
nobody making much progress, while France and Germany swept through England, and 
then France stabbed Turkey, and very quickley got to 14 centres, with a 
practical guarentee of making it to 17, and a good shot at a win. The four 
Southern powers plus the remains of Germany were forced to immediately stop all 
their fighting, and form a 5-way alliance to set a stalemate line across the map 
before France won. We made it, but only just, and with no way that any of the 
five powers in the alliance could be eliminated without giving the game to 
France, the game was declared a 6-way draw, with the centre count at 
17-6-4-3-2-2.

And so I look at those two games, and I think. In the Saturday game, Turkey and 
I got the equal third highest single game score of anybody in the entire 
tournament. Only Chris Martin and John Quarto-vT scored higher, with their solo 
wins. In the Sunday game, France got one of the lowest scores of anybody who 
didn't lose. There were no 7-way draws, and so only the people who were 
eliminated, and those who accepted draw votes which did not include them scored 
lower. And yet France's result and final position was one of the most impressive 
of the tournament. That just doesn't seem right to me.

So where do we go next ? The next obvious possibility is to score the games 
according to supply centre count. So Turkey and I in the Saturday game, and 
France in the Sunday game, would all score 17/34. The other powers in the Sunday 
game would score 6/34 down to 2/34 for their relative centre counts. I don't 
like this idea either, for two reasons. Firstly, this would encourage the people 
in the 5-way alliance in the Sunday game to fight amongst each other, to make 
themselves more powerful in the alliance, when what they should really be doing 
is defending against France. Secondly, I do not think Italy, who finished on 6 
really had done three times better than Russia, who finished on just 2. We all 
were in exactly the same position. We could either work together, and hold the 
line together, or we could throw the game to France. Nobody had any greater or 
lesser choice to do this than anybody else.

And so I propose a new system - one that reflects how the game ended. Instead of 
voting for a draw between a list of powers, you vote for a draw between a list 
of alliances. An alliance is defined as a group of one or more powers, who are 
capable of protecting themselves from invasion by any other alliance. So in the 
Saturday game, the two alliances would be "England" and "Turkey". In the Sunday 
game, the alliances would be "France", and 
"Germany+Italy+Austria+Russia+Turkey".

The next step, I am not sure about. Either, "each alliance shares equally in the 
draw", or "each alliance shares a fraction of the draw according to its supply 
centre count". I am a little undecided on this one. I expect considering some 
examples will help. Once each alliance has been given a score, then that score 
is divided equally amongst the members of the alliance. This divide should 
definately be equal. If it is not, then this method is no better than assigning 
scores according to supply centre count.

In most cases, the alliances are fairly obvious. There will be a stalemate line, 
and the powers one side will be one alliance, and the powers on the other side 
will be the other. However, there are some exceptions. I think the most obvious, 
is England on 14, Russia on 13, Italy on 7, where Italy holds something like 
Portugal, Spain, Marseille, Tunis, Naples, Rome, Venice. Italy quite clearly 
could not hold of England and Russia if they decided to both attack. However, he 
can hold his own diplomatically, by threatening that if either power attacks 
him, then he will throw the game to the other power. I therefore think that this 
is a situation where there are three alliances on the board.

Having said that, if alliances score according to the number of centres they 
hold, then Italy is actually worse off than if he was accepted into an alliance 
with one of the other two. If he is on his own, then he will score 7/34. 
However, if he is accepted into an alliance with Russia, then he will score half 
of 20/34, which is 10/34. I therefore think that this clearly means that the 
rule should be that "each alliance shares equally in the draw", giving Italy a 
score of 1/3 if he is by himself, or 1/4 if he allies with either of the other 
powers.
