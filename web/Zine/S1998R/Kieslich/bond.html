Hi Manus,

A story about Rudolph and Santa Claus should be in a Winter issue.
I you need something for the Fall issue, I have a little story ready for
you. I'm still working on a bigger one, but if this one is in the
taste of the readers and too easy I can have the other one ready in
time.

A CRYPTIC POSTCARD.

One rainy afternoon I went to my club, hoping for a game of Bridge or
even better Diplomacy. As none of the usual players was present I
settled for a Glenfiddich and a chair by the fire. As I sat down I heard
an angry voice from the other chair "....and they have no discipline."
I looked over and there was M sitting, apparently talking to his Brandy.
Before I could ask him what the problem was he decided to tell me.
"There has been some rumours about war next year. We know that all
great powers has sent out a spy from their capital to spy in another
capital, so we did too. But what are they worth, I ask? They have no
respect for military or naval traditions, and what takes an army or
fleet six month to investigate, they travel through in one day. How can
they gather information with that speed ? And I doubt they do. We wanted
our spy to tell us who was spying on who, and all he sends back is
this.". M handed me a postcard with a picture of some scouts and a 'Wish
you were here' on one side and what looks like a normal letter on the
other side.

"Dear Uncle,
We have much fun here at the scouts summer camp. Last week we had a
competition. We were all given a different task. We started Monday, and
the first two finished on Wednesday, two on Thursday, one Friday, one
Saturday and the last one Sunday. My russian friend and I finished the
same day.
Please send some money. See you soon. James."

"Both you and James play that game Diplomacy, so maybe you can see, if
there is a meaning to this, or if he is in his second childhood."
"Do you know how many days he travelled ?" I asked. M mumbled something
about a well used expence account and told me what I needed to know.
And before we had finished our drinks I told M what he wanted to know.

So one rainy afternoon, take a whiskey and read the postcard from James,
and you will also know who spied on who that summer in 1899.

Hi Manus,
 
> The judge does support disbanding on dislogement, of course.
> Each player just has to issue the "Army Wherever Disband" order.
Of course ! When I was making the game I was mostly thinking about the
next issue.
 
> As for build anywhere, this is supported as well, but I don't
> know what flag you have to set to make the game allow it.
The JK says there isn't such flag yet. He is working on it. I have asked
around and it looks like only DEAC has it.

How was my last story ? Too easy or acceptable. Can you rate it on a
scale from 1 to 5. 0=for children, 6=too difficult to amuse.
My next puzzle is at a crossroad. Is it ok that only 1/3 of the solution
depends on the map, or do you prefer 2/3 ?

Brian
