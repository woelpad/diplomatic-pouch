A number of people from The Diplomatic Pouch and its readership
were on hand at the joint
DipCon XXXI/World DipCon VIII, held at DixieCon in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.
Now you can experience the event vicariously
through their words.
</H4>
<ul>
<li>In <strong><em><a href=../../S1998R/Eddy/impressions.html>Impressions From DipCon</a></em></strong>, by Buz Eddy,
you can see what one of the most respected veterans has to say about the experience.
<li>To contrast with that, check out what a complete newbie took away from the
event.  For this, you need nothing more than Jon Mlinar's
<b><i><a href=../../S1998R/Mlinar/iloveit.html>I Love This Game</a></i></b> (the title kind of ruins
any suspense you might have had, doesn't it?)
<li>The inimitable Larry Peery has typed up his own take, with his
<b><i><a href=http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/7969/wdcviii.html>Who
Says You Can't Go Home Again?</a></i></b>  This musical article is located at
Larry's
personal Website (not here at The Pouch).
<li>Also on Larry's personal pages, you can find (and should
definitely check out) his
<b><i><a href=http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/7969/wdcviii.html>World
DipCon Shrine</a></i></b>!  There you can find out all you need to know about the
history of our World Championship Tournament.  See memorabilia and photos
from WDC's past!
<li>How about a few words from our new World Champion, Chris Martin?  Okay.
In <b><i><a href=../../S1998R/Martin/champ.html>Reflections on the Merits of Becoming World
Champion</a></i></b>, Chris forwards us a bunch of mail he has received since
his achievement, so that we can all suffer through his good fortune with him.
<li>Not enough from Mr. Martin?  Okay.  He also chimes in with
<b><i><a href=../../S1998R/Martin/little.html>Be The Little Guy</a></i></b>, telling us all
exactly how he went about becoming the World Champion.  It's now a
tried and tested formula, so it'll probably never work again.
<li>In <b><i><a href=../../S1998R/Willis/wdcstory.html>What I Learned at World DipCon</a></i></b>, David Willis relates...well, he relates what he learned at World
DipCon. (What did you expect?)
<li>Jamie McQuinn supplies his own recollections of Chapel Hill in his
<b><i><a href=../../S1998R/McQuinn/WDC.html>Notes From World DipCon 8</a></i></b>.  See what The Pouch's
Postal Section leader has to say about this latest annual gathering.
<li>Scott Morris, showing the stuff true Diplomacy players are made of, played while ill,
but had more than enough fun to write all about it in
<b><i><a href=../../S1998R/Morris/Fear.html>Fear and Loathing at World DipCon</a></i></b>.
<li>Simon Szykman provides <b><i><a href=../../S1998R/Szykman/WDC.html>Yet Another World
DipCon Report</a></i></b>.  Read how Simon, a multiple award winner (!), viewed the stabfest.
<li>Last but certainly not least, be sure to check out the
<strong><em><a href=photos.html>Photographs from the Convention</a></em></strong>,
where you can either see what you missed, or re-live the good time you had!
The photos were either contributed by David Norman (thanks, David!) or stolen
with a bald face from Larry Peery's article (thanks, Larry!)
</ul>
<P>
<b>What?  No WDC articles from Manus or Pitt?  Nope; not this issue.
But don't worry -- they're in the works!
