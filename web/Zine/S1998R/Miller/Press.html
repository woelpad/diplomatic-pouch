   Hello, ladies and gentlemen. Yup, it's me, back to annoy you some more
   about press.  In our first exciting issue, I shocked the Diplomacy community
   with my opinion that press is the most important part of any Diplomacy game
   (except, of course, no press games).  Think about it, how often does Austria
   use ESP to set up a Lepanto with Italy?  And so, without further ado,
   let's move into this issue's topic, plain ol' white-partial press.
  <p>
   White-partial press is a type of press that the vast majority of us use and,
   from a study of games on USIN and USEF, the most common type of press
   setting. For this article I am including WGP- with W-P- since how many people
   use the gray press in these games?  Data from the other judges show that the
   most common press settings are W-P- or WGP-.  From this we can see that most
   dippers are experienced and enjoy playing in W-P- games.
  <p>
   This only makes sense, because W-P- is most like face-to-face. You know who
   you are talking to and you can have a private conversation without other
   people knowing every last word you say.  With this in mind, one would think
   that the PBEM Dip community pretty much has W-P- down and I can move on to
   more <em>exciting</em> and <em>different</em> press variants like W---, -G--,
   or even WGPF.  <i>Bzzzttt;</i> wrong.
  <p>
   In many of the games I play my opponents seem to have some misconceptions
   about the use of W-P- press. Let's take a look at them now:
  <ol>
   <li>
    Press is only to be sent to powers bordering yourself.
   <li>
    Communication with adjacent powers with whom one is not allied is
	unnecessary
    after DMZs and neutrality agreements have been established.
   <li>
    Press should not be sent to enemies.
   <li>
    Cross-alliance press is unnecessary.
  </ol>
  <p>
   Let's look at each one of these in turn.
   
  <dl>
   <dt><h4>
    Misconception 1: Talk only to bordering powers
   </h4>
   <dd>
    One would be surprised at the number of games I have played in where the only
    press I received was from players adjacent to my own power.  Surprisingly,
    the first game I played in had a good amount of press between non-adjacent
    powers.  The only exception was Austria.  As France, despite my constant
    queries, I did not hear anything from him until the mid-game when I had
    stabbed his Italian ally.  In many of my later games, the situation was even
    worse, and I heard nothing from powers whose units were not
    intermingling/interacting with mine, despite my fervent attempts at
    communication.
    
   <p>
    This type of reticence is one of the worst mistakes a Diplomacy player can
    make.  Obviously, the majority of press should go to the players who are
    adjacent to and therefore affect your destiny the most.  However, a good
    Diplomacy player must think about the strategic situation, not just the
    tactical situation.  Strong mid-game alliances most often result in early
    communication by the two powers involved, even though they may not be
    directly of service to one another.  The reason for this is simple.
    Alliances require trust, and this is easily built in a non-confrontational
    sharing of information between two powers.  For example, suppose you are
    England, and ally with Germany to take out France and Russia.  Open
    communication with Austria and Italy will be valuable. This is because G/A/I
    often communicate, and with any luck England can pick up snippets of
    information about possible German stab etc.  England can also recruit allies
    from A/I when/if she wishes to stab her German partner.  Obviously, she also
    benefits in knowing if Russia will have an easy time of it by allying with
    Austria against Turkey.  Diplomacy with Turkey here is also valuable.  I
    could cite many other examples about why one should communicate as much as
    possible, and I hope my message is clear: <em>If you have partial press
    use it as much as possible! it will be to your advantage</em>!
    
	<dt>
   <h4>
    Misconception 2: Only talk to your bordering non-allies early on to
    establish DMZs and neutrality agreements
   </h4>
   <dd>
    This relates to my first point.  After DMZs have been established between two
    countries (G/R DMZing Sil and Pru for example) they should not turn their
    back on each other and sally forth in their respective spheres giving nary a
    thought to their supposedly pacified neighbor.  A usual example of this is
    France and Italy, who usually agree to DMZ Piedmont but then do nothing to
    communicate or to reaffirm that the DMZ exists.  Many times the first
    substantial communication between the two will be after the DMZ has been
    broken.  Another set of two countries who often fall into this trap are
    Austria and Germany, who communicate very little after establishing initial
    DMZs in Tyr, Boh, etc.
   <p>
    Clearly, press between countries who are not working together but only have
    DMZs separating them is useful and needed.  It keeps the integrity of the DMZ
    intact by broadcasting a clear "I am still talking and open for suggestions"
    attitude.  This often makes the other power feel more at ease than a wall of
    silence.  I know that this sounds like basic stuff to all the experienced
    dippers out there, but you would be surprised at how often simple little
    things like this are neglected in many of the games I play and GM.
    
<dt>   <h4>
    Misconception 3: Don't talk to your enemies
   </h4>
   <dd>
    Another fallacy that many newbies and even some more experienced a players
    bring to the game is that press sent to enemies is unnecessary.  I am not
    trying to say that you should talk to your enemies every turn, every year, or
    even at all!  I am merely saying that it is wise to talk to hostile powers
    <em>when it is in your advantage to do so</em>.
   <p>
    If you, dear reader, remember the example in my opening article where I was
    playing France, about equal in position to a German who had recently stabbed
    me.  The German used press to convince me his stab was a mistake.  He got me
    to put in some moves that he was able to exploit in a second stab that
    actually worsened my position and allowed him to take Paris.  Part of my
    mistake was on account of newbie gullibility (it was my first game and
    Germany had been my game long ally), but part of it was the use of press by
    the German player in a situation that many dip players do not use press.  Yet
    another example of when press to an enemy is useful is when two countries
    work together against a third, but do not quite eliminate the third before
    one of them stabs.  If the stabber is wise, he will sign a peace treaty with
    the power he had been attacking, so as to be able to concentrate his full
    forces on the power he has just stabbed.  Shifting alliances are an integral
    part of Diplomacy, and thus a truly good Dip player must be able to confront
    even his enemies in press.
    
   <dt><h4>
    Misconception 4: Don't talk to powers outside your alliances
   </h4>
   <dd>
    Another major misconception about press is that once you have allied with
    another power, press to powers in other (not necessarily hostile) alliances
    is unnecessary.  A common newbie mistake that I myself made is that in an
    alliance both powers should agree on what press to send out to powers not in
    the alliance.  This, to a large degree, is silly.  Remember that even in an
    alliance you are an autonomous power and you, not your ally, should conduct
    your foreign affairs. While it is necessary for allies to agree on the
    general scope of their foreign policy and to occasionally make an effort to
    send out press that conveys propaganda or flat out lies to the rest of the
    board, individual members of an alliance must maintain sovereignty over
    press.
   <p>
    There are many occasions where maintaining sovereignty in press comes in
    handy and even becomes a vital aspect of survival.  The most obvious example
    is the stab.  Press can be used to keep open lines of communication to
    neutral powers, who can keep an eye on your ally and alert you to stabs.
    Also, you can form plans with other coalitions to help you when you decide to
    stab your partner.  This follows my basic theory of maintaining contact with
    everyone to further your own diplomatic interests.
  </dl>

  <p>
   The misconceptions about press that I have enumerated upon above are common
   among many newbies just starting to play the great game of Diplomacy.  A
   careful study of press, based upon the theory that the more you talk the
   better off you are, will lead to much more success at the board.  The ideas I
   have spelled out in this article are nothing new, in fact some of the
   earliest articles in postal 'zines that I have read enumerate on the same
   basic principles.  Nonetheless, I find these principles being lost in the
   surfeit of articles explaining strategy and tactics with just a scanty
   mention of the vehicle needed to put these into action.
  <p>
   At this point, I would like to make a plea to the few readers I have left at
   this point.  Send me war stories about how <i>you</i> used press or some of the most
   blatant misconceptions about press that <i>you</i> have seen.  I would like to print
   some of these stories (with credit, of course) in my next article in this
   series. I hope that all these articles from the next one on will have a full
   and bouncy war stories section. Speaking of which, I have decided that W-P-
   press is so common and important that now having dispelled some of the common
   newbie misconceptions of it, I should spend another article discussing its
   more subtle uses, techniques, and traps, which should be of more interest to
   both newcomers and more experienced players.  So stay tuned for that in the
   next exciting installment of this wondrous series (I can hear the groans
   already).
  <p>
   Until then, happy Dipping!
