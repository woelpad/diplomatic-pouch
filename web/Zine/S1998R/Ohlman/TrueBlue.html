In its premiere issue, <b>The Diplomatic Pouch</b> Zine carried
<a href=/Zine/S1995M/Shoham/Academy.html>an article on two
particular Diplomacy
playing styles</a>, named <cite>Care Bear</cite> and <cite>Cut-Throat</cite>.  Care Bear sounds like
the strategy players typically (and na&iuml;vely) use in their first few games (how few
depends on their intelligence quotient).    I don't know that I have ever
played with anyone that used the <cite>Cut Throat</cite> strategy.  I propose to
introduce a third strategy called <em>True Blue</em>; a strategy which I feel is a
valid long term strategy (as opposed to the two others).
<p>
A little background is perhaps in order.  I am not some great diplomacy
"star" who ranks high in the standings.  As far as email diplomacy I have
helped out taking over a few losing positions, tried out a few weird
variants, and have shared in a recent three  way draw.  Before that I
played ftf regularly in high school and college.  I spend most of my time
working and taking care of my family, so I don't have all that much time to
play, but I do teach a class on the game at our home school support group.
A note on <em>scope</em> is also useful.  I do not intend for this strategy to be
guaranteed useful for any particular <em>variant</em> of Diplomacy, most
particularly the internet variant <em>gunboat</em>.  It is intended only for
<em>Standard</em> Diplomacy, either ftf or email.
<p>
"True Blue" implies <em>integrity</em> and <em>strength</em>, and that is exactly the
qualities that it rewards.  To use the True Blue strategy in diplomacy one
must live by the dual maxims "peace through strength" and "If I say it, I
mean it."
<p>
Note that this strategy says nothing at all about the nature of any
alliances that you form.  It does not imply that when you go to an alliance
it is "till death do us part."  An alliance is not a marriage; it is a
banding together of exclusive self-interests for a common goal.  Alliance
should be viewed, in the True Blue Strategy, as running the gamut from "Let
us agree on this one thing this turn" to "If we do not all hang together we
shall most assuredly all hang separately."  A player playing True Blue
should let the circumstances entirely dictate the nature of the alliance.
Nor does this strategy imply anything at all in the nature of trust level.
Being <em>trustworthy</em> does not imply being na&iumlve or <em>trusting</em>.   At every
turn a player must always ask himself, "How can my allies and my enemies destroy
me this turn?"  A True Blue will make all the necessary arrangements to
prevent any such attacks.
<p>
What True Blue does imply is that when one says something, one means it and
one does it.  Thus, a player must be <em>very</em> careful what he says.  He must also
be very careful what position he puts himself into in the alliance.
There can never be anyone else that is able to <em>speak for</em> you.  A True
Blue can only "stab" in the sense of "not doing what his ally (or for that
matter, his enemy) expected him to do," never in the sense of doing what
he expressly said he would not do.
<p>
So, given this enormous (as it must seem to most players) limitation, where
is the payoff?  How can someone win the game if he is deprived of the massive
stab that is part of victory?  My answer is "reputation."  The reputation
that one gets from acting in this way is worth <em>more</em> (in my opinion)
than the gains
one gets from "the big stab."  Let me give you a couple of examples:
Let us assume that there is a game going on including (but not limited to)
Vaughn (the True Blue player), Mike (an ordinary player), and... ummm...
we'll pull a name out of a hat and call the other player Dan (an expert in
misinformation and the big stab).  The game is, of course, a Standard
(non-gunboat game) and all of the players have played each other before.
Each respects the other and there is no particular binding friendship or
lasting emnity between any of them.
<p>
<ol>
<li>So the game begins.  Mike finds himself between, as it were, Vaughn and
Dan.  All three players start the game with  the standard posts to one
another about how wonderful it would be if they were working together with
each other.  After some negotiations both V and D propose to M alternate
plans, both of which could work very well, but both of which, obviously,
require Mike to "tip his hand" as far as which direction he is going.
<p>
<li>It is now mid-game.  Mike is receiving information from both Dan and
Vaughn.  Unfortunately for Mike, this information is not...ummm..
<em>identical</em>.  Not to put to fine a point on it...but it is actually
contradictory.  One of the people communicating with him is lying.
<p>
<li>It is now at a critical point in the latter game.  Both Vaughn and Dan
come to Mike with alternate proposals.  Both proposals look great on paper,
basically "putting away" the other players and leaving Mike and whoever he
joins up with to "duke it out."  However to make either plan work Mike
would have to do <em>exactly</em> what is planned, and this would leave him wide
open to the player he partners up with or a combination of the other two
players.
</ol>
<p>
So.  Given these examples, where is the <em>payoff</em> for the True Blue player
over and against the standard player ?  In each of the cases above, Mike
will be asking himself, "Who can I trust?"  In each case, if the True Blue
player has been true to his strategy, the obvious answer will be Vaughn.
Whether it is a question of a "false start" (getting an opponent to go out
on a limb right in the beginning of the game and thus destroying his
diplomatic options), a question of information, or those "make or break"
moves that come throughout the game, in each case the issue of <em>trust</em>
comes to the fore.  In each of these situations the True Blue player enters
with an advantage against someone with a "tainted" reputation.
