Notes From World DipCon 8

I wish I had taken notes during the event, because
some of the particulars are already a bit hazy in my mind.
But without question, World DipCon 8 was my best tournament
result ever.  I played three of the four rounds of Diplomacy
and shared, in this order, a five-way, a four-way and a
three-way draw.  Just the fact that I was never eliminated
would have made it my best result ever.  The worst part is
that I cannot remember what countries I played in each
game, and who I played with.
<p align=justify>
I do remember causing great disappointment to
Andy Marshal in my first game (I think I was France to his
England) when I voted for the five-way.  In retrospect, I really
had a decent shot at a solo or perhaps two-way, but I
chickened out.  I also recall, to my great suprise, that I
never performed a major stab on any long-term ally.  In
each game, I selected an ally and stuck with him until the
end.  That's not to say I never looked at the possibility.  I
always look at the options, its just that I never saw a stab as
in my best interests.
<p align=justify>
Overall, I placed nineteenth out of the seventyish
players, which I think is pretty darn good, and I'm very
proud of it.  However, the greatest pride came from my
reciept of the "Players Choice" award.  Apparently, David
Hood (the Tournament Master) informally polled many
participants and my name came up as the player they "most
enjoyed playing with."  To me this was a great honor.  It
kind of makes you wonder what is better, to defeat all of
your peers, or be recognized and appreciated by your peers.
I wouldn't have traded this one for first place in the
tournament... Hmmmm.  Okay, maybe I wouldn't trade it for
second place....  The award came with a beautiful wooden
plaque that had a laser engraved Diplomacy conference
map.  A double treat since, as many of you know, I love to
collect map memorabilia as well.
<p align=justify>
However, I cannot overlook the outstanding
performance of The Knobby Kneed Rubes.  During the
team round of the tournament, my team, made up of
Warren "Goz" Goesle, Scott "Henry Miller" Morris, and
Jamie "Jamie" McQuinn, came in third out of twenty or so
teams.  Pretty good work, guys!
<p align=justify>
Other highlights of the weekend included play
testing Steve Koehler's Migrane Dip variant.  See a recent
back issue of Diplomacy World for his perfectly symetrical
Dip board <i>[the variant will be featured in the next issue
of The Pouch Zine as well. --Ed.]</i>.
I think it has potential for more play, especially
if someone is able to code the Internet electronic judge for
it.  I do not think it would be possible to form a stalemate
line on this map.  On the other hand, it needs more play
testing to see if in fact anybody could actually win the game
either.
<p align=justify>
I had recently purchased a copy of Eurorails, and I
roped Scott Morris and Pete Rauch to play with David
Hood and me.  David beat us handily, and Scott, while
enjoying the game, decided it was not for him.  "I never got
to stab anybody...."
<p align=justify>
I also had an opportunity to start two games of
Settlers of Catan.  This widely popular game has intrigued
me for several years.  I'm so glad I finally got a chance to play
it.  It was quite fun.  I said I started two games, but we
never got a chance to finish them, something kept coming
up and interrupting.  So, it wasn't until this last weekend
with some local gamers that I was finally able to finish a
game.
<p align=justify>
At the Hobby meeting it was decided that the 1999
Dipcon would return to Origins in Columbus, Ohio, and
that the 2000 World Dip Con would be held at Avaloncon.
I volunteered to serve on the committtee for both events,
primarily as the Internet publicity co-ordinator.  So as soon
as either of those events has information to distribute, I will
put them on a Web page for The Pouch.
<p align=justify>
Unfortunately, my camera broke, and I lost all of my
pictures of the event.
<p align=justify>
So, what can I say?  It was a tremendous weekend. I
highly recommend it to anyone.  I hear DixieCon, the
annual event, is this good every year and again, David put on a well-run
event and I had a great time.  Especially, as I have said,
because I got an opportunity to meet many of you face-to-face.  See you at
the next one!
