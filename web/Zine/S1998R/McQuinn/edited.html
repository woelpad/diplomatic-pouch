  <h4>
   World Dip Con<br>
   Chapel Hill, NC<br>
   Memorial Day Weekend.
  </h4>
  <p>
   I wish I had taken notes during the event, because
   some of the particulars are already a bit hazy in my mind. 
   But without question, this event was my best tournament
   result ever.  I played three of the four rounds of Diplomacy
   and shared, in this order, a five-way, a four-way and a
   three-way draw.  Just the fact that I was never eliminated
   would have made it my best result ever.  The worst part is
   that I cannot remember what countries I played in each
   game, and who I played with.
   
  <p>
   I do remember causing great disappointment to
   Andy Marshal in my first game (I think I was France, to his
   England) when I voted for the 5-way.  In retrospect, I really
   had a decent shot at a solo or perhaps two way, but I
   chickened out.  I also recall, to my great suprise, that I
   never performed a major stab on any long-term ally.  In
   each game, I selected an ally and stuck with him till the
   end.  That's not to say I never looked at the possibility.  I
   always look at the options, its just that I never saw a stab as
   in my best interests.
   
  <p>
   Overall I placed nineteenth out of the seventyish
   players, which I think is pretty darn good, and I'm very
   proud of it.  Howeve, the greatest pride came from my
   reciept of the "Players Choice" award.  Apparently, David
   Hood (the Tournament Master) informally polled many
   participants and my name came up as the player they "most
   enjoyed playing with."  To me this was a great honor.  It
   kind of makes you wonder what is better, to defeat all of
   your peers, or be recognized and appreciated by your peers. 
   I wouldn't have traded this one for first place in the
   tournament.... Hmmmm.  OK maybe I wouldn't trade it for
   second place......  The award came with a beautiful wooden
   plaque that had a laser engraved Diplomacy conference
   map.  A double treat since, as many of you know, I love to
   collect map memorabilia as well.
   
  <p>
   However, I cannot overlook the outstanding
   performance of The Knobby Kneed Rubes.  During the
   team round of the tournament, my team, made up of
   Warren "Goz" Goesle, Scott "Henry Miller" Morris, and
   Jamie "Jamie" McQuinn, came in third out of twent or so
   teams.  Pretty good work guys!
   
  <p>
   Other highlights of the weekend included play
   testing Steve Koehler's Migrane Dip variant.  See a recent
   back issue of Diplomacy World for his perfectly symetrical
   Dip board.  I think it has potential for more play, especially
   if someone is able to code the Internet electronic judge for
   it.  I do not think it would be possible to form a stalemate
   line on this map.  On the other hand, it needs more play
   testing to see if in fact anybody could actually win the game
   either.
   
  <p>
   I had recently purchased a copy of Eurorails, and I
   roped Scott Morris and Pete Rauch to play with David
   Hood and me.  David beat us handily, and Scott, while
   enjoying the game, decided it was not for him.  "I never got
   to stab anybody..."
   
  <p>
   I also had an opportunity to start two games of
   Settlers of Catan.  This widely popular game has intringued
   me for several years.  I'm so glad I finally got a chance to play
   it.  It was quite fun.  I said I started two games, but we
   never got a chance to finish them, something kept coming
   up and interrupting.  So, it wasn't until this last weekend
   with some local gamers that I was finally able to finish a
   game.
   
  <p>
   At the Hobby meeting it was decided that the 1999
   Dipcon would return to Origins in Columbus, Ohio, and
   that the 2000 World Dip Con would be held at Avaloncon. 
   I volunteered to serve on the committtee for both events,
   primarily as the Internet publicity co-ordinator.  So as soon
   as either of those events has information to distribute, I will
   put them on a web page.
   
  <p>
   Unfortunately, my camera broke, and I lost all of my
   pictures of the event.  However, a couple others were taking
   pictures and they promised prints or scanned images, so
   hopefully I will be able to post them soon.  Watch The
   Diplomatic Pouch for more reports from WDC.
   
  <p>
   So, what can I say?  It was a tremendous weekend. I
   highly recommend it to anyone.  I hear DixieCon, the
   annual event is very good and again, David put on a well
   run event and I had a great time.  Especially, as I have said,
   I got an opportunity to meet many of you FTF.  See you at
   the next one!
