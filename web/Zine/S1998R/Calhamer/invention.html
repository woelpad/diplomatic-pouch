<p align=justify> As the War drew to a close in 1945,
I read an article on postwar planning in the magazine <i>Life</i>. This article
reviewed the history of the Congress of Vienna and the subsequent period
to 1914, arguing that a world containing several Great Powers all roughly
equal in strength would offer the best guarantee of peace, because, whenever
one or two of these powers acted aggressive, the remainder could unite against
them, causing them to back down by overwhelming threat before a war could
break out. Regardless of whether such a plan would have worked or could have been brought about in the real world as suggested, the condition of
multiple and flexible checks and balances obviously offered itself as a possible basis for a parlour strategic game of some depth and color.
<p align=justify>In the course of debating in high school, I then encountered
an argument against world government -- a hot topic of the late forties -- which was that governments now are checked both by internal and external
factors, but that a world government would have no external checks upon it, hence might be more likely to become tyrannical. Another debater and
I attempted a game simulating the grand alliance of European history of the Eighteenth Century; but as we used only two players and did not find
any way to simulate an independent third or fourth part, the effort ended
in failure.  <p align=justify>Meanwhile, several of us were playing Hearts,
a card game in which several players participate, each independent of all
the others. We observed that the game was best if all the other players played against the current leader. Thus the current lead would tend to change
hands, giving more players a chance to lead and a chance to be the leader
at the end of the predetermined number of hands. Competition was further
enhanced by ruling that if two players tied for the lead at the end, all
players shared equally in the tie. Thus all players who were hopelessly far behind still had incentive to try to bring about a tie between the leaders,
thus increasing the competition instead of detracting from it. I noticed
that players who did not understand all of this would tend to play for second
place, or simply to protect their own score, and would thus detract from
the competition, while usually also detracting from their own chances of
finishing first. It occurred to me that if negotiation were permitted, other
players whose chances were diminished by this suboptimal play would have
a chance to inform the suboptimal party and make out a case for more nearly
optimal play. If this effort failed, then they could say that their opportunities
were foreclosed, not merely by the aberrant play of another, but also by
their own failure to persuade, which would be an integral part of the contest.
<p align=justify> From chess I borrowed the number of spaces, about 80 as against 64 squares, and the number of pieces, 34 as against 32 chesspieces.
My pieces move only as chess Kings; but the King is about an average chessman
in mobility; thus the board is about equally saturated with force. Diplomacy
is thus much simpler than most war games in its small number of spaces. I think that the game should be as simple as possible, so long as the game
is indeterminate and reasonably rich in strategic choices.  <p align=justify>
In 1952, I studied nineteenth century European history at Harvard under Professor Sidney B. Fay, of the Harvard class of 1895(!), whose book, <u>Origins
of the World War</u>, detailed the specific diplomatic developments leading
to World War I. These consisted primarily of two-or three-party arrangements,
wholly or partly secret in nature, as well as similar contacts and projects
that did not mature into arrangements. The arrangements were frequently
almost as brief and pointed as those now made verbally during Diplomacy games.
At this time I also studied political geography under Professor Derwent Whittlesley. There I became reacquainted with the concept of geopolitics
devised by Sir Halford MacKinder about 1904, which I had already encountered
in an article, again in <i>Life</i>. The principle element of geopolitics seems
to be the consideration of the effect upon the international power struggle
of the particular geometric nature of the division of the surface of the
Earth, altogether specifically considered, into land and sea. Thus, Diplomacy
emerged as a game in which land power and sea power are almost equally significant;
whereas nearly all other war games are either land games primarily or sea
games primarily. The decision whether to raise an army or a fleet is one
of the most important decisions the player can make, and is one of the most
important indicators of the direction of future activity.  <p align=justify>
Diplomacy is perhaps the first or only war game on the continental scale,
in which entire campaigns are only elements of the whole. In designing the
tactics, reference was made to the Napoleonic principle, "unite to fight,
separate to live." Separation is achieved first of all by requiring that
there be only one piece in a space. Concentration is then arrived at by the use of "support" orders from different pieces that bear on the attacked
province. Pieces farther from the crucial point are less likely to affect
the struggle for it, but some of them may do so by cutting supports. The
use of supply centers causes further dispersion of forces and emphasizes
the economic nature of objectives. It also makes the game primarily one of manoeuvre rather than annihilation.  This aspect of the game is reminiscent
of the "indirect approach" of Liddell-Hart, though I had not read Liddell-Hart
at the time.   <p align=justify> Finally the problem of organizing a seven-person
game was not solved until I entered the study of law in 1953. Then I became
aware that players who failed to meet their responsibilities toward the game should be made to suffer light penalties, such as loss of a single move, so that they are encouraged to comply but are not usually wiped out
by minor lapses. The game should be designed so that it can charge right
on in spite of poorly written orders and the like. The notion that a person
may tell all the lies he wants and cross people up as he pleases, and so
on, which makes some players almost euphoric, and causes others to "shake
like a leaf," as one new player put it, came up almost incidentally, because
it was the most realistic in international affairs and also far and away
the most workable approach. To require players to adhere to alliances would
result in a chivvying kind of negotiation, followed by the incorporation
of the whole of contract law, as some erstwhile inventors of variants have
found out.  <p align=justify> The game was completed in 1954 and has undergone
relatively little change. The major changes have concerned adjusting the
map to make the countries more nearly equal and to give them a wider range
of strategic choices. Convoying was made simpler, and minor complications
eliminated. These revisions occurred during 1958 when a good group of game
players and Operations Research people played many games and offered many
suggestions for improvement. In 1959, I had 500 sets manufactured on my own
capital after major companies rejected the game. Manufacture of the game
was transferred to Games Research Incorporated in 1960. Sales have increased
in every single year since the game has been on the market. Postal Diplomacy
was begun in 1963 by Dr. John Boardman. The games are conducted through amateur magazines, of which a few dozen are always in existence. Annual conventions have been held in the United States for some years; conventions
have also been held in Belgium and Italy.
