I disagree with one aspect of the Lepanto:
A Rome -> Naples puts too much of the trust burden
on Austria.
<P>
A Rome -> Apulia is much more versatile.  It can protect
Venice if things go wrong, it can be convoyed to Greece
or Tunis, and it doesn't cover a center you may want to
build on.
<P>
The Lepanto is primarily anti-Turkey, and doesn't
necessarily involve hostility to Russia.  If Russia
suspects a Lepanto is being planned he has to consider
whether it is better to prop Turkey up or take the
opportunity of Turkey's weakness to go for Scandinavia.
<P>
The reason Lepanto is so anti-Turkey is that an Austrian
fleet in Greece and/or an Italian fleet in the Aegean is
possible at the end of Fall 1901.  If Austria and Italy
split Serbia and Greece, their combined three fleets can
force any Turkish defense in time.
