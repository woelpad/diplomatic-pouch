<i>Brian Kieslich:</i>
<A HREF="Kieslich/SpyVsSpy.html">A Cryptic Postcard</a></b><dd>
If Sherlock Holmes can solve Diplomacy mysteries, Brian figured other
professionals should be given the chance.  Sure enough, he didn't have to
look far to find that Diplomacy can also be used to unravel espionage
webs!

Brandon read the article on no-press openings in the last Zine issue and

<i>David Norman:</i>
<A HREF="Norman/VarLength.html">Variable Length Tournament Diplomacy</a></b><dd>
Face-To-Face games can last all day and all night, and this has led
to any number of artificial game termination conditions for tournament
play.  David thinks that none of these are perfect, and so he offers his
own idea.  And frankly, I think he's onto something here....

Are you a care-bear or a cut-throat player?  Vaughn thinks you don't necessarily
have to be one or the other.  He defines and promotes a middle ground that he
calls the "true blue" player.

It's the most contentious issue around these days.  Manus decided to provide
PBEM player ratings, and then ensued the debate over which rating system(s) to
use.  Here is the description of the chess-like system on which a consensus was
reached and which will soon (whatever that means) appear in the E-Mail section.

A while back, Simon thought a chat room would be a nice addition to The Pouch.
Turning to the hobbyist most associated with the word "chat," he approached
Larry Peery, who is ready to lay out for us his plans for a DP CR.  Help
Larry strike while the iron's hot and let's get a Pouch chat room up and
running.
