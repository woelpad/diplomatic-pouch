<H1 align=center>Other Thoughts on NoPress Opening Strategy</H1>
<H3 align=center><i>Rebutting M. J. Yatchman's,
<A HREF="/Zine/S1998M/Yatchman/nopress.html">"or Why is Italy Always Such
a Jerk?"</a></i></H3>
<H4 align=center>By Brandon Clarke</H4>
<HR>
Last issue, M. J. Yatchman shared his views on NoPress opening strategy.
I've read his article several times, and I feel it merits a rebuttal.
In his article
he said:
<UL>
<LI>
Where before I could cultivate a relationship and somewhat affect the course
of the game, now it is but merely random chance... will he attack or not?</LI>
<LI>
My main premise is that "Italy is always a major jerk!"</LI>
<LI>
Alliances in no-press are very hard to cultivate, much shorter lived, and
not nearly as tactically effective compared to press games. As such, I
think a solid strategic start is much more important. In a press game,
if you do have a working alliance you can often recover from an early stumble.
In no-press if you show any sign of weakness everyone will jump on you
like vultures! Thus, I think the focus of the opening should be on retaining
control of those few key strategic spaces surrounding your country.</LI>
</UL>
I feel these points in particular, at least first of all, need to be rebutted.
<P>Firstly, I believe you can control the course of a game quite substantially
in NoPress play, you just have to know how. Whether your opponents will
attack or not is not merely random chance at all. It depends on what you
do. Sure, there are some instances where you guess wrong at the start,
and never recover, but this is not just random chance. You can identify
the risks, it's just a matter of knowing when to play conservative and
when to go for it.
<P>Secondly, although many players who play Italy in NoPress are "major
jerks," it is oversimplifying it to say this is always the case. If you
don't put a lot of thought into how you approach Italy you can be left
wondering what else you could have done. Yatchman's <A HREF="/Zine/S1998M/Yatchman/nopress.html">comments
on Italy</A> may be due to a lack of depth of thought about
Italy's options. More on that later.
<P>My main premise in NoPress play is that, on a given front, the side
that is able to bring the most concentrated, co-ordinated force to bear,
will win out nine times out of ten. (The tenth time is usually when that side
just makes a dumb mistake....) Given this irrefutable fact of NoPress
play, I believe one should pick a target, and throw everything at it. Don't
try and expand in three separate directions at once. Hold on one front
with the minimum forces needed (preferably no forces are needed) and throw
everything at your target, and don't stop till the opposition is completely
crushed -- don't let up. Sometimes you can win on a front where you are
outnumbered, but this usually relies on you fighting two (or more) powers.
Here your advantage is that your forces are able to co-ordinate, and your
opposition need to guess. Don't bank on them not being able to do guess
correctly -- I've seen good NoPress players able to maintain an uncanny
understanding over a long period of time.
<P>Thirdly, yes, alliances are hard to cultivate in NoPress. There's an
element of luck involved sometimes, and sometimes no matter what you do
you can't forge even the most logical of alliances. Sometimes the country
you want to ally with is being played by someone who's decided to attack
you regardless. However, the assertion that alliances in NoPress play are
much shorter is, in my opinion, just plain wrong. Because they are so hard
to forge, once formed, alliances tend to last a very long time - more so
than in press play. Also if you're allied to Germany and attacking England,
it's nigh on impossible to communicate your wishes to make peace with France
and stab Germany without letting Germany in on the secret...which kind
of ruins the surprise of the stab doesn't it? So, allies tend to prefer
to stick together long term in NoPress play. A solid start is important,
but there is also something to be said for taking a flyer at the start,
and hoping that your enemies take the safe and sure start you think they
will...momentum is all important in NoPress (see my theorem for success
below). Yatchman did get it right when he spoke of the vulture effect
in NoPress. Stumble, or show any signs of weakness as England, and even
Turkey will be pushing through the ranks to get a piece of you.
<P>Okay, so what do <i>I</i> think about No Press Openings? Yatchman broke
his article into the West, the East, and Italy, and I initially intended
to do the same. However
the deadline for The Pouch Spring Retreats issue has snuck up on me, so
in order to get this in on time, I will handle England and Germany this
issue, and cover Yatchman's comments about the other five nations
in time for the Fall Movement Issue.
<dl>
<dt>
<B>England:</B>
<dd>
<P>Yatchman says, <I>"Norway is almost always a freebie in 1901, so
attempting anything else is fraught with unwarranted risk. Convoy the army
there -- its a no brainer....[and in summary for England] for Spring, 1901:
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F LON-ENG (a MUST move!)
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A LVP-EDI
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F EDI-NTH (or NWG)
</i>
<P>Now, while I admit convoying the army to Norway is often a good idea,
I don't feel it is a 'no brainer.' For one, if Russia opens with a northern
opening (A MOS-STP), Norway is not a guaranteed build, unless you use the second
fleet to support it in there. Yatchman went on to say in his commentary on
English
openings: <I>"The key strategic space for the opening is ENG -- the channel.
Let's get tactical: If France moves to the channel and I don't, I'm screwed!"
</I>and further, in his suggested openings: <I>F LON-ENG (a MUST move!).</I>
Well, if you're going to the channel, and Russia opens to the north, aren't
you then faced with an embarrassing conundrum? Norway is no longer a no-brainer,
as it's not guaranteed. Given this possible outcome, I say that <B>IF</B>
you take Yatchman's advice, and move to the channel, then F EDI-NWG is an
illogical move. It has to be F EDI - NTH to give you the option of convoying
to BEL with support from ENG if Norway is no longer such a no brainer.
<P>But <i>should</i> you move to the channel? My experience in NoPress games is
that it is easier for France to attack England successfully than vice versa.
As France, I never feel safe with England still at my back; too many things
can go wrong too quickly. I think it is fair to say that France goes after
England's back door reasonably often in NoPress. Given this, I say England
has two choices: go after France hard from the get go, or go for a blitzkrieg
opening into Scandinavia.
<P>If you take the former option, F LON-ENG, A LVP-WAL/YOR, F EDI-NTH is a
much stronger move than Yatchman's suggestion. If you go to Wales with
the army, you're committing yourself to using F ENG to convoy it to BEL/PIC/BRE
in the Fall, or holding in Wales. The convoy is a gamble, as you're by
no means guaranteed to have a fleet in ENG. As Yatchman pointed out, France
has a strong incentive to open to the Channel in NoPress. Because of this,
I think A LVP-YOR is a better idea. If you bounce in the channel, and Russia
didn't open to the north, you can still take Norway as a no-brainer.  If
you make it into the Channel, you
have France in the unenviable position of guessing F MAO-BRE, F MAO-POR/SPA,
or F MAO H (not such a bad idea actually). Personally, given French F MAO and
English F ENG after S1901M, I would always push for MAO as England.
<P>Now if this whole 'attack France' business has you screaming at your
'puter wondering what this lunatic from New Zealand is going on about,
your other option is Scandinavia. I say if you're going to Scandinavia,
go hard, go all guns blazing. Open F LON-NTH, F EDI-NWG, A LVP-EDI
(to give you choices as to which convoy route to take). If Russia came north,
play it safe and support your army into NWY. If you're feeling brave though,
try A EDI-NTH-NWY, F NTH C A EDI-NWY, F NWG-BAR,  and set
yourself up for a stronger 1902. The other alternative which is just as
devastating (if it works) is A EDI-NWG-NWY, F NWG C A EDI-NWY, F NTH-SKA,
or even F NTH-DEN if you want to fight Germany and Russia -- though
if I was France and I saw that, it would be like a big red flag for me
to walk into LVP.
<P>In summary? Don't pussyfoot around. NoPress games are won tactically,
not diplomatically. What counts is numbers of units concentrated on a front.
If you're going to the Channel, don't do it for passive reasons; go after
France's arse. IF you're gonna go tripping in Scandinavia, forget France,
hope they don't attack, and go hard in Scandinavia. It's easy to get bogged
down in Scandinavia, so make sure that doesn't happen, and hit it with everything
you've got in 1901, 1902, and 1903, <i>then</i> worry about the south.
<P>
<dt>
<B>Germany:</B>
<dd>
<P>Germany has more options at the start of the game than any other country
except Russia. There are ten SC's in range for 1901 (likewise for Russia).
Hence, I find <!the prophet> Yatchman's statement that there is <b>no</b>
substitute for
<P><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F KIE-DEN</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A BER-KIE</I>
<BR><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A MUN-BUR</I>
<P>simply unbelievable. Not that the set of moves is bad...they're pretty
solid. What I take issue with is the assertion that there are no substitutes.
<P>As discussed, alliances are harder to form in NoPress play. If you can
form an alliance with one of your neighbours before the other players do
so, you're well on your way to a solid powerful midgame position. As Germany,
more so than most other nations, a solid midgame position is crucial. Being
a central power you <b>will</b> get eaten up in the midgame if you don't hold
the initiative. There are too many hungry hounds nipping at you from all
sides for you to be able to defend against them all simultaneously. As
Yatchman noted, once you show any sign of weakness in NoPress the vultures swoop
<i>en masse</i>. You can't talk your way out of it, and numbers brought to bear
are the crucial thing in NoPress play.
<P>One of Germany's great assets in NoPress play is it is in a good position
to form an alliance with any of England, France, and Russia, <b>and</b> usually
has an unspoken non-agression pact with Austria too. Make the most of this,
and try to forge an alliance early.
<P>Since forging or solidifying an alliance is so important for Germany in
the opening, and since there are so many possible alliances he can forge,
I believe there are, therefore, other opening options -- options that Yatchman
did not recommend.
<P>One way to broker such an alliance early is to allow Russia to take
Sweden.  I'm not saying this is <i>the</i> way to go, but it IS an option. <B>If</B> you're
going to let him have Sweden, move F KIE-HOL in S1901M. This signals
to Russia that you want to be friends. You can then order A BER-KIE,
followed by A KIE-DEN, and A MUN-RUH, followed by A RUH-BEL, and
F HOL S A RUH-BEL. By doing so, you invite a friendly relationship with a
Russia who is dying for a friend early in NoPress play, and you make sure
of two builds (unless England orders F NTH-DEN in the Fall...which is not an
entirely bad idea if you're England in this situation).
The other advantage of
opening F KIE-HOL is that you almost ensure that BEL is yours, or at the least
that neither France or England have it.
<P>Another option is A MUN-TYR combined with A BER-KIE and, depending on how you want
to approach Russia, either F KIE-DEN or F KIE-HOL.
<P>As will be seen in my next article's discussion of Italy, A VEN-TYR
is not uncommon from the Italians in S1901M. A MUN-TYR takes away the
conundrum Germany faces with an Italian army in TYR at the start of F1901M.
If you get a bounce in TYR you're sitting snug and safe in MUN even if
France is in BUR. The trade off is that you have less influence in the Low
Countries.
If you don't get a bounce, and actually get into TYR, that's not all bad
either....
<P>The final opening that I will mention is F KIE-BAL, A BER-KIE,
A MUN-RUH (not to say that the multitude of others I have omitted
do not have merits; I was just trying to rebut Yatchman's
assertion that no alternatives exist).
This opening gives <b>you</b> two units on SWE in the fall, which gives
you some nice possibilities after S1901M.
<P>Germany has a multitude of options. In my opinion, a trap for beginners
is to try and exercise too many of these alternatives at once. Pick one
direction
and go hard at it. Concentration of forces in NoPress is often the critical
factor. Decide before the start which way you want to play Germany. Do
you want to blitz Scandinavia, invade France, or be a naval power and try
to eliminate England as soon as possible?

<P>In the next issue of The Pouch I will write on the comments Yatchman
made about the other five countries. That's a promise, Manus.... <i>[Music
to my ears.  And hey, it almost rhymes!! --Ed.]</i>
