The New Zealand Diplomacy Champs.</H1></CENTER>

<H4 align=CENTER>By Brandon Clarke</H4>
That's right! This year there's going to be a Diplomacy Tournament in New
Zealand. I've done a bit of digging, and as far as I know this could be
the first New Zealand Diplomacy Champs. That's what I'm referring to the
tournament as until I hear otherwise anyway. Ever since I got back from
<A HREF="http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/W1997A/Clarke/Don.html">The
Don Challenge Cup</A> in Australia last December I realised I had the bug
for tournament Diplomacy play. The problem is, there is no tournament Diplomacy
play to be had in New Zealand, and while traveling to Australia to play
is well worth it, I can only really afford it once a year. I figured getting
a New Zealand tournament going was a good idea.

<P>So, what's happened? Well to tell the truth, not a lot - yet. I've been
pretty involved in other things lately, but now I find myself with the
time and inclination to really get things organised. So what is the plan
you ask? When's it going to be? What is a Diplomacy Tournament all about?

<dl><dt><B>The Details:</B>
<dd>
<table>
<tr><td valign=top><B>Dates:</B>
	<td valign=top>August 22nd and 23rd.
<tr><td valign=top><B>Venue:</B>
	<td valign=top>The Claddagh Bar in Newmarket (Central Auckland), a fine
	Irish pub with great beers and a good kitchen.
<tr><td valign=top><B>Format:</B>
	<td valign=top>Three rounds over two days. Two rounds on the Saturday,
					and one on the Sunday. All three rounds to be counted.
<tr><td valign=top><B>Entry fee:</B>
	<td valign=top>NZ$20
<tr><td valign=top><B>Scoring:</B>
	<td valign=top>Always a contentious issue this. The system used will
be <A HREF="http://www.thingy.apana.org.au/~ozdip/sc-d98e.htm">Detour98e</A>,
maybe with some slight modifications.
<tr><td valign=top nowrap><B>Prizes for:</B>
	<td valign=top><!There will be prizes for the following:>
<sL>
<LI>Tournament winner</LI>
<LI>Best Austria, England, France, Germany, Italy, Russia, and Turkey</LI>
<LI>Best performance by an overseas player</LI>
<LI>Player's player award.</LI>
</sL>
</table>
<dt><B>Additional Ramblings:</B>
<dd>I am confident that I will get at least 21
players along from the interest expressed so far. That would be enough
for three boards. A few more and we'd be able to run four boards, perhaps
with some GM positions, however I will attempt to keep them to a minimum.
I have expressions of firm interest from three Australian Tournament players,
and nibbles from several more. All overseas players are welcome. As well
as the Aussies, I have contacts in Dunedin and I'm actively seeking a contact
in Wellington. I'm will be trying to organise a group of players to travel
from these centres, sharing travel expenses, etc.

<P>If you are interested in playing in the tournament, helping me organise
the tournament, or even just interested in Diplomacy in New Zealand,
<i><B>please</B></i>
contact me (see below). Even if you yourself are not keen on playing in
a Diplomacy tournament, I may find one or two of your friends or contacts
who either themselves, or someone they know, would like to come along.

<P>I would be especially interested in hearing from people who have a group
of Diplomacy playing friends, even if you don't play that regularly, 
wherever you are in New Zealand.

<P>You can contact me in any of the following ways:
