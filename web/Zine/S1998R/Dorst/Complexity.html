<p>A while ago I compiled the <a href=/DipPouch/Online/strategy.html>Improve
The Way You Play Diplomacy</a> Web page.
This page included a Dip Tip section of short, one sentence tidbits of advice.
I began with a bunch of my own tips, and gradually added tips from others as they were
submitted, until a substantial list of tips was formed. When I lost Internet access
early this year, the page was taken over by Thad Black, and the Dip Tips section was
lost. The page has since been integrated into The Pouch.
<p>
One of the
Dip Tips said something to the effect of: &quot;Complex logic is a
sign of good will.&quot; (I believe this was one of my own tips, but if I'm mistaken, for
heaven's sake, whoever submitted it should contact me and I'll give you your due credit.) </p>

<p>I've always felt somewhat insecure about giving advice.
For each solo victory, I've suffered three eliminations, but most games end in a
draw. By no means am I a Diplomacy master, and have no real right to be a
guru. Nevertheless, I wanted to voice my opinions. The Dip Tip list granted me
safety in numbers. I figured that however bad my advice is, if enough people
submitted, someone was bound to give a tip that was worse than mine. </p>

<p> Earlier this year I discovered <u>War, Peace, and Integrative
Complexity</u>. I was redeemed. Here was a study published in a reputable
journal, supporting at least one of my dips tips scientifically. After reading the
whole article, I was thrilled to discover how much of it was directly applicable to
Diplomacy. </p>

<p> The first important thing about the study, is that it is not merely
attempting to explain things after the fact, but rather it introduces a hypothesis which
may be used to predict a conflict before it happens. This is of obvious relevance to
Diplomacy players. &quot;Speeches from war years used in the study were all made in
the months previous to the outbreak of major hostilities. Thus, complexity scores of
these speeches are predictive of imminent war rather than being responses to concurrent
conflict.&quot; (pg. 434) </p>

<p> Secondly, it is important to make a distinction between conceptual
complexity, and integrative complexity. Conceptual complexity is a personality
variable, whereas integrative complexity concerns &quot;aspects of information processing,
which may change as the situation changes.&quot; (pg. 431) What this means for
Diplomacy players, is that it is the change in complexity which indicates a possible
future aggression. Low complexity by itself, is not a valid predictor, because
different players have different levels of conceptual complexity. This is an
important distinction pointing out the flaw in my dip tip, because it considers only the
level of complexity, not the change. Someone who always communicates at a moderately
low level of complexity, may be less dangerous than someone who drops from a high level of
complexity, to a moderate level of complexity. It is the change of complexity that
is important, so you may find it useful to save old messages for later analysis and
comparison. <br>
 <br>
 By now you are probably wondering, &quot;What the hell is 'integrative
complexity'?&quot; <a HREF="mailto:pseudfeld@cortex.psych.ubc.ca">Seudfeld</a> can
probably explain it best. &quot;The current study was based on the scoring of archival
materials for integrative complexity. This variable is derived from the
conceptual complexity dimension of personality...Information processing at the lower end
of the scale tends to be rigid, all-or-nothing, routinized, and based upon only a small
segment of the total information available. At the high end, information-processing
is flexible, combinatorial, probabilistic, and information-orientated. The level of
conceptual complexity of a particular individual is a function of three
components...&quot; 

<ul>
  <li>&quot;The first of these is discrimination, a term that refers to the individual's
    ability to identify difference among stimuli along a particular dimension. For
    example, the ability to distinguish between black and white would be a much lower level of
    discrimination than the ability to identify a large variety of shades of gray between the
    anchor points...&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;The second component, differentiation, is defined as the ability to perceive
    multidimensionality in a stimulus array. On the perceptual level, for example, an
    individual who can group stimuli on the basis of hue, saturation, and brightness is
    differentiating at a higher level than an individual who uses only hue as the basis for
    categorization...&quot;</li>
  <li>&quot;The third aspect, integration, refers to the way in which the differentiated
    aspects of the information array can be used in decision-making. Highly complex
    integration involve a relatively large number of interconnected schemata, which can be
    used in various combinations, modified or abandoned if that seems to be desirable, and
    which are subject to change as new information is sought and obtained. Thus, an
    artist may integrate the three dimensions of color perception quite flexibly, emphasizing
    different combinations of the three main continua to achieve the desired effect, and
    possibly combining them with other dimensions such as shape or size. In contrast, a
    designer of traffic signs whose important goal is salience might always strive for a
    combination that maximizes contrast with the background, thus using three dimensions
    in a relatively stereotyped way.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p> The graph below was photocopied from the article, and touched up
with some color, in order to improve clarity. Red dots indicate the integrative
complexity of <b>United Arab Republic</b> (combined data from Egypt and Syria), while
black solid lines indicate the complexity of speeches made by Israeli
representatives. Data was obtained by analysing various speeches made in the UN
General Assembly and Security Council. Dates of major conflict are emphasized in
Blue. </p>

<p><img SRC="complexity.gif" HEIGHT="389" WIDTH="651"> 

<ul>
  <li><b><font COLOR="#0000FF">1948</font> - &quot;The combined Arab attack on the newly
    established State of Israel.&quot;</b></li>
  <li><b><font COLOR="#0000FF">1956</font></b> <b>- &quot;The Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of
    the Suez Canal zone.&quot;</b></li>
  <li><b><font COLOR="#0000FF">1967</font> - &quot;The Six-Day War.&quot;</b></li>
  <li><b><font COLOR="#0000FF">1973</font></b> <b>- &quot;The October War.&quot;</b></li>
</ul>

<p> The change in complexity is quite noticeable, in the months prior to
war. In every case, the outbreak of war was preceded by a marked drop in levels of
integrative complexity. One notable exception occurred in 1956, involving a surprise
attack by Israel and allies against unexpecting Arabs. &quot;The strike against the Suez
Canal zone was not preceded by the usual levels of mutual preparation for war, no decrease
occurred in speeches made by delegates of the Arab countries. This would imply that
a unilateral sharp decrease may presage the initiation of hostilities by that
country.&quot; (pg. 438) </p>

<p> Interestingly, one will note from the graph, at the time the article
was written, Arab and Israeli speeches were declining in complexity. With the
advantage of hindsight, this provides an interesting test-case for the theory.
&quot;The low level of complexity characteristic of Israeli and Arab speeches during 1976
may indicate the escalation of the Lebanese civil war or may be a predictor of a major
outbreak of hostilities in the near future.&quot; (pg. 427) Personally, I'm
convinced, but judge for yourself:
<blockquote>
 &quot;...In the summer of 1975 all-out civil war broke out between the
Muslim coalition allied with Palestinian groups and the
 Christian-dominated militias. 
 In April 1976, an uneasy cease-fire was
forced upon the two sides when Syrian military forces intervened at the
 request of the Lebanese president, Suleiman Franjieh and with the
approval of the Arab League of States.
 Nevertheless, sporadic violence continued, and in 1978 Israel
invaded southern Lebanon in an attempt to eliminate
 Palestinian bases.&quot; - <a
HREF="http://www.arab.net/lebanon/history/ln_moderntimes.html">Arab Net</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p> As I say, I'm convinced. The complexity peak in 1974,
followed by a drop in complexity, most likely predicted the 1975 civil war since Israel,
in the interest of crushing Palestinian terrorism, provided support to the Christian
Lebanese. This was only the first step in an escalation of conflict, that would
continue to escalate while complexity declined, eventually culminating in the 1978
invasion of Lebanon. </p>

<p> While this method successfully predicted an escalation in hostility,
a more sophisticated analysis would be needed to predict the nature of this
escalation. It seems that integrative complexity is an accurate indicator of an
imminent conflict, but used alone, may be unable to precisely locate the countries in
which the impending battle will take place. Keep this in mind while playing
Diplomacy. Decreasing complexity is an indicator of increased hostility, but for
greatest precision this technique should be combined with other techniques, and your own
intuition. </p>

<p><b>Conclusions</b> 

<ul>
  <li>Changes in the integrative complexity of other players indicates an imminent escalation
    in hostilities.</li>
  <li>Efforts should be made, &quot;to maintain a high level of differentiation and
    integration even during periods of crisis.&quot; (pg. 440)</li>
  <li>&quot;Be aware that in such periods the officials of other countries may in fact be
    processing information at a lower level of integrative complexity than normal- a
    possibility that could affect the strategy of those countries.&quot; (pg. 440)</li>
  <li>In a related study, &quot;the integrative complexity of the communications of major
    decision-makers [was found to be] significantly lower during crises that eventually
    culminate in war than during crises that are resolved peacefully.&quot; (pg. 431)
    Therefore, if you seek peace, try to increase the level of complexity of
    discussion. Ultimatum type yes/no, black/white discussions are less complex,
    and are therefore more likely to culminate in war.</li>
