Solution to The Great Disarmament Conundrum
<HR>
</H2>
<! ------------------------------------------------------------- >
<p align=justify>
Holmes and I had settled in for the evening at Baker Street, with
<a href=../../S1998M/Holmes/disarm.html>The Great Disarmament Conundrum</a>
sitting, apparently solved, on the Diplomacy table, when
a card was sent to our rooms, announcing the arrival
of  Colonel Sebastian Moran.  Holmes became immediately agitated, and
as we heard the tread of the  Colonel's feet on the stair, Holmes
indicated that I should take a seat by the fire adjacent to the poker,
while he rapidly placed a German army on the Diplomacy board.
<p align=justify>
Without exchanging greetings, Moran stated that he had come from General
Roylance to check on our progress in the case.  I was about to explain
that the problem was solved, when Holmes indicated the
board and stated that he was having insuperable difficulties and was
convinced that the problem was impossible.  To my surprise, Moran looked
momentarily relieved at this piece of information, then his habitual scowl
returned to his face and he quickly left, stating only that the leading
army strategists had come to the same conclusion and, regrettably, the treaty
would have to be abandoned.
<P align=justify>
I was most disappointed that Holmes should have misled me into thinking
that he had solved the problem, when in fact he had merely failed, for
I need hardly remind the reader that a few months later the Pan-European
disarmament treaty was signed, when the architect of the triumph, the
Austrian strategist Admiral von Graz revealed his plan for disarmament.
<P align=justify>
I took a trip into Whitehall to see von Graz as he revealed his plan
to the Prime Minister, and was startled to observe that he was the same
man I had passed on the stair at Baker Street only weeks before.
<P align=justify>
I brought back with me the von Graz plan, which I include here.
<blockquote>
<h3 align=center><i>The von Graz Disarmament Plan</i></h3>
<i>
<P align=justify>
Obviously, each country is reduced to a fleet and an army after 1901.  The two
possibilities are that they are forced to retreat, and choose to disband, or
they end 1901 with only two supply centers.
<P align=justify>
England and Turkey are the best defended nations, and while the Turks could
have an army dislodged from Armenia or the English a fleet from North Sea,
this provides further difficulties.  I therefore propose that Italy, Germany,
Turkey and
England be reduced to two  centers while Russia, France, and Austria
suffer dislogements.
<P align=justify>
The single French fleet can account for the  English supply centre loss, by
sailing through the English Channel to a vacated London.
The French Marseilles army can be destroyed by the Italians in
Piedmont, the Paris army would march to Munich, and the Trieste fleet
would capture Venice.  The
Italian fleet would spend 1901 sailing east in preparation for causing
destruction in Smyrna in 1902, while Russia's northern fleet
moves west in
preparation for taking a German port in 1902.
<P align=justify>
The Russian fleet from Sevastopol can be destroyed in Armenia by the
two Turkish armies,
and the Warsaw army can fall to the Germans in Prussia.  The
Austrian army from Budapest
makes its way to Constantinople by way of Rumania and a Black Sea convoy,
and this leaves the Vienna army to be dislodged by the forces from Munich
and Moscow.
<P align=justify>
In 1902, all remaining armies must be destroyed.  The Italian fleet will by
this time be off the Turkish coast to assist in the successive dislodgement of
the Turkish and Austrian armies.  The French and Austrian fleets
continue to sail around the English and Italian coasts, respectively,
reducing those nations each to a single supply center.  In Fall of 1902,
the Russian army is dislodged by the Italians and the Germans
while the Russian fleet enters
Berlin with German support, thus simultaneously
reducing Germany to one center and destroying the
French army there.
<P align=justify>
Given the reluctance of the British military to proceed with a policy
which would massively diminish their own importance, it is fortunate
that English forces are not required to leave the island.  In fact, under
the plan I have proposed, the English nation need only move one unit,
and only one time.
At the conclusion of the disarmament, the English unit will be left
in a province adjacent to all English home centres, to handle any
defensive concerns that may arise.
I feel that these aspects of the plan should reassure the British Empire
that little is required of it for the implementation of the treaty, and
I therefore hope to obtain the support for this plan from Great Britain.
I have spoken with the ambassadors of the other Great Powers, and each is
pleased to announce their nations' acceptance of my plans.

Having listened to von Graz's address, I returned to Baker Street
with the copy reproduced above.  As it happened, Holmes was out and I
had time to set up the Diplomacy board to check von Graz's solution
(for though I believe I had followed his explanation, mine is not a
military mind such as those of the other attendees at Whitehall).
Not surprisingly, the Austrian's plan implemented the treaty perfectly,
as is evidenced from the maps I include below:

When Holmes returned, I showed him the board as it now stood, with but
the seven fleets on it, and said, "How galling it
must be, for you, Holmes, to have been upstaged by the very man with whom
you were working in the early stages of the problem!  I can understand
why you chose not to attend von Graz's announcement to-day."
<p align=justify>
Holmes just smiled, then took my copy of the von Graz plan
and read it over quickly.  When he was finished, he turned to me.
"Ah, Watson!  I thought I had trained you
in the art of observation a bit better than that.  However, I cannot
help but be happy that the charade has fooled even you."
<p align=justify>
I was quite confused by his response, and I told him so, whereupon
Holmes continued, "You are aware, of course, Watson, of the rather
public stand the English military establishment has made against
the very notion of a disarmament treaty.  In fact, this is even mentioned
by my friend, von Graz, in his announcement.
<p align=justify>
"I had, in fact, solved the disarmament problem, but it simply would not
do to have admitted this fact to Colonel Moran.  The Colonel is but the
visible henchman of the hidden hand of Moriarty, and it would not be wise to
call attention to my successes to a man with his connections in both the
underworld and the military.  Rather, I decided to vouchsafe the disarmament
plan with Admiral von Graz."
<p align=justify>
With that, Holmes chuckled and turned for his apartment, leaving me to
sit in amazement once more of the subtle and complex mind of my friend.
