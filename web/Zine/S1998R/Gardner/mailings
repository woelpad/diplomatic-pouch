Hi Manus,

I read your plea for articles. There's a couple of ideas I've been toying with.

1) I play with a gaming group of about 7 h.s. students and one mastermind
adult. (Yes, we have to bump someone for each game [never me -- for which I
am thankful]) The fact that most are High School students is not the purpose
of the article (although thats another interesting topic.) These friends of
mine have NEVER read an article on Diplomacy, never heard of the Lepanto or
Sealion, shun "setup" strategies like those. I'm interested a lot in these
games because everything comes straight out of the mind. Anyway, I'm
thinking to collect ALL the orders from this game we're about to play and
have them write analysisses (or would that be analyses) on some of the moves
they made. I swear, it gets strange (we're talking English/Turkish wars in
the fourth turn here.) Also, the mastermind adult that everyone wants to
ally with is another important factor.

2) I'm intrigued how inevetible World War I is based on what I've seen in
Dip. I'd like to write an article giving actual history of the Dip-time,
talk about balances of power and stuff, and relate them to a dip game. I
think it's odd how it often erupts into a total-board war just because
Russia and Turkey begin nibbling at each other's SCs.

3) I'd like to write a Colonial Dip strategy as there are heavy shortages of
these..

Let me know if any of these ideas are needed/wanted for articles. If not,
let me know and I'll try to come up with something else.

Thanks,
Heath Gardner

Manus,

I just got back from playing that game I was going to write an article about
-- you know, the one where people don't use strategies set in stone by
others? It's really really interesting - I saved all the orders and got each
player to write out their basic plans and aspirations each turn -- that was
REALLY interesting to read (especially people that were going to stab me!) I
played England. We only had 6 people so we put Italy in CD and played for 4
hours which got us to S1906. The final SC Count -

Turkey -11
England - 8
Austria - 8
France - 7
Russia - 0
Germany - 0

If the game had continued further, it would have been a Turkish/English
draw, probably, because I was killing France, my ally who (unsuccesfully)
stabbed me, and Turkey was really cutting down on his former ally, Austria.
Russia and Germany obviously got killed pretty quickly.

Anyway, I thought (and think) It would make for an interesting article.
Still interested?

Heath

Too true. I looked for you but didn't see you until the very end, at the
award ceremony, and I had to leave at the very last second. 

Congrats on your placement!! 

I had an idea to write an article about my experience there. Let me know if
you need it (some interesting stuff happened. Like, my Austria and Ron
Fisher's Italy took out Per Westling's turkey in *03*. My best
accomplisment ever!) Of course, I did get my ass kicked after that, by
Germany. But who's counting?
