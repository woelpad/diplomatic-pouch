BLACK AND GREEN IN DIPLOMACY
Remembering Casaroli and Green
=
By Larry Peery
=
INTRODUCTION
When I say Black to a Dipper, he assumes I mean Germany.  When I say=
Green, he assumes I
mean Italy.  Well, not always. =
A few weeks ago within a 72 hour period the world marked the passing=
of two remarkable
individuals whose combined careers as professional diplomats totaled near=
ly 90 years.  "The
Black" was Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, the man who led the Vatican to det=
ente. "The Green" was
Marshall Green, the man who was the U.S. State Department's leading exper=
t on East Asia.   If
there were ever professional diplomats who could serve as role models for=
Diplomacy players;
these two would be them.  I find no evidence that the two ever met each o=
ther, although I was
fortunate to have met both of them once.  The world's media was filled wi=
th obituaries for
Casaroli: AP, Reuters, the BBC, The New York Times and the rest.  He was,=
after all, a major
player on the international scene for many years.  I only saw one obituar=
y for Ambassador Green,
but The New York Times gave him the same pride of space, headlines, photo=
graph, and amount
of space as it did the Cardinal; only one day later.  =
As I read over their biographies I couldn't help but notice the simi=
larities and differences in the
lives and careers of these two men.  What I am going to do is give you so=
me perspective on their
individual careers, then do a parallel chronological listing of the highl=
ights of their lives, and finally
close with my own, brief, remembrances.  I hope you'll learn something ab=
out them, our times,
and what a real live diplomat's life is all about. =
=
AGOSTINO CARDINAL CASAROLI
PHOTOGRAPH
=
Agostino Cardinal Casaroli, second-in-command to Pope John Paul II d=
uring the most active
and turbulent times of his papacy and the architect of reconciliation wit=
h the Communist world,
died today in Rome.  He was 83.
The cause of death was an infection after minor surgery, according t=
o the Italian news agency
ANSA.
The high point of Cardinal Casaroli's career came in 1989, a year be=
fore his retirement, when
he helped arrange the historic meeting between the Soviet leader Mikhail =
S. Gorbachev and Pope
John Paul II at the Vatican.
Today, in a condolence message, the Pope described the Cardinal as "=
an impassioned weaver
of peaceful relations between individuals and nations, carrying out coura=
geous and meaningful
steps with fine diplomatic sensitivity --- in particular to improve the s=
ituation of the church in
Eastern Europe."
Even before he was appointed Secretary of State in April 1979, Cardi=
nal Casaroli's efforts to
restore diplomatic ties with the Soviet bloc had earned him the sobriquet=
"the Pope's Henry
Kissinger."  In the 1960's and 70's he was the principal architect of the=
Vatican's policy of cautious
reconciliation with Communist governments, which began under Pope John XX=
III and which
sought to improve conditions for the Catholic clergy behind the Iron Curt=
ain.
In 1971, as an archbishop, he was the first Vatican official to visi=
t the Soviet Union since 1924.
Three years later he was the first to visit Cuba under Fidel Castro.
Even earlier, he had brokered an easing of relations between the chu=
rch and state in Poland.
After one visit there in 1967, the Polish Government agreed to allow the =
elevation of Karol
Wojtyla, Archbishop of Cracow, to Cardinal.  Karol Wojtyla later became P=
ope John Paul II.
Seven months after the Pope was elected, he appointed Cardinal Casar=
oli Secretary of State, a
position equivalent to prime minister.
The election of a Polish pope was fraught with potential difficultie=
s, including a worsening of
Polish-Russian and Catholic-Orthodox relations.  The Pope calculated that=
Cardinal Casaroli's
experience in the diplomacy of detente could ease those tensions, and soo=
n after his appointment,
Cardinal Casaroli met with the Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei A. Gromyko.=
The Cardinal was on his way to New York to receive an honorary docto=
rate from St. John's
University when the Pope was shot in 1981.  Two hours after his plane lan=
ded, Cardinal Casaroli
boarded a return flight to Rome, telling reporters, "My duty is to be wit=
h the Holy Father." He ran
the Vatican while the Pope recuperated.
In the beginning of their relationship, the Pope, a fierce anti-Comm=
unist did not always agree
with his more cautious deputy, preferring a more uncompromising stance.  =
But those differences
were soon smoothed out and the two men worked closely to help sustain the=
driving force,
especially in Poland, behind the democratic changes that swept one Easter=
n-bloc country after
another in the late 1980's.
=
AMBASSADOR MARSHALL GREEN
PHOTOGRAPH
=
Marshall Green, who was the State Department's leading expert on Eas=
t Asia and served as
Ambassador to Indonesia during the violent uprising in the 1960's that br=
ought President Suharto
to power, died on Saturday.  He was 82 and lived in Washington.
His family said he suffered a heart attack while playing golf with o=
ne of his sons.
At the side of a succession of Presidents and Secretaries of State, =
Mr. Green helped steer
foreign policy in East Asia as the United States deepened its involvement=
there in the decades after
World War II.
He was a witness to history from the earliest days of his career, wh=
ich began with his
appointment in 1939 as the private secretary to the United States Ambassa=
dor to Tokyo.  He left
the Embassy only a few months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor =
in December 1941.
In 1961 he was the senior American diplomat in South Korea during a =
coup that toppled a
democratically elected Government.  Four years later he was Ambassador to=
Indonesia during the
overthrow of President Sukarno and his replacement by President Suharto. =
In 1969 he was named
a member of the United States delegation to talks in Paris to end the Vie=
tnam War.
In the 1970's he was a key aide to Secretary of State Henry Kissinge=
r and accompanied
President Richard Nixon on his historic 1972 visit to China.  After the C=
hina trip, Nixon sent Mr.
Green to several Asian nations to calm their fears about the new relation=
ship with Beijing.
"History is likely to regard the period from 1940 to about 1970 as t=
he golden age of the
American Foreign Service," said William P. Bundy, who preceded Mr. Green =
as Assistant
Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs and later edited Fo=
reign Affairs magazine.
"No career officer exemplifies that period and its ethos better than Mars=
hall Green."
=
PARALLEL CHRONOLOGY
=
24 November 1914 - Agostino Casaroli was born in Castel San Giovanni, in =
Piacenza, in northern
Italy.  The son of a tailor, he had an uncle who was a bishop and another=
who was a rector of a
seminary, and be began studying for the priesthood at 16. He was ordained=
in 1937 and entered
the Pontifical Ecclesiastical Academy in Rome the same year.
=
27 January 1916 - Marshall Green was born in Holyoke, Mass., and graduate=
d from Yale in 1939.
His introduction to Asia came later that year, with his appointment as se=
cretary to Ambassador
Joseph Clark Grew in Japan.
=
1940 - Affable and courtly but reserved, Father Casaroli joined the offic=
e of the Secretary of State
as an archivist in 1940, during the reign of Pope Pius XII.  He taught pr=
otocol and "diplomatic
style" at the Pontifical Academy from 1956 to 1961, the year he was recru=
ited by Pope John
XXIII to serve as an undersecretary in the Department of Extraordinary Af=
fairs, where he dealt
with Latin America.
=
1941 - Shortly before the attack on Pearl Harbor, Mr. Green returned to t=
he United States to
prepare to take the examination for the Foreign Service.  With the start =
of the war in the Pacific,
he joined the Navy as a Japanese-language translator.  He had learned to =
speak Japanese during his
years in Tokyo. After his discharge from the Navy in 1945, he joined the =
Foreign Service and
received his first assignment --- third secretary in Wellington, New Zeal=
and, for two years. =
Mr. Green was admired by his State Department colleagues for his per=
suasive speaking style,
his almost preternatural calm and his quick wit.  =
He endeared himself to many diplomats --- although not to Mr. Kissin=
ger --- when he let slip in
a speech that the former Secretary of State was a "self-made man who wors=
hiped his creator."
His cool head served him well as he managed the American response to=
diplomatic and military
crises in East Asia, beginning in 1958 with the Chinese Communists shelli=
ng of Quemoy and
Matsu, two offshore islands held by the Nationalists on Taiwan.  The clas=
h brought the United
States and China to the brink of war.
Mr. Bundy later said that Mr. Green, who was the State Department's =
chief working-level
officer on the issue, "argued at the moment of greatest apparent crisis t=
hat China was in fact easing
off, and that a policy of quiet firmness would win out and bring the thre=
at to an end without
outright war.  He was right."
=
1961 - It was as a prot=82g=82 of the next Pontiff, Pope Paul VI, who was=
elected in 1963, that Father
Casaroli's policy of closer ties began paying off in Eastern Europe.  He =
made frequent fact-finding
trips to Soviet-controlled countries, often traveling incognito in civili=
an clothes.  In 1964 he signed
a partial accord between the Vatican and Hungary, the first such agreemen=
t of the cold war, and
negotiated the restoration of full relations with Yugoslavia in 1970.  He=
often cited a remark of
John XXIII, "There are enemies of the church, but the church has no enemi=
es."
A
1961 - Mr. Green was the senior American diplomat in Seoul, South Korea, =
when Gen. Park
Chung Hee seized power in a military coup that ousted an elected governme=
nt.  As soon as he
learned of the coup, Mr. Green announced on local radio that the United S=
tates continued to back
the ousted civilian Government, a decision that did not endear him to the=
Korean military.
He was named Ambassador to Indonesia in July, 1965, only weeks ahead=
of an anti-
Communist purge there that would see Sukarno replaced with Mr. Suharto an=
d would lead to the
deaths of an estimated 500,000 Indonesians.
To make clear the tensions between Indonesia and the United States a=
t the time of Mr. Green's
appointment --- the Indonesians were opposed to American military involve=
ment in Vietnam ---
Mr. Sukarno organized a "Go Home, Green" protest by thousands of demonstr=
ators outside of the
Ambassador's residence, only hours after Mr. Green presented his credenti=
als to the Indonesian
leader.
Ambassador Green, who was widely praised within the State Department=
for his bravery during
the months of bloodshed that followed, practiced what he described as a "=
low-profile concept" of
diplomacy during his years in Indonesia.
=
1972 - The Cardinal, who spoke Spanish, French, English, German and Portu=
gese, and studied
Polish, Russian and Chinese, was tactful in all of them.
His diplomatic finesse was put to good use in 1972, when Juan D. Per=
on, the former Argentine
dictator, who was on his way back to Buenos Aires, stopped in Rome to see=
k an audience with the
Pope.   Even though it was clear that Peron would return to power, the Va=
tican wanted to avoid
the appearance of giving him its blessing.  Cardinal Casaroli met with Pe=
ron for 90 minutes in his
hotel and emerged to announce, "Mr. Peron has himself considered it oppor=
tune to forgo seeking
an audience with the Pontiff."
=
1969 - 1973 At the height of the Vietnam War, Mr. Green served in Washing=
ton as the Assistant
Secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, a post in which he helped o=
versee foreign policy in all
of the Far East.  His office did much of the background work in preparati=
on for Mr. Nixon's visit
to China, and he was one of the 13 senior American officials who accompan=
ied the President to
Beijing.
=
1975 - Often portrayed as a skillful seeker of compromise, the Cardinal c=
ould also hew to a
tougher line.  He was credited with helping to draft the unstinting langu=
age on human rights and
religious freedom in the declaration signed at the 1975 Helsinki Conferen=
ce on European Security
and Cooperation.  =
=
1973 - 1975 - Mr. Green was Ambassador to Australia. He returned from Aus=
tralia to become the
State Department's coordinator of population affairs.  He retired in 1979=
and went on to write
three books, all of them touching on his experiences in Asia.
=
1979 - Appointed Secretary of State in April, he was named a cardinal by =
John Paul II in June.
Under his tenure as Secretary of State, the Vatican's relationship t=
o the Italian Government also
changed dramatically.  Cardinal Casaroli signed a concordat in 1984 under=
which Roman
Catholicism ceased to be the state religion of Italy.  But he insured tha=
t the state would still help the
Vatican, notably in maintaining churches and preserving religious art.
And when the Vatican bank, the Institute for Religious Works, was fo=
und to have financial ties
to Banco Ambrosiano and became embroiled in the scandal surrounding Ambro=
siano's collapse in
1982, Cardinal Casaroli was instrumental in deflecting the disgrace.  He =
directed the Vatican to
negotiate a settlement with Ambrosiano's creditors worth $244 million.  H=
e also supervised the
rewriting of Vatican rules to limit its financial activities at commercia=
l banks.  =
=
Legend - Legend has it that upon his arrival in the Tokyo Embassy in 1939=
as the secretary to the
Ambassador, Mr. Green saw the portrait of a young woman named Lispenard S=
eabury Crocker on
the mantelpiece of the home of her father, a senior diplomat in the Embas=
sy, and announced that
he would marry her.  In 1942, he did.  The couple had three children, two=
of whom survive. Mrs.
Green died in 1986.
=
1989 - The Cardinal submitted his resignation in 1989 when he turned 75, =
but the Pope asked him
to stay on.  When he finally left office in 1990, and was replaced by Ang=
elo Cardinal Sodano, the
Pope explained that he delayed the retirement because "I considered that =
I could not immediately
deprive myself of such a wise and expert collaborator."  The Cardinal's f=
uneral was held in St.
Peter's Basilica.
=
REMEMBRANCES
=
I met Mr. Green, probably during 1969, when I was Chief of Protocol =
for the Institute on
World Affairs at San Diego State University, a summertime program that br=
ought a wide variety of
guest speakers to the school to lecture on a variety of subjects.  During=
my three years in that role I
heard many great lecturers  in the field of international affairs.  Some =
I remember vividly.  Some I
do not. Mr. Green falls into the second group, perhaps because I didn't g=
et to drive him back and
forth to the airport (one of my primary functions), so I never had a real=
opportunity to chat with
him one-on-one, as I did with many of the other dignitaries who attended =
the Institute.  My
program notes only record that I gave him a B for his lecture style, a B+=
for his lecture content,
and a cryptic note that he had "the heaviest damn briefcase I've ever car=
ried!"  Not a bad obit, I
think.
=
My audience (it really can't be called anything else) with Cardinal =
Casaroli was an entirely
different matter.  I still don't know exactly how it happened, perhaps Di=
vine intervention, or
perhaps one archivist's curiosity about another.  It was the summer of 19=
88, and I had spent three
years as DIPLOMACY WORLD's publisher and editor and, along the way, put t=
ogether a huge
collection of Diplomacy publications, including the hobby's Archives.  I =
had no idea what I was
going to do with them, but I knew I needed advice.  I was also busy plann=
ing and prepping for my
first big, extended trip to Europe.  I was going to spend 3 weeks in Lond=
on and then another 4
weeks in Italy, culminating with a week in Rome over my birthday. During =
my research for my trip
I must have come across a reference to the Vatican Archives.  That got me=
to thinking.  Surely
they could advise me what to do with mine. (Only a non-Catholic, non-Ital=
ian would think like
that, right?).  So, I called the local Diocese office and found a clerk w=
ho had a copy of the Vatican
phone book (Yes, such a thing exists.)  She spent a good half-hour with m=
e trying to find a listing
for The Vatican Archives.  No such listing.  She did find the Pope's list=
ing however.  It was the
first one in the book.  Anyway, eventually, under the Secretary of State'=
s office she found a listing
for Archives.  She gave me the number.  I don't know what possessed me to=
do it, but I dialed it. =
I had never called anybody in Italy in my life, let alone anybody in=
The Vatican.   Well, the ring
sounded rather strange but the phone worked!   After a few rings, a man's=
voice answered in,
surprise, Italian!  Well, I didn't speak a word of Italian, so I just sai=
d "Hello?"  There was a pause,
and then a rather surprised "Hello?"  I'm not sure exactly what I said ot=
her than the basics that I
was an American diplomacy archivist coming to Rome and would it be possib=
le to see the
Vatican's Archives.  Dead silence.  The voice asked if I was bringing a l=
etter of introduction from
my bishop or priest.  Long pause.  Well, no, I said.  I'm not Catholic.  =
Longer dead silence. =
=
Well, to make a long story shorter, I did get to Rome and I did get=
to meet the fellow that I had
talked to. It turned out he was the Vatican archivist and he was also an =
American monsignor from,
of all places, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.  He met me just as I was finishing a=
professionally guided
tour of the Vatican museums.  I'll never forget that look on that tour gu=
ide's face when this priest
comes up to the group and asks if there is a Mr. Peery in her party.  Any=
way, he took me off
down a series of long halls and we spent several hours looking at and dis=
cussing how the Vatican
Archives operate. He told me that I was the first person from the States =
to call him since he had
had his job as Archivist and the first person ever to actually be interes=
ted in the Archives for their
own sake.  He asked me a lot of questions, as well, probably trying to fi=
gure out if I was sane, or
perhaps a Protestant spy!  Eventually he asked if I would like to meet hi=
s boss.  Well, that floored
me a bit; since I knew the Pope was at his summer palace.  But I readily =
agree.  He got on the
phone and spoke a few hundred words in rapid-fire Italian.  Hanging up, h=
e looked surprised and
said, "He agreed."   And so we raced off down some more halls!  =
=
The Vatican halls are huge!  They are intended to allow two people t=
alking to each other to
stroll side by side, in both directions, with plenty of room between the =
traffic flow.  I would guess
most of them are 20 feet wide, and equally high.  And they go on forever,=
and then you turn a
corner, and they go even more!   And after a while they all look alike.  =
We eventually came to a
door, probably 12 feet high.  No sign, no number, no guard, no nothing.  =
Just one out of hundreds
of doors!  Actually, it reminded me of the Kremlin.  Anyway, he knocked s=
oftly.  I didn't hear a
sound, but he opened the door and gestured for me to come in.  What I saw=
was straight out of
Premminger's movie The Cardinal.  The office was probably 60 feet square =
and 20 feet high. The
colors were white and gold and all the art looked like it belonged in the=
Vatican museums.  Way
over in one corner of the room there was one desk, rather small and very =
Rocco; and two chairs. =
That was it.  On the desk was one lamp, a phone, and a spotless blotter! =
=
=
Sitting behind the desk was the archivist's boss, the Secretary of S=
tate Cardinal Casaroli. He
just looked at me while my escort rattled off some more gunfire Italian. =
He was obviously an older
man, and very Italian-looking.  Only the bit of red on his black cassock =
suggested he might be
important.  Finally he took off his glasses, laid them on the blotter, an=
d rubbed his eyes!  A strange
greeting, I thought.  He left them off, looked at and through me, and ask=
ed a few questions:
"Where are you from?"
"San Diego, California."
"What parish?"
" Well, I live in Blessed Sacrament, but I'm not Catholic."  =
That got a raised eye-brow response.
"Why did you come to Rome?"
"Because I studied Latin for four years,  and it is greatest city in=
the world."
"Did you study Latin in a Catholic school?
"No. Public school. Classical Latin, not Church Latin."
Another raised eye-brow.
"You are an archivist?"
"Yes, of diplomacy materials."
"How big is your archives?"
"250,000 items, give or take a few thousand."
That got two raised eye-brows.
"How long have you been collecting?"
"Twenty-three years."
"Have you learned anything from your visit here?"
"Yes. You need more filing boxes and you need more help."
Finally, a slight smile.
We chatted about some of the places I had seen in Rome and the other=
places I had visited in
Italy.  I mentioned that I was going to see Aida at the Baths the followi=
ng night since it was my
birthday.  And that led us to a discussion of opera, of all things.  =
Finally, with what seemed like an almost audible sigh, he reached fo=
r his glasses and put them
on.
And the next thing I knew, I was back in the hall. =
=
LAST WORDS =
=
It wasn't until I read the obits that I realized that Casaroli had b=
egun his Vatican career as an
archivist, and perhaps that was in the back of his mind as well as we cha=
tted. I wonder what my
American monsignor was thinking?
What did catch my eye, however, was that second paragraph, "The caus=
e of death was an
infection after minor surgery." The Vatican's medical support facilities =
in Rome are terrible.  This
is not the first time something like this has happened. What should have =
been a routine medical
procedure went bad and a patient died! Casaroli deserved better.
Marshall Green, on the other hand, went the way any red-blooded Amer=
ican diplomat would
have wanted; playing golf with family at hand.  =
No doubt the two of them are busy now going through a debriefing pro=
cess at the Pearly Gates. =

A DIPPER'S SUMMER
READING GUIDE
By Larry Peery
Summer is upon us, hard as that is to believe.  I remember when I was a kid I used to look
forward to summer because it meant I had more time to read the kinds of books I wanted to read:
lots of military history, biographies and autobiographies about and by famous military figures; and
novels with wartime settings. I don't recall reading any books by or about diplomats per se,
although some of those wartime generals and admirals did go on to become successful diplomats. I
recall that the library was filled with row after row of books about war in one form or another, but
I doubt if you could have filled a single shelf with all the books by or about diplomats or
diplomacy.
Well, times have changed.  I don't know what the library collections include anymore, but even
a quick look at the web sites of Barnes and Noble or Amazon will show you that books by or
about diplomats or about diplomacy are selling.  If you have the time and money I suggest you
wander down to your local book store and check out what they offer, being sure to stop by the
remainders table --- you can often find last year's best sellers marked down a lot!   If you don't
have a lot of time or money there is another route you can take.
Take a few minutes to visit the B&N and Amazon sites.  Check out their home page.  Then do
a search on the subject of Diplomacy.  You'll find that B&N lists around 475 titles in best selling
order! You'll get them in groups of twenty-five or so.  The format offers the title, book
availability, author (or editor), whether it is a hard copy or paperback, the date of publication, the
list price, their price, and sometimes a link to more information.  If you click on that, you'll find
more details on the book and often reviews from various book reviewing publications.  The
Amazon site isn't quite as fancy or clean as the B&N one, but it has its advantages.  It currently
lists some 700+ titles in alphabetical order! Again the basic information is there: title, author or
editor, hard copy or paperback, date of publication, their price, and a more information link.  This
is a bit different than the B&N set-up since it allows readers, authors or publishers to comment!
Even if you don't want to buy anything you can learn a lot just by going through the two sites
and reading the various reviews and comments on the books offered.  In fact, if you did it
systematically you'd probably get close to a university education in diplomatic studies!
I've selected a few of my favorite books by diplomats or about subjects of interest to those
interested in diplomacy.  I've tried to pick ones that I thought would be of special interest to
Diplomacy players.  But first, here's a few things to keep in mind as you begin your summer
Diplomacy reading program.
All books, including those about diplomacy, are written for a purpose.  The reader's may be to
learn something or to be entertained.  The author's may be to educate, to justify, to convert, or
even just to make some money!  Books about diplomacy may be written by diplomats (either
professionals or amateurs), scholars, historians, journalists, or even eye-witnesses. Retired
diplomats often write "memoirs;" which can be informative and entertaining, but are rarely
completely truthful.  As you read any of these books think about what the author is saying, and
what they don't say. What is their subject: a single event or a broad panorama? Who are they
writing about; major figures or ordinary people; and how well did they know them? What is their
perspective and bias?  Never assume that just because an author has a "scholarly" background he
will be neutral or objective in his writing.  Is this book a work about a current event, an on-going
diplomatic issue, or a historical event?  Consider how the author says what he has to say.  Some
diplomatic authors are great writers and horrible talkers, and the opposite is also true.  Remember,
diplomacy consists of both talk (negotiations) and the written word (orders and treaties).  Well,
enough of that.  On with the list!  A "*" indicates a book I have especially enjoyed.
