<p>
Diplomats and Diplomacy players have been talking, chatting,
gossiping, and
rumour-mongering for years; so I'm surprised that there hasn't been
more
interest in and use of chat rooms in the Diplomacy hobby &#150; or
perhaps
I've just missed the news and gossip about them.
<p>
Like most things Internet and Web-related, it wasn't until somebody
figured out
how to make money off of them that chat rooms began to pop up all
over the
Internet. Today, just one provider of chat room software and
support,
PARACHAT, claims to have over 80,000 chat rooms up and running. I
bet they
do. I know. I have three of them under my belt at the moment; and
here I am
promoting a fourth for TDP.
<p>
With the latest available free software putting up a chat room is
easy. If I
can do it, <i>anybody</i> can do it! In fact, if you can do a home page
site,
putting a CR on it is a piece of cake, and probably won't take more
than fifteen
minutes of your time. You'll probably spend more time trying to
decide where
to put it on your home page than you would actually getting it up
and
running.
<p>
Getting people to visit your CR is another matter, just as getting
people to
visit your home page can be a real chore. Sure, if you have a lot of
time to
spend, you can promote a CR or HP all over the Internet; and people
will visit
&#150; once!
<p>
But getting people to come back, especially on a regular basis, is
hard!  It
takes a lot of work to keep a CR or HP moving, and without that
movement,
either will surely wither and die. On the other hand, a CR or HP can
become a
living, viable organism and assume a personality and life all of its
own. The Pouch itself
is a good example of that.
<p>
Frankly, I'm surprised that TDP hasn't put up a CR already. I've
discussed
the idea with Manus and Simon before, but both were and no doubt are
too busy
to do it, despite their profession of interest. The purpose of this
article, and
my proposed course of action below, is to find out just how much
interest
there is in establishing a CR under TDP's umbrella, either within
The Pouch's home
page or on another one. The second question, of course, is this the
right
time to do it?  Since school is out and summer is upon us, I think
this an
excellent time to do something like this. My first CR experiences
were last
year about this time, and I remember what happened when school
started in the
fall.  Traffic fell by half in the rooms I frequented &#150;
everybody had
gone back to school!
<p>
A TDP CR?  Just the idea gets my creative juices going. The three
biggest
problems are already solved:
<ol>
<li>A <i>raison d'etre</i> (i.e.,  Diplomacy),
<li>a body politique (The DP family), and
<li>support (If this crowd can't create,
maintain, and fill a CR, something is seriously wrong).
</ol>
Still, there are
issues and concerns that need to be addressed before taking what I
see as a
logical step in the development of TDP.
<p>
Think of a TDP CR as a blank canvas, or a pictorial/verbal radio
station. It's a canvas because we are dealing with a blank screen.
If it
isn't filled with something -- words, graphics, etc. -- it is lifeless.
It's a
radio station because we're dealing with verbal pictures that span
great
distances on an instantaneous basis. I remember vividly the night
Princess Di
was killed in that "it could only have happened in Paris" traffic
accident. I
was in a CR with 8-10 other people. I happened to be checking the AP
flashes
when the bulletin came across. I told the others in the CR what
had
happened. It was a remarkable experience, second for me perhaps only
to the
death of John Kennedy in 1963; where I also was the first to hear it
at my
school (I was at lunch in the school newspaper office when the word
came over
the radio). Ten people in eight countries on five continents
were
instantaneously bound together by a common grief. An experience I am
sure that
none of us will ever forget. Can a TDP CR achieve that kind of
bonding?  Who
knows.  Hopefully not in a shared grief, but perhaps in a shared joy
and love
of the game and hobby.
<p>
As I just illustrated, but I want to repeat for emphasis, a CR deals
with
realities of time and distance on a worldwide basis. I don't know
what
percentage of TDP readers are overseas, but I assume it is
considerable. And
it will surely grow when the CR comes into use. When I compiled my
first
e-mail address book, less than a year ago, it had 300 names, 85% of
them
Dippers. Today, my book has over 3,000 names from 30+
countries,
and only 15% of them are Dippers. A CR that appeals to a worldwide
following,
such as Diplomacy and TDP, will be a 24 hour a day entity. I've
discovered,
in some of the CR's that I use, that if I stay in the room for a 24
hour
period (no, I've never managed it; 17 hours in a 24 hour period is my
record),
I'll run into people from North America, Asia, and Europe in,
roughly,
eight hour segments.  The only other concern, perhaps, might be one
of
language.  That's not a major item. Almost everybody who uses the
Internet
and plays Dip can communicate in English, even if they don't want to
admit
it!  (Have you ever heard a Frenchman swear at a World DipCon?  It is always
done in
English!  For maximum impact, I suppose.)
<p>
Creating a CR is like having a baby. It isn't a big deal, unless
you're the
mother!  The real work begins immediately thereafter. A CR under
TDP's
sponsorship must be controlled. Obviously, a task for TDP's Council.
Control
can be benevolent (traffic control) or something else (basher
control). Fortunately, I don't think that will be a concern in a TDP
CR, if
the room is properly supervised. CR's, like kids, have to be
watched
constantly! (smile)
<p>
And what of content?  It would be easy to just create a TDP CR and
say, "Come
chat about Diplomacy."  And yet that would be such a waste. I'm sure
the
content of the room's discussions can be as creative and diverse as
the content that the
'Zine itself carries. The big plus, of course, is the addition of
live
interaction among hobbyists. Form follows function, architects
say. Perhaps. CR's aren't quite the same, but the general principle
applies, I
suppose. A CR can be used for many different purposes, again
depending on the
nature of the content. You can entertain, inform, educate,
debate,
etc., etc. The possibilities are nearly endless.
<p>
So much for generalities. What of specifics?  Here's a draft
scenario which I
think offers a viable way of getting a CR up and running for TDP.
Actually,
that's a bit inaccurate since such a CR already exists, although I
don't know
if anybody besides myself has visited it yet!  I took the liberty of
putting
up a THE DIPLOMATIC POUCH chat room on my Diplomacy page a while
back,
primarily to protect the use of that name, but also to give TDP
staffers a
place to meet in realtime. It's there.  You can see it, or use it,
on
<a href="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/Dungeon/7969">
my home page</a>.
As soon as TDP
decides on another site, I'll gladly give up TDP logo on mine. In
the
meantime, feel free to visit my HP and use the CR. It might give you
some
practice with the genre, if you're not familiar with it. Anyway,
here is what
I am proposing:
<ol>
<li>
<p>
TDP Council approve the creation and sponsorship of a CR, and
assume
responsibility for its general supervision.</p>
<li>
<p>
They recruit a volunteer (or two) handle two very different jobs.
First,
administering the room. Second, director of programming. The first
would
handle the stop watching, allocating time. The second would handle
the task
of filling that time. It sounds strange, but it might be better to
have two
different people doing this, especially once the thing gets going.
These
volunteers would obviously, become a part of the Council.</p>
<li>
<p>
He, she, or they would begin to recruit volunteer hosts to
assume
responsibility for various time and subject area slots on the CR
program
and calendar. These might be one time shots or serial efforts. For
example,
in some of my CR's we have specific nights set aside for specific
groups of
people, or specific time periods in which people in specified
areas are
encouraged to use the room, or we have on occasion set aside a
specific
date and time range for a theme event (a Beethoven's Birthday
Party, a New
Year's Eve Party, etc.). The idea is to have something going on
and let
people know about it well in advance, so they can plan their
schedule.  Or,
alternatively, say, in effect, "Nothing is going on during
these
hours. It's <i>potpourri</i>."  The idea is to create an ongoing,
predictable
routine so that people in specific areas will know when people
with similar
interests will be in the CR.  It sounds easy; it isn't!</p>
<li>
<p>
These two individuals will have to create a balanced program
covering all
areas of the hobby that features programs, questions & answers
periods, and
guided open discussions. Obviously, if you are in Antartica and
interested
in pre-A.D. variants you probably won't get a lot of time
allocated to
you. On the other hand, if you're a newbie and you want to ask
questions
about PBEM Dip play, you'll probably find a large, regular time
slot
available. And, of course, you have to allow for free time, open
to
anybody.</p>
<li>
<p>
All of this, obviously, is based on a simple chat room format.
Given enough
interest and expertise, you could create a multi-room chat room
that offers
something for everybody all the time. Sorry guys, I'm a B&W TV
sort of
guy. The important thing, I think, is to start small and build
on
that. Better to set aside a two hour period each evening for an
open
discussion and have a lively one, than to create ten separate hour
time
slots, each occupied by one lonely host.</p>
<li>
<p>
So, there you have it. Sort of an outline for what might work for
a TDP
CR. The question now -- which only you can answer -- is, is this
something you
want?  Are you willing to host a regular time slot in the CR on a
given
subject?  Or, are you interested in being a part of a CR
experience as a
listener or participant?  Without some feedback on how many people
are
actually interested in participating in such a venture, it is
impossible to
make any real, intelligent decisions. I know I don't want to be
the one to
host a party and have no one come. So...</p>
<li>
<p>
It's your turn. Send me some email feedback on this topic. Address
it to me
at
<a href="mailto:peery@ix.netcom.com">peery@ix.netcom.com</a>
and send a copy to Manus and Simon, so they know what's going on.
And, in the
ways that only they work, I'll let Manus pick a date and time a
few weeks
after this issue is published for a roundtable discussion in TDP
CR (as it
now exists) about the CR itself. Remember, no decisions have
been
made. It's only an idea that is being discussed at this point.</p>
</ol>
<p>
First call, gentle Dippers, is it time for a TDP CR?
