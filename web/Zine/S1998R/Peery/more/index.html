If you look at my Dip home page,
http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/7969
you can see my WDC VIII Report,
an obituary, of sorts, I wrote for two real world Dippers who passed on
recently,
and a "summer reading list" that I put together.
I have one X-File version of a WDC VIII report left to write.
Please, mention, in your pubs, that I am looking for help in building
the WDC Shrine.
All of the above stuff is available in HTML files or TXT files, if you
want them.
Regards,
Peery
