I'll try to throw something together.  Larry mentioned to me that he's
working on something as well.  What's the deadline?

ADR page is updated (I am uploading it now.), and will update the Cons
section today as well.  By the end of the week I should have Buz's ADR
results of the WDC8.  Still waiting on David Hood to send me the "officials"
from his end.
