<H3>Italian End of Game Statement</H3>

        Congratulation to the winner, thanks to the rest.
I have lost one message already, so now I have to be short (don't want to
sleepless night in the row ;).
<p>
        Just one comment on the solo victory: if the game setting were
different, it would be much harder for Egypt (or anyone else) to make it
solo.  Of course Italy has benefited from the NoNMR setting, too.
<p>
        The other thing is, that with a willing Poland, a 3 way draw could 
have
been achieved.  (Don't shoot me if I am wrong ;)
<P>
        Otherwise the fast game was really enjoyable, even with NoNMR. 
 Well,
nothing is perfect ;). ( we can't have this speed with other settings )
<P>
        Thanks for the master for his work, and hope that we'll meet in a
similar game (once I got more time ;).

<H3>Ukranian End of Game Statement</H3>

Congratulations to Egypt for timing his campaigns so well &
ultimately securing a well deserved solo win.
<P>
I took over the Ukrainian position when Italy & Poland seemed
to have the game wrapped up. It was clear that I was to be
conquered by Poland while Italy stood by. That was when Egypt
moved in from the south, propping up my faltering position for
several turns in order to repulse the Poles. It was then that
Italy appeared to join with Egypt - Poland fate was sealed, &
so my usefulness was at an end. Ukraine was swallowed up by
Egypt, who then turned on Italy with impressive skill.
<P>
I agree with Italy that the NMR setting further increased the
likelihood of a solo victory above that of a standard NoPress
game. It's a shame that of the nations that survived, most were
CD - you'd expect players who made it that far to stick with it,
no?

<H3>Egypt's End of Game Statement</H3>

Greetings All Leaders,
<P>
	First let me say thank you to our great Master for setting up this game
and managing it.  Second I would really like to thank  everyone that stay 
with
their position to the end.  I feel it takes a lot of dedication on a 
players
part to stick with a game no matter if they are losing or winning.  So 
Congrats
to all those that did stay with it.
<P>
	My End of the Game statment.
<P>
In the beginning, as Egypt, I felt that I only could possibly come up with
a DRAW, like I did as Egypt in Blitzz.  As Turkey started making mistakes I
started thinking that things were good.  When Italy left me alone, things
started looking really good.  As I swallowed Turkey, I saw that Poland and 
Italy
had a hold on most of the board, so my aim was to take Poland head on. 
 With
that in mind I saw a chance to help Ukr out.  This was a selfish idea 
because
for me to take out Poland I would need more units up there.  So by helping
Ukranie out, I was able to stop the advance ot Poland and get units there.
My decision to finish Ukr was based on Italy's advance towards me.  He 
entered
what was the nuetral zone between us.  He did however move out the next 
year
but I knew then I could not trust him to much longer.
<P>
	So started my campaign to aline my units to finish Poland and take
on Italy.  Thru most of this time I figured that it would end in a 3 way 
DRAW.
But when I made my stab at Italy, Poland all of a sudden started helping 
me.
SO I must really thank Poland for his help. With out him doing what he did
the game would have propably ended in a DRAW.
<P>
	So with no worries about Poland turning, I was able to focus on italy.
I am sure it was frustrating for Italy to see Poland helping me make my 
move
for the win and not be able to do anything.
<P>
	The game happens to not only my first SOLO in modern variant but in
all of Email diplomacy.  To bad it wasn't a HOF game, but you can't have
everything.
<P>

Again I really would like to thank Italy and Poland for their ability to
finish the game.  It was truely sad to see only 3 players left when there
was still 5 country's still alive.
<P>

	I hope that someday I can play with you all again.  But hopefully
not as Egypt, twice in 2 games is enough for me.
<P>

Thanks again to Simon and all of the players.
<P>

<H3>Poland's End of Game Statement</H3>

I was Poland in the beginning of the game, unfortunately I was 2 hours
late once and fell out.
Later I took it back, but again out because the something happened to my
computer.
<P>
Anyway, I am not here to complain. One has to expect that powers who
do well don't change owners all the time.
This is just a warning to you all. so that you don't have to learn it
the hard way as I did.
<P>
The game was quite interesting ... I was doing wery well, and took all
russia... before I fell out...
then I came back when my predecessor had an attack upon Germany.
That too went well. My plans from there was to signal Egypt that I was
to co-operate with hm against Italy...
but... I went abandoned... and Poland didn't signal anything...
much to my dissapointment. Instead it was crushed by Egypt and Italy.
<P>
Both of you played your powers well.
and Congratulations to Egypt.

<H3>Italy's End of Game Statement</H3>

	Let me respond to Egypt's evaluation.  I was a bit surprised to hear
about my entrance to the neutral zone.  I was not aware of ever being
 threatening, in fact that was my biggest mistake in the game, that I did 
show
soft back to egypt for almost the whole duration of the game.  Even moving 
to
ION was not safe enough, I supposed to have a backup for GRE, rather than
moving out of BUL, etc.  I did not want to stab E at all, specially being a 
no
HoF game, this game had no real importance in that sense. I have taken it 
very
seriously at the beginning, though.  Many time, when it seemed, that 'Italy
just stands by' it was to play it safe.  The low risk, low yield approach 
did
work well, and the CDs had only helped :).  Egypt has one slight advantage
being in the corner.  I couldn't move anywhere without watching my back.
That is why at one stage I have offered TUN for IST and tried to let E help 
me
finish S.  I was actually releived, when he decided to pick on P, which was
a slower process, comparing to accepting S's offer to pick on me. Spain was
offering an alliance to E against me, and I couldn't be sure that he is 
coming
with good intention.  It was then, when I have realised, that I have to
displace him from ION and never let him back again.
<P>
	Towards the end I had much less time for the game, and started making
mistakes ( or should I say making more mistakes then usually ;) ), but this 
is
not to make E's victory worth less.  He did well, and the win is deserved, 
if
we forget about P's behaviour.  If I was less tired lately, I would be 
probably
very angry with him ;) but strangely enough I did not really care.  ( 
Again,
the no HoF game is easier to loose ;)  ) Anyway, Poland, where is your end 
of
game evaluation ? ;)
<P>
	Sorry about my english, you have probably realised already why do I
like nopress games.  ;)  I never meanage to say what I really wanted to 
say.
<P>
	Otherwise this was my very first game, which I was around for the
whole duration of the game, after a few replacement ones.  Without our 
master
I think it would take me ages, to reach this far so quickly in this game.
<P>
	Thanks again to all of you.
<P>
