<H3>Britain's End of Game Statement</H3>


<dl>
<dt><strong>The Early Years</strong>
<dd>
  I started by capturing the natural british centers of Morroco
  (which in my opinion is spelled wrong, should be Morocco :) ),
  Norway, Belgium and Ireland.  At the same time I lost Gibraltar to
  the Spanish, which was no big surprise.  In the year 1996 I also
  lost Morocco after which I was solely a northern european power.
<p>
  Being Britain and fairly safe on my islands I planned to wait for
  an opening before choosing who to attack first.  The alternatives
  were Spain, Germany and Russia.  Germany was by far the most
  lucrative of them all having all those nice coastal centers in the
  lowlands and Scandinavia.  Spain was already hostile and had
  defences against me, so attacking him would have been complicated.
  Russia was a bit far away in the east and had only two centers I
  really could have taken from him: Sweden and Murmansk.
<p>
  I attacked Germany in fall of 1997 and took first Holland and the
  next year Sweden from him.  In 1999 Germany went CD and capturing
  rest of him became relatively easy.  The only problem was to get
  enough armies quickly enough to capture his inland centers before
  anyone else could do the same.
<p>
<dt><strong>The 21st Century</strong>
<dd>
  By that time Italy had grown to be 14 centers before no one really
  took notice.  I was happy to see Turkey and Egypt to quit fighting
  each other for a while and push Italians back from the eastern Med
  and Egypt.  France and Spain also reorganized their defences.  I
  decided the best thing I could do was to leave those two alone.
  Spain could easily block Italy from getting to Atlantic and France
  was doing a good job keeping him away from northern France and the
  lowlands.
<p>
  I decided to secure the northern waters for my personal use.  To
  achieve that I needed to capture Gdansk and see that Russia didn't
  survive with Murmansk or StP.  After that it was fairly simple to
  build a stalemate line on Baltic and Finland.  That would make it
  about 95% certain that I would at least survive the game, if not win
  it all alone.
<p>
  The next goal was to keep Italy from growing anymore.  I sent loads
  of armies to southern Germany and northern France and kept pushing
  against Italian troops in Switzerland and France.  I captured Lyon
  and Switzerland before it was time to stab France and take Paris and
  Bordeaux from him.
<p>
  It became impossible to get any further than that.  Spain made some
  mistakes in the Med that allowed Italy to gain control of the sea
  areas between Iberia and Apenninia.  His fleets on Gulf of Lyon and
  Ligurian Sea were able to secure him Marseilles.  Poland on the
  other hand was growing rapidly at the expense of Ukranian mistakes.
  Should him and Italy choose to work together, I might have had a bit
  of difficulties in Central Europe.  I had to reinforce my line of
  defence there and I needed more armies for that.  It was time to
  stab Spain.
<p>
<dt><strong>The End Game</strong>
<dd>
  My only chance in solo victory was in speedy advance to the Med and
  then capturing Italy's homeland.  Naturally, I failed in that.
  Maybe I should have stabbed Spain earlier, when he was in good
  positions in the Mid Med and his back was wide open to me, and when
  Egypt was still fighting Turkey.  Maybe my stab was poorly executed.
  In any case, I got jammed in Spain, Italy put a plug on Gibraltar
  and Egypt took Mid Med into his control before I had Madrid.  That
  sealed the game and it became just a task of finishing off Spain and
  Italy before we could declare a three way draw.
<p>
<dt><strong>End Comments</strong>
<dd>
  It was an interesting game.  The map was new to me so finding
  stalemate lines and inbreakable defences took some time and
  planning.  NMR-rule maybe took something out of the game, but on the
  other hand, we probably would still be waiting for a replacement
  Germany in 1999 if it weren't for that rule.  It was nice to have
  this game proceed speedily.
<p>
  I think Poland did an excellent job surviving the first few years
  under Russian attack and finally killing him pretty much all by
  himself.  Also, Ukraine died amazingly quickly.  I think he went
  from 7 centers down to 4 in one year and lost the rest within two
  years.  Maybe some poor play on his behalf but also some good moves
  by the polish.
<p>
  Egypt also did a fairly good job at finally killing Turkey and
  putting up a stalemate line against Poland.  I was hoping for him to
  take the easy centers and attack Italy so that I could have an
  easier access to Med, but of course he would not do such a mistake.
  Too bad... :)
<p>
  Congrats to both of you for a game well played and thanks to Vince
  for setting up the game and keeping it running smoothly.

<H3>Russia's End of Game Statement</H3>

Unfortunatly I am writing this now and not at way back when, when I was
eliminated, so my details are a bit sketchy but here are a few thoughts.
<P>
I joined in shortly after Poland began her attack on me, and shortly there
after was NMR'd when the judge processed a phase early.  In that phase
Poland managed to completly out flank me, and her superior play spelled
my doom soon afterward.
<P>
Watching the rest of the moves play out was very interesting, the way
you guys played was impressive.  Congratualtions.
<P>
On the settings, I liked them alot.  They created a quick and fun game.

<H3>Poland's End of Game Statement</H3>

<dl>
<dt><strong>Opening Comments</strong>
<dd>
  This was my first PBeM diplomacy game that I played from start to
  finish.  And perhaps only my 15th game total in my life time.
  It was my first modern game ever and was totally unfamiliar with
  the map.  I was dismayed at first when I was selected as Poland.
  I thought an early death for sure!
<p>
<dt><strong>The Early Years</strong>
<dd>
  Early on Germany and Poland stayed away from each other which
  helped a lot.  Britain attacking Germany and pressuring him so
  well help out as well.  The Ukrainians were preoccupied with the
  Balkan region and harrassing the Turkish.  So it left only the
  Russians to contend with.  I concentrated on armies planning on
  gaining fleets after I secured my borders on the mainland.
<p>
  All of my troops were occupied by Russia, when Germany went CD and
  Britain started swarming on the mainland.  If I tried to get some
  of the easy picking SC's I'd leave a vacuum behind for Russia to
  take advantage of.  Italy was huge compared to everyone else and
  started comming up the mainland to meet the british.  I needed a
  naval power to assist me in the south and occupy the British, and
  was happy to see the Italiens working with me.
<p>
<dt><strong>The Middle Years</strong>
<dd>
  Russia made some mistakes, and I had crippled him to the point it
  was just push him around mode.  Mainly because the Ukrainians were
  still occupied by harrassing the Turkish.  The British made their
  move and Russia was quickly eliminated.  I needed to build fleets
  fast or my ports would soon be closed to me.  That was when the
  Ukrainians changed tactics and started a run for the Russia SC's
<p>
  I got miffed at that because I felt it enabled the British to seal
  my port and lock me out.  I was thankful that the British didn't
  push the attack; I couldn't survive an attack from a coordinated
  Ukraine and Britain.   Instead Britian setup a stalemate line that
  I couldn't break through, so I concentrated solely on eliminating
  Ukraine for causing me such a loss.
<p>
  I was surprised at how fast he crumbled.  I was still allied with
  the Italiens and trying to get my armies up against the British to
  break through the stalemate line he had put up.
<p>
  I had two concerns at this point.  The need to break the British
  line in coordination with Italy.  And the need to seal my southern
  borders from Turkey.
<p>
  I knew I couldn't hold any of the coastal SC in the Med with out
  fleets but I could control the Black sea.
<p>
  Unfortunatly Italy wasn't cooperating as I thought he would.  He
  must have seen me more as a competitor instead of an Ally against
  Britain and started hitting my SC's.  I didn't know how to read
  Italy at all.  So I continued my movement to the South taking over
  the Turkish lands.
<p>
  I stopped in Iran hoping to share Turkey with Egypt.  I still
  needed to get Istanbul and bulgaria which were proving difficult.
<p>
  For too long I kept supporting Egypt into Adana and trying to push
  my army from Ankara to Istanbul.  He never got the message, I
  think I should have just continued to press on south, and allow
  Italy to grow again.  The alliance between Spain and Britain was
  frustrating, mainly because Britain kept growing and Spain stayed
  the same, yet Spain never altered course.
<p>
  Italy never coordinated with me to break through the British line
  and Britian was sending more troops to Central Europe to make the
  line impenatrable.  The only way I could get Gdansk back was to
  come up through Switzland and move north.
<p>
<dt><strong>The End Game</strong>
<dd>
  Egypt never worked towards the line I wanted and continued to
  attack me.  Then Britain timely stabbed Spain and took the SC
  almost at the same time Italy went into CD.  I was dimayed to see
  Egypt continue to attack me instead of rushing to seal the Med
  from a British invasion.  I took over parts of Italy that were up
  against the British line.  Britian had enough armies to contiue
  the stalemate line in Central Europe so I made little head way
  their.  I had an opportunity once, but missed it.  I think Britain
  saw what I was trying to do because as I was positioning my units,
  he moved an Army into Picardy and to the front line to reinforce
  just in time.  The opportunity vanished.  All I could do now as
  watch and See if Egypt could get over in time to stop the British.
<p>
  The Italians came back and slowed the British just enough to allow
  the Egyptians to get there and enable the draw.
<p>
<dt><strong>End Comments</strong>
<dd>
  I enjoyed the game and learned how important it is to maintain a
  defended fleet with an open port.  I was lucky to get as large as
  I did.
<p>
  The NMR aspect kept the game going, which I enjoyed immensly, but
  the deadlines were probably too fast for a NMR game.  Going CD
  should be another whole day or maybe two.   The penalty is just
  too steep.
<p>
  I also learned to never leave your border unguarded to an ally.
  He may go CD and then someone else take him over and not be so
  friendly.  I think that was what happened with Ukraine early on.
<p>
  I learned a lot from watching how the British played.  It was easy
  to figure out his intentions,  I wish he had been an ally instead
  of an adversary.
<p>
  Britian seemed to understand the stalemate line and didn't waste
  his time or units trying to push further.
<p>
  I didn't get the impression the Italy understood this concept of
  a stalemate line.  I'd reach point of expansion where it didn't
  make sense to go further, because I would only be pushed back.
  And I wanted to push against the Britains not Italy.  He never
  seemed to think about what my desires and concerns might be.
<p>
  Ukraine did that with Bielorussia a couple of times.  I owned it
  in the Fall and he would take it in the spring.  I easily pushed
  him back out every fall, all the while moving my units around to
  take advantage of this yo-yo effect Bielorussia has.
<p>
  With Italy CD and Egypt contesting the line I wanted, I felt that
  I should have just continued my rush straight down into Egyptian
  territory.  Before Italy went CD though I felt that having Egypt
  as an ally would be better, but he never got that message.
<p>
  It was very frustrating.
</dl>
It was said that "Egypt also did a fairly good job at finally killing
Turkey and putting up a stalemate line against Poland."

  I disagree;  he made quite a few mistakes, but I didn't take
  advantage of them, because I wanted him to go west along Africa to
  stop up the British entrance into the med.
<p>
  I hesitated so many times, thinking will he get the message yet?
  that I blew my opportunity.
<p>
  Thanks to Vince for keeping the game going and setting it up.
  Congratulations to Britain and Egypt for a game well played.

<H3>Egypt's End of Game Statement</H3>

<dl><dt><strong>Start</strong>
<dd>
	As most of you don't know I started this game out as Spain.  So I will
begin my talk about that.
<P>
	Spain's main purpose was to remove Britian from the Iberian Pen and
form a strong hold against Britain and Italy.  Well that was until France 
made a move towards me.  So I was grateful that Britian decided it was OK t
hat I
had booted him out of my area and was going to let me focus on Italy and 
France.
<P>
	France was my first concern, but I handled holding her off very easily
by blocking up Nav and Bar. Then came time to take out Italy.
<P>

<dt><strong>Mid Game</strong>
<dd>
	I worked very carefull in planning my way around Italy.  I slowly took
ALg, Wmed and GOL from him.  At this time Britain was leaving me alone but 
I was
getting worried about my back door. He could have walked in at anytime but 
I
figured that since I was keeping Italy busy and he was fighting in Northern
Europe that he won't want a 2 front war.
<p>
	This is where Britain so nicely refered to Spains mistakes.  What
happened was I left town thinking, I could connect up with my laptop but 
the
hotel I was in didn't allow long  distance phone calls.(That's what I get 
for
staying in Arizona.)  Anyway, I went CD and someone else kindly took over 
my
spot , and in doing so decided it was more important to remove the LONE
Egyptian  Army in Mor then to push forward into Italy.
<p>

	So this brings us to when I took over Egypt.  She was down to 5 units
with Poland advancing . Italy was not attacking becuase he was working on 
Spain.
So this gave me the chance to rebuild my defense against Poland. I decided 
that
a good spot to put up a Stalemate line was the ANK, ADA IRQ line. So I 
worked
slowly trying to remove Poland and it did help that he was trying to get a
similiar line but there was now way I was going to give up IST.
<p>

<dt><strong>End of Game</strong>
<dd>
	Poland and I finally reached our Stalemate line and it was time to help
Italy  hold off England.  However Italy was becoming weak by the advancing
Polish so I decided I needed to take as many SC's from Italy as possible. 
With
my last big push into the ALG, Wmed and GOL area, I knew there was
only one thing left to do and that was finish off Italy and call it a draw.
I knew England wasn't a risky player so I decided to go for Mor before 
England
could take it.
</dl>
I really enjoyed playing the game.  It was nice for a change to have to use
pure strategy instead of wasting time talking with people.  I have never 
played
a NO PRESS game, but I would be very interested in playing another one of 
this
same variant.
<p>
	I would like to wish congrats to England and Poland for there
Outstanding Game play. Both of you are very honorable players and I would
enjoy playing with you again.
<p>
Master, how about another game, but this time give 24hrs before going CD?

The game was declared a draw between Poland, Egypt and Britain.


  This is meant to be a very-fast game with moves processing at most
every 24 hours no matter what. I will not give any extensions, and
there will be no waiting for positions that are abandoned to be
filled. Expect to go NMR once or twice as you miss a deadline and
grace, but just get back in the game as your opponents will surely
miss one or two as well.

  For those who don't know the modern variant, send the following to
