<H3>Brief Introduction</H3>
This is the fourth article in my continuing series about the Modern variant. In
the <a href=/Zine/W1995A/Mous/Modern.html>first article</a> you got an
introduction to the modern variant, as well as info on how to get started
playing it. In the other two articles I discussed the opening strategies for
<a href=/Zine/S1996M/Mous/Modern2.html>Britain</a> and
<a href=/Zine/S1996R/Mous/egypt.html>Egypt</a>.
<p>
Since that issue, a few more Modern games have ended. First came
<a href=delerium.html><em>delerium</em></a>
(no-press NMR) with a solo-win by Erik Stensland as Egypt. Erik was also
Egypt in the 3-way draw in
<a href=blitzz.html><em>blitzz</em></a>, the first modern game to finish. While
Erik seems to be an expert at playing Egypt, yours truly didn't fare nearly
so well in <a href=liarliar.html><em>liarliar</em></a> (partial press, no-NMR)
which finished with a solo
victory for Robert Shepard, playing Turkey. Finally, the oldest running
modern game not on the defunct USCA, <a href=seville.html><em>seville</em></a>
(no-press, no-NMR) ended with Toby Tyrell taking it all as Italy.
<p>
Also, we have a brand new rendition of the
<a href=
/Online/maps/modern.gif>Modern map</a>,
drawn by Andrew E. Baumann. It is of much higher quality than the map I drew up
originally. Take a look at it and maybe download it, it's worth it!
<P>
So congratulations once again to Erik, Robert and Toby, our first NMR,
press, and no-press solo-winners. Now, back to the article... This time we
will be looking at France, and you'll be able to read a few comments by
each of our winners, as well as others, on what they think of France in
Modern.

By the way, I am still looking for comments about strategy and opening
names for
the remaining countries (everything except Britain, Egypt and France), so
feel free to send your thoughts and suggestions to me at
<a href=mailto:vim2@rocketmail.com>vim2@rocketmail.com</a>. The next
article will be on Germany, so I am especially interested in your thoughts
on it.
<H3>List of Openings for France</H3>
What follows is a list of the different openings used for France in the
Modern games that have been played until now, as well as a few more that
may be of interest. As I am the GM of many Modern games, and an observer in
many more, I asked players for their opinions on strategies for the various
powers in the Modern variant, but also to propose some openings and to
suggest a name for them -- the winning name and the name of the person
suggesting appear along with every opening.

About the Camembert, Greg Nelson remarks, "I'm not so sure that this is a
neutral opening, as your blatant greed will probably make enemies of
everyone. Tactically, though, it's not a bad play."

Greg Nelson comments that "by trading the support (of Marseilles for
the attack on Alsace or Switzerland) for A Mar-Mon, you can guarantee
Monaco."

Greg Nelson maintains that "this opening defends your borders and takes
Monaco. This is good if you are still sounding out the diplomatic situation."

</tt></blockquote>
Stephen Breininger feels that "this will cause Spain all sorts of problems.
The Spanish fleet which probably left Barcelona in the spring will have to
return, in order to protect its home base.  If Spain moved an army into
Portugal, it will be
pinned down for a while.  In the Fall, you could possible move either
F&#160;NAV-POR and A&#160;AUV-BAR or go for positioning with
F&#160;NAV-MID
and A&#160;AUV-NAV. During the winter, use your two builds for a fleet
in Marseilles and an army in Bordeaux.  By causing Spain such grief, the
English fleet from Gibraltar will probably survive and should be able to
help you out."
<P>
Greg Nelson thinks that "this move is probably the best anti-Spanish
deployment. Remember, you don't get much benefit out of an anti-Spain
campaign. You get Monaco,
either get Switzerland or at least keep Germany out of your hair, and
either keep Spain out or put pressure on Spain."

Michael Artz says, "My favored opening from my vast experience has been
what I call 'Cheese & Olives' Swiss Cheese & Spanish Olives."
<p>
Greg Nelson remarks that "this move is a bit more defensive against Germany.
I don't think this one is very good, as you give up Monaco."

Greg Nelson notes that "this puts all your guns against Spain and should
give you Navarra in the
fall. It's possible to cut a deal with the British player that might get
you Portugal, but don't count on it. France doesn't gain much by going
anti-Spain, but Britain will want you to, and an alliance with Britain is
great news for France in this game."

Says Stephen Breininger,
"Your army in Alsacia might be able to slip into Belgium or force its way
into Munich. But this plan might be moving too amny of your forces away
from Spain."
<P>
Greg Nelson notes that "this keeps Germany out of Alsace and will almost
always take Switzerland. If you make both
Alsace and Switzerland, you threaten Munich. A Mar can pick up Monaco in
the fall unless Italy orders A Mil-Pie."
<p>
Robert Shepard says, "I like this opening the best. It provides a good
balance of offensive and
defensive positioning, and doesn't commit you to war with any other power
(and) it gives France an almost sure bet of taking Switzerland.

Greg Nelson says, "This opening puts all your troops on the front line
right away but gives up any hope of picking up Monaco. Only use this if
you can surprise the German and get Munich from him."
<P>
Erik Stensland describes the variant:
"Move Marseilles to Switzerland to either bounce Italy and Germany out or
setup a take of Munich. Move Paris to Picardy to position yourself against
Germany. Move Lyon to Alsace to help take Munich or Belgium, if the move
works. Move Bordeaux to Navarra to show Britain that you want an alliance."

Greg Nelson says, "This opening can really get Italy in the shorts. Almost
always, Italy's
fleets and armies move away from Milan. You take Switzerland, and can
support yourself into Milan in the fall. Monaco can be picked up in 1996.

<H3>Strategy for France in Modern Games</H3>
France is one of the toughest powers to play in the Modern variant. It
starts out the game with four neighbours -- Italy, Germany, Britain and
Spain -- and must form many alliances if it is to survive. This is hard
enough in a press game, but can be very difficult if press is removed.
Furthermore, although France starts with four units, one of these units is
a fleet in Bordeaux, which is almost useless in the first year or two.
<P>
The first decision France faces is its initial choice of target.  Here
there are several schools of thought. France has a similar position with
regards to Spain as Austria has with Turkey in the standard game. Neither
can really attack the other right away and do much damage, yet unless Spain
is handled carefully, he will come charging into France a few years down
the road.  France has a better chance of going after Germany in the first
year by moving to take Switzerland and possibly even Munich or Belgium. The
same goes with Italy and Switzerland, from which France can sneak into
Milan or launch a supported attack if she moved to Piedmont. So perhaps the
question boils down to, when should France handle Spain?
<P>
One reason for attacking Spain right away is that your main ally against
Spain, Britain, will probably not be around Spain very long unless you help
out. If you want British help you should therefore send at least some
forces towards Spain to slow Spain down and then take Monaco and hopefully
Switzerland, build a fleet in Marseilles and then get Britain to send a
second fleet southwards. The problem with taking on Spain in the first year
however, is that for France to use any force at all, she exposes her back
to Germany for a few years and will not get very far.
<P>
Peace with Germany is therefore of utmost importance for an early attack
on Spain. The easiest way to achieve this is to get someone else to attack
Germany or vice versa. Poland is the first choice here, but will probably
be busy with Russia and Urkaine. It may be easier to get Germany to move
eastwards against Poland, but don't count on it, especially in no-press
games. Germany and Britain, on the other hand, are natural enemies, and
could easily fight over the lowlands and Scandinavia for quite a while.
However, Britain will want you to help out against Germany if you are
attacking Spain together, and you will face a tough land battle in
northeastern France.  At this time, the temptation is probably too great
for Italy and he will move west and try taking Marseilles and Monaco and
that will be your downfall.
<P>
Another option for dealing with Spain is to wait a few years and help out
Britain against Germany. Britain doesn't start with any armies, and so will
have a hard time capturing Frankfurt and Munich. If you manage to take out
Germany quickly, you should be able to stop with a nice demilitarized zone
between you and Poland. You might then be able to turn around fast enough
and attack Spain together. Britain will almost always want Gibraltar back,
so he should be wililng to do this, but at this point Spain should have
captured Gibraltar and Morocco and be quite a tough nut to crack. Still, a
concerted effort by you and Britain to take Spain out should succeed in
about 3 years. You will need a lot of forces to take Spain though, so this
means exposing yourself to an Italian attack.
<P>
Peace with Italy is therefore the key when attacking Spain in the middle
years after Germany is gone.  Now the game position may finally help you
though, since Italy will probably have expanded eastwards into the Balkans
and either Egypt, Turkey or Ukraine should now turn on Italy and keep them
busy. Still, if Italy wants to get involved in the west, he can probably
keep them busy for a while just holding his position in the Eastern Med and
then move west in force. If this happens, you should try getting Italy to
go after Morocco by land. An army in Morocco should be of no threat to you
and means one less unit for Spain. Perhaps it's even worth it to ask Egypt
to do this if he has had early success against Italy in Africa.
<P>
A third option for dealing with Spain is to first take out Italy. Even
though Italy has many centers nearby, it is possible to coordinate with
Germany and take Switzerland and Milan in the first year while Germany
takes Austria. If Germany keeps on helping you, he could move some land
forces southwards to Venice while you move on and take Rome and Naples. At
this point you should have about 3 fleets in the Mediterranean while Spain
has taken out Britain in the south. Your ally Germany should also be
attacking Britain, which at least is consistent with your interests.
<P>
The key to success when you turn on Spain now is timing because you will
still need 2 to 3 years uninterrupted to take out Spain. If Britain falls
easily against Germany, you may face a German attack, though if you have
been a good ally he may turn east. Unfortunately, to take Britain, he
probably needed a few fleets and there is not much use for them in attack
inland in Poland or Russia. Perhaps the best thing is to have cooperated a
bit on attacking Britain, though it is hard to see how you would have done
that with your lack of resources. Also, if a major power in the east has
emerged by now, you could easily find your recently captured centers in
Italy under attack. This is more likely if Egypt has won the battle and a
bit less likely if Turkey has, but again, with all the fleets he would have
built to take out Egypt, he probably would be best positioned to move west
rather than north against the Ukraine or Russia.
<P>
All this may come to make you wonder -- can France realistically ally with
Spain? I believe the answer to this question is yes, provided you establish
a few ground rules and keep an eye on your back. Spain can either go north
against Britain or east against Italy and Egypt. If you believe it is best
that Spain move northwards, Spain may also need a bit of convincing because
your centers will be closer than Britain's to take, so perhaps you can
offer Bordeaux up? It is not a very useful port with Spain around, and you
could therefore stop worrying about your Atlantic coast. The only thing you
should worry about is Auvergne, because it borders all of your home
centers. I would either insist on being allowed to keep an army there at
all times, or have a DMZ in Navarra and Barcelona and only allow Spain to
have a fleet in Bordeaux. With Spain as an ally moving against Britain, you
should breathe a sigh of relief and move against Italy, because at least
one of you has to protect your front in the Mediterranean.
<P>
If on the other hand you want Spain to move eastwards, Tunisia and Libya
are not that far away and you could offer him ground support in the north
against Italy. Again you should be concerned about Auvergne as outlined
above. Your defense against Spain centers around Auvergne and if it is
gone, you are almost guaranteed to fall. In this case, however, it may be
possible to station a fleet of yours in the Mid-Atlantic. This should
prevent Spain from surrounding you, and you could say that you are also
defending him against Britain.
<P>
Finally, you might ask, what about attacking Britain? I think the general
consensus is that with Germany, Italy and Spain breathing down your neck,
with Britain begging to help you against two of these, and with your
starting positions in Modern preventing you from even reaching each other's
home supply centers in the first year, that such an attack would be
ludicrous. Still, if you wish to attack Britain, the best avenue would be
to ally with Germany and take Belgium in the first year. You could also
move your fleet north to the Channel or to the Mid-Atlantic? From there, I
wish you the best of luck!
<H3>Initial Tactics for France in Modern</H3>
Now that you have chosen your overall strategy for playing France, it is
time to look at your initial tactics. The moves for France boil down to a
few simple things. What to do with your fleet in Bordeaux? Should you move
to Alsace to keep Germany out? Should you support yourself into
Switzerland? And can you wait to take Monaco?
<P>
The fleet in Bordeaux is not very useful in the first year, or even
after. If you are going to attack Spain in the early or middle years, then
you should help Britain to stay alive in Gibraltar or Morocco as long as
possible. This means moving to Navarra for a stab at Portugal or a move on
to the Mid-Atlantic. If you are sending an army south as well, possibly to
the Bay of Biscay and supporting the army into Navarra.
<P>
On the other hand, if you are not attacking Spain, then you should
probably just keep the fleet in Bordeaux or around Bordeaux so you can
defend it. This is more or less the only use of the fleet. This is why you
might want to consider giving up Bordeaux to Spain to get him to move
northwards.
<P>
The next question is whether to move to Alsace in the first year.  This
is very similar to the question of whether you should move to Burgundy in
standard dip. If you are attacking Germany you should definitely move
there, otherwise, the move is a defensive one, but may irritate Germany
enough to attack you. The most likely unit to move there is the one in
Paris which can also move to Auvergne. The move to Auvergne is probably the
strongest you can make against Spain, because he must then move back to
Barcelona to cover it, and probably loses a build.  However, if Germany
moves to Alsace, he will border Paris, Lyon and Switzerland, so you will
probably have to go on your gut feeling on this one.
<P>
The last two questions are tied together. If you support yourself into
Switzerland, you will be waiting to take Monaco at least until the fall.
You must decide how important Switzerland is to you. It will be quite hard
for you to hold if Germany and Italy are allied. However, it does border
two of your home centers, and if either Italy or Germany holds it, they
will be able to attack you much more easily and may be quite tempted to do
so. If you wait until the fall to take Monaco however, there is a small
chance that Italy will move to Piedmont and keep you from getting it.
Generally, I think it is worth the risk. The only time I would not support
myself into Switzerland would be if I thought I would get in unnopposed and
I wanted to move to Piedmont myself from Marseilles, either to block Italy
or to be able to take Milan in the fall. It is questionable however whether
giving up Monaco for Milan is worth it. It would be better to sneak into
Milan from Switzerland in the fall, move into Switzerland from Alsace and
take Monaco from Marseilles.
<P>
Finally, in addition to Auvergne, Alsace and Piedmont, the Ligurian Sea
is an important spot to defend for France as it borders both Marseilles and
Monaco. This means keeping it free of Italian fleets. Probably the best way
of doing this is by building your own fleet and stationing it in the area.
It may not be necessary to put it there, especially since it also borders
Rome and may antagonize Italy, but having a fleet in the Gulf of Lyon would
both help against Spain and serve as some deterrent against Italy.
<H3>Allies for France in Modern</H3>
Who should you ally with as France in Modern? As I stated in the
strategy section, Britain is a good choice for an early attack on Germany
or Spain. It is probably also the easiest power to convince to be your
ally. For an early attack on Italy, Germany is probably the best ally,
though Egypt may well want to help out.  Other non-neighbouring allies you
might want to consider talking to early on are Poland, Egypt and Turkey. If
you can get any of these to attack Germany or Italy early in the game, your
position will be much much better, as you will have more time to deal with
Spain without worrying about these two.
<P>
France does have an advantage in that once you get large enough, you can
attack both in the Mediterranean or the Atlantic, and still can build
armies close to the action. For this reason, France should also entertain a
relationship with a strong power in the east. This could be either Russia
or Ukraine. I feel that Russia is probably the best ally for France at that
point in the game, because it too will have navies both north and south,
and together you have a good chance of crushing any resistance. I also have
a feeling that the fates of Russia and France are somehow linked, because
all the games that France has done well in until now, so has Russia and
vice-versa. This remains to be proven though!
<P>
As a closing statement, I think one must say that to play France in
Modern requires a very good diplomat and a brilliant tactician. My hat is
off to whoever can pull off a solo victory as France!
<P>
<H3>Player Comments on France in General</H3>
Says Stephen Breininger: "France, Humph! This is a tough one!
If Italy and Germany both gang up on you, then your sunk! You will be
fighting 3 countries (Spain will be quick to jump in).  At least your
misery will not last too long."
<P>
Rick Desper comments: "At this time, many Modern games have been played.
Most have ended in
disaster for France.  The common themes to these early disasters?  War with
Italy or Germany."
<P>
Toby Tyrell feels that "playing France in the Modern variant can be summarised
as follows: 'don't
do it!' Perhaps a good diplomat will be able to make a go of it with a
weak-minded Spain, but if you are playing NoPress then don't choose
France!"
<H3>Player Comments on French Strategy</H3>
Stephen Breininger notes that
"the temptation is to head east (that is where the available supply centers
are located. But
France has to prepare for a battle with Spain!"

Says Rick Desper, "I think the key to France is going anti-Spanish, and not
getting caught up in a stupid war with Germany or Italy.
France cannot grow quickly like many other powers can (Italy, Ukraine,
Turkey, Russia, Egypt) and it doesn't have the defensive strengths of some
others (Egypt, Britain, Spain.)  However, it has a nice central location,
and it does have ports on both sides of the Med -- which makes it unique in
the Modern variant. (Correction: Russia also has a Southern port, but it
often loses it to either the Ukraine or Turkey, since it is so remote from
the other Russian home SC's.)  I would suggest playing France as a
balance-of-power country.  The exception is the foreign policy toward
Spain.  A strong Spain will always be a threat to France.  Britain and
Italy both make good secondary targets for France.  You would think France
would be a strong endgame country.  There do not appear to be easily held
anti-French stalemate lines."
<P>
Simon Withers claims that "because of France's inability to attack Spain
effectively, the best she
could really hope for is A&#160;Auv, A&#160;Nav, F&#160;Por with the support
of an English
F&#160;SAO, and that's hoping for quite a bit, France should keep an eye on the
Spaniard while moving on Italy or Germany.  Again, any move toward England
in the first move is going to be so utterly weak, it's not worth bothering
with."
<P>
Erik Stensland's strategy is
"based on Position.  Position, Position, Position!!! I love
to move towards an opponent, rather than take a simple SC. The most
important thing, I think, is to get position on Germany and destroy Spain
quickly."
<H3>Player Comments on the Fleet in Bordeaux</H3>
Stephen Breininger says that "the fleet in Bordeaux is almost useless!"
<P>
Rick Desper "would hazard a guess that Bor-Bis is the most common move for that
force (but) it would seem that the fleet's move is not quite so important
as the actions around Switzerland."
<P>
Says Greg Nelson,
"the fleet in Bordeaux doesn't have much to do in 1995. You can sail it to
Navarra if you are anti-Spain, or to Brittany if you are anti-England, but
most people will just put it to sea in the Bay of Biscay."
<P>
Robert Shepard notes that "France has a tough time maintaining a fleet in
the north at first, so it
seems best not to try. France can constantly remind Britian that he is not
building northern fleets to encourage a British alliance (not to mention
the fact that the Spanish are likely to take Gibraltar)."
<H3>Player Comments on Switzerland</H3>
Stephen Breininger offers: "Strike a deal with Italy, he goes after
Austria and you go after Switzerland."
<P>
Rick Desper concurs: "I recommend securing Switzerland. Any neutral SC
which borders two home
SC's must be controlled by the owner of said home SC's.  The good news is
that Switzerland should be French at the end of the first year unless
Germany and Italy are totally in synch in an anti-French campaign."
<P>
Robert Shepard thinks likewise.  "Taking Switzerland seems important
since Italy and Germany will want to go
different ways, neither of these two would want the other to have it.
Three way negotiations here can often be fruitful."
<P>
However, Toby Tyrell notes that "Germany and Italy can get into squabbles
with France over Switzerland."
<H3>Player Comments on the Mediterranean and France</H3>
Rick Desper offers "another piece of advice: build F&#160;Marseilles the
first year. The
Mediterranean is far too important for France to forego all influence on
it. F&#160;Mar is useful in influencing Italy and Spain, and provides a measure
of protection for Monaco and Marseilles."
<H3>Player Comments on French Allies</H3>
<dl>
<dt><H4>England</H4>
<dd>Erik Stensland thinks that
"England is your greatest ally. You must show England that you want NO part
of a Sea battle.  Let him go after Italy, while you clean house on land.
Your ally in the East is Poland.  She can do wonders for your growth. She
not only can keep Germany busy put she also can keep England from growing
too big. Then there is Egypt; she will help you deal with Italy when the
time comes."
<P>
Rick Desper is in agreement: "Britain is the natural choice.  Britain
starts out entangled with Spain,
and has basically no good avenues to attack France. Unless Britain wants to
go North and abandon the MAO, B/F is a natural alliance."
<dt><H4>Spain</H4>
<dd>
Robert Shepard outlines a choice.  "Either peace with or the rapid
elimination of Spain is the first priority
of France. Nevertheless, Spain as a long term ally can be problematic."
<P>
Rick Desper also cautions against a Spanish alliance.  "Dippers from the
Standard game might feel that France's two major worries
are Britain and Germany.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  (Well,
ok, it would be further from to truth to say 'France's two major enemies
are Egypt and the Ukraine, but I digress.')   What typically happens is
France gets jammed fighting for Belgium or Switzerland while Spain
methodically takes Gibraltar and Morocco, only to then turn on France in
full force.  If France waits until Spain has six SC's and the big momentum,
France is meat.
If B/F are coordinated the first year, they can keep Spain to one build.
Try Par-Auv-Bar, combined with Bor-Nav and Gib-SAO. This gives the
option of an attack on Portugal with two forces or a landing in Morocco.
Also, Britain can easily bring at least one more fleet South in the first
or second year.  Once the alliance has two British fleets, two French
fleets, and two French armies, it is just a matter of time before Spain
collapses."
<P>
Toby Tyrell, too, notes that Spain is a problem for France.  "In all of
the Modern games I am involved in France is having a rough ride,
and it is easy to see why.  Where else is Spain going to go? Spain's
natural, and almost inevitable, route to expansion is to come through
France, and since Spain has little else to worry about this means trouble
for France."
<P>
Michael Artz also agrees.
"One thing I have determined is that Spain & France do not mix. One will
eventually have to confront the other, much as Italy/Turkey in the regular
game."
<P>
On the downside, Simon Withers notes that "France cannot attack Spain with
much force in 1995, even with British help."
<dt><H4>Italy</H4>
<dd>Stephen Breininger's feelings are that
"usually Germany & England will fight it out over the lowlands (BEL, HOL, &
DEN). Spain will probably be attacking you in the 2nd or 3rd year. Italy is
the wildcard!  If you go to war with him, you will be fighting on 2 fronts.
This will probably be your ruin.  My strategy would be to form an alliance
with Italy."
<P>
Erik Stensland's feeling is that
"Italy has <strong>too</strong> much growth potential to the
<strong>east</strong> to worry about you. So
Italy will leave you alone as long as he sees that you are going after
Germany and Spain.  Which are also 2 of his biggest enemies."
<P>
Rick Desper calls peace with Italy "essential for a number of reasons.
It is rare that
France can get further with an early anti-Italian attack than capture of
Milan.  If Italy collapses early, you'll likely Turkey or Ukraine or Egypt
get huge fast, depending upon how the Balkans are going.  I have seen one
game where France managed to take out Italy by himself, but I would
characterize that Italy's play as unusually below average."
<dt><H4>Germany</H4>
<dd>
Rick Desper advises for alliance with Germany, saying,
"War with Germany?  Put it right out of your mind. It's not even worth
fighting for Belgium. It is likely that Germany will be more preoccupied
with Britain and/or Poland.  If you can buy peace with the sacrifice of
Belgium, it is worth the cost.  After all, Belgium is much closer to
natural German SC's than French SC's.  But -- if you do let Germany take
Belgium, don't let him into Alsace!"
<P>
However, Erik Stensland notes that "in Modern, Germany really can not grow to
the East so he must come after France."
