<H3>Italy's End of Game Statement</H3>

I'll try and keep this reasonably brief, partly because I can't
remember very much about the early game.
<P>
I got off to a great start with Italy, getting four builds in the first
year, and doing well in the Balkans.  I purposefully intended to push
strongly towards the Balkans since there is such a concentration of
centres there.  As far as I remember, the next step was to take
advantage of the war between Germany and France to take Monaco,
Marseilles and then further.
<P>
For most of the game I had an intense running battle with Egypt, who
was the biggest thorn in my side all game.  On a couple of occasions I
fought a defensive retreat because I needed units elsewhere, but then
once I had surplus units later on I was able to force my way into
control of most of the Med.  Well played Egypt!
<P>
Egypt and Ukraine formed a solid alliance early on and I think it was
sensible for the two of you not to break it at all.  I was hoping that
one of you would stab the other but it never came.  Ukraine - I think
your big mistake early on was to get a fleet into Rumania and then even
worse to keep it there for several years.  Your attacking options into
the Balkans were always severely limited because of that, and it meant
I could hold onto my Balkan centres for several years with only a
threadbare defense.  Generally I thought you played too defensively,
and passed up chances to attack because you would have to run a small
risk of losing a sector in order to do so.  But generally well played.
<P>
I had an excellent alliance with Poland for a large slice of the game,
but the inevitable had to happen, and I stabbed him as he started to
get too big.  At the time I wasn't quite sure whether it was the best
thing to do to stab such a good ally, but it turned out to work OK.  I
got a lot of centres from it in the short term, and I predicted rightly
that he and Britain wouldn't be able to reconcile their differences and
form a united front against me.
<P>
Britain: I hope you won't take this too personally, but I think you
must be relatively new to diplomacy because you made a lot of wrong
decisions in the game.  Probably the best move you made was to get your
fleet in behind my lines (which gave me a real headache!) but then you
let it get trapped and disbanded too easily in Monaco.  I was very weak
in the west med for some years and you could have torn me to shreds
there if you had been a bit more bold with your moves and had been
prepared to take a small risk of me breaching your lines in order to
certainly breach mine.  In the middle part of the game I was prepared
to temporarily cede ground to you because I thought I would always be
able to get it back again later.
<P>
To summarise, I think I was just lucky at the beginning, but I managed
to hold on to that lead and convert it into a win by a good stab on
Poland, and by keeping any other nations (especially the more
experienced/skillful ones!) from getting too big.  I pursued a variant
of the divide-and-conquer routine.  It's much easier to attack two
nations each with 5 units than one nation of 10 units, because
coordination amongst allies is so hard in no-press.
<P>
Well that's my lot.  I apologise for my over-indulgence in gratuitous
and patronising advice and criticism but perhaps the winner of the game
is allowed to do a little of that.  Many thanks to all the other
players and to Rick the GM for keeping the game moving so fast - I
think it has been the most rapid game I have played in over the last
couple of years, and the most enjoyable.
<P>

<H3>Spain's End of Game Statement</H3>

  First I'd like to congratulate Toby for his solo-win. This is only the
second solo win in an no-NMR game, the first being last week with Turkey
winning in liarliar. Seville is also the second ever modern game created,
the first being euro94 which is currently stalled on USCA.
<P>
  Anyhow, my analysis will concentrate on the start of the game, because I
didn't last until the end. The game started with me making a severe blunder
and letting France move into Barcelona in the spring, thinking I could take
it back quickly. This led to quite an involvement for France in Spain in
the first few years, while I fought Britain for Gibraltar and Morocco, but
I finally managed to push France out of Iberia (to Morocco) in 1999.
<P>
  At this point, Italy was at 15 centers and Britain at 11, while France
was down to 3 due to an Italian attack (which contributed to my pushing
France out). Stuck between two great powers, I thought I should form an
alliance with Britain to push back Italy from the Med. Britain still had
Gibraltar, and he quickly captured Morocco. I thought he would see my
usefulness and eagerness to work with him (through convoy orders or support
for his units).
<P>
  Unfortunately, he got greedy and tried taking some of my centers. This
eventually brought my downfall (I lasted with a single army in Madrid two
years, making it to the end of 2007, quite an accomplishment, I think).
Britain was unable to build in Gibraltar, however, since he needed to
occupy it to hold back the Italians, and had no armies in Iberia, so once
Madrid had fallen (to two Italian armies), Italy was able to take control
of the whole Iberian peninsula quite easily, taking all but Portugal within
two years...
<P>
  As creator of the variant, I am quite happy to see that it has taken off
as it has, and that we have been able to achieve solo-wins, rather than
draws, in most games (3 vs 1 for all games, 2 vs 0 for no-NMR).
<P>
  Congratulation once again to Toby!
<P>
  Cheers,
<P>

<H3>Poland's End of Game Statement</H3>


When I joined the game, my position was very bad, despite having 8 or 9
SC's.  My units were dispersed from thh middle of Germany where I was
getting sandwitched by Britan and Italy, thruogh Poland where Italy was
pushing into my homeland, into the Ukraine, where I was too weak to
resist any kind of counter attack.
<P>
I resolved to try to gather my forces in Poland if at all possible,
hasten the colapse of Russia, Egypt needed the builds to defend against
Italy, and try to let Britan take my German centers rather than Italy.
<P>
From my perspective my effect on the game soon boiled down to "block Italy
while trying to help Britan do the same" so I payed less attention to the
game than I would have had there been some action ...
<P>
Of the end game play, Italys was quite good, as was the Ukraine, but
Egypt and Britain ???? What were you guys doing in Scandinavia ?  Egypt
already had more units than you needed to stalemate Italy, and there was
no way you could push the Italian line back, while Britan, if he had 2
more fleets could have had a fair chance of stopping Italy.
<P>
Anyway, congratulations to Toby for the win, and thanks to Vince for the
variant, and to the GM and players for the game :)

<H3>Britain's End of Game Statement</H3>

        As Toby rightly guessed in his EOG, I'm fairly new to Diplomacy, so
some of my 'strategy' may have been a bit nieve. Upon joining the game, I
quickly got bogged down in Spain. I wanted to consolidate there before
moving into the Med, but I was never going to achieve that without an army
in the area, and I could never seem to free one up from NW Europe, where I
really wanted to secure a solid group of SC's, but never did. C'est la vie.
Italy's win seemed fairly inevitable with a few turns to run, so I was
planning to at least blockade any advances into the Atlantic, but, as Simon
(Poland) pointed out, a couple of my fleets got tangled up in Scandanavia
when that rogue Egyptian army wandered in through the laplands, also 
forcing
me to make some reckless moves in NW Europe in the remote (shall we say
non-existent) chance the Toby made a mistake.
<P>
Anyway, thanks for the game, it's been a good learning experience for me, I
hope my skills have been honed, and I'll get you all next time.
<P>
Cheers,
<P>

<H3>Ukraine's End of Game Statement</H3>

Congratulations to Italy on the win and a game well played.  This game
was difficult for me on a number of counts:
<P>
<ol>
<li>It was the the first Modern variant I've ever tried, so there was a
learning curve.
<li>As a new variant, it is not supported by my software map generator,
forcing me to do maps by hand and showing me just how dependent I have
become on technology.

<li>This is the first no-press game I've ever played which I 
feltsignificantly hampered by not having access to player-to-player
communication.

<li>A cranky email server.
</ol>
Throughout the game I was very thankful for getting the Ukraine as a
power.  Although I had Russia and Turkey bordering me at the outset, they
never were able to work in concert with each other and I was able to
pillage Turkish positions with Egypt, contain Russia and expand into the
Balkans.  Although my early expansion was glorious, cooperation between
Poland, Russia and Italy against me proved to be my undoing.  I was
always trying to put out some emergency somewhere and wasn't able to get
an advantage until late in the game when Italy stabbed Poland and
eliminated that threat.  From there, Egypt and I were able to make gains
against Russia, but it was too late.
<p>
In the Balkans, I believe it was Italy who said that it was a mistake to
leave my fleet in RUM, and I agree, but I never really felt I had an
opportunity to do so without endangering my position.  Then again, I
don't like to trade pieces in chess either.  It was with all the mishaps
in the Balkans that I really longed for standard communication with
Egypt.  Between mis-assumptions between us and my sometimes faulty
mapmaking, I made some serious blunders in orders that had me kicking
myself.  Even when I would switch up an attack strategy on my to try and
catch Italy off-guard, Italy usually anticipated the move and I could
never get the lucky breakthrough I needed.
<P>
Throughout I was pleased with the strong relationship with Egypt andhappy 
that both of us recognized the value of remaining steadfastly loyal
to each other against Italian ambitions.  This was a great game which I
enjoyed playing very much.
