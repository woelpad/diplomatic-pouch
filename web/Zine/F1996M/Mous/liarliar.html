<H3>Turkey's End of Game Statement</H3>
<dl>
<dt><strong>The Humble Beginning</strong>
<dd>
I knew right off that the 4 countries I should concern myself most with
were
Ukraine, Russia, Egypt and Italy.  (It is great to see in hindsight that
they are all dead).  At any rate, my initial attention went to the Black
Sea.  Having 3 countries was definitely one two many.  I had originally
thought I would ally with Ukraine and we would eliminate the Russian
presence in the south, then Ukraine could go north and I south.  Howver,
Ukraine right away took over bulgaria.  Wanting to avoid a Russo-Ukraine
alliance, I threw everything I could into turning around my rough
negotiations of Geogria and making peace with Russia.  As this developed,
by
southern strategy was to stall.  I promised Egypt I would help him attack
Italy, and I promised Italy I would help him attack Egypt.  This worked
better than I could have hoped and allowed me to focus my full attention
against Ukraine.
<p>
<dt><strong>The First Backstab</strong>
<dd>
As Russia and I ganged up on Ukraine, Poland moved East to attack Russia.
So it was Russia and I attacking Ukraine and Poland and Ukraine attacking
Russia, with both Poland and I each being attacked by only one power.
Poland and I both realized our superior positions, and so we maximized our
gains by sharing information.  By the end of the second year, Poland was
telling me everything about Ukraine, and I was telling Poland everything
about Russia.  Ukraine and Russia never suspected anything until the very
end, and both Poland and I reaped tremendous benefits from the deal.  Thus
the northern and southern giants were born.
<P>
<dt><strong>The Second Backstab</strong>
<dd>
Just as I was mopping up the remains of Ukraine and Russia, it came time to
make a decision between stabbing Egypt or Italy.  I could stall no longer.
Italy and I had already coordinated a bit against Ukraine, and he was
silling to show more trust in me that Egpyt.  On the other hand, Egpyt
seemed like a very skilled player, and we agreed on many points
ideologically.  In the end, a big part of the decision was long term
strategy.  If I stabbed Italy, I would always have to trust Poland to my
north and Egpyt to my south while pushing westward.  If I stabbed Egypt, I
could then move westward while only having to trust Poland.  Since I knew
then that I would ultimately attack them both, Egpyt seemed like the better
first candidate.  In hindsight, this was a great decision.
<p>
<dt><strong>The Third Backstab</strong>
<dd>
At this point my alliance with Poland is solid, but the British were smart
enough to block him in.  I knew I would successfully stab Italy, and so I
was glad to see Poland become stagnate at no fault of my own.  This gave me
a few years of growth while he simply held.  It was at this point I knew I
would stab Poland.  But before that, as Egypt is reduced to his last few, I
make the move on Italy.  Egypt saw my intentions a few years early and
tried
to warn Italy, but through a lot of messages and constantly repeated a few
basic arguements, I convinced Italy to help me attack Egpyt just long
enough.  The Spanish move into Rome also helped this out, since Italy
didn't
want to shift alliances with a new threat in the West.  Italy immediately
regretted trusting me, allied with Egpyt, and the two bet on who would live
the longest.  I could have let Egpyt win the bet, but felt bad for Italy
since my stab of him seemed particularly brutal to me.
<p>
<dt><strong>A Nervous Moment</strong>
<dd>
At this point I am feeling really good about my situation.  I am picking
off
the last of the Egyptian and Italian centers, and the British, Spanish and
French are still fighting each other, posing no resistence to me what so
ever.  Poland was still stalemated, so I knew I could easily continue to
expand in the West without any of my armies, and could use them all to try
and make gains against Poland.  A nervous point came however, because I
needed two years to reorganize my units, subtley position them for an
attack
against Poland and finish off the Egyptians and Italians.  However, the
Egyptian did not want to die!  He made the movement for a draw between
Poland and I.  A draw?  I didn't want to draw, I was about to crush my last
ally and become ruler of the world.  If everyone supported the draw but me,
Poland would know my intentions and might organize better defensive
positions.  I even blew it by over-reacting to a few Egyptian taunts.  Then
their was the French disaster where my communications with Britain and the
new French player were exposed.  All in all, a very nervous moment.
<p>
<dt><strong>The Fourth and Final Backstab</strong>
<dd>
This fourth stab of Poland was my most masterminded stab yet.  Even early
on
I saw the advantages of Poland and I communicating to each other about
Ukraine and Russia, so I made an effort to make Britain a friend, and give
him all the information I could.  I don't know if I told him anything he
didn't already know in those early years, but towards midgame, he was all
for me stabbing Poland.  In fact, I was not doing it soon enough for him.
As his line against Poland began to weaken, he told me he was going to vote
for the draw.  This was the final imputes to get me to stab Poland.  It was
now or never, so I made it now.  Then the judge never sent a response.  I
waited, and waited and waited.  I send my orders in, and never even got the
confirmation of them.  This was when the judge had the hiccups.  When the
turn finally did process, I was releived to see Poland had not expected it.
I was confident at this point of my eventual victory, since Britain and
France both seemed eager to help.  Spain wanted to help too, but I either
had to attack France or Spain, and while France had made a potentially
costly mistake, I had a weird vibe from Spain since he never said or did
much during the game.
<p>
<dt><strong>The German Question</strong>
<dd>
I did not say anything in advance to Germany of my plan to stab Poland,
since I felt like he would warn Poland right away.  Luckily, Poland stabbed
Germany at just the right time, and so Germany was all too eager to help me
fight against Poland.  I still didn't trust Germany, since if Poland wanted
to stab Germany, he could have done a more through job that first turn, so
I
thought Germany gave Poland Berlin in exchange for all the help over the
years.  I devised a master plan whereby I told Germany under no
circumstances should he move an army into Alsacia, because that units
support was crucial for a grand master plan to succeed.  In reality, it
didn't matter if Germany moved there, but this was a test for him.  He
passed, and so from that point forward I tried to do all I could to help
him.  Unfortunately, this was not much.  If it makes any difference, I hope
he survives the game.
<p>
<dt><strong>My Final Question</strong>
<dd>
The one thing that really amazed me during the game (other than Egpyt's
resolve to make my life miserable) was why Poland didn't make peace with
Germany right away, or make more of an effort to coordinate things against
me.  To be fair, maybe Poland did do this, I am not sure how much press he
sent out.  I just figure that if I was being attacked by the biggest player
of the bard, I would do anything and everything to make peace with others.
I would have immediately apologized to Germany and pulled out of Berlin,
and
continued to support him against the British.  I also would have pulled
back
more troops from my north.  I would have left the minimum necessary to
ensure defense, and swing everything else against Turkey.  He swung some,
but I remember wondering why he didn't swing more.  France Germany and
Spain
obviously were not going to win the game, but I felt I was able to make
great use of them in securing my victory and achieving it more quickly.
<p>
<dt><strong>Ending</strong>
<dd>
OK, so I know the game is not officially over yet, but at this point I
suppose I have earned a little arrogance.  This was my first Internet
Diplomacy game that I signed up for, so I feel greatly honored to have won.
I thank all the players for playing.  I had a lot of fun and slowly
conquering the world made my second year of law school tolerable.  I look
forward to playing with you all again.
</dl>
<p>
P.S.  While I was not responsible for any of the early news reports that
came out the first few years, I was the writer of the liarliar times.  I
found it odd that all the other publications faded away, as I felt once I
started using it, is was a great tool of propaganda.  I also need to give
some credit to good old fashion luck.  Sometimes the decisions others made
which I know I did not influence just happened to work out for my benefit.

O.K., now for those last five centers!

<H3>Egypt's End of Game Statement</H3>
First of all, congratulations to Robert Shepard for his win. For the
record, this is the first solo win ever in a No-NMR modern game. The fact
that the win requirements were higher than normal means his win is not the
first ever, but since the other was an NMR game, I think we can discount
it. (Seville finished soon after in an Italian solo win, btw).
<p>
My alliance choices were colored a bit by the fact that I wanted to prove
to myself that Egypt could ally with Turkey and attack Italy as a viable
choice in the first years. I thought that an ET alliance would give Turkey
the advantages of Egypt's corner defensibility and they could easily go
quite far in the game.
<p>
Therefore, with this in mind, I moved westwards quite quickly. I managed
to grab Libya and Naples in 1997. This was my high point and lasted for all
of 1998. Unfortunately, Turkey stabbed me at the end of that year and
forced me to pull out of Italy. This was too bad, because I would have
stuck with the alliance much longer. I even had helped him against Ukraine
by lying to him about attacking Turkey at one point. The reason I didn't
seem to trust Turkey so much was because of all those fleets he was
building...
<p>
I thought I had patched things up with Italy, but he refused to listen to
my arguments and forced my downfall. His came but one year later. If he had
listened, we could have set up an almost impregnable defense against Turkey
while the rest of the west built up their capability against Poland, but
this was not to be. (asw s cai, ale s lbn, an Italian fleet in Maltese Sea;
Libya had to be mine).
<p>
When Italy was stabbed, he quickly saw that it had all been a set-up and
we quickly managed to convince Spain to join us (he did talk to us, it was
France who was silent). We also tried to convince Britain to work with
Spain so France could be taken out and Spain could shore up Italy's defense
with some extra fleets, effectively stopping the growing Turkish threat.
<p>
Unfortunately, Britain said that Poland was his only concern and that
Turkey could grow as much as he wanted to, he didn't have to worry. Well,
that's true if you just want to survive in a game, but if you want to win,
you have to see the large picture. I can now see in Turkey's EOG that
Turkey had gotten to Britain even with his sweet words...
<p>
There were also several attempts to turn Poland against Turkey, or Turkey
against Poland. My main way of trying to break this alliance was to ask for
a draw. I knew that Poland wanted one, and Turkey was saying out loud that
he did, but if I could put enough doubt in Poland's mind that Turkey wanted
a win, maybe I could get him to turn around...
<p>
Well, this is it. I guess my experiment failed. However, there is a quite
advanced ET alliance in euro95 on this judge, and another in lyon, also on
this judge. Those are both nopress games though, so maybe that was the
difference?
<p>
One more thing: the reason that the Liarliar Times was the only thing
around at the end of the game was that I was the one producing most of the
alternative news... This didn't last too long after I was eliminated. I
guessed that the times were Turkey's tools, but since they were warning me
about a Turkish stab, I got a bit confused...
<p>
At least I made it to 2000!

Congratulations, Turkey. Seems you nailed me a tad more than I expected
at the end, but 'twas a fun & enjoyable game.
<p>
Britain.
<HR>
<H3>Germany's End of Game Statement</H3>
Thanks to all and a big congrats to Turkey.
<p>
Having picked up Germany in a sorry state I at least made it to the end
which was my aim.  Never really thought I had much chance being in the
middle of it as I found myself.
<p>
Summary?  OK.
<p>
France (both of them) never seemed to have much of a plan and wandered
aimlessly in his own country.  Too bad; had he diplomed a bit I think that
a valuable B/G/F alliance mght have happened.
<p>
Britain recovered from a big blunder earlier, but never got back into the
race.
<p>
Poland, well, what can we say about stabbing me that caused everyone else
to gang up.  Went from being a moderately strong power to an also-ran.
Timing...not!
<p>
Turkey played well and deserved the victory.  What can we say?
<p>
Spain...did Spain ever answer ANYONE'S email?
<p>
I didn't have anything to do with any other powers so I'll reserve
judgement.
<p>
Germany?  Well, I made a couple of blunders along the way, but that's
part of the fun.  As I said, I was glad to hang in there until the end.
without severely pissing anyone off.
<p>
Thank you all for participating without resigning and sulking.  It was a
good game with an interesting mid-game.  The Turk steamroller was
unstoppable, but that's Diplomacy.  See you in another game...but how
will we know? :-)
