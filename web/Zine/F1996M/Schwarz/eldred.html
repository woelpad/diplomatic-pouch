<H1 align=center>Defense Lines in Hundred</H1>
<H2 align=center><em>Charlie Eldred</em></H2>
<HR>
I have gained knowledge of Hundred defense lines quite by accident.  I
was a player in the Hundred games </I>Lancast</I> and <I>Troyes</I>, playing
England in both games.  At points in both games, France managed to control
eight SC's.  In an effort to deny France his 9th SC, I managed to discover
ways in which England and Burgundy could apparently hold off France
indefinitely and force a 3-way draw.  To me, it feels better to participate
in a 3-way draw than to outright lose, despite the fact that you get no
Hall of Fame points for a 3-way draw, just as you get no Hall of Fame
Points for a loss.  If you feel the same way, you may wish to try to find
other Hundred defense lines.<P>
<samp>Ed. Note: Charlie is an old-school player and sometimes
refers to provinces by the test version names.  Antwerp=Flanders,
Amsterdam=Holland, Plymouth=Devon, Aquitaine=Guyenne and Swabia=Lorraine.
Any other changes should be obvious.  --Andy</samp><P>
<H3>Why Defense Lines Form</H3>
The defense line in Lancast and Troyes formed because one power
went to eight SC's without being able to guarantee SC number nine.  When this
situation develops, the other two powers have the choice of banding
together or losing, since neither power can hold off the 8 SC power on
its own.
<P>
In several Hundred games, a power has won in 2 or 3 game years by
simply sweeping over the competition, which never united against the
eventual winner.  The danger of this "blitzkrieg" strategy is that the other
two powers will have more units than you, collectively, and, if they can
get their act together, can almost surely stop the "blitzkrieging" power.
<P>
This is very different than in Standard Diplomacy.  If a power in Standard
Diplomacy starts rolling towards 18 SC's, even if the remaining powers
unite against the power advancing towards victory, the large size of the
Standard board often prevents the smaller powers from getting their
forces together into a defense line, in contrast to the very compact and
crowded Hundred board.  Also, there is the difficulty of getting several
countries to band together in a Standard game, rather than just two as in
a Hundred game.
<P>
These factors combine into a lesson for Hundred players.  If you want to
make a run for 9 SC's, make sure that either (a) you can guarantee that
you will get 9 SC's; (b) you can convince your opponents that you have
9 SC's guaranteed, even if you don't, so that they won't bother to look for
a defense line (as in Andy Schwarz's victory in Formigny); or (c) your
opponents hate each other so much that they simply will not band
<A NAME="return">together</A>
against you (as in my victory in Arras).
You can <A HREF ="formigny.html">see how
Andy won Formigny</a> and <A HREF ="arras.html">how I won Arras.</a><P>
<Blockquote>(Actually, there is a fourth successful way to make a grab
for nine SC's -- simply go for broke and attack
everywhere on all fronts.  You might get lucky.  Jeff Carnegie used this
strategy to win in Fulton in Fall 1416, which is the quickest win so far
in a Hundred game).</Blockquote>
<P>
<H3>The Lancast Defense Line</H3>
I played England in <I>Lancast</I>.  After Fall 1415, I found myself with a
pathetic 3 units.  France was at 8 SC's, and Burgundy had taken Calais,
much to my chagrin.  Furthermore, Burgundy and I weren't talking
at all.  It was looking like an easy win for France, with no defense line
forming against him since Burgundy and I were at war.  I managed to survive
1416, although Burgundy grabbed Scotland, to my further chagrin.<P>
The Winter adjustments processed, and Burgundy built a second fleet,
which indicated that Burgundy would continue to come after me, since
when can Burgundy ever use a fleet against France?  I was just about
ready to throw in the towel when I realized that France had built 3 armies
and no fleets in Winter 1415.  This made me wonder if it were possible to
stop France, if I could get Burgundy to listen to me.<P>
Here was the position in Spring 1417:<P>

</samp>
As I examined the board, I slowly realized that a defense line was
already in place.  Burgundy and I could jointly hold our provinces forever,
by the following orders:<P>
<samp>
<B>England</B><BR>
a nmd hold<BR>
f ech s a nmd<BR>
f dov s a nmd<P>
<B>Burgundy</B><BR>
a dij hold<BR>
a cal s a dij<BR>
a ant s a dij<BR>
a lux s a dij<P>
</samp><P>
France could attack only NMD, CAL, DIJ, and LUX.  France could not
make a supported attack on CAL or LUX, and so could not take those
provinces.  France could attack NMD with a maximum force of 3 (from BRI,
ORL, and PAR) and could not cut either of the 2 English supports from the
English fleets.  France could attack DIJ with a maximum force of 4 (from
PAR, DAU, CAN, and SWA), but Burgundy had 3 supports on DIJ (from CAL,
ANT, and LUX).  France could not cut a support of DIJ without taking away
one support of an attack on DIJ, so Burgundy could hold this indefinitely.<P>
I convinced Burgundy that holding this line was better than attacking
France.  I demonstrated that any attack against France would probably
lead to either a French victory or an exchange of Dijon for Paris, which
would wreck the defense line and would therefore also lead to a French
victory.  I suggested instead that we hold the defense line and send his
two fleets all the way around Britain towards the Bay of Biscay and the
Mediterranean Sea, where they could be used to attack French cities
behind the line.  To my surprise, Burgundy agreed to the plan, and sent
his fleets on the long journey around Britain.  This epic voyage lasted
from Spring 1417 to Spring 1419, by which time the second Burgundy
fleet had reached the Bristol Channel.  During that time, Burgundy and I
held our defense line.<P>
France saw the writing on the wall and began pulling his forces
back from the defense line, trying to get us to get greedy and make grabs
for French SC's.  This finally happened in Spring 1419, when I moved into
an empty Paris.  This was the end of the England-Burgundy defense line.<P>
If the defense line had held indefinitely, something would have eventually
happened.  Basically, France needed its armies in BRI, ORL, PAR, DAU,
CAN, and SWA to hold back Burgundy and England.  This left two armies
to guard against the Burgundian fleets, one of which would have had to
guarded Guyenne.  France could have put its 8th army in Castile and done a
self-bounce in Aragon, which could have prevented Burgundy from
getting into the Mediterranean and would have kept Toulouse and
Provence safe.  However, by doing this, France could only have kept
three units guarding Brittany, while Burgundy and England could out four
units on Brittany.  But if they had attacked Brittany, Normandy would
have been insufficiently guarded.  It would have come down to a coin
toss or else a draw.<P>
France could have avoided the situation by building a fleet in 1415.
France's army in Poitou was useless.  If France could have got a fleet
into the Bristol Channel, he could have cut the support of Normandy,
which would have led to a guessing game, where France would guess
whether the Burgundy army in Calais would support the Normandy army
or the Dijon army.  Eventually, France would have guessed right and got
its 9th SC.<P>
There are other possibilities.  If England had been stronger and had a
third fleet, maybe a true stalemate line could have been achieved,
because this third fleet could have been put in the Bristol Channel.  Time
will tell whether there is a true stalemate line based on the Lancast
situation.<P>
<H3>The Troyes Defense Line</H3>
Troyes was a hard, hard fought war.  I again played England, so ineptly
that twice I had to build fleets in Scotland.  Alliances shifted many times.
In 1419, Burgundy [Ian York] had units in Anglia and London, and was at
7 SC's, while I was at 4 and France [Wes Makin] was at 6.  Then
Burgundy allied with me, and I repaid him the favor by stabbing him in
1422, which put me at 7 SC's, with Burgundy and France at 5 each.  I
thought I was pretty clever until two of my units were destroyed in
Spring 1423!  France ended up with a 7 to 5 to 5 advantage at the end of
1423, and my good friend Burgundy and I re-established our friendship.
<P>
I was getting a little sick of the war by this time.  Somebody (not me,
unfortunately!) gray broadcasted that this game was turning into a true
hundred years war!  So, I proposed to Burgundy that one of us help the
other one win the game, with the winner chosen by random event.
Burgundy didn't even respond, and when I asked again, he derided my
suggestion and argued that a 3-way draw was the only honorable end
to the game.
<P>
Of course, I had no intention of actually throwing the game in favor of
Burgundy, if Burgundy was to be the country who would win, under my
plan, so I have no standing to complain about Burgundy's
response to my idea!  Even so, I stabbed Burgundy again in 1425, vaguely
hoping to catch up with France.  Instead, at the end of 1425, France had
8 SC's, I had 6, and Burgundy had 3.  It was looking like a France win,
thanks to my actions.
<P>
Ian was fed up with me at this point and announced that if I thought I
could stop France, that I should do it on my own.  Ian then proceeded to
proxy control of his units to me.  So I had to look at the board and see if I
could find a defense line.
<P>
The situation in Spring 1426 was:

England:   Calais, Devon, Flanders, Holland, London, Scotland.<BR>
France:    Brittany, Dauphine, Guyenne, Normandy, Orleanais, Paris,
Provence, Toulouse.<P>
Burgundy:  3 Supply centers,  3 Units:  Builds   0 units.<BR>
England:   6 Supply centers,  6 Units:  Builds   0 units.<BR>
France:    8 Supply centers,  8 Units:  Builds   0 units.<P>
</samp><P>
With this configuration, France has a 50% chance of getting a 9th SC.
Basically, France can put three units on Dijon or two units on Savoy,
while Burgundy and England can put either three defensive units on Dijon
or two defensive units on Savoy, but not both.  A French conquest of
Savoy, inevitably leads to the French conquest of Cantons.<P>
I saw a defense line if I could get my army in Holland to Lorraine.  This
would take two turns, and France would have to guess wring both
turns.  If I did manage to get my army to Lorraine, then I could defend both
Dijon and Cantons with enough force every time to block a French attack.
I did manage to get my army to Lorraine, although I guessed wrong on
one of the turns, but France didn't hit us hard enough to break our line.
The line was set up, and a 3-way draw was declared.<P>
The defense line, therefore, was A CAL, A DIJ, A SWA, A CAN, and A SAV,
and enough power to prevent France from grabbing PLY, LON, or SCO.  This
keeps France at 8 SC's indefinitely.  Or does it?  I think I fooled Wes
Makin into thinking that the line was unbreakable, when in fact I think
Wes could have sent a fleet into the Med, which would have given him the
power to get Savoy, which would have given France a 50% per turn
of getting Cantons or Dijon, once I had the army in Swabia.  However, if
he had sent a fleet into the Med, I probably would have sent my fleets
after Brittany and Guyenne, which may have necessitated him pulling
back from the Med.<P>
I think a defense line that would have been easier to set up would have
been F DOV, A CAL, A ANT, A DIJ, A CAN, and A SAV.  If F DOV S A
CAL, A CAL S A DIJ, A ANT S A DIJ, A DIJ HOLD, A CAN S A SAV, A
SAV HOLD.  This is unbreakable unless there is a French fleet in the Med
or a French fleet to cut support from F DOV.<P>
<h3>Conclusion</H3>
<P>
France needs to build at least one and probably two fleets once it has 8
SC's.  Otherwise, it is too susceptible to defense lines.<P>
France, being primarily a land-based power, is probably more at risk to
have a defense line set up against it.  However, I know of no attempted
defense lines against England or Burgundy.  Time will tell if defense lines
can be set up against them.<P>
Powers who achieve 8 SC's need to either get the other two powers to
give up, get the other two powers to hate each other, or make sure in
advance that no defense line is possible.  Powers facing an 8 SC power
need to set aside their differences immediately and examine the board
very very carefully to find a defense line.<P>
An 8 SC power facing a defense line needs to either expose its SC's to
attack to break the line or else propose a 3-way draw.  It is very unlikely
that either power in the defense line will want to bargain with the 8 SC
power, since any joint action is likely to lead to the smaller power losing
rather than participating in a guaranteed 3-way draw.<P>
