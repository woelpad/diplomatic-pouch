<H2 align=center>A Diplomacy Variant for
Three Players,<br>Based on the Hundred Years' War
</H2>
<H3 align=center><em>Andy Schwarz</em></H3>
</table>
<HR>
As readers
of the Diplomatic Pouch generally know, the standard Diplomacy
game is set in pre-World War I Europe,
and involves seven people. The turn of the
twentieth century
is a great period on which to base
a seven-person game
because the diplomatic situation of the time was fluid
and multilateral.
The European governments of the time actually thought in terms of coalition
building and balance of power, so the setting makes for a fantastic mesh
of history and game balance (especially with the Ottomans propped up a bit
as they are in Diplomacy).  As I have said before, <B>Diplomacy is the best
game ever made.</B><P>
So, after some experience with a minor press variant
called <B>Touch</B> [See
<A HREF = "/Zine/W1995A/Schwarz/Touch.html">
the article</A> on this variant in the Winter 1995 Adjustments issue of
Diplomatic Pouch] and work getting Avalon Hill's <B>Colonial Diplomacy</B>
variant onto the judges, I wanted to make Diplomacy even better.  Yes, I
had the temerity and gumption to think I could improve on the best game ever made.   And in some ways, and with lots of help from others, I think
I have.  The variant is called <B>Hundred</B> on the judge, it is a three-player
game, and you can play it today.<P>
<blockquote>  <samp>[Note: I will
only claim to have made a better version of Diplomacy for three players.
In no way do I think hundred is better than Diplomacy, but I do think hundred
is a better game than the 3-person game suggested in the Diplomacy rule book.]</samp></blockquote><P>
<H3>The Impact of the Hall of Fame</H3>
With my rediscovery of Diplomacy (via the internet after a long hiatus from FTF) I fundamentally altered the way I approach the game.  I first played seriously in high school, and we often started games with ten interested
players, only to have the pool dwindle to 3 or 4 after a few hours of gaming.
In general, the best way to play was to grab an early lead and never let
go of the advantage, since civil disorder, despondent leaders of small powers,
and the rush of 15 minute turns all meant that autarky was the best alliance
strategy.  We never declared draws.  Under whatever conditions, we played
on, even if the end-game was just one player and a bunch of NMRed units.<P>
A game or two on the judge opened up a new world to me.  I knew of the
concept of a stop-the-leader alliance; I just never believed that it was
worth worrying about.  Similarly, I learned early on how common a 3-way draw could be when people had the time to really think out their turns.  I also learned about Nick Fitzpatrick's Hall of Fame (HoF) which, for better
or worse, came to dominate my own assessment of my skills, and thus took
on importance within the strategy for a given game.  The three-way draw,
already a relatively organic result in many games, was now made fairly desirable
because at 1.33 HoF points, it exceeded the 1.0 points a random player in
a random game should get over the course of 7 games ending in solo wins.
In other words, in my mind, a 3-way draw was the minimum acceptable outcome
for me to call myself "above average."<P>
Believe it or not, if one good
player starts a game with the strategy of securing a three-way draw first
and then seeing if it can be converted into a win, and he/she makes it into
the mid-game, it makes it much harder for the other players to avoid a three-way
draw without risking their own shot at sharing in at least a small draw.
Thus, I found my minimum acceptable result was becoming my most frequent
result, and while I still enjoy games that end in 3-ways and still pat myself
on the back for exceeding the 1.0 points per game, I began to look at my
actions and wonder if I was maximizing my fun/game along with my HoF points/game.<P>
It turns out I probably was maximizing my fun, because I suffer from a grave affliction: <samp>Loss Aversion.</samp>  I cannot bet much with my friends because over some minimum threshold, I feel the pain of losing
much more than  thrill of winning. In terms of Diplomacy, my loss aversion
meant that pocketing a three-way (and the accompanying 1.33 HoF points) had more value to me than the risk of losing it all (2/3 of the time on average if my fellow drawers are as good as I) in order to garner a win and 6 HoF points.  Even with the boosted expected value (i.e., 6 HoF points
1/3 of the time yields an average of 2, rather than 1.33, per game), I was
not willing to take the risk.<P>
The is not the place and I am not really
the person to give a good explanation of the impact of loss aversion on Judge Diplomacy, but I will give a quick effort and leave it at that.  Nick
Fitzpatrick's Hall of Fame point formula
<samp>(n-w)/w, where n=# of players
and W=# of winners/drawers</samp>
actually <B>rewards</B> risk taking.
If a player of average talent has secured a share of a three-way draw, he/she earns 1.33 points.  A risk-neutral player should be willing to trade
the guarantee of 1.33 for a 1/3 shot at a solo if the solo is worth 4 points
or more (since 4*1/3=1.33).  Thus, when Nick awards 6 points for a solo win, he is offering a 2.01 point premium for risk.  That means that all those who like risk, all those who are neutral, and even those who are risk
averse to some degree will still go for a solo win when faced with a three-way
if they feel they have at least a 1-in-3 shot.  It is only those players
who need more than a 2.01 premium to consider that risk worthwhile (players
like me) who are so risk averse as to stay put where they are and pocket
the 1.33.  The graph below attempts to illustrate this point:
<P>
<CENTER><table><tr><td>
<BR>
<a href="econ.gif"><IMG SRC="econ.gif"  Width=150
Height=180></img></A></TD><td>
<samp>The thick black line shows the HoF points.  The thin red line branching
off after the three-way draw illustrates the risk neutral path to a solo
win.  Players with preferences below the red line actually prefer risk.  Those between the red and black lines prefer to avoid risk, but the HoF
formula provides enough of a premium to lure them into taking risks.  Those
above the black line require more of a premium than is offered to take the
plunge, and the vertical line coming out of the three way represents infinite
aversion to risk, for which no amount of HoF points for a solo will compensate
for any risk of losing it all.  At least I'm not that bad.</samp></TD></TR></TABLE></center>
One way to address the Hall of Fame point issue would be to make the Hall of Fame more like Conrad Minshall's Diplomacy Skill Index (DSI),
which rates players on a point per game system rather than the HoF's cumulative
total.  In my case, however, since I feel that any average above 1.0/game
is an ego-boost, this would not dissuade me from taking an easy three-way
draw.  After all, it takes hard work to get a game down to three players.
If the players remaining are worthy of the draw, it also means they are
going to be hard to beat in an end-game.  With so much success already in
a given game, with so much of my quirkiness revealed to these players, I'm
still going to be happy with a score above 1 point.<P>
<H3>A New Variant
is Born</H3>
The only solution I could see would be to start the game
in the middle of  game, when only three players remained, and award points
only for further movement.  However, the natural stalemate lines of the Diplomacy board are very well know and it seemed a difficult task to find
a starting position that did not unfairly penalize one of the three players
by giving the others more easily defended borders.  After all, three-way
draws happen even without the HoF; the Diplomacy board has barren zones that make it very natural.  So I decided to revise the map at the same time
and create a new variant. <P>
This was not the only reason Hundred was
created.  When the real-time Diplomacy (rtdip) movement first began, the
logistics were hard enough to arrange that we often fell short of seven players, even with a global pool to draw from.  As a result, we experimented
with 5 player variants, and I still have plans to develop <B>Ancients</B>
based on the Mediterranean, circa 260 B.C., to handle a 5-player environment,
but it seemed that rtdippers would appreciate a scaled-down three-player
game which could be played very quickly in a tournament style.
I tried
to find a historical period on which to base a tripartite struggle, much
as the seven-power structure of standard Diplomacy came
naturally from
Diplomacy's being set just before the First World War.
The later phases
of the Hundred Years' War, in which
England, France, and Burgundy struggled
for pre-eminence in
northwestern Europe, seemed a natural.    Rather than
being an
abstract and symmetrical variant like <B>Chromatic</B>,  Hundred
is
based on a real strategic situation in Europe around 1415-1430
A.D.,
when the King of England, Henry V, looked poised to become
King of France
and potentially bring much of what is now France
into the English sway.
And frankly, I've always been a big fan of the Dukes of Burgundy.  Even though they are represented among the "what if" powers of <B>Aberration</B>,
I wanted to give the younger branch of the Valois family a real moment of
focus and glory.<P>

<H3>The Board</H3>
Thus, the period
of time around 1420 offered a real three-way
struggle, with each power having a legitimate chance to win and
each facing different challenges,
though perhaps Hundred's Burgundy is a bit stronger than the real Duchy.
France begins in Hundred with no fleets and limited access to the important
Atlantic ports. Burgundy begins much smaller than England or France, but
occupies the board's northeast corner, thus sparing it some
defensive needs.  England has fleets and equals France in size,
but its units are
spread from the Spanish border to London, and
the English player must find
a way to consolidate his forces or
risk being chopped up piecemeal.<P>

<caption valign=bottom><strong>The Hundred Game Board</strong></caption>
</table></CENTER>
The board itself is very dense.  There are 17 supply centers,
14 of which begin with units, meaning the struggle for the neutrals is quite
contested and that players all face immediate threats to home centers.  Furthermore, with only three powers, any thought of a long-term alliance
is difficult to maintain, since a player with 7 SCs (quite possible after
the first year of play) is so too close to victory to trust.  The board is really divided into zones of dispute, with Paris serving as the board's
psychological center (see <a href="finalscs.html">Charlie Eldred's statistics</a>
to back this up).  Paris and Orl&eacuteanais have ended the game in the hands of all three powers, and thus while they begin the game as French,
they are legitimately contested by all players.  Head southeast from the
Ile de France, and Dauphin&eacute, Provence and Cantons emerge as the most
fierce Franco-Burgundian theatre.  The neutral in this zone, Cantons, has
been split fairly evenly between these powers over the games completed to
date.<P>
West of Paris are the lands most hotly contested between France
and England: Normandy, Brittany, and Guyenne.  To the south, Toulouse has
actually been captured by all three powers, but is generally also contested
between France and England.  Guyenne is quite removed from the rest of England
and so Guyenne vs. Toulouse is often an early and isolated battle, won frequently
by the French. Brittany, the key neutral here, has been evenly split between
these two powers<P>
Finally, England and Burgundy fight fiercely over Flanders
and Calais, as well as Scotland, which has gone primarily to Burgundy, and
has twice gone uncaptured.  Like Guyenne vs. Toulouse, the Scottish battle
takes place somewhat removed from the more intense action in the center of the board.  Nonetheless, the victor in these two "side shows" gains an
important advantage of strength and position in the larger struggle, and
a Burgundian army build in Scotland or a French fleet build in Guyenne can
dramatically change the nature of these side shows.<P>
<H3> New Rules</H3>
Other than the revised map and victory conditions, Hundred uses almost completely standard Diplomacy rules.  One exception is that like <B>Aberration</B>,
as long as they still possess one original SC, powers may build in any vacant
SC which they own, not merely their original 4 or 5 SCs.  This reflects the historical reality of the Hundred Years' War in which treaties were often signed ceding provincial control to and from the various combatants,
thus changing what "Home Centers" a power controlled.  Furthermore, it allows
for powers to change their spheres of interest as the game evolves.  For
example, while France begins as a land power, with the capture of Guyenne
and/or Brittany, it may need Atlantic fleets; by building F Guyenne, France
suddenly threatens the English coast and changes the game dramatically.  Without this build (or the equivalent build of an English Army in Orleans
or a Burgundian army in Scotland), the game is too predictable and potentially
prone to stalemates.<P>
In addition, there is an artificial connection
between Calais and London.  Any unit in Calais can support any action in/into
London, and it can move directly to London itself, as if the provinces were
adjacent (and vice versa from London to Calais).  Unlike the land bridge
between Spain and North Africa in <B>Loeb9</B>, units cross "the Chunnel"
at full strength, and unlike the Straits of Messina in <B>Machiavelli</B>,
the presence of a fleet in the Strait of Dover has no impact on the land-bridge.
In fact, while a hostile F Dov cannot oppose the attack, a friendly fleet
in the Strait  can support the attack, acting like a double strength convoy/support
in one.  This was done purely for game balance: I make no claim about the
ability of troops to jump from Dover to Calais.  By adding the land bridge,
France has some hope of reaching London without a massive naval build up,
and similarly, a Calais unit can be supported from London, providing England
with a stronger beachhead than would otherwise be possible.<P>

<P>
<H3>Solo Wins encouraged</H3>
Since
eliminating draws was a big part of the design of Hundred, I was careful
to leave an uneven # of SCs.  While it is possible for three players to play such a perfect game of shifting alliances that a game can go forever
(or until a three-way "no-winners" draw is declared as in the game <I>troyes</I>),
if draws include all survivors, a game of Hundred can only end in a two-way
draw if at least one neutral province is <B>never</B> captured.  Since the
three neutrals on the board (Brittany, the Cantons of Switzerland, and Scotland)
are placed in zones of contention between the three powers, the level of
trust required to get such an outcome is even harder than the rare two-way
draw of standard Diplomacy.  And the final stab for the win is much easier,
since it means grabbing an undefended neutral, rather than cracking the 17-17 stalemate line.  In early negotiations, when players have discussed
this option, Scotland is the usually mentioned neutral, because it cannot
be captured in the first year of play, and so both England and Burgundy may prefer to use their "Scottish Assault Force" (F London or F Holland)
for more immediate gains.  In fact, this Scottish Two-Way Scenario has often
been the starting point of Anglo-Burgundian
negotiations, but it has yet
to come to fruition, since the temptation to win by grabbing for that unoccupied
neutral is great, and players know this, so they stab even sooner.<P>
In
an ironic twist, Nick Fitzpatrick has recently agreed to recognize Hundred
games for Hall of Fame points.  The normal formula, <samp>(n-w)/w</samp>
remains, but n=2.33 instead of 3.  As a result, a win in hundred is worth
1.33 HoF points, exactly equal to a 3-way draw in standard games, which seems a nice dovetail of design impetus and result.<P>
While the risk-aversion
problem may now have returned, I am not worried.  Nick grants 1.33 points
for a solo win in hundred and only 0.16 for the yet unseen two-way.  Should
a player find the HoF point equivalent of a 6-way draw satisfactory, I think
it will prove impossible to get them to ever take any risk at all!<P>
<H3> The Variant's History So Far</H3>
Eleven full-press games of Hundred
have been played to completion as of early September 1996.  France has won
three of these games, Burgundy has won five, the English have won two, and
one was a long-fought three-way draw.  Seven more are currently underway,
plus France has won a NoPress real-time game.  Check out the<A
HREF="http://home1.stofanet.dk/Kristian/hhof.htm">
Hundred "Hall of Fame,"</A> for more details on past games <samp>[Thanks
to Charlie Eldred for his help on compiling the HHoF]</samp>.  If there is an "Italy" in Hundred, it may be England, which seems to require more
skill to manage its scattered position.  However, England is no push over,
and the ability to defend its home island is always a plus.<P>
<A NAME="finalscs">To
better understand</A> which provinces matter to which powers, Charlie Eldred
has compiled <a href=finalscs.html>some very interesting statistics on
province occupation and SC control in Hundred</a>.
The core finding is not surprising: Paris and the 5 supply centers
surrounding it, as well as neighboring Flanders are the most heavily occupied
centers, and Paris itself is the most contested SCs.  So the Hundred board,
like a standard one, is approximately circular.  It has a vital heart and
a fluid periphery.<P>

In terms of flow, a few games have ended very quickly
(in three game years) with a single power shooting out of the blocks before
the others could forge an alliance.  Other games have now lasted much longer,
with alliance shifting with the balance of power.  One game, <I>lancast</I>,
started with a quick French burst: 3 builds in the first game year.  However,
France built all armies and England and Burgundy were able to use their fleet advantage to stalemate France while slowly working the Burgundian navy around through Scotland to the western seas.  Before the Burgundian
could break into the Mediterranean and end the stalemate, the French player
ceded ground and the game resumed a more fluid nature.  Recently France has regained 8 SC, and now equipped with some naval power, hopes to break
though the re-built Anglo-Burgundian defense line.  The game <I>troyes</I>
in USIN lasted into its second decade, and the game was never fully stalemated;
however, after 11 years, the players decided to call it a fair fight and
share a no-winner draw.  The lessons of these games are plain: be willing
to realign yourself at a moment's notice.  In fact, as one player in Hundred
has said: <samp>"It is impossible to forge long-term alliance or hold long-term
grudges in Hundred.  If you do, you will lose."</samp><P>
<P>
I think
new players to Hundred see it as a fun trifle, but the few that have played
several games are enjoying learning some of the nuances.
<A NAME="players"><a href=players.html>Comments from experienced players</A>
can guide the new player and also have had some effect on the development
of the variant.  In addition,
as a little experiment, three former winners are
squaring off in a Hundred all-star game called <I>lesrois</I> on USIN.  It will be interesting to see how three "veterans" approach the game.<P>
<A NAME="eldred">Despite</A> <I>lancast</I> being a gunboat game, I have
