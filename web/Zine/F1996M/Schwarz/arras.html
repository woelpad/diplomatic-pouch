Here are some exerpts from the EOG statements in Arras, which
demonstrate why no defense line developed
against me [Charlie Eldred]; namely,
because France [Gordon Aickin] and
England [Kevin Hughes] hated each
other!

EOG statement.<P>
I don't have a lot to say.  I conducted almost no Diplomacy.  Apparently I
am the "victim"
of English hatred towards France.<P>
. . . I took Scotland, I think, because England didn't like France and
wanted him to lose. . .<P>

Hey!  I'll let you know
that I really like the hundred variant.  The games are
quick and furious
and every single turn counts.<P>
It was extremely interesting to me how
this entire game was fought
between myself, England, and France, with Burgundy
picking up the
pieces.  I was put on the defensive in the first move since
my plans with
France fell through, and I ended up supporting Burgundy.  I think it was
easy for myself to become so enthralled with punishing France that I lost
sight of
Burgundy. . .<P>

First
I would like to say that I also enjoyed the variant and will be playing
it again. It has several good points which make it interesting  -- the need to
be able to make your enemy into your friend being one.<P>
. . . England Yes I attacked you on the first turn. You have to attack some
one and there are only two to chose from. You hardly expected me to
say
up front you were an enemy and I intended to kick you out of France
immediately?<P>
I had arranged a combined attack with Burgundy but when the time came
to move he just sat back and waited. (I was wrong -- you need attack no
one.)<P>
This was realy my down fall as I was expecting Burgundy to move
west
but he went south instead.<P>
I then got into a big fight with France and we just gave the game to
Burgundy we did not trust each other
and kept fighting untill it was too
late.
<P>
I was caught out by just
how quickly the game went. I did not realise
how close The Victory was until it was far to late. I think that with a
better knowledge of the variant
players will be more aware and see
the need to switch sides. I believe that the two of us could have stoped
Burgundy but we just did not even try. Too busy fighting.<P>
Congratulations to Gundi an a masterful strategy
and thanks to all
(both) for a good game.<P>

. . . In fact, at the end, England told me that he wasn't attacking me to get
back at France. . . <P>
