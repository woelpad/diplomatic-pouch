<H2 align=CENTER>Formigny:
Demoralize and Conquer</H2>
<HR>
[France] Andy Schwarz avoided having a defense line form against him in
Formigny by bluffing England [Gary Duke] and Burgundy [Derek Carlson]
into believing that resistence would be futile because he had the game
clinched.  Here are some excerpts from Andy's broadcasts in the final
year of the game.<P>

Broadcast message from France in 'formigny' [before Spring 1421]:<P>

I have entered orders.  I encourage you both to think hard (but
quickly????). Stalling will only make my inevitable reign all the harsher.<P>

Regardless, I believe come winter, I shall be crowned in Reims.<P>

Looks like France has it - well done Chuck!<P>

Might as well play the last turn, though...

[before Fall 1421, when Andy won]:<P>

The final orders are being entered with this.  Give it your best (yet futile)
shot...though I must admit I haven't looked at convoyed attacks...Hmm,
maybe I'll submit these orders and check them out... so you might catch
me off guard, but I'll finalize within the hour.<P>

EoG and Designer's statement for France in Formigny (USIN - Hundred)<P>

. . . Derek and Gary put up the best ally-or-die alliance we've seen to
date.  <samp>{This was before troyes and lancast</samp>}<P>

I had no forced win in Spring.  I was hoping to discourage serious
cooperation.  In Fall, the only move that would have kept me from
winning, however, was a 3-way asault on Brittany, leaving London
unguarded, and Dov-Nmd.<P>
