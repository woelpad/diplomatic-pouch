Player Comments Regarding the Hundred Variant
</H2>
<HR>
<P>
<strong><em>Some very good players have played the hundred variant,
and a few of them have provided the colowing commentaries.  While I am not
100% in agreement with all the thoughts, I think the diversity of opinion
is itself a sign of good game balance.</em></strong><P>

<h3> On France: the Southern Strategy</h3>
<H4> From R Gordon Aickin's EoG in the NoPress game
Jun1h (USIN)</H4><P>

 I suspect that this variant is well suited to RT
play due to the short duration and
 small number of players. Having said
that I feel that it is probably not at
 its best when  played without press
as this makes stopping the leader
 even harder than it normal is. Also I suspect that stopping the leader is
 harder in hundred than the standard
game because there is very little
 time to reposition forces in before the win is achieved.<P>

 I think I was the only player who had played
the variant before and if
 that is so then I had a great advantage. I played
in the game Arras (I
 was France then too) and it was a disaster for me
as the game was won
 quickly by Burgundy while France and England fought
one another. (I came
 a poor third.) The main reason for this was that the three players ended
 up in roughly three vertical lines with France
as the filling in the
 sandwich. This made it almost impossible for England
to attack Burgundy
 and left France to be crushed. My main aim in this game was to avoid the
 same happening again.<P>

 So I started by moving
strongly for the Cantons in an attempt to get away
 from the middle in to a corner. The advantages were two fold. I was more
 afraid of England
than Burgundy and hoped that England would not attack
 me if I did not attack him. Also I hoped that by keeping Burgundy in the
 north it would
be easier for England to attack him.
<P>
 After the first year there was
a period of four years while the players
 joked for position and all were
cautious. The only SC build gained was for
 Scotland but there was some
exchanging of centers between nations. My
 plan was to position myself along the bottom of the map so that I would
 have my back to a wall as it were and be able to advance with out
 protecting my back.
<P>
 I succeeded
in getting this line. Losing Paris and Orl in the process but
 once the
line was established it was relatively easy to advance especially
 as the
English and Burgurs were now fighting. The game was really quit
 well defined
in to two phases and I think that it was the first phase
 that decided the result more than the second. If England had moved
 fleets down into
The bay of biscay. Or retreated to Catalonia <samp>[Aragon]</samp>
 and
thus being behind my line I think that the result could have been very different.

<P>
 And finally I will do what is possibly very dangerous and disagree
with
 the designer. I am not certain that it is Burgundy who has it hard
in
 no press games. I think that the most obvious thing is for France and

 England to fight. It is certainly what my first instincts tell me to do

 as France, Attack the English in Aqu and Nmd. I would have done that If

 I had not tried it already and see it lead to my down fall. And in a
 No press game it is a great advantage to be the only one not fighting
 as it allows you to position your self first and then attack. I think
 it is possibly England who has it hardest as England has the least
 opportunity
to avoid war. The fleets are useless as aggressive weapons
 against France
unless France attacks first and can not be used to
 defend once territory
is gained either. While the armies in Aqu and
 Nmd start along way from
Burgundy and the French are likely to be in
 the way even if of the obvious
route to advance on. This means that
 the English must either fight both
opponents simultaneously. (Not a
 good option.) Or else waste a third of
their units with nothing to do.

<H4> Follow up by
Charlie Eldred, re: the NoPress game Jun1h (USIN)</H4><P>

I agree <samp>[re:
Burgundy's advantages in No Press games]</samp>.  
Burgundy, like Turkey
in standard Dip, has nobody behind it and
can sit back for a while.  Perhaps
the next phase in the maturing of the
game will be routine EF alliances
against Burgundy.  But then there's the
problem of unused English units.
It sure is fun seeing the variant develop.<P>

<h3> Crucial Supply
Centers</h3>
<H4> By Vincent Mous (game designer extraordinaire)</H4><P>


 I think that Cantons is a very important center to own for France and

France should try getting it right off the bat even if it means losing

Paris. This is because it is very easy to hold for France or Burgundy but 
if France has it she essentially protects herself from any strong 
Burgundian attack.<P>

  In the midgame, Paris is a very important center
to hold. It is a supply 
center, but it is even more important tactically
because it borders 5 other 
supply centers (a big number for Hundred). Actually, it ONLY borders supply 
centers. If you hold Paris, whoever you
are, you can easily launch 
supported attacks on neighbouring centers. For this reason, I think Paris 
changes hands very often, because no one
wants someone else to have it.<P>

  Dover is of similar importance to
England and Burgundy. It borders 5 
supply centers, and qualifies as the
second most important peace of real 
estate on the board after Paris. Because
of the limited number of units and 
therefore of fleets in Hundred, it is also very hard to be pushed out of 
Dover.<P>

  An interesting move
for Burgundy is to take Scotland and then build an 
army there. With an
army on the British mainland, Burgundy's position to 
attack England is
much stronger. Unfortunately, doing so makes England more 
or less a permanent
enemy, which helps France out as she can chose on what 
side to fight.<P>


  BTW, Andy, has any France won without building a fleet?<P>

Note: Yes, in Agincour, won by Michael Johnson</samp>

<h3> How Should England Deal with Guyenne: A Discussion</H3>
<h4>Andy Schwarz, winner
as England in <I>Crecy</I> starts the debate:</H4>
Guyenne (formerly Aquitaine):
Has been captured 8 of 12 games by France.  England,knowing it will likely
lose it, should abandon it early.  Brittany, on theother hand, has gone Englih 7 of 5 times, and I would wager that of those 5
times it went French,
it HAD been English for at least 3 of them.<P>

Knowing this, and given
F Devon (formerly Plymouth) being a Brittany unit almost entirely in the
first year of play (1425, formerly 1415), I propose the "correct" play for
England (at war with France) is:<P>

A Guyenne-Aragon, A Normandy-Orleanais<P>


By going to Aragon, you remain a thorn in France's side for a long time.

Plus, if you ever get a fleet into Biscay, suddenly regaining Guyenne isn't

so hard.  The Normandy move may not be optimal...<P>

Hell, maybe the
best move is A Guyenne-Poitou along with Nmd-Bri<P>

The point is Normandy
can be dislodged, but then Britanny is there for the
retreat.  If Orl-Brit,
then Orl is probably vacant, so adding A Poit can
assure the Guy for Bri
trade AND get te crucial unit INTO France.   If you
take Bri with the fleet,
get it into Bis can get back Guyenne.  If you take
it with a Dislodged,
Nmd, use the A Poi to either retake Guy or cut support
and take Nmd from
the BCH.<P>


I think England is doing poorly in these games because of an unwillignness
to send Guyenne on a "Chevauchee" across to Calais,
like the Black Prince
used to do, cutting a swath through France.  Get that army inland and let the navy retake Guyenne later!  What else can you
do with those fleets anyway?  Well, there is the matter of defense, but...<P>


I also think F Lon-Dov should be a standard opening and the F Lon-Ang
is
really second rate.  If Burgundy is willing to send its fleet north,
let it!
Take advanatage of the strong defensive position of Dov.  Plus,
can
England really afford to have F Hol-Dov succeed?<P>

Now that I say
that, though, no one has tried a really western opening, as
far as I rememeber,
i.e., F Lon-Ech, F Dev-Bch. <P><blockquote> <samp> Actually Charlie Eldred
reminds me that England did this in Fulton, but France and Burgundy took
Calais and
Normandy, so he disbanded F BCH in W1416.</samp></blockquote><P>


This gets a fleet into
Biscay really fast and might make it worth whie
to contest Guyenne by
hitting Toulose to prevent the 2nd unit from provence
from slipping in if A
Tou-Poi is tried.<P>

I think England is using its fleets wrong in many games I watch.  These are
just some ideas to bounce
of of you experienced players (some of you have
played hundred more than
I have)<P>

Of course, there is no BEST move in Diplomacy, since alliances
matter more
than tactics.  But since Hundred's alliances are quick to form
and end,
tactics probably play a bigger role.<P>

Your thoughts?<P>

<h4>Doug Essinger-Hileman, winner as England in <I>Bretagne</I>
replies</H4>
I disagree here. *If* England is at war with France, and has
prepared for that war by forming an alliance with Burgundy, I believe that
the best opening for England is to take Brittany from Normandy with support
from Guyenne . The two fleets then open to the Strait of Dover and the English
Channel. And the army in Calais supports the Burgundian into Paris.<P>

With this combination of moves, a French move to Brittany is foiled. And
if France takes Normandy it is easily regained.<P>

Of course, one of the difficulties of any diplomacy game is in making the initial determination
of who to trust and not. If England is unsure of the trustworthiness of France and Burgundy, then I believe giving up Guyenne in exchange for Brittany
is a sound move.<P> 

If England is unsure of the opponents, and decides
to cede Guyenne for Brittany if necessary, then I believe that this is a
good choice of first moves.<P>

> I also think F Lon-Dov should be a standard
opening and the F Lon-Ang is<BR>
> really second rate.  If Burgundy is willing to send its fleet north, let it<P>

Absolutely. I do not see the
time when I would consider sending the London fleet north in the opening
move. If I were allied with Burgundy, that would be a clear sign that I was breaking the alliance. And if I were at war with Burgundy, then I would
rather establish a solid strategic position in the Strait of Dover (or deny
that position to Burgundy) than send a unit to the northern hinterlands.<P>


> ...can England really afford to have F Hol-Dov succeed?<P>

Not if
at war with Burgundy. However, that fact can often be used as a powerful
tool in negotiating with the French. For if Burgundy gets into the Strait
of Dover behind the English defense, then Calais is quite threatened. And
the fall of Calais and the Strait of Dover to a hostile Burgundian means
that the safety of London, and then maybe Devon, can not be guaranteed.<P>


> I think England is using its fleets wrong in many games I watch.  These

As England, I have twice now had to manage the liabilities of the fleets. Their initial
position suggests that their easiest use is along the northern coast of France. However, once there they do not have the ability to move or support
inland. This can be especially costly if England is trying to defend and
Orleanais garrison. They can be better used along France's western or southern
coast, but it takes some time to get them there.<P>

The problem of inland
support of Orleanais can be solved (I discovered too late) by  rotating the army in Guyenne to Brittany, and retaking Buyenne with the fleet if necessary and desired.<P>
