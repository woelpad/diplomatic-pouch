<H2 align=center>Germany's End Of Game Statement from "vanier"</H2>
<hr><p>

<b>Broadcast message from Germany in vanier:</b>

<p>
For my dear friend,<br>
Sultan of Turkey,<br>
El Faq al Ohmed
<p>
My Brother,
<p>
It is with greatest sorrow that I put pen to paper.  All that we had 
dreamed of, the fair and steady rule of Europe, the peaceful 
interchange among our peoples, is now ground to dust beneath the heel 
of the Barbarian of the North.
<p>
It is especially bitter to reach this condition through the failure of 
my own staff.  Prince Von Grossbeek was a good man, but he was not the 
right man to lead our empire to its rightful place.  Of course, I must 
take the blame.  Perhaps if I had taken greater personal interest in 
the Prince's plans for our armies, this would not have come to pass.  
Alas, we brew our own bitter poison; we must be strong enough to drink 
deeply when our time comes.
<p>
So much went according to the German plan.  The conquest of the East 
against an isolated Russia.  The suprise attack against a France too 
intent on Spain to notice their own vunerability.  The partition of 
Austria and Italy with your own empire.  Up until 1908, everything had 
worked.  Each chance Germany took paid off; fortune had smiled on us 
at every turn.  And then we hesitated.  How ironic that Germany should 
fall because we hesitated instead of striking at Prince Hamlet.  For 
this, the historians will mock us forever. 
<p>
Though even now, I am not sure what path would have led to German 
success.  We were trapped in the middle and vunerable to attack from 
behind, whether we moved north against Norway or south against Turkey. 
Our only hope was to enlist one against the other, while making the 
attack on Germany too costly to risk.  It was our failure to achieve 
either of these that was our undoing.  I now spend many sleepless 
nights, wondering what we could have done to convince you to sail your 
fleets west against the Norwegians in Spain.  Perhaps the answer is 
simple, we should have come out plainly and asked.  Perhaps we were 
too circumspect, waiting for Turkey or Norway to make the first 
overture.
<p>
Still, all might not have been lost if we hadn't miscalculated at the 
end.  Prince Von Grossebeek's plan was straightforward:  Give the 
Norwegians enough ground so that Turkey must come to Germany's aid.  
But we gave too much ground.  And by the time we realized our mistake 
it was too late.  Such are the errors that lead to the fall of once 
mighty empires.
<p>
I was touched by your concern for my person.  I do well, even though 
the journey from Germany to here was harsh.  I have not written to you 
because Prince Von Grossebeek had insisted on handling all the German 
correspondence.  He felt it would be below my station to involve my 
hands in daily diplomatic affairs.  In retrospect, perhaps I distanced 
myself too greatly, abdicating my responsibilities in practice long 
before doing so officially.
<p>
If you should speak to Prince Hamlet, please wish him well.  I do not 
begrudge him his victory.  Though he inherited much of his status and 
position, it was he that saw it through to the end, making victory out 
of what might otherwise have been only a glorious failure for Norway.
<p>
