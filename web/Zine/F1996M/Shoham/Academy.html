<b>Introduction</b>
<p>
The next game to be reviewed is "Vanier". The focus of this study is the
endgame where there are three superpowers left. Many players believe that
a three-way draw is then the only correct outcome. This end of game statement
explores the issue, as always, through the spectacles of hindsight on a
completed, actual, game.
<p>
"Vanier" was a Loeb9 variant game. Loeb9 is a popular Judge variation which
adds some
provinces, supply centers, and players to the standard map. As a replacement
player, I did not see much of the early game. When I joined, the game was
already reduced to three superpowers -- with a few minor powers still busy
being exterminated. Norway -- the power I played -- was the smallest of the
three. For
the purposes of this study, this is ideal since it allows us to distill the
issues involved with playing when there are only three powers left from other
possible influences that might have come from a game long engagement.
<p>
Enjoy.
