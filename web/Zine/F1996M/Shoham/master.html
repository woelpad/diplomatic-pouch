<H2 align=center>Germany's Response to Norway's End Of Game Statement</H2>

<b>Broadcast message from umgrimst@CC.UManitoba.CA as Master in vanier:</b>
<p>
Congratulations to Norway!
<p>
I guess I should say a couple of words.  Firstly, I'd like to
thank everyone for playing.  I hope you all enjoyed the game
and will play/GM on the Manitoba Judge in the future.  (OBTW,
there is an opening for Austria in "OTTAWA" if any of you
are interested. <A shameless plug, I know>)
<p>
Secondly, I hope that my explanation of the SET DRAW command
didn't unduly influence anyone.  I wasn't sure if the "problem"
was genuine or was a ploy, so I took a some what paternal
approach.  I'm rather glad that the game ended in an outright
victory.  It seems to be the most appropriate way for Diplomacy
to end, IMHO.
<p>
Again, thanks for playing and congratulation to Norway.
<p>
