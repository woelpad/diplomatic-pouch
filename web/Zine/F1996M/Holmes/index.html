"Your extra information helped, Holmes!" I cried exultantly as I entered
the Baker Street lodgings, with my hand waving a pile of papers I had
received in the morning post.  "We have a fair number of <em>Venison
Camper</em> searchers!"
<p>
"Indeed, Watson?" came the reply.  Holmes was obviously in control of his
emotions, but my years at his side enabled me to see a slight twinkle in his
eye that betrayed that excitement or relief which I had expected he would
feel.  "Let us have a look!"
<P>
With that, I cleared Holmes's tea from the writing table and laid before him
a number of the messages that I had been brought.  Holmes had no time to
read them before we launched in depth into the first, but in scanning his
eye over the text, I could see that he was very pleased with the abilities
of my readership.
<P>
"These come from the Regulars, then, Watson?" Holmes asked, referring, as he
was wont to do, to the readership of The Diplomatic Pouch as the Baker Street
Regulars.
<P>
"They do, Holmes.  Brought to me by hand, they were, one and all."
<p>
"Excellent, excellent!  Let us see if any of my humble lessons in detection
are being harvested."  Holmes took the first set of papers from the pile and,
handing it to me, asked me to read it aloud.  For his part, he stocked his
pipe and then sat silently to listen intently, his eyes closed.
<P>
I thereupon commenced reading
the first document, which was was from one
<a href=mailto:leotard@fusl.ac.be>Marc Leotard</a>.  Here is what it said:
<blockquote><em>
Dear Doctor Watson:
<P>
I enjoyed your tale of the Hunt for the Venison Camper very much. I found
all but one anagram (Irish Sea) without using Holmes' highlighted text.
It was a great pleasure.  Alas, the Sultan's instructions were rather too
cryptic for me to understand until the clarification you published as a
follow-up, especially the fact that only provinces on the continent were
concerned. Or that you had but English units on the board.
<P>
Nevertheless, here is my answer.
<P>
You have to pass through Brest, Ruhr, Berlin, Moscow and Galicia before
getting to Greece.  (Clyde and Smyrna, while not anagrammed, are not on
the European continent.) I could do it in 13 turns and 5 convoys.
<P>

</blockquote>

After I stopped reading, Holmes pulled from his pipe and finally said,
"Interesting!  Quite interesting indeed!  As you know, Watson, I solved
the problem in one fewer movement phase, but I hadn't considered that the
journey was possible so quickly using only a single fleet more than England
begins the game with."
<P>
Sheepishly, I admitted to Holmes that the discrepancy was surely in my
own chronicles of the episode.  I averred that it was my opinion that when
writing of the restriction against building in more than one location, I
probably misled some solvers into believing that only one single unit more
could be built by England <em>in toto</em> to accomplish the purpose.  Holmes
looked crossly at me, in silent agreement, and I resolved to do a better job
in future of recording my friend's deeds.
<P>
At just that moment, the bell rang, and on being admitted, we found it to
be none other than M. Leotard himself, bearing a freshly finished work.
He explained that the missive I had received from him was incomplete and
that I was missing the latter half of his message.  In this latter half,
which he presented to us now (after paying the kindest of compliments to
my friend), M. Leotard had solved the solution in one phase fewer, in case
my meaning should be taken that multiple builds may be accomplished.
After apologizing for the confusion and explaining that this indeed was
what the famed Sultan of Suwat had intended, Holmes asked me to read
M. Leotard's addendum.  Here are the moves it contained:

<p>
When I finished, Holmes removed his pipe and addressed himself to M. Leotard.
"Well done!  Well done indeed.  I see but one error.  In your scenario,
no new center is occupied in Fall of 1904, and so your build at the end of
that year becomes impossible."
<P>
Shocked, I checked what Holmes said and it was indeed true.  I looked for
disappointment in M. Leotard's face, but saw only surprise and a sense of awe
for my friend's unique abilities.
<p>
Interested now in pursuing the subject, M. Leotard asked if he could remain
with us to look through the rest of the correspondence I had received, so that
the manner in which his error could be remedied might be shown him.  Holmes
gladly consented, the two men sat down, and I picked up the next dispatch from
the table.  It was from
<a href=mailto:rehbold@dippy.franken.de>Robert Rehbold</a> and it ran as
transcribed below:
<blockquote><em>
Dr Watson:
<p>
Here is my solution to the Venison Camper mystery which was solved so ably
by your esteemed friend Mr. Holmes, saving the Empire of late from an
unquestionable tragedy in the making.
<P>
To solve part one of the puzzle, we must unravel the anagrammed province
names in the Sultan's story.  Having done this, I state that
the only provinces not mentioned in the story are Berlin, Brest, Clyde,
Galicia, Greece, Moscow, Ruhr, and Smyrna. Now, if this is wrong, the rest
of my answer obviously will be as well.
<P>
Next we take away Smyrna which is not European and Clyde which is not on
the continent,
that leaves Berlin, Brest, Galicia, Greece, Moscow, and Ruhr. As the Sultan
states that he is currently at the sea, only Berlin, Brest, and Greece remain
as vacation
spots.  However, he says that there is no port or city ("urban life") around,
so neither Berlin nor Brest can be the solution, which leaves us with
Greece; luckily the same result which your friend Sherlock H. came up with.
<P>
Part two of the puzzle charges us to 
find a path from Liverpool to Greece which passes through Berlin, Brest,
Galicia, Moscow, and Ruhr (not necessarily
in that order), in the minimum number of moves and with the maximum number
of convoys.  As
additional constraints, we are to use only English units starting with the
normal start setup, take only one new supply center per year, and build always
in the same English home center.
<P>
It takes me six years to to the trick, and I do not think it can be done
faster (though I'm not sure that it cannot be done with more convoys). Note
that with exception of the unnecessary convoy extensions twice through North
Sea and the useless convoy through the Baltic, the other convoys seem to be
necessary for the fastest route regardless of the condition "use as many
convoys as possible."

</blockquote>
<p>
When I finished reading this solution, which was nearly identical to that
produced by Holmes, my friend said, with undue modesty, "You see, Watson,
my skills are not so specialized as you think.  It seems to me that your
readers, both M. Leotard here and others, are well-suited to 'match wits,'
as you say, with me."
<P>
M. Leotard and I both began to protest, claiming that it was only the great
Holmes's hints and clues which enabled my gentle readers to follow his
speeding intelligence.  It was to no avail, however, and the three of us
retired happily to the dining room, where, over a supper of mutton, we perused
another correct solution from <a href=jeffbehan@aol.com>Jeff Behan</a>.
<p>
In his message, Mr. Behan made some good points, with which Holmes agreed.
One was that
the possibility exists at two points in the journey for the army to take one
of two routes.  First, in convoying from Brest, the army may arrive either
at Belgium or in Holland.  Holmes justified his choice of Holland by noting
that if the emissary, as stated, enjoyed ocean voyages so, it would make
sense to convoy him as far as possible.  Secondly, in moving from Galicia to
Moscow, either Warsaw or the Ukraine could be a choice for the army.  Holmes
allowed that he didn't think it mattered much, but that he chose Warsaw while
Herr Rehbold had chosen Ukraine.
<p>
At dessert, Holmes admitted that he had not thought the convoy from Kiel to
Berlin would be seen by the readership, and that he was pleasantly surprised
that the respondents, to a man, noticed that there would be a fleet available
to transport the Sultan's emissary from Kiel to Berlin through the Baltic Sea.
<p>
We bade M. Leotard a fond farewell, hoping to see him the next time Mr. Holmes
is presented with a difficult Diplomatic problem.  One cannot help but think
that, with my friend's well-known prowess for such puzzles, such a time
is just around the corner.
