Larry Peery took this picture of us before the tournament got underway.
As the patriarch (according to Larry) of this motley crew, he had me
sit.  I am relieved (and surprised) to find that this picture doesn't
show me with three pairs of rabbit ears.  It was truly great to finally
meet all the other people who work with me on The Pouch.  If I thought
(as I did) the friendships I had with them were strong
<strong>before</strong>, I had no idea of the bonds we would form.

Larry snapped this photo of the eight participants who came from out of
the country.  The three Swedes are standing, the two Frenchmen are bearded,
Steve Cox is an Englishman, Brendan Whyte is from New Zealand, and Mark Borer
travelled from Canada.  I
myself only had the great pleasure of playing against Leif, but I witnessed
enough games to know that the diplomatic skill in the photo here is
quite impressive indeed.

<h4 align=center>The World DipCon Awards</H4>
The Rivasseau-Peery Trophy (also known as The World Dip Cup) is the
centerpiece of the awards table.  Best Country Awards (three of which
went to members of the Pouch Team, my own being a Colonial Diplomacy
award [top right]) surround the Cup.  At top left is a special award
given to Pitt, whose dedication to the game found him at the table for
23 hours in a 26 hour timespan.  Also shown are the "Golden Blade"
and "Death with Dignity" awards, and other prizes given out.

The 1994 Champion Pascal Mantegna and his successor, the 1995 Champion
Bruno-Andr&eacute; Giraudon are shown here with the World Dip Cup.
World DipCon VI was honored to have both immediate past World Champions
in attendance to very ably attempt to inscribe their names yet again
on the Cup.

<H4 align=center>A Typical Scene</H4>
Here you see Diplomats in their natural environment.  With other games
going on in the background, this lucky group is seen
gathered around the "Brase Board," the wood-mounted Diplomacy board expertly
created by Pouch-lover Ry4an Brase (standing, in black shirt).  Brase was
convinced to attend by none other than yours truly.  He and the friends
he brought with him (who formed a team for the Team Competition and named
it "Those Damn Irresponsible Teenagers") are spoken of in other articles
about the Con as the
young group who shunned the hotel route and actually slept on rollups beneath
the tables in the game room!

Early on the final day of the tournament, after the Hobby Meeting,
a group gathered to revel in a card game where the intention is to
loudly cry "Moo...!" when bad things happen to other people.  I heard
a lot of mooing, as I was the overwhelming loser!

The Pouch's very own Pitt Crandlemire, the 1996 World Diplomacy Champion,
holding the Rivasseau-Peery Trophy (the World Dip Cup).  While my own
performance was nothing to be ashamed of, I was entranced watching Pitt.
Given the length of Pitt's games, I had the good fortune to be able to
watch him in all three rounds.  Pitt is a very deserving champion, and
I am happy to egotistically claim part of the credit for inviting
him to the event (and for ruining Leif Bergman's second round chances
to take the tournament lead).

<H4 align=center>The Awards "Banquet"</H4>
Travel plans kept me (and Simon) from partaking in the sumptuous post-awards
banquet, where Pitt and the international contingent are found enjoying the
classic American celebration cuisine.

The chairmanship of World DipCon passed from Larry Peery to Leif Bergman
(chairman and master chef for World DipCon VII) with the passing of the gavel
visible on the awards table above, in front of the World DipCup.  See
you in Gotheborg, Sweden for World DipCon VII!
