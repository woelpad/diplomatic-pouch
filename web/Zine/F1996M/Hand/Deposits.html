Hello again, and welcome back to The Pouch Deposits!  We had a whole lot
of mail this time, so, in the interest of letting you read it all, I won't
take up too much of your time up here.  However, I did want to say that the
plan for this column, which was that I present a topic, go on and on about
it, and then ask for comments from the readership to be published, was
vindicated by the fine responses I received on the (repeated) topic of
build waiving.  Some of these are below, and my own take on the issue
appears beneath them.
<p>
So, with build waiving out of the way, let's see what we can do with
that other topic I presented:  unit removal.  Who can provide us with a
nice example of a unit removal that actually turned the game in someone's
favor?  Surely there are many.  However, can anyone point to a unit removal
that actually turned the game in the favor of <strong>the player who
removed the unit</strong>?  This may be a bit harder, but I hope that
someone can come up with either a real-life or a fictional example of just
such an event.
<p>
On the same topic, does anyone have a unit removal philosophy, or a "rule
of thumb" on when to remove a unit which is near home and when to remove
one that is in the far-flung reaches of the board?  This is surely
situation-specific, but any thoughts on this type of thing would also be
welcome!
<p>
To make things easier, I'll even open the question up to unit
<strong>disbands</strong>.  I personally have my own pet disband, one
which I've been meaning to write a complete article about (by saying this
in print, I'm hoping it will spur me on to actually do so for an upcoming
issue of the Zine!).  Let's see if anyone steals my thunder by talking
about my favorite disband.
<p>
So there's your task.  Disbands and unit removals.  Go to it, and I look
forward to a lot of mail!
<P>
Stab you soon,

The Discussion Topic Presented in the Last Issues
</H3>
<HR>
<H3>From Etienne Brodeur (<a href=
mailto:599240@ican.net>599240@ican.net</a>)</H3>

Greetings and congrats to the Great DipPouch Editor,
<p>
     My example of build waving happened as follows:
<p>
     I was playing the English in the Colonial variant 
and had managed to occupy six centers in the first year's moves.  I therefore
doubled my units from six to twelve.
The other powers considered this to be a bit too much (I surmised), and
therefore I choose to waive a couple of my builds in the Hong Kong
and Singapore home centers.
This actually worked rather well as the Dutch and French became my allies
against Chinese agression.

<H3>From Michael Sandy (<a href=mehawk@peak.org>mehawk@peak.org</a>)</H3>
There are (at least) two categories of reasons for waiving builds.
<p>
The first is strictly tactical, either you need the flexibility
to build a fleet on a particular coast, which would take more than
a year to get there if you built in an alternate place, or the power 
in question is so large that no unit could get to the other end of 
the country in a year's time.
<p>
The other category involves diplomacy.
<p>
France may get three builds in 1901, but out of a desire to refrain 
from pressuring the Italian refrain from building in Marseilles.  Or 
recognizing that he might not get any builds anyway for a while, 
wants to preserve a means of regaining the initiative.
<p>
If the player has a feel for the long term trends, he may realize 
that he has enough units on his front now, and that the front won't 
move much with an additional unit.  However, in a year or two his 
forces will be past the bottleneck, so he'll either need a unit at 
the front then, or guarding his rear.

<p>
<strong><em>[Editor's response:  First off, thanks again to all those
who offered their comments on the build waiving topic.  The way I
see it, there are six distinct reasons to waive a build (you might
argue there are only five, since one is an amalgamation of a couple
of the others).  Some of these reasons have already come up.  I offer
my own take on each of my six reasons here.
</em>
<ol>
<li>Because you have to.  If I'm France and I'm eligible to build four
	or more new units, you can make book that I'm going to waive at least
	one of them.  (Some people don't claim this is a waived build, but an
	"unusable build," so maybe this is cheating a bit.)
<li>To avoid the wrath of others by appearing smaller than you actually
	are.  I have used this to my advantage more than once, claiming that
	my ability to build "so many" units came as a total surprise to me,
	and that "I sure don't need that many!"  Hard as it may seem to believe,
	it is the case that players tend to judge your size not by the number
	of SC's you control, but by the number of units you have on the board.
	A 5/8 power "looks" a lot more harmless than an 8/8 power, and you will
	be surprised how much of a difference this makes to your ability to
	form and maintain alliances.
<li>To enable more than one build at a specific location.  On the standard
	board, the place this is used most often is St. Petersburg.  If the
	Russian wants to attack England, he would be wise to use one of his
	two builds to set a fleet at the north coast, and wait until next year
	to build another.  This is far better for an anti-England Russian than
	to build only one fleet and use the other build in a faroff theater.
	If Russia doesn't secure another SC in the coming year, there is no
	chance that the second fleet can be built.
<li>To placate (or lull) an ally.  If you are a Russian with four builds and
	a Turkish
	alliance, you might be wise to waive the Sevastopol build.  Especially if
	you want the next build you put there to be a fleet which will stab the
	Turk, and he's just not quite far enough from his homeland yet.  I have
	got to admit I've done this as well, and used my build waive as
	indisputable evidence of my devotion to the Juggernaut alliance ("so
	you should feel very secure repositioning your Constantinople army in
	Serbia this year!")
<li>To stay on even-footing with an ally.  This is similar to the previous
	reason, but where it was more concerned with avoiding occupying a
	certain build <strong>location</strong>, here I speak of avoiding
	getting to a certain size.  This is also similar to the first reason
	I gave, but here I am less concerned with what your apparent size does
	to all the other players on the board (the prototypical example is the
	dreaded "Early Leader Syndrome") but on what it does to an ally.  As
	an (extreme) example, the two members of an alliance could simply agree
	that neither will grow larger than the other, with an "I won't build until
	you do" pact.
<li>In Payola games, there is a sound reason to waive as many builds as you
	possibly can, and that is that your units are nearly as dangerous to you
	as they are to others.  In Blind games, it may also be prudent to waive
	builds to hide your size.  For example, since France and Austria can "see"
	Munich at all times, the German might decide to better hide his
	true strength from these powers by waiving builds every so often.
</ul>
<em>
Even though the topic is now officially closed, I hope everyone feels free to
comment on my reasons and to add to the list any more that I may have
missed.]</em></strong>

Hey Manus!!
<P>
I just read the tactics section of the DP!  That was totally cool!  I
can't believe I asked you this weird question, the answer was right there in
the DP and of all things -- (the author, Matt Self, claimed) this was
<strong>your</strong> favorite

because you're easy to get a hold of and seem to know what's going on. 
This is pretty cool.

I've been using
"claim" that <strong>you</strong> wrote this variant.  If that's true I'm

<H3>From John Roberts
(<a href=mailto:jroberts@gulf.csc.UVic.CA>jroberts@gulf.csc.UVic.CA</a>)</H3>

Great article!  One thing you forgot, though - the value of Switzerland
in no-press games, as a draw proposal, as in
<pre>
   Turkey: F Bla C French A Spa - Swi
   Turkey: F Aeg C German A Swe - Swi
</pre>
Works nearly every time.  Of course, in 1900 I don't think Geneva was
the centre of international agencies it is now, so it may not have had
the same connotation then.

<H3>From Vaughn Ohlman
(<a href=mailto:vaughn.ohlman@SIL.ORG>vaughn.ohlman@SIL.ORG</a>)</H3>

You seem to have left out one very important question and discussion in 
your remarks on switzerland.  What if Switzerland, in addition to being 
passable, was a supply center!
<p>
<strong><em>[Author's response: It's an interesting point which, I admit,
I didn't consider.  How do you think it would change the effects of
Switzerland being passable from those I mentioned in my article?]</em></strong>
<p>
It seems to me, semi-newbie that I am, that if it were an SC then people
would not only be interested in going thru it to get against someone, but
also to hold onto.  Thus I would think the dynamics would be different and
people living on the other side would be a trifle safer.
<p>
I have thought of another possibility.  Switzerland could consist of two
provinces, on completely enclosed in the other.  Each could have an army in
them.  A zur (the enclosed) could always be ordered by the master to support
A Swi.  This way Switzerland is passable... but only with effort.  Thus the
standard openings... but more later!
<p>
What do you think?

<H3>From Michael Sandy (<a href=mehawk@peak.org>mehawk@peak.org</a>)</H3>

I think that a way of making Switzerland passable without 
greatly affecting the initial power balance would be
simple to design:
Switzerland is occupied by a neutral army that always holds.
<p>
<strong><em>[Author's response:
Interesting suggestion.  I see that this makes Switzerland somewhat more
difficult to enter.  However, I don't think that it addresses the problem.
At best, it just delays it a bit until one of the bordering powers can bring
two armies to bear to dislodge the Swiss neutral army.]</em></strong>
<p>
If you play with Switzerland as a supply center,  consider
the neutral unit as having one free support to hold.  This
bonus would only apply to the neutral power, not its
conqueror.
<p>
<strong><em>[Author's response:
I don't like that idea; both because of the "single-unit, strength of two"
factor and because it really just further complicates the issue.  By making
Switzerland an SC, you're now guaranteeing that someone will want to take it
and you're simply increasing the chances of an unproductive tangled border
war between FGI.]</em></strong>
<p>
Perhaps the Swiss could also be 'liberated' during the build
phase, being turned back into a neutral power.
<p>
<strong><em>[Author's response:
If you do that, what's the point in taking it?]</strong></em>
<p>
French German wars would no longer bog down, but would likely
to be a quick war, possibly with interpenetration of each
others front.
<p>
<strong><em>[Author's response:
I don't see it that way but...there's one way to find out.  Why not run a
variant game with your suggestions and see how it works out?  It would be
interesting to try it.
Thanks for your comments and feedback.  I'm glad you found the article of
interest.]</em></strong>

<H3>From Alexander K. Woo
(<a href=mailto:Alexander.K.Woo@williams.edu>Alexander.K.Woo@williams.edu</a>)
</H3>

From my experience (two Modern games), I think that
alliance with Turkey is the best option for Egypt.
<P>
Going for Turkey risks a long drawn out stalemate.  Italy can grow
quickly in the beginning, and can easily invest two fleets (and, if
Ukraine is attacking Turkey, two or three armies) in keeping the balance of
power between Turkey and Egypt.  Considering it would require at least 4
or five fleets against a strong Turkey or Egypt that is going west, this is
a very good investment for Italy.  (If Turkey had not been replaced,
this might very well have happened in 'odessa')
<P>
Allying with Turkey, on the other hand, allows you to proceed west,
generally at a rapid pace.  You have to make sure that Russia will not
attack Ukraine so that Turkey doesn't grow much more rapidly than you,
but it is generally quite safe beyond the first two years.  In an ET
alliance, Egypt builds fleets and Turkey builds armies.  War between
Egypt and Turkey requires fleets.  Ergo, Egypt has an advantage in a
future stab in about 2007.
<P>
Turkey is the real sucker in an ET alliance.  Just like France is
somewhat of a sucker in an EF alliance.
<P>
I might be off; I don't have much experience playing peripheral powers.
My strengths tend towards survival and less towards growth, so i tend to
play powers that need work to keep them alive and then pretty much grow
automatically (like Austria).

<H3>From Nate Johnston
(<a href=mailto:nmj3e@virginia.edu>nmj3e@virginia.edu</a>)</H3>

I just finished the third
installment of ICFOS played FTF with a group of friends of mine.  Quite an
interesting experience.  
<p>
Here are the openings in Game #1, played by six people.  
<p>
<center><table border>
<tr><th>Bleakh Bloc<td>		War, Mun, Par
<tr><th>Tunguska Event<td>		StP, Nor, Edi
<tr><th>Bad Actresses<td>		Spa, Nap, Gre
<tr><th>Static Klingons<td>	Bud, Sev, Kie (bounce)
<tr><th>Tetra Koi<td>		Lon, Kie (bounce), Bel
<tr><th>Thermites<td>		Tun, Kie (bounce), Ank
</table></center>
<p>
You can see that some engaged in a "sprinkle" action (Klingons, the Bloc),
but most kept to a general zone (like the Tunguska or the Actresses).  The
Klingons and Thermites had formed an alliance from the beginning, before
the drops, although most countries simply declated by fiat a general area
and stuck to it.  
<p>
The Koi were very aggressive and claimed all of Germany/Lowlands for
their own (which is why they were so heavily bounced by the others).  The
bounces cemented an alliance between the Klingons and the Thermites.
Tunguska quickly tried to take out the impaired Koi, successfully siezing
northern Russia, Scandanavia, and Endlad.  The Actresses were successful
in blocking any success from the Bloc in France, and took Italy, although
Naples fell to the Thermites in Fall 1905.  
<p>
Because of their bounces the Koi, Klingons, and thermites were at a
distinct disadvantage.  The other two were able to compensate by alliance,
but the Koi were DOA.  The Bloc was caught between the three large powers,
the Actresses, Tunguska, and Klingons/Thermites (also called the Balkan
Boys), and were not able to parlay their situation into a successful
defense, and were eventually dislodged from Trieste in 1907.  Then the
other two united against the Tunguska, who had moved up to 15 centers,
having taken Germany and stabbed to gain most of France/Iberia.
<p>
Now the Tunguska had adopted a strategy of utilizing the orbiter as much
as possible.    A Nor-Swe-Den became A Nor-ORB-Den  This was the key to
the eventual win, because the other nations failed to colonize non-SC
provinces, so a sudden beam-down of armies to Armenia, Albania, and Apulia
allowed Tunguska to take the win.
<p>
I will send you my reccolections on these games as they come to me, and if
you would like more elaboration then I would be glad to show you
transcripts of the movements, etc.  The game was a tremendous hit, being
able to play on the standard board and to play in totally random or wierd
characters.  We all loved it (including myself and my miserable
performance as the Bleakh Bloc).  The only difficulty was one rambunctious
player (the Koi).  Oh, and also the player for the Bad Actresses, who 
used photographs clipped from magazines he
brought with him and wrote an "A" or an "F" on each photgraphed forehead
to represent his units
(resulting in orders like Army Meryl Streep-Rome, Fleet Pam Anderson-Portugal;
Army Roseanne supports Fleet Goldie Hawn-Brest was one of his favorite orders).

Perhaps I may be of the "small minority that would

"most challenging game."
By your own admission, you have access to prior
knowledge of all six of the other players.
If any pair of your opponents are unfamiliar with
each other, then they will be starting with a
disadvantage in their relationships as opposed to
you. Your advantage is "unfair" in the sence that
it is derived not from skill, and is not available
equally to all players. 
<p>
Given your style of play, newbies must contend
not only with their insufficient knowlege of
the rules and tactics, but also with a "clique"
mentality where players prefer to ally with players
who they know well. Is that how we should 
encourage new players to enter our hobby.
<p>
Moreover, given your style of play, players will
take actions in one game for rewards in future games.
This will lead to "cartels" who ally in game
after game to the disadvantage of the occasional
player or anticrossplay player (like myself)
who takes each game as an entity in and of 
itself.
