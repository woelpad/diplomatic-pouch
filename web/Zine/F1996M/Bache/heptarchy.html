<b>Introduction</b>
<P>
For a while, one of my frustrations with the standard board has been the 
lack of familiarity with the places and countries involved, as the world 
of Europe in 1901 is quite remote. I have little affinity with Turkey, 
and have no idea where Galicia is, and thus moving Turkish armies into 
Galicia has less meaning than it might do! There are 2 ways to resolve 
this, one of which is to move the period of setting to a more modern 
time, as the Modern Variant has done very successfully. The other is to 
localise the map somewhat, which is what I have attempted to do in 
creating Heptarchy, restricting the map to just the British Isles. This 
produces a set of places much more likely to be familiar to myself and 
the people likely to play it, which adds an extra dimension to the play.
<P>
<b>Development</b>
<P>

The next problem was to find 7 British powers which could reasonably be 
at war with each other, and the obvious period to choose was the Dark 
Ages between the Roman Occupation and the unification of England. 
Unfortunately this is by definition a period with few records, and a lot 
of conflicting information. However, I managed to find maps of the 
Heptarchy of Britain, comprising Wessex in the south, Mercia in the 
middle, Northumbria in the north, plus East Anglia, North Wales (modern 
Wales), West Wales (modern Cornwall) and Strathclyde (bits of Scotland).
This presented one big problem, namely that Wessex was much bigger than 
the others, and West Wales was (a) confusing and (b) far too small to be 
viable. In the end I decided to tweak with history a bit, so unified 
Ireland, had it as a Great Power and turned Strathclyde into Scotland. 
East Anglia was made neutral, while the Wessex monster was split up into 
2. This last actually corresponds to moving the period back 100 years or 
so, but what to call the 2 bits was uncertain. West Wales was just too 
confusing a name, so it became Cornubia (actually a Roman title), while 
the eastern half of Wessex (the area around London) was named Anglia for 
want of anything better.
<P>
   The next problem was names of towns. Few existed at this time, and 
finding the relevant information seemed an impossible task. In the end I 
decided that using ancient names would in a way defy the object of the 
map anyway, as it would remove the familiarity aspect of the game. So the 
town names are all modern, and this is deliberate, before I get any 
letters telling me Birmingham didn't exist in the Dark Ages!
<P>
   It thus simply remained to draw the map, and get play-testing!  Here
are the <a href="heptarchy-cl.gif">color</a> and 
<a href="heptarchy-bw.gif">black-and-white</a> versions of the map.  The
black-and-white version may look better if you can't view in color, or
for for downloading and printing.
<P>
   The initial set up is as follows (colors in parentheses correspond
to the colors on the map above):
<p>
<pre>
   ANGLIA      (yellow) begins with:  A (Lon), A (Oxf), F (Dov)
   CORNUBIA    (purple) begins with:  F (Ply), A (Bri), A (Exe)
   IRELAND     (green)  begins with:  F (Dub), F (Bel), F (Crk)
   MERCIA      (blue)   begins with:  A (Bir), A (Not), F (Glo), F (Kin)
   NORTHUMBRIA (brown)  begins with:  F (New), A (Mid), A (Hul)
   SCOTLAND    (black)  begins with:  A (Edi), F (Gla), F (Abe)
   WALES       (red)    begins with:  A (Cdf), F (Swa), A (Lla)
</pre>
<P>
The board has 37 supply centres (3 more than standard) and thus 19 
centres are needed for an outright win. In the end the Dark Ages 
political map beat the modern town names for the year numbers, so the 
game begins in Spring 651. All rules are exactly as for the
standard game set-up.
<P>
<b>Features of the board</b>

<P>
The geography itself is very simple. There are no canals or double- 
coasted provinces to add extra complications, and the size of the game is 
very similar to the standard set-up, with 22 home centres (identical), 15 
neutral centres (3 more) and 90 territories in total (15 more).
<P>
This means that there is more room on the board, which seems to encourage 
more attacking play, as it's very hard indeed to set up stalemate lines 
on the board. Opinion seems to be divided about whether this is a good 
thing or not, but personally I get frustrated when standard games reach 
the stage where everyone heads straight for the usual stalemate lines and 
the game dies quickly.
<P>
I have also added some enormous sea areas round the outside of the board, 
facilitating cooperation between powers which would be a long way off 
otherwise. This is something which takes a while to get used to, Ireland 
and Scotland should beware the fact that Aberdeen to Cork is only 3 moves 
via NWG and NAO, even if it looks like the other side of the board! Also 
worth noting is that while Flanders looks like a gift for Anglia, it is 
actually 3 moves from all of Dover, King's Lynn, Newcastle and Aberdeen, 
so is actually anybody's in 652! Beware immense convoys from the other 
end of the board as well, these seem to be quite popular, although the 
"round Britain convoy" is yet to happen, prize for the first person to 
manage this!
<P>
Common misorders have been<br>
F (NSN) - Hul	(not possible, WAS is next to NYo)<br>
F (HBS) - Gla	(also not possible, NCH borders Arg)<br>
F (Dov) - Ess	(has to go to Lon or THA first if it wants to do this)
<P>
<b>Opening theory and tactical advice</b>
<P>
<dl>
<dt>
ANGLIA  - has to decide very soon whether Cornubia or Mercia is going to 
  be the bigger threat, and send the fleet in that direction.
  <P>

<dd><P><b>Openings </b> <br>
<dl><dt>
A (Lon) - Cam, A (Oxf) - War, F (Dov) - THA<br>
<dd> is an all-out against Mercia, but can leave Cornubia
 in Southampton and Portsmouth. This can be by treaty or
	simply hoping he won't move enough units to take both!
Instead
<dt>A (Lon) - Dow 
<dd> can bounce Portsmouth, but trusts Mercia more.  An additional
<dt>A (Oxf) - Cam
<dd> makes sure of 1 build (Cam), and probably 2 (Ips).
Against Cornubia
<dt>A (Lon) - Ess, A (Oxf) - Cam, F (Dov) - Sus
<dd> is useful if Cornubia wants his fleet in ECH, can get 2 
 builds and move them west after this. Vulnerable to an 
 all-out attack by Mercia.
Instead
<dt>A (Lon) - Dow 
<dd> guarantees Portsmouth, but can leave big problems against
		Mercia.
</dl>
<p><b> General</b>  <br>
<ul>
<li>Fairly strong, with the most wins so far (though this statistic
is slightly misleading as it includes games that used earlier versions of the map.)

<li>Useful to become a naval power and use Flanders as an extra base.
<li>Will 
usually end up at war with Mercia sooner or later, so it's good to 
encourage Northumbria to move south and/or Cornubia and Wales to gang up 
on Gloucester.

<li>The worst case is a firm C/M alliance - this spells trouble but Anglia 
can survive a good while on its own.
<li>Alliance with Mercia is worth considering, although yet to see a 
successful one.
</ul>
<P>
<dt>CORNUBIA
<dd>
<P><b> Openings</b> <br>
<dl><dt>
A (Exe) - Stn 
<dd>  is obvious
<dt>F (Ply) - CRS 
<dd>  is standard, leaving options on Sci if you can persuade 
                 the Welsh or Irish to let you have it/support you in.
<dt>F (Ply) - LYM, A (Bri) - Cot 
<dd>  can leave you in Por and Stn if Anglia moves north.
  is fairly standard, either to bounce the Mercian fleet,
                 attack Anglia or go for Gloucester with a Welsh 
<dt>                 A (Cdf) - Gwe
<dd> as a backup.
<dt>A (Bri) - Som, F (Ply) - CRS  
<dd>  is an ambitious attempt to get 3 builds although Som can
  still cover Bri if necessary
</dl>
<p><b> General</b><br>
<ul><li>Tough to play, a bit like Italy in standard.

<li>Getting Anglia and Mercia to scrap it out is a good idea and not normally 
too hard, but the majority of centres are out of reach in the east, so 
you need to wait a bit before helping either too much, or whoever you 
help will inevitably get too big for you to handle.
<li>In the west, you have no fleets to get into Wales at the start, although 
F (Bri) can be built in the second year. This means Wales can be an early 
threat (nasty convoys to Exmoor possible). But it can't view you as a 
serious threat and a CW alliance against Ireland is quite a possibility.
<li>On the other hand, you're the last place Ireland will go for, and if you 
can get Cdf and Swa off Wales with his help you're in a much better 
position to intervene in the east.
</ul><P>
<dt>IRELAND
<dd>
<P><b> Openings</b><br> 
<dl><dt>
F (Dub) - IRI
<dd> is obvious, to take IOM in Autumn.
<dt>F (Bel) - NCH 
<dd>seems standard, as a Scottish fleet there means you can 
		lose Bel or not get IOM. But if you get in, you can get 
		Gla or deny Scotland any builds in 651.
<dt>F (Crk) - NAO 
<dd> to try to get Heb/bounce Scotland. It seems to be a bad 
                idea to let Scotland have it, anyway, even if allied.
<dt>F (Crk) - CEL 
<dd> is another option, if Cornubia isn't demanding Sci.
<dt>F (Bel) - HBS
<dd> with the above trusts Scotland a lot, but leaves the best
                position for the S/I alliance to proceed.
</dl>
<p><b> General</b><br>
<ul><li>A bit like England in standard, although with 3 fleets it's 
   even harder to get armies onto the mainland. However, there's a
          lot more coast to aim at.
<li>Alliance with Scotland is strong - although Heb makes things tough and 
you need a fair bit of trust, with NCH being such a vital spot. In this 
case Wales is the main target, and bringing in Cornubia with the 
incentive of the Southern Welsh centres can work very well, and give a 
good convoy route onto the mainland.
<li>Another good plan is to attack Scotland with Northumbrian help, 
eliminating the trust factor in the north, and leaving an even easier 
convoy route , as armies built in Belfast can be convoyed straight to 
Str/Gla/Arg/Hig, using only 1 fleet in doing so.
<li>In general, keeping the most fleets around is a good plan. A ring of 
fleets all the way round the board is not an unrealistic proposition for 
Ireland, and is obviously quite fun!
</ul><P>
<dt>MERCIA
<dd>

<P><b> Openings</b> <br>
<dl><dt>
F (Kin) - Nrw 
<dd> is obvious
<dt>F (Glo) - Cot  
<dd> or if you're nervous of a C/W move on Glo
<dt>F (Glo) - SEV  
<dd> leaves more options, possibly a build from Bri or Cdf!  
<dt>A (Bir) - Glo  
<dd> with the above makes convoys possible as well.
<dt>A (Bir) - Her  
<dd> has also been tried, to annoy Wales.
<dt>A (Bir) - Pea
<dd> should get Manchester if Northumbria heads north.
<dt>A (Not) - SYo 
<dd> guarantees Manchester but gives Anglia a free rein.
<dt>A (Not) - War  
<dd> defends a vital area from Anglia.
<dt>A (Not) - Kin
<dd>leaves you poised for a war in the east with Anglia, does well if 
		 he's moving on Cornubia.
<dt>A (Not) - Ntn, A (Bir) - War 
<dd> can give Mercia a very good position  
 by removing Anglia from the board very swiftly!
</dl>
<p><b> General</b> <br>
<ul><li>High stress country, needs a good player but is yet to be 
    eliminated...
<li>Anglia seems to be the worst problem, and the easiest source of centres, 
and Mercia certainly seems strong in it's absence.
<li>Keeping on good terms with Wales seems like a good plan - to use its 
fleets to keep Ireland out of your hair.
<li>If you can persuade Northumbria to go for Scotland as well, you're doing 
well, as Cornubia is unlikely to attack for so little gain.
<li>Although outside factors have forced an AM alliance out of 
self-preservation, Anglia is to Mercia as Turkey is to Austria, best in 
his grave if you can manage it!
</ul><P>
<dt>NORTHUMBRIA
<dd>

<P><b> Openings</b> <br>

<dl><dt>F (New) - NSN 
<dd> grabs the vital defensive sea area, and sets off for Fla
as for the armies, the Southern Option.
A (Mid) - NYo,  A (Hul) - SYo 
<dd> can get 2 builds if Mercia doesn't go for Manchester, 
 and makes sure of no Mercians in SYo.  The Northern Option
<dt>A (Mid) - Pen, A (Hul) - NYo, 
<dd>often combined with
<dt> F (New) - Nmb  
<dd>  can also get 2 builds (Dumfries) if Scotland deems 
 Ireland to be the main threat (he can't cover Edi and go 
 for Dum) In the worst case this leaves the 652 position
 bad against an MW, but a strong Scotland is bad news.
</dl>
<p><b> General</b>  <br>
<ul><li>Has lost out to fleet attacks on NSN, but O.K. on the whole.

<li>The statistics strongly favour the Northern Option, twice it's moved 
south on Mercia, twice it's been stabbed by Scotland and been 
subsequently eliminated. With Scotland out of the way it's done well, 
either moving south then or going on against Ireland. 
<li>Important to 
realise than foreign powers can easily get into NSN if you don't cover 
it, and take up 2 of your armies to defend New and Mid, which can be 
fatal.
<li>No access to the West Coast to build fleets, so if you want to keep 
Lancaster you need to be allied with at least 1 of Wales or Ireland, 
preferably Wales...
</ul><P>
<dt>SCOTLAND
<dd>
<P><b>Openings</b>
<dl>
<dt>F (Gla) - NCH  
<dd> bouncing Ireland (q.v.) as losing NCH is a nightmare.
<dt>F (Gla) - Str  
<dd> if you trust Ireland a lot, to get the alliance going.
<dt>A (Edi) - SUp  
<dd> seems standard, to try and get Dum in 651, or 
<dt>A (Edi) - Nmb  
<dd> to annoy Northumbria if you're sure it's going to attack
<dt>F (Abe) - NWG  
<dd>
 to try for Heb, or even as a prelude to a run for Fla, or
<dt>F (Abe) - FFT  
<dd> to cover Edi from Northumbria, leaving SUp free to go
                 for Dum.
</dl>
<p><b>General</b>
<ul><li>Has proved strong, except when attacked all out by I/N.

<li>First choice plan is probably to get into Northumbria and move the armies
down through England in alliance with Ireland, it's normally quite 
possible to stab Ireland if necessary!
<li>Attacking Ireland is normally quite a possibility as well, with Welsh 
help. You need a lot of fleets, and a probable convoy to Donegal 
eventually.
<li>In the worst case, with Northumbria and Ireland at your throat, it's time 
to beg Wales or Cornubia to attack Ireland from the south, which Wales, 
at least, is probably happy to do!
</ul><P>
<dt>WALES
<dd>
<P><b>Openings</b><br>

<dl>
<dt>A (Lla) - Che  
<dd> is obvious
<dt>A (Cdf) - Pow  
<dd> is standard, to get 2 builds from Che and Liv.
<dt>A (Cdf) - H    
<dd> followed by convoy to Exmoor, sacrifices a build for
		 early progress on Cornubia.
<dt>A (Cdf) - Gwe  
<dd> to try for Gloucester/bounce Mercia and then convoy!
<dt>F (Swa) - BCH  
<dd> is also standard, for chances on Sci/convoys to Exm.
<dt>F (Swa) - Cdf  
<dd> is a statement to Mercia, followed by 
<dt>F (Cdf) - SEV
<dd> if 
		 Mercia moves out.
</dl>
<p><b>General </b> <br>
<ul><li>After much adaptation because earlier versions of the board 
   left it weak, it seems to be one of the stronger powers!
<li>Cornubia is relatively easy to attack, although is a very useful ally 
against a Scotland/Ireland alliance.
<li>Has 1st choice on the North-West centres, and can often get all 4 if 
Mercia and Northumbria are at war.
<li>Seems to do well by "sitting on the fence" and grabbing what it can, bit 
by bit. 
<li>Firm alliance with anyone (except perhaps Cornubia) unlikely, war 
with Ireland is often inevitable.
</ul>
</dl>
<P>
<b>The story so far...</b>
<P>
Heptarchy has been played 5 or 6 times now, but only 3 times on the 
present version of the board, all face to face games. These have included 
a win for Chetan Radia as Ireland, a win for me as Cornubia, and a 3-way 
draw between Anglia (Emeric Misztl), Scotland (me) and Wales (Steve 
Massey), the last 2 of these at ManorCon XIV recently. There has also 
been a slightly silly gunboat game, which didn't get very far, although 
Scotland (Paul Clayson) did get Southampton, which was about the only 
notable achievement of the game!
<P>
If anyone starts playing a game of it in any form, do let me know, I'd be 
very interested to hear results and comments from people. I will probably 
be running several email games myself come October, let me know if you'd 
like a place.
