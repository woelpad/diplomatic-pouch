	DipCon XXIX/WDC VI
</H2>
<h3 align=center>
(or How I Learned to Love Columbus)
</H3>


In this issue, I'm going to depart from my usual analytical perspective (or
what I suppose to be analytical, anyway) and, instead, give you a sort of
travelogue and commentary on DipCon XXIX/World DipCon VI, held in Columbus,
Ohio, USA from July 4th through the 7th, 1996.  My intent is threefold:  to
give those of you who've never been to a Con an idea of what goes on (and to,
incidentally,
encourage you to attend one in the future); to do a little review (OK,
<em>and</em>
a bit of analysis) on the games I played in or viewed; and, finally, to
subtly, modestly, and completely innocuously inform anyone who may not
already know (I know, hard to believe, but someone might have been in a
coma) that yours truly won the World Championship.  (OK, so maybe I could
have been a bit more subtle..;-)  I considered writing this in a formal,
staid fashion but, instead, I've decided to try to give you a more intimate
(no, not <em>that</em> intimate) idea of what I was doing, thinking, and
feeling.
I've always enjoyed reading that type of article and I hope it will give you
some better insight.
<p>
<H3>Pre-Con</H3>
I became aware of the Con about a month beforehand when Manus Hand, our
erstwhile DipPouch editor, e-mailed me and asked if I was attending.  He
directed me to Larry Peery for further info.  (Note:  when you request info
from Larry, be sure you have plenty of disk space <grin>).  After receiving the
info, I was sort of waffling on attending for several reasons.
<P>
First of all, I'd never been to a gaming convention but I had been to a
couple of science fiction and Star Trek conventions when I was in college.  My
recollection was that many of the attendees were...umm, let's be charitable
and say "strange."  (Of course, it may have been that I was the strange one
but, as my perspective is not even remotely objective and as I was not dressed
in any unusual costumes, and I actually bathed on occasion, I prefer to think
it was them.)
<P>
Second, I'd never before met anyone face-to-face who I had first come to know
via e-mail.  I was a bit nervous about doing so because, though I really
enjoyed my correspondence with the other PBEM Dippers who were going to be
there, I wasn't sure how that would come across in person.  Would they live
up to my expectations?  Would I live up to theirs?
<P>
Finally, I was concerned that I might embarrass myself in the Diplomacy
tournament.  I learned how to play Dip when I was in college, over 15 years
ago.  I played two or three face-to-face games there, then I played a couple
more over the
next two years when I was in the service (same old story -- never enough
people to play).  I was never aware of the PBM hobby, so, prior to
discovering PBEM Diplomacy in 1994, I had not played any more at all since
1982, and I had never played another FtF game.  I knew this was the World
Championship Tournament and I expected that the best players would be there.
Frankly, I didn't want to be humiliated.  More than likely, I would have
chickened out and decided not to attend but I didn't get the chance.  My
wife (who knows how much I love to play and compete and is totally
supportive) purchased non-refundable plane tickets to the Con, forcing my
hand (and those vicious rumors that she just wanted to get me out of the
house are completely untrue).

<H3>At the Con -- Day 1</H3>
Though I haven't mentioned it yet, the tournament was being held in
conjunction with Origins, the largest annual gaming convention in the US.
The Diplomacy Tournament is only a small part of the whole Con (hard to
believe, I know).  Now, Diplomacy is my first love but, when it comes to
games, I'm not monogamous, I love 'em all (I'm just a cheap slut, what can I
say?).  I didn't think there were any Dip events on the first day, so I
signed up to play in a bunch of other games.  I played Family Business in
the early a.m.  It's a card game for three to six players, set in a 1920's
mobster/gangland environment.  Quick to learn and play, decent strategy,
and lots of fun -- good filler for Dippers who get eliminated early in a
game.  I also met Manus right after that game (he actually had snuck up and
was watching me get beaten by the youngest player at the table).  I then went
to play Cosmic Encounter (I'd played it once in college and wanted to refresh
my memory).  It's fun, but lots of luck is involved and you have to be a little
twisted to enjoy the "players vote on the rules" aspect.  Manus hadn't
signed up for anything but he jumped into a pick-up game of Burp!, a new German
import from Mayfair.  I don't know anything about it but it looked like
lots of fun and Manus said he enjoyed it.  <em>[Editor's note:  I actually
won the game, but since I was a last-minute addition to an otherwise unfilled
game and hadn't actually paid for the privilege of playing, the prize went to
the second place finisher.]</em>
<P>
Manus and I then went to lunch and got our first chance to get to know each
other
except via e-mail.  It was quickly apparent that all my earlier reservations
were unfounded.  Not only was Manus as intelligent and witty in person as he
was via e-mail, he was also a regular guy, not at all like the
convention-goers I remembered from my misspent youth.  I found this to also
be true with the other PBEM Dippers I met, Simon Szykman and Jamie McQuinn.
One advantage of meeting in person was that it was easier and more natural
to discuss non-Dip subjects and we discovered that we also had a lot of
other interests in common.  We quickly felt very comfortable and I think we
were all glad that we had the opportunity to meet in person (at least I did
and they were too kind to say otherwise if they didn't feel the same way).
<P>
Over lunch, Manus told me about the Colonial Diplomacy Tournament scheduled
for that evening.  I had missed it in the Con schedule but we both signed up
for it.  I had never played Colonial Dip before, though I had been observing
Andy Schwarz's test game on the USIN judge.  The map is basically everything
east of the standard map as far as Japan and south to Indonesia.  The time
period is the late 1800's, during the last gasp of European colonial
imperialism.
There are also a few variant rules; the only significant one is the
Trans-Siberian Railroad which allows Russia to move an army east-west across
the entire expanse of Russia.
<P>
Manus and I ended up on different boards (there were a total of four, I
think).  I was playing Holland, which starts in Indonesia,  and Manus was
playing France, which starts in Southeast Asia.  Dan Mathias was GM'ing
(he, Bruce Reiff, and Larry Peery were the tournament organizers, and
Dan GM'ed all games with some assistance from Bruce).  I didn't get an
opportunity to observe any of the other games because mine, establishing a
trend for the tournament, lasted longer than any of the others.
<P>
As this was my first Colonial game, I don't feel qualified to offer an
in-depth analysis but I will hazard a few first impressions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Russia</strong>
is one of the largest starting powers and has the added advantage of
increased mobility with the TSR but the Russian player will find it
extremely difficult to avoid being the target of multiple enemies.
Japan,
China, Turkey, and Britain all have strong motivation to either contest with
Russia for neutral SC's or attack Russian SC's outright.  Worse yet for
Russia, Japan and China are well-situated to carry out a joint campaign in
the east, as are Turkey and Britain in the west.  The successful Russian
player must be a very strong diplomat.  He must either work to encourage
France and Holland to harry Japan, China, and Britain so that he may
concentrate on Turkey himself, or he must convince one member of the natural
allies in the east and west to join him against the other.

<li><strong>Japan</strong>
has a strong starting position with a map edge anchor to his north and
east.  He is most closely related to Turkey in standard Dip by virtue of
this fact, as well as the fact that he can easily be locked in to his corner
of the board with just a tiny bit of effort on the part of China, France,
and Holland.  He is dependent on an alliance with one of those powers if
he's to see any long-term growth.  The most likely candidate is Holland
since a J/H alliance has a secure east, north and south, and, in all
likelihood, could probably establish some sort of stalemate line.

<li><strong>France</strong>
has a seemingly weak and confined starting position but he has quick
access to many neutral SC's.  If the French player is able to negotiate an
alliance with Holland, he can enjoy free reign for a year or two, even if
China is not particularly friendly.  France's difficulties come once Britain
and Japan begin to expand, especially if Japan is allied with China.  His
position and access to neutral SC's gives France all the benefits of Austria
in standard Dip, however, and a reasonably good player will do well with the
power.

<li><strong>Holland</strong>
has a secure starting position with a map edge anchor to the south
and east.  He enjoys the advantages of the Japanese position without the
bottleneck problems.  However, he is limited in that his expansion route
consists primarily of sea spaces with no easy access to SC's for some
distance.  Holland must secure a strong alliance with France or Japan,
preferably both, and must negotiate access to an extra neutral SC or two so
that he may build a strong westward push.

<li><strong>China</strong>
has a challenging position as he's surrounded on all sides and, even
though he's one of the largest powers, he has a lot of ground to defend. On
the other hand, the Chinese player has easy access to a number of neutral
SC's and really only has to worry about Russia and Britain in the early
going.  If he's able to establish a strong alliance with one or the other of
those powers, he'll be well set into the mid-game and can pick and choose is
other allies and enemies.

<li><strong>Britain</strong>,
who starts primarily in India, appears to be the most favorable
starting power since he starts with more units than any other power, has
neutral territory with free SC's acting as a buffer to his east and west,
and can use the southern sea spaces to quickly move units where they're
most needed.  This strength is largely illusory, however, due to the fact
that Britain has two of his units (Fleet Hong Kong and Fleet Singapore)
immediately in harm's way.  Not only is Britain not in a position to protect
these units and SC's by himself, he has to deal with the fact that both of
these locations put those fleets within easy striking distance of Chinese,
French, and Dutch home SC's.  This is no advantage to Britain since it only
serves to make those powers uncomfortable and tend to distrust Britain.  The
British player must be a strong diplomat to overcome this obstacle and, in
fact, may be best served by writing off those SC's as a gesture of goodwill
to potential allies.

<li><strong>Turkey</strong>
has a comfortable, if uninteresting, starting position.  He is
similar to France in the standard game in that he has ready, unchallenged
access to a few neutral SC's and then must pick an enemy from among two
possible choices, Russia or Britain, if he wishes to grow further.  Since
both of these powers are likely to also be engaged elsewhere and probably
not engaged in an active alliance, Turkey has good chances at succeeding no
matter what and is thus a good prospect for an inexperienced player.  A
strong player should do very well with Turkey.
</ul>

Now that you have my initial thoughts on the Colonial variant, you must be
asking "Well, how did Pitt and Manus do?"  (Well, you <em>should</em> be asking
that.)  In my game, I established an early non-aggression pact with Japan
(which I didn't violate until he couldn't do anything about it) and a strong
alliance with France.  Russia started off poorly and looked to get the
stuffing knocked out of him early but, largely due to the fact that Turkey
was a tyro and played very ineptly, France and Japan stabbed China in the
mid-game so effectively that he was gone within two years, and Britain's
abortive northern push never got off the ground since I kept misleading him
repeatedly and he kept believing me, so Russia made an amazing comeback and
survived to share in a RFH draw.  My stab of Japan allowed me push him to
the brink of elimination.  I had no armies to stab France or try for Russia,
however, and France was tied down in a land war in China for so long that he
had no fleets to stab me.  As a result, neither of us felt that a solo was
possible and we agreed to the three-way draw.  I was fortunate enough to end up
with 14 SC's (there are 56 total and 24 are needed for a solo in the
standard victory conditions), which was enough to garner top country as
Holland.
<p>
Manus' game also ended in a three-way draw (which was the smallest
draw, there were no solos) and he won top country honors as France.  So, the
only two PBEM Dippers in the competition managed to both come out on top
playing their respective countries.  We both finished up at about 2:00 a.m.
and crashed, pending the start of the main event the next day.

<H3>At the Con - Day 2</H3>
Manus and I hooked up the next day for lunch and we were joined by Simon.
Since the first Dip event wasn't until 6:30 p.m., we had some time to kill.
I had also signed up for the Family Board Games tournament (on the
presumption that I'd need something else to do once I got eliminated early in
the Dip tourney), so I was scheduled to play Trivial Pursuit at 2:30 p.m.
(Manus and I had also played Scrabble the previous afternoon prior to the
Colonial Dip game, and we both managed a distant second to players who
eventually competed in the championship - my opponent had three (!) seven
letter words in one game!)  Manus, Simon, and I all ended up on the same
Trivial Pursuit board,
where they proceeded to dominate the game.  We ended up leaving before the
game finished in order to be on time for the Dip tourney but there's no
doubt that one of them would have won -- do yourself a favor and don't ever
play TP for money with either of those two.
<P>
We proceeded to the Dip tourney, where we hooked up with Jamie (he'd stopped
by during the TP game and wisely elected not to share in my humiliation).  I
was amazed at the number of players that showed up for the tournament.
There were 13 full boards that first night.  The championship format
consisted of three rounds, play in at least two, take your best two scores.
Scoring was based on a sliding scale where solos earned the most points,
two-ways somewhat less, three-ways significantly less, four-ways a lot less,
and so on.  SC totals also earned points, primarily as tie-breakers, since the
tourney rules allowed concession votes as well as draw votes and, thus, a
player could get a solo without actually having 18 SC's.
<P>
Aside from Manus, Simon, and Jamie, I knew nobody else at the tourney.  None
of us ended up on the same board in the first round.  (For the record, let
me note here that I'm not very good at remembering names and, since I never
expected to need to know them, I don't recall the names of most of the folks
I played with but I'll do the best I can.)  I was playing Germany.  Other
players of note in the game were Al Ray as France (who ultimately won Best
Russia for a different game), Greg Stewart as Italy (who ultimately won Best
Turkey in another game), and Jim Yerkey as Austria (who ultimately won the
Golden Blade for actions in this and another game).
<P>
The game started off fairly conservatively but it quickly became apparent
that Italy and Austria had a very strong alliance.  With a bit of help from
Russia, they effectively eliminated Turkey in just a few years (he still had
a lone fleet wandering about the Med but his homeland was lost).  I
developed a moderately solid alliance with France and a shaky one with
England.  England was played by a very inexperienced, young player and, as a
result of that (no mercy, right?) and my concerns about his intentions,
France and I stabbed him early.  We were making good headway until France
semi-stabbed me at Italy's urging.  Even more unfortunately for me, Russia,
after pacifying Turkey, decided that Germany would make a good second
target.  Fortunately, Italy stabbed France on the next turn, so France
backed off (though he continued to be a waffling, lukewarm ally for most of
the rest of the game; mostly because he had trouble believing that I could
really forgive his abortive stab).  This allowed me to mount a defense
against the Russian attack and I was even able to get England to join me in
this with his last unit.  However, England's inexperience came home to haunt
him when he supported Russia in dislodging my Fleet in NWG, even though this
forced me to retreat the fleet to EDI, England's last SC, thus eliminating
him from the game.
<P>
At that point, Spring 1905, I was down to six SC's and Russia, with ten SC's
was looming.  Things did not look very good.  I was about to be annihilated
by Russia with help from Austria.  France was under strong pressure from
Italy and Austria and was no help to me.  Then, for reasons that still
confound me but for which I am eternally grateful, Austria decided to stab
both his allies at once.  He gained a quick five SC's but he was never in
position to truly profit from it.  In fact, he never got to build all five of
those units before losing some of the SC's.  The net effect was that Russia
chose to disband units in the north which had been threatening me in order
to counter-attack Austria. At the same time, Italy pulled back, giving
France some breathing room and an avenue for expansion in the south.
<P>
I chose to play coy for a year and, instead of attacking Russia, assisted
him in his counter-attack on Austria.  This generated such a degree of trust
on his part that he moved all of his remaining northern units south to bulk
up his anti-Austrian campaign.  Of course, I couldn't let this golden
opportunity go by and I stabbed him the following year, taking three SC's.
Interestingly enough, he wasn't really unhappy about it.  He figured that he
deserved it for his earlier unprovoked attacks on me and his remaining
enmity was reserved for Austria.  Russia believed that he could have won or
shared in a draw if Austria hadn't made what he believed to be a stupid
stab.  All he asked of me was that I help eliminate Austria or, at least,
not let him share in a draw.  I, of course, agreed, which gained me an
unwavering Russian ally for the remainder of the game (even when I took more
of his SC's).
<P>
Of course, I then immediately went to Austria and explained the situation to
him, advising him that I would be willing to share a draw with him but that
it would mean that we would have to eliminate Russia first since Russia
would veto any draw vote which included Austria.  This allowed me to
continue to keep Austria focused on attacking Russia rather than trying for
a rapprochement; it also allowed me to vote against any draw proposals (all
votes were
secret) and blame Russia for the failure of the vote.  My continued nibbling
away at Russian SC's reinforced my diplomatic position with Austria and
allowed me to get into position to prevent him from taking any of the remaining
Russian SC's.
<P>
All the while this was happening, France was making slow progress against
Italy and I was giving him constant reassurance that my ultimate goal was a
GF two-way or, at worst, a GFA three-way.  He continued to be wary for several
years but, ultimately, he needed all of his units in the south and I had
been such a staunch ally that he felt that he could trust me.  Of course,
once I saw the opportunity to stab him for real gain with no chance of
reprisals, I took it.  Prior to this opportunity, I was looking for the solo
but I didn't think it was achievable.  Ultimately, I won a solo victory with
19 SC's in 1912.
<P>
Because of the significant changes of fortune throughout the game, it took
11 hours to play.  We had started at 6:30 p.m. on Friday night; we ended at
5:30 a.m. on Saturday morning.  Normally, that would be no problem.  I'd
just crash for awhile.  However, the second round of the tourney was
scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Saturday morning, only three hours away!  I wasn't
really tired, just elated.  It was at this point that Manus, my good friend
who had stayed through the whole thing hours after his game finished, first
suggested that I might have a chance at winning the championship.  I
pooh-poohed the idea, mostly because I didn't really think I had a chance
but, if I did, I wanted to maintain my competitive edge and not assume
anything.  Since we hadn't eaten all night, we grabbed a quick bite (the
Columbus Convention Center is great -- the food court was open 24 hours
a day during the Con) and then headed to our respective hotels for a brief nap.

<H3>At the Con - Day 3</H3>
After a too short nap and a quick shower, I stumbled back over to the
tourney.  Manus made it, too, as did Simon and Jamie (who both had had
something approaching a normal amount of sleep).  There were a few less
players that morning and we ended up with 11 boards.  As board assignments
were announced, Simon and I were selected to play on the same board.
Unfortunately, that round was the team championship round, and Simon, Manus,
and I were playing as the DipPouch team.  Accordingly, we were not able to
play on the same board.  I got kicked to the next board, which I didn't
think was a big deal until I saw the reactions of many of the other players
when the rest of the players for that board were announced.  There was a
collective intake of breath followed by some awed murmuring (really, I'm not
kidding).  The players of note were Edi Birsan as France (Edi is an
experienced and respected long-time Californian player), Tom Kobrin as
Turkey (Tom ultimately came in fourth in the championship), Steve Cox as
Italy (Steve is a highly-respected, experienced English player), and Bruno
Andr&eacute;-Giraurdon as Austria (Bruno was the 1995 World Champion).  Of
course, I didn't know any of this at the time.  Ignorance can be bliss.
<P>
I drew England and immediately established a strong alliance with Germany.
France made this easy because he came on very strong diplomatically, not
only urging alliance but almost mandating certain actions.  Both Germany and
I were uncomfortable with this and we sought each other out.  Early on, we
attacked France.  Unfortunately for us, Edi's reputation was well-deserved
and he managed to successfully stonewall us.  This was not a significant
problem, though, because Austria and Italy were busy jumping all over Turkey
and Russia was playing the "sit and wait to be attacked" game, though he was
engaging in mutual animosity with Austria over the fate of GAL.  Eventually,
the pressure on Turkey became too much and he stabbed Russia.  He justified
it by saying that Russia's failure to actively come to his aid was
tantamount to allying with Austria and Italy and offered to immediately pull
back if only Russia would help him.  This novel approach failed to move
Russia, who turned out to be the kind of player who, almost insanely,
replies to an attack with an all-out counter-attack and never quits, no
matter what.
<P>
I was all for this, of course, as it allowed me to continue to try to outfox
France.  I was singularly unsuccessful, however, and ultimately, France was
able to convince Italy to come to his aid.  This forced me to find another
SC so I could build another fleet and shut down a French move into MAO.
Russia had vacated STP some time previously and I just happened to have a
fleet sitting in NOR, with predictable results.  This allowed me to stop the
French/Italian threat (to me, anyway) but it had the unfortunate side-effect
of directing all of Russia's fury my way, even when I explained my reasons
for taking the SC and demonstrated that the fleet in STP was no further
threat to him (my explanations didn't work any better than Turkey's!).
I became the target of his all-out assault and Turkey was allowed to live.
<P>
At this same time, Austria moved to attack Germany.  If Russia had helped
him, it would have been a quick slide into oblivion for Germany but that
didn't happen.  However, Germany's necessary defense allowed France out of
his box.  Then, things got really complicated (it's great fun to play with
really good players because anything and everything can change at any time).
Just as France and Austria were about to do serious harm to Germany, Italy
stabbed France and Austria, grabbing three SC's.  Then, Austria jumped on board
with Turkey and they began to pound on Italy.  I chose that moment to give
my staunch but uninspired German ally the boot and grabbed two SC's from him.
I also managed to make up with France, who also grabbed a German SC.  France
headed south and I continued to fend off Russia, who was slowly making my
life miserable.  Then, Austria and Turkey decided to sneak a quick SC or two
from Russia and, all of a sudden, I was off the top of the hit list.  Russia
was forced to defend against these attacks and I promised not only not to
attack him but to actively assist him as repayment for my earlier, "foolish"
stab.  I scrupulously followed through on this commitment, including helping
him take some German SC's to cover his losses in the south  However, because
of Austria's and Turkey's skill, this alone was not enough.  I also had to
move units into PRU, LVN, BAL, and STP to support Russian units.  Further,
he had to vacate Scandinavian SC's in order to get the units south and
depend on my promise not to take them.
<P>
All this time, France was loading up on Italy, who was also being attacked
by Austria and Turkey, though not in coordination with France.  Eventually,
it became apparent that AT could make no headway against Russia so long as I
continued to support him and that Italy was going to be eliminated one way
or the other since he was facing three enemies with no allies.  At that point, I
decided that the best possible result for this game was a three-way draw.  In
order to hasten it (and ensure that I was part of it) I stabbed Russia
(taking three SC's).  I then invited Turkey to take two of the remaining Russian
SC's, with France getting the other.  Russia (who had previously, in my
opinion, voted against several draw proposals) was then eliminated and I
called for an EFT draw, which passed.  This gave me a 19 SC solo and a 12 SC
3-way for the championship.  I seriously considered calling for the draw
vote, voting against it, and then stabbing France and trying for the solo.
I decided against it because I didn't think I could manage it with the
caliber of players I was up against and I was afraid if I tried it and
failed, I might end up out of the draw.
<P>
Due to the caliber of the players in this game and the numerous stabs,
counterstabs, etc, this game took 12 hours to play.  We started at 8:30 a.m.
and ended at 8:30 p.m.  I had played 23 hours of Diplomacy in a 26 hour
period.  Still, while I was physically fatigued, I was having so much fun
and so excited at my relative success, that I wasn't really tired.  The only
downside to the length of the game was that it prevented me from playing in
the Variant Championship, which started at 6:30 p.m.  The variant was
Gunboat and Simon came in second.

<H3>At the Con - Day 4</H3>
The final round was Sunday morning at 10:30 a.m., immediately after the
DipCon annual hobby meeting which, I'm afraid, I skipped in order to
sleep.  By this time, the other payers who were in contention for the
championship knew who I was and how I had scored.  At that point, I was
leading, though there were several other players who already had solos and
only needed a two-way or another solo to beat me, as well as a number with
two-way or better three-ways who could win if they managed a solo.  I tried to
maintain a low profile and I didn't actively seek out info on other players'
status.  I wanted to continue to play as if I needed another solo to win.  I
didn't want to let up now that I believed I really had a chance.
Fortunately for me, Manus made a point of finding out what was up and
advised me as to my primary competition.  Then, the board assignments were
announced (only seven boards by this time).  As fate would have it, I was
assigned to play with the player who was in second place at that time, Leif
Bergman, an outstanding Swedish player.  Other players of note were Edi
Birsan as Italy and Don Del Grande as Turkey.  Though it was still
technically possible that other players could win, it was everyone's opinion
that our game would decide the championship, between Leif and I.
<P>
I drew Russia and started out by allying with Turkey and Italy, which, of
course, meant lights out for Austria.  As it happened, Austria was played by
the same player who had played Britain in my Colonial game and, though I
truly regretted doing it, I lied to him through my teeth just as bad in this
game as I had in that one.  He was gone by the end of 1902, which the only
ray of sunshine for me in the early game.  Leif was very busy demonstrating
that his personal reputation was well-deserved and that the Swedish
reputation for quick, decisive play was also well-deserved.  In spite of his
proclamations of friendship and desire for an ER two-way (which both he and I
knew that I didn't believe), he orchestrated an amazing EFG opening. France
headed due south with everything he had, Germany headed northeast, moving
into BAL in spring 1901 and taking DEN with an army instead, and England
took NOR with an army and moved into BAR.  That left me with the guaranteed
loss of SWE in 1902, the possible loss of STP, and a need to defend WAR
against Germany.  The French pressure on Italy limited his ability to
support me.  As if that wasn't enough, England talked Turkey into stabbing
me in Spring 1902.  I was beset on all sides and my only ally was in no
position to aid me.  I ended 1902 with four SC's, MOS, STP, WAR, and BUD.  It
looked like I was going to disappear in 1903, losing MOS and STP in the
spring, and Leif would have free rein to go for the championship.  Though he
didn't say so at the time, Manus, who was observing the game, thought I was
doomed.
<P>
My personal Dip philosophy, however, is that problems do not present
obstacles but opportunities.  The more serious the problem, the greater the
opportunity.  I used the fact that it looked as if I was history to my
advantage by showing that I was no threat to anybody in my current
condition.  I used the fact that Leif had engineered the whole thing against
him by pointing out that, if he could do that to me, the current leader for
the championship, imagine what he could do once I was gone.  I used the fact
that I had been so quickly cut down to size to indicate that I really wasn't
that good a player.  I used the fact that, though I was going out, I was
going to go hard and that I would use my remaining units to stay alive as
long as possible, even if it was only delaying the inevitable.
<P>
Do those "facts" sound contradictory?  So what?  I didn't use all of them on
each player.  Each was used judiciously with the player who I judged to be
most receptive to that particular point of view.  The important thing was
that they <strong>could</strong> be true and that each player was disposed
to believe that
they were based on my subtle and, apparently, sincere arguments.  I know it
sounds immodest as hell but, though Leif started the battle, I finished it.
I managed to convince France and Germany to turn on England, which freed
Italy up to help me put it to Turkey.  I went from three SC's in 1903 to
seven SC's
in 1906.  England was down to four SC's at that time, with French fleets
camped on his doorstep.  Turkey had a single SC, which would have fallen
the next
turn.  Italy had ten SC's but, as a precaution, I had surreptitiously
convinced Germany and France to move a few units toward him; a move which he
later said convinced him that he couldn't manage a solo and influenced him
to call for a draw vote.
<P>

Ultimately, the game ended in an EFGIRT six-way draw, which may sound silly
but, since only Leif and I were in contention for the championship, all that
mattered was the ultimate disposition of the two of us.  We had both made it
clear that we
wouldn't vote for a draw which included the other but not ourselves.  By the
time we voted for the draw, we had both come to the conclusion that neither
of us was going to be able to eliminate the other, nor were we going to let
the other get a better draw than we had earlier achieved.  The other players
knew this and that's why they voted for the draw.  I had been very happy
with my play in the earlier games but it wasn't until I stopped Leif's
drive and engineered my own comeback in this game that I truly believed that
I was worthy of the championship.  Beating the reigning World Champion,
Bruno, in
my second round game was nice but I had lots of help since most of the other
players knew of him and his skill.  By preventing a player of Leif's skill
and ability from beating me based solely on my own diplomatic skill, I felt
that I had earned any shot at the championship I might have.  As it
happened, none of the other players who had a shot were able to get the
necessary results and my  first and second round results were sufficient to win.
In addition to the 1996 World Championship, my German solo was good enough
for Best Germany, and, at the suggestion of Manus and Simon, I was also
awarded a special "Dedicated Diplomat" award for playing as many hours in as
short a time as I did.
<P>
Obviously, I was fortunate enough to enjoy a great deal of personal success
at the Con.  However, and I mean this sincerely, it would all have been
(almost) as much fun if I got eliminated in 1902 in every game.  I had a
blast meeting and playing with all the players and, especially, the
PBEM'ers.  Though there were a few not-so-pleasant characters in the crowd,
they were very few and were easily ignored.  The vast majority of the gamers
(especially the Dippers) were intelligent, mature, interesting, and fun to
be with.  The games were well-run and the Con was extremely well-organized.
I can't strongly enough encourage each of you to try to attend one.  If you
do, look me up.  I'm planning on being at as many as possible.
