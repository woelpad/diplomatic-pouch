<font size=+1>Welcome to the home of Face to Face Diplomacy on the Diplomatic Pouch.</font>

The Face-to-Face section of the Diplomatic Pouch has at times been the centrepiece
for FtF Diplomacy around the world. The site is now being redeveloped with a focus 
on maintainability - making it easy to keep the information on the site up to date. 
Part of that approach is making the site maintainable by you. So if you see something 
that's wrong, missing, out-of-date, etc, then look for a link to the "Information Manager" 
- it'll be near the top or bottom of the page. Click it, log in (or register) and fix it.
