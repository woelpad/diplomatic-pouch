			<p class="p1"><span>It's a little difficult for me to add any actual insight into the game because I got knocked off so quick.  :) </span></p>
			<p class="p2"><span>From my perspective I tried to cut non-aggresion deals with my immediate neighbors Turkey, Germany and Austria in the first year.  I figured I'd get my natural expansions and see the lay of the land the next year and figure out who I could trust in the short-term and where to focus my units.  All three of my neighbors stabbed me in the first year, and England made a strong push into Scandinavia as well.</span></p>
			<p class="p3"><span>After that it seemed like a blood-in-the-water feeding-frenzy on Russia, and then *poof*, Russia was gone.  I like to believe it was just bad luck with everyone deciding they should stab Russia, but I honestly have no idea what was coordinated in the early game and what wasn't.  Primary lesson learned was that I was waaay too laid back in communications with other players in the early round.  Even with a timid first round strategy in terms of conflict, I should have been much more communicative with the other players.</span></p>
