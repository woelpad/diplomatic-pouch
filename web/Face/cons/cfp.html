<H1 align=center>World DipCon VI</H1>
<H2 align=center>Call For Papers</H2>

The organizing committee of World DipCon VI, to be held
in Columbus, Ohio, USA in early July 1996 is calling for papers to be
published in the <i>Proceedings</i> of the event.  Contributors do not
have to attend WDC VI to have their papers included in the
<i>Proceedings</i>.  All contributions
must, in some way, pertain to the Allan Calhamer's game of Diplomacy
or the hobby devoted to this game.
<P>
     This year's WDC event will focus on:
<ul>
	<li>improving Diplomacy skills at the personal level,
	<li>promoting the game and hobby in the international
		Diplomacy community, and
	<li>adapting today's high-tech word-processing and
communication devices to hobbyist and hobby needs.
</ul>
<P>
More specifically, papers should address one or more of the following
general topics:
<ul>
	<LI>Personal Diplomacy skills development (e.g. playing the game
		Diplomacy, gamesmastering, publishing, custodial projects, etc.)
	<li>Diplomacy Hobby development (e.g., recruitment, organization,
		organizations, networking, etc.)
	<li>High-tech Diplomacy (e.g. use of computers, the Internet,
		the World Wide Web, electronic mail, etc.).
</ul>
The committee particularly seeks papers dealing with past World DipCon
events (or other, similar level Diplomacy events), and essays on
real-world diplomacy as seen from a Diplomacy hobbyist's perspective.
Prior approval should be requested for contributions on subjects such as
variant game designs, role playing exercises, etc.
<P>
Author(s) may wish to provide a working title and outline prior to
submission of the completed essay.
     Contributions may be written for the novice, intermediate, or
advanced hobbyist. Authors should indicate to the committee the
audience for which audience the contribution is written.
<P>
     Submissions may be original (preferred) or may have been previously
published in another hobby source.  If previously published, the author(s)
must submit a statement from the previous publisher that permission to
republish of the item in the <i>Proceedings of the WDC</i> is granted.
<P>
     Papers should be in English (or in a foreign language with an
English translation provided).  Papers not in English may be submitted
and the committee will attempt find a translator.  Volunteer translators
are welcome and will share any compensation on a 50-50 basis with the
author(s).
<P>
     Papers should be from 1,000 to 3,000 words, or may be lengthier with
prior approval.  Illustrations, maps, graphs, and footnotes should be
included as needed.  Any acceptable standard academic format is allowed.
Typed or computer-printed, camera ready originals (A4 or 8 1/2" by 11")
on one side of a sheet of paper are preferred.  Submissions on diskette are
acceptable, but authors should check for compatibility before sending.
Submission via e-mail is also acceptable, provided that all other rules
are followed.  Alternative formats, such as audio or video tapes may be
submitted with prior approval.
<P>
     Joint efforts by more than one author, or author and translator
are welcome.  Each author should include a short biography.
<P>
     Contributors will be compensated with free or discounted copies of
the <i>Proceedings</i>.  Additional awards or prizes may be awarded.
Selected papers may be published in other hobby publications with
compensation to be arranged.
<P>
     Author(s) wishing to submit papers for the <i>Proceedings of the
WDC</i> should notify the committee as soon as possible as to their
chosen topic and expected length, and <strong>no later than 15 May,
1996</strong>.  Final copy is due no later than <strong>1 June,
1996</strong>.
