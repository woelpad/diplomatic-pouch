<h3 align="center">What Is It?</h3>
What you can get here is the "Manusized" version of the mapit program,
and "Manusized" <tt>.ps</tt> template files.
<p>
Manusized maps incorporate two improvements over non-Manusized version:
<ol>
<li>The color maps are, well, color.  Land is brown and sea is blue.
    (The non-Manusized mapit version's color maps are black-and-white,
	with only the units colored.)

<li>The supply center dots are colored to reflect each one's current
	owner.  That is, if England owns a center, it will be shown as dark
	blue.
</ol>

<h3 align="center">How It Came To Be</h3>
I originally created this version of mapit to assist in the display of
the <a href="http://uk.diplom.org/?variant=payola">Payola variant</a> games
that I run, since it is
more common in those games to have unusual ownership situations (stuff
like Turkey owning Liverpool,
Paris, Ankara, and nothing else, despite his three units being in Ukraine,
North Africa, and Prussia).
<p>
But of course, the colored supply center dot feature is very handy even in
non-Payola games,
and so I was often urged to "release" my version to the public.
I resisted this at first because the code was kind of jammed into the
released Mapit program code
(more important, my Manusized mapit program had become incompatible with some of
the existing mapit <tt>.ps</tt> files, attempting to color all SC's, even when
it was fed <tt>.ps</tt>
files that did not know how to do so).
<p>
Enter Thomas Kuhlmann, who begged me for the code, and then helped me
make it backward compatible to the pre-existing (non-Manusized) <tt>.ps</tt> files.
At that point, the code (thanks
to Thomas) detected when you were using a Manusized map file, and only attempted
to color the supply centers if you were indeed using such a Manusized file
(the backward compatibility problem.
<h3 align="center">And Then...</h3>
Much later, as part of the development of the
<a href="http://uk.diplom.org"><font color="blue">DPjudge</font></a>, I
completely rewrote mapit (which was written in the C programming language)
in Python as a separate but integrated module for the
DPjudge.  This module, called <tt>dpmap</tt>, also serves as a standalone
executable just as the mapit program did, and this is the Manusized map-maker
program that I now have available for download here.  Over the years, with
the DPjudge's mapmaking needs growing, the Python version was enhanced, and
the C language one wasn't.  For this reason, the C code is no longer available
for download here.
<p>
The <tt>dpmap</tt>
program requires Manusized <tt>.ps</tt> files for input, so it lacks all the
parameter bells and whistles added by Thomas to the C language mapit program.
Even so, dpmap is now much more full-featured than mapit was.  I like
it much much better and you probably will too.  If you do not have a Python
interpreter to support your running it, let me know; I will put a compiled
version up here for people like you.

<h3 align="center">The Manusized Maps</h3>
By now you have gotten the idea that there is not only new code that
makes up the dpmap (Manusized mapit) program, but that (to take advantage of
the new features) you also need to feed the program a Manusized <tt>.ps</tt>
map file (that is, different from the version of the
<tt>.ps</tt> file provided with the mapit distribution).
So far, I have put together some of the Manusized color map files, and
Mario Huys
and Juho Snellman
have contributed a great many more.
For a couple of the ones I created, I just took the <tt>.ps</tt> file
distributed with standard mapit and made changes to its PostScript code. 
For some of
the others, I used -- oh geez, what is it? mapper? mapmaker? one of
those David Norman brand products -- to make a map, and then made changes to
<i>its</i> PostScript output.
<p>
What I'm saying is that if you want to create a Manusized version of
a map not listed below, one way to do so is to take the existing mapit map
and go to town with its PostScript contents.  Going to town isn't all
that hard anymore (and someday creating Manusized maps from scratch will
be very easy, thanks to programming being created, but that is all I will say).
Write me if you need to know how to Manusize a non-Manusized map, although
I freely admit that I may just refer you to
far more knowledgeable sources,
<a href="mailto:woelpad@gmail.com"><font color="blue">Mario
Huys</font></a>
and <a href="mailto:jsnell@lyseo.edu.ouka.fi"><font color="blue">Juho
Snellman</font></a>,
who, as you will see, have created some <u>very beautiful</u> Manusized
maps -- both from pre-existing mapit maps, and also from scratch.  Thanks,
Mario and Juho!!
<p>
Okay, with no further ado, here is what you need to get yourself a
Manusized mapit.  Hold down the Shift key while clicking to save each of
these files to your disk.  Then they're all yours.  Enjoy!
