<P><b>Important Note for release 1.3</b>


<P>Version 1.3 of  DipChief adds a number of significant
new features which mean that .dip files created with older versions of DipChief cannot be opened in this release. You will receive an "Unexpected File Format" error message if you do try to open them. I have included functionality in this release which means that this won't happen in any future releases, unfortunately I did not have the foresight to do this at the start of development. Still, better late than never!
<P>The new functionality for supply centres is only
supported if you are using an updated map. The new standard.map file which
ships with 1.3.x contains the extra information. If you are using a variant map
and cannot see supply centre information (ensure that menu option View->Supply
Centres is checked) then you should contact the map creator and get an updated
map. If your <variant>.map file does not include any lines beginning with SUPPLY
then it is an old .map file.
