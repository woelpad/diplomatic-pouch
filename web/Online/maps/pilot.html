<H1>Pilot Diplomacy Map Information</H1>
Have you ever been stuck somewhere and wished you had a
Diplomacy map at hand?  Grab one of these maps for Palm PDAs.
<p>
The map is in Imageviewer format.  If you haven't shelled out
the money for Imageviewer, you can also view it with other less
functional but capable freeware Imageviewer viewers (such as 
<a href=http://www.righto.com/pilot/tv.html>TinyViewer</a>).
<p>
To view the map, download and expand the diplomacy.pdb file, and
hotsync it to your PDA.  The viewer should recognize the file.
<p>
Download map 1
<a href=diplomacy.pdb.sit.hqx>stuffed & binhexed</a> or  
<a href=diplomacy.zip>zipped</a> or try map 2 <a href=PalmMap.zip>zipped</a>.
