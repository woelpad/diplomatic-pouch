Read the instructions below and then click <a href=DipDeskPack.zip>here</a>
to download the zip file.
<p>

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Diplomacy Desktop Map is a kit to make your desktop turn into a clear, easy-to-use map.
You require a high resolution desktop (1024*768 and above should do the trick) although you can reduce
the map size for smaller resolutions.

<p>
Note also that the colors are set by the israeli diplomacy version so this might confuse people not 
used to them..
<p>

<b>SIMPLE USAGE:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Extract the zip file into a temporary directory (such as C:\TEMP).
<li>Copy the contents of the 'dipicons' directory to c:\dipicons. create it if it doesn't exist.
<li>Copy the contents of the 'desktop' directory to c:\windows\desktop or wherever you have windows
   installed.
<li>Copy the contents of the 'windows' directory to c:\windows.
<li>Set your desktop background to one of the diplomacy maps (I recommend the "old rug"), and set the 
   icons. All icons when double clicked will attempt to open d:\diplomacy\diplo.exe
</ol>
<p>
<b>"ADVANCED" USAGE:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Put the contents of the 'diplo' directory wherever you like.
<li>Follow step 4 of simple usage.
<li>Create 22 shortcuts on your desktop to whatever program(s) you like. The best is just to copy one
   shortcut 21 times.
<li>Give each shortcut the appropriate icon. It is described in the next section.
<li>Same as simple step 5.
</ol>
<p>

<b>ADDING TROOPS:</b>
<p>
<ol>
<li>Create a new shortcut on your desktop to anything you want.
<li>Right click the shortcut and choose 'properties'.
<li>Click on 'Change icon'.
<li>type the path where your icons are stored (default is c:\dipicons) and select the appropriate icon.
   The icons' names are composed as following: the first letter is the first letter in the empire name
   while the second letter is A for army and F for fleet. (e.g. c:\dipicons\RF.ico is a Russian Fleet.
<li>Give your icon a name. I recommend the initial letter of the empire and a number (e.g. R1, R2 ..)
</ol>
<p>
<b>DELETING TROOPS:</b>
<p>
heh... heh... This is an easy one.
<p>

<b>THE MAPS:</b>
<p>
All 3 maps have "israeli" colors (the israeli diplomacy version has these colors).
<ol>
<li>Normal diplomacy map. This is a good map but it might become "crowded" because of all the text.
<li>Blank diplomacy map. This is the same thing as no.1 except for no names in the map.
<li>Blank "old rug" diplomacy map. The same as no.2 but with a fancy "rug" effect and increased
   brightness which give it an "old" look and makes troops more visible and eye-catching.
</ol>
<p>
<b>CONTACT ME:</b>
<p>
I would like to give credit to the person who made the original map - but I don't know who he is since
I got this map from a friend. If you know - please tell me.
Any comments, suggestions and so on will be welcomed (if you would like to send a booby-trapped cat,
I will provide my snail mail address).
My name is Michael and my email is King_Itsik@hotmail.com
<p>

<b>WANT TO IMPROVE THIS?</b>
<p>
You may change the map, the icons and the .lnk files as long as you give me credit for the original
idea. I also request that if you leave anything from this version, you will add this readme to your
desktop pack. Thank you.
