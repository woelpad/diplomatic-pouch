I've completed work on a mapping program for win32.  Although I feel it's 
quite stable, I'm still claiming it to be beta.

There are many objectives for this project:
  - Parse complete history files, including single turn results.
    (Histories aren't more than a file of appended judge messages)
  - Graphically, and intuitively display results, nearly eliminating need
    to look at judge files.
  - Step through histories in a simple manner so as to quickly, and
    clearly become familiar with past moves. (Handy when taking over a
    power and wishing to view the aggressiveness of powers in previous
    turns.)
  - Allow for easy installment of new variant maps.
  - Allow for zooming areas of the map.

A few points which I will mention are:
  - Only standard map is provided with this release.  (Volunteers will
    hopefully build new maps :)
  - Most of the graphics are small bitmaps, and as such may be customised
    as desired.
  - I've tested the program, and it's supporting files on Win95 only, and
    as such can only guarantee it to be functional on that environment.
    Theoretically it should run on WinNT.
  - I expect to make regular updates as new ideas are suggested, and bugs
    fixed.

I welcome anyone to submit new ideas, report bugs, or generally make 
comments.

The files to download may be found by anonymous ftp at:
      Devel.diplom.org  in /pub/diplomacy/Sources
Soon: ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu   in /pub/diplomacy/Sources   (I hope :)

grab: bdmap32.txt and bdmap32.zip which contains a setup program to run.

Please, though, don't ask for support of win3.x, as this is impossible.  
(Unless you want to port it yourself :)
