<P>Welcome to the 1600 variant homepage. I&nbsp;started constructing this 
variant as a fresh newbie back in 96. The outcome was playable, but not very 
good, with among other things several home centers of different powers bordering 
each other. After I got internet in 98, I continued my work on the variant after 
having had the possibility to look at other variants and read articles on how to 
best create new variants. There is currently a testgame going on the USTR-judge 
and it's name is Prague. There are also two <A 
href="ROYALE.htm">Royale 
games</A> running on it. If you are interested in playing a PBEM game of 1600, 
please mail me. I'll start up another one as soon as I've got a few interested 
players.

<P>There are no special rules, but you should notice that the provinces of 
Ingria, Novgorod, Great Poland, Masuria, Crimea, Voronezj , Bessarabia and 
Galicia are canal provinces, making it possible to the otherwise landlocked 
powers of Poland and Russia to build fleets. Fleet movement between Galicia and 
Mazuria is not allowed. Greece, Jutland, Schleswig, Zealand, Scania and 
Mecklenburg are also canal provinces just like Denmark, Sweden, Kiel and 
Constantinopel are in standard. Switzerland is impassable. There are no 
provinces with several coasts.

<P>Here are short strategy notes for all countries. As there has only been a 
couple of real games played yet, many of my reflections may of corse be very 
wrong. 
<P><B><A name=DENMARK>DENMARK</A></B> 
<P><IMG align=left src="" width=201 height=229>Denmark is one of the four 
countries which starts with four centers/units rather than three, however the 
supplycenter in Norway is hard to defend, being rather far from Denmark proper. 
It could also be hard to find a useful thing for your Norwegian army to do. 
Denmark usually opens south in order to occupy as many German neutrals as 
possible. Denmark almost always get two builds and occasionly three making it to 
the biggest power in Europe. But Denmark often has a hard time staying in the 
top because of its vulnerable position. Many powers start the game by sending 
armies into Northern Germany, so Denmark must keep strong forces there to defend 
its posessions. After the first adjustment it is time to decide where to go 
next. There are mainly three possibilities, continue south, or try to go either 
against England or Sweden. England and Sweden are your biggest threats and it is 
hard for Denmark to prosper as long as both are strong. An Anglo-Danish-Swedish 
alliance is possible and may turn effective, but Denmark, being the power in the 
middle is the part most likely to be the victim of a stab.<BR>The army in 
Ostlandet has several possibilities depending on your relations with Sweden. A 
move to Vestlandet is often appreciated by the Swedish player, although the army 
could be used as a helping hand against Russia if moved to Troendelag 
instead.<BR><U>Suggested openings:</U><BR>Neutral: Zea - Mec, Sch - Ofr, Jyl - 
HEL, Ost Hold<BR>Anti Swedish: Zea - Mec, Sch - Ofr, Jyl - HEL, Ost - Wer 
(followed by Mec - Pom?)<BR>Pro Swedish: Zea - Mec, Sch - Ofr, Jyl - HEL, Ost - 
Ves <BR>Anti Russian: Zea - Mec, Sch - Ofr, Jyl - HEL, Ost - Tro (followed by 
Tro - Kar) 
<P><BR><B><A name=ENGLAND>ENGLAND</A></B> 
<P><IMG border=4 align=left src="" width=218 height=169>England on its islands 
are as in standard a slow starter, but a slow starter with security. The country 
often gets just one build in the form of Scotland, but with good diplomacy may 
she also secure Holland or perhaps Flanders. England has three main rivals on 
the continent: Denmark, France and Spain. You don't want these to start building 
fleets in the Atlantic. England are seldom threatened early in the game and no 
one may prevent her from getting one build. However a Spanish-French alliance 
could soon be devastating. <BR><BR><U>Suggested openings:</U><BR>Dutch: Ire - 
NAO, Wal - Yor, Lon - NTH (possible convoy to Holland)<BR>Anti French: Ire 
-&nbsp;NAO, Lon - ENG, Wal - Lon<BR>Anti Spanish: Ire - IRI, Lon - ENG, Wal - 
Yor<BR>Neutral: Ire - IRI, &nbsp;Lon - NTH, Wal -&nbsp;Yor 
<P><BR><B><A name=FRANCE>FRANCE</A></B> 
<P><IMG border=4 align=left src="" width=211 height=189>Many people when first 
confronted when this variant takes a quick look at France and then at the yellow 
provinces surounding it and draws the conclusion that France and Spain are 
natural enemies. That is not true. As France you may either attack Spain, ally 
it or stay neutral against it. The French-Spanish alliance is one of the most 
powerful on the board, since both parts may concentrate their forces against a 
common enemy instead of defending against eachother. A joint attack on England 
may be very effective and it is also possible to cooperate in the Mediterranean 
and in the Lowlands. The risk, except of stabs, is that the other players will 
see what is going on and cooperate against the juggernaut. If France doesn't 
ally with Spain, Flanders will often end up being a&nbsp;part of France. Far 
away from Spain, it is more like an armed neutral than a foreign home center. 
However it is hard to capture before the first adjustments unless Spain choose 
to voluntarily leave for Holland. If you ally with England against Spain you 
might get help to do so. It takes a bit of time to take Spain together with 
England but it is very possible and opens up to further cooperation in the 
Lowlands and later on in the Mediterranian. The Habsburg Empire and its mighty 
land forces is often a major threat towards France in the early midgame. Make 
sure you are prepared for it and don't have all your units in England or 
Spain.<BR><U>Suggested openings:</U><BR>Get Flanders: Par - Lor (or Par - Nrm), 
Bur - Par, Pro - Sav, Gas -&nbsp;BOB<BR>Bavarian Gambit: Par- Lor, Bur - Bav, 
Pro - Sav, Gas - BOB<BR>The Juggernaugt: Par - Lor, Bur -&nbsp;FCo, Pro - Tus!, 
Gas - BOB<BR>Neutral: Par - Fla, Pro -&nbsp;Sav, Bur hold, Gas - BOB 
<P><BR><B><A name=HABSBURG>THE HABSBURG EMPIRE</A></B> 
<P><IMG border=4 align=left src="" width=226 height=189>is the peculiar name for 
all the lands gathered under the Austrian wing of the Habsburg family. The 
Spanish royal family are also Habsburgs, but that don't disqualify an attack on 
you from them later on in the game. As the head of the Habsburg family you are 
emperor of the Holy Roman Empire. That means that you are the emperor of an 
empire involving the hole of Germany, including Flanders, Holland and northern 
Italy. Unfortunately your powers outside your own lands are limited to 
requesting that you should be served first when dinnering with your vassals. In 
order to gain real power in these&nbsp;provinces you must capture them 
militarily. The Habsburgians can not be the victims of an early attack and can 
therefore take a pair of neutrals without worrying too much. Bavaria and Venice 
may be entered the first movement, but the third build is a bit harder to find. 
You could either open north with a move to Saxony in hope of that Hesse or 
Brandenburg will be left for you, or you could go to Hungary in order to try for 
Serbia or possibly Transylvania. Clearly agressive are the openings to Bosnia or 
Slovakia. At the first adjustments the question is whether to build a fleet or 
not. <I>One</I> fleet will not give you real naval power, but you may only build 
one at a time, so perhaps you should start as soon as possible. At least you 
will get a say in the Mediterranean and it may be used to defend Venice and 
Croatia.<BR><U>Suggested openings:</U><BR>Northern: Boh - Sax, Aus - Bav, Cro - 
Ven<BR>Southern: Boh - Bav, Aus - Hun, Cro -&nbsp;Ven<BR>Anti Poland: Boh - Bav, 
Aus - Slo, Cro - Hun<BR>Anti Turkish: Cro - Bos, Aus -&nbsp;Hun, Boh - Bav<A 
name=OTTOMAN><BR><BR><B>THE OTTOMAN EMPIRE</B></A><BR><BR><IMG border=4 
align=left src="" width=339 height=226>The Ottoman empire in the 17th century 
was a colossus with feet of clay. Many areas officially under Ottoman rule were 
controlled by strong local leaders. In this variant, these areas and a few 
others have been considered neutral for map balancing purposes. Surrounded by 
neutrals, the Ottoman Empire has good chances for three builds in the first 
year. The problems is&nbsp;to keep the growth going. The country is a&nbsp;bit 
like Russia, in Standard. With long borders, the country is hard to defend. To 
that comes that newly built units has a long way to the front. As Ottoman you 
have to chose among two main strategies. You could either concentrate on fleets 
and try to sweep the Mediterranean or you could stay friendly with Spain and 
move north instead. Moving north often means invading Russia, but attacking 
Poland or Habsburg is also possible. <BR><U>Suggested openings:</U><BR>Neutral: 
Con - ION, Egy - Syr, Ana - Con<BR>Black Sea opening: Con -&nbsp;BLA, Egy - Lib, 
Ana - Arm <BR>Black Sea Serbian variation: Con - BLA, Egy - Lib, Ana - 
Con<BR>Anti Russian: Con - BLA, Egy - Syr, Ana - Arm<BR>Anti Spanish: Con - ION, 
Egy - Lib, Ana - Con 
<P><B><A name=POLAND>POLAND</A></B><BR><BR><IMG border=8 align=left src="" 
width=226 height=225>Poland is one of the two countries without coastal 
homecenters, but may with the help of the canals get fleets both in the Black 
Sea and the Baltic Sea. However building fleets will practically mean a 
declaration of war against either Sweden or the Ottoman Empire. Naval 
presence&nbsp;often have to wait until the late midgame. The first thing you 
have to work out when playing Poland is your relations with Russia. A strong 
Russian-Polish alliance against Sweden and/or the Ottoman Empire is often very 
effective, but as Poland it could also be good to ally Sweden and/or the Ottoman 
Empire against Russia and so get your back free. A third possibility is to turn 
west against Habsburg, but first make sure Russia is busy with something else. 
Poland has many opening possibilities since their units don't have to coordinate 
much. Most of them are fairly neutral:<BR><U>Suggested openings:</U><BR>Neutral: 
Gal - Tra, Lit - Cou/Maz, Maz - GPo<BR>Anti Russian: Lit -&nbsp;Tul, Maz - GPo, 
Gal - Bes<BR>Anti Swedish: Lit - Psk, Maz -&nbsp;Cou, Gal - Tra<BR>Crimean 
Gambit: Gal - Bes, Lit -&nbsp;Ukr, Maz - GPo 
<P><B><A name=RUSSIA>RUSSIA</A></B><BR><BR><IMG border=4 align=left src="" 
width=302 height=257>Russia is the second power without coastal homecenters, but 
often develops sea power. It has three potential allies/enemies in Sweden, 
Poland and the Ottoman Empire. Russia often prefers to stay friendly with all of 
them until the first adjustments, as Russia has good potentials for neutral 
growth. Four neutrals are in question: Crimea, Georgia, Azerbadjan and Central 
Asia. Out of these Russia may often secure three, but leaving her homeland open, 
when trying to secure three builds is often a mistake. Keeping Central Asia for 
later use is often a good idea. The Ottomans will often claim one of the 
neutrals and Azerbadjan is the most natural as Turkish, since it is the only one 
not bordering any Russian homecenters. The biggest early threat is a Swedish 
blitz against Novgorod and therefore may a planned standoff in Ingria or Karelia 
be beneficial. At the first adjustments, Russia must declare its intentions as a 
fleet in Novgorod practically means war against Sweden and one in Voronezj 
against the Ottomans. Only building armies on the other hand might feel 
threatening from a Polish point of view.<BR><U>Suggested 
openings:</U><BR>Karelian standoff: Nov - Kar, Mos - Ura, Vor - Geo<BR>Karelian 
standoff, Crimean variation: Nov - Kar, Mos - Ura, Vor - Cri<BR>Caukasian 
Gambit: Vor - Geo, Mos -&nbsp;Ura, Nov - Mos<BR>Dnejpr Gambit: Vor - Cri, Mos - 
Vor, Nov - Mos<BR>Anti Polish: Nov - Psk, Mos - Tul, Vor - Ukr<BR><BR><B><A 
name=SPAIN>SPAIN</A></B><BR><BR><IMG border=4 align=left src="" width=329 
height=251>Spain starts out as a scattered empire. Through marriage and conquest 
it has aquired possesions in Italy, Germany and the Lowlands. To that comes the 
New World although the New World plays no role in this variant. Spain starts 
with three armies and a fleet, but is in much a naval power and will in case it 
doesn't attack France early on probably develop mainly as a sea power. One of 
the armies start in the duchy of Naples and has the possibility to unhindered 
occupy Rome. However Naples could be threatened the first turn by an Ottoman 
move to the Ionian. As Spaniard you must strongly urge him not to enter the 
Ionian. Under all circumstances it is&nbsp;often safest to build a fleet in 
Naples during the first adjustments. The Ottoman is&nbsp;one of your major 
rivals, but it is very possible to stay friendly with him provided both parts 
move north. An early attack on France might seem tempting, but France is a hard 
nut and allying France against England will often lead to faster progress, 
althought it won't exactly help you concentrating your posessions to one part of 
the board...&nbsp;Whatever way you plan to chose, make&nbsp;sure England and 
France won't ally, because if they do, you are in trouble. The single army in 
Flanders is an interesting feature of Spain. Spain will often lose Flanders 
early on and the chance that the Spanish possesions in the Lowlands expand is 
very small. But the army will give you influence over who gets what and be an 
important tool in negotiations with France and England. In case of a 
Spanish-French alliance a fleet build in Flanders might be both possible and 
very effective against England.<BR><U>Suggested openings:</U><BR>ProFrench: Cas 
-&nbsp;Por, Ara - Gra, Fla - Hol, Nap - Rom<BR>ProEnglish: Ara - GOL, Cas - Gas, 
Fla - Par, Nap - Rom<BR>Secure Flanders: Fla - Par &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; (will effectively make sure France won't get two units 
against Flanders.)<BR>The Juggernaught: Nap - Rmg &nbsp; &nbsp; (together with 
French move Pro - Tus you may drive the Habsburgs out of Venice and save Rome 
for later use.)<BR><BR><B><A name=SWEDEN>SWEDEN</A></B><BR><BR><IMG border=4 
align=left src="" width=222 height=256>Sweden with its four units are the only 
country that is rather prepared for an early war with another great power. 
Pomerania is your most likely neutral to occupy by the first adjustments, but 
Prussia is also possible to aquire. Convoying your Svealand army to Pomerania is 
a standard opening. In the east you have two armies in Finland and Livonia ready 
to be used. A blitz against Novgorod might give you a second build, but in order 
to hold on to it and finish off Russia you need at least one allied against 
Russia as it is hard to get past Novgorod. Another option is to ally with Russia 
against Poland and open to Courland. Denmark is Sweden's arch rival and must be 
dealt with sooner or later. Later is often to prefer, since Denmark is hard to 
reach early on. Sweden can only in theory capture a Danish center before the 
first adjustments. Sweden is the country to play if you like convoys. It is 
often wise to build another fleet at the first adjustments and then you will use 
your fleets, one stationed in the Baltic Sea and one in Gulf of Bothnia, to 
convoy your armies between different fronts, or support them.<BR><U>Suggested 
openings:</U><BR>Neutral opening: Fin - Ing, Lvn - Ing, EGo - BAL, Sve -
