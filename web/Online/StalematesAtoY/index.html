<H3>Introduction </H3>

<P>
Due to the design of the Diplomacy board there are many positions
which are impregnable. If the number of supply centers within
the impregnable position is equal to or greater than the number
of units required to defend it the set-up (location of units,
supply centers defended, conditions required on opposing forces)
is known as a stalemate line.
<P>
Diplomacy players have known about stalemate lines since the earliest
days of the hobby in the early 1960s; the first stalemate lines
were published in fanzines in the mid 1960s. In the 1970s the
hobby became enamored of stalemate lines and many articles were
written investigating which positions could, or could not, be
held.
<P>
Whilst &quot;old hands&quot; find stalemate lines, articles on
stalemate lines, and discussion of stalemate lines to be exceedingly
dull and dry, novices are usually very interested by the concept
of a stalemate line. They are positively excited by questions
such as &quot;What are stalemate lines?&quot;, &quot;What is a
dynamic stalemate line&quot;, &quot;How do I construct a stalemate
line&quot;, &quot;Are there any stalemate lines holding these
centers&quot; and &quot;How do I break a stalemate line?&quot;.
<P>
In November 1993 stalemate lines appeared (again!) on <A HREF="news:rec.games.diplomacy">rec.games.diplomacy</A>.
<P>
In order to help answer questions on stalemate lines Mark Nelson
decided to produce a document on stalemate lines similar to the
<B>Diplomacy A to Z</B> and <B>Variants A to Z</B> documents.
The <B>Stalemates A to Y</B> file was born!
<P>
The <B>Stalemates A to Y</B> file contains a collection of articles
on stalemate lines. Reading this document should not only answer
your questions on stalemate lines, but it should also cure you
of your interest in them. Perhaps the most important question
that you should ask is &quot;How on earth did Mark retype all
these articles without falling to sleep in the process?&quot;.
Perhaps he enjoyed the pain and agony.

<H3>The Articles </H3>

<P>
Most of the articles reprinted here were originally collected
and edited by Mark Berch, and were published as a summary of stalemate
positions in <I>Diplomacy Digest</I>. Mark Nelson retyped all
of these articles for email distribution, and also added a few
more articles to the collection. The entire collection was later
converted to HTML for the <I>Diplomatic Pouch</I> (including the
creation of 55 maps) by Matthew Self.

<DD><I>The Gamer's Guide To Diplomacy</I> contains a chapter on
stalemate positions which is reproduced here (the book is currently
out of print, and not easily available). It defines a stalemate
position and categorizes them into six basic lines, which have
been cross-referenced to the other articles.<BR>

<P>
There are also several <A HREF="wanted.htm">missing stalemate articles</A>
that I know exist but which I don't have. Is it possible that
<I>you</I> have one of these buried deep in your Diplomacy records?
