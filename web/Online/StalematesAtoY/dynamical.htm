<P>
Last year I received a letter from Douglas Reif, dated 8th October
1973.
<P>
In it, he outlined a position he believed used a novel concept
for stalemates. In his position, certain units must be active,
as opposed to static, to maintain the stalemate. Within a few
weeks time, we agreed to call such positions &quot;dynamic&quot;
in contrast to the other &quot;static&quot; stalemates in which
all units hold or support.
<P>
A few weeks later, I spoke with John Beshera about Doug's letter.
<P>
He said he assumed dynamic stalemates are rather obvious. When
I pointed out that I was only recently aware that there were generalized
rules for formulating stalemates, he said, &quot;Well, if you
don't know about them, it is possible that almost no one does.&quot;
We then discussed the situations under which dynamic stalemates
occur.
<P>
The basic idea is somewhat simple. Normally, stalemates are achieved
by units being in places the enemy may attack and by being capable
of supporting those units, if necessary, with sufficient forces
to prevent dislodgment. In actuality, it is not mandatory to occupy
the spaces; merely preventing the enemy from doing so is sufficient.
<P>
Consider for example this static stalemate:

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<HR>
<A NAME="Position1"><IMG SRC="images/sp-1.gif" ALT="Position 1" HEIGHT="260" WIDTH="285" ALIGN="RIGHT"></A>
<H3>Position 1</H3>

<DL>
<DT>Centers:
<DD>Ank, Con, Por, Spa, Smy, Tun. (6) 
<DT>Units:
<DD>A Arm, A Con, A NAf, A Por, A Spa, F Wes. (6) 
</DL>

<P>
By ordering A Por and F Wes S Spa, this line holds when there
are no enemy fleets in the Mediterranean or Black Sea. To become
dynamic, assume Arm, Con, NAf, and Spa are vacant with the supply
centers still owned by you, and remove those units; add F Lyo,
A Smy, A Syr and A Tun. By ordering A Por and F Wes S Lyo-Spa(sc),
A Tun-NAf, A Smy-Con and A Syr-Arm, the same spaces are controlled
with the same number of units retaining the stalemate. Obviously,
whenever the enemy fails to oppose a dynamic unit, the unit reverts
to the static <I>((in its new position --- Mark Berch, Diplomacy
Digest 10--11 (April-May 1978). ))</I>. In this dynamic example,
either F Lyo-Spa(sc) or A Tun-NAf must succeed.
<P>
Often, the criteria for a dynamic stalemate are these: Look at
each unit in a static stalemate that is holding. If, behind the
stalemating power's lines, there is a vacant space bordering on
the holding unit, then the holding unit is placed in that adjacent
space, leaving the space vacant. The unit then moves to the original
space and, if necessary, is supported by the units supporting
the original position. Thus, multiple active units may be engaged
in a dynamic stalemate.
<P>
Another type of dynamic stalemate is obtained in this manner:

<BR CLEAR=ALL>
<HR>
<A NAME="Position2"><IMG SRC="images/np-1.gif" ALT="Position 2" HEIGHT="260" WIDTH="285" ALIGN="RIGHT"></A>
<H3>Position 2</H3>

<DL>
<DT>Centers:
<DD>Edi, Lvp, Lon, Por (4). 
<DT>Units:
<DD>F Mid, F NAt, F Por. (3) 
</DL>

<P>
Assuming that there are no opposing forces in the West <I>((huh?
Surely he moves North/East, as he is utterly vulnerable there
--- Mark Berch, Diplomacy Digest 10-11 (May-June 1978). ))</I>.
When F Por is removed with F Eng and F Iri added, a different
type of dynamic position is created because four units instead
of three are required to maintain the same spaces. The orders
are: F Mid-Por, F Eng and F Iri S Nat-Mid. <I>((Once again, if
an opposing fleet is present in Gas, Mid can be taken --- Mark
Berch, Diplomacy Digest 10--11 (April-May 1978). ))</I>
<P>
In the preceding dynamic stalemate, the discovery process involves
looking for units in static stalemates that border a single enemy
unit. If the unit it is supporting is bordered by two unoccupied
spaces behind the stalemate line, remove the unit on the front
line facing the single enemy; order the supporting unit into the
now vacated space; then move in another unit with support sufficient
to standoff enemy forces attacking the vacated space. Thus, this
type of dynamic stalemate evolves. In example 2, it is interesting
that when F Mid is transferred to F Eng, the same spaces are again
impregnable with three units.
<P>
The totality of dynamic positions is not something apparent to
one skilled in the refinements of tactics but are a labor of love
-- with a bit of luck and a lot of persistence.
<P>
<I>((John Beshera wrote an addendum to this. He says that &quot;in
unique situations when the support of an opposing unit is capable
of being cut&quot; a dynamic situation can require fewer units
than a comparable static position, but gives no examples. I wonder,
though: If the dynamic move is unopposed, and thus the move succeeds,
the new static position will requite the extra unit. What if you
don't have one right there? Does the line then crumble? Beshera
also states that there are positions where the stalemate must
be dynamic. The example he gives is that of <A HREF="western.htm#Position3" ><I>Western Stalemates Position 3</I></A>,
where an enemy fleet in Berlin requires A Kie-Ber. --- Mark Berch,
Diplomacy Digest 10-11 (April-May 1978). ))</I>
