<P>
Ted Holcombe recently published an article entitled &quot;<A HREF="holcombe.htm">The Holcombe Position</A>&quot;
in <I>Graustark</I> #315. To those who have been following the
stalemate articles by John J. Beshera, Robert Bryan Lipton, and
myself, Holcombe's article may seem a little confused. But then,
it was also confused when it was published in <I>Hoosier Archives</I>
#73 in May 1972, and I presume it was no better in <I>Diplophobia</I>
#93, where it was published before that.
<P>
To begin with, the passage of time has made some of the statements
as to what has been published up to this point, if you will excuse
the expression, &quot;inoperative&quot;. John Beshera published
a detailed analysis of French positions in his &quot;<A HREF="wanted.htm">Fundamental Stalemate Positions, II</A>&quot;
in <I>Wazir</I> #4 (July 1972). Robert Lipton ran his &quot;<A HREF="northern-progressive.htm">A Series of Progressive Northern Stalemate Positions</A>&quot;
in <I>Graustark</I> #268. My own &quot;<A HREF="western.htm">Western Stalemate Positions</A>&quot;
appeared recently in <I>Graustark</I> #313, and finally my &quot;<A HREF="northern.htm">Northern Stalemate Positions</A>&quot;
is due out shortly. So it can hardly now be said that nothing
has been published on his French &quot;Locked up position&quot;
or indeed that published material has been restricted to the single
English position he mentions.
<P>
As for his major line itself, there is a significant error. Two
fleets are not sufficient in general to hold the North against
an active Germany with fleet building capacity, since German fleets
in Berlin, Prussia, and Livonia, would be sufficient to dislodge
one of them in the position he mentions. For lines that do work,
the reader is referred to my &quot;<A HREF="western.htm">Western</A>&quot;
article above. That, combined with the other articles mentioned
above, provide the reader with an infinitely more comprehensive
and accurate analysis of Western stalemate positions in general
than the historical tidbit offered here.
