<P>
For all practical purposes, stalemate positions of less than 18
centers which do not include all of England or all of Turkey simply
do not exist. In finding stalemate positions for the Eastern powers
then, we must content ourselves with those including Turkey and
seek to find what other areas must be included -- and what other
areas can be safely sacrificed without risking the loss of the
stalemate.
<P>
Positions including England as well as Turkey were explored....
<I>((see &quot;<A HREF="asymmet.htm" ><I>A Progressive Series of Asymmetrical Stalemate Positions</I></A>&quot;

positions for the Eastern powers must include a portion of Italy
or a portion of Scandinavia. The former positions were.... <I>((see

extend into Italy, are dealt with here. <BR CLEAR=ALL>

<A NAME="Position1"><IMG SRC="images/eas-1.gif" ALT="Position 1" HEIGHT="260" WIDTH="285" ALIGN="RIGHT"></A>
<H3>Position 1 </H3>

<DL>
<DT>Centers:
<DD>Russia, Turkey, Scandinavia, Ber, Bud, Bul, Rum, Ser, Vie.
(16)
<DT>Units:
<DD>A Ber, A Boh, A Bud, A Bul, A Den, A Nwy, A Pru, A Rum, A
Ser, A Sil, A Vie, F Aeg, F Bal, F Bar, F Eas, F Ska. (16)
<DT>Orders:
<DD>F Bar S Nwy, F Ska S Den, F Bal S Den, A Pru S Ber, A Sil
S Boh, A Bud S Vie, A Rum S Ser, A Bul S Ser, F Eas S Aeg. 
</DL>

<P>
(Note that here and in what follows, country designations represent
home centers, Scandinavia represents Den, Nwy and Swe, and Balkans
indicates Bul, Gre, Rum and Ser.)
<P>
In terms of supply centers, this seems to be the minimal position
for holding onto a piece of Scandinavia. Improvements to 17 centers
are rather obvious. Shifting either A Pru to Mun or A Rum to Gre
and the ordering of appropriate supports holds the additional
center. Each improvement frees an extra unit which may be used,
among other things to compensate for the absence of F Bar with
armies in Swe and StP supporting Nwy. <BR CLEAR=ALL>

<HR>

<A NAME="Position2"><IMG SRC="images/eas-2.gif" ALT="Position 2" HEIGHT="260" WIDTH="285" ALIGN="RIGHT"></A>
<H3>Position 2 </H3>

<DL>
<DT>Centers:
<DD>Austria, Russia, Turkey, Balkans, Ber, Nwy, Swe. (17)
<DT>Units:
<DD>A Ber, A Boh, A Bud, A Gal, A Gre, A Nwy, A Ser, A Sil, A
Tri, A Vie, F Aeg, F Bal, F Ber, F Bot, F Eas, F Ska, F Swe. (17)
<DT>Orders:
<DD>F Bar S Nwy, F Swe S Ska, F Bot S Bal, A Sil S Ber, A Gal
S Boh, A Vie S Tri, A Bud S Tri, A Ser S Tri, F Aeg S Gre. 
</DL>

<P>
This position seems to be about minimal in terms of ownership
of Northern supply centers (i.e. those North of the North-South
boundary line running NAf-Wes-Lyo-Pie-Trl-Boh-Sil-Pru-Lvn-StP/Mos)
without giving up all of Scandinavia or going over 17 SC's. Mun
instead of Tri is held by shifting A Gal to Mun, A Tri to Bul
supporting A Mun by all neighboring units and ordering A Bud S
Vie, A Bul S Ser. <BR CLEAR=ALL>

<HR>

<A NAME="Position3"><IMG SRC="images/eas-3.gif" ALT="Position 3" HEIGHT="260" WIDTH="285" ALIGN="RIGHT"></A>
<H3>Position 3 </H3>

<DL>
<DT>Centers:
<DD>Germany, Russia, Turkey, Scandinavia, Bud, Bul, Rum, Vie.
(17)
<DT>Units:
<DD>A Boh, A Bud, A Bul, A Con, A Kie, A Mun, A Nwy, A Ruh, A
Rum, A StP, A Trl, A Vie, F Aeg, F Den, F Eas, F Hel, F Ska. (17)
<DT>Orders:
<DD>A StP S Nwy, F Ska S Nwy, F Den S Hel, A Kie S Ruh, A Mun
S Ruh, A Boh S Trl, A Vie S Trl, A Rum S Bud, A Con S Bul, F Eas
S Aeg. 
</DL>

<P>
This position appears to be about minimal in terms of ownership
of Southern centers (i.e. those South of the N-S boundary line),
again without going over 17 centers or expanding to England. To
hold Ser instead of Nwy, remove A Nwy, A Rum and A Con and replace
them with F Swe, A Fin and A Ser; A Bud and A Bul S Ser, F Swe
S Ska, A Fin S StP, and the position is again solid. Or, to hold
Ser instead of Mun, remove A Ruh, A Mun, A Trl and A Con and replace
them with F Bal, A Ber, A Sil and A Ser. Support A Kie and with
F Bal and A Ber, A Boh with A Sil, A Vie with A Bud, A Ser with
A Rum and A Bul. The new position is again unbreakable.
<P>
Slight improvements are possible with many of the positions, sometimes
freeing an additional unit. However, the above are generally minimal
for the supply centers held.
