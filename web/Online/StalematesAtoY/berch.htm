<P>
What follows are, I believe, most or all of the major stalemate
positions. I cannot guarantee that they are all there, and I would
appreciate people informing me if some important ones have been
left out. I especially cannot guarantee the accuracy of these
positions. I have no special skills in this area. I have spotted
a few obvious errors, and have inserted my corrections or comments
with the traditional double parenthesis. By and large I have stuck
with the same format as was used in the original articles, with
occasional variations for my own preferences (like Tyo for Tyrolia)
or to squeeze things into fewer lines on occasion. <I>((All of
the stalemate positions have now been converted to a common format
for ease of reference. --- Matthew Self, The Diplomatic Pouch
(December 1995).))</I>
<P>
The three major presenters of listed stalemate positions are all
represented here: Lipton, Beshera and Verheiden. While only one
Beshera article has been reprinted, this is not a reflection of
lesser output, but rather his request that only one reprinted
article be used.
<P>
There is one significant omission. Elsewhere Eric Verheiden states
that there are for all practical purposes no stalemate positions
which fail to control either all of England or all of Turkey.
John Beshera writes me that he has discovered eight positions
which control part but not all of England. I attempted to persuade
him to release these positions, but I did not succeed. Mr. Beshera
indicated to me that some additional work needed to be done on
it, and that his involvement in the hobby is right now quite minimal.
Further, he implied (but did not state) that he had a prior commitment
to John Boardman. Finally, I have never claimed to be the most
persuasive person in the world, but I cannot believe that the
hobby is better off with these things kept secret.
<P>
Some of you are going to look at this mass of boring material,
shrug and ask: What for? Who needs it? When I get near a position,
I can figure out the details then of that particular position.
First, have a good luck at the two &quot;Practical Considerations&quot;
articles by Verheiden for a good overall view of the strategic
implications of stalemate lines. Second, such complications as
these have considerable use far before you actually get to one
and even if you never meet one. For example, lets suppose it's
Spring 1903 and you're one part of the A-T alliance. The West
is in disarray -- for the moment. There's a goodly number of potential
stalemate lines that the West is capable of constructing against
you, depending on such factors as how soon they get their act
together, and the health of Italy. Rather than focusing entirely
on the acquisition of supply centers, a sharp eye must be kept
on getting to those positions sooner than the West does. If you
are quite close to the position in one area (e.g. Russia) but
quite a distance away in the Mediterranean, it behooves you to
concentrate in the Mediterranean, for if you're blocked there,
an extra center or two in Russia is going to be of little value.
Third, the knowledge that you're ahead of a stalemate position
should have a liberating effect on your strategic planning. If
you know that a given attack can at worst only lose a center or
two, but that you have a line to fall back to, then the attack
can be quite feasible and sensible, even if it does not have a
high probability of success. Finally, it can be of value if you
are planning on shortening a draw. Suppose you decide that a troublesome
minor ally does not deserve to participate in the final draw,
but are afraid that the opposing alliance will take advantage
of the situation and try to roll over you both. An examination
of the various stalemate positions should allow to evaluate the
risks involved. Likewise, if you're the minor power, you want
to maneuver yourself onto one of the essential supply centers
of a stalemate line, not a dispensable one, as the former will
make it more difficult or even impossible for you to be dispensed
with.
<P>
Knowing where the stalemate lines are is, I imagine, a little
like knowing where the bridges are in a real war. They're not
so important in and of themselves, but you <I>do</I> want to get
there before the other side does.
