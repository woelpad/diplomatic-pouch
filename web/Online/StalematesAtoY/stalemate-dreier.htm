<P>
As we all know, there really is no better way to improve at Diplomacy
than to play. There are not many independent lines of study to
pursue, as there are in Chess, that will noticeably improve your
play. But there are a few. 
<P>
I myself found that my understanding of the topology of the board,
and consequently of some large-scale structural features of games,
increased markedly when I tried some of Danny Loeb's posers. What
space borders the most other spaces? The answer helps you understand
a very important &quot;bottleneck.&quot; How many spaces border
no coastal land space? The answer drives home the importance of
sea power. Which pair(s) of spaces are connected by the largest
number of distinct sequences of different spaces? Draw the lines
to see how a locally victorious Northern power can invade the
South (or vice versa). 
<P>
Documentation of various openings and their purposes is helpful,
and those given in the <I>Gamer's Guide</I> are almost indispensable,
but treatment of issues that arise in the middle and endgames
are fewer and far between. 
<P>
There is one subject of study, initiated in the <I>Gamer's Guide</I>,
that really does help. It is the study of stalemate lines. (I
won't give the definition of stalemate lines or list the ones
given in the <I>Guide</I>, but even the reader unfamiliar with
the concept will be able to piece the idea together from what
I say below.) I found it the most useful section of the <I>Guide</I>,
and I recommend it (I believe that it was reprinted in an issue
of <I>EP</I>). But with one very notable exception, the lines
published in the <I>Guide</I> are not very &quot;practical.&quot;
By &quot;practical&quot; I mean roughly, &quot;exerting influence
on actual games.&quot; I should quickly point out that in order
to exert an influence on a game, a stalemate line does not actually
have to be formed, or even nearly formed. It is enough that at
least one player recognizes that the line <I>could</I> be formed,
even in the distant future, and takes some action based on that
recognition. For example, Germany may be tempted to try a not-very-tactically-sound
invasion of Austria fairly early in the game on the grounds that
if a certain stalemate line is not crossed early, a budding Austro-Turkish
alliance may establish it later, and the beautifully laid Franco-German
strategy will fizzle into a 4-way draw. 
<P>
The exceptional line is <A HREF="walker.htm#Position2" >Line 2</A>
in the <I>Guide</I>. It exploits the Gibraltar bottleneck with
F Mid H, F Por S Mid, F NAt S Mid; the Denmark bottleneck with
U Den H; and the StP bottleneck with F StP H, F Nwy S StP. I have
seen this position or the threat of it exert influence on several
games. Why? I suspect it's because the position, or chunks of
it, arise naturally from England's course of expansion (or that
of an alliance that includes England). The stalemating powers
do not have to plot their whole game around establishing the line;
rather, they can try for a win and fall back into the line if
things turn sour. Another reason may be that it is very simple
to visualize. Gibraltar, Denmark, and StP just <I>look</I> like
bottlenecks. So it is easy to keep the line in the back of one's
mind. 
<P>
The other lines are certainly theoretically possible, and there's
no really obvious reason why they shouldn't exert practical influence
(except for <A HREF="walker.htm#Position3" >Line 3</A>, which
is quite freakish). But in fact I've never seen them come anywhere
near fruition, and I doubt that they've exerted any influence
at all in the games I've played. 
<P>
So I'd like to add a new line to the documented ones, or rather
a few related lines. They are all not-too-distant relatives of
<I>Gamer's Guide</I> <A HREF="walker.htm#Position1" >Line 1</A>,
as it happens, but they have a very important property not possessed
by any listed lines: They hold 17 centers. By the <I>Guide's</I>
definition, a stalemate line can't hold <I>more</I> than 17 centers.
But if a line holds <I>fewer</I> than 17, then a determined power
on the other side could win even if the line is set up. The <I>Guide</I>
notices this, of course, and the rationale (and a sensible one)
is that stalemate lines can be used to stop a coalition of powers
from wiping out defenders on the other side. That's true. But
at least some of the time what you want is a sure-fire way to
stop a single power from using its momentum to win alone. If you
could set up a 17 center line, you'd be free to try your luck
at knocking off the front-runner at no risk. 
<P>
Just such a situation arose in <B>Horse</B>, a game run by Ken
Lowe's Adjudicator. The key powers were Russia (Dave Cebula),
Austria (Nick Waterson), and Turkey (me). An R/A/T coalition rolled
over Italy and Germany, then expanded out into the West via France
in the South and England in the North. In the course of the expansion,
Russia grew a bit faster than the other two allies. When we proposed
a three way draw, Russia vetoed. Dave was going to try for the
win. 
<P>
France, the only other power left, agreed to puppet for Russia,
and a quick center-count showed that if France would be able to
turn over all his centers to the Bear, Russia would have 16. 
<H3>Could he be stopped? </H3>

<P>
Here was the practical stalemate line that Nick and I worked out.

<P>
First, notice that we could be fairly secure in the following
centers: Austria (3), Balkans (4), Turkey (3), Italy (3), Tunis
(1). To prevent a Russian win, we needed 3 more. The natural candidates
were Munich (which Austria held at the time), Marseilles and Iberia
(held by me, and in any case likely prey for Turkish fleets),
and Sevastopol (if Turkey could establish a stronger Black Sea
presence than Russia could). Now stalemate cognoscenti will quickly
recognize that Munich is out of the question. It simply can't
be held from below, because it has too many Northern neighbors.
So we needed three out of the other four. 
<P>
It turns out that there is a good line that holds all four, and
one that holds Sev but not Por, as well as one that holds Por
but not Sev. In the actual game, we reached a position from which
we could guarantee a draw holding Por, and we might get Sev too,
but Russia could hold on to it if he made just the right moves.
I'll list both categories of lines. The other elements of variation
turn on whether the T/A defenders can hold Gal, and/or Mid and
Gal (in the line which holds Por). 
<P>
I'll give the Eastern and Western halves of the lines separately.

<H2>In the West </H2>

<P>
Mar must be held, and Spain. Either Wes or NAf, or, in 1 and 3,
both. Here are the variations. (As should be obvious, &quot;U&quot;
means a unit where it doesn't matter whether it's a fleet or an
army.) 
<H3>West 1: Por is not held </H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
F NAf H <BR>
F Wes S Spa <BR>
U Spa H <BR>
F Lyo S Spa <BR>

<H3>West 2: Por is held, with Mid and Gas </H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
F Mid H <BR>
F Por S Mid <BR>
F Wes S Mid <BR>
U Gas H <BR>
A Mar S Gas <BR>
F Spa(nc) S Gas (could be an army, too) <BR>
F NAf S Mid 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H3>West 3: Por is held, but neither Mid nor Gas </H3>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
F NAf H <BR>
F Wes H <BR>
F Por S Spa <BR>
U Spa H <BR>
U Mar H <BR>
U Pie S Mar (or a fleet in Lyo) 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<H2>Now the Eastern part </H2>

<P>
Tyrolia must be held, and Bohemia, and the former always supports
the latter. Budapest and Vienna are occupied, but their action
depends on whether Galicia is also occupied. [Completely irrelevant
note: has anyone else noticed that on the Conference Maps the
Ukr area is labeled &quot;Ukraina&quot;??? Do I have a rare edition,
or what?] Rumania is occupied. The rest varies. (I'll drop the
specification of unit type from here on.) 
<H3>East 1A: Gal and Sev are both held </H3>

<P>
Here are some remarks about the variations. 
<H4>1. Gas and Mid go together </H4>

<P>
I didn't list separate variations for holding Gas without Mid
or vice versa, because once one goes the other can't be held without
luck. 
<H4>2. Holding 17 </H4>

<P>
Of course, if you want to hold at exactly 17 centers, then you
have to use the East and West variations in the proper combos,
holding either Sev or Por but not both. 
<H4>3. Independence of the flanks </H4>

<P>
It is interesting, I think, that there is no interdependence between
the two halves of the board. Changing variations in the West make
no difference to the orders in the East, and vice versa. The reason
for this is pretty obvious, see the next comment. 
<H4>4. Switzerland </H4>

<P>
The importance of Switzerland is highlighted in these variations.
For one thing, it accounts for the independence of the flanks.
No unit that can influence the Western flank can also influence
the Eastern flank. Notice also that Switzerland's presence is
exploited in each flank. Marseilles needs one or no supports because
of its impassable neighbor. Tyrolia not only needs no support,
but it can offer useful support to Bohemia because the only hostile
neighbor is also one of Bohemia's (so that Munich can cut Trl
support or attack Boh, but not both). Units sitting right on the
stalemate line often cannot order useful support, but they can
when they exploit bottlenecks. (The Rum support of Sev in variation
East 1A is another example, but there the bottleneck is created
in a less obvious way.) 
<H4>5. Free Units </H4>

<P>
The line requires between 13 and 15 units. The Western lines take
6, or in West 2, 7 units. The Eastern line takes 7, or in East
1B, 8 units. So you'll have between 2 and 5 units that aren't
doing duty in your stalemate line (but 5 only if you hold both
Por and Sev). 
<H4>6. Advance and Fallback positions </H4>

<P>
Why bother listing the positions that hold Galicia? After all,
these reduce easily and without risk to positions that don't hold
it, so that when you've achieved the one you automatically achieve
the other. Similarly for the position that holds Mid and Gas;
it can fall back into a position that still holds Portugal (though
if Gas is lost, you'll need something to back up Mar). 
<P>
The reason is that having reached your stalemate position, you
don't necessarily have to accept a draw. You may want to fight
on for a 2- way draw (or even better...). After all, your side
holds half the board, why shouldn't you have a shot at wiping
out the opposition? (In <B>Horse</B> it was never really an option,
because the two allies knew that they probably couldn't pull off
the precarious 2-way draw. I guess I should mention that the actual
game was a three way draw: T/A/R). You can set up the advanced
position, use it as plateau, and there's even the chance that
the opposition won't notice that you have a fallback line and
so will expect you to protect the advanced one at all costs. That
could give you an edge. 
<HR>

Well, there you have it, my practical stalemate line. Use it in
good health. But not against me. 
<P>
I hope we'll see some more articles along these lines. A study
of bottlenecks? How to invade England? I think some thoughts on
the interface between theory and practice are long overdue.
