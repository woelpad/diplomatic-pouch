<P>
A stalemate is a position on the board which prevents any further
advance by the enemy. A stalemate line is a line of units, none
of which can be dislodged by <I>any</I> combination of opposing
attacks and supports. 
<P>
In the following commentary, a &quot;stalemate line&quot; is also
defined as follows:
<OL>
<LI>The line has not more than 17 units, holding not more than
17 centers (and not fewer centers than units).
<LI>The line is held by one or more players against an alliance
of two or more players (who would then control 17 or more centers
and units).
<LI>There are no enemy units behind the line and the enemy has
no capacity for building any such unit. 
</OL>

<P>
The first known stalemate positions were published in <I>Wild
'n Woolly</I> in 1966. Since that time, several dozen such lines
have been discovered and published. Six basic positions and some
of their variants are discussed below.
<P>
In many instances, the position will work whether a given unit
is an army or fleet. In these cases, the abbreviation &quot;U&quot;
(for &quot;unit&quot;) will be used instead of &quot;A&quot; or
&quot;F&quot;. <BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>
Discovered by Conrad von Metzke in 1966, this position uses only
10 units to hold nearly half the board (15 centers). The army
in Budapest could just as easily be in Vienna or Rumania. However,
to reduce the number of centers covered requires, paradoxically,
an increase in the number of units. There are some 13- and 14-unit
positions which can be held. (See <A HREF="#Position4">Position 4</A>
below.)

A variant of this position requires only 3 fleets:

<P>
Here 11 units still hold 15 centers. 
<P>
In these positions, the East holds all of Italy. It has been asserted
that an Eastern stalemate is impossible without all of Italy (John
Beshera, 1971), but that is a mistake. Karl Pettis and others
have since noted positions holding only part of Italy; there are
possible stalemate lines holding only Venice, or only Naples,
or Venice/Rome, Naples/Rome, or even Venice/Naples. (See <A HREF="#Position6">Position 6</A>
for an Eastern stalemate which holds no Italian centers at all.)

<P>
This was first noted by John McCallum in 1966. It uses three units
to blockade the exit from the Mediterranean. It holds four centers
(England &amp; Portugal). F NAt could be Iri or Eng.
<P>
England (or a Power that holds England) can maintain this position
indefinitely under certain circumstances. The enemy must be a
Southern Power (Austria, Italy, or Turkey). The Atlantic Powers
(France, Germany, Russia) have been eliminated or are allied.
It is not impossible to see a game stalemated like this: Assume,
for instance, two Southern Powers have overrun the board. Their
armies occupy all of Europe. However, their fleets are bottled
inside the Mediterranean and they can't get out. They hold 30
centers (15 each or perhaps 14-16 or 13-17). Neither can win without
stabbing the other. This is a powerful negotiating weapon in England's
hands. <BR CLEAR=ALL>

<P>
In a variant of this position, England can hold 8 centers with
6 units. Here Russia may still be in the game, so long as she
has no fleets in the North. In the South, the set-up is as in
<A HREF="#Position2">Position 2</A>. In the North:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
U Den H, U StP H, F Bar S StP. 
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
This position leaves England with two extra units with which to
harass the enemy, contemplate expansion, or take advantage of
stabs on the other side. It can be expanded to include France,
Iberia, Belgium, Holland, and parts of Germany. A large number
of resulting positions cover 14 to 16 centers. Many of these take
into account enemy fleets in the North. (See <A HREF="#Position5b">Position 5b</A>
for an example.)

This unusual position holds 6 centers (Turkey, Iberia, Tunis).
The enemy is presumably an Anglo-German alliance that has swept
the rest of the board. It will not hold if there is an enemy fleet
in the Black Sea or the Mediterranean.

This typical Northern position holds 14 centers. The opposition
could have fleets in StP, Swe, Bal, and/or Ber without being able
to break out. Tunis must be held or the Mediterranean would eventually
be lost. Variants of this position run up to 17 centers.

This position is one in which Russia (minus Warsaw) can stalemate
with 13 centers. Russia is the one Power which could eliminate
both England and Turkey and have fleets in both North and South:
an essential prerequisite for this position. This could also expand
(into Warsaw or Bulgaria and Rumania), or it could contract in
a number of ways.

This is the minimum contraction of <A HREF="#Position6">Position 6</A>.
One of the 4 Southern units is supplied by a center in the North.
Although Russia is virtually the only Power which can achieve
this configuration, it is now centered entirely on the two corner
powers. Of course, there can be no fleets in the North nor in
the Black Sea. (This means that the coalition Russia is facing
would be Austria/Italy.) <BR CLEAR=ALL>

<H2>The Use Of Stalemates </H2>

<P>
List of stalemate positions are tedious reading, at best. One
is tempted to ask, what good is all this? The answer may be that
a stalemate is the best alternative if you can't win or maybe
it isn't. Every individual game develops its own character. A
player's decision as to whether he is even interested in a stalemate
depends on how he feels about the game as a whole and about the
other players. Perhaps he will prefer to come in second. Perhaps
he will even prefer to be eliminated in order to help achieve
a particular result. It is silly to insist that there is any single
&quot;best&quot; goal in Diplomacy. Everyone has his own priorities
and trying to fit them all into one's own mold is small-minded.
<P>
However, an awareness of potential stalemate lines is essential
to strong play, especially in a tournament setting or postal play.
A stalemate line is a powerful position and the threat of a stalemate
is a potent diplomatic weapon. On one hand, a winning alliance
can be broken up by an opposition which can force a stalemate.
<P>
On the other hand, a small power can use her stalemate position
to bargain with the others. A strategic situation may often mean
achievement of stalemate to one side and breakthrough to the other.
Each should be willing to pay a high price for an alliance. A
small power which controls the key position may be able to bargain
quite well for herself.
<P>
Stalemates are frequently hard to arrange and are often tactically
complex (if an alliance is involved on the defensive side). For
these reasons, players may be tempted to spend more time on them
than they are worth. A stalemate is, after all, a sort of last
refuge. It is the final resort of a large power that can't win
or of one or more players who can't stop an impending victory
any other way.
<P>
Compared to a free-wheeling game where the situation is flexible,
a stalemate is dull and uninteresting. Most drawn games come about
because one faction has become &quot;entrenched&quot;. In the
final analysis, it represents the ultimate failure and breakdown
of diplomacy. Still, a stalemate is sometimes better than any
available alternative. An alter Diplomacy player should be ready
to use his knowledge of stalemates whenever necessary.
