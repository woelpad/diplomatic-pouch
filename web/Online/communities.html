<DT><a href="http://www3.sympatico.ca/mstrose/DipLinks/SCD-Wu/SCD.html">The School of Creative Destruction</a>
<DD>This group, a mix of PBEM judge and off-judge Diplomacy players is committed
to fostering a community of players who engage in high-quality competitive play.
The group stresses playing hard, playing to the end, and dedication to meeting
deadlines.  Quality control is achieved by expulsion of players who are not able
to live up to the commitments of a game.  Membership is by nomination of an
existing member.
<p>
<DT><a href=http://www.diplom.org/Email/VG/vermont.html>The Vermont Group</a>
<DD>A group of PBEM judge players that has formed a restricted-access
club which runs games that are restricted to other members. The main goal
is to have games that don't go through resignations/abandonments/replacements.
Requirements for joining the Vermont Group are simple: good standing on the

<DD>A large (about 400 playing there actively at any one time) online 
playing community that runs games by human GMs that operate through game
"forums".  The group embraces a very strong fun quotient using graphics
like flags and symbols to personalize their countries.

and developing variants. Of course standard dip games take place, too.
Games are generally (not necessarily) in german but we're happy to 
spread our own variants as well.
<p>
<dt><a href=http://go.compuserve.com/gamers?AREA=Msgs&SEC=21>Compuserve Diplomacy Forum</a>
<dd>Compuserve's Diplomacy Forum is now open to non-Compuserve subscribers. This player group has been around for quite a while, but was previously not accessible to non-subscribers.  (If you are not a compuserve subscriber, you will need a screen name to log in.  If you have registered with AOL, AOL Instant Messenger, MyNetscape or Netscape Instant Messenger, your ID should work to get you in.)
<p>
<dt><A href="http://www.ludomaniac.de">Ludomaniac</a>
