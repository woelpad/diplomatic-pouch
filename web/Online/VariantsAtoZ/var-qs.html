<P>
Ghod, do I really want my name associated with the likes of Maiden
and Thorby? It is the considered opinion of such hobby luminaries
as Richard Walkerdine and Conrad von Metzke that this variant
is unplayable (or, to me more accurate, un-GMable). This despite
the fact that Brian Creese has a run a game to conclusion, and
mine and several others' games are well on their way. The trick
is, when you find a rule which makes things awkward to GM, you
use GM fiat to remove it and replace it with an even sillier (but
easier to run) rule. It also helps if you have players who don't
really understand what's going on (or in extreme cases have never
seen the rules) as this means they're very unlikely to protest
about GMing errors.<BR>

<B>REPUBLIC I</B> <I>(Der Gravey)</I> ??/05<BR>

<P>
(1) GORDON McDONALD in <I>AC-MONG</I> 39 (June 1991)<BR>

<P>
This is a game based on the whole of Ireland with Devon, Cornwall
and south-west Wales thrown in. It doesn't depict any particular
historical event, but at the same time it is supposed to be representative
of all the conflicts which have taken place in Ireland.<BR>

<P>
The powers in the game are: Ulster, Munster, Leinster, Connaught
and Britain, Meath has been left out for playability. The games
takes place after the death of Brian Boru and starts in Winter
1015. Players may build armies, fleets and bridges from supply
points, ten points being available from each on-board supply centre;
the British having two off-board centres which provide twenty-two
supply points at the start of the game although this is reduced
to one centre by Autumn 1018 and none by the next year. Players
may also supply points to each other as part of a deal, do I get
the impression that there are traces of Diadochi in these rules?
Each unit requires seven supply points to maintain, whereas bridges
need six.<BR>

<P>
I'm not so keen on the idea of bridges. Although they did play
a part in military campaigns many of the rivers in Ireland have
fordable points. Indeed, at the battle of Boyne, 1690, William's
main thrust was across a ford a number of miles west of Grogheda
and so not far from the north of the river.<BR>

<P>
Bridges can be destroyed but a fleet may not travel directly between
territories which are separated by a river unless that river is
bridged at that point! This is because &quot;guns, men, etc&quot;
are assumed to have transferred to the land. Apart from the fact
that &quot;guns&quot; didn't exist in 1015 and any siege weaponry
available in Europe would not be part of the armoury of the forces
involved in this game, it is highly likely that a force which
has disembarked on one side of the river would find it quite easy
to ferry troops to the other side using the ships available; they
wouldn't need something the size of the Titanic!<BR>

<P>
A player who builds a bridge stands to lose two supply points
permanently if that bridge is destroyed, presumably to encourage
him to retain it rather than burn it at the first hint of danger.
As in a number of games the fleets can transform into armies on
landing. The victory condition is 14 supply centres out of a total
of 25.<BR>

<P>
The map and rules are of good quality and easy enough to understand.
However, I am not overly enthusiastic about the bridge rules and
there seems to be a slight lack of historical research and imagination
as regards the names of the land areas --- Belfast North, Belfast
South for North and South Antrim; Galway West, Galway Central
and Galway South etc all remind me of being in a train station,
but then again, if the game is playable, and it looks it, who
can complain --- it may well be a very good variant, after all
Lew Pulsipher did advise the designer.<BR>

</I>
<P>
(1) Peter Sullivan in <I>C'Est Magnifique</I> 55, July 1988.<BR>

<P>
Spotted by yours truly in the darker recesses of the UK Variant
Bank, but not ever played in Britain. The idea is that each player
has an allied African tribe. These each have one `tribal symbol'
unit (a `Sacred Rhinoceros') in Africa which supplies an additional
native Army for use in Europe. (Africa is totally separate from
the ordinary board.) If a tribal symbol is dislodged and disbanded
by the other tribes' symbols, then `the Sacred Rhinoceros has
lost his Horn' and the associated army in Europe is destroyed.
A nice `minimal change' variant with scope for unusual play.<BR>

 <B>SATRAP</B><I> (Bob Harris &amp; Steve Dunn)</I> ai01/08<BR>

<P>
(1) GORDON McDONALD in <I>Ac-Mong</I> 38 (May 1991)<BR>

<P>
A game set in Ancient Persia. The eight players represent the
Great King of Persia and the Satraps of Arachosia, Armenia, Egypt,
Lydia, Media, Sogdiana and Syria. What was a Satrap? A holder
of provincial governorship.<BR>

<P>
The map goes as far West as Thrace, the Aegean, eastern Med and
northern Egypt; as far south as Saudi Arabia, as far east as the
Indus and north to the Black Sea and the Caspian. The map isn't
of good quality, but this can be easily rectified.<BR>

<P>
The game begins in 404BC and if the Great King manages to keep
his army on the board until 397BC he wins. A Satrap wins if he
has 15 pieces on the board at any time without relying on loans
from the Great King. All players start with armies, the Great
King having one army with the addition of a start garrison at
Susa. Susa counts as four supply centres, one of which supplies
the Great King's army.<BR>

<P>
However, the Great King can only have one army on the board at
any one time and so can use the three additional centres to supply
loyal Satraps. If Susa is captured by a Satrap he can use it as
a triple supply centre.<BR>

<P>
There is also a more complex version which allows for three loyal
Satraps and four disloyal ones. The loyal Satraps have certain
restrictions imposed on them and require the permission of the
King to carry out some activities. Only the GM and the players
concerned know if they play the part of a loyal Satrap.<BR>

<P>
Victory for Satraps is similar to those mentioned previously,
although the Great King wins if no more than 8 centers are in
the hands of the disloyal Satraps. There are also optional rules
for both games where Greek Mercenaries can be used. The Satraps
of Armenia, Egypt, Lydia and Syria may use them and these are
represented by double armies which require two supply centres
to maintain.<BR>

<B>SCACCHOMACY</B> <I>(Dave Kadlecek)<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) Robert Sacks, circa 1975.<BR>

<P>
Seven players on a chess board with chess pieces and chess moves,
but with two types of players: Color (Black and White) and Men
(Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King). The two types have different
victory conditions and different powers. The colors control the
pawns and can only loan supply centers to the other players. However
the colors can give order for the pieces of the Men players; in
conflict the fewer such orders given, the more likely the Color's
orders have effect. The differing roles of the two types of players,
the loaning of supply centers and the conflict of orders create
an instant and important reason for having Diplomacy which merely
having seven players wouldn't guarantee. It might just be playable.

<P>
(1) GORDON McDONALD in <I>AC-MONG</I> 39, June 1991<BR>

<P>
On first looking at the historical background printed with these
two variants I was slightly impressed. The designer seems to have
done more than the average homework.<BR>

<P>
The game begins in 1015AD after Brian Boru has defeated the Danes
of Dublin at Clontarf, in 1014, giving his life in the process.
The eight powers are; Ulster under Maolrunuaidh of the Ui Nial,
King of the Ulaidh with his capital at Emain, near Armagh; Leinster
under Maoilsheachlainn II, son of Brian Boru, who had been elected
Ard-Righ (High King) with his capital at Dind Rig (near Carlow-on-the-Barrow);
Connact under Teige III of the White Steed, of the Ui Conor, with
the capital at Roscommon; Munster, which at this time was actually
divided between Teige, King of Thomod and Munster and Donal, King
of Desmond; Kymru (or North Wales) under the nominal rule of Prince
Conan II, although actually undergoing a Civil War; Scotland under
King Malcolm II (capital Scone); England (capital Winchester)
under King Ethelred II (the Unready) and Orkney, the Norse Earldom
of the North, under Thorinn and also King of Man and the Isles.
<BR>

<P>
With the map taking in all of Ireland, Wales, Scotland and England
west of the Pennines and north of Somerset there are effectively
four powers on each part of the board and so, not surprisingly,
the Irish Kingdoms of Meath and the remaining North Kingdoms at
Waterford, Limerick, Wexford and elsewhere have been excluded.
<BR>

<P>
In Scotice Scripti III more of the powers start with fleets, some
of the supply centers have been changed, a few provinces have
been added and the victory criterion is now 18 centers controlled
in an Autumn season for any power other than the 17 for Irish
powers or Kymru and 22 for the others as was the case in SS II.
Some of the frills such as anchorages and fleet capture have also
been removed. Both games use the Army/Fleet rules. A variant with
a difference?<BR>

<P>
<B>SCRAMBLE FOR AFRICA</B><I> (David Watts)</I> dc01/08<BR>

<P>
(1) STEVE AGAR in ??? circa September 1980<BR>

<P>
This game covers the partition of Africa between the European
powers in the 1880's, the players being England, France, Belgium,
Portugal, Spain, Italy, Boer Republic &amp; Germany. Optional
army/fleet placement is used, while the SCs are sufficiently mixed
up to provide a good opportunity for stabbing (re Game of Clans).
The eight players do not start the game on a par with each other
- England and France have four units each, while Belgium and the
Boers have only two - however this imbalance is catered for in
the SC distribution. This game is a new version of David's 1975
variant, which excluded the Boers.<BR>

<P>
(1) FRED C. DAVIS Jnr in <I>Bushwacker </I>207 (April 1989)<BR>

<P>
The heart of the rules are these: 1. When reporting the results
of a move, the GM never reports the orders submitted, but only
the *resulting position*. Players may disclose their orders to
one another, but need not tell the truth.<BR>

<P>
2. After a Spring or Fall move, the GM lists all dislodged units,
but does *not* list their legal retreat areas... If the retreat
chosen is not legal, the dislodged unit is annihilated...<BR>

<P>
This variant gives players more latitude in negotiation. If a
move fails, you may be able to deny making it. If my stab fails,
you may not know, and I can try again later. See also Stab and
Stab I<BR>

<B>SEISMIC DIPLOMACY</B> <I>(unknown)<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) Andrew Poole in <I>Outposts</I> 6, October 1981<BR>

<P>
First published in French in <I>Vortigern</I> 68, it was translated
and published in <I>Ode</I> 21. After every two normal turns of
a regular game (starting off with the standard map) + winter adjustments,
there is an additional seismic events turn, in which provinces
can be ordered to separate, connect or release, thus changing
the board. Given time then Vienna can become an island in the
Atlantic and England could gain a land frontier with Turkey. `Probably
a very good fun variant with lots of scope.'<BR>

<P>
<B>SHIFT LEFT</B> <I>(Josh Smith, 1992)<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) JOSH SMITH (31/1/93) An amusing variant using the regular
map with an altered initial setup: each country's units are shifted
one power to the left or right, starting with the same allocation
of units as that of the player being replaced. That is, Austria
starts with F(Lon), F(Edi) and A(Lpl), England starts with A(Ven),
A(Rom) and F(Nap), Italy starts with A(War), A(Mos), F(StP,nc),
F(Sev), and so on. At the start of the game, you own the centers
your units start in, but you can only build in your `traditional'
centers. For example, Austria owns Lpl/Edi/Lon but can only build
in Tri/Vie/Bud--which Austria does not yet control! Hence you,
can't build until you recapture at least one of your `proper'
supply centres. SHIFT RIGHT is the same game with shifts in the
opposite direction.<BR>

</I>
<P>
(1) MARK NELSON (26/1/93) See SHIFT LEFT for a basic description
of the game. The starting positions for Shift-Right Diplomacy
are as follows, where A -&gt; B means &quot;A's units start in
country B&quot;:<BR>

<P>
Germany -&gt; Turkey Turkey -&gt; Germany Italy -&gt; England
England -&gt; Austria Austria -&gt; France France -&gt; Russia
Russia -&gt; Italy<BR>

<P>
(Shift-Left Diplomacy shifts everyone in the opposite direction
(Germany and Turkey still just trade); just reverse the arrows
to see who starts where (or interpret A -&gt; B as &quot;B's units
start in country A&quot;).)<BR>

</I>
<P>
(1) Pete Sullivan in<I> C'Est Magnifique</I> 55, July 1988.<BR>

<P>
A.k.a Revenge of the Master Rulechanger. Quite simply, a game
in which the players can vote to change the rules. Each turn,
each player proposes a rule change. These are then voted upon,
and any that are passed by a majority vote become Rules of the
Game until further altered or rescinded. A great deal of scope
for mixing up rules from other variants, or just getting plain
silly. Nick has yet to respond to my suggestion that we should
do the voting by proper multi-member Single Transferable Vote...

(1) Robert Sacks in <I>Lord of Hosts</I> 1, November 1974.<BR>

<P>
Major rule: While a province with two coasts may have only one
unit in it, each coast is a separate space for naval combat. Case
a) Coastal Crawl allowed. Case b) (not specified) Coastal crawl
might work if one of the units is an army. Case c) &quot;Slimak's
Rule&quot; A fleet adjacent to a double-coasted province may only
support naval combat (or units) on the coast adjacent to it. Not
recommended and highly pointless.<BR>

<P>
As far as rules go this is a straight forward variant. The only
difference from the standard game is that only conflicts are published
in the game report. It is a kind of hidden movement Diplomacy.
In order to make the game more fluid players are allowed to pick
the components of their forces within limits (e.g. England can
start with three fleets) and their initial units may start in
any home province (sc or not). Although it may sound as though
a game of this would be completely blind, it's surprising how
much you can find out by noting the various conflicts across the
board. See also Seeing Is Believing and Stab I<BR>

By far the most popular of the stab series. In this variant only
contested moves are reported. Some supported orders are listed
depending on the circumstances, and all retreats; builds and disbands
are done secretly, you don't know how many centers your opponents
have!!! Hence you know who the opposition is, but not how strong
they are or where they are. See also Seeing is Believing and Stab.

This game is played on a hex map containing 83 planetary systems.
Fleets may move to adjacent planetary systems and they may also
move up to three hexes in a straight line (as in Between Galaxies
I). Every four centres owned also allows a player to build a base
which has a defensive value of one. Fleets may also be transmitted
between bases. After adjustments all fleets must be able to trace
a valid supply line back to their home centre or face elimination.

<P>
This is somewhat like `Giveaway Checkers'. You try to lose your
SCs. The first player to be eliminated is the winner. Dislodged
units must retreat *on* the board if there is an available space,
and players must build new units if the Regular rules require
a Build. Voted draws to concessions are not permitted. This is
certainly something *different*.<BR>

(2) MARK NELSON (1/9/92)<BR>

<P>
This is one of the most pointless variants around. Given seven
players who can read, the game never finishes! A good strategy
is to order 'All units hold' each season. Then no-one increased
their supply-center and no-one is eliminated!<BR>

your units our of your supply centres and then you order them
back in! If you don't attack anyone then you can't eliminate anyone!

<P>
A purely abstract variant: four players, each with one home center
connected to a fifth space. Each player may elect to order a unit
to alter space instead of moving by creating/destroying a non-supply
center space, changing supply center status of a space, or altering
consecutively, until only one player's home center exists. Interesting.

<P>
As one would expect from a Fred Davis variant a lot of research
has gone into this design. In his preface Fred complains that
other space variants are two-dimensional and thus do not recapture
the flavour of space. This variant is three-dimensional, comprising
of five hex maps placed on top of each other. The actual rules
(maps aside) are quite simple, fleets moving either by normal
space drive (one hex) or by hyperspace (up to four spaces), but
a fleet which is forced to retreat loses some of its movement
capacity and all of its combat capacity until repaired. Repairs
can be carried out at either home supply centers or bases (which
are scattered around the board and can be captured like centres).
The idea of a three-dimensional game may discourage the faint-hearted.

</I>
<P>
(1) GORDON McDONALD in <I>AC-MONG</I> 45 (April 1992)<BR>

<P>
This is a variant designed for the attacking player, Suvorov being
a famous Russian general of the 18th century, who was a strong
advocate of the offensive. The game has an amended map with only
two minor rule changes from the regular game and so should be
attractive to both variant buffs and enthusiastic dip players
alike.<BR>

<P>
The new provinces and sea area have been added in such a way as
to break up many of the traditional bottlenecks. Switzerland is
now passable, and Italy has been given the &quot;Milan&quot; redesign
to increase its options. The effect of these changes generally
is to reduce dramatically the number of stalemate lines on the
board. The increased number of spaces makes it much harder to
find units to block all possible ways into defensive positions;
a mobile counter-attacking defence is preferred to the regular
dip's trench warfare. More fluid tactically, more flexible strategically.

Archangel is added as a build centre, but not a supply centre.
There are a number of `Moses crossings' enabling armies to cross
straits without using fleets. Austria has Zara instead of Trieste,
and starts with F(ZAR). Italy has Milian instead of Venice, and
starts with A(Mil). Russia starts with F(StP), since that province
now has a single coast. Turkey has Sinope instead of Ankara, and
starts with F(SIN). Corsica and Sardinia are half supply centres
and if one holds both of them they count as one. ION touches EMS
with a fleet jump between the Aegean and the Southern Med.<BR>

An extraordinarily complicated extension to Dying Earth, or perhaps
an adaptation of the sword and sorcery madness to Diplomacy (or
perhaps the other way round?), this has to be read to be believed.
Principle changes from Dying Earth; a King, Civil Disorder when
a power has no King until a hero is converted, building heros
and wizards in lieu of units, a large list of spells with each
wizard starting with only one, duels and a number of options to
counteract each of the foregoing. Caveat emptor. I certainly don't.
