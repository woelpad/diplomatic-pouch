<P>
(1) Robert Sacks in <I>Lord of Hosts</I> 3, February 1975.<BR>

<P>
Take a standard Davis map (almost); to each province assign a
simple (1-4) revenue value; each fleet requires five points to
maintain each year, each army four (except the first four Turkish
armies which require only three points per year); allow loads,
allow accumulation, and allow accumulated treasuries to be captured.
The emphasis is on major power conflict, as there is less wealth
in the minor powers than in the standard game. As every province
has some value the game is substantially altered --- no longer
will any power meekly accept the presence of any enemy unit anywhere
on its soil, and any unit dislodged hurts. Also, the build up
of forces should be faster as each power except Turkey can afford
to build two units in Winter 1901 even if it doesn't take a single
province. Stabs should be a lot blunter, and massive. Stalemate
considerations should be very important. Interesting.<BR>

(1) Robert Sacks in <I>Lord of Hosts</I> 5, June 1975.<BR>

<P>
The first player to be completely eliminated *or* to obtain 18
centers wins. A highly amusing concept, but it could easily be
drawn!<BR>

<B>ET VOUS, COMMENT CA VA?</B> <I>(unknown)</I> (??/07)<BR>

<P>
(1) MIGUEL LAMBOTTE in <I>SOL</I> 2 (October 1990)<BR>

<P>
The Mediterranean basin in 500AD. With dangerous navigation and
the presence of sanctuaries where priests can call on the Gods
who have powers to intervene in combat.<BR>

<P>
<B>EXCALIBUR</B> <I>(Kenneth Clark)<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) JAMES NELSON in <I>SPRINGY</I> 45 (February 1991).<BR>

<P>
This is set in Britain around 500AD. Three of the players take
the natives of Britain, whilst the remaining four represent invading
Germanic tribes. A novel idea is that the invaders start on the
outside of the map and work inwards, whilst the natives must do
the opposite. There are a few special rules concerning the Germanic
tribes, but basically just a map-change variant.<BR>

<P>
<B>EXCOMMUNICATION!</B> <I>(Greg Costikyan)<BR>
</I>
<P>
Rules originally published in <I>Urf Durfal</I> 1.<BR>

<P>
(1) Robert Sacks in <I>Lord of Hosts </I>7, September 1975.<BR>

<P>
A game for nine military players (Moors, Egypt, Turks, Byzantine
Empire, Russia, England, France, Leon, Holy Roman Empire), four
religious players (two Moslem, one Orthodox and one Christian
`heretic') and one who is both (Rome). Religious players have
missions supported by religious supply centers, and win when they
have converted half the land spaces (religious supply centers
by occupation by missions; any other spaces by a convert order
by any unit); in addition religious leaders may excommunicate
a civil leader under him, putting that player into temporary civil
disorder --- however each player not under excommunication chooses
which religious player he is subject to (without changing between
Christian and Moslem); players subject to Rome cannot attack Roman
units. One of the best concept amongst variants I have seen.<BR>

<P>
(1) Robert Sacks in <I>Lord of Hosts</I> 8, December 1975.<BR>

<P>
A simple map extension including Africa and the Middle East; any
player eliminated from the original 34 centers goes into civil
disorder; Italy, Russia and Turkey get an additional home center;
Britain gets two colonial centers. And Austria, France and Germany
get one each --- units may be built in colonial centers only for
captured supply centers within three land provinces. Interesting
concepts.

<b>FALL OF EMPIRE</b><i> (Steve Doubleday)</i><BR>

<P>
(1) STEVE AGAR in <I>Spring Offensive</I> 8 (January 1993)<BR>

<P>
A five player variant, this is one of the more complex historical
variants, set in the period after the death of Alexander the Great
and covers the breakup of the Macedonian Empire. Interesting features
include taxation, looting, influence point, marriages, revolts
and schisms.<BR>

<P>
<B>FAR EAST DIPLOMACY</B> <I>(Vern Schaller, amended by Fred C.
Davis Jnr)<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) ANDREW ENGLAND in <I>Affairs of State</I> (1988).<BR>

<P>
This variant is set in the Australasian region extending on up
to Mongolia and Japan. The rules follow the standard game with
the only real change being in the nature of Ocean Spaces. Basically
they can hold an unlimited number of fleets thus allowing for
several offensive possibilities. The game is set in future (1990's)
in a world where the power of the Soviets and Americans has been
broken. The five major powers involved are Australia, Indonesia,
Vietnam, China and Japan. The new map should make for a good change
from the European theatre and the number of islands in the region
covered by the variant will bring navel operations to the fore.
<BR>

<P>
<B>FEUDAL DIPLOMACY</B> <I>(By Lewis Pulsipher)<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) ANDREW ENGLAND in <I>Affairs of State</I> (1988)<BR>

<P>
There are rule changes in this variant which make it unique, the
major one being that there are units in the game which move independently
of any of the players. These represent the Vikings, Moslems and
nomadic Asian tribes. There are no set powers in Feudal Diplomacy.
Rather players chose the location of their centres at the start
of the game with the number so chosen depending upon the number
of players involved. The map has no sea provinces but instead
has link routes between various provinces. Thus there are no fleets,
the only units in the game being the standard army and knights
which are worth two armies. Each game year has three movement
seasons and at the end of the year all units are sent into &quot;winter
quarters&quot; to be rebuilt for the coming year. At the beginning
all players are given a castle which is an immovable stronghold
with the combat value of one army. Players must protect these
jealously for once they are destroyed they can not be rebuilt.
These rules form a lack of historical accuracy. The Viking tribes,
Moslems and Byzantines were all important forces in the medieval
world yet their influence is not fully brought through in the
game. Currently there is one game in progress in The Envoy.<BR>

<P>
CRAZY MARKIE SAYS: This variant was used by Andrew for the basis
of his own Medieval Diplomacy (qv).<BR>

<B>FEUDAL DIPLOMACY II </B><I>(Dave Russell)</I><B> </B>cb36<BR>

<P>
(1) REVIEW: John Cudmore in <I>Moonlighting</I> 8, April 1990.
<BR>

<P>
Originally called `Feudal' until the Variant Bank Custodian pointed
out that Lew Pulsipher had designed an earlier game with a similar
name. Dave's design bears little resemblance and is unrelated
to the former. Feudal Dip II tries to simulate a European conflict
around the 15th century but on the standard Diplomacy board, except
for some minor changes in and around the area of Turkey. It concentrates
on two aspects, the economic side where supply centers and territories
generate GOLD to finance your armies and fleets and the use of
one-shot mercenary units to argument the strength of armies and
fortifications to offer some resistance to the above. It is very
interesting to try and judge the mix of armies and mercenaries
and also whether to sack a hard-to-hold province for a quick gain,
or perhaps to finance your armies when you are on the retreat.
Ultimately, Europe is turned into a wasteland with no rules to
regenerate sacked centres, and the game starts to slip away. Dave
mentions that he will produce another version using suggestions
from the playtesters, but unfortunately it has not materialized
yet. Never the less, this is a very good variant which simulates
the genre very well.<BR>

<B>FINAL CONFLICT</B> <I>(Tom Swider)</I> <BR>

<P>
Variant published in <I>DW </I>37<BR>

<P>
(1) BOB OLSEN in <I>MOD<BR>
</I>
<P>
This is a seven-player game played on a world-map with a larger
number of provinces and supply centers. New units include the
airplane (used in support of other units only) and the nuke (used
to blow things to smithereens). Builds can be taken in any owned
center so the game is very fluid and stalemate lines are impossible.

<B>FIVE ITALIES </B><I>(Mike Lee)</I> ug12/05<BR>

<P>
(1) MARK NELSON (1/8/92)<BR>

<P>
A variant for either those that enjoy playing Italy, or believe
that Italy gets a raw deal in the regular game. A symmetrical/total
balance game which has five Italies placed around a central Switzerland.
All starting positions are equivalent. Ran postal in the British
zines U-Bend and Smodnoc.<BR>

<P>
<B>FLINTLOCK II </B><I>(John Leeder)<BR>

Rules Originally Published in <I>Runestone</I> 77.<BR>

<P>
(1) Robert Sacks in <I>Lord of Hosts</I> 5, June 1975.<BR>

<P>
A rather interesting concept of the Anglo-French-Indian wars in
North America on a rather `stylized' map of southern-eastern Canada
and North-eastern America. There are six players: France, England
and four Indian powers which bear some historical resemblance
to the Indian Powers of the time. Victory is a majority of the
fighting strength on the board (with European Double armies counting
double); joint victory between the larger European power and the
Indian, or `native', power with the majority of the `Native' strength
is permitted. The native powers may use any land space as supply
centers, and build in any they own; their units are amphibious,
except that they may not winter on water, nor move into the North
or Mid Atlantic.<BR>

<P>
The European powers have Double armies, in addition to single
units, which require two centers for support and buildable only
in home centers; other units may be built in any settled area
(occupied for a year, not `non-arable', not ravaged by native
units) and no unit may winter in an unsettled unfortified area
(there are `build fort' and `destroy fort' orders); Fleets may
move along certain navigable water routes, but they may not winter
in the Great Lakes. Water going units may cross between Ontario
and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, and between the Upper and
Lower Peninsulas of Michigan directly (these aren't the names
used on the map). Armies and fleets along the Great Lakes have
the option of converting to one another. Finally there is a `smallpox
factor' which each European power carries around which are nice
for indiscriminately destroying the native unit that is unfortunate
enough to fight the particular DA when the factor is active. It
shows promise of interesting play.<BR>

<B>THE FOUNDATION GAME</B> <I>(Fritz Mulhauser)</I> sa01/03-07
<BR>

<P>
<I>Diplomania </I>??? (pre April 1973)<BR>

<P>
(1) STEVE AGAR in ??? circa September 1990<BR>

<P>
This game is based on Asimov's Foundation Trilogy, and includes
all the expected powers from the books -- Empire Colonies, First
Empire, First Foundation, The Mule, Second Foundation, Tazenda
and Association of Independent Traders. The board is completely
abstract and at first sight abysmally complicated -- the whole
thing is a mass of lines with sectors at the intersection of the
lines. The Second Foundation player is anonymous and is supposed
to devote all his energies in predicting moves in order to help
the First Foundation gain bonus fleets -- on top of that he has
virtually no chance of winning. Why the two Foundation players
were not combined into one player is beyond me. Hyperspace links
are possible, which messes the board about even further. First
UK publication was in Don Turnbull's ALBION/COURIER (2/4/73).
<BR>

<P>
(2) Steve Agar and James Nelson in <I>Spring Offensive</I> 19
(January 1994).<BR>

<P>
This is a seven player game based loosely on the Asimov Foundation
series, five players being separate players (Tazenda, First Empire,
Empire Colonies, Union of Worlds (The Mule) and the Association
of Independent Traders). The other two players play as a team,
one representing the First Foundation and the other being the
Second Foundation (the latter of which is off the board). The
board itself needs to be seen to be believed --- it consists of
two icosahedrons with centre points (the Trantorian Module), a
hollow icosahedron (the Kalganian Module) and a dodecahedron (the
Peripheral Module), and if you can visualise that you're a better
man than I. To begin with movement is confined to within the same
module on the map, but after three years inter-module movement
is permitted. The Second Foundation does not have units, that
player tries to predict the moves of the five individual players
and every move he correctly predicts more than 50% of the moves,
the First Foundation receives an additional unit. Overall the
rules are not too complicated, it is only the design of the map
which is off-putting.<BR>

<B>THE GAME OF THE CLANS II</B> <I>(Wayne Hoheisel and Stephen Agar) pe10/09<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) GORDON McDONALD in <I>AC-MONG</I> 39 (June 1991)<BR>

<P>
There is some confusion as to how many versions of the game there
are. This variant uses a map of Scotland and northern England
with eight powers: England, Campbell, Frazer, Gordon, Graham,
Keith, McDonald? (rather than MacDonald) and McLeod? (rather than
MacLeod).<BR>

<P>
In the first version England was too strong, however apparently
there was a nine-player version which contained the addition of
clan Stewart but it isn't clear as to whether this was a playtest.
I've set up the game and I get the impression that Game of the
Clans II is indeed the 9-player version but somehow clan Stewart
was left off the rules. On the map home supply centres are marked
with an asterisk whilst neutral centres are denoted by a small
circle. The areas of Blair, Buchanan, Morton, Crookstron, Stirling
and Blanerne have all got an asterisk, yet aren't listed against
any of the clans. So whereas all the other clans have 5 home centres
there must be a Stewart clan with 6 home centres.<BR>

<P>
Anyway, in the game the clan territory is fairly intermixed and
it seems that clans having their centres closer together have
a slight advantage over the others.<BR>

<P>
Other factors include the army/fleet rule for England with the
Clans making do with `boat-bunches'. This interesting variant
starts in Spring 1491, before Flodden and when Scotland was still
a power, perhaps explaining why the Royal House of Stewart has
six centres? 69 centres on the map with a win achieved by having
36 or 35 units on the board after a winner season, making it look
like a long game. England is eliminated once it loses all its
original home centres. As to historical accuracy I'm not sure,
I wouldn't have thought that the clans Frazer, Keith and MacLeod
would have compared with the others in strength and power. Maybe
I'm wrong!<BR>

<P>
(1) MARK NELSON (6-6-92)<BR>

<P>
A simple rule-change variant using the regular board. At the start
of the game each player is randomly allocated a power and starts
with $x cash where x is four if you have Russia and 3 for everyone
else. At the end of each year you gain $1 for each sc gained and
lose $1 for each sc lost. You are then allocated another power.
$18 to win the game and you are eliminated if your credit goes
down to zero.<BR>

<B>GEOPHYSICAL DIPLOMACY<BR>
</B>
<P>
(1) STEVE AGAR in <I>Spring Offensive</I> 8 (January 1993)<BR>

<P>
A slightly silly rule change variant by Jeremy Maiden and refined
by Keith Black, this variant allows players to alter the physical
characteristics of the regular board as the game progresses. Turn
Moscow into a huge lake, raise the English Channel above sea level
and invade England etc. etc.<BR>
<P>
<B>GESTA DANORUM I </B><I>(John Leeder)</i><BR>
<P>
Rules originally published in <I>Runestone</I> 72.<BR>

<P>
(1) REVIEW: Robert Sacks in <I>Lord of Hosts</I> 5, June 1975.
<BR>

<P>
A game for between four and eight players, vaguely reminiscent
of Excalibur. Two players, the Norse and the Danes, begin with
three off-board centers which disappear at the rate of one per
year and may build either off-board or in any on-board center
they own. Fleets may change to armies whenever they are in a coastal
province. The Temes (Thames) is navigable one province in, so
that there are two provinces which border by water but not by
land. In the four and five player versions, the Northern and Southern
Angles stand in CD, supporting each other. There is the Great
Army which wanders around the board randomly; it starts as a Triple
Army but loses one factor of strength every time it is dislodged,
spends a Winter in a non-center province or the same center as
the previous Winter; it only temporarily controls a center and
the previous owner of the center (to whom it reverts) may bribe
it to winter in some other player's center the following year
by foregoing an additional center. I heartily endorse someone
play(test)ing this game.<BR>

<P>
(2) STEVE AGAR in <I>V&amp;U</I> 4 (September 1980).<BR>

<P>
A historical variant set in England in 865AD, it has eight powers:
Norse, Danes, Picts, Northumbria, Mercia, East Anglia and Wessex.
As in Excalibur (qv), the Norse and Danes invade from the edge
of the map. An interesting idea is &quot;The Great Army&quot;,
this is a 3A which is not controlled by anyone; it moves around
England raising any supply centres that get in the way. 7, 6,
5, and 4 player versions are included in the rules.<BR>

<P>
<b>GESTA DANORUM II</b> <I>(unknown)<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) REVIEW: Iain Murray in <I>Ac Mong</I> 31, June 1990.<BR>

<P>
I believe that in this game the centre powers (Mercia and East
English) have no real chance and the same may prove to be true
of Northumbria. The Great Army only adds to this problem. Even
Wessex may go under if attacked by a Danish-Norse alliance; the
same could be true of the Picts, to a lesser extent. There also
appears to be too much of a bottleneck around Hadrian's Wall,
leading to problems for Pictish expansion. To give themselves
any chances the four English powers would have to sew up a very
tight alliance, dividing up the spare mainland supply centres,
and building fleets early on, so driving the Norse and Danes from
the sea, causing them to be `dissuaded', and then fight it out
amongst themselves and the Picts, who I think, would profit heavily
from the seas being free of Vikings. Even if this were to be done,
the Mercians and East English would find that opportunities for
expansion were far fewer for them than for the Northumbrians and
West Saxons. All in all, the map (especially the distribution
of supply centres) needs a serious re-think in the light of a
couple of playtest games.<BR>

<P>
(2) COMMENT: Gordon McDonald in <I>Ac Mong</I> 31, June 1990.
<BR>

<P>
The bottleneck problem with the area around Hadrian's Wall applied
to 1066 I and most likely to Excalibur as well. The problem is
the shape of the British Isles. However, direct passage across
places such as the Solway Firth and the Bristol Channel is something
that could be looked at in the future. After all this idea is
quite common in Diplomacy and Diplomacy variants, indeed Hadrian's
Wall didn't end at the edge of the Solway Firth, but continued
to on to Bowness, some way along it with a number of towers along
the Cumberland coast which suggests passage across the Firth was
quite common. Although there is probable a need for more provinces
in this area as well. As regards Mercia; an extra unit like Russia
has in regular Dip? Indeed, there are many options.<BR>

<B>GIGATON BOMB</B> <I>(Leonard Miyata)<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) Robert Sacks in <I>Lord of Hosts</I> 1, November 1974.<BR>

<P>
Each power starts with as many bombs as home supply centers, and
each bomb may be used to destroy units, centers and provinces
and disrupt bodies of water. There is little sense in a game where
you can erect impassable dead-zones across the board or set fire
to the map-board or your opponents (perhaps it was designed as
a social comment?).<BR>

<P>
<B>THE GREAT YEARS</B> <I>(Kedge Neuman)</I> ??/06 <BR>

<P>
<I>Chimaera </I>??? (1976)<BR>

<P>
(1) STEVE AGAR in ??? circa September 1990<BR>

<P>
A Lord of The Rings variant for six players (Mordor, Gondor, Rohan,
Elves, Dwarves and Men &amp; Hobbits). There are also personalities
which can inspire their units to greater things -- while Aragorn
and Gandalf move by player vote and can inspire anyone. Unlike
other LoTR variants which have a hidden ring piece all players
know the location of the ring -- in the Shire. The fleet problem
that dogs the essentially land-locked map of Middle Earth is overcome
in this variant by the use of boat-bunches (as in Game of the
Clans). A postal game was run in Richard Bartle's SAUCE of the
NILE.<BR>

<P>
<B>GUNBOAT<BR>
</B>
<P>
(1) BOB OLSEN in <I>MOD<BR>
</I>
<P>
This is exactly like regular Diplomacy, except that the identity
of the players is known only to the GM. Thus there is no negotiation.
For this reason, a Gunboat game can offer a break from the letter-in-letter-out
grind of correspondence and can also give a chance to sharpen
your tactical ability without confusing you with a lot of lies
from the other players. Generally, Gunboat games still carry press
so it is often possible to figure out who's in the game if you're
familiar with the press-styles of various people. But if you keep
your mouth shut, who's to know? This is probably the most common
type of variant offered.<BR>

<P>
(2) JAMES NELSON in <I>SPRINGY</I> 45 (February 1991)<BR>

<P>
This has several different versions, but in all versions the players
are anonymous. Some versions allow diplomacy via the press, but
even then there can be differences! For example, in one versions
there is `black press', where anyone can write press for any country!
Try working out who is saying what in that version!! This variant
has been very popular in recent years because the players have
to do no work except mailing orders to the GM.<BR>

<P>
<B>GUSHER DIPLOMACY</B> <I>(Fred C. Davis Jnr)<BR>
</I>
<P>
(1) Fred C. Davis Jnr in <I>DIPLOMACY WORLD</I> 66 (Spring 1992)
<BR>

<P>
This variant is based on a characteristic of an old board game
called &quot;Gusher&quot;, in which players bid for the right
to drill for oil on certain properties. Highest bidder got to
buy the property. He would then set up a device called a &quot;drill&quot;
on a hole on the property (the hole was already on the board,
of course), and plunge a built-in plunger down. There were jigsaw-type
pieces of wood inside the gameboard, which were scattered about
by shaking the board before the game began. If the plunger hit
one of these pieces, he had a dry hole. If the plunger went all
the way to the bottom, he had a gusher. Each producing well paid,
I think, $50,000 each turn. The more producing wells you had,
the more money you could afford to pay for future pieces of property.
Eventually, the big guys drove the little guys into bankruptcy.
<BR>

<P>
Instead of a drill, Gusher Diplomacy uses either a deck of cards
or a special number system to determine the value of each supply
center. Instead of an &quot;all or nothing&quot; system, I've
devised a way of allowing a center to be worth from 0 to 3 supply
sources. These have names from Zero Centers (Z) to Triple Centers
(T). Whenever a player occupies any supply center other than a
Great Power capital, he will never know how much it is going to
be worth until the GM performs certain card draws or calculations.
This will add an element of chance to a Diplomacy game which,
if nothing else, ought to make things quite interesting. No two
games will be the game.<BR>
