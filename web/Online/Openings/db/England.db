comment|--ABOUT THE ENGLISH OPENINGS--
English openings are categorized by the orders given to the two fleets,
as follows:
<ul>
<li>Northern Openings   (F Edi-NWG, F Lon-NTH)
<li>Southern Openings   (F Edi-NTH, F Lon-ENG)
<li>Western Opening     (F Edi-Cly, F Lon-ENG)
<li>The Splits Openings (F Edi-NWG, F Lon-ENG)
</ul>
<P>
A few other Spring 1901 order sets are named, but these others are usually
categorized as "silly" (such as the famous "Yorkshire Pudding" opening).
<P>
Two variants of the Northern Opening, the Yorkshire and the Churchill,
are far and away the most common of the English openings.
END

eng-church|NORTHERN OPENING, CHURCHILL VARIANT
In this Northern Opening variant, known simply as the Churchill Opening, and
named after after Sir Winston's plan to invade Norway in World War II, the
English army is sent to Edinburgh.  This
is a little more risky than the pure Northern Opening, as England cannot
guarantee securing a build in 1901, but it offers more flexibility, since
England can follow with a Bohas in the Fall, if desired, to exert pressure on
Sweden in Spring of 1902. The Churchill is usually seen a sign that England is
more interested in securing a presence in Scandinavia than in worrying about
the Franco-German relationship, and hence provides an early hint of a triple
alliance.  Because of this, the Fall destination of the English army is equally
likely to be Belgium as Norway.
<P>
The <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> calls this "England's best opening,"
From Edinburgh rather than Yorkshire, the army can be convoyed by either
fleet. It thus has the choice of going to Norway or to the Continent. It can
also be convoyed to Norway by one fleet with support from the other.
This opening is viewed as primarily anti-Russian. It can also
be anti-German. One powerful Fall move is A Edi-Nor, F NTH C
F Edi-Nor, F NWG-BAR, threatening Russia even more directly.
END

eng-bohas|[BOHAS]
This Fall continuation of the Churchill Opening has the English army
convoying to Norway while the North Sea fleet is sent to Skagerrak.
At the risk of leaving the North Sea open, England gains the ability to
start quickly on Russia's Scandinavian holdings, beginning in the south, or
to conduct a surprise attack on a German Denmark.
END

eng-north|NORTHERN OPENING (THE YORKSHIRE OPENING)
Richard Sharp's name for the opening F Lon-NTH and F Edi-NWG.
There are four named variations:
<ul>
<li>the Yorkshire Opening (the pure Northern Opening),
<li>the Churchill Opening,
<li>the Wales variant, and
<li>the Clyde variant,
</ul>
In his book, "The Game of Diplomacy," Richard Sharp applied the
term "Yorkshire Opening" to the pure Northern Opening (A Lvp-Yor).
Although the offensive role of the English army is limited, this
opening is the only move to guarantee England a build in 1901, since Yorkshire
can guard London against a sneaky French assault through the Channel, and one
fleet can support the other into Norway if Russia opens with A Mos-StP. The
opening vies in popularity with the "Churchill Opening." Note that it <i>may</i>
be important which England supports himself into Norway. If Russia orders
A Mos-StP in Spring of 1901 and A StP-Nor in Fall of 1901 then to achieve
Norway, the English will need to support a move by the fleet in the North
Sea, in case Germany orders an attack on the North Sea to cut support.
END

eng-northsea|NORTH SEA OPENING
Richard Sharp's name for the opening in which England orders A Lvp-Yor,
sends one fleet to the North Sea and does something &quot;silly&quot; with
the other fleet (usually F Lon H, which provides the opportunity for a
supported attack on the English Channel, at the cost of England's 1901 build).
There are two variations: the Clyde (involving Edi-Cly) and the Thames
(Lon-Wal).
END

eng-south|SOUTHERN OPENING
Richard Sharp's name for the opening F Lon-ENG, F Edi-NTH. There
are three named variations:
<ul>
<li>the Edinburgh variation,
<li>the Welsh Opening, and
<li>the Yorkshire Opening.
</ul>
END

eng-atlbind|[ATLANTIC BIND]
In this Fall 1901 continuation of a Southern opening, England sends
the Channel fleet into the Mid-Atlantic Ocean while convoying to Norway.
England passes up the slim chance of Brest in exchange for the forward
position. (The MAO is much harder for England to take once France builds
a second fleet.) If expelled from MAO, the English fleet can move to the
Western Mediterranean, threatening Spain, Tunis, and the Gulf of Lyon.
END

eng-splits|THE SPLITS
Richard Sharp's name for the opening F Lon-ENG and F Edi-NWG.
There are three named variations: the Edinburgh, the Wales and
the Yorkshire, each named after the army destination.
END

eng-wales|SOUTHERN OPENING, WELSH VARIANT
Known as the Welsh Opening, this opening is normally attempted when England
is quite sure of
taking the Channel, a fact seen by its high success rate compared with other
Southern openings. Because England only commits to Wales with the surety of
a Channel entry, French cooperation is often assumed by the board, and the
most common target for the English army is Belgium. As a result, however, the
success rate for taking Brest with this opening is extraordinarily high,
and any French trust in the English will be tested.
<P>
The <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> calls this opening "blatantly
anti-French." If France opened to the Mid-Atlantic, she is probably faced
with the choice of giving up either Spain or Portugal in order to protect
Brest. England may also allow her to slip back in the home center while
convoying the army to Belgium instead.  Meanwhile, the North Sea fleet can
either support the army into Belgium or take Norway.
END

eng-yorkpud|YORKSHIRE PUDDING
A joke opening where all the English units are ordered to Yorkshire
in Spring 1901. Devised by Denis Jones and used by him in a postal
game. Strange character, Denis Jones. Needless to say, he didn't
do too well in that game.
END

eng-west|WESTERN OPENING
In this opening, England leaves Scandinavia for Russia and Germany to divide,
and commits all forces to an advance into the Atlantic.  Followed in Fall by
Cly-NAO and a convoy to Belgium with German support, the Englishman builds a
fleet in Liverpool and overwhelms France with seapower.  The Western opening
is extremely risky, and only undertaken with complete trust in the German,
both for his support into Belgium and his restraint in taking the North Sea.
If Russia is warned off Norway and commits three units to the south, the German
can usually conquer all of Scandinavia, his reward for assisting the English.
By the time Germany consolidates Scandinavia, England's defenses against any
temptation the German may be feeling should be firmed up.
END

eng-push|[EASTERN PUSH]
Manus Hand's name for the anti-Russian continuation of the Northern opening.
In Fall of 1901, the Norwegian sea fleet is sent to the Barents Sea while
England's other two units take Norway.  Especially if Russia has opened to the
south, this opening puts heavy pressure on St. Petersburg, and can thus be
used to relieve England's fellow "witch," the Turk, from Russian aggression. 
If Germany prevents Russia from gaining Sweden, the attack on Russia's north
can be swift and final, often ending with Russia conceding St. Petersburg to
the English in return for a promise that only fleets will occupy it.  If
Russia opens Mos-StP, England's better choice is a supported attack on
Norway, but the threat of a Barents invasion in 1902 (with an occupied
Norway) remains a strong argument for a Northern Opening.
END

eng-magde|[MAGDEBURG]
Named after the German ship wrecked during WWI in the Baltic, which gave Great
Britain and Russia access to German naval codes for the remainder of the war,
this is Manus Hand's Anglo-Russian Northern Opening continuation.  England's
task is to convince Germany to open to Denmark and then move to stand Russia
out of Sweden.  Russia opens to the Gulf of Bothnia, and, in cahoots with
his English ally, assists
in isolating the German for a strong 1902 attack.  Russia avoids Sweden in Fall
of 1901 and instead sails to the Baltic.  Simultaneously, England takes the
vacated Denmark.  Norway can go to either England (the "Prince Louis
Madgeburg") or Russia (if Russia opens with a Northern System; this is the
"Benckendorff Magdeburg").  The Prince Louis (F NWG-Nor in Fall 1901) has
the diplomatic advantage of allowing England to claim shock and continued
friendship with Germany, but the Benckendorff can be used to force a Spring
disband of the German fleet (NWG HOLD in Fall 1901, then NWG-Nor and NTH-SKA
in Spring 1902 while Russia moves her Norway army to Finland and send a newly
built fleet into the Gulf of Bothnia), forcing the German to play a unit
short in Fall of 1902.

# Kayla says you should do this opening in case people need to find clues in
# there and there are much  things you could do like there might be games
# to have.  Maybe it can give you stuff that you can take home.  And that
# you might see animal games and you could find clues in it.
