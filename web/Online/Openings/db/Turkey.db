comment|--ABOUT THE TURKISH OPENINGS--
In general, there is no substitute for A Con-Bul. The orders for the other
two units may vary, but Con-Bul is nearly a given.  Because of this, and
the fact that F Ank-BLA
is so often equivalent to F Ank H, Turkey has the fewest named openings,
and consequently no need for a formal system of categorization has arisen.
As a result, the few openings for Turkey are individually (and often
colorfully) named.
END

tur-aaaa|ASTONISHINGLY ARROGANT ANKARAN ASSAULT
Bruce Linsey's name for the fully commital opening sending all the Turkish
units against Russia.
END

tur-bosph|BOSPHORUS OPENING
Richard Sharp's name for the opening A Con-Bul and F Ank-Con.
There are two named variations: A Smy-Arm
(the Armenia Variation, better known as
<a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/turkhog.htm>The Turkish
Hedgehog</a>, and also
called Sharp's Opening and Soak's Bane) and A Smy H
(the Smyrna Variation).
<P>
The intent here is, in the Fall, F Con-AEG, A Smy-Con (or HOLD)
for a western push. If Russia treacherously ordered F Sev-BLA,
Turkey can still defend. F Con-Ank, A Smy-Ank will hold all her
home supply centers and leave Ankara open for the build of a
fleet.
END

tur-boston|BOSTON STRANGLER
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: A Con-Bul, A Smy-Con, F
Ank H (or misordered).  This deliberately allows Russian access
to the Black Sea, yet provides Turkey with a measure of defense
along his north coast.  The idea is to use the Russian fleet to
support Balkan actions, fake an unsuccessful Turkish war, and
eventually make its way to the Mediterranean using an arranged
(often Springtime) passage through Constantinople.
END

tur-crimean|CRIMEAN CRUSHER 
Turkey opening to Bul, BLA, and Arm is an aggressive opening
that allows all three pieces to be used against Russia in the
fall. Even if the fleet move succeeds, though, if Russia is in
Rum, Ukr and Sev, Turkey must still second guess Russia for a
second center if Austrian help is unavailable, and may lose BLA
in the process.
<P>
This opening poses all sorts of problems for Russia. If she has
trustingly ordered F Sev-Rum she is in real trouble. Even if
she ordered, F Sev-BLA, she is going to have difficulty maintaining
her position.
END

tur-rat|DESERT RAT OPENING
Richard Sharp's name for any opening using A Smy-Syr.
END

tur-pastiche|PASTICHE OPENING
This gives Turkey more flexibility
than most openings, as he can claim that A Smy H means that he
is neither anti-Russian nor anti-Austrian. However, if he succeeds in
getting into the Black Sea, the Turk still has significant options against
either country
in Fall. If a standoff occurs in the Black Sea, telling Russia that 
Bul-Rum is coming may cause him to commit his Sevastopol fleet to Rumania,
permitting
Turkey to enter the Black Sea. Even if this fails, Constantinople will be
open for a build in Winter, giving the Turk two fleets on his north coast.
END

tur-shipodes|SHIP OF THE DESERT
Richard Sharp's name for the opening that
allows Russia into the Black Sea, but provides an effective Fall
defense against the Russian fleet (through use of a self-standoff in
Ankara).  The advantage is that the fleet adjacent to Sevastopol causes
fits for the Russian and pins at least one unit down while Austria or
other powers begin an attack on Russia.  More importantly, with the build
gained from Bulgaria, Turkey is usually able to put two fleets against the
Black Sea, and can usually force Russia's departure in 1902.
END

tur-syria|[SYRIAN OPENING]
This extremely rare Fall 1901 continuation of a Pastiche Opening has Turkey's
fleet (typically
stood off from the Black Sea in Spring) move to Constantinople, and the Smyrna
army moves to Syria. This permits Turkey to build on either coast,
support himself either to AEG or BLA, send fleets to both
AEG and EAS, or go in both directions. Notice how if Turkey does
not choose a victim in 1901, his second army actually gets in
the way, and must be ditched for full Winter 1901 freedom.
END

tur-balkan|BALKAN CONCENTRATION
Named by Manus Hand, this opening sends all the Turkish units
toward the center-rich Balkans.  Especially if the fleet move
succeeds, Turkey has a nice position for fall, able to exert pressure
on Serbia, Greece, and Rumania while defending his Bulgaria acquisition.
<P>
Turkey can employ this opening when she is unsure of Russia but
does not want to move to Armenia. It may be that she has at least
a neutrality pact with Russia which includes a pre-arranged stand-off
in the Black Sea. Among other things, this can be used to deceive
players in believing Russia and Turkey are at war, even though
they are allied.
END

tur-rusfrol|[RUSSIAN FROLIC]
Allen Wells' name for the Austro-Turkish opening based on A Vie-Gal, A Bud-Rum,
A Con H, A Smy-Arm, F Ank-Bla. The key here is A Con H which,
by eliminating Turkey's 1901 risk to Serbia, permits Austria
to move safely to Rumania. Discussed in issue 29 of <i>Diplomacy World</i>.
END

tur-slingshot|[SLINGSHOT JUGGERNAUT]
Manus Hand's Russo-Turkish opening, sending the Turkish fleet to the Black
Sea while Russia's fleet enters Armenia, with each power telling Austria the
intent is to attack the other, and with both lobbying hard for Austrian
support.  As the opening charade unfolds, the Turkish Black Sea fleet and
Ankara army dislodge Russia's fleet from Armenia, and with Sevastopol
unavailable for a retreat, the fleet is forced to disband.
Austria cannot blame Russia for trying the promised Turkish attack and
being unable to retreat his fleet, and Russia commiserates with the "at
least I have tied up all his units in the east" line, while both Russia
and Turkey continue to plead for Austrian assistance in the coming
conflict.  In 1902, however, the Turk convoys from Armenia through the
Black Sea to Bulgaria while Russia's now land-based forces hit the Austrian
by surprise, typically supporting a Turkish attack on Serbia.
END

tur-hedgehog|TURKISH HEDGEHOG
Also called Sharp's Opening or Soak's Bane, the Turkish Hedgehog is Nicholas
Whyte's name for the Bosphorous opening with Smyrna opening to Armenia
instead of to Ankara.  His thoughts on the opening are contained in
<a target=_parent href=http://www.diplomacy-archive.com/resources/strategy/articles/turkish_hedghog.htm>his article
on the subject</a>.  Charles Steinhardt describes a Russian Attack continuation in <a target=_parent href=http://devel.diplom.org/Zine/S2000M/Steinhardt/Hedgehog.html>his article.
END

tur-exch|[BLACK SEA EXCHANGE]
Aron Ambrosiani's name for the Falltime continuation of the Turkish Hedgehog
which allows an R/T alliance to get both fleets into the Mediterarnean.
<P>
In Spring 1901, Russia opens F Sev-Bla, while
Turkey opens the hedgehog. In fall 1901, Bla moves to Con, Arm to Sev
and Con to Aegean Sea, and the Turkish A Bul can help a Russian
army into Rumania.
<P>
The really hard thing with this variant is to the amount of trust it requires.
The Fall
moves are vital, since both countries move unsupported into each other's
centers.
