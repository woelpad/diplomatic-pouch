itl-alpine|ALPINE CHICKEN
This is a somewhat temporizing opening, generally
seen as pro-Turkey and anti-France. Both east and west options are preserved.
Often followed in Fall by a Koniggratz Freakout.   Stephen Agar describes
this opening more completely in his article,
<a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/alpine.htm><i>Is The Alpine
Chicken A Tasty Bird?</i></a>
END

itl-antihedlep|LEPANTO, ANTI-HEDGEHOG VARIATION
Named by Richard Sharp, the Anti-Hedgeog Lepanto was devised to combat the
popularity of the Austrian Hedgehog openings, which send Trieste into Venice.
END

itl-bwl|[BLUE WATER LEPANTO]
Manus Hand's Fall 1901 continuation of the traditional Lepanto has the
Italian covering a threatened Venice and feeling forced to take Tunis
with the Ionian fleet.  The Austrian (who opened to the Adriatic) sails
to the vacated Ionian to be dislodged by F Nap and F Tun, retreating
eastward to form part of the convoy chain that carries the Italian army
to Anatolia.  Described in <a target=_parent href=/Zine/W1999A/Hand/bwl.html>an article
in The Pouch Zine</a> by Manus Hand and in
<a target=_parent href=/Zine/F2000M/Pillie/bluewater.html>a follow-up article</a> by
Derek Pillie.
END

itl-ill|[ILLYRIAN OPENING]
A Spring 1902 continuation of the Lepanto that sends F ION-ADR, F Nap-ION,
and A Ven-Tri. Even
if A Ven-Tri fails, Fall 1902 provides the choice of either F ADR S Ven-Tri
with F ION C Tun-Alb, the less aggressive A Ven S Tun-ION-ADR-Tri,
or the primarily positional F ADR S F ION C Tun-Alb (if Tri looks too secure).
The point here is that a Lepanto start in 1901 does not preclude an attack on
Austria as early as Spring of 1902.
END

itl-shuffle|[ITALIAN SHUFFLE]
A fall continuation of the Alpine Chicken opening.  With Pie-Tyr and Ven-Tri,
the point is to confuse or delay France, while delaying the attack on
Austria for a season, allowing Italy the chance to see if the diplomatic
and tactical position is right, and to persuade Austria that he is friendly.
The risks are that the failure to attack Austria right off may antagonize
Russia or Turkey, and that by violating Piedmont without disabling France
Italy may have stirred the hornet's nest without setting it afire.
END

itl-koniggratz|[KONIGGRATZ FREAKOUT]
Edi Birsan's offbeat German-Italian continuation to the Alpine Chicken,
A Ven S Pie-Tyr, dislodging
the German army in Tyrolia, allowing it to retreat to whichever of Vienna
or Trieste Austria leaves open. Piedmont provides some assurance to
Germany that the French army in Burgundy will not be tempted to go for Munich,
especially if Germany announces that he will open A Mun-Tyr.
END

itl-lepanto|LEPANTO
Lepanto openings in general feature
the Spring 1901 moves F Nap-ION and A Rom-Nap, followed by F
ION C Nap-Tun in autumn, to secure a build of F Nap). The full
Lepanto would then be pursued with the moves F Nap-ION, F ION-EAS
and then F EAS C Tun-Syr (or Smy), thus embodying a four season
strategy directed against Turkey (Italy's traditional rival for
naval supremacy in the Mediterranean). Indeed, the Lepanto takes
its name from the Sixteenth Century Battle of Lepanto in which
an Austro-Italian fleet defeated the Turks. In practice, however,
the Lepanto is rarely pursued beyond Autumn 1901, after which
Italian players usually prefer to develop a more flexible strategy.
As an answer to the Juggernaut, the Lepanto may be the best Italian
opening, assuming as it does no grave threat from Austria.
<P>
Alliance with Austria is essential, with a standoff
in the Black Sea in Spring 1901 very desirable. Devised and
popularized by Edi Birsan
<a target=_parent href=/DipPouch/Zine/S1998M/Birsan/Lepanto.html>read
the original article on the subject</a>),
it is probably the best-known named opening.  The Lepanto
can be turned from anti-Turk to anti-Austrian in 1902 using the
Illyrian Opening. 
<P>
The Lepanto is designed to carry Italian power into the east rapidly.
This was the first opening ever to be discussed in depth in an
article. Edi Birsan's work on the subject is still considered
a model effort.
<p>This attack on Turkey
in alliance with Austria, is often enormously effective. Turkey
can block it by building F Smy and ordering F Smy-EAS. However,
Italy can order F ION-AEG instead, threatening a convoy into
Bul, Con, or Smy.
<P>
There are a number of variants to the Lepanto Opening:
<ul>
<li>Classical Lepanto (A Ven H)
<li>Tyrolian Lepanto (A Ven-Tyr)
<li>Key Lepanto (A Ven-Tri)
<li>Swiss Lepanto (A Ven-Tyr)
<li>Neopolitan Lepanto (A Rom-Nap)
<li>Anti-Hedgehog Lepanto (A Ven-Apu, A Rom-Ven)
</ul>
<P>
The Classical Lepanto is often considered too passive, indicative of a distrust
of Austria; it does, however, have the advantage that A Ven H,
A Apu S A Ven, F ION-Tun in Fall 1901 saves Venice and still allows Italy
to build if Austria puts two units against Venice.
END

itl-tyrlep|LEPANTO, TYROLIAN VARIATION
The order A Ven-Tyr is favored in many quarters, as it is 
is positive and powerful. It allows
A Tyr-Mun if there is an Anglo-German alliance threatening France.
This will bolster the French defense and help keep the West stalemated.
A Ven-Tyr may also stand off a German sneak attack from Munich.
It also gives the possibility of A Tyr-Boh (and thence to Gal),
adding to Austria's defensive line if this is necessary. 
<P>
Common wisdom is that on no account should Italy stab Austria. The
short-term gains may be all right, but the long-term price is not
something Italy would wish to pay. On the other hand, Leif Bergman
advocates just that, stabbing Austria, in his Diplomatic Pouch article
"<A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/F1997M/Bergman/Italy.html
TARGET=_top>Go Fasta Go Fasta</A>."
END

itl-swilep|LEPANTO, SWISS VARIATION
The Swiss Lepanto, named by Manus Hand, often unnnecessarily antagonizes
France. It can be used,
however, if there is an Anglo-French alliance for sure and Italy wants to
help Germany.
END

itl-keylep|LEPANTO, KEY VARIATION
A Key Opening without the camoflauge (and risk to Austria)
of Rom-Ven.
Named by Jeff Key, the inventor, the Key Lepanto is an Italian-Austrian opening
with A Ven-Tri-Ser (usually with Austrian support to foil A Bul-Ser),
A Bud-Ser-Gre (latter with support from F Alb). Since Italy gets
his build in Serbia, he can send his fleet forward to AEG or EAS in Fall
of 1901. This opening is particularly
valuable if Turkey opens F Ank-Con, since the traditional Lepanto
is almost certain to be foiled. If A Bul-Gre is believed unlikely,
Austria can step up the naval pressure on Turkey with F Alb-ION.
Italy can readily stab Austria with A Tri-Vie, A Ven-Tri, or
by gaining Turkish support for A Apu/F ION-Gre, plus A Tri-Alb
to cut support.
<P>
The Lepanto is followed in the south as before. But in the
north by A Tri-Ser or A Tri-Alb. The purpose here is to get another
army into the Balkans against Turkey. If Italy holds Serbia at
the end of 1901, the purpose is to allow her to build two fleets.
The second fleet is used to help France against England/Germany
or to challenge England/France. Austria has got to have enormous
trust in Italy to allow this movement, but that's Diplomacy.
<P>
As with the non-Lepanto Key Opening, the temptation to stay in Trieste
is often too great for an Italian to resist. Consequently, despite the
overwhelming popularity of the Lepanto as an opening, the Key Lepanto itself
is rarely seen.
END

itl-key|[KEY OPENING]
Jeff Key's Fall continuation to the Austrian Attack which sends the Italian
army in Trieste to Serbia, revealing a strong Italy/Austria alliance, and
putting an extra army into the fight against Turkey in the Balkans.
Austria agrees to give A Ven passage
through Trieste to attack Serbia (or Greece, through Albania).
Unfortunately for agreeable Austrian players, most Italians allowed
into Trieste refuse to move out in Autumn, with horrific consequences
for beleaguered Austria.
<P>
Tony Swinnerton's Diplomatic Pouch article, "<A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/W1997A/Swinnerton/Key.html
TARGET=_top>Playing the Key</A>," has a more encouraging view.
END

itl-mcgivern|OBRIANI OPENING, McGIVERN'S VARIATION
Also known as McGivern's Opening, this is Richard Sharp's name for the
less frequently used Obriani opening that does not put Italian pressure
on Greece in 1901.
END

itl-naplep|LEPANTO, NEOPOLITAN VARIATION
The Lepanto opening with the Roman army moving to Naples rather than the
standard Apulia. There is basically no difference between the two destinations
for the army, but Apulia is generally regarded as standard Lepanto, with
Naples being the variant. 
END

itl-stablep|AUSTRIAN ATTACK (a.k.a. STAB LEPANTO)
This opening puts maximum pressure on Austria (assuming Ven-Tri succeeds).
Since it is rarely tried unless success is known beforehand, this opening is
usually preceded by negotiation for a Lepanto, and thus the name "Stab
Lepanto."
END

itl-3fleets|[THREE FLEETS OPENING]
Edi Birsan's Fall continuation in which Italy allows his Trieste
army to to be annihilated in Fall of 1901, and then builds two fleets. This
avoids the superfluous army that occurs when Italy selects France
and Turkey as his first two victims.
END

itl-tyrolia|OBRIANI OPENING (a.k.a. TYROLIA ATTACK)
This opening is the single most popular
Italian Opening.  It gives the player the option of attacking Vie, supporting
into Tri or going for Munich, in addition to helping Russia take Vienna.
<P>
A classic Italian opening, one of the most enduring and popular combination of
moves for Italy in Spring 1901, it is traditionally regarded
as an attack on Austria, although it can also be turned against
Germany if (perhaps with French support or encouragement) A Tyr
attacks Munich in the Autumn. Indeed, this is very often an option,
since most Austrian players have better things to do with A Vienna
than order to Tyrolia and A Mun-Tyr is hardly a common opening
for Germany. But if the A Ven move can usually be expected to
work, the popularity of F Tri-Ven with Austria has risen so dramatically
with the Hedgehog Opening that A Rom will usually be stood off
in the Tyrolia Attack. No matter: it protects Venice, and if
by chance the move succeeds, Trieste or Vienna could be there
for the taking. Providing as it does an option on up to three
centres, this opening is clearly Italy's best chance of securing
five centres in the first year.
<P>
The <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> calls this "best anti-Austrian
opening.  It concentrates two armies
on Trieste and creates a guessing game around Vienna. The fleet
can pick up Tunis or even move to Greece or the Adriatic. Getting
Tunis is better; Italy needs a build."
<P>
The opening can also be developed into a surprise attack on the French
using the Italian Oktoberfest continuation.
END

itl-westlep|WESTERN LEPANTO
The very anti-French opening of A Rom H/-Tus, then to Tunis via
F TYS, with A Ven-Pie-Mar/S French A Spa-Mar. In Spring of 1902, F TYS can
move to WES to convoy to Spain, or is in a position to directly
block F Mar-LYO. If there are no eastern commitments, this will
be a rare circumstance when building F Rom is superior to F Nap,
as F Rom-Tus permits the piece to be used directly in F02.
<P>
This opening keeps powerful forces poised against Spain. France
must also play a guessing game. If she moves A Mar-Spa but not
A Par-Bur, she must now decide whether to order A Spa-Mar. If
Italy then orders A Pie-Mar, the center is saved; if not, Spain
is lost, and a fleet can't be built in Marseilles.
END

itl-panther|[PANTHER]
This Fall Austro-Italo-German continuation of the Swiss Lepanto
Opening was named by Dan Abbott after Kaiser Wilhelm II's sending the German
gunboat <i>Panther</i> to Africa in 1911.  The opening presents a combined
front by the Central Powers (A/G/I) in an attempt to guarantee control of
Africa and the Gibraltar block by controlling the Mediterranean.  To do this,
the rival Mediterranean powers (France and Turkey) must be taught a lesson.
<P>
In Spring, Austria opens to pressure the Ionian, while 
Germany opens to Burgundy and Holland.  The pure Panther sees
occupation of Serbia and Kiel in Spring 1901, but other variations are
possible, which also put pressure on Russia.
<P>
In Fall, the Italian army in Apulia is convoyed to Albania by the Austrian
fleet, while Italy takes Tunis, and both Germany and Italy continue to
harass France in Marseilles, Burgundy, and Belgium.  While France is
occupied by pressure on his entire eastern border, Turkey sees two hostile
fleets coming at him.  The remaining two powers, England and Russia, should
be pleased by the opening. Russia is able to not only get in on the
Turkish party but also appeased by Germany's lack of Scandinavian force.
England is also satisfied with the Scandinavian lines and can help out with
France.
END

itl-okt|[ITALIAN OKTOBERFEST]
Jim Burgess's name for the German-Italian continuation of the Obriani
in which Italy's opening to Tyrolia is followed by  a
Fall 1901 advance into Munich, at which time the army in Venice
proceeds to Piedmont, and Tunis is taken.  After building a fleet in Naples
and an army in Venice or Rome, Italy's Spring 1902 moves are Tun-ION, Pie-Mar,
Mun-Bur, Nap-TYS, and the new army holds or moves to Tuscany.  This opening is
discussed in <a target=new href=/Zine/S2003M/Burgess/Rome.html>an article in the Pouch
Zine</a>.
END

itl-boh|[BOHEMIAN CRUSHER]
Aron Ambrosiani's name for the Obriani opening follow-up which sees
Tyrolia move to Bohemia, while Venice is sent to Tyrolia.  A third
army is added in Rome (for Tunis) at the end of the year.
<P>
This opening banks on the probability that the Austrian army in
Vienna or Trieste will cover supply centers and not guard against
the surrounding action.  If Russia moves into Gal and/or Rum at the
same time, Austria is doomed.
<P>
The problem with this opening is, of course, the lack of fleets. It
can't be carried through if Turkey moves straight west. However,
combined with a Turkish attack on Russia, Italy should be the leader
entering the mid-game.
<p>
The opening was
<a target=_top href=/Zine/F2008M/Hunt/crusher.htm>discussed and advocated by
David Hunt</a> in The Pouch Zine's fiftieth issue.
