comment|--ABOUT THE GERMAN OPENINGS--
The German openings are categorized as follows:  if the Berlin army is sent to
Kiel, then if Munich opens to Ruhr, the opening is a Blitzkrieg opening, and
if Munich does <i>not</i> open to Ruhr, 
the opening is named according to the order of the Kiel fleet.
Otherwise (if Berlin does <i>not</i> open to Kiel) the opening is categorized
based on the order given to the Berlin army.
<ul>
<li>Blitzkrieg Openings  (A Ber-Kie, A Mun-Ruh)
<li>Anschluss Openings   (A Ber-Kie, F Kie-Den)
<li>Dutch Openings       (A Ber-Kie, F Kie-Hol)
<li>Dutch Boy Openings   (A Ber-Kie, F Kie-HEL)
<li>Western Barbarossa   (A Ber-Kie, F Kie-BAL)
<li>Gambit Openings      (A Ber-Mun, F Kie-Hol)
<li>Rhineland Openings   (A Ber-Mun, F Kie-Den)
<li>Prussian Openings    (A Ber-Pru)
<li>Silesian Openings    (A Ber-Sil)
<li>Berlin Defense       (A Ber H)
</ul>
END

ger-berlin|BERLIN DEFENSE
Any German opening in which Berlin is ordered to HOLD.  These openings
guard against a Russian entry into the east without committing the German
to an attack.
END

ger-dike|DUTCH BOY OPENING
Named by Manus Hand, Dutch Boy openings involve F Kie-HEL
and A Ber-Kie.  This move applies pressure to the North
Sea (in combination with a French fleet in the Channel) but is a rather
poor substitute for F Kie-Den.  The advantage is that if France is to make
the attack on the North Sea, Germany may occupy Denmark with an army rather
than a fleet, giving him immediate convoy possibilities.  The Dutch Boy is
also useful in combination with a Russian Northern System opening.  With
a Russian army in St. Petersburg after Spring of 1901, and with pressure
on England's North Sea fleet, the only sure English build in Norway must
be taken by vacating the North Sea, and Germany can take advantage of this
by HEL-NTH, while still covering Holland and Denmark with armies.
END

ger-centrifuge|CENTRIFUGE
Clinton Wolf's name for the Prussian opening that includes F Kie-BAL and
A Mun-Kie.  Followed by a convoy to Denmark,
and then by the addition of another fleet in Winter, which
is used to completely plug the waters from Kiel to St. Petersburg,
the Centrifuge is described in full in
<a target=_top href=/DipPouch/Zine/S1999R/Wolf/centrifuge.html>a Diplomatic
Pouch Zine article on the opening</a>.
END

ger-wesbarb|WESTERN BARBAROSSA
Any opening sending F Kie-Bal with A Ber-Kie.  This opening allows for the
taking of Denmark (or Holland) with an army and Germany threatens a fleet
move to the Gulf of Bothnia.  In combination with Mun-Sil, Russia can see
two of his units with early worries.
END

ger-anschluss|ANSCHLUSS OPENING
Richard Sharp's strategic notion that Germany should, in the
early game, strive to keep Austria strong to reduce both powers
vulnerability as central (and surrounded) powers. Although they
take their name from the annexation of Austria by Nazi-Germany
in March 1938, Anschluss alliances are generally regarded as
essentially pro-Austrian, with Germany using diplomatic leverage
to discourage other powers -- in particularly Russia (with the
threat of standing him out of Sweden in 1901) -- from attacking
his ally. Tactically, Anschluss openings entail F Kie-Den and
A Ber-Kie.  Munich either HOLDs or stands off in Burgundy or Tyrolia
(the pure Anschluss), or even enters Tyrolia or Bohemia, with Italy
told that this unit will aid Austria if Italy attacks. The advantage
for Germany is that it is statistically evident that Germany is far
less likely to win if Austria is eliminated early in the game.
There are three variants:
<ul>
<li>Sudetenland Variant  (A Mun-Boh);
<li>Tyrolean Variant  (A Mun-Tyr);
<li>Silesia Variant   (A Mun-Sil).
</ul>
The pure Anschluss is Germany's fourth most common opening. Unless a standoff
in Burgundy occurs, it bespeaks an aggressive German player almost certainly
allied with England. A standoff is more ambiguous, but may be Germany's attempt
to head off a France-England-Russian blitz.
<P>
<i>[Notice that the opening using Mun-Ruh is not considered an Anschluss
opening.  Rather, this is the Danish Blitzkreig, the most popular German
opening.]</i>
END

ger-ansch-sil|ANSCHLUSS, SILESIA VARIANT
This opening shows Munich's role as &quot;swing&quot; unit. The
order alerts Russia to an attack but put him in some difficulty.
Germany can still change attack (A Sil-Gal) in the Fall. A common
alternative, A Mun-Kie, A Ber-Pru is much weaker. A Russian attack
(A War-Sil, A Mos-War) will put Germany at a disadvantage. There
is also no way to change tack save retreat (A Pru-Ber).
END

ger-rhineland|RHINELAND OPENING
Named by Manus Hand, this opening gives Germany two units to attack Burgundy
in Fall, while providing a say in the Lowlands and Scandinavia.  One advantage
to this opening is that if France has entered Burgundy, Germany is sure to
protect Munich without risking the inability to build a fleet at either or
both of his ports.  If an Anglo-French attack is foreseen, the Sudetenland is
a good choice.
END

ger-barb|PRUSSIAN OPENING, THE BARBAROSSA
This opening, named by Richard Sharp, is Germany's most aggressive
opening towards the east, sending Mun-Sil and Ber-Pru. Note that both
Holland and Belgium are ignored, virtually asking for an English convoy
to Holland. In addition to the
Barbarossa Proper (F Kie-BAL), there are two variations: the Danish variant
(F Kie-Den) and the Dutch variant (F Kie-Hol).
END

ger-blitz|BLITZKRIEG OPENING
The Blitzkrieg openings involve a westward move by the German armies,
with Berlin moving to Kiel and Munich to Ruhr.  These are far and away 
the most common German openings, and there are three named variants:
<ul>
<li>Danish Variant (F Kie-Den)
<li>Dutch Variant (F Kie-Hol)
<li>Baltic Variant (F Kie-BAL)
</ul>
END
ger-blitz-hol|BLITZKRIEG OPENING, DUTCH VARIATION
This is the second most popular German
opening. Compared to the Danish Blitzkrieg, this trades German influence
in Scandinavia for a stronger hand in Belgium, plus a slightly
stronger defensive position.
<P>
This is the basic opening where England is an ally, Russia is
neutral, and France is the objective. Even so, nothing has yet
been done to antagonize France directly. Ruhr can go to Begiuml
with Holland's support, or can defend Munich if the French entered Burgundy.
In the latter event, F Hol-Bel still denies the center to France.
F Hol could also support an English unit into Belgium.
END
ger-blitz-den|BLITZKREIG OPENING, DANISH VARIANT
This is the most popular German opening, and also the most popular
opening for any country. It guarantees two neutrals against any offense,
gives Germany leverage in Sweden and Belgium, and usually will offend
no one. If no one has moved adjacent to him, he will have great
flexibility in Fall, and all home centres will be open for builds.
<P>
This is the basic opening where France is an ally, Russia is
neutral or suspect, and England is the objective. The Denmark fleet can deny
Sweden to Russia. Germany also has a lock on Holland (A Kie-Hol,
A Ruh S A Kie-Hol), and can defend Berlin and still take
Holland (so long as England does not stop him).
END
ger-blitz-bal|BLITZKRIEG OPENING, BALTIC VARIANT
Also known as the Baltic Opening, this is a German attack starting in
Scandinavia rather than in the Polish
corridor.  The fall continuation is F BAL-Swe, A Kie-Den, A Ruh-Hol/Bel. If
Sweden is taken, BAL can be retaken via F Swe S Kie-BAL, followed
by F BAL C Den-Lvn! If not, F BAL S Den-Swe, plus, new armies
enter Polish corridor. Requires solid knowledge of English, French
(and Italian) intentions.
END

ger-silesian|SILESIAN OPENING
Any involving the move A Ber-Sil.  The following named variants exist:
<ul>
<li>Frederich Variation
<li>Slavic Attack
</ul>
END
ger-frederich|SILESIAN OPENING, FREDERICH VARIANT
Also known as the Frederich Opening, this opening was named by John Mark.
France should be pleased and more inclined to move against England, and Silesia
can guard Munich against A Bur-Mun just as well as Kiel can. It also gives
protection against A War-Sil.
END
ger-slav|SILESIAN OPENING, SLAVIC ATTACK
Again, Munich is the &quot;swing.&quot; Here Germany goes after
Russia <i>and</i> Austria, or Austria alone. Both armies threaten Galicia
as well as two supply centers. Against Austria alone, A Boh-Vie,
A Sil-Gal will hurt.
END

ger-holland|DUTCH OPENING
Richard Sharp's name for any German opening using F Kie-Hol and
A Ber-Kie. There are three named variations: the Burgundy Attack, the
Silesian and the Tyrolian. There are no prizes for guessing what
the differences are.
END

ger-holland-burg|DUTCH OPENING, BURGUNDY ATTACK VARIANT
This is Germany's third most common
opening, and a standoff in Bur may well be arranged. This is
Germany's most westerly oriented opening, and its success is
usually dependent on who, if anyone, has entered the English
Channel.
<P>
This is almost the same as the Dutch Blitzkrieg (where Munich moves to Ruhr).
It shows the role of A Mun as Germany's &quot;swing&quot; unit.
It sets the tone and direction of Germany's opening. England
is an ally, Russia is neutral, and France is the objective. The
attack on Burgundy is a direct assault on France. It may stand
off an unsupported French move to Burgundy. If Germany's attack
succeeds, the blow to French defenses is serious.&quot;
END

ger-jutland|[JUTLAND GAMBIT]
Edi Birsan's Fall continuation of the Danish Blitzkrieg, which delays the
choice of first victim until Spring of 1902.  The Fall 1901 orders are:
F Den-SKA, A Kie-Den, and A Ruh-Hol. Note that Germany writes off Belgium
entirely, but is a little less vulnerable to a double cross in the north.
END

ger-nta|[NORTHERN TIER ALLIANCE OPENING]
This fall continuation is based on an E/F/G triple alliance.
England convoys to Denmark, with A Mar-Pie and A Mun-Tyr for an immediate
southern attack.
Subsequently, England builds a minimum of fleets, France builds
mostly F Mar. (The opening was named by Richard Hucknall in FOE #57)
END

ger-prussian|PRUSSIAN OPENING
Richard Sharp's name for any opening which uses the move A Ber-Pru.
The most famous named variant is the Barbarossa, which sends Munich to Silesia
to launch a full-scale war on Russia.
END

ger-sealion|[SEALION]
Edi Birsan's strong anti-English continuation of the Danish
Blitzkrieg, as detailed in his <A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/S1997M/Birsan/Sealion.html
TARGET=_top>Diplomatic Pouch Article</A>.
<P>
Supported by a French fleet in the English Channel, Germany forces his way
into the North Sea in Fall of 1901, while taking Denmark and Holland with
armies.  In Spring of 1902, Germany and France both attempt convoys onto
England, and at least one is guaranteed to succeed.  Named after Hitler's
plan to attack England from out of the Low Countries, this opening gained
rapid popularity in the late 1990's in e-mail play.
One example is Bif Smithson's Diplomatic Pouch article <A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/F1997R/Smithson/seaart.html
TARGET=_top>The Sealion Opening in Action</A>.
END

ger-koniggratz|[KONIGGRATZ FREAKOUT]
Edi Birsan's offbeat German-Italian continuation to Italy's Alpine Chicken
Opening.  With A Ven S Pie-Tyr in the Fall, the German army in Tyrolia is 
dislodged, allowing it to retreat to whichever of Vienna
or Trieste Austria leaves open. In addition to this benefit, Italy's opening
move to Piedmont provides some assurance to Germany that the French army in
Burgundy will not be tempted to go for Munich,
especially if Germany notified France that he will open A Mun-Tyr.
END

ger-wmandmary|[WILLIAM AND MARY OPENING]
William Oosten's alternative to the Sealion is detailed
in his Diplomatic Pouch article, "<A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/F1997M/Oosten/WmandMary.html
TARGET=_top>The William and Mary Opening</A>:"
<P>
"Given a friendly Russia and a hostile Italy, Germany opens seemingly
anti-French, while France rushes south. By 1902, France and Germany
join their navies to acquire the English Channel and the North
Sea. Once F/G rule the waves, they have their way with England."
<P>
Germany moves his fleet into Belgium, while the French fleet
presumably bounces in the English Channel in the Spring and 
goes to the Mid-Atlantic in the Fall. All this is maintains a peaceful
attitude towards England until the Winter builds - 2 fleets.
Criticism of this opening is that Germany, with 3 builds, might be too
strong, since France might have to defend Marseilles and only get 1.
END

ger-danish|DANISH GAMBIT
Don Scheifler's name for the opening involving Kiel-Holland and Berlin-Munich.
It passes on the build from Denmark the first year, in order
to gain position against France, usually picking up both Holland and Belgium.
It is very effective at splitting an F/E alliance that may have been
planned against Germany, causing England to become involved in a war against
Russia.   Germany is often able to choose his ally the second year, either
taking Denmark with Russia's help, or moving against France with help from
England.  The strong western front also helps convince Italy to move to
Pie/Wes in Spring '02.   Or with good negotiating, a fleet build in Kiel can
even gain France as an ally against England.  The opening provides a Kaiser
with a great number of options, while throwing western neighbors off balance
during the first crucial years.  In the pure Danish Gambit, Munich opens to
Ruhr.  If it opens to Burgundy, the opening can be
transformed into a Panther opening.
END

ger-panther|[PANTHER]
This Fall Austro-Italo-German continuation 
was named by Dan Abbott after Kaiser Wilhelm II's sending the German
gunboat <i>Panther</i> to Africa in 1911.  The opening presents a combined
front by the Central Powers (A/G/I) in an attempt to guarantee control of
Africa and the Gibraltar block by controlling the Mediterranean.  To do this,
the rivals Mediterranean powers (France and Turkey) must be taught a lesson.
<P>
In Spring, Austria opens to pressure the Ionian, while Italy does a Swiss
Lepanto and Germany opens to Burgundy and Holland.  The pure Panther sees
occupation of Serbia and Kiel in Spring 1901, but other variations are
possible, which also put pressure on Russia.
<P>
In Fall, the Italian army in Apulia is convoyed to Albania by the Austrian
fleet, while Italy takes Tunis, and both Germany and Italy continue to
harass France in Marseilles, Burgundy, and Belgium.  While France is
occupied by pressure on his entire eastern border, Turkey sees two hostile
fleets coming at him.  The remaining two powers, England and Russia, should
be pleased by the opening. Russia is able to not only get in on the
Turkish party but also appeased by Germany's lack of Scandinavian force.
England is also satisfied with the Scandinavian lines and can help out with
France.
END
