END

aus-gambit-but|BUTLER GAMBIT
Named after Christian Butler, the Butler Gambit sends both armies north,
abandoning the Balkans for an immediate attack on Germany.  It should be
used only if assistance against a belligerent German is guaranteed, and
if free passage to Greece and a safe Trieste is guaranteed.
END

aus-hedgehog-but|BUTLER HEDGEHOG (NANAMAVEU)
Named after Christian Butler, the Butler Hedgehog (also called the
Nanamaveu) is an abandonment of the Balkans in favor of an all out
attack on Italy (or an application of early pressure on Germany).
It should be used only if the Turk can be counted on to allow later
Balkan growth for Austria, and Russia is friendly, if not dedicated
to a full German attack.
END

aus-bluewater-but|BUTLER BLUE WATER (MANAWEG)
Named after Christian Butler, the Butler Blue Water (also called the
Manaweg) is an abandonment of the Balkans which puts Italy in a
position to look for gains in the north.
END

aus-sd|SITTING DUKE
Owen Kavanaugh's name for the ineffectual Austrian opening which sends only
Trieste to Albania.  Once played in a game in which Italy solicited and
received permission for a Key Opening, the opening succeeded in resolving
a brewing Russo-Turkish war, since they found something they could do
together.
END

aus-balgam|BALKAN GAMBIT
The Balkan Gambit is any opening sending Trieste to Albania and Budapest to
Serbia.  The gambit here is that Austria will find a friendly Italian and
Russian, who will allow the dual monarchy to achieve two builds, from Greece
and Serbia, without fear of losing any of the Austrian home centers.  In the
Balkan Gambit, the burden of defense is left mostly to the Vienna army. What
the Austrian player does with that unit depends on whom he distrusts most.
In its pure form, the Vienna army is ordered to hold, but the gambit has a
number of variants, based on the order for the Vienna army:
<ul>
<li>the Bohemia Aberration,
<li>the Budapest Variation,
<li>the Galician Variation, 
<li>the Trieste Variation, 
<li>the Tyrolean Variation, 
<li>the Vienna Lemming Variation.
</ul>
Concerning the pure Balkan Gambit (A Vie H), the <i>Gamer's Guide to
Diplomacy</i> says that "this non-move may keep everybody happy, but it is
very passive and not recommended. It allows the defense of A Vie-Bud, A
Ser-Bud if Russia has ordered A War-Gal. (However, if Russia then orders A
Gal S Ser-Bud the result could be only one build or none in 1901!)"
END
aus-balgam-boh|BALKAN GAMBIT, BOHEMIA ABERRATION
Richard Sharp's name for the opening F Tri-Alb, A Bud-Ser, A
Vie-Boh. Also known as Fisher's Folly.
<P>
About this variant, <i>The Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> says,
"A Vie-Boh is marginal: if Russia is absolutely friendly,
and if there is definitely an Anglo-German alliance against France,
it provides good options. It will help preserve the Balance of
power in the west."
END
aus-balgam-bud|BALKAN GAMBIT, BUDAPEST VARIATION
The Balkan Gambit with A Vie-Bud. Austria thus takes no defensive
measures against Italy or Russia. In return, he has two pieces
adjacent to Rum. He can also accept Russian support into Bul
and still have A Bud-Ser. See Ionian Gauntlet and Key Opening.
END
aus-balgam-gal|BALKAN GAMBIT, GALICIAN VARIATION
The Balkan Gambit with A Vie-Gal. The opening defends against Russian entry
into Galicia, and when the Austrian succeeds in taking Galicia, he has
two units on Rumania plus the threat to Warsaw -- which may well distract
a Ukraine army away from Rumania.  On the down side, this opening risks the loss
of Trieste. But if the move to Galicia fails, Austria has shielded two home
centres from attack, and is in a decent position to limit further mischief
from any Italian army that does get into Trieste.
<P>
The <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> notes that, "here the object of distrust
is Russia.  If Turkey is friendly (F Alb-Gre) may still succeed. Austria thus
has the possibility of 3 builds.  The Fall 1901 move A Gal-Ukr is also made
possible." This provides a devastating position for 1902.
END
aus-balgam-tri|BALKAN GAMBIT, TRIESTE VARIATION
The Balkan Gambit with A Vie-Tri, designed to defend against
Italy. The paradox is that an Italian attack is more likely to
begin with A Ven-Tyr rather than A Ven-Tri. If there is a A Tyr,
A Ven you can still force Italy to guess (Vie or supported attack
on Tri), being able to divert A Ser to defend Tri. This is the
single most popular Austrian opening.
<P>
The <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> says,
"this is virtually <i>the</i> opening for Austria. It is followed
by F Alb-Gre and A Ser S Alb-Gre, gaining two centers. Austria should
make no other opening without sound and sufficient reason.
In this opening, the object of distrust is Italy, though the Trieste
army can still defend against Russia if she opened to Galicia. As in
The Galician Variation, however, the defense is primarily a guessing game."
END
aus-balgam-tyr|BALKAN GAMBIT, TYROLIAN VARIATION
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: F Tri-Alb, A Bud-Ser, A
Vie-Tyr. Useful if you suspect that Italy will open with the
Tyrolian attack and if you can trust Russia.
END
aus-balgam-vie|BALKAN GAMBIT, VIENNA LEMMING VARIATION
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: F Tri-Alb, A Bud-Ser, A
Vie S A Ven-Tyr. The fact that this opening has been named means that
apparently someone has used it.
END

aus-bwo|BLUE WATER OPENING
Any opening sending the Trieste fleet to the Adriatic Sea.
The von Metzke Blitz (a.k.a. the Italian Attack) is recognized as
a variant of the Blue Water Opening.
END

aus-galgam|GALICIAN GAMBIT
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: F Tri-Alb, A Vie-Tri, and A Bud-Gal.
END
aus-hogal|GALICIAN GAMBIT, HEAD-ON GALICIAN VARIANT
The Head-On Galician is Richard Sharp's name for the opening: F Tri-Alb,
A Vie-Gal and A Bud-Gal.  Sure to keep Galicia vacant or Austrian, it is
among the safer Gambits, but relies entirely on Italian and Turkish 
friendship to be able to earn a single 1901 build.
END

aus-hedgehog|HEDGEHOG
Any Austrian opening which orders the Trieste fleet into Venice.
In its pure form, the Hedgehog sends Vienna to Galicia and Budapest to Rumania.
A number of variants exist, based on the orders given to the Austrian armies:
<ul>
<li>Alpine Variation
<li>Porcupine Variation
<li>Dead Porcupine Variation
<li>Fisher's Folly
<li>Southern Hedgehog
</ul>
Richard Sharp's
<a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/hedgehog.htm>article on the
Hedgehog</a> provides more information, and Richard Hucknall, in his
<a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/asset.htm><i>The Hedgehog:
An Asset ot Liability?</i></a>, provides some counterpoint.
END
aus-hedgehog-alp|HEDGEHOG, ALPINE VARIATION
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: F Tri-Ven, A Vie-Tyr, and A Bud-Gal.
END
aus-hedgehog-dpv|HEDGEHOG, DEAD PORCUPINE VARIATION
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: F Tri-Ven, A Vie S Bud-Gal.
END
aus-hedgehog-ffv|HEDGEHOG, FISHER'S FOLLY VARIATION
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: F Tri-Ven, A Bud-Rum, A Vie-Boh.
END
aus-hedgehog-por|HEDGEHOG, PORCUPINE VARIATION
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: F Tri-Ven, A Bud S Vie-Gal.
END
aus-hedgehog-sou|HEDGEHOG, SOUTHERN VARIATION
Better known as the Southern Hedgehog. The opening: F Tri-Ven, A Bud-Ser,
and A Vie-Gal.  Named and popularised by Richard Sharp. 
END

aus-hsj|[HOP, STEP AND JUMP OPENING]
Named by Iain Forsyth, this Austro-Russian opening sends Budapest to
Rumania, followed in the fall by a Russian convoy of A Rum-Ank. The Warsaw
army is sent to Galicia as Springtime camouflage.
END

aus-roadhog|ROADHOG
Any Austrian opening that orders Trieste to HOLD and Budapest to Rumania.
END

aus-housboat|HOUSEBOAT OPENING
The Houseboat is Richard Sharp's name for any opening in which the Trieste
fleet is ordered to HOLD, and Budapest is sent to Serbia.  In its pure form
(also known as the Southern Variation), Vienna is ordered to Galicia.  A
number of variants exist, based on the order given to the Vienna army:
<ul>
<li>Crichton's Variation
<li>Hungarian Variation
<li>Paranoia Defense
<li>Northern Houseboat
<li>Tyrolian Variation
</ul>
END
aus-housboat-nth|HOUSEBOAT, NORTHERN VARIATION
Manus Hand's name for the Houseboat opening that sends Vienna to Bohemia.
END
aus-housboat-cri|HOUSEBOAT, CRICHTON'S VARIATION
Richard Sharp's name for the opening used by David Crichton in
a game in Dolchstoss (DS19): F Tri H, A Bud-Ser, A Vie H.
END
aus-housboat-hun|HOUSEBOAT, HUNGARIAN VARIATION
Also known as the Hungarian Houseboat. Richard Sharp's name for the opening:
F Tri H, A Bud-Ser, A Vie-Bud.
END
aus-housboat-tyr|HOUSEBOAT, HUNGARIAN VARIATION
Also known as the Tyrolian Houseboat. Richard Sharp's name for the opening:
F Tri H, A Bud-Ser, A Vie-Tyr.
END
aus-housboat-par|HOUSEBOAT, PARANOIA DEFENCE
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: A Vie S F Tri, A Bud-Ser.  This is
simply Crichton's Houseboat with a meaningless twist.  A silly opening indeed,
useless even in no-press games, as its meaning is unfathomable.
END

aus-ionian|[IONIAN GAUNTLET]
Edi Birsan's take-charge opening for Austria: in Fall, Serbia goes for Greece,
the other army is sent to Serbia, and the Austrian fleet moves to the Ionian
Sea.  This gives Austria a more forward position for Spring 1902, at the risk
of losing Greece.
END

aus-italy|BLUE WATER OPENING, VON METZKE BLITZ
Also known as the Italian Attack, this is one example of the many fully
committal attacks that can be launched
in Spring 1901, in this case by Austria on Italy. As such it is a suitable
contrast with the Hedgehog opening.  If Italy opens with A Rom-Nap, he's lost
Venice -- though the Balkans are for Russia and Turkey to carve up. This
opening is invariably popular with Turkey, Italy's perennial rival in the
Mediterranean, but is usually regarded as one of the more "bizarre" openings.
Being Conrad von Metzke's favourite Austrian opening, it is known as the
von Metzke Blitz or the von Metzke Opening.  Some claim that the poor
statistics for Austria in the early days of the hobby are due in part to
Conrad's penchant for both Austria and this opening.
<P>
The <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> says, "This seemingly suicidal set of
orders has on rare occasions given good results.  These orders might be used
in the special circumstance that Austria is allied with Russia <b>and</b>
Turkey. The alliance strategy would call for the rapid destruction of Italy in
order to hit France and break into the Atlantic. Even so, Austria is usually
foolish to give up Serbia."
END

aus-kenkey|[KENDALL KEY OPENING]
A variation on the Key in which Austria orders A Bud S A Ser-Rum
in Fall of 1901. Thus, the Aus attack on Russia is delayed until F01 to
allow a Russo-Turkish war to develop. (The variant was discussed by Alan
Wells in issue #6 of <i>Dot Happy</i>.)
END

aus-rumgam|RUMANIAN GAMBIT
A series of Austrian openings named by Richard Sharp involving
the moves F Tri-Alb and A Bud-Rum. There are three named variations:
<ul>
<li>The Balkan Roadhog (A Vie-Gal).
<li>McGivern's Gambit (A Vie-Bud),
<li>Tyroleses Variation (A Vie-Tyr).
</ul>
END
aus-rumgam-road|RUMANIAN GAMBIT, BALKAN ROADHOG VARIANT
The variant of the Rumanian Gambit which sends Vienna to Galicia.
<P>
Tony Swinnerton's Diplomatic Pouch article, "<A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/W1997A/Swinnerton/Lepanto.html
TARGET=_top>Playing the Key Lepanto</A>," recommends it in conjunction with
an unusual Italian/Austrian alliance opening.

END
aus-rumgam-mcg|RUMANIAN GAMBIT, McGIVERN'S GAMBIT VARIANT
McGivern's Gambit is the variant of the Rumanian Gambit that sends
Vienna to Budapest.
END
aus-rumgam-tyr|RUMANIAN GAMBIT, TYROLESES VARIATION
The variant of the Rumanian Gambit which sends Vienna to Tyrolia.
END

aus-rusfrol|[RUSSIAN FROLIC]
Allen Wells' name for the Austro-Turkish opening based on A Vie-Gal, A Bud-Rum,
A Con H, A Smy-Arm, F Ank-Bla. The key here is A Con H which,
by eliminating Turkey's 1901 risk to Serbia, permits Austria
to move safely to Rum. Discussed in issue 29 of <i>Diplomacy World</i>.
END

aus-tyrgam|TYROLESE GAMBIT
Richard Sharp's name for the opening: F Tri-Alb, A Bud-Tri, A Vie-Tyr.
END

aus-warthog|RUMANIAN GAMBIT, WARTHOG VARIANT
The Warthog is Richard Sharp's name for the rarely-used Austrian opening
(0.87%): F Tri-Alb, A Vie-Gal and, A Bud-Rum. Richard writes that it is
"a new name for something resembling a Hedgehog, but not as pretty."
END

aus-bulgam|[BULGARIAN GAMBIT]
This Austro-Russian combination requires a careful diplomatic setup of
Turkey, but guarantees to keep the Turk at three SC's by the end of 1901.
Austria opens with Tri-Alb and Bud-Ser, while Russia sends the Sevastopol
fleet to Rumania.  In the Fall, Turkey is convinced by one or both of
Austria and Russia to attempt a move out of Bulgaria, and A/R combine to
dislodge the unsupportable Bulgaria.  Doug Beyerlein wrote
<a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/bulgarian.htm>an article
on the Bulgarian Gambit</a>.
END

aus-panther|[PANTHER]
This Fall Austro-Italo-German continuation of the Blue Water
Opening was named by Dan Abbott after Kaiser Wilhelm II's sending the German
gunboat <i>Panther</i> to Africa in 1911.  The opening presents a combined
front by the Central Powers (A/G/I) in an attempt to guarantee control of
Africa and the Gibraltar block by controlling the Mediterranean.  To do this,
the rivals Mediterranean powers (France and Turkey) must be taught a lesson.
<P>
In Spring, Austria opens to pressure the Ionian, while Italy does a Swiss
Lepanto and Germany opens to Burgundy and Holland.  The pure Panther sees
occupation of Serbia and Kiel in Spring 1901, but other variations are
possible, which also put pressure on Russia.
<P>
In Fall, the Italian army in Apulia is convoyed to Albania by the Austrian
fleet, while Italy takes Tunis, and both Germany and Italy continue to
harass France in Marseilles, Burgundy, and Belgium.  While France is
occupied by pressure on his entire eastern border, Turkey sees two hostile
fleets coming at him.  The remaining two powers, England and Russia, should
be pleased by the opening. Russia is able to not only get in on the
Turkish party but also appeased by Germany's lack of Scandinavian force.
England is also satisfied with the Scandinavian lines and can help out with
France.
END
aus-bwl|[BLUE WATER LEPANTO]
Manus Hand's Fall 1901 continuation of the Blue Water Opening has Austria
virtually forcing himself into Italy's Lepanto convoy chain by the creation
of a perceived threat to Venice that forces Italy to take Tunis by fleet,
vacating the Ionian Sea.
The Austrian (who opened to the Adriatic) sails
to the Ionian in Fall of 1901 to be the victim of an arranged dislodgement
by the Italian fleets in Naples and Tunis.  Austria's fleet then surprises
Turkey by retreating eastward to form part of the convoy chain that carries
the Italian army to Anatolia.  Described in
<a target=_parent href=/Zine/W1999A/Hand/bwl.html>an article
in The Pouch Zine</a> by Manus Hand and in
<a target=_parent href=/Zine/F2000M/Pillie/bluewater.html>a follow-up article</a> by
Derek Pillie.
