comment|--ABOUT THE RUSSIAN OPENINGS--
Russia has more possible opening moves than any other power.
In order to produce a rationalised system for naming Russian
openings, Richard Sharp introduced the following plan:
<ol>
<li>F StP/sc H openings are known as the Northern Houseboat Opening.
<li>F StP/sc-Lvn is known as the Kronstadt Opening.
<li>F StP/sc-Fin is known as the Lapland Lurch, but otherwise considered (for
	the purpose of naming openings) as equivalent to a move to the Gulf of
	Bothnia.  These openings are named after the order of A Moscow.
There are therefore six systems for openings involving F StP/sc-BOT or
F StP/sc-Fin:
<ul>
<li>The Inertia System (A Mos H),
<li>the Livonia System (A Mos-Lvn),
<li>the Northern System (A Mos-StP),
<li>the Southern System (A Mos-Sev),
<li>the Ukraine System (A Mos-Ukr), and
<li>the Warsaw System (A Mos-War).
</ul>
</ol>
END

rus-ukr-aa|UKRAINE SYSTEM, AUSTRIAN ATTACK VARIANT
Russia's second most popular opening, this
generally means that Russia is confident he has a Turkish
ally against Austria. A drawback is that the fleet in Rumania is
poorly placed.
<P>
Russia must usually choose between a northern or southern strategy.
This means putting her eggs in the appropriate basket. Here she
is allied with Turkey against Austria. If there is a stand-off
in Galicia or Rumania, there will be support for the same order
in the Fall.
END

rus-inertia|INERTIA SYSTEM
Richard Sharp's name for the Russian opening: F StP/sc-Fin/BOT,
A Mos H. There is one named variant: A War-Ukr, the Ukraine variant.
END

rus-lapland|LAPLAND LURCH
The F StP/sc-Fin opening. If Russia anticipates both A Nor-Fin
and F Den-Swe in Spring of 1902 (after a Fall standoff in Sweden), F Fin can
block both, but F BOT cannot. If Russia anticipates Germany building
F Kie in Winter 1901, F Fin is much less threatening, making it much
easier for Germany to move against England.
<P>
Regarding the Lapland Lurch, however, the <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i>
advises, "F StP/sc-BOT is the only reasonable opening for that unit. The
alternatives, to Finland or Livonia, accomplish nothing. Put
the fleet in its proper place: on water."
<P>
Mark Berch provides more information in
<a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/asset.htm>his article
devoted to the Lurch.</a>
END

rus-livlun|KRONSTADT OPENING (a.k.a. LIVONIAN LUNACY)
Russia's F StP/sc-Lvn opening. If Russia wishes to distract Germany
away from F Den-Swe in Fall 1901 with a threat to the Baltic, Lvn is
a better place to make the threat, since it has no other good
place to go. This opening is discussed in
<a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/lunacy.htm>Mark Berch's
article on the subject</a>.
END

rus-north-liv|NORTHERN SYSTEM, LIVONIA VARIANT
The intent of this opening is to convoy the Warsaw army into Sweden in Fall
of 1901, while posting the Moscow army in Finland.
Popularized by Don Turnbull in an article on playing Russia published in
<i>Games &amp; Puzzles</i>, the opening gives up to
three units bearing on Norway in Spring 1902 -- but at the expense
of serious exposure on the Southern Flank. This may be acceptable if
Austria can be relied on to contain Turkey, but the lack of influence on
Rumania deprives Russia of the near certainty of a build.
At the time that Turnbull recommended this
opening, the common opening move for F Kie was to Hol; it was
unusual for Germany to move to Den. It was even more unusual
for Germany to stand Russia out of Sweden. Hence, Russian players
expected to take Sweden in Autumn 1901 as a matter of course. It
was common for Russia to have six centres at the end of 1901, having
taken Rumania and Sweden, and not unusual for Russia to be on seven, taking
an Austrian centre as a result of Austria opening with a Balkan
Gambit, allowing Russia into Galicia in Spring 1901. So the move
to Livonia with intent to convoy to Sweden is not as strange as first
appears. 
<P>
This is a Northern attack, against England. If Russia puts her
eggs in that basket, she may as well trust Turkey and get into
Rumania. Even if the Turks take Sevastopol, Russia may be able
to make peace and concentrate on a northern offensive. There
is nothing wrong with a Russo-Turkish alliance even when the
Turks are overly greedy in the South. This opening threatens
to keep England out of Norway while convoying an army into Sweden.
To be really diabolical, order A StP-Fin, A Lvn-BOT-Swe, and
build F StP/nc.
END

rus-livonia|LIVONIAN SYSTEM
In Richard Sharp's rationalised system for naming Russian openings, the
Livonian system refers to any Russian opening using the moves F StP/sc-Fin/BOT
and A Mos-Lvn. There are three named variations: the Ukraine variation,
the Galician Variation and the German Attack Variation (A War-Sil).
END

rus-north-gal|NORTHERN SYSTEM, GALICIA VARIATION
This is the most pro-Turkey of all the Northern System openings.
In this opening, Russia has simply not made up her mind. She
is going after Austria and England at the same time. If she has
alliances with France, Germany, Italy, and Turkey, these are
not bad orders. They make the most of Russia's unique position
on the board.
END

rus-north-ukr|NORTHERN SYSTEM, UKRAINE VARIATION
This is about the lowest profile
Russia can keep in the South and still send an army there, and
may indicate Russia believes that there is triple R-A-T alliance
to be had.
END

rus-northern|NORTHERN SYSTEM
Richard Sharp's name for any Russian opening using the moves
F StP/sc-BOT (or Fin) and A Mos-StP. There are seven named variations:
<ol>
<li>the Galician (A War-Gal, F Sev-Rum)
<li>the Octopus  (A War-Gal, F Sev-BLA)
<li>the Squid    (A War-Ukr, F Sev-BLA)
<li>the Ukraine  (A War-Ukr, F Sev-Rum)
<li>the Hammer   (A War-Mos)
<li>the Livonian (A War-Lvn)
<li>the German Attack (A War-Sil)
</ol>
END

rus-octopus|NORTHERN SYSTEM, OCTOPUS VARIANT
This opening appears to be very belligerent,
but the southern moves can be sold as defensive measures to compensate
for the fact that only one army is sent south. Neither Turkey
nor Austria should feel seriously threatened, as Russia has apparently
moved on the other as well, and a joint attack on both Austria
and Turkey hardly seems likely if Russia also opens to StP.
Often, at least one of the southern moves will be an arranged standoff.
<p>
Named by (and a favorite of) Richard Sharp, the Octupus combines
a strong defense in the south with an uncommonly powerful assault
on Scandinavia. The name presumably derives from the way the
opening exploits Russia's interests in so many spheres, spreading
tentacles into several areas.  The Russian player who opens with
this can expect to upset England, who usually looks to Norway
as his only guaranteed build -- in a game with an Octopus, only
a full blown Northern Opening 
(F Lon-NTH, F Edi-NWG, A Lon-Yor) from England will do. A variation
of this opening, also named by Richard Sharp, is the
Squid, which takes on both the corner powers with A War-Ukr.
<P>
Richard Sharp's complete thoughts on this, his favorite Russian
opening, are in his
<a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/octopus.htm>article
on the subject</a>.
END

rus-rumanian|SOUTHERN SYSTEM, RUMANIAN OPENING
The extremely southern commitment which sees Russia occupy Rumania,
Ukraine, and Sevastopol. Thought anti-Austrian, but in fact is
non-committal and mainly defensive (hence the choice of Ukraine
over Galicia). Mos-Sev protects against a Turkish attack, and
Rumania can be given two supports if Austria and Turkey are mobilizing
to attack the Bear (which still might not be enough to keep the
center, but it's as good as you can get).   The Rumanian Opening Proper
sends Warsaw to Ukraine, but there are two named variants, the Galician
and the German Attack (A War-Sil).
END

rus-southern|SOUTHERN SYSTEM
Richard Sharp's name for any Russian opening using the moves
F StP/sc-Fin/BOT and A Mos-Sev. There are five named variations:
<ol>
<li>the Inertia Variation (A War H)
<li>the German Attack Variation (A War-Sil)
<li>the Rumanian Opening (F Sev-Rum)
<li>the Noah's Ark Variation (A War-Ukr, F Sev-Arm)
<li>the Turkish Attack (A War-Ukr, F Sev-BLA)
</ol>
END

rus-south-ta|SOUTHERN SYSTEM, TURKISH ATTACK VARIANT
Russia's third most popular opening,
this will turn out badly if Turkey orders F Ank-BLA
(thus stalling two units) or if Austria enters Gal. Russia retains
his options to either press an attack on Turkey, or content himself
with Rum, and use F BLA to try to keep the upper hand in any
subsequent Russo-Turkish alliance.
<P>
About this opening, <i>The Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> says,
"This is the anti-Turkish opening. In the Fall, A Sev-Arm promises
to give the Sultan apoplexy. It also leaves Sev open for the
build of a second fleet. If the Turks order F Ank-BLA they will
be stood off. The fleet can then move to Rumania with support
from Ukraine in the Fall again leaving Sev open for a second
fleet. Some players prefer the alternative F Sev-Rum in the Spring.
This is weaker, but does insure that A Mos-Sev succeeds so that
Armenia may be threatened. However, this creates a guessing game
around Rumania and Sevastopol if Turkey opens F Ank-BLA, A Con-Bul.
It's even worse if Turkey also opens A Smy-Arm."
END

rus-ukraine|UKRAINE SYSTEM
Richard Sharp's name for any Russian opening involving the moves
F StP/sc-Fin/BOT, A Mos-Ukr. There are five named variations:
<ol>
<li>the Austrian Attack (A War-Gal, F Sev-Rum)
<li>the Livonia Variation (A War-Lvn)
<li>the German Attack Variation (A War-Sil)
<li>the Southern Defence (A War-Gal, F Sev-BLA)
<li>the Southern Houseboat Variation (A War-Gal, F Sev H)
</ol>
END

rus-warsaw|WARSAW SYSTEM
Richard Sharp's name for the openings involving F StP/sc-Fin/BOT
and A Mos-War. There are three named variations:
<ol>
<li>the Galician (A War-Gal)
<li>the German Attack (A War-Sil)
<li>the Ukraine (A War-Ukr)
</ol>
END

rus-liv-ukr|LIVONIAN SYSTEM, UKRAINE VARIATION
This is a deliberately neutral opening and is more effective
than it looks. Russia hopes for two new centers and positions
her armies to cover her home centers in case of attack. At the
same time, she will have a number of offensive options in Fall
1901 (A Lvn-Swe or -Pru; A Ukr-Gal).
END

rus-war-sil|WARSAW SYSTEM, GERMAN ATTACK VARIANT
This is an anti-German opening. A Wal-Sil is preferable to A
War-Pru because it threatens two supply centers. The other army
can cover Warsaw, or attack Prussia, or move to Sweden. In the
last instance, F BOT-BAL is a killer in 1902. On occasion, Russia
just gives up Sweden and moves F BOT-BAL in Fall 1901. Watch
the German player have fits when that happens.  John Dennett
wrote <a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/gerattac.htm>a
complete article on the German Attack opening</a>.
END

rus-hsj|[HOP, STEP, AND JUMP OPENING]
Named by Iain Forsyth, this Austro-Russian opening sends Budapest to
Rumania, followed in the fall by a Russian convoy of A Rum-Ank. The Warsaw
army is sent to Galicia as Springtime camouflage.
END

rus-house|NORTHERN HOUSEBOAT OPENING
Richard Sharp's name for any opening in which F StP/sc holds in Spring 1901.
If Russia wishes to concentrate entirely on the south, this is the best
opening that can prove his intentions to England and Germany.  To Germany,
this says that no offense will be offered, and to England it emphasizes
that St. Petersburg will be defended.
END

rus-bulgam|[BULGARIAN GAMBIT]
This Austro-Russian combination requires a careful diplomatic setup of
Turkey, but guarantees to keep the Turk at three SC's by the end of 1901.
Austria opens with Tri-Alb and Bud-Ser, while Russia sends the Sevastopol
fleet to Rumania.  In the Fall, Turkey is convinced by one or both of
Austria and Russia to attempt a move out of Bulgaria, and A/R combine to
dislodge the unsupportable Bulgaria.  Doug Beyerlein wrote
<a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/bulgarian.htm>an article
on the Bulgarian Gambit</a>.
END

rus-slingshot|[SLINGSHOT JUGGERNAUT]
Manus Hand's Russo-Turkish Southern System continuation, which has
the Turkish Black Sea fleet and Ankara army dislodge Russia's fleet
from Armenia.  With Sevastopol unavailable for a retreat, the fleet is
forced to disband.  The opening is considered very safe for both parties,
and results in an even safer "water-power/land-power" configuration of
units.  Both Russia and Turkey lobby Austria intensely for support against
the other power, and when the Russian attack through Armenia fails,
Austria cannot blame Russia for trying and for
being unable to retreat his fleet.  For his part, Russia offers the "at
least I have tied up all his units in the east" line, while Turkey continues
to request Austrian help for his successful anti-Russian crusade.  In 1902,
however, the Turk convoys from Armenia through the Black Sea to Bulgaria
while Russia's now land-based forces hit the Austrian by surprise, typically
entering Galicia and supporting a Turkish attack on Serbia.
END

rus-magde|[MAGDEBURG]
Named after the German ship wrecked during WWI in the Baltic, which gave Great
Britain and Russia access to German naval codes for the remainder of the war,
this is Manus Hand's Anglo-Russian continuation (usually to the Northern
System).
England's task is to convince Germany to open to Denmark and then move to
stand Russia out of Sweden.  Russia opens to the Gulf of Bothnia, and, in
cahoots with his English ally, assists in isolating the German for a strong
1902 attack.  Russia avoids Sweden in Fall
of 1901 and instead sails to the Baltic.  Simultaneously, England takes the
vacated Denmark.  Norway can go to either England (the "Prince Louis
Madgeburg") or Russia (if Russia opens with a Northern System; this is the
"Benckendorff Magdeburg").  The Prince Louis (F NWG-Nor in Fall 1901) has
the diplomatic advantage of allowing England to claim shock and continued
friendship with Germany, but the Benckendorff can be used to force a Spring
disband of the German fleet (NWG HOLD in Fall 1901, then NWG-Nor and NTH-SKA
in Spring 1902 while Russia moves her Norway army to Finland and sends a newly
built fleet into the Gulf of Bothnia), forcing the German to play a unit
short in Fall of 1902.
END

rus-exch|[BLACK SEA EXCHANGE]
Aron Ambrosiani's name for the southern system follow-up which allows an
R/T alliance to get both fleets into the Mediterarnean.
<P>
In Spring 1901, Russia opens F Sev-Bla, while
Turkey opens the hedgehog. In fall 1901, Bla moves to Con, Arm to Sev
and Con to Aegean Sea, and the Turkish A Bul can help a Russian
army into Rumania.
<P>
The really hard thing with this variant is to the amount of trust it requires.
The Fall
moves are vital, since both countries move unsupported into each other's
centers.
END

rus-hammer|[NORTHERN HAMMER]
<a href=mailto:tarod@winternet.com>Brian Landwehr's</a> variation on the
Octopus which sends all of the Russian land strength into Scandinavia.
While this opening is thoroughly unorthodox and requires some heavy
diplomacy early on, it takes advantage of the fact that often
Russia's southern border is more flexible and negotiable than its
northern border is. In the north, you're either winning or losing, where
your southern border can flex a bit more. The 
Northern Hammer is an all-out attack on England with just a
touch of defense. In practice, it is much like the Octopus with a slight
twist.
<P>
The fleets open to both open to the water (the move to the Black is usually
an arranged bounce), with Moscow moving to St. Petersburg
and Warsaw to Moscow.
The move of the Warsaw army to Moscow sets you up for good diplomacy with
almost everyone on the board. Germany and Austria are happy with you for
moving directly away (and may think you've lost your mind). You can sell a
defensive theory to Turkey (A Mos S F Sev <i>ad infinitum</i>) and England at
this point sees nothing worse than he normally would in an Octopus. I
mean, at least you didn't move to Lvn, right?
<P>
In Fall, Rumania and Sweden are taken, if you've done your diplomacy right,
and the armies follow into the north, with St. Petersburg moving to Finland,
and Moscow to St. Petersburg.
This sets you up to kick England, and probably Germany, out of Scandinavia
in no time flat. It's strange enough that it puts people off their guard
and effective enough that it scares them just enough to keep people in
line if you succeed.
END
