comment|--ABOUT THE FRENCH OPENINGS--
The French openings are categorized by the order given to the Brest fleet,
as follows:
<ul>
<li>Manche (or English Attack) Openings (F Bre-ENG)
<li>Atlantic Openings (F Bre-MAO)
<li>Biscay Openings (F Bre-Gas)
<li>Norman Openings (F Bre-Pic)
</ul>
Many of the variants of each of these openings are recognized by unique names.
<P>
A big French problem is that she has almost too many possible openings. The
price of guessing wrong is often grim. In general, a valid French strategy is
to get Spain and Portugal in the opening, even at the price of losing a home
center.  For France, such a loss is frequently only temporary if her diplomacy
is sharp.
END

fra-norman|NORMAN OPENING
Any French Opening sending the fleet to Picardy.  The typical intent is
a pro-English occupation of Belgium, with pressure applied on Munich from
Burgundy.  If Belgium does not go to France, he is saddled with only one
build from Iberia.
END

fra-beau|BISCAY OPENING, BEAUJOLAIS NOUVEAU
The French equivalent of England's Yorkshire Pudding opening, the <i>Beaujolais
Nouveau</i> is actually much more useful.  It was mentioned in a very early
issue of the 'zine <i>Vienna</i>.  According to Aron Ambrosiani, the Swedish
player Per Larsson has been known to use this opening, taking a solo victory
with it at the 1998 LinCon convention.
END

fra-belgian|ATLANTIC OPENING, BELGIAN GAMBIT
The Atlantic Opening variant that brings two units to bear on Belgium.
Unless there is a standoff in Burgundy, France is able to mount a supported
attack on Belgium without worrying England with a fleet move in or near
northern waters.  For the better chance on Belgium (and pressure on
Munich), France passes up one of the two Iberia centers.
END
fra-burgundy|ATLANTIC OPENING, BURGUNDY VARIANT
In this very common Atlantic opening (better known as the Burgundy Opening),
there may be an arranged standoff in Burgundy, which guards Burgundy, permits
both Iberian centres to be taken, and still gives France some say in Belgium.
However, if A Par-Bur succeeds, Brest is less protected.  If Par-Bur fails and
Italy enters Piedmont, France has a guessing game to play in deciding whether
to protect Marseilles or guarantee himself Spain.
<P>
The <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> calls this opening "essentially
defensive. If A Par-Bur succeeds, France can try for Belgium, threaten Munich,
or protect Marseilles."
END
fra-english|MANCHE OPENING (a.k.a. ENGLISH ATTACK)
Any French opening that sends the fleet into the English Channel. English
Attack (or Manche) Openings account in popularity for one-quarter of all
French openings.
There are a number of named variants:
<ul>
<li>English Defense
<li>English Maginot
<li>Northern Dash
<li>Northern Limp
</ul>
It is commonly acknowledged that England is the trickiest power
to eliminate, courtesy of its island position and inevitable
emphasis on building fleets. Consequently, some players believe
that France must contain its northern neighbour early in the
game, and at all costs prevent England putting a fleet into the
Channel. F Bre-ENG may therefore be intended to stand off F Lon-ENG
rather than to actually threaten the English home centres. Alternatively,
this can be a bid by France to take Belgium, perhaps coupled
with the move A Par-Bur or A Par-Pic, in which case the name
may be a misnomer. This is not the most popular opening for the French
fleet: it is unlikely to result in a centre gain for France (unlike the
Atlantic Opening's F Bre-MAO), and compromises an assault on England by
most likely pinning down the Fleet in Brest, where the French player would
rather be building a second fleet.
END
fra-engdef|MANCHE OPENING, ENGLISH DEFENCE
Richard Sharp's name for the Manche opening F Bre-ENG, A Mar-Spa and
A Par-Gas.  This opening assures two builds, and is considered a
a very pro-German and pro-Italian opening.  Typically, it indicates that France
expects F Lon-ENG.
<P>
The <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> calls this "the best that
can be done in the event of dark suspicions
about England. Hopefully, France has an alliance with Germany.
It is not advisable to attack England this early, but if England
is going to try for the channel, she must be stopped. France
can still get Spain and Portugal this way, and those gains are
almost indispensable to French survival."
END
fra-engmag|MANCHE OPENING, ENGLISH MAGINOT
This is a legitimate alternative approach for taking Belgium, or the
opening can be used when an Anglo-German attack is believed to be imminent. 
END
fra-atlantic|ATLANTIC OPENING
Any opening sending the Brest fleet to the Mid-Atlantic Ocean.  There are
a many named variants:
<ul>
<li>Maginot Opening
<li>Gascony Opening
<li>Gaspic Opening
<li>Picardy Opening
<li>Vineyard Opening
<li>Italian Attack
<li>Piedmont System
</ul>
END
fra-gascony|ATLANTIC OPENING, GASCONY VARIANT
The pro-German Atlantic Opening (better known as the Gascony Opening)
that sends the armies into Spain and Gascony.
This denies France any say in Belgium, but provides him with a self-standoff in
either Marseilles or in Brest if there are units in Piedmont or the Channel. It
also gives France the ability to take both Iberian builds and still have the
fleet free to enter English or Italian waters in Fall 1901 or Spring 1902.
The drawback is that the armies will be holed up in Iberia by year's end,
and will take a while to return to action.
<P>
This can be tried when there is a strong chance of an Italian
attack. If Italy orders A Ven-Pie, France can order (in Fall
1901) A Gas-Mar, A Spa-Mar, F MAO-Por. Hopefully (barring an unwanted
support from Italy), Marseilles will be vacant for the build of a fleet,
which can be used to pull armies out of Iberia and into action.
END
fra-gaspic|ATLANTIC OPENING, GASPIC VARIANT
The Gaspic Opening is Richard Sharp's name for the Norman opening that
sends the Paris army to Gascony in an attempt to take both Iberian
centers.
END
fra-maginot|ATLANTIC OPENING, MAGINOT VARIANT
This opening, known simply as the Maginot Opening, is the most popular
French opening.
It assures that France can have a say in all three of her bordering
neutrals, and, if Italy enters Piedmont, Marseilles can be guarded without
risk to Spain. The mere threat to Munich usually pins down the German
army, making Belgium and Ruhr more accessible in Fall of 1901.
<p>
This strong opening assumes an understanding with England over the English
Channel, and though it must be regarded as anti-German, the opening
still allows France the opportunity to take three neutral centres
in Autumn (with A Bur-Bel, A Mar-Spa and F MAO-Por). Naming it
after the Maginot Line has emphasized its defensive qualities,
but there can be no doubt that the opening poses a direct threat
to Munich, and may signal a frontal assault on Germany by an
Anglo-French alliance. This is both a strength and a failing,
as it exposes France to a stab from England and is likely to
cause maximum offense to a neighbour who is not usually an initial
threat to France. However, it does assure the French player of
a say in Belgium's future (a useful bargaining chip even if France
cannot take the centre himself) without leaving Burgundy unguarded
-- and still allows him to take both the Iberian centres in 1901.
<P>
The <i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i> calls this opening "a more powerful
defense against Germany [than The Burgundy Opening] because A Par-Bur
always succeeds.  France can thus be assured of Spain and Portugal no matter
what Italy does. However, her fleet is relegated to a weaker position
in Portugal."
END
fra-northdash|MANCHE OPENING, NORTHERN DASH
This extremely pro-Italy opening is the ultimate in ignoring
Iberia. It discourages other powers from going for Belgium, while
preserving anti-German (if A Mar-Bur succeeds) or anti-English
(if F Bre-ENG succeeds) options for Fall 1901 and beyond.
<p>
The Northern Dash contrasts markedly with the Maginot Opening.
It is believed that the name was originally coined by Nicky
Palmer.
It is debatable whether the opening is aggressively defensive or
defensively aggressive: it could be seen as a French version of the Austrian
Hedgehog openings, standing off attacks from England (F Lon-ENG)
and Germany (A Mun-Bur); alternatively, it could be regarded
as an all-out bid for Belgium or attack on England. As a defensive
posture, it can only be regarded as a sign of failed diplomacy,
since if France can trust neither of his neighbours in 1901,
he is surely doomed. Moreover, it doesn't even offer complete
protection, as an Italian opening to Piedmont would expose Marseilles;
as an offensive, it may be applauded for making such a distinct
commitment against England (a power that many Diplomacy players
regard as France's greatest threat in the early years, and which
needs to be eliminated early if it is to be eliminated at all).
However, the opening will deprive France of two certain builds
in 1901 (Spain and Portugal) unless Marseilles is stood off by Germany,
and this will weaken France in 1902. Less severe is the Atlantic
Opening equivalent, the Belgian Gambit.
END
fra-northlimp|MANCHE OPENING, NORTHERN LIMP
Richard Sharp's name for the Manche opening that uses A Par-Pic and
A Mar H. While the Northern Dash with an arranged standoff in Burgundy is
the more common move, the limp is useful if Germany does not agree to the
standoff, but cannot be completely trusted not to enter Burgundy.  If he
refrains, Marseilles is in position to take Spain in Fall; if he <i>does</i>
enter Burgundy, the French home centers can be safeguarded while France
tries to engineer a build elsewhere.
END
fra-picardy|ATLANTIC OPENING, PICARDY VARIANT
This variant of the Atlantic Opening, known simply as the Picardy Opening,
preserves France's options in
Belgium without antagonizing any of his neighbours by entering the Channel
or Burgundy, and provides some flexibility in defending Brest, either
by tempting the English fleet with support into Belgium, defending
Brest with the Picardy army, or doing a self-standoff in Brest.
<P>
This is more offensive than the Burgundy Opening but more limited.
The order always succeeds. From Picardy, France can try for Belgium,
defend Paris if Germany gets into Burgundy, or defend Brest if
England slips into the Channel. This should only be tried when
France is certain of German friendship.
END
fra-piedmont|ATLANTIC OPENING, PIEDMONT SYSTEM
Any Atlantic Opening sending Marseilles to Piedmont.  A standoff in Piedmont
may be arranged, which can be of great value to France, as it permits him to
take Spain without having to guess the intentions of any Italian army.
The standoff also provides Italy with good camouflage if he intends
to make a grab for Trieste in Fall of 1901. Otherwise, entry into Piedmont
by France is more likely to be a back door attack on Germany than an
attack on Italy. (See the German Northern Tier Alliance Opening.) 
<P>
About the standard Piedmont System opening (A Par-Gas), the
<i>Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</a> says,
"this attack on Italy can sometimes yield stunning results. The
fall orders can include A Pie-Ven or Tus. The latter is actually
a little better because in 1902 the army threatens two Italian
centers. This sequence presumes a three-way Western alliance and
England/Germany are attacking Russia."
END

fra-vinmaginot|THE VINEYARD MAGINOT
This opening results in the same position going into Fall 1901 as
the Vineyard Opening (Mar-Bur, Par-Gas, Bre-MAO), as long as the
move to Burgundy is not bounced by Germany.  If the move is bounced,
however, this opening is considered more pro-Italy and anti-Germany
in that Marseilles, rather than Paris, is vacated.
END

fra-vineyard|ATLANTIC OPENING, THE VINEYARD
In the Vineyard Opening, France conducts himself with pro-English intentions,
but moves to enable an army to protect Brest against a Channel invasion.  If
England proves trustworthy, the Iberian centers can both be taken by armies
in Fall.
<P>
The idea is to arrange a stand-off with Germany in
Bur and then capture Spain from Marseilles and Portugal via convoy, leaving
France with F MAO and more options for 1902. This opening gained popularity
in the 1980's in British postal circles.
<P>
This opening is used in case the Germans try a stab. Perhaps Belgium can be
picked up, too. In either case, Marseilles is covered. This opening
can be used in alliance with England, where a strong push into
the Mediterranean is desired, and Germany is neutral.
END
fra-biscay|BISCAY OPENING
This opening is viewed as pro-English and pro-Italian in that France moves
to take Iberia without worrying either of those powers with the possibility,
however slight, that he might forego one of the centers there to apply naval
pressure in the Fall.
END

fra-sealion|[SEALION]
Edi Birsan's strong continuation of the English Attack opening,
as detailed in his <A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/S1997M/Birsan/Sealion.html
TARGET=_top>Diplomatic Pouch Article</A>.
<P>
Supported by the French fleet in the English Channel, Germany forces his way
into the North Sea in Fall of 1901, while France takes Belgium and Portugal
with his armies.  In Spring of 1902, Germany and France both attempt convoys
onto England, and at least one is guaranteed to succeed.  Named after Hitler's
plan to attack England from out of the Low Countries, this opening gained
rapid popularity in the late 1990's in e-mail play.
One example is Bif Smithson's Diplomatic Pouch article <A

fra-entente|[ENTENTE CORDIAL]
Stephen Agar's Anglo-French follow up to the Belgian opening.  He describes
the opening in <a target=_parent href=http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/articles/entente.htm>an

END

fra-wmandmary|[WILLIAM AND MARY OPENING]
Maarten Oosten's alternative to the Sealion is detailed
in his Diplomatic Pouch article, "<A
HREF=http://devel.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/F1997M/Oosten/WmandMary.html
TARGET=_top>The William and Mary Opening</A>:"
<P>
"Given a friendly Russia and a hostile Italy, Germany opens seemingly
anti-French, while France rushes south. By 1902, France and Germany
join their navies to acquire the English Channel and the North
Sea. Once F/G rule the waves, they have their way with England."
<P>
Germany moves his fleet into Belgium, while the French fleet
presumably bounces in the English Channel in the Spring and 
goes to the Mid-Atlantic in the Fall. All this is maintains a peaceful
attitude towards England until the Winter builds - 2 fleets.
Criticism of this opening is that Germany, with 3 builds, might be too
strong, since France might have to defend Marseilles and only get 1.
END

fra-lisbon|[LISBON LEAPFROG]
Mark Berch's name for the Falltime continuation which sees the army in
Gascony convoyed to Portugal.  He provides a complete write-up in
