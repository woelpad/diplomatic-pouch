varDesc['eng-wales'] += 'is quite sure of '
varDesc['eng-wales'] += 'taking the Channel, a fact seen by its high success rate compared with other '
varDesc['eng-wales'] += 'Southern openings. Because England only commits to Wales with the surety of '
varDesc['eng-wales'] += 'a Channel entry, French cooperation is often assumed by the board, and the '
varDesc['eng-wales'] += 'most common target for the English army is Belgium. As a result, however, the '
varDesc['eng-wales'] += 'success rate for taking Brest with this opening is extraordinarily high, '

varDesc['eng-wales'] += '<P> '

varDesc['eng-wales'] += 'Brest. England may also allow her to slip back in the home center while '

varDesc['eng-magde'] += 'in isolating the German for a strong 1902 attack.  Russia avoids Sweden in Fall '
varDesc['eng-magde'] += 'of 1901 and instead sails to the Baltic.  Simultaneously, England takes the '
varDesc['eng-magde'] += 'vacated Denmark.  Norway can go to either England (the "Prince Louis '
varDesc['eng-magde'] += 'Madgeburg") or Russia (if Russia opens with a Northern System; this is the '
varDesc['eng-magde'] += '"Benckendorff Magdeburg").  The Prince Louis (F NWG-Nor in Fall 1901) has '

varDesc['eng-church'] += 'is a little more risky than the pure Northern Opening, as England cannot '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'guarantee securing a build in 1901, but it offers more flexibility, since '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'England can follow with a Bohas in the Fall, if desired, to exert pressure on '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'Sweden in Spring of 1902. The Churchill is usually seen a sign that England is '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'more interested in securing a presence in Scandinavia than in worrying about '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'the Franco-German relationship, and hence provides an early hint of a triple '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'alliance.  Because of this, the Fall destination of the English army is equally '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'likely to be Belgium as Norway. '
varDesc['eng-church'] += '<P> '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'The <i>Gamer\'s Guide to Diplomacy</i> calls this "England\'s best opening," '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'From Edinburgh rather than Yorkshire, the army can be convoyed by either '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'fleet. It thus has the choice of going to Norway or to the Continent. It can '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'also be convoyed to Norway by one fleet with support from the other. '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'This opening is viewed as primarily anti-Russian. It can also '
varDesc['eng-church'] += 'be anti-German. One powerful Fall move is A Edi-Nor, F NTH C '

varDesc['eng-yorkpud'] += 'do too well in that game. '
varDesc['eng-yorkpud'] += ' '
varDesc['eng-west'] = "WESTERN OPENING</b><dd>"
varDesc['eng-west'] += 'In this opening, England leaves Scandinavia for Russia and Germany to divide, '
varDesc['eng-west'] += 'and commits all forces to an advance into the Atlantic.  Followed in Fall by '
varDesc['eng-west'] += 'Cly-NAO and a convoy to Belgium with German support, the Englishman builds a '
varDesc['eng-west'] += 'fleet in Liverpool and overwhelms France with seapower.  The Western opening '
varDesc['eng-west'] += 'is extremely risky, and only undertaken with complete trust in the German, '
varDesc['eng-west'] += 'both for his support into Belgium and his restraint in taking the North Sea. '
varDesc['eng-west'] += 'If Russia is warned off Norway and commits three units to the south, the German '
varDesc['eng-west'] += 'can usually conquer all of Scandinavia, his reward for assisting the English. '
varDesc['eng-west'] += "By the time Germany consolidates Scandinavia, England's defenses against any "
varDesc['eng-west'] += 'temptation the German may be feeling should be firmed up. '

varDesc['eng-north'] += 'Although the offensive role of the English army is limited, this '
varDesc['eng-north'] += 'opening is the only move to guarantee England a build in 1901, since Yorkshire '

varDesc['eng-north'] += 'be important which England supports himself into Norway. If Russia orders '
varDesc['eng-north'] += 'A Mos-StP in Spring of 1901 and A StP-Nor in Fall of 1901 then to achieve '
