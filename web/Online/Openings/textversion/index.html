<!HR>
Welcome to the Library.  Here you will find a comprehensive list of all
the named Spring 1901 openings for the seven powers in Standard Diplomacy,
along with a description of each such opening.

<H3>About the Library</H3>
This library lists by country the orders which were given in Spring 1901 in
standard games on the various Diplomacy adjudicators during the period
1981-1985 (data for Russia is from 1986).  This is a result of a survey conducted by Daniel Loeb of several judges
around the world during this time.
<P>
This library was originally intended to appear in the first issue of <B>The Diplomatic Pouch</B> Zine, but
the task of converting the original text to hypertext proved too time-consuming for me, Manus Hand,
publisher of The Pouch, and the first issue of the magazine went to press without it.
<P>
I had progressed to nearly halfway through the conversion
of the library and was looking at postponing its publication yet again when
I found Mike Steele had already converted the document.  What appears here
is my own reformatting of Mike's reformatting of (and additions to) Danny's
original document.

<H3>Reading the Library</H3>
As mentioned above, the library is divided into seven separate sections, one for each of
the Great Powers.  At the head of each section is a table, each line of which gives Spring 1901
orders for that power's units, followed by the number of games in which this opening was used,
and then the name of the opening (often more than one name, since Diplomacy openings often
consist of more than one season of development).
<P>
The opening name(s) provided are described in more detail below the table.  You can get directly
to the description of the opening by clicking your mouse on the opening name.  The citations are taken from
<i>Diplomacy A-Z</i> (the bible of the electronic hobby), and from <i>The Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy</i>.

<!--
<H3>Updating the Library</H3>
The one thing which Danny's document contained and which Mike left out (and therefore
which is missing here) were the statistics on the success rates (solo wins, 2-way draws,
3-way draws, etc.) for each opening.  I anticipate adding this information back into this
article when time permits.
<P>
From this, you can conclude that this library will be a living document.  In my own
conversion process, I had undertaken to name the unnamed openings and provide such
other information as seemed proper.  You will find none of this in the document as
it now stands, but I intend to eventually merge my own aborted conversion with Mike's
excellent adaptation in order to update the library.
<P>
You, gentle reader, are exhorted to join in this process.  Name the unnamed openings.
Add a new opening or twelve to the library.  All you need to do is
<A HREF="mailto:manus@diplom.org">drop
me a line</A> and the addition will be made as soon as possible.
<p>
And now, with no further ado, here is the library.

Figures for total openings for each power were obtained from the Blast From the Past article,
"<A HREF="../../Zine/S1995R/Misc/Blast.html">How Many Openings Are There?</A>", found in the
Spring 1995 Retreat Issue of <B>The Diplomatic Pouch</B> Zine.
