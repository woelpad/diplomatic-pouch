How to Play Turkey</H2></CENTER>

<H3>Position </H3>

<P>Turkey is known as the &quot;Wicked Witch of the East&quot; and is often
compared to England, the other Wicked Witch. She occupies a corner of the
board, between two powers and near a third, much like England. She sits
on a virtual island, connected only at the ends, and adjacent to only one
other power.<BR>
<BR>
She can be a very tough nut to crack, a thorny opponent, or a powerful
ally. In 1901, Turkey is guaranteed one neutral center (Bulgaria), is in
range of three others (Rumania, Serbia, Greece), and can threaten <B>only
one</B> center of other power (Sevastopol). <BR>
<BR>
Turkey is in the path of expansion of all of her neighbors; that makes
it imperative that she form a strong alliance with one of them. If Turkey
can do that, she can usually roll quickly to 10 centers by mid-game. If
her ally is Russia, she can easily roll through the Balkans (but watch
out for an Austria-Italy naval retaliation). If her ally is Austria, Russia
is the easy target (and Russia-Italy is usually too disjointed to counterattack
effectively). If her ally is Italy, Austria is usually easy meat, especially
after promising Rumania to Russia in the name of peace.<BR>
<BR>
Turkey doesn't need more than one ally, but she won't survive without one.</P>

<H3>Openings </H3>

<P>A Con - Bul<BR>
Turkey would be compely foolish to pass up Bulgaria. It s a free supply
center and a first line of defense along the land bridge onto the peninsula.
Thus, A Con-Bul is the only meaningful opening move for this unit. It cannot
be prevented by any other power. <BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Standard Opening<BR>
</I></B>F Ank-Bla<BR>
A Smy- Con<BR>
<BR>
This is the standard opening. It doesn t signify a direct threat to anyone,
though it may worry Russia. The fleet may be bounced by the Russian F Sev.
In the Fall, the second army moves up to take Bulgaria after the first
one moves on, either to Rumania, Serbia, or Greece.<BR>
<BR>
<B>Good points:</B> doesn t antagonize anyone.<BR>
<B>Bad points:</B> doesn t concentrate units against anyone.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bear Hunting<BR>
</I></B>F Ank-Bla<BR>
A Smy-Arm<BR>
<BR>
This is an obvious attack against Russia. It brings all Turkish units to
bear on the Russian front. Either the fleet or the army may be bounced,
depending on the Russian F Sev move. Unless Russia brings all her spare
units to defend Sevastopol, it will fall sooner or later to this Turkish
attack. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Good points:</B> Sevastopol and sole ownership of the Black Sea is all
but guaranteed. <BR>
<B>Bad points:</B> Pisses off one neighbor really fast; if Russia does
well in the North, look out for white hordes next year.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Bear Hug<BR>
</I></B>F Ank-Con<BR>
A Smy Hold<BR>
<BR>
A deal has been struck with Russia and Turkey is looking to move into the
Mediterranean quickly. The bad news for Turkey is that everyone else (Austria,
Italy) will already be in position by the time she makes her naval power
known. If one of those countries is Turkey s ally, she will do well. <BR>
<BR>
<B>Good points:</B> peace with Russia means the back door is secure; makes
Turkey a player in the center board quickly. <BR>
<B>Bad points:</B> rather wimpy due to the fleet having to travel so far
and get in the way of the other units; threatens no S.C.s except Bulgaria.<BR>
<BR>
<B><I>Temporary Insanity<BR>
</I></B>Any other option, such as F Ank-Arm, A Smy-Syr is pointless except
for sheer comedic value or unless you re trying to convince everyone else
that you have <B>no</B> idea how to play Diplomacy. As an attack on Russia,
F Ank-Arm is too weak; F Ank-Bla, A Smy-Arm makes much more sense.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>The Mid-Game </H3>

<P>There are so many possible variations of position in the mid-game that
it is difficult to be concise. Having said that ...<BR>
<BR>
Without a successful alliance, Turkey is easily contained to her opening
turf. However, breaking Turkey is no trivial task. It requires the focussed
attacks of two of your neighbours and a lack of help from your third neighbour
before Turkey will start to crack (and even then it should take time).<BR>
<BR>
If Turkey finds herself trapped in this way, the main stategy is to make
your enemies work as hard as possible for every gain, hoping that the longer
it takes the more likely it is that a threat to your enemies will emerge
somewhere else. At the very least it will frustrate your enemies.<BR>
<BR>
If Turkey has opened successfully, the mid-game is very promising. A safe
back means that all your forces can be deployed where they are needed most,
on the front line.<BR>
<BR>
If allied with Austria or Italy you will be well positioned to stab successfully
(often with the help of another power looking for centers). A Turkey that
occupies most of Russia and has even a small naval presence in the South,
is set to steamroll what's left of your neighbours on the way to a possible
solo win.<BR>
<BR>
If allied with Russia (and assuming Russia has also been successful) your
options are a bit more limited for a stab. Depending on which power in
the West (if any) emerges as the major power, Turkey is set to punch through
the South trying to out race Russia for the magic 18 centers. </P>
