Cooking with Greece</H2></CENTER>

<P>Diplomacy is a game of intrigue and suspense, much as a good mystery
or spy novel is. The only difference
is that you are an active participant in this "novel", rather than a
passive observer. You can try to go
where you want to go, rather than having to follow the lead of the author.
<p>
As in any situation, in order to achieve your goals over those of
an opponent, you must have some edge so
that your plans receive a higher priority. In Diplomacy, this is usually
done from a position of strength,
however, there are certain location on the playing map that can give this
advantage to the player without that
overwhelming power.
<p>
Greece is one of these important locations, being the most
important province in the eastern half of the board.
Only Belgium can begin to rival it for importance on the whole board.
While Greece is a supply center, it is
important not only for its own sake, but also because of the tactical
advantages that it gives to its occupier.
This advantage is in the form of supports. Greece is located in such a
central location that it controls both the
land and sea routes between east and west. In order to advance on way or
the other, either you, or an
ally6who is willing to give support, must control Greece.
<p>
Greece is very important to each of the three countries that surround it,
but holds the greatest importance for
Turkey. With its corner position, Turkey has an excellent defensive
position, but along with this advantage
comes the difficulty of trying to break out and make its own attack.
There is only a limited potential for
advancement in the north, therefore if Turkey is going to have a chance
at winning, it must make an attack to
the west. If an army can be maneuvered into Greece, Turkey will have a
unit in position which will be able to
give support into the heart of the Balkans. If a fleet can be
positioned into Greece, Turkey then has the option
of attacking Italy by sea, rather than having to go through Austria and
attacking by land, a difficult
achievement regardless. The major disadvantage is that they are basically
mutually exclusive. Without
cooperation from, or at least neutrality by the other, Turkey can not
force both the Balkans and the Ionian Sea
since a fleet is required for one action, and a fleet for the other.
<p>
Any attack that Austria intends to make against Turkey must
include Greece. Greece is the pivot point upon
which any type of invasion must hinge. One special advantage that Austria
holds over Turkey is that a fleet in
Greece is infinitely more useful than an army. Whereas Turkey must use a
fleet for a seaborne attack and an
army for a land attack, an Austrian fleet can support both a land attack
into Bulgaria and a sea attack into the
Aegean Sea. With such an advantage, it is surprising that Turkey so often
does not contest Greece, rather
allowing Austria to move its first fleet in unopposed. However, if
Austria is forced onto the defensive, then
the fleet may become a burden. All supply centers are land based, and the
fleet can not support any armies
which are trying to hold in Serbia. Denying Greece to Turkey, though,
still slows down any advance it might
make.
<p>
Greece holds the least importance for Italy among these three powers, but
it also holds the most potential.
While both Austria and Turkey have special needs and gain certain
advantages by controlling Greece, ItalyUs
control of Greece can only lead to positive results. A fleet is able to
support a second fleet into the Aegean
Sea as well as an Austrian army into Bulgaria. An army can also support
an Austrian army into Bulgaria as
well as a Turkish army into Serbia. Not only does Italy have every
advantage that both Austria and Turkey
do, but it also gains the advantage of outflanking Austria by convoying
an army into Greece. Italy can attack
Austria from both sides at once beginning in 1902. A second additional
advantage Italy holds is that once the
first enemy is disposed of, the unit in Greece is still in a great
position to give supports against the former
ally. A third advantage is that if everything fails, Italy is usually
able to back out and try another tact without
much risk.
<p>
Even when Russia is taken into consideration, Greece still does not
lose its importance. If a united front is
being thrown at Russia, Greece can serve to support front line units
against the onslaught. If one power is
allied with Russia vs. the others, the importance of Greece intensifies
as gains must be made to prevent
Russia from overrunning the enemy and gaining all of his supply centers,
or else to prevent yourself from
being overrun quickly.
<p>
Frequently, the fight over Greece determines who will be the
dominant power in the eastern portions of the
board. It can serve as both a hinge in any attack by any power in any
direction, or as the lynch pin in a static
defense against overwhelming odds. With its central location in the
eastern Med., it can not be ignored. The
major goal of any players should be to quickly establish ownership, and if
that is not possible to either deny it
to anybody else, or make them defend Greece with everything they have.
