<H3>Der Fatherland </H3>
<P>
After Italy, I suspect Germany is the least popular choice when
players select a power to play. In 1995 I played Germany in five
games (twice by choice). One was a total victory. Four were loses
(though only one elimination). You have been warned!<BR>
<BR>
Germany is unique in that she borders five other powers. All players
except Turkey are within striking distance of Germany in the first
year. A poorly played Germany is very quickly eliminated. A well
played Germany can win but it takes time.<BR>
<BR>
Like Austria, Germany's key problem is exposure. Any expansion
requires a poorly defended rear, and loving allies can quickly
prove to be Germany's nemesis. </P>
<H3>Openings </H3>
<P>
<I>Bilizkreig<BR>
</I>F Kie - Den<BR>
A Ber - Kie<BR>
A Mun - Ruh<BR>
<BR>
This move sets Germany up for quick expansion. Denmark, Belgium
and Holland are all possible in the first year. England and France
also have an interest in Belgium. It may be in your interests
to let one of them have it in order to cement an alliance.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Get France<BR>
</I>F Kie - Hol<BR>
A Mun - Bur<BR>
A Ber - Kie<BR>
<BR>
This puts a lot of pressure on France. Denmark is a sure bet for
the army in Kie and Holland already taken and may be used to support
or bounce England/France in Belgium. If Germany makes Burgundy,
French expansion slows dramatically as Paris and Marseille are
defended.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Barbarossa<BR>
</I>F Kie - Den<BR>
A Mun - Sil<BR>
A Ber - Pru<BR>
<BR>
Going for Russia in the first year requires foolhardy courage.
It's very bad news for Russia as it is so unexpected. The problem
is that even if you can convince England and France to leave your
back (and Holland) alone, Germany will be so exposed in 1902 that
England and/or France will find Germany an irresistable target.
<BR>
</P>
<H3>Alliances </H3>
<P>
Germany must deal with every power except Turkey (but what the
hell drop them a note anyway).<BR>
<BR>
<I>Russia</I> rarely makes Germany her first target. The Russians
will be aiming to get Sweden in the fall of 1901. Germany can
prevent this by ordering F Kie - Den in the spring and then F
Den - Swe in the fall. Russia is significantly weakened if she
doesn't gain Sweden in the first year. You must be very aware
of this when dealing with England, Russia, Austria and Turkey.
I nearly always move to Den in the spring just so I have the option
of bouncing Russia if necessary. If the English appear to be a
threat you will need the support of Russia to hold the North.
<BR>
<BR>
<I>England and France</I> will be thinking of Germany as a potential
ally or target in the early years. Remember, everyone thinks Germany
is a target at some point. If England and France team up against
Germany the best you can hope for is a holding position until
they get a) bored and attack each other or b) they come under
pressure from a power expanding at their flank. Just to hold the
line, you will need Russia's assistance in the North. Your best
bet is to ensure that France or England is Germany's ally.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Austria</I> is Germany's historical cousin. War between you
is of little benefit to either. An alliance offers many benefits,
most important is the fact that you can defend each others backs.
If you don't make it obvious, you may find the information exchange
between you and (mis-information) between the other powers most
valuable.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Italy</I> is a critical element of your relationship with Austria.
Italy and Austria are always wary of each other because Trieste
and Venice being next door to each other. Italy may need to be
pressured to ensure peace between the two. Personally I think
this is a last resort. Nobody likes to be threatened, so I don't
say anything nasty to Italy unless it is absolutely necessary
to keep Italy from attacking Austria. If England is hostile, Italy
is a very useful ally who can pressure France's Southern front.
<BR>
</P>
<H3>The Mid-Game </H3>
<P>
Lets assume that the Eastern front is not a concern for Germany.
Russia, Turkey and Austria (and probably Italy) at are each others
throats.<BR>
<BR>
If thats the case, Germany can focus on eliminating one of the
Western powers. I think England is a greater threat to Germany
than France. Therefore I'm inclined to attack England in 02-03.
The key to England is the North Sea. The English are very aware
of this so taking the North Sea will require stealth (possibly
a stab) and/or French assistance.<BR>
<BR>
The rewards for France and Germany are significant. Apart from
the four centers England probably holds at this stage, the strategic
benefit is having a safe back. France and Germany can set up a
safe zone between them that allows both powers to focus on the
East.<BR>
<BR>
It is also worth remembering that powers that are not at war with
you are useful. Basically your enemies enemy is your friend. 
<BR>
<BR>
In the mid-game this may mean supporting or bypassing a weak power
(Austria or Russia) to keep the larger power under control. You
can always eliminate the small power later. Of course your opponents
and allies may have exactly the same idea ;-)<BR>
<BR>
More than most, Germany must be sensitive to the balance of power.
Keep talking. You never know when you may need a friend!<BR>
<BR>
Good Luck<BR>
