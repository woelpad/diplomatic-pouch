How to Play Austria</H2></CENTER>

<B>The Habsburg Empire</B>

<P>When you draw Austria in a game your first thought should be: "How can
I survive the first two or three years of this game?" Sometimes Austria
doesn't last two or three turns let alone two or three years, so simple
survival should be the first order of business.

<P>For obvious reasons, Austria is the easiest country to eliminate. She
is surrounded at the start of the game, and sitting atop the area of the
board with the densest concentration of supply centers, the Balkans. Russia
and Turkey both covet this region, and most Italian players will make the
mistake of stabbing you to get a piece of the action when you start to
falter. So the Austrian position is a precarious one. You are going to
be at the center of the action from the start of the game, and you are
going to have to play your tail off to make something happen for your country.
Austria, as much as any country on the board, requires a great deal of
hard work. It takes a GOOD player to win with Austria. It is going to take
a tremedous diplomatic effort. Position and tactics mean less with Austria
than with most countries. Everything hinges on whether or not you can make
the right friends at the right moment.

<P>If you slip up, even a little bit--kiss your butt goodbye because some
hotshot Turkey or Russian is going to gobble you up.

<P>Having said all that, understand that if you can orchestrate a victory
or two, your chances of winning the game zoom way up. As mentioned, Austria
is sitting right on top of the Balkans, a powerful base to draw upon for
a mid-game victory drive.

<P><B>The archduke's neighbors</B><B></B>

<P><B>Germany</B>

<P>Germany is rarely discussed when talking about Austria, which I think
is a big mistake. 99 percent of the diplomacy players realize that Germany
and Austria shouldn't be fighting each other. But that really isn't going
far enough. Asutria and Germany need to work together for their mutal benefit.
Simply staying out of each other's hair isn't enough--you might accidentally
screw each up. So your first order of affairs is to get on good terms with
the German. He won't be thinking of attacking you--but he might not be
thinking of you at all, which isn't much better.

<P>Okay, so now you've got Germany seeing the light...he should keep you
abreast of any pertinent information, and anything that threatens you is
a blow to him. Usually, this means encouraging him to open with fleet Kiel
to Denmark. You want Kiel to move to Den in order to bounce Russia out
of Sweden if need be. I have always been able to convince Germany of how
vital I am to his survival. And don't forget--he is vital to you, although
less so--just don't let the Russian get any ground in Germany. This shouldn't
be a problem since you are convincing the Russian to go along with you
in an attack on the Sultan

<P><B>Russia</B>

<P>Now we come to the key for Austria. In the east, Russia-Austria-Turkey
form a tense triangle. You need to get one of them on your side against
the other. Getting Russia on your side against Turkey should be a little
easier than getting Turkey to come to your side against Russia. Dividing
up the Balkans and Turkey with Russia is a real headache, but things rearely
get that far before open war breaks out between you two. If you can, negotiate
hard for Bulgaria. Offer Russia all of Turkey in exchange for Bulgaria--Because
if you get it, you'll be able to really stab the Russian in Rumania and
then shoot for Sevastopol. But timing is important--if you stab russia
too soon, he and a still breathing Turkey will wipe you out. If you stab
too late, he might have the units built to fend you off.

<P>Offer Russia things like a de-militarized Turkey once the alliance is
over. Make all your offers aound believable--but keep in mind the real
object: Russia is to be the rock with which you bludgeon Turkey. Don't
get tripped up by how well things may go. You will have gained little by
actually splitting up the south with Russia--what is to be gained is a
weak and ineffective Turkey and a greatly committed Russia overextending
himself to get at the straits.

<P>I think Russia is the best chance Austria has to take out the Turk (we'll
get to Italy later) and really explode. An alliance with Russia will give
you a great deal of Security and will allow you to control the Balkans
better than a pact with the Turk will.

<P><B>Turkey</B>

<P>Everything said about Russia also applies in many ways to Turkey. Your
principle motive for allince here is to give yourself some security and
to beat Russia senseless while waiting for the opportunity to back-stab
your partner.

<P>As I said, I think it is harder to swing this alliance. So many people
assume (rightly, in general) that Austria and Turkey are mortal enemies
that getting together is hard to do. But it can be done, and is done all
the time. But like Russia, your alliance here is a short-term one. Always
be looking for the right moment, when you can safely and effectively knock
out the Turk. Usually, this will be when the Turk has captured Sevastopol
(hopefully during a spring turn). This is a good time to stab him. By taking
a center from him now you deny him the Sev. build, Russia will fight to
take it back, further weakining him, and the unit is far from home (unless
he convoyed an army there). As a benchmark, look for his capture of Sevastopol
to be the signal to switch sides and hit him.

<P>Your Turkish alliance will again, be hard to divide in terms of centers.
You both will want to have Greece, for instance. I would not advise giving
Greece to Turkey. Saying you will give it to him--that's another story.
Better to offer him Rumania and Sevastopol.

<P>Keep your eye on what Turkey builds--encourage him to build fleets and
power out into the Med after Italy. You will head North, you assure him,
once you two have knocked out Russia and given St. Pete to some friendly
western power. Whaterver tactic you use--the goal is to get Turkish units
into the water, where they are no threat to you and of no use to the Turk
in defending himself from you. (with regards to Russia as well--although,
if you can get the russian to build up a bunch of navies in the south he
or she is probably your little brother or your mom and in that case you
should roll no matter what you do.)

<P><B>Russia&amp;Turkey</B>

<P>It's clear what you have to do with these two. Some people concentrate
on getting Russia and Turkey to go to war with each other. This is fine,
but you won't be able to do it without getting involved in the fight yourself.
If you simply try to instigate a war with them you will be found out and
shown to be kind of weak. Choose one to ally with against the other--then
it's a matter of timing--when do you stab your ally? Do it when the original
foe is weak, of course and when it looks as though another power might
be able to help you (England against Russia for example, or Italy agaisnt
Turkey). But be ready to do it.

<P>As stated at the start, Austria must first concern herself with survival.
So don't just throw in with Russia or Turkey and hope for the best. They
will be trying to ally and attack you in many cases. Analyze their mailings
to you carefully, and don't be afraid to be a little bristly at first--if
they think you will be a pushover they might try pushing you. Remind them
of your friendship with the German, and his promises to come to your aid
(especailly agaisnt Russia). Hopefully this will be more than just a threat--and
Germany will confirm your alliance. Remind Turkey that Italy has been wanting
to try out Lepanto for some time--an attack on you will only bring green
fleets sailing into the Eastern Med. and so forth.

<P>Now here is the trick. If you do all of this won't you encourage Turkey
and Russia to ally? Possibly, if you aren't doing much talking with the
two of them. But if you use these threats and hints of threats with lots
of serious talk about alliance and how there really is no future in an
alliance with the Turk/Russian, human nature being what it is, many will
throw in with you rather than risk a bloody nose.

<P>There are a whole series of openings that seek to present as tough a
posture as possible for Austria, called, appropriately, "Hedgehog" openings.
The most important part of any Hedgehog is to diplome in a similar manner.
It's pointless to start a game with some bristly tactical opening when
the same could have been accomplished through diplomacy. So don't be afraid
to be thin-skinned early on as Austria. You are, after all, rather thin-skinned
in terms of defense early on.

<P><B>Italy</B>

<P>You must offer Italy a neutrality pact. I'm not even going to go into
attacks of Italy because I think they are as foolish as attacks on Germany.
If you turn your back on turkey and russia you will get crushed. Pulling
it off would require utterly incompetent Russia and Turkish players (see
also Mom and little brother billy play Russia and Turkey)

<P>But keeping Italy from attacking YOU is harder. You must show him that
to attack you is folly. You have one secret weapon in this debate: You
are right. Italian openings against Austria invariably end up with Turkey
and Russia rolling all over everyone, including Italy. Make sure that Italy
realizes you are the only thing between him and total destruction at the
hands of Turkey and Russia. Having accomplished this, try to get him to
outright attack Turkey in a Lepanto. If the R-T alliance forms, he will
need to do this for sheer self defense. If not, sell him on the riches
of Turkey--when he finally gets there you will be strong enough to muscule
him out of there. But be careful that the Italian doesn't link up with
Russia after Turkey is reduced. This is the greatest danger to you in going
to bed with the Italian. So make sure Russia and Italy don't communicate
too much.

<P>My preferred Austrian strategy is to get everyone going after the Turk.
Then I can stab the Russian without really saving Turkey, and then conquer
my grateful Turkish friend, denying italy his hard-fought gains.

<P><B>Openings</B><B></B>

<P><B>Anti-German openings</B>

<P>What, are you nuts?

<P><B>Anti-Italian openings</B>

<P>see "Anti-German openings."

<P>I think your only real choice is to open up against Turkey or Russia.
But with Austria, who gets eliminated so fast so often, the opening must
be considered carefully. Most of us try to open as flexibly as possible
and with real chances to greb acouple of centers. Fine. but before we do
that, let's look at an opening that puts saftey ahead of treasure, shich
might be the secret to Austria.

<P>F Tri-Ven<br>
 A Vie-Gal<br>
 A Bud-Ser

<P>This is called the "Double-Hedgehog" or something like that. Don't worry
about what it's called. IT does one thing very well--It protects you from
a Russian move into Galicia and an Italian Tyrolian attack while at the
same time securing Serbia. The down side to this is that it leaves Greese
at risk to the Turk, and will often royally piss off the Italian, especially
if the move is a surprise. Which, if you like, it doesn;t have to be. What
will the Italian say when you inform him that you will be going to Venice?
What will happen when you tell Russia you are going to Galicia? Explore
these options. A friend of mine is particularly fond of these arrarnged
double-bounces as a way of gaining security and fostering confusion.

<P>If you want a totally safe opeing that still gives you a shot at a build
in 1901, this is it.

<P><B>Let's go for Greece</B>

<P>Going after Greece is probalbly the most popular Austrian opening--you
can get Greece just by going to Albania with your fleet then supporting
yourself in from Serbia. But you leave yourself open to Italy. It's a gamble,
and you can go to trieste from Vienna to protect yourself. But you might
as well go to Tyrolia--that 's where the Italan will go if he is coming
after you. MAybe you can get Germany to bounce you in Tyrolia--that is
better yet because you will stay in vienna--incase the russian attacks
you.

<P>Maybe you should go to galicia with Vienna. that will protect you from
the russian. I like this opening:

<P>A Vie-Gal<br>
 A Bud-Ser<br>
 F Tri-Alb

<P>If you want to gamble on getting Greece and Serbia and take your chances
with italy than this is a good opening. Maybe you can arrange a bounce
in Gal or Tyrolia or something.

<P>If you go after Greece you will have to leave yourself open to the Russian
or the Italian. You might be able to guard against one or the other but
not both.<B></B>

<P><B>The anti-Russian</B><B></B>

<P>To me, the essential anti-russian opening is when Bud supports Vienna
into Galicia. Obviously, you not paying any care to what Turkey is doing
and you just want to throw everything at the Russian.

<P><B>The anti-Turkish</B>

<P>I think going all-out for Greece is basically anti-Turkish, but this
isn't really true in many cases. Other overtly anti-turkish moves would
include something moving into Bulgaria in the fall, which might involve
Russian support from Rumania. Going agaisnt Turkey without help from anyone
is hard to do, tactically, because, like I said, the most anti-turksih
thing you can really do is go after Serbia and Greece which everyone accepts
that you will generally do anyway. Use this to your advantage. Believe
it or not, it is possible to sneak up on the turk, simply because your
moves agaisnt him are so obvious that they seem rather harmless in a strange
way. Going after greece is what Austrain is SUPPOSED to do, after all.

<P><B>Rumania??</B>

<P>Anyone ever thought of opening to Rumania? I suppose not. After all,
if Turkey sees you do this he's only going to help russia back into it
while taking greece in the process.

<P>Okay, so if you get Austria, and you aren't confident enough to try
the double-hedgehog-attack-everyone-and-cover-your-ass-later opening, then
you should try for greece. Use the army in Vienna to bounce a Russia n
or Italian attack if you think it might come.

<P><B>The "I'm friendly" opening</B>

<P>For a lot of powers, a neutral opening is the way to go. Why make everyone
hate you right off hte bat? With Big Red, this usually means not moving
Vienna, or Trieste. And it is bad news. Don't even think you're going to
be able to pussy-foot around in the Balkans and live to see the end of
the game. Gamble for Greece in your opening or try the tough opening that
is designed to keep you alive at all costs. Austrai can't take the high
road. She has to get down and dirty and start stabbing and slashing, fighting
out of the surrounded condition she finds herself in.

<P><B>Sea Power</B>

<P>A must if you want to win easily. It is also a luxury only the true
diplomacy all-stars can arrange. The rest of us struggle just to grow and
hang on, building armies like mad. At some point, do your best to slip
in another fleet . It might make the difference in a close game. You will
need it to really get at Italy in most cases, and it might help against
Turkey as well.

<P>It's hard for Austria to build fleets--they are awkward and stick out
like a sore thumb, let's face it. But if you can manage--do it. Don't hink
you can win simply by building a large army. If you have a crack, slip
through it and build a fleet or two.

<P><B>The Mid-Game</B>

<P>Having avoided an early exit at the hands of your close neighbors, you
find yourself prospering---Keep an eye on the West. It is to your gain
to maintain the balance of power over there. Austria can get to double-digits
in centers quickly--but you can also get stuck on the right side of the
stalemate line, loaded down with armies and with no hope of breaking through
for the win. It is important than, to keep Germany, France and England
somewhat balanced--so they will have a hard time allying against you. England
is the key here. If England is gone--Germany and France will have no trouble
blocking your growth. But if England is still around, they will not beable
to totally come your way.

<P>Keeping England viable is an intregal part of Austria's game-winning
strategy in this case. But whatever happens, keeping the west in turmoil
is your goal. So keep an ear to the ground and leak secrets that help western
underdogs. Your friendship with Germany notwithstanding.
