How to Play England</H2></CENTER>

<H3>
by Chris Allen</H3></CENTER>
<P>The traditional strength of England has been the fact that it is an
island. As has been demonstrated throughout history, naval power is the
key to England's security.<BR>
<BR>
Although England must concentrate on building fleets, it is difficult (if
not impossible) for England to win without getting armies into the continent.
Her usual routes are through the low countries into France or Germany,
or though Scandanavia into Russia.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Openings </H3>

<P><I>The Churchill<BR>
</I>F Edi - Nwg<BR>
F Lon - Nth<BR>
A Lvp - Edi<BR>
<BR>
This move sets England up for war against Germany or Russia. This threatens
Norway in the fall and also allows for co-operation with France to get
an army into Belgium.<BR>
<BR>
<I>Get France<BR>

A Lvp - Wal (alternatively A Lvp - Yor)<BR>
F Edi - Nth<BR>
<BR>
If England makes the channel (not a sure bet), Brest is exposed (always
a pleasant situation;) and France is faced with the dilema of defending
Brest or the Mid-Atlantic. England is still likely to make Norway.<BR>
<BR>

<H3>Alliances </H3>

<P>Like all the other powers, England can't survive without friends. Whatever
happens you are going to have enemies!<BR>
<BR>
The three powers England must deal with initially are France, Germany and
Russia. <BR>
<BR>
Russia is generally rather occupied being paranoid about the Turks and
Austrians (occasionally the Germans as well). So be nice, but encourage
Russia to concentrate on the East.<BR>
<BR>
Germany and France are thinking about England! It's not impossible for
these three powers to ally, just unusual. More often than not, somebody
gets left out of this trio. Your number one task is to make sure it isn't
England. Promise whatever it takes to get France or Germany allied with
England.<BR>
<BR>
Regardless of who you ally with, your number two priority is to ensure
no French fleet appears in the English channel. Get firm promises, or arrange
to bounce in the spring so neither of you are threatened.<BR>
<BR>
