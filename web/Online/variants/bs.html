    <i>BackStab! -- The American Revolution</i> is a card game for two to
    five players.  Players rely on strategy, tactics, and negotiation skills
    to amass forces, gain control of resources, and acquire territory.  This
    initial section of the rules provides a high-level introduction to the
    game.
<p>
    <i>The American Revolution</i> is one game in the family of
    <i>BackStab!</i> games.  All <i>BackStab!</i> games will have a similar
    "look and feel," and therefore learning rules for other games in the family
    will be made easier as a consequence of familiarity with this game.
    However, every game will differ in various respects:  each will have
    different types of cards, somewhat different rules, different mechanics,
    and different strategies, making every game in the family unique.

<dd>
    Players begin the game by each taking ownership of five separate locations
    in colonial North America (each location is represented by a separate
    card).  Each location produces some type of resource (materiel, industry,
    or food), and each resource is instrumental in the ability to build and
    maintain armies, navies, and forts.  The players hope to add to their
    collection of owned locations in order to win the game, since victory is
    achieved by acquiring more locations (above a certain minimum number) than
    any other player.
<P>
    In the process of establishing each player's five initial owned locations,
    the players also take actions that modify the makeup of the "disputed
    territories."  The disputed territories are are a subset of the remaining
    (unowned) locations on the map.  Only those locations that are either owned
    locations or that are exposed at the top of one of ten disputed territory
    <i>piles</i> are actually "in-play;" no other location may be attacked
    (that is, moved into) by any player's forces.
<P>
    Map cards form one of the three decks in the game.  The other two decks are
    the <i>force</i> deck, which contains the different types of offensive and
    defensive forces, and the <i>order</i> deck, which contains cards that are
    used to control one's forces or to otherwise affect the course of a turn.
<P>
    After the disputed territories and each player's initial owned locations
    are set up, the players begin the first turn of the game.  In each turn,
    a total of nine ordered actions are taken.  These are briefly described
    below.
    <p>
<ol>
    <li><b>Discard/Draw Forces</b>
        <br>Players draw cards from the <i>force deck</i>, giving them new
        armies, navies, and forts that they may choose to build.  The force
        deck also provides reinforcement cards that can strengthen the action
        of any existing army, navy, or fort, and BackStab! cards, which allow
        a player to take control of and issue an order to another player's
        army or navy.
    <li><b>Build Forces</b>
        <br>Players lay cards face-down onto their own locations, and later
            reveal them.  New armies, navies, and forts are built this way, but
            players may also choose to lay other cards, either to deceive an
            opponent as to their true build intentions or simply to get rid
            of unwanted cards.
    <li><b>Remove Forces</b>
        <br>Players will need to remove some number of their armies, navies,
            or forts if they cannot sustain them all with the food produced by
            their owned locations.
    <li><b>Discard/Draw Orders</b>
        <br>Players fill their hand to ten cards by drawing from the <i>order
            deck</i>.  This deck provides the player with command cards (to
            allow orders to be issued to an army or navy), and with cards that
            can strengthen his own defense or weaken the defense or resolve of
            his opponent.
    <li><b>Create Cardsets</b>
        <br>Players lay cards from their hand, face-down, onto any location
            (not necessarily their own locations).  Through this, command cards
            and other cards become associated with an army, navy, or fort, or
            with an unoccupied location.  By the time all players consecutively
            pass their opportunity to play a card, any number of cards may have
            been played onto any specific location.
    <li><b>Resolve Attacks</b>
        <br>Players alternate turns choosing any set of face-down cards and
            calling for the set to be exposed.  Before exposing the cards,
            the owner of any army or navy that occupies the chosen location
            must commit the force to a specific order (defend, attack, or
            support).  The cards are then exposed and the strength of the
            order is calculated from them, as is the strength of the defense of
            the location itself.  At this time, a player may play a BackStab!
            card from his hand to take control of a force and issue it a new
            order.  When all cardsets have been exposed, the success or failure
            of each attack order is known and resolved.  Players who
            successfully attack a territory get control of that territory; it
            becomes one of their "owned locations."
    <li><b>Check Victory Conditions</b>
        <br>After attack resolution, if any player has enough owned locations
            to claim victory, the game is over.
    <li><b>Modify Disputed Territories</b>
        <br>In this phase of the turn, each player gets one opportunity to
            modify the disputed territory piles, either to create a new pile or
            to cover the card atop an existing pile, exposing a new card in the
            process.
    <li><b>Replace Revolted Locations</b>
        <br>During attack resolution, some players may have suffered the
            unfortunate fate of having one or more of their locations "revolt."
            All locations that suffered revolts that were not suppressed during
            attack resolution are placed back into the disputed territories at
            the conclusion of the turn, and the game continues with the
            "Discard/Draw Forces" step of the next turn.
</ol>
<P>
    In the performance of these nine actions, players have many opportunities
    to negotiate for cooperative action, to openly work against each other, and
    to deceive each other as to their true intentions, influencing other
    players to commit cards they may have preferred to hold for other purposes.
    While players may cooperate, keep in mind that lying is not cheating,
    and what one says or promises to another player is not always what one
    does.  <i>BackStab!</i> is, after all, a game of conquest and every
    player has winning as a primary objective.

<dd>The figure below shows the arrangement of cards for a two-player game
    in-progress.  The player seated at the top owns six locations; the other
    player owns seven.  The ten disputed territory piles are positioned in the
    center of the table, between the players.  The draw and discard piles for
    the force and order decks can be seen on the left.
