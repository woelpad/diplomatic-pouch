<P>

The Anarchy variant is of uncertain origin.  It represents a way to
compensate for the geographical weaknesses of some of the countries, and
to provide some variety for those gamers who are tired of the standard
setup.</p>
This variant uses the standard map and all standard rules except for the
initial distribution of supply centers and units, and where new units
can be built.  Typically, there are seven players, but that number can
vary.  Instead of the powers being England, France, Germany, Russia,
Austria-Hungary, Turkey, and Italy, each player has some choice over
which supply centers they start out with.  Prior to the S1901 turn, each
player writes a numbered preference list of supply centers.  One
optional rule allows communication between powers before the submission
of preference lists in order to minimize "overlaps".  The centers in a
list may be grouped together tightly (i.e. Scandinavia), loosely (i.e.
the Danelaw), or not at all. 

<p>These lists are then adjudicated.  Since
this variant is not yet supported by the judges, the lists will have to
be hand-adjudicated in a logical way, with unique first choices being
awarded and ties being resolved fairly.  Once each player recieves three
supply centers, F1900 adjustments are submitted - thus each player gets
to decide the initial makeup of his or her military forces.  Since it is
entirely possible for one or more players to start out landlocked,
either through choice or through not getting any of the coastal supply
centers on their preference list(s), units may be built in any
controlled and unoccupied supply center.  S1901 and all subsequent moves
proceed normally.  Victory conditions remain 18 centers.  Note that
since this is a rules variant, it can be applied to any other Diplomacy
map, in which case the number of starting powers and centers per power
may vary.</p>
In the abscence of a known creator, this variant is dedicated to Steve
Mooney, who not only taught standard Diplomacy and this variant to the
author, but humbled him several times in each.
