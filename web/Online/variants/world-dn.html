<P>
One of the subjects that seems to come up repeatedly on
rec.games.diplomacy, is whether there is a world variant
available on the judges. There wasn't, so I decided to put
one together. This is the result.
<P>
In addition to the adjacencies displayed on the map, the
following are also adjacent :
<P>
MBL - RIS, MBL - SPO, SEP - SPO, EPA - SPO, EPA - PIS, NEP
- PIS, NEP - CPO, NPO - CPO, NPO - NWP, NPO - BRS, Ala -
BRS, Ala - AOC, BFS - AOC, BAR - AOC.
<P>
In general, this means that it is possible to go from one
side of the map to the other, and from any Northern edge
province - AOC. This is due to the fact that the map should
be drawn on a globe, with SOP and AOC at the two poles.
<P>
I do not expect this first attempt to be too playable. It
will almost certainly not be balenced, and will need some
serious fiddling with. Experience from watching previous
variant developments tell me that if this is going to be a
good variant then it will probably go through at least half
a dozen iterations before it is finalised.
<P>
The variant is loosely based on the world as we know it.
The shape of the land is the same, as are the countries.
However, there is no intent to provide historical accuracy,
so please don't ask questions like why particular provinces
are supply centres when others aren't. The aim is
playability, not accuracy.
