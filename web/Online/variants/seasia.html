<b>Overview</b>
<p>

This variant introduces a new map but maintains the standard Diplomacy 
rules owned by Hasbro.  It straddles the equator, spanning the 
area from Burma in the west to Papua New Guinea in the east, and from 
Taiwan in the north to northern Australia in the south.
<p>
The intention of the variant is for seven closely-matched powers to 
contest 11 neutral supply centres, very similar in game play to the 
original European game.
<p>
The fictitious historical basis for the variant is that economic and 
political instability broke out in China and South-east Asia in 1997.  
Pro-democracy movements have caused unrest in territories such as East 
Timor and Hong Kong.  China split into several factions, with the 
southern portion seeking allies among the members of Asean for its 
expansionist ambitions.
<p>
<b>Setup</b>
<p>
The seven powers are:
<p>
Australia, China, Indonesia, Malaysia, The Philippines, Thailand and
Vietnam.
<p>
Neutral supply centres are:
<p>
Singapore, Brunei, Burma, Laos, Cambodia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, the Spratly 
Islands, the Marianas islands, Papua New Guinea and East Timor.
<p>
All Powers start with three supply centres except Indonesia, who has 
four.  The game is more fleet-centred than Europe, except on the 
continent around Laos etc.  Vietnam, China and Thailand all start with 
one fleet, the others start with two.
<p>
<b>Starting Positions</b>
<p>
Austria: Army Darwin, Fleet Cairns, Fleet Port Hedland<br>
China: Army Guiyang, Army Kunming, Fleet Guangzhou<br>
Indonesia: Army  Balikpapan, Army  Jakarta, Fleet Medan, Fleet Surabaya<br>
Malaysia: Army  Kuala Lumpur, Fleet Kota Bharu, Fleet Kuching<br>
Philippines: Army  Cebu, Fleet Davao, Fleet Manila<br>
Thailand: Army  Bangkok, Army  Chiang Mai, Fleet Thammerat (East Coast)<br>
Vietnam: Army  Da Nang, Army  Hanoi, Hanoi<br>

<p>
<b>Game Play Comments</b>
<p>
The map has two dominant features - the mainland and the archipelago.  
On the mainland, the three-way contest between Thailand, Vietnam and 
China means that if two of these nations ally against the other, that 
nation is in serious trouble.  The seafaring nations face different 
challenges.  Supply centres, even home cities are separated by oceans, 
so fleets are more useful than armies.  Even for the mainland nations, 
sea power is essential for a solo win.
<p>
<b>Federation of Australia</b>
<p>
Main religious affiliations: Roman Catholic, Anglican<br>
Official language: English<br>
Governmental system: Federal constitutional monarchy - democratic<br>
Leaders: Prime Minister John Howard, Queen Elizabeth Windsor II<br>
Founding Father: Captain James Cook<p>
Australia is the only real Corner Power, and has a very defensible 
position.  Its only threat early in the game is an aggressive 
Filipino-Indonesian alliance.
<p>
<b>Peoples' Republic of China</b>
<p>
Main religious affiliations: Non-religious, Chinese folk religions<br>
Official language: Mandarin Chinese<br>
Governmental system: Communism (moving toward "Market Leninism")<br>
Leaders: Prime Minister Li Peng, President Jian Zemin<br>
Founding Father: Chairman Mao Zedong<p>
China will be keen to advance its historical claims on Hong Kong, Taiwan 
and the Spratly islands, but it will have to contend with other nations 
before it can do so.  China, like Thailand, faces the risk of losing its 
coastal centres if it concentrates too heavily on a land war.  Burma is 
China's "back door", although Thailand has a greater claim on it.
<p>
<b>Republic of Indonesia</b>
<p>
Main religious affiliations:  Islam<br>
Official language: Bahasa Indonesia<br>
Governmental system: Multiparty Republic - "Guided Democracy"<br>
Leader: President Suharto<br>
Founding Father: First president Sukarno<p>
Indonesia plays a similar role to Russia in the original game. Defending 
against attacks on two or three fronts is nearly impossible, but there 
are great opportunities to attack or stab, eg against Thailand and 
Malaysia.  It is important for Indonesia to either develop a strong 
alliance with Australia, or defeat that nation early in the game, since 
an Australian stab could be devastating.
<p>
<b>Federation of Malaysia</b>
<p>
Main religious affiliations: Islam<br>
Official language: Bahasa Malaysia<br>
Governmental system: Multiparty Constitutional Monarchy<br>
Leader: Prime Minister Dr. Mahatir, King Tuanku Jaafar Abdul Rahman (son 
of the founder)<br>
Founding Father: Tunku Abdul Rahman<p>
Malaysia's position is in some ways similar to that of Germany's, with 
excellent early opportunities, but a vulnerable central position.  If 
Malaysia can control the Malaysian sea, it will have good prospects 
throughout the game.
<p>
<b>Republic of the Philippines</b>
<p>
Main religious affiliations: Roman Catholic<br>
Official languages: Pilipino, English<br>
Governmental system: Multiparty Republic - democratic<br>
Leader: President Fidel Ramos<br>
Founding father: Andres Bonafacio<p>
The Philippines have a strong postion, with early opportunities in all 
directions.  It is also more defensible than Malaysia or Indonesia, 
having adjacent home supply centres. An alliance with either Australia 
or China will help secure solid growth.
<p>
<b>Kingdom of Thailand</b>
<p>
Main religious affiliations: Buddhism<br>
Official language: Thai<br>
Governmental system: Constitutional Monarchy: democratic<br>
Leaders: Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai, King Bhumibol Adulyadej<br>
Founding Father:  Khun Bang Klang Thao<p>
Thailand has better possibilities for mainland expansion than any other 
nation, but like China, it faces the risk of having its coastal centres 
overrun if it concentrates too heavily on a land war.  For example, an 
Indonesian-Malaysian alliance can exert strong pressure on Thammerat.  
Thailand must also guard its "back door", Burma.
<p>
<b>Socialist Republic of Vietnam</b>
<p>
Main religious affiliations: Buddhism, folk religions<br>
Official language: Vietnamese<br>
Governmental system: One-party republic - socialist<br>
Leaders: Prime Minister: Phan Van Khai, Chairman: Tran Duc Luong<br>
Founding father: Ho Chi Minh<p>
Vietnam perhaps has the weakest position in the game, situated between 
the other land powers and the archipelago.  Diplomatic possibilites are 
strong however, since it can seek alliance with either Thailand or 
China, and also exert influence into the oceans
<p>
<b>Notes</b>
<p>
<ul>
<li>For PBEM games, the one-letter abbreviation for Malaysia has the letter L, since M
is reserved for Game Master.
<li>The Philippines is simply named "Philippines" on the judge 
<li>Seventeen supply centres are required to win.
<li>Only two supply centres can be taken in the first year without fear of 
interference: East Timor by Australia and the Marianas Islands by The
Philippines.
<li>The only foreign home supply centre adjacency is Thammerat-Kota Bharu.
<li>Some of the territories (especially the seas) are fictitious or 
inaccurate.  They were designed to promote balanced and interesting 
play.
