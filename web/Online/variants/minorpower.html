<b>The game where both major and minor powers have power</b>

<p>
This is a 19-player variant with a mix between major powers, the
seven great powers in 
the standard game, and twelve minor powers, where each supply center which is
neutral in the standard game starts out as a one-center power in
this variant.  The twelve minor powers are listed below.
<p>The major powers start with the same units they have in the standard
game.  Minor powers which are coastal provinces are free 
to choose their starting unit.  This is the trade-off 
between major and minor powers.  Once units are selected, the game
proceeds according to the standard rules with the one exception that
powers may build in any owned supply center, not just home supply
centers.
<p>
For the judge implementation of this variant, a game of the chaos
variant is created and adjusted from 34 players to 19 with the 
help of the judge-keeper.  Since the Chaos variant is used, all
players are able to submit initial builds, but the major powers
are still required to choose the same units as in the standard
game.  Also because Chaos is used, the standard
power abbreviations cannot be used.  With 
apologies, the new abbreviations are:
<p>
A-Austria-Hungary:     Budapest, Trieste, Vienna.<br>
E-England        :     Edinburgh, Liverpool, London.<br>
F-France         :     Brest, Marseilles, Paris.<br>
G-Germany        :     Berlin, Kiel, Munich.<br>
I-Italy          :     Naples, Rome, Venice.<br>
R-Russia         :     Moscow, Sevastopol, St Petersburg, Warsaw.<br>
T-Turkey         :     Ankara, Constantinople, Smyrna.<br>
<p>
There are 12 minor powers.  These are the former neutral supply centres.  
Although they have fewer centres/units than the major powers, through 
negotiations and strategy, not to mention banding together, each has a real 
chance of winning the game.  They are:
<p>
0-Belgium :     Belgium.<br>
1-Bulgaria:     Bulgaria.<br>
2-Spain   :     Spain.<br>
3-Serbia  :     Serbia.<br>
4-Sweden  :     Sweden.<br>
5-Greeece :     Greece.<br>
6-Tunis   :     Tunis.<br>
7-Rumania :     Rumania.<br>
D-Denmark :     Denmark.<br>
H-Holland :     Holland.<br>
N-Norway  :     Norway.<br>
P-Portugal:     Portugal.<br>
