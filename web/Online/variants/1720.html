This map covers the same area as the standard map but takes place 200 years earlier. 
The rules are the same with victory conditions being 19 SC's. An army may move from
Grenada to Morocco as long as it has one more support than would normally be required.
You cannot retreat accross the Strait of Gibraltar. The powers are: Ottoman
Empire (yellow), Spain (orange), Hapsburg Empire (red), Russia (brown),
Poland (green), France (light blue), England (dark blue), and Scandanavia (purple).
In this variant, the first turn is a build phase where players may choose what
units to build.
