<i>Note from Markus Mohr
(<a href="mailto:mohr@mt.mb.uni-dortmund.de">mohr@mt.mb.uni-dortmund.de</a>):<br>
Here is a variant I found in a german
postal-play book. The original Name was "Dippy mit Dagobert". ("Onkel
Dagobert" is "Uncle Scrooge" in english, I think :-) )
I never played it till now and I dont know, why it should be limited to
9-12 persons. I think it could be played (theoretically) by 3-?.
So here it is:</i>
<p>
Kapitalistic Dippy is a Diplomacy variant from Dave Tant, translated in
german by Bernhard Knopp and re-translated by Markus Mohr. In addtion
to the standard rules and map, it includes the following rules:
<p>
<b>I.</b> KD is played by nine to twelve players und is not a game of
face-to-face negotiations. 
<p>
Each player chooses a pseudonym. All actions or press will be published
under this name.
 <p>
<b>II.</b> Every player gets 1000 currency-units from each power (A - Kronen, E
- Pounds, F - 
<p>
Franc, G - Mark, I - Lira, R - Rubel, T - Piaster). The Swiss Franc
(SFr) is used to 
<p>
calculate exchange courses. Each currency equals a 1 SFr value at the
beginning of the game. 
<p>
Exchange rates may change due to the course of events in the game,
according to market laws (demand/offer).
 <p>
<b>III.</b> Each turn encompasses 2 phases: commerce(1) and military(2)
movement
<p>
<b>1.</b> Commerce
<p>
<b>1.1</b> Each player may buy/sell foreign currencies
<p>
<b>1.1.1</b> Players must not sell more than 500 units of any given currency.
<p>
<b>1.1.2</b> Players are not allowed to indebt themselves
<p>
<b>1.1.3</b> Buying and selling takes place at the actual course of the last
evaluation.
<p>
<b>1.2</b> A saldo for each currency is calculated individually. For every 100
units or beginning thereof totally bought/sold the course changes plus/minus 0.01 SFr.
<p>
<b>1.2.1</b> Exchange rates of annihilated powers will be reduced to 0.00SFr.
<p>
<b>1.2.2</b> The minimum course is 0.01 SFr.
<p>
<b>1.3</b> Courses change plus/minus 5% per won/lost center in winter (military
bonus).
<p>
<b>1.4</b> The SFr is used for surplus amounts. It is always stable.
<p>
<b>2.</b> Military
<p>
<b>2.1</b> The Player holding most of a specific currency is the commander of
that particular country Tie situations are decided by tossing coins. This is
re-calculated after every exchange-phase.
<p>
<b>2.2</b> Autumn and winter orders are issueed by the same player. 
<p>
<b>IV.</b> Game End
<p>
The game ends with a military victory (18 centers) of a country or in
winter 1915. Each player receives per full 100 units of a currency per center of the
country one point (example: Italy has seven centers; Player A gets for 1798 Lira 17*7 =
119 points). Winner is the player with the most points.
<p>
<b>V.</b> Evaluation
<p>
The ensuing county-commanders have their money display underlined. All
players get their actual point value calculated and a value for each currency, which is
calculated exchange-course times 100 / owned centers.
<p>
Since the number of players exceeds that of countries, not every players
gets to move units. A player can opt for an only monetary strategy
without messing with armies.
