<P>
1.  The 1971 rule book applies except where amended below.
<P>
2.  Iceland (Ice), Ireland (Ire), Corsica (Cor), Sardinia (Sar), Sicily (Sic),
Crete (Cre) and Cyprus (Cyp) all become neutral supply centers.
<P>
3.  Iceland is adjacent to NAO and Nwg.<br>
    Ireland is adjacent to NAO and Iri.<br>
   Corsica is adjacent to GOL, TyS and Sar.<br>
Sardina is adjacent to GOL, Cor, TyS and WMS.<br>
Sicily is adjacent to TyS, Nap and Ion.<br>
Crete is adjacent to Ion, Aeg and EMS.<br>
Cyprus is adjacent to EMS.<br>
<P>
4.  There are now 41 supply centers.  The victory condition is 21 supply
centers.
<P>
Note: The initial scramble for neutral supply centers is much more
balanced; no power should lose out in 1901.
<P><i>
Additional note by Richard Jackson, UKVB Custodian:

It is a matter of opinion whether the last statement is correct.  It has
been suggested that by combining the Winter 1900 variant where there is
an extra season for players to choose what type of units to start the game
with, will produce a more evenly balanced game.  If anyone decides to
run this variant,  the variant bank will appreciate endgame statements
on its playability.</i>
