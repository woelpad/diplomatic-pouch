<dt><b>I. Introduction</b>
<dd>
In Time Travel Diplomacy (TTD), the armies and fleets of a power may be
ordered to transport themselves through time.  These pieces, then, can
make surprise appearances behind enemy lines, and suddenly occupy and
take foreign supply centers.
<P>
Units are ordered to move <tt>FROM</tt> and <tt>TO</tt> specified future
phases of the game, without moving from one location to another.  This is
important to note.  A unit moving through time does <i>not</i> move through
space -- it does <i>not</i> change locations.

<p>
<dt><b>II. New Orders</b>
<dd>
On any movement phase, in addition to the well-known support, convoy,
move, and hold orders, players have at their disposal two time travel orders,
the <tt>FROM</tt> and <tt>TO</tt> orders.
<!-- p>
Note that Time Travel orders are only allowed in <i>Spring</i> phases;
they are <i>not</i> permitted during <i>Fall</i> movement phases.
-->
<P>
The maximum number of time travel orders that may be issued on any turn
by each player is the number of supply centers then controlled by the
smallest, uneliminated player in the game.

<P>
<dl>
<dt><b>II.1 The <tt>FROM</tt> Order</b>
<dd>
The <tt>FROM</tt> order is used to call a unit <i>back</i> from some
future turn of the game.  The order must specify:
<ul>
<li>a unit type (army or fleet),
<li>a single location (from which the unit moves and where the unit will
    attempt to materialize on the present turn), and
<li>the game-turn from which the unit is to travel.
</ul>
<P>
The game-turn from which a unit is ordered to travel must be no less than
one and no more than six game-turns (three game-years) ahead of the present
phase. <!-- , and must
be a Spring phase. -->  For example, in Spring of 1901, units may be ordered
<tt>FROM</tt> any future movement phase up to and including 
Spring of 1904.
<P>
<tt>FROM</tt> orders function mechanically like any move attempt made from
an adjacent space; that is, units ordered <tt>FROM</tt> the future may be
stood off and may be supported in their attempt to materialize.
<P>
An example <tt>FROM</tt> order would be:  <tt>Fleet Brest FROM S1902</tt>.
This order calls for a fleet (owned by the ordering power) to (attempt to)
materialize in Brest on the present turn.  Additionally, <i>regardless of
whether the <tt>FROM</tt> order succeeds or is stood off,</i> the ordering
power is <i>committed</i> by this order (under penalty described  in rule
III.1, below) to
have a fleet in place at Brest at the beginning of Spring, 1902.
<p>
A power may <b>not</b> call two units <tt>FROM</tt> the same time and place.
That is, once a <tt>FROM</tt> order has been given specifying a unit,
location, and time, the player may not, in <i>any</i> later phase, issue another
<tt>FROM</tt> order that specifies the same time and place.

<P>
<dt><b>II.2 The <tt>TO</tt> Order</b>
<dd>
The <tt>TO</tt> order allows a player to send one of his units into the
future.  Like the <tt>FROM</tt> order, the phase to which a player may
(attempt to) send a unit with a <tt>TO</tt> order must be a no more than
three game-years ahead of the present phase.
<P>
When the specified movement phase arrives, units that had been sent
<tt>TO</tt> that phase may be stood off and may be supported in their
attempt to materialize if the corresponding <tt>FROM</tt> order is issued
by the player.  If such 
a unit is stood off, it is simply considered to have been destroyed.
<P>
An example <tt>TO</tt> order would be <tt>Army Moscow TO S1904</tt>.
Such an order might be used if Moscow was in danger of falling into enemy
hands.  It obliges the enemy to remember to defend Moscow against a coming
future invasion.
<P>
Tactically, the <tt>TO</tt> order can be used to free up extra builds.
By sending units in poor locations off the board,
the player may find himself able to build more new units in the coming
adjustment phase than he would otherwise have been able to build.
<P>
Additionally, a <tt>TO</tt> order, in combination with a <tt>FROM</tt>
order issued for the same location, can be used to swap an army for a fleet
or vice-versa.  For example, <tt>A BER TO S1902</tt> and <tt>F BER FROM
S1904</tt> has the effect of putting a fleet in Berlin instead of an army.

<p>
<dt><b>III. Temporal Loops</b>
<P>
<dl>
<dt><b>III.1 Paradoxes</b>
<dd>
If a player issues a <tt>FROM</tt> order and then does <b>not</b> have the
specified unit in place at the beginning of the specified future phase,
the player may not issue orders for <i>any</i> of his units on that turn.
All units owned by that power creating the "paradox" will <tt>HOLD</tt>
for that turn.

<p>
<dt><b>III.2 Loop Closure Not Required</b>
<dd>
Notice that if a paradox is avoided by the existence of a unit that was
mentioned in a previously given <tt>FROM</tt> order, all requirements on the
player are immediately lifted.  That is, while a player is free to do so, he
is not <i>required</i> to issue the corresponding <tt>TO</tt>
order for any <tt>FROM</tt> order that he had earlier used to call a unit
from the future.  To avoid the paradox penalty, he must only be <i>able</i>
to issue such an order.
<p>
For example, if a fleet in Skagerrak is called
back from Spring 1903 during the Spring 1901 turn, and if such a fleet (not
necessarily the same fleet, but one owned by the same
power) is indeed in Skagerrak at the beginning of Spring 1903 (thus avoiding
the paradox penalty), this fleet does
<i>not</i> need to be ordered <tt>TO</tt> the past.  It may be
given <i>any</i>
valid order (including not only that <tt>TO</tt> order, but any other
<tt>TO</tt> order, or any move, support, hold, or convoy order).
<P>
Similarly, units which are ordered <tt>TO</tt> a future phase need
<i><b>not</b></i>
be issued the corresponding <tt>FROM</tt> order when that future phase
arrives.  Any power neglecting to issue such an order is not penalized in
any way other than by the loss of the unit that would otherwise have (attempted
to) materialize.

<dt><b>IV. Game Termination</b>
<dd>
<dl>
<P>
<dt><b>IV.1 Victory</b>
<dd>
If at the conclusion of a Fall movement or retreat phase, a player has reached
the game's victory condition, the game continues from that point until
the beginning of the latest game-turn that had been mentioned in any
<tt>FROM</tt> order that had been issued by the would-be victorious power.
<P>
For this continuation, the would-be victor must specify whether or not time
travel orders (<tt>FROM</tt> and <tt>TO</tt>) are to be permitted.  After each
Fall movement or retreat phase during this continuation period, any player
controlling the majority of supply centers is entitled to dictate whether
time travel orders are to be allowed in the coming year.
<P>
If, after playing until the beginning of the latest game-turn mentioned in any
<tt>FROM</tt> order issued by the would-be victor, no paradox exists that was
caused by that player <b>and</b> if that player controls more supply
centers than any other single player, he is declared the winner and the game
is over.
<P>
If, however, the player is forced to suffer the paradox penalty of having his
units <tt>HOLD</tt> during the turn about to begin <b>or</b> if the player
does <b>not</b> control more supply centers than does any other player, the
game simply continues, with time travel orders permitted.  At the conclusion of
that game-year, victory conditions are checked anew.

<P>
<dt><b>IV.2 Draws</b>
<dd>
Draws equally rewarding all surviving players may be declared by the players
at any time.  In such cases, any pending potential paradoxes are ignored and
the game ends immediately.
