<b>Description</b>
<br>
The variant is similar to Payola, but with a little more
sanity tossed into the bowl. The variant allows a "what if" to take place:
what if England had only armies? What if Russia started out with a fleet in
the *north* coast of St. Petersburg? What if France had an army in Brest
instead of a fleet?
<P>
The variant uses a typical standard map and winning conditions. What differs
[or what may differ] is the starting positions of each power.
<P>
Each power starts out with 5 votes plus 5 votes per native SC that they are
in control of. Observers logged on *BEFORE* Spring 1902 also get 5 votes.
Each additional neutral SC [Por, Spa, Rum, etc] beyond the initial startup
is worth 1 extra vote and each additional non-neutral SC beyond the initial
startup [ie, your neighbour's HSC - Home Supply Centre] is worth 3 votes.
<P>
Vote Breakdown:<br>
5 power votes<br>
5 for each native HSC in control [ex. England owns Lon]<br>
3 votes for each opponent HSC in control [ex. England owns Bre]<br>
1 vote for each neutral SC in control [ex. England owns Nor]
<P>
Example - England with 10 SCs would get 31 votes [5 power + 15 from its
original Lon, Edi, Lvp SCs + 6 from controlling opponent HSCs Stp, Bre + 5
from controlling neutral SCs Nor, Swe, Den, Por, Spa]. 
<P>
An eliminated power retains their 5 initial votes. Votes can not be carried
over from one adjustment to the next. 
<P>
<b>Voting</b>
<br>
Before the game starts each power [and observer] votes on what
starts where. Once the initial voting is over, the JK manually changes all
of the starting positions in the game. Once this has been completed the game
will commence. Each power is in full control of his/her units during spring
and fall movement and retreat phases. 
<P>
The variant is setup to allow broadcast grey press to allow observers to
interact with the players and other observers [very important when it comes
to trolling for votes].
<P>
A power may vote one of two ways: no build, a fleet or an army [for coastal
SCs]; or no build or an army [for inland SCs]. The only exception is St.
Petersburg, which has two coasts. The voter must specify which coast a fleet
should be built at. If no specification, the choice will default to the
south coast. The votes do not have to be limited to their own units [ie,
vote strategically]. Example - If you are France and you have 20 votes [5
power + 15 from native HSCs Par, Bre, Mar] and you really do not want to see
a fleet start in London, then put 15 votes on "no unit in Lon". 
<P>
All votes are to be sent to the GM who enters the adjustment orders based
upon the votes cast by each power and each eligible observer [with the
exception of the initial setup which is entered by the JK]. The vote results
are made public but *not* who voted where. Individuals may announce how they
voted at their own discretion. Votes should be sent to the GM *prioritized*.
The order of the votes, rather than the number, is very important when it
comes to the tie-breaking mechanism. A 24hour notice will be given once all
votes are in and those with voting rights can change their mind right up
until the end of the 24hour period.
<P>
The votes are not secret. After the votes are cast, the GM broadcasts the
results [but not who voted what] in this format:
<P>
Lon - 13 votes fleet, 12 army, 9 nothing<br>
Edi - 3 fleet, 2 army, 0 nothing<br>
Lvp - 1 fleet, 1 army, 11 nothing<br>
England has one build and builds a fleet in London.
<P>
If a tie occurs the results line would tell the country that he or she has
to make a quick choice.
<P>

<b>Ties</b>
<br>In the US Senate, when there is a tie, the Vice-President casts the
deciding vote. Since the VP is part of the government [executive branch], it
gives the government a reprieve [so to speak] on an important bill or issue.
So, in the event of a tie, the home country has to choose among the lead
options [note: this should delay the game no more than a normal adjustment
period]. Four scenarios could occur:
<P>
S1:<br>
12 votes for f stp(nc), 12 votes for a mos, 12 votes for a war, 8 votes for
f stp(sc)
<P>
Russia has one build and voted for the f stp(sc). He is forced to choose
among the three other choices, none of which may appeal to him, but that's
Democracy.
<P>
S2:<br>
12 votes for f stp(nc), 12 votes for a mos, 12 votes for a war, 8 votes for
f stp(sc)
<P>
Russia has one build and voted for f stp(nc). Tie goes to the home country
and f stp(nc) is built.
<P>
S3:<br>
12 votes for f stp(nc), 12 votes for a mos, 12 votes for a war, 8 votes for
f stp(sc)
<P>
Russia has one build and voted for both f stp(nc) and a mos. Given that all
votes are sent prioritized, Russia's first preference [ie., first on the
ballot] was f stp(nc) and that is what gets built.
<P>
S4:<br>
12 votes for f stp(nc), 12 votes for a mos, 12 votes for a war, 8 votes for
f stp(sc) and Russia has one build and voted 3 votes for f stp(nc), 12 votes for a mos
<P>
As  the prioritization system is used for tie-breaking and Russia listed f
stp(nc) first, the GM is to  assume that Russia wants f stp(nc)  [Note: In
many Democracies that use proportional voting systems, the first choice at
the ballot is used in any run-off or tie-breaking system. It seems only
fitting to use it here]. The best way to ensure that this does not happen is
for players to put the build they *really* want at the top of their list.

<P>
<b>Adjustments</b>
<br>
During adjustments, voting will take place when it is time to build. All
those who are eligible to vote will place votes on what should be built
during that season's adjustment phase [even if they have nothing to build].
This is where building friendships will come in handy.
<P>
Example: The above-mentioned England has 10 SCs worth 31 votes [Edi, Lvp,
Lon, Nor, Swe, Stp, Den, Por, Spa and Bre] and has 1 build. Germany has 22
votes [5 power + 15 from Kie, Ber, Mun + 2 from Hol, Bel] and no builds.
France has 15 votes [5 power + 10 from Par and Mar] and no builds. England
places 31 votes on building a fleet at Edi and  Germany and France (both at
war with England) place 22 votes on no build in Lon and 15 votes on no build
in Lvp. The English build goes through. However, if Germany and France
combined and placed 37 votes for no build in Edi, England gets no build
*unless* it can convince Russia, Turkey, Italy, Austria or some of the
observers to support the English build. Since the game is broadcast only it
will allow for some creative strategic press and trolling [ie, groveling,
pleading, begging] for friendship votes.
<P>
Other than the above, standard diplomacy rules apply [ie., you can only
build in HSC that you control].
