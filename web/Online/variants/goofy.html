<b>    I. Board, Unit, Moving, Rules</b><br>
<P>
    All standard rules of Diplomacy (including board layout, unit types,
    moving) apply except for the winning conditions.
    <P>
<b>    II. Winning Conditions</b><br>
<P>
    To win you don't have to get 18 SC, but have more points after the
builds
    of 1910 (hardwired end) than anybody else or be declared the winner
by
    unanimous vote of all powers (including eliminated ones!!). If
anybody
    makes it up to 18 SC or more before 1910, the game continues until
one
    of the above conditions is met!
    <P>
<b>    III. Points </b><br>
<P>
    To win in this variant you must acquire points (called goofiness
points).
    <ol>
    <li> Getting points by voting from active players
    After each spring season (i.e. when fall moves are due) and winter
season 
    (i.e. if spring moves are due) all active players vote about each
others
    goofiness. For this, they must spend (exactly) 7 goofiness points
for the
    other players (not for themselves, of course :-). Voting is done by
    splitting up the 7 points among those powers that were still able to
move
    since the last vote except ones own up to a maximum of 3 points for
one power
    (should there remain 4 powers, the max. is raised to 5 points, with
3
    powers, it's 6 points, and with 2 powers, seven points). The GM 
    will also assign 7 points in the same fashion. Voting on goofiness
points
    is due before the next seasons moves are evaluated. Players can vote 
    secret or in the public, and of course both in which case the latest
private 
    message to the GM before the voting deadline is considered.
    
    <li> Getting points by voting from eliminated players
    Eliminated players may still vote on goofiness, however they only
have
    3 goofiness points to spend in the years after their elimination. If
a
    eliminated player chooses not to vote in a season, s/he will not be
    allowed to vote in any following season and will suffer a non-voting
    penalty of 5 points per season. You are considered 'eliminated' if
you
    do not own an SC according to the judge output.
    
   <li> Getting points for SC controlled
    After the winter adjustments have been evaluated, players get two
points 
    for each SC they own at the end of a year. 
    
   <li> Missing the voting deadline
    The next season will not be evaluated until all votes from the
active
    players are in.
    
  <li> Goofiness score board
    The goofiness point results of the last year as well as the
accumulated
    score for each power are published at the end of each year, and
unless
    a winner is agreed upon before, the person with the most accumulated
    goofiness points at the end of 1910 is declared the winner ("Goofy
of
        the Year" :-).
</ol>
    <P>
<b>    IV. What is Goofiness?</b><br>
    <ol>
    <li>Definition of Goofiness
    Goofiness is hard (or impossible) to define. Yet most players seem
to
    know what kind of play is goofy and what is not. Goofiness ranking
is
    completely up to the player assigning the points and can not be
    questioned by anybody else (of course it can be commented upon! :-)
    
   <li> Things that should be avoided
    The following things may seem goofy to people but are not intended
in
    this variant and should not be rewarded with goofiness points:<br>
    (a) Cross-gaming or Out-of-Game activities:
    Goofiness should remain within this game and not be transferred
    outside. Cross-gaming for example is *not* considered positively 
    goofy in this variant!<br>
    (b) Breaking the deadlines:
    Becoming late or going CD is just unfriendly to the other players.
    
 <li> A contradiction in terms?
    A possible problem in a game in which goofiness is encouraged can be
    that what is goofy in a normal game may not be considered goofy in a
    goofy game. Maybe normal play is goofy if the goal is to be goofy!
    (Now that's something to chew on, you logicians out there!)
   <p>
    Again, goofiness is in the eye of the beholder. :-)

 </ol>
<b>Addendum from the variant inventor:</b><br><p>
During the playing of a game of the goofy variant, players agreed that two points
per SC per year are too much if the goal is that the goofiest person should
win. One point or 1.5 points per owned SC per year should be just right.
In the game we chose 1.5 points. Yet the player with the most goofiness
points did not win because he had only 1/3 of the SC points of the winner
(who would have won regardless of whether 1, 1.5 or 2 points were assigned).
