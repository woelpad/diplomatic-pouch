The map is set up to reflect thepolitical situation of 1933, but it is not designed torecreate the events of the following decade.  It only hasthe potential to.  Hopefully players will enjoy all thatthis variant has to offer.<p><b>Introduction</b><p>The Imperial era ended with the death of a generation in theFirst World War.  In an effort to escape the horrors of theWar, the survivors buried themselves in the rampantconsumerism and hedonism of the 1920s.  That and the harshtreaty terms at Versailles caused a global economic collapse.As more and more people found themselves without homes, theold order was called into question.  To stabilize themselves,many nations attacked their weaker neighbors.  By themid-1930s, Communism and Fascism were seriously considered asthe only way modern industrial nations would survive.  Themilitaristic policies of the aggressor nations in the 1930slead the world to a new global conflict, and ended with thecreation of Superpowers and the destruction of Fascism.<p><b>Rules</b><p>This game runs entirely under Standard Diplomacy rules, witha few exceptions concerning the starting date and the numberof supply centers involved.<p><i>Start Date</i><p>The game has the same seasonal phases as                      Standard Diplomacy.  The game begins in                      Spring 1933.<p><i>Victory Conditions</i><p>In order to win, a single power must own                      74 Supply Centers at the beginning of a                      Fall turn.<p><i>Map Clarifications</i><p><dl><dt>Island Chains - (Hawaii, Carolines, Marshalls, Fiji,                       New Zealand, East Indies, Seychelles,                       Maldives, & Azores)<p><dd>                      Island Chains are coastal provinces.                      Both Armies and Fleets may occupy an                      Island Chain.  These provinces are                      accessable from any bordering sea zone.                      Fleets may not pass through as if                      Island Chains were canals, though.<p>                      Example: East Indies has access to Java<dd>                      Sea, Timor Sea, Bay of Bengal, East                      Indian, and the Southeast Trades.  A                      Fleet may occupy East Indies.  A Fleet                      in Java Sea may convoy an Army to East                      Indies.  A Fleet may not move from East                      Indian to Java Sea.<p><dt>Large Island Chains - (Luzon\Mindanao & Cuba\Haiti)<p><dd>                      Large Island Chains operate under the                      same rules as regular Island Chains.                      However, there is a province border                      that runs through Large Island Chains,                      and the two islands are connected by a                      land bridge.  It effectively turns them                      into two province islands.<p><dd>                      Example: Fleets and Armies may move                      freely between Cuba and Haiti.                      However, a unit may not move directly                      to Cuba from the Northeast Trades.                      Likewise, a unit may not move to Haiti                      from Gulf of Mexico or Florida Channel.                      Cuba and Haiti both have access to                      Sargasso Sea and the Caribbean.<p><dt>Straits & Canals    - (Bremen, Ankara, Cairo, & Panama)<p><dd>                      These work the same as canals do in                      Colonial Diplomacy.  The owner of these                      provinces may send fleets to                      neighboring sea zones without having to                      move into the canal zone first.  Owning                      players may also allow other players to                      send fleets through.<p><dd>                      Example: Britain owns Cairo.  The                      Britain player may order F(Aegean Sea)                      to Red Sea.  If there was an Italian                      fleet in the Aegean, the Britain player                      may also allow Italy F(Aegean Sea) to Red                      Sea.<p><dt>Land Bridges        - (Ireland<->Glasgow, Sicily<->Salerno,                       Denmark<->Norway, Denmark<->Sweden,                       Karnataka<->Ceylon, Singapore<->Malaysia,                       Kagoshima<->Tokyo, Tokyo<->Sapporo,                       Luzon<->Mindanao, & Cuba<->Haiti)<p><dd>                      Land bridges work as they do in Colonial                      Diplomacy.  Armies and Fleets may move                      from one province to the other connected                      by the land bridge.<p><dd>                      Example: A valid move, A(Salerno) to                      Sicily.<p><dt>Wraparound          - (Bering Sea, Westerlies, West Pacific,                       Equatorial Coutnercurrent, South Pacific,                       & Antarctic Pacific)<p><dd>                      These sea zones connect both ends of the                      map.  A Fleet may move or convoy from one                      side of the map to the other in these sea                      zones.<p><dd>                      Example: Japanese F(Kuril Trench) to                      Westerlies.  Japanese F(Westerlies) to                      North Pacific.</dl><p><b>Starting Positions</b><p><table cellpadding=7><tr valign=top><td>BRITAIN         <br>                    F London    (LON)      <br>A Edinburgh (EDI)     <br>F Glasgow   (GLA)     <br>F Quebec    (QBC)     <br>A Toronto   (TOR)      <br>A Cairo     (CAI)      <br>A Cape Town (CAP)      <br>A Delhi     (DEL)     <br>F Bombay    (BOM)      <br>F Hong Kong (HK)      <br>A Singapore (SG)<br>A Sydney    (SYD)<br><td>USA<br>A Washington DC (WAS)<br> F New York      (NYO)<br> A St. Louis     (SLO)<br>F New Orleans   (NOL) <br>A San Francisco (SFR)<br>A Anchorage     (ANC)<br>F Hawaii        (HAW)<br>A Panama        (PAN) <br>A Luzon         (LUZ)<br>F Mindanao      (MIN)<br><td>FRANCE<br>A Nantes     (NAN)<br>A Paris      (PAR)<br>F Marseilles (MAR)<br>A Conakry    (CON)<br>A Damascus   (DAM)<br>F Madagascar (MAD)<br>A Hanoi      (HAN)<br>F Saigon     (SAI)<br>F Fiji       (FIJ)<br><tr valign=top><td>USSR        <br>                           F Leningrad[wc] (LEN)  <br>  A Moscow        (MOS)  <br> F Sevastopol    (SEV)  <br>     A Orenburg      (ORN)  <br>   A Omsk          (OMS)  <br>     A Tashkent      (TAS)  <br>    A Irkutsk       (IRK) <br>A Vladivostok   (VLA)<br>A Kamchatka     (KAM)<br><td>JAPAN<br>A Tokyo     (TOK)  <br>F Sapporo   (SAP)  <br>F Kagoshima (KG)<br> A Okinawa   (OKI)<br>F Taiwan    (TA)<br>A Seoul     (SEO)<br>A Harbin    (HAR)<br><td>ITALY<br>F Rome      (ROM)<br> A Salerno   (SAL)<br>A Sicily    (SIC)<br>A Tirana    (TIR)<br>F Tripoli   (TRI)<br>A Mogadishu (MOG)<br><tr valign=top><td>GERMANY    <br>                  F Bremen  (BRE)         <br>     A Berlin  (BER)         <br>     A Dresden (DRE)         <br>   A Stutt.

The larger map hasthe complete names for each province.  However, its sizeis somewhat difficult for players to use.  The smaller mapis like a conference map for Standard or Colonial.  It isfairly easy to read, but all of the territory names aretheir three letter abbreviations.  Both maps have legendsto make them easier to undertand.  Graphic icons for theArmies and Fleets are provided in the legends.  It's bestto look at either map on a 1-1 or 2-1 ratio, any smallermakes them difficult to read.<p>I'd also like to thank you for downloading this variant.I hope that you and your friends enjoy playing with thismap.
