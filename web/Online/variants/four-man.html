Recently, we tried to put together a FTF game with 7 players.  As
happens all too often in Diplomacy we were short several players.  When
we finally sat down at the table we had only 4.  We contemplated playing
several different variants, but then decided we really wanted to play of
the Standard map.  After much thought we came up with a scenario that
worked pretty well.  It's a modified 1898 setup as follows:
<p>
Four-Man Diplomacy on a Standard Map:
<p> 
<b>1. Setup</b><br>
<P><table border=0>
<tr><td>        England  <td>         F London, A Liverpool
<tr><td>        France   <td>         A Paris
<tr><td>        Germany  <td>         A Berlin
<tr><td>        Russia   <td>         A Moscow
<tr><td>        Turkey   <td>         F Ankara
<tr><td>        Austria  <td>         A Vienna
<tr><td>        Italy    <td>         A Rome
 </table>
<p>
<b>2. Home SCs</b>
<p>Per usual for each of the seven standard powers
<p> 
<b>3. Players</b><br>
<P>        Player 1 = Russia and Italy<br>
        Player 2 = Germany and Turkey<br>
        Player 3 = France and Austria<br>
        Player 4 = England<br>
 <p>
<b>4. Victory conditions</b><br>
<P> 
        18 SCs by ONE country ONLY (so if you're playing France and Austria
ONLY one of these countries can win - with 18 SCs).
</ol>
This variant played out very nicely.  Interestingly, we noticed that if
two players left the room to "negotiate" it invariably left the other two
players at the map to do their own talking!  This had an effect on the
shift of alliances (after all why WERE those other two guys in another
room?!).
