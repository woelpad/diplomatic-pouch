<P>

Standard Diplomacy rules apply, except for a delay in builds.  Build orders
are given in the Winter phase, but builds occur <i>after</i> the Spring 
instead of before the Spring.  Victory conditions are 13 SC's. The powers
are: The French(red), British(blue), Spanish(yellow), Russians(green), The
Sioux(brown), and The Apache(grey).  The first turn is a build phase where
players may choose what units to build.  The first Spring is skipped,
units are built after the Spring, and the first move is a Fall move.
