<ol>
<li> This variant has three season per year (Spring, Fall, Winter).

<li> The only special rule is that if a unit of any power occupies a
    new supply centre, other Powers are allowed not to give diplomatic
    recognition to this fact.

<li> For each non-recognition to be effective:
<ol>
  <li> The Powers not recognizing the new ownership must be a majority
        of the Powers playing (ie 4 out of 7 or 6, 3 out of 5 or 4, 2 out
        of 3).

  <li> These powers must own a majority of the supply centres (18 at
        least in the Regular game).

  <li> They must all send their `non-recognition' orders the Winter 
        following the capture of the centre in question and repeat their
        orders each Winter as long as they wish to see the non-recognition
        effective (the composition of the non-recognizing Powers may
        vary, so long as they retain the double majority).
</ol>
<li> As long as a non-recognition is effective, the Power affected may not
    <i>own</i> the supply centre in question, not build for it, although
    they may occupy it.

<li> The purpose of this variant is to test the resolution of players to
    engage in `international diplomacy', to work out a sort of `United
    Nations' and not restrict themselves to diplomacy by 2s and 3s.
