The only difference between Standard and Layered Diplomacy is the
gameboard.  Layered Diplomacy is played on two standard Diplomacy maps
stacked in two layers, one on top of the other.  So, in addition to the
normal two dimensional movement, there is a third dimension.
<P>
The two layers are labeled "1" and "2" for simplicity and all
territories are refered to in the same way with the addition of a "1" or
"2" to the end of the name.  Thus, there exists a "mun1" and a "mun2."In
order to provide smooth game play, there are a few unique aspects to
Layered Diplomacy:
<P>
1)  All boundaries remain the same for each territory, except there is
exactly ONE more adjacent area either above or below. Support is given
in the same way and you can support a unit from one board to the other
using the same algorithm as in normal Diplomacy.  You may also convoy
between boards. The key thing to remember is that each territory has
only one adjacent territory on the other board and that adjacent
territory only differs by the number found at the end of it.
<P>
2)  Each player plays the same power on each board.
<P>
3)  Units may be built on either board with no consideration given to
which board the SCs where captured on, but can still only be built in an
unoccupied home centers.
<P>
4)  Victory conditions are 35 SCs.
