	<h3>Manus Hand and John Woolley</h3>

	<h3>1. INTRODUCTION</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>1.1 BASIC CONCEPT</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				In Crystal Ball Diplomacy, players must submit orders for each turn before
				they know what really happened on the previous turn.  In other words, the
				results for any given movement phase are not revealed to the players until
				after every player has issued (unchangeable) orders for the
				<i>subsequent</i> movement phase.
			</p>
			<p>
				To put it another way, your units don't begin to respond to their
				orders until the next movement phase beyond the one when they'd
				normally respond.  You always have two sets of orders, not one,
				"in the pipe."  There's a big premium on correctly discerning
				now what's going to happen later; you can't respond to anything
				immediately; you watch in frustration as your units go on trying
				to execute a plan that's already failed, etc. -- just as in real
				warfare.
			</p>
			<p>
				If regular Diplomacy is (as has been remarked) like a knife-fight in
				a dark room, Crystal Ball Diplomacy is like a knife-fight in a dark
				room on cough syrup.  Conducted in Aramaic.  With earplugs.
			</p>
			<p>
				But remember General Patton's comment: "it rains on the enemy, too."
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>
			<b>1.2 EXTENT OF THE VARIANT</b>
		</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				The delay in the delivery of adjudicated results to the players (mentioned
				above) is the main difference between standard Diplomacy and CBD.
				However, to prevent abuse of the rules by card-carrying fortune-tellers,
				a minor change is introduced regarding the submittal of orders.
				Otherwise, the underlying rules of Diplomacy remain unchanged and in force.
			</p>
			<p>
				Note that retreats, builds, and removals are <b><i>not</i></b> planned
				(or mis-planned) in advance.  Players enter orders for retreat and
				adjustment phases as these phases occur; players do <i>not</i> need to
				"forecast" such orders (though they <i>do</i> need to have thought out
				these contingencies if they hope to have an order entered and waiting for
				a new or retreated unit).
			</p>
		<dt>1.3.  PHASES OF THE GAME</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Thinking about Crystal Ball Diplomacy and the sequence in which its world
				unfolds can be a bit confusing.  To chart a path through that confusion,
				the sequence of a game of Crystal Ball Diplomacy is shown below.

				</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				In Crystal Ball Diplomacy, submission of movement orders differs from
				the usual order-writing procedure of standard Diplomacy.  This difference
				is discussed in detail in the next section of these rules.
			</p>
	</dl>
	<hr>
	<h3>2. ORDER LISTS</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>2.1 ABOUT ORDER LISTS</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Orders for a movement phase in Crystal Ball Diplomacy are submitted in
				"lists."  In addition to the usual adjudication (bounce, cut support,
				and so on), some orders may turn out to be impossible due to the fact
				that the unit mentioned does not exist (or at least does not exist
				at the specified location).
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, some or all of your orders may turn out to be void.
				That is your fault.  Or maybe (if order lists are being made public -- see
				below) you did it on purpose to deceive
				someone.  But then, that would be <i>wrong</i>, wouldn't it?
			</p>
		<dt>2.2 ORDER LISTS REQUIRED</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				An order list must be received from each player having units
				in order to advance the game to the next phase.
			</p>
		<dt>2.3 ORDER FORMAT</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Each order in an order list must contain the type of unit (Army
				or Fleet) being ordered, followed by the province or body of water in
				which the player imagines it to be situated when the list will be
				processed, followed by the order to be given to that unit.
			</p>
			<p>
				For example,
				if the player is unsure whether he will have an army or a fleet in London,
				he must use two separate orders to make sure to order that unit to
				Yorkshire.
			</p>
			<p>
				Each order
				must be a valid, legal Diplomacy order (with the single assumption made
				that all units mentioned in the order do in fact exist).  That is, a
				unit may not be ordered to an impassible space, nor may a convoy order
				be issued to a fleet on land.  This restriction is to prevent use of
				the order list as a plain-text mechanism for sending messages between
				players in no-press games, such as
				<blockquote>
					F BRE - ENG HEY GERMANY: I'LL BE PLAYING SEALION THROUGH 1902
				</blockquote>
			</p>
	</dl>
	<hr>
	<h3>3. ORDER LIST PROCESSING</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>3.1 CONSIDERED AND IGNORED ORDERS</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				An order list may contain as many orders as the player wishes to
				issue, but only a certain number of them (from the top of the list down)
				will be "considered." The number of orders that will be "considered" is
				the same for all players; it is the number of supply centers controlled
				by the largest power on the board at the time the lists are processed.
			</p>
			<p>
				<i>
					[Note that this applies only to <b>non-<span class="tt">PROXY</span></b> orders.
					<span class="tt">PROXY</span> orders (which may appear anywhere in an order list)
					are counted and handled separately.  See Rule 3.3.]
				</i>
			</p>
			<p>
				For example, if England controls seven supply centers, and no other power
				controls more than seven, then the <b>first</b> seven orders in
				<b>each</b> player's order list will be considered.  The eighth and
				subsequent orders in each list (if any) will be marked <span class="tt">ignored</span>.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thus, for Spring (and Fall) 1901, each player may issue <i>four</i> orders for
				consideration (since Russia owns four supply centers).  So if you are England,
				you might issue the following <b>Fall</b> order list:
				<blockquote>
					F NWG C A Edi - Nwy<br>
					A Edi - NWG - Nwy<br>
					F Lon - ENG<br>
					F ENG - Bre
				</blockquote>
				and all four orders will be considered, meaning that if you have a fleet
				in the Channel, it will try to take Brest, and if you don't (because
				your Springtime attempt to move there was bounced by France), you will
				once again try to leave London to cause trouble for the Frenchman.
			</p>
			<p>
				This rule makes it a bit <i>easier</i> on the smaller
				countries and <i>tougher</i> on the larger countries, tending to even out the
				game.  Thus, if you are poor at predicting your future (and your strength
				in the game begins reflecting this), you'll get a better chance to defend
				yourself than would someone who might be a little better (luckier?) at
				prognostication.
			</p>
			<p>
				The number of orders in an order list is unlimited.  Players are free to
				use any orders (usually, those they know will be ignored) to convey messages
				to other players, which might be handy in a no-press game.  For example,
				England could have used his fourth (or a fifth, etc.) order to write
				<span class="tt">A&nbsp;Mun-Bur</span>, which might tell Germany something -- though
				probably too late!
			</p>
		<dt>3.2 VOID AND "NO UNIT" ORDERS</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Some or all of the considered (i.e., non-<i>ignored</i>) orders in a
				list may specify an impossible action (for example, an attempt to convoy
				using a fleet that is not there, or an order of support for a
				non-existent unit).  Any unit whose issued order is impossible will
				<span class="tt">HOLD</span> during the movement phase for which it received the
				impossible order, and <b>will</b> be eligible to receive support.
			</p>
			<p>
				Considered orders that are issued for units that do not exist (or that
				do exist but are owned and controlled by another power) will be marked
				"<span class="tt">no&nbsp;unit</span>" or "<span class="tt">noProxy</span>" respectively.
				Such orders have no effect other than the use
				of an order in the total number of considered orders for that player.
			</p>
		<dt>3.3 PROXIED UNITS</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				A player may, in his order list, issue <span class="tt">PROXY</span> orders, each giving
				control of a particular unit for that phase to any other specified,
				non-eliminated player.
			</p>
			<p>
				As with non-<span class="tt">PROXY</span> orders, only a certain number of <span class="tt">PROXY</span>
				orders are "considered," the others being ignored.  In the case of
				<span class="tt">PROXY</span> orders, the number that can be "considered" is the number
				of supply centers controlled by the <i>smallest</i> (non-eliminated) power
				in the game <i>[credit for this rule goes to Pitt Crandlemire]</i>.
				Unless contradicted later in the list by another considered
				order for the same unit, <i>every</i> considered <span class="tt">PROXY</span> order in
				an order list will be honored.
			</p>
			<p>
				Let's say that you are England, allied with France, and you theorize
				that in a certain Spring you will have armies in Belgium and Ruhr, and
				France will have a new build in Paris.  You and France plan that at this
				point, France will use his Paris army to take Munich with your support.
				However, your order lists are:
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Spring</th>
						<th width="10%"></th>
						<th>Fall</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td class="tt">
							A Bel - Bur<br>
							A Ruh S A Bel - Bur
						</td>
						<td></td>
						<td class="tt">
							A Ruh S A Bur - Mun<br>
							A Bur PROXY TO FRANCE
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				By the time France knows that your army, not his, will be in Burgundy,
				his Fall <span class="tt">Bur-Mun</span> order will be locked in.  Your proxy will
				save you the trouble of issuing the order yourself, freeing up a
				"considered" (non-<span class="tt">PROXY</span>) order spot.  In short, you look like
				an evil genius.
			</p>
			<p>
				Units proxied from one power to another <i><b>must</b></i> be ordered
				(or left unordered, but may <i>not</i> be "re-proxied") by the power
				receiving the proxy.  Any unit that is proxied twice on the same turn
				(first by its true owner, then again by the power receiving the owner's
				proxy) will <span class="tt">HOLD</span>.
			</p>
		<dt>3.4 UNITS ORDERED TWICE OR NOT ORDERED</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				If two or more dissimilar orders are given for the same (existing) unit,
				and if any two of these are <b><i>considered</i></b> (that is, not
				<i>ignored</i>), then the <b>last</b> such considered order is followed.
			</p>
			<p>
				As in standard Diplomacy, any units left unordered in a movement phase
				will <span class="tt">HOLD</span> and may be supported.  This applies to <span class="tt">PROXY</span>
				orders in that if the power granted the <span class="tt">PROXY</span> does not issue an
				order to the unit, the unit will <span class="tt">HOLD</span>.
			</p>
		<dt>3.5  ORDER LIST ANNOTATION</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				When each turn is adjudicated, each of the orders in an order list is
				annotated according to the list below:
				<ul>
					<li>
						<span class="tt b">ordered</span> if the order is issued to one of the power's
						own units,
					<li>
						<span class="tt b">no unit</span> if the order is given to a unit that does not
						exist,
					<li>
					<span class="tt b">trumped</span> if the unit being issued the order has already
						been issued an order earlier in the order list,
					<li>
						<span class="tt b">proxied</span> if the order is a proxy order that
						is issued for one of the power's own units, and the receiver of the
						proxy has issued an order to the unit,
					<li>
						<span class="tt b">noProxy</span> if the order is given to a unit owned by
						another power, and for which no proxy was given to the ordering power,
					<li>
						<span class="tt b">refused</span> if the order is a proxy order to a unit that
						is <i>not</i> given an order by the power to whom the proxy was offered,
					<li>
						<span class="tt b">byProxy</span> if the order is issued to a unit owned by
						another power, by virtue of the ordering power receiving a proxy
						for that unit,
					<li>
					<span class="tt b">reProxy</span> if the order is a proxy order for a unit for
						which the ordering power himself received a proxy from the unit's owner
						(the unit will <span class="tt">HOLD</span>),
					<li>
						<span class="tt b">ignored</span> if the order appears too far down in the
						player's order list to be considered,
					<li>
						<span class="tt b">default</span> if the order is a <span class="tt">HOLD</span> order added
						to the list automatically to provide an order for a unit left unordered
						by the owning power or the power to whom a proxy was offered.
				</ul>
			</p>
		<dt>3.6  ORDER LIST SECRECY</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				The GameMaster may not divulge the contents of any player's "locked-in"
				order list, in full or in part, to any other player, even if requested
				to do so by the player who had submitted the order list.
			</p>
			<p>
				In a game that allows communication (press) between players, the full
				annotated order list submitted by each player for an
				adjudicated phase is available <b><i>only</i></b> to the submitting player.
				Each player has full access to all of his <i>own</i> order lists for
				the game, but has no access to those of other powers until the end of
				the game, when all order lists are revealed.
			</p>
			<p>
				However, in no-press games (and optionally in press games), the
				lists <i>are</i> made public immediately.  This allows players to
				use extra, ignored, orders to communicate their intentions and wishes.
			</p>

	<hr>
	<h3>4. GAME TERMINATION</h3>
	<dl>
		<dt>4.1 SOLO VICTORY</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				If a player achieves a solo victory, players may actually submit order
				lists for an unnecessary Spring movement phase.  If the Game Master
				realizes a solo victory has been achieved, he may process the
				final Fall movement phase early (without having collected order lists
				for the subsequent Spring).
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>4.2 DRAWS</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				Players may agree to share a draw equally among all surviving players at
				any time.  Such agreement is immediate, and is not contingent on any phase
				of the game that is yet to be processed.
			</p>
		</dd>
		<dt>4.3 PLAYER ELIMINATION</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>
				A player who is eliminated in a Fall movement phase will not know about
				his elimination until after he has submitted orders for the subsequent
				Spring phase.
			</p>
			<p>
				Even if a Game Master notices that a player is eliminated,
				he must <b><i>not</i></b> inform the player of his elimination before the
				orders accomplishing his elimination are processed.  Such a player is
				still eligible to share in any declared draw, and other players may
				be negotiating with him on the basis of his supposed survival.
			</p>
			<p>
				Additionally, if any other player had issued <span class="tt">PROXY</span> orders for
				the coming Spring phase, which give to the now-eliminated player the right
				to issue orders for any unit, those orders <b><i>will</i></b> be honored.
				That is, despite being eliminated, the player will indeed
				be able to receive and execute any proxies he was offered by other
				players for the initial Spring turn after his elimination (but not
				for any subsequent turn).
