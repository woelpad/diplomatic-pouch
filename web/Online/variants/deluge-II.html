<P>
This set of rules are a considerable improvement over and above
the original rules published originally in He's Dead Jim No.17.
Many of the changes included here were discussed by myself with
Tim Sharrock (the original designer) back in 1979, others stem
from comments made by Denis Jones in Surfa Rosa 5, and yet others
are refinements of my own. Abstraction A/F rules are available
<a href="http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/afrules.htm">here</a>.
<P>
0. Regular Diplomacy rules apply except when they don't.
<P>
1. The game begins in Winter 1900 which is played as a separate
season.. Players may decide which type of unit to build in their
home centres in readiness for Spring 1901. Russia may build F(StP)nc
if it wishes.
<P>
2. Any army in a coastal province may, instead of being ordered
to move or support, be ordered to turn into a fleet. Such a transformation
will be successful provided the unit is not dislodged that move.
<P>
3. Rising sea levels result in the gradual submergence of provinces
according to Table 1 below. Submergences occur every year after
any adjustments in Winter. Once submerged, a s.c. is effectively
destroyed and may not be used for the following Winter's adjustments.
<P>
Table 1 - Submergences
<P>
W 1901: Lon, Hol, Bel, Gas, Ven, Lvn.<BR>
W 1902: Yor, Pic, Apu, Rum, Sev, Fin, Syr, Den, Lpl.<BR>
W 1903: Arm, Bre, StP, Par, Tus, Nap, Bud, Kie.<BR>
W 1904: Ber, Mos, Mar, Por, Rom, Vie, Bul, Gre, Pru, Ruh, Gal,
Ukr, Con.<BR>
W 1905: Wal, Cly, Swe, Tri, Alb, War, Ice.<BR>
W 1906: Edi, Spa, Tun, Ser, Smy, Sil, Boh.<BR>
W 1907: Nwy, Mun, Pie, Tyr, NAf, Bur, Ank.
<P>
4. Armies in provinces which submerge are drowned!
<P>
5. New supply centres are formed in the course of the game, after
all Winter retreats and adjustments, according to Table 2.
<P>
Table 2 - New Supply Centres
<P>
W 1901: Wal, Ruh, Tyr. <BR>
W 1902: Ukr, Ice.<BR>
W 1903: Pie. <BR>
W 1904: Boh, Sil.<BR>
W 1905: Swi.<BR>
W 1906: NAf.
<P>
When a new s.c. is created it immediately comes under the control
of (1) any unit occupying that province, (2) the last country
to have a unit in that province (spring or autumn), (3) the country
within whose boundary the new s.c. lies or (4) if none of the
above it is neutral.
<P>
6. Iceland is a valid space in this variant and it becomes passable
after W 1901. The province of Switzerland becomes passable after
W 1904.
<P>
7. Players may build units in any vacant supply centre which they
control.
<P>
8. As per Deluge I, all <a href="http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/afrules.htm">Abstraction A/F</a>
 convoy rules apply.
<P>
9. The winner is the survivor (if any) after W 1908.
