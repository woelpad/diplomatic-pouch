<h2 align=center>Empire Surveys</h2>
</a>

To give you all a reason to come back to the Empire page regularly, I've decided
to ask you a new question once every few months. The results will be posted here, perhaps along with a few of my own comments. I may even eventually use a few of the surveys as the base for a future DipPouch article.

<h3>Question #3 - Summer 1998</h3>

  <blockquote><i>
What is the strategic importance of Hawaii to the four western powers? Which needs it most/least?
  </i></blockquote>

  <p>
<a href="mailto:vim2@rocketmail.com">Send</a> me your answer, no matter how short, and keep an eye out for the results sometime next month! If you have suggestions for the
next question, let me know.

<h2>Survey Results</h2>

<h3>Question #1 - Winter 1998</h3>
</a>

  <blockquote><i>
What is your favorite Empire power and why?
  </i></blockquote>

Lynn Mercer writes, "My empire experience comes mainly from the north of the map, but if I had to pick a favorite power, I'd go with Peru or New York. Both have reasonably secure homelands, seem to have good avenues for expansion and don't seem to be too easy to eliminate."

<p>
Simon Withers adds, "Hmmm..... Played Florida, Texas, Mexico, California, Cuba and Quebec.

<p>I'd have to go with Texas.  Texas has a *huge* variety of openings, and
also has the danger of many neighbours to go with it.  I'd probably like
Heartland alot for the same reasons, but I haven't played there yet."

<p>
<h3>Question #2 - Spring 1998</h3>

  <blockquote><i>
What is/are the most hotly contested neutral SC(s) in Empire4? Why and by whom?
  </i></blockquote>

Murray Grelis says, "The most hotly contested neutral SC, from my experience is Missouri. Firstly, Texas and Heartland fight over it, and Florida and New York are close enough to make a fight there if they do well. I've even come close to it as BC; if I'd played better I'd have taken it. I've even seen Peru get close. The reason for this is its central location. Most nations that were close to victory would probably own it."

<p>
Lynn Mercer agrees in part, "I'd say the two most critical provinces on the map are Missouri and Ontario due to their pivotal position between THF and HQN and their access to neighboring supply centers. A power which controlled both would probably dominate the Eastern half of the map."

<p>
Stewart Alexander writes, "I think it is Tennessee - one mean little neutral SC to try and control. Tennessee is a hotly contested neutral SC between Heartland and Florida in the beginning of the game. However, it still is hotly contested in the midgame because as the west and east reduce the number of powers on each side, the middle becomes a HUGE battle ground. In the mid-game, Tenessee is important because if you are an eastern power it leads you to Lousiana and you can start to knock on Texas's door. If you are a western power it allows you quick access into North Carolina or Georgia(depending on what part of the map you need to gain)."

<p>
Felix Spehlmann lists a few, "The most contested neutral SCs on the map are Yucatan, Tennessee, Kansas and Ohio. And guess what, Heartland is contesting for three of them. Reasons:
<ul>
<li>Yucatan - It's within 2 moves reach of three powers, and even Florida might see it as natural expansion ground. It's top on this short list.
<li>Tennessee - It's within 2 moves reach of two powers, and both of these powers can easily risk a shot at it, because they can do so from sure SCs (Missouri for Heartland Georgia for Florida). They can and will both keep trying to get it.
<li>Kansas - Again, 2 moves from two powers. And both powers will keep trying toget it, because they both have a neighbouring natural neutral (Colorado for Texas and Missouri for Heartland).
<li>Ohio - This is once again within 2 moves from three powers. And in my opinion, it decides who will dominate the northeast. Ontario is a natural for Quebec, while Michigan is almost sure to be Heartland territory. But the fate of Ohio is undecided and will probably be the bargaining coin in discussions between QNH."
