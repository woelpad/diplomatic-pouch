    <h3>Introduction</h3>
  </a>

The latest version of the Fall of the American Empire Diplomacy Variant is called 
  <a href="pictures/empire3.gif" target="map">Empire3</a>.
The changes between this version of the map and the previous one were relatively minor:

<ul>
  <li>Mexico is now known by the letter X on the judge, instead of E.
  <blockquote><i>This was the intention from the start, but necessitated a code change.</i></blockquote>
  <li>A new space called Lesser Antilles has been added. Draw a line from Santo Domingo to Venezuela, splitting the Eastern Caribbean Sea in two. The rightmost space created is the new Lesser Antilles space while the remaining one remains the East Caribbean Sea. 
  <blockquote><i>The space was added to increase Cuban influence over Venezuela.</i></blockquote>

  <li>Chihuahua now borders New Mexico; West Texas no longer borders Sonora. 
  <blockquote><i>This was done to make New Mexico a more important space, and also to more closely match the 'real world' situation, where Chihuahua borders New Mexico and Arizona.</i></blockquote>

  <li>Quebec now starts with a fleet in Quebec City instead of an army, as well as an army in Montreal instead of a fleet. 
  <blockquote><i>This should strengthen Quebec, which was weakened too much in Empire2, by enabling her to reach Nova Scotia in 1999.</i></blockquote>

</ul>

    <h3>Notes on the Empire3 Map</h3>
  </a>

  <p>
There are a few canals and waterways in Empire3: 

<ul>
  <li>New York City-New York State - the Hudson Canal (fleets can move from one to the other)
  <li>Panama - the Panama Canal (acts like Kiel in Standard)
  <li>Ontario (acts like Kiel in Standard)
  <li>Mississippi (fleets can move from province to province from Louisiana
to Chicago and on to the Great Lakes)
  <li>St-Lawrence (fleets can move from province to province from Quebec
to Ontario and on to the Great Lakes) </li>
</ul>

  <p>
Other than that, there are also a few landbridges:
<ul>
  <li>Units can move between Ungava and NWT. This does not block movement between Hudson Bay and the Sea of Labrador.
  <li>Units can move between Michigan and the Upper Peninsula. This does not block movement between Lake Michigan and Lake Huron.

</ul>
