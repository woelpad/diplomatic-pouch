    <h3>Introduction</h3>
  </a>

Current <a href="empiretest.htm#games">testing</a> 
has shown that Empire has not yet reached a final state. I have been collecting player comments and kibbitzing with a few people and have come up with a few ideas. 

<p>These changes are listed below, but you can also see a 
  <a href="pictures/empire4.gif" target="map">map</a> which incorparates the changes.

<ul>

  <li>Vancouver was extended to touch Alaska / Northern BC no longer borders
the Pacific.

  <li>The Gulf of Alaska was merged with the North Pacific Ocean and the
former name was kept.

  <li>Mid Pacific Ocean was renamed North Pacific Ocean.

  <li>The Bay of Banderas was removed - Guadalajara now touches both the
Gulf of California and the Coast of Mexico.

  <li>The northwestern part of the Coast of Mexico is now the new Mid Pacific
Ocean space, bordering Baja California and Hawaii.

  <li>Coast of Mexico now borders Guatemala and El Salvador / Gulf of Tehuantepec
no longer borders Gulf of Fonseca. The latter no longer borders Guatemala,
but the former does.

  <li>Coast of Mexico now borders Galapagos / South Pacific Ocean is cut
off from Gulf of Tehuantepec and Gulf of Fonseca.

  <li>Sonora was removed and completely absorbed by Chihuahua.

  <li>Cuba's 3rd home SC is no longer Santo Domingo (now back as neutral
SC Dominican Republic) but is Kingston instead (replacing the neutral SC
Jamaica).

  <li>West Caribbean was extended to touch Havana and Camaguey / Cayman trench
no longer borders the Straits of Yucatan.

  <li>The Gulf of Mosquitos, present in Mousna and NaModern, returns in Empire4.
      It was created out of the southern part of the West Caribbean.
      The latter was thus cut off from Panama and Costa Rica.

  <li>Peru starts with a fleet on the north coast of Cali instead of the
south coast.
</ul>

  <p>
Effects of the changes:

<ul>
  <li>BC has a slightly better defensive position since an army in Vancouver
could defend all three home SCs.

  <li>Chihuahua is now contestable by 3 powers (California, Mexico and Texas)
in 1999 rather than be a freebie for Texas. Texas is still guaranteed 3
builds though&nbsp;(Colorado, Louisiana and Nuevo Leon).

  <li>California/Mexico interaction is increased by reducing the distance
between the two.

  <li>California now has a choice of openings - go after Chihuahua via Baja
California or a more defensive opening in case BC attacks which can also
be used to go after Hawaii.

  <li>An initial BC opening attack on California is more likely to succeed
because California might have opened to Baja and be unable to defend the
West Coast.

  <li>Mexico can take Guatemala with her fleet instead of with the Veracruz
army, allowing both to go north, or allowing Mexico to go for Yucatan as
well.

  <li>Peru/Mexico interaction is increased by reducing the distance between
the two.

  <li>Cuba's opening position is more defensive and has more possibilities.
Four SCs can be reached in 1999, and 2 of them can be guaranteed (Dominican
Republic and Nicaragua). The Holguin army can now be convoyed off Cuba
in 1999 - to Nicaragua.

  <li>The fate of Yucatan is now more questionable.

  <li>Peru now has the choice of taking Venezuela with an army and Panama
with a fleet or vice-versa.

</ul>
