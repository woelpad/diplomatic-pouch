  <h3>Changes Between 
    <a href="pictures/empire.gif" target="map">Empire</a> and
    <a href="pictures/empire2.gif" target="map">Empire2</a>
  </h3>

  <ul>
  <li>There is now a landbridge between Ungava and Nunavut. This will allow
an army to move between these two spaces without blocking fleet movement
between the Sea of Labrador and Hudson Bay. The idea is to give Quebec
and BC greater access to each other.

  <li>The Manitoba/NWT adjacency has been removed and replaced by a Nunavut/Saskatchewan
adjacency. Again, the idea is to make Quebec and BC closer to each other.

  <li>The Ontario/Abitibi adjacency has been removed and replaced by a Montreal/Northern
Ontario adjacency. This makes Quebec closer to Montreal and makes army
movement across Ontario easier.

  <li>The New&nbsp;Brunswick supply center has been moved to Nova Scotia.
This SC can no longer be reached by Quebec in 1999, making it equidistant
to NewYork.

  <li>Peru will start with a fleet on the south coast of Cali, not the north.
This will make Venezuela a more hotly contested SC between Cuba and Peru.

  <li>The biggest change is probably the movement of Heartland north to Minneapolis,
Milwaukee and Chicago. This will give the two central powers, Texas and
Heartland, more room to maneuver, and bring Heartland into the BC/Quebec
equation.

  <li>Wyoming is no longer a neutral SC, and Missouri is one.&nbsp;Wyoming
was no longer needed to create BC/Heartland interaction, as Heartland has
been moved north.

  <li>California's starting fleet is now in San Diego. This is more accurate,
as San Diego has a large naval base, yet also compensates BC's loss of
Manitoba to Heartland and the removal of Wyoming as an SC.

  <li>Sonora and Durango now border each other along the coast. Chihuahua
no longer borders the coast. This will allow Chihuahua to be more easily
defended by Texas, should he take it.

  <li>Coahuila now borders Potosi; Nuevo Leon no longer borders Durango.
This should reduce tension between Texas and Mexico further.
  </ul>

  <h3>Changes Between 
    <a href="pictures/empire2.gif" target="map">Empire2</a> and
    <a href="pictures/empire3.gif" target="map">Empire3</a>
  </h3>

  <ul>
  <li>Mexico is now known by the letter X on the judge, instead of E.

  <li>A new space called Lesser Antilles has been added. Draw a line from
Santo Domingo to Venezuela, splitting the Eastern Caribbean Sea in two.
The rightmost space created is the new Lesser Antilles space while the
remaining one remains the East Caribbean Sea. The space was added to increase
Cuban influence over Venezuela.

  <li>Chihuahua now borders&nbsp;New Mexico; West Texas no longer borders
Sonora. This was done to make New Mexico a more important space, and also
to more closely match the 'real world' situation.

  <li>Quebec now starts with a fleet in Quebec City instead of an army, as
well as an army in Montreal instead of a fleet. This should strengthen
Quebec, which was weakened too much in Empire2, by enabling her to reach
Nova Scotia in 1999.
  </ul>

  <h3>Changes Between 
    <a href="pictures/empire3.gif" target="map">Empire3</a> and
    <a href="pictures/empire4.gif" target="map">Empire4</a>
  </h3>

  <ul>

  <li>Vancouver was extended to touch Alaska / Northern BC no longer borders
the Pacific.

  <li>The Gulf of Alaska was merged with the North Pacific Ocean and the
former name was kept.

  <li>Mid Pacific Ocean was renamed North Pacific Ocean.

  <li>The Bay of Banderas was removed - Guadalajara now touches both the
Gulf of California and the Coast of Mexico.

  <li>The northwestern part of the Coast of Mexico is now the new Mid Pacific
Ocean space, bordering Baja California and Hawaii.

  <li>Coast of Mexico now borders Guatemala and El Salvador / Gulf of Tehuantepec
no longer borders Gulf of Fonseca. The latter no longer borders Guatemala,
but the former does.

  <li>Coast of Mexico now borders Galapagos / South Pacific Ocean is cut
off from Gulf of Tehuantepec and Gulf of Fonseca.

  <li>Sonora was removed and completely absorbed by Chihuahua.

  <li>Cuba's 3rd home SC is no longer Santo Domingo (now back as neutral
SC Dominican Republic) but is Kingston instead (replacing the neutral SC
Jamaica).

  <li>West Caribbean was extended to touch Havana and Camaguey / Cayman trench
no longer borders the Straits of Yucatan.

  <li>The Gulf of Mosquitos, present in Mousna and NaModern, returns in Empire4.
      It was created out of the southern part of the West Caribbean.
      The latter was thus cut off from Panama and Costa Rica.

  <li>Peru starts with a fleet on the north coast of Cali instead of the
south coast.
