  <i>It's January 1999 and the United States of America has been dissolved.</i>
  </div>

  <p>
The country is in ruins and in a state of anarchy except 5 states where new 'Republics' have arisen. Florida, Texas and California maintain some semblance of order within their old borders. In the north-east, New York has formed a union with Pennsylvania and New Jersey to stand together in the coming wars. Chicago, Milwaukee and Minneapolis have done likewise, calling themselves the 'Heartland' of America...

  <i>Canada has split up and may soon be in a state of civil war.</i>
  </div>

  <p>
Meanwhile, the events in the United States have caused Quebec to secede from Canada. Western Canada soon followed suit, under the leadership of British Columbia and joined with American renegades in Alaska. The central Canadian government has fallen and is in disarray...

  <p><div align=center>
  <i>Mexico has been reduced to the states around Mexico city.</i>

  <p><div align=center>
  <i>Cuba and Peru, stronger than ever, are building up their militaries.</i>

  <p>
Taking advantage of the chaos on the North American continent, Cuba invades Jamaica and prepares to spread its influence further abroad, while takes control of Colombia and turns its eyes northwards...

  <i>What will the <b>New World Order</b> look like in North America?</i>

    <h3>Mapping Tools and Other Empire Sites</h3>
  </a>

  <p>
All Empire versions are supported by David Norman's 
  <a href="http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk/mapper.htm" TARGET="mapper">
Mapper for Windows</a>. 

  <p>
Empire4 is now supported by Mapit, thanks to David Hall. He warns though that
you may have to remove the space between "New Yorker" and "British Columbian" 
in the history files you use (that is, use "NewYorker" and "BritishColumbian"
instead). If you don't have Mapit, get it for the correct platform from the
<a href="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/mapsoftware.html">DipPouch's mapping
software page</a>
To get Empire4 support, add the following two files to your Mapit installation:
<ul>
<li><a href="mapit/empire4.inf">Empire4 info file</a>
<li><a href="mapit/empire4.ps">Empire4 PostScript map</a>
</ul>

  <p>
If you are aware of any other mapping tools which support Empire, or any other Empire pages on the web, please let me know.
