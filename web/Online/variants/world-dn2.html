<P>
One of the subjects that seems to come up repeatedly on
rec.games.diplomacy, is whether there is a world variant
available on the judges. There wasn't, so I decided to put
one together. This is the result.
<P>
In addition to the adjacencies displayed on the map, the
following are also adjacent :
<P>
MBL - RIS, MBL - SPO, SEP - SPO, EPA - SPO, EPA - PIS, NEP
- PIS, NEP - CPO, NPO - CPO, NPO - NWP, NPO - BRS, Ala -
BRS, Ala - AOC, BFS - AOC, BAR - AOC.
<p>
In general, this means that it is possible to go from one
side of the map to the other, and from any Northern edge
province - AOC. This is due to the fact that the map should
be drawn on a globe, with SOP and AOC at the two poles.
<p>
The following provinces contain canals : Turkey, Germany,
Scandinavia, Egypt, Central America. These provinces do not
have multiple coasts, and fleets can sail into them from one
sea, and out into another. All other provinces with
multiple coasts can not be passed through by fleets. They
are : Yukon Territory, Quebec, Monterrey, Mexico, Colombia,
British Antartica, France, Balkans, Saudi Arabia, Yakutsk.
<p>
There is one impassable province on the map. The Caspian
Sea. This is not labelled on any map, or listed in the map
file on the judge.
<p>
All powers abbreviate to their initial letter, with the
exception of Oz which is Z (O is Observer). Be aware that
some countries have double-barrelled names, and all of
these use the initial of their first barrel - W for
Western-Canada, F for Frozen-Antartica, etc.
<p>
Build rules are as in Standard. You may only build in home
centres.
<p>
The following shows the adjacencies across the Pacific:
<p>
<blockquote>
Ris |    SPO    | PIS | CPO | NWP | BRS |          AOC
----+--+-----+--+--+--+--+--+-----+--+--+--+-----+
  Mbl  | SEP | EPA | NEP |    NPO    | Ala | BFS |
</blockquote>
<p>
Experience from watching previous variant developments tell
me that if this is going to be a good variant then it will
probably go through at least half a dozen iterations before
it is finalised.
<p>
The variant is loosely based on the world as we know it.
The shape of the land is the same, as are the countries.
However, there is no intent to provide historical accuracy,
so please don't ask questions like why particular provinces
are supply centres when others aren't. The aim is
playability, not accuracy.
<p>
Maps in PS format, and for Mapper and Mapit, are available
from <a href=http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk>http://www.ellought.demon.co.uk</a>
<p>
Changes from World1 to World2:
<ul>
<li>North America has been significantly rearranged in order
to balance it. USA now starts much further South. All
adjacencies are the same, except that DSo is now next to
Nev. Tex is not next to Mid.
<li>Pacific Russia now starts further inland, and the neutral
centre in Oms has moved to WSi. This should weaken Pacific
Russia, and therefore strengthen China, and to a lesser
extent, Russia.
<li>Zam is now an SC, to strengthen South-Africa.
