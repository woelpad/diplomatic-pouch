<P>
<B>1.0 World History</B>
<P>
All organizations and governments such as NATO, OAS, Warsaw Pact, Communist
governments, League of Arab States, NAFTA, EEC, and ASEAN, have broken down
and the thirty-one strongest (economically and militarily) have risen from
the rubble.  However, pieces of the United Nations have survived, but only
in the form of the World Bank, which operates in US dollars.  Only
Dictatorships rule the nations of Earth, and war between the nations is
eminent.  World Diplomacy starts in Winter 2000 as a movement phase only.  

<P>

<B>2.0 Units: </B>
<p>
<B>2.1</B>  Three units are used in this variant: Armies, Fleets, and Militias.
<br>
<B>2.2</B>  Armies and Fleets act in exactly the same manner as those in standard
Diplomacy.
<br>
<B>2.3</B>  Armies and Fleets cost US$3.00 to build.  Militias cost US$6.00 to
build.  All units can only be built in home centers.  If another player's
home center(s) is captured, it automatically becomes the home center of the
player who captured it, and can therefore build in it once it is not
occupied during an adjustments phase.  
<br>
<B>2.4</B> Militias can only Hold, Support, and Move; they cannot attack.  These
are used to fortify provinces because they can support within a province
(i.e. a Militia can sit inside the same province as a Fleet or Army and
support it forcing the attacker to use double support to break it).
Militias are primarily designed for home defense.  No country starts out
with Militias so they must be bought.  
<br>
<B>2.5</B> All units can be disbanded simply by not maintaining them during the
adjustments. No units can be converted to another unit.
<br>
<B>2.6</B> When building units, players must specify which unit is being built,
what numbered province they are building it in as well as the continent
abbreviation.<br>
     Example: You are the United Kingdom.  You want to build a fleet in #23
in Europe.  It       
     should be written this way: build {EP} F 23.  This tells the GM that a
fleet is being         
     built in Europe in number 23.  
<p>
<B>3.0 Special Territories: </B>
<P>
<b>Panama Canal</b> - A province in Central America acting in the same manner as
Kiel and Constantonople in standard Diplomacy.  This province is the only
way to get from the Atlantic to the Pacific Ocean without going over the top
or bottom of the Americas.  
<br>
<b>Hamburg</b> - A province in Germany acting in the same manner as Kiel in
standard Diplomacy.
<br>
<b>Istanbul</b> - A province in Turkey acting in the same manner as Constantonople
in standard Diplomacy.
<br>
<b>Volga Canal</b> - The canal in lower Russia near Rostov acting in the exact
manner as that canal in the Modern variant.
<br>
<b>New York</b> - A province in the United States with a north and south coast.
Players must indicate which coast a fleet will be moving to if one enters
this province.  
<br>
<b>Great Lakes/St. Laurence Seaway</b> - Fleets may travel through these inland
lakes in North American as well as travel down the St. Laurence Seaway by
moving along the adjacent provinces. Mississippi River - Fleets may travel
up and down the Mississippi River from the Gulf of Mexico to Lake Michigan
by moving along the adjacent provinces.  
<br>
<b>Israel</b> - Although this appears to border on the Eastern Mediterranean and
Red Sea, Fleets may only access this province from the Eastern Mediterranean.  
<p>
<B>4.0 Phases: </B>
<p>
<b>4.1</b>  In World Diplomacy, there are four phases: Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter.  
<br>
<b>4.2</b>  Spring and Fall are movement phases only.  Winter and Summer are
adjustments/movement phases only.  
<br>
<b>4.3</b>  Adjustments/movement phases are when maintenance of units, building of
units, and moving existing units.  
<br>
<b>4.4</b>  At the end of the Spring and Fall turns, taxes are collected (see
section 6.0).  
<br>
<b>4.5</b>  At the start of the Winter turn, the GM announces that anything (sea
zones/provinces) touching or above the Arctic circle freezes, so any units
trapped in this area can move during the winter.  Also, any home centers in
this area cannot build units during the winter.  Everything is frozen,
nothing can happen in this area during the winter.  At the start of the
Summer turn, the GM announces that anything (sea zones/provinces) touching
or below the Antarctic circle is frozen.  Any units trapped in this area can
move during the Summer.  Also, any home centers in this area cannot build
units during the Summer.  Everything is frozen, nothing can happen in this
area during the summer.  
<br>
<b>4.6</b> Phases proceed as follows:

<p>
<B>5.0 Winning Conditions: </B>
<p>
<B>5.1</B>  There are eight continents: North America, South America, Antarctica,
Europe, Asia, Africa, Middle East, and Oceana.  
<br>
<B>5.2</B>  There are a set number of countries occupying each continent.  For a
solo win, a country must conquer 7 continents for it to be considered to
have conquered the world.  There may be any combination of continents for a
solo win.  If a draw is to be considered, only surviving players at the time
of the draw may vote.
<p>


<B>6.0 Economics: </B>
<p>
Building units does not hinge on how many supply centers a
player owns.  Instead, in the basic game, money (dollars) has been
incorporated into the game.
<p>
<b>6.1</b>  At the beginning of the game, every country starts out with US$0.00
money.  They cannot do anything except move their units until the first tax
dollars are collected at the end of the Spring turn.  
<br>
<b>6.2</b> Income (in the form of taxes) is collected from your provinces at the
end of the Spring, and Fall turn.  Taxes can be collected from three
different sources.  For every sea zone a country controls at the end of the
Spring or Fall turn, they receive US$1.00.  For every province without a
city a country controls at the end of the Spring or Fall turn, they receive
US$2.00.  For every province with a city a country controls at the end of
the Spring or Fall turn, they receive US$3.00.  
<br>
<b>6.3</b> There are three ways in which to spend your tax money.  The first thing
a player is to do is maintain his/her existing units.  However, if a player
wishes to disband a unit, they should not maintain it, and it will magically
disappear.  Maintenance of units costs US$3.00 for Armies and Fleets, and
US$6.00 for Militias.  Players can also build units.  These two options are
only available during the adjustments/movement phase.  Units can only be
built in home centers.  However if you capture another player's home center,
it then becomes your own.  Only one unit can be built in a home center at
one time.  
<br>
<b>6.4</b> Another use is for bribery.  Players have the option to bribe enemy
units.  First, the briber notifies the GM of which unit of which country
they want to bribe and for how much money.  Bribing starts at US$8.00.  The
player whose unit(s) are being bribed are not told by the GM which unit(s)
are being bribed, nor the price.  That player must guess which unit(s) as
well as what the price is, then make, if they choose, to counterbid.  They
have only one guess.  If the guess is unsuccessful, the bribed unit becomes
apart of the briber's military and the money it was being bribed for is
deposited into the original owner's account.  If the bribe is unsuccessful,
then the briber has the choice of making another, higher bid, or to give up.
If they choose not to give up, then this method continues until the briber
wins or gives up.  
<br>
<b>6.5</b> Another use is to start a rebellion or pacify one.  It costs US$9.00 to
start a rebellion in a province without a city, and US$12.00 to start a
rebellion in a province with a city.  Rebellions last indefinitely and the
province in which a rebellion is happenings does not send tax (i.e. if one
of Zaire's provinces is having a rebellion, that player cannot collect tax
from that province until it is pacified).  Pacifying a rebellion costs
US$15.00. 
<br>
<b>6.6</b> If players do not have enough money to support themselves, and cannot
get money from other players, they can borrow money from the World Bank.
The GM, in US dollars controls the World Bank.  Players may borrow up to a
maximum of US$25.00 at one time.  This money is loaned to the player for
their choice of a 1-year loan at 20%, or a 2-year loan at 50%.
Nevertheless, the money loaned must be paid back.  The World Bank never goes
broke.  
<br>
<b>6.7</b> Players may trade money between themselves, but not military units.
This is a personal transaction, not an official one.  Therefore, it will not
be listed under official transactions in a player's finances sheet with the
results, but the deposit(s) and/or withdrawal(s) will show up under the
player's Savings section.  The GM must know about these transactions.  
<br>
<b>6.8</b> The Basic Game:
<br>
<b>6.9</b> The basic game is less complicated than the advanced in that only one
currency is used worldwide.  This currency is the United States dollar.
There is not need to convert currency or calculate rising or falling values
of currencies. 
<b>6.10</b> The Advanced Game:
<br>
<b>6.11</b> In the advanced game, each country has their own respected currency.
For inter-player transactions, currency conversion is required.  Also, as
countries grow and shrink, the value of their currency goes up and down,
making conversion of currency a little more difficult. 
<br>
<b>6.12</b> Below is a list of the 31 currencies and their values at the beginning
of the game.  At the beginning of the game, all currencies are all
absolutely equal is value.

</table></center>
<br>
<b>6.13</b> Included with the various currencies is a value system.  As a player's
empire grows, the value of their particular currency goes up accordingly.
In contrast, if their empire is shrinking, then their currency goes down
accordingly.  Deciding the value of a currency is decided by the number of
supply centers a player controls.  During the adjustment/movement phase,
players must calculate their current currency value.  To decide this a
simple chart is provided.

<br>
<b>6.14</b> Inter-player currency transactions (i.e. one country lends another
country money) requires currency conversion.  Also, if a player wants to
bribe enemy units or start/pacify rebellions in foreign lands, they must
convert currency.  To calculate currency conversion, follow this formula:
Divide the value of your currency by the other country's currency value,
then multiply it by the number of foreign currency you want.  Example: You
are Turkey.  You need 100 Francs to bribe a few French armies.  Your current
currency value is 37, 210.75 Turkish Lira.  The Franc's value is 0.67.  The
formula would be: 
<br>
100 (multiplied by) 37, 210.75 (divided by) 0.67
<br>
The answer is, you will need 5, 553, 843.28 Turkish Lira to buy 100 Francs
to bribe those French units at the current currency value.  
<p>
<B>7.0 Writing Orders: </B>
<p>
<b>7.1</b> The way the players hand in their orders to the GM, and the way the GM
presents the results of the turn are slightly different.  Players should
disregard the abbreviations on the board and stick with the numbers.  In
doing this, any unit on a province must specify, in the orders, which
continent it is on.  An abbreviation is used in brackets for this: 
{NA} North America, {SA} South America, {EP} Europe, {AF} Africa, {ME}
Middle East, {AS} Asia, {OC} Oceana, {AA} Antarctic.  These are to be posted
in front of every unit that sits in a land province.  Any fleet occupying a
sea zone does not have to do this because the sea zones are marked
separately.  
<br>
<b>7.2</b> Player's orders should be written in the following manner to make things
easier for the GM<br>
Example: You are playing the United Kingdom.  It is Spring 2001.  Players
should write all orders, regardless of the country, in this format.
<pre>
United Kingdom - Spring 2001 - 

UNITS: {EP} F 3 - NWG, {EP} F 6 - IRS, {EP} F 7 - NTH, {EP} F 23 - SoG, {SA}
F 99 - CoA
FINANCES: tax tot=$0.00/A=0/F=5/M=0/offt.=$0.00/total=$0.00
|Maintenance:    none   |
|Builds:         none   |
|Bribes:	 none   |This part is to be included and filled out by players only.
|Rebellions S/P: none   |
|Savings:       $0.00   |
</pre>
"tax tot" is the tax total which each player receives from the GM at the end
of the Spring and Fall turn with the results (see section 6.0).  "A" is the
number of armies a player currently controls.  "F" is the number of fleets a
player currently controls.  "M" is the number of militias a player currently
controls.  "offt." displays the total amount of money spent on official
transactions (builds, maintenance, bribes, rebellions).  "total" is the
total amount of money a player has in their account after everything has
been deducted and added.  Players are not required to fill out the FINANCES.
They are, however, required to fill out the part below it.  Maintenance is
only to be filled out during adjustment/movement phases with the units you
are going to maintain.  Builds are only to be filled out during the
adjustment/movement phase according to the method described in section 2.6.
If a player wishes to bribe an enemy unit(s), they must list the unit number
and continent abbreviation as well as the price it is being bribed for (the
price will not be deducted from the player's account if/until the bribe is
successful).  If a player wishes to start or pacify a rebellion, they must
specify the province number and continent abbreviation.  Savings is the
amount the player calculates after all the above have been completed (this
is cross-checked by the GM and often it is the amount listed in "total"). 
<br>
<b>7.3</b> The results posted by the GM are similar to those the player hands in,
but only lists the UNITS and FINANCES.
