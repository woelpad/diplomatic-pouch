<P>
War in North America is a semi-Historical Diplomacy Variant beginning in 1861.  North America has never had relatively equal powers that make Standard Diplomacy so great.  But by toying with history Will Nesbitt <a href=mailto:will@ralgames.com>will@ralgames.com</a> has come up with a solid scenario for Diplomacy in North America.  The major historical changes are that Texas is still independent, Canada has already Confederated,  and the Indians are an organized nationon the plains. During part of the Civil War, Mexico was an empire, controlled by France. Although California was a state by the end of the War, the Indian threat and the lack of a transcontinental railway made the US hold on the west coast far from certain.

Quirks/Map notes: 
<p>
Boston is in the Union territiory but it is not a controlled Supply Center at the beginning of the game.  It must be conqueored like any other empty Supply Center .  The same goes for Spokane and Kanasas in the Indian territory. This represents the effort required by these nations to mobilize for war.
<p>
The Neutral units are on permanent hold and  must be dislodged in order to take the Supply Centers.  The Neutral Units can be supported by active powers. 
<p>
If ALASKA has not been conquered by a North American power by winter 1867, it will be purchased by the US and will become a US build center.
<p>
The Pacific Ocean borders Alaska, Bering Sea, Panama, the Pacific Coasts and Gulf of Tehauntepec. 
<p>
The Atlantic borders the Davis Strait and Panama. 
  <p>
There is a canal at Panama.  Ships may pass through Panama in the same way that ships pass through Constantinople in standard Diplomacy. 
  <p>
Nicaragua, Guatemala and Mexico City have two coasts (east and west). Florida has one  coast.  Toronto and Montreal have two coasts (north and south).  Philadelphia has two coasts (east and north).

Chesapeake Bay borders Richmond, Philadelphia, the North Atlantic Coast and the South Atlantic Coast. 
  <p>
Upstate borders Toronto.  Fleets must enter Upstate or Toronto (south coast) to move from the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the Great Lakes.
