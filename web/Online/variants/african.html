<b>Note from the Author:</b>
<p>
I designed this game for no other purpose than to give a
break from the usual European struggles. Well, that and I
like creating Diplomacy variants. And I like maps - a lot.
I know there are a few Diplomacy variants set in Africa
that already exist. I have yet to look at them, so I cannot
make any comparisons or judgements. However, examining my
variant, I see that there is great potential to play. Each
power has its strengths and weaknesses, as in regular
Diplomacy. Certain spaces and supply centres are
strategically located between powers, sure to be the sights
of much debate and conflict. Ultimately the game will be
won or lost depending on the alliances made and broken.
That is essentially what any Diplomacy variant requires.
<p>
I am not a historian, but I am an amateur cartographer.
Thus the map is pretty true to Africa as we know it today.
Of course in real life, Ethiopia, Ivory Coast, and Zaire
are hardly major powers, unlike Libya, Saudi Arabia, and
South Africa, and they may never be. I suggest that the
variant takes place in the year 2000. I don't expect things
will change so much in the next ten years, but, if nothing
else, the number is easy to remember.

<b>Map notes</b>
<ul><li>The Suez Canal through Eygpt is like the Kiel canal through Kiel.
<li>Greece borders Turkey but NOT Italy
<li>Mauritania does border Western Sahara Desert
<li>Djibouti does border Addis Ababa, Eritrea, Somalia and GOA
<li>Addis Ababa does NOT border GOA
<li>Tanzania does NOT border Mitumbu Mountains
<li>Mozambique does border Orange Free State
</ul>
<dl><dd>[Note: The following bullet reflects a change made to the
variant in 1992.  The maps at The Diplomatic Pouch maps page
reflect this change.]
</dl>
<ul>
<li>Uganda does *not* border Zambia.  Thus, there is a narrow impassable area
along the border between Mitumba Mountains and Tanzania (where the skinny
part of Uganda now extends south to connect to Zambia) and Uganda then ends
up only bordering Mitumba Mountains, Kisangani, Sudan, Kenya, and Tanzania.
