<P>
This is a global variant set in the mid-19th Century.  It
was designed to provide on-line players with a (hopefully)
fun and challenging global game in a historical setting.
However, this variant was not designed to recreate
historical events.  It merely uses them as a springboard.
<p>
<h3>Rules</h3>
<p>
This variant follows all of the rules in Standard Diplomacy, except the following.
<p>
<b>Start Date</b>
<p>
The game begins in Spring 1861.  The Seasons work just like Standard Diplomacy
(Spring\Fall).
<p>
<b>Victory Conditions</b>
<p>
A short game requires a player to possess 70 supply centers at the end of any
fall retreat.  A long game requires a player to possess 84 supply centers at the
end of any fall retreat.  As an optional rule, the game will also end on Spring
1901 should no player possess the required number of supply centers.
<p>
<b>Occupation of Home Supply Centers</b>
<p>
If a Power occupies an opposing power's Home Supply Center, he may build from it
as if it were his own.  Example:  USA occupies Richmond.  Until another power
occupies Richmond, it is considered a Home Supply Center for the USA.
<p>
<b>Map Clarifications</b>
<p>
Impassable    - (Great Lakes, Rocky Mountains, Andes,
                Switzerland, Sahara Desert, Himalayas)
<p>
<ul>            These zones act exactly like Switzerland in
                Standard Diplomacy.
<p></ul>
<p>
Island Chains - (Hawaiian Islands, Galapagos Islands, Society Islands,
                Bahamas, Virgin Islands, Azores, Cape Verde Islands,
                Falkland Islands, South George Island, Corsica, Crete,
                Seychelles, Maldives, Andaman Islands, Okinawa,
                Carolines, Marshalls, Fiji, and New Zealand)
<p>
<ul>        Island Chains are coastal territories that may be entered through
            any adjacent sea zones.  They may be occupied by either armies or
            navies.  However, they do not act like canals.
<p>
            Examples: A Fleet in the Andaman Islands may move to
            Gulf of Manaar, Bay of Bengal, Andaman Sea, or
            the East Indian Ocean.  A Fleet in Gulf of
            Manaar may convoy an Army to the Andaman Islands.
            However, a Fleet in Gulf of Manaar may not move
            to Andaman Sea.
<p></ul>
Large Island Chains - (Cuba\Haiti and Luzon\Mindanao)
<p>
<ul>         Large Island Chains are essentially two
             coastal provinces surrounded by water and
             attached by a land bridge.  Both Armies and
             Fleets may move from Island to Island.
             However, a Fleet may not move from one Sea
             Zone to another on the opposite side of the
             Large Island Chain.
<p>
             Examples: Luzon is attached to Luzon Strait,
             Philippine Sea, Bismark Sea, and Mindanao.
             An Army may move from Luzon to Mindanao.  A
             Fleet may move from Luzon to Mindanao.  A
             Fleet may move from Luzon to Luzon Strait.
             A Fleet may not move from Bismark Sea to
             Luzon Strait.
<p></ul>
Straits       - (Constantinople)
<p>
<ul>         In order to move a Fleet directly from the
             Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, a player must
             own Constantinople.
<p></ul>
Land Bridge   - (Victoria <-> Vancouver, Victoria <-> Washington,
                Detroit <-> Minnesota, Nova Scotia <-> Quebec,
                Atlanta <-> Bahamas, Bahamas <-> Cuba,
                Cuba <-> Haiti, Hait <-> Virgin Islands,
                Dublin <-> Edinburgh, Gibraltar <-> Morocco,
                Denmark <-> Norway, Denmark <-> Sweden,
                Cypress <-> Angora, Cypress <-> Syria,
                Singapore <-> Malaysia, Luzon <-> Mindanao,
                Kagoshima <-> Edo, Edo <-> Sapporo,
                Sakhurlin <-> Vladivostok)
<p>
<ul>       These land bridges work exactly as they do in
           Colonial Diplomacy.  Though the provinces
           mentioned are separated by water, Both Armies and
           Fleets may move from one to the other.
<p></ul>
Wraparound    - (Bering Sea, Westerlies, West Pacific,
                Equatorial Counter Current,
                South West Pacific, Antarctic Pacific)
<p>
<ul>          You will note that some sea zones can be
              found on both ends of the map.  They are
              actually the same sea zones on both ends of
              the map.  So in effect, a Fleet coming from
              Kuril Sea could move into the Westerlies on
              the right side of the map and be adjacent
              to the Hawaiian Islands on the left side of
              the map.

<h3>1861, A Brief Look</h3>
<p>
The 1860's were the crossroads of the 19th Century.  The
Concert of Europe was beginning to fall to a growing tide of
nationalism.  The Americas were thrown into turmoil with the
formation of the Confederacy.  Asia and Africa had not yet
been carved up between the competing British and French
Empires.  How the great powers of the time reacted set the
course for the 20th Century, leading to the Alliance systems
of the Great War, the Second World War, and the Cold War.
Keep in mind that some of the powers of the 1860's no longer
exist because of how they reacted.
<p>
<b>Britain</b>
<br>
By 1861 the British Empire was the greatest power on the
planet.  Its influence was felt on every continent, but
the British Empire had not yet reached its peak, and its
colonial holdings could just as easily been torn from it
as Spain's had during the 1870's.
<p>
<b>France</b>
<br>
France competed with Britain on virtually every level.
Though it was not as powerful as its sometime rival,
sometime ally, France was still neck and neck with
Britain in its colonial holdings.  France is the only
power in 1861 that can wage war with Britain on an equal
footing.
<p>
<b>Russia</b>
<br>
The Russia of the 1860's had not yet suffered the
crippling events of the Russo-Japanese War and the 1905
Revolution.  Its power spread from Eastern Europe
through Asia and into North America.  Though it
eventually fell to internal conflict, the Russia of the
1860's was still very much a world power.
<p>
<b>Holland</b>
<br>
Though Holland wasn't much of a power on the European
continent, its colonial holdings in the Far East, Africa,
and South America gave it the leverage to compete on
about the same level as France and Russia
<p>
<b>Turkey</b>
<br>
The Turkey of the 1860's stretched from the Balkans to
the Persian Gulf and south into Africa.  Though it was
considered the `Sick Man of Europe', destined for
oblivion in the fires of the Great War, Turkey's central
location and strength could have easily turned it into
one of the world powers of the 20th Century.
<p>
<b>China</b>
<br>
19th Century China was rapidly falling to Western hands.
By the 1860's China had already been forced to open its
ports to foriegn control.  However, Europe had not yet
turned its full attention to Imperial domination of the
Orient.  China still had the chance to regain its
standing amongst the Great Powers.
<p>
<b>Prussia</b>
<br>
Prussia was rapidly reaching its peak by the 1860's.  By
1870, Prussia had unified Germany under its rule,
radically shifting the balance of power in Europe away
from Britain and France.  As Germany, its political and
military strength dictated the policies of both Britain
and France during the latter half of the 19th Century.
<p>
<b>Austria</b>
<br>
One of the great European powers of the 19th Century, it
was destined for economic ruin and political destruction
by the end of the Great War.  However, by 1861, the wars
of unification had not yet happened in Germany and
Italy. Austria still had the capacity of becoming a
great power of the 20th Century.
<p>
<b>Japan</b>
<br>
Its gate forced open just 10 years prior, Japan was
scrambling to `Westernize' itself for survival.
Historically, Japan's standing in the eyes of the world
was cemented by the Russo-Japanese War of 1905.
However, it could have suffered the same fate as China
just as easily.
<p>
<b>USA</b>
<br>
With the Secession of the Confederacy, the United States
was thrown into turmoil, and its future was in no way
secure.  The 1860's was dominated by the bloodiest war
in US history, and though it ended with the defeat of
the Confederacy, it could have ended with the creation
of a new and powerful neighbor in North America.
Regardless of the outcome of the war, the United States
was forever changed.
<p>
<b>CSA</b>
<br>
The Confederacy was struggling for its independance from
the United States during the early 1860's.  Though it was
defeated, the Confederacy had the potential of radically
changing the balance of power in North America and
eventually the world.  If it had survived, it could have
easily become a great power in the 20th Century.
<p>
<b>Mexico</b>
<br>
By the 1860's, Mexico had gone through a series of
revolutions and distasterous wars.  It was on the
decline.  If it had taken advantage of the Civil War,
Mexico might have been able to turn its fortunes around,
eventually reclaiming territories it had lost to the US
in the 1840's.
<p>
<b>Brazil</b>
<br>
One of the few major powers on the South American
continent, Brazil faced few challenges to a possible
expansion.  It would have had the capacity to make its
mark in world affairs, rising to the status of great
power by the 20th Century.
<p>
<h3>Map Notes</h3> 
<p>
Th map for this variant was designed for GM'd PBEM play.  The map should be
viewed in 256 colors, and players trying to read it should do so at a zoom
of 100%-200%, though they can easily make out the state of affairs at a
zoom of 50% or smaller.  Included on the map file are army and fleet icons
designed for use with the game.  Take a look at the map legend in the upper
left hand corner.
