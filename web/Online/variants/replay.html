<P>
This variant is intended to be played with no-press games.  The idea
is that a first turn is used to communicate with other
players, and turns are replayed to allow for an actual movement phase.
<p> 
        In this game, every turn will be played twice.
        Each phase will be run this way:
<ol><li>Players will submit their moves by the deadline.
<li> As soon as orders have processed, the turn is rolled back to before
the moves processed.
<li>Players will then submit a new set of orders.
count on it.
<li>This processing will count and we will move on to the next phase.
</ol>
<p>
        Note that this procedure will hold even for retreat and build phases
for which only one player needs to submit orders.
        Essentially, the first processing of a phase is intended for
communications purposes, as only the second processing has any effect on
the game itself.  (Of course, you don't have to use the first processing
to communicate anything.)
