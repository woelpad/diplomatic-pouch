<b>1.  INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
    Many variants recently proposed and discussed mess with space (by
    contorting the gameboard, etc.); the "Crystal Ball Diplomacy" variant
    messes with TIME!
<p>
<b>1.1 BASIC CONCEPT</b>
<p>
    In Crystal Ball Diplomacy, players must submit orders for each turn before
    they know what really happened on the previous turn.  In other words, the
    results for any given phase are not revealed to the players until after
    they have issued unchangeable orders for the subsequent phase.
<p>
<b>1.2 EXTENT OF THE VARIANT</b>
<p>
    The delay in the delivery of adjudicated results to the players (mentioned
    above) is the main difference between standard Diplomacy and CBD.
    However, to prevent abuse of the rules by card-carrying fortune-tellers,
    a few other minor changes are introduced into the structure of the game.
    These are described in full in these rules.  Where these rules are silent,
    the standard rules of Diplomacy remain unchanged and in force.
<p>
<b>2.  PHASES OF THE GAME</b>
<p>
    Thinking about Crystal Ball Diplomacy and the sequence in which its world
    unfolds can get confusing.  This section of the rules charts a path
    through that confusion.
<p>
<b>2.1 SEQUENCE OF GAME PHASES</b>
<p>
    The sequence of a game of Crystal Ball Diplomacy is described below.
<p>
    (A) Spring 1901 movement lists are submitted.<br>
    (B) Fall 1901 movement lists are submitted.<br>
    (C) Spring movement is revealed,
		and players enter retreats if necessary.<br>
    (D) Spring movement lists (for the next year) are submitted.<br>
    (F) Fall movement results are revealed, and players enter
		retreats, builds, and removals as necessary.<BR>
    (C) Continue at step C.<br>
<p>
    The above chronology is not precisely accurate.  In fact, a single retreat
    list and a single build list is maintained throughout the game for each
    player, and each player is free AT ANY TIME to modify either or both of
    these two lists of his.  In the above description of the game phases, the
    times at which retreat and build lists are said to be submitted (phases C
    and E) in truth simply indicates the final chance a player can afford
    himself to make changes to these ever-present lists before their next use.
<p>
    The concept of a list and each of the various list types are described in
    greater detail in Section 3 and the Sections thereafter.
<p>
<b>2.2 ADVANCING TO THE NEXT PHASE</b>
<p>
    Keeping in mind (as mentioned in Section 2.1 above) that each player
    maintains a single retreat and build list throughout the game, and knowing
    that remove orders can be defaulted, one can see that it is the movement
    order list which truly drives the game.  For example (using the phase
    schema given in Section 2.1), when all players have submitted their Spring
    movement lists, phase E is considered complete, regardless of whether any
    or all players have modified their build or retreat lists, or have
    submitted any remove orders.
<p>
    Another way to describe the sequence of game phases is given below.  Not
    only does this description of the game illustrate that movement order
    lists are the driving force in advancing to the next phase, but it provides
    an easy-to-remember rule for knowing which lists are "due" in each phase.
<p>
    (A) Submit your Spring 1901 orders.<br>
    (B) Start creating diplomatic relationships.<br>
    (C) Submit everything up to and including the next unsubmitted MOVEMENT
         phase.<br>
    (D) Find out what the world will look like when the MOVEMENT orders you
         just submitted are eventually processed.<br>
    (E) Repeat steps C and D until the game ends.<br>
<p>
<b>3.  ORDER LISTS</b>
<p>
    You may notice that in the description of the game phases given in Section
    2, the words "movement lists," "retreat lists," "build lists," and "remove
    lists" were used in place of "movement orders", "retreat orders", and
    "adjustment orders."  There is a very good reason for this, and this
    section explores that reason.
<p>
<b>3.1 CONCEPT OF A LIST</b>
<p>
    Orders for each phase in Crystal Ball Diplomacy are submitted in "lists."
    Some or all of the orders in a list may be void, invalid, illegal,
    impossible, or even ignored by the adjudicator when they are processed,
    but none of this is made known to the player until the results of the
    adjudication for that phase are revealed to all players.  There are four
    types of lists:  movement, retreat, build, and remove.  Each of these is
    sufficiently unique to demand a separate explanation, which will be
    undertaken in sections 4 through 7.  This remainder of this Section covers
    the aspects of a list common to all types.
 <p>
<b>3.2 SUBMISSION OF LISTS</b>
<p>
    Because more than one list may be submitted during any given phase, the
    player must designate each order list by preceding it with its type.
    The words "Movement list," "Retreat list," "Build list," or "Remove list"
    (or similar language) must appear at the head of each list.  For
    movement order lists, not only must the list be headed by the words
    "Movement list," but the phase (season and year, e.g. "Spring, 1904")
    must also be specified.
<p>
<b>3.3 LIST REPLACEMENT</b>
<p>
    Whenever a player submits a list (of any type), it COMPLETELY REPLACES
    any current list of that type.  In other words, a list may not be amended
    or modified; the entire list must be written anew and submitted -- no
    orders from any pre-existing list of that type will be retained.  In the
    case of movement order lists, this rule only permits replacement of any
    pre-existing list for the same season and year specified by the new list.
<p>
<b>3.4 FULL LISTS ALWAYS REVEALED</b>
<p>
    When adjudicated results are revealed to the players, the full contents
    of every list submitted for the adjudicated phases are revealed to all
    players, with each order annotated either as described in these rules (for
    Crystal Ball specific annotations) or according to standard Diplomacy
    rules (indicating bounces, cut supports, dislodgements, and disrupted
    convoys).  Additionally, all unordered HOLDs, all unordered retreats, and
    all unordered removes (see the Sections below describing each list type)
    are always reported to all players.
<p>
<b>4.  MOVEMENT LISTS</b>
<p>
    The movement order list is the most important type of order list.  In
    theory, one could play an entire game of Crystal Ball Diplomacy without
    ever submitting a single build, retreat, or remove list.  Not so with
    the movement list.  A movement list must be received from each player
    in order to advance the game to the next phase.
<p>
<b>4.1 ORDER FORMAT</b>
<p>
    Each order in a movement order list must contain the type of unit (Army
    or Fleet) being ordered, followed by the province or body of water in
    which the player imagines it to be situated when the list will be
    processed, followed by the order to be given to that unit.  Additionally,
    the type (Army or Fleet) of any unit receiving support must be explicitly
    specified in the order given to the supporting unit.  Any order not
    meeting these criteria is considered illegal and "VOID" (see Section 4.3).
    Orders given to fleets moving to multi-coast provinces from an area
    accessible to both coasts must specify the destination coast, or it will
    be deemed "VOID".  Nationality of units to be supported or convoyed may
    NOT be specified.
<p>
<b>4.2 CONVOY MOVEMENT ORDERS</b>
<p>
    The rule for constructing convoy orders in Crystal Ball Diplomacy is a mix
    between the rule used in the face-to-face game and that used in electronic
    mail Diplomacy.
<p>
    A player may order a convoying army by specifying only the army's starting
    location and its final destination (as with any other movement order).
    The location of the fleet or set of fleets to be used need not be
    specified.  Notice that this construction permits an army to be convoyed
    unexpectedly due to an order given to a foreign fleet, and allows for
    multiple routes to be established, the disruption of any one of which will
    keep the army in place.
<p>
    Alternatively, the player may specify an explicit convoy route, listing
    the fleet(s) to be used within the order given to the convoying army.  If
    he does so, the route specified must be complete (or the army will HOLD),
    and will be followed to the exclusion of any and all other available
    routes.
<p>
<b>4.3 CONSIDERED AND IGNORED ORDERS</b>
<p>
    A movement order list may contain as many orders as the player wishes to
    issue, but only a certain number of them (from the top of the list down)
    will be "considered."  The number of orders which will be "considered" is
    the same for all players; it is the number of supply centers controlled
    by the strongest power on the board at the time the lists are processed.
<p>
    For example, if England controls 7 supply centers, and no other power
    controls more than 7, then the FIRST 7 orders in each player's movement
    list will be considered.  The eighth and subsequent orders in each list
    (if any) will be marked "IGNORED."
<p>
<b>4.4 VOID ORDERS</b>
<p>
    Some or all of the considered (i.e., non-IGNORED) orders in the list
    may be marked "VOID".  The following five types of orders will be marked
    VOID:  support for a non-existant attack, support for a non-existant unit
    to hold in place, convoying a non-existant army, an attempt to convoy
    using a non-existant fleet, or any impossible move.
<p>
    Any existing unit whose order is marked "VOID" will HOLD during the
    movement phase for which they received the VOID order.  If the VOID
    order was an attempt to move (either to a non-adjacent location or via
    a non-existant convoy route), the unit may not receive support in holding.
<p>
<b>4.5 NO SUCH UNIT ORDERS</b>
<p>
    Considered orders which are issued for units that do not exist will be
    marked "NO SUCH UNIT" and such orders have no effect other than the use
    of an order in the total number of considered orders for that player.
<p>
<b>4.6 CONTRADICTED ORDERS</b>
<p>
    If two or more dissimilar orders are given for the same (existing) unit,
    and if any two of these are "considered" (that is, not IGNORED), then all
    considered orders given to that unit are marked "CONTRADICTED", and the
    unit will HOLD and may receive support.
<p>
<b>4.7 UNITS NOT ORDERED</b>
<p>
    As in standard Diplomacy, any units left unordered in a movement phase
    will hold and may be supported.
<p>
<b>4.8 ADJUDICATION</b>
<p>
    Other than the above, movement orders are adjudicated as in standard
    Diplomacy.
<p>
<b>5.  RETREAT LISTS</b>
<p>
    Retreat lists share many of the same characteristics as movement lists,
    with a few important differences.
<p>
<b>5.1 SINGLE LIST</b>
<p>
    As mentioned earlier, a single retreat list is maintained throughout the
    game for each player.  This list will be used repeatedly at each retreat
    phase, and may be replaced by a new retreat list at any time.  The player
    may issue an empty retreat list (that is, one containing no orders).
<p>
<b>5.2 ORDER FORMAT</b>
<p>
    A retreat move need not contain the type of unit (Army or Fleet) which
    is being retreated.  It need only specify the location to be retreated
    from, and the location to be retreated to.  If the unit type IS specified,
    it is adhered to.
<p>
<b>5.3 CONSIDERED AND IGNORED RETREATS</b>
<p>
    The rule specified in Section 4.3 regarding how many orders are
    considered, and therefore which (if any) are ignored, is enforced for
    retreat lists as with movement lists.
<p>
<b>5.4 VOID RETREATS</b>
<p>
    All considered retreat orders given to dislodged units, but which specify
    an invalid location for the retreat (non-adjacent area, source province of
    the unit's attacker, an occupied area, an area vacant due to bounce,
    retreats of an army to a body or water, or a fleet to an inland province)
    are marked "VOID", and have no effect other than the use of one of the
    player's considered orders.
<p>
<b>5.5 UNUSED RETREATS</b>
<p>
    All considered retreat orders other than those given to units which were
    not dislodged during the previous phase are marked "UNUSED", and have no
    effect other than the use of one of the player's considered orders.
<p>
<b>5.6 CONTRADICTED RETREATS</b>
<p>
    Unlike in a movement list (see Section 4.6), there is no proscription
    against issuing a unit multiple retreat orders.  The topmost considered
    non-VOID retreat order for any given unit will be followed (see, however,
    Section 5.7), and any subsequent considered non-VOID retreat orders given
    to that unit will be marked "UNUSED".
<p>
<b>5.7 CONFLICTING RETREATS</b>
<p>
    If two units receive valid orders to retreat to the same area, both will
    disband, and the orders in question will be marked "DISBANDS DUE TO
    CONFLICT" to indicate this.
<p>
<b>5.8 UNORDERED RETREATS</b>
<p>
    After all ordered retreats are processed, any dislodged unit for which NO
    order at all was received will retreat to the one and only available
    place, if such a unique place exists, or, if no such place exists, will
    disband.
<p>
<b>6.  BUILD LISTS</b>
<p>
    Build lists are the easiest and least confusing of the four list types,
    they provide a welcome respite before discussing remove lists.
<p>
<b>6.1 SINGLE LIST</b>
<p>
    As with the retreat list, each player has a single build list which gets
    re-used at each build phase.  The player may replace this list at any
    time.
<p>
<b>6.2 INITIAL LIST</b>
<p>
    When the game begins, the units "built in Winter 1900" (that is, those
    comprising the starting position for each player) are listed in ascending
    alphabetical order by province name in which they were built, and this
    forms the initial build list for each player.
<p>
<b>6.3 ORDER FORMAT</b>
<p>
    A build order must specify the type of unit (Army, Fleet) and the location
    where it is to be built.  If building a fleet in St. Petersburg, the coast
    must be specified.
<p>
<b>6.4 WAIVED BUILDS</b>
<p>
    The word "WAIVE" may appear in a build order list any number of times.
    Additionally, any impossible build (for example an order to build a
    fleet in Moscow or a unit in a neutral center) will be considered to be
    WAIVEd build orders, and will be marked as such.  See Section 6.6 for
    the effect of "WAIVE" orders.
<p>
<b>6.5 VOID BUILDS</b>
<p>
    Orders to build in invalid locations (home supply centers either not
    controlled by the power, or occupied at the time of the build) are
    marked "VOID" and have no effect.
<p>
<b>6.6 NO MORE BUILDS</b>
<p>
    All non-VOID build orders (including WAIVEs) are executed from the top of
    the list down until the total of the player's units plus the number of the
    player's executed WAIVE orders matches the number of supply centers
    controlled by that player.  Any other orders in his build list are then
    marked "NO MORE BUILDS" and have no effect.
<p>
<b>6.7 EXHAUSTED BUILDS</b>
<p>
    If a player's build list is exhausted and the player is still eligible to
    build units, these remaining builds are WAIVEd.
<p>
<b>7.  REMOVE LISTS</b>
<p>
    Removal lists are the most confusing of the list types.
<p>
<b>7.1 TEMPORARY LIST</b>
<p>
    Unlike build and retreat lists, remove lists are not perennial in nature.
    Like movement order lists, removal lists are forgotten after completion
    of the phase for which they were submitted.
<p>
<b>7.2 ORDER FORMAT</b>
<p>
    Each remove order must specify the type (Army, Fleet) and location of a
    unit which will be removed if the player is forced to make removals during
    the next adjustment phase.  Because the player is unaware, when issuing
    remove orders, of the results of Fall movement and retreats, units to be
    removed are specified in the list in terms of their positions after the
    Spring retreats, which is the latest data available to the player.
<p>
    Though the units specified might be in different locations after the Fall
    retreat phase, it will be these same units which will be removed if
    necessary.
<p>
<b>7.3 INVALID REMOVES</b>
<p>
    If a remove order specifies a non-existant unit, the order is marked
    "INVALID" and has no effect.
<p>
<b>7.4 UNNECESSARY REMOVES</b>
<p>
    Only as many removes as are forced will be used from a remove list (top-
    down).  All other valid remove orders in the list will be marked
    "UNNECESSARY" and will have no effect.
<p>
<b>7.5 UNORDERED REMOVES</b>
<p>
    If, after all remove lists have been processed, any player must still
    remove units, these are removed as in the order specified in the standard
    Diplomacy rules for removals performed for powers in Civil Disorder.
