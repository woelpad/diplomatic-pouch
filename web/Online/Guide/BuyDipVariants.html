<b>Finding new editions of Diplomacy variants</b>
<p>
Since Hasbro has not re-released Colonial Diplomacy or Machiavelli, these
two games are now out of print.  I don't 
know of anywhere that still sells Machiavelli new.  
There are still a few places that are
selling Colonial Diplomacy new.  However, this list has gone from 9 in
my last update of the Guide to 4 now, so these are selling out.  Since
supplies are diminishing and shipping costs vary, I'm including all
the places I know of that still sell Colonial Diplomacy.
<p>
In addition to those Avalon Hill games, three new commercial versions
of Diplomacy variants
have been released for the first time in 2000: Ard-Ri, Classical Diplomacy
and Hundred.  These are now available for sale online as well.

You can also sometimes copies of Diplomacy variants up for auction on Ebay.
Ebay frequently lists copies of Colonial Diplomacy 
for sale, sometimes new and sometimes used.  Machiavelli comes up less
frequently and generally runs pretty high prices used.
