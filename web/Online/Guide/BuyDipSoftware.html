any new information or to update information that is out of date.

<p>
As a caveat, the MicroProse computer version of Diplomacy has not
received the greatest of reviews from the media or from users.  You
might want to check past discussions on rec.games.diplomacy (e.g. at <a
href=http://groups.google.com/>groups.google.com</a>) for opinions.  
<p>
Diplomacy is now officially out of print, having ceased production less than
a year after its release.  Because of it's lack of success, it is available
relatively inexpensively right now.  
In fact, it's available for "free" at <a href=http://www.free-cdsoftware.com/SKU-DIPLOM?client=96019141>free-cdsoftware.com</a>.  The word free is in quotes
because this is one of those sites that gives away free software and makes 
their profit on shipping and handling charges, which is $7.50 per item.  Still,
a price $7.50 shipped is not bad considering that the original retail price
was $39.99.
<p>
In the past I also received a number of reports of Diplomacy being on sale in
clearance bins at various stores.  These reports are somewhat outdated by now,
but if you want to take a look, WalMart had it for varying prices under $10.
I also heard reports that it was available in several KB chain stores (KB
Toys, KB Toyworks) for $4.00 (check the clearance or software clearance
section if they have one).
<p>
As for buying it online, the game was available at CompuExpert.com for $9.90 for quite a while, but it seems finally to have sold out.  It can still be 
found at various online merchants, but mainly still at or near list price,
which is not really worth it.  Your best bet for buying it online would be
Ebay, where plenty of copies are available at any given time.  You shouldn't
have to pay more than $10 for a new copy.  If you wait a bit, you can also
find the occasional used copy, which sell for even less.

<b>Buying the MicroProse computer
version of Diplomacy outside the U.S.</b>
<p>
In searching around the web, I came across
a number of online stores in the UK and Germany 
which are now shipping the game. I presume they will ship internationally at least within the European Union if not everywhere, though I haven't inquired to confirm this.
<p>
As a more recent update, it appears that Microprose Diplomacy in the UK has
followed the sales pattern it had un the US in at least some of the UK
retailers.  I have gotten updates from two different people letting me know it was available at clearance price in stores, one of which was an Electronics Boutique where the game was selling for 4 Pounds Sterling.  The GAME store chain sells the game for 4.99 Pounds Sterling, and Diplomacy is also available online at that price at their web site <a href=http://www.game.uk.com>www.game.uk.com</a>.
<p>
In addition to trying any of the places listed below, you might also take a look at Ebay.  There are
currently plenty of copies for sale there, most of which sell for $10-$15.
You'll have to make sure that a given seller will ship outside of the U.S. since not all of them do, but many sellers will.

Note that all the shops listed below are Amazon.com zShops (which let individuals set up web-based stores), and may not be established businesses with a long history.   Be sure to check the pages for the vendor's rating which rates the seller from zero to five stars (click on the stars to see the actual comments left by customers).  Once again prices do not include shipping so be sure to
do comparison shopping.
