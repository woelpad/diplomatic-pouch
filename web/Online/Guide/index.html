<p>
If you are in the market for the game of Diplomacy, read on.  
Although this initially started out as a one-time article in the Zine,
a couple of followup requests from people as well as continued inquiries 
on rec.games.diplomacy have prompted me to try to maintain this guide on
an ongoing basis.<p>
The Diplomacy Buyer's Guide is divided up into the following three
sections:
<p>
<ul>
<li><a href=BuyDipBoardNew.html><b>Where to buy new editions of the Diplomacy boardgame</a></b><br>
Information on buying new copies of Diplomacy editions (in and out of print).
<li><a href=BuyDipVariants.html><b>Where to buy new editions of Diplomacy variants</a></b><br>
Information on buying new copies of Diplomacy variants (in and out of print).
<li><a href=BuyDipBoardUsed.html><b>Where to buy various used editions of Diplomacy and its variants</A></b><br>
Discusses buying used editions of Diplomacy on online auctions.
<li><a href=BuyDipSoftware.html><b>Where to buy the MicroProse computer
version of Diplomacy</a></b><br>
Information on finding good deals on the MicroProse computer
version of Diplomacy (and software in general) in the U.S., as well as information about where to buy the MicroProse computer
version of Diplomacy outside the U.S. which some people have
had trouble finding.
</ul>
<p>

Hope you find this information useful.  Happy shopping!
