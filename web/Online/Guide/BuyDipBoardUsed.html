I found a couple of small online shops that sold copies of Diplomacy games
used, but none that were great bargains.  Because of that, and because
none had more than one copy in stock (meaning that any listing I gave
would be useless as soon as one person bought that item), I haven't included
those stores here.  
<p>
The best recommendation I can make for buying copies of the game used is
to buy them at an online auction.  The advantages of buying on auction
is that if you are willing to accept a used copy of the game, you can
generally (though not always) get a better deal than buying new.  The
other advantage is that if you are interested in specific versions of
the game, you will rarely be able to find them except for used, and the
easiest way to find them is on auction.
<p>
While <a href=http://auctions.amazon.com/>Amazon.com</a>, <a
href=http://auctions.yahoo.com/>Yahoo!</a>, and <a
href=http://auctions.msn.com/>MSN</a> all have online auctions, I've never
seen the Diplomacy boardgame listed at any site other than Ebay so that's
the one I am recommending (though it can't hurt to check the others).
<p>
At any given time, Ebay usually has
around a dozen Diplomacy items for sale (sometimes more, sometimes less).

The most common used Diplomacy item on Ebay is the 1976 Avalon Hill edition with
plastic pieces.  In addition to used editions, new ones come up periodically if you are
willing to check back from time to time.  Editions of Avalon Hill 
Diplomacy with wooden pieces come up relatively often, Colonial Diplomacy
comes up for auction frequently, and Deluxe Diplomacy comes up from time
to time as well.  If you check back often, you will come across plenty of
less common editions that come up,
including older (1961 and 1971) editions by Games Research Inc.,
non-U.S. editions by
Waddingtons/House of Games.  Even less common, but still there from time to
time, are U.K. editions of Diplomacy (more and more frequently is Ebay
becomes more popular in the U.K.), copies of Machiavelli, and copies of
the Gamer's
Guide to Diplomacy.  You can even occasionally find unopened copies of these
older versions of Diplomacy, but if you are looking for unopened ones,
it may take a bit of patience before one comes along and depending on
the edition, they can get pricey compared to the used ones..
