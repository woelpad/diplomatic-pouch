<h3>Build your own set</h3>

You used to be able to buy all the parts for Diplomacy individually from 
<a href=http://www.svgames.com/parts-diplomacy.html>this place</a>, but now
they only appear to carry the instruction book. 
<!-- this note as of 3/2004. Eventually it should be removed. -->
<!-- If you want a low-cost version of the Hasbro edition of Diplomacy, you can
put together your own set that includes everything except the box for a lot
less than purchasing the boxed version in stores.  You can order spare parts for the game from <a href=http://www.svgames.com/parts-diplomacy.html>this place</a>. You can order a copy of the gameboard, a pad of 20 conference maps, a full
set of 140 metal units (armies/fleets) and a set of flag markers for, for less than $18 plus shipping.
List price for the boxed set is $45... that's one expensive box! (That
comment is tongue-in-cheek, so don't email me explaining about retail
markups and distribution costs.)
<p>
Somebody reported a problem with the above order page.  You can also order
parts from <a href=http://www.svgames.com/parts-diplomacy.html>this place</a> as an alternate, for about $18 total.

<H3>Finding the Hasbro edition of the Diplomacy board game new</H3>
<p>
Here are a few places that currently have the new Hasbro edition of
Diplomacy for sale.  This is by no means comprehensive, but includes
the lowest-price places I know of.  Prices below do not include shipping,
since shipping varies based on the method of delivery (which the customer
can often select from), as well as the location of the destination.
I'm including multiple sources rather than
just the least expensive ones for several reasons (i.e., the game
may be out of stock in some places, prices may change, not all of them
ship internationally, and depending on where you want the game shipped
to and how quickly you want it shipped, the lowest price after shipping
might not be from the company that has the lowest price for the game alone. 
Because of the number of vendors selling the game for under $40, I am 
no longer listing stores that sell the game for over $40.  <p>

Stores that are listed above are there based on price and not because I
personally endorse them.  I have  made purchases from Amazon.com, 
Enterprise Games, and AreYouGame.com, all without problems.  I'd be happy
to include comments on other peoples' experiences with these companies
(good or bad) so let me know if you have anything to add.
<p>
The Hasbro edition of Diplomacy is available in the U.K. at
<a href=http://www.games-web.co.uk/>GamesWeb</a> for &pound; 39.90.
<p>
In addition to the online stores listed above, there have also been
several different game dealers selling the Hasbro version of Diplomacy
new on auction at <a href=http://www.ebay.com/>Ebay</a>, so you may want
to take a look there as well.  Prices recently have been hovering around $30.
If you do try 
Ebay, be sure to check the item descriptions, not just the item titles, as
most dealers do not specifically mention Hasbro in the item title (since
Hasbro released the game undre the Avalon Hill name).  Look for a photo
of the new red box, or an item description that mentions metal pieces. 
<p>
You can get a list of Diplomacy items on auction at Ebay via
<a
href=http://search.ebay.com/search/search.dll?MfcISAPICommand=GetResult&query=diplomacy&ht=1&category0=220&SortProperty=MetaEndSort>this link</a>.

<h3>Finding the original Avalon Hill edition of the Diplomacy boardgame new</h3>
<p>
There were a couple of places listed here previously that still sold 
original (non-Hasbro) editions of Diplomacy or Deluxe Diplomacy, but
they are both now solpd out and I don't know of any new stores that
still have Diplomacy in stock.  If anyone else does, please let me
know and I'll add them here.  New copies of the original Avalon Hill
Diplomacy still in shrinkwrap occasionally do come up for sale on Ebay,
so use the link above to see what's available there.
<p>
<h3>Finding the Gibsons Games edition of the Diplomacy boardgame new</h3>
<p>
The Gibsons Games (a U.K. game company) edition of Diplomacy is no longer
in print, but copies of it are still available at several places that I
am aware of:
<ul>
<p>
<li><a href=http://www.londontoycompany.co.uk/>London Toy Company</a><br>
&pound; 17.99<br>
They ship internationally.
<p>
<!--
<li><a href=http://www.toysave.co.uk/system/index.html/>Apollo Boardgames</a><br>
&pound; 17.27 via <a href=http://www.toysave.co.uk/pages/main_board5.htm>this link</a><br>
They ship internationally.
<p>-->

<li><a href=http://www.games-web.co.uk/>GamesWeb</a><br>

<p>
Apollo Boardgames in the U.K. was listed here but has been removed because
of a report of a pretty lousy customer experience.  If you want to take your
chances with them, a search engine should turn up the web site.
