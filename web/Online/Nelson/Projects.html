This article, a new breakthrough for egotism, contains a list of my many
ongoing projects.  I work on a great number of documents for the hobby
and I'm sure you'll find something which sparks your interest below.

<H3>Diplomacy AtoZ</h3>
<center>
  <i>"I <b>highly</b> recommend that you read Mark Nelson's `Diplomacy from A to Z'.
<BR>It hooked me on Diplomacy and even more on postal Diplomacy.<Br>It gives you
a very good sense of the history of the hobby."<br>
-- David Kovar, in a post to <tt>rec.games.diplomacy</tt> (3/10/93)</i>
<P>

    This is the definitive dictionary of Diplomacy terminology.  Words found in
	this document fall into four main
categories:
<ol>
<li>Terms which describe the play of the game (names of openings,
strategic concepts, tactical ploys)
<LI>Terms that arise in
its the games adaptation to postal and email play ("Press," "NMR,"
famous press bylines,
GMing practice, scoring and rating systems)
<li>Terms which are
associated with the hobbies that have grown up around the play of postal
Diplomacy (organizations, special projects [mostly never implemented!]) or
<li>Terms uniquely used by hobby members (e.g., variant names).
</OL>

<H3>Variants AtoZ</H3>
   This document starts with an article
("The Chameleon Game" by Steve Doubleday)
   explaining what a variant is.  The remainder of the package
contains reviews of 201 Diplomacy variants.  Some variants have
multiple reviews.
<p>
Version 2.0 of the document is available via anonymous FTP as a compressed tar file

<h3>Stalemates AtoY</h3>
<center><i>
   "I want to make sure you know how much I appreciate the work and dedication
required to tackle a project of such magnitude.  Congratulations on a job well
done.<BR>[I wish our first software releases looked this good!]"<BR>
   -- David Jorgensen (13th April 1994)</i>
   <P>

      While "old hands" find stalemate lines, articles on stalemate lines, and
discussion of stalemate lines to be exceedingly dull and dry, novices are
usually very interested by the concept of a stalemate line.  They are
positively excited by question such as "What are stalemate lines?", "What is a
dynamic stalemate line?", "How do I construct a stalemate line?", "Are there
any stalemate lines holding these centers?" and "How do I break a stalemate
line?"
<p>
   The Stalemates AtoY file contains a collection of articles on stalemate
lines.  Reading this document should not only answer these questions on
stalemate lines, but it should also cure anyone of an interest in
them.  Perhaps the most important question that you should
ask is "How on earth did Mark retype all these articles without falling
asleep in the process?"  Perhaps he enjoyed the pain and agony.
<p>
Version 1.0 of the document contains 18 articles on stalemate lines and
               has been converted to become
			   <a href="../StalematesAtoY">an entry in <b>The Diplomatic Pouch
			   Library</b></a>.
			   It is also available via anonymous FTP as a compressed tar file
(<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/stalemates.tar.Z">ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/stalemates.tar.Z</A>).

<h3>SerCon Central -- Austria</h3>
<p>
   This document is intended to be the "definitive" package of articles answering
the question "I'm playing Austria; what do I do?" There are articles
on Austrian openings, middle-game strategies, and end-game tactics.
You can read endgame statements from games which Austria won to see how
to put it all into practice.  There are miscellaneous articles examining
such things as various Austrian two-way alliances and the importance of
the Austrian Navy.
<p>
   At present the package isn't completed.  There are still one or two
articles which <i>must</i> be added to produce the definitive product I'm
aiming for.  However you can obtain the provisional package via
email by sending an
       appropriately worded request to  me at
<A HREF="mailto:fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk">fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk</A>.
       Each file in the Package (currently 20) will be e-mailed to you as an
       ascii text file.

<h3>Opening Time!</h3>
   The Judge code contains an area where the address of an "Openings Custodian" is
   kept. The
"Openings Custodian" is sent a copy of every Spring 1901 adjudication
(or the equivalent first season in the case of some variants).  Since May 1995,
I have been the Openings Custodian.
<p>
You may obtain details on the individual orders for each
unit and on the particular openings used by each power
in the <b>standard</b> e-mail Diplomacy games played since May 1995 by sending
appropriately worded e-mail to me at
<A HREF="mailto:fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk">fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk</A>.
<p>
At the time of writing there have been sufficient games of any
particular <b>non-standard variant</b> to justify a breakdown of their openings.
You can obtain a list of how many gamestarts there have been
for each variant-type by sending appropriately worded email
to <A HREF="mailto:fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk">fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk</A>

<h3>The UKVB and UKVB Catalogue</h3>
   The UKVB (United Kingdom Variant Bank) is the main
source for variant rules and articles on variants in the UK.
In addition to acting as a source for variant rules, the UKVB
Custodian also produces a variant-only 'zine (<i>Variants & Uncles</i>).
Although this 'zine is primarily distributed by snail mail, some of the articles
run in it are available by anonymous ftp.
<p>
The main source of variant rules, articles, and maps held electronically by
    the UKVB is the anonymous ftp site 
<A HREF="ftp://amsta.leeds.ac.uk">ftp://amsta.leeds.ac.uk</A>
(See more information in the <a href="#a7">Electronic
    Variant Bank</a> section, below).
<p>
    The UKVB also holds a small number of rules and maps in the directory
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/UKVB">ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/UKVB</A>.
	
<p>
The UKVB Catalogue is a listing of variants held by the UKVB.
    It lists variants alphabetically and by ARDA number (the
    ARDA number is an attempt to classify variants by subject matter).
For an ASCII copy of the alphabetical and ARDA catalogues, send
an       appropriately worded email to  me at
<A HREF="mailto:fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk">fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk</A>.
<p>
A hardcopy of the catalog is also available at a cost of one pound.  Remit to
Mark Nelson: 3 Kelso Road, Leeds. LS2 9PR.  UK.
<p>
If you live in the UK and want to subscribe to <i>Variants & Uncles</i>, send
    money to me at this same address.  A typical issue costs 50 pence.
    If you live outside the UK please send e-mail to me for subscription details.

<h3>Electronic Variant Bank</h3>
   The anonymous FTP site 
<A HREF="ftp://amsta.leeds.ac.uk/pub/amt5man">ftp://amsta.leeds.ac.uk/pub/amt5man</A>
 contains a small
selection of variant material (and an even smaller selection of
standard Diplomacy material).
<p>
An index of the contents of this site (possibly up-to-date)
is available from me via e-mail at <A HREF="mailto:fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk">fuemin@sun.leeds.ac.uk</A>.

<h3>Interviews</h3>
   Extensive interviews with three "snail-mail" personalities
are available as compressed tar files by anonymous FTP. Larry Peery and
Fred C. Davis, Jr.
are Americans.  Andrew England is an Australian. The files containing
the interviews are
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/peery.tar.Z">ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/peery.tar.Z</A>,
