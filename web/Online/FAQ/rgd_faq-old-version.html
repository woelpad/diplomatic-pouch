This FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) will be posted to rec.games.diplomacy
and news.answers once every week. The latest version is also available
on the web, at <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/FAQ">
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/FAQ</A>.<p>

Many FAQs are available on the archive site rtfm.mit.edu
in the directory /pub/usenet/news.answers. The name under which a FAQ is
archived appears in the Archive-name line at the top of the article. This
FAQ will be archived as rec.games.diplomacy/rec.games.diplomacy.FAQ.<p>

There's a mail server on that machine. You send an E-mail to 
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu, with the word 'help' in the body of the
message.<p>

The FAQ will also be available via FTP from several other ftp servers
and Web-sites. Look at the Online resources section for addresses to
the most commonly used ftp servers for Diplomacy resources.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "who">Who made this FAQ?</a></h3><p>
    
A lot of people contributed towards the creation of this FAQ. Too many
for a poor FAQ maintainer to list them all here, or even remember them
all. Even though they all deserve both to be listed, and to be remembered.<p>

This version of the FAQ was created by a committee of people from r.g.d. A complete
list of committee members will appear here soon. Thanks should also go to Pitt Crandlemire
and Bjoern Tore Sund, who did the initial work on this version of the FAQ, and to
Sean Starkey, who wrote the original r.g.d. FAQ.<p>

If you have any comments, updates, error reports et al on the current version
of the FAQ, please send them to David Norman, <a href="mailto:david@ellought.demon.co.uk">
david@ellought.demon.co.uk</a>. Please note however that this is still a Beta Version
of the FAQ, and so there is no need to report the really obvious problems - missing answers,
notes of work to be done, etc.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "newsgroup">Is there a newsgroup on the topic of Diplomacy?</a></h3><p>
       The rec.games.diplomacy newsgroup, and its mailing list 
mirror, dipl-l@diplom.org are unmoderated, open discussion fora.  People 
discuss strategy, ask questions about difficult adjudications, relate 
interesting anecdotes, and often advertise available positions in 
games.  It is recommended that you read this FAQ through before making 
your first posting to the newsgroup, since there is a good chance that 
if your question is basic, it will be covered here.<p>
     
       The newsgroup is not moderated in any way, and nobody is 
responsible for keeping people in line. However, off-topic postings, 
excessive or redundant postings, commercial announcement (spams), 
flames, and trolls (flame-bait) are not acceptable to most 
subscribers.<p>
     
       In particular, if you wish to make a game opening 
announcement, please use the keyword "Opening:" at the beginning of 
the subject line of your article.  Other information about the game 
(game name, variant type, power available, number of centres, and 
which judge (if any)) would also be very helpful in the subject line 
or the body of the email.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "posting">What should I know before posting to rec.games.diplomacy?</a></h3><p>
        When posting to rec.games.diplomacy (or any newsgroup, for
that matter) there are certain rules of "netiquette" that you should
follow.  While the rules are informal and often unstated,  you are
still expected to follow them, and the rules are enforced, in an
informal way.<p>

          If you are unfamiliar with basic netiquette, there are
several good guides available online.  One good one is "The Net:  User
Guidelines and Netiquette" which can be found at <a
href="http://www.fau.edu/rinaldi/net/index.htm">http://www.fau.edu/rinaldi/net/index.htm</a>
by <cite>Arlene H. Rinaldi</cite>.  This
work has sections on all aspects of the Internet including posting to
Usenet.  There are also links to Dutch, Finnish, French, German,
Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Romanian, Spanish, Swedish,
and Turkish translations.  Another netquette guide that covers all of
the basics is Dark Mountain's Netiquette Guide, which can be found at <a
href="http://www.darkmountain.com/netiquette/index.shtml">http://www.darkmountain.com/netiquette/index.shtml</a>.<p>


Whether you have a need to read the above guides or you are a polite
netizen who has been through all of this before, please take a moment
to review the following list of rules that especially apply to
rec.games.diplomacy:<p>

<ul><li>Do not post messages advertising commercial products, unless 
the forum is designed for such purposes. One exception is for directly 
relevant commercial ventures (i.e. Diplomacy stuff), which are
generally allowed a single post announcing their availability. 

<li>Do not forward chain letters of any sort, including messages 
on viruses and other "important" matters. 99 % of such messages are
hoaxes, and people will find out about the rest anyway. 

<li>Remember that the Internet is international, and that people 
of all faiths and convictions participate. Try not to cause offense,
by being polite and using common courtesy in your words and tone.
Remember that sarcasm, for example, is VERY hard to convey via text 
alone.

<li>Basically, don't be a jerk! 
</ul>
    <h3><li><a name = "homepage">Is there a Diplomacy home page?</a></h3><p>

            Yes.  The Diplomacy home page is hosted by The Diplomatic Pouch, 
     an electronic magazine and superb resource for on-line Diplomacy information.
     It can be found at <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/</A><p>
     
     For newcomers to Diplomacy, however, you might find it more informative to start 
     on the welcome page, 
     <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Welcome.html">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Welcome.html</A>.<p>
     
     This will give you a brief introduction to the game, the community of 
     players that has developed around it (a.k.a., The Hobby), and the 
     Diplomatic Pouch itself.<p>

<h3><li><a name = "intro">Introduction to Diplomacy</a></h3><p>
<ol>
    <h3><li><a name = "what">What is Diplomacy?</a></h3><p>

          Diplomacy is a game of strategy and intrigue for seven players, 
where random chance plays no role.  Luck remains crucial (can I outguess my 
opponent?), but the game uses no dice, no cards, and no drawing of lots 
beyond the distribution of who is to play what power.  From there on, it is 
you versus the other players, with tactics, strategy, cunning, negotiation 
and persuasion your primary tools for winning the game.<p>

          In Diplomacy, each player controls one of the seven major powers 
at the start of the twentieth century: Austria-Hungary, England, France, 
Germany, Italy, Russia, or Turkey. No one player has sufficient power to 
win alone, and yet cooperation is rife with risk, since nothing a player 
says during negotiations is binding.  By negotiating alliances and treaties 
with the other players, each player seeks control over Europe, balancing 
trust and suspicion, loyalty and ruthless backstabs.  This intrigue and 
blend of strategy and tactics has made Diplomacy a beloved game since it 
was first published by Allan Calhamer in 1958.<p>

          Almost since the game was introduced, Diplomacy has been played 
by people communicating, negotiating, and sending orders via postal 
services. This form of play spread far, and there are still a large number 
of fanzines dedicated to this form of play.  Internet Diplomacy, played 
much in the same way as Play By Mail (PBM) (only much faster and more flexibly) 
was a natural continuation of this, when it was introduced in the late 
eighties. Today, Play By Email (PBEM) is a Diplomacy cultural subgroup in its own 
right, with its own traditions and codes of conduct.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "make">Who makes Diplomacy?</a></h3><p>

The Avalon Hill Game Company, who make Diplomacy, have recently been
bought out by Hasbro.  Following this buyout, it is not clear if Diplomacy
will continue to be available, either as a complete set, or as separate
components.  Any good game or hobby store should be willing to contact
Hasbro and try to order the game for you.<p>

Players outside North America should be able to order Diplomacy from the
following sources:<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "variant">What are Diplomacy variants?</a></h3><p>

          Diplomacy basically consists of a simple set of rules for 
adjudicating moves and a map on which to play.  By changing either or both 
of these basic elements, fans have created Diplomacy variants.  The most 
common variants use the original rules of Diplomacy, but play on a map from 
a different time or place.  A variant can be as simple as the Fleet_Rome 
variant, which merely changes the army in Rome at the game's start to a 
fleet, or extremely complex like those set in Tolkein's Middle Earth with 
special units, unusual maps, and new rules and added game elements.<p>

          The Diplomatic Pouch's variants page has rules for and articles   
          for an ever-increasing number of variants. It can be found at
          <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/variants.html">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/variants.html</A>.<p>

          The Variants A to Z is a great resource with in-depth descriptions    
          and reviews collected over several decades. It can be found at
          <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/VariantsAtoZ/var-intro.html">
          http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/VariantsAtoZ/var-intro.html</A>
          It is also available by ftp from
          <A HREF="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/variants.tar.Z">
          ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Documents/variants.tar.Z</A>.<p>

One of the beauties of Diplomacy is how easily its framework can be 
extended and manipulated without losing the core essence.  Thus many 
players enjoy playing standard games along with a variety of new variants 
to combine the classic game with new twists and changes of pace.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "maps">How can I get electronic versions of Diplomacy maps?</a></h3><p>

The Diplomatic Pouch maps page
(<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/maps.html">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/maps.html</A>) 
has hundreds of electronic versions
of maps for a large number of Diplomacy variants.  All maps are
available in a graphical browser-viewable format (usually GIF,
occasionally JPEG), many are available postscript, and a bunch of
them come in other formats as well.  For people without web access, a
smaller selection of maps is also available via FTP from the Caltech
Diplomacy Archive (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Maps/">ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/Maps/</A>)
and Nick Fitzpatrick's FTP site (<A HREF="ftp://ftp.sentex.ca/usr/nick/Maps/">ftp://ftp.sentex.ca/usr/nick/Maps/</A>). 

    <h3><li><a name = "rules">Are the rules available online?</a></h3><p>

   The rules for Diplomacy can <em>NOT</em> be found online. Avalon Hill, who holds
the copyright on the rules, has absolutely forbidden this.  Because Avalon
Hill has given a large number of concessions to the Diplomacy community
online, the consensus is to respect their wishes.  <em>DO NOT</em> post a copy of
the rules online anywhere.  Doing so may jeopardize the Internet Diplomacy
community.<p>

   When Avalon Hill were making Diplomacy, it was possible to buy the rules separately
   from the game. However, with Hasbro taking over AH, this is not currently possible,
   and it is not clear if it will be available in the future.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "where">Where can I get Diplomacy, or the Diplomacy rules?</a></h3><p>

   Please see this FAQ answer <a href = "#rules">2.5. Are the rules

    <h3><li><a name = "numbers">What are Boardman and Miller numbers?</a></h3><p>

In the postal (ie, paper, ink and postage stamps) hobby, standard
(non-variant) Diplomacy games are given a unique Boardman Number at
the start of the game, consisting of the year the game was started
and a letter combination (e.g. 1998AC). These numbers are assigned
by a group of Boardman Number Custodians who are assigned blocks of
numbers they can give out to avoid duplicate numbers. The system is
named after John Boardman, who gave out the first number, to the very
first postal game, in 1963.<p>

Miller Numbers are similar to Boardman
Numbers, except that they are given to variant games (including
gunboat).  Miller Numbers are longer since they also contain a four
or five character code which identifies the variant (e.g. 1998ABCrb41).<p>

There is now an Internet Boardman and Miller Number custodian (Nick
Fitzpatrick, nfitz@sentex.ca) who assigns numbers to all PBEM Diplomacy
games he finds out about.  PBEM Judges automatically notify him of
gamestarts, and anyone who is running a non-Judge PBEM game and would
like to have a number assigned to their game is welcome to  notify him
as well.  A longer explanation of Boardman and Miller numbers can be
found in an article on the topic
(<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/S1997M/Fitzpatrick/Numbers.html">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/S1997M/Fitzpatrick/Numbers.html</A>)

    <h3><li><a name = "practice">How can I learn strategy and improve my game?</a></h3><p>

The undisputed best way to learn strategy and improve your game is
through practice. A next-best way is to participate in games as an
observer, preferably one you know has skilled players in it, and
carefully follow the game.  Watch what people do and try to extract
a reasonable explanation for why they might do that (though don't make
the mistake of expecting that players always make the best move --
players make mistakes or make gambles that don't pay off).  One can
also learn a lot from reading well-written end-of-game (EOG)
statements, but well written ones (or any written ones at all) are
not always available.<p>

It is recommended that the basics of tactics are learned first, since
they are fairly simple and quickly mastered. Following that, it is
often useful to read some of the many articles written on strategy.
Over 100 of them are available at The Diplomatic Pouch Strategy Page
(<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/strategy.html">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/strategy.html</A>).  While reading
articles can introduce you to new ideas, it really is no substitute
for practice and experience.<p>
</ol>
<h3><li><a name = "rulesq">Diplomacy Rule Questions</a></h3><p>
<ol>
    <h3><li><a name = "dislodge">Can I dislodge my own unit?</a></h3><p>

No. A unit ordered to move to a space occupied by another unit of the
same country may not succeed if the second unit fails to vacate the
space. This holds true even if the unit moving to the space has enough
support (from one of your units, or indeed from a foreign unit) to
dislodge the unit that failed to move. You may not dislodge your own
units. Further, if you are supporting an attack on a space occupied by one of
your own units, that support is not valid for dislodging your unit
there, but may be valid for standing off other equally well or less well
supported attacks. This may result in your unit there holding under the
Beleaguered Garrison rule.<p>

The one exception to this rule is in a Duplex Variant game, where each player
controls multiple countries. With respect to self-dislodgement, each
power is treated separately, even when controlled by the same player.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "retreat">What happens if two units retreat to the same location?</a></h3><p>

If two units retreat to the same location both units are disbanded and
removed from the board (assuming, of course, the retreat order was a
legal order for both units).<p>

This situation is not an infrequent
occurrence.  Two or more units might be ordered to retreat to the
same province for several reasons: there may be no alternative
province to retreat to; there may be alternatives available but both
powers may retreat to the same province hoping the other power won't
do so; the retreat and disband is done intentionally to guarantee
that another power will not end up in a strategically important space.
In cases where only one location is available for multiple retreats
but a power does not want to force the disband of another unit, there
is always an option to disband one's unit instead of retreating.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "convoy">Is an attack on a fleet sufficient to disrupt a convoy?</a></h3><p>

For beginners who are just interested in whether an attack is sufficient to
disrupt a convoy, the answer is no. Even under the paradox circumstances
discussed below, a convoy is not disrupted due to a fleet being attacked
but not dislodged. You MUST dislodge a convoying fleet to disrupt a
convoy.<p>

For those interested in more detailed and advanced theoretical
discussion of the rules, the section below discusses rule XII.5. A
CONVOYED ATTACK DOES NOT CUT CERTAIN SUPPORTS. and Pandin's Paradox which
gave rise to Avalon Hill adding this rule to the 2nd edition  1982 of
the Rules of Diplomacy.<p>

The original situation known as Pandin's Paradox is:<p>

Turkey:
<ul>
<li>F TYN C A NAP - TUN
<li>A NAP - TYN - TUN
</ul>
France:
<ul>
<li>F WME C A NAF - TUS
<li>F GOL C A NAF - TUS
<li>A NAF - WME - GOL - TUS
<li>F TUN S F WME 
</ul>
England:
<ul>
<li>F SPA (sc) - WME
<li>F MAO S F SPA (sc) - WME
</ul>
Italy:
<ul>
<li>F ROM  - TYN
<li>F TUS S F ROM - TYN
</ul><p>

If you look at this situation without the rule (see below), depending on
where you start in the loop you get different outcomes: The army in
North Africa is convoyed through WME (which holds with the support of 
F TUN), then through the GOL to TUS. This cuts the support of F TUS for
F ROM - TYN, so F ROM doesn't dislodge F TYN. That being the case, A NAP
is successfully convoyed to Tunis, which cuts the support for F WME, so
the attack from SPA (sc) dislodges F WME, which means the army from
North Africa doesn't make it to Tuscany,...so the support for F ROM is
valid, so F TYN is dislodged, so the army from Naples doesn't get to
Tunis, so the support for WME is valid...and around and around in
circles for ever!<p>

This is Pandin's Paradox, so named for Tim Pandin, who initially opened
this can of worms. Rule XII. 5. A CONOYED ATTACK DOES NOT CUT CERTAIN
ATTACKS. was included in the 1982 second edition of the rules to resolve
this problem. This rule states:<p>

"If a convoyed army attacks a fleet which is supporting an action in a
body of water; and that body of water contains a convoying fleet, that
support is not cut."<p>

The result in the situation given above is that no units are able to
move.<p>

You may ask what would happen if either convoyed army had sufficient
valid support (from units not mentioned if the above scenario) to
dislodge the fleet that was 'supporting an action in a body of
water...'. The result would be that the fleet giving that support would
be dislodged, but that the support for the action in the body of water
would still be valid, even though the fleet was dislodged! Strange, but
true!<p>

<u>Note:</u> It is not clear what is meant by 'a convoying fleet'. The
generally accepted view is that it is any convoying fleet, even one
involved in a completley different convoy, such as F TUN S F WME, and 
F TUS S F ROM - TYN in the original Pandin's Paradox situation. This is
because the situation where the fleet concerned is supporting an attack
on the fleet delivering the convoyed army to attack the first fleet is
adequately covered by Rule X. CUTTING SUPPORT.. Therefore they must have
written the rule to cover 'any convoying fleet'.<p>

However it is not clear whether such things as F MAO C SWE - SER would
constitute a convoying fleet. Some argue that since this is not a
'sensible' order the rule doesn't apply to it. The reasoning behind this
is that if it did apply to this situation people could order moves such
as this to give a measure of added protection to the supports for the
'convoying' fleet. It would be very difficult to define clearly what was
sensible and what was not though.<p>

The is no definitely correct ruling on this.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "rebuild">Can I remove a unit in a winter phase and rebuild it as something different?</a></h3><p>
If a unit is dislodged in the fall movement phase, it may be removed, and
a replacement unit might be added, depending upon the Supply Center count.
During the adjustment phase, it is not possible to simultaneously add and
remove forces.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "whatif">Here's the setup and some orders -- what happens?</a></h3><p>
There are four ways to go about trying to find the results from a given set of orders :
<ul>
<li>Firstly, try rereading the rules. You will be surprised how often you find an appropriate rule that you do not remember from reading the rules previously.
<li>Secondly, try asking the person running your game. If they don't know then they should be able to find out.
<li>Thirdly, if you use the judges, there is a game on USTR called "Oracle" which is there specifically to allow you to enter orders and find out what happens. 
    List the game, and then follow the instructions.
<li>Finally, if you ask on rec.games.diplomacy, then someone will probably be able to answer the question for you. 
    However, please try the other methods first if possible, as if r.g.d. gets flooded with such questions then people will very quickly stop answering them.

    <h3><li><a name = "dip">What is "FTF" Diplomacy?</a></h3><p>
"FTF" stands for "Face-to-Face" and refers to games played by a group of
people who are physically in the same location.  Usually the term "FTF" is
used to distinguish a game played "in- person" from games played by mail
(<A HREF="#postal">"postal" Diplomacy</a>) or over the Internet 
(<A HREF="#pbem">"PBEM" Diplomacy</A>). <p>


    <h3><li><a name = "clubs">How can I find other people to play with or Diplomacy clubs or organizations?</a></h3><p>

The Diplomatic Pouch web site has a Clubs and Organizations page that
lists people from all over the world who are seeking participants in FTF
games (<A HREF="http:www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Face/">http:www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Face/</A>). 
Many universities or game/hobby
stores have gaming clubs that might include Diplomacy players.  People
often seek other Diplomacy players in their area by posting a message to
the rec.games.diplomacy newsgroup.  But best of all, help the hobby expand
by teaching your friends how to play Diplomacy!<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "tournaments">How can I get started playing in Diplomacy tournaments?</a></h3><p>

The primary resource for finding Diplomacy tournaments in your area
is The Diplomatic Pouch's FTF page, <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Face/">
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Face/</A> However, despite the best efforts of the Pouch team, 
there is a chance that there are tournaments that are not listed there, particularly
if you are not from North America. Contact local universities and see if
they have a games club - these are often fertile ground for finding Diplomacy
players near you. Some of them may know of tournaments in your local area.
You might also post to rec.games.diplomacy asking for contacts or
<A HREF="#mailing">mailing lists</A> in your area.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "postal">What is postal Diplomacy?</a></h3><p>

Postal Diplomacy is Diplomacy played via non-electronic "snail" mail. It 
is usually played through 'zines which have articles, game results, and 
new games forming. More information can be found at 
<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/</A>.

    <h3><li><a name = "zines">How can I find out about Diplomacy zines?</a></h3><p>

This question will be answered in a future version of the FAQ.<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "pbem">What is PBEM Diplomacy?</a></h3><p>

PBEM stands for Play By Electronic Mail, and refers to Diplomacy games in
which negotiations take place using E-mail.  Usually the term "PBEM" is
used to distinguish a game played over E-mail from games played in person
(FTF Diplomacy) or by regular mail (postal Diplomacy).<p>

    <h3><li><a name = "startpbem">How do I get started playing PBEM Diplomacy?</a></h3><p>

Getting started in PBEM Diplomacy is a relatively easy process. The
first thing you will need is a copy of the rules, so that you can
understand how the game is played. If you have the rules, and have any 
questions about them, you may ask them on the Diplomacy newsgroup 
rec.games.diplomacy.<p>

Once you have the rules, you are ready to play. One of the easiest ways
to play Diplomacy on the internet is through the judge system. The
judge is a program that runs and ajudicates Diplomacy games. In order to
play, however, you must register on the judge. A good introduction for 
starting (newbie) judge players, including information on how to 
register, is located at <A HREF="http://haas.berkeley.edu/~schwarz/main.html">
http://haas.berkeley.edu/~schwarz/main.html</a>.<p>

The addresses for the USIN, USEF, and USCT/USCA judges have changed 
since this site was created, so do not use the addresses listed to 
communicate with these judges.<p>

Visit <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch</a>.
This is the homepage of the PBEM 
hobby. It contains (among numerous other resources) a web 'zine that 
covers Diplomacy as a whole, an openings list that lists current open 
positions in judge games, and a game queue service to help speed the 
process of getting players into high demand games.<p>

Newbies can also join a group called Cat23, which plays hand ajudicated 
Diplomacy games. Info, including instructions for getting into a game, 
may be found at <A HREF="http://www.acronet.net/~mczet/">http://www.acronet.net/~mczet/</A>.<p>

<li>The Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy by Rod Walker<p>

Available in some game stores<p>

The Gamer's Guide to Diplomacy is, in the words of an old friend, "the
next best thing to actually playing."  While I might not go that far, I
would say that any neophyte to Diplomacy with a little time and money
to spare should pick up a copy.<p>

Physically speaking, the guide is about the size of a thin magazine.  It
includes appx 35 pages of information ranging from historical (the who's
who of the ruling class in 1901) to neat little tricks to help you play
better to detailed suggestions for openings and alliances for each of the
powers.  There is also a sample game and some information about the
hobby itself:  the postal system, tournaments etc.<p>

For my money, the most interesting part of the guide is the analysis of
the various powers.  The author goes through, power by power, and
suggests how that power should best negotiate with each other power.  He
then lists several possible openings for that power and explains the strengths
and weaknesses of each opening, and how these openings relate to the
powers' various neighbors (i.e.  is it a pro-German or anti-German opening.)
The conclusion of the analysis of each power includes (IMHO) a less that
thorough analysis of the midgame and endgame play for the power in question.<p>

The author's advice viz negotiations and and openings in strongly slanted
by his (unstated but apparent) strong belief in alliance play (i.e. the
belief that one should choose another power and stick with that power at
least through the middle of the game.<p>

Oh, yes.  I would be remiss in my responsibilities if I did not mention that
the Guide contains some very funny cartoons which, IMHO, make the Guide
all the more valuable.<p>


<li>The Game of Diplomacy by Richard Sharp<p>

The following description has been modified from the DIPLOMACY A-Z.<p>

One of only two books on Diplomacy to be commercially published (Arthur Barker
Ltd, London, 1978), it quickly went out of print, it has been an item of desire
ever since. Every Diplomacy fan should have a copy, but it has dated and many
would argue that the book is not very well balanced; presenting a distorted
picture of the game.<p>

You can obtain a photocopy of this book by writing either<p>

Richard Sharp, Norton House, Whielden Street, Amersham, BUCKS. HP7 0HU England
(5 pounds)<p>

or<p>
Fred C. Davis Jr. 3210 K Wheaton Way, Ellicott City, MD 21043. USA
(US$7, US$8 overseas)<p>

However, this book is still copyright, and may not be copied by anybody other than
the above two people.<p>

<li>Novice Packages<p>

If you are interested in reading more about Diplomacy tactics and
strategy you should buy a copy of one of the "Novice Packages" produced
by Diplomacy fans.  In North America two packages are available:
"Masters of Deceit" and "Supernova".  In the UK "The Novice Package".
Sorry, I don't know how to get any of these packages.<p>
</ul>
    <h3><li><a name = "software">Is there any Diplomacy software available?</a></h3><p>

Avalon Hill used to sell a computer version of Diplomacy for the PC.
That game is now out of print and it's truly not worth your time to
try and hunt down a used copy as the computer players were quite
awful.  There are no other commercial versions of Diplomacy available.
Information on "amateur" Diplomacy programming projects can be found
in question 5.6.<p>

The most widely used Diplomacy software are the Internet Diplomacy
Judges, which are used to manage and adjudicate a majority of the
games played by email (though many games are still adjudicated the
old fashioned way -- by hand).  More detailed information about the
Internet Diplomacy Judges and PBEM Diplomacy can be found in the
<A HREF="http://LINK_TO_THE_PBEM_FAQ">PBEM Diplomacy FAQ</A>.<p>

The third type of Diplomacy software includes a variety of mapping
applications used as player aids.  Mapping software exists for most
major software and hardware platforms, including PC, Mac, and UNIX.
A related but somewhat different application is  MapMaker, developed
by David Norman, which is used for creating new variant maps rather
than simply generating maps for ongoing games.  A comprehensive list
of existing mapping software with links to downloadable versions is
available at The Diplomatic Pouch Maps Page
(<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/maps.html#software">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/maps.html#software</A>).  

    <h3><li><a name = "web">Are there any web sites with Diplomacy information</a></h3><p>
There are several good online resource sites for Diplomacy.<p>

The internet homepage for Diplomacy is the Diplomatic Pouch, located at
<a href="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch</a>. 
This site has just about everything a player could want, including 
strategy articles and information on Diplomacy variants. It is the base 
site of the Diplomacy Webring. This ring has several more sites of 
interest on it. The Diplomatic Pouch also has an online resources page 
with links to other Diplomacy pages. Of these, one of the most useful 
for new players in Thaddeus Black's Diplomacy website, located at
<a href="http://reagan.tkblack.com/Diplomacy">http://reagan.tkblack.com/Diplomacy</a>.<p>

Players who wish to play an e-mail game off the judge system can visit 
the cat23 Diplomacy group at <a href="http://www.acronet.net/~mczet/">http://www.acronet.net/~mczet/</a> for 
instructions on joining an off judge game.<p>
