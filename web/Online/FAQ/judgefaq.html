This FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) will be posted to rec.games.diplomacy
and news.answers once every week. The latest version is also available
on the web, at <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/FAQ">
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/FAQ</A>.<p>

Many FAQs are available on the archive site rtfm.mit.edu
in the directory /pub/usenet/news.answers. The name under which a FAQ is
archived appears in the Archive-name line at the top of the article. This
FAQ will be archived as rec.games.diplomacy/rec.games.diplomacy.FAQ.<p>

There's a mail server on that machine. You send an E-mail to 
mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu, with the word 'help' in the body of the
message.<p>

The FAQ will also be available via FTP from several other ftp servers
and Web-sites. Look at the Online resources section for addresses to
the most commonly used ftp servers for Diplomacy resources.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "who">Who made this FAQ?</a></h3><p>
    
A lot of people contributed towards the creation of this FAQ. Too many
for a poor FAQ maintainer to list them all here, or even remember them
all. Even though they all deserve both to be listed, and to be remembered.<p>

This version of the FAQ was created by a committee of people from r.g.d. A complete
list of committee members will appear here soon. Thanks should also go to Pitt Crandlemire
and Bjoern Tore Sund, who did the initial work on this version of the FAQ, and to
Sean Starkey, who wrote the original r.g.d. FAQ.<p>

If you have any comments, updates, error reports et al on the current version
of the FAQ, please send them to David Norman, <a href="mailto:david@ellought.demon.co.uk">
david@ellought.demon.co.uk</a>. Please note however that this is still a Beta Version
of the FAQ, and so there is no need to report the really obvious problems - missing answers,
notes of work to be done, etc.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "start">How do I get started playing PBEM Diplomacy?</a></h3><p>

Basically, to play Diplomacy by email, you need to have (1) Diplomacy and (2) Email.<p>

What this means is that, at the very least, you need to have (or know) the rules
and have a copy of the map. One easy way to get all of this in a convenient 
package is to actually buy the game of Diplomacy, but if you do not want to take
that route, everything except the rules are available online. See info on 
getting the rules, elsewhere in this FAQ.<p>

As for email, it sounds obvious, but what you will need is consistent access to 
the internet. If you have that, then you are ready to go.<p>

If you have world-wide web access, you can learn the technical details of how to
play by email by heading to Andy Schwarz's "Newbies' Guide to Internet 
Diplomacy" which is located at <A HREF="http://haas.berkeley.edu/~schwarz/main.html">
http://haas.berkeley.edu/~schwarz/main.html</a>. 
The guide is designed to be easy enough for first time users to work their way 
through the system without too much trouble.  If you do not have web access, 
send Andy an email at schwarz@haas.berkeley.edu and he will email you a text copy.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "rules">Are the rules available online?</a></h3><p>

No, they are not.  The rules are copyright Avalon Hill, and can therefore not be
distributed by anyone else, electronically or otherwise. The rules for Diplomacy
can not be found online. Avalon Hill has absolutely forbidden this and they have
given a large number of concessions to the Diplomacy community online, so the 
consensus is to respect this copyright.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "findgame">How do I find a judge game to play in?</a></h3><p>

This depends on the kind of game you want to play and their
availability. There are three approaches, each of which is outlined
below.<p>

Using the Judge Openings List<p>

The Judge Openings List provides a listing of all open positions on
public judges. This listing contains games which are forming, and
games which have already started but have openings because a player
abandoned the position.<p>

The list is available on the Web at
<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/openings/">http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/openings/</A>.
The list is also available by mail. Send a message to openings@diplom.org to get the list. 
The subject 'openings longform' gives you a verbose list sorted per judge. The
subject 'openings list' will get you a consise version sorted per game
type.<p>

Once you see a game you like, make sure you check the detailed
listing. On the Web you can click on the game name, or you can send
email to the judge the game is played on, and put 'list gamename' in
the body of the message. Please *do* make sure you read the game
listing. It often contains important information on the game that may
influence your decision to join. For instance, a game may be played in 
a particular language, or it may be part of a tournement, which means
you will need to commit for a number of games.<p>

You can get the same information on which the Openings List bases its
overview by mailing to a judge directly. Send 'list' in the body of a
message to a judge to get its listing of openings and forming games.<p>


Using the Diplomatic Pouch game queues<p>

The Game Queues run by the Diplomatic Pouch provide another way to get
into a game. Just have a look at 
<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DP-cgi/setqueue">http://www.diplom.org/DP-cgi/setqueue</a>,
and follow the instructions there. Basically, you will be placed on a
waiting list for a particular type of game. Once enough people are on
the waiting list, a volunteer game master is contacted, who will
create the game, and invite you to play.<p>


If all this doesn't get you in the kind of game you want...<p>

Both the Openings List and the Queues are restricted in the type of
games you can find there. The Queues are only available for a few
frequently requested variants. The Openings List may show the variant
you are interested in, but less popular variants are unlikely to show
up often. If you want to play a variant which doesn't show up often,
you can always gauge interest by posting in rec.games.diplomacy. Make
sure you mention the variant you would like to play in your subject.<p>

Finally<p>

Please be sure, no matter how you find your way to a game, to commit
yourself to finishing the game before you sign on. An individual game
may not be all that time consuming, but it could easily last for more
than six months. Signing on is an implicit agreement to stay with it
for the duration, even if your position is poor or your relations with
your neighbors are strained. Quitting because you are losing is
extremely poor form. On the other hand, signing on to too many games
can often lead to overload, so be sure to try out one for a while to
get a sense of the time commitment involved. Remember that six other
people are entering the game assuming the players will not quit in the
middle. Please be considerate of others and commit to playing the game
to the end. They will accord you the same courtesy, and the game will
be much more enjoyable for all.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "helpfile">How do I get help files for the PBEM judges?</a></h3><p>

As always, using the WWW is pretty easy.  All Judge help files are kept at 
<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/JudgeFiles.html">
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/JudgeFiles.html</a>.<p>

For those who prefer email, you can use the GET command.  Send an email to the 
judge of your choice with the word "get" followed by the file you want.  if you 
want the syntax file, send<p>

GET SYNTAX<p>

The judge will reply with the file you want in a matter of minutes.<p>

There is also a file you can get via some judges called "flist," which list the 
files available.  Say GET FLIST to see this file.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "whatfile">If I want to know something, how do I find out what file
       to look in?</a></h3><p>

You should look in the Diplomacy Subject Index.<p>

An HTML version of this file is located at 
<A HREF="ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/WWW/dip/dip_index.html">

ftp://ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu/pub/diplomacy/WWW/dip/dip_index.txt</a><p> 

   <h3><li><a name = "gamelist">What does all that stuff in the judge game listing mean?</a></h3><p>

The top of the judge listing of a game gives the details of the parameters for the game. This
includes information about when the deadlines will fall, what variant is being played, what
press is allowed, etc. A full explanation of the game listing can be found at
<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/list-exp.html">
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/list-exp.html</a>.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "openings">Is there a list of judges available?</a></h3><p>

Yes, though due to the nature of the judges (volunteer judge keepers, occasional
outages, etc.), this list tends to wane and wax with time.  The Openings List 
keep a list of all working, public judges at 
<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/openings/openings.html">
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/openings/openings.html</a><p>

Via ftp, you can also see the full list of judges, past and present, public and 
private (with the addresses of the private judges kept private!)

Finally, Martin Protzen (protzen@gmd.de) posts his DIPLOMACY
STATISTICS article in the rec.games.diplomacy newsgroup around the
15th of every other month. This article contains extensive statistics on all 
of the public judges, and also contains the full list of judges
mentioned above.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "variants">What variants are supported by the judges?</a></h3><p>

The judges currently support over twenty variants and the exact number changes 
as new ones are added.  In addition, not all judges run the same variants.  the 
FLIST file (retrievable from any judge with GET FLIST) will give you an idea of 
the variants available, but the best way to find out what variants are available
on a  particular judge is to send a fake game creation message to the judge with
an intentionally false variant name.  For example:<p>

create ?gamename password fake_var<p>

will not create a game but instead you will be told the variant called fake_var 
does not exist.  The judge will then tell you what variants are available.  This
is not the smoothest way to get the information, but it ensures you that the 
information is true for the judge in question.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "resign">I tried a game but I don't like it (or) I no longer have
       the time for the game I'm in (or) I have a valid reason
       for having to leave a game... what do I do?</a></h3><p>
       
      First of all, please don't just disappear.  It's fine if you no longer
      want to play but please do your fellow players the courtesy of helping
      to find a replacement player.  Here's what you need to do.<p>

      One, notify the GM.  He'll seek replacements from among the observers in
      the game and, possibly, from players in other games he's GMing.  It's more
      proper for him to do this part since the other players in the game might
      alter their plans regarding your power if they knew you were leaving.<p>
      
      Two, post a message to rec.games.diplomacy announcing that you are seeking
      a replacement for a position you are playing.  You should not identify the
      game or the judge it is on.  You can, however, let them know what the power
      is, the type of game, the status of the position, and the approximate
      stage of the game.  Ask potential replacements to email you for additional
      information.  When they do, inform them of the name of the game and the
      judge.  They will probably want to LIST the game before signing on.  Once
      they do, if they are still interested in taking over the position,
      coordinate a date and time when you will RESIGN the position and they
      will take it over, or give the GM permission to resign you when the replacement
      is ready.<p>

      However, quitting a game should been seen as a drastic measure caused by
      (a) forces outside your control (losing email access for a long-period of time,
      spouse threatening divorce, boss is ready to fire you if you don't quit) or (b) a
      true lack of interest in Diplomacy.  It should <b>NOT</b> be used to extricate yourself from
      a crummy start or to thwart someone who just stabbed you mercilessly. You should
      never quit a game just to start a new one.  When fortune deals you a bad hand, play it out.
      The rest of the game will thank you for your perseverance, and you'll hope for the
      same from others when you are doing well.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "software">Is there any Diplomacy software available?</a></h3><p>

Avalon Hill once put out a very unsophisticated computer version of Diplomacy.  
It is no longer available.  There are some very nice mapping aids available, 
however, which help you keep track of your email games.  A current list can be 
found at <A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/maps.html#software">
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Online/maps.html#software</a>.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "map">What about the map command?</a></h3><p>
The map command is pretty much defunct.  None of the judges currently running 
support the feature.  Because the map command used a tremendous amount of 
resources to create PostScript maps, it was responsible for a significant drain 
of judge resources, so most judges no longer provide this feature.  The Mapit 
program (which is available for most platforms) performs the same role on your 
own computer without overtaxing the judge.<p>

If all you want is an empty map of the board for the variant you are playing, 
send:<p>

GET variant_name.ps<p>

to the judge, where variant_name is the name of the variant you are playing. 
(For the standard Diplomacy game, use 'map.ps' to get a standard map of the 
game.)<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "realtime">Is there any way to play Diplomacy over the Internet in 
        real time?</a></h3><p>
          Yes. Several judges now support real-time games. However, because
real-time games require players with lots of time to spend in short bursts
and judges with fast response time, both the player pool and the judge-of-choice
tend to change fairly rapidly.<p>

          In December 1995, USIN (usin@kleiman.indianapolis.in.us) became the hot
spot for rtdip games, but recently FROG (judge@infini.fr), USTR
(ustr@www.diplom.org), and USCA (judge@ugcs.caltech.edu) have tended to be used,
mainly because since speed of response is so critical - judges with smaller game
loads are likely to produce fast responses more consistently. Typically, these
games are held on weekends (US time) and holidays, although midweek games are
becoming more popular. To play, figure on at least four hours of time (often
longer) and some prior diplomacy and judge knowledge.<p>

          If you are interested in RT dip in general you should signon to the
discussion lists "rtdip" and "rtnow". The first list, RTDIP, is used to discuss
RT concerns and plans and should not be used to attempt the organization of a
game. It is very important not to clutter this list with the "I'm here, does anyone
want to play a game?" messages. This list is <rtdip@3sheep.com>. You can subscribe
to this list by sending text of "subscribe rtdip" to the majordomo list server,
<a href="mailto:majordomo@3sheep.com">majordomo@3sheep.com</a>.<p>

          The second list, RTNOW, is used to organize games and can generate LOTS
of mail when a game is trying to be organized. This list is rtnow@3sheep.com.
You can subscribe to this list by sending text of "subscribe rtnow" to the
majordomo list server, <a href="mailto:majordomo@3sheep.com">majordomo@3sheep.com</a>. Once you've subscribed to
this list, send mail to the list indicating your interest in getting into a game.
Indicate your availability and your preference of game parameters, etc. You should be
prepared to commit at least 4-6 hours to a regular game of Diplomacy.<p>

     As well as RTNOW, forming RT games are also advertised through broadcasts in
     the game called RTCHAT on USPA (judge@owl.psc.edu).  This game never has
     moves process, it is ONLY for communication about forming RT games. Signon as
     an observer. RTCHAT is used as a backup to RTNOW, in case the mail server at
     3sheep.com ever goes down.<p>

          RT games have almost exclusively been NoPress affairs. With deadlines of
6 minutes per phase there is no time for negotiations, and with 6 minute deadlines
you only get 2 full game years per hour...if deadlines are much longer the games
tend to take too long to have any hope of completing in one session. With the
advent of ICQ (available from www.miribalis.com) and other similar programs,
players have been quick to see the potential for RT play with press. There is a
group that has formed recently called the ICQ Diplomacy Guild. It has a web page
at <a href="http://www.bigfoot.com/~icqdip">http://www.bigfoot.com/~icqdip</a>
where game starts and reports are posted.
Efforts are currently afoot to intergrate Judge NoPress play with ICQ play to have
RT games where the judge processes the moves, and players communicate amongst
themselves using ICQ. The head of the ICQ Diplomacy Guild can be contacted on ICQ
UIN # 2307373.<p>

Stephane Derdi <A HREF="mailto:SDERDI@be.oracle.com">SDERDI@be.oracle.com</A>
is the list owner for the
European RT mailing list which is used to set up games for RT players in

   <h3><li><a name = "gming">How do I get started GMing games?</a></h3><p>
     First of all, make sure you are fluent both in the general
     rules of the game, and in the usage of the judge. You should
     own, and have read, the Diplomacy rules, and you should have
     played to completion, at least a few games on the judges.<p>

     Send the following to a judge:<br>
          get how2gm<br>
          get ep.house.rules<br>
          get deadline<br>
          get draws<br>
          get master<br>
          get press<br>
          get rules<br>
          get index<br>

	<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/S1995M/Dreier/Newbie.html">
	http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Zine/S1995M/Dreier/Newbie.html</a>.  Keep
	in mind that GMing a Newbie game is probably tougher than a regular
	game, as the Newbies expect their GM to be familiar with the works.
	It would probably be unwise to have a Newbie game with a Newbie GM.<p>

<h3><li><a name = "trouble">Troubleshooting</a></h3><p>
<ol>
   <h3><li><a name = "down">I think my judge is down... what do I do?</a></h3><p>
If you send a message to the judge and do not get a reply, then the
judge is probably down.  If that is not good enough for you, then
check the openings list on the web or by email.  It contains a
list of judges that have responded to the lastest openings request.
If a judge does not appear on that list, then it is probably down.
If you suspect that a judge is down, JUST WAIT.  Don't send messages
to r.g.d., as it doesn't accomplish anything.  Also, don't keep
sending more messages to a judge, as that just adds to its backlog
and makes it take longer to get caught up once it's up again.  Just
sit tight, and it will come back up when it's fixed.<p>

Once you do get a message back from the judge, it means the judge is up
again. Before diving in and sending off a whole lot of messages to the
judge, WAIT SOME MORE. The judge still has to churn through all the
queued mail that piled up while it was down. Sometimes everyone jumping
in once they know the judge is back up causes a surge of messages which
is enough to topple the judge again...remember it went down for a
reason. Also, sometimes the judge comes back up, and falls over again
almost straight away as the original problem might not have nbeen fixed
completely. If this is the case, your mail will just add to the backlog.
Generally if you give the judge a couple of hours after it comes back up
it helps.<p>
   
   <h3><li><a name = "samesite">I tried signing on a game and got a message about somebody
       from my site already being signed on... what does that mean?</a></h3><p>

Each player is assigned a site ID number upon registering with a
judge.  These idea numbers are based on area code within the U.S. and
Canada, and country/city code outside the US.  For example a player
from Boston who listed a phone number in the (617) area code might
initially be assigned the site 61700.  The last two digits are
used by the JK to subdivide within regions, especially for players
outside the U.S.<p>

If a game is listed as "Different-Site", the judge does not allow
multiple players with the same site ID number.  This is to prevent,
for example, four players in the same college dorm from playing in the
same Gunboat game.  The "Same-Site" <B>requires</B> all the
players to be from the same site.  This is useful when players wish to
use the Judge to adjudicate a local game.  Occassionally, GMs will set
games to "Any-site", to allow players from all sites to join.  New
players should be warned that Gunboat, Any-site games, especially when
not moderated, are very vulnerable to cheaters.<p>

In assigning site ID numbers, the judge uses not only phone
information, but also whatever is listed in the Site: field of the
registration form.  If you list "home" or "work" or some other generic
place description, you may be assigned an undesirable site ID number,
perhaps first assigned to a player on the opposite side of the world
who also listed "home" as his site.  If this happens to you,
re-register with a more descriptive place description, such as the
name of your university, place of work, or neighborhood.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "dedlow">I tried signing on to a game and got a message saying my
       dedication rating is too low... what does that mean?</a></h3><p>

Some games are set up so that you must have a set number of dedication
points to be eligible to play in them. The game you have tried to sign
on to apparently has this threshold set above your current dedication
rating on that judge. 
Click <a href = "#getded">here</a> to find out what a dedication rating is, and 
how to find out what your current dedication rating is.<p>

If you send LIST [GAMENAME]  (where GAMENAME is the name of the game
concerned) to the judge it will return, amongst other things, a listing
of the settings for the game GAMENAME. On the fourth line there should
be something similar to:<p>

Access:  Any-site, Level: Any, Moderated, Dedication: -10.<p>

The 'Dedication: -10' indicates the dedication threshold for that game.
(In this case -10). It is because your dedication level is lower than
the threshold in the game you tried to signon to that you got the
message you did.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "rorders">I misplaced the last set of orders I submitted... how do I find
       out what they are?</a></h3><p>
       
		Send an email to the judge you are playing on in the following 
		format: (note that after the signon commands there is no need for anything 
		else.)<p>
		
		SIGNON PGAMENAME PASSWORD<br>
		SIGNOFF<p>
		
		Where P is the abbreviation of your power, GAMENAME is the name 
		of your game, and PASSWORD is your password.
		For example, if you were Austria in the game dog and your password 
		was taxicab you would send the following to your judge.<p>
		
		The signoff bit is important for those of you with a signature file in 
		your email set-up. It avoids the judge trying to interpret your 
		signature, as everthing after SIGNOFF is ignored. <p>
		
		SIGNON ADOG TAXICAB<br>
		SIGNOFF<p>
		
		This will generate a response from the judge that will show you the 
		orders you currently have submitted to the judge. If you do not 
		have any orders submitted your units will show on the reply as NO 
		ORDER PROCESSED.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "rmessage">I misplaced a message somebody sent me (or) the latest move
       results... how can I get it back?</a></h3><p>

		If you lose a broadcast or a set of results, you can use the HISTORY
		command to get another copy yourself. For details on the HISTORY command
		send a message to the judge with GET INDEX as the body of the message.<p>
		
		If it was a message one of the other players sent you, you can send a
		message to that player and ask them to resend it. If it was addressed to
		more than one recipient you could also ask one of the other recipients
		to forward you a copy. However you have no guarantee the message will be
		the same as the original from either of these courses of action. (Some
		players save every message they receive so they have a complete record
		of their negotiations).<p>
		
		If the master has sent the command "set all press" to the judge, then
		they automatically get a copy of all press that is sent in the
		game. Quite often the Master is reading all the press, and so can send
		you anything you have lost from any player. A polite note outlining what
		it is you've misplaced should do the trick.<p>
		
		Occasionally you might find your master unresponsive, in which case you
		can try the other measures outlined above. If the Master is seriously
		unresponsive, politely report it to the JK before it becomes a serious
		problem.<p>
		
   <h3><li><a name = "sig">How do I prevent my .sig file from being appended to my
       press messages?</a></h3><p>
     End each message to the judge with the SIGNOFF command.  The judge
      ignores all input after encountering the SIGNOFF.<p>

     Many people choose to edit their .sig file so that the first
     line of it contains the SIGNOFF command, and nothing else.
     This fail-safe is particularly recommended if your mailer
     automatically appends your .sig file to any message you send.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "wait">As far as I can tell, everyone's orders are in and nobody has
       set wait... where are the results?</a></h3><p>
Such things do happen.  Normally there are four reasons<p>
<ul>
<li>The Judge has a backlog, and the Judge ALWAYS waits to finish a backlog,
   to process orders, in case there are new orders in the backlog.<p>

<li>Someone may have submitted what the judge interpreted as an error, and
   the judge is waiting for an error-free submission.<p>
		
<li>You are in the 30 minute waiting period.<p>

<li>Occasionally there is a hardware or software problem on the judge server.  If
you are pretty sure that this is the problem, see this FAQ, answer 2.1
<a href = "#down">I think my judge is down... what do I do?</a>.<p>
</ul>
</ol>
<h3><li><a name = "pbem">Playing in PBEM Games</a></h3><p>
<ol>
   <h3><li><a name = "pregame">How do I send press in a game that I have signed on to but
       where powers haven't yet been assigned?</a></h3><p>
Signon exactly as if you were joining for the very first time, i.e..:<p>

SIGNON ?gamename password <b>variant</b><br>
PRESS to M (or O or BROADCAST)

Note that only press to M or O or broadcast work since power designations
have not yet been made. A GM cannot rediscover your password (if you
forget) until you are assigned a power.<p>

Also note that the variant is required for all but STANDARD games.<p>

Example 1:  if your password were "mypass," to send a broadcast to the
players in a standard gunboat game called "mydip", you would send the following
email to the judge:<p>
     SIGNON ?mydip mypass Gunboat<br>
     BROADCAST<br>
     Hi, all!  I'm glad we're going to play mydip together!<br>
     ENDBROADCAST<br>
     SIGNOFF<p>

Example 2:  if your password were "mypass," to send a broadcast to the
players in a Youngstown game called "youngdip", you would send the
following email to the judge:<p>
     SIGNON ?youngdip mypass Youngstown<br>
     BROADCAST<br>
     Hi, all!  I'm glad we're going to play youngdip together!<br>
     END BROADCAST<br>
     SIGNOFF<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "change">If I submit a set of orders can I change them at anytime up
       until the judge processes all moves?</a></h3><p>

The quick answer is "Yes."  Orders may be changed at any time before
the phase processes.  However, this leads to the question, "When does
the judge process all moves?"<p>

Thre different things will stop the Judge from processing moves: (1) if a
player has yet to submit orders, or has orders in with an 'Error' flag
(2) the WAIT flag, (3) the Judge 'delay'.<p>

The first condition is fairly clear: the Judge requires a complete set
of orders to process.   (Exception: if the game is NMR, the Judge will
process orders without waiting, but only after the deadline and grace period have
passed.)<p>

The second condition refers to the WAIT flag.  Each player and the GM
may use the command "set wait" to prevent orders from processing
before the deadline.  This flag is used by players who submit
preliminary orders, which may change based upon anticipated
negotiations.  Note that it is considered unacceptable to use the WAIT flag solely
with the purpose of delaying the game.<p>

The third condition is the 'delay' parameter used by the judge after
all orders have been submitted.  Typically, the judge waits a
half-hour after the last set of orders has been submitted, to let the
last player submitting orders verify that the orders have been
correctly submitted.  If a player then changes orders, or signs on for
any reason, the 'delay' clock will be set back to zero, as the Judge
assumes that players are changing orders, and need more time to verify
that orders have been submitted correctly.  <p>

Often players will look at a listing and see that all orders have been
submitted, but that the phase has not processed.  They will broadcast
messages saying "What's wrong with the judge?  Why are the orders not
going through?"  Each such message sets the delay clock back to zero.<p>

There is one more condition which can delay a game.  If a judge has
been down, and comes back up with a backlog of mail, the delay clock
will stay at zero until the Judge processes the entire backlog.  This
feature allows the GMs to queue deadline extensions with the judge to
prevent problems when it is down for a long period of time.  <p>

   <h3><li><a name = "conditional">Something doesn't seem right about allowing conditional orders...
       how do they really work?</a></h3><p>

First, conditional orders are only used for phase orders.  Phase
orders are used by a player to specify possible moves for a future
phase, based upon the future board position.<p>

Conditional orders are <B>NOT</B> used to specify a powers orders,
conditioned upon the other players' current orders!  Not only would
this violate the rules, this could also create paradoxical situations.<p>

For an example of a valid conditional order, suppose the English
player is going on vacation and does not wish to delay the game for a
retreat he knows is forthcoming.  He could write the order <p>
phase f1902r <br>
if (German F Nth) then (F Nth -> Lon)<p>

In this case, the condition triggering the move is (German F Nth),
which means that a German fleet has moved to the North Sea.  The
conditions can be rather elaborate, involving ANDs, ORs, NOTs, 
and the clauses can involve ELSE clauses.<p>

For a more detailed description of phase orders and conditional
orders, consult the Judge help file titled Syntax, available from the
judge via "get Syntax" or from 
<a href = "http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/judge/syntax.html">
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/judge/syntax.html</a>.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "whatif">I want to know what the results will be for a given combination
       of moves... how do I find out?</a></h3><p>
There are three ways this can be done.
<ul>
  <li>If one is playing in a game, the GM can be asked the question using
the "press to m" syntax. If the GM does not know the answer, he should
be able to direct you to someone who does.

  <li>Signon as Austria to the game "Oracle" on the USTR Test Judge
(ustr@diplom.org) and follow the instructions in the listing. This game
allows one to signon as each power in turn and manoever all the units
around to one's liking so that the outcomes of various scenarios can be
tested.

  <li>If these both fail, one can also post a message to the Diplomacy
newsgroup (rec.games.diplomacy) describing the set of moves. There are
many frequent readers who can and will explain what the outcome would
be.
</ul>
   <h3><li><a name = "nopress">What fun is no-press Diplomacy if you can't communicate?</a></h3><p>
      There are always ways to communicate...  However, the most common
      method of communicating in no-press judge games is to use an
      artifact of the way in which the judge checks pending orders for
      validity (or doesn't, as the case may be).  Specifically, the judge
      doesn't check convoy orders to see if they are possible and it
      doesn't check support orders to see if the unit being supported is
      actually adjacent to the province it is being supported into.<p>

      Thus, you can order any of your fleets to convoy any army on the board to
      any land space on board.  So, for example, F Con C A Mun -Swe, while
      a completely invalid order, will still be accepted and processed, even
      though it can never succeed.  Additionally, an army can be ordered to
      convoy through bodies of water which do not even contain fleets, i.e.
      A Nor -Nth -Eng -Bre, when there are no fleets in Nth or Eng will
      still be accepted and processed (you'll get a warning message telling
      you to check the convoy but the judge will still accept the order.)<p>

      Finally, you can order any unit to support any other unit on the board
      into a neighboring province which your unit could move to.  So, for
      example, A Par S F Aeg - Bur, yet another invalid order, will be
      accepted and processed, without any chance of success, as well.<p>

      While none of these orders are valid, they do serve the purpose of
      communicating intentions and plans to other powers, even in no-press
      games.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "partial">I understand that everyone sees broadcast press, but when I
       send partial press (when it's allowed), can anyone besides the
       intended recipient see it?</a></h3><p>

      Yes.  The GM and the judgekeeper can see all press if they choose.
      Also, if you send partial press to an observer
      (PRESS TO O), it goes out to <B>all</B> observers
      Further, a little known quirk of the judge is that all broadcast and
      Observer press becomes part of the history of the game.  Thus,
      any player issuing a HISTORY command would be able to see any press you
      sent to the observers.<p>
</ol>
<h3><li><a name = "admin">Administrativa</a></h3><p>
<ol>
   <h3><li><a name = "secure">How secure is my password?</a></h3><p>
      Your password is not secure.  Your password is used to ensure that
      another player doesn't SIGNON as you but the password can be obtained
      by the GM or the judge keeper, thus, you should not use the same password
      that you are using to guard any real-world sensitive accounts or files.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "forget">What do I do if I forget my password?</a></h3><p>
      Send email to the GM of the game (his address can be found by telling
      the judge to send you a listing of the game). He can find out what your
      password is.<p>

      Note: If you are an observer who forgot your password, you don't need
      to do this.  Observers don't have passwords: the Judge differentiates
      them solely by e-mail address.  This is true even if you signed as an
      Observer and specified a password, since the judge just ignores the password.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "hofdsi">Is there any system for rating e-mail players?</a></h3><p>
There are three currently active systems for rating players of e-mail
Diplomacy.<p>

The first system is the Hall of Fame (HoF) maintained by Nick
Fitzpatrick (nfitz@sentex.ca). Almost all judge games are included in 
this Hall of Fame. Points are awarded for solo wins and draws.<p>

The Hall of Fame was last updated in 1996, although Nick Fitzpatrick has
plans to bring it up to date sometime in 1998.  This revision would
eventually include all games finished by the end of 1997. More
information, including which games are eligible for the Hall of Fame,
can be found at <A HREF="http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/HOF/">
http://www.sentex.ca/~nfitz/HOF/</a><p>

The second system is the Diplomatic Pouch PBEM player ratings. This
system uses a modified YARS rating system. This means that losing
players each lose one point, and the total number of points generated is
split evenly among the number of winners. Thus a solo is worth 6 points,
a two way draw is worth 5/2 points, etc.<p>

This record only includes standard judge games completed on or after
April 28, 1998. However, there are plans to eventually include games 
completed before this date and variants. It can be found at:
<A HREF="http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/Ratings">
http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Email/Ratings</a>.<p>

The third system is the Diplomacy Skill Index (DSI), which uses the same 
raw data as the Hall of Fame, but uses it to produce an average skill 
rating of a player per game. This system does not give a rating to 
replacement players. Powers that go abandoned receive a 0.00 rating. 
More information can be found at:<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "getded">How do I find out my dedication rating?</a></h3><p>
<ol>
<h3><li>What is a dedication rating?</h3><p>

Dedication points are an indication of how well you get your orders in
on time. They are intended to encourage you to submit orders in a timely
fashion and to penalize you if you don't, or, Calhammer forbid!, you go
abandoned or CD. Many games require a minimum number of dedication
points to sign on (<A HREF="#dedlow">See above</A>).
Dedication points are specific to a particular judge and do not carry
over from one judge to another.<p>
<ul>
<li>You start out with zero dedication points.
<li>You earn 3 points every time you get orders in on time.
<li>You lose 1 point every time the judge reports that you are late (that's
1 point lost for every late "deadline missed" notice, not per late turn).
<li>You lose 50 points if you go CD (that's when you resign from a game and
the position is not filled before the next deadline expires.)
<li>You lose 100 points if you go abandoned (that when you don't resign
from a game and the position is not filled before the next deadline
expires.)
</ul>

<h3><li>How do I find out what my dedication rating is?</h3><p>

Judges handle dedication checks in one of two ways. Some judges support
the command GET DEDICATION. Send the command 'GET DEDICATION' to the judge. 
If the judge supports GET DEDICATION it will reply with an message stating
your current dedication points on that judge. If it doesn't support
GET DEDICATION it will reply telling you so.<p>

In this case there are two additional ways to find out what your
dedication is: 
<ol>
<li>If you are playing in a non-gunboat game, simply get
a LIST of the game. It will show all players and their dedication
ratings.
<li>If you are in a gunboat game (or just want to know what
your dedication rating is to see if it's high enough to sign up for some
game), attempt to signon to game 'dedcheck' on the judge. i.e. (signon
?dedcheck your_password). The game is a dummy game with a required
dedication rating of 9999. You will receive a message back telling you
that your dedication is not high enough to signon and also telling you
what your dedication is.
(Dedcheck games are only found on those judges that do not support the
GET DEDICATION command.)
</ol>
</ol>

   <h3><li><a name = "recoverded">I was late/went CD/went abandoned because of judge problems...
       how do I get my lost dedication points back?</a></h3><p>
      First of all, if you didn't go abandoned or CD and you still have more
      than 10 dedication points, don't worry about it.  You're not going to get
      blocked out of any games so it's not worth the effort to fix your lost
      dedication points.<p>

      Otherwise, when the judge comes back up send a WHOIS your_username message
      to the judge.  Send a copy of the reply along with an explanation of how
      many dedication points you lost and why to the GM of the game where you
      lost them.  He'll forward this to the JK, who will adjust your dedication
      points.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "summary">How do I find out identities of opponents and other information
       after a game has ended?</a></h3><p>
The Judges keep all important information about a game in a Summary
File.  This file can be accessed for any game with the command SUMMARY
GAMENAME, or by signing onto a game and issuing the command SUMMARY. 
The Summary File that the Judge sends you will include relevant
information including identities of the opponents, Supply Center counts
by year, who owned what Supply Center by year and so on.<p>

The summary file is updated as the game progresses, however in gunboat
games, the identities of the players are not revealed until after the
game has been completed.  One caveat to the revealing of power idenities
is controlled by the REVEAL and NOREVEAL commands which can be issued by
the GM.  By setting NOREVEAL the power identities are kept secret even
after the game has finished. This would most likely be used in a
gunboat tournament, when revealing of identities would be kept secret
until all tournament games were finished.<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "chaddress">I have a new email address... how do I take care of doing
       an address change?</a></h3><p>
     First, notify the judge of your new address by sending, from
     your new E-mail account, an IAmAlso command, i.e.<p>

        iamalso my.old.id@my.old.address<p>

     This notifies the judge that your new address, and your old
     address, belongs to the same person. If this is not done, you
     lose all your dedication points when entering new games with
     your new account.<p>

     <B>After</B> issuing the IAMALSO command, simply fill out a new
     registration form, based on your old one, and send it in. That
     goes as an update to the registration form you sent in
     for your old account.<p>

     The third, and final, step, is to notify the entries in all
     your current games that your address has changed. SIGNON to
     each game, and SET ADDRESS, i.e.<p>

     SIGNON Pralph kramden<br>
     SET ADDRESS my.new.address@super.duper.server.com<p>

   <h3><li><a name = "twoaddress">How do I send mail to the judge from two different addresses,
       i.e. my office and my home?</a></h3><p>
     So long as one of your addresses is registered with the judge and you
     use the proper SIGNON and password, you can send mail from any other
     address. It is, however, recommended that from all addresses you will
     be using regularly, you send in an IAMALSO command:<p>

         iamalso usual.id@super.duper.server.com<p>

     The address given must be the one you registered on the judge with.
     If IAMALSO isn't performed, though your commands will be executed,
     an error message will be generated, which is copied to both the GM
     and the Judge Keeper, and they may both decided to investigate if
     someone is using somebody else's password - we don't really want
     to bother them with that.<p>

     Whether you have sent in an IAMALSO or not, messages will be copied
     both to the address you are sending from, and to the address you
     signed on to the game with. If you  want  to change it so that all press
     and announcements go to  your  alternate address, sign on to each game
     you are in and SET ADDRESS alternate_address.  This will make the alternate
      address your new primary address.  If by chance, you would like to get copied
     at BOTH address, you can sign  on to each game and
     SET ADDRESS  primary_address,alternate_address.<p>

     It is important that you don't include a space either before or
     after the comma between the addresses. That would produce an
     error message, and your attempted command would not be processed.<p>

     All press to you will go to each address.  However, there is an annoying side
     effect.  When you send press, the judge will send a confirmation to (1) the
     address from which you are sending, (2) the primary address,  and (3) the
     alternate address.  Since (1) is usually the same as (2) or  (3), you'll get 3 copies
     in total.<p>
