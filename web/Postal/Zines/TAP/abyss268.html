<br /><br />We welcome Rip Gooch as a full fledged subszine here in <i>TAP</i>, we're sorry
for the circumstances, as Stephen Agar has folded <i>Armistice Day</i>.
Most of Rip's players are Brits, but he is now a North American.  I hope
we can get some serious crossover, but I really want to encourage my choo-choo
guys to write to Rip and get in some games.  
Now, please!
Rick Desper asks: "As for the railway games, where's the rules?  I like building
railroads.  So shiny!"
What should I tell him, Rip??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On another front, I mentioned last time that Don Williams was probably folding,
but he is going to pass his game along to Doug Kent, who is back in the 
publishing game with <i>Maniac's Paradise Lost</i>, which I thought was
a cool name.  
I'm excited about that, though I'm sorry to be losing the game from here.
Check out whether one of those lumbering old farts Gary Coughlan and Mike Mazzer
will be able to close out a win.
Contact Doug Kent to get his new szine at: 1404 E. Lamar Blvd #106, Arlington, TX

The plans are nearly all set for a "Boston Massacre" tournament in Boston at MIT
on June 21-22, 2003.
Make your plans now to trounce me on the Dip board!!!
Show up and have a blast with a great bunch of FTF Dip players.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am back to being more or less on time, but some material targeted for last issue
still didn't make it into this issue.
I'll decide next time if it's ripe, or rotten beyond its time....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It also was not a surprise, but with a sad heart I have to report the
passing of Richard Sharp.
I have more on that in the Dipdom section below.
Rest in peace, Richard!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lastly, I said a lot in my discussion with Mark Lew on the War in Iraq
last fall and my profound feelings at this point remain fixed on the
extreme complexities of the issues.
There are no right answers to anything in this situation, just a lot
of pain, suffering, and especially uncertainties.
Perhaps this is my weakness, but I don't even feel capable of having
a discussion about Iraq that makes any sense even to me. 
I suspect that I would have to spend days or weeks, days or weeks that
I don't have, to fully study all of the elements before I could even
clarify my own opinions (though I did make a good start at that last
fall).
Anyway, I pray for peace and reductions in pain and suffering for
everyone involved.
And I especially hope that our Administration is making decisions
in full assessments of the world of complexities in which this operates.
And save me from sound bites, please......

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the "files" section, "baseball"
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
Use the Telnet button in the upper left corner, that's the easiest
way to do it these days.
You need to sign up as a "member" to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
Really, you can.
John's E-Mail address also is commishjohn of att.net if you want to
send him E-Mail after all that.
John still has openings, you can play RIGHT NOW!
Our season is just starting so this is the right time to jump in,
you can learn how to manage a team and then ease into planning the
building of one.
Contact him at commishjohn of att.net if you're interested in joining us
or ask me for more details, this REALLY IS THE most fun thing I do in the 
hobby at the moment, find out why!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Find him and win the fifty buck prize!!
You have until Issue number 270 to find him.
I want to tell Ed about Kathy and all sorts of other things.
There is a "full board" there now, help me out and earn
yourself some cash!!!
Ed Henry was very active in the hobby in the 1980's.
I don't think he's the same Ed Henry who's so famous right now working
on Kiplinger's magazine (writes the Car reviews and is African American),
but he could be.
Ask him and find out!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Tom, Bill, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, 
the woman that Jerry Lucas used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Berry Renken or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a

The Real True Story of Judy Winsome</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It had been years since I thought about Judy Winsome.  I was telling a 
coworker about <i>Winsome Losesome</i> the other day and decided to see 
if there had ever been anything "on the web" about her.  
Interestingly enough a Google search landed me on your website and the 
search for Judy and Jerry Lucas.  
But ... here is the real true story of Judy Winsome.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I first started playing Diplomacy in about 1967, my senior year in high 
school.  One of my friends found this new game and we would get together to 
play it rather than Risk.  After about 6 hours the board would look pretty 
much as it did when we started but everybody was oozing blood from their 
backs since the stab was much more important than the game back then and we 
didn't have much sophistication.  Anyway, many years later I was working as a 
Cost Investment Analyst for the US Postal Service at their Western Regional 
HQ San Bruno, CA.  Jerry Lucas was the Accounting Manager.  It turned out 
that he had played the game too, in his misspent youth.  We organized a game 
at work with a move a week which not surprisingly became a full fledged 
disturbance and the sole interest of the seven playing.  But ... enough of 
that.  So, we found Postal Diplomacy.  Now in those days there were two ways 
to get on the mailing list of the adjudication "zines"  One way was to pay 
the subscription price and play and the other was to "trade subscriptions" 
by sending a publisher your zine in exchange for his.  Jerry and I decided 
the latter method would be cheaper and more fun.  We were thinking of a way 
of combining Jerry Lucas and Tim Winger into a title when Jerry came upon 
Winsome and we decided <i>Winsome Losesome</i> was a good title.  Since the distaff 
side of the population is underrepresented in the hobby, we decided that the 
publisher should be a woman and Jerry came up with Judy Winsome.  We needed 
an address that wasn't either of ours so Jerry's secretary was enticed to be 
our mail drop.  We started by putting out issues with fake games with fake 
press and lots of jokes.  I remember our biggest contribution to society at 
the time was the invention of the EGC.  That stood for Ethnic Group of 
Choice.  Since a lot of the jokes we were getting were ethnic in origin, we 
would substitute EGC for the potential offensive reference and the jokes 
would be like, "These two EGCs were walking down the street..."  I don't 
recall us every actually having a real game in the zine.  Anyway, in March, 
'82, I became a Postal Inspector and went off to Bethesda, MD to the training 
academy and was later posted to Denver.  Jerry continued the publication of 
<i>Winsome Losesome</i> on his own.   My last conversation with Jerry was a few 
years later in '85.  Jerry told me that a lawyer from Florida showed up at 
his secretary's house asking about Judy Winsome.  
<i>((We all know that lawyer to be Brenton Ver Ploeg....))</i>
The story I recall was that 
the lawyer took the "roommate" i.e.: secretary, out for dinner a couple of 
times and she eventually spilled the beans about who Judy was.  I lost track 
of Jerry and the rest of the folks I worked with then but if anyone happens 
to hear from Jerry or if he happens to read this, I can be reached at 
otimm of aol.com.  Anyway, that is the real and true story of how Judy Winsome 
came to be.  I still consider it to be one of the great hoaxes and one I was 
proud to be a part of.

<i>((Wow, what a great story!  Brenton ver Ploeg (the lawyer in question)
has told his story in detail in <b>TAP</b>.   He will be amused by yours.
Brenton still gets <b>TAP</b>.  Wasn't the secretary's name Leslie Obata?
We're looking for her too, and Brenton in particular wants to meet
her again.  It must have been quite a few dinners....
Now, Tim, I'm willing to give you a lifetime subscription to <b>TAP</b>
for contributing to this expanding story, as I NEVER knew your role
in it!!  Please send me your postal address..... PLEADING....
And do you know where Jerry is?  You should be able to search him up
on your address book in the USPS Intranet.  That would also get you
$25!!!!
This is way cool....))</i>

<br /><br /><b>Tim Winger (Sun, 16 Mar 2003 16:41:52 EST)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's right, her name was Leslie Obata and I wouldn't have remembered it 
had you not written it.  I left USPS in '86.  The regional HQ building in San 
Bruno has been torn down, I have heard, but it would be even money that Jerry 
still works for USPS and is probably the lord high god of USPS by now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I remember, I think it was '81, there was a gaming convention at the San 
Mateo hotel that looks like a castle, I can't remember the name, but I met 
several of the "name" players (at least the names I knew) and wrote about 
them as though Judy had been there and seen them.  They were all about "Hey, 
you should have said Hello!" and the like.  I think they were just trying to 
get any girl to say hello at that point.
<i>((Now that was a low blow..... ;-) and you live in Utah???  I wasn't
married in 1981 and wasn't there, but I am married now.....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I will toss down a search and see who I can find, Leslie is probably married 
by now so a search of Cal. Marriage licenses might find her.  There were a 
couple of Jerry Lucas's in an email search of the peninsula, I may 
crossreference that with BJ and see what shakes out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for me...  I am the senior buyer for Dyno Nobel at their Salt Lake City HQ 
for North America.  We are the world's largest manufacturer of explosives and 
own the only dynamite factory in North America, so that has its interesting 
points.
<i>((Indeed, I'm sure it does!

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John

I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at b.whyte of pgrad.unimelb.edu.au (same university
where John Cain works!) or by mail to send checks at:
Geography Dept., University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.

See http://www.cat23.com/wm02 for full details.  Since I didn't get sufficient
interest to get a team in, I am back on the WorldMasters Tournament Management
Committee again.
There already is a big flare up between a GM and a player where the player now
says he doesn't "trust" the GM, and it's only 1901!
But in general, things seem to be going PRETTY smoothly for a tournament that got
way overwhelmed with 73 teams of 7 players, for a total tournament player roster
of 511!!!
All seventy-three games are up and running with GMs in mere days, an amazing
feat in itself.
Kudos to Tournament Director Rudi van Hal for a yeoman job thus far!!!!
Special thanks to Dave Partridge and Steve Hutton, who I conned into joining the
Tournament Management Committee as well.
Toby Harris is nearing another record first round 18 center victory, gee
I wonder how THAT is happening?
At this writing, I think he just nailed it....

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

As we tried to get together the Fall issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.

Greg Hawes has asked me to pass on this message:
"Devastating news, I'm afraid, for all in the UK games hobby.
Richard Sharp died in the morning of Friday 7th March.
Although I was lucky enough to count Richard as one of my dearest 
friends since we met through the Diplomacy hobby early in 1973, I am 
now not very well networked in the hobby.  I'd be most grateful if you 
could put this sad news out to Richard's friends in the hobby.
The funeral will be on Monday 17th March at 3pm at Amersham crematorium."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For those who knew Richard, but aren't in the UK, I just thought I'd add 
that I attended his funeral this afternoon. A big turnout, filling the 
crematorium - and a sizeable contingent of games players - almost a 
who's who of the "hard core" from the 1970s, who founded PBM games in 
the UK. Unlike most funerals I have been to, it was a bright sunny day 
and a fairly uplifting event, celebrating Richard's wit and positive 
attitude to life.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The funeral was at the Chilterns Crematorium in Amersham, and I decided
to attend, even though I had never actually met him.
I felt a little out of place, but that was because I naturally
knew very few of the people there.
It was a moving and, at times, amusing service, as two of his long-time
friends gave their insights onto his life.
One recalled the meal at Richard's house, during which there was a
loud bang from the kitchen, followed by a yell and another loud bang.
Richard commented, "I don't know much about modern music, but I imagine
that's what it sounds like."

Hi Jim;
While we await the onset of a new Colonia game, Konrad and I have 
been wondering if there are any games of the Youngstown variant active,
or in the planning stages?
<i>((I'm sure there are, but mostly on the Judges (see
http://diplom.org/DipPouch/ and look on the E-Mail link to how
to look up variants on the Judges), which uses to my view a particularly
weird variation of the Youngstown variant.
But you could give it a try.
Anyone else know?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What is the source for researching which Variants are being played
at the present time?
I appreciate your input!  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
-Paul, trauterberg of wi.rr.com

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Well, on the Judges as I mentioned, it's pretty easy, but there
is NOT an easy worldwide way to hunt that sort of thing down.
This is one of the things that the collapse of the Miller Number system
in the expansion of the hobby to the Internet caused.
So, I really don't know and I only know for sure of Youngstown being
played on the Judges.))</i>

Hi Shaun,
I've put this up on dip2000 just in case Mark Stretch doesn't pick this
up on his news page for the site.
As I said on the front page... I think it's unfair limiting awards like
this to only UK players. With email gaming taking off in a big way our
hobby is becoming so international.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Okay so if there is an actual SHIELD to be awarded, I can understand
you/them not wanting it to leave the country. But someone over here
could receive it/hold on to it on behalf of the overseas player, surely.
Just a thought.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tom, Thanks for doing that. 
The award is specifically for the best `British' player. 
If there is to be an International award, it should be something different. 
There is a preference in the UK hobby knowing the person who wins the award, 
and a good chance that they can actually collect the trophy too. 
It's all very well winning an award, but not having it sitting 
on your mantlepiece or whatever, seems a bit hollow.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I would prefer to stick to the parameters that I set when the 
award was first launched, but if someone else was to take over 
the responsibility in future, they will be at liberty to do what 
they think is best.

<br /><br /><b>Ian Moore (20-1-2003)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi Jim!
I've got another letter lying around somewhere for you, half finished.
But I'm still going to start a new one here, because I want to send you
something about music in 2002 before the memories fade.
I don't think I've ever started writing a piece about the previous year
in January, so I'm going to bask in the warm sense of virtue for a bit.
<i>((As I wallow in the pit of despair since it takes me until April
to type the letter in and publish it....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, first up I'm going to mention the Hives, and their album
<i>Your New Favorite Band</i>.
<i>((Really cool marketing idea.... you don't forget the title.))</i>
This wasn't actually released in 2002, and is compiled from two
underexposed records, one of which is nearly five years old.
But it's still one of my records of 2002 because that's when
I discovered it, and because The Hives are my new favorite band.
<i>((Success!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Hives are from Sweden and they play an engaging mix of pop-punk
and pseudo glam rock.
They all have names like Dr. Matt Destruction, Howlin' Pelle Almqvist,
and Nicholas Arson.
Basically the Hives are a big bag of fun, and to hear or see them
is to love them.
Their "Hate to Say I Told You So" is one of the most enjoyable
pieces of music ever committed to record.
And while there is perhaps a Here-today, Gone Tomorrow quality to them,
I'm enjoying the party while it lasts.
I know they are.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Hives give 200% live, as do another popular Swedish band, The 
Soundtrack of Our Lives.
The latter band are perhaps less completely brilliant on record, for 
all that their <i>Behind the Music</i> album definitely has its moments
(and was also released before 2001).
<i>((Wow, I also discovered SOOL in 2002 and if the Hives are even
better, they must be truly sublime and I have to go hunt them up.
I am a true sucker for neo-psychedelic, I still think the Three
O'Clock and songs like "Neon Telephone" are the cat's meow.))</i>
Live SOOL really kick arse.
Apart from the singer, the band are all escapees from the same 
detention centre for overly attractive men, men who live to rock.
<i>((And that can be SOOOO annoying....))</i>
Their singer is this bearded be-kaftaned clubster with a surprisingly
weak voice, who still manages to be one of the best frontmen you
will ever see.
The Soundtrack's sound is more pseudo-psychedelic than the Hives,
also more proto-metallic than their punky pop.
Their lyrics are funny in a laugh at people for whom English is
a second language kind of way.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not sure whether English is a first or second language for
Cornershop.
<i>((Ride, Tjinder Singh, ride!!!!))</i>
Nevertheless, their <i>Handcream for a Generation</i> album is
one of the unquestioned classics of 2002, and was actually
released in that year.
I go back a long wasy with Cornershop, remembering when they
were a ropey punk outfit playing half-empty venues.
<i>((Yes, indeedy do, 1993's <b>Hold on it hurts</b> and songs
like the VERY weird "Inside Rani" or the EP <b>Lock, stock,
and double barrel</b> with the fascinating "Breaking Every Rule
Language English", which suggests this is Tjinder's second
language.... are charmingly unpolished.))</i>
Even then, they had it, whatever that "it" is.
I was pleased when they stormed the charts a couple of years back,
for all that I loathed the Norman Cook remix of their song.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, this time round the Shop have embraced The Funk and
released an album you can't sit still to.
The opener sets the tone, a jazz-funk party tune over which an MC
informs us of all the great tracks coming up on the album.
After that it's stone-cold classics all the way.
It's funny, but I think this album has seen Cornershop shed a 
lot of their fans they picked up with their last outing.
<i>((Hmmmm, really?
Maybe you and I who have followed them through their entire journey
have a different attitude, but I just saw this a naturally related
progression, which I love differently, but just as much as their
other work.))</i>
But pshaw, say I - who needs fair weather fans?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One musical think I must mention is pop music of the Arab world.
I went to the Lebanon on holiday in October, and Arabic pop
provided the soundtrack of our visit.
You hear it everywhere over there, in caf&#233;s and restaurants, but
most of all blaring from tapedecks in taxis and buses.
From what I've read about Arabic pop, it mostly comes from Egypt,
but lately producers in other countries have proved successful
at mimicing the Cairo sound, challenging the Egyptians' 
musical hegemony.
The Arabic pop sound is one of up-tempo rhythms, an odd-mix of
synthetic textures and traditional instruments over which a man
or (more usually) a woman sings away.
They could be singing "Death to Round Eyed Foreign Devils!",
but I think love songs are more likely.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I bought a couple of Arabic pop CDs to listen to at home.
Rather predictably, they aren't quite so arresting, listened
to in the depths of an Irish winter, at home rather than in
a taxi driven by a homicidal maniac.
<i>((This is a REAL example of what I call.... context!))</i>
What has travelled better is the music of Fairuz, 
at least on the strength of the one album of hers that
I brought back.
Fairuz is Lebanon's favorite singer, virtually a
national institution.
She has been going since the 1960's (at least), and while the
War forced her into semi-retirement, she did return to live
performance in the early 1990s, palying a concert on
Beirut's old frontline to mark the end of the war.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fairuz is not an Arabic pop artist, she comes from a more
torch-singer-ish tradition.
Her voice is wonderfully expressive.
What is striking about the record of hers I have is how
she is not left to carry the songs on her own.
Rather the sound is very orchestrated, with Fairuz's
voice just one element in the mix.
This compares favorably with such overwrought western
artists as Mariah Carey or Whitney Houston.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In Virgin Megastore Beirut there are literally thousands
of different Fairuz titles.
I want to collect them all.
<i>((Indeed, I only have a couple thousand CDs in total,
you want that many from one artist....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An odd curiousity which has become one of my favorite
records of 2002 is the Langley Schools Music Project album.
This was originally recorded in the mid-1970's but has only now
been commercially released.
Basically it is a collection of songs performed by rural
Canadian schoolchildren under the direction of their
hippyish music teacher.
Apparently the children picked the songs themselves,
and went for contemporary pop songs.
So you get tracks by Wings, the Eagles, and the Beach Boys
performed by several hundred boisterous children.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was sceptical of the Langley Schools record before
hearing it - the whole idea of a record of songs sung
by children suggests a sickeningly sweet cloying
sentimentality.
But the record isn't like that.... the children don't come
across as quiet little angels but as semi-out of control
monsters possessed of boundless energy.
This suits the uptempo songs well, with the Bay City
Rollers' "Saturday Night" sounding almost like a riot
is going to break out.
More striking, though, are the three songs sung by girl
soloists, who manage to communicate an incredible sense
of emotion.
The performance of "The Long and Winding Road" in particular
is extremely affecting.
I found myself starting to cry the first time I heard it, for
reasons I am not able to clearly enunciate.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Most of the musical instruments on the Langley Schools record
were performed by the children themselves, with their teacher
providing arrangements and some piano and guitar accompaniment.
Hans Fenger is the man's name, and his self taught production
skills would put many professional producers to shame.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Moving on, let me quickly mention "Storytelling" by
Belle and Sebastian.
These pieces were recorded for the Todd Solonz film of
that name, but in the end very little of B&amp;S' music
appeared in the film.
Solonz's loss, one might say.
This is a delightful album of mainly instrumental tracks,
rather different from the usual B&amp;S fare.
I think it's great, but then I would.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I acquired the "Bang" single by the Yeah Yeah Yeahs, one of
those trendy New York bands.
It's really good, big chunky riffs and the singer's sensuous
vocals.
It's funny, the Yeah Yeah Yeahs' singer is being talked up as
one of the great sexy frontpeople of our time.
From every picture I've seen of her she looks like
a bit of a munter, but there is no mistaking
the raw sex appeal of her voice.
And surely that's the important track if you are
listening to a record, yes?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One more thing.... 2002 was the year I finally caught
up with Missy Elliot.
I think her <i>So Addictive</i> album is from a-a-ages
ago, but I only yielded to its charms last year.
Her "Get Your Freak On" is a classic of great vocals
combined with great production, courtesy of Me. Timbaland.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Missy Elliot features heavily in the last musical thing
of 2002 I will mention: Bastard Pop.
This swept Britain early on in the year until everyone
got bored with it, but it was fun while it lasted.
Basically, it's the melding together of two completely
different songs, usually by some scamp displaying a
cavalier approach to the laws of intellectual property.
So you might get Chuck D of Public Enemy singing over 
a Herb Alpert accompaniment, Christina Aguilera singing over
the Strokes, or TLC singing over Human League's "Being Boiled".
Every second Bastard Pop track feathers either the tune or
vocals of "Get UR Freak On".
<i>((But of course, you can see why....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Then everyone got bored with Bastard Pop.
<i>((But again, you can see why....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And musically that's about it for me in 2002,
apart from all the things I've forgotten and will remember only when
I put this letter in the post.
I hope everything is well with you, things are pretty good with me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim - I got the new Mekons album <i>Oooh! Out of Our Heads</i>, and 
I like it - it
is a stronger album than <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>.  My favorite
song on <i>Oooh!</i> is "Only You and Your Ghost Will Know" - 
everything about that song Rocks!  Love Susie Honeyman's fiddle, as always.
<i>((Amen, brother, amen!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I just made a new best-of Mekons tape with selections from <i>Retreat from
Memphis, Journey, Out of Our Heads</i>, and <i>I Love Mekons</i>.  It kicks.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had badly wanted to see the Mekons at Seattle's Bumbershoot music 
festival last Labor Day, but duty called: I had to work to fill in for
one of our other field employees, who was away on a forest fire (it was
his turn to go).  Even a manager has to do the dirty work once in a
while. As I was raking the compost below the public restroom at the Big
Four Ice Caves trailhead I was thinking to myself: `Right now I could
have been in downtown Seattle seeing the Mekons live and instead I'm
stirring poop. Hello! Mekons or Poop; what's wrong with this picture?' 
At that point I had an awakening and vowed to get out of recreation
management.  So here I am today, a Realty Specialist instead of a Ranger.
I have escaped poopdom, and more importantly, I'll have the freedom to
see the Mekons the next time they come to town.  I wanted to let you know
that it was the Mekons (indirectly) that resolved me to make a change in
my life.
<i>((They would be very pleased to know that.
The Mekons aren't just a band, they are a movement.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On a more serious note, Cathy and I were shocked to learn about the
terrible nightclub fire in the Providence area.  I thought of you
immediately, as I know you have frequented the clubs.  I figured you
weren't a Great White fan and therefore was not there that night (Michael
Quirk, incidentally, was one of their fans) and was wondering if you had
seen a show in that establishment at one time or another.  It wouldn't
surprise me if you did.
<i>((Actually, no, I hadn't been there.
It had only been a club for four or five years and it tended to do shows
I wasn't interested in.
More on that in a minute, it really has been a tragedy that is still
capturing the attention of the whole area.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Cathy and I, having gone to small clubs in Seattle to see The Church,
Steeleye Span, and Toad the Wet Sprocket, never once thought that a club
could potentially become a death trap, nor ever thought about where the
exits were in case of fire - if you'd even have time to escape and avoid
the crush of people trying to get out. We were there to have fun and see
and hear our favorite bands live.  I'll definitely think about safety the
next time we see a show, know where the exits are located, and sit
somewhat close to them.  One thing is for certain in this tragedy:
allowing pyrotechnics in a small club with low ceilings is folly and
should be banned nationally.  And why do some bands feel the need to have
fireworks to entertain people in the first place?  I thought seeing the
band live was in itself entertainment and why fans go to the show.  But
if you have to have fireworks, do it in a stadium. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((And best to you as well.
As you know, you are one of my "szine heroes" and I always know I can't
hold a candle to any of your former efforts.
Your contributions always are especially treasured.
I find myself doing the exit check now, apart from the fact that around
here they are making a point at shows of all kinds to point out exits 
at each performance.
The economics of this, doing illegal pyrotechnics in small clubs, is
a national problem and this should finally put a halt to it.
At least I hope it does.
One of the problems of course is that the music club business is such
a marginal economic activity that it is difficult to make a go of it
doing things right.
The Derderian brothers who owned this place in West Warwick, on top of
using cheap non-fire retardant insulation because they felt they couldn't
afford more, also were discovered to be paying most of their employees
in cash under the table, and even the ones that were properly employed
hadn't had their workers' comp. insurance covered since just after the
club opened.
The fines for that alone are expected to be about a million dollars for them.
Part of this is that there are rules, but they just aren't enforced.
Legally, they were supposed to have applied for a pyro permit from the
fire marshal and then have had the marshal present.
That alone would have cost about $2 a patron that night.
But these metal bands think they need the extra hype.
Great White did this everywhere they went, mostly without even telling
the club owners in advance.
I'm sure they would have said they were just protecting the owners from
the liability.
We'll see if that works now.
No official divying up of the blame has yet been done.
But the stories are just scary, scary, scary.
Some of the survivors essentially survived from being baked alive by
being crushed under the bodies of those who died, stacked up at the
exits.
One person found about an hour after the fire alive went back
later and found the spot
in the ruins where he had been buried. 
There was a person shape as was only part of the floor in that 
area that was still recognizable as a floor.

Jim; A letter for TAP:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Industrial Waste" by Rio Grande Games is the best new game I've played in 
years.  The concepts are simple to learn. There does not appear to be one set 
of tactics, or, more importantly, one strategy that is the best way to play.  
And, because of this, the game is highly interactive - even in play-by-mail.  
As one player acts the need to consider changing tactics and strategies occurs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm not good at describing games with some sort of jargon.  It is a board 
game, based upon owning a factory with workers, machines to make goods, and 
waste that is a result of how one makes the goods.  Too much waste and there 
is a penalty.  One has to pay each turn for the number of workers one 
has/needs to produce goods.  Each of the number of workers needed to produce a 
set of goods, the amount of waste produced and the amount of raw materials 
needed to produce a set of goods can be altered with the right card and 
money.  In what order one does this is the strategy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There are cards and therefore there is luck.  The cards allow one to 
produce an order, dump waste in the river, alter one of the important 
characteristics of numbers of workers, etc. An alteration is called 
an "innovation." There are 11 types of cards, each with a different purpose 
and with a different amount in the deck.  At the beginning of each round sets 
of three cards are dealt out face up on the table.  No set can contain more 
than one of a given type of card.  There is one more set than there are 
players (1-4 players).  Players rotate in their selection of a set of cards.  
No trades.  Then the cards are played.  One gets points for money and the 
innovations (there is a sliding scale of value for innovations, the more in 
one area the more points it is worth).  The end of the game is not predictable 
and therefore timing is uncertain. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is simple and complex.  
To give readers a gauge of the type of games I like, my favorite games are 
duplicate bridge, Diplomacy, Dune, Settlers of Catan, Ursuppe and Pit.  These 
are each highly interactive. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bottom line, David Partridge is offering games in his subzine <i>TINAMOU</i>.  I 
will be GM'ing the next one.  The more players who try it out the more fun we 
can have and the faster we can learn whether this really is a game with a huge 
number of possibilities or one that after a while is predictable and gets put 
on the back shelf.    
Also, for those in the Northern CA Bay Area, let me know, I want to play 
face-to-face and this can be arranged in Sacramento, Castro Valley or wherever.

PS I saw the Pretenders two weeks ago.  The audience was into it.  Chrissie 
was into it.  The band had a good time.  The venue was small enough for me.  
My date was a lot of fun.  But, they played too many songs that seemed to be 
note for note from the recordings.  Still, the best show of the year so far of 
original performers.  I saw an 80s cover band who did nothing but pump out the 
beat and the dance floor was mad.  That was fun.  LeAnne Rimes at the Dixon 
County Fair in May is the next one on my long-distance horizon.  I turned down 
an "intimate night" with Alanis Morissette partly out of timing but mostly 
because I don't want to hear nasal whining all night.
<i>((No kidding....))</i>    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Second so far this year was a show at Yoshi's which is intimate in Oakland, 
more famous for jazz, but had (I forget the host) Paul Duvay, James Harmon, 
Junior Watson - guitar player supreme, and James Cotton.  It was one of the 
traveling blues harp blowoffs or whatever they call them.  Duvay was so fat he 
could hardly play an entire song, but the things he could do with a blues harp 
were beyond comprehension.  James Cotton was great.

believe by NPR, on a public radio station.  The host is using the name 
Scott Hanley, and it sounds a lot like the Scott Hanley I knew in 
Yellowstone, a former postal Diplomacy and United player.  I wouldn't be 
surprised if he ended up doing such a thing.  This note was my Scouting

"Dreamcatcher" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Stephen King has a wonderful talent.  He can and does make the truly weird 
seem real through presenting it wrapped in stories that seem to be about 
complex people.  "Dreamcatcher" is no exception.  The theme from "Stand By 
Me" seems to have been borrowed for "Dreamcatcher'.  Four boys confront some 
older bullies and outmaneuver them to save a fifth young boy from teenage 
torture.  From that point things get a bit strange.  The fifth boy is 
`special'.  His mind is different, and he manages to give the four a gift.  
Their minds expand and they become connected.  They gain psychic powers that 
allow them to `know' things they should not be able to know.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The story starts with the four as adults, not quite fitting into their world 
because the psychic gifts that they share make them just a little creepy to 
people around them.  This is a very promising start.  Then comes Morgan 
Freeman and the cavalry and the whole story turns into an `alien invasion' 
Science Fiction story.  It doesn't work as well as it might.  I'm not sure 
why, but King doesn't handle Science Fiction as well as he handles Horror.  
Within the Science Fiction the `alien' falls into the Horror genre and that 
part works wondefully.  It's the part about the military containing the 
aliens as part of a 25 year ongoing operation that misses the mark.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Still, despite the fact that it is Science Fiction, it is still a pretty good 
movie.  Lots of blood and pretty scary monsters, probably not for younger 
children.

"Agent Cody Banks" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Considering how really well the "Spy Kids" movies have done I was expecting 
to see a "Spy Kids" rip-off.  Didn't happen, this was a "James Bond" rip-off.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This was so James Bond that it is hard to draw many distinctions.  Less sex, 
well, no sex, but all the really neat gadgets, the international world 
destroying bad guys with some sort of initials to identify their outfit, and 
a hero who somehow manages, despite being only fifteen years old, to drive a 
really hot car, defeat any number of bad guys in a straight fight, and 
manages to blow up everything.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It is a kids' movie.  The audience I was with were mostly kids.  They really 
seemed to love it.  Parts were played for laughs.  Except for one joke the 
kids didn't laugh at all.  They liked the fantasy of the kid hero.  Come to 
think of it, I did too.  Kids, don't take your parents.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One thing though, when the super scientist was explaining that the nano-bots 
would eat anything metallic, or carbon or silicon based, why did he then say 
that the nano-bots would not attack their glass container?  I'm guessing the 
writer didn't know what glass is made from.

"The Hunted" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Interesting story.  The audience gets to see everything that happens, but 
there are two explanations possible, and even now I'm not sure which one is 
the truth.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Two really great actors.  Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro share a 
characteristic.  They both have very arresting faces. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jones plays "L.T. Bonham", a deep woods scout.  He was hired for a time by the 
American Military to teach special forces personnel how to survive in a 
wilderness, and how to kill.  He was never military himself, but his father 
was, and his father wanted his remaining son to have all the skills necessary 
to survive, no matter how dangerous the world became.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Del Toro plays "Aaron Hallman" one of L.T.'s boys.  L.T. taught Aaron how to 
track, hide, infiltrate, and kill.  What he couldn't teach him was how to 
stop killing.  That's the story L.T. believes.  But then, if Aaron's story is 
to be believed, the government didn't want him to stop.  Once the military 
was through using his talents, a black ops part of the government found lots 
more for him to do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Unfortunately, one of the jobs they gave him got a little to much publicity, 
and Aaron became a liability.  Aaron decided that his only healthy option was 
to take to the deep woods until everyone forgot about him.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Two deer hunters were killed.  Aaron took them for a sweeper team.  He went 
deeper into the woods.  Two more hunters came across him.  They just might 
have been sweepers.  That, or really stupid.  Either way, they too became 
very dead.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's where L.T. comes in.  The FBI has jurisdiction because the hunters 
were killed in two different states.  They don't know about Aaron, but they 
do know that L.T. is the best tracker they can hire.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tight story, great action, good acting, and, for once Hollywood got a knife 
fight right.  The winner in a knife fight is the guy that you can staple 
together well enough to get him to a hospital.  There may not be a winner.

"Tears of the Sun" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Antoine Fuqua has directed two really powerful movies (may be more).  His 
"Training Day" blew me away last year.  He has done it again with "Tears of 
the Sun".  I think he may actually know what he is doing.  And, he does it 
very well indeed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Despite being in a background of war, a civil war in Nigeria, this is not a 
war movie.  Nor is it an anti-war movie.  I guess you could call it an 
anti-abominaton movie.  There is a lot of very graphic man's inhumanity to 
man.  There is also an excellent story about a man whose heart is buried in 
the darkness, whose life is about following orders.  A man who discoveres, 
almost to his own great surprise, that he is more than that.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Bruce Willis plays "Lt. A. K. Waters" who discovers his own humanity.  He is 
supported by some very fine actors, and a truly wonderful director.  See it, 
but not with your kids.

"Daredevil" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have to compare "Daredevil" with "Spiderman".  
<i>((Please do!!!))</i>
"Spiderman" was about the 
teenage nerd becoming the hero who gets the girl.  It was all about the 
upside of being a superhero.  
<i>((Which was why my wife and I really liked this one.))</i>
"Daredevil" is not.  It is about the dark side 
of being a super hero.  Where Spidey saves the girl and confounds the bad 
guys, while having a ball web slinging his way through the sky, Daredevil 
stays in the shadows, leaping and falling, stomping on criminals, and, losing 
the girl.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I liked it.  I think the presentation of the Daredevil radar sense was 
incredibly better than anything else I have seen in the way of technical 
effects.  I loved Jennifer Garner as Elektra Natchios.  From the trailers I 
thought she was another superhero character.  Turns out she had all of the 
requirements except for the part of being a superhero.  Ben Affleck looked 
pretty good both as Matt Murdock, the blind attorney with a built in lie 
detector, and as Daredevil, the man without fear.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The origin story was pretty good.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But the movie was too dark to make it as a really big blockbuster.

"Chicago" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Take a step back in time to Chicago of the 20's where Jazz was king.  
Absolutely brilliant movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't see a lot of musicals but `Chicago' seemed to me to have a whole new 
concept in musical.  The music was done in parallel to the story.  While the 
story of the two murderesses unfolded the music, the dance, the songs, acted 
as a background metaphor for the foreground story.  It was clever, funny, and 
non-stop entertaining.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I can see why Renee Zellweger received an Academy Award Nomination.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What I can't quite get my mind around is how she was the oh so zaftig 
Brigitte Jones and then became the tiny little Roxie Hart.  When she and 
Catherine Zeta Jones did their double act, she shimmied her butt with a `boop 
boop de doop' look, leaving Zeta Jones with "BAM BAM BE DO BANG" in 
comparison.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Richard Gere can even sing and dance.  Who knew?  Actually it was his 
tapdancing in the story that really counts.  As `Billy Flynn' the defense 
attorney who never lost a case, his many levels of manipulation were a wonder 
to behold.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Special recognition of Christine Baranski who usually plays worldy wise woman 
as `Mary Sunshine' the journalist who sees nothing but good in the worst of 
us.

"Two Weeks Notice" - a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I wasn't going to this movie when I was driving to the theatre.  But being 
compulsively early, I turned out to be so early that "Two Weeks Notice" was a 
better fit.  I like Sandra Bullock a lot, ever since I fell for her smile in 
`Demolition Man'.  Hugh Grant isn't way up on my must see list, but he is all 
right.  `So,' I says to myself says I `I'm going to "Two Weeks Notice''.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is one of those opposites attract plots.  Bullock plays `Lucy Kelson' a 
passionate quixote of lost causes.  Grant plays `George Wade' a rich man who 
is the public face of a particularly greedy corporation that stomps all over 
the lost causes that `Lucy' is defending.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
They meet when she tries to convince "George" to do the right thing over a 
community center that his corporation is about to raze.  He agrees to 
preserve the community center if she will become his chief counsel.  His 
previous chief counsel was just fired for incompetence by `George's' older 
brother, who really runs the corporation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
`George' wants `Lucy' as chief counsel primarily because he knows it will 
annoy his brother.  She agrees to take the job if it means saving the 
community center.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For the next half a year or so he makes her life miserable by calling her 
night and day to make petty decisions for him.  He is a womanizer, shallow 
beyond belief, and unable to select a pair of shoes to wear without `Lucy' 
okaying them first.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
She is the best lawyer his firm has ever had.  She somehow manages to improve 
the bottom line while also managing to keep the corporation from acting like 
a robber baron.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Somehow it gets to be too much for `Lucy' and she tries to quit.  
<i>((Gee, I wonder why???))</i>
`George' is 
addicted to her telling him how to run his life and so doesn't want to let 
her go.  He makes some calls and she finds herself blacklisted.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
All of this is witty and charming and pretty funny.  `George' finally agrees 
to let `Lucy' go if she can find him a replacement that is as good as she is. 
 A very ambitious red head appears and `George' hires her at first sight.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now I can sort of see the attraction that `Lucy' holds for George.  She is 
beautiful and she is lots smarter that anyone else he knows, and she is 
passionate.  Granted the passion is about doing the right thing, but passion 
is passion.  What I can't see is why anyone as amazing as `Lucy' could look 
at `George' and have any reaction other than her skin crawling a little.

"The Lord of the Rings:  The Two Towers" ... a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Once more this is a popular work of fiction.  Not much point in my trying to 
explain the story.  "The Two Towers" tells of the epic battle between good 
and not so good and outright evil between the other two books.  It introduces 
a whole slew of new characters.  I'm only going to mention one and one who 
appeared in the first movie but really came into focus in this one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Brad Dourif seems doomed to be cast as creepy little evil men.  But, he does 
it so well.  I can not imagine Grima Wormtongue any other way.  His voice was 
so melodic and his look so foul.  What a perfect interpretation.
<i>((Yes, underrecognized and a wonderful performance.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Andy Serkis brought Gollum/Smeagol into a whole new light for me.  A wee 
beasty under compulsion of a powerfully evil artifact, the one ring.  This 
interpretation gave him a split personality, Gollum, the creature of the 
ring, and Smeagol who wanted nothing more than to help Frodo keep the ring 
out of Sauron's hand (I'm anthropormorphizing here, Sauron probably doesn't 
actually have a hand.)

"Star Trek: Nemesis" - a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Great premise with one slight bit of thin...  Jean Luc Picard was cloned by 
the Romulans in a plot to substitute the clone for the original.  In order 
for the plan to work the clone would have to age more swiftly.  So they 
doctored his RNA to make him start to age more quickly once he had reached 
physical maturity.  Then, as happens on Romulus there was a sudden change of 
government and the clone idea was scrapped, along with the clone.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He was sent to the slave mines of Remus, Romulus's less fortunate sister 
planet.  Remus only shows one side to the sun and the other side is hardly 
habitable.  But life is tenacious, and Remusans evolved.  They look a lot 
like vampires actually.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Of course, the boy was of the DNA of Jean Luc Picard, so he didn't curl up 
and die.  Instead he thrived, becoming the Remusan leader.  Under his 
leadership the Remusans developed a super weapon (this is the part that is a 
bit thin), and with it, the clout to develop a really super starship.  Then 
one thing lead to another and he, in another sudden change of government, 
became the leader of Romulus, too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He invited the Federation to send an emissary.  He knew exactly where 
Enterprise was at the time, and so knew that his future self would be the 
emissary.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

"Basic" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a Rashomon type mystery story set in a US military installation in 
Panama.  I'm not sure I followed all of the twists in the plot.  The story is 
told by people who are lying.  A serious crime has been committed, a gun 
fight amongst the people on a training mission.  The people telling the story 
are the survivors.  Then pieces of the story are surmised by the people 
interrogating them.  All the versions are presented on the screen.  Actually 
sort of edge of the seat stuff with so many layers that it is hard to keep 
track.  The surprise ending was a surprise.  At least I didn't see it coming. 
What I saw coming was about three twists down the story before it got to the 
actual ending.

Well, the Oscars are in.  The best news was that Gangs of NY was
shut out!  Really, Marty, if you want the Oscar, try making a good
movie again.  You've done it many times in the past.  
<i>((Yeah, I'm not quite sure why some people were THAT
excited about this movie.
Lots of spectacle to be sure, but not that great a movie.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was pleasantly surprised to see The Pianist do so well  (Best
Actor, Best Director(!) and Best Adapted Screenplay).  
<i>((Yes, absolutely, very much worth it!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I still don't understand how Nicole Kidman won for The Hours.  Well,
she was the dominant actress for the past two years, so one can think
of it as a "body of work" award.
<i>((Must be, the Hours really wasn't very good, was it.
And Nicole Kidman's flat performance wasn't very exciting or even
depressing.
Maybe I just didn't get it.
I thought that the 50's "middle story" was the best of all, with
a great performances by both women there.
And John C. Reilly might have been better in the Hours than in 
Chicago.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sadly, Chicago is now up there with Braveheart and Shakespeare in
Love as inexplicable "Best Pictures".  What was all the fuss about?
<i>((Awwww, come on, it wasn't a great picture, but I think it
deserved the Oscar, would you have rather seen the Pianist win
that too??
Perhaps, that's the only one I could have seen.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The best part of the ceremony was watching how various people put
anti-war messages in their speeches.  They varied from Michael
Moore's outburst (followed by an embarrassingly thuggish joke by
Steve Martin) to Dustin Hoffman, who, as he was describing the world
at war in "The Pianist", did so so slowly and meaningfully you could
tell that he had a bit more on his mind than Warsaw circa 1941.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Blecch.  Not a good year for the Oscars.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Picture: 
Chicago will win, which is a travesty.  This is a vastly overrated
movie. 
Moulin Rouge was MUCH better last year, and didn't get any
consideration.
The story is silly, the singing mediocre, and the dancing is not much
better (except for C Z-J.)
<i>((I disagree, I think Chicago was much better than Moulin Rouge.
I guess tastes just differ.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My pick among the five nominated would be The Two Towers.  Gangs of
NY is even worse than Chicago.  The Hours would be a respectable
choice, but it won't happen (a movie about three women winning Best
Picture?  Yeah, right!)  I haven't seen the Pianist.  
<i>((I hope you've seen it by now, that would have been my pick
if Chicago were eliminated.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Director:
Scorcese will win for Gangs of NY, even though it's a mediocre film
at best.  Again, Peter Jackson would be a better choice, but he's not
even nominated this year!  Look for him to win next year.  
Of the five nominees, I would pick Pedro Almodovar for Talk to Her, a
great Spanish film.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Actor:
Buzz is for Nicholson.  The only nominated performance I've seen was
Daniel Day-Lewis in Gangs of NY.  He was the only good thing about
that movie, so I would not be upset if he won.  This category has a
lot of former winners.  It would be nice to see Michael Caine win,
but I don't think any movie that is even vaguely anti-war will be
politically acceptable right now.
<i>((I would have chosen Michael Caine, that was just such a 
great performance, I hated Nicholson's performance, and not in
a "good way" like say I hated his performance in Ironweed.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Actress:
a 3-woman race, with Salma Hayek and Diane Lane not in the running. 
Why was Nicole Kidman nominated for a mediocre performance in The
Hours, but not last year for Moulin Rouge?  I didn't think that
Kidman was even the best actress in that film!  I thought both Meryl
Streep and Julianne Moore were better.  If the Chicago wave is big,
Renee Zellwegger would win.  I haven't seen Far From Heaven, but I
have to think that Julianne Moore was the best of the three, from the
reviews I've read.  But going with buzz, I'll pick Kidman, who
deserves a break.  The Academy is fond of giving Best Actor/Actress
awards to people for the wrong movies.
<i>((I did like Kidman's performance in Moulin Rouge last year,
Julianne Moore was tremendous, really tremendous, as was the woman
from Muriel's Wedding, whose name is escaping me this instant, but
she was great as Julianne Moore's friend.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(At one point, somebody actually said, "And the Oscar for his
performance in `Cool Hand Luke' goes to....George Kennedy!"  Ay
Caramba!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Supporting Actor:
Geez, I really have not seen enough of the major films this year.  I
haven't seen Adaptation, but reportedly both Chris Cooper and Meryl
Streep were great.  John C. Reilly CANNOT win for playing Mr.
Cellophane in Chicago.  That must NOT happen.  (I like the actor, but
that was a weak role for him.)  
<i>((You really need to see Adaptation, that was an absolutely
brilliant film.
I might almost give IT the Oscar, but they never give the Oscar
to "trick films".
And Chris Cooper did give the performance of the year, supporting
or otherwise.))</i>
Can Christopher Walken win for Catch
Me if You Can?  He's done a lot of better work.  Ed Harris for The
Hours?  
<i>((Yuck, not that performance.))</i>
I don't think so.  Paul Newman for The Road to Perdition?  
I think the Academy is going to go with Cooper, which was the only
performance of the five I have not seen.  Of the other four...I
really don't like them all that much.  All of them have been better
in other films.  Newman's character is too simple, Walken seems like
he's showboating a little bit, and Harris and Reilly just don't have
much to work with.  Forced to pick one of the four, I'd go with
Harris.  But I'd be rooting for the one guy I hadn't seen yet.  Andy
Serkis should be here and should win for playing Gollum in The Two
Towers!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Supporting Actress:
The two Chicago nominations should be written off immediately.  C Z-J
is good, but it's still just a silly musical!  What's the big deal?!?
Julianne Moore was very good in The Hours.  But she's hurt because
she's also up for Best Actress, and she's up against Meryl Streep,
<i>((Sorry, my confusion, I would have given this to Julianne
Moore for the Hours.... Meryl was great in Adaptation, much better
than in the Hours.))</i>
who was reportedly great in Adaptation.  (She was also great in The
Hours, I thought.)  Kathy Bates?  Voters don't want to think about
her naked.
I think Streep will win.  Not having seen Adaptation, I would want
Moore to win.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Foreign Language Film:
Well, if Spain had nominated Talk to Her in this category, it would
win in a walk.   I haven't seen the others.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Animated Film:
Ick.  The nominees in this category are embarrassing.  It was OK for
Shrek to win it.  But shouldn't there be <i>some</i> threshhold? 
Reportedly the Japanese film, Spirited Away, is good.  And kids liked
that Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron movie.  One of the two should
win.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Adapted Screenplay:
How can this not go to Adaptation?  :)  A screenplay about adapting a
screenplay!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Best Original Screenplay:
Hey, there's My Big Fat Greek Wedding!  I'll cross my fingers and
hope "Talk to Her" can win.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That's about it for the major categories.  The Two Towers should mop
up in the minor categories.  Next year, it should mop up in the major
categories.  At the very least, Peter Jackson should win Best
Director in a landslide.  Ian McKellen is a possible winner for Best
Supporting Actor, but I would prefer Andy Serkis.  (I say this before
the movie is even released!)  I also expect The Return of the King to
be a favorite for Best Picture, possibly for Best Adapted Screenplay,
and possibly Viggo Morgenstern or Elijah Wood would also get Best
Actor consideration (or Supporting Actor for Viggo M.) 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the whole, a week year for the Oscars.  Chicago could be the worst
Best Picture since Braveheart.  (I'm blocking my memories of
"Shakespeare in Love" winning anything.  Miramax is evil.)
Yeah, it's an OK, fun musical, but it's nowhere near "Great".  And
Renee Zellwegger does not sing or dance particularly well.  
<i>((But that's precisely why it IS great moviemaking....))</i>

It's that time of year.  As I see it, the top teams are:
Kentucky, Arizona, Oklahoma.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The winner should be one of those three.  Texas I think will be
upset, perhaps by LSU.  I like Pitt, but they're in the wrong region.
Syracuse has a good chance of making the Final Four - they travel to
Boston for the first two rounds and to Albany for the regionals.  The
winner of the South could be Maryland, UConn, Florida, or Texas.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
OK, let's be homers.  I'll pick Kentucky, Arizona, Oklahoma, and
UConn for the Final Four.  The real final will be the
Kentucky-Arizona game, which Kentucky will win.  I'll run with the
Kentucky Blue to win it all.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I don't have a lot of early round upsets for you.  Who's vulnerable? 
Notre Dame has been awful recently.  The Big Ten and ACC teams are
weak, and Duke in particular is overrated.

It was the university president's involvement in the case which has so 
enraged the fans. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((That's for damned sure.  I can't fathom the players actually refusing
to play the last two games.  Yeah, the school let them down by
allowing this to happen (the CC coach in Florida TOLD St. Bona.
that he was ineligible), but they had a responsibility to each
other.
Jim Baron is one of the great college basketball coaches in America,
I'm happy he is RI, but I'm sorry for Western NY.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It does seem that coaches who leave WNY seem to do well. Just look at how 
John Beilein keeps doing at Richmond. Eventually Reggie Witherspoon at UB is 
going to end up fired through no fault of his own and he'll end up in a 
competent organization and show people what he can do. 
The situation in Olean right now is just disgraceful. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One thing I liked about the article was that it called St. Bonaventure a 
"real" college and not just a football and basketball factory. 
It was a nice slam on the University of Georgia. My wife, a Canisius alum, disagrees, 
generally saying, "Franciscans...pah!" (Canisius is a Jesuit institution) St. 
Bonaventure is indeed academically tough and in many ways it is surprising 
that they maintain a successful Division I program in what many consider to 
be a major conference. Opponents from all over the country fear heading into 
Olean. John Chaney of Temple says it's the toughest place in the country to 
play. I've never actually seen a basketball game at The Pit but I have been 
there for other functions. It's close. It's stifling. It's uncomfortable. You 
can't breathe. Even in a non-sports environment the excitement gets to you. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also thought it was good that Feinstein attacked the class of people who 
have really been the real problems in college athletics...university 
presidents. Admittedly they are under a difficult strain. College athletics 
are, first and foremost, a recruiting and moneymaking tool. An athletic 
program gets your university's name in the papers, even if it is just in the 
sports section. It gets you name recognition. Even if people know nothing 
about your university they have likely heard that its got a good (or bad) 
basketball or football team. Some universities (like Wichita State or 
Minnesota-Duluth) need that name recognition in order to draw ANYONE. I'm not 
talking just athletes, I'm talking enough warm bodies to fill the chairs. The 
more people have heard of their school, the more applications you're going to 
get and the more selective you can be about admission requirements. I 
wouldn't be suprised if there has been a radical jump in applications to 
schools like Gonzaga or Valparaiso or Tulsa or Southern Illinois in recent 
years just because of how they've done in the tourney lately. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Admittedly some universities are both academic centres and athletic hotbeds. 
Duke, Florida and Stanford aren't the easiest places to get a degree from and 
they also have a tradition of athletic excellence as well. That is exactly my 
point. Those three, and many others, are FLOODED with applications every 
year. Everyone has heard of them. The reason everyone has heard of them isn't 
because of Duke's magnificent medical centre (which has unfortunately been 
rather prominent in the news lately) or the chemistry department of Florida 
which invented Gatorade and revolutionized athletic nutrition, or the world's 
first website at Stanford. People have heard about them because of what they 
see on the football fields and basketball courts, watching ESPN. The money 
gained from athletics and the name recognition is SO great that presidents 
will do anything to keep that flow coming. Wickenheiser saw an opportunity to 
get his univeristy more name recognition and improve his basketball team and 
he went and did it, hoping that he wouldn't get caught. The fact that the 
violation was so clear, so obvious, they KNEW it was so clear and obvious and 
Wickenheiser was STILL willing to take the risk anyway should tell you just 
how desperate some people are to keep their university's name in the papers.

of baseball, making fun of your Red Sox' loyalties, etc., and for that I 
apologize.  While I have a chance, let me try to make it up to you...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NCAA:  let me just say that if I manage to beat you in Jamie's pool this 
year that you should re-think your strategy for picking teams, since I 
have seen NO basketball all year.  Haven't read much about it in the 
paper either.  I just get in the pool to make fun of you.  No charge.
<i>((As long as Syracuse wins on Saturday, I beat you safely!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NHL:  This is new, as I now fear that hockey is going the way of 
baseball, as we've just seen the largest trading session at the deadline 
ever.  Many teams, my own Blackhawks among them, dumped salaries rather 
than tried a last gasp attempt at making the playoffs.  I fear this is 
more than a trend, and hockey may be pricing itself out of many markets. 
Stay tuned.
<i>((Yes, it could be a disaster lost season when the labor pact expires.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
MLB:  Ok, let's make the picks first, since that's the easy part...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL:  Yankees, White Sox, Angels, Mariners (WC).
<i>((I think Red Sox actually beat the Yankees out this year.
Seriously, really will happen, Yankees will hang onto the WC.
Minnesota surely will win the Central and the Angels will miss
the playoffs.
Bet on the A's.
The article in the last NY Times Magazine on Billy Beane is a MUST
read, especially for you.
It's why you're full of crap on your one note charley money thing....
yeah, really!!!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL:  Braves, Astros, Dodgers, Diamondbacks (WC).
<i>((Oh, this is SO wrong. 
First of all, Braves are surely going in the tank, they have NO 
chance of winning.
I choose Philly, but that is chancemaking thing.
I think the Cardinals will beat out the Astros, but that will be
very, very close.
In the west, you err in discounting my Giants, who will be back again.
The question is how and who of the Dodgers and Diamondbacks miss
the playoffs.
I guess, even with the great pitchers, Arizona is out.
I think the Giants will get the WC.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:  Yankees over Dodgers.
<i>((Hah, no way, neither team makes it past the first round.
In the NL, it will be a bit of a surprise team.
Could even be Florida (who might beat out the Phillies!), but 
probably the winner of the Central, either the Astros or the 
Cards, will be in the World Series, and surely lose.
Which AL team will win?
I won't say for fear of jinxing them, but you know who I mean.
And if they don't, this time the A's actually get there and win!!!
That will stick the knife in your theory the best.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ratings:  More dismal than last year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm just going to keep picking Atlanta to win their division until they 
don't, since it is now at 11 in a row.  I don't care how many ex-Braves 
the Phillies or Mets have.  I'm also going to pick the Yankees to 
torment Red Sox fans from here to eternity.  There's gotta be someone I 
can make money off of with that.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Still no sign of fiscal responsibility in MLB, and it's only getting 
worse.  The Yankees payroll will now buy you a squadron of F/A-18s every 
year, just in case you want to have fun over southern Iraq (ordinance 
and fuel extra).  With their shenanigans this year, it ought to be 
apparent even to you that something has to be done, as they are now 
dictating who will play against them by supporting other teams with 
their own payroll.  It isn't just the $170M they are paying their own 
players now, as they pay a lot of deferred salaries to players that they 
made sure didn't go to Boston.  Where is Desper?  Shouldn't he be livid 
about this?
<i>((I don't know, probably.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A couple of notes on my picks:  Bud Selig has found a way to bring more 
teams into the playoff picture, as now all 5 teams in the AL Central 
have become small market teams.  If any of them can break out of their 
payroll ruts, like Cleveland did a few years ago, they will dominate.  
If you put them all in the other 2 divisions and played a balanced 
schedule none of them would finish over .500, and only 2 would finish 
over .400.  Look for Chicago to have more depth than Minnesota this 
year, with or without Thomas.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oakland has announced that they can't keep Tejada's salary after this 
year.  That has to be encouraging for the A's.  "If I play well enough 
here, I can go elsewhere to make big money."  Look for a lot of them to 
chase stats instead of wins.
<i>((You have that precisely backwards.
And they will get better after Tejada leaves, just like they did
when Giambi left, Jason, not Jeremy.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Seattle pick for the wild card is a huge guess, as I couldn't find 
another team in the entire league that could compete with New York or 
Anaheim money-wise.  Maybe Toronto.  The Red Sox' money is apparently no 
good, the Orioles can't shoot straight, and Texas only has 1 player.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Meantime, I'm going off to watch a sport where a lot more teams have a 
chance to win:  NASCAR.  See ya.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
With all the talk about NCAA basketball pools, I thought I'd mention what
has to be the only one that matters: the one that the NCAA runs to hand out
the TV contract money.  When CBS paid for the rights to a handful of NCAA
tournaments (read: the Division I men's basketball tournament, plus a few
others they feel might get some interest, although all of them are now on
ESPN now that the baseball College World Series has gone to a 2-out-of-3
final), there was a bit of an argument over how that money should be
distributed.  The non-powerhouses said that it should be based on how many
sports a school runs; the basketball schools said it should be based on how
well a team does in the tournament.  The compromise: some is based on sport
and scholarship counts, and some goes to each conference based on how well
its teams have done over the past six tournaments (including the current one).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The tournament-based money is $97,500,000 this year, divided into 746
shares as follows:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 One share for each team a conference has in the tournament, from 1998 to 2003;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 One share for each game won by a team from that conference from 1998 to
2003, except the Final Four and the 64 vs 65 game that everybody insists on
calling a "play-in" but it's not, as a play-in is something that determines
whether or not a team gets into the tournament in the first place.  (In
fact, the first year the tournament went to 64 teams, there were three
play-in games; the six conferences with the worst RPIs were told in advance
their champions would have to play an extra game to get into the tournament.)
The conferences are supposed to divide the money equally among their
basketball-playing members (and although there's nothing that requires
this, I'm making that assumption).  Note that if a school changes
conferences, any shares it won while in the old conference stay with the
old conference (so tough luck for the Mountain West for its first few years).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
That being said, here's how it turned out this year - this year's
conferences get about $130,700 per share this year, and presumably
increased amounts in future years depending on the contract (assuming they
don't change the rules).
The per-team amounts (with shares and teams in parentheses):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Big 12 (19/12):  $206,940

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Big 10 (13/11): $154,460

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Pacific 10 (11/10): $143,770

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 SEC (12/12), ACC (9/9), Big East (14/14): $130,700 each

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Conference USA (9/14): $84,020

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The other conferences get $65,350 or less per school.
Note that all teams in a conference get the money, not just the ones that
make the tournament.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Meanwhile, here's how the money is distributed from the women's tournament:
after expenses, the NCAA keeps all of it.  For that matter, that's what
happens to all of the money in all of the NCAA tournaments except for    
Division I men's basketball.  (The BCS has a similar money-sharing policy,
but the teams that participate get larger shares.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now, how soon before somebody says, "How come none of that money ends up in
the players' hands?"  (And then, how soon before the reply comes: "Because
not only would you have to pay the women the same amount - of course the
men are better and more people want to watch them; that's why Title IX
exists - but how do you get away with paying the basketball players but
not, say, the ice hockey or lacrosse or water polo (that ought to cover
most of the country) players?  They need money too...")

so the amounts would depend on how long and hard the players worked.
At least that's how I'd do it.
We're not talking about paying them millions that way, probably about
$10,000 at most per player.
That would allow them to buy clothes, make phone calls, live around 
campus like the rest of the students, but really wouldn't be enough
to have any more than a cheap car - no Porsche or Land Rovers.))</i>

<br />2000G,   No Lawyers Welcome

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Game over in three way draw between Italy, Russia, and Austria.
Final issues in next issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sorry all, I've been meaning to write something but it just isn't happening. 
(Work has been a real bitch the last couple months). I figured I better get 
these out. Attached is an Excel file with all of the stats if you're 
interested.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Congrats on the draw to Bob, Jim, &amp; Brendan. Special congrats to Paul on his 
survival. See you all whenever,  Russ

<br /><br /><b>"No Lawyers" game 2000G
GERMANY (Mike Barno)
endgame statement</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Yay, nobody else won either.  I started next to my old chum Randy Ellis. 
So of course I got lied to and attacked.  I outlasted him (though his 
Great Power eventually was in the big boring draw), but eventually was 
too small and ill-positioned to be of use, so I got cut out of the 
coalition of the moment.  Too much aggravation this game, not enough 
glorious victory or big entertaining fun.  Oh well, back to standby 
positions.  Thanks to Russ for guest-GMing, and best wishes to all the 
players.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Paul Rauterberg,  France</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
HOORAY!!  It's over, and I'm a survivor....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Jim Burgess,  Italy</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Congratulations all.  Well played.  Some thought that Brendan had
the win, but I never thought so and marshalled the forces into
what eventually locked things up.  But I thought that ultimately
I could break through and Brendan stopped that too.
It was weird and it was mostly fun.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Bob Osuch,   Austria, My End of Game Statement (Austria):</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I began this game what seems like ages ago. After the gamestart, J-B 
informed me that four of our fellow players were members of a Diplomacy Club 
and to watch out for coalitions based on that. Thanks, J-B, I thought. Upon 
further investigation, I found that J-B was correct, with a snag. Apparently 
Kent, the Turkish player, was the Club's version of the village idiot. I 
would never go that far...just repeating what I was told by soon to be 
Russian ally.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The game began and to my chagrin, Turkey and Russia appeared to be 
allied against me. I had asked Italy (J-B) to stay out of Tyrolia, thus I 
knew he would move there. So I enlisted Germany's help by asking him to order 
A Mun-Tyo in S01. I knew from the old days that Barno was a good, reliable 
player. Boy what a difference a couple decades can make! Barno botched his 
orders and Italy was in Tyrolia. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The key to the game for me was when Turkey NMRed in F01. The Russian 
(Randy Ellis) admitted that he was going to use the Turk against me, but the 
NMR changed his mind. We allied, wiped out the Turk, and began to steamroll 
west. Finding himself friendless, J-B agreed to help me eliminate France. 
Before long Spain and portugal had yellow blocks in them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was having trouble with my Russian ally. He insisted on wasting units 
for "defense" against a possible stab rather than committing everything to 
the front. We argued incessantly about this, but he refused to budge. I made 
my mind up that he would have to go. I stabbed him and for a time had what 
looked like a winning position. I had promised Italy half of a two-way. 
Apparently, that wasn't good enough for him. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
About this time the French and Russian players quit. I later found out 
that the Club was the Western Diplomatic Quitters Association. Go figure. 
Anyway, the French replacement player was Paul Rauterberg. I was not amused. 
Paul and I go way back and have never seen eye-to-eye on the gaming board. 
When J-B then turned against me, I had an intense hatred for both of them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Their alliance succeeded in knocking me out of Iberia, but that was the 
extent of their damage. It became obvious that there would be a stalemate in 
the Med and the Alps. The game hinged on Prussia and Scandinavia. I had made 
peace with the new Russian player and we were progressing nicely in that 
area. As it turned out, a French change of orders that was never received by 
Russ was the turning point of the game. Russia broke the stalemate line, 
stabbed me, and went for the win.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
J-B, Paul and I were forced to ally. The less than inspired Russian 
play allowed us to regroup and prevent the win. I must admit I had given up 
at one point. No doubt, Russia had us, but when he let us off the ropes J-B 
orchestrated the final couple of gameyears. He did a nice job the final two 
years. No comment on the previous sixteen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Given the potential well of talent involved, 2000G was very poorly 
played on the tactical end. My play was only slightly less incompetent than 
the rest. But it was sure fun to get together with a bunch of great guys and 
I would have no qualms about doing it again sometime. Maybe in my next life.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks to Russ for doing a fine job GMing. OK, so there were a couple 
episodes, but you staged a tremendous comeback after the rehab.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>End Game Statement: Russia:   Brendan Mooney</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I entered this game as a standby.  At the time, it appeared that Russia
had just been stabbed by Austria after a long standing alliance.  Austria
held Moscow, Warsaw and Sevastapol, while Russia held many of the Turkish
centers.  The first few turns consisted of me retaking the Russian home
centers while Austria took the Turkish centers.  On the other sides of the
board Italy was getting in position to take on Austria.  While France and I
mopped up the remnants of the English and German units.  Once the other
western powers were eliminated France then stabbed me.  This led to Austria
and I agreeing to a cease fire.  Our combined forces were then able to move
rapidly westward.  After a couple turns, France and Italy seemed content to
concede to the Austro-Russian juggernaut.  However, I decided to go for the
win.  I voted against the AR draw and stabbed Austria.  At the time I knew
that I could be stopped, but only if AIF cooperated closely.  Unfortunately
for me, they did.  It was a good fight but, in the end they were able to
establish a line to stop me.  I was disappointed with the three-way draw
but, I have to admit that all involved earned their positions.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks to Russ for inviting me to take over this interesting position.
It was great fun to play.  Russ kept the game moving and made sure the
players were involved.  Congratulations to Jim, Paul and Bob for putting up
a good defense.  I just couldn't pass up the chance to go for the win.

Harold Reynolds is willing to start a game of Colonia and one of Aberration.
I think the signup list for Colonia includes me, David Hood, Paul Rauterberg,
David Partridge, and (Yes, really!!) Konrad Baumeister.
That means we only need four more.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Robert Paquin (a subscriber to Northern Flame, and a player in a game

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hi, Jim. In response to your question at the end of the Fletcher Christian
blurb in the recent TAP (where nobody seems to have end-of-game statements),
and to the game opening info paragraph: You, David Hood, Paul Rauterberg, David
Partridge, Konrad Baumeister, and also Rick Desper, have signed on to play. 3
more are needed. I haven't had much luck recruiting anyone else (though Andy
York might if I can get 2 more and then wheedle him...).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Sean O'Donnell is interested in Aberration.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing I am contemplating getting going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, 
and Kurt Ozog are the only ones signed up for that.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A FART draw is rejected, but with far more support than I would have thought,
more because of the apathy.
But perhaps you guys are waking up again!
Indeed, we have THREE more proposals, for a GRAFT, a TIGER, and a RAFT.
The attempt at graft was met by a tiger, so we all escaped on a raft....
Anyway, vote with your Winter orders on any or all of them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DESPER to BLURBIST): If you moved to Warsaw again, I'll, I'll...well, I'll
be very cross and unpleasant.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SULTAN TIM to HAL 9000): You know, Turkey does smell ... probably
something to do with the FART...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DESPER to TIM): Silence does not an alliance make.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to GUYS): Maybe next time there will even be a second conversation
or two.
Could it be possible....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DESPER to FOOL): If only...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DESPER): Then again, where Fool is involved.... better not get
your hopes up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DESPER to WONDER TWINS): Which of you has the animal power?  I always that
that was much cooler than the water power.  "Form of a...popsicle!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE - ALL): The greatest thing you'll ever learn is just to love and be
loved in return.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to FRANCE): Wise words at any level you care to mention, even at the
level of countries.... though most especially important for each of us
as individuals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DESPER to DOUG): Well, I'm messing around in Scandanavia.  Don't know if
this'll help you. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SULTAN TIM to BLABBERING BARON): You best not have double crossed me
again (please?).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BARON to CAST AND CREW OF "AS THE BALKANS TURN):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Attached is the script for todays shoot. Last minute
revisions were necessary, but we feel this story line
should give us the ratings boost weve been craving!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[Scene: Constantinople City Hospital. A dashing,
turbaned man lies in a coma. At his bedside, a stoic
doctor and a distraught Baron.]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: Baron von Blurbist, I am glad you could make
it here on such short notice.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: I was just concluding a peace treaty with the
Tsar, but as soon as I had heard the Sultan had awoken
from his coma, I rushed straight here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: I am afraid he has not completely awoken from
his coma. But he has uttered his first words since the
tragic "Backed into a Blade accident.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: What . . . what words were those, Doctor?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[Pan in for close-up.]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: The words were . . . "Sevastopol supports
Rumania to Ukraine.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[Cue dramatic music.]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: (Brings hands to mouth, eyes wide with shock)
Gasp! What do you think it means?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: (Lays gentle arm about Barons shoulder) I
have a theory, but its only a theory. Before I
explain, follow me to this next bed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[Doctor leads Baron to a hospital bed. In this bed,
also in a coma, is a not-quite-so-dashing man in a
jesters cap.]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: See this patient? When he first came to see
me, it was merely for a paper cut on his tongue from
licking an envelope. I advised him not to lick any
more envelopes until the tongue was fully healed in,
say, eight to ten years, and I prescribed him some
heavy morphine for the pain. But then, tragically,
complications set in. I tried everything I could think
of, but it was no use. The only thing left for me to
try is the controversial "Venice Treatment. Only 1%
of patients receiving this treatment survive, but
thats a 1% better chance than he has now, poor devil.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: Thats tragic, Doctor. But why did you bring me
to see him?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: Well, his nurse is usually changing his tongue
dressings at this time, and shes a real knockout. But
it looks like we missed her, so lets go back to the
Sultan.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[Doctor and Baron return to the Sultans bedside.]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: Anyway, as to my theory, I believe the Sultan
is clinging to life in the small hope that the
Austrian-Turkish alliance he worked his whole lifetime
to achieve, the dream destroyed by the mysterious
"Backed into a Blade accident, will be realized. In
effect, the last speck of the Sultans consciousness
is reaching out desperately to write its own
prescription.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: "Sevastopol supports Rumania to Ukraine?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[Close-up, dramatic music.]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: Exactly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: But what about the Russian Peace Conference! The
hopes of the world rest on a strong northern fleet. I
could doom us all to a culture of Paul Hogan and oil
drum beer cans if I attack Russia!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: Im afraid thats a choice only can make.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: The Sultan or the World. How can one man make
such a choice? How can one man take that decision upon
his soul? [Long pause] Doctor?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: Oops, sorry. I thought I saw that nurse by the
dialysis machine. Man, what do I have to do to get her
to give me a chance? Anyway, what was the question?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: It doesnt matter, Doctor. I know what I have to
do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[Close up. Dramatic music.]

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BvB: Ive always known.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doctor: Great, great. Say, I hear the Russian
diplomacy has a translator with legs that go all the
way up, if you know what I mean. You got any idea if
shes single?

<div class="p"><!----></div>

1) Note John Biehl's new E-Mail address.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MUN): Thanks to all for the warm welcome.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to BOB): Indeed, at least there are no summer retreats, so
you have two issues to mourn your loss.
Reminder, since you haven't played here before, we "take the summer
season", which is a press season, even though there are no adjustments.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LONDON APR 1, 1911): The bells of St Paul's Cathedral rang out a
sonorous and gloomy dirge. Inside St Edward knelt and prayed, then rose and 
approached the rostrum. "My christian subjects, I go now to slay a great 
beast as St George slew the dragon. I go now to do righteous battle with 
the Tretiak Grendel - that great white beast which has arisen in the 
north and who has defiled the bonds of peace. I beseech the Kaiser 
to join me to rid the world of this abominable creature!" 
With that pronouncement, Edward, grasped a great two handed sword 
(which he could barely lift) and called for his war horse 
(with which to ride into battle).
[The Prime Minister had been blunt, "Your Majesty may embark on this 
crusade as an individual, however, the government will publically 
disavow all support for you and would require your abdication as 
head of state. The government, does, however, support your 
sentiments if not your actions]

1) The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) proposed draw passed
and I still didn't have a chance
to do the final Endgame chart.
You have until then to do Endgame statements.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Harold Reynolds has done a lot of work with the maps and 
is guest GMing a new game of Colonia.
This fits with my desire to have Spy Diplomacy be my next "big" game
to GM, so I accept his offer.
I also volunteer to get it started by signing up to play.
There are nine players in the variant, could Harold give me an exact count
of how many are signed up?
Also, Harold ran a test game with Konrad Baumeister, Dave Partridge
and Paul Rauterberg
that you could look at on his website.
See the note above about the Diplomacy A to Z, which also is there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
is this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for the proposal.

(THEY TRIED TO PUT THE ROGUES IN CHARGE OF THE COMMISSION):  "I believe 
that Osama bin Laden should be tried before the International Criminal 
Court... I also believe that Henry Kissinger should be tried before the 
International Criminal Court."  (Amy Goodman, in a speech broadcast on 
NPR radio)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ANKARA): Turkey votes YES to the 5-way draw, or any other draw 
including both Turkey and Germany.  C'mon guys, Brucey's getting tired, let's

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AUSTRIA to WORLD):  Seeing as noone thinks I am worth writing, I am simply
nuking my natural enemy of Italy.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper, Sean O'Donnell, Alexander Woo,
and Kurt Ozog are in to be four of the players.
Any more???
We are going to do it with "wings".
But we do need official wings rules, which I seem to be unable to locate.
Can anyone assist me there?
We have comments by Mike Barno and Sean below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /> <i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "In your country u'ave nuffink,
a paradise of violence, a paradise of nuffink, how come you
taste so good?!" from "100% Song" with those snarling Jon
Langford leads off of <i>The Curse of the Mekons</i>.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE BARNO): Sounds like the "Plane" units in Final Conflict.  Heck, just let the 
Modern Dip players use FC planes.  Maybe even FC nukes, while you're at it!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN): I'll have to write Vincent again to see who starts with the wings if I 
remember right though I know France and Russia start with them and I think 
two other powers. I'll double check
The rule with wings is they are like anyother unit with the exception of 
the starters anyone can build them and they move just like any other unit 
with the exception that they can go over land and sea. They do not take a 
supply center its a blockade the supply center it takes such as
W Lyo-Swi Swi is not part of France or W Eng-Hol A Pic S W Eng-Hol
German A Hol H Because the Wing took the supply center it doesn't count 
towards a build for neither player. The other part is if a wing moves out of 
the supply center it then becomes what ever it was before hand. Ie if it was 
owned then that person counts it again if it is a neutral then it is again 
neutral.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to WORLD): Quote of the day from Glen Beck, "You wonder what goes
through the mind of an assassin who exterminates the life of an artist
like John Lennon, when he had a clear shot at Yoko Ono!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-HIS GENERALS): "We did what?" Sean asked. His Generals and 
advisors answered "We have indeed attacked Egypt's fleet in Algeria, and it 
will not hamper our war aid to Egypt and Germany and Britain."
Sean looked at his Generals and had to nod, but something seemed to be 
left unsaid - It could be the German movement to Eng, but hey what do I know -

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to WORLD, PART 2): The story of the day, an orphan snake and orphan
rabbit meet in the woods.
A sad quirk of fate made them both born blind, not even knowing what they were.
They talked about this and decided to wrestle so that each could try to
determine what the other species was.
When they were done, the snake said to the rabbit, "You have a bushy tail,
long fluffy ears, fur, four paws, and a narrow small mouth.
I'd have to say that you are a rabbit."
The snake then asked the rabbit, "What do you think I am?"
"Well, the rabbit said, you slither a lot on the ground retreating 
from predators.
You have forked tongue, and you are generally rude and you have no balls.
I'd say you are a Frenchman!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to WORLD): I decided to print it, but I didn't have to like it.
I thought the story was slithering, rude, and without balls.
But that's just my opinion, I suppose.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UKRAINE-BOARD): Four on one. I love the odds.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG SUPPLEMENTAL): Attacking the surrounded warbird had been a 
complete success, but the Cardassians managed to take our Starbase in the 
worm hole that allowed to bring in more warships towards the Federation.
Kirk finished the log and evaluated the situation on his sensors and 
half a dozen other instruments and thought one thing for the Cardassians.
- It could be worse. It could have been me. - Kirk thought.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKISH AMBASSADOR-EGYPTIAN AMBASSADOR): Jeff, I am sorry for not writing 
you sooner, but the attack that you commenced against me was flawless and it 
hurt me badly. I really looked up to you as a true ally that I had thought 
you were. I just wanted to say it had been a terrific game for us. I also 
just wanted to wish Dave luck in casting down the infidels.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): The battle begins and the news is mixed.
As expected, our only starbase in Romulan space was overrun.
We put up a good fight, but we were forced to evacuate and
self destruct a front line starship.
The good news is that the Bajorans captured a Romulan starbase
on the other side of the Neutral Zone.
With the loss of one starship, we would have been caught shorthanded,
but I saw it coming.
With the help of Mr. Spock, Captain Sulu, the starship Excelsior,
and two Klingon heavy cruisers, we got together on the Klingon
frontier to form a temporarily stable wormhole using tachyon emissions
form the three starships' warp core (I have no idea what I'm saying!)
to send the Excelsior through the wormhole into Federation space
near the Romulan Neutral Zone and the front.
Our thanks go out to Gowron and the Klingon "high" command.
