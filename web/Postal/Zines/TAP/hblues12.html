      <P align=center><B><I>N.C. Wine Shipments</I></B> 
      <P align=justify>
      <P align=justify>In a free society with a market-based economy, it seems 
      only natural that we should be able to order for delivery to our homes all 
      sorts of everyday items. That is, after all, exactly the appeal of E-Bay, 
      Amazon.com and the LL Bean catalog. In North Carolina, however, state law 
      prohibits individuals from having wine shipped directly to their homes 
      from out-of-state. Or at least did until recently, for U.S. District Court 
      Judge Graham Mullen has struck down the law as unconstitutional. 
      Regardless of the eventual outcome of the court case &shy; an appeal is 
      certain &shy; North Carolina's prohibition on wine shipments from 
      out-of-state serves only to protect wholesalers from competition and limit 
      consumer choice. 
      <P align=justify>With the advent of the Internet, many states passed laws 
      prohibiting shipments directly from producers to consumers, fearing that 
      they would lose tax revenue and concerned that the sales would encourage 
      under-age alcohol consumption. North Carolina's law was enacted in 1997. 
      At least 27 states besides North Carolina, including South Carolina, 
      Virginia, Florida, Texas, and Michigan, prohibit the shipments. Several 
      other states allow only shipments from states to which their state's 
      producers are allowed to sell directly to consumers. 
      <P align=justify>The legal issue centers around two parts of the U.S. 
      Constitution. The 21st Amendment, which ended Prohibition, granted the 
      states the authority to regulate alcohol sales. The state contended that 
      it was doing just that, by barring distribution outside the traditional 
      three-tier system of manufacturers, in-state wholesalers, and retailers. 
      The North Carolina law, like those in five others states, made it a felony 
      for an out-of-state shipper to send wine to North Carolina. In-state 
      shipments are legal. 
      <P align=justify>Judge Mullen, however, agreed with arguments presented by 
      the plaintiffs, six individuals from North Carolina, an Indi </P>
    <TD>
    <TD vAlign=top width=246 height=588>
      <P align=justify>ana man seeking to ship a bottle of wine to his parents 
      in Mooresville for their anniversary, and Oakstone Winery in California. 
      They argued that the Constitution's Commerce Clause, which bars states 
      from regulating interstate trade, also applies. The judge noted that by 
      treating in-state and out-of-state producers differently the state was in 
      fact restricting interstate trade. 
      <P align=justify>Even should the ban on interstate ships be upheld on 
      appeal, the mandated three-tier distribution system has outlived its 
      usefulness. Ironically, this system was established after Prohibition to 
      create more competitive markets with lower prices and more choices for 
      consumers. By requiring wholesalers &shy; an extra level in the 
      distribution chain and prohibiting sales directly between manufacturers 
      and retailers, the idea was to create a force to counteract the market 
      power of producers. Any such advantages are limited, however, when a 
      market contains many small producers. 
      <P align=justify>The litigation is part of a national effort by smaller 
      wineries to challenge in court recent laws prohibiting sales outside the 
      three-tiered distribution system. 
      <P align=justify>For these wineries the issue is one of market access. "If 
      we were cheese or milk, there's no question we'd have the right to sell 
      everywhere," noted Tracy Genesen, legal director of the Coalition for Free 
      Trade, which is working with a number of California wineries in fighting 
      the laws, to <I>The Charlotte Observer</I>. "It deprives a winery from 
      being able to have a national system of marketing, because these smaller 
      wineries don't get picked up by big distributors." There are more than 
      2,000 wineries in the U.S., of which the 10 largest have a 90 percent 
      market share. 
      <P align=justify>Beer and wine distributors, who are major beneficiaries 
      of the laws that limit the competition they face, are also among the 
      restrictions' major supporters. This is understandable, for they are 
      protecting their source of income 18 to 25 percent of the costs to 
      retailers come from distributors themselves. The claimed justifications of 
      the current system, generating state tax revenue and protecting minors, 
      are also illusionary. 
      <P align=justify>There are ways to do both without banning out-of-state 
      shipments. Louisiana, for example, allows wineries to register for a $100 
      fee, pay state taxes and mail up to 60 bottles of wine a year directly to 
      residents 21 years old or older. The odds of kids ordering expensive 
      bottles of wine over the Internet with a credit card for delivery in a few 
      weeks is rather low to begin with; reasonable shipping requirements can 
      reduce it further. 
      <P align=justify>In a world with diverse product offering including wine 
      customer choice is critical. Unfortunately, they are severely limited in 
      North Carolina and many other states, where a constitutionally-dubious 
      restriction on out-of-state wine shipments serves only to benefit 
      wholesalers. </P>
