My insane work schedule has again caused another delay. 
I'm going to go with things for awhile, but I realize that these
continuing delays are unacceptable.
Also contributing was a mini-disc crash that lost me a few E-mails with
orders that I had to re-track down.

We'll send the next deadline to December 20th and then I actually WILL
have time to finish the next szine around Christmas.
I pushed back the after Christmas deadline one week as well.

It's time to start another one of these, and someone asked me
recently, does anyone know where Steve Heinowski is?
He probably still lives in the same house in Ohio where
he always lived, but you HAVE to get him to write a letter
to me to win.
You're nuts if you think ***I*** will tell you what I 
think that address might be.
Steve always was a bit slow on the technological uptake,
so he probably doesn't have E-Mail.
But that should be a good challenge.
You have until issue #280 to find him for the fifty buck prize.
This makes TWO missing ex-Boardman Number Custodians that we're
trying to find.
I've heard that letters have been written, but I've heard nothing
from Steve myself yet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities

What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target

When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a

Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl

Since he can see the name and

Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,

The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product owned by Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In what I believe is a RECENT change, Hasbro also has been putting
the rules to Diplomacy up on their web page along with rules for 
most of their other games.
Not only that, but they have the "current" as well as an older version 
of the rules there.  
Stephen Agar has matched that and more with some of the even older
rulebooks.

As we tried to get together last Fall's issue, it became clear to all of us that the
current editorial structure has failed.
The new issue is almost put together, but needs a new lead editor.
Stephen is backing away, I'm not at all prepared to go it alone,
and certainly Dave Partridge isn't ready to take it over.
But the framework is there. 
Rather than publish a substandard issue of what we have, let's declare
failure and see if anyone cares enough to step forward as lead editor.
It probably doesn't help that the new lead editor for the Diplomatic
Pouch, Edward Hawthorne, has ten times my hobby energy and is running
around like a vacuum cleaner scooping up all the writers (even me, I'm
writing for him first, he's SO persuasive!) for the expanded and back
on schedule Pouch.  I do think there is more than enough room for both,
especially since the Diplomatic Pouch is ONLY available on the Web,
but if someone else doesn't think so, then so be it.
I've heard almost nothing on this lately, so it is getting close to going away,
but who knows, someone may get frisky.
Nothing new yet.

<i>((Yeah, I found it WEIRDLY fascinating - it's their list
of the top 40 American bands/recording acts today.
It was the oddest mix of wacky groups like DFA and Kings of Leon,
standards like REM, Tom Waits, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers; 
and then Dolly Parton at number 12 and Justin Timberlake at number 8??
After that Number 7 on up is dominated by the black artists (none of
whom overwhelm me) like the Neptunes, Timbaland, and OutKast balanced
almost precisely with the white wannabes (who I like even less) Eminem
and the White Stripes.
But then, the number one band I barely know, but keep being reminded
that I need to seriously check out, since I know I'd love them.
And that would be the Flaming Lips!  Right now I just have one
album of theirs that I keep listening to and not being able to 
decide what I think of it.
Gee, though, while I'm sure that reviewer Alexis Petridis 
and the other Guardian reviewers really
worked hard on this, I am pressed to agree with a commenter who
said, "This list strikes me as completely arbitrary. 
Who are you to say that Steve Earle's "sound" scores 9 out of a possible 
20, while Britney Spears' producers score 20 out of 20? 
Aren't you comparing chalk with cheese?"
Still, Petridis clearly agrees with me that the current state of
pop music today is basically a disaster, which is why groups like 
Kings of Leon and the Flaming Lips end up so high. 
These groups which are absolutely NOTHING alike, both reject any
direct connection to "today".
As I said, I don't know what quite to make of Flaming Lips and 
Kings of Leon actually make rock music that kicks.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Of course, I found the accompanying list of the 40 greatest British
bands/recording acts even more interesting.
Selfish Cunt actually makes the list as they claim this group is
more than just a novelty.
Well, perhaps.
I also was a bit surprised since I think of myself as fairly up on 
British bands and fairly down on American ones, but I did know more
groups on the American list.
Beth Gibbons only comes in at number 19, despite the fact that I
think she is heavenly (you of course HAVE picked up her relatively
new solo record "Out of Season" which is my interpretation of what
you have to do to make great music these days - be out of step with
the "season").
But I am glad that Blur makes the list at number 6, the Prisoner number.
And of course PJ Harvey and Radiohead are at Numbers 3 and 2 respectively.
They aren't my favorites, but they make compelling music.
The Libertines are Number 1 and I'm barely familiar with them except
for their negative headlines.
And of course the Mekons don't make the list, so that automatically makes
the list crap.
But it was interesting.
Thanks for coming up out of nowhere, Mark!))</i>

"Matrix Revolutions" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you have not seen the `Matrix' films the story will not make much sense.
Come to think on it, if you have seen the `Matrix' films the story will not
make much sense.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is almost the same cast.  There are some really impressive computer
effects.  What happened to the story?  The story that started in the Matrix and
was more fully developed in Matrix Reloaded wasn't carried into Revolutions. 
Instead there was a whole slug of unexplained Neo superpowers, a small separate
computer world that was not in the Matrix but was connected to it (?), an
ending that was such a let down that I found it hard to believe that the scripts
were all written by the same people.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This was so much less than I was expecting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Small note:  The power suits worn by the humans would have made a lot more
sense if they covered the humans with a little armor.  Okay, so maybe they were
meant for some other task and were adapted.  The adaptation consisted of twin
high powered machine guns with autoloader mechanism, how hard would it have
been to add some protection for the drivers, too?  Not as graphically
interesting I suppose.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"In the Cut" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The movie is an adaptation of a book that is a modern romance novel cross
over with suspense mystery.  There is a lot of sex.  There is actual sex,
potential sex, imaginary sex, conversational sex, and a bit of stalking (two
stalkers, no waiting), and a serial killer with an engagement ring signature.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Despite the above, there was also some excellent acting.  Meg Ryan
has grown beyond the giddy / spunky / perky blonde roles of her early career.  
She plays "Frannie Thorstin", a teacher of writing who witnesses
part of a crime. 
Frannie is attractive, frustrated in her career and private life, not very
outgoing and a lover of words and poetry.  Jennifer Jason Leigh plays 
"Pauline", Frannie's sister who has been having an affair with her doctor, has been
stalking him, and now has a court restraining order.  Pauline is Frannie's
opposite in almost every way.  Mark Ruffalo plays "Guillarmo Malloy" a police
detective looking for a serial killer.  He pulls Frannie into an immediate sexual
relationship.  She is powerfully attracted to him and afraid of him.  Kevin
Bacon plays "John Graham", Frannie's stalker.  Sharrieff Pugh plays "Cornelius
Webb", Frannie's student.  She is tutoring him outside of the classroom
because she sees potential.  He thinks she wants to go to bed with him.  And so it
goes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Fairly complex plot, with, obviously, lots of subplot.  Not a lot of
exposition, but still there is a lot that happens, very graphically, very
darkly.  The movie was lots better than it might have been.

"Runaway Jury" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Grisham has had a lot of success with his books being converted into
films.  In all cases except one, the movie has been an improvement.  A movie has
to tighten things up, select subplots to be dropped, simplify plots, rewrite
endings, et al, to some degree.  Sometimes the book is lost in the revision.
Sometimes it is improved.  With "Runaway Jury" neither happened.  The basic
story is still right there.  The villain was changed from Tobacco to Guns, but
it is still a story about big business protecting its right to do business as
usual without having to worry about the death its products generate. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
When the book was written Tobacco had never lost a court case.  Once that
changed, a new villain was necessary.  I find it interesting that Guns made the
cut.  Interesting in that Hollywood relies on guns in most of its action flics.
Hollywood appears to be pretty pro-gun.  Oh well.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Gene Hackman plays "Rankin Fitch" the big business jury manipulator.  
Verdicts are too important to leave up to juries.",  sums up his philosophy.  
His was the best role in the movie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Cusack plays "Nick Easter" the young idealist who has been working for
years to get onto a jury in a gun suit.  He is does a lot of manipulating,
some of which left me wondering why the writers and the director thought his
tricks would work.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rachel Weisz plays "Marlee", Nick's girlfriend and outside contact. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is a scene early in the movie between the two of them that makes no
sense in the context of the rest of the story as shown.  As I said, the
transition from book to film didn't really go that well.  I really prefer the ending in
the book.  The movie ads promise a surprise ending.  I'm not sure why.  There
is no surprise.  It all falls out perfectly logically, pretty much the way
Grisham wrote it.  The movie simplified the Grisham ending but they didn't
really change it.

They were speaking to the people who HAD read the book, to them the ending was

This is all SOOOOO much marketing, and not about the experience, which is

"Kill Bill:  Vol. 1" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Quentin Tarantino has been watching all sorts of movies all of his life.  He 
loves them.  He also has a touch for dialogue.  Good combination to put 
together "Kill Bill.'.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The movie is all about Samurai and revenge.  Great action.  Uma Thurman is 
very impressive.  The story is something of a mystery.  Strange things happened. 
Thurman's wedding was interrupted by the rest of the assassination squad 
(all with code names for poisenous snakes) she belonged to.  They killed the 
entire wedding party, and beat her senseless, and then shot her in the head.  
Instead of dying she went into a coma.  Four years later she woke up, and started 
looking up her old friends.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This was only "Volume 1" so much of the story has yet to be told.  I have 
faith that it will make more sense when the rest of it comes out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Lucy Liu (O-Ren Ishi/Cottonmouth) origin story was done in Japanese 
Anime.  The action includes lots of limbs chopped off and decapitations, and great 
sprays of blood.  Not terribly realistic, but very true to the movies that 
inspired "Kill Bill".  I look forward to "Volume 2.".

"Out of Time" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is a suspense mystery that was not very mysterious and not at all 
suspenseful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Denzel Washington as Police Chief Matt Whitlock does as good a job as 
possible with the material at hand.  He is lucky in that John Billingsley as his 
friend and medical examiner, Chae, manages to bring life and humour to the movie.  
The relationship between them is the only part of the movie that really 
works.

Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
`Master and Commander' is the promotional title for the body of work by 
Patrick O'Brien.  There is a series of twenty novels 
<i>((Actually, I'm pretty sure that there are more than 25, and this
is adapted from number 10.))</i>
that take `Jack 
Aubrey' and `Stephen Maturin' through the Napoleonic age.  `The Far Side 
of the World' is the ninth book in the series.  
<i>((I'm almost positive it is the tenth...))</i>
`Jack Aubrey' played by 
Russell Crowe, is the captain of HMS Surprise.  His orders are to 
interdict a French privateer working off the coast of Brazil by sinking, 
burning, or taking it as a prize.  In the opening moments of the movie 
the Surprise is surprised.  The privateer appears suddenly out of a bank 
of fog, guns blazing.  Surprise is left badly damaged, and Aubrey is 
left knowing that the French ship is faster, has more guns with longer 
range, and can take more of a beating than Surprise, and that the French 
captain is every bit his equal as a seaman.  Naturally, he takes up the 
pursuit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is a board game called `Wooden Ships and Iron Men'.  This is a 
movie about wooden ships and human men.  It shows a lot of very 
authentic looking detail in ship life, handling and repair.  It shows a 
lot of the human side of the people on the ship at every level from 
officer to seaman.  The entire story follows the Surprise.  The illusive 
privateer only appears distantly, and is only ever seen from the decks 
of the Surprise.  About the only exception is when Maturin, played by 
Paul Bettany, ship's surgeon and a naturalist, takes a specimen gathering 
stroll across one of the Galapagos.  Maturin is the complement to 
Aubrey.  Both men are larger than life.  Aubrey is charismatic and 
heroic.  Maturin is intellectual and equally heroic.  They are sometimes 
at odds but are good friends.  The entire twenty books develops their 
joint stories.  `Far Side of the World' is only a slice, but it is a 
very nice slice.

<i>((As someone who is a bit of an in-between fan of the books - I've
read about five or six of them, but not the one on which this is based -
I have sort of a different take on this that understands some of the
bigger difficulties that big fans have with the movie, I think.
First of all, let me make a few factual points.
The Far Side of the World is supposed to be set in the War of 1812.
Most of the books about the Napoleonic Wars are set in the Mediterranean
where Aubrey is working back and forth between Malta and Gibraltar
against French ships sailing from Marseilles.
Aubrey's prey, then, is of course supposed to be an American ship in this
setting.
You'll all recall that Napoleon was doing things like selling off the
Louisiana Purchase and convincing Spain and Portugal to be less interested
in South America.
French ships generally weren't sailing around the tip of South America and
there weren't any important French shipping lanes there.
Also, without being "constricted" in an area like the Gulf of Lyon, there
wasn't enough traffic and commerce to have spies and find ships as easily 
as is done here (by both Commanders).
All that being said, you'll all immediately realize that making a movie with
the Americans as the bad guys wasn't going to play in Peoria.
And the aforementioned Galapagos expedition obviously was a particular highlight
of this book and matched the "west coast of the Americas" shooting schedule
and locations.
So, if you're going to start what you hope will be a series of films, you
want the first one to be a big hit.
Then, once you have a following, you might be able to get away with Americans
as bad guys, might.... that one might still be off-limits.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Then, let me address the novels.  O'Brien's novels have a number of 
salient characteristics.
The nautical vocabulary is immense and detailed.
Aubrey and his crew is giving lessons on every level from tactics to
obscure devices.
No one minds that this is mostly skipped in this flick.
The depth and richness of the political intrigue and history is likely
a characteristic that would appeal to many of you - this also is a key
way that you get into the relationship between Aubrey and Maturin.
Obviously, the history that was contained in this particular book had
to be dropped (after all, that was about the War of 1812 between America
and Britain).
But the opportunity was taken to eliminate it almost entirely.
Some of what little dialogue like that in the movie was recognizable to 
me, so it came from a book that I have read, though I couldn't quite place it.
This all was replaced with an excuse for musical interludes, with Aubrey
and Maturin doing duets (Russell Crowe was not especially believable doing
this, though he IS a musician, as I'm sure most of you know).
It was a bit more surprising that they didn't set any of the movie on land,
though again, perhaps this was a money/budget situation that they hope
to rectify after a successful start to a franchise.
But, in the novels, there are women and parties, and well, that all fits
in with the political intrigue.
I would have expected to see more of that.
Expect a "back to the beginning" with the original novel "Master and 
Commander" to be the subject of the next movie, which is rich in that
sort of thing.
And lastly, the one thing that they DID recreate faithfully, if borrowing
from books other than the one this was nominally covering, was the 
inventiveness of Jack Aubrey's battle tactics.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((All this being said, and I understand the BIG fans don't do this and
are just angry, this was just a wonderful movie.
Lots of action, character depth, and visually stunning, it was one of
the delights of the year so far to see.
I thought the balance of realism and gore to movie sensibility was cut
just right.
Paul Bettany and the other actors really did a wonderful job.
I would rate Russell Crowe's performance a bit lower, but since he is
so good, average for him was excellent for this movie.
I've seen the ship that was used for the full scale scenes, since it 
used to be based here in Rhode Island, and it was PERFECT for what 
they needed here.
You've mostly heard that they used the Titanic set off Baja for most
of the water scenes, and then also filmed in the Galapagos.
If you see only a few movies this year, I'd make this one of them,
but I do hope that they do "something" with future movies in this
new franchise to expand their sensibilities a bit.  If they do that,
and keep what they have here, I could easily see having sequels that
exceed the original.))</i>

"Looney Tunes: Back in Action" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This was a lot of fun.  "D J Drake" (Brendan Fraser) is a part 
time security guard and stunt person.  He did all of the Brendan Fraser 
stunts in "The Mummy" for instance.   "Kate" (Jenna Elfman) is a vice 
president of comedy for Warner Brothers.  She is trying to bring the WB 
star Bugs Bunny into the 21st Century.  She starts by firing Daffy Duck. 
DJ is ordered to remove Daffy from the movie lot.  The duck eludes him, 
and Kate fires DJ too.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
DJ and Duck join forces after discovering that DJ's dad, Damien 
Drake (Timothy Dalton), the actor who plays a super spy, is actually a 
super spy whose cover is being an actor playing a super spy.  Damien 
Drake has been captured by the Chairman (Steve Martin) and is being 
tortured (cartoon style) to get him to reveal the location of a magical 
gem called The Pink Panth. oops, wrong gem, the Blue Monkey.  The Blue 
Monkey is said to have the power to change normal humans into cartoon 
humans and vice versa.  With it the Chairman plans to enslave the 
cartoon humans and get them to produce lots of Acme products which he 
will then sell to the normal humans after switching them back from their 
cartoon state.  Diabolically fiendish.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Turns out Bugs can't work without Daffy as his foil.  Kate is 
almost fired, but she staves off unemployment by promising to bring back 
the Duck.  She heads out in pursuit of DJ and Daffy, who are trying to 
rescue DJ's dad, and grab the diamond (separate agendas as it were).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Except that I never really got the feeling that Jenna Elfman was 
doing anything more than phoning it in, this was really a good flic.  
Steve Martin was so over the top as the evil Chairman of the Acme 
Corporation that he was more of a cartoon than many of his agents.  
Brendan Fraser was always on, making the most out of his interaction 
with cartoon characters (not an easy task considering that he was 
actually working with empty space to be drawn in later).  Even Timothy 
Dalton's lampoon of his 007 roles was brilliant.  Too bad Elfman wasn't 
there too.

"Gothika" === a movie

<div class="p"><!----></div>
From the trailers I pretty much knew that this was a paranormal 
story.  It starts with Dr. Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) as a clinical 
psychologist in the mental ward of a prison.  She works with the 
criminally insane.  She appears to have a loving relationship with her 
husband, a friendly relationship with the staff, and a caring 
relationship with her patients.  Nice person, very logical.  Miranda's 
husband (Charles Dutton) is the hospital administrator.  On her way home 
from work she takes a detour road that leads her into a near accident.  
As it is, she drives her car into a ditch.  She tries to determine if 
the young girl she almost hit is all right when things go up in flames.  
Three days later she wakes up in the prison hospital, having brutally 
killed her husband.  There was no explaination given as to how she 
became a ward of the prison hospital.  There was hardly enough time for 
a trial, and she was comatose for most of the three days.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This could have been a really interesting movie had the premise 
taken a completely different direction from the one it took.  
Essentially `the devil made me do it' was why she killed her husband.  
It turned out he was a sadistic serial killer on the side and the ghost 
of one of his victims possessed Miranda.  Now I sort of wondered why a 
trained psychologist who specialized in the criminally insane hadn't 
picked up on her husband's mental state. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This could have been a story about a psychologist who had picked up 
on the clues that a sociopath can't help but leave, and who was made to 
seem insane as a way to keep her quiet, while arranging to torture her 
on the side.  If it had been, it could have been a very scary movie.  As 
it was, not so scary.  It came off more like a failed pilot for a TV 
series than a thriller movie.

But the Celtics will be somewhat painful to watch at times in the

And don't discount Jiri Welsch who they picked up in that deal.
I think the Celtics imagine a really good starting lineup

But it isn't that good yet until Welsch and Banks mature.

Fla back in Aug when they were fighting to get the playoff spot and then 
Lowell got hurt. And they still won it and the playoffs. Give credit where 
credit is due.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((John Caruso, THE WIMP, nailed it cold where I did not.
He figured out that the Marlins were going places LONG before
I did.
I didn't figure it out until they beat the Cubs, though I should have
figured it out when they beat my Giants!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Looking over Fla - good young pitching, speed, defense, a good C and some 
underrated players. But you can't overlook the C, Pudge Rodriguez. His game 
calling is what made the difference.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((That's for darned sure, plus his clutch hitting.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for the other things you commented on in your zine-I like the wild 
card format. If they win the series, they deserve it. Its no easy task 
winning when you have no homefield advantage. Though it's not basketball or 
football, being home team is an advantage. Just ask Col, or Mon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If Fla keeps their team together, they could be around for a while. Don't 
forget, they played all year without their ace-AJ Burnett. Take Lowe away 
from Bos, or maybe even Pedro. Do they make the wild card without Pedro?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Next year, I would say they would, with Schilling. 
But that happened after your note.
Schilling, of course, is an avid games player, including Diplomacy.
Back in 1999, he said, "Playing classic strategy games like Advanced Squad Leader 
and Diplomacy has helped me learn to focus, made me more competitive and 
enhanced my ability to fully prepare for a game, which is essential to 
my professional career," said Schilling. "I’ve been playing games 
since I was young. Classic strategy games like Advanced Squad Leader 
and Diplomacy have helped me approach batters differently and more 
strategically," said Schilling.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
As for the Yankees, unfortunately, it will take a while before they don't 
make the playoffs. Posada, Williams, Jeter, Johnson, Giambi are a nice core.
Soriano, but he is probably expendable if they get a 2b in the offseason. 
Pitching has Rivera, Pettitte, Mussina, Contreras. That's a long term solid 
team.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Braves can't go away quick enough for me. They are cheaping out in 
payroll and still hang around. That's how good they are. And each year we hear 
how they are struggling, with the best record in the NL. Yeah, they struggle 
to put together more than 2-8 game winning streaks a year. When they let 
Maddux go, they will no longer make the playoffs. They will make an effort to 
get Millwood back, but since they've been cheaping out lately, they'll lose 
Maddux and probably not get Millwood. Plus Sheffield is likely to go 
elsewhere. Their other core players aren't as good or as numerous as the 
Yankees, so they will fall from the playoff picture quicker-maybe this year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

overall class. "Tuscan Sun", by far the best chick flick. And if you're into 
horror, "Creepers 2", tho I didn't neccessarily think it was a good picture. 
I'm sure horror enthusists loved it. Like they loved Freddie vs Jason. Again, 
it was entertaining, but hardly a good flick. "T-3" was a dud in my book.

<br /><br /><b>Mark D Lew (Tue, 25 Nov 2003 01:13:01 -0800)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Responding to: "The A's are sending Ramon and T. Long to the Padres 
for outfielder Mark Kotsay. Plus, they traded Ted Lilly
to the Blue Jays for outfielder Bobby Kielty; they get cash or another
player later."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wow.  I'll have to read the website to get the details.  It's been 
about two weeks since I checked in.
I expect to stay an A's fan for as long as Billy Beane is with the 
team.  After that, we'll see.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Funny about Kotsay and Kielty.  During the 2002 season, when I was 
following closely, one of the topics that came up with the post-game 
show crowd was regarding trades. At the time, the team needed a hitter 
and a center fielder. A lot of the casual fans have stupid ideas about 
trading - suggesting big star names who aren't available and couldn't 
be afforded even if they were - but to the fans who understood how 
trading really works and how the A's organization works, the question 
was posed about who we thought the A's could/should/would go after.  
The host of the show proposed Mark Kotsay, whom I was unfamiliar with 
because he was in the NL.  I proposed Kielty, who at the time was going 
to waste platooning in Minnesota because they already had such a full 
outfield.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kotsay and Kielty are both &#196;'s-style" hitters.  High OBP, patient, 
etc.  I don't know when Kielty moved from the Twins to the Jays.
<i>((It was a trade deadline deal last year.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Trading T Long was a foregone conclusion. Even before he publicly 
requested it, it was clear that he wasn't fitting well with the team. 
His personality has always made him a bit of an outsider in the club 
house - quiet, soft-spoken country boy, conservative in the 
non-political sense. On the field, he was an experiment. Someone 
thought he could be a patient-hitting center-fielder, but the former 
was only half successful and the latter was a failure. In retrospect it 
looks like Howe had a lot to do with the team staying interested in T 
Long. It was when Macha took over that Long started to get pushed aside.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The A's cardinal rule in trading is that when someone is more valuable 
elsewhere than he is here, you move him.  Long is still talented, but 
his talent was going to waste here, so he needed to move. The only 
obstacle was that his salary didn't make him a great buy for another 
team, but I guess they found a buyer.  I think he'll do better in the 
NL. Long has the potential to be a great stealer, but the A's never 
pursued really pursued that.  My guess is the Padres leave him in LF 
but convert him to a big-swinging lead-off hitter in the style of 
Alfonso Soriano.
<i>((I agree with that latter point.
The Padres are willing to spend a little extra money as they
move into their new stadium.
Don't be shocked if they get in the Nomar Garciaparra sweepstakes
if Nomar reacts poorly to the overtures for contract extensions that
the Red Sox will be making to him next week.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Trading Ramon surprises and saddens me. Perhaps it's connected to the 
Rick Peterson move. Peterson is our pitching coach, who was recently 
allowed to join the Mets (with Howe). The A's didn't have to let 
Peterson go, and the general impression was that it was done as a 
personal favor to Peterson who had family reasons to want to be in New 
York. A's are big on being good about personal needs, and presumably 
they got some sort of compensation from the Mets to make it worthwhile. 
With Ramon going, too, the question is whether this will be a departure 
from the large-scale strategy on pitching which has served the team so 
well, or if it's just a changing of the guard and the philosophy is 
still in place.  Peterson was not the only pitch-wonk in the 
organization; surely there must be someone in the minor leagues who is 
helping to produce all those great pitchers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ditto for the catcher position. I have no idea who they have in mind to 
replace Ramon. Melhuse has been solid as back-up, but I don't think 
he's the starter of the future.  I'll bet they've got someone in mind 
in the minors - probably someone well-trained in calling games and 
prepping with the pitchers like Ramon was. This could be part of a 
general plan to prepare for the post-Mulder-Hudson-Zito era. A's are 
always planning ahead, and the new guard of pitchers are beginning to 
come up now. Harden will be a starter this year, and with Lilly gone, 
Duchscherer might well  be on the team as well.
<i>((I think you're wrong about that, I think they DO have Melhuse 
in mind for the position.
Time will tell, of course.
But Ramon went with the Beane philosophy as you just espoused it.
He became worth more as trade bait than he was to the A's.
Maybe Kotsay is THAT much of a real find.
It wouldn't shock me if Beane was right that he is ready to have
a real breakout season.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Trading Lilly for Kielty is interesting.  Blue Jays and A's are 
practically business partners, in the way they move players back and 
forth. Toronto GM Ricciardi was trained by Billy Beane and they tend to 
think alike. If they made this move, it means that they both like both 
players but they agree that Lilly is worth more to Toronto than he is 
to Oakland and Kielty is worth more to Oakland than he is to Toronto. 
Thus they made the deal to maximize overall efficiency of both teams, 
with the cash to balance out the difference.
<i>((Absolutely right, and Lilly was going to be the fifth starter
for the A's, but the third starter for the Blue Jays.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
-

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Later:  A's website says the deal with the Padres is pending medical 
checks on Kotsay, so it's not final yet.  I see that the Padres are 
prepared to take over Long's entire $8 million contract. Given that 
Oakland doesn't want to play Long anymore anyway, they'd probably be 
happy to unload him for nothing.  My guess is that Hernandez is what 
the Padres really want, and their willingness to take Long in the deal 
is more like a concession than an additional demand.
<i>((It is NOW final.... and yes, the Padres have more money to spend,
but not THAT much more money.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If someone wanted to take over Jermaine Dye's contract, I bet we'd 
unload him, too.  Not that the A's won't play Dye - indeed, I think 
they'll build the whole lineup around him in 04 - but he's definitely 
overpaid.  If we could have the money back and start over with cheaper 
guys, I'm sure we would.

Subject: Re: 21 grams

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Very positive buzz for this film.  Apparently Naomi Watts is
fantastic.
<i>((You Naomi Watts fan you..... yes, I'm one too.  I mean to see
this movie this weekend.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Can the Sox really trade Manny for ARod?  Will they get Schilling? 
If they get ARod, will they trade Nomar?  Will they get Foulke to
close?  If yes, will Kim stick around as a starter, or did his antics
in the playoffs doom him in Boston?
The team could look very different next year.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I like the idea that the team will look different.  
The Boston Globe (Gordon Edes) says its a domino thing.... that
they will make the deal with Schilling and get Foulke to agree
to the deal.  THEN, if they do that, their salaries are too high
and they trade Manny for ARod and then trade Nomar off to the
West Coast for prospects, with the possibility that those two
deals are linked in a three way so that it can't be announced
until they are sure they are getting Schilling and Foulke.
They've already told Kim to do his winter work to prepare to
be the fifth starter (Wakefield, Martinez and Lowe being the
other three after Schilling).  Apparently the braintrust really
DOES still like Kim (though I have heard some rumblings that he
might be on the trading block in this "cost saving case" along
with Damon).  I approve
and am excited about these moves, not least of which that Schilling
is a Diplomacy player so that we can invite him to our FTF
gatherings.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Invite Naomi Watts while you're at it!
<i>((Somehow my wife doesn't share my fascination with Naomi,
she keeps calling her a cheap Nicole Kidman knockoff with blonde hair.
She even made me turn off her interview with Jay Leno the other
night at the first commercial break!
Somehow I haven't gotten Charlotte to come with me to see 21 grams
yet either.
But I will, I'll find some other way to sell it.
Then if I can just stop her from wanting to walk out....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've thought many a time of inviting the President, the Speaker of
the House, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, and
similar people to PTKS meetings.  :)

On the Slashdot.org blog, I saw these tongue-in-cheek examples of 
"security holes in Linux which do not occur in Windows":

<div class="p"><!----></div>
* Linux is more stable, thereby giving crackers more time to break 
passwords.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
* By not fixing things, Microsoft Windows causes crackers to become 
lazy and slothful, so when a patch does arrive, the cracker won't be 
expecting it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
* Many Linux distros use MD5 hashing for passwords, which is much 
slower than just storing in plain text, making it possible to run a 
denial-of-service against a Linux box.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
* By renaming COMMAND.COM to CMD.EXE, Windows is secure against DOS 
attacks. At least, those up to 6.22.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
* Windows cannot trigger world chaos in safe mode. It's disabled.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
* By using all available memory, Windows cannot run additional viruses.

<br /><br /><br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Like most other games in <i>TAP</i>, I name them after songs
by my favorite band, the Mekons.  This one is taken
from their album <i>Me</i>.  The lyrics for "Flip Flop"
are as follows:
"He's a little boy so lovely to watch and he's got
great respect; You boys don't know what pain is, just 
flip flop mate.  Enter the sentimental chamber
shifting magnetic core; Cranium flipping over taking me
back to year one; Taking me back to year one.
Oh so innocent in appearance the wonders of the space age;
It's so hard to forget sexual experience, sexual chain 
reactions; Taking me back to year one."
This is a slow patient song, sung with lots of noise
to fight through, like a good Dip game, which I hope
this will be.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Positions were determined by lot, as you all didn't
submit preference lists:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) I wanted to get this started quickly, so you all should 
have been notified about this game start already.  
You can submit Winter
press with the December 13th deadline and Spring 1901 orders
will be due January 10th.  I like to give a good while to
get a game started.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) It's been awhile since I've printed my house rules, so
I've included them in this issue (if I remember).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
5) I got VERY lax about noting which of you had paid for this
game.
The games in <i>TAP</i> go a long way toward supporting the
rest of the szine.
And I can't seem to recall which of you have paid.
If you haven't paid, please send along $20, $15 for the life
of the game subscription, which means that you get the postal
version of the szine until the game ENDS and I publish the 
endgame stats, regardless of what happens to you in the game.
The other five dollars are for NMR insurance, where I subtract
a dollar for each time I have to call you for orders.
As noted above, I know I have money from Alexandre and Karl.
That's why their NMR insurance balance is up there.
I try to get orders by E-Mail, which won't cost you from this
fund, but one of our players does not have E-Mail.
And yes, for those who asked, our E-Mail-less player Jeff
O'Donnell is Sean O'Donnell's uncle.  
I allow players in my szine to play in games with relatives.
You guys deal with that however makes sense to you in the 
context of the game.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The Italian/Turkish dual monarchy, otherwise
known as an IT draw was rejected.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I get properly chastised below for my error.... why 
I should be praised, it allowed you to put your own units
on the map.... but no chastisement is my lot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IRON DUCK to LOST IN SPACE GM): The danger is not, alas, to Will 
Robinson, but to your long-suffering players.
No sooner do I articulate my intent to have you booted post-haste
from the Hobby as if you were Liza Minnelli's husband-like-substance
as a danger to yourself and others, than you prove my point in 
spades by deliberately voiding our map of any and all units.
Not only are you guilty of ineptitude and gross malfeasance,
you are also guilty of one of the most blatant instances of GM 
interference ever recorded in the Hobby's maculate and shady
history!
You put all those units back right now, Mister, or I will convene
a Board of Obvious Obstructionist Bungling (BOOB) led by a
specially appointed Special Inquisitor.
I'll just bet I can pull Mark Berch out of retirement for this one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to BOOB): Bring 'em on, I can take 'em!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to GM): On the other hand, maybe you've got something here....
how about you leave off all the other units <i>except</i> the German
ones for about, say, five years?
I'm sure I could see my way toward sparing you the ignominious
spectacle of having you removed from the Hobby.
Have your people get in touch with my people and we'll do a workaround.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to PEOPLE): You stay RIGHT where you are....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SAUGUS to GAME): Admit it - for a second you thought we'd all
warped into a particularly lethal game of Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire
Diplomacy where all the units got nuked on the same turn.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PROVIDENCE to SAUGUS): I admit to nothing, except that you are
a thorn in my side.  And it's about to get worse, since you're
about to address my wife, aren't you??
I also will admit that you are about to toss off another lame
witticism that she's heard a billion times before.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IRON DUCK to SWEET CHARLOTTE): Hush, hush!
You are too seemly a soul, too comely a woman, 
to turn away from all men forever.
(Given a logical progression from swearing off men - and
being somewhat averse to women as you said - you severely
limit your options... and said options are illegal, generally,
and almost always unsanitary.)
Besides, we don't think it fair of you to judge all men everywhere
on the basis of your experience with you-know-who.
<i>((I assure you that she's been nowhere near Voldemort!))</i>
I mean, really, don't you think your judgment would be severely
impaired by the fact that...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB INTERRUPTS WITH IMPUGNITY): OK, that's enough.  The only
thing that impairs my judgment is the snoozing that I do reading
your soporific press.
You aren't getting any interest out of Charlotte either.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(IRON DUCK to BOOB): Look, Your Heinous, if you aren't any
better as a man than you are as a GM, no wonder poor
sweet, innocent Charlotte is considering the convent.
Really, Boob, you'd drive anyone into a bad habit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(OFFSTAGE SOUND EFFECT): Ba-dum-bump!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to IRON BILLED ONE): Just you try to pick a 
peck of pickled peppers with that Bill.  Then you 
see who marches to the beat of a different drummer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EDINBURGH-PARIS/BERLIN): I'm in.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to HAGGIS BREATH): I'm not sure that's what we meant....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY-WORLD): This should be interesting.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to TURKEY): Of course we can all get along...
but what's the fun in that?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ITALY to EGREGIOUS-FLUB PRODUCER):  There must have been a printing 
error:  All the unit-position indicator letters are missing from the 
2001D map in my copy of TAP issue 275.  Would you please come to Spencer 
and make the corrections to my game report map?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ITALY): There are no printing errors, sometimes you
just have to "do it yourself".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN to PARIS): Someone recently asked us how many
French troops it took to defend Paris.
We concluded that we didn't know as it had never been tried...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY, SINGING TO HIMSELF):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Sundstrom on my shoulder makes me happy,
Sundstrom in my eyes can make me cry;

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Sundstrom almost always looks so lovely, 
Sundstrom almost always makes me high....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Oops!
Think I may have just been channeling John Denver.
Sigh.... you have a mere dalliance with controlled substances
for 20 years or so, and <i>this</i> is what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DON to BOOB): I wouldn't live to tell the tale, huh?
You bragging or what?
We're not all the pushover that you are, Burgess....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DON): Go ahead, make my day....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILLIAMS to RAUTERBERG): Burgess really sucks for doing this to you, doesn't he?
Still, tortured logic or not, I have to agree that you are a 1000%
improvement over....well, you know.
So, hang tight, the Cavalry is on its way!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to DON AND PAUL): Paul is NOT dead, in fact we love
having him available, were I to have five other standbys like him!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN to LONDON): There you have it-those pesky exchange students in
Denmark have now been explained away by our illustrious GM; 
they are militant US medical students from Grenada, armed and trained 
by... well, not us anyway, probably the CIA.
Last we heard, said students - still heady from their stunning
victory in Denmark - had become further radicalized, going so
far as to organize themselves for the furtherance of their 
political and social agenda; they are now calling themselves
Students for a Despotic Society, and they espouse the liberal
rantings of former Chancellor Otto von Bismarck.
We seriously recommend you send an envoy immediately so
that we may convene a special commission to study
that evolving issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SDS to EUROPE): We're mad as hell and we're not going to
take it any more!
First on our agenda, that hotbed of liberal nanny-state-ism,
Sweden!
First Stockholm, then the world!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIEL to NAPLES): So, Mike, what would it really take to get
you turned around to face the music coming from the minarets?
Do we have to drag your sorry butt into a special effects
movie and let you pick between the red pill and the blue pill?
Free your mind, Neo.... er, Barno.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE to CITY PLANNER DON):  You should spend as many resource points as 
necessary to convert Army Denmark into a fleet.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MORPHEUS THE DUCK to PROVIDENCE): Great costume I got here with
the shades and leather duster, eh pal?
Shhhhh!
Don't let on to these guys just who I really am, and especially
don't clue in that loser Williams.
You wanna be the Oracle, pal o'mine?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PROVIDENCE to DUCK DIMENSIONS): I don't talk to third rate movie
rejects who promise existential truth and deliver third rate 
pablum.
This only makes those people think they're being arch and edgy
when they're really just being lame.
If you want REAL sedition, I'll give you real sedition.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MATT-JIM-BOB): So much for the Cubs-Sox World Series of futility.  
I was thinking you had to have the same feeling in the 8th inning of 
game 7 as we had in the 8th inning of game 6.  How to deflate a town 
in less than ten minutes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to MATT): You wouldn't guess that Williams is nominally
a Red Sox fan too, would you?
Let's take this up a level and see what monstrous charge he
goes to next....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SAUGUS to PROVIDENCE): Dear Mr. Boob, please be 
advised that your comments last issue (see "Unique View of Time")
constitute a direct violation of secret provisions of the recently
enacted Patriot's Act, and that your comments are seditious
and subversive and reflect the insane, unlawful, and prosecutable
offerings of a psychotic malcontent.
Lest you wish to be prosecuted, please get on your knees, face Texas,
and chant "Bush, Cheney, Rummy are, the very, very best by far."
Failure to do so will result in the suspension of whatever of 
your civil rights we haven't yet taken.
Can you spell Guantanamo Bay?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB REPEATS HIMSELF JUST <b>ONE</b> MORE TIME): Go ahead, make my day....
come and get me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMAN SHEPHERD to YIPPY ITALIAN LAP DOG): Better to die on your paws
than to live on your knees.
Sic 'em!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to PROVIDENCE): Do dogs have knees?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PROVIDENCE to GERMANY): Yes, of course dogs have a patella or kneecap.
Whether they can "kneel" in submission is irrelevant since lap dogs
find a way to be submissive regardless of whether they can kneel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to SWEET CHARLOTTE): More interestingly, does Boob have knees
and do you make him get down on them and, if so, how often?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to PHILANDERING MINDS): If you think I'm going to assist you in
this in ANY way whatsoever, you are oh so sadly mistaken.
Go get your own answers, if you dare.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BLAH BLAH BLAH):  Major League Baseball $ucks.  NASCAR kicks baseball's 
butt.  Steve Emmert underestimated:  In this final year of Winston Cup, 
there were 25 to 30 teams that were legitimate threats to win each week 
(depending on the track), and with 43 to 50 teams trying for 43 starting 
spots, the next ten to fifteen cars (sometimes all 43) were good enough 
that they could win if they lucked up hard enough.  Seventeen drivers 
won races in the just-concluded 2003 season's 36 races.  Matt Kenseth 
won the championship with only one victory but 25 top-ten finishes.  So 
many good cars ran every race that three of the race winners ended up 
25th through 27th overall without missing any races.  When was 
big-league baseball ever deep enough that the Cubs and a few other teams 
weren't out of it by the All-Star break?

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY, TRYING TO SURVIVE UNTIL A DRAW VOTE PASSES):  "Diplomacy is 
about surviving until the next century. Politics is about surviving 
until Friday afternoon." - Sir Humphrey Appleby

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY):  Believe me, I don't take Phil's press ("despicable", only 
"honorable thing") as more than a platter of cow's tongue.  Why would I 
be vetoing the draw I scrambled to get into?  I'm earning standby 
freebies from another game that will last far longer than this one is 
likely to.  For Turkey to remove me from FREGT voting would not change 
the vote's outcome, and whether he's been vetoing it or not, he knows 
that I haven't.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY):  Of course I have been voting YES YES and YES to the five-way 
draw since it was first proposed, and voted NO to the draws that 
excluded me just on the general principle.  I'm sure even the renowned 
moralist and serial zine folder Tsar Phil considers the Draws Include Me 
rule to be a Good Thing; he has thus pontificated in print.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) A couple of adjudication notes.... when you guys nuke the same province more
than once, I put in parentheses the number of nukes that hit that spot.
Also, if your move to a space succeeds and THEN you are annihilated, I 
capitalize the first letter of that space where you are annihilated.
The reverse happens if your move bounces where I capitalize the first
letter of the place you started.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The rules I have been using for this game have been that there are no replacements
or standbies.
Nukes for the positions John has will remain unfired in their silos.
None of his units will move or support anything.
They can be attacked and dislodged and his centers can be nuked.
John could win the game this way, conceivably, but likely would not.
But you never know, given how extreme the yuppiedom part of the game
has gone.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I'm keeping only one list for the new game now up above.
This is scary, the game has gone on for six years now, hasn't it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): "Lost there for a lifetime,
late in the evening you pull on your bra; Your pull on a
hand you go out the room; Go out the door, watching and counting
and sex and TV." From "Enter the Lists" off of <i>Me</i>.
This is the record with my FAVORITE song title of all time,
"Come and Have A Go, If You Think You're Hard Enough"....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG, THE END IS NEAR): The combined Romulan/Klingon
forces are approaching the solar system and the end of the 
Federation is near.
I would like to offer a commendation to my crew and command
staff for its bravery in the line of dut...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to CAPTAIN): Humph, Spock would never give up, after
all there are always alternatives.... but wait a minute,
what's that I hear??

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LT. UHURA): Bridge to Captain Kirk!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): What now, the Borg?!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LT. UHURA): No, Captain!
I'm picking up a distress signal!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): Probably Captain Janeway at the front.
You know she did a nice job getting home in Voyager,
but her ship was taken over by so many hostile aliens
that Starfleet Command changed Chief of Security Officer
Tuvok's title to Hospitality Officer!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(LT. UHURA): The distress call appears to be coming from
the Romulan ship, "The Pointy Eared Bastard".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): (Looking at Mr. Spock) Spock, what do you think the 
"Bastard" is up to?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Is it possible that Janeway's attack was successful?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): I don't see how!
All she had was Voyager and Mr. Sulu's "Excelsior".
They were outgunned 4-2.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UHURA): I'm getting a message from the Klingons.
It's 7 of 9.  Have negotiated an alliance with the
Klingons.
Khitamer Accord back in place, am assisting Janeway
and Sulu with two Klingon heavy cruisers and have
engaged the Romulans.
Neither side has gained any territory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): Spock!
I'm confused.
I thought that our scans indicated the Klingons were being
run by the Evil Commander Worf!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): He's evil, but he is not stupid.
Even with his help, if we don't get Bajor and Cardassia
to unite with us, the Romulans will still rule the galaxy.
On the other hand, this is great news.
The Federation is at least for the moment safe and we
are still free.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): But that's not the best part!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SPOCK): Then what is "the best part"?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIRK): When 7 of 9 returns, I get to de-brief her.
Life is good!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EGYPT - BRITAIN): No doubt Germany made a mistake moving into 
your waters, but if you continue your alliance with Ukraine, he wins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EGYPT to GERMANY): No doubt Sean screwed up when he attacked
you and me, but our choice is to unite against Ukraine or
the game is over.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(EGYPT to SPAIN): I luv ya man!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to THE WORLD): The Yankees suck!
Grady Little is clueless!
Lebron James will someday be known as the greatest point guard ever.
Not this or next year, but eventually.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to UNCLE JEFFY): Yeah, the Celtics shut down Lebron completely
last night (as I type this), but I agree with you.
Your other statements, while laudable on the surface, are more
emotional and extreme than this Red Sox fan prefers.
I think the Yankees are a very good team, but other then Derek
Jeter they lack the real balls to win titles as a team.
They're just a collection of big contracts.
I hope they don't get Schilling from the Diamondbacks, since
he'll be the leader that none of this year's starters could muster.
And on Grady, let me tell you about Grady.
Grady has always been a manager of his own mind, always.
In the minors, you have many fewer coaches and less scrutiny,
but he always had the rep (and occasionally was fired over it)
of not listening to anyone but himself.
Given that, I do think he had a clue, but he needed to use the
whole team and resources that the Red Sox gave him.
Ultimately, while perhaps that also led to his downfall ON
the field, it ensured his downfall OFF the field.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(UKRAINE - SPAIN): So, the magic 8 ball said attack Ukraine this turn?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): I love what the Red Sox did to Manny Ramirez.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to UNCLE JEFFY): You mean put him on unconditional waivers?
It's too bad no one took him, 'cause then the Red Sox would have
executed the deal to get A-Rod and that would have more than 
sufficed.
Now, they probably will not do any big deals.
But I still like them for next year.
Please, please, Mr. Epstein, don't trade my Trot!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DAVE - SEAN): It is often misquoted.  The proper text is "Needless consistency
is the hobgoblin of little minds".  Note the key word "Needless", consistency
in and of itself is not a bad thing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JEFF to JIM): I'll give you Matt Lawton, Ricky Gutierrez, 
and Milton Bradley for Manny Ramirez.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to UNCLE JEFFY): But the Indians won't.
