<br /><br />Well, for a variety of reasons, we're late again.... a little bit of work, 
a little bit of fun, and a little bit of being a new grandfather (she's a
beautiful little girl baby named Emily....), but hopefully back on track.
Also, the new issue of <i>Diplomacy World</i> is out since we last got together
(check it out at www.diplomacyworld.org or on the Zines page at <i>the Pouch</i> (back
up one level from <i>TAP</i>).
And please vote in the 2004 Diplomacy Hobby Awards
The ballot was announced in <i>Diplomacy World</i> about a month ago, and now
the deadline is popping right up on February 26th, I already have over 40 ballots in,
add yours to the pile!!!
I want to get the results out in the next <i>Diplomacy World</i> and have them announced
at DipCon - DipAtSea, though I won't be going.
If you're seeing this in the postal version, the ballot is included, if on
the web, you'll find the ballot at:
 /Postal/Zines/TAP/2004HobbyAwards.pdf

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Also, Tim Snyder is finishing up the new issue of the <i>Zine Register</i>
and so that should be out shortly.
Finally, Tom Howell has returned from his six month hiatus and so 
I can get a Boardman Number for my new game!!!
And his szine should be out shortly.
I have a couple of other letters, including one from Doug Kent, that I'm going to have to 
hold until next time, as we really must get this puppy out the door tonight!!!

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other rooreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Or you can play in subszines for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He is now hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date is now a "whenever".
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge are picking up the choo-choo

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR JOHN SMYTHE</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm about to start putting some Golden Agers in here to hunt for, starting
with someone who SHOULD be relatively easy to find, since he's been "around"
in recent years, and then working up to some REAL, REAL hard people to find
culminating in the 300th issue person whom I already have in mind.
So, let's really find John, I'll be shocked if you can't do it, and
it's worth fifty bucks!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:
Map Collection, ERC Library, University of Melbourne, Vic 3010, AUSTRALIA.
That's a relatively new address adjustment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<b>WITH comments by Dave Partridge (DP) and Rick Desper (RD)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Happy Freakin' New Year!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((DP: To you as well.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((RD: And to all.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This just in:  the Yankees just signed Randy Johnson.
<i>((Like the Mets with Pedro, they signed an old pitcher for
a lot of money who may not play up to that money for 
the length of the contract.
I wish them luck, they'll need it.
You need to listen to Mark Lew and Billy Beane.... the key here
is that the Yankees CAN spend the money, and they DO, and it 
buys them a CERTAIN level of success, but NOT the whole enchilada.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Ah, another chance to complain about the Haves and Have-Nots.  I think 
that my plan for last year makes sense:  the Red Sox and Yankees should 
just start in April playing a Best-of-25 against each other and call it a 
season.  No need for the Devil Rays, Royals, Tigers, etc. to print 
tickets, let alone get their uniforms dirty.  It appears that the "luxury 
tax" plan in MLB has failed in a way no one foresaw:  it ensured that only 
a couple of teams would be able to pay it.  There's still no way the 
playing field becomes level until a salary cap happens.  I realize that 
those of you on the East Coast don't care that only East Coast teams can 
buy players, but the purist in me kinda rebels against this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((DP: Says who? I think a salary cap is a good idea and should be implemented
soonest, along with a ticket price cap and a concession price cap!))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Jim-Bob dittos that....))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((RD: Or at least a souvenir cap price cap.  :)  ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Jim-Bob nixes that, he would prefer to outlaw baseball caps except
on the Baseball field, or at bonafide Baseball events like at the
Baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown (that's the only place us fans
should be allowed to wear baseball caps..... wanting to start the
capanazi movement!))</i> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This just in:  the Red Sox just got an option on every starter in this 
year's College World Series.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Earth to Goz, Earth to Goz, there still is a North American
draft in major league baseball, and signing free agents loses you
these draft choices.... so no whey hosea on that just out.
Now, if you wanted to complain about the Red Sox, Mets and Anaheim
cornering the market on Dominican Republic players, you would have
a case, and something needs to be done about that, especially 
enforcing the age restrictions, but you're going to go on and 
complain about something else....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Anaheim Angels have become the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim.  If 
smaller market teams want to compete, will we see the "Missouri Cardinals 
of St. Louis sponsored by Budweiser"?  Would the Kansas City Royals 
complain about that one, or get paid not to?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Nice try, but this one WILL be struck down in the courts before 
it's done.  They should keep going after BETTER Latin players, that's
more important, see Mark Lew elsewhere in this issue.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This just in:  George Steinbrenner just bought the rights to the Little 
League World Series players.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Again, for US not relevant, and for the others let him have them.
Those Little League World Series players tend to peak too soon and there
aren't really all that many of them starring in MLB.
Little League is another thing that has its own hype problems.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I saw the latest <i>TAP</i> on-line the other day, and one of your throw-in lines 
mixed in with my conversation with Rick Desper puzzled me:  Kurt Busch did 
NOT have the NASCAR title sewn up until he completed the last lap of the 
last race, so I can't see where you think he "locked it up early".  He won 
by 8 points, or less than 2 positions over 36 races.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((So sue me.... this new system made enough of a dent on me so I 
knew who won, but it seemed to me like he had it wrapped up pretty early.
I clearly was wrong, but really don't care enough to figure it out....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Although NASCAR 
implemented a playoff system last year, their regular season actually 
counts for something (and their All-Star races don't).  You also see large 
battles among drivers to get in the top 20.  What other sport has that? 
Goz prediction for 2005:  Jeff Gordon wins his 5th title.  Bear in mind my 
prediction for 2004 had Ryan Newman winning it, and he finished 7th.  I do 
a lot better picking MLB.  Of course, it's much easier to do that too...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((DP: The NFL?  There was an awful lot still up in the air for the last weekend.
And tell me who had their money on Pittsburgh and San Diego this year?))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((RD: By the end of the season I did.  (See Tinamou simple fantasy football
league.) ))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This just in:  John Henry just sent a scout to the Andromeda Galaxy with a 
personal message from Schilling.
<i>((No problem, by the time he gets back, our sun will have blown up to
a red giant and we'll all be living on Titan, looks balmy there, don't it?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Who are these upstart Mets anyway?  First they land Martinez, now it looks 
like they'll get Beltran.  They may undo the balance of power in the City 
of New York.  Look for the Mets to contend for the Wild Card this year.
<i>((I think that's right, but they NEED to shoot their wad this year
since it will be downhill for most of these guys (except Beltran) from here.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This just in:  George Steinbrenner just bought the Dominican Republic.
<i>((Wrong guy, George hasn't learned where the Dominican Republic IS yet.))</i>
Have a good one!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had Pittsburgh at #27 on my list at the start of the year.  I had San 
Diego #31.  I'll elaborate to the Tinamou FFL group with my playoff picks, 
but this is kinda my point for MLB:  in the NFL it's not so much that 
teams *can* come out of nowhere to make the playoffs and get to the Super 
Bowl, it's that it happens every year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While there *was* a lot in the air in the NFL for this past weekend, I 
don't think it compares, as the season is only 16 games vs. 162.  With 10 
to go in MLB there were still a lot of (rich) teams that could make the 
playoffs (Cubs, Giants, etc.).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Another great quote from Billy Beane.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
An interviewer asked him if, when trading players, he takes into 
account how marketable the player is to the fans in terms of selling 
more tickets.  His answer:
"I've always thought the best marketing tool for a team is the wins 
and losses.  [...]  Let's face it, if you signed Barney the Dinosaur to 
play left field for you, you'd probably have a good crowd one day, but 
they might not come back the second."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It's a serious answer, though.  The idea is that as an engine for 
selling tickets, a star player is only a short-term asset, whereas a 
good W-L record is lasting.

<i>((You guys haven't heard me say much about college basketball this year, since
it pretty much is a lost year in Rhode Island, but something very interesting has
been happening with Providence College.
First off, they scheduled the second toughest schedule by the RPI after Kansas to this
point, and I think they'll have the toughest schedule by year end.
At that they are playing .500 ball with their "stay for his senior year and play for
a better draft position" star Ryan Gomes.
I still remember Gomes playing such a brilliant Big East center position at 6'6"
in his freshman year, but he's spent most of the year trying to show the NBA scouts
how he's a small forward or shooting guard making about 10% of his threes.... 
while PC point guard Donnie McGrath was shooting the same until about a week ago
until he lit on fire, in his last game against Virginia he tied an NCAA record with 
9 of 9 three pointers as Ryan went back inside where he belongs.
Gosh, you wish these guys would just play college ball for now, but you know why they don't.))</i>

We have a new game start below.
I am willing to open another new game if there is enough interest!!!
Also, is there any interest in another game of Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire 
7x7 Dip?
I know it may be getting tired, but I really like it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
I'll publish the rules shortly or you can look at them at
www.variantbank.com.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
I'll try to remember to punch in the rules in the next issue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
John Harrington is offering to guest GM a game of Office Politics.
Any interest in that??

and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need two more players.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Games in <i>TAP</i> generally are names after songs by the band, the
Mekons, and this game will not be an exception.
I thought it would be fun to name this one "Spirals of Paranoia", I've
meant to use that one as a game name for some time.
"Spirals of Paranoia" is a song on the country punk record 
<i>Retreat from Memphis</i>.
This song has a spiraling structure that builds up tension as you
might expect.
I was going to choose the next song on the record, "Missing You All",
which is about the most depressing, lonely, isolated Delta Blues
song I've ever heard.... brilliant.
But we'll go with "Spirals of Paranoia".
Not to say I'm trying to create anything, but this IS Diplomacy.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I want to do an update on the House Rules, so I'll do that in the next
issue.
We did have preference lists from everyone, so they were used to do the
draw.
Tom Howell, may we have a Boardman Number please??

(STAR TREK PRESS - EPISODE 9 MESSAGE UNDERSTOOD?): 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Lt. Uhura (U) - Captain, I'm getting a message off the 
subspace compic.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Kirk (K) - Can you make out who and where it originates from?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
U - This is confusing, Captain.
It originates from the home world of the "Children of Tamari"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - In our universe, they are more advanced than we are, but the
universal translator can't comprehend their language.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
U - That's what's confusing, Captain; the message came in thru
the translator perfectly clear.
They are interested in an alliance.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - What do you think, Spock?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mr. Spock (S) - Their initiative is a pleasant surprise
but they are too far out to help us right now.
On the other hand, they are wiping out the Klingons along with
the Vulcan like race and a third still unidentified race.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
K - The Vulcan like race is the key.
If they align with the "this universe Federation" against us,
we are done no matter what assistance we receive from the
"Children of Tamari".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - Agreed!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
McCoy (M) - Spock, have you had any luck in trying to change
us back to human form?
I'm tired of being a "Ferengi".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
S - I do have a theory.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
M - Thrill me, Spock.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
I had no complaint, so I've granted a request that we go back 
to where we were on the voting, which
was this:  (1) Some of you have "perpetual draw votes on this
proposal on file", those are still in force; (2) Some of you
do not and have been voting every season, for you if you FAIL
to vote it counts as a yes vote for this proposal.
If we get to a situation where no centers change hands for
three game years, then we can go to the next step, which will
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
The upcoming Fall 1917 will be two game years by that measure.
Even if Turkey is missing TWO of its home centers in Winter 1917,
I think we are still going to advance to the next level of
voting, which is that perpetual draw votes will no longer be
allowed with failure to vote equalling a yes.
If any other significant movement or centers change hands
then that will be another story, of course.
This does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick still is way ahead of this pace).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE 25 DOLLAR QUARTET): I did have a pretty good replenishment in Breaking Away, but 
unfortunately only one of my cyclists can make it past the Sprint finish 
line.  To further muddle things, El Vez is so far back that he might not 
get any points for making it past the Sprint line.  So I'll not 
even try for points this time, and instead hope that Homer or Clay are 
at marker 70.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to THE QUARTET): Hope did not come your way, but El Vez still doesn't
have a low card.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(THE 25 DOLLAR QUARTET): El Vez plays his smallest, egad!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ZEDD  &gt;  BUTCH): Zedd ain't dead yet... but Omega is Last... Again!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to ZEDD): And why WOULDN'T Omega be last???  In any case, I think
Zedd is just as dead.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CARL SAGAN to LISA): Marker 78?  Why, it's billions and billions 
of carbon atoms here on an insignificant planet of a humdrum star lost 
in a galaxy tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which 
there are far more galaxies than people.
