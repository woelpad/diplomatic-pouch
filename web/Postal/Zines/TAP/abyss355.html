<br /><br /><b>MERRY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD NIGHT!!!</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />We continue with a NEW Kendo Nagasaki game, join ANY time, just send me a guess!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a "subszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Let's get the new Diplomacy game going.
Since Doug is winding down, I may have to flip that back around again and be
the centerpiece for all the subszines, we'll see.
My intent right now is to do that.
Feel free to communicate with me about how you want to do that, or if anyone else
wants <i>TAP</i> subszine status.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Diplom.org site has moved.  
Chris Babcock is now in charge.  It all went pretty well, all things considered, 
and most of you probably didn't even notice it was happening.  
But if you find you cannot access the website with the PDFs and HTMLs of all the
past issues... well, please let me know and we'll fix it.

Shame, shame, shame... with the move of the diplom.org site, I hope this will be

So, since I will be running TempleCon again, February 6-8, 2015, here in Providence,
let's move on to that.
It's featured at the top of the Tournament Convention site above.
Please consider coming, I have two "pay-what-you-can" hotel rooms and the

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that continues to be distorting, but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least 
another year, the finals are starting now.
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals 
are now starting, everyone has been queried.
But you also still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!
Word is we may cancel them, I think the finals should reignite interest.
We also are picking up some discussion for a successor Diplomacy World Cup.
I think we all realize that this interesting experiment has not been completely
successful.
I recently was elected to the Council for DWC IV, so if anyone has any 
ideas about where this idea should go to reinvigorate it, please let me know!

<b>Rick Desper (Wed, 10 Dec 2014 22:30:32)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Red Sox completely screwed this up by not extending Lester's contract in the 
Spring. The offer they made yesterday was worth more than twice what they were 
offering in March. So in 6 months they've gone from an all-pitching no-hitting 
team to an all-hitting no pitching team.
It's maddening.

<i>((I have a slightly nuanced take on the "mistake".  
I think from the
beginning their preference leaned more toward the acquisitions they've
just made.  But they liked Lester too and wanted to get him if they could
get him below market at their terms.  They didn't think they WOULD get
him, and the speed that they executed the alternative strategy means they
were probably thinking about it and laying the groundwork for it all
season.  I like all of the new players as possible strong members of a
balanced rotation.  They have said they need at least one more starting
pitcher, and so they do.  The general consensus, that I think is right, is
that the Spring lowball offer came from Lucchino and they had a much
higher spring number that they wanted to get to with compromise.  They
said 70 million, expected Lester to come back with 150 million or
something and then they might agree to 110 million.... in the spring.
Similarly, the 130 million offer in the fall, knowing it was way below
Chicago's offer, was an attempt to see if Lester was willing to take it.
Again, they didn't think he WOULD, but thought he might.  They really
didn't mind when he didn't take their number, since they had the
alternative plan, that they slightly preferred, in place.  You do make 130
million offers like that even if you think there's only a 2% chance they
will be taken.  I'm really fine with that.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((If they really wanted Lester, they would have offered 150 (missing 5
million plus the extra year - which they also might have offered) and I
think Lester then would have taken the Red Sox at that number.  So, they
aren't stupid, they didn't want him at that number.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I'm looking forward to the new pitchers, the new hitters, and next season.
Of course Goz will call me Poilyanna.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((PS: I think Theo's deal is about a 50-50 bet that in the long run we view
the Lester deal as worth it.  I'm with the crowd that thinks the Cubs are
at best a .500 team this year.  In 2-3 years they will be contending in a
similar manner as KC did this year, except with a 1b ace at the top of the
rotation.... maybe.  If the Cubbies win the WS and Lester takes him there,
it's definitely worth it, if he's part of that contention, it's probably
worth it.  But if he isn't there when the rest of the team is ready (50%
or so chance) then it was just an expensive distraction.))

(JIM to GANG): "People are afraid of themselves, of their own reality; 
their feelings most of all. People talk about how great love is, but that's bullshit. 
Love hurts. Feelings are disturbing. People are taught that pain is evil and dangerous. 
How can they deal with love if they're afraid to feel? Pain is meant to wake us up. 
People try to hide their pain. But they're wrong. Pain is something to carry, like a radio.
You feel your strength in the experience of pain. It's all in how you carry it. 
That's what matters. Pain is a feeling. Your feelings are a part of you. 
Your own reality. If you feel ashamed of them, and hide them, 
you're letting society destroy your reality. 
You should stand up for your right to feel your pain."

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://www.diplom.org/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) So, the pack continues to lurch very slowly toward the finish line.
By my calculations, it still likely will be Turn 16 before someone wins.

Baby Tomato starts lagging behind, and Papa Tomato gets really angry.

<br /><i>Press (Some more comments...):</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Tom Howell: Jim, I did send you a guess, but I hear an echo....   
Not that it matters, whilst I had the right place, I picked the wrong guy.
<i>((So you did, corrected above...))</i>
Sorry, haven't been very focused on this.  Too many Kendo games running.  
Don't have enough time to give all of them the attention they deserve.  
<i>((While true, and I also get confused, I'm going to start another 
one next time anyway.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doug Kent: Your clues are way too obscure and confusing.  
I generally start with either gender or approximate number of centuries 
between the guess and the secret's birth, death, etc. 
unless they have specific ties or share similar professions/reasons for fame.  
Home country etc. often follows.  
My clues must have been okay because I think in every game 
they find the person before the location.
<i>((I think you're right, I will be more "standard" this time. 
Part of the problem last time was that people went WAY off track, and 
I couldn't figure out how to get them back without being too obvious.
We'll see if I can do better.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rick Desper: I was one of many baffled by the clues.  
I'll admit that I'm a bit lazy when it comes to the early stages of the game.  
I don't quite know why I went to South America on Turn 3.  
But then everybody was going down there, which made it more and more 
likely that it was the correct continent.  I was thrown off by the gender comment.  
Only did one politician before moving to political media figures.  
By Turn 8 there was enough information that I thought the right place was in Chile.  
Still had no clue about the person, so I went with another 
non-American TV personality, Craig Ferguson.  
When I nailed the location and we got the info that somebody else had 
guessed the person, it wasn't hard to figure out it had to be Clarkson.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BTW, the clue for Turn 4 is about as unhelpful as a clue can get.  
"OK, but I am part of a larger group than that."  
I figured it was aimed at Obama, and that's why I went for Boehner, in the House.  
Turn 6's clue wasn't much better: 
"My appearances on TV are still for
entirely different reasons than yours have been, 
I have referred to something in which you appeared on my
show though."  The syntax is baffling.  
Is it "I have referred to (something in which you appeared on my show)" 
or "I have referred to (something in which you appeared) on my show."  
The former interpretation kept me away from Top Gear.  
<i>((Yeah, so I agree, my clues basically sucked, but I want to try again.
I was trying to follow what I thought were the "standard" syntax conventions,
but I think I will go for simpler clues that are much clearer.))</i>

<b>The big biennial Invitational that Chris Martin runs also is coming up in a few
weeks, I can't make that, but this should get the FTF tournament schedule off with a bang.
Go to an event near you soon, or work to re-invigorate a local hobby.  Ask if you don't
know who is around you, you might be surprised how many Diplomacy players I know everywhere.
We're also still looking for someone to organize the New England hobby more.
I'm really just too busy to do it reliably.

DiplomacyCast features Matt Shields this cast and talks about getting started
on talking about how to be a NEW tournament player.  
They also had fun talking about the 2014 fantasy Tournament Diplomacy player game
that they organized this year.
The discussion about how to get started includes the "how do you deal with 
getting carved up" in your early tournament games, but you need to own your
introduction to tournament play.
Ask about the people, and it's good to be a first timer to get people to talk
to you about the other players.
This may be obvious, but Diplomacy as a game is ALL about the people. 
That's what makes it great and different.
Tournaments can move fast, so you have to get used to thinking quickly and
read players in person, which is completely different from reading them on line.
DiplomacyCast is a lot
of fun, so listen to those if you haven't:</b>
