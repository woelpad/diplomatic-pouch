<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.  
Join the tidal wave of Dippers going to 
World DipCon in Chicago in August, we can overwhelm Shark Chum with 330 warm bodies!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: http://www.diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug will keep us on schedule so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have now tried to sign up all the players, some multiple times, but please check.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing so you get proper notification!!!

Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Too bad about SU in the tournament.  
It was frustrating that Fab Melo was ruled ineligible right before the start.  
I think they would have beaten Ohio State with him, 
but it is doubtful they could have beaten Kentucky.  
It was also too bad that the reffing was all so awful in the Ohio State game.  
We didn't lose because of it, but it really killed the flow of the game.  
There were just so many horrible calls on both teams!   
The good news is that SU will be good again next year - likely 
a top 10, but not a top 5 team.  We have talent at every position. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mets are off to a good start, but I can't see how it can last.

Around here, Providence College is trying to find a frontcourt (St. John's
won out for the two forwards they were competing for), but you don't care,

Jim,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A few responsive comments on the baseball predictions:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The Cardinals once again are in first place in the NL Central 
(won tonight to go 10-4) and the rest of the division seems to 
be faltering (and the Cubs are already hitting the golf course 
in prep. for the 2013 season).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Soon the Astros leave the National League to go to the American League...
improving both leagues in the process.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) As far as the current leagues:   
You American League folks are all messed up, just look at the last 
2 World Series winners (Cardinals and Giants); 
go to the last 4 (add the Yankees and Phillies).   
I know that facts are difficult for you to handle, 
but please realize that we’re winning World Series and your junior league 
is just placing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
4) See you in St. Louis in October for another World Series championship.

and I really like the Cards too, so you're not riling me up all that much.
I admit I do see the American League as "my league" but that's because

I still follow baseball above all the other sports, but admit that the

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Standby lists:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mike Barno, Dick Martin, Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Glenn
Petroski, Steve Emmert, Mark Kinney, Vince Lutterbie, Eric Brosius,
Paul Rauterberg, Bob Osuch, Doug Kent, Sean O'Donnell,
Heath Gardner, Paul Kenny, and Jeff O'Donnell
stand by for regular Diplomacy.
Let me know if you want on or off these lists, especially OFF given the new policies.

I'm going to start the game opening list over.  Under the new regime, who wants to

DIPLOMACY: First off, another regular Diplomacy game is open.  Doug Kent and Brad
Wilson are in, anyone else?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BREAKING AWAY: Also, a new Breaking Away game is open. 
Currently Andy York is on board.
This is the game I really like running and want to start another one.
It's easy, very low maintenance.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Thanks all for getting re-engaged in the game, sounds like there is 
some action.  All over the place, actually.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JAMES to WORLD): Well, this should open up the game a bit.  
I either just made this game more interesting, or handed it over 
to Russia and AH.  
Either way is better than the status quo.  
I've received more communication this season than the rest of the years combined.  
Feels like it is worth breathing a little life into the game again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to WORLD): I would be surprised if there isn't some more communcation
this time, except for Johnny Crow, everyone has Winter adjustments!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MOSCOW to VIENNA):  This is just to show John how the game is
supposed to be played.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GM to MOSCOW): The game is supposed to be played however you 
decide to play it, but I know us observers appreciate the action!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ENGLAND to GERMANY): You have been a great ally, 
but marching slowly to stalemate lines just isn't much fun.  
Also didn't hear from you this season...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GM to GERMANY): Whoops, it seems that someone didn't join all the 
revived communication.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BRITISH to DUTCH): You are now liberated.  
Sorry it took so long.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS 14 (Dark Press –- not for attribution)): Who's Zooing Who...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Zoo seemed desolate, deserted...unpublished. 
Like it had seen better days,  back when people who had read it were still alive, 
or at least chewed their own food.  
The trolley pulled off, making it seem somehow a bit more lonely.  
The ring of its bell seemed smothered against the worn pages, 
like the last gasps of the elderly millionaire with the new bride that had nice pillows; 
but not enough patience.  
Pages that were tattered and coffee stained like some sucker had been putting a lot of 
think into his final moves before autographing that stamp with the spit on his tongue. 
Trying to find that lottery ticket move that would get him just one more dot.  
Trusting a goon to cut support, that he wouldn't have loaned a shoe shine to the 
day before.  
That was the nitty gritty of the hobby; 
where the truth was a hungry baby wailing for its supper, 
but momma had seven other lies to feed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"These pages are more dog eared than my beagle,"  I said, 
giving the Zine an appraising squint before we went in.  
That's where you only squint the one eye as you look up, 
not too far up as to be gawking, but you gotta get the brim of the fedora 
up enough to see what you're looking at.  
Then you have the knowing look going in the other eye, 
the one people can actually see, that has to hint at mystery and 
unfathomed depths of experience.  
Then you sell it by having your mouth set pensively around something, 
if you're a farmer it's a straw of grass, if you're me... 
I patted my pockets for a smoke, but remembered I was out.   
Well, that was okay, I didn't need to sell it, the place was definitely remaindered.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I patted my pockets again, it was a nervous tick, 
like when the guy in the movie checks to see if his gun is 
loaded after he's already in the warehouse with the bad guys.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Smack... smack," replied the blonde with her usual pithy repartee. 
The gum smacked against her luscious red lips and then back into that mouth. 
That mouth that had grazed a thousand lips.  
She could burn topless on my Ilium anytime she wanted to.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Well's, we'se here.  Mightaswell take a look-see," 
she said around the gum, and the lipstick...and my cloying gaze.  
She hefted the tommy gun and ratcheted back the return to pop a shell 
plink, plink, plink bouncing into the litter of forgotten plot devices 
at the bottom of the page...and we weren't even inside yet.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Meanwhile, halfway across the Hobby two figures trudged ploddingly along. 
Their heads swiveling about as they searched diligently the nooks, 
crannies and unedited paragraphs of the Hobby for their quarry.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm just sayin' da six way draw is like kissing yer sister, Hewey," opined Louie,
he moved his hands for punctuation.  "Nothing worse than kissing yer sister."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dewey's pork pie hat tilted precariously to one side as the 
opinion entered his head and rattled about.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Hitler" replied Dewey.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Louie stopped in mid-ramble and looked at his porcine compatriot, "huh?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Jus' sayin', Hitler kissing yer sister would be worse," expanded Dewey, 
"him being a Jew hating Fascist and sidewalk artist and all..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"It's just a, whadyacallit, a sayin'," said Louie, shaking a hand in negation, 
"Truth be told I don' even have a sister."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dewey pursed his lips in thought.  "Youse don' have a sister?  
Well, lying about kissing yer sister would definitely be worse 
than just kissing her...cause then you got da' kiss...and da' cover-up.  
That's what gets all dem fancy pants politicos in dutch. It undermines yer validity."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yer creditability," corrected Louie.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"My credibility is fine, youse da' one already said yer were lying.  
It makes you out to be a welsh, and her to be a slut...like that 
Fluke girl...or from Arkansas."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Dere is no sister," said Louie, exasperated, "we're past that."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"She's passed," asked Dewey, his eyes widening in surprise. 
"Jeepers, talking rude about yer dead sister would have to be 
worse than just kissing her."  
He pulled his fingers up as he counted, "cuz now you have da' incestuous kiss," 
one finger. 
"Da' lie to cover up," the second finger. 
"AND yer defiling yer poor sister's memory."   
He waved the three fingers in Louie's face and sadly shook his head.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"That's not what I'm saying," said Louie, getting ready to set things straight.
But another idea had crossed Dewey's mind, 
and his eyebrows shot up his forehead like the sash on a window; 
though it was a short trip.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Of course, if you fingered her ass when you kissed her, 
dat would definitely be worse," said Dewey, 
nodding to himself that the idea had merit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What!?  How can you say such a thing?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm just sayin'...youse asked 'what was worse than kissin' yer sister'.  
I tink it goes widout sayin' that fingering her ass when you 
kiss her has got to rank just a little worse."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I wish it had gone without sayin'!" 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Course," continued Dewey, unphased, 
"if Hitler fingered yer dead sister's ass when he kissed her...
dat would be even worse than that..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Louie's mouth was open to reply; "screEEEEeecchh, eehhhhh, eehhhhhh."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dewey looked at Louie puzzled, which was his normal manner, 
but the screech had come not from Louie, but from a small 
organ grinder's monkey that jumped up and down in front of them 
on the sidewalk and berated them with simian eloquence.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"What have we here," asked Louie as he leaned down to the monkey 
and took the crumpled cardboard box out of its uplifted furry hands.  
He straightened the red and white box out to see the logo.  
It was a sultry brunette reclining across the crumpled cigarette pack, 
her crimson dress hiked up to show her stockings and the hint of garters, 
and legs that went all the way up. 
She had a slow, sure smile on her face like she had the only one 
and smoke curled about her bare shoulders playing against her smoldering eyes.  
The come hither look made you want to light up; one for you and one for her too.  
The brand was spelled out on the bottom in strong masculine print; Red Kings.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Just then the trolley pulled up to the curb in a cacophony of noise that 
attested to the strain the verbs were having moving it on its rails, 
while the brakes sought to bring it to the end of the sentence; 
but it was a run on sentence so it sidled to a stuttering, shaky stop 
a few feet past the bench where the riders, who might have been perturbed, 
had over the multitude of game years come to accept this as a commonplace 
occurrence, just another long drawn out, yet pointless part of the Hobby. 
The monkey bounded emphatically up and down; which is not as easy as it looks, 
because it requires the extra effort of adding the bound at the end of the jump 
while waving the arms at the same time.  
But the monkey had long been working with Italians, and so could pull it off.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Louie looked at the trolley and back at the crumpled pack of smokes.  
He looked at the monkey, still screeching and jumping, and then back 
at the Red Kings package.  
In his head he fumbled a jigsaw puzzle piece; he hovered it over 
empty holes in the puzzle, he flipped it completely around, paused, 
and then with a mental nudge turned it a quarter turn clockwise and 
pushed it into the puzzle...and felt it slip snug into place, neat as a pin. 
A glimmer of comprehension lit his dark eyes and sallow face, 
as a slow smile of satisfaction slid across his lips.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FGR draw proposal was rejected again and is reproposed, 
please vote with your winter orders.
There also is a proposal for an Italian concession.  Vote on that as well.
Thanks VERY much to Vince Lutterbie for expertly playing out the Turkish position.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) We now have two medical replacements, as Buddy's son Jim (who some of us played with 
many years ago as James Alan) will be playing for Buddy as Eric is playing for Terry. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to PARANOIACS): No press from you? I don't think you're paranoid enough!
Come on, guys, as long as this game is NOT ending yet, keep voting on those proposals,
you might as well write for me!

 <b>RICK DESPER SQUEAKED OUT THE VICTORY OVER ALEX WOO!!!</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) So far, Andy York is the only one interested in another game of this??
I'd like to get six again.  I will note this for one more issue like this,
before putting a call just at the front of the subszine.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i></b> 
For the last word, I was filling up pages with press from the 
game Iliad that was played in <i>Europa Express</i> near the end of <i>EE</i>'s
run.  
This game was distinctive since it had at least one player who at other times
published and played under a pseudonym and another publisher who WAS playing
under a pseudonym.
If you think I'm going to tell you now which is which, you don't see the point
of what I'm doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This first installment of my story appeared in: 
http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/oldzines/ee44.pdf you can find other old <i>EE</i>'s
at Doug's oldzines site.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But I ran out of time and space on this page this time, so you'll have to wait until
next issue for more.
