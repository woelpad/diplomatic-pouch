<br /><br />Last time I had a printing error losing the first page of the games section in
most of the issues.
I figured it out after awhile, but some people's issues were missing it entirely.
This time, I REALLY want responses on who is playing in the pickups to Phil 
Reynolds' games.
On the schedule,
we're getting better, a bit less late, but gosh work this spring again was really
a drag.
Too many jobs, too much work, eventually I'll have to find some way to back off
a bit.
Anyway, I do miss all of this, so let's dive back into it.
Remember that there are a whole host of Dipping conventions on the East
Coast popping up over the next few months.... DixieCon in North Carolina
over Memorial Day Weekend, the Boston Massacre here in Boston some weekend
in June (sorry, but we're STILL not entirely sure which one  - late
word, we will have a SMALL event then and reschedule the Boston Massacre
for 2006, possibly affiliated with TotalCon in February), World DipCon
in Washington, DC at the end of July, and then the most lavish Con in 
DipDom, HuskyCon on Long Island at the Woodring's Beachfront house on
the weekend of August 19-21.  That's one each month, can't you make just
one?
I'm hoping to make two, one pretty definite.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
A few comments on Iraq as the hopeful feelings after the elections
seem to be dissipating.
One shadowy figure that still is hanging around the new government is
Ahmed Chalabi.
You will note that I have commented a few times that there is more 
behind the scenes going on with him than it appears and our uselessly
cowed press corps in this country doesn't have the guts to do some
real investigative journalism on him.
What we do know is this, he is currently the acting oil minister for
Iraq, a Shia Muslim who none of the Iraqi parties really seem to 
trust is still in there.
Our seemingly transparent attempt awhile back to have him raided and
arrested so that the Iraqi people would "see" that he wasn't in
the American pocket just seems shadowy.
I can't imagine any Iraqi being happy with him running their oil
ministry.
But shouldn't WE as Americans care about this?
Or maybe we're happy with having Wolfowitz's guy in charge there.
It could bring the gas prices at our pumps down eventually.
Though it really would be better if the gas prices stayed up....
wouldn't it?
And is Chalabi STILL Wolfowitz's guy or is he spying for the 
Iranians?
Doesn't it matter??
No, I suppose not, all that matters is that we have elections
and stability in Iraq.
The dripping sarcasm is unfortunately completely intentional.
We've got to start hoping something begins to come around in Iraq
or else we're just putting off an inevitable civil war.

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.n play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.

The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:

You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on

<b>THE SEARCH FOR DEREK NELSON</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm going to continue putting some Golden Agers in here to hunt for, 
working up to some REAL, REAL hard people to find
culminating in the 300th issue person whom I already have in mind.
Derek Nelson is the person who won the first postal game in
<i>Graustark</i>.
He's been missing for at least 25 years, I know in the records I can
find that he attended the 1976 DipCon in Baltimore.
I think it will be fun if we can find these Golden Agers.
So, let's really find Derek, it's worth fifty bucks!!!
You have until issue #295 at the fifty buck price.
As I thought might happen, we're now reaching back across MANY
levels of animosity in the old hobby, but I do so with some intent.
After all, in this szine now we have pretty much everyone from
the late 70's through the 80's who might have had some "problems"
at the time.
You'll forgive me for not explicitly pointing such things out,
I do not want to be seen as instigating.
But Derek's mention brought this note from John Boardman....
I'm printing the whole letter even though only part of it is about Derek
Nelson.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>John Boardman (29 April 2005)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Dear Jim,
Thanks for your efforts in finding new homes for the postal games left
orphaned by the death of Phil Reynolds.
I have also received a letter from Tom Howell, which listed the remaining
U.S. postal Diplomacy 'zines.
I was surprised to learn that there are only eight of them.
<i>((The Web is so huge now with Diplomacy, with hundreds and hundreds
of games going on at any one time, but people don't seem to have so
much time for postal Diplomacy any more.
I still think that is a shame and that people could enjoy this medium too,
but the market is not bearing that out right now.))</i>
I trade with all of them except Robert Lesco's <i>Northern Flame</i>, for
which I do not have an address.
<i>((Robert Lesco's address is 49 Parkside Drive, Brampton, Ontario, CANADA,
L6Y 2H1 and I'm sure he would welcome a trade.
Robert's szine is quite readable and very well worth it for anyone out there.
He charges a dollar an issue.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Are you quite sure you really <i>want</i> to locate Derek Nelson?
Like many postal Diplomacy players in the 1960s, Nelson came in 
through science-fiction fandom.
He was a well-known s-f fan and letterhack in those days.
He was born in Ulster, came to Canada as a child, and was known as the
"Toronto Tory".
His views on Irish affairs were what might have been expected from a
stereotypical Ulster Protestant.
He was also a fanatical anti-Communist.
<i>((I am sure, I did know most of that and perhaps he has mellowed a bit.
In any case, yes, I am serious about trying to locate him.
I might as well say so now, I'm working up toward a Fiftieth Anniversary
of Diplomacy celebration in 2008.
I would like to spend that year (which also will be a VERY interesting US
presidential election year) with a number of retrospectives and commentaries
from people out of the hobby's past.  I was going to (and still am) officially
announce the formation of the effort in my 300th issue coming up later this year.
And I want to find some of these people before then.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Nelson's moment of glory came in the fall of 1962, when he was inspired by the
Cuban Missile Crisis to write a panic-stricken call to arms for <i>Yandro</i>,
a s-f fanzine published in Indiana by Juanita and Buck Coulson.
Nelson's article was entitled "America, Wake Up!", and urged a course of
action that could only lead to nuclear war.
<i>((Interesting, someone recently said that "Dr. Strangelove" is back and
doesn't need much updating for today's world situation.
I somewhat agree, and perhaps we are on a path right now that could only
lead to nuclear war, eventually.
It would be interesting, with the capitalist Chinese Communists being the
chief remaining Communist state, what he would think today.
It seems in the 60's everyone was so much more passionate than they are today.
What we see today (see my short headline editorial) is an insane level of
apathy and ignorance!!))</i>
He was rebutted in the next issue by the well-known s-f editor and author
Don Wollheim, who noted that "Germany, Wake Up!" ("Deutschland, Erwache!")
had been the title of an equally alarmist essay written by Hermann Goering,
shortly before the Nazis took power in Germany.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I lost sight of Nelson during the late 1960's, and have not missed him one bit.
<i>((I certainly understand, I managed to track him another five years or so,
but certainly haven't come across him in the Diplomacy hobby again.
I usually Google all these people before I offer them up, one can
productively search out some of this list for sure.
In the case of "Derek Nelson", there's this weird out of print book
called, "Off the Map: The Curious History of Place-Names" that I was
hoping would interest people like Tom Howell, and might spark a memory
by those like Rod Walker.
Anyway, I'm not sure if that is the same Derek Nelson, but it wouldn't
surprise me.
I'm still going to look for him.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am mildly curious about what may have have happened to another minor nuisance
from the early years of postal Diplomacy.
In the 1960's, Charles Reinsel published a postal Diplomacy 'zine from Clarion, PA
called <i>Big Brother</i>, generally referred to by others as "Big Bother".
Reinsel was a very abrasive person, both in print and in person.
He supported the American attempt to conquer Vietnam, and vehemently snarled at
Pacifists, once threatening to "purn" them.
He once made himself so obnoxious at an over-the-board game at John Koning's 
home that John had to order him out.
Reinsel was older than any other 1960's gamesmaster, and is probably no longer
among the living.

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<table align="center" border="0"><tr><td>
Stay well, John</td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I'm pretty sure you are correct.
In the obituary of Gertrude Reinsel, who appears to be his mother 
(http://www.obitcentral.com/obitsearch/obits/pa/pa-erie4.htm which you
can find easily googled from
Clarion obituaries), it states that son Charles' death precedes hers.
I also thought I heard at one point that Charles Reinsel was arrested for
assault or something and went to jail. 
I discovered this when I was trying to find out what would 
happen if Charles ever did try to "purn" you, as Mark Berch placed this term
in the Diplomacy AtoZ encyclopedia but noted that we never knew for sure what
it meant.
I'm sure it wasn't a pleasant and peaceful idea, so YOU stay well too.
As I approach my 300th issue it continues to stun me that you have more than two
and a half times as many issues out, I don't know if I can keep this up for another
30 years to try to catch you....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!! 
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.

We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.
You can find Brendan Whyte at bwhyte of unimelb.edu.au
(note that this is a new E-Mail address for Brendan) or by mail to send checks at:

That's a relatively new address adjustment.

They ARE going to make it and release it this fall, but there are a 
number of concerns and opportunities that this is going to create.
If anyone is interested, some of us have been in some informal contact
with the game designers, but I really don't have the time to fully
engage them.
I think the key note to take away is that they're surely going to design
a "simplified starter" version of the game that plays faster and more
exciting.
This is likely in some ways not to look like Diplomacy in any fashion
that people familiar with variants would state.
But they are committed to the basic design feature that you can make
promises that you can't be held to keep.
I don't want to be too negative or too positive about this development,
but it will be something that "changes the environment".
More on this for sure as I hear more.

Just got the <i>TAP</i> with the baseball predictions from you and Goz.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My thoughts, with the advantage of a few weeks having passed...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East:
Sox, O's (WC), Yankees, Blue Jays, DRays.
Sox off-season moves look better than those of the Yankees.  Yankees
have a serious problem with their pitching staff that won't be easily
resolved.  Johnson will have great starts and starts where he gets
hit - he's 42 and won't be able to pitch brilliantly all the time. 
The rest of the staff is middling at best.  Pavano didn't suddenly
become a top-tier pitcher last year - he's still the same guy he's
always been.  Ditto for Jaret Wright.  Mussina is definitely long in
the tooth, and Kevin Brown is done.  Even the bullpen is aging.  O's
have a very good starting lineup, so it'll come down to their
pitching.  Question is whether their young starters will be able to
compete.
Wild card, as always, is from this division.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((As you all know, the Yankees are now mired in the cellar with the
Devil Rays, they've made one or two small changes, including pulling
Bernie Williams out of the regular line-up.  
But that alone won't do it.
In retrospect, it will be judged that the Yankees were not thinking 
like Bill Belichick (i.e. with the business head) when they even 
considered keeping Bernie as a starter.
And their pitching is at the VERY bottom of the league.
They're talking about firing Mel Stottlemyre, but it isn't his fault.
As you say, they've got nuttin.
On the O's, they're still flyin'.
It's guys like Bruce Chen that are stunning me, though I should remember
the old baseball adage that lefties mature late.
The Red Sox once dumped Jamie Moyer too early, and they had Bruce Chen
in 2003 (most of you probably weren't even aware, and he played indifferently
at Pawtucket all season, not even getting a sniff at the majors in a 
season where there was LOTS of turnover on the Sox staff).
But Chen looks like a pitcher, and the rest of that Orioles staff
is making him about the fourth starter.
Amazing.
Could be a race, and if it is the Yankees have no chance of getting
back in it.
Take that, Goz, 200 million bucks and all!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL Central:
Twins, White Sox, Indians, Tigers, Royals.  White Sox have been the
surprise so far, but I think that they won't be able to keep up the
pace for the whole season.  Twins have the pitching to win the
division, but not enough hitting to actually win any postseason
series.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Can we believe that Santana actually LOST a game???
Still, I agree with you, thinking that the White Sox will come
back to the pack, but damn if guys like Jon Garland 
continue their runs, then that is going to be wrong.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL West:
Angels, As, Mariners, Rangers.  Angels are clearly the best team
here.
Other teams are built as decent also-rans.  Can As get enough
hitting?  Can Rangers get enough pitching?  Will Mariners fade again
in September?  I'll believe things have changed when I see change.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Ditto, no sign of change yet....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East:
Braves, Marlins(WC), Nats, Mets, Phillies.  Braves always win this
division so there's no point in picking against them.  Plus, now they
have Tim Hudson!  Marlins' have the best young pitching, esp.
considering injuries to Wood and Prior.  Nats will surprise people,
but don't have quite enough to make playoffs.  Mets will falter when
Pedro has his inevitable injury.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((It still looks to me that Pedro, in the effort to prove the
Red Sox wrong, is stretching things out a bit too much.
I'll be shocked too if he makes all his starts.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL Central:
Cards, Astros, Cubs, Reds, Pirates, Brewers.  Astros can challenge
for wildcard again presuming Pettite pitches well.  Cubs are in
desperate need for their young starters to get and stay healthy. 
Losing Nomar was sadly predictable.  Reds have nice outfield, and
there's not much good to say about Pirates or Brewers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I actually had thought that Nomar would have a good season.
And the Reds outfield IS good, and will be even better if Griffey,
Jr. heats up as I expect him to.
But the Cards are developing a LOT of separation very quickly.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL West:
Dodgers, Padres, Giants, DBacks, Rockies.  Dodgers will miss Beltre,
but they seem fine thus far, and Lowe will turn out to be a great
pickup (unlike Pedro, Lowe will not miss significant time with an
injury.)  Padres are "almost there" but don't quite have enough to
compete at top level.  Losing Bonds for half the season takes Giants
out of contention.  DBacks don't look like they're serious, and
Rockies should consider possibility of building a new stadium either
with much larger dimensions or indoors and <i>pressurized</i> to sea
level!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Interestingly, it remains the PSYCHOLOGY of the pitchers that
seems to be the big problem for the Rockies.
You'd think that by this time they would get adjusted to the rate
of failure.
But they don't.
Could you actually pressurize a stadium to sea level? - intriguing
concept.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Playoffs:
Sox over Twins, Angels over O's,
Dodgers over Braves, Cards over Marlins.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
LCS:
Sox over Angels, Cards over Dodgers.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WS:
Sox over Cards, though the Redbirds win a few games this time.
<i>((Boy, isn't that looking like the deal at this point?
Both the Cards and Red Sox are enduring numerous injuries and 
weak starts and they're still dominating.
I like the new Red Sox batting order (Trot Nixon fifth and flip
flopping Ortiz and Manny) and the current Cardinals one.
There really are no weak points in either team for playoff baseball,
if everyone playing below their capability on each team comes
even halfway back.
And WHAT will George do after their latest hot streak ends and the
Yankees weaknesses keep coming back to haunt them.  
This is a teaser for nothing.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Hoops:
Last night the C's scored a grand total of 4 points in the last 8
minutes of a game and lost a game that the Pacers showed almost as
little interest in winning.  Every time I see a game like that I'm
reminded why I watch so little NBA these days.  How can people making
that much money play that poorly?  C's will still win series.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I thought so too, but it was amazingly difficult for the
Celtics to play consistently for two periods in a row.
Of course, they have discovered Al Jefferson as a budding 
superstar, so that's probably worth the price of losing in
the long run.  
Especially since there wasn't any way either the C's or the Pacers
were getting past Detroit.
Danny Ainge is talking about instituting a "Code of Conduct" for the
players next year, could be an interesting battle of wills.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First round - no upsets in Eastern Conference, in West, Houston will
take out Dallas (a mini-upset).  The Denver-San Antonio series is
intriguing.  I would have picked the Spurs to go to the Finals before
the series started, but Denver has a lot of life in them.  I'll go
with the upset there, conceding the point that this is a late
prediction.  Suns and Sonics also advance.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Second round - Heat and Pistons easily advance in the East.  Suns and
Nuggets in West.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Conference finals: now it starts getting real interesting.  Presuming
Shaq can play, I'll take Heat over Pistons in a great series.  In
West, I'll take the Suns over the upstart Nuggets.  That leads to 
Suns/Heat finals (how boring to take both #1 seeds!).  Suns won't be
able to stop Shaq, and Heat will win first championship.  Presuming
Dick Bavetta is not allowed anywhere near the court (and with Alonzo
Mourning on the case, I think that's a reasonable side bet.)

<i>((I haven't seen any serious analyst talking about ANYTHING but
a Heat/Suns final.
It will be interesting if anyone else can seriously challenge them.
I must say I agree and I agree with you that Shaq wins that matchup.
Shaq really should have won the MVP, it's still amazing that Shaq
has only won ONE MVP in his career thus far.
Shaq of course is a bit injured now, and the Suns are having more
trouble beating Dallas than I would have expected.... after all
Joe Johnson is now out too - you could do a lot with a Boston
Celtics "All Rejected by Rick Pitino" team that would be headlined
by Johnson - but I still think that it will be Suns vs. Heat.
I'm amazed at how Indiana almost seems to be a BETTER team
without Ron Artest, if anyone surprises from the East it will
be them.))</i>

One or both games might go to Harold Reynolds' subszine, since Colonia is over.
I have Phil's last issue, #44, but that was published way back in December of

<b>Us and Them</b>: Winter 1901 was published and it was early on, but I think
I can find all the players.  Hank Alme (Austria), Karl Schmit (England),

are all here already and Paul Boymel (Turkey) and Marc Ellinger (France)
are locatable.  Please let me know if you plan to continue!!!

<b>We are the Champions</b>: This one is even earlier, ONLY Spring 1901 had
been published.   But again, most of the players are around here, and 
I've located Paul Boymel (Italy) and Marc Ellinger (Turkey).
Dave Partridge (Austria) is here of course, Graham Wilson (England) is
just joining us, Fred Wiedemeyer (France) and Kevin Wilson (Germany)
are here.

1) Ah, we finally are moving.
I usually take all the summer/winter seasons, but since this game
started so slowly, if you all want to get your orders for Fall in
by the next deadline, we'll continue.  
Otherwise, it will be a Summer only press season.
And the press HAS been active.

am under no circumstances to have the maple syrup on my buck wheat waffles."

(SEAN-JEFF): Can't blame Britain for attacking me in C6 at the Statesmen after 
all I did manage to backstab him 3 times. Japan is new to the Statesmen and 
didn't seem to play for very long prior, so I had hopes that he did better 
than your former ally in our first game together. I suspected the attack, 
but I thought for sure he wouldn't do it till at least Holland was crippled. 
In any case that game is 'bout done. It looks to be ending as a T/J duels 
since they can't beat each other and we're stuck trying to figuring out who 
to fend against and who to try pushing back.... Oh, did I mention I've 
rearranged my alliance there and we're getting waxed?

In any case, you're welcome to send anything here you like, I'm just
wondering why this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-BOOB): Actually Colonial Diplomacy is a much better map than Modern 
Diplomacy, but they both truly do have the same problem. I forget how many 
Colonial has, but it isn't too far off from 64. Any chance you can send me a 
Modern Diplomacy map without any units on it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB-SEAN): If I remember, it will be stuck in this issue, if not, when
I see this note again and remember to send it separately.  Anyone else
want a Modern map?  You also can download it from www.diplom.org.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-JEFF PART 2): I don't know how, but The Statesmen actually called me to 
take over for France in D17; the really ironic thing is I started that game 
as Austria and by all signs I get the distinct pleasure of being the first 
and second player eliminated... I just have one thing to say "Joy" or more 
"What can I say life sucks then you die."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SEAN): Or the GM of the Statesmen is NOT following accepted practice.
It generally of course is NOT a good idea to have players playing two
positions in the same game.
Given this game, I ***KNOW*** I would hear squawks if I subbed you in as
a standby to another position in this game after you are (I should say
might be) eliminated.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DENMARK-ANKARA): Let me get this straight, you attacked Austria with two 
different allies? When did this scheme come into play? I thought for sure 
A/I would come knocking on your door, not T/I vs Austria.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-JEFF PART 3): D17 as France I decided since I was losing that I needed 
to take a center to remain in the game. Ironically England whom I stabbed 
for Liverpool attacked me on the same move...... I was also offered while 
I'm sitting in Liverpool to go to a tavern the Beatles used to go to. I had 
to tell him that the only great thing about me being born hailed the 
destruction of the beatles. They really went to pote December 8, 1980 due to 
John Lennons death. Then again some say when I let my hair grow and never 
mess with it I look very similar to John Lennon. I seen a picture of John 
Lennon and quite frankly I do look alot alike to John Lennon in terms of 
some features and especially my hair, so could it be more than coincidence I 
was born December 8, 1980 and John Lennon died December 8, 1980? I don't 
believe it was a reincarnation especially since Johnny died in the evening 
while I was born 8am. I do find it odd I am not a beatles fan and I have a 
minor resemblances to John Lennon. Think Die another Day between Bond and 
the Korean face lifted to look like a westerner.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-STAR TREKKIE): You know the Mekons are not in Flip Flop press right? 
Wouldn't it stand to reason that the Star Trek press should be eliminated 
for more room for black press and white press and I guess grey press though 
I wonder if there is blue press???? I must give you credit. I'm nowhere 
near a Trekkie or even much of a fan, but I must admit some of the things you 
write in your logs is much more interesting than the tv series that has come 
out. I even like it better than the last movie. I liked Data the b*****ds. I 
was curious if you had noticed the fact if you desire to keep writing the 
press than by all means make sure it's better than the crappy ill written 
plots the tv series has come out with for a long time now. On one hand I 
think Star Trek hired SOE developers or they you may have thought they hired 
me as a Star Trek writer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to SEAN): Well, the mostly useless Enterprise series has finally been
cancelled.
I think it was a HUGE mistake to go "back in time".
I hope the franchise isn't completely dead, but they need to go back
to the roots and a narrative story line that moves forward.
Star Wars also has been a HUGE yawn jumping back in time.
I find myself REALLY not caring how Anakin becomes Darth.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
We now 
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
So actually technically you don't HAVE to vote, since
this does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.
So it is just draw vetoers who must vote.
At least one person continues to veto the proposal.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) The concession to Germany fails.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Thanks to Vern Parker for stepping in on this difficult
situation.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Press is VERY welcome!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure
(note that Rick still is ahead of this pace).
And Karl cracks the 400 total, but can he translate it into points?
We shall see shortly.
