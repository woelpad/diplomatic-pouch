<br /><br />Some random thoughts on life, the universe, and everything....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Today, right now, the life and the future of the Diplomacy hobby has changed.
Believe it!!!
Paradox has released the new computer version of Diplomacy.
As far as we can tell, they "solved" the Diplomacy AI problem with a 
high dose of randomization AND giving the computer AI's some fake personalities
(which seems to make most of these personalities 
[they give these avatars evocative names] VERY easy to offend).
They also actually know the rules (a simple idea that has proved to be difficult 
for some AI's in the past) and as long as you follow what I think is
an overly prescriptive negotiation language that would NOT be good for
players to put in their thought processes and use in negotiation with humans, you
actually can negotiate with the AIs.
Of course, in good tit-for-tat fashion, they can get offended and then
refuse to talk to you for the rest of the game.
And yes, there's too much flashy "Computer Risk like" graphics for attacks,
but that is forgivable.
It is an entree into the hobby that will dominate the hobby's future.
BUT, more than all that, you're going to hear from Paradox.
In a complete 180 from Hasbro's attitude, marketing people from 
Paradox are going to start appearing at tournaments near you, doing
demos, boosting financial viability, and being responsive.
And they WILL try to convince you, all of you, to purchase their product.
I might even do that - at this writing, I intend to do it.
And I don't say that lightly.
Check out http://www.diplomacy-pcgame.com/.
And see a note from their marketing manager below.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Every man, woman, and child in the US has been borrowing $2500 from other 
countries each year for the last five years or so, adding up to a debt
from that period alone of more than $10,000 for each of us.
Each and every one of us, rich or poor carries this implicit 
debt, and that is on top of all the personal debt that we're running up.
Some people think they can predict what that means for sure.
Anyone who tells you they can do that, is a fool.
What it really does is dramatically raise uncertainty and the
POSSIBILITY of some really bad things (eventually these other
countries may decide to stop buying up our debt and substantially
deferring their own consumption - which would
dramatically raise our interest rates and toss our economy into
private and public crises - or they might eventually use their
leverage over us to dismantle our position as the sole superpower,
or we might be seriously handicapping our ability to deal with
very serious health care financing problems that we're finally
going to have to face later this century after exhausting every
single last way of dodging the real issues - this calls to mind, 
very often lately, the famous
Winston Churchill quote that Americans will do the right thing, but
only after making every single possible mistake).
By the way, the hurricane is not the problem, especially since
(for the first time, I believe) we're going to hold our poorest
states accountable for paying back whatever we lend them to rebuild,
instead of forgiving this debt later as we've done in most all 
previous disaster relief situations.
The problem, or two edged sword, is our belief in consumption.
Of course, it also would be a disaster if we stopped consuming (both
personally and as a government) since that would also be a shock
to the system that could cause all the worrisome things to happen.
Be careful and sleep tight, America.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Who's going to run for President from the Republican party in 2008?
I find it fascinating that we know that there will be precisely 11
challengers for the Democratic nomination, we also know that two
of these will be John Kerry and Hillary Clinton (seriously, the 11
number has been confirmed by a number of people who would know,
including Howard Dean, but they are explicitly leaving the announcements
of course to each individual challenger and most of them probably will
wait until after the midterm congressionals to go public).
But who knows who any of the Republican challengers will be?
I don't know either the number or any of the people who will
be running, haven't even heard much speculation on who they
might be, and most importantly I don't think we'll know until
Bush decides to tell us who he will endorse to succeed him.
It would be interesting if the race came down to Hillary vs.
Condolezza with everyone calling most of their attention down
on their political history with their respective husband/mentor
rather than their gender.
I think that's possible.
But my key point is how one party leaks all sorts of things that perhaps
should be strategized and the other strategizes almost all of its leaks.
We'll see shortly if that strategizing in the Plame CIA outing case will
come back to haunt them - although I'm not Karl Rove's biggest fan,
I think we need to see the sticky lines that they're on.
If he and Scooter get indicted for "perjury" (same issue basically
as Clinton), we'll have something similar to Whitewater.... a long
expensive government investigation where you have to indict SOMEONE
for SOMETHING.
That, to me, is a problem when there are so many larger white collar
crimes to investigate and prosecute where REAL profits are at stake
in the private sector.
What I think the pundits are missing is that, as usual in American
history (see the Whigs and Tyler to Republicans and Lincoln and 
McKinley

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Sticking with the politics for one more point, long term planning vs.
short term interests.
Everyone knows, or should know, that most businesses are plotting and
maximizing in the short term, building long term gains out of the chain
of short term gains that SOMETIMES accrues from that.
The larger the corporation or organization, the more the influence
costs within the organization push toward short term interests
(this equally affects IBM, General Motors, AND government, more or less). 
In most cases, long term planning requires a HUGE amount of leadership
and drive.
There is a shortage of that in all politics in Washington and around
the world, and this affects our reaction to impending natural 
disasters, epidemics, global warming, politics, China, and almost
everything.
Worse, what you have to do to get attention (witness the avian flu
issue) is make something SEEM imminent and short term in order to
do long term planning.
Taking that example a bit farther, you have hundreds of TIMES more
people around the world dying of tuberculosis this year than are
EVER going to die from the avian flu, UNLESS it mixes with one of
the human flus and mutates like it apparently did in 1918.
It's been almost 100 years, and might be another 100 years.
And that's long term planning.
BUT it's being treated like a short term problem, and that's leading
to unwarranted hysteria and bad planning decisions.
Like 9/11, once out there in the public, I'm LESS worried about
avian flu NOW, I'm really worried about tuberculosis that is 
getting less attention.
We have a crying need for leadership right now and we're not getting it.
Remember when Al Gore once talked about global warming?
That was when he WASN'T running for office.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
- Text messaging in theatres: this long has been a problem in movies,
where it bothers the audience, but I go to a lot of live theatre and 
dance and in the last six months or so, there's an epidemic of text
messaging going on around here in live events.
This is an obnoxious insult BOTH to the audience AND the performers.
You think they can't look out there in the darkened theatre and see
all these dull green lights going up from the audience?
We've all seen the standard curtain speeches (at least they're 
standard in all the Providence venues, one of our local friends
has a line "set cells and pagers to stun" that I kinda like),
but no one specifically mentions text messaging.
I think it's time to INFORM these Neanderthals (intentionally 
making it sound retrogressive rather than progressive) that if
they're going to attend a LIVE event, they shouldn't be 
multitasking.
Anyone else notice an uptick in this where you live???

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.n play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count. 
See the revised game start announcements below!

I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:

 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.diplomacy.co.uk

Peter Sullivan's subszine is out of stasis, and all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter was saying that he would be unlikely to be starting any new games in the 
<i>Octopus</i> until "at
least the start of 2002." 
He had been hereby declared to be in official indeterminate stasis and that
date was now a "whenever".
But Peter is now clearly back!!!
See <i>Octopus' Garden</i> in the print edition below, or on the web
at the above address.
In the meantime, Rip Gooch and Dave Partridge have been picking up the choo-choo
game slack in <i>TAP</i>.  Contact Rip at xyropedes of canada.com or Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info.
Rip has been traveling this summer also, but he is trying to get his act back
together soon.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR KEVIN TIGHE</b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There is a very special "search for" coming up in issue #300, and I'm
going to offer a hundred buck reward for that one, so I'm also going to 
up the ante on Kevin through issue #300 to $1 billion dollars.... no,
make that $100, can't quite afford to be THAT generous.
There have been some recent "sightings" of Kevin Tighe.
And he's the reason I first started this feature (for those of you who
don't recall) and he's the one I continue to be most interested in finding.
This may take a bit of real detective work, but as a hint, like many of
us Diplomacy players, I believe he is out there making money on some
of the poker circuits.
I also would like ALL of the previous found people who are still getting
the szine to write me SOMETHING for the 300th issue for this section.
I know I've been having Doug Beyerlein write me lots of little notes
along the way, not all of whom I've been printing, and so I have some
things from him already.
But he may want to send me something else.
What should you write?
Something on what you've been up to, a reminiscence of Diplomacy times
or friends past, whatever, it's up to you, but I want something from
as many of you as possible.
While we're at it, some of you other old timers still getting the
szine (you know who you are, but I'm thinking most particularly of
people like Tom Nash, Dan Stafford, Bruce Geryk, and Steve Hutton,
most of whom were once szine editors) also should write me something!!!
I plan to have issue #300 be the first issue of 2006, so you have the
rest of the year.
I'll save them up for that issue, but get writing now!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Bill, Gregory, and ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or Bill Quinn or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into Euros, we'll try to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We also have reopened a branch office of the International
Subscription Exchange in Australia!!
Brendan Whyte, the publisher of the excellent szine <i>Damn the Consequences</i>
will be doing the honors, taking over in some sense from John Cain, who 
was the Australian rep for many years.
You can contact Brendan to sub to Australian szines from the US or to sub
to US szines from Australia, converting Australian dollars into American
ones.
We are now maneuvering deals to Europe from the other reps as well.

WorldMasters 2002 Email Diplomacy Tournament Finals are over, and 
in a game that went to 1914 (nice idea here to let the finals go
on for longer, a feature of WorldMasters that I applaud) Julio
Pereira gets to 14 centers as Russia and TAKES the 2002 WorldMasters

Congratulations to Julio, and salutes and felicitations to the

Julio is a fierce player and a good guy to boot.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
  http://www.worldmasters.net/wm04/

<div class="p"><!----></div>
for details on that, the Round 2 draws are out and games are going.
Some of the notable matchups include the WM04R221 draw that includes
Lee Harmon (G), Andy Bartalone (E), and Glenn Ledder (F).
I don't think I could come up with three more diverse personalities
who are all great players!  That will be quite a battle.
Glenn Ledder also is in the feature gutsy3 game that you can
observe in process by joining the gutsy3 observers group on Yahoo.
It's started a bit slowly, with Tamas Hauer playing (in my biased
view) a very poor Italy, but is starting to look a bit more promising.
Toby Harris has a reasonably easy draw in WM04R220 as Germany
against players who are rookies in top competition.
WM04R218 might be the toughest draw in Round 2 with Steve Ray,
David Malloch, Ben Cranie, Adam Silverman, and Jerry Fest among
the luminaries.
Smacko is Dave Partridge's (Russia) GM with a dangerous Tim Sweeney
hiding out in Italy.
THAT will be a game to watch.
Here's to good games in all quarters.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've been pretty sure that the White Sox would make the playoffs,
stumbling or not, ever since Jim-Bob said they wouldn't.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Note on the standard Goz complaint:  while Boston may be smaller than
Chicago the Red Sox fan base is much larger, both geographically and
population-wise than the White Sox fan base.  The Red Sox get most all
of New England.  The White Sox get anyone in northern Illinois who isn't
a Cubs' fan.  That's a number that might not get to 7 figures, and as a
whole the Sox' fans are a lot less affluent than the Cubs' fans.  The
Indians might actually have a bigger market than the White Sox do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Further local notes on the White Sox...they played in Minnesota on, I
think, the 17th of September, in a game that started at 11AM and had no
local TV coverage, due to a wide variety of reasons (Humphrey Dome had
to get cleared for a college football game, Fox took too long to waive
their exclusivity rights, etc.).  So Sox fans got the short end of that.
Couple that with a huge snafu for the last game of the Cleveland at
White Sox series (not that it was a big game or anything) on the 21st,
where the Cable provider lost the signal until the end of the 5th, by
which time the game was out of hand (sattelite viewers weren't
affected).  Some day there will be professional baseball in this city.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I personally think it's marvelous that San Diego can go to the playoffs
with a sub-.500 record.  It just further points out the silliness of the
setup.  Call me when that happens in the AL East.

Certainties of life:
Death,
Taxes,
The Cubs,
The Braves.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now it looks like the hottest team in the AL is actually the Los
Angeles Angels of Anaheim brought to you by Budweiser (hereafter
referred to as EE#3), but for obvious reasons no one is noticing.  How
can the Yankees, Red Sox, White Sox and Indians all lose at the same
time to teams that are a combined 58 games below .500?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
On the other hand, the two hottest teams in the NL are the Astros and
(better sit down) the Padres.  The Cards are limping since they clinched
(if Cleveland hadn't gotten so hot the last two months we'd be saying
the same about the White Sox) due to injuries and possibly lack of
interest, and the Braves now have another post-season to look forward to
with dread.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm petitioning Bud Selig to have the Cubs moved to the NL West, just so
they can lose a division on the last day again.  He's not returning my
calls or removing the restraining order, in case you were wondering.

BTW, there is no truth to the rumor that I'm the father of Jennifer
Garner's baby.  Ok, that's not really a rumor, but I'd like it to be
one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((And having people lose in the pennant race to the also rans has
always been and always IS part of the equation.  They're loose
and swinging free and easy, the contenders are tight and tense.
In the AL, the three game series this weekend are where it's at
and where we're getting to.  The White Sox have to win two while
the Indians lose two to make that one not matter, the Red Sox
Yankees one already must matter.  I think it will be neat if the
Red Sox, Yankees and Indians ALL win two while the White Sox
lose two so we go into the weekend with all four teams tied.
That's not exactly a prediction, but it is what I need for
my earlier prediction to come true.... ;-) ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In the Red Sox defense, "they won before they lost" yesterday, to borrow
from John Kerry.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Looking at tonight's starters, I wouldn't be surprised if all four of
these teams won.  I still think it's unlikely the White Sox will miss
the playoffs...they only need to win 2/5 to clinch at least the wild
card (since the Yankees and Red Sox play each other, one of the two will
have at least 67 losses).  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Angels are finally playing well.  Good for them.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Going by demographics, if Cleveland misses the playoffs, Boston will be
the smallest city with an AL playoff team, behind the Big Three of
Chicago, NY, and Los Angeles.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
[insert standard Goz complaint about large market teams here]
<i>((See above, with just the slightest nuance....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
What really fascinates me is that San Diego is 78-79, which is good
enough for last place in the NL East, behind five other teams, but if
they win tonight, they've clinched the NL West!  If I were the MLB
commissioner, I would modify the rules so a sub-.500 team could not make
the playoffs.  If the entire division is below .500, take a second wild
card team instead!  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The NFL could do the same thing, to address the problem of one division
with the Bears, Vikings, Lions, and Packers, who all seem hapless right
now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I want to also unconvincingly deny the rumor that I'm the father of
Jennifer Garner's baby.

Last night's game was a must for the BoSox.  The victory by the White
Sox bench was a bonus.  Now the Red Sox achieve the meta-postseason
with one victory in two games.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think today's game is a must for the Yankees.  If they can't beat
Wakefield with Randy Johnson pitching, how will they beat Schilling
in a big game, even with Mussina on the mound?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I'm thinking that the broadcaster's dream has a high likelihood of
happening.  Namely, if the Sox and Yankees split these two games, and
the Indians win the last two against the White Sox, the Sox and
Yankees meet on Monday for the division crown, with the loser getting
the Indians on Tuesday for the wildcard.  Aye caramba!

Let's face it - the Indians have no chance.  Not because the Yankees
won't play hard tomorrow, or because they'll be unable to beat the
White Sox.  No, they face the karma of having Burgess pick them to
win the division!  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks to the Indians' choke, the Yankees have clinched, and have
apparently decided to save Mussina for the playoffs, leaving the Sox
with the tempting task of facing Jaret Wright and his astronomic ERA
and WHIP.  Also, Schilling will be on the mound.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I was unimpressed with Wakefield today until I remembered (or rather,
was reminded by news accounts) that he was pitching on 3 days rest.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Managers should know that nobody can pitch on 3 days rest anymore!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I caught the tail end of the game at a sports pub near Piccadilly
Circus.  It was populated almost entirely by Red Sox and Yankees fans
from the States.  It's a pub that features North American sports - a
very nice discovery.  For some reason 'Cheers', my first stop,
featured a Red Sox jersey and wall-to-wall TVs with English football.
What would Sam Malone say?  But the bouncer was kind enough to
direct me around the corner.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Anyway, the one thing all the Yankees and Red Sox fans could agree on
was that it was great that the White Sox won.  We were all White Sox
fans today.  :)

It's not just Jim-Bob.  I picked the Indians to win the division too (see 
Goz picks:  beginning 2005).  Hmm, I also had the Angels &amp; Yankees winning

<i>((Well, just for fun, let's look at all our picks....))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL West: Goz picked the Dodgers, I picked the Giants.  We were
both wrong, but I picked the Padres to be second and as my 
sleeper pick to win (Advantage Jim-Bob) ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL Central: We both picked the order right, but both of us thought
the Wild Card would come from the East.  I did predict that
Ken Griffey, Jr. would make a comeback this year, but that
wasn't enough to help the Reds - and he was injured at the end.
(Push) ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((NL East: We both had the Braves winning.  I thought that the
Marlins would be second and the Wild Card, you thought it would be the
Mets.
Phillies were my sleeper.  I really thought AJ Burnett really tanked
at the end, the Marlins shouldn't have been that bad, but they were.
(Very weak advantage Jim-Bob) ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL West: We both had the Angels winning, but I had the order of the
division right.  (Weak Advantage Jim-Bob)  ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL Central: You had the Indians winning (my sleeper) and I had the
Twins.  You had the White Sox higher (Weak Advantage Goz) ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((AL East: It really was a tie, and I said that the Yankees needed to
acquire five new players to survive that would make major contributions.
They got Cano, Giambi (who they already had, but was a surprise!),
Small, Chacon, and.... uh they never really did get a CF unless you
count Crosby (was he on the team at the beginning of the year???).
(Very Weak Advantage Jim-Bob for seeing the Blue Jays would be
third).  By the way, I think this is the EIGHTH straight season
the order has been Yankees, Red Sox, Blue Jays, Orioles, Devil Rays.
That must be a record.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((You predicted that the Braves would lose to the Yankees in the WS,
which could still happen.  I had Boston beating the Marlins, the
second part of which can't happen.  We'll see, if you ask me right
now, ANYONE can win.  I'm still sticking with Red Sox repeat, but
I really won't be surprised if even the Padres go to the WS.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Rick Desper (Mon, 3 Oct 2005 04:05:29 -0700 (PDT))</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
To compare...
my predictions from May

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had Sox AL East, O's WC, Twins AL Central, Angels AL West.
2/4 :(  (I'm counting the Sox.)  I was not a believer in the White
Sox and didn't think the Orioles would collapse completely.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL, I had Braves, Cards, Dodgers, and Marlins in WC.  I had Astros 2nd
behind the Cards, FWIW.  I said the Padres were 'almost there', so I
placed them correctly in terms of their win total, but overestimated
the Dodgers.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had Sox vs. St. Louis in World Series.  I still think the Cardinals
will be there, and in fact think they should be favored.  They get an
easy series with the Padres and then should be able to handle the
survivor of the Braves/Astros series.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The AL is harder to pick.  I'm still not impressed with the White
Sox, and think the Red Sox can take them.  But overall, the Red Sox
don't have enough pitching, and neither do the Yankees or the Angels.
Look at Game 2 between the Yankees and Angels: Shawn Chacon vs. John
Lackey.  None of the AL teams has more than one intimidating starter.
In contrast, consider the Braves/Astros series: Pettite vs. Smoltz
in Game 1, Clemens vs. Hudson in Game 2...and Roy Oswalt is still in
reserve for Houston.  If Houston's pitching gets hot, everybody else
needs to be wary.

<br /><br /><b>Warren Goesle (Mon, 3 Oct 2005 15:44:02 -0500)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
First off, a correction on Jim-Bob's:  For 6 years the AL East order was
NY, Boston, Baltimore, Toronto, Tampa Bay.  That continued until last
year when Toronto dropped behind Tampa Bay (!).  This year the Blue Jays
climbed over Tampa Bay and Baltimore.  However, I don't see how you
figure a tie for the AL East.  NY won, did it not?  Otherwise they'd be
going to Chicago, no?  A tie-break counts the same as a 1-game playoff
for the spot with some lightweight named "Bucky" hitting a 3-run homer
to win it, doesn't it?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Next, now that the matchups are set, it's time for the actual playoff
picks.  I'd like to say that I think things will happen as I said they
would in April, with the Yankees over the Braves, but I don't (What?!?!?
Goz is backing off on a prediction that hasn't even been proved wrong
yet?!?!?  Hey, it happens.  More often in football than baseball...).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 NLDS:  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
St. Louis vs San Diego:  Cardinals in 4, but only because San Diego
isn't really all that bad (are they?).  Too much O &amp; D from St. Louis.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Atlanta vs Houston:  This isn't an ordinary Braves' team.  They have
enough young players who don't really care about the history, even the
relatively recent history, of Braves' postseason failures.  I think this
series goes the limit, and won't be entirely surprised if Atlanta pulls
it out.  However, I'm picking Houston.  They get so many key pitching &amp;
hitting efforts, I can't dismiss them, so I say Houston in 5.  Maybe the
14th inning of the 5th game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 ALDS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Chicago vs Boston:  It's starting to look like the Red Sox are reading
Jim-Bob's diatribes on them, and believing them.  They really look set
up for a fall against a good team, emphasis on "team".  White Sox sweep
(you heard it here, from a Cubs' fan, first).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wandering Angels vs New York:  The Yankees have the experience.  They
have the hitting.  I think Aneheim (or wherever they play now) has
everything else, including the fact that apparently the Yankees are
distracted by what went on in Texas on Sunday.  I look for the Yankees
to blow a 2-1 game lead when they see the Red Sox are swept, and fall in
5.  Then, when Buck Showalter is fired as Texas manager, the Yankees
pick him up as a bench coach for 2006.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 NLCS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Houston vs St. Louis:  Goes 7, with the usual intrigue.  Might be the
best series of the season.  I look for the Astros to pull it out this
year, with a little deeper bench.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 ALCS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Angels vs White Sox:  Angels in 6.  Colon wins 2 against his former
team.  White Sox season declared a disaster by the local media (who
happen to own the Cubs, BTW).  Ozzie disappears for 18 months, and is
found in a Caracas flop-house, though not in time to manage anyone at
the start of '07.

Angels vs Astros:  Houston barely heard from.  Angels in 5.  Very few
people in California care, outside of the Governor and the makers of
some ugly mascot figures.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Can you explain to me how whether NY won the AL East or not depended
on whether Cleveland won or lost their last two games?  Cleveland's
not in the AL East, after all.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((If I read you right, I've had loads of people ask me this question
in the past few days, and I think I actually do understand it.
Are you asking, how come the Yankees win on a tie break ONLY
because the Indians lost and so are NOT tied with the Yankees
and the Red Sox?  In other words, if the Indians had won two of
three against the White Sox, then we'd be playing a game today.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((ANSWER: In baseball's infinite wisdom, you play extra games in
order to be IN or OUT of the playoffs.  You do NOT play extra
games in order to decide who is Division Champ and who is WC.
Simple as that.  In practical terms it meant this: Since the
Yankees and Red Sox were the only ones left standing at the
end, USE the tiebreak.  If Cleveland were tied with them in
a three way tie?  THEN, if we let the Yankees win the division
they would have NOT had to play an extra game, but would have
been IN the playoffs.  That violates the first rule.  So
Yankees and Red Sox must play for division title and then
whoever loses is tied with the Indians and plays for the WC.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((And I stand corrected by Goz on the division.  Well, the 
Yankees and Red Sox have finished 1-2 for 8 straight years.....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 NLDS:  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
St. Louis in 3.  Because somebody has to sweep.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think it will be St. Louis in 5, but only because Lawrence isn't
quite enough of a pitcher to win in the playoffs.  St. Louis
will have a tough time with this series.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Astros in 5.  Or Astros in 3.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I agree Astros win, so I'll say Houston in 4.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 ALDS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Chicago vs Boston:  Pshaw!  Last I heard, the White Sox' ace was Jose 
'Fenway scares the crap out of me' Contreras.  
Sox in 4.  Red Sox, that is.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think it will be tougher than that, Red Sox in 5.))</i>    

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wandering Angels vs New York:  Angels in 5.  Simply because they are better.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I think the Angels will sweep in 3.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 NLCS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
St. Louis in 7.  Similar to last year, but Houston now has Pettite,
while Cardinals now have Carpenter and Mulder.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Cardinals in 6, mostly just to be contrary.  It probably will go 7.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 ALCS:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Angels vs. Red Sox.  I think the lack of a bullpen will hurt the Red
Sox a little too much here.  The Angels are the most balanced team in
the AL right now.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((I will stick with my early season prediction, Red Sox in 6 or 7,
but if you guys are right, I won't be shocked.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 World Series:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Angels vs.  Cardinals.  I think the Astros have the best chance at
beating the Cards, actually.  I don't think the Angels have a starter
good enough to shut down the Cardinals' offense, with all due respect
to Bartolo Colon. And the Cards are better.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Red Sox-centric view wonders why Clemens was a great pitcher from
1986-1990, got lazy when he hit 30 and put up mediocre numbers, and
then rediscovered his desire to be a Hall of Famer when he left for
the Blue Jays (with an illegal deal in place in Toronto to allow him
to leave his contract after two years if the Blue Jays were still
languishing out of contention...)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
From 1993-1996, Clemens' last year in Boston, he went 40-39, his ERA
was over 4.00 twice, and his innings were way down.  Then he went to
Toronto and won more in 2 years than he had in the last four in
Boston.  <i>That's</i> why Red Sox fans are less than enamored with him
(that and his secret deal with the Blue Jays management).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Though I still believe that he wouldn't have been this good if
the Red Sox had gotten him back instead, and it would have meant
we never got Pedro... which is of course its own story....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Funny thing about yesterday's game: I turned on my laptop to watch
the MLB feed about 9 p.m. local time, figuring I'd watch the end of
the Astros/Braves game after catching up with the NFL scores.  It was
the 8th inning.  "Oh, I see the Braves are up 6-1", I thought, "this
shouldn't take long".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I had to turn it off at midnight, having already watched nine
innings, because I figured I needed to get a good night's sleep to
get some work done today.

Clemens did pitch well - I'll give him credit for that.  So did a lot
of other people last night.

Game 1 isn't until Wednesday, and Pettite will be well rested for
that.  If Rocket's too tired for Game 2, Oswalt won't be.  Don't
worry too much about the Astros.  That's part of why winning last
night's game was so vital for them.  In contrast, the White Sox are
going to be ready to ambush whoever the survivor of the
Angels/Yankees series will be.  I've been picking the Cardinals to
win it all for quite some time, and don't think I'd abandon them
quite yet.  But this Astros team is very good.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
El Duque simply killed the BoSox.  He's done it before and I fear
he'll keep doing it in the future.  When he's on his game, he is
truly an elite pitcher.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So of course he's not in the starting rotation for the White Sox for
the LCS.  Let's see...Freddy Garcia, El Duque, Freddy Garcia, El
Duque.  How can anybody choose Freddy Garcia there????  I know that,
if the Yankees make it to the LCS, Joe Torre will be thankful that he
won't have to face El Duque.

<i>((On the Astros in extra innings:))</i>
I was in and out of the TV room yesterday (and flipping from MLB to NFL
to NASCAR), and left in the bottom of the 8th.  Then 3 hours later I
logged onto ESPN.com and the headline suggested that they were still
playing, and it was in the 18th.  So I dragged Nathan into the room,
since I knew that, when he's a lot older than nearly-3, he'll want to
know he saw a part of the longest playoff game ever, and turned the TV
back on (there was a game early this year when Maddux was pitching
against Clemens and I dragged him into that one too, since I didn't
think he'd ever see another game started by two 300-win pitchers).  I
think it was on for about 8 minutes until the game ended.  Nathan left
after the top of the inning.  I suspect he's a closet Braves' fan.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>(( On: I wonder how the 'Stros will deal with the tired pitching vs. the

<div class="p"><!----></div>
They don't start playing until Wednesday.  Based on recent past
performance, Clemens can apparently start Game 1.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Goz Hypothesis for how the ALCS starts out, based on no data but fuzzy
feelings about physiology and sports:  whoever wins the Angels/Yankees
Game 5 tonight heads to Chicago, and since they're still on adreneline
and the White Sox are rusty, the visitors win Game 1.  However, after a
day to acclimate, the White Sox pound whoever is in town for Game 2,
when fatigue really hits them.  Then a day off Thursday and they pick up
Game 3 Friday, when things are more normal (well, normal for when a
Chicago team is in the playoffs).

 A.  No, there's no #45 on the White Sox and

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 St. Louis vs San Diego:

isn't quite enough of a pitcher to win in the playoffs.  St. Louis will
have a tough time with this series."

Advantage:  Rick

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((RICK: Yes!))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((JIM-BOB: Didn't realize there would TWO somebodies that had to sweep.

to playoff baseball, wrong, wrong, wrong....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Houston vs Atlanta:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Goz:  "I say Houston in 5.  Maybe the 14th inning of the 5th game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rick:  "Astros in 5.  Or Astros in 3."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob:  "I agree Astros win, so I'll say Houston in 4."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Advantage:  Jim-Bob, although I think I can claim a close 2nd.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((RICK: Hey, I had them bracketed!
Well, they played 45 innings, so I think I was closest.  :)  ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((JIM-BOB: I kinda think Goz gets extra credit for the extra innings comment.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Anaheim vs New York:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Goz:  "I look for the Yankees to blow a 2-1 game lead when they see the
Red Sox are swept, and fall in 5.  Then, when Buck Showalter is fired as
Texas manager, the Yankees pick him up as a bench coach for 2006."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rick:  "Angels in 5.  Simply because they are better."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob:  "I think the Angels will sweep in 3."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Slight advantage:  Rick, unless Showalter gets fired.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((RICK: And gets hired by the Yankees...since the Angels had the 2-1 lead,
not the Yankees.))  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((JIM-BOB: Yeah, yeah....))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Chicago vs Boston:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Goz:  "White Sox sweep (you heard it here, from a Cubs' fan, first).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Rick:  "Sox in 4.  Red Sox, that is."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Jim-Bob:  "I think it will be tougher than that, Red Sox in 5."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Advantage:  Goz

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((RICK: Was I going to pick against the Red Sox in the first round???))

((JIM-BOB: Ditto, in retrospect, I was clearly going for all heart as the
White Sox really did dominate.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Now that the salad course is out of the way, on to the LCS.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I think that the Angels arrive in Chicago full of adreneline, and win
Game 1, while the White Sox are rusty.  Then in Game 2, fatigue hits and
the White Sox win in a blow out.  The series heads to Anaheim, and the
Angels win Games 3 and 4, only briefly getting interrupted by a good
Contrearas outing in Game 5, then come back to Chicago and win Game 6 to
punch their ticket.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((RICK: I think the White Sox look good..  Angels just announced that Colon
won't even be on the roster for this series.  When I picked them
earlier to make the WS, I was counting on a healthier team.  Don't be
surprised if the Angels win.
I really don't feel like changing my picks, so I 'll stick with
Anaheim... in 7.  Contreras will pitch well, but Garcia, Buehrle, and
Garland are all hittable.  Angels have better bullpen and more
playoff experience.  And they have Thunder Stix.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((JIM-BOB: I'd say White Sox in 5, but I wouldn't be surprised by a sweep.
Tonight, if the Angels win it is on pure emotion.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Houston wins in 7.  Clemens gets 2 wins, 2 saves and hits a game winning
homer in Game 3.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((RICK: *chortle*  Calm down, you can remove the shrine to Clemens now.  
Again, I don't feel like changing my picks.  The Cardinals have
better hitting.  While the Astros have a deeper rotation, the
Cardinals do have good pitching, too.  
Clemens loses two games as a starter, and blows two saves.  Actually,
since you can blow a save in a game your team wins...Clemens loses
two games as a starter and blows five saves.  :)  Sets the record for
blown saves in a playoff series.  
And then, after losing Game 7, his head explodes.  
:)  (Cards in 7)  ))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((JIM-BOB: Cards in however many I said before, since I also don't want to
change my pick.  I think the Cards will win in less than 7 at
the moment though, perhaps I'm too swayed the other direction by
the sweep.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
World Series:  Other than a brief hiccup in Game 3 when some old fart
throws a two-hitter against them, the Angels dominate and win in 5.
Garrett Anderson drives in Guerrero 8 times during the series.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((RICK: What did I say before?  I don't remember.  I know I picked the Cards.
I'll say 6 games.  Bartolo Colon comes back for the WS, and loses
two starts.))  

<div class="p"><!----></div>

In a sweep over the Cards, yes two in a row!))</i>

Headline in this morning's Chicago Tribune:  "Party Like It's 1959!".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There's an ugly thought.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I've heard sentiments from White Sox "fans" similar to those of
Jim-Bob's and Rick's today...that is, they seem extremely pleased to see
the Yank...er...the Cubs fail.  Any year that the Cubs don't get in the
World Series is a good year in their book, so they're already on a
97-year winning streak.  Lord knows what would happen if the White Sox
actually won the WS.  I'm not certain many of them can comprehend that
situation (after all, it's been a while for them too).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So to see the previous notes just reminds me that between 1919 and 2003
the Red Sox' fans went 59-26 and kinda puts it into perspective.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Based on the way everything is going now the White Sox should win it.

Allegedly a Chicago team made the World Series.  
For my Cardinals prediction to come true, they need to be Clemens,
Oswald, and Pettite in succession, though not necessarily in that
order.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The White Sox have hit the 'perfect storm' where all of their
starters are pitching well at the same time.  We should give credit
to their pitching coach.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And clearly, as we saw in the LCS, the key for the White Sox to win
is to not use their bullpen.  At all.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I want to see how George Steinbrenner reacts to seeing Contreras, El
Duque, Clemens, and Pettite all in the World Series.  Wait - didn't
they all used to be on the same team somewhere?  It was pretty
recent, you think I'd be able to remember where.

It looks like I will be wrong about the other series, but it
will be worth it to see "George's Perfect Storm" with all those

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Thanks for the kind words about the A's.  I'm not at all bitter about 
them missing the playoffs again.  They played pretty well this season, 
considering - other teams have one or two years of rebuilding; Billy 
Beane has one or two *months* of rebuilding - but ultimately they 
didn't deserve it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Going into the last series with Anaheim, we were counting the games as 
the A's fell farther behind:  If the A's sweep the Angels, then they're 
even for the last three games; if they take three of four, we still 
have a chance but not a good one.  Everyone was focusing on how it was 
an uphill battle against the odds. But the reality is it wasn't just 
the numbers that were against us. The Angels were simply playing better 
baseball than the A's in September.  The odds of us winning four games 
out of four was considerably less than the straight coin-flipping 1 in 
16.  The better team won the pennant.  That's as it should be.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You've probably heard by now that Macha won't be back as manager.  By 
the time you read this they may have already announced his successor, 
or Macha may be hired somewhere else.  The story has been spun in a 
wide variety of ways, depending on the writer's take on the whole 
Beane/Moneyball drama, but it was really very straightforward.  Macha's 
first contract has run out, and the standard procedure in baseball is 
that a successful manager gets renewed with a nice big pay increase, 
just like players do.  Beane doesn't believe in that.  He thinks of the 
manager in the same category as the scouting director or head trainer 
- a specialized middle manager within the organization. Yes, he 
matters, but no he doesn't embody the team, as the baseball romantics 
like to believe.  As a result of the general mis-estimation of a 
manager's importance, any manager with a reputation is overpaid.  So 
long as Macha was cheap, he was fine.  As soon as he wants to get 
anything more than that, even if it is modest compared to the manager 
market at large, the A's are no longer interested in him.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So Beane put out an offer which was as much as he intends to pay any 
manager.  Macha's agent came back with a much larger offer, as if 
there'd be a negotiation.  Beane said, "No, that *was* the final 
offer", so Macha walked.  In spite of all the happy talk - "He/this is 
a great manager/job and we'd love to be/have him back again next year" 
- both sides telegraphed their intentions pretty clearly, and anyone 
who could read between the lines was not at all surprised.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For Macha's replacement, two names are getting all the play.  Ron 
Washington gets mentioned because he's a great coach, a great guy with 
lots of charisma, and everyone in any way associated with the A's loves 
him.  Bob Geren gets mentioned because, barring calamity, he's the guy 
who's gonna get the job.  Washington is the current 3rd base coach who 
also trains the infielders on defense. He is universally praised for 
the job he does, both for teaching fielding - he's the guy Eric Chavez 
gave one of his Gold Gloves to - and for mentoring the young guys 
psychologically.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Some say that Washington is too "old school" to be a good fit for the 
A's organizational philosophy, or - again depending on the writer's 
viewpoint - that Beane is an egotistical bastard who won't dare hire 
anyone who isn't a yes-man, which Wash isn't.  I don't quite believe 
that.  If Washington had a problem with the A's organizational 
philosophy, he'd be gone by now.  There have been plenty of other 
coaches who've strayed from the path and been exiled.  I think the real 
problem is that Wash has no virtually no experience in a managerial 
role.  He's very good where he is now, but whether that skill would 
carry over to the manager role is less certain.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Meanwhile, Geren was very successful managing the AAA team in 
Sacramento for a few years, and then he put in two years in Oakland 
first as the 1B coach and then as the bullpen coach.  He's worked with 
most of the players on the team both in Sacramento and in Oakland.  Oh, 
and he happens to be one of Beane's closest personal friends. The A's 
like to promote guys through the ranks and it's obvious that it's 
Geren's turn.  So obvious that insiders were predicting this more than 
a year ago.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Meanwhile, Macha is likely to get hired somewhere else if he wants it.  
All the talk is about Pittsburgh, since that's his home.  Ron 
Washington is mentioned a lot for the Tampa Bay job, which seems like a 
particularly good fit for him.  I think the A's would love to keep him 
as 3B coach, but if he gets a better offer elsewhere and moves on, 
he'll go with the team's blessing.  If he becomes Tampa Bay's manager, 
the entire Athletics Nation will immediately become avid Devil Ray fans 
- not much of a stretch, since they already hate both the Yankees and 
the Red Sox.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But I wouldn't be much good as <i>TAP</i>'s A's correspondent if everything I 
tell you is what you can read in the sports pages yourself, so here's a 
few outside-of-the-box ideas to chew on.  By definition, these aren't 
really predictions, as neither of them is even 50% likely to happen.  
But I'd say they're much more than 0% likely, which is about what you 
might otherwise think.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(1) Huston Street could be traded.  Yes, we know that Beane doesn't 
like to give up a huge potential talent who is young enough to have 
many years of cheap salary ahead of him.  Then again, who does?  
Precocious talent is a recognized commodity now - recognized to the 
point that it is perhaps no longer underrated.  Street was a highly 
esteemed college prospect, but in his final year his stock dropped a 
little, so that Beane was able to get him at the end of the first round 
rather than the beginning.  Then he bounced back and surprises everyone 
by not only zooming through the minors to make it to the big leagues in 
one year, but also stepping right into the closer role and showing 
every sign of being top-notch at it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
My point is not that Beane doesn't value Street; surely he does.  My 
point is that Street might be more valuable in what another team would 
give up for him than he is staying with the team. The meteoric rise 
could be evidence that he's the new Mariano Rivera ... or it might be 
that he's a good pitcher who just had a particularly good season so now 
it's time to move him while his stock is at its highest.  If Beane is 
going to go after a big bat or some other hot commodity that everyone 
else is after, he's going to have to give something up.  Street could 
well be the extra piece that makes it happen.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(2) Rich Harden could end up in the bullpen.  Yes, we love Harden, and 
we've already signed him to a contract extension.  But the one thing 
that Harden has yet to prove he can do is stay healthy for an entire 
season.  Maybe that's a fluke and when he finally gets a complete 
season in good health he'll be a Cy Young candidate.  Or maybe it means 
he's good but fragile.  If it's the latter, I think they'll contemplate 
moving him, possibly to be the closer. He, too, has the sort of stuff 
that could be the new Mariano Rivera.

<i>((Hi Mark, more on the details later, but I've heard that Macha may
have miscalculated based on the jobs available and may be "stuck"
with Tampa Bay.  This may not be entirely bad, he may do a good
job with that team, but he also won't get THAT much more money
than he would have gotten with the A's.  I'm not surprised about
that assessment.  We are going through the reverse here in Boston
right now as Theo Epstein views himself as the GM in the Beane
mold, so he should be the "guy who gets the credit and gets paid"
but the Red Sox brass view him more as another of the team of
middle managers.  So Theo might walk in basically the same fashion.
I agree with Billy Beane and thus the Red Sox would be making 
a huge mistake.
LATE WORD: Beane hires Macha back!!!))</i>

This probably doesn't mean much to you outside of the Bay Area media 
market, but looking back over the stories I see that: (1) Susan Slusser 
had an editorial on Macha's rehiring up on the web less than an hour 
after the public announcement was made; (2) in the newspaper that same 
day, Ray Ratto had an editorial speculating about what outsider might 
get hired.  Guess who's in touch with the team and who's not.  Ratto is 
a windbag.  I don't think he has any sources at all.

<i>((I basically think the story was the reality in this case.  Macha
intended to get another job, but saw that it was likely that
Tampa Bay was going to be the only opportunity, with that 
knowledge, and the knowledge of the cold calculating style
of Billy Beane, he knew that it was going to be a difficult
phone call, but he could get back in with a contract at what
Billy Beane was willing to pay.  I'm not really that surprised.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>Mark D Lew (Mon, 17 Oct 2005 23:54:05 -0700)</b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
But around here the "story" was that Macha's phone call really wasn't
intended renegotiate.  It came out of collegial post-employment
communication (which the A's organization is known for) that eventually
turned around to the idea of a rehire, even though that wasn't anyone's
original intention.  Whether that's actually what happened, I don't
know, but that was the story.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
POSTSCRIPT: It seems that what "the story" was depends on whether the
writer interviewed Macha or Beane....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Today A's picked up Payton's contract.  If I'd had to guess on this I
probably would have guessed no, but it was close to 50-50, I thought.
Yabu is gone, which is zero surprise.  Still no word on Hatteberg's
option, but everyone knows they won't pick that up.  The question is
whether they let him go outright or renegotiate a new one-year contract
at a lower rate.  If Hatteberg is signed it would be as a bench player
and veteran presence.  I think it's pretty clear his days as a starter
are over, but they might still like him on the team as a backup.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
POSTSCRIPT: People are already speculating that we signed him just to
use as trade bait.
We'll see how that plays out.
At this point, probably even Billy doesn't know; he loves to keep
his options open.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Terry is still having some medical problems, but rather than hold up
the game anymore, Eric Ozog has agreed to pay attention to the game and
negotiate and submit orders for Terry.
We all hope this will be a brief interlude.
Eric originally brought Terry into the Diplomacy hobby all those many
years ago, and so I'm glad he's agreed to do this.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Buddy Tretick is preparing to move, but his new address is not
active yet, so I continue to list the current one.
If he moves in between deadlines here, he may wish to let other
players know directly.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS):  The overwhelming demands made against the French Government by the
English has caused us to reconsider our best hope, thus declaring war against
the English.  Sorry that the deadline past us by before we made that
decision, otherwise we would have sent our declaration earlier, which would have
benefited out ally, Russia.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(STAR TREK PRESS, EPISODE TWO, "MESSAGE RECEIVED" (Captain Pike's Log)): 
I received a communication from the Cardassians requesting a non-aggression
pact and that's fine with me.
We both are going to send an expedition to Cetae Alpha 6 to search for
dilithium but I think the Cardassians will get there first.
We are short on resources so we have to try.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(A CONVERSATION BETWEEN 7 OF 9 (7) AND CAPTAIN PIKE (P)):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7: I'm curious how you got away from Talos 4?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P: Talos 4?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7: In my universe, our history shows that you went there twice,
the last time as an invalid to live out your life?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P: In this universe, I never went to Talos 4.
The Enterprise led by Captain Jim Kirk went there
and was never heard from again.
The Andorians also sent a ship there, and it also was
never heard from again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7: Then this universe is an alternate reality?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P: Apparently I've been transported 75 years into the future.
Maybe we should see who our shipmates are?
(At that moment, a young boy about 10 years old walks into
the Conference Room with a mechanical robot at his side.)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P (A little confused, looks at him): Who are you and who is
your friend?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
THE BOY (Looking a little puzzled himself, looks at Captain Pike):
My name is Will Robinson, and I'm the Chief Engineer.
This is my assistant, Robby the Robot. (bad Trek music!)

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7: Wait a minute, you can't be Chief Engineer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WILL ROBINSON (W): Why not?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
7: First, you're too young!
Second, this is a Star Trek spinoff series!
You belong on Lost in Space!
And third, we need a warp engine specialist, not a jump gate specialist!
<i>((Did they really have Jump Gates on Lost in Space.....?))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
W: I think it's a Union thing!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P: Wow!
I really miss Gene Roddenberry!.... (Bad Lost in Space music)
<i>((Well, I don't know, I think Gene got in lots of Union trouble....
especially with the pot smoking.... and the casting couch fooling around.))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
P: I guess it doesn't matter, the children of Tamari are just going to
wipe us out anyway....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(OZOG-WORLD): I am merely the steward of Germany until the 
Toadfather's return, and will carry out his orders.  
All previous arrangements, relationships, (and lack thereof) are still valid.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to OLD FRIEND ERIC): I cannot think of another person who 
would be better to fill in for the Toadfather than you and I thank
you profusely for doing it!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(ERIC-UNCLE BERNIE): And the Toadfather says you still speak 
with forked tongue, no matter how you package it.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB CAN'T HELP COMMENTING): It seems like EVERYONE wanted England to have
Sweden, isn't that strange???
I'm not sure in all my years of dipping if I've seen quite that set of moves.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Note that Sean still should submit a retreat as it might affect an
outcome in the game.
But thanks, Sean, for playing!!!
Don's retreat matters less, but thanks also to Don for playing.
That's two players out in Fall 1905, five of you remaining.
I think this season ranks among some of the largest center shifts among
all the powers I've seen in a dip game, not necessarily the most builds
and removals, but lots of center trading and jockeying, even among those
who nominally are even for Winter.
Now what?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(SEAN-JEFF): Well, it looks as though I've beaten Dad in making bad decisions 
for marriage. Kinda funny if you look at it in a certain point of view 
because now it makes Russia and France look oh so good.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM-BOB to SEAN): I hope that doesn't mean what I think it means.....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(CAPTAIN'S LOG): It's just a matter of time.
The Romulans are coming and we have no allies.
The Klingons are about to get exterminated, we have 
lost one starbase to the Romulans and have a 50-50 shot at
losing another.
The only good news is that our Breen allies are wiping out
the Tribbles and we might pick up a starbase.
Mr. Spock estimates our chances of that are about 1 in 3.
We don't have the resources to stop the Romulans and 7 of 9
is still missing.
There will be no help from the Ferengi.
The only good thing is the Tribbles will fall before we will 
(Yippee!).... Kirk Out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to JEFF): I just had to add that, it needed to be said....

1) The FREGT draw is rejected and then reproposed.
We now 
require everyone to vote every season, no perpetual draw votes.
And failure to vote would be a yes.
So actually technically you don't HAVE to vote, since
this does NOT mean the game will just be ended by the GM, 
it just means someone must veto the draw every turn.
So it is just draw vetoers who must vote.
At least one person continues to veto the proposal.
This proviso will be in place at least until the Fall turn.
At that point, we'll see if anything substantial actually changes.
