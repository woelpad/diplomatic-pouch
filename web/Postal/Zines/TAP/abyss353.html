This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so
we keep going.  I'd like to keep writing and doing some game GMing (note that has
been expanding). 
I'm set on the GMing, and I'm starting to write a bit, hope there might be more.
Let's get the new Diplomacy game going.
Since Doug may be winding down, I may have to flip that back around again and be
the centerpiece for all the subszines, we'll see.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.

Richard Thompson's appearance down here (over in Fall River) sold out almost
as soon at the tickets went on sale, and I couldn't go that night anyway
but from my house in Maine on Columbus Day weekend, Ghod was playing at the
new theatre in the Westbrook, ME middle school.  I'm going to split this up
into multiple parts going into next issue.  Richard is doing this tour to
support a new acoustic album that mostly recrafts old hits (if you can call
his songs hits, as he joked during the concert).  So, it was him and an 
acoustic guitar, until the encores. 
Then he brought on electro-acoustic violinist Joyce Andersen, who I think
is supporting some more of his shows, but I'm not sure how many.  
It was an amazing concert, more below.))</i>

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that continues to be distorting, but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started last January, it probably will be going on for at least 
another year,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
And then I could have soloed the second game, but well, I can't exactly 
say how I did it, but the Canadian player soloed there, with help from me.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, and now I'm waiting for 
my next game to start, you can join and get more games going!!!
You can easily throw games, and in this format you can do it.
I wonder why people like to drop the levels of the game in this way.
It fascinates me.
But in the finals of this tournament, it shouldn't happen, should it?
The rules for the finals have been tweaked and the finals 
are now starting, everyone has been queried.
But you also still can join the qualifiers, openings are there now!!!
Word is we may cancel them, I think the finals should reignite interest.
We also are picking up some discussion for a successor Diplomacy World Cup.
I think we all realize that this interesting experiment has not been completely
successful.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) Thanks for the press, we had lots of you promising more, but it didn't quite come.
I would remind you in the TAP tradition to promote press, that the deadline for Fall 1901
is not technically until December, the next deadline is a press only Summer 1901 season.
If you want to move along faster, send orders and tell me they're final, but otherwise,
write some more press.  I had a couple of you say the deadline sneaked up on you a bit,
feel free to take a bit longer for Fall.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILL ABBOTT, GERMANY): I never had the honor of playing with Don Williams. 
I have not appeared often in the pages of <i>TAP</i>. Nonetheless, 
I avidly read <i>TAP</i> when it comes out, even the game reports. 
The games with Don were usually the ones with the most entertaining press. 
Even in the items he did not write, he was often a leading character, and
he seemed to bring out creativity in others. I can only hope to write 
press as entertaining as that which I read in his games. 
I also encourage my fellow players to strive for this level.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Me too, I don't think any of my press over the last four decades would
have been anywhere near as good without Don's influence.
It probably still is pretty lame...))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I strongly believe that Diplomacy can be a spectator game. 
I have been around the championship game at Gencon several times, 
and it always attracts not only other players from the tournament, 
but wandering gamers who may not have played for years, or ever. 
I find the showcase games in <i>Diplomacy World</i>, with their 
commentary, extremely interesting and entertaining. 
In a game like this, without the commentators, the best way to 
make it a spectator game is through press. 
The readers can't see our negotiations, but we can make it a fun game 
for them by entertaining them in the public press.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to GM): I was considering doing 57 duck jokes, followed by 57 toad jokes. 
I was afraid that you wouldn't be down with that, 
and I didn't want the press in this game to croak.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AUSTRIA to ITALY): "Trust me"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY to INDIA): Watch out, I'm coming East!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(JIM to GANG): "Indians scattered on dawns highway bleeding, 
ghosts cloud the young child's fragile eggshell mind."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RICHARD THOMPSON to BOOB): How'd I do?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB to RICHARD THOMPSON): Quite good!
Despite your cold, the singing and arrangements were very powerful.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MUNICH to KIEL): How do you have a whole fleet? You're just part of a boat!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KIEL to BOARD): Anyone know a cure for the Heligoland Blight? 
I hope it's not contagious.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(WILL to BOARD): If you're stabby and you know it draw your knife,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 If you're stabby and you know it draw your knife,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 If you're stabby and you know it,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 then your face will never show it,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 If you're stabby and you know it draw your knife.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(PARIS): This morning the new Premier of France dedicated the largest 
war memorial in European history, the Arc d’Don Williams.  
"This memorial celebrates the great victories of our soldiers over the 
last thousand years under the leadership of Field Marshal, Marquis Don Williams,"
the Premier remarked.   
"Under Marquis Williams, every nation in Europe has bowed to the French 
will and, in his honor, they will continue to bow in the future!"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Unnoticed in the crowd were the quiet orders issued to the French army and 
fleet to sally forth.   
As the fleet in Brest slipped its anchors, La Marseillaise was heard blasting 
from every ship, "Aux armes, les citoyens..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
In Marseilles, troops hailed their generals and pledge fealty to the Premier 
and started on the long arduous march across the Pyrenees.   
"We love our Italian brothers, but the Spanish scum must be tamed," 
noted one poilu after receiving their orders.   
Press inquiries were quietly rebuffed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(KOBLENZ, GERMANY): The trio of agents from the Imperial Chamberlain's 
office escorted Wilhelm Fedewa out of his house at 57 Erwinsstrasse. 
The four of them enter a stagecoach waiting for them. 
Beside the driver is an armed soldier, and two additional stagecoaches full 
of soldiers form an escort. One soldier in the second of them says to another, 
"Do you think that Karl Benz's new motorized carriage will replace these?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Not for military use," says his companion. "They are too complicated. 
Besides, a good horse is faster."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The agents and Fedewa ignore this. 
Once in the stagecoach, the most senior agent addresses the new Kaiser. 
"Before your coronation, we need to do two things. 
First, we need to visit parts of your realm. We shall take you to Munich, 
where you will meet with the Duke of Bavaria. 
Then, we shall take you to Kiel, where you will inspect the fleet. 
After your visits, we will take you to Berlin, 
where you will meet your staff and plan your coronation."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Ordo Romanus 45," the new Kaiser replied.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Entschuldigen Sie, bitte?" Excuse me, Sire?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I want the basis of my coronation to be the ritual in Ordo Romanus 45. 
The monastery at St. Gall has a copy."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"St. Gall is in Switzerland."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Find a patriotic monk, and send him there for a copy."

1) The DIAS, EF, EFR, and concession to E all failed.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Rules at:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 http://diplom.org/DipPouch/Postal/Zines/TAP/Tinamou/rules/BreakingAway.htm

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint (40/80) and final (120) lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out based on doing this
before, about half the players will get scores below 5% and getting
better than a 10% score will be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) More records for low replenishment.  Racing Froggy has no points, but is
catching up in total replenishment, will he break out soon?

which is just as well because I don't think you'll hear us from way back here."

continue to multiply like weeds...
I'd like to get more people engaged here, not just the usual suspects from Doug's games.
The full rules for Where in the World is Kendo Nagasaki are
in: http://www.whiningkentpigs.com/DW/es58.pdf.
The player who was closest for Turn 9 has been notified by E-Mail.
Note that the official rules say you're supposed to get this by TURN 10,
so you have one more shot.

<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD</i>:
So, let's finish off this page with the first part of a review of both the
Richard Thompson concert and the accompanying album <b>Acoustic Classics</b>. 
I decided intentionally to refrain from buying or listening to the album
until after the concert and I didn't write down all the songs he played in
almost two hours including the encore.  
But I think he played nearly all of the fourteen tracks on the album.
And to me it easily is his best album in the last couple of decades
on first listen and hearing the songs in concert.
Of course, that at least partly is because it could be viewed as a
"greatest hits" album, although most people wouldn't put such a
downer song as "From Galway to Graceland" on a greatest hits album.
Richard Thompson is a ghod of modern music to those of us absolutely
convinced that he is primarily for two reasons.
First, he is flat out 100 percent THE best guitar picker alive, and
possibly ever.
I didn't hear some of the classic mid-20th century pickers live, so 
I won't make comparisons that are two strong.
I say specifically "pickers" since his picking style is fast, light,
tuneful, and pretty much unlike anything anyone else can do.
But I wouldn't try to line Thompson up against the standard rock guitar
heroes.  Neither the insiders like Steve Val and Jim McCarty nor the
classics like Pete Townsend, Keith Richards and Eric Clapton play anything like Richard.
Jeff Beck and Jimi Hendrix are the comparisons to me for their unique
styles of playing.  Somehow Richard Thompson never ends up on these
lists, and I simply don't get it.  Really!
"1952 Vincent Black Lightning" has always been the song you send people
to in order to demonstrate the whole package, the tune, the concept of the song,
the songwriting and singing, and above all the guitar picking.
You sort of knew before you even started that this song would be
on this album, in this tour, and be a true acoustic classic
(the 1991 original also was acoustic, but I think this one benefits
from all of Richard's work on improving the resonance of his rich baritone voice).
This version is the all-time keeper for me already.
Taking songs from their full band versions to stripped down acoustic
guitar solos has been a bit of a mainstay in the music world for a while
now, but Richard is nothing if not blatantly uncommercial in his approach,
so it is unsurprising that he hits up this idea now rather than ten years
ago when it was really hot.
Richard last released an acoustic album like this in 1982, "Small Town 
Romance", that I have on vinyl and haven't played in two decades!
Second, of course, is that Richard Thompson's choices always are uniquely
his own and emphatically non-commercial.
If you really want to study this in depth, and I have, though I don't expect
you to do so.  The way to do it is to compare closely the released version of
perhaps his best album ever, <b>Shoot Out the Lights</b> with the Gerry Rafferty
mixed "supposed" commercially mastered version that you can find on CD if you
look about enough.
Listening to this version, that both Richard and Linda Thomposon hated, and pretty
much everyone thought was a failure with hindsight in tow, there is NO doubt
to me at all, though I infinitely prefer almost all of the versions in the 
released album, that this album would have been the hit that Richard Thompson
never had.
But why would he do that?
I am pretty darned sure he is happier doing what he did and being as aggressively
non-commercial as he is.
Thus, he is the indie's indie hero.
