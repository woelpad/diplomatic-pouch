<p><br><p><br>I don't think I have much else to say, but to call attention to the
various game openings.
I'm stretching myself a bit so you can be SURE that this rash of 
game openings will drop to ZERO shortly.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Note the price increases for games, with the rates for subbing to the
szine holding fixed for the moment.
After the current series of games, I probably won't
start another until the Modern game ends.
The new game at that point probably will be another Modern game
with the ``Wing'' rule.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR ALAN STEWART</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>Alan Stewart was the editor of <i>Praxis</i>, possibly one of the
hobby's most literate szines ever.
Alan was from Toronto, Ontario and his szine enjoyed about
three glorious, trailblazing years in the hobby from 
November 1985 until early 1989.
I have a feeling there might be people out there who are
still in touch with Alan, but he also might be eminently 
findable on the Internet.
Go find him.
Isn't the $50 worth it??

<p>
I finally have letters from Bernie and his son Jim below
and I have decided to start another regular Diplomacy
game since Bernie wants to play as Buddy Tretick.
Join him, some of you old pals of his??
More on that in the game opening list below.
 
<p>
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.
Go for these guys again.
Perhaps some of them now can be located via the Internet where they
weren't when you looked before.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Jim Tretick (Mon, 12 Jul 1999 11:09:36 EDT)</b>

<p>
Greetings Jim:  It was good to get your sample zine.

<p>
My current address is: 12925 Circle Drive, Rockville, MD 20850.

<p>
I will contact my Dad and see if he wants to be found. You understand how that
is. I will definitely send him The Search for Bernie Oaklyn page. That was a
blast. Thanks for those kind words. You really did understand the man. He will
love it.
<i>((Well, almost.... see below.))</i>

<p>
Now, this in no way implies that Bernie Oaklyn is my Dad. That's not what my
Birth Certificate says.
<i>((Indeed.))</i>

<p>
Also. I don't believe I ever played in <i>The Front du Lib du Dip</i> 
as James Alan.  I played in others zines.
<i>((All that is from memory, so you may well be correct.
I know you played in Eric Ozog's szine.))</i>

<p>
Are Boardman and Walker still around?  The above-mentioned parental unit will
probably not want to be associated with them at all. And, I've been trying to
get Mr. Tretick to come back and play for years.
<i>((Undoubtedly.
I expect to get trashed again in a <b>Graustark</b> editorial about this
and the likelihood of me getting a comment out of Rod Walker any more is
really low, approaching infinitesmal; however, without ``whoever he is''
I wouldn't be in this hobby today.
PERIOD.
That's worth a lot of slack in my book....))</i>

<p>
Dad is away right now so hasn't seen your zine. I wanted to wait for his
impression before I wrote back to you. However, I would be interested in
playing myself, so I will look over the zine for openings.
<i>((I'm opening a game with Buddy Tretick in it.
At one point, Boardman Number rules had games with relatives in them
dubbed ``irregular''.  
This is no longer the case.
Recently, I did a game with brothers Randy and Jeff Ellis in it, they
even played adjacent countries.
So, feel free to join that new game, or something else.))</i>

<p>
Dad and I are working on a new game. He the rules and me the map. Maybe we'll
be able to hawk it through you. We'll discuss this later.
<i>((Absolutely!
We'll work something out.))</i>

<p>

<center>Cheers, Jim; Please send all correspondence to JTreti of aol.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((I ``understand" completely.  If your father hasn't moved from the Conaty
Circle address, then he has received in the mail the last couple of
issues.
It's good to hear from you too as I recall lots of fun games we
were in together way back when.  Though Walker and Boardman are
still around (John Boardman did write a little editorial about
my search), life in the hobby is VERY relaxed these days.  I
don't think returning (from either of you) would be any problem
at all.  I'm printing lots of rules in the upcoming issue from
variants that I and my subszine editors are running, so I
hope you can find something that interests you.
Now, for the man named Bernard ``Buddy" Tretick.....))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Buddy Tretick (Tue, 13 Jul 1999 17:04:46 EDT)</b>

<p>
Why, Jim, I was not even hiding.  After all, I did register with AOL, and I
found myself on several search engines.  That has got to be a first for me,
finding myself, that is.

<p>
Thank you for the kind statements you made about me, I guess.  The problem is
those statements you made that are not, and were not, true.

<p>
You must remember that, as a beginning Gamesmaster, pushed into the hobby by
... what was his name ... he lived in Wheaton, Maryland ... oh, Don Miller
... was it not.

<p>
This stuff about me changing players orders was sure false.  I kept all of
those letters all of these years and can disprove any such statement.  I also
saved at least one copy of all of my zines.  Documented proof that will stand
up in any court in the land.
<i>((I have no intention of fighting any old battles about any of those
types of issues.
Apologies from me for saying that and, no, we ain't goin' to court about 
this or anything else.))</i>

<p>
Yes, my brother in law was a guest GM in my zine.  He would lay incoming mail
on the stairs going up to his room and his mother would move that mail.  She
would lay his mail on a table in the living room, where he usually did not
go, and promptly cover that mail up with a magazine or the newspaper.  So,
Ray lost a lot of mail, and a lot of players missed their moves.  Why I
should be blamed for something his mother did in his name is beyond me.
<i>((Well, I get blamed for everything Pete Gaughan does in his subszine,
so why not???))</i>

<p>
I started playing these games [after a few games of stab, stab, stab], to win
... to take first place, usually without other survivors.  I thought that was
too easy, so I decided to play a much harder game, to bring my allies to
victory with the understanding that I would survive the game.  Now that took
skill.  I am still practicing that to this day in the many [more private]
email games.

<p>
You were not the first to find me.  Several others sent mail to my house
addressed to a Bernie Oaklyn.  I finally had to notify the Post Awful that I
would be accepting mail for Bernie Oaklyn.  After all, the intent of the mail
was for me.  You guys have been trying to ``prove" that Buddy Tretick is
Bernie Oaklyn.
<i>((Not especially, I just wanted to find you again, just like I refound
Dan Stafford, Mike Mills, John Michalski, and others during this series....))</i>

<p>
I even read an article in some gamezine telling about an airline pilot, a
Captain no less, named Bassett.  He reportedly visited Bernie Oaklyn in his
home.  The story told of how Bassett took liberties and moved through that
house and looked at all papers, only to find papers with the name Bernie
Oaklyn thereon.  Hey, I have a passport with the name Bernard A. Tretick,
huh!  Won't stand up in court either, Jim.

<p>
Nice article, nonetheless.

<p>
Okay, sign me up for a game of regular diplomacy and then please recommend
similar games to me for my review and possible play.  Order of preferences

A VERY light discussion is taking place that will address what 
stance we (the hobby) should take (proactive in some way for sure) 
toward Hasbro, the new owners of the rights to Diplomacy.
More on this will be forthcoming, but it looks like Hasbro might
have its version of Diplomacy on the market for the Christmas
season and they actually will be employing ``play-testers''.
No word on precisely what this means yet, could it mean that
they will offer a series of ``official'' variants?

<p>
Just another bit of news on the 99 Masters Email Tournament. We have finalized 
a FAQ concerning what we envision when we speak about Cross Gaming. It is 
posted on the Tournament Site at http://worldmasters99.diplomacy.org.uk

<p>
In a nutshell, it indicates that the obvious and rightly despised ``You throw 
this game, I'll throw that" are not within the scope of approved tactics. 
Neither is the ``get six bums to take a dive for you" method. 

<p>
Metagame get the leader campaigns, character assassination, all are tried and 
true Diplomacy tactics. Spreading them around to a large group of boards we 
hope will add a new wrinkle. 

<p>
Also, while we stand by our position that we feel making rules against cross 
gaming  to be tilting at windmills, we do make it clear that the overall value 
position of the Diplomacy community will likely punish players and teams that 
use less than acceptable cross gaming tactics. In other words, fair warning 
that teams that wish to experiment with lowball tactics will likely find 
themselves pigpiled so fast they won't know what hit them.

<p>
Also, Stephan Degremont is in charge of putting together the matrix that will 
distribute players to boards and he informs me that if we do indeed have 
upwards of 40 or more teams, it will be likely that no team will meet another 
team more than once, which makes it quite a bit more difficult to organize 
any effective game throwing tactics that would help a team. I mention also that 
in no event will any two teammates be on the same board.

<p>
While we are still learning as we go along, there are two principles that I 
often turn to when trying to decide whether such and such a format, or rule or 
such will add to the enjoyment of this tournament. First, I am always aware 
that like any free market, people will vote with their feet. Second, one must 
always consider carefully what one might add or subtract from a Diplomacy 
game, because in Diplomacy, unlike no other game I know of, everything counts.

<p>
We're looking forward to a very big and very enjoyable tournament. Everyone is 
welcome.

<i>((Let's get our teams together.... here is another announcement, plus
the beginning of a long series of notes on last issue's editorial.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Richard Weiss (Tue, 29 Jun 1999 13:59:53 PDT)</b>

<p>
Jim:

<p>
1.  I would like to organize another TAP team for the CAT23 Tournament.  I 
would hope that Charles Jones would join me in the endeavor, and then 
whomever volunteers.  I think there are many good players with high energy 
levels in TAP who do not fit into the Arsenic and Old Farts category.  If 
someone else has responded as interested in organizing such a team, then 
fold me into that.  If there is enough interest for two or three additional 
<i>TAP</i> teams, great, let me be part of the fun!
	
<p>
As a bit of a promo, my ``election speech" would be:  I have lots of energy 
for this.  I have lots of experience in Dip, pubbing, playing over 100 
games, being formerly highly ranked in FTF with a ``Top Board" finish in a 
DipCon, etc.
	
<p>
Thank you for publicizing the tournament.  Information is powerful.

<p>
2.  The first point segues so totally into this point.  I agree with each 
and every point you make about the Hobby Awards.  The time has truly come to 
recognize ``The Hobby" is not a small group of North Americans in Snail Mail. 
  
<p>
Appreciation for the game of ``Diplomacy" is at an all-time high and going 
higher.  Either the Hobby Awards Committee will become ever more insular and 
represent less and less until it signifies nothing, or it can attempt to 
represent more and more, joining forces with others throughout the world and 
however the game is played.
   
<p>
I speak from the experience of having been a long-time member of the 
Hobby Awards Committee who resigned only a short while ago, when I folded my 
zine (ok, for you, ``szine.") and felt that since I was neither playing as 
much nor trading with everyone, that I was unable to be informed enough to 
be on the committee.  Maybe I should have stayed a member, since the 
committee is basically unchanged.
   
<p>
With the demise of the PDORA auction, there is no funding for plaques.  
Good.  I will vote this year, but not send a contribution.  However, I offer 
to contribute $100 to the formation of an expanded committee along the lines 
you suggest Jim, with true international representation and representation 
from the three methods to play of the Hobby (snail, e, FTF).  This money can 
be used to either organize the committee or to award appropriate 
commemoratives (i.e., plaques).
	
<p>
Further, I hope that you, Jim, will either be the Chair or the ex-officio 
chair of the new Committee.
	
<p>
Melinda, I applaud your honesty in asking the questions Jim has broadcast 
through his greater readership.  It's been a long time since I played in 
your 7 X 7 tournaments - jewels each and every one!
	
<p>
Gary, it's been a long time since I asked you to be the Ombudsman to settle 
a question, and even then you were not an active player as far as most of us 
could figure out.
	
<p>
Fred, there sure are a lot of zines dropping out, as you mentioned.
	
<p>
Paul, I see your name the most as actively participating.  Hope all is well.
	
<p>
Robert, I do not know you personally.
	
<p>
Committee, I hope that you each accept the reorganization of the Committee 
along the lines Jim has suggested, work to create a greater force and 
purpose for the game we love and recognize that there may be little true 
appreciation from those who you will benefit, but that your acts will meet 
the ``rocking chair" criteria which motivates many of our behaviors in life.  
The ``rocking chair" criteria being that when we are old enough to be 
retired/sitting on our porches, rocking in our rocking chairs, watching the 
gathering twilight, we will smile, knowing that our earlier actions 
contributed to a slight improvement in the world.

<p>

<center>Sincerely, Richard Weiss, a former member of the 
Hobby Awards Committee, rcw23 of hotmail.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Right, Will (as in Rogers....).
Boy, ***GREAT*** letter.  I had forgotten that you were a previous
member of the Committee.  It is good to get that kind of comment
from you.  People keep telling me that no one is writing ``Walker award"
material any more, but they clearly don't ``get out much".  I got a
comment from someone else that said that perhaps the Committee just
didn't do a good enough job at the ``nomination" solicitation
stage.  This is a good idea too.
What else do you have to say....))</i>

<p>
Jim: The Hobby Awards Committee (how pretentious) used to do a very good job 
soliciting nominations for each category, especially the writing.  When I 
was a member, I always wanted to include other forums for the writing, but 
was denied.  So, this, and the merger into the rest of the Hobby and the 
rest of the modes of play has been something I've been pushing for a long 
time.  Remember my nominating you for the grandest Award of all based upon 
your connections to the snail, the world snail and the e-hobbies?  If it 
weren't for you, I think the ``Hobby" would either be dead now or so insular 
that being dead would be a synonym.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Gary Behnen (05 Jul 1999 22:21:55 GMT)</b>

<p>
To the Greater Diplomacy Hobby:
I speak here as a resigning committee member and for myself, but believe my
thoughts mirror my peers and friends from my ``old fart" postal hobby. 

<p>
The only reason that YOU are not represented here is because YOU and NO ONE
ELSE nominated you. It is a gross misunderstanding on your part if you believe
that somehow you have by design not been included! The general APATHY that our
requests for hobby involvement received led Melinda and the committee to
seriously question the need to continue the awards and more importantly, did
anyone care? Are we ``postal centric?" Yes, I think it is obvious, but that is
because no one who crosses over and that means you, too, Jim, has ever come
forward to my knowledge requesting to be on the committee or heaven forbid
willing to give ANY time to it! If reading between the backhanded compliments
and the criticisms there is an offer to be a committee member, I'm positive Ms.
Holley will welcome you with open arms.

<p>
 Alas, my ``retirement" is NOT exaggerated. I held on here merely to help in any
meager way I could because no one was willing to take the time to join the
committee. I am leaving after this last vote, my love of this hobby
notwithstanding. If you are not aware, the committee simply culls the top 5
nominations for each award. They can not vote in a category that they are
nominated in. Unfortunately, apathy has been SO insidious, I don't believe
we've had to vote on very many categories the past 2-3 years. So, as a proud
``Golden Ager" harkening back over 27 years of play and service to 1972, I
challenge you to get up off your computer and flood Ms. Holley at
Rebel8954 of aol.com and let her know how much you want to do for YOUR hobby. Oh,
and as this old troll has learned, FLAME AWAY......;-) 

<p>

<center>Best, Gary Behnen (Just a guy who loves to play the game.),
emuchiefs of aol.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Hi Gary!
I have ``gently" commented on my feelings that the hobby awards needed
to incorporate the E-Mail world in the past.  This year I don't even
recall seeing a request for nominations.  Perhaps I received one,
but I don't remember it.  All I got was the list out of the blue,
with many typographical errors, and a request for comments.  I 
``nominally" am still a part of the PDORA committee and thus felt
that I was ineligible for actually volunteering to participate on
the Awards Committee (at least that's how I read it).  I had been
waiting for Doug Kent to revive some other important things by
passing them on (i.e. Diplomacy World) before asking about the
status of the PDORA treasury.  Then if I do something in this area,
I am more inclined to work at reviving PDORA so we can do some
publicity the way that the British hobby currently is doing.))

<p>
((I welcome your comments and I tried to emphasize that I didn't 
see your role as a problem in itself, only in conjunction with a 
Committee that appeared to be too small.  
If you had five people who were really, really
active in the hobby, that would be fine.  If others are to be there
(and I think it is important for the experience and continuity)
then I think the Committee needs to be bigger.  That's all.))

<p>
((Thanks for responding.  I think this discussion needs to take place.
My szine will feature at least a dozen other comments (some who agree
with me and some who don't) in my next issue.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Thu, 01 Jul 1999 14:18:21 GMT)</b>

<p>
I basically agree with everything said above.  For a long time
I've felt that the ``Hobby Awards" had no interest in email Diplomacy.
In spite of the fantastic performances in email Diplomacy by people
such as Dan Shoham, Jamie Dreier, and Conrad Minshall, I've never
seen any of these people even considered for a hobby award.

<p>
Considering the possibility that the interest in this game will grow
greatly based upon Hasbro's marketing skills, it would be nice to
get things like the Hobby Awards to be modernized.  Email Dip is here
to stay (well, at least until we all start playing Dip in the Matrix.)
This doesn't mean ``postal is dead" or anything like that.  But
it would be nice if the different communities in Diplomacy interacted
a bit more with each other.  We've made progress along these lines,
getting some email players to subscribe to postal 'zines, while getting
some ``Old Farts" to play (godforbid!) Judge games.  We've also
gotten emailers of the Judge and non-Judge types to start testing
their mettle at major FTF cons.  These are all Good Things(tm).

<p>
In conclusion, I encourage everybody to vote for the Hobby Awards
and include some comments as you feel appropriate.

<p>
Also, while you're at it, drop in an All-Star ballot where you don't
check off any Cleveland Indians.  (Omar Vizquel ahead of Nomar and
A-Rod?  Have these people no shame?)

the game for various reasons (Roger Clemens, Mo Vaughn, and Jose Canseco)
and thus the game [going on as I type this - five K's for Pedro!!]
was a Win, Win, Win for the Red Sox brass....))</i>

Jim, After having read the messages posted, I'd like to encourage everyone not 
only to vote but to forward their criticism/suggestions.  However, I'd like 
to point out in echoing Gary Behnen that like any other group, the Hobby 
Awards Committee and the Hobby Awards exists ONLY with the support of the 
Hobby (postal, electronic, etc.).  Therefore, I STRONGLY urge members of the 
electronic diplomacy to become involved.  In other words, put up your hands, 
contact us, and get involved.  For the individual who wanted the Awards to be 
modernized, get on board!  If you're ignored, get involved.  I truly believe 
that members of the electronic hobby also get some postal zines, etc.  I 
don't think you guys exist in a vacuum, right?  The electronic hobby has a 
representative on the Committee.  Use him &amp; join him.  Thanks for your 
support.

<p>
Jim,
Yes, requests did go out but as has been the trend, response was very 
poor. The committee was about twice this large, but Melinda cut dead weight 
this past year if the members didn't bother to respond in a timely fashion. A 
move I wholeheartedly agreed with, but one which left us woefully short in 
members. Now is the perfect time and you are a perfect candidate to help 
bridge the various segments of the hobby. This is one vehicle to do it with 
and one that I feel is worth the effort.

<p>
Anyway, I peruse the zine from time to time when I go to check 
baseball rosters, etc., and I still get the occasional stray issue or so. I'm 
glad to hear <i>DW</i> will be coming back, I think I have a number of issues left. 
Do you know if the BN still produces <i>E</i>? I had a sub until like 2005, but 
haven't received anything in quite awhile. 
<i>((I think that Conrad von Metzke has been pretty quiet about this.
Any plans, Conrad??))</i>

Lastly, my annual homage to my gaming past is coming the weekend of 
7/16 in Marshall, MO... POOLCON! I'll say hi to Vince and Mel and the assorted 
MadLads (Peters, Rusnak, Johnston, Becker et al) and Mr. Bergmann for you!!! 
	
<p>
Drop me a note from time to time and let me know what is going on. If 
I can help in some way, let me know! Hey, how can I be sure of not missing

I guess it's true that SOME judge players, and other PBEM players, also
get postal zines. I'm one of those people. But most judge players (I'm
pretty sure) do not. I think that many people may start out on the
judges and then later branch out into other modes. So I think many
people DO exist ``in a vacuum" by your definition. Of course, they may
not realize or care that they're in a vacuum  ;-)

<p>
You say the electronic hobby has a representative on the committee. I
don't know who it is. And I don't think I've ever seen anything posted
to r.g.d. before. If Jim Burgess hadn't posted his original message, I
think a lot of people would have never even seen the nominations. And
now there's a call to ``get involved", but it's hard to get involved in
something you don't even know about!

<p>
As for me, I'm certainly willing to think about this as something I'd
like to be a part of in the future. But right now my plate's pretty
full.

<p>
Gary, This is the first time I've ever seen a notice about this posted to
r.g.d. Seems that recruitment of PBEM players isn't exactly a top
priority, and then when we finally do get some sort of an attempt, it's
a bitter sounding ``challenge" rather than a polite request.
Oh well, whatever. Maybe someone will take up the challenge.

Chris,
Thank you for your thoughts. Embittered, no, but a little frustrated
with some of the criticism. I guess I see it as incumbent on those of you who
are in the pbem hobby that crossover to pbm and ftf to help bridge the gap
between those traditional hobby ``services" and the apparently ever expanding
Diplomacy Hobby at large. I believe Manus was a committee member at one time,
but unfortunately as has been pointed out, your segment doesn't feel
represented.

<p>
Let me join Jim and Melinda in exhorting your pbem community to reach out to
the ``old" segments of our hobby. I think you will find most will welcome your
enthusiasm and involvement. It was a goal discussed in seminars at past Dipcons
in the early '90s. I'd like nothing better than to see it come to fruition now.
Better late than never!!!

<p>
Jim - Read your comments on expanding the scope of
our hobby in <i>TAP</i> #220. Very interesting thoughts.
I kind of agree with you, kind of don't agree
with you.
   
<p>
Let me address this from a different tack. As
the new <i>Zine Register</i> editor and publisher, I
need to decide what place, if any, non-North
American zines and e-mail zines have in it.
   
<p>
I have been wrestling with this a little and
haven't come to a definite conclusion, but I am
leaning toward doing something much like Michael
Lowrey did: Focusing on North American zines,
with some mention of non-North American zines.
What the latter will look like, I haven't
decided.
   
<p>
Traditional writeups on a handful of foreign
zines like Michael did? Maybe so, or even less
than that (i.e., just the basic facts). I'm only
getting one non-NA zine now (Berry Renken's
<i>Bluesmobile</i>, via e-mail). 
<i>((And it ONLY is distributed via E-Mail and
has mostly US subbers, as I've mentioned.
Berry is precisely one part of a ``new way''
that must be nurtured and supported, in my view.))</i>
Clearly, the only way I
could include such zines in the <i>ZR</i> would be if I
receive them or someone else tells me about them.
<i>((Of course, in any case, no one is forcing you
to make your volunteer job really hard or impossible,
least of all me.))</i>

<p>
I think, though,  that successfully broadening
the <i>ZR</i>'s scope to be extremely
international-friendly would make it both
unwieldy and more expensive.
Just focusing on North American zines is
something I can get a good grip on. It's easier
to get ahold of them and more people see them (in
case I need information about the status of a
zine I don't receive). They are of the greatest
interest for North American hobbyists, who are
the ones most likely to want the <i>ZR</i>.
   
<p>
As for e-mail only NA zines, I think they
deserve attention. But we need to consider ``What
is a zine?" and ``What qualifies a zine as being
part of our hobby?"
<i>((The Brits [for a variety of reasons] are
discussing this continually, but in North America,
we seldom have done so.
What you say below has even more examples in that country.))</i>
Forget e-mail for the moment - how about a
recognized zine that does not run Diplomacy of
any sort? This originally was the postal
DIPLOMACY hobby, right?
So, for example, does Eric Brosius' <i>ark</i>, which
runs only railroad games, merit listing in the
ZR? Is it by virtue of previous things he might
have done as a Diplomacy player or GM? What about
Chris Hassler's <i>S.O.B.</i>? He doesn't run anything
Diplomacy (unless you count Machiavelli, which is
an unofficial Diplomacy variant to me), but you
will find a lot of Dip players (including me)
playing various Avalon Hill and other games in
his zine.
   
<p>
Re: the Judge games you mention: Are these
individual games at different sites, or are these
really zines (a term which suggests more than the
separate dispensing of different game results)?
Obviously, I am not very familiar with the Judge
games. If they aren't what I would call zines, I
can't see including them in the <i>ZR</i>.
<i>((I would agree with that point of view.
There are ``clubs'' of players within the Judge
community and outside of it that have a lot of 
the characteristics of a szine, but they really
are clubs, not szines.
The ``by hand'' GMs in that crowd should be eligible
for the GM award, most of them GM far more games 
than any of us do; and the players should be eligible
for the playing award.))</i>

<p>
Finally, re: Hobby Awards: For the 1999
nominees, with as many zines as I play in, I've
played for (this past year) only one of the GMs
listed and have played against (this past year)
only one of the players listed. You want to make
things worse for me by including a bunch of
e-mail only or international players whom I have
next to no chance of knowing?
<i>((In a word, yes.))</i>   

<p>
In conclusion, my gut feeling is that,
although we should recognize in some way the
efforts of non-North American zines and e-mail
only zines, we North Americans hobbyists should
focus the greater part of our attention and
effort on North American
Diplomacy(-related)zines. Maybe I'm being too
much of an isolationist, though. I'm not 100%
sure. I'm hoping for some feedback on the points
I've raised here.

<p>
As a former member of the Hobby Awards committee myself (Melinda:
I believe I *am* former, not current, yes? I haven't received
anything in a while, I don't think), I thought I'd poke my head in
here with a little bit of my hazy memory.

<p>
There was a discussion among the committee members a couple years
back which raised these very questions - shouldn't the awards be
expanded from the Postal community?  The results of that discussion
were concrete, though I betcha I'll misremember them.

<p>
I believe it was decided that CERTAIN of the awards (such as
literature, etc.) would be open to e-zines in addition to postal
zines.  Others, such as best GM, were deemed Postal-specific, with
responsibility for creating any PBEM-equivalent left for other
parties.  The Don Miller Award is open to all forums - FTF, PBM,
PBEM.  That's my memory.

<p>
The problem is that to receive an award, one must be nominated.
And PBM has had a monopoly on the nominations, most recently due
to the simple fact that the nomination process is not publicized
among the PBEM community the way it is in the PBM 'zines.  I stand
as guilty as anyone on this count.

<p>
I have raised the possibility more than once of creating a set
of PBEM Diplomacy awards to supplement the current Hobby Awards.
This proposition didn't receive enough response.  I won't use
the word apathy - oops, just did, so I better end this sentence.

<p>
Perhaps the mood has changed, and with Hasbro now behind the game
and with the promise of a great many new players learning about
us by the end of the current calendar year, perhaps now is the time
that organizational efforts can progress.

<p>
Could I just make the point that the Hobby Awards we are talking about
are for North America - though I have had a few nominations over the
years for bits I published in <i>Diplomacy World</i> - we should be trying to
bring in not just PBEM but also the Diplomacy hobby outside North
America as well!

feud, but I think the world is different now.  
I agree with you.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><b>Stephen Agar (Wed, 7 Jul 1999 23:16:26)</b>

<p>
Err, 1974 (from memory). The problem was that the IDA Awards could be
voted for by members in America and the UK - however, the latter
organised themselves so that despite being about one fifth of the size
of the US membership, UK nominees won 8 out of the 10 categories
(because few Americans bothered to vote). All the IDA did was to change
the rules to exclude people outside US and Canada voting so it couldn't
happen again - not a good advert for having an international hobby!

<p>
Although PBM Dip is in decline in the UK, I'd guess our hobby is at
least twice the size of the US hobby now - partly because we have a
better postal service and partly because Internet penetration is less.
<i>((Yeah, as I keep saying, I get better service to and from the UK
on the post than between here and California.))</i>

<p>
Rather than perpetrate awards all named after heroes of the North
American Dip scene (Miller, Walker, Hyatt etc.) I would rather we had
global award without the baggage - or failing that (and a poor second
best in my opinion), name a few awards after people from our hobby as
well - in the UK there is at least two awards named after sadly deceased
hobby figures (Kendrick and Pimley - the latter award having been going
for 23 years).

<p>
I'd say we are a new community now - let's create our own sense of
identity from scratch, that could be relevant for everyone.

Out of the ashes...I think your idea has merit! Why not make this

this time, I can't imagine anyone would be too upset if active committee

the hobby! No use in re-inventing the wheel, just drop Melinda an e-mail.

Jim,
interesting comments re. the hobby awards. I used to be on the committee
but a couple of years ago felt that I was very close to departing the hobby. I
liked the fact that I was on the committee because it gave me the chance to
`promote' Canadian players/content that I felt didn't get the larger
exposure. Before stepping down I recommended that another Canadian take my
place (there was another reason, as a committee member I could never vote
for myself as `best' player. So why wasn't I nominated this year?).
<i>((Gee, I don't know, Bob.
It is an unfathomable mystery to me!!))</i>        

<p>
I suspect that a couple of the existing names are there because no one
else wanted to.  If there is a present interest in getting on the awards
committee maybe your article will bring it to the forefront.
With my ballot this year I suggested that these awards run every second
year instead of annually.

I agree these need to go all-medium. I'm now playing more games in zines

<p>
Hi Jim,
I read your comments in <i>TAP</i> issue 220 on the awards committee.  
While I want to thank you for your kind comments being on the 
awards committee, it is really Melinda and Fred doing the lion's share 
of the work.  I myself have
mixed feelings about the awards.  I'm concerned that some of the categories
could be self defeating, promoting one to put all their energy into writing
rather than into enjoying a GAME.  Same goes for worrying about their win
loss record.  If it means so much, why don't we have Money games, with a pot
of $100 per person.  Every player puts up $100. If there is a sole winner,
they get $700.  
<i>((Money games like this have been done as experiments.
My recollection is that they weren't as ``different'' or ``special'' as
everyone expected them to be, but someone should please refresh my memory.))</i>
You could adjust this so that the GM gets like $20 per
player for starting this game, or $140.  If there is a tie with two players,
they each get $280, three would get $186 each, etc. (Of course, the GM gets
to keep all fractions of a dollar!)

<p>
And are people who vote just voting for their friends?  These votes tend to
be an excluding clique, where new people find it very difficult to break
into the inside crowd.  Then again, not everyone gets to see the articles in
question, so how do you get to make a judgement on who played the best, who
GMed the best, who wrote the best.  I think the one thing that most of the
hobby has a chance to witness is the Miller award for meritorious service.

<p>
I looked at the Hyatt Award.  I have already voted, and when it came to that
category, I had to write ``No choice."  I don't get any of the zines listed
that those people put out.  I have never seen most of them.  I played in
<i>Cheesecake</i> before and I know that one has a very good rep, but I haven't
seen anything in the last 9 years.  I do get some zines, but not those.

<p>
I think it would help if Conrad von Metzke and Lee Kendter got around to
releasing some simple stats on how players did during the year.  But they
both probably feel compelled to take do all kind of weird statistician
things like figuring the mean of how many supply center each power had on
each turn and which power won how many times - all which is the reason that
I haven't seen a <i>Everything,</i> the stats zine for regular Diplomacy nor
<i>Alpha and Omega</i> the stats zine for variant diplomacy games in well over
five years, maybe even longer.  Who really knows how successful all of the
players named in the best player category were, especially compared to each
other?

<p>
But the one suggestion you had for merging the postal hobby with the e-mail
hobby, I didn't like.  I think there is a place for both, a postal hobby and
a e-mail hobby.  I simply do not have the time to do the e-mail hobby, it
runs way to fast for me.  I would much prefer the slower pace of the snail
mail.  Nor do I want to merge it with any hobby over seas.  I think this
would be a non issue with the e-mail crowd, but the postal hobby it would be
a big pain.  Lately, the U.S. postal service has been very challenged to
deliver ordinary domestic mail.  They are much too busy giving postal rate
discounts to the bulk junk mail customers to be concerned with delivering
ordinary mail. 

<p>
Jim, your zine has done very well in using the Internet.  You load your zine
on the Internet.  But you are the only zine to do so.  
<i>((On that you are very, very wrong and this is moving as it really
is trivial to load ANY szine onto the Internet (by scanning it if nothing else).))</i>
Of my players in my
zine, I have somewhere between 15% and 25% still using U.S. mail, with a few
who you know are going to be solely using U.S. mail with no other methods
available.  I think I have been on the Diplomatic Pouch to check it out.
The Diplomatic Pouch is a e-zine on the Internet.  I checked out the postal
section and my link is the only one that still works with a postal zine web
site (and an e-mail link).

<p>
I think that if you tried to merge the two hobbies, the e-mail hobby would
squeeze out the postal hobby.  The e-mail hobby has a faster pace that would
swamp the slower postal hobby.  But I think the postal hobby is in a low
point right now.  For the postal hobby, things will pick up when Hasbro gets
around to re-releasing Diplomacy again.  When Diplomacy hits stores like
TOYS-R-US and what have you, people will stumble into the game and it will
start to bring in new blood.
<i>((The only way I see what
you say as making any sense is if no one shares our preferences for
reading paper and slower games and that simply is NOT the case.
Hasbro is going to be STRONGLY pushing the game as a computer/E-Mail
game.
Read more on that below....))</i>

<p>
I simply don't think merging awards for Pbm and Pbem will help the pbm hobby
at all.  It's like playing Rap music on a boom box next to a similar boom
box playing some classical flute music, (an guess which I might be inclined
to listen to).
<i>((So, I completely disagree with your conclusions and think you will see
an added level to this continuum when Hasbro gets its real time web
site games going.  You will be able to sit down whenever you like and
join a game with other players from around the world for the next
three to eight hours.))</i>

<p>
I think the Hasbro web site will be cool, but as something different.
OK, so we have agreed to disagree.  But I really believe that there should
be separate hobby awards got PBM and PBeM.  The internet doesn't do a very
good job at promoting the PBM hobby now, just giving it minor lip service,
while you have done a wonderful job at bringing the e-mail side of the hobby
to the postal side.  I believe if you merge the awards, it will become an
all e-mail thing anyway.

<p><br><p><br><b>Fred C. Davis, Jr. (July 6, 1999)</b>

<p>
Dear Jim: Thank you for your comments and suggestions about the Hobby Awards
procedures and voting for 1999.
I agree with you that there has been an insufficient inclusion of those 
``Diplomats'' whose participation has been mainly via the electronic games
and e-zines.
However, I wish to point out that one of the reasons for this has been
because, in the past, there apparently has been little response to 
``traditional'' hobby activities by those whose sole interests were in the
electronic side.
<i>((As someone who has been right in the middle of this for a decade or
more now, I would assert that the world is ``changing'' as the electronic
hobby matures.))</i>

<p>
Some of the e-mail players were reportedly only interested in their games,
with no interest in writing press or in participating in other hobby activities,
which many of we old timers felt was just as important as the game itself.
In fact, I went so far in some of my writings as to say that the game
of Diplomacy was only an excuse on which to hang our hats, as we made friends
and socialized in the Postal hobby.
<i>((No question, those last two statements are absolutely true and I am
right by your side in what ***I*** am doing here... what is beginning to 
change is that there is a huge growing interest in more competitive play
of the game (both in FTF and E-Mail tournaments) and this is taking place
on a world wide basis.
As Hasbro starts marketing around the world, this will explode even more.
And, while SOME e-mail players are only interested in playing games, there
is a large and growing cadre of ``others'' who have a broader interest.
Now is the time to start building on that.))</i>

<p>
I also agree that the Awards Committee ought to be expanded, to include
participants from the electronic side.
The problem is how do we go about recruiting them?
<i>((I think it is obvious that you must go where they are to recruit them.
Stephen Agar has made his szine into primarily an E-Mail szine.  
He picked up 100 subbers (without trying that hard) in just a week.
It will be increasingly difficult to operate in szinedom without being
E-Mail connected.
Offhand, I can't think of anyone who is attempting it.
And MOST of the postal szines now have some sort of Web or E-Mail presence.
That's where you recruit people.
I can't imagine trying to run the Walker Award in the future 
without putting the nominees on a Hobby Awards Web Page, 
so everyone as equal access to all of them.
I could go on....))</i>

<p>
I disagree with your suggestion that the North American Hobby Awards be extended
to a world-wide jurisdiction.
There are <i>separate</i> Award programs in operation in the U.K. and in Europe,
and we should not be stepping on their toes.
Overseas players <i>are</i> invited to vote in our Awards program if they wish.
Ballots are sent out to some of them, and I believe there have always been a few
Overseas voters over the years.
<i>((Eventually, it is crystal clear to me, there will be no essential difference
between regional hobbies and everyone will cross over freely.
Already, the UK post is better than twice as fast at delivering my szine
than the USPS is to California (2-3 days vs. 5-7 days), though admittedly
the cost advantage is still to the USPS.
I might concede that day is not here yet, but it is coming VERY fast.
Hasbro will accelerate this trend with their worldwide uniform marketing efforts.))</i>

<p>
The first step ought to be to rebuild the strength of the Awards Committee.
When the Awards began, we tried to have at least one member in each of the
four Zones into which the DipCons were held, plus insuring that at least one
committee member was from Canada.
There was never any set maximum size, but the Commitee has often had about 
7 members.
There has been a preponderance of members from the Mid-Atlantic area and from
California, because those were the two areas which had the most Diplomacy 
players, as shown in the various Censuses over the years.
In 1999, there are only five members, consisting of two from the Mid-Atlantic
(Davis and Kenny), one from the Central (Behnen), one from the Midwest (Holley)
and one Canadian (Lesco).
We are sorely in need of at least one member from the Far West, one from the
South, and one from somewhere in the Chicago-Milwaukee-Detroit area, which 
always used to be a center of Dip activity.
Of course, we'd be glad to get new members from wherever we can find them!

<p>
The second step would be to try to include some of the e-mail zines, and
electronic game GM's and players, on the Committee.
I'll defer to others on what methods can be used to achieve this.
I, myself, do not have e-mail service.
But, I still receive about 16 print zines regularly, so I'd like to 
remain on the Committee.
What I miss the most is the lack of the <i>Diplomacy World</i> ``flagship''
zine, which more or less brought all of us together.
(The best articles were always in <i>D.W.</i>).
<i>((I, too, look forward to the <b>DW</b> revival, which should occur shortly.
I think we agree on far more than you might think....))</i>

<p>
<i><b>I strongly urge Jim Burgess to become a member of the Hobby Awards
Committee</b></i>, since he has excellent knowledge of the electronic part of the 
hobby.
He can also suggest other possible members who could be invited to join
the Committee.
<i>((As I say elsewhere, I was hoping to lead a revival of PDORA, which
historically has precluded being part of the Awards Committee.
I'll listen to input and certainly see your point.
In any case, I can guide good people toward the Committee.))</i>

<p>
Another problem we have is the disappearance of the Runestone Zine Poll,
which gave us some idea of the status and quality of the various 
Dipzines.
It's difficult to know the rankings of the various zines without that 
information.
I'm sure some of the newer zines and GM's have been overlooked without
that information.
Again, some people with familiarity with the electronic side of the hobby
can help us to include these people.
<i>((As you probably know, I actually am pleased to see that this Poll
has disappeared.
The <b>Zine Register</b> performs a large chunk of what you are talking about
and is much more effective at promoting szines, rather than building up
a small cadre and tearing others down.
I think Phil Reynolds will be attacking this project with GREAT energy.))</i>

<p>
I hope that Melinda Holley will stay on as Chairperson, and will be willing
to coordinate these needed changes.
<i>((Until just now, I hadn't realized that Melinda could use E-Mail too!
I agree enthusiastically.))</i>
I know that one of the five current committeemen has announced that this is
his last year to serve on the Committee, so the need to infuse ``new blood''
is rather urgent.
I will stay on as long as I'm needed, and will do what I can.
If there is a feeling that everyone on the Committee MUST be on line, then
I'll gracefully retire.
<i>((I don't see any reason for that....))</i>
Until that time comes, I'll be glad to go on serving as Treasurer, and as
the unofficial Historian of the Awards Committee.
<i>((Thus, I am sending you the $50 check described just two letters
down below that stems from Glenn Petroski tracking down John Michalski.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><b>Peter Sullivan (Tue, 29 Jun 1999 08:06:16)</b>

<p>
The main reason that the membership of the Awards committee is an issue
is that they provide the nominations. I'm not sure whether this is de
jure (i.e. the rules state that the committee should select the
nominees) or just de facto (i.e. the rules say that anyone can nominate,
with the committee just weeding out obvious ``joke" nominations. However,
in practice, only committee members actually submit nominations). If the
first, then I would suggest switching to the second immediately. If the
second, then the nominations process needs to be opened up and better
publicised. This is something that the committee cannot do by themselves
- it is up to editors to spread the word as well.

<p>
I would suggest switching to one of two possible scenarios :

<p>
1) Have a two stage process. Firstly, call for nominations, trying to
ensure that it gets publicised in as many places as possible. Ideally
you want a 2-3 month lead time for this. The committee weeds out any
sillies, then you have a 2-3 month voting phase (as currently).

<p>
2) Have no nominations at all, and make it a completely open ballot.

<p>
It is possible that a mix of these might be appropriate - I am not sure
I would prefer 2) for the Miller Award, for instance, but I would have
no objection to it for the Player Award.

<p>
Finally, for the Walker Award, it used to be possible to get copies of
the articles from the Awards committee. I see no formal mention of this
this year, although I am sure they would help if asked. But how about
getting the text of the articles up on a web site somewhere? (There may
have been a copyright problem in previous years when we had articles
from <i>The General</i> etc, but not these days I would hope.)
<i>((This needs to be on a Web Page somewhere.
I think I can safely suggest that Manus Hand would allow this to be on the
<b>Diplomatic Pouch</b>.
And if there were any copyright problems, there probably could be a link
to the original location.
Scanners could be used, at worst, for purely postal articles.))</i>

<p>
WORLD WIDE HOBBY - 
Hobby history warning: The Calhamer Awards ``scandal" from the mid-
1970s.
<i>((Since I wasn't really around then [I was, but not involved
in this] I don't know the details, but surely I don't want to raise
any problems.))</i>

<p>
They don't call it ``Information Technology" for nothing. Information
technology, like any technology, is neutral. It's how you use it that
matters. Computers can, if we want, kill the hobby, because all the
potential audience for mutli-player strategy games are off playing Tomb
Raider or Quake instead (``Imminent Death of the Hobby predicted, Film at
11"). However, the ease of communication, both one-to-one and one-to-
many, is the best tool the Hobby has ever had to grow and expand.

<p>
When I was 17, <i>it was a very good year</i> I had to type on
an old IBM golfball typewriter, including all the letters and press that
had already been typed up by the players. This went onto a mimeo wax
stencil, and then had to be printed, collated, enveloped and posted. By
contrast, putting the latest version of the Octopus on my web page takes
about 2 minutes. This allows people like me to have a minimal but still
worthwhile hobby presence, without either burning out completely or
having to find time to do it the old fashioned way.

<p>
<i>((I said: I claim the prize myself for finding Bernie Oaklyn Tretick.))</i>
Ah yes, but first of all you've got to:
``Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who `found' him.''

<p>
<i>((I have done this, see above.
Once I found Jim and Bernie, I was sure I could get them to write.
Apparently, some other people sent Bernie letters.
Anyone want to own up to doing that??
But you didn't convince Bernie to move into action.
Remember that I am more than willing to send sample issues to people
at your request (that still keeps you in line for the prize).
Anyway, I gotta get these ``The Hobby Is Dead" people out of their
funk.))</i>

dead. It just smells that way."

<center><b>Hasbro Interactive - Avalon Hill Diplomacy software -
Focus Group status report</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>As many of you know from postings to r.g.d., Hasbro recently began a focus
group study of its AH Diplomacy software program.  I was fortunate enough
to be selected to participate.  While the software is still under
development and all participants were asked to maintain confidentiality
with regard to the software and the focus group process, I thought that the
members of the hobby community might appreciate some information as to the
current status of the program.  I ran the idea by Bill Levay, the Project
Leader, and he concurred.  Given the reasonable security and development
concerns that Hasbro might have, I offered to let Bill vet this message
before posting but he demurred.  He asked only that I not discuss specifics
of the focus group discussion, in order to protect the privacy and
confidentiality of that process and the participants.  The contents of this
message are my own and represent only my personal opinions and
observations.  Moreover, I think it is important to point out that this is
a product still very much under development.  At best, my comments should
be viewed as a preview of the work in progress rather than a review of the
final product.

<p>
The game provides a number of playing options:

<p>
 - single player vs. AI

<p>
 - multi-player ``hot-seat" using one PC

<p>
 - multi-player via the Internet (The Gaming Zone)

<p>
 - multi-player via the Internet (direct IP connection)

<p>
 - 2-player direct connect via modem

<p>
Multi-player games can be up to 7 players.  Hasbro's plan to use The Gaming
Zone is intended to give players a single ``gathering point" to find other
players.  The direct IP connection allows players to bypass the Zone,
however, if desired.  The ``hot seat" feature, allows players to use the
game in lieu of a board for F2F games.

<p>
<p>
<center>Maps</center><br>

<p>
4 different styles of maps are available.  I'm not very good at describing
this sort of thing but I think that it's safe to say that they are distinct
enough that just about everyone will find one that suits them.  One neat
feature associated with each map is an ``overlay" option for displaying
which power owns which provinces.  When selected, the overlay option shades
each province with the color of the controlling power.  This will be
particularly useful for newbies.

<p>
<p>
<center>Negotiation</center><br>

<p>
Negotiation occurs in a couple of ways.  First, with the AI, you negotiate
by clicking on icons which indicate what you want the AI to do, e.g. ALLY
with me, ATTACK PARIS, etc.  The AI considers your request/offer and tells
you what it will do.  It also makes similar requests/offers to you.
Second, with another human player, you negotiate in a chat room fashion.
There is one public room where all players can see and hear what is said
and multiple private rooms where you can go to speak privately to one or
more players.  While in the private rooms, you can still hear what's being
said in the public room (sort of like keeping an ear to the door).

<p>
<p>
<center>Order Entry</center><br>

<p>
Entering orders is easy and intuitive.  All of your units are displayed on
the map.  When you click on one a pop-up window displays the possible
orders.  When you click on an order, all legal provinces for that order are
highlighted (e.g. if you clicked on Army Wales, then clicked on Move,
Liverpool, London, and Yorkshire would be highlighted).  You click on the
province you want and the order is entered.  A text display at the bottom
of the screen lists all your units and is updated as you issue orders.
Orders for Convoys and Supports are slightly more complex but not much.

<p>
<p>
<center>Graphic &amp; Textual Order Resolution</center><br>

<p>
Once all orders are entered and the phase begins to process, a scrolling
text window displays the orders and resolution.  At the same time, the map
display shows a graphic representation of the orders and their resolution,
similar to the way units are moved during resolution in face-to-face games.
This will, I think, also be very helpful to newbies and it's enjoyable to
watch.

<p>
<p>
<center>Graphics and movies</center><br>

<p>
Though not part of game play, the period graphics, text, and tone, as well
as the introductory and intra-game video clips are very attractive.  They
add noticeably to the look and feel of the game.  Within the game, the main
screen displays diplomats from all powers who gesture, make faces, and,
generally, interact with the players and each other.  Not crucial to game
play but a nice touch.
<i>((I'm glad it doesn't sound like they have those wild exploding 
bomb graphics like Risk has to go along with attacks??
I hope, I hope, I hope.... at least they probably will be able to be
turned off.))</i>

<p>
<p>
<center>Editor</center><br>

<p>
A fully functional game editor is included.  With it, you can set up any
board situation you like, trying ``what-if" scenarios or setting up games
from other sources.  You can use the editor simply to move pieces around as
you would on a board or you can use it to set up a game in any manner you
like and then play it from that point.  A *very* useful feature and
indicative of the full-featured approach Hasbro is taking toward the game.

<p>
<p>
<center>Judge support</center><br>

<p>
Though not yet implemented, Hasbro has indicated that the final version
will work with the Internet judges.  That is, it will accept judge output,
allow you to display the game and enter moves, and then output orders.
It's not clear at the moment whether order output will be direct to email
or to a text file that you will cut and paste into your email to the judge.
FYI, Edi Birsan pushed very hard for this feature and was instrumental in
getting it included.  Kudos to Edi for pushing it and Bill for adding it.

<p>
<p>
<center>Variants</center><br>

<p>
The game will support a wide variety of ``unit/rules" variants which work on
the standard map, e.g. 1898.  This feature was not implemented during the
focus group test but the menu is already built-in and implementation is
assured for the final release.

<p>
<p>
<center>Tutorial</center><br>

<p>
As we all know, the best way to learn Diplomacy is to play with someone who
already knows how to play.  However, if this game is successful in the
marketplace, it will reach many players who will be experiencing Diplomacy
for the first time.  I think that is a very, very good thing, as it can
only help the hobby grow.  To that end, I volunteered to help write the
tutorial and I'm currently in the process of doing so.  I won't be doing
any coding, of course, but I'm hoping that the final result will be an
interactive introduction to game mechanics and strategy that will be simple
and complete.  If you have any suggestions or ideas along these lines,
please let me know.  I'll be glad to share my compensation with you (part
of nothing is still nothing... ;-)

<p>
Current plans call for an expected ship date of late 4th quarter '99.  The
general consensus in the focus group I attended (experienced Diplomacy
players) was generally quite positive.  We all recognized that the software
was still in development and understood that there were still bugs to be
worked out and features to be implemented.  Not all of the features above
worked all the time or always exactly as described.  Additionally, there
were a number of cosmetic interface issues which needed to be improved.  Of
course, the purpose of the focus group was to help Hasbro identify those
issues.  There are still some significant obstacles to overcome, developing
and improving the AI chief among them.  It's not surprising to me that this
task is still ongoing.  Frankly, I have doubts about *anyone's* ability to
code an AI that can play competitively against an experienced player.  To
me, Diplomacy does not seem to be the kind of game that lends itself to
that type of process.  I think Hasbro will do well simply to code an AI
that can play adequately against beginning level players, making reasonable
moves, not being too repetitive, and not making obvious mistakes.  They're
still working on that, however, and I know they're committed to the best
result possible.

<p>
There were requests for some additional features which I won't delineate
here because I'm not sure if Hasbro can (or wishes) to implement them prior
to the planned ship date.  Suffice it to say that I'm convinced that they
want the best for the game both as a revenue generating product *and* as a
tool to support and develop the hobby.  As planned right now, I see the
Diplomacy software as being designed to meet 3 basic needs.  One,
single-player play - mostly there but dependent on a functional AI.  Two,
true real-time multi-player play via the net - virtually done now, just
requiring some bug fixes and interface re-design.  Three, a judge front-end
- not yet implemented but under development and not likely to be very
difficult to achieve.

<p>
All in all, I'm impressed by the potential of what I've seen and, more
importantly, by the attitude with which Hasbro, particularly Bill Levay, is
approaching the project.  Here's hoping they continue in that fashion and
are able to realize the full potential of the product.

<p>
Hi Jim,
Not much to add to Pitt's message (and no time to do so (&lt;:).  In 
general I think that what Hasbro is coming out with will fill a 
new niche in the hobby.  It is an attempt to supply a way of playing
face to face over the internet and it is certainly a good effort
in this direction.  It also provides a means for playing solo, although
I doubt it will ever provide an interesting game for anyone except
a newcomer.  I see it complementing the judges and the postal hobby
rather than replacing either.  Hasbro's attitude is a very positive
one and I think this will only be good for the hobby.

<p>
<p>It is still time to send in your ``best of 1998'' lists.
Give it to me anyway you want to - a top 10, a couple of favorites,
a list, an essay, whatever - the classic is to tell me your top
singles, top albums, and best concerts of the year, but you are the
boss.
Don't wait too long though because I want to move into the party tape
issues pretty quickly.
I'm going to have to delay Part III of the lists with the large
outpouring of material for this issue.

<p>
<p><br>
<center>***TIME TO VOTE***</center><br>

<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
I'm going to set a slate of only 10 - that's just ONE more from
what is below and then DEMAND votes from you out there to
fill the rest of the slots.
The Bullpen voting system I am envisioning will work like this:
you each get ten votes which you can allocate across as few as
two songs (5 votes apiece) or as many as ten songs (1 vote for each).
You can allocate your ten votes any way you want, but you can't put
any more than five votes on any one song.
You also get ONE B-52 song vote (although you can add votes from your
main allotment if desired) and THREE Drug Song votes which will be
held in a separate category.
The other ``special'' bullpens must be voted on from your main allotment
of votes.
I decided that I WILL print running totals and print the names of the
people who have voted.
Also, you guys wrote some great stuff about the songs, so I've printed
that too!
Write-ins will be permitted, but are unlikely to win.
I know I have lost some suggestions that aren't in the bullpen lists
below, so feel free to mention 'em again!
Everything that started in the bullpen started with one vote.

<p>
To encourage voting early, five voters at random will receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff).
I will take these voters at random every other issue, starting with
this issue, and draw one randomly, so early voters get FIVE chances
to win, but no one will be allowed to win twice.
I'm also giving the round one voters below five chances in said drawing,
those in the second round four, and so on, to more heavily penalize the
chances of those last minute voters and reward these pioneers!
That should do it!!
Since this issue is monstrous, I am pushing back my voters to next 
issue and my prize awards likewise.
Prizes will be awarded in issues 222 and 224.
Get your Round 4 votes in now if you don't see your name below!!!
You each will receive two chances in the drawing for the next 
five dollar prize. 
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper ($5), Tony Dickinson,
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters are John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
In future drawings these people will
have five chances, just as the Round 1 voters.
Round 2 E-Mail voters get four chances and are Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
Round 3 voters are Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch;
they get three chances to win.
There are 60 chances up for grabs.... and
Rick Desper wins this issue's prize.
Since he is in Germany, he may find it useful.
Let me know if you want me to send any money to someone here in the US!!
I'll pay out all of the awards at the end, but if you need me to send
anyone money, just speak up.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!

First off, I second Rich Gooch's complaint of no Queen on your list ... how
could you?!?!  (As you know, I had a small zine named Flick of the Wrist, once
upon a decade.)  And no Thorogood or ZZTop either?!?  No Blondie?!?!?!  (Rip Her
to Shreds, Atomic, Heart of Glass, Call Me, and the almighty Rapture (arguably
the first rap/hip-hop song) ... do these mean nothing do you, O Heartless Wretch

of the beast and all that, but the bias is there all the same.  I danced both
rock and disco party music, Jimbo.  Well it is, after all, your list and you can
do as you want.  Confining (almost) myself to the choices allowed, I vote as
follows ...
<i>((Yeah, well this is pretty much of an impossible task....))</i>

<p>
Special B-52's Vote: Love Shack (The video's overplayed?  Don't watch -

(5) Play That Funky Music/Wild Cherry*

<p>
* I demand, as ... well, I demand, an extra five votes for this song to make
up for the fact that you didn't list it in the first place.  You
seem pretty fast and loose (read: manipulative) with the vote allocations
anyway, so I may as well get in on the action.
<i>((I'll give you one extra, just like I gave everyone else.
You will recall that I gave you about five issues (maybe more) to get in
nominations to get things on the list.))</i> 

<p>
I enjoyed your offensive screed ... er, thoughtful editorial, regarding the
awards.  I concur that they've become cocooned.  I don't vote anymore - and I
religiously used to for years - because I don't have a  basis of meaningful
comparison.  I think the world of you and your services, but how do I vote for
you over four others whose work I know only by indirect reputation?  Didn't read
anything of the Walker Award nominees, so how do I vote on that?  (Maybe the
stuff is on a webpage somewhere for the reading and I'm just a solid lead dolt.)
<i>((They ***should*** be and this MUST be fixed in the future.))</i>
Ditto Hyatt and Koning awards ... there's no basis anymore.  Throwing votes
around based on ignorance is a dishonor to the awards, the process, the nominees
... and to my sense of what's fair.
<i>((You can always do write-ins.... I wrote in people where necessary to
offer my opinions.))</i>

<p>
And I have the same questions you raised about the committee ... I'm very glad
to see Gary Behnen, Dipper Honorarius Emeritus, included, but I didn't know he
was active at all in any way-shape-form.  Cool that he is.
Expansion to the PBEM (and that hybrid, e-snail**, play) gets my vote.

**  - Just made it up.  E-snail play would be the regular PBM-style play
augmented with (but not entirely dependant on) e-mail and internet
communication.  It combines the more leisurely pace of PBM deadlines and monthly
turn-arounds with the rapidity and ease of e-mail-ular communication.  A hybrid
form that ``Arsenic" is a good example of ... the one player not on the e-mail
went down first.  Maybe a coincidence, maybe not.

Hi,

<p>
Quickie note - I agree with you vis a vis the hobby. I don't believe the
folks that feel it is in decline, it is growing. However, the postal side
of the hobby IS fading (though it seems to have stabilized) as the
electronic side is growing by leaps and bounds. However, this is an 
aspect of the world's move towards a global society connected by wire 
rather than by post. 

<p>
I know I much prefer the feel of paper in my hand - and I don't think it
will completely disappear any time soon - but the world and technology
continues to grow and change. The Web and the ``e" lifestyle is where 
we are heading. We, as a hobby, need to bridge the two mediums 
(and you're doing a fine job of it!) - and along with it the 
Hobby Awards/Committee need to evolve.

<p>
On another tack, I'm quite enjoying the City of Austin. The live music
available is absolutely amazing. Take any weekend night and there will be
75-100+ different live bands playing and, even on a weeknight, you can 
find 40-50 or more. Just about all types of music are offered, 
from ska to punk, from blues to swing and Sunday mornings, gospel shows 
at the local BBQ spot. 

<p>
Quick Voting: B-52s - Rock Lobster;
Drug Songs - 3 for write-in ``White Rabbit";
Other Votes: Whip It, Magic Carpet Ride (3 votes), YMCA, Proud Mary
(5 votes)

slow dances more than the Beatles for the wiggling stuff.

I saw Willie Nelson play at the San Joaquin County Fair last week.
I was in the minority of first timers.  Got into the fair when it opened, 
waited in the first group of about 30 people waiting for the music venue to 
open, and after 150 minutes, walked in and grabbed a 5th row center seat, 
but about 30 feet from the stage and maybe 50 from him.  He played almost 
two hours, most every song I knew and lots of others.
	
<p>
The most amazing thing was not how ``cute" he was when he smiled, nor how 
good a time he was obviously having, but, that, before it got dark, he made 
eye contact AND personally gave a small wave to at least 500 people who waved 
at him.  OK, maybe 250, but a lot.  That and the wearing hats and bandanas 
that people threw up at him were what made the show so special to me.  A 
good time by all for all.

Jim:  here's something you may include in the music section of a later issue.

<p>
<p>
<center>STUPID DREAM</center><br>

<p>
Any Porcupine Tree fans out there?  Probably very few if any. Who are they?
They are a sonic, modern-day progressive rock band out of England who have 
just released their 5th album titled <i>Stupid Dream</i>.  
In addition, they have just completed their first ``official" tour 
of the States, and are already planning a second tour this fall.  
I managed to see back-to-back shows last month in Milwaukee and Chicago.  
After following them and their music for four years, mere words cannot 
describe how awesome and powerful the live shows were.  

<p>
The band itself began in '88 as a concept by Steven Wilson-lead guitar and
vocalist.  It has since grown to a full quartet with each member 
contributing to the music and song writing.  The definitive Porcupine Tree 
sound incorporates psychedelia, soaring guitars, thundering drums, and surreal 
keyboards.  They have been branded in the past as a Pink Floyd sound-a-like 
outfit.  This is true to the extent of Steven's guitar work is very similar to 
Dave Gilmour's on many songs. However, Porcupine Tree's overall approach is 
more to the point. 

<p>
My good music buddy and brother Eric originally got me into this fantastic 
band back in '95.  That was the year of what
can be called their `American break-through' with the release of the 
stellar <i>The Sky Moves Sideways.</i>  An instant classic
which vaguely resembles Pink Floyd with its guitar work, keyboards, and 
song-structure-the title track is made up of five astonishing movements 
which leaves you breathless by the conclusion.  Other incredible tracks 
include `Stars Die', `Moonloop', and `The Moon Touches Your Shoulder.'  
The concept of the album is based on space travel-yeah, I know; 
it's been done before.  
<i>((Yeah, but I love it.... the all time best such album is the
classic Intergalactic Touring Band release back in the 1970's.))</i>
But try this space-rock album out, and listen to it a few times.  
It is too cool and out of this world.  

<p>
Other releases by Porcupine Tree include <i>On the Sunday of Life</i> ('88), 
<i>Up the Downstair</i> ('93), and <i>Signify</i> ('96). 
I had managed to pick all three up on import in the fall of '97 
as I had never heard of these albums except the then newer <i>Signify.</i> 
This new fan became an instant devoted follower at the
psychedelic, chaotic, awe-inspiring opening tracks on <i>Up the Downstair.</i>  
Absolutely amazing record which begins with a mysterious instrumental 
track...``What you are listening to, are musicians... playing psychedelic 
music... under the influence of a mind-altering chemical called...."  And 
WHAM! The album 
fully launches into the crashing sounds of `Synesthesia', a track full of 
psychedelia, piercing guitar, droning keyboards, and Steven Wilson's distant
and eerie vocals.  It sets the tone for the rest of the album-win or lose, 
life or death, chaos or tranquility, etc. The final struggle happens near 
the end of the album with the intense, chaotic instrumental overture 
`Burning Sky'-hurling you towards the inevitable, only allowing a brief 
quiet moment to barely catch your breath at the sound of the clock ticking 
away. The song finishes in a series of loud, disturbing crashes on the drums, 
guitar and keyboards.....only the clock remains ticking as it fades away into 
the unbelievable `Fadeaway.'  The final track leaves you reassured that 
you have survived the chaos-but whether you lived, or died and went to 
another world seems to be the real question.....``Hit heaven far too high...."    

<p>
<i>Signify</i> was the first album where all four band members contributed 
to the music and song writing. What else can I say other than another 
fantastic record?  Another mysterious opening track `Bornlivedie' with 
the vague sound of a telephone conversation which suddenly gives way 
to the monsterous title track.  ``Signify" wreaks havoc with a powerful 
head-banging drum beat, accented by the Steven Wilson's now trademark guitar.  
The album as a whole is more textured with sporadic fits of rock assaults.  
And like preceding albums, it ends with a reassurance to be continued.  
<i>On the Sunday of Life</i> is a great record, however bizarre.  
It captures Porcupine Tree's raw beginning of 
experimentation and exploration-hmm, drug influence here?  
A classic song here on this record is `Radioactive Toy' - a song 
seemingly about the Saddam Hussein's in the world today: 
``Give me... the freedom to destroy... Give me.... radioactive toy...."   

<p>
The new album <i>Stupid Dream</i> follows a more pop-driven path than all 
previous releases by the Tree. However all the remaining elements are there.  
The first track, `Even Less' begins with a subtle keyboard intro that slowly 
grows.  Steven Wilson's definitive guitar rises and once again sets the 
theme of the track and the rest of the album; when suddenly the drums 
come crashing down.
  
<p>
WOW!! This is the sound of a band fully in charge of their music and perhaps
their own destiny-more than ever before.  The new album reeks full of catchy 
choruses, melodies and harmonies-very contagious material.  The track 
`Piano Lessons' is the most catchy song the band have ever done.  
All you will want to do is keep playing this song over and over and over 
again.  As with all previous albums, this one ends with a reassurance 
following all the loud, chaotic rock music in its content.  
This album finishes rather quietly, but it's a fitting ending.  

<p>
The concerts-beyond belief.  Intoxicatingly magnificent. Mesmerizing, 
and out-of-this-world amazing. They are similer to Pink Floyd when they 
hit the stage for the first few times-the psychedelic slide shows projecting 
onto the band, crazy lights, etc. Both shows in Milwaukee and Chicago 
were in small clubs packed with about 200 - 300 people.  
Meager numbers to say the least, but they aren't very renown over here 
in the States-yet.  They DO NOT get the credit they deserve. 
Both shows were well received by an awe-struck and 
highly appreciative crowd.  I can't rave enough about them.  

<p>
For brand new listeners, I would recommend getting the new album <i>Stupid 
Dream</i> for starters.  Porcupine Tree is highly recommended for 
progressive/space rock fans. Fantastic music here.  They'll blow you away.

<p>
Speaking of ``it ain't over", I managed to get a free ticket to SFO's final
Walk&#252;re, from a guy whose girlfriend canceled at the last minute.
Fortunately the saying is not true: otherwise, with Jane Eaglen and Deborah
Voigt sharing the stage, it would have been a very short opera indeed! (In
case you print this, your opera-impaired readers will want to know that Ms.
Eaglen and Ms. Voigt are two leading sopranos who - along with a third,
Sharon Sweet - are best known to the general public for their immense
girth. Ms Voigt, I think, is slightly less large than she has been in the
past, but I don't doubt that the two of them together still add up to 600
lbs.)
La Eaglen was disappointing. She sounded lovely but not thrilling, and her
characterization of Br&#252;nnhilde was unconvincing.  La Voigt, in contrast,
was to die for. I had seen her on a PBS special way back when and was
unimpressed, but as Sieglinde she was everything an opera queen could hope
for - gorgeous voice, delicious crisp diction, passionate and graceful,
every ounce of her divine.  I normally don't much care for sopranos, but I
loved her.

<p>

<center>mdl, markdlew of earthlink.net</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Good, this will fit in with a ``classical" bent to the next issue
music discussion.  I'm always on the look out for sopranos who
sound good to soprano challenged ears!))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Mark D Lew (Fri, 2 Jul 1999 18:27:39 -0700)</b>

<p>
Hm. La Voigt probably does not fall into that category. I loved her because
she was so good, but it was definitely in that ``operatic" way that doesn't
appeal to everyone. (My lengthier review of the Walk&#252;re can be found on
rec.music.opera, by the way.) I would perhaps recommend Sumi Jo, who has a
lovely sound which is high and pure and crystal-like. Some die-hard opera
fans find her to be too squeaky and lightweight, but she's reasonably
well-respected.  Incidentally, there is a theory in the opera community
that it is among Asian singers, and specifically Koreans, that the
traditional Italian style of bel canto singing is being best preserved.
Surprising, considering that just 10 years ago Asian opera singers were
about as common as Asian baseball players, but I can definitely see the
evidence.

<p>
The biggest brouhaha among opera fans these days is over Charlotte Church,
whose billing as a ``12-year-old soprano" drives some opera snobs
apoplectic. I've never actually heard Miss Church, but from what I gather
she's the latest in a long line of singers (eg, Andrea Bocelli) who lack a
solid vocal technique but make up for it with a certain charm which appeals
to the classical-lite crowd. (One can't help wondering if it somehow helps
to have a gimmick like blindness or pre-pubescence.) Opera fans, accustomed
to hearing the sound vocal technique necessary for non-miked live
performance, genuinely don't care for the sound of Miss Church et al.  When
they see the wider public buying her CDs by the millions and hailing her as
a talented ``opera singer", many of the more discriminating opera fans
become offended almost to the point of hysteria.

<p>

<center>mdl, markdlew of earthlink.net</center><br>

<p>
<i>((I've heard a very small amount of Charlotte Church and you have it
just about right.  I do not get apoplectic (however you spell that....)
about such trivialities, but it simply is impossible for a 12 year old
to have a fully developed adult voice, and she doesn't.  If I were
inclined to tweak, I would suggest why the anglophile crowd gushes
over boy sopranos in church music and why girls can't sing too.))

<p>
((If I were to compare Charlotte Church to some class of singers it
would be boy sopranos.  I like some of that music too, I try to take
everything on its own terms without getting too hung up on labels.))

<p>
((I didn't get to my classical music review or something I want to print
from Conrad, but it will allow me to toss out now that if anyone has
something interesting to say on that front, now would be a good time...
now, how 'bout that Al Gore....))</i>

<p>
So. You mentioned The Nice. Now there was a band! I saw
them a number of times, most notably on Hendrix's
first tour. Always in Newcastle upon Tyne which is
where British tours traditionally used to start. The
audience is the most responsive and most critical, so
it was always seen as a proving ground. Keith Emerson
used to stab his Hammond, then ride it like a rodeo
performer. The sounds he got out of that thing were
other-worldly. I swear nobody's played the instrument
so dramatically before or since. Towards the end of
their reign and just before ELP launched the supergroup
era, their party piece was <i>America</i>. On record it is
spectacular - especially the little drum break near the
end. On stage it was enormous. One of the major
memories of my extensive sixties/seventies concert
visits. The sheer tempo of the piece really got the
heart pounding. Then it all fell away a little with the
uninspired Five Bridges. Not before time, The Nice
broke up. I saw ELP on their debut performance at the
Isle of Wight festival in 1970, complete with real
cannons either side of the stage. Stadium rock arrived
to herald in the seventies!

<p>
For my money, Jethro Tull was the ultimate band of that
era. The showmanship and artistry of Ian Anderson was
unbelievable. I followed the band around the country
on their second Chrysalis tour when Blodwyn Pig and
Led Zeppelin supported them. Ah, memories ...

<p>
Someone had the temerity to suggest that few of your
readers would have been aware of the start of the
Beatles era. I remember clearly the very first time I
heard ``She Loves You''. It was a Saturday, and all the
angelic little choristers (not!) were in the vestry
enrobing in readiness for two weddings. Amid a great
swell of excitement (the choirboys were to receive an
unheard-of a crown for their work and I, as head
chorister, would take home three half-crowns (look it
up!)), we were half-listening to the radio. Family
Forces Favourites was playing on the Light Programme.
A request show for forces personnel to send messages
abroad, it was one of the few places where rock and
roll and the new ``pop" music could be heard on the
strait-laced BBC. A raucous sound issued forth which
refused to settle into any sense of true harmony (I
was a music scholar at the time!), and I grimaced. The
rest of the boys berated me for expressing my dislike
for the song. Even in those days, the views of the
many outweighed considered musical appreciation. The
song was certainly different, but to my ears it was too
raw and under-produced. It was another six months
before the Lennon-McCartney team started to discover
how to write consistently. When <i>With The Beatles</i>
appeared, I was hooked. Today, as a devoted fan of
Brian Wilson and all things surf, I make no bones about
placing <i>Revolver</i> alongside <i>Pet Sounds</i> as my all-time
favourite albums.

<p>
More British sexual euphemisms. The latest television
commercial campaign for something called Power Bar
employs the slogan ``Don't Bonk". I take this to mean
``Don't Hit The Wall". Needless to say, in England it
means ``Don't Engage In Sweaty Sex". I've informed the
producers of the item. I shall report on their reply.
I suggested that they test the market fully before
venturing into Europe!!

<p>

<i>((I don't think I've
ever actually talked to someone who SAW the Nice in person.
I have all of the great Nice records (even <b>Five Bridges</b>, the

I've always been nutty over ``Happy Freuds", ``Thoughts of

Enduring a Murder She Wrote marathon on A&amp;E, I was

innocent little word" is the thought which no doubt
crosses the minds of readers both British and American
alike, but the conversation which ensued will enlighten

there another way to pronounce it?" Me: ``You know, I've
always pronounced it `solder', as in - oh, I dunno -
bolder, colder, folder, holder, older, polder ... "
Pat: ``Really? How strange. That certainly doesn't sound
right to me. I've always pronounced it `solder', as in
... er ... " Me: ``Fodder?" Pat: ``Er ... yes" At this
juncture, Pat suggested I look it up in the Canadian
dictionary and, in passing, called me pedantic, nit-
picking (I resisted the temptation to point out ...
oh yes, I see what she means), British (I take great
exception to the latter. The way she says it makes me
sound SO dirty!).

<p>
I looked it up. Sure enough, in both American and
Canadian dictionaries it is shown as `sodder'. In the
British-English dictionary it is listed as `solder'.
The curious thing is that not one of the authorities
acknowledges the existence of an alternative
pronunciation. How very strange. I recall seeing the
episode of Murder She Wrote way back when in England
(I lied when I said I ``endured" the marathon!), and I
an certain I would have remembered the curious word.
It must have been overdubbed to save the blushes of
English audiences at the double-entendre. Significantly
the estimable Ms Fletcher does not utter the word at
all. It would have been incongruous indeed issuing from
such prim and proper lips.
<i>((Interesting.... from the pronunciation of the 
word, I would have sworn that WE got it from the Brits.))</i>

<p>
I am struck by an apparent penchant for Americans to
adopt the most awkward pronunciation of a word when it
enters the language. Skimming over the delightful case
of the herb garden wherein the `h' is dropped but no
attempt is made to use the French form, ending up as
the ugly ``Urb", I refer in the
main to the car firms (or ve-hickle manufacturers)
most recently arriving on these shores. Hyundai is
now, and shall evermore be Hoonday. Nissan is Neesarn, and Daewoo
(which an extensive advertising campaign in
the UK taught us to pronounce Dey-oo) is, of course,
Daywoo. On the other side of the coin, of course, when
our German friends took over Chrysler (what, they
didn't? Oh) it was the original German Dime-ler which
was adopted. Now, far be it from me to pass judgement
(judgment!) one way or the other. I am an amateur
scholar of living language. I simply delight in seeing
this evolution in progress. Living in Canada I am
afforded the opportunity to take a step back from most
of the differences, but I must comment that the
publication of the most recent Canadian dictionary does
concern me somewhat. Whereas before, both British and
Canadian varieties of a word were given equal strength,
now there is a tendency to relegate the former to no
more than a mention under ``archaic" or ``Br var",
despite the fact that everyday usage has not changed. I
wonder how long it will be before American English has
swept across Canada in the same way as it threatens to
do across the UK. I enjoy the differences, the
anacronisms, the colloquialisms. Is it really all
Bill Gates' fault? My spell-checker would imply that
this is so. I shall continue to use such words as
``whilst" and ``wherefore" and ``wherein" in everyday
speech - and damn the consequences!
<i>((I've actually picked up ``whilst'' as I find it
a very useful word.
Please don't tell me what American English word I 
``should'' use instead.  I don't want to know....))</i>

<i>((Russ Rusnak has asked me a question about Canada 
and knowing you, this is the right place to put it....))

<p>
((He asks if it is true that the Canadian Human Rights
Commission has called for a major review to determine
if social condition or poverty should be listed nationally
as a ``protected class''.
This presumably would outlaw Rush Limbaugh's radio program
from being syndicated in Canada since ``truth'' is not a
defense under your human-rights laws.))</i>

<p>
Was it in <i>TAP</i> where I read this theory of baseball?  That due to the way
the money works there are three types of teams in baseball:

<p>
1. teams that can afford to be good all the time;

<p>
2. teams that can make a run at it every few years, but then have to sell
off their players the following year; and

<p>
3. teams that have no money and will always be bad.

<p>
I mentioned this theory to my sister, who is a long-time Mariners fan
(season tickets for about eight years, I think), suggesting that perhaps
the Mariners are in category 2.  Her response was that they ought to be,
but their management is too stupid to accept financial reality and play it
that way. They didn't put up the now-traditional fire sale following '95,
but neither will they spend the money to make a serious attempt at a
championship team. Instead, year after year they put up a half-ass team
that can't quite make it.

<p>
She told me she thinks Junior ought to leave the team so he can get into a
World Series before it's too late.  (That, comment, in fact, is what
prompted me to inquire about the prospect of the Ms' future.) The exact
sentence - which for me required a follow-up explanation but presumably
makes sense to baseball fans more attentive than I am - was, ``Junior's a
great guy, but he's no Kirby Puckett."

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>The next Breaking Away is filling that will appear here.
See details under the Breaking Away game below.
The other game is starting in <i>Tinamou</i>.
See the subszine for more details.

<p>
I am starting one more regular Diplomacy game.
In the game so far is Buddy Tretick.
See Buddy's letter above in the ``Search For'' section of the szine.
Although this has to be considered something of a ``feature'' game, I won't
name it after him since the previous such games I've done like that have
had the featured person be eliminated quickly.
I think I'll find an appropriate Mekons song for the game name.
I expect this to fill quickly and will give preference to any of
the old <i>Le Front</i> crowd should they want to play.
Send $20 for the game start, which gives you a subscription for
however long the game lasts and $5 in refundable NMR insurance.

<p>
The only other Diplomacy oriented opening left is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
These will be the last Diplomacy game openings until more games end.
Even though there has been no interest yet, perhaps some will develop
with a little more publicity.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
I'm also printing the rules in this ``rules blowout'' issue.
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I am open to suggestions on the latter, though I want to print maps and
***I*** don't know how to make the rings rotate easily.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Stephen Agar claims the Borg and Russell Roe claims the Federation.
I'm expanding my net and hope to fill this soon.
This game also has the $20 game fee ($5 of it refundable for NMR insurance).

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Note that I tried to allow an army to move into the water and a fleet
to move without specifying the coast where there were two possibilities.
More comments in the press below.

<p>
2) I hope it isn't because he couldn't read the map (although he said his
dog was ripping the map off the wall....) but Scott Morris has decided
to resign now, rather than let his position fall apart.
Veteran Colonia player Karl Schuetz is appointed in his place.
I'd really like to run the Fall turn on time.
If a delay is demanded, it is going to have to be a six week delay
because I need to keep the game seasons in the szine balanced.
Still, if Karl insists, we shall have a delay (i.e. to September 11th).

<p>
3) Use the first E-Mail address for Heath Gardner as the other two
have been giving him problems lately.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(OSLO): Scandinavian anti-submarine forces were placed on emergency alert,
after hearing rumors that a Dutch underwater demolition team had sailed 
from Antwerp and was conducting maneuvers in the area.

<p>
(OTTO to WHOM IT MAY CONCERN): If I wrote you and you did not reply; you will
not hear from me again, until you do reply.

<p>
(ANTWERP to VIENNA): Dutch diplomats reassured the Austrian embassy today
that their two great nations are getting along swimmingly.

<p>
(GM QUESTIONS):

<p>
1) Do I allow Black Press? 
A: Yes, absolutely.
I think it makes the game more fun.
If you want to negotiate, write letters, but write press for fun.

<p>
2) Shouldn't the move to Helgoland fail because Helgoland is a sea space?
A: Yes, mea culpa, mea culpa.

<p>
3) Did the English move specify a coast in moving to Siam?  If that is how
the player wrote it, it should fail.
A: And it does, it does.

<p>
4) Shouldn't Fleet Hague have gone to Hanover(WC) as there is no Hamburg?
A: Right you are.
The three or four of you who hit on each of these are going to help me a lot,
I think.
I have decided that I am going to print one page maps with spring and fall 
movement seasons.
It seems that last check is the only way I am going to minimize errors on
a map that I don't know very well.

NMRed elsewhere in the szine.
As a precaution, I have called John Schultz as a standby for the

As explicitly stated in my house rules, you MAY make orders
conditional on who is playing the Italian position.

the North and an abrasive - albeit mentally unstable - threat from the South.
I hope you've got the good King's ear in Rome.

<p>
(TSAR KRISTOF RONALDOVICH - TURKISH SCUMSUCKERS): The Tsar will not stand for
such a VIOLATION of Russia and her peoples! I enjoy vacationing in Crimea
during the summer months (I tan quite well!) and raping and pillaging and
enslavement usually means work. I hate taking work with me on vacation.
Nonetheless I do appreciate your predicament. I've been to Constantinople and
after visiting that hapless little burg I can see why you'd be interested in

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I'm not printing your new country starting positionss until next time, 
but note that
Spring 1903 deadline where Heath Gardner will be Austria, Mike Barno
England, Sandy Kenny France, Jody McCullough Germany, Richard Weiss
Italy, Sara Reichert Russia, and John Schultz Turkey.

<p>
2) Note Heath's new preferred E-Mail address.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(MIKE to JIM):  You live at latitude 41.837413 degrees north, longitude
71.433754 degrees west, in block 44007002300402.  (That's state 44,
county 007 in that state, tract 0023.00 in that county, block group 4 in
that tract, block 02 in that block group.)

<p>
(JIM-BOB to MIKE): I was told that my long/lat was N 41 degrees 50.220 minutes and
W 71 degrees 25.976 minutes.  This translates to 41.837000
and 71.432933 by my calculator.  By placing me a little north
and a little east of the center of my yard, I believe your program
is zeroing in on the tree in my front yard.  An understandable
error.....
you have my census block and tract correct.

<p>
(MIKE to JIM):  Was the pointcode you quoted based on the NAD27 or NAD83
datum?  The marketing industry's geocoding segment has been still on the
1927 standards for years; Claritas is just switching its default to
NAD83 with the 1999 updates of its many products.  I don't remember
which datum I was using for this inquiry.
<i>((Beats me, I was using DeLorme's Street Atlas product.))</i>

<p>
(MIKE to JIM): Besides Street Atlas, DeLorme also produces MapExpert.  
Others in my
group use them to identify points, build polygons to define study areas,
and in a couple of people's cases, to actually produce maps for
clients.  I don't use any software of these types (except a couple of
jobs I loaded files into MapInfo but didn't do much except SQL Queries).
Odds are Street Atlas has both NAD's.

<p>
(ENGLAND to ALL): Hope you all had a nice Fourth of July...But remember, the
fireworks won't end just yet..there's still a lot of nuking to do!!  

<p>
(FRANCE to BRITS): In retaliation for your entirely unprovoked attack on
Brest and all surrounding areas.
                                  
<p>
(MIKE to SIR KENTLEYBOROUGHFORDSON):

<p>
Forest
 
<p>
dark green
 
<p>
a ponderosa pine

<p>
a nesting falcon

<p>
a family of squirrels

<p>
an interdependent community

<p>
each one indispensable to all.

<p>
(MIKE to DOC MUNSON):  The planet was dark green.  Many things were born
on the planet.  Yellow-and-black bees, orange and lime trees, pink
panthers, red dogs, average white teams, poisonous plants called blue
devils.  There was even a brief time in the Cretaceous era when one-eyed
one-horned flying purple people eaters roamed the land.  (They died out
because there were no people to eat during the Cretaceous.)  Each plant
and animal eventually sank back into the dark green swamp or the dark
green moss.  No creature lived forever, yet the planet lives on.  The
dark green shall win in the end.
<i>((Not in this here szine it won't!!!))</i>

<p>
(MIKE to SARA):  That was absolutely the most genteel, tactful,
delicate, subtle, ``ladylike" ultimatum of nuclear blackmail ever
directed at me.

<p>
(SARA REICHERT to MIKE BARNO): Excuse me, sir, but I have bone to pick
with you about your statement that I work for ``check-cashing loan
sharks''.
Loan sharks??
You obviously do not know what is going on in southern California with the
banks.
Two blocks west and two blocks south of my Mother's house (where I 
prefer to have my mail sent) is a shopping center.
This shopping center has a Bank of America doing business about 25 yards
from a check-cashing service!
Or maybe it is the other way around.
This is true all over southern California.

<p>
Why?
Because we have had a wave of bank mergers, with the big getting bigger by 
eliminating the smaller.
The big banks will not cash checks for lower income people without excessive
fees.
Set up fees, account fees, minimum balance fees, per-check fees, fees 
for using the ATM, fees for not using the ATM, fees for teller service,
and so forth.
The check cashing businesses cash checks at a lower rate than what Bank
of America and the other big banks would.
Also, in many neighborhoods there are no banks, so what would the people
do without the check cashing services?

<p>
I am awaiting an apology.

<p>
(GERMANY - GM): Free abuse points for good press of bad puns!  Thou knowest 
not what thou encourages, but such dumbness is why you are endearing.  That 
and your love of pussies.  Come, come Sara, read the interesting comments 
about ``Shag" and ``buggerer" elsewhere in <i>TAP</i> 220 before 
you tell the Boobie that he is a sweet man because he likes pussies!  
<i>((And you know, of course, that Arthur Schnitzler would have 
defined a sweet man as ``an attractive young man intent on sexual
escapades without exacting financial rewards or, for that matter,
fidelity.''
Schnitzler is gaining current fame for providing the story that
inspires Stanley Kubrick's last film <b>Eyes Wide Shut</b>.))</i>
And Charlotte has claws.
<i>((Let there be no doubts... thank you for setting me up so well.))</i>

<p>
(GERMANY - ITALY): How about nuking a hero sandwich next time.

<p>
(SARA-GM): A true friend is one you don't have to talk to anymore
once the food is on the table.
My 22nd birthday was on 16 June.
I have plenty of practice if I ever do get married, since cats
teach us girls how to live with creatures who are basically useless
and lie around the house doing nothing, just like future husbands.
OK, I understand now... if I abuse you first I can abuse the other
players second, right?
<i>((Right.))</i>
But why would I want to abuse the other players?
This is only a game, after all.
<i>((Snicker, snicker, snicker....))</i>

<p>
(JOHN BOY-BOOB): 5 or 6!
Is my feminine side showing?
Everyone left me alone.

<p>
(GERMANY): I took my 12 yo son, Alexander, on a rafting trip Sunday.  
Foothills of the Sierra (So. Fork of the American River).  Mostly riffles 
and some Class 2 rapids over 11 miles.  I think there were 4 class 3 rapids. 
One family was from Missouri.  He fixed turbines in power generating 
plants.   Recently had to go to a nuclear reactor to work on one.  They made 
him change out of the regular nylon work clothes to cotton, telling him that 
the nylon collected too much of the natural radiation in the background and 
would set the meters off when he exited.  He insisted that they do swab 
tests of the turbines before working on them - they were ``cool" and he 
worked about 10 hours.  When he left, his nylon briefcase set the meters 
haywire.
He had to take each piece of paper out and pass them through the meter 
separately to enable them to get out.  He tossed the briefcase, not wanting 
to become hot.

<p>
While undergoing the process of getting out, he learned that there were two 
other generators going, both had steam leaks which were radioactive, the 
meters were always going off and the workers had been told nothing out of 
the ordinary except that they had to wear cotton clothes.  The man I was 
rafting with was strongly opposed to nuclear energy now!  As we all should 
be.  He felt that the regulations and safety requirements for nuclear were 
below those of other means of generating electricity. He also didn't believe 
in the value of building further hydroelectric systems in the US.

<p>
Moral to the story - boycott nuclear.  Boycott nuclear dip games even.
<i>((I presume you HAVE heard of Karen Silkwood, haven't you?
This was no surprise to me, unfortunate, but not surprising.))</i>

<p>
(JOHN BOY - RICHARD): You do a damn good job of faking my press style.
You got the tempo.

<p>
(LONGEST TRAVERSABLE BLACK HOLE ROUTE - BOARD): Great, let's do it!!!

<p>
(LABCON REPORT): July 4th weekend saw four days of very enjoyable
gaming at the Hudson River estate of Bruce and Krissi Linsey.  About
thirty people and five dawgs attended and all played games.  In fact,
when this reporter left Monday afternoon, there were 106 games logged
and two more in progress.  Those games included over seventy different
titles.  Your humble correspondent learned six new games out of fourteen
boardgaming/cardgaming sessions:  Empire Builder, Ra (twice), Die
Siedler von Catan (with the simple expansion for five players), McMulti
(twice), El Caballero, Titan, Lowenherz, Durch die Wuste (``Through the
Desert" or ``Through the Sausage" because the German set box looks like
``...Wurst"), Crazy Race, WizWar, Wrott &amp; Swindlers, and Suppenkasper.
Won three games, almost won three others, and came in so far last I
couldn't see next-to-last-place in three other games.  I also played a
bit of hackysack - too hot to do much outside but swim - but the
bouncehound Mary Jane won that by biting the sack open so it lost its
beans.  The primary non-FTF activity was discussion of Gonzo Football
and Gonzo Baseball fantasy leagues run by Bruce and Krissi.  Baseball
was at the All-Star break, football has drafted in real life and we're
trading holdover players and Gonzo draft picks before the Gonzo draft.
Everyone had a blast.  I ended up buying El Caballero at a friend's game
store on the way home because it's a better game for $20 than many of
the $40-55 games (such as its sister game, past Game of the Year winner
El Grande).

<p>
(PLAINFIELD-MOTORCYCLE MANIA): I have a 1969 Swivelhead, a 1946 Flathead
and enough parts to piece together a Panhead.
Honda heads?
There <b>is</b> no motorcycle but Harley!

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Phil Reynolds is called as a standby for Russia.
You may make your builds and retreats conditional on who ends up 
playing the Russian position.
Again, following my house rules, even though Russia has no adjustments,
he needs to send Spring file orders by the Winter deadline in order to 
keep the position.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ADMIRAL KIRK VON AUSTIN to THE TURKISH HIGH COMMAND): The Magyars have
requested Austrian aid.
Bulgaria must be brought into the Empire!
Let the sky be filled with the rumble of our guns!!!
It is our Destiny....

<p>
(SCOTT to GERMANY): My apologies.

<p>
(I to F): I guess this means no christmas card this year?

<p>
(MUNSON to DWYER): Will you ever speak again, good sir?
<i>((We're going to see, aren't we???))</i>

<p>
(AMBASSADOR KENT POLL&#196;RD to ZA WORLD): Zis is madness!
I leave for a few months vacation in za Alps and vhen I
return all Hell breaks loose!
It is out of my hands.
<i>((Sure, sure.... perhaps you'd like to vacation on your
very own bridge from Manhattan to Brooklyn next?
I've got one to sell....))</i>
Za High Command is out of control.
Damn.
Now I vill have to start drawing up Declarations of Var 
against everyone....

<p>
(I to A-H[CUTE LITTLE RINGS TOUCHING]): Wonder-twin powers...... 
ACTIVATE!!!! Form of...A BUCKET OF SHIT!!!! Shape of.....
A TWO-FACED BASTARD!!!!

<p>
(VIENNA CHEESE COMPANY to THE PRESS): ``We are quite saddened
upon hearing of the Death of Pope Pervert II.
We hope his large frame fits his casket well and that all who loved
him seek counsel and peace.
Let it be known that we serve and ship only the finest variety
of cheese products and we accept no blame for his demise.
Our motto has always been, eat heartily and well...''

<p>
(MUNSON to BARNO): Yes, the earthquakes have been causing havoc 
with the boiling river. It's actually getting hotter! 
Makes you wonder about the ``plumbing" to the Terraces. 
Perhaps they ``sprung a leak" that is now feeding the favored bathing 
thermals of the boiling river. One of these days the whole area is 
going to go sky high. It will end up being called ``Mammoth Crater" 
or perhaps ``Gardiner Lake" in some future history book, no doubt. 
I can see it now. Tour guides explaining that there used to be a 
``picturesque little community" that was here, before the largest 
thermal explosion in U.S. history created this beautiful mountain lake... 

<p>
(MIKE to SARA, a team cheer):  

<p>
If you're getting tired of the daily work routine,

<p>
if you need a little break from that same old job scene,

<p>
don't sit alone and grumble 'til you blow your spleen,

<p>
grab a partner, dance for joy like we do on Mean Green!

<p>
(MIKE to TERRY, on building positive cooperation instead of degenerating
into squabbling opposition):
All around, chaos.  Crowds.  The e-mail server's gonna crash.
Boasting, bragging, feuding, threats.  The color war brings madness here.
What if you need teamwork, guiding partners through the clash?
Find your haven with MEAN GREEN and make your journey without fear!

<p>
(FIELD MARSHAL JON RHODEHAMEL to THE K&#196;ISER):  It takes a good Austrian
to rule over the German People.
Our sabres are out of their sheaths!
Let the Battle commence!

<p>
(-NEWS FROM THE FLEETS-):
Father Quido, M.O.P. (Mail Order Pope), has spent the 
last week visiting Admiral Flashman's flagship, and has found 
the entertainment ``quite favourable." 
He especially enjoyed the diverse forms of alcohol to be found 
aboard and the fact that Pinochle partners were plentiful. 
He showed concern about the fact that the men didn't appear 
ready for war, the whoring and general debauchery of Tunis still 
fresh upon them. Admiral Flashman comforted our beloved M.O.P. 
by assuring him ``morale was high" and that men fight better 
``when they can enjoy the spoils of victory." 
The fact that there was no fight to gain Tunis didn't seem to matter.

<p>
(PORTUGUESE LANDOWNER to GM): Damn you, for not giving us our own forces! 
We need to be defended!! We call upon the fair and just forces of...Russia! 
Help us in our time of need!

<p>
(BOOB to PORTUGUESE SQUATTERS): Bet you were wishing you decided to let
them keep their freedom awhile longer, eh??
Calling on Russia right now was exceptionally poor timing.

<p>
(PORTUGUESE LANDOWNER to FAT DEGO): Can an idiot live past '04? 
I don't think so. You cut your own throat.

<p>
(MUNSON to TALLMAN): Are you an opportunist?

<p>
(FROM SOMEWHERE): Two men upon arriving in Warsaw could not believe
their eyes.
Austrian soldiers everywhere!
Both of the Russian forward observers were exhausted.
<i>((Exhausted is not a popular name for Russian mothers anymore
then, is it?))</i>
``Now where?''
His comrade looks to the East.
``Perhaps Moscow will be safe.''
On they trudge.
In the distance a faint song follows them... ``Sit on my face...''

<p>
(PALACE OF LIGHT AND GLORY):  Though many objectives have been attained
and few casualties suffered in recent Ottoman military activities, there
was a lack of new directives from the Sublime Porte.  Field commanders
ascribed the silence to the traditional post-victory celebration and its
inevitable aftereffects.  Indefatigable, they carried on, repeating the
orders that guided the previous campaign.  Perseverance must provide
what leadership temporarily could not.

<p>
(REYKJAVIK, ICELAND):  Here at the International Geothermohydrodynamics
Institute, it was announced that researchers have discovered the reason
for the recent changes in the eruption cycles of most of Yellowstone
Park's geysers.  It has been determined that Scott Munson, a religious
fanatic linked to Elizabeth Clare Prophet's doomsday cult, moved from a
hotel with a septic system to a trailer with an outhouse.  Now whenever
Mr. Munson's bowels move, the resulting forceful blast of hot, noxious,
pressurized gasses and expelled semisolids puts a major charge into the
subterranean network of fissures.  Pockets of water get superheated and
blown up out of the ground at previously unknown places and frequencies.

<p>
(HANS THE NEER MAKER): Vhy?
O vhy?

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I have called Glenn E. L. Petroski (GELP) as a standby for the
vacant French position.
 
<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY to BOARD): Sorry about the lack of diploming this turn guys.  I'll
get better about that soon.

<p>
(DAVE P to GOZ): Got to watch it when you start using statistics son.
A 59% win ratio for the higher paid team isn't that big of a deal
when you figure that random chance gives you 50%.  Add in the fact 
that that 41% worth of losses can be distributed in many different
ways and about all you are saying is that maybe the two highest 
pad teams are very likely to make it into the playoffs, and that
really shouldn't be a big surprise.  And when you get to the Series,
a 59% chance to win each game in a 7 game series isn't exactly what
I'd call a sure thing!

<p>
(EM-MERT to GO-EL): Nice timing, leaving for a week and a half before the
deadline.  I suppose you wouldn't want to hear what we were all saying
about you anyway.

<p>
(STEVE to DREW): ``Stumbled"?  ``STUMBLED"?  Indeed you did not stumble
into eighteen, unless you consider that you &#228;ccidentally" stabbed the
bejeebies out of me.  No matter; I have determined not to show you my
back in this game, you treacherous rascal.

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH): I stand by my preseason foolish prediction of Manny
Ramirez for AL MVP.  Lookin' pretty good right now (eighty-something
RBI's at the halfway point), but I know better then to go filling out a
deposit slip based on half a season.  As for my own particular rooting
interest, the Dodgers finished the first half at eleven games under
.500.  They're cooked; they'd have to play about .725 ball in the second
half just to win the wildcard.  All those millions . . . maybe I'll
become a Pirates fan or something.  Bring on hockey season!
<i>((They just announced the schedule and training camp will be
opening soon for hockey.... gee, this stuff never stops.
In the realm of foolish predictions, one element of why the Women's 
World Cup Soccer tournament was popular, in my view, is that there 
were a lot of scoring chances in generally exciting games.
I almost started to believe that Women's Soccer would pick up
where Men's won't in this country because of all that exciting scoring!
Then came the ``FINAL DAY":
both the runner up game and the championship game decided on shootouts
from 0-0 scoring during the regular game.
All that open field stuff that marked earlier games in the tournament
was mostly gone as strategies ``shifted''.
Since we won the Women's World Cup, we have the right to demand changes
where we don't on the male side and I think someone should think up
ways to force that attacking style we saw early on in the Cup.
We can enact it just for the women and watch that sport take off.
I am no expert, but the fact that the women are physically smaller,
so that the goalie can't cover the entire goal as well suggests VERY
strongly that the solution is a larger goal mouth - perhaps much larger.
I think it would be neat if the women were smaller in stature defending
a larger goal than the men.
Take that and smoke it!!))</i>

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): I really hope you can come up with some
easier names for this ``The Search for . . ." thingie.  Why, I've never
even heard of most of these guys.  How 'bout somebody we all know -
like, say, Don Williams?  I think I might be able to find him for you.
<i>((But why would you want to??
We gotta search for people we want to find!!
You still haven't found Garret, you know.
Offer me some other suggestions.
I found my copy of Jim Meinel's old Encyclopedia of Zines, so I have lots
of reminders of old szine editors I'd like to find, but please feel free
to send me in another direction.))</i>

<p>
(JEAN PAUL SARTRE to LUKE): Hello?  Are you there?

<p>
(LUKE to SARTRE): That depends.  Are YOU there?

<p>
(TURKEY to AUSTRIA): I've got your Slobodan guy here; will trade for
Rusnak's carcass.

<p>
(ROME to VIENNA): So you'd rather fight than switch?  Okay by us, but
it'll cost you.

<p>
(NAPLES to MOSCOW): You've been in a bodacious mood for somebody who's
getting
nowhere fast.  And now you've opened the floodgates in the North:  we
can hear
you now-``blub, blub, blub."

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) See David Partridge's new game start in <i>Tinamou</i> and note
the Version 2.3 rules published in this issue.
The next game, with Version 2.3 rules, will include David Partridge, 
John Schultz, Tom Howell, Harry Andruschak and John Harrington, as
they all have expressed interest in this game.
That means I need only ONE more player.

<p>
2) No one fills in the 69 to earn the guys at the back of the main pack
the really big points.... three more sprint scoring places left to claim,
betting would be on Stan Marsh, Flopsy, and Mopsy to take them, but 
choices abound.
Barkin' Larkin' helps Damon Velodrome accumulate the ``big'' points at
the trailing back of the pack.
GM rejects Will Shakespeare's request to turn the race around and race
for the starting line instead of the finish.
That would be an interesting addition..... roll a six sided die every 
turn, when it comes up a one, everyone switches direction....
well, not really, of course, but a passing thought.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(BUNNIES):  We like the multiple breakaway bonus too.  It adds some
danger to the game.  Someone can go hop-hop-hopping along at the front.

<p>
Analysis from Vegas:

<p>
Farmer McGregor's Dinner:  these four bunnies all have moderately
good cards or positions.  Presuming they get at least two scorers in
this sprint, the bunnies could steal the race if they can get three
good finishes in the last sprint.  Position has really improved
recently.

<p>
Chef's Crackers:  OK, getting Kenny to the front is really nice. 
Still, after winning the sprint, the Crackers are 9 points behind
the Stooges.  Will need more than just Kenny to win the race.  
Too many unclaimed points out there.

<p>
Goz &amp; Co.  Should avoid embarrassment of not scoring in this round
when Wheelhub limps across in 8th place.  Damon is already dropped,
and on the whole, the cards are not good.  A very long shot.

<p>
Brit Pack:  If Shakespeare were still in race, might be considered
a frontrunner.  Alfred has great position but lousy cards.  
Will be in better shape when Logie-Baird joins him.  Really needs
Newton to score some big cards.  Could win with two or three
strong finishes.  Has to avoid Stooges' fate of getting
shut out after racing ahead of pack.

<p>
Stooges:  Points in the hand are always great.  Stooges' first sprint
leaves them still in the frontrunner position.  However, they
cannot get shut out in the final sprint like they did in the second.
The good news for them is that they are leading, and they have all
four riders.  The bad news is that they have 12 cards, and 11 of
them are 5 or lower.  

<p>
Flat Wheelers:  Shane will score, but not much.  Meg has lost 
her good cards and is in big trouble.  Jason is in slightly better
shape.  Beyond long shot.  

<p>
(TFWS - VEGAS): Thank you!
No one has ever Mea-ed my culpa before.
Didn't even know I had one.

<p>
(FARMER-VEGAS):  But, alas, the carrots were scarce last turn!

<p>
(JOHN BOY -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> DAVE): If I haven't said so already, and you still
can use another, sign me up.
<i>((He's full, but you're in for the next game start here.))</i>

<p>
(DAMON to BARKIN'): If we're even, I'll play my 4 and you fall behind me to
pick up a 4, then draft past.  Otherwise I'll play a 3 next time and I'll
draft past.  Won't THEY ALL be surprised when we win this thing?

<p>
(JOHN BOY -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> BOOB): You called good money.
I was truly expecting a better card for Shane last turn but <i>no one</i>
did anything I anticipated and the field got busted up something fierce.
Now it's just ``let's save face best we can.''

<p>
(STOOGES - CHEF): In regards to the breakaway rule, I think the single
term bonus better simultates a real race, and I'd also add that I
think it will add to the excitement more.  In a real race, a group
of riders cooperating SHOULD be able to catch a rider in the lead.
It will not be quick, but it will happen.  In the current scenario,
this is virtually impossible.  If you give the break away rider one
good card to stay out there, then the pack behind is going to gain,
but only slowly and only if they cooperate.  Three or four riders 
working together are not going to gain ground very quickly, and by the
stage of the game where you have a break away, the odds are against
having a large pack that can quickly coordinate catching up.  That means
a well timed break away should guarantee crossing the next point line
first, but it won't guarantee staying out in front until the next one,
which is as it should be IMHO.

<p>
(THE DESIGNER SPEAKS):
About that multiple breakaway bonus - I presume you mean that you are in
favour of the leader getting the breaking away bonus on every turn (as per
the rule we are using in this game).  I agree that ``in a real race, you
cannot just sit in the pack and wait for the leader to come back to you" but
in a real race the leader would be working all by himself with no one to
take their turn as a mobile wind-break.  In these circumstances why should
the leader receive a bonus?  Of course, one might argue that the leader
should not receive any sort of breaking away bonus at all, even on the first
turn he breaks away, and that's a valid viewpoint but then I'd have to
change the name of the game! 

<p>
(GOZ TRANSPORTATION CO., QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE PARENT COMPANY, GOZ &amp; CO.,
INC.):  Profits up $3M last quarter, a disappointing showing considering.  We
expected that the CEO would have a winning bet in Vegas, and came up
snake-eyes.  He has been sacked, along with the entire team.  The team won't
find out until (unless?) they reach the finish line.

<p>
(TFWS-VEGAS): I didn't say you weren't right.
I just said I took offense.
Never tell an ugly person they're ugly.
It's not nice.

<p>
(BRIT PACK - STOOGECYCLES): If our two teams merge scores we might just have a
chance of beating Chef's Crackers.

<p>
(TFWS-WHOEVER): British comedy makes American comedy shows look pathetic,
in general.
Monty Python, of course; Faulty Towers may have been the funniest show
ever produced; 
<i>((Aided by the fact that relatively few were made....))</i>
and Dave Allen told the best straight joke of anyone I've ever seen -
just to name a few.

<p>
(RICK RESPONDS TO GO-EL'S INCESSANT WHINING): <i>((Heading written
by a meddling GM...))</i>
It's ridiculous for Cubs fans to complain about money.  Hello!
Chicago is the 3rd largest city in the U.S.  The Cubs are on WGN,
which gives them more cable exposure than anybody but the Braves (and
perhaps the Yankees).   The Indians have done a lot more with a lot
less in terms of fundamental resources.  Just when did Cleveland
become a big market and Chicago a small market?  The problem here is
that the Cubs management is incompetent.  
The above opinion is largely stolen from Rob Neyer of ESPN.com, who
writes the best baseball column I've encountered.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:
http://www.dragonfire.net/&#126; Cyberia/modern.htm

<p>
2) Randy Ellis takes over the Russian position as he has orders on file and
I didn't hear from Rich. 

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``His pleasures were a mystery to us all;
You'd never see him out after dawn.
In a German sea-port town; He takes coffee in the red-light;
And now he is the Prince of Darkness.''
From the song ``Prince of Darkness'', on the album <i>Honky Tonkin'</i>.
Now, who could that be referring to???

<p>
(UKRAINE to GREATER GERMAN REICH): Close, but the effects are about
the same.

<p>
(ELLIS to POLLARD): If I get this rather modest little position in this game, I 
trust you will send your forces in Siberia back to Turkey where they belong. 
How goes it in California? Gardiner, MT, is no doubt the same without you (or 
me, for that matter).
<i>((You got it, so have at it!))</i>

<p>
(JEFF to DAVE): I disagree with your analogy of me hitting a bees' nest
with a stick.
Most of my political printed opinions were in response to Harry's just
slightly to the left of Jane Fonda's Liberal view of the world.
It is understandable that my slightly to the right of the Sheriff
of Nottingham views conflict with his, but in my opinion he is the one
who stirs up the bees' nest.
He drew ``First Blood'', not me. 

<p>
(GREATER REICH WORLD PRESS): Folks, the nation over are bent in laughter
at the latest
antics of the Turkish buffoons.  Their great explorers have successfully
found Siberia, the only area besides the Arctic Sea which doesn't border
a single supply
center!  ``At least we were able to move somewhere,"  pouted the Sultan.
Indeed.
With no opposition!

<p>
(BIE): But what about us?  We don't border on a single supply
center...that isn't already occupied!

<p>
(BRITAIN -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> SPAIN): The only move which fooled me was the order to Auv.
I'm still trying to reckon that one.

<p>
(P-W): Come on, I am not dead yet. I will bite you in the ankle. I will
never say die.

<p>
(VENICE):  And what about us?  We could be reduced to our core of home
dots, if
we don't put some effort (that we hardly have) into this struggle....

<p>
(JEFF to THE WORLD): I think it is completely disrespectful to refer
to me as Uncle Jeffy.
I'm more used to Uncle Jeffy Pooh, of if you're uncomfortable with 
that how about ``oh, great one''!
Speaking of which, I believe the Uncle Jeffy just helped Spain by
liberating it from its Colonial English occupation.

<p>
(THE GHOST OF FRANCE DEPARTED):  And as for us...who border upon not a
single center whatsoever!  Well, we have a postal concession stand in
China to brag about!

<p>
(BRITAIN -<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> EGYPT): Noble gesture on your part.

<p>
(EGYPT to POLLARD): Watch out for British/German convoys.

<p>
(BERLIN to FRENCH POLTERGEIST): If you had it to do over again, would
you STILL urge the Poles to build that second fleet?

<p>
(P-G): Again I apologize to Ukr for previous acts of aggression. It was
those bad Germans I needed to be wary of. O well.

<p>
(PRAIRIE PRINCE to ELF): Hi Eric. I'm still alive, trying to reintegrate into 
consensus society. I hope all is well with you, Cathy, and the kids. 

<p>
(NEW RUSSIAN PLAYER to WORLD): If I have taken over this position, you will all 
be hearing from me soon. Being a toady or puppet of a major power is not 
beneath my dignity. The name of the game here is SURVIVE! 

<p>
(JEFF to WHOEVER): Today's rhetorical question.
If a young couple in West Virginia get married and then get divorced
3 years later, are they still legally brother and sister?

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The BFJHR draw is rejected yet again. 
The BFJHR is reproposed, even though the GM hates it, since it doesn't say
or spell ANYTHING!
Working in the right direction, a BH draw is proposed too.
That we shall call.... the BlackHole draw!!
Please vote with your Winter orders.
Failure to vote vetoes everything as usual.

<p>
2) Harry is called to replace Luke.
I just got late word that Luke is resigning from all his games so
all standbys should take note that they are taking over the positions.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(HOLLAND):
The Dutch government celebrated the 4th of July by lobbing fireworks
into the Celebes Sea.  Aides tried to inform President Reagan
that the 4th of July was not actually a Dutch holiday, but rather
an American holiday, but he would hear none of it.  Dissenters
were called Communists and thrown into prison.

<p>
(F-BH): Gee, you both smell like fresh cut flowers!
<i>((No, no, no, the BlackHole will not let even fragrance escape!))</i>

<p>
(H - J): When Jim says you're at your summer address, does this mean
that you're not reading email?  We need to talk.

<p>
(F-J): Do you get email in summer I have had no response to a couple of
messages. I will actually write letters and use the post if need be.

<p>
(BOOB to FRANCE AND HOLLAND): His E-Mail does work, but....

<p>
(F-HB): Non semper erit sestas!

<p>
(DUTCH BASEBALL):
So, Red Sox fans, which of you predicted at the beginning of the year
that Mo Vaughn would not make the All-Star team, but Jose Offerman
would?  Let's hope the Orioles give up on '99 soon and look
to deal either B.J. Surhoff or Harold Baines.  
<i>((How's ya wanna bet that they make another useless run, just
like last year, just enough so that they don't break up the most
dysfunctional team in baseball.))</i>

<p>
1) With the large issue above, I didn't have time to get the EndGame
Chart together for this game.
It will have to wait, but in the meantime.... more press!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TURKEY-GERMANY): Congratulations.  I've said all I can say and 
must shut my mouth to the victor.

<p>
(BOOB to WEISS MAN): Ummmm, then what have we here??
I suppose your mouth may be shut, but your fingers aren't....

<p>
(WEISS - JONES): I hope we are on the same team for the CAT23 championships. 
Bigtime congratulations for the long battled win.

<p>
(WEISS - ZARR): And if this was one of your worst games, then how about you 
join in this team also.  Please?

<p>
(WEISS - FRANCE): I recognize that my entry into the game as a standby 
altered a lot of the dynamics.  I recognize that my early attempts at 
stirring the game up only alienated you from me and created my ultimate 
demise.  That is, after Austria and I blew our three chances for a win.

<p>
(WEISS - DAVIS): I accept total accountability for blowing the last free 
chance to win.  For that, I am so happy that you survived to the end.

<p>
(WEISS - ALL): I am very happy that this game was not ended by a draw vote.  
I'm much happier being a survivor under these circumstances and learning a 
lesson about early press, then to have been part of a 3-way draw.  I did 
find each of the years enjoyable, the press, the expressions, etc.
	
<p>
(WEISS - GM): Thank you for your house rules that allow such games to occur.

<p>
(BOOB to WEISS MAN): No problem at all, it really IS my pleasure, you know.
