<p><br><p><br>The 1999 Hobby Awards ballots are out, I printed one in the last issue.
I decided to mention it again here at the very top, so that it gets seen
by E-Mail subbers and gets put on the Internet via the <i>TAP</i> web page.

<p>
 The Hobby (or: Why I Did It) - Heath Gardner (<i>Naima Equinox</i>

<p>
<p><b>Koning Award</b> (player performance)

<p>
 Frank Easton, Jerry Falkiner, Kevin Kinsel, Frederic Townsend, Fred Wiedemeyer

<p>
<p>Voters are asked to sign their names legibly and return votes, contributions and 
comments to: Melinda Holley, 1823 Enslow Blvd., Huntington, WV  25701.  Ballots
will be accepted through Aug. 21. 1999.  The Committee also is soliciting $1
donations per vote to defray the costs of the awards themselves.  This is a voluntary
donation and including it or not including it does not affect the status of your
vote in any way.  The Committee hopes to keep awarding plaques, but with the
apparent demise of the PDORA Auction which was their main source of funds, they
may have to switch to something less expensive.  As the number of voters has been
declining in recent years, the Committee is requesting input as to whether the
awards should continue at all.

<p>
The Committee currently consists of Melinda Holley (Chairperson), Fred Davis (Treasurer),
Gary Behnen, Paul Kenny, and Robert Lesco.

<p>
- - -

<p>
I'm probably about to get myself in trouble, but hey, a little good honest 
controversy is good for the hobby and the soul.
I want to begin by thanking the Committee for lots of hard work over the years
and for asking for these kinds of comments with the ballot this year.
I hope this direct honesty is constructive and helpful.

<p>
Now my comments, prefaced by saying that I make them public in order to urge you
to VOTE and to make similar comments so that Melinda and the Committee hear this
clearly.
I most emphatically DO NOT believe that the Hobby Awards have outlived their 
usefulness or value.
I most emphatically DO believe that this has become something of an insider
process and that it is the PROCESS that is causing the decline in interest.
The player performance list of nominees shows the biggest problem on this
score.
I have nothing against any of the nominees, but for the last five years
the same people have been appearing on the list and all of them play in
the same small subset of the hobby's szines.
Until I recently pushed Fred into subscribing, only Paul Kenny was receiving
this szine among the Committee members. 
Gary Behnen is so ``retired'' that I didn't even know he was receiving any
Diplomacy szines any more.
I could go on, but I don't mean to impinge on anyone's sense of honor or
well-being.
I just mean to say that either the Committee needs to double in 
size (at least) to accomodate more people who see ALL of the aspects of 
the US/NA hobby, or it DOES need to disband so it can be reformed to properly
encompass the entire hobby.

<p>
What does that mean?

<p>
1) The hobby has gone global.
I interact at least as much with hobbyists in the UK, Australia, and the European
continent as those in North America.
I would vote that the Committee expand its focus to that world wide hobby.
I have Australian and British players in my szine, and players from here
are playing there.
Why?

<p>
2) The hobby has gone at least partially E-Mail.
I don't think that any new large szines are going to start any more that don't
also have a web presence.
I believe very strongly in having BOTH an E-Mail/Web presence and a postal
presence and there is NOTHING stopping people from easily doing both.
In that case, doesn't sticking with a sharply shrinking ``pure'' postal
hobby ring of a cultural elitism?
Why can't Berry Renken be eligible for these ballots??
It could be argued that his is the most popular North American szine
right now, and he lives in the Netherlands!!
Did the Committee know that Berry has been brilliantly GMing
some wild variants??
Why can't the <i>Diplomatic Pouch</i> be eligible??
Why can't the Masters of Judge games OR, perhaps closer in analogy, why
can't the Cat-23 GM's be eligible??
The Cat-23 GM's and their environment seems as close to a hotbed
of talented play and excellent GMing as exists today in the world.
Does the Committee even know who any of these people are??
They are where the hobby is at right now.

<p>
3) The hobby is actually LARGER now than it has been at any time in the
last 15 years, it also is more fragmented than it has ever been before
in the time I have watched it (since the mid to late 1970's).  That makes
it harder to do a good hobby awards structure, perhaps MUCH harder, but
it makes it even MORE essential!
I don't even think that this ballot covers the traditional North American
postal hobby very well.
Where are all those hot new players playing in Scott Morris' or
Tom Howell's szines??
I mention those two wondering if the Committee even considered those
szines and their players??
This is NOT an attempt to be self-serving, in fact I right here and
now will urge everyone to vote for Michael Lowrey for the Miller Award.
I will be doing so!!
The Orphan Service job has been languishing a bit recently and as I've
long claimed it is THE hardest job in the hobby.
Michael is attacking it with great energy!!

<p>
To sum up, I would prefer that these awards go world wide, at least in the
English speaking part of it (realizing that in itself is a bit of a bias)
and go ``all medium''.  At the least, I think it needs to be a TRUE US/NA
structure that includes the growing edges of the hobby.
In order to make that happen, the Committee needs YOUR votes and YOUR 
input.
I don't care if you agree with me or not, but I do think YOUR opinion
is valuable.
Go vote now, before you get caught up in your game below.
Thank you for your time.
I apologize for being a bit blunt, but I keep getting more and more
excited about how the hobby is growing and changing and more and more
bothered that some of my longest term colleagues and friends don't seem
to see it.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>THE NEXT TINAMOU DEADLINE WILL BE JULY 5, 1999</b>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Note the price increases for games, with the rates for subbing to the
szine holding fixed for the moment.
I'm not going to start any more new games (other than the Star Trek
game) until some games end.
The new game at that point probably will be another Modern game
with the ``Wing'' rule.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR ALAN STEWART</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>In keeping with usual practice, this first issue I will not tell you
precisely who Alan Stewart is, but I'd really like to find him.
He was one of the great writers this hobby has ever seen and I
think he would be interested in hearing how we all are doing.
Go find him.
Isn't the $50 worth it??

<p>
I claim the prize myself for finding Bernie Oaklyn Tretick.
I admit that I had an advantage since it actually turned out
that he is STILL living at the last address I had for him
about ten years ago.
His address is: Bernie Tretick, 9607 Conaty Circle, Spotsylvania,
VA  22553 and James Alan Tretick's address is 10511 Inwood Avenue,
Wheaton, MD  20902-3758.
I'm hoping to have comments from one or both for next issue.
It took me about 3 minutes to find both on the Internet, helped
by the aforementioned knowledge, but not by much.
Come on, you guys, go searching NOW!!!

<p>
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.
Go for these guys again.
Perhaps some of them now can be located via the Internet where they
weren't when you looked before.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<center><b>DIPDOM NEWS SECTION (with letters)</center><br></b>

<p>
<p> Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<p>
A VERY light discussion is taking place that will address what 
stance we (the hobby) should take (proactive in some way for sure) 
toward Hasbro, the new owners of the rights to Diplomacy.
More on this will be forthcoming, but it looks like Hasbro might
have its version of Diplomacy on the market for the Christmas
season and they actually will be employing ``play-testers''.
No word on precisely what this means yet, could it mean that
they will offer a series of ``official'' variants?
Stay tuned....
If you want to be part of the discussion, send the MESSAGE:

<p>
subscribe hasbro

<p>
to majordomo of diplom.org, it works just like the tap mailing list
described below.  Sending messages to hasbro of diplom.org
sends the mail to the whole list.
The big news this time is the beginning of the breakout of
Hasbro into official contact with the hobby.

<p>
<center>1999 World EMail Masters Diplomacy Tournament</center><br>

<p>
Fellow Diplomacy Player,
 
<p>
Please forgive this intrusion, but notification is going out to all 
Diplomacy mailing lists of this important landmark event in Internet 
Diplomacy. I am sure this will be of interest to all avid Diplomacy 
players. This is a single one-off mailing and will not be repeated. If 
you have been sent multiple copies of this note (or were already aware 
of this through a different mailing list) then please accept my 
apologies, it is possible you may have played Diplomacy in the past 
under different email addresses.

<p>
Entries for the 1999 World EMail Diplomacy Masters Championship are now 
open at:

<p>
http://worldmasters99.diplomacy.org.uk

<p>
The Cat23 International Tournament, which is the precursor to this 
Tournament is entering the end game. Currently the England Too and 
Vermont Group are running more or less neck and neck for the 
Championship. An indication of the calibre of competition has been the 
fact that the England Too team contained 7 of the top 15 ranked players 
in the UK (including a former World Champ, the current European Champ, 
and the UK No.1) and victory, if it comes,
will have been very hard won.

<p>
Plans have been underway for the next tournament. And its going to be 
bigger and better. The 1998 Tournament attracted 15 teams of 7 players 
from all corners of the globe including teams from England, USA, Canada, 
Sweden, Australasia, Europe and others from Diplomacy communities such 
as AOL, rec.games.diplomacy, The Old Republic, Vermont Group and others. 
There were 2 former World Champions (and the current one - eliminated 
early ;-) involved and a number of FTF players playing by email for the 
first time.This time around we are expecting strong teams from France, 
Compuserve, Toronto and many other areas as well as more teams from the 
established areas of England, Sweden &amp; the USA.

<p>
Because of the experience CAT23 people have with email tournaments, they 
decided to take the next step and working together with people from the 
FTF hobby, and several other groupings, we together have come up with 
the 1999 World Email Masters Diplomacy Tournament.

<p>
The Web Site is up and working, but still awaits a few finishing touches 
and a couple revisions. Other than that though, its ready to go and the 
publicity campaign for it, that began on Cat23 and Compuserve, is about 
to go into full swing. Individual and Team registrations can be made to 
the Conference Board immediately. Teams are already being formed and 
some individuals have started registering. The Conference Board gives 
you the opportunity to register and form teams (if you don't already 
have ideas for one of your own).

<p>
The site is at http://worldmasters99.diplomacy.org.uk. Visit now and 
read more about this exciting event!

<p>
This will give you basic info and link you to the Masters99 conference 
boards where the main tournament activity will take place. Feedback on 
this is very welcome. Boards of this nature, a bit like Bulletin Boards, 
provide an ideal forum for providing tournaments of this nature. The 
biggest problem with the 1998 tournament has been mailing lists! 15 
boards have generated over 2000 emails sent indiscriminately to all 
members of the list. The Boards enable people to select which discussion 
areas they would like messages from to be mailed to them (at a minimum 
the results &amp; chat lists for their own games) but still keep up with 
what is happening in the tournament by scanning other messages posted to 
other discussion areas.

<p>
Start thinking about forming your teams now. Teams must contain 7 
players and these 7 will each play one of the Great Powers. Although 
this tournament puts an emphasis on Team for this first round, it will 
also have an individual thread in it.

<p>
The top 49 players will go on to a playoff where the top 7 will sit at a 
championship board for the 1999 World EMail Masters Diplomacy Champion. 
Given the amount of interest in this tournament and a field of players 
that will exceed 200, perhaps even 300 or 400 - we just don't know - the 
winner will become the defacto Internet equivalent to the FTF World 
Champion. No self respecting Diplomacy player can afford to miss the 
opportunity to, in effect, become the first Internet World Masters 
Champion, after competition with top notch players from every corner of 
the Diplomacy world and from all diplomacy hobbies!

<p>
The games will be played to 1912 and the scoring will use a modified 
C-Diplo system that takes into account some of the special factors 
associated with email play.

<p>
If you get a few moments then please also complete the World Register of 
Diplomacy Players Survey Form at http://www.diplomacy.org.uk/survey.

<p>
Thank you for taking the time to read this mail. I look forward to 
crossing swords with you.

<p>

<center>Kindest Regards, Emeric Miszti, em of basingstoke.net</center><br>

<p>
<i>((At least one team from <i>TAP</i> will be entering this tournament,
mostly being organized from among the Arsenic and Old Farts game 
players.
I volunteered to GM and play for that team.
If anyone else in the <i>TAP</i> family would like my assistance in 
getting a team together, I would be pleased to assist you.))</i>

<b>Richard Weiss (Mon, 14 Jun 1999 11:28:32 PDT)</b>

<p>
Jim:  Another superb issue.  Congratulations.

<p>
Major kudos for your work over all of the years to bridge the snail mail 
hobby to the new electronic hobby, which as predicted, soon grew to dwarf 
the Daddy, as snail mail had, to some extent, over FTF.  The letters from 
Todd Hurley and Bill Levay are joyous peals to me.  Someone cares, someone 
appreciates, someone is going to market, someone is going to make money on 
- Dip.  Our favorite game.  Thank you Jim.  Thank you Hasbro.

<p>
If I learn anything new at the ``PlayersCon;; at Hunt Valley Inn (site
of the former AvalonCon), I'll pass the news on to others in the hobby.
That won't be until July 31st, however.
I've also written to Pitt Crandlemire re the status of <i>DW</i>, but he
hasn't replied yet.
And Larry Peery hasn't responded to my letter to him suggesting that
if he can't save all of the Hobby Archives, perhaps he could just save
the first and last issues of each zine, plus any key issues, and reduce
the size of the Archives to just two boxes.

<p>
So, it doesn't seem that much is happening in the hobby these days.
<i>(([seriously dumbfounded] How can you say that???
With the Hasbro business, thousands of Dip players with more joining
every week??))</i>
I did renew my sub to Michael Lowrey's <i>CCC</i>, after a lapse of nearly 
three years.
So many other zines have folded that I felt I could add one more to my list.
Thank goodness for <i>TAP</i>.
You've become the main source of information in the hobby.

<i>((Thank you, I appreciate the sentiment.
I should let you know that I really don't work at keeping the ``information
flow'' going as hard as I once did.
I used to print a LOT of E-Mail news, but found that the E-Mail subbers that
I have (and I have about 200 of them) are nearly silent and seem to get their
E-Mail news elsewhere.
I've always hated covering hobby news, but to convince the skeptics that
there is ``action'' out there, I'm going to try to do more of it.... starting
with the above announcement.))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br>
<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>It is still time to send in your ``best of 1998'' lists.
Give it to me anyway you want to - a top 10, a couple of favorites,
a list, an essay, whatever - the classic is to tell me your top
singles, top albums, and best concerts of the year, but you are the
boss.
Don't wait too long though because I want to move into the party tape
issues pretty quickly.
Well, let's go to Part II of the lists:

<p>
<p><br>
<center><b>JIM-BOB'S BEST OF 1998 - PART II!!!!</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>After the Top 10, I'll discuss other notable 1998 releases by genre.
Here is one of those categories.
I'll try to get more of this in next issue.... we're dragging here!!

<p>
<p> <b>Best Movie Soundtracks of the Year</b>

<p>
Part of this category essentially could be top singles of the year, since are there
any great singles these days that don't show up on movie soundtracks??  And this
doesn't even count Celine Dion....
Two of the most engaging singles of the year were Propellerheads' ``History Repeating
(Featuring Miss Shirley Bassey)'' and ``Everything Shines'' by the Push Stars.
The soundtrack that they both appeared on WAS the my favorite one of the year, 
especially since it also featured Mr. Jonathan Richman.
Yes, we are talking about <i>There's Something About Mary</i> (Capitol -
http://www.aboutmary.com).
There simply is not a single dog of a song anywhere on here.
About two-thirds of the songs are new releases and the other third are older songs,
but they blend beautifully.
You'd swear that Gary Clark wrote ``Mary's Prayer'' just for this movie, but
of course Danny Wilson recorded it for Virgin 12 years ago!
Lloyd Cole is an underrecognized name, but his sensitive ``Margo's Waltz''
is the brilliant ``slow dance'' song on this CD.
Then for people like me, who REALLY latched onto popular music in 1979,
Joe Jackson is one of the great touchstones.
``Is She Really Going Out With Him'' is another no-brainer winner for this
soundtrack about chasing after Cameron Diaz.
Ben Lee's ``How To Survive a Broken Heart'' was a big surprise for me and
you didn't hear it much on the radio, but you should have.
I've not heard anything else of his, but I want to hunt him down.
The one song that didn't seem to fit with the flow of the soundtrack to me
was Zuba's ``Speed Queen'', although it is a really fine song.
The soundtrack finishes up with a bang, doing ``Build Me Up Buttercup'',
performed by The Foundations.
POW, right between the eyes.

<p>
Now, let's speak of Jonathan.
General awareness of Jonathan Richman continues to rise on the backs of 
the Farrelly Brothers as they continue to employ his quirky songs in 
their movies.
``Let Her Go Into the Darkness'' and ``True Love Is Not Nice'' were
absolutely perfect choices and the title track is another of Jonathan's 
subtle boppers.
Having Jonathan and Tommy Larkins (his longtime drummer) show up at every
turn in the movie was hilarious.
Last year I spoke of the packed Jonathan Richman concert I went to, after
years of seeing him play only to us long-term dedicated fans.
It was one of my favorite concerts of the year.
If you liked this soundtrack and Jonathan's appearance in the movie,
go check out his latest or one of his numerous Rounder releases!!

<p>
I bought this next soundtrack in 1998, though I notice it is copyrighted
for 1997.
I haven't liked most of Adam Sandler's movies, finding <i>The Waterboy</i>
nearly unwatchable (despite some brilliant supporting performances), but
I absolutely adored <i>The Wedding Singer</i>!!!
At least some of it must be a winning performance by Drew Barrymore
and the characters in the supporting cast.
Adam Sandler does do a great job of putting together people you wouldn't
expect to appear in his movies.
And for any New Wave oriented music fan, the soundtrack is a killer.
The CD leads off with The Presidents of the United States of America and their
version ``Video Killed the Radio Star'', one of the songs that was played over
the credits in the movie.
The Buggles original is one of my favorite all-time songs, and I hated the
Presidents' version when I heard it in the movie theatre.
BUT, after buying the soundtrack and hearing it repeated times, this version
has grown on me and I enjoy it too!!
No better song is out there to capture some of the major changes in music
through the period when this movie is set.
The list of Culture Club, The Police, The Smiths, Psychedelic Furs, The 
Thompson Twins, Elvis Costello, David Bowie, and New Order cannot be topped
as a representation of the pop wedding songs of the period.
AND that doesn't even count Billy Idol's ``White Wedding'' and Billy's
hilarious part in the movie!!
Billy traditionally did many versions of his singles and the ``White 
Wedding'' version used here is sharp and crisp, but not the killer dance
track version that made the rounds in the summer of 1982!!!

<p>
The Psychedelic Furs are woefully underrecognized, in my opinion, as they
have an extremely strong body of consistent work (at least five albums worth).
``Love My Way'' is not one of their best known songs and so is perfect for
this soundtrack.
On the other hand, I am not a Thompson Twins fan at all, but ``Hold Me Now''
works very well as a bridge between Richard Butler and Elvis Costello.
I thought I would skip over this song on the CD when I played it, but I don't!
For a movie about a Wedding Singer doing dance songs, the soundtrack emphasizes
more of the romance rather than the great party singles.
``Everyday I Write the Book'' is a gorgeous song that you almost could have
sworn must have been written twenty years before 1983, but it is far, far
from Declan's best dance song.
``China Girl'' is one of my favorite Bowie songs from a relatively dry era
for him - at least partly due to the collaboration with Iggy Pop, no doubt.
I also MUST mention ``Blue Monday'' or Drew James will be sure to comment
(see an interesting discussion between us down below).
Now, ``Blue Monday'' probably is mixed to be nearly the best dance song
on the soundtrack.
Like most New Order songs, it really kicks!
And then ``Pass the Dutchie'', while a great song, seems not to quite be
from the same soundtrack.
Still, even Adam Sandler's silly ``Somebody Kill Me'' goes on just long enough.

<center>***TIME TO VOTE***</center><br>

<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
I'm going to set a slate of only 10 - that's just ONE more from
what is below and then DEMAND votes from you out there to
fill the rest of the slots.
The Bullpen voting system I am envisioning will work like this:
you each get ten votes which you can allocate across as few as
two songs (5 votes apiece) or as many as ten songs (1 vote for each).
You can allocate your ten votes any way you want, but you can't put
any more than five votes on any one song.
You also get ONE B-52 song vote (although you can add votes from your
main allotment if desired) and THREE Drug Song votes which will be
held in a separate category.
The other ``special'' bullpens must be voted on from your main allotment
of votes.
I decided that I WILL print running totals and print the names of the
people who have voted.
Also, you guys wrote some great stuff about the songs, so I've printed
that too!
Write-ins will be permitted, but are unlikely to win.
I know I have lost some suggestions that aren't in the bullpen lists
below, so feel free to mention 'em again!
Everything that started in the bullpen started with one vote.

<p>
To encourage voting early, five voters at random will receive five US
dollars from me (either in cash or paid to someone for Dip stuff).
I will take these voters at random every other issue, starting with
this issue, and draw one randomly, so early voters get FIVE chances
to win, but no one will be allowed to win twice.
I'm also giving the round one voters below five chances in said drawing,
those in the second round four, and so on, to more heavily penalize the
chances of those last minute voters and reward these pioneers!
That should do it!!
Since this issue is monstrous, I am pushing back my voters to next 
issue and my prize awards likewise.
Prizes will be awarded in issues 222 and 224.
Get your Round 4 votes in now if you don't see your name below!!!
You each will receive two chances in the drawing for the next 
five dollar prize. 
Voters in Round 1 were Mike Barno($5), Rick Desper ($5), Tony Dickinson,
Drew James, Heath Gardner, and John Harrington.
Round 2 postal voters are John Schultz ($5) Ian Moore, and Stan Johnson.
In future drawings these people will
have five chances, just as the Round 1 voters.
Round 2 E-Mail voters get four chances and are Scott Morris, 
Warren Goesle, Peter Sullivan, and Michael Lowrey.
Round 3 voters are Dick Martin, Richard Weiss, and Rip Gooch;
they get three chances to win.
There are 60 chances up for grabs.... and
Rick Desper wins this issue's prize.
Since he is in Germany, he may find it useful.
Let me know if you want me to send any money to someone here in the US!!
I'll pay out all of the awards at the end, but if you need me to send
anyone money, just speak up.

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's

New York''; something from the B-52's;

jimbob -
better send these in before i forget them...
drug votes - ``love is the drug" by roxy music, 3 votes (you
go into the corner &amp; do your thing...i'll do mine)
<i>((I love that song, I'm tempted to push it myself!!))</i>
b52s vote - ``love shack", 1 vote
others - 1 vote each to: ``smells like teen spirit", ``twistin
the night away", ``shake, rattle &amp; roll", ``jambalaya",
``want-ad blues", ``locomotion", ``party at ground zero", ``our
lips are sealed", ``twist &amp; shout" and ``bring tha noiz"
(while hoping that jimbob uses his executive privilege for
``what i like about you" and ``i feel good")
<i>((Since you let me beat you up in Caruso Baseball, 
and because I really want those two to win, I've slipped
you the extra votes.))</i>
some might win, some will not - but i'd take any of these
tunes onto the dance floor anytime.
i'm not familiar with the gershwin pick, but it seems a bit
on the languid side for good party music.  
<i>((Really NOT, you haven't heard this great version yet,
methinks.))</i>
that version of
``gloria" though....i heard it on the radio just the other
day &amp; it sounded so anemic 
<i>((I've got a few versions, and there is one that is
just dynamite..... though, I also love that U2 song....
you're makin' me think....))</i>
- give me the u2 or patti smith
versions anyday (or ``brown eyed girl" if you just want a van
song).  i also must confess that buster poindexter doesn't
do anything for me.  but as my old friend rod walker used to
say all the time, ``de gustibus non es dispudandum."  the
anthraxified version of ``bring the noise" makes the original
sound like ``happy birthday" - i think it was on pe's
apocalypse 91 cd but i don't remember offhand.
i've burned a cd for you with a few of the nominees that you
might not be familiar with, as well as a bunch of other
stuff.  right now i can only do cd-<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
>cd copies, which isn't
very useful. looks like i might have to upgrade my windoze
machine to be able to copy from analog sources.  sigh! 
course...if i do that i'll be able to play quake ii...moan! 
can't send the cd via email so i'll fling it off when i get
a mailer for it.

<p>

<center>Dick, MARTINR of NDU.EDU</center><br>

<i>((I've got it and see what you mean about the Anthrax 
additions!!
Wow!
Not my cup of tea, but I readily admit its power.
Thank you VERY much for the CD.))</i>

Jim: You are a great conversationalist - animated, interested, conversant, 
with value to add.  Good to see you again.

<p>
Voting on the millenium CD:
My ego would like some recognition on the tape info for suggesting the 
drug bullpen and putting together the first entrants.  After voting ``NONE" 
to the B-52's however, I might be banned forever.
<i>((No, I can take some revolts in the ranks.))</i>
As reported earlier, or even twice, I went to see the B-52's and the 
Pretenders last year, never dreaming that the B's were the final act, the 
bigger enchilada.  I left partway through.  Boring.  Bad,  alternative 
before their time.  Heavy and bubble gum at the same time.  Although, I have 
had fun at a love shack to love shack.
<i>((Everyone's got an opinion....))</i>
	
<p>
Lilith Fair is playing here in July with Cheryl Crow, Sarah McLachlan and 
the PRETENDERS so I may be standing in line Sunday morning to get good seats 
to see my heart/ear throb sing again - Chrissie Hynde.  Matter of fact, time 
to put it on the speakers.  Maybe they will even play acoustic again.
<i>((``Brass in Pocket'' by the Pretenders has always been MY favorite
dance song of theirs.
In your honor, I have added that to the list.))</i>
   
<p>
RC Weiss Drug Bullpen:  The Toys - Smoke Two Joints (still played every 
Friday at 5 PM on KFOG in SF.  Twice the Toys have been in the studios and 
played it acoustically live.  One vote.  UB40 ``Red, Red Wine" - 1 vote.  
Clapton and ``Cocaine" 1 vote.  Breaks my heart to bypass the Dead and Casey, 
but I don't think I ever danced to this at a party.
<i>((I've been feeling like I probably will add just the top
song (maybe two) from this list and use it as the ``break'' song
that can make everything else seem better.
We'll see.
If ``Love Is the Drug'' wins, that is a GREAT party song, bar none.))</i>

<p>
Regular Bullpen:  2 votes for Strunz and Farrah ``americas" - the most 
phenomenal jazz song of all time!!  One vote each for the amazing Talking 
Heads songs from my favorite sound track and concert-movie:  ``Take me to the 
River" and ``Life During Wartime."  I don't think there was a house party 
with music and dancing during the 1980's from release that didn't include 
these songs, or even the entire ``Stop making Sense" CD.  Because it brought 
people to the floor and kept them there, sweating.  And I was occasionally 
in the corner.  Go Charlotte!

<p>
1 for ``Louie, Louie.  C'mon.  You danced to that over a hundred times and 
so did I.  
<i>((Nope, not me.... perhaps it's because we're slightly different 
generations.
I'll admit things like that about ``Brick House'', which I've been hoping
no one would mention for the list.
Still, it's a legitimate song, and a legitimate vote.))</i>
We can't rewrite history now.  1 for ``One Love" by Bob Marley.  A 
different kind of dance tune, but obligatory for parties and brought out 
lots of dancers.  1 for the Doors' ``Roadhouse Blues."  Before I danced at 
parties I danced in my room, and Roadhouse Blues was one of those songs I 
loved and helped me learn rhythmn and dancing.
	
<p>
Of the Stones work, I'd say ``Bitch'', ``Brown Sugar'' and ``I met a ginsoaked 
bar-room queen in Memphis" were the songs my friends most danced to at 
parties.  However, the others had some moments and are worth nostalgic 
memories.  I don't remember the Beatles songs being popular dance music 
after the very early twist songs and doubt many other of your readers 
actually go back THAT far.
<i>((I remember the period in the 1970's before disco when those
Beatles songs were still popular at parties.
This went with the Supremes and all the other great 60's music very well.))</i>
	
<p>
I'm very tempted to chide the readership and myself for not having 
nominated more DISCO, RAVE, TECHNO, INDUSTRIAL songs.  But, in choosing one 
to vote for (a precondition to my nominating a write-in) I will vote 1 for 
Ini Kamoze and ``Here Comes the Hotstepper." 
<i>((I kept wanting to do so myself, but I had much more trouble
deciding which songs to take.
I keep hoping I'll get more votes.
Here's a promise, any ``good'' (defined by me) songs in those genres 
proposed, including this one, get two extra votes from me.
That'll help anyone sitting on the sidelines because they
have songs of those types on their list, so don't feel like voting.))</i>
My last vote is also to be 
wasted on a late-addition write in, but I can't resist voting for the 
hottest and brightest female blues artist currently performing, Susan 
Tedeschi, and while ``rock my right" fulfills are prerequisites, I'd rather 
dance to ``it hurt so bad."  I'll be seeing her in a winery next month, and 
if the place isn't dancing by then, they'd better watching out for me to 
karaoke dance.  
<i>((I'll give you an extra vote for that too!))</i>
Which leaves Hot Chocolate's ``You sexy thing" out of 
nomination and also ``Brick House."

<p>

<center>Richard, rcw23 of hotmail.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Ugh, I swear I wasn't looking at the bottom of your letter when I
wrote the note a couple of paragraphs up....
oh, I'm shamed.
I'll give each of those one vote...
but that's all, unless someone else chimes in.
You know, I have to admit that I can't even remember who did ``Brick House''!
Someone want to enlighten a couple of senile old dancers?))</i>

Jim,

<p>
I just bought the new Electronic album.  Too bad it is only available as an
import in North America as I think it is the best of the three Electronic
releases. It just makes me yearn for New Order.  I also see that there is a
new Joy Division release out of a live show.   I don't plan to pick it up I
can't believe there is anything new on it.

<p>
OK I am going to say it.  You recommended that I try <i>Fear and Whiskey</i> as my
first Mekons' album.  Although I have tried real hard, I haven't really
enjoyed it.  It is good song writing, but I find it sort of dull.    I
understand that they have changed their styles several times over the years.
Is there another album by them which I should try.  Every other disk I have
picked up from your recommendations have been excellent so I want to give it
another shot.

<p>

<p>
<i>((Drew, I want to give you a very long answer to this question.
I look at the clock and don't have time.

Jim:

<p>
Well, England has made an unfortunate exit from the
cricket World Cup due to an extraordinary performance
by Zimbabwe (whodathunk?) and general lacklustre play.
So that kills one possibility for further
correspondence! Unless, of course, someone wants to
start a debate on the state of English cricket which
will mean nothing whatsoever to a large chunk of your
readership. Don't worry - I'm too demoralised to
start anything myself ... And don't talk to me about
baseball. The Jays line up a dazzling roster then
proceed to show the rest of us how to under-achieve.
How frustrating. At least Surrey CCC is winning (back
to cricket again - must stop mixing my sports). 
Incidentally, wasn't history's most significant
sportsman a certain young black fellow who wiped the
smile off Hitler's face in 1938? He'd receive every
one of my votes in a poll.
<i>((Australia won, I believe, beating Pakistan in
the final!!
The incredible reaction of the Pakistani's was quite
frightening.
I guess cricket ***MUST*** be important.))</i>

<p>
Talking (or writing, if you're as pedantic as I
suspect you are) of polls, perhaps I should formalise
my approach to your music feature. If I understand the
voting system (we Brits have such difficulty with the
Bullpen concept), I can submit the following without
being sent off for an early bath (a rugger expression).

<p>
My B-52s vote goes to Rock Lobster entirely thanks to
the fact that the appalling Love Shack video is played
incessantly on Much More Music. If memory serves, Rock
Lobster actually did rather better than Shack in the UK
first time around.

<p>
Dope Heads should call upon Red Red Wine (the UB40
version with its faux-Reggae beat always reminds me of
a swelteringly hot vacation in Benidorm - long story).
The original by someone whose name temporarily escapes
me is far better, but I don't want to shake up the
bullpen at this stage.
Then perhaps Golden Brown by The Stranglers. Anything 
with a rasping bass-line and a somnambulistic vocal
fits the bill.
Third - and this is a long shot - Cars Hiss By My
Window from LA Woman by The Doors. This was the
ultimate relaxation in the early 70s. Accompanying the
very best Paki Black that Southampton Docks could
provide, this track seemed to go on forever!

<p>
Now for the main voting. I'll dip into the Talking
Heads Bullpen to remind you of Psycho Killer. A superb
you-can-all-join-in track. Definitely worth one of my
precious votes.
Nine more to come, each with one vote, and including a
few additions to the Bullpen just to stir things up
because I'm awkward.
<i>((You got a bonus vote for a good choice....))</i>

<p>
Mannish Boy by Muddy Waters. Sublime - the true roots
of r&amp;b and r&amp;r in one record. Such feeling.
Radar Love by Golden Earring. I recall this as the
one where the drummer vaulted over his kit at the
moment of climax. Very Freudian. The local pub-rock
band The Poor Boys (www.poor-boys.com) whose guitarist
is a personal friend does a note-perfect rendition.
Sadly, the drummer cannot be persuaded to perform the
special feat.
Crossroads by Eric Clapton. Preferably the live version
but any of the studio ones will do. Cream was a special
favourite of mine way back when. Disraeli Gears is 
near the top of my all-time list.
Whip It by Devo. Thanks to the Bullpen for this. I'd
forgotten all about it! A magical song.
Proud Mary by Ike &amp; Tina Turner. No comment required.
Have you heard the Brian Wilson versions? Different!!
Roadrunner by Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers.
Singalong stuff. I've played this at numerous parties
myself. Never fails.
<i>((Yeah, and earned a bonus vote, 'cause I'm trying
to push it.))</i>
Three more to go, and I don't much fancy any of the
other offerings. So, here are my additions. No chance
for inclusion, but they might jog a few memories ...
Suffragette City by David Bowie. A guaranteed floor-
filler back in my DJing days in the early 70s.
Wham Bam Thank You Man!!!
<i>((Also a bonus vote...))</i>
Ballroom Blitz by The Sweet. What, no Sweet in the
ultimate dance collection? Shame on you!! 
One from elsewhere. Put on Hi Ho Silver Lining by
Jeff Beck at ANY dance in the UK and you'll instantly
have a crowded dance floor. Fists punching the air to
the chorus. The ultimate cliche singalong, almost a
caricature these days. Separates the youngsters from
us Old Fogies. The Poor Boys hadn't heard of it, so
it seems to have never put in an appearance in the US.
Maybe its time has passed, but it would be interesting 
to hear anyone else's views. I can guarantee that 100
of your British readers will know of it - though they
might be reluctant to admit it!!
<i>((Two good songs to be sure, but not worth
extra votes from me.
I'd totally forgotten about the Beck.
I used to play that on my alternative radio shows
in college.))</i>

<p>
No Rolling Stones, I'm afraid. Couldn't choose between
Honky Tonk Woman, Brown Sugar and Street Fighting Man.
Also, no Queen on the list. Surprising, given both
their anthems and their early high-volume high-speed
rockers. Flick Of The Wrist. I'd nominate lots more
if I had the chance. Deep Purple, Steve Miller (Livin'
In The USA, Overdrive etc.), James Gang with Joe Walsh.
How's about Rocky Mountain Way or Life's Been Good?

<p>
Must stop. I'm getting into a groove and I have other
things to do. More soon.

<p>
Felt like writing - and yours is the first address on my list!

<p>
I am amused, but not the slightest bit surprised, to read somewhere
that the title of the latest Austin Powers film is causing some
difficulties. A relatively harmless word to Americans has been bleeped
on radio in the UK where ``shagged" is a crude euphemism not normally
used in polite company. It will be interesting to discover whether
prudish Brits or persuasive Yanks will win this particular battle. In
this part of Canada, the word ``shag" has found a uniquely localised
meaning. Sheer laziness has combined the words stag and hen to denote a
combined pre-nuptial stag night and hen party. I must admit to being
nonplussed the first time I saw the word in print in the local
newspaper, although I am familiar with the similarly-named sixties
dance craze.

<p>
<i>((They've announced that it will be publicized in Britain and
many other English countries as ``Austin Powers II"....))</i>

<p>
The Austin Powers controversy reminds me of the amusing instance of the
naming of a new Monkees' single. In search of a title from the
unpromising lyrics, the English David Jones suggested - with tongue
firmly in cheek - ``Randy Scouse Git". A phrase familiar to Brits due to
its frequent uttering by Alf Garnett in 'Til Death Do Us Part, and
highly offensive to Liverpudlians, it was meaningless to Americans. The
American version of 'Til Death starring the fabulous Archie Bunker was
bland in comparison. Before David's protests could be registered, the
title was approved and the single actually appeared under this name in
the States. Only when a distribution date was sought in the UK was the
offensive nature of the title noted. In the UK and elsewhere in the
English-speaking world, the single was re-named ``Alternate Title", and
it did rather well. The Rhino boxed set reverts to the American title
but, if memory serves, no reference is made to its origin.

<p>
On the question of word meanings, I have noticed that misguided
attempts are being made to introduce the word ``bugger" into everyday
American English. The word will have been noted in the speech of
certain individuals who attended public (American private equivalent)
schools where fagging, beating and homosexual activity were, allegedly,
par for the course. The noun is generally mild when used as an epithet
for a fool (``silly bugger"), but there is a narrow dividing line over
which one can step unawares into its more literal meaning as a verb.
I've noticed the word ``buggerer" being used in some places. This word
has only one possible meaning, and it is decidedly offensive if applied
to a Brit whose sexual orientation may be in question.

<p>
I went to the Montalvo Mountain Winery in Saratoga CA Friday night.  Up on 
a hill, overlooking Silicon Valley, very toney town, a small bowl of a venue 
with the immediate backdrop a 150 year old wineray/monastery covered with 
ivory (used as the backroom for the bands) and behind that another 200 feet 
of hill.  Imagine one-half of a high school gymnasium without walls or 
ceilings as the size and shape of the venue, including the bleachers 
perpendicular to the floor seats.  Total seating a little over 1,000.  I'd 
never been to this, or heard of it, but they and two other of their venues 
have seasonal series of great performers.  Somehow the day I called, 4th 
row, center had returned his/her tickets for that show and they were mine.  
Angela Strehli opened.  Typical.  Female singer.  Band can't boogie enough.  
Her new guitar player slightly off in rhythm and notes on solos.  My date is 
very impressed and says that she can't imagine the next act being any 
better.  Wrong.
	
<p>
Buddy Guy is always better.  His performances are always within the top 
3/handful of performers.  Same band as over the past few years (can't vouch 
for the bass player).  Tore the place up.  Wandered around the audience.  
Imitated guitarists the audience called out.  Then got bored and said he 
could play ``Buddy Guy" also, and did.  Wow.  Found out that the Allman 
Brother Band performances out here in August will have Susan Tedeschi 
opening.  I'm going.  Saw the Bros right before they became famous, college 
homecoming, all night wonderfulness.  Then maybe some festival and then last 
year in a small venue - played each note note for note, boring.  But, Susan, 
I'll go for her.  And radio rumor is that Double Trouble is now part of her 
backup band.  Hmmm.

<p>
Jim,
Canada versus the US playing rugby?! Oookay. I'll
watch it but I'll not believe it ;-)

<p>
How's about starting a debate drawing parallels between
baseball and cricket? I've noticed some similarities,
especially now that the batsman's stance is
increasingly that of a baseball batter (bat held high
rather than tapping the crease). If McGwire is Botham
(power, technique, consistency), does that make
Fernandez the equal of Lara or Gower? 

<p>
I just watched the most amazing semi-final match
between Australia and South Africa. I can't wait to
show the video to the local skeptics. ``Everything stops
for tea" indeed!

<p>
Best of 1998? I can tell you what I bought. Imagination
by Brian Wilson (sublime harmonies - up to 64
vocal tracks
all by Brian, thoughtful lyrics, no fillers. I wish I
could see him in concert. See A&amp;E on Sunday!).
Best of Bruce and Terry (on Sundazed. The ultimate
hot-rod duo. Bruce Johnston and Terry Melcher also
recorded under various names. Relive the sixties.)
Robbie Williams 2 CDs. (Listen to The Ego Has Landed,
the US/Canadian two-fer recently released. Stunning 
stuff. And what a performer!). Up by R.E.M. (Make up
your own mind. I've read the reviews ... ).

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>Breaking Away is almost full for the next opening, see the sign-up 
list discussion under the game below.
This game will appear in David Partridge's subszine <i>Tinamou</i>.
See the subszine for more details.

<p>
The only Diplomacy oriented opening left is an opening for a game of 
Star Trek Diplomacy!
This will be the last Diplomacy game opening until a game or two ends.
Even though there has been no interest yet, perhaps some will develop
if it is my only opening.
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
No interest in this game?
I really want to run this.
I guess I gotta work on my map and publish it.

<p>
I suppose I have to admit that no one is requesting <i>Pontevedria</i>,
the North American game opening flyer, from Conrad von Metzke any more.
You can contact Conrad by E-Mail at metzke of san.rr.com if you want to
ask him about it.
I'd be pleased to help anyone find other game openings on a personal
basis too.
The longer run solution might come out of the efforts of the Brits,
on which we might be able to piggyback.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Some more reminders that the small maps that are floating around
incorrectly have IFNI and TAUREG touching, but really SAHARA should
be touching MOROCCO, making it impossible for IFNI and TAUREG to touch.
I doubt I blew any adjudications this time, since no one challenged
anyone else directly, but please check.
I think I got all of the coasts correct, but try to remember to mark
them in your orders.

<p>
2) Thanks for the explosion of press!
It is a bit surprising, but welcome.

<p>
3) Since many of you were in Doug Kent's game, I should note that 
Michael Lowrey has received information from Doug Kent and is 
preparing to restart the game, probably with himself as GM.
You should hear from Michael in the near future.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(O-A): Have no fear, have no fear, you will be killed right away.

<p>
(MADRID - PARIS): You never answered my e-mail. Perhaps there's an ISP
problem or something? When you get this, please drop me a line, we need to
talk.

<p>
(VERSAILLES): With a strong fascist element and government to the north of 
France and the allied tyrants to the south, the fate of France's monarchy
is in peril.
To be able to build a large army and navy King Nicolas has decided to send
as many troops abroad and recruit more troops from the local populations.
French troops are on the move all across the globe.
The primary goal of the French is to establish a strong foothold and 
defense in both the New World and on the Black Continent.
After communities are started and the economy improves then French
culture will be introduced to the native population.
Many of the tribes around Quebec are already adapting to the French
Language.
The natives of the Cote d'or region are a bit more stubborn about change.

<p>
(LONDON ENQUIRER): The Saxons Uniting the Countries of Mother Earth party won
parliamentary elections yesterday and announced that they would begin
immediately their policy of uniting the world under English rule.  ``It's
become obvious to the English people that no one else is responsible enough
to rule themselves"  stated new PM Richard Longfellow.  ``Look at the
travesty in the Netherlands.  Sure, I'd like to party with Mr. Prink, but to
let him run a country ..."

<p>
(MADRID - LISBON: I have avoided the ``No-Man's-Land" of central Iberia, as
we discussed. Let's keep talking about how to further stabilize this region.
<i>((Looks like someone forgot to speak to France....))</i>

<p>
(MONTREAL): The Marquis Marcel LaSalle and his partner Louis Marceau are
making plans to explore the interior of Neuvaux France and Establish trade
routes and colonies all along the great LaSalle river that runs from the 
thousand Lakes Region south to the Gulf of Mexico.
It has been proposed to name the Missouri wilderness after both partners.
Since the River that borders the region bears LaSalle's name, the new
wilderness may become the Great Marcel - Marceau wilderness, but so far none
of the other world powers will change their maps to the new name.
They won't even discuss it, it is not a preposterous idea but so far the
topic is a mute point.

<p>
(MOSCOW to PEKING): See?  There are greener pastures out there, and
they're a LOT warmer, too!

<p>
(KIEV to OTTOMAN): Best to shoot for the ``sure things" first, and pick on
the nearest
big guy thereafter.  Remember, you're getting lots bigger just as fast
as they are....

<p>
(MADRID - VIENNA): As much as I would like to have Naples, I may as well
just let you take it. I'm such a nice guy.

<p>
(CAPE TOWN): A safari to the Natal was launched recently, loaded
primarily with
tubs of months-old caviar.  The aim is to dump these into the Somali
Sea, attracting
vast numbers of great white sharks to the area.  Hopefully, this will
discourage
any would-be sailors from Spanish Somalia from venturing into that space
(and will reassure those fellows that WE have no ambitions there
either)!

<p>
(MONGOLIA): Plans were finalized today to create a vast cemetery in the
region known as Manchuria.  If anyone tries to stop us from taking over
that area, the
burial grounds will fill up all the sooner....

<p>
(NETHERLANDS):
Sir Earl Prink announces that he is frustrated that he cannot get an email
through to the English Prime Minister. ``we wish PIECE! but we can't get our
last minutes fears through to the English!  Our move in Africa is defensive.''

<p>
Prink also announces that he agrees with the Ottoman ambassador and wishes to
talk further.

<p>
The NIKE party has agreed to a joint operation with the Russians. It is our
fondest hope that whatever Prink signed on that night filled with vodka and
loose woman was in the best interests of the Netherlands.  Prink's memory is
hazy but he remembers seeing an Austrian behind the curtain.  He hopes it was
just an alcohol induced vision.             

<p>
(THE KREMLIN): In the hope of reaching out to his beloved subjects
throughout the expanse
of Mother Russia, the Tsar has granted a one-time right for a free press
to be
created; this is for the sole purpose of an interview with Tsar Paul
Romanov on
whatever topics seem to interest the Russian people.

<p>
(THE INTERVIEW):
  
<p>
Q.     Greetings, oh Holy Tsar!  For the sake of this interview, may I
call you Paul?

<p>
A.     My wife the Empress of  All the Russias does not call me
``Paul."  You will
content yourself with the simple honorific ``My Lord".  Remember that I
will not
countenance impertinence:  with a word, I can have you cheerfully
strangled.

<p>
Q.     As you will, my Lord.  The world outside of the borders of
Russia seems to
be an increasingly turbulent place.  What is your view of the situation?

<p>
A.    Most of the trouble seems to arise in the rivalries of petty
States and Principalities.  They fight over the same turf, generation
after generation.  In order
to bring peace to those areas, it is necessary for larger Empires to
occupy them and to keep a watchful eye on the locals.  If they are to
continue slaughtering one another, it must be under the auspices of our
mandates.

<p>
Q.    Unprecedented wisdom, my lord!  Where would this process be
initiated?

<p>
A.   In areas adjacent to the Russian Empire, of course.  It is our
fervent wish to
prevent the spillover of those local squabbles into our own land; we
have sufficient petty jealousies of our own to contend with.

<p>
Q.  The people of Russia are united in their curiosity about your
daughter in law,
Catherine of Holstein.    What can you tell us about her?

<p>
A.  The sow is appropriately from a principality of a cow's name;  many
contend that she is attempting to mate with cows and horses to satisfy
her obsession with the size of their members.  Perhaps that accounts for
her many miscarriages and false
pregnancies.

(<i>The Prince</i> p. 56) Which qualities do you represent?

<p>
(TURKISH CAPTAIN to RUSSIAN LANDLUBBERS): Do not be alarmed, good people. We
only mean to slaughter your men, rape your women and enslave your
children.  Or any combination of the afore mentioned. We are not picky.
Children DO make better slaves, though. Their little hands are better at
cleaning intricate machinery in our factories. And when a hand gets ripped
off by a drive belt or stuck in the gears, the soft bones merely get
turned into mush and don't clog the works up like an adults. Their
whimperings also tend to be more musical in nature. Nothing beats falling
asleep to the sniffling and whimpering of thuroughly flogged, one-handed
slave child. 

<p>
(FRANCE'S LEADING CITIZEN THE MARQUIS DE SADE to WORLD): Please read my
latest quote which may be found in the press for ``Show Me the Money". 
It answers the eternal question of why we French must say bad things about
other people. Ah sweet pleasure...

<p>
(TURKISH AMBASSADOR to WORLD): AHEM!! Our most sincere apologies for the not
quite accurate rantings of some of our lower-bred seafaring brothers. We
Would NEVER slaughter, rape and enslavement in any hodge-podge order. We
SLAUGHTER men, RAPE women and ENSLAVE children. At least that's how the
current governing class view such things....

<p><br><p><br> <p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Richard Weiss apparently has changed his E-Mail.
He may be a bit hard to find in the near future, just warning
everyone.

<p>
2) People seemed to get all excited about ``nuking'' the GM, both 
literally and figuratively.
I remind everyone that there is perpetual ``open season'' on the GM
and I require you to abuse me, so I get to join in the fun, 
if you intend to abuse any other player.
Lots of people are earning lots of abuse points in this game!
I say, go for it!!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GER-BOOB): How about a hard one next time.  Russia SEV, but spin the big 
wheel to find out where they land - hopefully in the oil rigs in the North 
Sea.

<p>
(SARA-GM): I am not sure that any unit can traverse 21 black holes, if you 
define ``traverse'' to mean entering from an adjacent space and leaving by
another space.
As such, I don't think that Skaggerak can be ``traversed''. 
<i>((actually, you are quite correct...))</i>
So Austrian Army Serbia can traverse 20 black holes: Bulgaria, Constantinople,
Ankara, Armenia, Syria, Smyrna, Eastern Mediterranean, Aegean Sea, Ionian Sea,
Adriatic Sea, Venice, Tyrolia, Munich, Ruhr, Holland, Helgoland Bight, 
Denmark, Kiel, Berlin, and Baltic Sea.
Russian Fleet Gulf of Bothnia, Russian Army Livonia, and German Army Prussia
can traverse the same 20 black holes in reverse order.
The French Army in Burgundy can traverse the same 20 black holes with a slightly
different move order:
<i>((EXERCISE left to the reader....))</i>
The Russian Fleet in Sevastopol can traverse 19 black holes, bypassing Bulgaria.
It took me TWO 15-minute coffee breaks to work all this out.
My co-workers think I'm nuts.
<i>((Well, perhaps you ARE nuts... hyork, hyork, hyork...))</i>

<p>
(GER-BOARD): I thought collaboration was illegal in this variant.  What's 
all this stuff about communicating, planning, etc.  John, don't you 
understand rules after all this time?

<p>
(BOOB to BOARD): Ignore that silly man hiding behind the alleged German
curtain.
He makes no sense.... then again, perhaps the problem is that he is not
a he at all!!

<p>
(GER-BOARD): Who is this ``Mr. Burgess" that Schultzie referred to?  The 
Boob is no ``Mister."  Maybe that figment of Charles Jones' imagination, Dr. 
Boob'b brother is ``Mister Burgess."  Maybe when we get to name a game, 
``Clockwork Orange" we can get a Mr. Burgess to GM.

<p>
(BOOB to BOARD): Then again, perhaps when we name a game ``Go Fish'', 
Herr Weiss will be able to play!
Let's let Herr Weiss attempt to match the luscious one's analysis above....

<p>
(GER-BOARD): OK, I am challenged by the Boobster's gauntlet toss as to how 
many black holes is the maximum that a unit can traverse this time.  I 
propose that we work out both the theoretical maximum number of spaces one 
unit could traverse given 34 nukes, how many units could traverse such a 
path, and then create that in one of the upcoming games.  We would each hold 
part of the ``World record" for playing in the game that had the most spaces 
on a dip board one piece moved in one turn."  Now that is something that we 
could each be proud of.  If there is a majority of takers, perhaps we can 
convince the others.  As long as MARK LEW is not in this game, and I don't 
think he is, we have a chance.  If my memory is correct (and see Harry 
Andruschak's comments last issue in Fear and Whiskey as to my memory) then 
every player in one game of Nuclear Yuppie agreed not to attack with nukes 
one turn.  He, however, believed that I had created an elaborate hoax and 
didn't cooperate.  Later, he admitted that even if he had believed me, he 
wouldn't have done so, because he didn't like the concept of peace.  But, 
this is different, we get to create the ultimate trips path.  Mikey, got 
that, ``Trips."
	
<p>
Further, when we agree on what the theoretical ideal is, I agree to do it 
on one turn when I will be the major victim of the pattern.  See, further 
``proof" of my genuineness (is that a word Booby?).  
<i>((It's in every dictionary I read.))</i>
I get no SCs out of this.  Nor will my unit be the one(s) to traverse the 
path.  Y'all agree, great.  Let's go!!!!!!!

<p>
(SARA-OTHER PLAYERS): I do hope we can all be nice to one another and 
not try to grab home SCs or SCs traditionally considered taken in 1901
in Regular Diplomacy.
As such, I do hope that everyone will refrain from trying to grab Rome,
Naples, or Tunis.
I don't want to have to repeat what I have done to Mike Barno in 1901 and
Heath Gardner in 1902.
It looks unladylike and makes a bad impression.
<i>((Humph, you're no fun!!))</i>

<p>
(GER-HARRY ANDRUSCHAK): You sound so authoritative that I'll believe you.  
Yeah, you were there.  So was I.  It must have been the Wang-Dang-Doodle who 
as Russia nuked himself while leaving his units in place.  But, he's still 
around.  He could speak for himself rather than we telling his story.  How 
about if you get a letter from him about the events, then we won't have to 
have Boobie start one of those really lame ``The Search for David Wang" 
contests.
<i>((I hope I never lose touch with David and I probably won't.
You?
Well, you are almost lost right now yourself, and if you don't shape
up, we may wish you don't come back!!))</i>

<p>
(SARA-MIKE): OK, what is all this stuff about abuse of the GM?
Some sort of guy thing, like the Three Stooges?
As far as I can tell, the GM is a sweet man putting out a szine I can
get for FREE.
And he is a cat lover.
I like that in a man.

<p>
(BOOB to SARA): Insulting me like that earns you ``credit points'' that
you can use to abuse other players!!
And you DO want to abuse other players, don't you??
You have two free zingers on anyone else in the game.
<i>((By the way, the House Rules for the szine pretty clearly state
the fact and reason for my policy.
It works REALLY well in practice, believe me!
Did you not get a copy of the House Rules? 
If not, I'll send you some.
Then again, there are the husbands of players in the game.... you aren't
married to one of these are you???))</i>

<p>
(PAUL to JIM-BOOB):
I was going to send in guest press for NYEED, but I just can't come up with
anything witty.  I haven't been very witty in a very long time.
<i>((Nope, can't be true, say it ain't so!!!))</i>

<p>
(WEISS GUY-OLD FART): Honor to the originator not of bombing his own units 
but to bombing the GM.  Yes, yes, it is ``So Right" when the GM is Boobie.  
Boobs need radiation treatment or else they could have recurrences.  Which 
makes me wonder, if <i>TAP</i> ever changed editors and pubbers to keep the szine 
going, would that be called a ``prophylactic mastectomy?"
<i>((You have it all over Sara.... you have three free hits!!!))</i>	

<p>
(MCCULLOUGH-SHULTZ): Notice the secret code I'm using.  Use that decoder 
ring I sent to you last time.  The plan will be to spend half of our bombs 
on Weiss and the other half on Sandy - since she'll be leading everyone but 
you, and my gosh, I couldn't send you a secret code that described the plans 
to bomb you, could eye?

<p>
(AUSTROHUNGARIAN NUCLEAR ``DEFENSE" FORCES to VENETIAN MILITIA'S CHARRED
CORPSES):  You got what you deserved for trying to cross the Line.  We
have a ``Zero Defect Tolerance" policy for errors by neighboring units.

<p>
(NERD-JAMES): Quick, how many units aren't adjacent to a Black Hole and 
therefore can only move one space this time?  What country has the most such 
units?
<i>((Indeed, how nerdy.... how about something completely different??!!))</i>
	
<p>
(BEIJING):  A huge historical error was discovered and corrected in the
hubbub over the tenth anniversary of the Tienanmen Square
demonstrations.  It turns out that there was a translation error.  The
public was expressing its desire for <b>demographic reform,</b>
not democratic reform.  Citizens were tired of
unfocused mass mailings promoting Euro-denominated certificates of
deposit to rice-paddy peasants and retirement homes to university
student neighborhoods.  Instead they wanted accurate census and survey
data as a base for better-focused marketing programs.

<p>
(SARA-HEATH): Well, I did warn you in Summer 1901 not to grab any
German home SCs.
In Fall 1901 you did it anyway.
I'm sorry I had to take such drastic steps, and I hope this will not
have to be repeated in the future.
And good luck on reviving your zine.
However, I regret that I will not be voting for either you or Brent McKee
in the 1998 Hobby Awards Ballot, as I have not read either of the articles
mentioned in the Walker award for literature.

<p>
Ger-Tur:  Is it something we did last time that created this situation?  I 
used deoderant, how about you?

(GOZ to BOARD): Note that I'll be on a couple of ``well-earned" vacations
soon.  I'm gone June 24-28 and July 2-11.  Please adjust your diploming and
stabs accordingly.

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to BOARD):  For those of you who are wondering at the
footprints on the ceiling in my office, I just fell into tickets to a
certain sporting event this weekend (June 19-20) in (ahem) Pinehurst,
North Carolina.  See you on ABC; I'm the extraordinarily ugly one.  I
will NOT be shouting, ``YOU DA MAN!" or wearing a ``John 3:16" shirt.

<p>

Am I, or aren't I!!!???
You're also ``all wet''.

away!

(ENGLAND to THE FRENCH PEOPLE): You have been abandoned by your leadership.
The road to Paris is wide open for the glorious forces of the British and
German allies.  Learn from the French generals - it is useless to try to
resist.  We promise no harm or retribution as we consider the French people
to be our friends.  Our only enemy was your misguided government - a
government which is now hiding in Spain.

<p>
(AUSTRIA - TURKEY): Hey, if you come across a dude by the name of Milosevich,
arrest him. Our local Nostradamus
has predicted someone by the name of Slobodon will rise to power and wage 
genocidal war by the end of the century.

<p>
(OZOG - MIKE BARNO): In that case, Paul Rauterberg said he could use a few nukes 
right about now.  I gotta remember     to order that Patriot defense system.
Thanks for the demo.

<p>
(ENGLAND to GERMANY): Who will march at the head of our victory parade into
Paris?

<p>
(LONDON to ROME): I suggest you sack some generals.  They seem to have
problems giving proper orders to the troops.

<p>
(MILWAUKEE): Paul read the game results for Fall with an air of
incredulity.  ``NO!"  he screamed, tearing at the zine in abusive fury.
``I made a mistake!  My
reputation, assiduously cultivated over a quarter of a century, is
ruined!  I'm a
laughingstock.  The whole hobby is watching!"  A (crocodile) tear ran
down his
cheek.  ``What do I do to regain the respect of an entire hobby
audience?"  And
then Paul fell silent, and a familiar smirk reasserted itself in the
panoply of his
facial features.  ``Need this be a total disaster?" he asked his audience
of none.
``If everybody is going to UNDERESTIMATE my abilities, can't I make this
work
in my favor?"  With a loud sniffle, he regained his total cool.  ``I'll
write a filksong
on this topic one of these days..." he plotted, humming an old Bob Dylan
melody.

<p>
(ENGLAND to RUSSIA):  Why wouldn't you believe us?  All we wanted was peace in
the north so we could concentrate on the Frogs.  You would still have Sweden
if you had done as was suggested.

<p>
(JAMES to EMMERT): Too bad about Greece.  Did you get to used to my
perfect orders in Suffren?  Actually, if the truth be known, I just stumbled
into 18 centers.

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA): DON'T MAKE ME KILL AGAIN!!!!!

<p>
(VENICE to BUD): You may never be aware as to how lucky you were last
season.

<p>
(ROME to MOSCOW AND PARIS): We who deserve no luck get none.

<p>
(GOZ to JIM-BOB): The Yankees, Indians and Rangers are in.  The Red Sox are
still ``iffy".  We're not halfway yet.  I can still see Seattle, Toronto or
even (dare I say it?) Baltimore getting their act together for a wild card.
Your Giants can't compete with the riches of Los Angeles or Arizona either.
Look for the Dodgers, Braves and Astros to be in.  The wild card will be
fought for in Arizona, Philadelphia, and New York.  The last stat I saw said
that 59% of the games to date had been won by the team with the higher
payroll.  59% of 162 is 96 wins.  That'll get you in the playoffs most
seasons.  Isn't it great that MLB doesn't even have to play the season
anymore to know who is going to win it?  Phooey.
<i>((The Red Sox cooling off the Orioles DID make me breathe a little
easier.
I don't see Seattle or Toronto doing anything....))</i>

<p>
(TURKEY to RUSSIA): War or peace; it's your choice.  If it's war, I'll go
in with a clean conscience, since you fired the first shot -
unnecessarily, in my opinion.

<p>
(YOUNG ANAKIN to YOUNG LUKE): Go and hole up in Iberia, my son.  It is
your desssssstiny.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Since I like this game and am learning how to do this and have to
put my new knowledge to good use, I will start another game.
I'll keep the sign-up list here so that interested parties will see it
as they peruse the szine.
All games will start when they have precisely six players and for the moment
I will keep the game opening list always on.
This game will continue to be free, like Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire.
Currently in line for the next game (to be Version 2.3) are: 
Luke Dwyer, David Partridge, Rick Desper, Eric Brosius, John Schultz,
Warren Goesle, John Harrington
all have expressed interest in this game.
Plus I am interested in playing.
I was going to run this one, but 
David has volunteered to run a game in <i>Tinamou</i>, so
I'm going to let David start his game first,
Then I'll come back and start another signup list here after that.
I am claiming GM and publisher perogative to be in the game.
Others from the above list that want to be in David's game, please
contact David. 
He will notify me when that game is full.
David plans to use Version 2.3 of the rules that restricts breakaways. 

<p>
2) Damon and Barkin' have indeed dropped
from the pack, joining Will.
It isn't yet clear which of them will end up ``behind'' the other at the end.
Everyone will stay on the track, but I'm going to stop listing all the
spaces in between.
Some other riders in the pack have VERY low sets of cards available.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(DAVE PARTRIDGE):
A reminder, please let me know if you want to be in the new game.  Jim
had 6 players listed (and Jim makes 7).  I've only heard from Jim and
Goz. I'm assuming the rest of you want to play?  Can someone tell me
if 7 is too many?  
<i>((Seven is too many, we want to play with exactly six.
Don't worry, anyone who doesn't get in your game goes back on my
waiting list.
Some people may WANT the chance to oppose you!!))</i>
If so, then it's first come first serve.  If not,
then I'll just start next issue with all 7 of you.  Does anyone like
the idea of NOT publishing the starting cards?  
<i>((Not me...))</i>
Please send me your
starting cards by the next issue.  Also let me know your preference 
on deadlines.  Tinamou is every other <i>TAP</i>, but I'm willing to do this
every <i>TAP</i> to keep the game moving.
<i>((I'll go whichever way you want.
With your new child and new house, you may prefer the former approach.))</i>
 
<p>
(CHEF - STOOGES): I have to make an argument in favor of the ``multiple
breakaway" bonus.  I think it adds excitement and simulates a real
race.  In a real race, you cannot just sit in the pack and wait for
the leader to come back to you.  

<p>
(GOZ TRANSPORTATION CO., QUARTERLY REPORT to THE PARENT COMPANY, GOZ &amp; CO.,
INC.): Profits up $13M last quarter, defying the experts and surprising the
hell out of the CEO, who was on his way to Vegas to place a large bet on #59.

<p>
(VEGAS ODDS - TFWS): Mea culpa!  We had no idea that Shane the Chain
would score a 21.  Well done!  

<p>
(ANON - SHANE): Play the 21!
<i>((I think he's fixin' to play it next time, but he decided to bet
that someone would end up on that space ahead of him.
If he'd guessed right, he would have replaced his 10.... this way, he
still gets over the line, but with how many fewer points???))</i>

<p>
(VEGAS ODDS - FARMER MAC): Looks like we may owe you an apology too.  
All four bunnies got at least a 10 last time!  

<p>
(DAMON VELODROME to BARKIN' LARKIN'): I've got Will holding stools for us at
the pub.  Interested?

<p>
(PUZZLER - FIELD): How can Damon and Larkin guarantee that they never
get stuck playing only 3s?  Two riders working together can make sure
they average at least 3 1/3 squares per turn.  Got that one?  Now,
what about three riders working together.  It looks like they can
guarantee at least 3 1/2 squares per turn.  

<p>
(VEGAS): Needless to say, the idiot who gave Kyle 2:1 odds and 6:1 odds to
Shane, 8:1 to Mopsy, and 9:1 to Christoph Wheelhub is no longer
working for the company.  Flowers may be sent to the Shady Rest
Funeral Home.  

<p>
We are happy to note that the ``who gets dropped next" board scored a
00 - Larkin and Velodrome, by getting dropped simultaneously, allowed
the House to win all bets.  We've now got a team of crack
mathematicians working on the problem of how they can most efficiently
increase their lead over Shakespeare, and perhaps catch the next rider
to be dropped.  

<p>
Next sprint finishes are off the board, for obvious reasons.  

<p>
(HELP WANTED): 4 riders and team manager for a bicycle team in Dave
Partridge's game.  Experience preferred.  Must be able to demonstrate speed,
endurance, and a head for business.  Send resumes and trophy pictures to Goz
Transportation Co. home office, which is moving so that the current team
can't find it.

<p>
(SOUTH PARK MORGUE):

<p>
Mortician 1:  Oh, here's that poor McCormick kid.

<p>
Mortician 2:  Poor thing.  Well, time to get started on the embalming.

<p>
(they set up the apparatus)

<p>
M1:  Well, we've got to wait for the embalming fluid to fill.

<p>
M2:  Hmm...I'll go get some steak sandwiches for while we wait.

<p>
M1:  Good!  We can use this Worcestershire sauce!  (He puts the bottle
down next to the embalming fluid.)  

<p>
M2:  Could you grab us some drinks at the 7-11?  

<p>
M1:  Sure thing.  (They both leave.  As the door shuts, the wind
topples the bottle of Worcestershire sauce.  The sauce starts mixing
with the embalming fluid.  Yes, we know what happens next!
Kenny's eyes flicker open - the Undead awake!)

<p>
(SEGUE SAM - FIELD): Speaking of the undead, just saw the film 
``The Mummy", or, more accurately, ``Die Mumie."  Amusing little film.

2) Rich got his address change, but not his orders to me.
I'm forced to call a standby.
The roulette wheel goes round (actually a six sided die - which came up fives...)
and stops on none other than Randy Ellis.
Rich needs to put fall orders on file by the summer deadline, or Randy will

From ``Mirror'' on <i>Me</i>.

<p>
(DAVE to JEFF): Do you always go around wacking bee's nests with sticks? (&lt;:

<p>
(FRANCE-GERMANY): One notes that, in the best tradition of Diplomacy,
you managed to obtain more SCs from the three power attack on France
than Britain and Italy COMBINED.
When this game is over, and the endgame statements are due, one hopes you will 
inform us as to how you managed to sucker John Schultz and Eric Ozog into
this arrangement.

<p>
(BERLIN): Just some genteel swaps this time; Bel for Auv, Mar for Hun,
and Poland for retirement.  Seems like a fair time for all.

<p>
(P-WORLD): Those Germans are committing war crimes. All the world should
begin a campaign against aggression now. Bombing alone will not do it in
this one, or if it does it will take to long. We are dying here. Will
someone throw me a frickin bone here people? I demand one million
dollars to not destroy the world. (my little finger is at my mouth as I
type this)

<p>
(BOOB to POLAND): Some view Austin Powers as evidence of the hopeless 
degeneration of American society and values.....

<p>
(GEORGES CLEMENCEAU, FORMER FRENCH PREMIER to WORLD): America is the only
nation in history which miraculously has gone directly from barbarism to
degeneration without the usual interval of civilization.

<p>
(BOOB to POLAND): Others, though, are more flexible and pliant....

<p>
(IGNORAMUS OF UKRAINE - KENT OF CORNWALL): King Leer. I read him.  Him and 
  Lady McBed were really hot in Shakespeare Does Cornwall.  That scene on
  the bed (the one with the golden arches holding up the canopy) where she
  cries ``Out, out damn spot" and calls in the maid to change the sheets 
  and the maid joins them ....

<p>
(JOHN BOY-BOOB): Wow!
Cornwall really let you have it via King Lear.
Inspires me to look for something even more insulting.
Maybe next time!

<p>
(BOOB to POLAND): Yet others are too busy plotting your annihilation
to care....

<p>
(GREATER GERMAN REICH to UKRAINE): Let's see.  Cau cuts Azr, Wbs cuts
Ank,  Ebs
supports Bos-Geo.  Should do the trick.  All you have to worry about is
a Turkish
Army in Vol....

<p>
(ITALIA to THE SAD CLOWNS (ET)): I got sick of waiting for you guys to DO
anything!

<p>
(JEFF to JIM): What's the sense in exterminating France if we still have
to put up with Harry's press?
<i>((Hmmm, perhaps they would like a ``do-over''?))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-<i>TAP</i>): Time for another alcoholism joke, I think.
Well, this guy came home in the wee hours of the morning, to be
greeted at the door by his wife.
``So what is your excuse for being late THIS time?''

<p>
``I had (hic) car trouble.''

<p>
``What kind of car trouble?''

<p>
``Water in the carburetor!''

<p>
``That's a good one - it hasn't rained in weeks.
So where is the car now?''

<p>
``In the swimming pool.''

<p>
(JEFF to HARRY): Just kidding!

<p>
(GREATER REICH to ROME): Try a triple flip on us, and we'll fry you like
flapjacks.

<p>
(ITA-WORLD): I'm taking pointers from der Fuhrer on the two front war
thing.

<p>
(MUNICH to KIEV): Your alliance with Italy may not be the boon for us
that we envisioned, nor may it be much help to you!  Give some thought
to scarfing up a
few Eye-tal dots for yourself, and it won't be a total loss....

<p>
(ITA-TUR): It takes more than coffee and cigars to satisfy my appetite - I
must have dots!

<p>
(MUNICH to ROME):
Suddenly, the idea of  U/I/E crops up:  is Spain included too, to
create a S/U/I/E (suey) alliance?  We would be obliged to chop that up, in
defense of our southern frontier....

<p>
(FRANKONIA to CAIRO): So, the plan is do a quick number on Turkey along
with U/I?
Geez, don't you think that you'd be better off doing the deed yourself?

<p>
(REICH to SPAIN): Stand and wait.  Watch and wonder.

<p>
(THE GREATER REICH to WORLD): Now that we have secured our ``elbow room",
we will be looking for places to ``kick up our heels".

<p>
(POTS AND KETTLES DEPARTMENT): Since this is not an election year, 
and since he cannot run for President again anyhow, Clinton is
attacking Hollywood, saying that Hollywood much be held accountable.
Washington, DC, holding Hollywood accountable?
Sort of like Sodom checking up on Gomorrah.

<p>
(BOOB SPUTTERS): Lebensraum indeed!!

<p>
(PODOLIA): The citizenry here rejoice to be freed from Polish oppression,
and are
now requesting German  protection from the pall of Ukrainian smog
hovering over the province.  The Reichsministry for Environmental
Affairs promise to issue a
statement telling the Ukraine to ``get the lead out" in removing their
noxious tanks from the Pod's borders.

<p>
(U-P or UP HIS): Gonna take more than luck now.  Start booby-trapping those
houses.

<p>
(WEBSTERS): Booby trap (v.)  To scatter numerous clones of an aging, greying
  yet still playing diplomacy player throughout a territory about to be 
  overrun.  These insidious beings will infect the player running the 
  conquering country, causing his units to wander around the board in 
  strange and apparently random patterns while spouting voluminous, if not
  particularly coherent, press.  The rumor persists that there is actually
  a method behind the unit movements, but so far not even chaos theory has
  been able to uncover it.

<p>
(THE CEMETARIES OF THE GREATER GERMAN REICH): There are rumors of a pesty
poltergeist, calling itself  Monsieur Henri, haunting the graveyards
that the Reich
inherited from the Country that was Formerly France.  Not surprisingly,
it is said
to be bending the ears of leaders in the Southern Confluence (if such an
entity
exists!) urging all to wage war against the expanded German Empire.
     
<p>
The spook is obviously pulling a little joke, since no nations of
the Southern
Cross-eyes have common borders with us (yet).  It sets great urgency to
the cause of stopping The Greater Reich from winning the war, causing no
little panic amongst the little people of the southern periphery (and
great hilarity throughout
the Ranks of the Mittle-europan adherents).
     
<p>
Who is it that will rise to defeat us?  The Polish dead, still
wandering back and
forth....  The Turkish dead, standing stock still awaiting the Egyptian
long knives....
The Spanish dead, dreaming on an invincible armada while lacking the
shipyards
in which to build it....  The Russian dead, floating face down in the
waters of the
Baltic and claiming that they ``occupy" it....
     
<p>
``Boo", they say.  ``Boo-hoo" they cry.

<p>
(JEFF to JEAN): Run that past me again, only speak in English this time.

<p>
(GREATER GERMAN REICH to ITALY): We have been calling you our ``strong 
arm in the South."  Well, as it says in the
Bible, ``if thy arm doth spite thee, cut it off."

<p>
(JEFF to PAUL): Two parents in a stable home.
Isn't that concept preached in the Bible?

<p>
(RICK THE OBSERVER to PAUL): Thanks for standing up for keeping
religion out of schools.  My secular high school was much better than
most religious high schools.  I actually don't care if people learn
<i>about</i> religion in school, as long as it's not an indoctrination.

<p>
But please, I'm sick of the ``two-parent home" bandwagon.  It sounds
like you had two <i>good</i> parents.  Great for you.  But I come from a
generation where a lot of kids grew up in single-parent homes.  For
many kids, they don't have a choice of living in a home with two great
parents.  Their family lives more closely resemble ``Sling Blade" than
``Ozzie and Harriet."  Yes, parents should pay attention to and care
for their children, and that means not only mothers but fathers too.
But participating in the conception of a child does not magically
transform a miserable wretch of a person into a model adult.

<p>
(SPAIN): Sorry for the content and the one over cops is from rumors 
when I lived in Cleveland about four to five years ago.

<p>
(DESPER - ANDRUSCHAK): I think most people who support bringing
religion into schools would quickly develop a different opinion if
they moved to a neighborhood where the majority religion was other
than their own.  I had the advantage of living in a largely Jewish
neighborhood for much of my childhood.  I somehow doubt that the
religious right envisions the possibility of having the Torah read
aloud during class every day.  

<p>
(JOHN-HARRY): I agree with you.
Kids, some kids, have always been mean and bullying.
The only difference between then and now is ready access 
to firearms and an indefinable lack of fear of punishment.
And don't anyone give me the no-one is punished any more
argument.
If you'd bother to look, they're actually more severe now
then ever.
Hey, you barely missed the embassy bombing reaction, eh?
Whew!

<p>
(JEFF to HARRY): ... I'm watching a show on A&amp;E called Biography.
They are describing Lyndon Johnson's meeting with the Joint Chiefs,
discussing our entry into the Vietnam War.
The Joint Chiefs recommended 1 million men, with a full commitment
and the war could be won in 2 years.
Johnson decides to make the commitment and then he sends over 
150,000 guys.
It was this decision that got us into the prolonged stalemate
that became the Vietnam War. 
Blaming Eisenhower or Nixon without even mentioning Johnson
is in my opinion intellectually reckless.

<p>
(GLOBE TROTTING ANDRUSCHAK-TV WATCHERS): Anyone who decides to 
tour China must be willing to accept the ``F'' word.
Flexibility.
China is still a newcomer to the tourist business and lots of things
can go wrong.

<p>
That was the case for my tour.
The ship we were supposed to use for the 3 day cruise on the Yangtze
River, the M/V Yangtze prince, had some sort of change in schedule,
so the tour was re-booked on the M/V Yellow Crane, sailing three days
earlier.
This meant that we stayed only 3 nights in Beijing instead of 4,
1 night in Xi'an instead of 2, and did not overnight at all in Chonquing.
After the cruise, we had 1 night in Wuhan.
And we now had 4 nights in Shanghai instead of 1.
After that it was 1 night in Guangzhou and 4 nights in Hong Kong.
Except when we got to Chongquing, the boat was not there.
It seems the Yangtze River had very low water and the Yellow
Crane was waiting for us downstream.
So we did overnight in Chongquing and next morning rode a hydrofoil to the ship.
So we had only two nights on the ship instead of three, but we still saw the
entire Three Gorges Region which was, after all, the primary purpose of 
the river cruise.

<p>
We had another change in schedule when we arrived in Hong Kong.
Original plans had called for an excursion to Macao.
These plans had to be cancelled when a typhoon headed directly for Hong
Kong, causing the long distance ferries to be shut down.
Side note: Hong Kong does post typhoon warnings, starting with a Stage
1 alert.
Stage 2 is when the typhoon gets closer, and Stage 3 is when the shut
down the long distance ferries.
Stage 8 is when they shut down ALL ferries.
And no, there are no Stages 4-7.
Don't ask me why, I don't know.
This particular typhoon became Stage 8 when it changed course and was
headed directly for Hong Kong.
After a couple of hours, it just fizzled out and went back to Stage 3.
Then it veered off and things were normal again.

<p>
Fans of the Doctor Demento Show will be happy to know that you can still
hear the firing of the midday gun in Hong Kong, an event immortalized
in Noel Coward's song ``Mad Dogs and Englishmen".
But nowadays EVERYONE goes out into the midday sun in Hong Kong.

<p>
In addition to the ``F'' word'', you also need to remember the ``P''
word, patience.
This is especially true when you are on your tour bus and the driver is trying
to get you to the destination in one piece.
The traffic in most Chinese cities is ghastly, as cars take over from the
traditional bicycles.
New roads and expressways are being built, but there is never enough and
never will be enough.

<p>
In point of fact, our tour group went from city to city by airlines.
China lacks good roads between many cities, and the railroads are
uncomfortable, unreliable, and slow.
We went on the railroads just once, the short ride from Guangzhou to
Hong Kong.
But in the cities we had to use the bus to get to and from the hotel,
and that included a lot of time in traffic jams.

<p>
(JEFF to HARRY II): Enlighten me.
Tell me how the Soviet Union invasion of Hungary was Ike's fault.

<p>
(JEFF to HARRY III): Ike and Nixon do have one thing in common.
They both ended wars started by Democrats.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) All proposals fail - not that it matters!
Congratulations to Charles Jones for sticking it out.
He WINS!!
Richard Weiss failed to offer the unwanted support to Harold Zarr in
Spain to oppose the attack by Charles.
Thus, Spain falls!!!
Then, Germany does the unstoppable attack on Vienna.
But Rick Davis survives by moving back to Budapest!!!!

<p>
2) I'll give you all a bit of time to compose End Game statements.
I will put in the game summary in an upcoming issue.
Somewhere, I have the original records for this game and will hunt for them.
I must admit to rooting for the game to continue, but it does reach the
appropriate natural end, with a win.
Thanks to EVERYONE for playing this game out with verve and perseverance!

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FRANCE-GERMANY): It's about time we beat Turkey.  Why'd you change your 
orders there at the end?
	
<p>
(AUSTRIA-TURKEY): Longest one dot survival in the History of the Hall of 
Fame.  Yabba-dabba doo!
	
<p>
(MIKE BARNO - HOF BOARD): Look the other way, here comes a solo winner 
riding on the back of a slimey toady.
	
<p>
(GERMANY-TURK-THE-JERK): Too bad you made so many stupid moves.  You deserve 
the sh.t you are eating now.  You and your BUD budman.  Silly little cape.
	
<p>
(ERIC SCHLEGEL-JIMBOB): Would you please remove my name from the list 
now!!!???  Why keep pointing out that I couldn't even outlast Weiss!
<i>((Almost.... you have to write an endgame statement now, or I'll
NEVER let you go!!!))</i>	

<p>
(BROTHER OF JAMES): I don't exist and either does 666 Smith St or Mike 
Barno.
	
<p>
(AUSTRIA-GERMANY): Half hearted laugh, weak congratulations.
	 
<p>
(BLACK HOLE - BLACK PRESS): Whee, this has been fun.  Come on over.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> JIM-BOB): I think that this game should count as the 
longest running game in <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i>.
The moves up till 1908 should count as being made here since the game is 
here now.
<i>((Humph, wonder what Melinda would think of that!!
No way....))</i>

<p>
(FRA-TUR): Thank you for your kind comments, but I do not deserve them.
My play in this game was quite poor by my standards, and I did not deserve
to win this game.
Germany, on the other hand, played well and was a loyal and faithful ally.
When it became obvious to me that no one could win the game the way it
was going, and that you would apparently drag it out forever, the only
option I saw that any validity was to throw my centers to Germany.
I have never dropped out of a game, and I never will.
It is unfair to all of the other players on the board, and it 
represents ``poor play'' in my opinion.
<i>((Well, then perhaps your play wasn't quite as poor as you
thought.
I do salute all of you for sticking this out.
I can now say that although we did come close to draws occasionally, 
at least one person always saw it differently from the rest!))</i>
You played well, but your press turned me against you, and I would
never have worked with you under any circumstances.
Congratulations to Charles on a well-deserved win.
