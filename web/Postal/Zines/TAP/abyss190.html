<p><br><p><br>``When you have a place in the country, lay out twenty pounds a year
upon a laboratory.
It will be an amusement to you....
Take a course of chemistry or a course of rope dancing, or a course of
anything to which you are inclined at the time.
Contrive to have as many retreats for your mind as you can, as many things 
to which it can fly from itself.''
Dr.&nbsp;Samuel Johnson, as quoted by his illustrious scribe James Boswell
in his <i>Life of Johnson</i>.
Boswell's comment upon Johnson's answer to his question as to what he
should do to overcome melancholy and hypochondria is a bit more pithy...
``There was a liberal philosophy in this advice which pleased me much.
I <i>thought</i> of a course of concubinage, but was afraid to mention it.''

Wow, it must be summer!!

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada. 
You can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
The current game opening for Colonial Diplomacy will start
as soon as I get money from seven players since Nekayah has now ended.
For more on this, see below.
Also note that more results for the new demo game 
are included.
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
Note that everything has been moved to the diplom.org site.
See David's letter below.
The Cal Tech ftp site is being mirrored on the diplom.org machine as well.
Issues of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> #131 to the present are 
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu in the 
pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP directory in compressed postscript format.
The gracious assistance of Kevin Roust is most appreciated
in keeping up this site.
The files begin ap131.ps.Z and go sequentially from there.
Since it's UNIX based, all of those upper and lower cases are important.
If anyone wants help from me on doing this, they only have to ask and I
can help you determine if you have access to FTP which stands for
File Transfer Protocol and can handle postscript files.
The Caltech site is at:

In addition, through Jamie McQuinn's portion of the Pouch, or directly
through:

<p>
http://diplom.org/pub/diplomacy/Zines/TAP/

<p>
you can access the mirror site to Caltech and get to the szine that way.
This mirror site is lightning quick, or at least it has been for me
recently.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR JERRY LUCAS</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>Jerry Lucas has been gone for some time, but he is fondly remembered
as the hobby's only ``cross-dressing'' szine editor, playing Judy
Winsome in the szine <i>Winsome, Losesome</i>.
Jerry used to live in the Bay Area as a postal supervisor (many
prominent hobby publishers have worked for the venerable USPS,
among them newly re-crowned Boardman Number Custodian, Conrad
von Metzke) and possibly still does.
In the ``sharing names with prominent personalities'' it is NOT
the same Jerry Lucas who once played basketball for the Knicks
and who was known for launching high arcing jump shots that 
threatened to hit the center scoreboard of many arenas.
Jerry Lucas is a common enough name though, that you guys may
have the same problems searching for him that you did with Mike Mills.
Nevertheless, off you go!!
Someone win one of these, does fifty bucks mean nothing to you??
It's no fun offering prizes and not giving them away!!
More hints will be forthcoming in future issues.

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Mike Mills or Garret Schenck
is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.
The next person will be announced in Issue #195.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p> 
Obscure and not-so-obscure ramblings on the state of the hobby
and its publications, custodians, events, and individuals with
no guarantee of relevance from the fertile keyboard of Jim-Bob,
the E-Mail Dip world, and the rest of the postal hobby.
My comments are in <i>italics</i> and <i>((double 
quotation marks))</i> like this.
<b>Bold face</b> is used to set off each individual speaker.
I should also make a note that I do edit for syntax and spelling
on occasion.

<p>
A brief editorial from me first.
There was a neat little article in the <i>New York Times Magazine</i>
on Sunday, May 25th, entitled ``Elegy for the Hobby''.
It isn't about The Hobby (meaning ours) specifically, but says a lot
about the decline of hobbies in the urban commuter environment of today,
where everything you do has to be aimed at achieving greater general
social status.
Here's a quote that sums up a lot of ideas from the article:
``True hobbies require single-mindedness.
They provide a strong counterbalance to work.
They are a marital aid, a mechanism for spouse avoidance.
They involve the accumulation of equipment and lore; that is, 
irredeemably specific information.
This gives the hobbyist a pleasing sense of progress - or pseudoprogress,
because hobbies are conservative.
Here is the prime law of hobbies: Absorbing but Not Transforming.
They fill the mind without altering it.''

<p>
I don't completely agree with everything in there (and would welcome debate
on the issues), but I do resonate strongly with the single-mindedness
(in a complex world where everything else is not) and the counterbalance
to work.
I think that's one reason why you don't get professional negotiators
playing a lot of Diplomacy.
They need to have a hobby like building model airplanes where they
control the building of every little piece, instead of having to
work out concessions of every point.
The perceived ``decline'' in some quarters of the hobby, remains
largely irrelevant to me.
I do this primarily for me.
I hope you do it primarily for you.
And I hope we all can go on enjoying it together.
Read on in the knowledge that everything you learn below is
irredeemably specific.
But also in some knowledge that you have chosen a hobby that is at
the liberal end of the ``transformation'' scale of hobbies, it is
for you to reason why.

Hi,
I have just had the time to go through the latest <i>TAP</i>. 
Yep, you've listed my
EMail address properly (well, one of them). I can be reached at
wandrew of aol.com, wandrew of compuserve.com or wandrew of juno.com. I check all of
them at least daily if I am in town.

<p>
By now you should know Conrad von Metzke is now the pubber of <i>PONT</i>. 
As soon as I can get the next <i>EVERYTHING</i> out, he'll be the 
BNC as well. 
I do appreciate your having listed <i>PONT</i> in <i>TAP</i> every time - yes,
I've received some inquiries based on your advert. THANKS!!

<p>
<i>((You're quite welcome, you do realize this also means the end of
our trade.
See below!
I'm sorry to hear of your relinquishing of so many publishing duties,
but surely understand it.))</i>

<p>
As for CD's and music, I didn't really buy anything in '96 that really stands
out. I finally was able to get a copy of the 2nd B5 CD and quite enjoy it.
However, of late, the <i>Greatest Hits of Fleetwood Mac</i>, Fogerty's latest
<i>Blue Moon Swamp</i> and Diamond's <i>September Moon</i> have been 
getting repeated playings. 
As a side note, one of the folks I work with spent most of today
(May 29th) with George Strait filming his new video. If you see someone
driving a '77 (I think) Grey pick-up in the video with a black LOPD SWAT
T-Shirt on, that's him!!
<i>((I hope he doesn't get in trouble for wearing Police Department
issue clothing on a commercial video.
Here in Providence, they got in big trouble when one of the policemen 
lent his uniform to a woman who wore it in a video....
but the T-Shirt is much less ``formal''.))</i>

<p>
On another tack, as I'm cutting down on my hobby activities (reducing my
GMing load, zine load, BNC load, etc), I can be a more active standby than in
the past. Feel free to use me in any game and I'll even write letters!!

<p>
Keep up the GREAT work!!

Dear Jim:

<p>
Richard Weiss' mention of ``albums of the decade and of the millenium" is
dangerous - you don't want to get me started on this.  I will nominate a
handful, without going into the detail that this issue could engender.

<p>
<i>Blind Faith</i> is amazing; it makes you wonder what else they would have
produced if egos hadn't prevented their recording more than one album.

<p>
<i>The Allman Brothers Band Live at Fillmore East</i> is my nominee for best
live album.  I have heard that <i>Get Your Ya Ya's Out</i> by the Stones is a
classic, but I must shamefully confess I've never heard it.  (Sidebar:  I
have a hard time deciding on my favorite Stones album, but I'll give the
nod to <i>Sticky Fingers</i> over <i>Let It Bleed</i>, simply because 
``Can't You Hear Me Knocking" is so damn good.  End of sidebar.)

<p>
<i>John Barleycorn Must Die</i>.  Every tune is a keeper.

<p>
<i>Regatta de Blanc</i>, in my foolish opinion, contains neither 
the best Police tune nor the next-best, but it has numbers 
three, four, five and six. 
Absolutely wonderful if you like ska.

<p>
<i>Rio Grande Mud</i> by ZZTop.

<p>
I'm tempted to add <i>Letters from Home</i> by Pat Metheny, but if you open up
the field to jazz, then you have to include <i>Seven Steps to Heaven</i> and
<i>Kind of Blue</i> by Miles Davis, and that leads in turn to blues, where I
could close my eyes and point to any Muddy Waters album, and half of
John Lee Hooker's, and now the list is starting to get big and unwieldy.

<p>
I have just upgraded my home PC to bring me into the latter half of the
90's.  I'll spare you the details, but if any of the CG's (computer geeks)
are interested, I can tell them all about it.  
I'll still keep my sub coming to
the office, as I'm not sure how often I'll log on at home.

We would have had more luck if Jerry Garcia were still alive - then I
would suggest that we check at any Dead concert in the Northeast for a
fair chance of finding the ol' rascal.  (Schenck, not Garcia.)

<p>
Having been on-line for about two days now, I want to know how
anyone other than Evelyn Wood and Deep Blue can ever get around to
checking out even one twentieth of one percent of the stuff that's out

started to hurt while I was still looking at the menu.  But one good (or
maybe bad) thing has happened - my cyberphobic wife got on line with
one of her pals in NYC Saturday night and had a blast exchanging IM's. 
Caroline is looking at the thing with increasing curiosity, although she still
hasn't mastered the mouse.  When she gets a couple of years older, I

<p>
Jim -
Still trying to figure out Mike Barno's letter in <i>TAP</i> #189.  
It starts out well, of course, as would anything that launches with 
the words ``Ken Peel,...", but it then continues with 
``...Mark Lew, James Wall, and you sometimes get to see 
government officials in unusual situations."  Now, I am
oldie and moldie enough to have once known Mark Lew and James Wall 
pretty well.  
Do they feed of the federal trough as well?  Didn't know that.
<i>((No, other than their interest in commenting on political issues,
I'm not sure exactly why Mike said that.))</i>

<p>
Okay, so you have gotten my attention.  What else shall I say from
Deadwoodsville?  Hmm... I read an interview on <i>Wired</i>'s 
Internet site with
Harry Turtledove, the well-known sf a-h writer (that's science fiction
alternate-history, for the non-cognoscente).  Seems when he was a graduate
student at UCLA he played a lot of Diplomacy.  Sorry, that's the totality of
the story.

<p>
Hmm... now for a segue into a surprisingly-related tidbit.  During that
interview Turtledove panned the Gingrich-Forstchen sf a-h novel, 1945 (he
also implicitly panned Forstchen, a fellow well-known sf a-h writer).  This
was in the context of a discussion of his own ``cowritten" book, 
<i>The Two Georges</i>, with a celebrity, Richard Dreyfuss.  
<i>((Yes, the ``co-writing'' business is getting to be epidemic.))</i>
To change lanes slightly, and to get back to the original topic, 
I recently bought a hardback copy of 1945
cheap (I hear most were returned to the publisher, 
who plans to pulp them).
I took the copy to a friend who works for Gingrich, 
and got it signed to me
(``To my friend Ken, Newt").  
Gee, that was nice.  I've never yet met the man.
Maybe that was in an alternate-history.
<i>((Hey, c'mon, Ken, you work in DC and know better than that.
Everyone's a friend, until they're you're enemy.
And even then, enemies make deals, when it's in their interest,
especially if they're secret.))</i>

<p>
It looks like I might be in Hong Kong for the turnover this June 30-July 1.
I got invited to join a congressional staff delegation there.  Hey, I missed
Berlin in 1989.  This time I'll get to see things go the other way.  Reminds
me of the Machiavelli quote, ``The despot who takes over a free city and does
not destroy it, will himself be destroyed."  
That's a paraphrase.  Can't seem
to find my copy of <i>The Prince</i> around here anywhere.  
I don't expect to see anything much when I am there.  
Much more important is what comes six months
to a year later.  Does the civil service remain honest?  
Does Hong Kong's rule of law stay intact?  
Does PRC-style cronyism take hold?  If the answer
is yes, yes, no, then Hong Kong has a chance.  If not, then legal
``guarantees" of individual liberties will mean nothing, and electoral
procedures will have no significance.
<i>((I agree, but one thing I am glad is gaining prominence, that
I have argued for years (even in these pages) is the importance of the
``Rule of Law''.   
To economists it should be obvious (though Jeffrey Sacks and
Andrei Shleifer [Andrei being one of the two people in trouble
for making money on the Russian markets while advising the 
Russian government] didn't figure this one out) that protecting
property rights is the number one function of a functioning capitalist
system.
People don't understand that the fundamental characteristic of business
is risk-taking or entrepreneurship.
That's what creates wealth.
Regardless of tax policy, if you aren't sure that the government will
stand on your side on what you gain from your risk-taking being yours, 
you won't take the risk and the economy will go in the toilet.
In short, Hong Kong is screwed.))</i>

<p>
I was being lobbied recently be someone from Hong Kong's economic and
cultural office in Washington about a new extradition treaty presently before
the Senate.  What is interesting about this is that it is a treaty between
the United States and the government of Hong Kong, not with the PRC as
sovereign authority.  I have asked, and it appears that this is 
the first time we have negotiated a treaty with an entity 
that does not represent the sovereign authority of the jurisdiction 
(as least de facto, as we do have law
enforcement treaties with, for instance Taiwan).  To compare, the current
treaties that involve Hong Kong are all technically with the UK.  To get back
to the point at hand, the Hong Kong representative was talking about all the
important guarantees in the treaty - those ``guarantees" are critical, as we
have no extradition treaty with China because of its generally corrupt
judicial system.  I asked whether there are any circumstances where an
American extradited to Hong Kong could be sent on to China for trial.  I
received the answer ``no," and then pulled out a copy of Hong Kong's new
``Basic Law" passed by Beijing and showed him the broad judicial authority
China maintained for issues that it considers affect national security.
 China has long used such authority to convict its own citizens for
essentially anything it wanted to.  The Hong Kong representative, it turns
out had not read the actual text of either the extradition treaty or the
Basic Law.  Imagine!  It always seemed worthwhile, when all else fails, to
read the basic texts.

<p>
Not much more to say.  Have we been in touch since I made the move from the
staff of Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) to the staff of Sen. Chuck Hagel
(R-Neb.)?  
<i>((Briefly, at least to talk about that.))</i>
Snowe left the Foreign Relations Committee to take Cohen's seat on
Armed Services.  I wasn't out of a job, but since I didn't do her defense
work, there wasn't much of a job left for me.  Someone recommended me to
Hagel, I got an offer, and I made the move.  Hagel's a freshman Senator, but
through a process that is too complicated to easily explain, managed to join
the Foreign Relations Committee in the 4th ranking slot (ironically, the slot
Snowe would have had if she had stuck with Foreign Relations).  He is an
amazing person, and I am very happy with the change.

<p>
That's it for now.  Talk to you later (knowing me, probably considerably
later),

around the world than cricket.
What hasn't happened yet is that people haven't realized that
Latin Americans play the sport better than the Americans,
as you have realized about cricket with respect to the Indians.))</i>
Sorry I can't see why anyone would watch college sport.
Just seems very odd.
<i>((I can't explain it to you.
Perhaps in Britain it is still all tied up in your class system.
Anyone can get into American universities.... and some view that
as a problem.))</i>
Sport is a fair indicator in the difference between America and Britain.
American sport seems to have sold its soul for TV cash.
To be fair, that is happening over here.
So far Soccer matches can still end in draws.
Sledging and trash talking seem to be the same thing.
I'd like to see it outlawed.
<i>((Well, I'd like it to stop.
I'm not entirely sure outlawing it is the way to achieve that.))</i>

<p>
The Spice Girls?
Have you heard them?
<i>((Yes.))</i>
Have you seen them?
<i>((No.))</i>
Anyway, how old are you??
<i>((I turn 40 later this year.))</i>
Melinda Messenger?
I can only assume you've never seen the Sun and other papers of that ilk.
Now don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the unclothed female
form, but in a family newspaper?
I'm not into porn anyway.
The pictures can't even claim to be erotic.
I'm sure you can find one of these papers if you want.

<p>
I'm not sure if I recommended the Vega album but I did include
``World before Columbus'' on the tapes I sent you.
<i>((You certainly did.
And soon after that, I bought the album.))</i>
It's certainly a fine album.
Vega has many imitators but she is a unique artist.

<p>
Cardiff to Nottingham by train?
<i>((Yup, the ``direct'' route is not direct in the sense of 
being fast.))</i>
Well novel.
Having said that you would have passed through many towns and millions
of people.
Map the UK on to a map of the US and then consider it contains
55-60 million people.
As I say, it's a concept of scale.
<i>((Agreed.))</i>

<p>
One day I'll have to visit America but I won't go anywhere near Florida.
I'm tempted by New England.
Oh why are Americans so friendly??
<i>((Here in New England, we aren't.
I too try to stay away from Florida but find myself there anyway at
least a couple of times a year.))</i>
One of my annoyances in life is the Americanisation of Britain.
Does McDonald's taste as bad over there??
<i>((Actually, I think it's worse.
Your beef is naturally more tasty than ours.
But I wouldn't really know, since I never ate at any American chains
while in Britain, and never eat in McDonald's here.
I would tell you what I tell myself, if you don't like it, don't go there.))</i>

<p>
Well, since you asked, the election and the British ``economic miracle''.
Rich Goranson and Brent McKee were amazed that I stayed up all night
watching the election results.
<i>((I'm not, it's fun and exciting.
Over here, with our computers, you pretty much know everything by
Midnight, so there isn't much point, but I gather your balloting
is still a bit more primitive.))</i>
Rich said the result was obvious.
Well, maybe, but in 92 the polls predicted a Labour win and we
got the Tories again.
<i>((Only the overall result though, weren't the specific results
of interest, too?))</i>
I sat down to watch the coverage and was amazed at the size of 
majority the exit polls gave.
<i>((Are you seeing the phenomenon that we are seeing most
prominently in New England?
Enough people are refusing the exit pollsters that the results
are skewed.
Some people I know recommend answering every pollster question
as the exact opposite of what you actually did, but this last
election I just refused when approached.
I think this will spread here as people are tired of being told
by the media what they are doing and why.))</i>
I phoned my Dad who didn't believe it either but as the results
came in I was gobsmacked.
Constituencies that were safe Tory seats fell.
At work the next day we were saying ``can you believe Hove went Labour!!''
In hindsight it had to happen.
The Tories believed Europe was the main issue (they still do) but it
was all about the NHS, education, and job security.

<p>
I think the left in this country has missed the boat.
The left in the Lobby certainly has missed what Thatcher did.
Love or hate her (and I hate her!!) Thatcher changed people's 
perceptions.
Thatcher made it much easier for people to own their own homes
and to invest in stocks and shares.
Essentially the left can't piss around with the markets because
many of its supporters have invested in it either through
endowment mortgages, unit linked pensions, PEPs/unit Trusts
or through shares of privatised utilities.
With a lot of Building Societies going public there'll be
a lot of new share owners.
For example one Building Society is ``giving'' me $6000 of shares.
<i>((Clearly, in an overused analogy, Blair followed Clinton
down the line of taking the ``non-conservative'' party toward
an alliance with the financial markets.
Once in, you would suspect that Blair would be very supportive
of continuing the changes.
I don't understand your banking system fully, but the thing
that I wondered why you didn't discuss was the changes in
regulatory oversight between the Bank of England and your
government regulatory body.
Perhaps, this is just a move toward the American system where
our Federal Reserve is not also a general bank, operating
in the market as well as regulating it.
Historically, the Bank of England has been that, but as I understand
it, no more.
Still, your markets and commentators (from the view I see through
the BBC World Service) seemed a little concerned.))</i>
For good or ill Thatcher changed the rules.
She targetted 70% of the population and engendered a society
where they are significantly better off hence they go to Florida.
The problem is the other 30%.
Labour's traditional view was we want to raise taxes to help 
the poor and of course most of us being greedy bastards said sod off.
Blair has realised that he had to get power and then keep it.
If Labour can convince its supporters that the best way of
helping the poor is by wealth creation, then it will do well.
I'm sort of optimistic.
The Tories seem to be lurching further to the right.
I assumed you were being sarcastic about the British economy.
Actually with a bit of job security it could do well.
<i>((Um, saying what?
The US view, with all the rest of what you said having already
set in over here, would be that you don't need job security
like that.
This is debatable, but ``Me Inc.'' is pretty well set at the
corporate level.
We're even trying to implement it as the mindset in our
government agency.))</i>

<p>
How is the American economy?
The American stock market has gone bananas.
I keep hoping the Nikkei will do the same.
<i>((Uh huh, have Japanese investments??
Everything in the US economy will go well for a few more years,
then we are in trouble as our first wave of baby boomers (born
1945-1950) start retiring.
Then things become a whole lot more uncertain.))</i>

<p>
Well I've waffled on again.
Hope you and the family are well.
<i>((Hanging in there....))</i>

<p>

<p>
PS Can you believe it snowed today!!
<i>((Sure, it's been really cold here.))</i>
On Saturday it was in the 80's!!
<i>((We still haven't seen 80 degrees here.
It may be the latest 80 degree day in the year this century if it
goes much longer.))</i>
What a mad world.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Brad Wilson (May 28, 1997)</b>

<p>
Dear Jim:  See, I told you I'd write a letter!

<p>
My news is that I am finally on the staff of a daily newspaper. 
<i>The Express-Times</i> is a 55,000-circulation daily based in
Easton, Pa, a city of about 26,000, home of Lafayette College and 
about 65 miles from Philadelphia and 80 from New York. 
I am the paper's wrestling writer. 
In our area wrestling is beyond huge: last year 4 of the top 15 high 
school teams in the nation were ours, including #1 (Blair Academy,
Blairstown, N.J.). 
Easton High was the Pa. state Class AAA team champ and we had seven
individual champs in Pa. from Easton: Nazareth, Wilson (yup!) High and
Palisades. In New Jersey we had one individual champ and
the state Group 4 and Group 3 team winners. 
For a wrestling nut like me it is the ideal job in the ideal place; 
I can't wait for the season to start! 
Although there is a fair amount of out-of season wrestling news, 
I will also do Easton High football in the fall, field hockey 
(my favorite girls' sport!) and girls' soccer (well, it's OK) 
in the spring. 
I also do fill-in work, such as covering the Rangers-Flyers series 
in both NYC and Philadelphia when our regular guy was on vacation. 
That was fun; I don't lust after doing pro sports but I like hockey 
and the players are, generally, pretty nice, esp. Gretzky, 
Rod Brind'Amour, and Hextall.

<p>
The pay is OK, but that's not the point: the point is a) being on a daily; 
and b) more free time, at least in non-wrestling season. 
I actually have real days off now and since I am making a decent wage 
I have no need for a time-consuming second job
(although I plan to pursue some freelance opportunities). 
Once I get settled that should allow for more Dip (<i>VERTIGO</i>
comeback), more reading and more traveling to NYC and Philadelphia. 
My apartment in an old brownstone is right downtown, 1.5 blocks 
from the office and just 2 blocks from the park along the Delaware. 
My place is small but quaint with inlaid floors and a neat
old-fashioned bathroom. Easton is a old city - it was important 
during the Revolution - which has been in the dumps but is coming
back due to a) some tourist stuff, including a Crayola ``factory" 
downtown (Binney and Smith is headquartered here) and a canal
museum and b) an art-culture-antiques renaissance downtown. 
There must be 10 art galleries within walking distance from me, 
plus some nice restaurants, bars, and some neat shops, and 
it's clear educated, fairly affluent people are moving into this 
area (my downstairs neighbor is a Lafayette prof). 
And with New Jersey a short walk over a National Engineering Landmark 
(the 1895 suspension bridge between Easton and its `twin' city, 
Phillipsburg, N.J.) away, I can ignore Pa.'s stupid, expensive 
liquor laws as well as gas up for 15 cents a gallon less, on average. 
So I am delighted at these developments.

<p>
<i>((Great!
I'm trying to get your letter into this issue and also keep the
szine on time, but I can tell putting your life together will really
help your attitude, if nothing else.
Wow!))</i>

<p>
Dip news: I would like to host monthly open gaming at my place on the 
final Sunday of the month. The first meet will be
July 27 starting at 11 a.m. The gaming will stress multi-player 
diplomatic stuff: Dip, variants, Kingmaker, Civ, that sort of thing,
although a hex game or two is fine as well. 
All welcome! Pubbers please plug! 
<i>((Plug!!!!))</i>
The August date will be part of <b>VERTIGO GAMES XI</b> either in 
Easton or at VG's traditional location in Paoli, Pa. 
My phone #: 610-923-6610.
<i>((I'll assume you'll update that as you know more.
As you've been seeing in the szine, we've been getting together a Boston
area group on much too infrequent a basis lately, but your con has been
a real mainstay lately.))</i>

<p>
OK, now to issue 188:

<p>
1 am a low-church Episcopalian (converted from Presbyterianism during 
college and still have a Calvinist mindset at times)
myself (there's a church around the corner from me in Easton!) 
and I can't stand the fundamentalist nuts who have all the answers
and are so certain their way is the only true way. 
I used to work with one, from Tennessee, and even though Jasper 
(his name) is well-educated (he went to Penn) on certain issues he 
sounds like someone born before Darwin or Locke. It's quite amazing. 
His intellectual viewpoint on matters of faith is closer to that of 
snake-handlers than educated Americans. 
And you are so right - there's NO arguing with them.
<i>((I think in doing so it is always important to remember that it
is our human weaknesses that drive us toward that answer.
While I don't have that weakness, being very comfortable with the idea
that many things are beyond my understanding and don't have simple 
answers, I have other weaknesses that prevent me from being open
in other ways.
In other words, we can't have it both ways.))</i>

<p>
For example, we spent an hour one night (when we should have been working,
but...) arguing about homosexuality and the Bible. 
As you might expect Jasper cited all the Leviticus stuff. 
I tried to bring the argument back to what Jesus said about gays (nothing)
but he remained locked in Leviticus. 
I then asked if he believed in <b>all</b> of the Levitican 
strictures such as stoning adulters and the dietary laws. 
Seems to me if you are interpreting the Bible literally you can't really 
pick and choose what you like and don't like. 
His answer was confused and contradictory.
<i>((Actually, that might have been where he was most honest; since the
Bible is a much more complicated and contradictory document than some
people make it out to be.
Again, I think literal interpretations of the Bible are indicative of
our weaknesses, it isn't always very literal, so should we be?))</i>

<p>
I find much beauty and inspiration in the Book of Common Prayer 
and the Episcopalian liturgy. 
Those that don't are free to worship elsewhere. 
I am about as unevangelical and missionary as one could want and I 
dislike much of the touchy feely social nonsense that dominates the 
modern church. 
<i>((And some of that will get worse, not better, this summer in
Philadelphia at the national convention.
Unfortunately, this conflict played out in the open is part of the
danger that you have to face when you look at things in all of
their complexity.))</i>
Worship is about God and God's word, not domestic politics, 
the situation in Nicaragua or Haiti or abortion. 
I do like to sing, though. 
I found an old (1928 version) Book of Common Prayer in our newspaper's
library and have been reading that during breaks. 
Fascinating; the language is baroque but lovely. 
There's a renegade Anglican church near Philadelphia that still 
uses the old Prayer Book. 
My (very Episcopalian) grandparents used to talk about the beauty of
the old book and I now see what they mean.
<i>((Since the Episcopal Church is full of converts like us, I believe
that familiarizing oneself with those roots (from which the uniquely
Anglican look at worship comes from) is pretty important.
I spent some time in a renegade church like that and my present church did
some services out of various older Prayer Books as part of our 150th
Anniversary celebration last year that I co-chaired.
What's tough is respecting that beauty yet not treating it like another
form of fundamentalism.))</i>

<p>
I enjoyed meenng Iain Bowen at the one World DipCon I went to 
(Chapel Hill) and we had a good time together (say hello to him for me.)
<i>((Read this part, Iain!!!))</i>

<p>
<i>TAP</i> is great because it's like Old Home Week for us decrepit 
old farts. 
I mean on one page in #188 you name John Caruso, Vince Lutterbie, 
Steve Emmert, and Richard Weiss with Keith Sherwood, Mark Luedi 
and Mark Lew on the other page.
Then later, Bruce Mclntyre of all people! Lord, Lord. It's 1991 again! Or 1986. Or 1982.
<i>((Yeah, I'm kinda weird about that.
I guess it is the same idea, I want to respect and celebrate the past
while always living in the present.))</i>

<p>
I kind of wondered what happened to John and Kathy; I go back 
a long way with them both and miss them devoutly. 
I was looking the other day at a photo of <b>VERTIGO GAMES VI</b> ('92) 
that had John and Kathy (and Amanda!) in it with Cal White, 
Kevin Kozlowski, Tom Swider, Dick and Julie Martin, Jack McHugh, 
Chris Bailey, Tom Mainardi, Jeff Bohner, and Steve and Linda Courtemanche.
Sigh. Them was the days.

<p>
That brings up a question: what do you do when the hobby 
dries up around you? 
<i>((I've been trying to figure that out, while still going on anyway.))</i>
The East Coast Clique, for 20 years the heart and soul of a 
large part of the hobby, is gone. 
Look at that list above: gone, 
<i>((Well, Cal White hardly is completely out of here (see the game
below), but John and Kathy show no interest in coming back.
A lot of us are in that baseball league that John runs which keeps us
in touch.
Francine says hi, by the way.
She says she hasn't seen you for ten years or so (since she wasn't living
with John and Kathy for awhile there).
There are eight grandchildren now (Francine has two of them) and she
wants to get married first this time, before having another.
Keeping up with the Caruso's is an adventure.))</i>
as are Robert Sacks, Brady Richter, Mark Larzelere, Ed Wrobel, 
and most of the stray sorts as well. 
I, and Paul Kenny, are the only people left from its glory days more than
peripherally involved in the hobby (Mike Barno's still around a little bit;
Jack barely). 
<i>((If Jack has any brains, he'll marry Maria (who seems just right
for him) and then maybe he'll come back a little bit.
I talk to Maria much more than I talk to Jack....))</i>
If a hobby is a <i>social</i> pursuit in the sense that
you partake of it to do something with other people - which it 
is for me, for I have met many of my best friends through Dip even
if they have left Dipdom) - what do you do when those other people leave?
Suddenly there's no one to talk hobby stuff with, no one to go to 
Cons with, no one to come to your housecons. 
<b>VERTIGO GAMES</b> has survived due to fanatic loyalty from the
Courtemanches, Jack, Tommy Swider, Donna Higgins, and Paul and Sandy. 
But I'd love to see new people. It's been a long while since we have done so.

<p>
Frankly without the FTF side of things I don't enjoy the whole 
operation as much as I used to. Rail games and Magic may
have killed off the old FTF circuit altogether. 
Until you printed Buz's note in #189 I had heard not a word about DipCon. 
<i>((See Eric's bigger notice in this issue.))</i>
I mourn with a passion the death of ATLANTICON, one of the 
great weekends of the year every year. 
AVALONCON with its ultra-fanatic crowd and hostile-to-fun administration 
is no replacement. 
And since the Magic people took over ORIGINS they have gutted the board games. 
There's still GENCON, which can be a fun place to play games, but that 
Con has never been about board games, primarily. 
Dixiecon and fun don't go together in the same sentence.
<i>((You old Yankee, you....))</i>

<p>
What I really miss is the housecon circuit. Used to be you could spend 
your summer traveling about to hobbyists' homes for informal gaming, 
drinking, socializing and fun. 
The legendary PUDGECON, POOLCON, MADCON, whatever Gaughan called
his, PEERICON, BYRNECON(s), <b>VERTIGO GAMES</b>, CLONECON, BRUXCON, 
Bill Becker's K-CONs in Michigan, the Corbins' gatherings in Oregon, 
Eric Ozog's in Washington state, and, while not `cons', 
perennial large get-togethers for FTF Dip/gaming in Milwaukee, 
Chicago, Washington, New York, and Baltimore. 
You could meet people of all kinds, play whatever, eat, party, 
relax and frolic. 
These, I thought, were in many ways the heart and soul of the hobby.
<i>((Well, part of it is that the crowd has gotten older and
has not been well replaced.
The younger Dippers are playing only E-Mail and don't seem as likely
to attend cons.
You are one of the few left who doesn't have family commitments 
eating into the ability to run around to these cons.
I don't have much family, but running this szine the way I do takes
lots of time and energy, plus I have lots of weekend commitments to
other things.
We've had this discussion before, but I still think there is hope
and fun to be had.
Sitting and whining about the loss of the Good Old Days won't cut it.))</i>

<p>
Now, what's left? <b>VERTIGO GAMES</b> due to my sheer persistence; 
SHORECON (my other houseparty) will be back next year 
(I couldn't take a week off six weeks into a new job). 
That's it, I think. 
Did I miss any? 
(if so let me know about them ASAP so I can attend!)
<i>((You never came to any of our Diplomatic Incidents up in Boston
the last few years.
I know, you've been busy, but you'll make the next one, won't you??))</i>

<p>
I blame David Hood and his TurboFreak associates for this (and much else).
Hood would always say, ``Well, housecons are nice, but to really 
promote Dip we need more Dixiecon-type cons." 
I completely disagreed then and I do so now. 
Seems to me the hobby was healthier in the housecons era too.
<i>((Though I agree, there wasn't an era where one or the other
really dominated.
There are fewer of both kinds of Cons now, as you already mentioned.))</i>

<p>
Ah, enough memory-lane stuff. All I can do is hold my cons, 
try and enjoy myself and hope people show up. 
Like, for example, you, Jim-Bob, surely the most prominent 
hobbyist on the East Coast never to make a <b>VERTIGO GAMES</b>. 
Labor Day this year, as usual, in Paoli and (maybe) Easton. 
More info: write or call me.
<i>((You'll send it here so I can publish it, right??
As I think you know, the Labor Day timing has never really made it
for me.
For seven years, it was just as school was starting and the last 
three years I've been running a conference in Washington the week
of Labor Day.
As you recall, I don't tend to sleep much at Cons and thought I
couldn't do without crash time afterwards.
Plus my family always does something then that they try to get me to.
While I don't always join them, I find it difficult to go off to your
Con while not joining them.
My brother David is a spy here, so they would know....
still, I will give serious consideration to it this year.
Perhaps I'll come down by train and then just head into DC on Monday
night and the conference doesn't start until 1:00PM on Tuesday.
Will Jack come and bring Maria??
She sounds like fun!!))</i>

<p>
Hmmm, methinks Mr. Emmert and I wouldn't enjoy swapping record collections. 
I heard a song from Metheny's <i>Quartet</i> on the radio and I thought 
it was the best thing of his I'd heard in years, and I intend to buy it. 
My favorite Metheny record is ``Song X'', the one he made with 
Ornette Coleman. 
I adore Sibelius (esp. Symphony No. 4) and could live without Grieg. 
And if you, Steve, think Britten is atonal, I have some people for you 
to meet, such as Herr Webern, Professor Babbitt, Signor Berio, 
and Monsieur Boulez. 
<i>The Turn of the Screw</i> isn't all that terribly advanced for Britten, 
not nearly as much so as <i>Nocturne</i> for solo guitar
or the final String Quartet. However, there's nothing 
advanced about Britten's <i>Peter Grimes</i>, the greatest 20th-century opera. 
Give that a listen, Steve!

<p>
On my game openings/number of games: well, you are right; 
there are/were too many. 
However, this was not intentional. 
I honestly thought some would have ended circa 1994, 
and I took some orphans to be nice to Alan Levin, a friend of mine. 
<i>((Yeah, I have learned to remember that the opera ain't over
'til the fat lady sings on that issue.))</i>
Note that many of these games are just about over; 
I expect four or five will he done by Labor Day. 
<i>((See above...))</i>
Now, though, I bet too many games would be a problem more 
zines in the hobby would like to have!

<p>
I am hardly surprised that Edi Birsan and Tom Kobrin did well at 
World DipCon. I played wargames with Tom at UNC in 1996; 
he's a hell of a player and I helped get him involved in Dipdom. 
Birsan is a fine player, if (on my experience) a arrogant, 
holier-than-thou twit. 
World DipCon's scoring system sounds worthless. 
<i>((That's basically what I thought.))</i>
It sounds the organizers had little experience with FTF Dip.
Posting scores is like painting targets on people. 
<i>((Though if the scoring system is known and too straightforward
people can figure it out anyway.))</i>
This is not wise, people. 
But anybody with five minutes of GMing experience knows that. 
Year-to-play-to limits lead to people doing things that they would 
not have done - silly, unrealistic dotgrabbing, sheer stalling,
not doing something, like switching sides, 
that makes long-term sense but there's no long-term to worry 
about - just to increase scores. 
<i>((I was really struck by that at the World Dip Con I attended with
the time limit.
At least at Manorcon, they put in some randomness and don't tell you
from the beginning when it will end.
I forget just how they did it, I think they announce ``last game year''
just at the beginning of that year, so there's only one year of that
stuff.
Still, I was struck by how all the years of negotiating went out
the window, and even as great a player as Steve Cox turned into
a dirty little one dot grabber.))</i>

<p>
I firmly believe scoring systems should either be secret or so arcane 
(like Sacks') that people just play Dip, not Dip-scoring-system. 
As Sachs always said: ``Don't worry about the scoring system: 
if you do well in your game you will do well in the tournament." 
And to this day I have not played in better Dip tourneys than the ones 
Sacks (with help from Boardman, McHugh, Mainardi, and others) 
ran circa 1972-1994.
<i>((Yup, I've heard that from lots of people and give Rob't his
due on that point whenever I'm given the opportunity, even though
I never played in one of his tournaments.))</i>

<p>
However, the targeting of leaders is always going to happen to some extent.
It's obvious that if you get a win or a two-way in the first or 
second round, you are leading (at least in any scoring system that 
makes sense you are). 
Since word travels quickly about who won and got two-ways, well, 
those that did had best have their wits about them. 
This never stopped people such as Jim Yerkey from winning; 
Yerkey was and is a great player. 
My advice: stop whining and play Dip! 
Are you playing for fun or a worthless trophy and/or meaningless title 
(well, since the Triumph of the TurboPhreaks I guess everyone is 
playing for the latter, but..)?

<p>
Music '96: as my interests have become more classical-oriented I have 
not followed the pop-rock scene as much as usual.
However, here's 10 CD/tapes from 1996 that I enjoyed immensely and 
recommend: 

<p>
1) Patti Smith, <i>GONE AGAIN</i>. 
Patti was a heroine of mine in high school and this disc, 
while not quite <i>EASTER</i> or <i>HORSES</i>, is darn good. 

<p>
2) Pansy Division, <i>WISH I'D TAKEN PICTURES</i>. 
More poignant, funny gay pop-punk. 

<p>
3) Son Seals, <i>LIVE: SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION</i>. 
The top Chicago blues guitarist caught at his sizzling best. 
Tremendous sound. 

<p>
4) Johnny Cash, <i>UNCHAINED</i>. 
With help from Tom Petty this American icon creates roots music 
that has the true flavor of America. 
No faux posturing here! 

<p>
5) Beck, <i>ODELAY</i>. Wow.
Hard to imagine more original, more witty, or more danceable music. 
Essential; the CD of the year. 

<p>
6) Fred Anderson Quartet, <i>BIRDHOUSE.</i>
Free jazz with a heart. 
This one's intensity is hard to top. 
Anderson's tenor sax could tear your head off. 

<p>
7) Ornette Coleman, <i>SOUND MUSEUM</i> (two CDs). 
Masterful, far-reaching, free/harmolodic jazz from a giant of music. 
Not as gimmicky as <i>TONE DIALING</i>, his previous record, say. 
Acoustic music that believes jazz didn't freeze in 1967. 

<p>
8) George Clinton, <i>T.A.P., etc.</i>
Hey, why bother with anybody else's funk when the master has a record out? 

<p>
9) They Might Be Giants, <i>FACTORY SHOWROOM</i>.
It grows on you. 
``I Can Hear You" is brilliant and ``James K.&nbsp;Polk" a bolt from the blue. 

<p>
10) The Group for Contemporary Music: <i>SOLI ET DUETINI: 
THE MUSIC OF MILTON BABBITT</i>. 
Probably there are four people in America who liked this thorny,
atonal, serious, witty, demanding stuff. 
One solo is for snare drum! 
Still, more original and brilliant than almost anything else out there.
<i>((I like your comments because they always stretch me just a 
little further than I might have gone otherwise.))</i>

<p>
I was talking about Hobby Memory Lane a while back and then I read 
about ELP and Tull in #189 and I think I am in Music Memory Lane. 
Tull, to my mind, was washed up in 1974 and ELP, 
while I enjoyed a lot of their stuff, also has a lot to answer for 
for its part in creating the fetid swamp that was 1970's rock. 
<i>((You'll get no argument from me on that score.
I'm 39, almost 40, a little older than you are, I believe, 
and what I still can get nostalgic about was where some of this
music began, which is certainly prior to 1974.
That's why I was so careful to be talking about the Nice, 
who I really do like.))</i>
I agree with you about the dated comment EXCEPT I hope
you are NOT including King Crimson in that; 
Fripp/Belew/Levin/Bruford sound as fresh as ever, and their 
three early 1980's records
<i>DISCIPLINE, BEAT, THREE OF A PERFECT PAIR</i> - are 
what prog-rock should have been instead of overblown Yes, 
turgid ELP and anything Rick Wakeman was involved in.
<i>((Yeah, but I did kinda like Wakeman too for awhile there.
A Yes concert was the first concert I ever attended.
But that's just kiddie nostalgia.
And it's why I was talking about songs like ``Flower King of Flies''.
I still really like some of this music even today.
You probably have never heard some of the roots music that spawned prog.
rock.
Once punk hit, some of the retrenching (especially that Belew guitar
work with King Crimson, Levin's silky bass lines, Bruford's....
yeah, those three records really are that good!) was inevitable,
but of course, once the bombast quotient began to rise, it was destined to 
keep rising until it became a caricature of itself.
And for the most part, it imploded.
Perhaps we could poll people for their choice for the most overblown,
unlistenable, bombastic prog. rock album of the 1970's or if you include.
album sides, the Greg Lake side of <b>Works, Vol. 1</b> is right up there
as my choice.))</i>

<p>
That whole era - I was in high school then - in the late 1970's 
was awful musically; I used to listen to AOR-rock radio and live 
for Steely Dan, Bruce, and the Stones only to have to wade through 
oceans of Yes, Asia, ELP, Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd,
and all of that pompous puffery (that said I like some Floyd, 
although Dick Martin's comment <b>re</b> Floyd, `music to slit your wrists 
by', is true). 
<i>((But what of Joy Division??
You remember the days when this szine was full of cheap Ian Curtis digs??))</i>
I thanked God then and still do thank God for the Pretenders, 
Elvis Costello, the Sex Pistols, Blondie, the Ramones, the Dixie Dregs, 
George Thorogood, Johnny Thunders, David Johansen, Prince, and all 
the others who freed us from prog-rock!
<i>((Hey, I was there and saluted it right along with you, 
as I'm sure you recall.
I took over this music commentary duty for the hobby from Scott Hanson
right in the middle of all of that.
Remember the five page party tape descriptions??))</i>

PLAYLIST: Bernstein/NYPO: Mendelssohn, SYMPHONY No. 3; SYMPHONY No. 5; 
RUY BLAS overture (Lenny seemed less interested here than usual, 
but still solidly done); Solti/CSO: Bartok, CONCERTO FOR ORCHESTRA 
(1981 version; fine, fine all around. Gutsy playing and splashy conducting.)
Kurt Sanderling/Berlin Symphony: Shostakovich, SYMPHONY No. 8 (for my
money this is the best of these (yes, better than Solti, Previn, Jarvi, 
or Slatkin) out there with maybe the exception of Mravinsky.
Sanderling's interpretation is grim and unsettling and the orchestra has 
to really push itself, resulting in a memorable CD and a mid-price to boot!)

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>The Colonial Diplomacy game opening is now active!
I realize that it has been awhile, so I'm not even sure if you're
all still interested.
Please send me the $15 game fees now.
$10 gives you a life of the game sub, a bargain at twice the price
and it holds EVEN after you are eliminated.
The other $5 is for the NMR insurance calls, so please send along
your phone number as well.
Roland Sasseville ($15), Don Williams ($15), Rick Desper ($10 - E-Mail NMR
insurance), Terry Tallman, 
Luke Dwyer ($15), 
and Jonas Johnson ($15) have 
expressed interest in the Colonial opening. 
I have a request to call the game ``Show Me the Money'' and so I shall,
and so you must do!
I have money from the five people above and a request for a random draw.
So it shall be.
Some others have expressed interest recently.
I will take the first seven people who get money to me.
I really only need one more as Terry is my publishing mentor and
cannot be denied a place by me.
Come on, who wants to play?

<p>
Conrad von Metzke currently is GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I am playing in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
David Partridge looks like he is going to sweep past me to victory
in that game.
Now there the black holes are random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change but will not start
until the 7x7 tourney is over.
That next NYEED game also will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am
convinced otherwise.
It is time to at least begin trolling for interest in this game,
even though it won't start for some time.
Reserve your place now, you get a life of game sub, and the game 
itself is FREE!! 
Otherwise Conrad is now the new editor and publisher of 
<i>Pontevedria</i>, the game openings listing, if you're 
interested in other game openings.

<i>Game Notes (firmly orbiting in the tropopause):</i>

<p>
1) Thanks to Lee Kendter, Jr. for the Round #5 Miller Number.
The HRC game name will apply to the entire game.
I still refuse to recognize the relevance of round by round winners.

<p>
2) I was missing three sets of orders for this game.
Come on, guys, your juices should be flowing MORE strongly,
not less, as the game lurches toward conclusion.
I think the game with the other rules will be a lot more fun,
but we must complete this one first.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-PLAYERS): Slight change of mind, and as Italy next
year I will be nuking SWEDEN in place of Rumania.
And Russia's four home SCs, of course.
The main reason is that Austria and/or Turkey may want to try
and grab Rumania from Russia, and I wish them well.

<p>
(DEADHEAD to CLASSICISTS): ``Arctic, wintry'' compositions?
The beat is kept by chattering teeth, with shivering on the
backbeat.
The melodic motif features an engine grinding once, failing to start,
and giving up.
Dramatic breaks between movements are highlighted by the sound of
a vehicle skidding on ice, seguing into metal-to-metal impact noises.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-WORLD): Since the subject of obscure Scandinavian 
composers has come up, how many have heard of Wilhelm Stenhammar
(1871-1927)?
Not me, until 11 April, when I heard his 5th string quartet played 
live at the South Bay Chamber Music Society concert.
It was announced as being sort of ``neo-Beethovenish'' but I heard
mostly ``neo-Mendelssohnish''.
Quite a well crafted piece, and I wonder if any of his works have
been recorded?
<i>((I'm not familiar with him, but he sounds like one of those
class of early 20th Century Scandinavian composers that were
retro from the birth of the atonal movements that Brad talks about 
above.
String Quartets and recordings of them are like weeds.
I'm sure someone has recorded them.
This is NOT my cup of tea, most of the time.))</i>

<p>
(THE ``MANIFEST HUBRIS'' THEORY): Jim didn't have to make enough
difficult predictions to build up mental toughness.
Thus he blustered with neither accuracy nor restraint 
concerning women's hoops.
<i>((Such blustering comes naturally to me as a Dip player.
I don't bet on games, so predictions are done for fun, to take
a rooting fannish position.
I firmly believe FIAWOL, which of course stands for ``Fandom Is A
Way Of Life''.
Go ahead, have at me!!))</i>

<p>
(BARNO to McBRUCE): Glad to see you're still alive!

<p>
(POPE-TSAR): ``For what you are about to receive, may the Lord make
you truly thankful.''
<i>((Are you sure that wasn't meant for me???))</i>

<p>
(THIS IS JIM-BOB'S PENALTY FOR ``UConn will still win it all.
Count on it, Mykey!''):
My editor when I was a <i>Speedway Scene</i> columnist, Bones Bourcier,
has had articles on NASCAR racing in the last two issues of 
<i>Penthouse</i>.
Nothing terribly new or in-depth, just good introductory stuff:
an interview of seven-time champion Dale Earnhardt (similar to the
piece Bones wrote for his previous home, <i>Stock Car Racing</i>
magazine), and a general look at NASCAR's boom in popularity.
His journalism for <i>SS</i> and <i>SCR</i> was excellent.
This is somewhere within www.penthousemag.com, I assume.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-FRIENDS): My brother is recovering well from his recent
heart attack, thank you, and hopes to return to work soon....

<p>
(MIKE to RANDY): What, no comments similar to the ``sappy bullshit''
evaluation that you gave those song lyrics a couple of years ago
when I wrote them?

<p>
(BOOB to MIKE): Nothing from Randy at all, what did you do to him?
Set a trap for him over there in Grant Village??

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-ENEMIES): ...but when my doctor heard about Brother's
heart attack, she not only doubled my dosage of beta blockers (for
high blood pressure) but started me on some cholesterol lowering 
drugs as well.
I'm taking so many different pills I may need a computer program
to keep track of them all.

<p>
(POOFREADER to EDITOR): Someone wrote ``exasperate the situation'' in
issue 188, apparently intending ``exacerbate''.
<i>((Got that distinction, Luke, just the kinda trick they try to
play in those SAT's...))</i>
Luke should note the word's root connection to ``acerbic acid'',
an amino acid found in most mushrooms and needed for the body's
synthesis of the enzyme tauroboliase.

<p>
(MIKE to JIM-BOB): You have good connections and information sources.
Would you please dig out the truth about ``the Men in the Black Suits''?
<i>((Huh???))</i>

<p>
(MIKE to RANDY): A couple of tourons from Butte argued the night of
April 27, resulting in the wife jumping off the Gardiner bridge
and falling 80 feet into the Yellowstone River, while I was a hundred
yards away in the Two Bit Saloon parking lot.
Surprisingly, she survived.

<p>
(BOOB to RANDY): And that was my 11th wedding anniversary day too.
I hope he isn't hinting anything... where are you, anyway??

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-ALL): There was a time when I was telling folks that it
would be a cold day in hell before I ever again subscribed
to KUSC-FM.
I was especially disgusted at Jim Svedja mouthing those platitudes
about ``the NEW sound of classical music!''
I regarded Jim Svedja as a turncoat traitor to the cause of classical
music, a running dog lackey of Bonnie Grice.

<p>
Even when KUSC announced a return to the all classical music format,
I refused to subscribe.
For one thing, there was more than enough non-classical music junk
remaining, especially on Saturday evenings.
Still is.
For another, was the change for real?
Had the tiger really changed its stripes?
Or was this a ploy to get money before returning to the crap format?
I still remember sending money when KFAC-FM was bought out, and KUSC 
promised nothing but classical music, then finked out.

<p>
Well, Jim Svedja provided the cold day in hell.
Well, maybe not that cold, and more the Finnish Underworld than the
Christian Hell.
KUSC was having yet another fund drive, trying to lure suckers like me
to subscribe.
Jim played ``Swan of Tuonela'' with Mitch Miller on the English Horn,
and offered the CD as a bonus to those who subscribed.

<p>
What Mitch Miller CD, you may ask?
It seems this is a private pressing from Mitch himself, not
available to the general public.
It contains several performances of Mitch on oboe and english horn.
OK, these were mono recordings from before 1950, the fidelity was so-so,
and there was some hiss.
I scrambled to the phone and called in to subscribe.
The performance was THAT good.
<i>((I know, but boy do they have your number.
I'm continually struck as you play out this continuing story how the
market researchers have targeted you as a portion of the audience at
every stage as (to put a name on it) the ``serious listener''.
They don't really care about you and what you like, but they
do care about keeping your money, while trying for ratings by
going after entirely different audiences that will never care
enough one way or the other to subscribe.
Man, this non-commercial radio is damned commercial.
You don't think that approaching Mitch about doing this private pressing
was not TOTALLY designed to grab you?
Producing CD's is so cheap, and they didn't even bother spending the 
money taking out the surface noise and hiss, that it cost them very little.
Mitch probably ``donated'' the recordings as well.
For the length of the fund drive they wanted to convince you Serious
Listeners to subscribe (no matter how angry you were at them before)
and then plan to change the format in time for the next listener survey
period so they can attract the other listeners back who wouldn't
know the difference between an oboe and an english horn anyway.
I await the next letter, when you will be properly irate again.))</i>

<p>
The oboe has often been insulted as ``the ill wind that nobody blows good''
but that is not the case when Mitch plays his way through oboe concertos
of Vaughan-Williams, Cimarosa, Mozart, and Bach.
This CD will end up as my most valued new CD acquired in the year 1997.
And I am now OFFICIALLY a KUSC Subscriber, proud supporter of a mostly
classical music station.
<i>((Try to use that clout when they try to screw you over again.
I'll just be interested to see what happens.
Keep us informed.
I'm enjoying it, even if you aren't (at least half the time).))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The concession to Russia fails.
How about an RF?
It fails.
An AF??
It fails too.
An ARE???
It also fails.
The AGE draw is the new proposal.
Votes are due with Spring orders.
Anyone who fails to vote ages ten years!  

<p>
2) I'm calling Andy York as the standby, but I expect Randy will
be back.
I think we just got caught up in his move.
But if he doesn't, remember that in my szine you can make your
orders conditional on who is playing the Austrian position for
the Spring moves.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(MIKE to KENT): Delighted to see that you'll survive this game.
Fourth or fifth place in your first postal game isn't too bad;
certainly not as humiliating as the Steve Emmert Baby Picture
Fiasco, for instance.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE EMPIRE OF FRANCE): I have a feeling that your
hesitation towards the Empire of Russia goes much deeper than you would
like to admit.
The Empire of the Bear will win this War unless you commit immediately!
You have already stated how you feel about honor.
I believe you may have joined with those conquering hordes and
perhaps you think you can join in the eventual glory!
That is why I propose that French Forces jump in immediately
and try to stop Russian aggression before it is too late!
(Your non-committedness may have lost us the War already!)
Your actions will tell us the fate of Europe shortly...

<p>
(MIKE to RANDY): Do you like getting all the way Dead?

<p>
(GERMANY to FRANCE):  That bounce in Belgium was a wake-up call.  You
CANNOT delay in going after Russia, or there is absolutely no hope that
this game will continue long enough for you to do so sometime next year.
As you can see from my disband, I still invite you to grow at my expense,
but I'm not lying down to die just so Sherwood can walk to a win.  Are
you with us, or are you still playing by your own agenda?

<p>
(BARNO to SHERWOOD): Sorry, I thought Randy was warmed up enough to
give you a good game instead of being just so much cake on a platter.

<p>
(FRANCE to RUSSIA): I'm voting for the RF proposal.
Together we shall win.

<p>
(MIKE from this DANK WELSH DUNGEON to RANDY): Ha, ha, ha, 
ha ha ha, ha hee ha ha, etc.

<p>
(CALHAMER-SKYWALKER): You are correct, Pollard cannot win this game by
06.  If he doubles his centers every year from here on out, he'll win in
5 years.  Of course, he'll need units, which means he'll need home
supply centers, of which he has naught.  So winning will take him 18
years.
In either case, your grasp of the rules is impressive, if not the
players' names.

<p>
(SOFTWARE ENGINEER to LAWYER): Remember the first rule of Diplomacy:
strike for position in the spring, centers in the fall.  Your move to
Gal was brilliant, but mistimed.  Someday, when you learn these simple
lessons, you can aspire to the level of play demonstrated here by our
strong second finisher.

<p>
(FRANCE-GERMANY): It makes it all easier for Russia to win when
you tell me one thing, and then do another.
You treat it as if it is my fault Russia is doing well.
I didn't let Russia stab me take four of my supply centers.
Nor have I had any opportunities to stymie Russia's efforts.
I have been busy fighting off the fools who stabbed me.

<p>
(RUSSIA to GM): Shouldn't I get three builds for Munich?  After all,
according to last issue's map, Munich had three supply centers.

<p>
(GM to RUSSIA): Yeah, that would have been cool, but where would you
have put the units?
I haven't seen too many people building four units in a season.
Obviously, only you have the kahunas to do it.
As for the ``extra supply centers'', I thought ``fer shure'' that
Randy had dislodged you; lucky for you, I caught the error without
having Allan Calhamer have to explain the rules to me.

<p>
(KEITH-MIKE): Geez, Mike, even I don't remember what I got on the SAT's;
how can you remember what I got?  That brings us to an interesting
question, one that perhaps we can belabor for the remainder of the game:
what classes that you took in high school were most worthwhile/do you
still use today.  A sobering thought, and one in which (if we don't
pontificate too strongly) Luke may take heart.  I'll start:

<p>
(KEITH): I took Advanced Placement (college prepatory) English, Physics,
History, and Math (calculus).  History and Math have pretty much
atrophied.  Physics is still good for parlor tricks and Jeopardy
questions, although that may be some college physics mixed in.  The
English classes, mostly literature (but with vocab mixed in to help with
the SATs), are a joy that stay with me to this day.  Being well-read in
the classics turns out to be more important in my everyday life than
finding the volume of a function spun about an arbitrary axis.  The only
class more valuable that I took in high school was typing.  I had an
extra semester, and it came down between typing and auto shop.  Both
were skills I could use the rest of my life.  I opted for typing because
it was something I could use right away at college.  Now I type everyday
for a living.  The English classes, by the way, have nothing to do with
the way I make my living: they just make my life fuller, and I like
using vocab like ``plethora," ``dearth," and ``raison d'etre" in my
technical documents, even if nobody else knows what I mean!

<p>
(BOOB): I'll go next, I liked my English classes too; for basically
the same reason.
If I could write better, I would have become an English professor.
I love studying poetry, but I can't memorize it worth a damn;
probably related to the reason I can't write well enough.
Also the ``Social Studies'' classes, especially the year we
focused on Europe ;-) and the one on US government.
I don't really remember much science, and while I use lots of
mathematics in my work, I remember very little geometry or
trigonometry.
Of course, the most important thing I learned in high school was
computer programming on old IBM 1620's, early Wang's, and 
Prime minicomputers (which were ``huge'' in present day terms).
I also used the early precursors of the Internet in the early
1970's to bop around to other computers. 
I don't remember exactly what I got on the SAT's: something in
the 700's math and in the 600's verbal is about all I recall.

<p>
(LUKE-MIKE AND ANYONE WHO CARES): I got a 650 math and a 590 verbal.
It's not bad, but I wanted over a 1300.
Therefore, I am taking them again in the fall.
<i>((Stick with us, kid, and these seeds shall fructify in the fall.
See Keith's ``words'' above and add this one:  fructify -
``To bear fruit or make fruitful or productive'', the usual context
of the word is in a literary sense, as your goal to increase your
verbal score indicates.))</i>
 
(RUSSIA to GERMANY(STRIKETHRU) LOWLANDS+GALICIA): Your pathetic offer to
remove A Gal if only I don't eliminate you and help you survive against
France is flatly and forthrightly rejected: do your worst!  Have a
little backbone, man.

Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Dick Martin, and Vince Lutterbie
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is presently
missing, so I am running low on standbys here...).
Someone find Mike Mills!!
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''

3) It is proposed that anyone failing to submit press for two consecutive

Vote on this with your Winter orders.

<p>
(ZAPPA): The poodle bites...
The poodle chews it...
C'mon frenchie!

<p>
(TURKEY-FRANCE): Paul, Paul, Paul.  It's so unlike you to mistime a stab
so.  Why prick your victim in the spring instead of maiming in the
fall?  Alas, strike too soon in the spring, and your supposed victim can
lash back in the fall.
<i>((Methinks, you were gloating for some reason...))</i>

<p>
(LEXICO-MANCER to LEXICOGRAPHER): I assume you meant ``pass by acclimation'';
acclimation is when the coyotes get so used to people-food that they
stop a car and come to the window looking for handouts.

<p>
(KEITH to TERRY): I'm only allying with the Good Italians to further annoy
you, surely a worthy goal!

Superstition and Misogyny''?
``Why I Determine My Own Values Instead of Subserviating Myself to a
Temporal Hierarchy which has Violated Every Tenet of that Nazarean
Carpenter''?
Relax, I'm not writing it.
Unlike many past and present exponents of Christian doctrine,
I don't insist that any beliefs not mine are evil or wrong.

you to publish a vast eruption of chaos.

(TERMINEX TURKEY): We tried to exterminate the rodent-like sex ghod from
Trieste, but a new group of them sprung up in Budapest.  If at first you
don't succeed, try, try again....
<i>((Now, do they go to Rumania and survive, or slink off the board?
Stay tuned and see.))</i>

<p>
(more MIKE to JIM-BOB): Don't get me wrong; my views on interpersonal
relations tend to agree with Jesus' (though not Yahweh's, Torquemada's,
nor Ralph Reed's).
Both objective (quantum physics) and subjective factors, though,
lead me to a more nearly Taoist than Christian view of the universe.
A mountaintop with trees growing out of cracks in a rock face
makes a better temple for me than does a city building with
a statue of someone being executed for challenging the powers-that-be.
<i>((I don't necessarily disagree with that.
Currently termed ``post-modern'' views of Christianity (which I have
affinities for but don't completely embrace) are pretty close to that
view.  Those post-modern views are definitely influenced by Eastern
philosophic ideas.  They also make a big point of denouncing the
rape, murder, and pillaging done in the name of Christianity,
not by God, but by men - mostly.))</i>

<p>
(BARBARIAN PRESS):  The barbarian looks around the confines of his cell and
notes the duck just beyond the bars.
	
``Well, are you going to be of use or what?"
	 
``Well," muttered the duck, ``I would except for this honking big
chain the Turkish Lap Poodle slipped around my ankle (sigh)."
	
From the darkness in the far back of the cell a dulcet voice
mutters, ``Can't a red haired barbarian warrior maid get some piece and
quiet??!!"
	
Both the Barbarian and Duck turned slowly.  There before them
reclined the form of Red Daphne...

<i>Selected Broadcast Press (1905):</i>

<p>
(FRANCE):
With great regret, the French government has seen the security situation in
the Mediterranean deteriorate to an alarming extent.  France has employed
all peaceful means at its disposal to bring about a settlement of the
disputes engaging the southern powers.  These efforts have failed to secure
the much-sought peace among Italy, Austria, and Turkey.

<p>
In light of these events, and fearing that the balance of power has shifted
in a dangerous direction, France has sent peacekeeping forces to the
region.  France asks that Austria refrain from attacking Italy's positions
so that negotiations leading to a permanent settlement can begin.  France
requests the Turkish government to hold its fleets behind a line extending
from the southern tip of Greece to the island of Crete so as to aid the
confidence-building measures.

<p>
France's troops will secure civilian populations against attack and ensure
the timely delivery of humanitarian relief.

<p>
French troops will engage in combat only if the attacks on Italy continue.
In that case, France will intercede to ensure the stability of the region.

<p>
With all due respect,

<p>
Jean Barquemondieu,
Prime Minister of the 23rd Republic (more or less, but who's counting?)

Hmm..those sailors must have been a little confused.  :)  Rick

<p>
(BOHEMIA DAILY; DATELINE:  PRAGUE):
Tsar Faz, making his last-ditch stand with the troops in the field, sent
the following samizdat literature to the homeland, in the hopes that the
memory of Russian arms will spark a country-wide fire against the hated
occupiers:

<p>
Friends!  Countrymen!  Russia stands occupied, but not pacified. Our
troops run retreated, but not defeated.  And our neighbors talk so
nice-but prove themselves lice.   We Russians refuse to be cowed into
submission by those who have imperial dreams of repression.   In fact,
things are looking bright for Russia!  We have hired the services of
Jeanne Dixon, Clairvoyant to the Stars (and to Rasputin).  She brings
interesting news.  Says Jeanne:

<p>
``In the East, the A/T monolith approaches the end of its `free ride.'
Tsar Faz, wisely trading space for territory, has managed to give up all
his space, and now has lots of free time. (Who said this guy couldn't
play?!)   And the rapacious ones  now meet each other, with no Russian
buffer to separate them.  With no Russkies nearby, the Turkish Gobbler
will hunger for another turkey to fill its plate.  While the German
(Pitt's-)burghers look tempting, The Perry Mason of the West will instead
opt for Greece-y `flank' stakes (made in Rumania by Vlad the Impaler and
in Bulgaria by Crazy Eddie BeerSon)."

<p>
Will this satisfy the Turk after hours of filing habeas corpii and
motions to suppress? Jeanne knows, but she ain't tellin'.

<p>
She continues with haiku poetry to describe more Balkan issues:

<p>
I feel excessively bored

<p>
By the ramblings of the Dark Lord

<p>
BirSauron

<p>
Inside his castle high

<p>
He queries the Russian

<p>
``Why?

<p>
Why do you hit me, after all I propose

<p>
Offers so vague you can't see your nose?

<p>
I never reveal my true self

<p>
(I'm such a mischieveous little elf!)

<p>
And still you refuse to listen..."

<p>
...And the treetops now glisten

<p>
I see red blood from red blocks

<p>
Burnt Vienna pastries

<p>
Says Jeanne:  ``Expect less than four

<p>
I can see three from from here in TRI

<p>
This is the end...the end, my friend"  ((oops, sorry, that's Jim
Morrison))

<p>
Ms Dixon, having analyzed the Balkans, turned her gaze to the North.  She
opines:
In the North, I feel tension.  The old adage, ``Pitt, or get off the pot,"
is coming to fruition.   A black shadow over central Europe hangs like a
bad temperature inversion.  However, winds of change are blowing from
within.  The winds blow contrary to each other, creating a tempest.
First they offer warmth and stability to white clouds (or are they
blocks?) in the north, and then the winds grow cold, bringing thunder and
rain. Yet in the center of the storm, units sit placidly, ignoring other,
eastern, gales brewing.
Are we witnessing a bell-weather shift in the North and the center?
Jeanne says:  No way.  Our forecast calls for continued hot air, lots of
stagnation, and above-average chatter about how wonderful it would be to
see Eng and Rus stay in the game and help versus the east.   And then it
will rain again.  ((Jeanne thinks she sees Willard Scott in a yellow
slicker, somewhere near Berlin, but she can't be too sure; too much
cloudiness up north.))

<p>
In the West, Jeanne sees resignation on the faces of the Italians, for
they sense that their Russian jockstrap (the ``24-hour support piece") has
finally lost most of  its elasticity.  And Jeanne mutters something about
``foxes in henhouses" when she stares over the horizon, beyond Italy to
the West.  Russia can only assume her intent.

<p>
Tsar Faz, having thanked Jeanne Dixon (and then arming her and sending
her to the trenches) concluded with these words - quite possibly his
last printed material:

<p>
Russians!  Stay true to the cause. Despite some bungling among our
staffs, we remained true to our friends, and tenacious against our foes.
The same Riders of the Purple Sage who criticize our moves now feel
themselves losing some power, unsure if and when it will return.  Others
will grow  greedier and clash with their fellow vultures.   Russia will
continue to aid its friends until the bitter end, and then beyond the
grave.  You may kill the body, but never the spirit.

<p>
Rasputin!  Bring me those voodoo dolls of the players; let's give them
some MORE backaches and broken hands.  Stab Tsar Faz, will they (jab)?!
Ha!  Ya-ha!  (jab, jab)  Take that, swineherds!   cackle,
chortle...((double-jab on Hohn's shrugging shoulders))...saliva begins to
drool down the Tsar's chin as he maniaically jabs the dolls...

<p>
We now return you to your regularly-scheduled programming.

<p>
Tsar Faz sends regards to the gamers and the observers over this fine
weekend!

<p>
(FRANCE):
With great concern, the French Foreign Ministry hears rumors of the
Kaiser's conspiracies with the Sultan.  Could, as it has been claimed, the
Sultan really have ordered support for Germany's capture of St Petersburg
``by mistake?"  Is this conceivable?  Do the ambassadors to the French
capital imagine that our Foreign Minister has fallen off the truffle cart
only yesterday?  

<p>
(KAISERPITT):
KaiserPitt heard a troubling rumor over his tea and strumpets the other day.
To wit:
<i>the French Foreign Ministry said:
Do the ambassadors to the French
capital imagine that our Foreign Minister has fallen off the truffle cart
only yesterday?</i>

<p>
KaiserPitt instructed Ambassador Skidmarck to say:
``Mais non, mon ami!  We believe it was a wagon that your Alien Minister
fell off of.  What other reason could he have for doubting the peaceful
intentions of your Germanic brethren?"
To which,

<p>
(FRANCE):
The Foreign Minister, it is reported, said to this
transparent deception, ``I wave my privates in your general direction!"

<p>
(KAISERPITT):
Ambassador Skidmarck was unimpressed.
(mostly because there was nothing to see...a common problem, we understand,
for most men of the French persuasion)
The Ambassador did complain of a strong smell of rotten cheese, however...

<p>
(FRANCE):
France pleads with Germany to stay the course.  The Sultan is not to be
trusted.  His favoritism for Bir-Sauron, the failing monarch of the
Ostreich, knows no rational bounds.  German aid and comfort to the heretics
in Anatolia can mean only one thing: Austria and Turkiye will rule Europe
with an iron fist.
Kaiser, rethink your strategy.  The Future of the World depends upon it.

<p>
(RUSSIA):
Live, from Russian-controlled Bohemia, it's time for the weekly talk
show, ``Interview with a Vampire."  As you know, each week we try and
find a local Balkan bloodsucker to discuss matters of regional
importance.  Today's guest is that noted chameleon and Master of Fluff,
Transylvania's Own, Edvard BirSauron (cheers and applause resonate).

<p>
Host (H):  Welcome, Edi.  Why are you looking over your shoulder, and
what's that sound?

<p>
E:  Glad to be here.  Oh, the sound seems to be...ah...geez, it sounds
like someone's sharpening a knife on a whetting stone.   Hey, what's
that lawyer doing in the audience?!

<p>
H:  Well, anyway, BirSauron, welcome again to the show.  As the regional
vampire, what's been happening in your *neck* (haw haw!) of the woods?

<p>
E:  Oh, much excitement.  Let's see...I write a lot of press about dark
horses and gloomy fog, and that always seems to get people excited.  And
don't forget my reams of vacuous press.  To misquote Sir Winston
Churchill,  ``Never in the annals of gaming has so little been said in so
many pages by so untruthful an individual."   I also make a lot of phone
calls, and I'm pretty good at telling my neighbors about bonehead moves
they make, all the while offering nothing constructive in return.  Oh,
did I mention a lot of fluff in my move proposals for (chuckle)
``allies?"

<p>
H:  Uh, yeah, BeerMan, you did.  But let's move on.  What does the
future hold for your nation?

<p>
E:  I envision everything will change when we eliminate the pesky
Russian in Bohemia.  As you know, Tsar Faz has been a pain-in-the-NECK
ever since the mutual stab we pulled on each other in 1902.  I managed
to ``lie low" (in the coffin during daylight) and let him take the rap
for stabs and non-supports of Turkey and England, and have managed to
rule the night.  And let's not forget the perpetual lying schtick that
A, T and G have been giving him.  Yep, in a couple more turns our
combined half-dozen units from three nations will finally eradicate the
little cockraoch, and I'm sure Austrian fortunes will only rise after
that.  Why, I'm working a half-dozen deals with I, F, G, E and even guys
who haven't done a game-start yet.  You just watch.  I'll rise from the
grave with even more force soon - they don't call me the Teflon Count
for nothing.

<p>
H:  But what of your neighbors?  With Tsar Faz but a memory, who's next
on your hit parade?

<p>
E:  Well, I've done my usual thorough PsychoProfile checks, estimated
projected gains in synch with the lunar cycle, and have asked my Dark
LordUnderlings for advice.  And I'm sure we'll have that answer in a few
mo....((yells off-stage)) ``Hey, hey!, stop grinding that blade on the
whetting stone!"  Ok, where was I?

<p>
H:  We were discussing future Austrian plans.

<p>
E:  Oh yes.  Well, never mind!  Suffice it to say that I've offered
everything to everyone, and I'm sure that in saying nothing, I've said
everything.  And already the offers are flowing in.  Yep; just waitin'
on the best one, is all.  As the old song says, ``The future's so bright,
I gotta wear shades."  But I would say that - I'm a vampire (yuk yuk)!
((audience chuckles absentmindedly))

<p>
H:  Mmm-hmmm.   Would you mind if we interviewed your fellow bloodsucker
and game honcho, Hohn Cho?

<p>
E:  ((fidgets)) Well, sure.  Not a problem.  Well, actually, it is a
problem.  Ever since the Elvis Presley Imitator took his bad nose job to
small claims court, Hohn's been, ah, busy.  I'm afraid he's out of
pocket, I haven't talked to him since 1902.

<p>
H:  Ok, let's skip Hohn.  Final question.  if you could be King of the
Board for a day, what would you do?

<p>
E:  Oh, easy question!  I'd give peace and free centers to all.  I'd
re-ally with Russia and Italy, and invade Germany, like I promised in
Winter 1900.  And I'd tell Pitt to lay off England and Russia; he's such
a ``pitt-stol."  And then we'd end the game with a 7-way and write great
press about it afterwards.

<p>
H:  Ah, Edi, your nose is growing awfully huge.  Folks, that's all the
time we have.  Tune in again next week, when ``Interview with a Vampire"
profiles Count Armm-Pitt of Germany, sharing the chair with his siamese
twin, ``John the Holder" of France.  Should be a hum-dinger of a show.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) In a gaffe of epoch shattering proportions, your lame GM misplaced
Don's press for last season (along with some orders and press from
Harry Andruschak).
I can't blame it on my cats as I just put it on a pile next to my
bed with some Brit szines for ``bedtime reading'' and forgot it was
there.
I print it this season while consuming humble pie across the centuries.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(OFFICIAL FRIEDRICH NIETZSCHE QUOTE OF THE SEASON): ``For one should not
overlook this fact: the strong are as naturally inclined to <i>separate</i>
as the weak are to <i>congregate</i>; if the former 
<i>((i.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;the strong))</i>
unite together, it is only with the aim of an aggressive collective 
action and collective satisfaction of their will to power, and with
much resistance from the individual conscience; the latter,
<i>((i.&nbsp;e.&nbsp;the weak))</i>
on the contrary, <i>enjoy</i> precisely this coming together-their
instinct is just as much satisfied by this as the instinct of the
born ``masters'' (that is, the solitary, beast-of-prey species of man)
is fundamentally irritated and disquieted by organization.
The whole of history teaches that every oligarchy conceals the
lust for <i>tyranny</i>; every oligarchy constantly trembles with the
tension each member feels in maintaining control over this lust.
(So it was in <i>Greece</i>, for instance: Plato bears witness to it
in a hundred passages-and he knew his own kind-<i>and</i> himself...)''
From Section 18 of the Third Essay in the <i>Genealogy of Morals</i>.
All italics, except mine in double parens, are from the original.
Take that Berry Renken (Berry has been arguing the ``carebear''
philosophy to extremes lately, in my opinion).
This book continues to lend itself to interesting Diplomacy oriented
quotes.

<p>
(DANTE to NIETZSCHE): Hel mezzo del cammin' di nostra vita me vitrovai
per una selva scura dov'e' la via diritta era smaritta.
Roughly that translates to
``Reading your stuff makes me firmly believe I missed the boat and that
there are, truly, <i>eight</i> circles of hell.
Oh, Beatrice!''

<p>
(GREEN BLOCKS-GRAVY SUCKING WHITE BLOCKS): You're sorry you had to
stab Dave?
Oh, boo-hoo...
give us a break, hey?
You didn't have to, you wanted to.
And I suppose you hated attacking Jonas in Spring 1901?
And I know you still haven't gotten over violating the neutrality of
Romania, Sweden, and Norway.

<p>
(ITALY-AUSTRIA): Your survival instincts are awesome...
I just wish I hadn't run into the need to stab you.

<p>
(BOOB to LAME DUCK): Oh, come on, quit buttering him up, need some
more Wesson Oil??

<p>
(ITALY-GM): Shut up.
If Rothenheber can lie, so can I.

<p>
(ITALY-RUSSIA): All things considered, your stab went off pretty badly.
Yeah, you kicked my green butt out of (most of) Austria, but your 
effect on Italy was something less than devastating.

<p>
(ROME to PARIS): Stick with me, kid, and I'll make you a star.

<p>
(BOOB to ROME): One is tempted to add ...shooting across the heavens,
only to fizzle out over Eastern Europe...

<p>
(HISTORICAL NOTE to GM): Last season we had three annihilations and one
retreat... that also happened back in Spring 1906.
Bloody game, this.

<p>
(DON to JOHN): Hey, guy, let's get the press machine started and show
these guys how to really rock.

<p>
(BOOB to JOHN BOY): Hey, you and I know that you have tried NUMEROUS
times to jump start this bunch.
I have settled for the idea that this is a great game with generally
nonexistent press.
Nevertheless, hope springs eternal and if you would leap back in
with some press, you would meet with the eternal gratitude of the
Boobish GM.

<p>
(CALIFORNIA to RHODE ISLAND ROGUE): Does Emmert read this game?
<i>((How would you tell, you guys never write anything for
him to read??))</i>
Does he read at all?
<i>((Ah, that's another story...))</i>

<p>
(BOSOX FAN WEST to BOSOX FAN EAST): Here we go again...
as I write this, the Red Sox are only one game back... they'll 
tease us again for most of the season before collapsing in
a Bob Olsen-like heap.
Sigh... what a masochist...

<p>
(BOSOX FAN EAST to BOSOX FAN WEST): Why did you have to write that?
Immediately afterward, they spiralled into a deep May swoon that
they are just struggling to get out of.
Then, as you and I talked on the day after deadline day and they
struggled back from two deficits against the hated Yankees, you
had to go and hang up.
It took six more innings, but the Sox were finally torched in the 
fifteenth inning!
Masochist indeed.

<p>
(DON to CHARLOTTE): Howdy, darlin'!
Can I interest you in a press exchange?
Sure, it might not be fun, but it could be worthwhile if
it makes Jim's life miserable.

<p>
(CHARLOTTE to DON):  I'm not at all sure what it might take to make Jim's life
miserable;  I've been working on it for years now and I don't have it quite 
right, but at least I'm not bored (much, very often), and it has proved a 
challenge.  Maybe a press exchange would work. . . maybe not.  Anyway, you're 
quite adorable (cute <i>and</i> smart, for what more could any girl beyond 
25 1/2 (or before) (or slightly after) ask?), so why not?  
Maybe you'll get lucky some evening and find me a little tipsy.  
And in a good mood.  Maybe like tonight.  

<p>
(JIM-BOB to DON): Yes, she really wrote that.
You have a achieved a first.
Her verbal response to me was something along the lines of
``perhaps, if it intrigues me and if I get bored this summer.''
She also said, ``I go for the ribald stuff'',
but I suspect you already knew that....

<p>
(WILLIAMS to PARTRIDGE): Your last letter to me was less
than gracious, and I must respond.
There was little dishonor to our war - we were never allied, and
we went to war with our swords, not back-stabbing knives.
When the A/I began to get the upper hand and your position
began to crack, you came begging for mercy and pleaded
to be a puppet.
Against Jonas' advice, I agreed.
Within a year, you had betrayed me and cut the barely attached 
strings.
Fortunately, I was able, with Russia's willing help, to stop
you from gaining too much.
On the turn before you were eliminated, you suggested I participate
in a silly convoy/attack which would have kept you alive at
Austria's expense.
Based on your previous treachery, I declined the opportunity to
undertake this foolishness and eliminated you, with Ed, instead.
<i>((rhyming probably unintentional, but still amusing....))</i>
Imagine my surprise when I read your full-of-umbrage letter 
calling me names and belittling me for being so petty as to 
eliminate you instead of setting myself up to be stabbed by you again.
You know what, Dave?
Kiss my green blocks!

<p>
(DON to HANK): I <i>still</i> think you should have attacked 
you-know-who in 1902.
Best of luck as you continue to wriggle in that nasty
Franco-Russian grape press.

<p>
(EUROPA EXPRESS to BOOB): Just to <i>prove</i> to you I have no life,
<i>((Worry not, I had nary a doubt.))</i>
here's an exercise that ol' Gary Coughlan used to indulge in - where
are the original units now?

<p>
 AUSTRIA: A BUD removed from BUL (W'03); A VIE now in SER;
F TRI annihilated in GRE (F'08).

<p>
 ENGLAND: F LON removed from YOR (W'04); F EDI removed from
NTH (W'04); 

<p>
A LVP removed from LON (W'03).

<p>
 FRANCE: F BRE now in HEL; A PAR now in KIE; A MAR now in RUH.

<p>
 GERMANY: A BER went otb from MUN (Sum'08); A MUN now in MUN;
F KIE annihilated in POR (F'07).

<p>
 ITALY: A ROM removed from SYR (W'06); A VEN annihilated in 
BUD (S'08); F NAP now in AEG.

<p>
 RUSSIA: F STP(SC) now in DEN; F SEV now in CON; A MOS now in RUM;
A WAR annihilated in BUL (F'04).

<p>
 TURKEY: A CON annihilated in BUL (S'02); A SMY retreated otb
from SMY (W'06); 

<p>
F ANK annihilated in BUL (F'05).

<p>
Farthest traveller so far - Germany's F KIE, which was destroyed in POR.
Longest, strangest trip so far - France's A PAR, which is now in KIE;
after a trip through PIC, BEL, WAL, LVP, YOR, and HOL.
Shortest trip so far - also to Germany, for A MUN, which went to RUH
for two years, stayed in KIE for three and a half, and then went home;
never even leaving the homeland.
Only France has all three original units on the board, Russia has 
three out of four.
<i>((As you discovered, I always keep the units in the same order
and add new builds on the front, so you can find the oldest units
by looking at the last few ordered units for each power.))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Past the last chance for end game statements!
This game really goes away next issue and life of the game subs end for
Rich, Brad, and Phil.
The default is to apply your NMR insurance to the sub until it
expires.
Tell me if you want to do something else.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>
<center><i>Endgame Statement for Austria (Brad Wilson)</center><br></i>

<p>
<p>Yuck. It started at a bad time for me and I never got going. 
I didn't write a lot - I did write Rich Shipley, by the way, and 
Stuart Lancaster, who pretended that I didn't, 
which made me mad - and I gave up quickly once I saw
that Randy and Jeff were out to get me. 
I especially lost interest with some of their, and Stuart's, 
unpleasant wisecracks and sarcasm launched in my direction. 
Not, on the whole, the fun experience I expected in <i>TAP</i>. 
My fault, mostly, but in retrospect, Mr. Jim-Bob, maybe brothers 
as R/T wasn't such a hot idea? 
Put my NMR fee towards my sub, thank U!
<i>((Perhaps not, and you're quite welcome.
I really would have preferred the draw putting them farther away,
but decided not to let it push me into manipulating the results.
As far as them being in the game, I could be wrong about this,
but I think I announced the game with: Stuart, Randy, and Jeff
want to be in this game.
Here's the deal, who wants to play with them.
And not to push your analysis too hard, but certainly the game
history in the big picture showed the three of them certainly
quite willing to stab each other - ultimately to Phil's gain
and their detriment.
I'm sorry you didn't enjoy the game as much as you might have,
but look on the bright side, it kept <b>TAP</b> coming to you
right through the lean years.
Welcome back!!))</i>

Silesia is part of Germany and I never gave you permission to

<p>
GSchenck39 of aol.com - CANCELLED!

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I mistyped Harry's order last time.
In actuality, I misplaced his entire set of orders and press
(see mea culpas with Don Williams above...) and recalled that
he had supported Austria and recollected it as supporting the
other unit.
Said orders are now found and verified.
The actual support failed since Michael was moving the Albanian
unit.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-GM): So, you didn't print my submitted Press in 
<i>TAP</i>-189?
<i>((Whoops....))</i>
Well, maybe some of it was in bad taste and you run a clean
family-oriented publication.
<i>((Not true, sir, you libel me!!
Bad taste NEVER stopped me...))</i>
BUT, my fall orders were to support the Austrian Army in Albania,
not Serbia.
<i>((Double whoops...))</i>
Please double check to confirm, and then inform Russia and Austria
that I did order the support they requested.
<i>((Done, but NOT the one they were able to use...
not having your order in front of me but recalling that you supported
him to hold, I made the logical, if flawed, assumption that you
were supporting the one that wasn't moving.
Silly me.))</i>

<p>
(STEVE to AMATEUR CHEFS): Hope you liked the succotash.  (Actually, I
should tell you one alternative that will make the tomatoes seem a bit
firmer:  Leave them out of the original mix and substitute a cup of water. 
After 20 minutes of simmering, drain the water, add the tomatoes, and
simmer for another ten minutes.)  Last time I promised a recipe for
pineapple-almond waffles, but there's really not much to that; you just
add about 1/3 cup drained, crushed pineapple and a half teaspoon of
almond extract to plain old waffle batter.  I came up with this idea while
lying awake in bed one night.  At first, I worried that the pineapple would
burn on the waffle iron, but they come out just fine.  It also smells
fabulous while it's cooking.  
Next month I'll give y'all my mint julep recipe. 
(Note to Jim-Bob:  This will no doubt cause a tremendous demand for
#191, so you might want to plan for a big press run.)
<i>((OOOOH, I'm scared.... this next one will ensure a REALLY big
press run.))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-EMMERT): As a matter of fact, I wore my kilt last 17 March,
and, when several pseudo-Irish asked why I wasn't wearing green,
I replied, ``does wearing a green swimsuit count?''
Now I didn't actually SAY I was wearing a green swimsuit, so is it my
fault they checked under the kilt and discovered I was marching true?
<i>((No, though one easily could claim you were being intentionally
misleading.
You don't say what the result of this was, or (of keen interest) whether
this was a mixed company of pseudo-Irish or not.))</i>

<p>
(EFG to AR):  Had enough, or do you want some more?
<i>((OOOOH, they're scared too....))</i>

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-BURGESS): For your interest, I enclose a copy of 
<i>Hoodwink</i>, now on its way to a fold, because it has the
rules for ``Democratic Diplomacy'' and my first thought was
that maybe you'd like to try it in <i>TAP</i>.
But with more consideration, I thought that it
might be even better to try it in the environment of the Internet.
<i>((Probably, I've seen the variant's rules before as well

they wanted to run it.
