<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website incorporating all subszines.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />  Web Page Address: /Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />I printed these last time.
And I tried to copy Mark Wightman's rules for running 23 Tunes, but the record keeping
turned into a real mess.  
When in doubt, get Dougie to do it, so Doug Kent is running 23 Tunes and I'm playing.
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES. You send Doug three tunes for the first turn, and 
then two tunes in each of the last ten turns for a total of 23. If you missed 
the first turn, you can still catch up by sending Doug five tunes this issue,
and guess on submitters to this issue of <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Actually, you can send all 23 tunes at once if you want to, but then you’ll
need to remember to guess everyone else's each month. 
Doug also is submitting his own tunes. 
After we're done, Doug would like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes 
players as possible, but this is not required.
Doug will be sending the winner his 23 Tune list. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list 
(Doug lists the submitters for you). 
For each list you get right, you get a point, you also can win bonus points
from Doug for really cool tune selections. 
That's it, not complicated. 
I share with Doug the hope that by starting this up, he'll get more to join.
So, put simply... you send in the name and artist of songs you really like or have special meaning to you. 
DON'T SEND THEM TO ME, send them to Doug Kent at dougray30 of yahoo.com.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Doug already has printed 3 of them the first turn, and will print 2 for each turn after that (you can submit that way, or send in
all 23 at once, or anything in between). Each issue Doug lists the songs for that turn, without revealing
who submitted which song. 
Doug also prints a list of who submitted songs (again, without telling you
which songs they sent in). 
Your mission is to match the people with the songs. Simple. 
I would note that he says "list" but there is no easy way to get someone's 
whole list, even when they have themes (as I do in my list, for example).
And Doug will be offering
other prizes as well, to be determined later. If you miss a turn, make it up by sending enough songs
to catch up with the other players (and the overdue songs will simply be revealed immediately).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! 
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we'll see what happens.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We will theoretically have four subszines going forward, from Dave Partridge, 
Doug Kent, Andy York, and 
Peter Sullivan.  But Dave Partridge is even farther behind than me
on finishing <i>Tinamou</i>, Andy York is working on 
By the WAY, but Peter is back active!  
Doug of course puts us all to shame otherwise.
This issue only has an <i>Octopus' Garden</i> from Peter with a game start.
Dave and Andy are working on getting back in the swing.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire szine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I have now tried to sign up all the players, some multiple times, but please check.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing so you get proper notification!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b>JIM-BOB'S BASEBALL PICKS FOR 2011 (why not be bold!)</b> 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL EAST: Boston, Tampa Bay, Baltimore, New York, Toronto;
Yes, the Yankees may not really fall that far, but I'll
be rooting for Baltimore that they do.
You all are following how us Boston fans are already
putting the Red Sox in the World Series.
That is premature by a country mile, but ya gotta love the depth
of this team.  
Even if Papelbon stinks up the joint (which is more than a bit
possible) there are MANY people behind him.
The backup outfielders in Pawtucket (Reddick, Kalish, and Nava)
all saw lots of action last year.
There a host of intriguing emergency starters, including Andrew
Miller, who shows signs of career resurrection after being rushed
too soon earlier in his career.
Jed Lowrie will be the best 1st, 2nd, 3rd, SS backup in baseball.
And when you have Jason Varitek as your backup catcher, you're
doing fine.
You know you're in trouble when you're not even talking about the 
"big guys".  Tampa Bay still perhaps has the best starting 
pitching in the division, so they still will contend, but after
everyone beats themselves up, no 100 wins for the Red Sox and 
no wild card out of this division. 
I like the Buck Showalter magic, the Orioles will be the surprise
of the American League before finishing in the middle.
Vlady Guerrero may have a bit left, and J.J. Hardy is very 
underrated at short.  The only question will be can Guthrie
and Matusz hold up through the whole season leading the pitching.
Answer, no, sorry.
Toronto is going to fall to the REAL bottom.
And the Yankees, well, yes, I'm underpicking them, I don't care.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL CENTRAL: Minnesota, Chicago (WC), Detroit, Kansas City, Cleveland;
Minnesota CAN'T suffer that many key injuries again, and I like where
Carl Pavano has finally found his home.  Joe Nathan is the key one where
he has to recover from the elbow surgery for them to do well.
Chicago is goin' for it, so they get my wild card pick.  
Adam Dunn is really not that good, but MAYBE this horrible fielder
will finally find his place at DH?  Watch out for Jesse Crain, I think
he was a great bullpen pickup.
I didn't like the Tigers team before the turmoil, Zumaya is out yet again,
and you don't count on Brad Penny to save you.  Nuff said.
I like the Royals finding SOME young talent to get by Cleveland.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL WEST: Angels, Seattle, Texas, Oakland;
I don't really like any of these teams, I was tempted to pick Seattle
again, since I am a HUGE Eric Wedge fan, he's going to improve them.
But I can't quite do that.  Texas is going to fade back this year
as the Beltre/Young thing won't end well and Lee is gone.  Brandon
Webb replacing him?  Nah.
I picked the Angels but don't like the pick much.  I am a big
Morales fan, I hope he fully comes back from his injury, and Scioscia
is a great manager.  But Vernon Wells was not a helpful signing.
Seattle will ride Ichiro and Felix to challenge and almost make it.
Oakland needs Andrew Bailey not to be injured, but I think they won't 
get their wish.
And Trevor Cahill will hit the sophomore slump.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PLAYOFFS: Red Sox beat White Sox, Twins beat Angels; Red Sox to World Series.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL EAST: Atlanta, Philadelphia (WC), Florida, Washington, New York;
The Mets really are a laughingstock, I do like Jason Bay as a person, but
that and many of their other signings have been spectacularly misconceived.
Washington even can beat them, as I hear they have a great CF platoon going
(Ankiel and Hairston), well, you know, maybe!
They also have Cutter Dykstra, the son of you know who!!
I think Philly will fall, they probably won't, but I think they will.
Florida has Hanley Ramirez which is enough to be in the middle.
But I really like the way that Atlanta has built this team, Derek Lowe
and Tim Hudson are my favorite two under the radar starters in baseball.
Dan Uggla was a great pickup.
They do need to figure out who will be the closer though.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL CENTRAL: Cincinnati, Chicago, Milwaukee, Houston, St. Louis, Pittsburgh;
St. Louis will generate lots of stories and not many wins.
I like the Houston young team and how Bill Hall will help them.
Cincinnati has great pitching and will win going away from the rest of these
teams that will have little consistency.
Pittsburgh is sad, but they will keep the Cardinals out of the cellar.
Matt Garza will be good for the Cubs, but not good enough, and I just
don't like Milwaukee.
Greinke won't come back from the injury as soon as they think.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL WEST: San Francisco, Colorado, Los Angeles, Arizona, San Diego;
Too bad for San Diego they couldn't keep their run going.
I love the Giants, Barry Bonds will be found not guilty, and I don't 
care what anyone says about it.
Brandon Belt could win Rookie of the Year for the Giants, I love him!!
I don't have strong feelings about the middle of this division.
I love Juan Uribe, but he won't save the Dodgers, Kevin Towers
moves over to run the Diamondbacks, but there still is nothing there,
and Colorado will be plagued by injuries again.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
PLAYOFFS: Philadelphia beats Cincinnati, Atlanta beats San Francisco;
Philadelphia STILL goes to the World Series, where....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WORLD SERIES: The Red Sox mow down the Phillies and the Philly fans cry.
One of Cliff Lee or Roy Halladay wins the NL Cy Young, but neither of them
beats the Red Sox.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If the Giants repeat, I'll tear my hair out, I couldn't pick the two to 
play each other.... I'll print any comments from anyone else next time.
This time, last minute here, I just got a set of comments from Rick:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Rick Desper (Sun, 27 Mar 2011 17:49:44 -0700 (PDT))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
AL East: Red Sox.  Depends a lot on the starting pitching.  Which was disappointing
last year.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Central: Tigers.  Pitching?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
West: Angels.  Sort of a default pick.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wildcard: Yankees.  If they need somebody, they'll get him in mid-season.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
NL East: Phillies. Duh.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Central: Cardinals.  Pujols.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
West: Giants.  Defending champs.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Wildcard: Braves.  A more reliable choice than the Rockies.  Reds also possible.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
ALCS: Sox over Tigers;
NLCS: Phillies over Giants;
WS: Phillies over Sox;
I know it's boring to pick the Phillies and their overstocked rotation.  They
probably won't win.  But they're still the best team to pick.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) I have Red Kings 12 in hand and printed here.
Get writing, Johnny for Lucky 13 and beyond!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS 12 (Dark Press –- not for attribution)):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Never pay retell

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So me and the dame had the Chinaman.  I was hoping an hour later I wouldn't be regretting it.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
There's something to be said for being a loner.  
When I was by myself I wasn't towing a buxom blond, or a muted teenage ninja monk. 
I could walk softly and carry a big shtick.  
I only had to keep up with my own clich&#233;d and hackneyed lines. 
Now I had to develop different characterizations; 
write in different voices... what the hell, I was a flatfoot not a poetaster.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And the plot?  
Quite frankly, I’ve never worried about the plot before.  
I just sorta show up every chapter and let the words fall where they may.  
If they hit the page and break, I scrabble around in the syllables looking for clues.  It's not a glorious way to make a story, 
but hey this is the Hobby, there's a million stories out there.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This one, <b><i>Red Kings</i></b>, had been going nowhere fast for some time, 
okay, about twelve chapters.  
The clues had been few and far between and as much as my natural 
inclination would be to go home and mull it over, to stew with a brew as it were, 
my place had been recently redecorated with gun holes and broken timber.  
I was pretty sure Burgess was going to require a larger deposit.  
Lucky thing I didn't have a dog.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Let’s get out of Variant-town."  
The place made me uncomfortable, I was ready to get back to the 
Hobby proper where I could understand the rules of the game.  
We had to stop at the corner to let a pelaton from a Breaking Away 
game go by, and when they passed we caught site of a silver diner, 
<b><i>The Diplomatic Paunch</i></b> on the other side.  
That was all it took for the blonde to say,

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'm famished."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I could eat," said Virgule, the monk.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
We were going in just as a duck and a Dormouse were leaving.  
The Hobby, there's a million stories out there.
"Ya'll have a nice day boys," the waitress was calling after them out the door.  
She saw us and redirected her smile. 
"Well, howdy ya'll.  Welcome to the Paunch.  
C'mon and cool yer heels over here."  
Her nametag said she was Doris and she was all Georgia peach charm and 
oiled veteran waitress efficiency.  
She ushered us into a booth and splayed out the menus in one 
seemingly flawless motion.  
"Ya'll want a cuppa joe?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The diner was all chrome and naugahyde, it looked like it seen 
better days but was well kept up.  
There were black and white photographs of different celebrities on the walls.  
There was a young Frank in front of a melon sized microphone, 
there was one of Mazzer that was more black than black and white, 
and one of a boxer... big guy with an autograph scrawled across the bottom, 
the Wichita Woemonger.  
About then Doris came back with the coffee.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Ya'll decide?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I'll just have da' scrabble eggs," said the blonde.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You want some toast, honey?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wit wry."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"I will have the italic sausage on a pun," said the monk, in muted tones.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"And you darlin'?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Hmmm.  Hungrier than I thought," I muttered.  
"I'll have the Western Umlaut."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Three eggs or indented, hon?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Three."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Hey, Bob," Doris called to the kitchen, "give me a 12, a 5, and a 38."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
While we gnoshed things were happening in the Hobby.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The FGR draw proposal is reproposed.
Since, as you all know, failure to submit a vote leads to rejecting any
draw vote with orders required for Spring, we're more likely to get everyone.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Hi all, as most of you know, Buddy's been having a tough time medically, but
he really wants to stay in the game, so I'd like to try to help him.
If you need to call Buddy about the game, mid-afternoon seems to be the best time. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
3) Lastly, and most importantly, John Biehl has his cell phone disconnected and I had his old E-Mail address.  I've corrected that and tried to contact him.  But I need
to hold the game for that.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) You have all seen hobby history happen today, yes you have.
We have a pure 18 center victory achieved by Bruce Linsey without
holding ANY of his home centers and having EACH of his three home
centers owned by a different power.
One of the true sayings of Edi Birsan is that a true good solo is a 
negotiated solo.
When you do that and ALSO negotiate an ending like this, that is 
a true achievement.
Salutations and felicitations, Bruce!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Now, we would like to see some endgame statements if we could, I'll
print the full game SC chart next time and then the endgame statements
probably in the issue after that.
I think Bruce also is going to say that he is retiring from Diplomacy
with this game (I hope he doesn't).

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) I think it remains WAY cool that Death and Yorick are paired at the back of 
the pack.  Ah, we knew them well.
Meanwhile, the Dibbler moves his team at Damn the Torpedoes to see if he
can muscle his way to victory.  
It looks close, we can start calculating those finishes now.
Ye Olde Manager goes for some REALLY great replenishments, hits them,
but may have lost the race.
Credo may just have gone in between and also could have come up
a bit short.
I'll put the Finish Line after 120 on the board next time.

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i></b>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
If you
want to get any baseball predictions in, you'll have to do it soon 
(I told our usual correspondents to perhaps skip the least
interesting game of the Elite Eight, as WHO cares which of Kentucky or
North Carolina get in - as I write Kentucky is ahead).  
My baseball picks will have to be better than my
NCAA brackets.  I had this hunch (which I ignored) that UConn would
continue their Big East Tournament run.  Butler again?  Didn't think it.
And I barely knew who VCU was.  Anyway, I guess I weakly support the idea
of Kentucky getting in since then the entire Final Four will be 3 seeds or
greater.  Plus Calipari is a trip, even if I can't stand him.
I was a useless whimp, I picked the number 1's to get to the Final Four
except for Kansas, but thought Louisville would beat them, and boy did
Ricky-boy tank this one!
Looking to the future, remember the name Ed Cooley, the new hometown 
Providence College basketball coach.
I think this might FINALLY be the right choice to make us forget Ricky.
