Thanks to Paul Rauterberg for that one.
It fits very well the way I like to play Diplomacy when I'm really ``on''.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>NEWS FLASH: Hasbro has taken over Avalon Hill, including the 
rights to Diplomacy, and laid off all current employees.
A discussion is taking place that will address what stance we (the hobby)
should take (proactive in some way for sure) toward Hasbro.
If you want to be part of the discussion, send the MESSAGE:

<p>
to majordomo of diplom.org, it works just like the tap mailing list
described below.  Sending messages to hasbro of diplom.org
sends the mail to the whole list.

<p>
The game Diplomacy is a copyrighted product of Hasbro and all
reproductions or other use of that material in this szine is intended to
be personal use and not infringe on those rights in any way.
All reproductions are done at a heavy financial loss to the editor
and thus are without the remotest possibility of commercial intent,
except to promote THE game, the Game of Diplomacy, which you all 
should purchase from Hasbro or other duly licensed distributors.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>There are now three official subszines for this szine,
two of which appear in this issue.
<i>Octopus's Garden</i> has been around for awhile, of course.
With this issue, we welcome <i>Tinamou</i> to these pages.
<i>Tinamou</i> players are expected to sub, trade, or otherwise
make a deal with me as to how they are to see this szine
and the publication of <i>Tinamou</i>.  
This issue is free to all <i>Tinamou</i> players.
The deadlines for <i>Tinamou</i> will be every other issue on
Mondays.

<p>
<b>THE NEXT <i>TINAMOU</i> DEADLINE WILL BE SEPTEMBER 28TH</b>

<p>
This may be slightly quicker deadlines than you are used to.
David Partridge and I may readjust this a bit as we go.
The third subszine does NOT appear in this issue and will
continue the publication of the Arsenic and Old Farts game
that I am playing in.
The publisher will be none other than Pete Gaughan!
Pete will have a number of comments and surprises for you all.
I will let him tell you about them next issue in these pages.
For now, please take note of his new address listed with
the Zine Register game under ``TURKEY EMERITUS'' in the
Game Section below.

<p>
For those who say Postal Diplomacy is dying, I say:

<p>
<b>PHHHHHTTTTTHHHHUUBBBBBBBBB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b>

<p>
I am having trouble locating the early game info on the two
orphans I picked up from my not too organized files and NONE 
of the three end game statistics tables are in this issue either.
As a result, I've stopped officially extending the deadline 
for the receipt of end game statements and all of the 
players get more issues in their life of the game sub.  
I will give you time to write addendums or original
end game statements after I publish the statistics
before I cut off the end of the game as far as
life of game subs go.
That should be a fair deal for everyone but me.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
This price is sure to rise in the near future as I add pages
and subszines and like.
I am trying to decide how much to raise it.
Any subs that come in before I announce the new price will be
counted with these rates, of course.
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
His szine <i>Metamorphosis</i> may be found there, along with the
latest issue of this szine, plus some information on John Caruso's
baseball league - which yours truly plays in.
I still want to review David's web site in some detail and will do so
presently.
His ``version'' of this szine is somewhat more html.friendly
than the one I created, so please check it out.
Also, look at the Caruso baseball league chat to see what some
old semi-retired Dippers are up to with their spare time.
My team has finally started to come back to earth so perhaps
next year, when I'll be aiming for the World Championship, I
may have some success.

<center><b>Hasbro Interactive Reveals Plans</center><br></b>

<p>
The twin acquisition announcements of Avalon Hill and MicroProse by
Hasbro sent shock waves throughout the computer and board game
community. Speculation ran rampant. What would happen to the
companies? The fact that the entire design staff at Avalon Hill was
laid off fed more fuel to the fire.
GameSpot News spoke on Monday with Tom Dusenberry, CEO of Hasbro
Interactive, and learned some interesting things.
Hasbro's acquisition of Avalon Hill mainly involved trademarks,
current and previous designs, and other tangible assets. In that
sense, since Monarch Avalon (the parent company of Avalon Hill) was
still responsible for the AH employees and not Hasbro, the design
staff was laid off completely. While Hasbro had no immediate plans to
rehire any of the AH design staff, if opportunities should arise down
the road they would consider doing so. However, Dusenberry did say
that Hasbro had many ``strategy-minded" designers that were apparently
well acquainted with AH titles, so development would continue along
those avenues.
Dusenberry indicated that as Hasbro has the facilities to do so,
Hasbro would continue to publish Avalon Hill games. Unfortunately
Hasbro will not reprint the entire lineup of AH titles, but only the
top 15 or 20. This means that Diplomacy, Advanced Squad Leader, and
even Civilization among others would still survive. Dusenberry
indicated that 275 titles, some still unpublished, were involved in
the acquisition.
During the interview, Dusenberry never really made a distinction
between the more traditional strategy-oriented games like
Civilization and the more adult-oriented wargames such as Advanced
Squad Leader. He had a tendency to lump them all together. However
Dusenberry did acknowledge the fact that Hasbro would continue to
develop the wargame style of titles and that Hasbro was very much
aware of ``recognizing the core audience" of Avalon Hill.
In other Avalon Hill matters, he said Hasbro would be more than happy
to help run the AvalonCon convention held each year to continue
support of AH products. However, concerning AH's magazine publication
The General, Hasbro would like to see it continue, but it is
unfortunately out of the company's hands - it was not a part of the
acquisition, and the future of The General lies in the hands of the
Dott family, which owns 42 percent of Avalon Hill.
Hasbro's main focus will be on Hasbro Interactive and publishing
computer games, perhaps the most central reason behind the two
acquisitions. According to Dusenberry, at the end of 1997 Hasbro saw
the need to expand into the strategy and action fields. Avalon Hill
and MicroProse both help satisfy that need.
Hasbro Interactive fully intends on publishing everything currently
in development at MicroProse and will retain MP's full research and
development staff, although consolidation will occur in the
marketing, management, and media departments. Hasbro Interactive also
fully intends on producing computer versions of Avalon Hill board
games, most notably Diplomacy.
Since the acquisitions will probably not be approved until late
September or October, many questions remain unanswered. Exactly what
Hasbro intends to publish of Avalon Hill's backlist is still unknown,
and the fate of the various third-party contracts concerning Advanced
Squad Leader is up in the air as well (though Dusenberry did admit
that specific questions about AH titles on the board game side of
things wasn't really his area - he is the CEO of the computer
products division).
When more becomes available, GameSpot News will be sure to let you
know. For now, Hasbro intends to take a deep breath and see just what
it's acquired. According to Tom Dusenberry, at least, this is
definitely not the end; it's only just the beginning.

<center><b>MUSIC SECTION (WITH COMMENTS ON OTHER ARTS AND SOCIETY)</center><br></b>
    
<p>
<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
Then, I'm going to set a slate of 20 or so (perhaps more at the rate
my thinking is going) and DEMAND votes from you out there.
I may get a bit obnoxious on that score as the great freedom to work and play
will generate a responsibility to offer some opinions as we near the end of
the century.
I intend to have a lot of fun with this, and hope all of you do too.
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; The (English) Beat's ``Save It for Later'' ratchets
things up to the next level (wherever you put it!),
Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there,
and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

<p>
Many of you (including me) mentioned the Beat, who had to become the
English Beat for the US since there was already a band by that name
over here, in choosing ``all time album lists''.
Few people remember Paul Collins and his song, ``Rock and Roll Girl'',
but it actually was a great song and his band was called the Beat first.
There is no question that ``Save It for Later'' is their cruncher
that does what it says and the precise opposite at the same time.
Dancing to it simply does not permit you to save ANYTHING for later
while it demands that you save EVERYTHING for later while you
bounce to this.
This song was the last recording gasp for Saxa....
and the 12 inch single version of this song REALLY crunches.
I have that version on a tape in my car and it almost is unplayable
there because I can't stay on the road.

<p>
I've also decided that ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' by Buster Poindexter 
and his Banshees of Blue HAS to make the main list.
David Johanson played the slinky lounge lizard and his band
crunched with power, swing, and a salsa beat better than any of
the current fad swing bands do.
His ``first'' album as Buster Poindexter is a masterpiece of 1987...
yes, he's drinking a martini on the cover!
That has ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' on it along with the hilarious
``Good Morning, Judge''.
1989's <i>Buster Goes Berserk</i> is also well worth picking up,
featuring ``All Night Party'', ``Hit the Road, Jack'', and
``Who Threw the Whiskey in the Well''

<p>
The ``bullpen'' is the list of suggestions that people make
that I haven't decided whether or not to include yet.
Comments on the bullpen are, of course, actively encouraged.

<p>
BULLPEN: ``Rocking the Casbah'' - The Clash; ``Dancing With Myself'' -
Billy Idol's Gen X; ``Walk This Way'' - Run-DMC;
``Fire on the Mountain'' - the Grateful Dead; Devo - ``Whip It"; 
B Movie - ``Nowhere Girl"; B-52s - ``Give Me Back My Man" or 
``Rock Lobster"; ``Roadrunner'' - Jonathan Richman and the Modern Lovers; 
Strunz and Farrah - ``Americas''.

<p>
SPECIAL GEORGE CLINTON BULLPEN: ``I Just Wanna Testify'', ``Let's Take
It to the Stage'', ``The Pinocchio Theory'', ``Atomic Dog'', and
``Flash Light''.

<p>
SPECIAL ROLLING STONES BULLPEN: ``Midnight Rambler'', ``Satisfaction", 
``Paint It Black", ``Jumpin' Jack Flash".

<p>
Dear Jim: A few notes and tidbits about <i>TAP</i> #205....

<p>
First, how about a plug for <b>VERTIGO GAMES XII</b> in your next issue?
You have all the pertinent info in <i>Vertigo</i> #120.
You have lots of subbers within close driving distance and maybe a plug
from you is all they need to show up!
We need new blood at <b>VERTIGO GAMES</b>, 
because my stabbing technique is known to all the regulars,
er, we'd like to see some fresh faces.
All are welcome; our group is not clannish or closed-minded.
<i>((I know, you're gonna get me for Saturday night, going back
on Sunday.
We'll see if that brings anyone out!
Don't tell my family as I am skipping out on the annual Labor Day
thingie they do (this, of course, is impossible since my brother
reads this, but don't tell them anyway....).
I am really looking forward to it!
I also have to deliver that late Wedding Present to Jack and Maria!!
As people see this, they will have to act instantly if they are
going to come.))</i>

<p>
I'm trading with Heath Gardner.
<i>((I think Heath is ``the real deal''.
He really wants to start some games, so I hope people will sign up
before he gets discouraged.
Heath's address is 
The rest of you should send him a subscription.))</i>

<p>
Larry Peery.... God help us.
Why do most of the hobbyists I treasure burn out but Larry keeps
going, year in and year out?
<i>((You know the answer to that....really, you do.
I'm not going to say it.))</i>
The man must have inexhaustible energy.
Actually the Casaroli story was interesting, buried in pages of 
Peeriblah.
<i>((Absolutely, and the fact that it was interesting is why I
printed it.
You will recall that I used to edit the Peeriblah down, and still
reserve the editor's right to do so, but in an E-Mail message, not
having to type it, it only hits my pocketbook and I do want to 
encourage others to talk about historical stuff like that.
It is one of my passions that I don't have time to write
enough of myself.))</i>
If Larry wanted to do the hobby some good he'd sign up for a
game or two and send <i>normal</i> sized letters to several editors.
<i>((But perhaps others will write those normal sized letters
(hint, hint) with this inspiration!))</i>
But, then, Larry and I have never been on the same page.
I guess, in the end, he's harmless.
<i>((You and I, of course, are on the same page and pretty much
always have been.
I really want to thank you for publishing actively again.
It makes me feel less lonely.))</i>

<p>
``Wang Dang Doodle'' belongs on any list of the kind you are making.
I tip my hat to Mykey Barno for pushing it to the top of the list!
<i>((Believe you me, I wasn't going to exclude it.
I worried a bit that it might be too obscure or weird at first,
but then I started to see a pattern that the REALLY good songs
that belonged on this list have some certain ``weirdness'' about
them that make them timeless and of wider appeal than just to
the particular fans of that group or genre.
I don't just want to take the top pop dance hit of each half decade
or so.
Everything on there so far as that in spades, with the possible 
exception of Frankie.
I think he needs to be there, though, and if someone suggests a
different song that really does that, I definitely will consider it.))</i>
Koko has always been a favorite of mine.
``Wang Dang Doodle'' is a marvelous set-topper, with a rhythm and
bounce typical of Willie Dixon at his best, and Koko's charisma
sells it even more.
<i>((When she throws her head back, you just feel like you're
floating into heaven....))</i>
She was one of the first blues artists I really got into and I have
seen her perform 10-12 times, most memorably on a 1986 double bill
with Lonnie Brooks at Biddy Mulligan's in Chicago.
I think the best ``Wang Dang'' is on her Alligator live record.
Your choice is a tauter version but lacks that live pizazz.
No blues performer that I am familiar with is better in a studio
than live except perhaps for John Lee Hooker.
<i>((Yes, yes, you're absolutely right, of course.
I don't have that Alligator record, but will head out and find it.))</i>

<p>
My nominee for your list - and I will pick just one - is The Clash's
``Rocking the Casbah.''
Best video of all time, surely, and I shake my tail to it at any time.
<i>((As a person who cut my dancing teeth on the New Wave of this
period, I am having the greatest trouble deciding which songs to
take from it (notice the heavy bullpen representation in that area).
I <b>KNEW</b> that the Modern English song was the one transcendent
dance cruncher I was sure to choose.
Choosing the others has been really difficult to sort out.
I add one more to the main list this time, and others to the bullpen, 
including your suggestion, which is a neck and neck contender.))</i>
Also, there's Parliament's ``Flash Light'', Run-DMC's version of
``Walk this Way'' and George Clinton's ``Atomic Dog''.
All should make your list.
But it's your list, not mine.
<i>((Yeah, I know, but I wanna have fun making it something of a
group effort.
I was in the process of reviewing the Clinton oeuvre (heh, heh, heh...)
for last issue, when I received your letter too late for inclusion.
I was thinking about the ``latest swing'' revival that he did so
much better in the 70's, and all the rest.  
He is truly transcendent and trying to figure out how many, and which,
songs to include has been one major headache.
(another has been what to do about the 90's....)
Your help is most appreciated.
Any ideas on how to whittle the above list to two?
You still think ``Flash Light'' and ``Atomic Dog'' are it??))</i>

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Eric Brosius (Wed, 12 Aug 1998 23:09:28 -0400)</b>

<p>
Jim, I did buy Wilhelm Kempff's 1965 edition of the Beethoven piano
sonatas.  I went to Tower Records, as Conrad suggested, and there were
a lot of different versions.

<p>
I'm pretty good at reading time signatures, so mostly I had the timing okay
on the pieces I was playing, but there were a few instances where I was a
little bit off (generally I'd switch eighth notes for sixteenths or vice-versa
and then put in or take out rests to get the right number of bars in the
measure.)  The CD is useful for spotting these errors quickly, because once
you make the error, you're not likely to notice it just by reading the
printed music.

<p>
I also found that some pieces I thought I was playing too slowly really are
as slow on the CD as they are when I play them, which is very encouraging.  Of
course, this is not to say Kempff is playing them at the ``correct" speed
(whatever that is,) but if it's good enough for him, I'm happy.

<p>
There are other sections where I looked at the printed music and thought it was
impossible, then listened to the CD and learned that, yes indeed, it really
<i>is </i> impossible.  One example of this is the beautiful second movement
of Op. 10 No. 1 in C minor, which goes along at a beautiful slow singing pace
until you hit a measure in the middle of the page with what looks like
hundreds of notes in it.  Upon hearing the recording, you learn that the
secret is to just play them all in a hurry.  Even so, hearing Kempff play
it gives me an idea about where to start.

<p>
One thing I noticed is that the fortissimos on the CD are extremely loud.  I
couldn't play at that volume unless the rest of the family were out of the
house.  It also means I have to turn the volume down low enough that I can't
hear the pianissimos unless I'm in a quiet room.  I suspect this works just
fine in a concert hall, but not very well in a regular house (and you can't
easily listen to the music in the car because of the noise.)  When you listen
to the radio, the contrast doesn't seem as great;  I wonder whether this is
because the radio station has a way to flatten the dynamics?

<p>

<center>Eric, 72060.1540 of compuserve.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Absolutely, very astute of you.
Of course, once upon a time, when I had my active FCC license and was working
at my college radio station, I could have told you the details of this in a
much more technical manner.
To the degree I recall it, the dynamic compression used on FM (which is
different from what is used on AM since the process of making these signals
is much more different than you might suspect) has changed over the years
since it first went into widespread use in the late 60's/early 70's.
FM used to have this distinctive ``pumping hiss'' that was most obvious
in quiet pianissimo passages in classical music.
This was an artifact of the dynamic signal compression technology that
was used in the early days of FM.
The classical stations (and I had a some time classical show on my 
college station, in addition to a progressive rock show and doing 
fill in on the jazz shows) were none too happy about this and in the
mid-1970's began to implement more complex dynamic compression filters
that got better and better, so you don't hear that pumping hiss any more.
The need for dynamic range compression was instantly obvious to 
FM radio engineers for a variety of reasons - from memory these included
getting better pure signal strength for greater range as well as the
practical problems involved in not blowing out people's car radios.
It's also why, though, that taping off the radio doesn't give you very
good quality recordings.

I have a question: who is Jonathan Richman?  Why is he supposed to be
VERY familiar to <i>TAP</i> readers?  (I show my newbie colors here?) 

<p>
<i>((Wow, you sure do!
Jonathan has been making brilliant small albums for the last fifteen
years or so, many or most of which have made my end of the year's
best lists.
But before that, ``Roadrunner'' was part of his Modern Lovers output,
his band from the early '70's featuring Jerry Harrison (later keyboardist
for the Talking Heads) and David Robinson (later drummer for the Cars)
that was possibly the greatest garage rock band of the 1970's.
``Roadrunner'' is the quintessential ``cruising'' song.
``Girlfren'' is the best high school girlfriend song I've ever heard.
``Astral Plane'' is truly transcendent, and
``Pablo Picasso'' is, well, ``Pablo Picasso''.
And then, and then, ``Don't Let Our Youth Go To Waste'' is the 
great personal anti-war confessional of that era
(Jonathan Richman and Michael Perlitch [the latter unfortunately is
NOT still recording] made the great anti-war music of the 1970's
that got a bit lost as the war ended).))

<p>
((Anyway, we have INCESSANTLY discussed Jonathan for years.
He really does tour exactly as you see him in the movie, with that
dorky looking percussionist and VERY little amplification.
He came through Providence recently and I went to see him as usual,
and unfortunately too much of the crowd were ``Jonathan rookies''
brought in by the movie.
Some people in the back kept complaining that they couldn't hear him
and Jonathan reminded everyone that this is how loud he plays, and
that's it.
I took Charlotte and she gave him a positive comparison to Phil Ochs
(which I took as positively ecstatic praise, since she doesn't like
anyone....).
Phil Ochs, of course, made THE great anti-war music of the 1960's,
so the comparison made sense to me in ways that Charlotte didn't
immediately see, since there isn't much point in singing those kinds
of anti-war songs today.
Then again....))</i>

<p>
Anyway, based on his appearance in <i>There's Something About Mary</i>,
Jonathan Richman got an appearance on the Late Night with Conan O'Brien.
American artists may think Conan is not in a great time slot.  However,
Conan has an advantage perhaps many Americans are not aware of.  NBC
has a cable network in Europe which broadcasts Leno and Conan every day
at 10 p.m. and 10:45 p.m. respectively (I'm sorry, 22:00 and 22:45).  

<p>
So, Conan has a much better time slot here.  

<p>
Anyway, if you want to read about Jonathan Richman on the Conan O'Brien
Show, look at 

<p>
http://www.nbc.com/conan/
click on ``Show Info" and then ``Musical Guests".  

<p>
The Spice Girls were on Leno last night.  Ugh!  

<p>
I'm back in the US for a week, during which I hope to see <i>There's
Something About Mary</i> as well as <i>Saving Private Ryan.</i>  

<p>
Just yesterday I was reading a review of a new Tom Clancy book, and I
thought to myself ``Clancy is outdated".  After yesterday's cruise
missile strike on terrorist camps, I'm not so sure.  This is exactly
the kind of attack Clancy has recommended many times, from <i>Patriot
Games</i> to <i>Executive Orders</i> (except that, in <i>Executive Orders</i>, 
Clancy endorses the assassination of a foreign leader, and I don't think
we'll see that done [at least publicly] any time soon.)

<p>
So, here I am in Germany, and the US has launched an attack on
terrorists.  Sounds familiar to me.  In 1986, when Reagan launched the
attack on Libya, I was with my high school jazz band in Italy.  There
was a big fuss about whether this would instigate reprisals, and based
upon parental pressure, we cancelled the leg of the trip through
France, instead spending a week hiding in the Swiss Alps.  

<p>
And of course, this leads to worries about my flight to Newark on
Saturday.  But I doubt that terrorists would strike in Frankfurt, the
biggest airport in Europe, which presumably has decent security.  It
is much easier to take potshots in countries like Kenya and Tanzania.

<p>
Should the unthinkable happen, should Continental Flight 51 from
Frankfurt to Newark come to a bad end, let me just say now it's been
fun, and and I support the President.

<p>
Oh, and one more thing.  As Conan and Andy are fond of saying: 

<p>
``I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky."

<p>

<center>Well, I didn't!  Rick, desper of math.rutgers.edu</center><br>

<p><br><p><br><b>Rick Desper (Fri, 21 Aug 1998 10:35:28 -0400 (EDT))</b>

<p>
Well, I've heard of the Talking Heads, but mostly I focused on David
Byrne.  I saw a couple of their movies (<i>True Stories</i> and <i>Stop
Making Sense</i>).  
<i>((Please don't tell me you were too young to go to the concerts.....))</i>
I have also heard of the Cars, but I've never been a
big enough music fan to pick out individual instrumentalists.

<p>
The website bio said Jonathan Richman was a big punk rocker in Boston
in the early 70s.  While I was in Boston in the early 70s, I was quite
young.  I have dim memories of Watergate and cannot recall any moon
landings (a sad fact as I've passed my 30th birthday and we have not
gone back.)  Perhaps we could justify a moon landing by using the moon
as advertising - think of the McMoon!  Or Nike could put a swoosh up
there.  (An idea inspired by The Tick cartoon, where ``Chairface
Chippendale" wanted to humiliate the world by writing his name on the
moon.  He only got as far as ``Cha", I believe.)

<p>

<center>Well, that was certainly a tangent!

<p>
Somewhere in Michigan, sometime in August -
Hey Jim:
	
I wrote.  Netscape crashed (not an uncommon occurrence).  I rewrite much
later in another program - I lost a couple lengthy e-mail efforts a few
days ago when my modem caused.  I'll learn yet.
	
I have probably come up with 20 albums worth mentioning since I sent
you that last e-mail.  Can I recall any of them now?  No, of course
not.  I have, however, been listening to <i>OK Computer</i>.  A lot.  And
then some.  Very good album.  Great album?  Not quite.  
<i>((Exactly what I concluded....))</i>
The other current listening project has been <i>Mermaid Avenue</i> 
by Billy Bragg and Wilco.  Takes some getting used to.
<i>((That's what I figured from what I've heard, don't have it yet.))</i>

<p>
So, you're collecting songs for a millenial songfest?  Probably most of
what I'd come up with would fall on the wrong side of the line for your
criteria and the first is so cliche-laden it's probably falling off the
map:  Prince's ``1999".  Another prime choice that falls too heavily into
the theme/cliche realm (with the added bonus that you can't dance to it
- not within the conventional norms):  King Crimson's ``21st Century
Schizoid Man".
	
Here's a good handful of artists that should offer a bounty of
possibilities:  Police, Clash, Bowie, Talking Heads, P. Furs (though I
no longer own any to peruse), Pretenders, Eurhythmics, Elvis Costello,
Blondie, XTC, etc. And that's a relatively thin slice in the time-style
continuum.  I would hope, if only for the sake of balance, some reggae
or ska makes it in.  Marley, or UB40, or Jimmy Cliff, perhaps?  Burning
Spear would be tres cool, but probably too obscure.
	
I second the B-52s.  I caught ``Planet Claire'' on the radio last night,
probably the first time in ten years I've heard it.  Awesome.
<i>((Yeah, it really is better than ``Rock Lobster'' which is pure
novelty song.))</i>

<p>
Anyhow, I would like to offer up the following (thoroughly superficial,
definitely rock and roll oriented ) candidates:  David Bowie's ``Panic in
Detroit", ``Gloria" (by Van, Them, or anyone, the more raucous the better), 
<i>((Yeah, I wanted to include this one with the right recording
and I've been searching for it.))</i>
Talking Heads' ``The Great Curve" (I know this is one of your faves), 
<i>((You know right....))</i>
Concrete Blonde's ``Still in Hollywood", Beatles' ``Helter
Skelter", ``Hey Hey My My (Into the Black)" by Neil Young, Dire Straits'
``Industrial Disease", Pink Floyd's ``Interstellar Overdrive" (these last
three are pretty weak in the dance department, but they're all strong
candidates for my own end of the century tape - not exactly danceable,
more of a frolic in existentialism).
	
If you're feeling really adventuresome (manic cruelty), I'll toss in
this notion:  Clarence ``Gatemouth'' Brown's ``Up Jumped the Devil''.
	
One of my own criteria for truly great songs is that it can sound as
good or better distorted as not, whether on account of poor signal, bad
speakers, tape deterioration, car noise.  Bowie's ``Fame'' is one such
example.  A lot of Neil Young, U2, King Crimson also fits the bill
nicely.
	
A digression on Concrete Blonde ... My introduction to the band came
via a two-part MTV special one Christmas/New Years holiday season.  Does
anyone recall this?  If so, who was the Memphis
singer/songwriter/musician wearing John Lennon glasses featured on the
other half of that?
	
Also, did I see an allusion to something about a Rolling Stones song of
the century?  ``Satisfaction" is so quintessentially Stones, but it's
never been among my own favorite Stones songs (maybe I'm too young);
probably ``Paint It Black", but I would definitely also choose ``Jumpin'
Jack Flash" in an instant.
	
A question about the Breaking Away game:  are the identities and grades
of the riders confidential or is everything public knowledge (i.e. ``Joe"
is a ``C" rider on the ``gutless" team)?  Sounds like fun, sign me up, and
trust that I open my mail in a timely fashion.
<i>((Yes, the card holdings are public.))</i>

Jim: I appreciate the interesting twist your music column has taken with the
request to help compile a list of dance tunes.  How about another ``bullpen"
of special party dance tunes that celebrate one of the quintessential
features of human ritual (joining a group and music) - drugs!
<i>((As must be pretty obvious to everyone by now, this isn't really my
thing.  
Feel free to start the bullpen on it though, it will be fun.))</i>

<p>
My recommendations for inclusions in this category included:

<p>
Cocaine - probably Eric Clapton's version
	
Casey Jones by the Grateful Dead would be a close second for this drug.
	
Red, Red Wine  (I think it's U2)

<p>
Smoke Two Joints (a local station still plays this at 5:05 PM each and
every Friday as part of the ``Attitude Adjustment Hour."  I will have to
listen again or have my brain come back from the Ozone to remember the
Group's name.

<p>
Smoke, Smoke, Smoke (That Cigarette) by Commander Cody and His Lost Planet
Airmen.

<p>
I never danced to a caffeine record.
A couple of the Rolling Stones songs might fit into a ``heroin"
sub-category but I never danced at a party in which the entire group was
shouting ``Horse," as the drug, out in rhythmic celebration ala ``Cocaine."
<i>((I think it has more than a little bit to do with the nature of 
the drug....))</i>
I've had fun thinking about this anyway.

Dear Jim, Thanks both for <i>TAP</i> 204 and for letting us know about
<i>The Bones of All Men</i>.
I've become very lazy about checking on new releases - even Ghod 
related ones, I regret to say - and I might have missed this one if
you had not mentioned it.
I'll certainly make an effort to get hold of it though, as, quite
apart from its Fairport Mafia connections, I have fond memories of
a Phil Pickett album called <i>The Alchemist</i> and also quite like
virginal/spinet music (in small doses).
Does this album include a tune by John Bull called <i>The King's Hunt</i>,
by any chance?
I always enjoyed that one....
<i>((Nope, none of the songs was composed after 1600 and I think
all are anonymously penned....))</i>

<p>
Now that you've passed the 200 issue milestone, what other target
is there left for you to fix upon?
Is it your ambition to reach 300 issues, perhaps, or are you
hoping instead to be the last US Dip zine printed and distributed
the old-fashioned way?

I'll go on.

<p>
<p>The regular Diplomacy opening is very nearly filled (and it might even
be filled).
Take that!!.... those of you who claim Postal Diplomacy is dead.
I still think I might actually end up starting a second regular Diplomacy
game.
Anyone interested needs to get their money in now and we'll see
where things shake out for next time.
I am worried that I missed someone who wanted into this first game.
If I have, please alert me to my error, otherwise, the first respondent
gets the last position.
So far, we have Warren Goesle ($15), 
Drew James ($15), Luke Dwyer ($15 - P), Paul Rauterberg ($5), Russ Rusnak, 
and Steve Emmert ($15 - P).Russ should send me the $15 game fee, Paul already has sufficient
NMR insurance on file that I am reallocating and he does not need to
send me any more money.
I have money from the rest of you.
Some of you have submitted preference lists (indicated by - P above).
Remember that according to my house rules I need preference lists
from EVERYONE, or I don't use them and revert to Random Draw.
Since I have some lists, I'd really like to have lists from each of you.
In fact, again, I think it is possible that I might have misplaced a 
list or two from the others, so please bring me up to date on that as well.
Ideally, I'd like to start this game next time.

<p>
Harry Andruschak would like me to run another variant, like ``1499,
Stonehenge, and maybe you could talk to Brad Wilson about him letting
you run a game of Philadelphia Dip.''
The other idea I got this time, which intrigues me much more is to run
Colonia.
I will probably go with Colonia VIIb (I believe that is the most up
to date version) after one more issue to garner ideas.
Could Doug Kent or someone else playing in his Colonia game contact
me with other ideas on what I will need to know to run Colonia?

<p>
On another front, I'd really like this Black Hole game to start too!
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny, Mike Barno, and John Schultz are signed up.
Off an offhanded suggestion in the NYEED press, we'll call it
Nelson Mandela.
Just four more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
We also have the Breaking Away game filled and ready to start.

<p>
(PAT ROBERTSON to WORLD): See!
I told you so!
I warned you that if Disney World was allowed to hold a Gay Day,
then asteroids and hurricanes would hit Florida.
And they did.

hurricanes'' I really meant fires.

needed that no what Help!
<i>((Now how would you correct that grammatically?

<p>
(DESPER BUTTS IN): Nice slam of Spain!  

<p>
(BRITAIN-SPAIN): The Trailblazers should not be so bad this year. With the
addition of Stoudamire, former UofA point guard, they may actually be able to
generate some offense this year. They have been the league's leading
rebounding team for two or three years now, and with that combination and some
luck, they may actually make it to the second round of the playoffs this year.
That alone would be a big improvement over recent years. 

<p>
(BOOB to BRITAIN): Ah, now you have your head screwed on straight!
Except for the fact that this szine's editor is a Rick Pitino fan
and a Boston Celtic fan which makes him more than a mite dangerous 
at the moment when you talk about the NBA.
We share some of these fannish inclinations with the ``German'' intruder,
formerly known as Desper.
Of course, with this lockout, I am trying very hard not to pay any 
attention at all and wait patiently.

<p>
(SPAIN to PALACE OF VERSAILLES): (Keep in mind I'm not with my szine at a

She sounded pretty nice. 
If you have kids I'm willing to bet she'll make a good Mom.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-POLLARD): Thank you for your follow-up letters
of 1 and 15 july.
Given the sad state of education in the USA nowadays, I wonder how
many <i>TAP</i> readers are aware of the fact that ``Ataturk'',
meaning ``Father Turk'', was the very real last name of the
very real Kemal Ataturk, founder of modern Turkey?

<p>
(BOOB to HARRY): I venture to say many or most of MY readers.
But they are a selected sample.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR ATATURK P&#214;-LLARD to THE WESTERN POWERS):
It would seem that the rumors are true.
The rise and rebirth of the Ottoman Empire
has begun!  Certain aspects of my government will
remain Democratic, but the military establishment
has won over many of my people.  Now the winds of Destiny
begin to blow.  I wish you all good fortune and may
Allah be praised....

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-POLLARD): Nothing to do with this game, but I wanted
to say ``congratulations'' for your fine effort as a one SC England
in ``The Hermit''.
An inspiring example for all good players of Diplomacy.

<p>
(SEAN to BOARD): Spain has just ran away to who knows where crying. 
YOU BIG BABY! 

<p>

<p>

(CNN NEWSFLASH!): Scientists are still puzzling over the

<p>

<p>

<p>

No wonder I don't understand what is going on here.....

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-RAUTERBERG): Nothing to do with this game, but I wanted
to say ``congratulations'' for your win as France in ``Covington 
Cross'' and will be looking forward to your endgame statement.

<p>

<p>
(EGYPT-FRANCE): Yes! It was my press, knock yourself out.

<p>
(SPAIN to JEFF): Way to go Stoush.

<p>
(GENERAL GEMAL G&#220;RSEL to FRANCE):
Only infidels shall be castrated!
Also, we will not tolerate American
tobacco companies infiltrating our commerce!
Any attempt at such action will result in dire 
consequences....

<p>
(SPAIN to THE CRIMINALS): Dang! Man put that thing away.

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE AND BRITAIN): First, Britain, you've made your point. 
Let me have Mor and I'll give you Gib. 
Then I'll back you up North and leave your one fleet here, that way 
you may protect it in Sao. 
That way we can stay out of a major war in which you alone should take me. 
France, you're now 100% bigger than I was at the beginning and now you're 
bigger you can be the senior officer of the alliance if it's still intact.

<p>
(THOMAS THORTON ``1807''): ``The national character
of the Turks is a composition of contradictory qualities.
We find them brave and pusilanimous; gentle and ferocious;
resolute and inconstant; active and indolent;
passing from devotion to obscenity; from the rigor of
morality to the grossness of sense;
at once delicate and coarse; fastidiously abstemious
and indiscriminately indulgent.''

<p>
(HARRY ANDRUSCHAK-SEAN O'DONNELL): I am not quite sure how to
make this sound as friendly as I want it to be, but I AM trying to be 
friendly, and helpful.
It's all about your postcard that I received on 22 July.
For starters, I dislike the telephone and I hate wasting
money calling long distance just to try and calm your nerves.
I am required by my job to have a telephone at home in case
an emergency arises at the Post Office.
I am not required to use it or answer it.

<p>
However, I did use it one day before the deadline to call the GM
and change my orders because I disliked being badgered.
Indeed, I would hazard a guess that the vast majority of
Play-By-Mail Diplomacy players dislike being badgered.
You have been badgering me since the very start of this 
game and I am wearied.
That is why I changed my orders from ``Neutral'' to ``stab Spain''.

<p>
(I am reconsidering if I really want e-mail if the only result is to
give people a new medium for badgering me.
<i>((See my note elsewhere.
You always can control [to some degree] your use of the E-Mail address.
I keep E-Mail addresses confidential for some people now, and 
certainly would be willing to do so for you, in fact ESPECIALLY
for you!
I get a lot of ``junk'' E-Mail liberal use of the delete key without
reading things does wonders.
Supposedly, ``jokes'' and ``chain letters'' are popular to read
on the Internet.
I invariably delete them without reading them
[even if I might be interested in the subject or if close friends
or relatives send them to me] on general principle.
I know this has had me missing what on the surface appear to be
chain letters from good causes and jokes that might actually be funny.
I still find this really liberating, so I do it anyway.
I do about the same thing to junk postal mail, except admittedly
the physical act of ripping it up brings more pure joy than
the delete key does.))</i>
And as far as badgering goes, I also received postcards from you on 31 
July [which I answered] and 4 and 15 August [which I didn't].)

<p>
And now some kind words of advice.
Have you ever considered playing gunboat?
Some of the other zines out there still offer gunboat,
and perhaps that is more suitable for you to play.
<i>((While I agree, I philosophically have problems with postal
gunboat.
The Judges are so much more flexible with the approach to gunboat,
perhaps Sean should try that.
I'll never run another gunboat game.))</i>
Hint: always put Turkey at the top of your no-press gunboat preference
lists, and France at the top of your gunboat-with-press preference
lists.

<p>
More friendly advice: Please consider buying a typewriter.
Or, if you have a computer, buy some simple word processing
software and a simple printer.
It may be that the other players just cannot be bothered to
devote the time and effort required to decipher your grotty 
handwriting.

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): I get Long distance phone cards prepaid. That's all.

<p>
(ANDRUSCHAK-TURKISH SCIENCE FICTION CLUB): We have indeed read
your book ``A Turk Goes To Mars''.
This was not a book to be lightly tossed aside.
it was thrown against the wall with great force.
now send us something worth reading, like 
``Ethel the Aardvark Goes Quantity Surveying''.

<p>
(SPAIN to ITALY): I take that as we are agreed.

<p>
(EGYPT to ITALY): I do whatever the voices in my head 
tell me to do....

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): ``Attractis pedibus patente porta percurrent 
raphanique mugilesque!''
Translation: With ankles strapped and the rear entry opened,
you'll be torpedoed by a fast-acting suppository of mullet and radish!

<p>
(SPAIN to GERMANY): Wo ist Munchen gehen.

<p>
(FRANCE-UKRAINE): Thank you for your letter postmarked 7 July.
No, I have not had any letters form Poland or Russia.
Of course, it may well be that they figure I am too far away
to have an effect on them, one way or the other.
However, if they are not writing you.... well... ``Don't worry,
be happy.''

<p>
(SPAIN to FRANCE): Freunda du nicht. Bitte gehe nicht.

<p>
(SPAIN to BOARD): Without my book so some of the spelling is wrong and the 
sentence structure is probably wrong as well.

<p>
(TO ALL TOADIES...): ``there is nothing so weak and unstable 
as a reputation for power which is not based on one's own strength." 
Tacitus, <i>Annals</i> 13,19.

<p>
(SEAN to SPAIN): Now tell me how it feels to be the first country being 
faced with elimination?

<p>
(POLAND to RUSSIA): This land is my land this land ain't your land 
from the city of Warsaw to frontier of Russia.

<p>
(FRANCE-POLAND AND RUSSIA): No letters from you since the Spring
1995 adjudication?
O well, I can always fill space with another pun.... 
What did the piano teacher take to the supermarket?

film at 11.
<i>((Since when did anyone have to sell a recipe to the
Chinese before the Chinese copied it on their own????))</i>

<p>
(SPAIN to SEAN): It feels e-merciful I don't know how I can stand it.

<p>
(DON WILLIAMS to GM): What do you get when you cross an avocado,
a duck, and a food processor?
Quackamole.

<p>
(BARNEY-TELETUBBIES): OK, kids, today we're going to learn the word
``carnivore''.

<p>
(THE STINGAL EMPIRE):  There, Jonas, Harry, Sean, Jeff, Roland, Rich, 
Kent, Paul, Eric, and Dave stood looking up at Jim up on a balcony of a 
prison. They had just passed through several check points taking away all 
of their guns. 

<p>
``You all have been chosen by the sinitkint to come here to see which 
one of us is the top dog. It isn't time to talk, it's time to show, so all 
you fly brothers come out here to see what we're made of. Ok, first this 
prison opens in three years. I was able to talk to the Warden so we own 
the place till it opens, within that time we'll see who is the top dog. 
Now remember kill till there is only one left and I'll see it  through 
in the security system from Camras. Now let's get this party started." 
Said Jim as he went into a room he snapped his fingers and out popped 10 
guns, all hand guns, 9mm. 

<p>
Everyone grabbed one as fast as they could. 
Jonas grabbed one and he pointed it at Sean, Sean at Eric, Eric at Jeff, 
Jeff, at Eric while the rest pulled the trigger. Then after a period of 
everyone pulling the trigger they found it not to be loaded. Then Clips 
was poured out. Everyone grabbed a handful and some took off, some went 
for air docks, and six remained. 
Harry and Jonas pulled the trigger 
hitting Sean in the exact same place of Sean's arm. 
He ran, dove down a 
hamper shoot, and was out of sight. 
Jonas and Harry followed not aware that Dave, Rich, and Kent were behind them. 
Kent ran down the hall where Eric ran earlier. 
Dave pulled the trigger, shooting Rich in his leg, 
but Rich is a tough man and he ran all the same, shooting back bullets, 
keeping Dave's head down.
       
But the battle is far from over.

<p>
(BOOB to THE WORLD): And that's about where I came in.....

<p>
1) Note that Rick Desper has changed his address again.
Also note that Luke has a school address.
This is his primary address now.
I will continue to list his home address as well for school breaks though.

<p>
2) A bit of a messy SC Chart this time.
Please check it over carefully for mistakes.
The trickiest part is what happens if China decides to retreat to Vlad.
Recall that Autumn retreats and Winter builds are combined and the
complication is likely to lead to desires for conditional builds.
You can make your builds conditional on ANY retreat action, but NOT
on any builds by other players.
If you have any doubts or questions, please do not hesitate to ask.

<p>
(DUCK to HOLLAND):  Sorry, I don't do clock cleaning.  Too messy and
complicated, what with all those tiny, oily springs and gears and levers
and crap.  Besides, JJ is my buddy.  I don't want to make waves, pal,
cause Britannia here rules 'em.

<p>
(RUSSIAN WAR DEPARTMENT, OMSK to DUTCH HQ, AMSTERDAM OR NEW JERSEY OR
WHEREVER THE HELL HE ENDS UP):  Pip?  Is that the singular version of
Pips, as in Gladys Knight and the ?  I think your country is overrun
with sillyologists - no wonder JJ is attacking you with abandon.

<p>
(FRANCE to JAPAN): Keep those Samaris moving onto the mainland Formosa is
mine and as agreed as far as I go.

<p>
(THE ODESSAPHILE to LES FWENCH MISERABLES): Rich is right about the
Nipponese, you know.  Lest you had somehow rudely failed to notice,
Lukey-Lukesan attacked my eastern holdings right from the start, without
provocation.  Through some rather sophisticated and adept play on my
part, I have sneaklily turned these holdings into Japanese supply
centers upon which, I suggest to you, I will never again set my hands. 
Savvy, eh?  Listen and take heed: The Rising Sun will soon be dawning on
your possessions, too.  To arms!  To arms!

<p>
(MULDER to SCULLY): Somebody doesn't like us! Must be another conspiracy.

<p>
(MOSCOW to BOMBAY):  Cute.  Keep it up.  You sweet talk me into attacking
both China and Turkey, then innocently point out to them how I'm the
enemy.  Hey, I'll take the lumps for my own treachery, to be sure, but
I'm really glad they see through your piddling protestations and are
giving you ``what for," too.  Bide thee careful, sirrah, lest we get
Biblical on your butt and forego Jonas for Judas!

<p>
(TOAD to JAPAN):  Tora! Tora! Tora!

<p>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY):  Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm scum.  I admit it.  Superscum,
really.  But that's MR. Superscum to you.

<p>
(TSAR to BOOB):  So, I finally start dribbling in the press section and
now you go silent?  Go ahead, but I can stop writing at any time.

<p>
(BOOB to TSAR): Yeah, I know I've been quiet lately, but I'm trying
to keep the szine on track.
The fall always is better for that.
We'll see....

<p>
(TSAR to BOOB):  Yeah, I know.  But it's not like I didn't beg for that by
giving you the straight line.

<p>
(BOOB to TSAR): Straight line, what straight line.... as usual,
I'm clueless.
By the way, Charlotte couldn't think of anything to write.

<p>
(ODESSA to PROVIDENCE):  I just thought of a palindrome.  ``Wolf flow." 
Sort of like ``star rats."  Or ``Wolf rats live on/no evil star flow." 
(Now you know what it's like to get press from you.)

<p>
(BOOB to PUNSTER DUCK): I already know what it's like to get press
from me.... and I know what it's like to get press from you....
hmmmmm, what does that say about both of us???

<p>
(DUCK to SISKEBERT):  Godzilla ... good?  Hmm, that puts you in a minority
of one.  Why, pray tell, was it funny and good in your book, and panned
by everyone else?  You are the Consummate Contrarian.

<p>
(BOOB to DUCK): Have you seen it, or were you cowed by those critics??
Basically, I thought it slammed the Siskel/Ebert critics as they
deserved to be slammed, it destroyed New York City, and the ethnic
types (Japanese, French, etc.) hanging around the movie were great
actors with some meaty little roles.
Yeah, the monster was cheesy, but it was SUPPOSED to be cheesy!
My wife and I laughed and were thoroughly entertained by it,
that's what made it funny and good.

<p>
(DAPPER DUCK to PROVIDENTIAL HUSBAND):  Can Charlotte come out and play?
<i>((No.))</i>

<p>
(DON to JIM, PART I):  Happy Birthday, by the way, and many, many more!

<p>
(BOOB to DUCK): Mine is still a month off.
How was yours?
Did you get the cards??

<p>
(DON to JIM, PART II):  You ... old?  Pacific Ocean ... blue?  Ice ...
cold?  Red Sox ... bums?  Diplomacy players ... treacherous?  Caruso ...
bloodsucker?

<p>
(THE BARBARIAN PALACE): The duck waddled past the tub of barbarian and
firmly set goo with a distinctive tenderness to his waddle.
	
``Consulting with the British Monarch again?"
	
``Yeah," muttered the duck.  ``He seems to have borrowed the chinese
soap collection and keeps dropping them."
	
``And you bend over and pick them up, of course," chuckled the
barbarian.
	
``Yeah, how'd you  know?  And there is this sharp pain!  Small but
annoying and unexpected!" scowled the duck.
	
``Here," offered the barbarian, ``Some of this isn't quite set up,
make yourself a plug."  He then described where the plug should go.  The
feathers on the back of the duck's neck began to rise even as his
nethermost regions puckered in fear.

<p>
(www.timricequoteofthemonth.alt):
`` ... I look for truth, and find that I get damned!"
	
``But what is truth?  Is truth unchanging law?  
We both have truths - are mine the same as yours?"

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes (back from the tropopause):</i>
 
1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Mike Mills, Dick Martin, 
Vince Lutterbie, and Eric Brosius
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is STILL
missing... someone find him!).
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) Note that Pete has moved and Arsenic and Old Farts players
need to take special note of the new address.  
This is of great importance in some ways, though probably not of
interest for this game.....
I will be welcoming Pete as the GM of ``Arsenic and Old Farts"
which will be published in these pages, beginning next issue.
I'm really excited about it.
It's been a GREAT game, and I do not make that statement lightly.

<p>
3) Back here in this one, we have the inevitable FET (almost DIAS)
draw proposal.
Nevertheless, Doug and Don have full votes around here and they
can veto this merely by not voting.
So can those of you included in it.
Anyway, please vote with your Spring orders and if all five of you
approve it, the game will be over.
 
<p><br><p><br>
<p>
<i>Press:</i>
 
(PARIS to LONDON): Our third build was an ill-gotten gain, due to the
surprising German pig-headedness re: Kiel.  We regard Kiel as yours, 
so we will make no build for owning it.

<p>
(BREST to ANKARA): Our continued ownership of Venice may be shortlived, 
but we kept it fair and square.  
We'll take a build for it, and try to use it to seize your other 
Italian dots.

I finally got around to trying to read the incredible amount of mail
generated by the ghodstoo game.  It's quite a shame that almost none of Edi
Birsan's letters made it in there as the whole thing seems quite complete
without input from one of the major influences in that game.  
<i>((That isn't really true, most of it is in there, it just is
``mislabeled'' because a ``judge code parsing program'' created
the files.))</i>
Hopefully, that will be corrected for THIS game as everyone is 
using the Judge software.

<p>
I DID find one priceless tidbit in the reams of press:
``IMO, it's not generally a good idea to accuse that your fellow
players, especially in a game where all are experts such as this one,
are gullibly eating someone else's lines without thought.''

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) All draws and concessions are rejected.
The FAGT, FGT, the GT sportscar, and FG draws are reproposed and so are 
concessions to Germany and Turkey.
Please vote with your Fall orders.
Failure to vote vetoes all proposals as usual.
Harold complains below that I didn't get all his reproposals in last
time.
Basically, this was because of the confusing way he listed them.
Technically, if you are submitting orders, I would prefer you
listed separately (a) your votes on the current proposals, and
(b) which proposals you want reproposed.
Believe me, if I had doubt about what someone's stance was on a
vote, I would clarify it (as those of you know who I've asked
to do so).
Without giving you any further information, let me assure you that
no draw in this game ever has passed.
We can talk about it in the endgame statements afterward if you like
and I can tell you about how it went, if the players give their 
permission for me to discuss it.
Until that time, all I do is say ``all draws and concessions are 
rejected,'' and they are.
As an unsolicited piece of advice, one is generally better off
trying to end a game by offering a small focused set of proposals
or a single proposal that everyone can agree to, rather than have
long lists of proposals, many of which have no realistic chance of
passing.
The more this sort of thing goes on, the more it convinces me that
the game itself deserves to still go on, since the desired outcome 
is not clear.
Just for the record, I am not even close to ``calling this a stalemate''.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): I still would like to see Austria die.
I'll support you into Budapest.

<p>
(FRA-GM): In every set of instructions I send to you, I both
propose and vote for F/G, F/G/T, and F/G/T/A.
Yet, none of these passed and I noticed with some interest that you
say only the F/G/T/A was reproposed.
How could this be?
<i>((See above.
I assure you, it is VERY clear that the three proposals you cite
are not passing at the moment and have never passed.
I am very clear on precisely who is vetoing which draws and where
and when votes have changed.
I remind everyone that regardless of what anyone says in the press,
their votes are private.
You cannot force yourself or be forced to tell the truth in press.
France could possibly say what he just said and be vetoing the draws.
My very strict policy precludes me from discussing just how particular
draws have come not to be passed.
Be assured that they are not.))</i>
Have you been incorrectly tallying the votes just to make this inane
game continue for your own evil, twisted purposes?
<i>((Ever since I once ``ended a game before its time'' by accident,
I vowed that never again would a game end unless I was sure everyone
wanted to end it.
I do not consider this an evil, twisted purpose.
In this game, be assured that in every single season at least one
player (perhaps more than one, but at least one) did not want the
game to end.
In some games, I have been less sure, but here I'm sure.
And that's because you've all been quite reasonably involved in 
the game at all stages.
By the way, I thank you for sticking with it.
Really!))</i>

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): You are just pissed off that France is now
doing for me what Austria did for you.
Since you seem to have an ass hole fetish, you'll understand this.
Blow it out your ass if you don't like it.
I just got pissed off and quit voting for a 4-way.
Austria is out and I will not vote for any draw that he is included in.
Currently I am voting for a 2-way France/Germany, and a win for Germany.
You will have to earn a place in any draw from now on.
First thing kill Austria, or let me kill him.
Stop being an ass.

<p>
(BOOB to GERMANY): I will remind you of the house rule that you must abuse
me at least much as you abuse any other player and you are technically in
violation of that this turn.
I'm sure you will correct your behavior next time. ;-)

<p>
(FRA-TUR): So you won't let me live it down that I threw the game to Germany,
eh?
Listen, I never heard of you prior to this game, and you don't mean jack - - - -
to me.
Besides, since you live in San Francisco, I'm sure you give plenty of meaning to 
the term ``homo erectis''.

<p>
(BOOB to FRA): Ahem....

<p>
(FRA-GM): Where do you find these nutcases like Weiss?
He should be locked up to protect the decent citizens of this country.
Geez, maybe his address is his cellblock number!
Ha!

<p>
(BOOB to HAROLD): See my message above to Charles.
If you're asking me seriously, I found Richard when he was publishing
a great little Diplomacy szine that had a ``win only'' philosophy.
I liked the szine, I really like Richard, and the philosophy is 
self-explanatory.
I'm still having fun watching this game.
I hope you're still having fun playing it.
The outcome is still in doubt.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TURKEY): No, I don't believe that my mother had any 
kids with brains that lived, sorry.
You should meet my brother and sister if you really wanted to have
a good time playing a Diplomacy game.
Lack of brain or not, we'll see who gets what he wants.
First; I want you to kill Austria.
Stop pissing around.
Austria must die for stabbing me.
I have a general rule, if you stab me you'd better kill me, because if not
you die next.
Second; give Harold some of your centers.
Third; say you are sorry to Harold, Jim-Bob, and of course Mr. Wonderful
the brain dead Diplomacy player who is currently planning to kick your ass.
Time is running out, humble yourself or lose out altogether.

> FRANCE): Disband the unit that you need less.
I would like to get into the Mid-Atlantic soon, but not next turn.
I'll let you know.
I'll need three or four fleets to seal the Med and keep the man
with the ass fetish in the South out of the Atlantic.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font

> MIKE B.): I am still of the opinion that Jim-Bob made you
up, sorry; and that you do not really exist.
All that internet address bull that Richard used to prove your
existence is easily faked.
All Jim-Bob needs to do to create a ghost is get a friend to copy
and send E-Mail messages for him.
<i>((But Mike isn't ON the Internet.... faked or otherwise.))</i>
By the way, I don't believe in Don Stafford either, or that anyone
could be as good at this game as the Turkey says that you are.
<i>((I don't believe in Don Stafford either, didn't you read the
press last time.... it's Dan, it's Dan...))</i>
Maybe Richard made you up, but you are made up.
I have my own theories about why Richard's HOF rating is so low.
<i>((It could be that he doesn't play Judge Diplomacy....))</i>
It could be that he is a stone headed dip shit; who plays for the
short term.
It wouldn't have ever hurt him to kill Austria for me, but he isn't
smart enough to see that he was sealed into the Med and the only player
who had a chance to break this game was Germany.
He just kept going being his low HOF rated self.
By the way, Harold Zarr did ``shake things loose enough for someone to go
for a win, which did result in a revival of interplayer dynamics did happen.''
It just did not happen for MR. low HOF.
I wonder why.
I am also wondering why that I'm now writing to someone that Jim-Bob made up
and is not real?
<i>((I wish I was smart enough to have invented someone like Mike Barno!
I'm not.))</i>
Must be my lack of living brain tissue.
I'm lucky Richard pointed that out to me, I thought that all my problems were
BO related.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face="symbol"> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> JIM-BOB): I agree with you Postal Diplomacy will live on as
long as there is a Post Office.
It's a lot more fun to get mail in the post box, than read E-Mail.
<i>((I agree, but it won't win you points for abusing the GM to
agree with me, how wimpy!!))</i>

<p>
1) Remember that the default with leftover NMR insurance is to put it into
a continuing sub until it is gone.
You also can use it toward a new game, e.g. if Michael wants to join a new
game he only needs to send me $8.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>End Game Statements:</i>

<p>
<p><br>
<center>RUSSIA - Survival - John Schultz</center><br>

<p>
<p>This is an easy end game statement for me.
I enjoyed the banter regarding alliances - knew it wouldn't end in a
3-way all along.
Thought it would take longer to decide the job though.
I didn't stab Austria when most would have.
It might have changed the texture of the game some - but it would
have done no good in the end.
Austria and I both survived.
That's as cool as it gets if you can't win.

<p>
Boob:  Nope, won't be at any cons, etc. this year, but I'll be 
rolling in one of these times.
I'll be the big guy with long white hair and beard, holding
a marked resemblance to Yeti, and riding a replica 1948 Harley-Davidson
panhead clone - black with red, yellow and orange pinstripes - with
a tiny, tiny little lady on the back named Rose who looks like she
definitely should be with someone else - and - well - everybody
forgets I'm there anyway as soon as she smiles and melts everybody's
heart, and sometime later someone will say who's that big old ugly
guy and that will be me.
