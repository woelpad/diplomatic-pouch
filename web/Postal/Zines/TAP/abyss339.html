<br /><br />E-MAIL/WEB ONLY ISSUE!  PDF will be available on the website.
We also are being reproduced in <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>.

<br /><br />Some of you are still not on the E-Mail list for this szine, I keep trying to sign
you up, please accept the offer! I am being a bit more systematic about that right now.
I am going ahead and finishing all the games here, and then we will see.
There is interest in a NEW regular Diplomacy game.  Sign up, let's see if we can get seven!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This issue continues the szine/subszine inversion.  
As most of you know, this
thing began as a &#223;ubszine" to Terry Tallman's <i>North Sealth, West George</i>, then
became its own szine with a host of subszines.  The subszines remaining will appear
as sub-subszines to our new flipflopped home in Doug Kent's <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>. 
Doug's incessant nagging is not keeping us on schedule, but will make it so we will charge forward and finish the remaining games
that I have in here.  After that, we'll see how it goes and what I do next.  I'd like
to keep writing and doing some game GMing.  You all should see first what I actually do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
For production, in addition to the HTML's of each separate product on the web page, 
I will also have a PDF that you can print of the entire subszine (including my famous
handdrawn maps!).  You can just print the maps if you like, but remember maps are
for pikers anyway, you don't need no steenkin' maps, keep them up in your head
where they belong.  I don't think
there are very many people I owe money, but if you think I owe you money, just ask
and I will pay.  ONE GROUP that is definitely owed money is the players with NMR insurance.
NMR insurance still continues, I will still call you for it, and when your game ends,
I will refund the money.

This is the latest incarnation of this team based tournament.  I am helping to lead the Nor'Easter team for people in the Northeast part of the United States.  https://www.facebook.com/groups/123795024327261/ is the Facebook page for the event.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And you can sign up for the Tournament at: http://aqmn.asciiking.com/.
Other US regional teams are the ones in the Pacific, Dixie, and Chicago.
Its unique aspect, that is proving to be a bit distorting but in interesting ways,
is its "solo only" feature.  
You advance from the preliminaries to the finals only by soloing, and then need solos
in the finals against the other soloists.
Though this started in January, it probably will be going on for at least two years,
and there is PLENTY of time to jump in.
As usual, for those who know me well, I screwed up my first game and allowed a solo
to someone from team US.
I still don't have a solo in over three decades, but maybe I can do it in my next game.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So, really, come join, it is being operated on a web-assisted Judge platform that
is really pretty easy to use.  
Ask me if you have any questions.
There is about to be a huge uptick in games starting as September approaches.

I am continuing to note cut or failed support orders with a 
small "s" instead of a capital "S".
This will make it easier on the E-Mailed version of the szine to see
what happened, since the italics don't show there.
The italics DO show on the web page just fine.
Since I'm not postal mailing the szine any more, I've dropped back
to just reporting the disguised E-Mail addresses.
As someone notes, if you need some more contact information, go back to
past issues or ask me.

 Standby lists:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Mike Barno, Dick Martin, Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, Glenn
Petroski, Steve Emmert, Mark Kinney, Vince Lutterbie, Eric Brosius,
Paul Rauterberg, Bob Osuch, Doug Kent, Sean O'Donnell,
Heath Gardner, Paul Kenny, and Jeff O'Donnell
stand by for regular Diplomacy.
Let me know if you want on or off these lists, especially OFF given the new policies.

I'm going to start the game opening list over.  Under the new regime, who wants to
play?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
DIPLOMACY: First off, another regular Diplomacy game is open.  Spencer Sawyer,
Doug Kent and Brad
Wilson are in, anyone else?  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
BREAKING AWAY: Also, a new Breaking Away game is open. 
Currently Andy York, Rick Desper, and Brendan Whyte are on board.
David Burgess or Doug Kent might be willing to play to fill it out.
I'm going to dig up six people to do this next time, be one of them!
This is the game I really like running and want to start another one.
It's easy, very low maintenance.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
1) There seems to be a fairly wide range of coordination this turn, I wonder
what's next.
We're up and running again.
Any interest in joining the new game?
Or maybe the new Breaking Away game?
But then, maybe we're NOT going to keep going...

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) Meanwhile, an EF two-way draw is called for.
If you fail to vote, you veto the proposal.
Please vote with your Summer orders.
No pressure either way.
If you do send me Fall orders by the Summer deadline, we can keep going if you 
want.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE to DAVE, regarding YOUR ORDERS): "Cross your I's and dot your T's."
- Fathead (blues band).

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(MIKE SEZ): For decades I've been a supporter of the Open Access movement in government records, in campaign finance, in corporate accountability, and in environmental impact.  But I knew it had gone too far when I heard this on the radio:  "St. Joseph's Hospital features Open Access Colonoscopy."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BOOB SEZ): We always knew YOU didn't have any interest in doing 
today's work today, but now you ridicule a gastroenterologist who
has figured out that if you eliminate the wait list and see everyone
right away, you still do the same amount of work.

1) We had two medical replacements, as Buddy's son Jim 
(who some of us played with many years ago as James Alan) was 
playing for Buddy as Eric was playing for Terry. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
2) This one sort of ground to a three way draw.  
Thanks to everyone who played.  Endgame statements 
are welcome, I'll print the SC chart next time.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><b><i>LAST WORD:</i>
I am going to combine a few last words this time... first off, I am not
a great cook, nor am I a great griller, but I am converted to the idea
of slow cooking with the grill cover closed.  If you cook chicken wings
at 225 to 250 for about two hours (with minimal lifts to brush more 
butter and marinade on them) with NO direct heat on the wings, only on 
a pan of water and a box of mesquite chips, the result is moist, tender
and heavenly... second, I day-by-day and year-by-year keep remembering
that the people in this Diplomacy hobby are the most amazing people on
the planet, even Doug... and speaking of Doug, send your regards to him
as his beloved dog Kayza (who most of you know from Lifeboat in <i>
Eternal Sunshine</i> has gone to the big kennel in the sky, sincere 
condolences to Doug and Heather.</b>
