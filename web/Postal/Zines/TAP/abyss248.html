<p><br><p><br>``I assure you - this African can tell time.''
Colin Powell to US Agency for International Development head Andrew Natsios
at a State Department briefing after Natsios gave a presentation on how we
could not give anti-retroviral drugs to treat AIDS to African nations because
Africans would not know when to take AIDS drugs effectively.

<p><br><p><br>Ummm, I'm off to Europe trying to slip this in before I leave.
Things are bit disorganized below, but that is why.
We'll see if I can actually PLAY these tournaments well this time.....
                                    
<p>
<p><br><p><br>The postal sub price is now
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
STILL a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
NOTE: See the revised game start announcements below!

<p>
Plus, we are ``taking over the US hobby'' by adding significantly
to my list of subszines.
We have Michael Lowrey's <i>Houdini Blues</i> as a 
Southern branch office in <i>TAP</i>.
Don Williams' sublime publication also will continue to appear here 
as <i>Deny Everything</i>'s takes a major chunk of space in many issues.
This issue, we have the latest <i>Houdini Blues</i>. 

<p>
Check out the connections in the Diplomatic Pouch with all of
the information you need to play Diplomacy on the Internet at:

<p>
I also have taken over the Postal portion of the Pouch:
/Postal/

<p>
 and <i>TAP</i> on the web is there at:
/Postal/Zines/TAP/index.html

<p>
where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 
Also, check out Stephen Agar's more extensive efforts at:
http://www.diplomacy-archive.com and http://www.meurglys.com

Help, David has grabbed and reserved the HIGHLY prized name: www.szine.com!!
David Wang's site used to be the best place to follow 
John Caruso's postal baseball league that I am in.
BUT, the site has not been updated as well in recent times.
THE place to follow the league now is DICKIE-POO Martin's website:
http://www.phantomempire.com where in the ``files'' section, ``baseball''
sub-section, you can see all of the individual and team level stats.
You need to sign up as a ``member'' to see all of the files.
You, too, can chat with John Caruso there, especially on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings.
My team is sinking quickly into the cellar this year, but I have devious
evil plans for NEXT year!!

<p>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is currently &#239;n stasis", although all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<p>
http://www.manorcon.demon.co.uk/octopus/index.html

<p>
Peter is unlikely to be starting any new games in the <i>Octopus</i> until ``at
least the start of 2002." In the meantime, if anyone else fancies
running some choo-choo games here in <i>TAP</i>, both Peter and I would be keen
for someone else to try their hand. 

<p>
By electronic mail, through the Internet, subs are free and can
be obtained automatically by sending the message:
subscribe tap

<p>
 to majordomo of diplom.org and messages can be sent to the entire 
electronic mailing list by mailing them to tap of diplom.org which will forward 
your message to all of the people currently on the list.
The message:

<p>
 unsubscribe tap

<p>
 sent to majordomo of diplom.org gets you off the list.
Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
And of course for FIXING everything this time around!!

<b>THE SEARCH FOR ???</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>We're cancelling the search for Mickey Preston since Paul Kenny already
found him.
I'm looking for other people to search for, otherwise we will take a break.
I need someone ``big'' to announce in #250, please help me think of someone!!!
I will likely choose a missing ``Hobby Award Recipient" from the lists below.

<p>
Or feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Mark, Gregory, Kevin, Al, and Jerry found too!!! 
Note that Brenton Ver Ploeg would love to find Leslie Obata, the woman that Jerry Lucas
used as his front too. 
This could be an easy way toward finding Jerry, though as Brenton notes,
who is to say she has the same name now.
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Mark Berch, Gregory Stewart or Kevin Tighe or Jerry Lucas
or Al Pearson is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<p>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<b>INTERNATIONAL SUBSCRIPTION EXCHANGE NEWS</b></td></table><!--hboxt-->

<p>
<p>The British representative is the editor of
<i>Mission From God</i>, John Harrington.
John may be contacted at 1 Churchbury Close, Enfield, Middlesex
EN1 3UW, UK.

<p>
E-Mail: fiendish of operamail.com, John.Harrington of tfeurope.com 

<p>
Please include the full name and address of the foreign publisher with
your order, if possible, as well as the szine title.
Make your check in US dollars out to me personally or in GBP to John
if you're doing things from that end.
I will conduct business for Canadians as well, if I can, but prefer
to deal in US dollars with them if possible, or Canadian dollars cash.
To subscribe to American szines, the system works in reverse.
There has been some interest in finding a new Australian representative.
Should someone Down Under have an interest, or from anywhere else in
the world, please contact me.
We have added a European continental representative, most of this
traffic likely will occur between Ronald Camstra (in the Netherlands)
and John Harrington, but if anyone here in the US wants to get money
into guilders or then into other continental currencies, we'll try
to help you out.
Ronald Camstra can be contacted at siedler of zonnet.nl
and his home address is: Wielingenplein 48, 3522 PE Utrecht, the Netherlands.
But in Holland it is most common not to send checks but to transfer
money by bank. Dutch people can pay directly to Postbankaccount 4652247
of Ronald Camstra in Utrecht. 
Since he can see the name and
address of the sender in his bankreceipt, people only have to mention
the name of the zine and the editorial address along with their bank order.
Ronald is obviously a huge Settlers of Catan fan.
If you're interested in playing that game internationally by mail,
I think Ronald can help you out.

The new Spring issue should REALLY be out shortly and is worth waiting for.
A ``wrap-up" of the 1999 WorldMasters tournament, plus some other great articles.
It's been in Stephen Agar's processing hands for some time now....
Stephen is going through some MAJOR life changes though, so we don't have it yet,
but believe me it IS worth waiting for.
The previous New Year issue features a doozy of an interview
with Brandon Clarke of New Zealand.
Also, the ``Ruffians'' demo game has a write up with an introduction to the
full negotiation history on the Diplomatic Pouch's Showcase web site.
You can see how our very own Paul Rauterberg was screwed over by former
World Champion Chris Martin not once, not twice, but at least THREE times.
But Chris didn't win.... not that time.
There also are some summaries on all the different ways to play Diplomacy
in the World at the present time and some writeups on last year's major
British Diplomacy conventions.
Kath Collman's write up I found particularly gripping and illuminating reading!
If you want to subscribe in paper form at $3 per issue, 
North American subs should be sent to David Partridge, 
15 Woodland Drive, Brookline, NH 03033, USA. 
Stephen Agar is handling international postal subscriptions and you can write
to him at: 47 Preston Drove, Brighton, BN1 6LA, UK.
Issues from Stephen will cost you 2 GBP in the UK and 3 GBP for the rest of 
the world.

<p>
I will be continuing to resolve the question of the back issue subs.
I have money from Doug Kent now.
If you were a subber to <i>Diplomacy World</i> and explicitly are sure
you DO NOT want your sub filled out or you are sure you DO want your sub
filled out, then please contact me NOW.
I have begun the effort of contacting everyone directly and will finish it shortly.
Thank you to all those who have responded,
especially all of the KIND comments I received about starting this up again.
They were most appreciated.

<p>

 If you need another paper ballot, please let me know.
I sent two copies to each postal publisher I knew of, but I know I missed some.
The Chair also traditionally offers paper copies of the Rod Walker Award
nominations for those people that need them. 
With the exception of the Allan Calhamer book, I will offer the same option
this year.
If you need paper copies, let me know.
Lastly, I thought I needed to publicize the history of the awards as well,

<p>
<p><br><p><br> Oh yes, one other perspective thing that I thought might be fun to note.....
Some of you might not be aware of how large various aspects of the 
electronic hobby have become.
The Judges are only ONE way that people play Diplomacy on the Internet,
but I recently saw these statistics on the numbers of games on each of
the current Judges:
CAMA 1; 
CAWA 3; 
CLDR 12; 
CROA 0; 
DEAC 41; 
DEDO 52; 
FROG 127; 
NZMB 20; 
SEPO 71; 
USBR 15; 
USCA 16; 
USCH 46; 
USCS 7; 
USEF 63; 
USIN 373; 
USOS 0; 
USPT 6; 
USTR 66; 
USTX 33; 
USVG 103; 
for a Grand Total of 1055 current games!
The largest Judge is Dave Kleiman's USIN Judge with 373 games.
Many of you may remember when Dave had a postal Diplomacy szine.
This is not unlike having a Diplomacy szine with 373 games in it!
The FROG is the French Judge and USVG is the special ``Vermont
Group" Judge and also has its own szine like aspects to it.
I just wanted to give some of the postal subbers here a sense
of how big the hobby is these days..... 
speaking of the French hobby:

I'd love to play in <i>TAP</i> but not now, I'll move from Nice
to Paris in about a month and lose email access for about

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Mike Barno (Wed, 04 Jul 2001 20:12:09 -0400)</b>

<p>
The third annual LabCon invitation-only housecon was held at Bruce and 
Krissi Linsey's place a half-hour southeast of Albany.  Forty-one 
people and four dawgs.  Some came late because of the WBC in Hunt 
Valley, some were just there for a day or two, Claire Brosius left early 
to fly to Ireland, and Krissi left early to fly to Seattle.  Jim 
McCarthy and Donna Balkan are going to Origins this weekend.

<p>
Old postal Dippers included Bruce, me, Tom Swider (2 days), Paul 
Gardner, Nelson Heintzman, Dave Lincoln, and Steve and Linda 
Courtemanche.  Game designer and Gathering of Friends organizer Alan 
Moon couldn't make it this year, with only a day between returning from 
Germany and heading off somewhere else.  No Dip was played, but when I 
left, the count was about 145 sessions of over 100 different game titles 
from Thursday afternoon to Wednesday 11 am.  The stragglers will go 
until Thursday morning so they'll be over 150 games. [ended up being
166 games of 105 different titles]

<p>
I played 23 games, 20 different titles, and learned 12 new games. 
(About half are ``new" in the sense of ``released in the last year or 
so.")  All these counts are personal high scores.

<p>
Worst score was my dog's in the Check the Woods realtime event, when she 
rolled in goose-goo or something, and apparently led another visiting 
dog to roll in the same stuff.  Sarah Lincoln and I got to shampoo two 
dogs, a whole different game than the indoor ones.  Their dog was not 
offered a ride home unshampooed.

<p>
Your brother made an appearance and got into a few games, at least one 
or two with me.  He played FTF Dip and played postal games of some sort 
in Krissi's old zine.  One might have been Dip so Dave may be 
technically eligible for the ``old postal Dippers" category.  I think 
that's true after further memory-search.

<p>
Hang on, I'll get my list:

<p>
Thursday:  I spent all day researching and editing the Diplomatic Corps 
website update, and didn't get to the Linsey estate until 10:30 pm. 
When the game in progress finished after midnight, we chatted instead of 
starting a game.

<p>
Friday:  Office Politics (John Harrington's Fiendish Games), Witch Trial 
(Cheapass Games), The Princes of Florence (Rio Grande English edition of 
Alea German original), and Titan (the former Avalon Hill).  OP and WT 
were new to me.

<p>
Saturday:  Turf Master, Uno, Crokinole (the old pub game), The Traders 
of Genoa (another Alea/Rio Grande game), and Stephenson's Rocket 
(Pegasus/Rio Grande).  TM, C, and tToG were new to me.

<p>
Sunday:  2 Crokinole team games (we switched partners and I was on both 
winning teams so I ``won" overall), Ohne Furcht und Adel (Hans im Gluck), 
Loopin' Louie (the only pure ``kids' game" I played), Lowenherz, Code 
777, and Survivor (based on the USA versions of the TV series, and the 
only game I loathed all week).  C777 and S were new to me.

<p>
Monday:  Tayu and Taj Mahal (Alea/Rio Grande).  Both were new to me. 
Took my only long drive (south past Hudson) this evening.

<p>
Tuesday:  Volldampf, Crokinole, Frischfisch (2F Games - Fresh Fish, not 
2F's Fresh Flesh), and Castle (of Descartes's Blue Box series).  All but 
Croak-in-the-Hole were new to me.

<p>
Wednesday:  Clean the Bugs Off the Tent, Strike and Pack the Tent, Try 
to Remember That Bugs are a Part of Earth's One Interdependent Ecosystem 
Too.  Played no strategy games so I could get home and pay my rent 
before my landlord heads to Germany for a couple of weeks, and scan 94 
waiting e-mails.  At least most are from the WDC list or from Allan 
Calhamer himself.

<p>
Also I taught Roads &amp; Boats to Tom Swider but we didn't spend 3-4 hours 
playing it.
You want reviews of these games?  I haven't selected a favorite yet, but 
the Survivor game is the opposite of favorite.

Pitkissers Brag about WBC in Baltimore

<p>
Don't shoot the messenger . . . I want there!

<p>
It was a glorious weekend for Pitkissers at Hunt Valley. Our own took 4 of
the 7 best country awards and, for the second year in a row, The Golden
Blade. The sting of our wrath was felt throughout the weekend by all who are
not us. That we failed to claim the tournament championship was mere
coincidence, a fluke of the draw and of history. The relevant fact is that
we awed all who fell before us. They are our bitches.

<p>
Top honor goes to our very own Brian Lee, who may well be finding out with
this message that he won The Golden Blade for a stab in which he, as
Austria, took all of Italy's home centers in a single turn. We have your
Blade, Brian, and if you look between your ribs at the next gathering,
you'll find it there waiting for you.

<p>
CONGRATULATIONS BRIAN!!!!  There is no award that brings a larger tear to
our collective eye or lump to our collective throat. Brian Lee, ladies and
gentlemen.

<p>
Other news:

<p>

<p>
5th: Tom Pasko (who is one of us emeritus)

<p>
4th: Doug Faust (who, as I said, will be one of us)

<p>
3rd: Al Ugaz (who should be one of us)

<p>
2nd: Marshall

<p>
1st: Nick Benedict (who is, all Pitkissers will likely agree, a hoser)

<p>
Saturday Night Drunken Outloud Dip Soloist: Brian Ecton

<p>
There were, of course, many major feats of drunken hilarity, both on and off
the board. Sheer numbers, not to mention laws imposing certain limits on
freedom of expression, prevent us from recounting them in writing. It is
safe to say that a pretty damn thoroughly good time was had by all those we
care about.

<p>
A final note on the weekend: we have a new legend to which we should all bow
down and sing heroic tales of worship. Our very own Mr. Brian Ecton spent
SIX YEARS (!!!) in an alliance with a single other Pitkisser. This historic
alliance, to which Brian hewed without regard for his own well-being, ended
tragically when Brian counterknifed his faithless hussy of an ally one sad
spring 1907 morning. But that's not the point.

<p>
Brian's partner in this should and will remain nameless here. He's just a
guy we all know. He could have been any of us. He is any of us, and all of
us.

<p>
THE MAN here is Brian Ecton, who acted selflessly, pure of heart, in regard
only for the tournament standing of Pitkissers at large, when he undertook
this legendary journey. His faith and loyalty should be remembered warmly by
every one of us.

<p>
And, of course, he's the only one of our sorry lot who won a solo over the
weekend.

<p>
Congratulations to our decorated heroes and thanks to all for one hell of a
DonCon in every respect.

I don't know what you think, but I think the kids missed their appointment

it a stone cold killer, someone that is stoned and looking for more money to 
stay stoned, or an 8 year old kid that wants money for a candy bar and didn't 
know the difference between right and wrong, I want them dead ASAP. I also 
feel that as a citizen of this country, I owe that to other citizens that 
lose their lives and my government is reneging on it's social contract every 
time it keeps one of the bastards (or bitches) alive.

<p>

<i>((You know it.... ;-)  I am not philosophically totally opposed to the
Death Penalty, but I am not happy about applying it and when it is
I would prefer applying it only with those extreme cases like McVeigh.
NOT with kids.
But that shouldn't surprise you much.... I do VERY MUCH like the
idea of locking people up for life with no possibility of parole
though.  In many ways it is a harsher punishment.  McVeigh WANTED
out easy and got it.  In the end, with these kids, I might prefer
to see them kept in prison longer, but it would be about how 
rehabilitated they were and how likely they were to cause problems
in society.
And I am much more sympathetic with those who take even stronger
opinions against death penalties.
I believe in society protecting itself, but not in inhumane
punishment.
I will try to get my Brit subbers to react though.  They likely
are closer to my position.))</i>

<p>
I guess I'm more interested in simple efficient justice. Also frankly, I feel 
the bulk of the people who murder (add attempted murder as well, I don't 
think they should get a break for incompetence) are equal to, and should be 
treated like, a rabid dog.  You don't try to understand it, you just 
eliminate it. There is no reason to build and finance kennels to lock them up 
for the rest of their lives. There is no way in hell any of them should be 
let out on the streets again, something that seems way too common nowadays.

<p>
I could see harvesting useful organs before they go, but I would hate to see 
a law forcing it put into effect. Odds are eventually people who don't belong 
there would find themselves on death row because of a perfect match with a 
powerful big shot.

<p>
A life for a life equals justice for me. Rehabilitation should take a 
back-seat to justice and paying for one's crimes. Regarding a life sentence 
being harsher, I disagree. Either way, I have no desire to be sadistic or 
harsh.

``The Boston Red Sox have not won a World Series since 1918, supposedly
because they sold Babe Ruth to the New York Yankees.  Lifelong Red Sox fan
Paul Giorgio of Boston is trying to break that long, sad tradition in his

On the advice of a Tibetan Buddhist holy man, the 37-year-old Giorgio

and burned a New York Yankees cap."

The alert reader will wonder how you start a fire at 29,000 feet given the

I just can't pass up to opportunity to rail against the dumbing down of our

thou?". In a bookshop here in Austrlaia, I saw a copy of Homer's Odessy in a

book of the film, or the book that inspired the film, some hogwash like 
that. I think an awful lots of kiddies are gonna be mighty disappointed when 
they actually try to read their Christmas present this year...
Almost as bad as changing "George III" to "The madness" thereof, because our 
American cousins would think it a sequel to something they'd never seen. Or 
renaming "flying high" as &#196;irplane" because Americans thought it was about 
drugs. Or subtitling Ken Loach films, not with the actual English dialogue, 
but with the American equivalent heretoforeunto... I remember the audience 
cracking up when "Hey guv, there's a geezer on the blower" was subtitled as 
"Phone for you, sir". So much for globulisation.

``The Fast and The Furious" ... a movie

<p>
Once again Vin Diesel has blown me away.  I have only seen him twice.  I'm 
sure it was only twice because he has my full attention when he is on screen. 
 He looks dangerous.  He moves dangerous.  I first saw him in ``Pitch Black" 
when he was playing a serial killer in a distant future, crash landed on a 
barren planet with a mixed bag of potential victims.  This time he is a 
charismatic street racer whose `team' finances fast cars through street 
piracy.

<p>
The story is without much logic, and depends a lot on the action to carry it. 
But, somehow the conflict Paul Walker faces as an undercover cop, between 
needing to catch the hijackers and falling in love with his suspects sister, 
gives it surprising depth.

<p>
The action is outstanding.  Major stunts.  Outstanding camera work.  
Wonderful sound mixing.  Lots of adrenaline.  So even if the story does lack 
a cohesiveness, it still works.

<p>
This is one of those `B' movies that is lots better than it should be.

``Lara Croft: Tomb Raider" a movie

<p>
What can I say.  Move over ``Xena", step aside ``Buffy", there's a new sheriff 
in town and her name is ``Lara Croft"...they call her ``Tomb Raider".

<p>
Unlike the first two, Lara doesn't have super powers.  More like ``Batman" all 
she has is a huge personal fortune, a brilliant mind, and constant physical 
practice to hone her skills.  That and a huge following of teenage boys who 
play her game, hoping against hope to uncover the secret codes.

<p>
The movie is very true to the video game.  That is, the sets in the tombs 
look a lot like the game.  When Lara jumps and dodges and fights for her 
life, it looks a lot like the inside of the game.

<p>
There isn't a whole lot of story, but what there is works.  What there is a 
whole lot of is action, with Angelina Jolie doing some pretty amazing stunts. 
 She is, by the way, about as perfect a choice for ``Lara Croft" as could have 
been made.

The title is all wrong.  This has nothing to do with intelligence, artificial 
or otherwise.  It is about Love.  Love doesn't require any sort of 
intelligence.  It requires emotion.  Haley Joel Osment plays David, the first 
robot designed to feel emotions.  The first robot designed to love.  Sadly, 
the ones he is designed to love are humans, and far less worthy of his love 
than they should be.

<p>
The world Spielberg devises is wonderfully complex.  Once again, computer 
animation makes the impossible film seem real.  But for all the wonderfulness 
of the world and the animation, it is the story of a little boy whose love is 
much more real than he is that is the center of all this.  His quest to find 
the Blue Fairy so that she can make him real (so his mother will love him, 
too) is about the saddest story I have seen in a long long while.

<i>((Agreed.
In the end, after MUCH thought, I zeroed in on the issue that bothered me the
most about this movie: the attempt to create a clear dichotomy between mecha
and human and the hoary plot line about mecha's taking over for humans.
I see the AI issue as a challenge of ``interface''.
We want better ``interfaces'' between us and our machines.
But we don't want mechas to replace humans, children or otherwise.
There was an attempt to justify it, but it didn't wash.
Plus, the humans were none too human.
``Mom'' did a bunch of things that made absolutely no human sense, including
``activating'' David's ``emotion chip'' (another problem.... most of this has
been played better by Data on Star Trek in a much more adult way) without even
consulting her husband.
Where was that??
And, like Roger Ebert, I wanted to know what REALLY happened to Mom - that was
the human story.
In the end: too much of a 1950's/1960's story, not informed by the expansion of
the capabilities and uses of computers.
We want ``AI'' to improve human/computer interfaces, not make computers that
look like humans.))</i>

<p>
<p>REGULAR Diplomacy Game Opening for E-Mail Oriented Players: Tim Miller,
Daniel M&#233;hkeri, Jim Sayers, Allan Heikkinen, 
Adam Mitchell, and Chris Lockheardt are signed up. 
This game is FREE, but you have to be pretty active on E-Mail or I won't
let you in, we need just ONE more player.....

<p>
LAWYERS GAME: Steve Koehler, Stephen Agar and Steve Emmert already have signed up.
We're searching for lawyers, contact me if you have any leads!
We've invited Thomas Libby and Edwin Turnage but they have turned us down.

Official standby for the game is David Hood.
HELP!!!

<p>
Eric Ozog will be running Air-Sea Diplomacy some time in the future.
You can contact Eric at ElfEric of Juno.com if you are interested in
the game.
I'll publish the rules closer to a time when Eric wants it to start.

I've decided to kill the Star Trek Diplomacy opening.  
It clearly wasn't resonating.
I think I'll try again when Colonia ends.
Sorry about that everyone.
I owe Chris Trent $20 back, but according to my records I don't 
have money from anyone else.
If you think that is incorrect, let me know.

<p>

<p>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and Chris Lockheardt is pulling out of that opening too,
so I need three players.
Eoghan Barry is signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!

<p>
1) I committed the Cardinal GM error in this game last turn.... I lost a player's
orders!
This is, as Mike Barno says, an egregious error!
Anyway, then Warren went away on a vacation (the player whose orders were lost)
and I couldn't reach him.
We reconstructed the orders with no advantage to Goz and he submitted the above
orders PRIOR to deadline.
Note the corrected supply center chart and builds.
All players were notified PRIOR to deadline.

despot to do when the GM is against him?

<p>
(JIM-BOB to GOZ): Take the egregious errors when you can get them, how
about if next time we get you with something that can't be easily fixed??

<p>
(TURKEY to ENGLAND):  You know, you talk a lot more than Germany, but you
don't say any more.

(BOOB to TURKEY): Maybe he is one of Ambassador Pollard's rat-bastards.....
no, maybe there is other present company to which he is referring, eh??

<p>
(SHREEVY'S BAR): [Tongue in Cheek Press].
<i>((You mean any of the press in this game is NOT meant tongue in cheek....
hyork, hyork, hyork!!!))</i>
The barkeep tried to wipe 
Buddy from the bar counter with his soapy rag.  However, Buddy grabbed 
a'holt' of the corner of that rag, and road back and forth on the beer 
foamed bar top, landing, finally, in the kitchen sink.  Opps!  What's 
this.  The bar keep is rinsing his rag in the sudsy water, and reaching 
for the plug with the other hand.  Oh!  No!  Not down the proverbial 
drain.

<p>
Lucky for good ole' buddy Buddy that Shreevy showed up to ask for 
another beer.  The bar keep let go of the plug, once again saving the 
life of one beer soaked Buddy.

<p>
The bar keep served Shreevy his one too many beers and reached once 
again for the plug.  Buddy took a gamble and dove into the sudsy waters, 
all the way to the bottom, and wrapped his leg [no, not the middle leg!] 
around the chain that connected the plug with the top of the sink.  The 
water wooshed down the drain, and Buddy was finally able to breath in, 
blowing soap bubbles as he breathed out.  He climbed the chain to the 
top of the sink, looked around, and made a mad dash for the cuff of 
Shreevy's shirt sleeve, hiding, and finally resting, tucked under 
Shreevy's watch band.  Knowing that Shreevy never took a bath, Buddy 
felt safe once again, and for the moment.

<p>
(ABOARD HMS INDUTABE(LY) JUNE 28, 1906): 
Admiral Hood wiped his brow and heaved a deep sigh of relief. Things 
hadn't gone so badly, after all. He had managed to countermand the 
King's last set of commands at the last minute by simply throwing the 
briefcase full of Edward's orders overboard. Hopefully, no one will ever 
find them Hood thought. The King had departed for Lisbon, there to meet 
Pope Terence I and his fellow monarch, the pipsqueak, Victor Emmanuel. 
Finally, everything was back to normal, the crisis had passed. Instead 
of a court-martial he might now be in line for a fleet command. 

<p>
(THE PORTUGUESE RIVIERA, JULY 1, 1906): The Pope sits dressed only in a thong that 
would see better duty as a very small sling shot.  Four Pilgrims come up 
and kneel before him.

<p>
After a bit King Willy politely coughs.  After a slightly longer 
wait the Kaiser burps and the Pope comes out of his slumber.
   
<p>
``Oh yeah, da new Saint's.  Ok, here's da deal.  You keep Raoul 
Rauterberg and Kinky What's His Name The Turk dancing the dance and 
youse will be Saints."  He glances at the Tsar who has a finger up to 
the knuckle in his nasal cavity and shudders.  At this point the Kaiser 
belches and passes out as a dozen or so empties fall out of his pockets. 
 The King of England has the decency to look embarrassed as the French 
President winks lewdly at one of the beach boys.
   
<p>
``Yeah, Saints.  Oy Vey!"

<p>
(RUSSIA to TURKEY): Okay!  Okay!  However, I opt for the second plan. 
Let me know!

<p>
(ABOARD THE IMPERIAL RUSSIAN BATTLESHIP AURORA JUNE 30, 1906): ``Do not 
worry your Highness, we get you to the Cathedral on time. Now is time 
for more vodka!", Admiral Tretyakski bellowed as he slapped King Edward 
VII on his back (almost knocking him over). The Captain of the Aurora, 
Ivan Zailitskiy, teary eyed spoke next, ``Da, your Highness, what you did 
was like a true Russian, rescuing your fellow King. Please, to have 
another toast to your courage!" With that, Captain Zailitskiy gave King 
Edward VII a great bear hug (almost squashing poor `Teddy'). ``More 
vodka!" bellowed Tretyakski, ``for our hero, Zeddyski!"

<p>
(LONDON JULY 31, 1906): The Foreign Secretary, Lord Fairfax, has announced that 
negotiations with Austria-Hungary will commence soon. A senior foreign 
ministry official will meet with an Austro-Hungarian counterpart in 
Switzerland for confidential discussions.

1) Keeping on track....

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA):  Look again.  I could have very little effect on 
whether Turkey reaches 18.  I would describe your ``A Warsaw-Prussia, A 
Silesia-Berlin" last turn as being much closer to ``handing this game to 
[Turkey] on a silver platter."

<p>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA AGAIN):  Anyhow, why aren't you yelling at the other 
players?  Roland hasn't written me.  John hasn't written me.  Jim has 
blown off my offers that were probably better than anyone else offered 
him, and as a result I am getting exactly what I would have gotten had I 
written to nobody.  So why should I have done what <i>only you</i> wanted me 
to do - which amounted to nothing at all, anyway?

<p>
(ITALY to ALL): While I was getting my life in order, or trying to, I 
really let this game get out of hand...I apologize...now, I'm back.  Well, 
sorta close to back.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The concession to Italy is rejected.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE NATION OF ITLAY):
Ambassador. I have vaited too long to say zis....but my exiled nation now declares 
War on the country of Italy...Za Pope is unt mad. He and your goverment must be 
brought down....God help my fellow Austrians who vill fight to za death....

<p>
(GENERAL FLASHMAN to THE ITALIAN HIGH COMMAND):
Well old chaps. Will you lay your colors down now and surrender or do we have 
to enter the field of combat?

<p>
(PALACE-ON-THE-RUN OF LIGHT AND GLORY):  Since Our Lord in his infinite 
abusability decried the Negative and lauded the Positive, the 
still-slightly-mighty and still-slightly-glorious Ottoman Empire is 
responding worshipfully.  Turkish efforts shall now be concentrated upon 
Increasing Above Zero.

<p>
(TURKEY to ITALY):  In a very Positive spirit, I ask my brother the 
Italian commander-in-chief what concessions I might make to dissuade the 
four unhindered Italian units from displacing the one Turkish unit that 
could get two supports both cuttable by units other than the four 
attackers.  As two partial inducements, Italy is offered 90% of the 
Ottoman Crown Treasury and the chair of Chancellor in the Ottoman 
imperial government.  How else can we help a compromise be reached, good 
sir?  Please advise.

<p>
(OTTOMAN PUBLIC RELATIONS FIELD OFFICE [i.e. the back of the Jeep]):  To 
discuss our Government's concession vote in a fully Positive light, we 
must look at the broader picture.  Whomever might achieve Hegemony 
first, and thus be acclaimed Victor, deserves the honor and satisfaction 
of earning full Glory by <b>PROVING IT</b>.

<p>
(TURKEY to ITALY regarding concessions):  Claims to victory have a net 
value of Zero.  <b>PROVING IT</b> is the only way to generate Positive 
value.  There are plenty of ways to generate Negative value but those 
are not helpful toward the goals in our system.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The RAG draw is reproposed.
Since I received this proposal from multiple parties, it is worth 
reiterating some of TAP's rules on these votes.
I will not verify who proposes draw votes OR who votes on them.
You are welcome to write press, but since press is black, I
don't verify anything there either.
Still, write what you like.
Most importantly, draw votes must be UNANIMOUS among all players
in the game, and you should make sure each season that I know how
you are voting.
And players who don't vote will veto the proposal.
Now, let's vote with our Winter orders, shall we??

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(ENGLAND to GERMANY): Last chance - either join with me or I'm sending my
fleets to bombard your coast!  

<p>
(BOOB to ENGLAND): I think his decision is clear....

<p>

Hun.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) I am going BACK to the designer rules for Breaking Away that allow
cards of greater than 15 to be replenished. 
The Breaking Away bonus is earned only on the FIRST turn that you 
break away from the pack. 
I printed the original postal rules in Issue #239, if you need a copy
and don't have that issue, just ask.

<p>
2) The number in parentheses is what you played, the last card in your
list is the one you replenished with.

<p>
3) Square 1 is a very, very crowded square, so everyone there replenishes
with just a 3.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(RIDERS to QUABBINS): Just keep the flow going; you should be ok!

<p>
(QUADRILATERALS - BOOB):  What, the race is starting, wait a minute,
where's the pedal, gotta tie my shoe, whoops... , oops... okay,
give us a minute, we'll get moving soon.

<p>
(BOOB to QUADRILATERALS): We ain't waitin' for nobody, no how!
The gun has sounded!!!

<p>
(RIDERS to BRITS): Better form a pack.  You wouldn't want us jackmen to
ride you down.

<p>
(STARTER to CYCLISTS):  Don't crowd each other, boys!  There will be plenty of
time for that later.

<p>
(BOOB to STARTER): I don't think they were listening!!!

<p>
(WHITE MAID to PETEY): Keep your crew on the ground or ther'll be fethers
flying.

<p>
(TINAMOU - PARTRIDGE): Hi!  Don't try to edit me while the race is ongoing!

<p>
(TINAMOU DAVE - RICK): Pardon me, but tinamou can fly.  It may not be
graceful, but it is flight!

<p>
(TOM to GM): You think these teams without coaches nor managers have any
chance?

<p>
(BOOB to TOM): Nope, I don't think they have a prayer.....
and when did the White Maid take spelling??  In the fifteenth century???

<p>
(PEERY - WORLD) :P

<p>
(PETEY - GM):  Apparently the A rider and D rider of the Border Riders are
married.  I would have found out more, but the browser is not working
right now.

<p>
(THE BRIT PACK): As for the names of the riders in Tom Howell's team, if they 
are fictional 
characters then Sir Walter Scott sounds a likely candidate for the author, or 
maybe Robert Louis Stevenson.

<p>
(TOM to BOOB): You're not supposed to give them half the answer with the
Question!  That's like giving Alice a head start!
And, to be sure, Alice is geting no head start from me!!!

<p>
(BOOB to TOM): Sounds more like The Brit Pack have given us the 50-50.
I'm done trying ;-)

<p>
(TOM to BOOB): Well, I've finished the book those names came from...  
and started the sequel...
Now, it appears that Queen Mary may make an appearance in this tale.  I
can't say for sure, as I'm only into the second chapter (didn't take the
book with me on the trip last week!).  I'll keep you updated.

<p>
<i>((I got guesses from some of the players... Brit Pack
had it to two possibilities, but Scott
somehow sounded right to me....))</i>

<p>
Scott it is!  The name of the book?

<p>
(BRIT PACK RAMBLINGS): I note that the Bad Boys includes Charlie Brown.  
Isn't this a bit like putting Floyd Patterson in a team called the 
Wild Men Of The Ring?

<p>
Incidentally, Britain's very own Dennis the Menace, as featured in the comic 
The Beano, is 50 years old this year, having made his debut in the comic back 
in 1951.  He's a somewhat less lovable rascal than his American namesake, with 
over 1,500,000 members of his fan club, the majority of which, I would guess, 
are over 30.

<p>
Finally, I should just like to add my support to your view on Jeri Ryan/7 of 
9.  She doesn't do much for me but I don't think the severe hairstyle, face 
make-up and costume help her much.  I've seen pictures of her in civvies 
(civilian clothes) and she looks a lot better.  I'm not sure whether it is 
appropriate to include ``every woman Kirk kissed" among the Star Trek babes 
when trying to determine the best, as not everyone can remember who they were.
<i>((Precisely the point.... I was partly kidding.... Spock only kissed
a few women like Mariette Hartley who also beats out Jeri Ryan in my book,
even today.))</i>
On the other hand it is relatively easy to remember who were lookers among 
the regular cast members.  Like you, I like both the Dax incarnations but I 
think my favourite is Marina Sirtis, although I may be biased as she is a 
local girl and supports Spurs, as do I.

<p>
I recognise it takes all sorts though.  Every year my erstwhile co-editor and 
I would choose our ``Thinking Man's Crumpet" for that year and he'd invariably 
choose some blonde with startling eyes such as Sharon Stone, and I'd choose a 
brunette with cheekbones that could slice cheese, such as Joanne Whalley or 
Lisa Bonet.

<p>
Strange then that I should marry a blonde, but thankfully there is a 
difference between real life and fantasy. Women are all brunettes with the 
lights off, anyway!

1) Check out the Modern Dip web page at:

<p>
2) I'm going to start a quiet interest list down here in the next Modern game.
I don't want to start it until this game is done or nearly done, but with
ten players it may take awhile, so I'll start now.
Rick Desper is in to be one of the players.

<p>
3) Sorry, have to hold some press this time around (guess whose?
Yes, the press I have to type.).

<p>
<p><br><p><br> <i>Press:</i>

<p>
(THE MEKONS QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``Confess, confess!'' 
``I thought I had already, a long time ago.''
From comments on ``Tina'' off of <i>Journey to the End of the Night</i>.

<p>
(BRI to UKR): I don't recall mentioning that you could capture that 
dot.  Refresh my memory, would you please?

<p>
(ROME): Be aware that any press which has originated from ``Italy" over the
last couple seasons was black press.  Not that it matters anymore.

<p>
(SPAIN-GERMANY): Ok, so what you've made a deal with Britain, it isn't like its 
a bright move to take intell from the enemy. Britain what say you?

<p>
(SPAIN-ITALY): Not bad for a 17-20 year old wouldn't you agree..

<p>
(ITALY-BOARD): Who was that masked man?

<p>
(ROME-WORLD): The Ferengi have exhausted all diplomatic options.  We await
the end.  It is very cold in space....

<p>
(ROME-CAIRO AND MADRID): Eat crow, O'Donnells!
