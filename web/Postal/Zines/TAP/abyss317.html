<br /><br />OK - READ THIS - The "first" #316 last time was a fake, 
I just don't know HOW that got in there..... no, that's not quite right,
I do know, but I'm not going to tell you.
But ***I*** didn't do it, and since I've been using THIS typeface forever, and
the fake did not use it, I figured you would all figure out it was a fake.
Especially after I did have a "regular" #316 that followed it.
Anyway, I thought it was at least reasonably amusing.
As a result, I had to delay some results to my next December 6 deadline, see below
for specifics on your game.  If you cannot continue, please let me know, so I 
can replace you.

Thanks, for the second straight cover from Doug Kent.
I really appreciate his efforts to assist, especially since there is so much
<i>Eternal Sunshine</i> inside.
Enjoy!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I expect ALL players to be signed up on the E-Mail notification list for the szine,
see below.
Some of you have been complaining about this, but it is up to you to get on this list,
it's easy, come ask me if you have trouble.
THIS IS A PROBLEM, sign up now if you're playing!!!

The postal sub price is still
$1.50 per issue in the US and Canada,
with double that for other foreign subbers(or $3.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and future game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$20.00 ($15.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance.
Anyone may play in subszines 
for free and just jack up the issue page count.
Since I have to get caught up this issue with all sorts of subszines, 
I'm going to be fairly limited with other items this issue.  
See the revised game start announcements below!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 where the szine resides in html format. 
Presently, issues from #190 to the current issue
are there, and I will be updating the back issues gradually someday. 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter Sullivan's subszine is back in stasis, but all the
back issues can be accessed via :

<div class="p"><!----></div>
http://www.burdonvale.co.uk/octopus/index.html.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Peter is now back at least sometimes he is producing this new fannish thing
called <i>Virtual Tucker Hotel</i> that you can find at
http://efanzines.com/VTH/.
Rip Gooch is probably permanently missing as a subszine, but he has 
a cool facebook page and you can keep track of him there.
Dave Partridge had been picking up the choo-choo
game slack.
Contact Dave
at rebhuhn of rocketmail.com for more info on getting into choo-choo games
and other sorts of different games.
And Andy York and Doug Kent have been my most frequent subszine guests lately!!!
Andy has been in every issue, thanks, Andy!!!
And Doug Kent has been coming out faster than <i>TAP</i> lately, so
many issues have been having multiple <i>Eternal Sunshine</i>'s. 
I haven't heard from Michael Lowrey lately but he gets his in every few issues too!
So, we have a full set of subszines at the moment.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The <i>TAP</i> mailing list has moved!
It now is even BETTER protected than it was.
I even have a bit of trouble posting to it.
To post to this list, send your email to: tap of diplom.org.
But this is completely moderated, it won't go out to the list unless
I approve it.
In general, I intend to keep traffic down to just the szine, as we've
been doing and I'll put your LOCs in here.
I <b>EXPECT</b> all players to be on this list, especially those of you who
are from foreign countries!!! 
You need this to find out when the szine is up on the web to check in on results.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
General information about the mailing list is at:
http://www.diplom.org/mailman/listinfo/tap

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You can sign up from there, or send E-Mails to:
Tap-request of diplom.org;
with the word `help' in the subject or body (don't include the
quotes), and you will get back a message with instructions.
You must know your password to change your options (including changing
the password, itself) or to unsubscribe.  
Normally, Mailman will remind you of your diplom.org mailing list
passwords once every month, although you can disable this if you
prefer.  This reminder will also include instructions on how to
unsubscribe or change your account options.  There is also a button on
your options page that will email your current password to you.
A big, big thank you for Millis Miller for setting this all up!!

Jerry Jones gets added to the list of failures, next up the former
editor of <i>Moeshoeshoe</i>, along with Michel Liesnard one of the 
founders of the Belgian Diplomacy hobby.
If you read <i>Diplomacy World</i> #101 you will 
quickly figure out why I chose Michel Feron to search for next.
There are a host of clues on the Internet that I found, so he 
could be very easy to find. 
Go for it, you have until Issue #320.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am running out of people on MY list of who to search for, so
I am looking for ideas, who would you like to find?
Send me some names.
I will likely go into all these szines that Doug Kent is posting
and find some more szine editors to search for, that's
what I usually do, but I'd like to find people that some of you
will search for or want to find!!!
This actually is giving me a HUGE number of possible ideas for
people to search for, but I can be focused or induced.
Come on, help me out.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Feel free to spend the time looking for some of the backlog.
Let's get Jerry, Margaret, Derek, Sylvain, Steve, Ed, Tom, Gregory, and 
ESPECIALLY Kevin found too!!!
This is a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new "search for" every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Jerry Jones or Margaret Gemignani or 
Steve Heinowski or Ed Henry or Tom Hurst or 
Gregory Stewart or Derek Nelson or Sylvain LaRose or John Smythe
is "found" from now on it is worth $25.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br />Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, finance a web page, 
GO TO A DIPLOMACY CONVENTION or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who "found" him.

John Harrington and I have agreed to close the ISE.
In this age of PayPal, the traffic on the ISE had fallen almost to zero,
and what was left almost entirely was me facilitating orders of 
Breaking Away and John's other Fiendish Games.
So, I'm still going to help John out with that, but there will be no
ISE.
If anyone still needs assistance with this, though, since I'm helping
John out, like if you're in a foreign country and need to send dollars

I was going to publish the award ballot for this year

then do that.... and then, well, REAL SOON NOW!!!
And when I do, I'm going to give out three sets of awards and get caught up for the

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<br /><br /><i>Diplomacy World</i> Issue Deadlines are now:

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Winter 2009, Issue #104: beginning of January; theme is
Worldwide Variants, we will have articles on Colonia VIIb, Known World 901,
and many more.  A new <i>DW</i> Demo Game in Known World 901 will also start, 
this variant is one of those David Cohen designed variants and it already has
been pretty extensively playtested.  If any of you are interested in playing,
let me know.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Spring 2009, Issue #105: beginning of April; theme is "The
Endgame", what have you always wanted to know or read about about end game 
strategy, we'll feature it here.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Summer 2009, Issue #106: beginning of July; theme is 
"Historical Variants" from pre-1900.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Deadline Fall 2009, Issue #107: beginning of October; theme is
"Balance of Power", arguably the key concept in all of Diplomacy, Eric Hunter,
Doug and I just realized that there are NO good articles around that actually
describe it.  The founder of the feast, Mr. Calhamer, of course has written on
it a couple of times, but he has, well, a singular view.  I hope we get a lot
of excellent articles on this topic, I'm writing one.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
These last few issues have been really tremendous, if you've not looked at them 
yet, go look!
And for any issue, we're taking articles on ANY subject, let us know!!!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
See http://www.diplomacyworld.net/ for some exciting back issue material being
posted as well as the new Issues, including the monstrous Issue #100.  
Highlights of #100 include Walt Buchanan's ex-wife Carol showing us who REALLY
was in charge of the hobby back in the Hoosier Archives days, Eric Ozog augmenting
the oft-heard, but never get enough of, love story between Eric and Cathy,
and the start of the new Diplomacy World Demo Game.

We were running a "23 tunes" contest here
(stolen blatantly from Mark Wightman and the late lamented <b>The Sprouts of Wrath</b>.
If anyone would like to send me a tape or CD of their 23 (which was the original point)
that would be great, but I don't intend to require that.  I will be playing in the
sense that I'll be putting 23 tunes in, and you have to guess me, but I obviously
won't score points.
Send commentary with your choices, and we'll see if people can
guess who you are!!!
And already there is a LOT of diversity in defining tunes and styles, so 
BE CREATIVE!!!
This kind of died, mostly because of me.  I don't want to take this last issue
getting it back together, but see the new rules below, we're going to start over.
Feel free to send along general music comments any time.

<b><i>23 Tunes Game</i></b></td></tr></table><!--hboxt-->

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Here are the rules for 23 TUNES.  
You send me ONE tune each issue, or a whole list, but I reveal them one tune at a
time over the next 23 issues.
If you missed earlier turns, you can still catch up by sending enough tunes to
catch up in subsequent issues, and guess on submitters each issue.
When you are CORRECT and guess someone correctly, I will tell you, but you
can only guess one person for each list each turn.
I am also submitting my tunes.
I will tell people each issue how many people have guessed them correctly, so 
you can tell that you're being predictable and try to take your list in another
direction.
After we're done, I'd like to exchange CD's/Tapes for as many of the tunes players
as possible, but this is not required.
I'll be sending the winner both my LAST 23 tune list and my NEW 23 tune list.
The winner is determined by having you guess each issue who submitted what list
(I am now NOT telling you who the submitters are).  
For each list you get right, you get
a point, you also can win bonus points from me for really cool tune selections
or daring explanations (to encourage you to write things about the songs).
You lose a point for each person who gets your list right.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
WHAT I NEED: 
At least one tune and an explanation or comment.  I'll add one tune
to each list each issue.  You will always be able to catch up by
giving me enough tunes to catch up.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
One fine thing about the digital age is that it's enabled musicians 
to record, produce, and distribute their own music without selling their 
souls to the record companies.  
An enjoyable example is the album <i>The Badweather Blues Band</i>, the
first CD from the band of the same name.  
They're a six-piece outfit from the Binghamton, NY area, 
who play blues flavored with funk, rock, and jazz.
<i>((And they make really cool road music to hum along with!))</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
It always makes me happy to hear old favorite songs that I could 
sing in my sleep, and Badweather Blues has plenty of those to get 
people moving at their live shows; 
but I really respect people who write their own music and develop it until
it's good enough to stand up to the classics.  
These folks have accomplished that.  I mentioned them a couple of years 
ago in <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> issue 300, in my "best music of 2005" 
article, and cited "When You're Sober" as an original that deserved 
wider attention.  Since then, the band's own songs have become
a bigger part of their repertoire, and I'm proud of them for 
making this debut CD 100% originals.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
These six people have been playing together for a long time, and it shows.  
The performances are tight, no matter how much tougher it must be to 
keep six people coordinated on rich arrangements than three or four players.  
<i>((Or keep six people in a band when it's easier to split club money
fewer ways.))</i>
They obviously love each other like family, 
mess around with each other on stage, and communicate
with a glance and a smile.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
So who are they and what do they do to create this music and fun?  
Brian Golden plays electric guitar including some absolutely searing solos.  
If this album has a weakness, it's that Brian's best bits should be 
stronger in the mix.  He also wrote five of the songs on this CD.  
"So Long, So Far" and "Surrender (Far Too Long)" are hot hot songs 
to which I'll probably listen decades from now.  
Brian also does the lead vocals on a couple of his songs.  
The other guitarist is Bob Jenson, who's credited as "rhythm guitar" 
but plays some darn tasty leads on occasion.  
Bob also sings really ripping vocals on "Surrender" and 
(not on the disc) Tommy Castro's "Nasty Habits".  
Tom Westcott does a solid job on electric bass, backing vocals 
including doo-wop, and tomfoolery.  Steve Simmons plays a midsized drum kit 
and I don't think I've ever heard him make a mistake.  Other than
real piano on jump blues, I don't like much keyboard in my blues 
(nor in the rock, bluegrass, reggae, zydeco, or psychedelia that I listen to), 
but Mike Melnyk's contributions on organ work well in these arrangements.  
<i>((I ***DO*** like keyboards a lot, and that is a strength here.
It is true that keyboards can make the beat less the message, not be percussive
enough, but that is not a problem here.))</i>
Not just harmonies, fills, and fillets, but some good lead lines too.  
Mike also did a good job laying out the CD's cover and liner notes.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
People might argue whether five white guys can perform real blues.  
You'll have no doubt after you hear their sixth, Debbie Hospie, 
a black woman whose spirit has some Bessie Smith and Koko Taylor and 
Aretha Franklin inside.  She sings tender, moving balladry and 
balls-out fullthroatedness, sometimes within the same song, 
with fine vocal skills and great stage presence.  Debbie also wrote four of
the tunes on this recording, music rich and dynamic enough to show true songcraft.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I give this album my strongest recommendation, although I think the live shows 
are still better than hearing the disc.  You can get it from CDbaby or 
iTunes, and their own website is at www (dot) badweatherblues (dot) net.  
They're one of my favorite bands, and I hope they get a chance to go 
big-time professional.  If
not, at least we can enjoy this excellent homebrew CD.

Cathy and I were thrilled that Obama won in a landslide; it was quite moving seeing the President-elect and his family take the stage in Grant Park, with an acceptance 
speech of hope, and the Chicago skyline as a backdrop. It doesn't get better than that!  
Obama is actually the same age as Cathy and I; so it's great to see someone of our 
generation, and a progressive thinker such as himself, be elected.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
After nearly 8 years of neoconservatives, credit card republicans, and deregulators screwing everything up, Obama is a breath of fresh air.  
Hopefully working people will get some trickle-up economics for a change.  
Expectations are high, and Obama and his administration have a very deep hole to dig out of.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
<i>((Yes, Eric, thanks for setting me up for the little editorial that I wanted to write.
I think there are three really important possible changes we can have in the future, that
the Obama election may signal.  And then I'm going to finish up with a couple of 
technical points and wild assed future predictions.  Only one of these important changes
is related in any real way to "Republican" versus "Democrat" debates.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((The first change is that we need to start valuing what government decisions do
for people rather than just valuing the cost to the taxpayers.  Since we don't
do this well, we don't spend enough money on what really helps people, we do
too much that really hurts them, and we get stuck on valuable changes that help
a lot of diffuse people who don't have good lobbyists writing legislation for them.
Yes, people do spend their own money on things for themselves better than 
government can do in buying things for them, one of the arguments against taxes.
But it isn't just about cost to the taxpayers, that just perpetuates the inequities
in what government does (or does not do) for us that already exist.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((The second change is in actually valuing what government itself can do.  Let me be
clear, I am not Pollyannish, clearly many governmental employees and functions
are not operating for the best interest of the country, but many are.  And those
people are incredibly demoralized by the huge layers of useless bureaucracy that
the Bush administration layered on them (those are almost sure to go and will save
some significant money) and the blinders and opaque structure that was placed over that.
Transparency is surely overused as a word, but we have to have better transparency.
Both of these first two factors will affect the "consultant and contracting deluge"
that the Bush administration brought to Washington.  Why we think that the shirking
and moral hazard in contract employees problem is somehow lesser or easier to 
handle than with Civil Service government employees has never been explained to 
me in any coherent way.  And the flashlight needs to be shined on all of this.
If we really did, week by week, have contracts be competed out so that bad
contractors could just be dropped, that might (I would emphasize the might) 
work, but most government contracts are no bid or restricted bid contracts
that point work toward particular government contracts.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Third, and I this is the one I am most sure of, the new administration 
will do what government must do, view downturns, bad situations, and
pain and hurt as bad things to be sure.  
But more importantly, they are an opportunity to tear down what is badly decayed and
rebuild, re-energize, and innovate, what we Americans still do better than
most other countries, especially
the Chinese.  We need government stimulus that transforms, builds, invests,
and touches every community in the country, not just those where auto plants
happen to be (last I heard bankruptcy protection is supposed to precisely be
the government structure designed to help a company retrench and rebuild,
by offering it protection from creditors - the silliest explanation I've
heard about why the auto companies need a bailout is that "if we're in 
bankruptcy, all our effort will be focused on dealing with the bankruptcy
and no one will be able to work on innovating for the next generation of
cars".  Well, duh, so if your management is THAT moribund, that you can't
take one group and send it that way to deal with the bankruptcy, while 
protecting another group to innovate for the future, well then, I'm sorry, you
deserve to go under.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((I have three things also that I think specifically ARE the ways to bail
out the country and rebuild it for the future.
First, and most importantly, we need to boost payments and subsidies to
day care and pre-schooling in this country, for everyone, not just poor
people.
Public schooling was once unthinkable, and then it wasn't.  We are the
worst western country about supporting our young kids, that must change.
Second, we must provide all kids with health care, preventative care,
money for vaccinations and well child visits, ALL kids, now.
Stop messing around with expansions of the SCHIP program and just take
it all out of the insurance market. 
Then the insurance market might actually be able to work better.
Third, we must build the infrastructure of our highways, bridges,
and urban transportation systems.
Otherwise, we're going to have more deterioration and mini-disasters.))

<div class="p"><!----></div>
((Finally, what I find most ironic about the financial collapse is
that in large part the severity of the problems with the credit 
default swaps and other complex instruments is that Bayesian 
statistical whiz kids mostly were putting these things together
over the last decade, the latest Wall Street innovation.
And when the bankers and financiers at the top said things like
"I don't understand these things" they really meant it.  It was
the first step of possible "computers run amuck" that we are
moving into.  "Tipping Point" author Malcolm Gladwell's new
book is entitled "Outliers" and is about how strange
outlying events can be "good outcomes", well,
not having read the book ;-) "outliers" can be bad outcomes
too.  In fact, roll the dice enough times and snake eyes are
sure to come up some time.
What has just been happening has been like that.
Yes, 20 minutes into the future looks closer and closer
all the time.  And when we get there, we won't be voting by physical
community blocks, but the Diplomacy community will have our own
representative in Congress and we'll do all the campaigning and 
voting on the Internet....))</i>

Can we get back to these game openings below?  
We just need a few more people for a couple of these.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I am willing to open another new game of REGULAR Diplomacy if there is enough interest!!!
Doug Kent, Fred Wiedemeyer, Brad Wilson, and Shaun Thompson start the list, who would like to join them???

<div class="p"><!----></div>
I also am starting a game of the variant I designed, Spy Diplomacy.
Signups for that are now open.
Bruce Edwards and Eric Ozog are signed up.
I published the rules again last issue!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
And since Colonia is over, Harold Reynolds is looking to start something else.
Harold has been updating the Diplomacy A to Z, go check it out at:
http://www.badpets.net/Diplomacy/AtoZ/index.html 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Also, I am going to design some postal rules for Devil Take the Hindmost,
and we have an opening here:
Bruce Edwards, Mike Barno, and Eoghan Barry are signed up.
Postal rules from me will be forthcoming shortly, on my never ending to-do list.
I will get them in SOON!
I'm more likely to get these things started if I see some interest.....
I've GOT to do this now,
Eoghan is getting tired of waiting....

<div class="p"><!----></div>
Right now, the other thing going is the Modern
Diplomacy game with Wings.
Sean O'Donnell, Jeff O'Donnell, Steve Koehler, Art Schleinkofer,
Bob Holt, Rick Desper, Alexander Woo, and Dave Partridge are signed up for that.
I will start it when I get a full complement of players, we only need TWO more!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RED KINGS 8 (DARK PRESS - NOT FOR ATTRIBUTION)):

<div class="p"><!----></div>
 Number 8... wid a bullet

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Where are they?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Cheez Boss, I hate ta say... we dunno."  
He hunched his shoulders and flagged his hands sideways at the same time, 
the wide brim fedora in the right hand flopped a little with the gesture.  
He was slight and solidly built, but tall; even so he had to look up at 
a sharp angle to look into the eyes of his questioner.  
His compatriot was a heavy and oily looking figure in a pin-stripe suit 
with wide lapels and blood splatters, he shrugged also, 
but didn't contribute to the conversation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"You had them both.  You’ve been tracking them for four issues," 
the voice was deep, ominous, 
"You've been paying more attention to this game than the players have!  
How can you not know where they are?  Woooooooh..."  
The speaker drew heavily on his pipe, the heavy intake of 
breath seemed to move the air in the room, 
almost as if the walls of the darkened room bowed inward.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wells, we was right on 'em, Boss.  
Followed 'em back from da Copa. 
Had 'em in da walk up at da Abyssinian, dead ta rights... den dey's split."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"They... split," said the Boss distastefully, 
irritated he picked up a photograph off the table.  
"Three of you, against a buffoon and a blonde.  
Where is Dewey anyway?"  
asked the Boss, noticing the absence of the third gunsel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"He sorta got perforated..." said the thin gunmen.  
He squinted in an embarrassed manner.  
The heavy set hoodlum nodded in embarrassed agreement, 
flicking at a blood stain on his pin-stripe.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Woooooooh," the Boss drew heavily on the pipe again, 
candles flickered, "perforated... so where is he?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"He sorta demised, as it were," answered the thin gunsel.  
The heavy set one swept his pork pie hat off his head 
in a show of respect to the departed.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
You could see the fingers tighten on the pipe, 
the knuckles whiten in irritation. 
The other hand tossed the photograph back on the sidestand.  
He reached into his vest and plucked out an item; with his 
other hand he pulled a pen from his pocket.  
Picking up a tablet he scribbled onto the notepad... "hire gunsel." 

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"So," intoned the heavy voice, "we are no closer to knowing where the 
item is.  Wooooooh," he pulled on the pipe.  
He reached out with his other hand and picked up his steaming cup of coffee.  
With his other hand he flicked an errant ember from his pipe 
off the upholstery covering the stool.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Negatory, Boss," said the thin gangster looking up into 
his eyes, it made his neck hurt. "We gotta be closer.  
We knows da flatfoot is onto sumpin'.  
He’s hooked up wit da dame, which we was watchin' and now dey's 
headed somewhere togedda'."   The heavy-set companion nodded in agreement.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Boss tilted his head sideways and looked down at the gunman, scratched his chin, 
"Tagedda?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"The twos of 'em, wit each otter," explained the thin gangster.  
He moved his hands together and then hopped them sideways to illustrate his point.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
“Woooooooh,” the Boss pulled on his pipe in irritation.  “Luis, one day you will learn the Queen’s English.”  He waved a hand in front of his face and pinched his nose, it was a habit of his to reduce stress.  Hot, he took his other hand, picked up a paper fan and fanned himself.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He toyed with the item he was holding in his fingers, the item he had taken from his vest pocket.  Almost as if it was a nervous habit.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wooooooh," he pulled on the pipe and spoke in his deep voice, 
"Luis, there are only two things I want you to focus on.  
There are many parties involved in this, seven of them appear to be ahead of us.  
The detective is the key to our getting ahead of them."  
He held up the item in his hand, the one he had taken from his vest 
pocket - a very heavy .45 caliber slug, 
"I want you to find out what he knows and then take this bullet and... 
I'll put it into terms you can understand, `punctuate' him. 
You got that! Can you hold onto those two simple thoughts?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yep... number eight wid a bullet."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wooooooh," puffed the Boss, shaking his head in frustration, 
"so what do you propose we do now.  We have no idea where he is headed."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Simplistic itself Boss," said the thin gunsel, "we jus' gotta tink like he tinks."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Woooooh, I’m not sure I'm that stupid," said the Boss.  
He used one hand to scratch his nose.  
With his other hand he smoothed out the fabric of his vest.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Den, allows me to intertrude, as it were," continued 
the thin gunman without pause, or thought on the comment, 
"dis guy knows he’s onto sumpin' big."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The Boss nodded his massive head, egging the gunman on with his reasoning.
The gunman warmed to his subject.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"He goes to see da' Evil guy hisself, right?, and he finds out 
sumpin' because den he meets up wit da dame we been following for four issues, y'see."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Wooooooh," the Boss pulled on his pipe.  
He took a free hand and wiped his forehead.  
With his other hand he picked up his coffee and took a sip, "Do go on."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"She's gotta let on it's big... right," the thin gunman waited for a response.  
The heavy-set gunman raised his eyebrows encouragingly.   
Reluctantly the Boss nodded his massive head, he wriggled a little to 
reposition his body more comfortably on his stool, and looked back down at the gunsel.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Yeah, so den' we shows up to put the kibosh on 'em.  
Throw a little lead, y'know, to  convince 'em to cooperate.  
Get 'em to come along all nice."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Woooooh," puffed the Boss, "seemed to work so well."  
He stirred more sugar into his coffee with one hand, as 
he twirled a finger on his other hand to encourage the gangster to continue.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Exactemento!  That’s what I said to dear departed Dewey," 
nodded the gangster, pointing with his fedora to emphasize the point, 
"so now dis flatfoot knows its even bigger than he thought. Big AND important-like.  
And dey's go on da lam out da window."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Woooooh," puffed the Boss, "an able summary, but where does it bring us?"  
He brushed a fly away with one hand.  
With his other hand he loosened his necktie.  
He twiddled the bullet between his fingers in irritation.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"We's talkin' big, Boss," the thin gangster put his hands together 
in summation, "it's gotta be an oliphant."  
The heavy set gunman spread his hands apart palm up in silent agreement.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Woooooh," puffed the Boss.  "I’m speechless. Amazed at your superb reasoning.  
Practically Occam's razor."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Dat's what I'm talkin' about. Neat as a shave, like youse said.  
So's now we's jus gotta ask ourselves just one question..."

<div class="p"><!----></div>
He couldn't help himself, the Boss leaned forward in anticipation.  
The heavy set gunman followed suit.  "What, pray tell, would that be?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
"Does da Hobby have a m/'enage a twa'?"

<div class="p"><!----></div>
The caterpillar almost fell off his mushroom.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(TURKEY - GM): I thought I saw you strolling down the avenue.  But no, I guess it was just someone that looked a lot like I remember you do.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GM - TURKEY): I have not been in your neighborhood for quite a few years now, so no, it couldn't have been me.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FROG - POPE): Is it just me, or is Miley Cyrus a lot cuter without the blond wig?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(BERLIN- &gt; MOSCOW): No doubt you're totally bored with the stalemate on the Turkish front, but I ask you to hold fast for a couple more seasons as we will break through in the Balkans and Italy.  The tide will turn!

<br /><br /><i>Press:</i>

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(RUSSIA to FORMER ITALY): You left your KY Jelly at my place.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FLAP - FRED): If you think Jim-Bob is slow, try playing in <i>Northern Flame</i>. 
I was a senior in High School when one of my games started.  
We just hit 1909 and I am about to retire.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AUSTRIA to ENGLAND): I read with great interest the articles in 
your latest <i>Diplomacy World</i> dealing with the travesty at DipCon.  
Yes, it was a travesty... a travesty that this hobby would trash 
the charter simply because they did not like the way the tournament ended.  
So Mr. Burgess and his friends don’t like to lose?  
Then don't play the game.  
<i>((Hey, let's keep the record straight, I argued for not stripping
the Bangor DipCon of its title and voted the same way.
I happened to be outvoted.))</i>
In my day if you had a problem with someone you slashed their 
tires or got their daughter pregnant.  
Now it seems the preferred method of revenge is to hold private "open" 
conference calls, make up lies, and trash the reputation of someone 
who did everything in their power to make a successful convention.  
So the convention isn't good enough to play in, but it is good enough for 
Edi to try and ram through his amendments like a horny 
seventeen-year-old who discovers his prom date has passed out in the back seat?  
What a crock.  It's times like these that I wish I wasn't such a Rod Stewart fan.  
By the way, when is he going to change that hairstyle?

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(DOUG - GM): Nothing against Bob, but I think it sucks that you 
would put in a new player this late in the game.  
You should have split the centers and units between me and Mike.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GM - DOUG): Yeah, well, I thought it was better than a Civil Disorder
ending, I honestly had not contemplated your "solution".

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to TURKEY): What do you call a sleeping bull?  A bulldozer.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(AUSTRIA): Don’t blame me.  I voted for the Satanist child 
molester transsexual alcoholic with a hairlip.  

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(GERMANY to RUSSIA):  Arrrrrrh, welcome aboard, matey!  One like you
hasn't been seen since the days of Deviant Diplomacy in benzene!

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(NEW ITALY - ALL): It might be easier to play this game 
if somebody would write to me.  
Or was there a typo in the game listing?  Maybe it should have said Gunboat.

<div class="p"><!----></div>
(FRANCE to BOARD): What?  We elected a what as President?  
Wow.  I thought Afro-American just meant he had frizzy hair.

<br /><br /><i>Game Notes:</i>

1) The rules are on the <i>TAP</i> website in the <i>Tinamou</i> section.
Ask if you have any questions.
Up above in parentheses is the card you played to get to where you are
in the field.  The replenishment card is the last card in your list.
Be careful to note that the card you played (the one in parentheses) is
not available for you, for next turn.
Just for fun, I'm going to keep track of total replenishment, by turn, which is a 
rough measure of how the teams are doing.
Of course, it is lining up to get across the sprint and final lines in the
right places that really counts.
We can calculate an "efficiency score" later, which will be the ratio
of scoring points per replenishment.
If I'm predicting how the future of this will come out, a 10% score will
be really tremendous for this measure.
