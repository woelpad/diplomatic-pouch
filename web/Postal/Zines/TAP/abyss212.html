<p><br><p><br>``I will blow up the world unless you give me ONE......... MILLION dollars!''
Dr. Evil from <i>Austin Powers</i> (see Roland's press below in ``Show Me the
Money").
I hereby award the Cinema Trailer of the Year award to.... no, not the new
Star Wars movie (wimpy, for losers)..... no, not the new Star Trek movie 
with the insipid repetition of Data's ``Lock and Load!''.... YES, it is
the Trailer for the new Austin Powers movie. 
In fact, it might be the best Trailer I've seen all decade!
Don't miss it, go out and see a movie soon!!
I won't ruin it for you.....

<p>
<p><br><p><br>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
This issue is late for the usual Christmas season reasons.
Like most szine editors I know, I don't really have time to send all of you
Christmas cards, so consider this your Christmas bonus.
I have gone off on this topic before, so apologies for repetition,
but I think I can relate it to our dear President's troubles and 
put a fresh spin on it.

<p>
You know, I find it very interesting that most Americans, in what by all 
measures is an extremely religious country, are very coy about offering
holiday wishes around this time of year.  
This contrasts severely with the behavior of my Scandinavian and British
friends (both inside and outside the hobby - as some of you know, I also
co-edit a professional journal whose editorial office is in York and I
am also getting an issue of THAT out this week) who are quite free with
Merry Christmas wishes.
Instead, from most Americans you get that wishy-washy ``happy holidays''.
One could say that one was being careful not to offend Jewish or Islamic
friends (although Islam also ***could*** celebrate Christmas since 
Jesus is in their line of special people too), but I know far more Jewish
people who more or less celebrate Christmas anyway than I do those who do not
and the point of expressing Merry Christmas is to reflect how ***I*** feel
about the season anyway.

<p>
This schizophrenia seems deeply rooted in the American psyche and seems to
me to be related to the witch hunt mentality (that one goes all the way back to
Salem and 1692) that comes from these dichotomous positions.  Bill Clinton
continues to meet his spiritual advisor, carry his Bible to church, and yet 
he gets caught in this impeachment trap.
Avoiding all the semantic issues, one can simultaneously see how Americans
can overwhelmingly be opposed to adulterous behavior (well over 90% in
opinion polling, which is about as high as societal norms can get), 
supportive of the President as President (only about 70% but may reach
90% soon at the rate it's going), being believers in God (also at
high rates, but I forget what the actual percentages are), AND overwhelmingly
choose to offer wishy-washy generic ``happy holiday'' greetings at this
time of year.

<p>
What is going on?  I'm pretty sure that I really don't know, but I will offer
one interesting tidbit to ponder, especially to this mostly male group of
Diplomacy players.  
One thing that is driving the young college bred media to push these 
morality issues is the growing influence of general feminist thinking
in younger elements of society - this affects both Ms. Lewinsky's 
behavior and operating assumptions as well as how the coverage is slanted.
[Interestingly, polls of people in their 20's overwhelmingly show that
oral sex is not considered sexual relations, as it becomes more and more
common in the post-AIDS generation]
As more and more traditional ``old boy'' network fun and games at other
people's expense is not permitted by society, I believe that more males
of the species be searching out activities like this one that are
permitted (at least I think Diplomacy game deceptions are not impeachable
offenses - perhaps we should convene some Grand Juries to test this out?)
by the evolving new societal norms.
While I didn't think Clinton should have been impeached, don't think he should
be removed from office, and don't think he should resign, I hold to my 
original prediction that a logical outcome of all of this is that he WILL be 
forced to resign as the culmination of the establishment of these new
modes of behavior.
As a society, we need to find new balances that are not paternalistic
and I think it will be a very, very difficult search.  AND, it will be
made far MORE difficult if we continue to be schizophrenic in our thinking
and our words and fail to communicate explicitly and directly, NOT avoid
the conflict that comes from doing so, and end up with respect for our
differences without getting wishy-washy about it.

<p>
This is much too speedy an editorial to have any real bite to it, but
I hope you enjoyed thinking about it and we'll be back in the New Year
with more of this rag.
I thank all of you for sticking with me through this year.
I dedicate this last issue of the year to one of my fellow publishers who
seems to be in a spot of trouble lately - at least as far as continuing
to be an active part of the fraternity - Doug Kent.
I ESPECIALLY wish Doug a Merry Christmas and a Happier New Year and further
wish that all of his players give him the respect he is due in their 
patience as he tries to deal with the various upheavals he's had to face
this year.
I honestly don't know which of the ones he has talked about in his szine
(or others) have led us to miss hearing from him these last few months,
but I hope to hear from him soon.

<p>
Lastly, linking back to my thoughts on the Brits where this all started...
as most of you know, I get most of my non-print media news from the
BBC World Service which I usually listen to when driving in to work
in the mornings.
As opposed to the US media which appears to have even more biases, but
pretends they don't, the BBC has this absolutely wacky way of incorporating
personal biases into stories.
This one is from a couple of months ago, but I think it is relevant.
Robin Lustig (one of their anchors, male of course) was doing a story
on the researchers who have been studying how female rats (I think that's what
they were studying) that are pregnant have these massive changes go on
in their brains that dramatically increases their cognitive abilities.
So he calls in one of his female reporters, Ruth Linton, who recently 
returned from pregnancy leave and conducts this serious toned interview
that had me rolling on the floor of my car and nearly caused me to have
to pull over.
First he asked her something like: ``OK, Ruth, when you were pregnant did
your cognitive abilities increase?''

<p>
She responded something like, ``Heavens, no, my brain turned to absolute mush!
I can tell you for sure that there were lots of changes going on,
but I didn't feel any smarter, I felt a whole lot dumber!''

<p>
Robin: ``But you could have been expanding your brain to learn other new things?''

<p>
Ruth: ``Well, yes, I suppose so.  There was just so many new things I had to
adjust to, it certainly made me better able to roll with the punches.''

<p>
Robin: ``And what about after the birth, did your brain still feel like mush?''

<p>
Ruth: ``I had to get my act together and come back to work in THIS crazy place!
The BBC didn't cut me much slack and I had to get right back into the fray,
which is very different from taking care of babies.''

<p>
Robin: ``Right, well that's about all the time we have for that right now.
I guess we can say that something biochemical goes on in human brains during
pregnancy as well.
Thank you, Ruth.....''

<p>
This direct irreverence both makes the news more fun and more real.
I dare say that if American news announcers were a little bit better
at being more honest in their feelings and direct about their biases,
we'd be a whole lot better off.
On to the szine....

<p>
<b>THE DEADLINE FOR <i>TINAMOU</i> IS JANUARY 10TH</b>

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
I am going to defer rate increases for the moment, but
only until the current series of game starts is completed.
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.
These prices are due to increase in the near future so take
advantage of them now.

<p>
One advantage of being approximately a four ounce szine most of 
the time is that the new postal rates taking effect shortly 
actually result in a postage DECREASE for this weight from
$1.01 to $0.99. 
This is really good from a number of perspectives.
As some of you are aware, the current dollar stamp that the USPS
is selling is one of the worst stamps they have ever sold.
You pretty much need your OWN glue to keep them on an envelope.
With the new rate, the dollar stamp will become irrelevant to me.
Also, of course, it is slightly cheaper... not to be laughed at.
Finally, since they won't come out with a 99 cent stamp real soon,
the USPS desk workers will have more pity on me and run more szines
through the meter (they only are supposed to do it for groups of 
less than 10 letters, but when faced with messy stamp sales, they
break down easily).

I don't know if your list of Dipcom old farts includes any that go back to
the '70s, but if so, some of them may remember Scott Marley, one-time

If so, they may be interested to know that yesterday morning Scott
underwent an operation in which a large but benign tumor was removed from
his brain.  The operation was successful, and Scott seems fine, but we're
still waiting to see how his recovery proceeds.

<p>
<p>It also is time to ask for your ``best of 1998'' lists.
Give it to me anyway you want to - a top 10, a couple of favorites,
a list, an essay, whatever - the classic is to tell me your top
singles, top albums, and best concerts of the year, but you are the
boss.
Don't wait too long though because I want to move into the party tape
issues pretty quickly.
I plan to have my list in next time.

<p>
This section is developing a list of the great party singles of the century.
You'll get a definite sense of quirky before we're done.
You'll also get a sense of timelessness.
I'll assume that I'll also get some comments from some of you.
I'm going to set a slate of only 10 - that's just ONE more from
what is below and then DEMAND votes from you out there to
fill the rest of the slots.
The Bullpen voting system I am envisioning will work like this:
you each get ten votes which you can allocate across as few as
two songs (5 votes apiece) or as many as ten songs (1 vote for each).
You can allocate your ten votes any way you want, but you can't put
any more than five votes on any one song.
I'll start the voting at the beginning of 1999, THE LIST CLOSES NEXT ISSUE.
Write-ins will be permitted, but are unlikely to win.
I know I have lost some suggestions that aren't in the bullpen lists
below, so feel free to mention 'em again!

<p>
We'll end up with a monster party tape at the end of it that I plan
to segue and sequence and copy for distribution.
The result will be a great New Millenium party tape.
I've also been thinking that I should put this out on CD
as truly emblematic of the new millenium.  
I don't have the capability to do that quite yet, but I think
I might by then.
Any suggestions (or especially volunteers) on this front will
be cheerfully accepted and could receive monetary payments!

<p>
So far, we have ``I Melt With You'' by Modern English; George Gershwin's
``I got Plenty O' Nuttin' '' from <i>Porgy and Bess</i> in the 1957 concert
recording with Ella Fitzgerald finishing off the vocals after Louis
Armstrong blows and sings through the tune; Duke Ellington performing
Billy Strayhorn's ``Take the A Train''; Frank Sinatra's ``New York,
New York''; something from the B-52's;
the original Van Morrison and Them version of ``Gloria'';
The (English) Beat's 12 inch version of ``Save It for Later'' 
ratchets things up to the next level (wherever you put it!);
Buster Poindexter's ``Hot, Hot, Hot'' keeps you there;
``Atomic Dog'' by George Clinton blows the doors off,
and Koko Taylor cleans up singing Willie Dixon's ``Wang Dang Doodle''.

<p>
The ``bullpen'' is the list of suggestions that people make
that I haven't decided whether or not to include yet.
Comments on the bullpen are, of course, actively encouraged.
I also am ``working'' on some ideas Mark Luedi tossed out recently.
I liked Mark's ``criteria addition" that:
``One of my own criteria for truly great songs is that it can sound as
good or better distorted as not, whether on account of poor signal, bad
speakers, tape deterioration, car noise.''

<p>
First up are two letters that I have been sitting on for awhile.
I just haven't had the time to squeeze them in.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><b>Stan Johnson (sometime in October?)</b>

<p>
Jim,
When you say ``explain that one'' in regards to ``Tweediee Dee'';
I'm not quite sure what you mean.
<i>((It means that you have actually come up with a song, that might
be a great song, but I am totally unfamiliar with it.
Any ideas where I can find it on CD? - I just went to hunt,
it was released in the late '50's and is available on CD re-release
and the song actually is ``Tweedle Dee'' - hmmm, sounds intriguing.))</i>
I think it's a great party song, because it makes you want to get up and 
dance or at least boogie around the room.
It has a sort of Brazilian sound and in my opinion was way before its time.
It was released I believe in mid-60's and is not very well known.
Lavern Baker also did ``Jimmie Mack'' and a couple other hits.
<i>((Yes, I'm familiar with those, but not with this song.))</i>
She left States and ran a club in the Philippines in 70's and maybe
late 60's.
She died a few years back, when I heard of her death I called a local
``classic rock station'' and they had never heard of her.
With your seemingly extremely wide range of musical knowledge, I 
assumed you had.
<i>((No, you hit a hole.
That's why I wanted you to comment more.))</i>

<p>
Another great party song is ``Rock Island Line'' by Little Richard,
because of tremendous energy of song.
I defy anyone to sit still through it.
Also for Drug Bullpen I nominate ``Don't Bogart that Joint'' and 
``Hemp, for Victory''.
Not sure who wrote them, but I'm sure you know.
The first one was in <i>Easy Rider</i>, second was theme song of local
cable access show of same name that was in favor of legalization, but was
written in the 40's and used by the Government to encourage farmers to
grow hemp for the war effort.
<i>((You are doing really well at exposing holes in my knowledge.
I've never heard the story about the Hemp song.
I believe the <b>Easy Rider</b> song was by the Fraternity of Man,
but I'm not sure.
Anyone want to comment on that?
I actually didn't like that touchstone movie all that much, that's
from my wife's generation.))</i>

<p>
I have alwyas heard casualty figures for the Civil War were 330,000
Union and 310,000 Confederate, and almost every source I've seen says over
600,000 were killed.

<p>
I disagree with Jack McHugh about Grant's willingness to fight a war of
attrition.
While Grant was willing to pay the price he had to, his main tactic was 
maneuver.
His Vicksburg campaign is one good example and his attempts to get around
Lee's flank is another.
He only made one bad attack and that was at Cold Harbor; his mistake there
was relying on his Corps Commanders; The Union army had a very extended
line at the time and he expected the Corps and Division Commanders to
be more familiar with the situation they faced than he was.
He gave the order that the whole Confederate line was to be hit at one
time (to prevent Confed. from shifting troops to meet an attack) and
hoped to find the weak point and break through.
However, rather than carefully planning their own attacks most of those
Bozos took lack of specific orders to just go straight ahead without
any planning.
But, unlike Lee, Grant learned from the mistake and never did it again.
Grant never made attacks that were as stupid as Lee's at Gaines Mill
<i>((Yeah, that one is not always recognized, but yeah.))</i>
and Gettysburg or Hood's at Franklin (or several of the battles around
Atlanta).
Grant's attacks in '64 were necessarily to beat Confeds and the fact that he attacked but did not suffer significantly more losses than Confeds, show
how well conducted they were.

Dear Boob, Just when you thought it was safe to read your mail, I'm back.
<i>((And then I held it so long.... you must have REALLY wondered!))</i>
Sorry for the silence.
<i>((Sorry for the delay in printing this.))</i>
I find letter writing easiest when I'm having to do a lot of diplomacy.

<p>
So what's happened since I last popped my head above the parapet?
I'm sure something's happened?
Oh yeah, your president's been making himself look silly again.

<p>
Now forgive me, but I found it amusing whilst on holiday reading the
extracts in the paper.
I didn't find it amusing that while the world's financial markets
collapsed the US did nothing.
<i>((Hey, they're back OK now, why were you worried?))</i>
However whatever my politics (slightly left of centre on some issues,
slightly right on others) I can't see how Clinton can survive.
<i>((We don't have a parliamentary democracy, so he CAN survive,
but WILL he survive.
You are looking at it with that parliamentary thinking in your head.))</i>
To me I can't see how you can have a situation where Clinton can get
away with perjury when say, Jim Burgess would get sent down.
Am I being too simplistic?
<i>((Well, yes, I think so.
The impeachment charge is charging him with lying to a Grand Jury asking
him about affairs that some people believe they had no right to ask him
about.
Isn't it sort of entrapping behavior when you drag someone in and ask
them embarassing questions for no other reason than to embarass them?))</i>

<p>
It's sad because from the outside Clinton seems to have done a decent job.
He appears to have managed the economy a damn sight better than Reagan
and Bush.
I suppose though as much as I think he should go, I kind of hope he hangs on just
to piss the American right off.

<p>
I've never understood the relationship religion has with the rest of 
American society.
<i>((Ditto, see more of my musings on the subject above.
I have written about that a lot this year, haven't I?))</i>
I suppose its the thing about Northern Ireland the English have 
never understood.
Quite often you will hear some Irish American (sniffed Guinness once)
refer to English oppression, but we English are the least hung up
about the subject in the UK.
I suppose that's what having a state religion does for you.
<i>((That's part of it...))</i>

<p>
I think I may have already said this to both Brent McKee and Robert Lesco,
but there was an amusing letter in Private Eye after the US airstrikes
in Afghanistan.
Since the US felt it right to strike at countries harbouring supporters
of terrorists, the letter said, Bill would lend Tony a cruise missile
or two to bomb an Irish club in Chicago, Boston, or New York - well,
I thought it funny.

<p>
I was very disappointed by your comments on Mark McGuire.
As I understand he freely admits to taking substances that would
have him banned in Basketball, Ice Hockey, or that funny form of
Rugby you play.
<i>((Hey, you said it yourself, those are different sports.
I said it and I meant it.
Baseball is not strictly a muscle sport.
And moreover, it ISN'T banned in baseball.
That's the point.
That's like saying you can't touch the ball with your hands 
in YOUR football game so clearly it is wrong to pick up the ball 
and throw it in ours.
Different sports, different rules.
There is no absolute line as to what is a performance enhancing 
substance and what is not.
With fuzzy lines and fuzzy enforcement there will never be a clear
understanding of ``clean'' performance.))</i>
I suppose it's an example to set American youth, but not one I hold to.
And just to amaze you with my knowledge of US sport, Yankees winning
the World Series 4-0 was a turn up wasn't it?
<i>((Nah, not really, if I understand your slang.
It would almost have been a surprise if the Padres beat them one,
much as I hate the Yankees as a fan and dearly wished for it.))</i>

<p>
Voyager may indeed be the lamest Star Trek ever, but is that saying much?
I admit Deep Space Nine is improving, but the whole thing is as nothing
to Babylon 5, which must be the best SF on TV.
To be honest, I've never understood Star Trek's appeal (it is enjoyable
enough I'll give you).

<p>
Steve Emmert is of course correct.
You do us a tremendous cultural debt (Octopus' Garden) and no Teletubbies
doesn't let you off.
Jerry Springer, Montel, Oprah, Ricki Lake, need I go on?
<i>((Oh, possibly, I don't even watch ``good TV'' let alone that stuff,
so I suspect you've seen more of it than I have.
The only thing I've seen of Oprah in years was her movie <b>Beloved</b>.
So, what's your point??))</i>
Curiously, I heard an interview on the radio with a Norwegian who was
going to set up a crocodile farm.
He was asked if he had ever eaten crocodile himself?
``Yes,'' he replied, ``in America.''
``What did it taste like?''
``Well, it tasted the same as any other American food.''

<p>
It probably says something, but whereas the US hobby has been dominated
by the Hasbro thingy it's been ignored over here.
It's not even been reported.

<p>
I haven't been buying many CD's lately but those I have bought have 
been excellent.
I was playing the new Suzanne Vega recently, which was excellent.
I also picked up a CD by a folk/blues singer called Eva Cassidy
which was good.

<p>
Anyway, I hope this finds you well.

<p>
Got something for your music section.  
I rarely buy new music these days.  I have so much old music I don't even have
time for that.  I think once you start having kids your new music urge dies a
sudden death and new stuff sounds sub par.  I don't know how to explain it,
just that the stuff you listened to in the past always sounds way cooler and
better.

<p>
That is not the case with this new CD.
I bought Liz Phair <i>Whitechocolatespaceegg</i> and found it to be superior.  I
read about it in the paper and the writer was gushing over this girl saying
this album was on par with the Beatles albums and she was the best thing since
sliced bread.  Well, I had to see if the reviewer was insane to compare this
young lass to the hallowed Beatles.  
<i>((I like the cover, but I haven't bought it yet....))</i>

<p>
Turns out he was right.  

<p>
All 16 tracks are quite impressive and fun to listen too.  My personal
favorite is track #4 ``Polyester Bride"  She has an unusual voice and great
lyrics.

Jim BO RUSKI!

<p>
Please allow me to ramble about the last issue.  I have some time to kill
today! :)

<p>
You write ``All things considered, I check my mail A LOT, but spend very little
time on the Internet.  That's the way to do it in my eyes"

<p>
I agree wholeheartedly.  I check my mail with a zeal that sometimes suprises
me.  I go into withdrawal every few hours.  Fortunately for me my profession has
lots of down time.  If I had all the time left over that I spend on my email I
could have catalogged half the net by now. 

<p>
Also I have a solution for Keith Sherwood's problems about Lotteries.  He is
looking at the problem all wrong.  Pay the bill Keith!  Don't look at it as
throwing your money away on a nearly impossible ``hit" in the lottery.
Consider for a moment what would happen if you just politely give your dollar
to your co-worker right out of the gate!  You save yourself the frustration
and sarcasm of their inferior math skills.  You don't have to get upset and
they are gone in about 15 seconds.  Is that not worth the equivilant of a cup
of coffee?  I would gladly pay a buck to make some people go away.  Plus in
some alternative universe your ``insanely lucky self" actually does hit the
lottery and cashes in.  

<p>
It is a lot like Diplomacy if you ask me.  You give up a small concession to
acquire a sizable gain.  In this case you lose one hundred pennies and gain
peace.  Not to mention your co-workers may stop stealing your soda's out of
the fridge.

<p>
And my final comment is to send a big fat ``WHAT THE HELL?!?!?!" to my good
chum Warren Goesle who proffered ``Memories" from the Cats soundtrack for the
Millennium tape.  AWWWKK!  I would gladly pay a buck to have that not on the
tape.  However you redeemed yourself with ``Roll With the Changes" by REO
Speedwagon.  Their best tune by far.
<i>((I actually deep sixed both from the Bullpen.
You really think I can put an REO Speedwagon tune up against the great
songs there??
Really??
If you guys insist, I will, but not willingly....))</i>

<p>
I don't know your opinion of Green Day but I think ``Paradise" is a nifty
thrashy tune.  
<i>((I generally can't stand Green Day, but I agree with you, ``Paradise''
IS a nifty tune.))</i>

that I can't play in any games now as real life stuff is taking up all my

<p>
I would have taken your bit concerning great party singles seriously but I
didn't see any Violent Femmes or Velvet Underground on the list <font face=symbol> &lt; </font
>grin<font face=symbol> &gt; </font
>! A
party without..``day after day, I get angry and I say..." or Lou Reed
belting out ``Sweet Jane" is not really a party but perhaps only a tea and
crumpet type get-together. 
<i>((Ummm, they are there... any more suggestions?))</i>

<p>
Three additions for Richard's Weiss drug bullpen. ``Heroin", by Lou Reed and
the Velvet Underground. ``Easy Skanking", by Bob Marley, and Tina's little
ditty about chemically enhanced bits of paper off the album, ``Tommy". 

<p>
Read with interest about Hasbro's acquisition of AH. I think it might turn
out to be a good thing. From my dealings with AH, I have come to the
conclusion that they were a bunch of incompetent wanks who couldn't pour
piss from a shoe. I don't think that Hasbro will shake things up too much.

<p>
I have always wondered why didn't AH aggressively expand into other
markets. Example: A company cannot just dump a product into the Asian
market. One needs to have the rules translated into the native language and
hire some guy to go around and promote/teach the stuff. Make an educational
version of Diplomacy. Make it an ESL tool. On another note...want to become
rich? Get the distribution rights to D&amp;D in Asia. Oh baby, with a little
bit of fire in your belly and a hot translator, that's money in the bank.

What on earth is Keith Sherwood going on about. In the scenario he gives, of
course it is advisable to switch, as you will then stand 2/3 chance of
winning a prize as opposed to 1/3 if you stick. For an explanation think
about it logically. The chance of winning when you stick is one in three.
Revealing one curtain tells you nothing, since you already know that there
is at least one donkey behind there. Switching will win whenever sticking
doesn't - i.e. Two thirds of the time.
Oh and re lotteries etc, try looking into utility theory a bit more to
understand it. Not that I do the lottery either...

Great party singles of the century. Of the ones you suggest, Love Shack

<p>
Some thoughts, which you may or may not wish to publish:

<p>
Hmm...Henry Hyde is saying that if Clinton steps down, he'll be
spared the embarrasment of an impeachment.  According to Reuters,
resignation ``could really be heroic".  

<p>
Yeah, just like the Republicans thought Nixon was a hero.

<p>
The sad truth is that there isn't a judicial court in the country
which wouldn't throw out the charges in this case for lack of
evidence.  We have a charge that Clinton arranged for the job to pay
for a cover-up.  The only major character who thought of that was
Linda Tripp, who encouraged Lewinsky to do so while she was secretly
creating a tape for Ken Starr.  

<p>
In a real court, the tape would be illegal.  The fact that Tripp
suggested it would make it entrapment.  The fact that Lewinsky is an
admitted liar would be considered grounds to ignore her testimony
(even if she hadn't been testifying that there was no such deal.)

<p>
The charges made against Clinton sound very important when made in
grand terms, but when you try to pin down exactly what they mean,
it's rather confusing.  OK, you say Clinton lied, when, and where?
How were these lies perjury?  Most of the statements are ambiguous
or of the ``I don't recall" type.  Hell, the entire Reagan cabinet
``didn't recall" sending weapons to Iran!  

<p>
Examples:

<p>
Q:  Were you ever alone with Monica Lewinsky in the Oval Office?

<p>
A: I don't recall such a occasion; or

<p>
Q: Were you ever alone with Monica Lewinsky in any room in the
White House?

<p>
A: I don't recall..(etc.)

<p>
Not direct quotes but close.  For practiced liars like Diplomacy
players, do we see the hole that Clinton jumped through?  The
affair took place in a hallway outside his office.  Not the Oval
Office itself.  And, if you think about it, a hallway is not
a room.  Or at least there's enough there to jump through.
<i>((Yeah, but this is ALL about politics, and not at all
about the law - though I do agree with you completely.))</i>

<p>
The CNN coverage of the whole story is sensationalistic,
short-sighted, and disingenuous.  After the election, the CNN
``experts" doubted that charges would make it past the Judiciary
committee.  Now just which Republicans did they think would vote
against impeachments?  The House Republicans have yet to show that
they care more about legal standards than trying to embarrass and
weaken the President.  Their desire to step up the pace of things
coincides neatly with their imminent loss of 5 seats in the House.
Constitutionally, the idea of a lame-duck Congress voting to impeach
looks pathetic.  It will look especially so if their margin to impeach
is less than 5 votes.  

<p>
It looks like the House will actually vote to impeach, which will lead
to a lot of wasted time for the Congress, the President, and even the
Chief Justice.  Nobody actually believes impeachment will get
Democratic votes in the Senate.  

<p>
The Republicans don't quite seem to have the hang of how to behave as
a legislative party.  They were the minority party for a very long
time.  As a minority party, they developed an attitude of behaving
like pit bulls.  It was the only way to avoid being railroaded.  But
as a majority party, their only accomplishment thus far is to do
nothing.  They will provide us with a interesting Constitutional
lesson.  I think some good will come of that.  But I wouldn't be
surprised to see them lose more seats in Congress next time.

<p>
With the 2000 census, we will see a new redistricting of Congress.
Hopefully this will mean that many of the ridiculously drawn districts
created in the 90s will go away.  For those of you not paying
attention, the Republicans and the Black Democrats joined forces to
make districts in many Southern states to guarantee that Blacks would
have greater membership in Congress.  However, they did so by creating
districts which were overwhelmingly Democrat.  Many other districts
were adjusted from a Democrat majority to a Republican majority at the
same time.  The whole process had a dubious Constitutional
foundation.  But, come to think of it, I think the process is largely
controlled by Governors, who are dominated by Republicans these days.

<p>
It's interesting some times who far the country is from a true
democracy.  Mind you, I don't really want a true democracy, since mob
rule is not a great thing.  But when 63% of the public wants no
impeachment, and it happens anyway, it is cause for worry. 

<p>
Well, if you don't want anything about this stuff in the 'zine, I
understand.  

<p>
If that's the case, I have to say the following:
were I not a Red Sox fan, I would have to laugh at how incompetent and
petty their front office is.  

<p>
As a Connecticut resident, I'm a bit dismayed at how much money my
state is looking to pay for the Pats.  I thought Rowland was for small
government and tax cuts?  I guess that's not true when it comes to
financing a project which will give him a real NFL team and luxury
boxes where he can show off and rake in political contributions.  
Well, Connecticut is the Fat Cat state, so it's really not surprising. 
I tell the Germans I'm from the richest state in the richest country
in the world.  I don't think it really impresses them.

Dear Jim -
Thanks for your note.  On the NBA, you may recall what I
wrote in this space last year:  I believe all the selfish,
juvenile, overpaid hyperthyroid cases in the league should be
taxed at 95%, and the money should be given to the only
athletes who deserve that kind of money - the hockey
goalies.
<i>((Amen, brother!
It is a sad, sad sight to see Brother Ricky's Travelling Salvation
Show resort to making TV commercials to keep busy while the
Celtics aren't playing.
Ricky P. is the only one who deserves all that money, not
the useless pampered athletes.
Meanwhile, of course, college basketball is still more fun
than not.
Our local teams, PC and URI have great stories and both should
soar in the rankings as the year goes on - URI to do real
damage and PC to be an NCAA bubble team.
PC has no height (a 6'6" center), great defense (two guards each 
getting almost five steals a game), and a great player (Jamel Thomas).
URI has one of the best freshmen in the country (Lamar Odom - who
really is a ``decent guy'' believe it or not) and almost no guards
and great inside rebounding and defense.
PC absolutely KILLED URI when the two teams played, one of the best
games I've seen in years, classic strength on weakness for both 
sides.
Remember that college basketball talk in these pages is always allowed.))</i>

<p>
I got to see a game in Detroit last fall between the Red
Wings and the Sharks.  Detroit's defensemen foolishly gave
up the puck inside the zone, and a San Jose forward
pounced on it and let go a slap shot at Osgood from about
20 feet away.  The sumbitch CAUGHT IT.

<p>
One look at Hasek making a save over his head while
sprawled flat on his back, or of Roy (jerk that he is) turning
away 35 shots in a night, should be enough to convince
anybody that these guys have the greatest reflexes on the
planet.  The second best, in my opinion, are baseball
players, who somehow can manage to distinguish a 98-mph
fastball from a 92-mph slider in the span of 60 feet, 6 inches,
and drive it into the gap for a double.

<p>
I read once that the average eyesight of a major leaguer is
20-15.  And that's the average; I'm guessing Tony Gwynn in
his prime must have been somewhere around 20-10.  Ted
Williams may have been better than that.

<p><br><p><br>
<center>Peace is Dead; Long Live the Peace! By
Mark A Fassio</center><br>

<p>
<p>I'm going to emerge from the ``Social Sciences closet" and make an admission:  
I am a Primordialist.   For those of you not versed in arcane theories and 
their proponents, Primordialism is basically a nationalistic, 
``ancient hatreds" view which says that there will always be war and hostility 
between ethnic groups.  In other words, there will always be an underlying 
mistrust and conflict potential among certain peoples despite any amount 
of economic integration into the world, peace initiatives, and the like.  
Most ``in the know" theorists decry this belief, confident that once we 
achieve ``global integration," ``economic well-being," and a host of 
similar initiatives, this virulent nationalism will dissipate.  
``Give the Serbs, Croats and Bosniacs some blue jeans and a dose of 
capitalism, and Balkan prosperity will be around the corner.  
Ditto most Third World neighbors.  Once everyone is just like us, 
peace will be at hand."   Humbug.

<p>
As much as I'd like to believe the development optimists of the world, 
the ``track record" of the past bodes ill for the future.  In Bosnia we 
first witnessed the ineffectual UN.  Then came the military arm of NATO and 
the Stabilization Force (SFOR) to monitor the Dayton Accords.  
Whoever in the class thinks the Accords will last more than one year after 
SFOR leaves, raise your hand.   Obviously we don't believe it, 
because our troops' mandate to remain there has tripled from the 
original ``one year," and no exit date seems remotely visible.  
The problem lies in conceptualization.   Peacemakers look at the world with 
a rose-colored realism.  They understand that there are bad people out there, 
but believe that prosperity (through an international political economy 
of neo-liberal trade) will bring peace and brotherhood.  Logically, however, 
the reverse must occur:  peace must occur first, and then prosperity can follow.
Postwar Europe is an obvious example.  If we could allude to Clemenceau's 
comments on the Versailles Treaty to describe the current state of the Balkans, it might be:  ``This isn't a peace; it's an armistice."   
What good is a prolonged stay by outsiders to enforce peace, 
when the insiders are waging war both actively (e.g., Kosovo) and 
``subcutaneously?"  By that I mean the aspersion of `the other guy' as the 
epitome of evil, passed on by deeds and word of mouth, by thousands of 
ethnic kinsmen, from days past to the present.   Words of hatred become 
deeds of ill-will  (generating mistrust so the planned joint Croat-Bosnian 
town councils don't work together, as just one example).  

<p>
Outsiders can talk a good peace story.  But village elders pass down tales of
atrocities and indignities heaped upon them by ``the other."  And when people 
weave tales of old into the sad and bloody tapestry of the new, then the 
mantle worn by the masses is one of unending violence.   Serbs in 1991 
alluded to Muslim and Croatian fascist atrocities in the 1940s as 
justification for enacting their type of war.  Croats pointed to 
Serbian attempts at hegemony since 1919 and the centuries before.  
And both of them still consider the Bosniacs as Slavic turncoats who 
`went over' to the Muslim Turk side…centuries ago!    Unbelievable?  
Did you know that in 1989 nearly a million Serbs celebrated their 
nation's defeat at the hands of the Turks - in a 1389 battle?!  
Could you imagine Southerners, 600 years from now, traipsing to 
Gettysburg and waxing euphoric about how they lost?   Do we have a plan 
to eradicate these stories - stories made much more personal after the 
last seven years of Balkan fighting?   If not, count on more war.

<p>
Want more instances of ancient hatred?   Africa is a nice case.  
Long before white slave traders came to the Continent, tribes were 
attacking, enslaving, and/or killing each other.  South Africa's 
apartheid regime is gone, but does that means the Zulu and the Khosa 
tribes have become blood brothers, joined by common desires?  Hardly.  
Traverse the continent of Africa and you'll find the same inter-tribal 
animosities from many, many years ago:  Hutu versus Tutsi  in Rwanda and 
Burundi; the multi-ethnic lines of fighting among Somalian and Liberian 
factions; Sudanese Muslims fighting Sudanese Christians and animists; 
the list goes on.    (For that matter, go to Texas and ask why white 
men tortured and dragged a black man from the back of a truck.)

<p>
Middle East-watchers can point out similar primordial tendencies.  
The Arabs claim land based on occupancy through millenia by their ancestors.  
Jews claim the land from Biblical heritage.  Koran or Old Testament; who's 
right?  The answer, to paraphrase Napoleon, is that "God fights on the 
side of the big(ger) battalions."   Hardly a way to create lasting peace.

<p>
Why won't global integration bring peace to the world?  Because capitalism 
and liberal development is inherently unequal to begin with.  One cannot 
(Marxist diehards aside) achieve a common utopia along economic lines.  
Business and economic dealings are cut-throat:  some survive, some go bankrupt.  
Some nations have great export surpluses; other nations are economic 
basket-cases, because, obviously, not every nation can generate a surplus-there 
will always be ``have and have not" nations.  And when you mix this economic 
inequality into a primordial grudge match between peoples (however illogical 
it might seem to our Western minds), the stage is set for continued unrest 
and propagation of an ``us versus them" outlook.  Don't believe me?  
Ask the Irish how long the Brits have subjugated them economically and 
politically ``beyond the Pale."  Ask the Abkhazian Minister of Internal 
Affairs (as I did) when the Georgian refugees could return to their ancient 
lands.  His answer?  ``Never."  Why not?  ``Because they've always 
oppressed us."  Uh-huh.

<p>
Let's come closer to home; what was one reason for NATO?  To assuage the 
French that their ``historical" enemy, Germany, wouldn't again rise to 
preeminence and cause aggression - oh yes, and to keep the Turks and 
Greeks from more fighting.  (Greeks tend to take a dim view of the hundreds 
of years they endured the Turks as occupiers.)  One could make the case that 
it took decades of US hegemony and overlordship in European affairs to 
``force the peace" - and we still cringe over Aegean problems between 
Greece and Turkey.  Can we duplicate 50 years of effort involving a handful 
of NATO countries with ``our" basic customs and outlooks and apply it 
worldwide?  Should we?   

<p>
The prognosis, when faced with this primordial logic, is for continued 
unrest until everyone learns not to demonize those who are ``not like them." 
Until that time occurs (if it ever does) a wise policy might mean not 
commiting forces and money on losing ventures.   But of course a circular 
logic exists. ``Band-aid diplomacy" using idealistic views - and the lives 
of our service members - for non-vital ventures involving Realpolitik 
Third World leaders - is bad policy.   Instead, we should try to isolate 
and neutralize every demagogue who promotes war (that would be you, 
Mr Milosevic, and you Mr bin Laden, for starters).  Unless we stop 
these and other primordialists from leading their peoples into a 
``we-they" fight over real and perceived injustices, peace will never 
come about.   The conundrum is:  how do you isolate/eliminate these 
demagogues without intervention and/or recourse to force?   In essence, 
we are faced with the old Vietnam phrase, ``We had to bomb the village 
to save it."  Peace will never flourish while people perceive non-similar 
neighbors as objects rather than fellow humans.  And the sub-national wars 
of the late 20th Century merely propagate this type of ethnic nationalist 
outlook.   There is no easy answer, but a sober view of our commitment 
levels worldwide might be a nice start.  Are we a GloboCop?

<p>
One should realize that we might spend a generation (or longer) trying 
to ``reprogram" people worldwide who have been scarred by ethnic 
fighting and who ``don't really like" their neighbors, however illogical 
it may be.  Trying to alter generations of cultural hostility is the 
successful equivalent of jogging through quicksand.   Unless we wish to 
expend decades of national treasure, time, and potential lives in a 
windmill-tilting journey, the best alternative might be a phrase from 
the old movie The Amityville Horror:  ``Get out."  History will not 
forgive us for future Vietnam-type involvements so soon after the first.

<p>
I have an opening for a game of Star Trek Diplomacy!
See Stephen Agar's rules on his web page at:

<p>
http://www.spoff.demon.co.uk/variants/startrek.htm

<p>
There are two changes I am looking at when I start the game.
First, I really want to name all the star systems after Star Trek locations.
I have begun to do this already, but if someone wants to contribute
significantly, or
even volunteer to do it all, I will offer a free game start in the game.
Second, after naming all of the systems, I think I want to nix the
``revolving rings'' rule.
I'll take input on this idea.
The game start is open now, and since I want to STRONGLY encourage press,
you can sign up and ``claim'' a race.
Species 8472 has been in two segments of Voyager and is a very intriguing
diplomatic race (their episodes are the only Voyager episodes I've liked
in the last year) and the rest of the races should be well known to all.

<p>
Conrad von Metzke is the editor and publisher of 
<i>Pontevedria</i>, the game openings listing, if you're 
interested in other game openings.
Send Conrad a SASE for the latest issue to:
Conrad von Metzke, 4374 Donald Avenue, San Diego, CA  92117.
Conrad is discussing folding this service.
I think actually it needs someone to pick it up with a web page
where it can be posted.
I'd like to nudge Stephen Agar into talking to Conrad about taking
it over and putting in the postal section on <i>The Diplomatic Pouch</i>
page, where this szine also resides.
This appears to be happening, though it is not official yet to my knowledge.
This could serve both the Brit and US hobbies!!
I realize that I should probably volunteer to do this since I'm the most
active contributor to that page, but I'd really rather not.
What we need is for the postal openings to be accessible on the Net.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(MIKE to LUKE):  ``Hoodwinked" derives from the practice of putting a
hood over someone's head to blind (or ``wink") them.  This could be to
prevent a captive from seeing where he was taken to; or to save the
public from seeing the face of a criminal being hanged; or for secret
groups to use both the preceding elements for mood during
initiations.  (Paul's use of ``the man in the black hood" in ``Fear and
Whiskey" last time suggests a different hood in John Schultz's case. 
Hopefully he doesn't mean the executioner's hood.)  ``Hoodwinked" has
taken on the general connotation (probably in Shakespeare) of ``fooled
with ill intent" or more specifically ``led into something the victim
wouldn't have chosen".  (Example:  ``You hoodwinked me, telling me you'd
support me into Russian centers; now I'm deadlocked against him while
you're taking my dots.")

<p>
(ANKARA to VIENNA):  The unsanctioned newspaper ``Fear and Whiskey"
carried documentation of war crimes carried out by Your Majesty's troops
which had invaded and temporarily occupied Bulgaria.  Can this be true? 
Has a genocidal madman gotten loose and need to be stopped?  We will
investigate thoroughly throughout Bulgaria as soon as a detachment of
the most qualified experts can be mobilized.

<p>
(AUSTRIA to GM): Do you have the rest of Jim Sayers' address in Australia
or is that all?
<i>((That is the whole thing!  I'm not sure how long Air Mail takes
to get there, but you will need to be very speedy to keep up with him
without E-Mail.))</i>

<p>
(ANKARA to VIENNA):  From the Palace of Wisdom and Glory, the most
renowned scholars in international relations were dispatched, supported
by the finest linguists, to the capitals of Europe's great powers. 
Earlier today, a messenger brought the first written foreign document. 
It was in the hand of Your Majesty and bore your royal seal.  How
shocked was I, the one Sultan of all the Ottoman lands, to find a mere
fluffery of words, devoid of content.  Are you trying to hoodwink me,
Buster?  And within the empty words was a claim to represent ``the
Austrian Empire".  Surely the noble ancestors of This Shining One's
imperial house from Buda and Pesht would take grave offense.  If ethnic
cleansing of Magyars from the Austro-HUNGARIAN Empire is being
attempted, whether by Austrians or the infamous Serbs, We shall have no
truck with it!  Turkish armies will go anywhere to stop crimes against
humanity, and no borders will stop them!  Vienna shall be consumed in
flames!!

<p>
(MIKE to JIM-BOB):  Whither Randy Ellis?  (At first I mistyped ``Wither
Randy Ellis" but whether that's true or not, it's no help.)

<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(PUNSTER to PROVIDENCE):  Okay, let's try this one.  

<p>
Once upon a time, there was a brilliant gorilla who got his
MBA from Wharton, then went out into the world of business,
made a bijillion bucks, and then retired at an early age (even
for a gorilla).  He decided to spend his retirement fulfilling his
life's ambition, which was to become a cattle rancher.  

<p>
He started by going out to Wyoming, where he located the
perfect spread.  Thousands upon thousands of acres of
beautiful, rolling countryside; streams; good grass; a fine
ranch house; everything a successful rancher could want.  It
was very expensive, but he bought it on the spot.

<p>
The next thing was to purchase the cattle.  But unfortunately,
the cattle market was very bad that year, and he had spent
so much on the place that he couldn't afford to buy all the
cattle he wanted.  So he did the next best thing:  He bought
ten thousand head of monkeys, brought them back to the
farm, and started raising monkeys. 

<p>
He did fairly well for a while, but pretty soon the monkey
business fell off, and he had to try to sell everything in order
to avoid financial collapse.  But he coldn't do it; every time he
went into town and asked passersby, ``Would you like to buy
a monkey ranch?" they'd just reply, ``No thanks.  I'll just use
a pair of pliers."

<p>
Be careful what you ask for, etc.
<i>((More puns, more puns....))</i>

<p>
(AUSTRIA to WORLD): Nope, nobody here but us chickens.

<p>
(SHRINKING VIOLET EMMERT to BRAVE NEW BURGESS): Thank you
for your kind words.  Indeed I do not wish to be the hobby's
resident ego.  For one thing, I can't afford the maintenance
on one of those things.  I'd rather spend the time spoiling my
daughter rotten.

<p>
(EMMERT to OZOG):  Welcome.  I trust you'll be more
communicative than was your predecessor.  I also assume
you can outrun a tree.

<p>
(MIKE BARNO to RUSS RUSNAK):  You'll be delighted (dare I say
apoplectic) to hear that Mary Jane is doing fine.  I've walked her 365
miles this year (none in Chicago, yay) and she hasn't bitten any Titan
players.  Don't know if she's made any players pee in their shorts from
their lame phobias this year.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Keep checking me here.
We have some very important notes here, so listen up.
I am still using Keith Thomasson's postal rules for 
this game, so I think I ***DID*** adjudicate the crowded space
correctly last time, but the game's designer apparently intended
both the space in front of the crowded space AND the space behind
it to be considered empty on the first turn.
The other rule that Keith uses, but is not original to the rules
is that NO card may be larger than a 15, so once all the riders
are in formation, the ones at the back just get 15's and nothing
higher.
Again, since we are using Keith's rules, that is how I have adjudicated
it above.
Hmmmm, wouldn't think a simple card game would be so difficult, would you??

<p>
2) Since I like this game and am learning how to do this and have to
put my new knowledge to good use, I will start another game.
I'll keep the sign-up list here so that interested parties will see it
as they peruse the szine.
All games will start when they have precisely six players and for the moment
I will keep the game opening list always on.
This game will continue to be free, like Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(FARMER MCGREGOR-TFWS):  Oddly enough, with similar cards, you are leading
the pack while the other John is right at the back.

<p>
(CHEF - GOZ):  Sorry my kids blocked you, but you didn't do too badly,
did you?

<p>
(BRIT PACK):
Groupthink is a wonderful thing.  As the massed crowd responded to Brian
of Nazareth with one voice, ``Yes, we are all individuals."  I feel like
the lone voice who quietly said, ``I'm not."

<p>
(BRIT PACK):
Who's winning?  Dunno, but after turn 1 just under half the cyclists
replenished with a card higher than the one they played, with John
Logie-Baird gaining the most (played a 1, got back a 6).  Strange then
to see the poor blighter struggling at the rear.
                                                 
<p>
(CHEF - STOOGES):  N&#228;chsten mal, sollen wir vielleicht die Spielregeln
durchlesen, bevor wir solche bl&#246;de Planen machen?  Mein Gott!
<i>((I may not be able to read it, but Chef gets bonus points for writing
his German in perfect TeX.

<p>
(GOZ TRANSPORTATION CO. QUARTERLY REPORT TO THE PARENT CO., GOZ &amp; CO., INC.):
Profits up $3M Q1.  Expect a dropoff in Q2, as British competition drives
past us in several areas.

<p>
(CHEF - BUNNIES): Looks like you kids did ok, yup.  Watch out for the
genetic engineer who lives on the hill!

<p>
(EMBARRASSED GAME DESIGNER WRITES):  This is ... er ... refreshing.
Normally everyone starts off real slow going ``After you Claude", in the
hope of building up monster replacement cards.  You guys are making me
look bad with your complete inability to play this game.  If I ever
catch up to some of you blokes I'll tell you where you are going wrong
but otherwise you'll have to hang around after the race for about 25
minutes to allow my team of stragglers to pedal home and give you some
tips on how to approach this road racing lark.   
    
<p>
(STOOGES to CREATOR):  In the face to face version of this game, does each
player get to see the other player's cards?  I know that one would know
all of the replenishing cards, but it seems to me that not knowing the
original ones would make the opening turn much more interesting.

<p>
(CHEF - JAILBIRD): Looks like you're taking the game's name literally!

<p>
(STOOGES to GM):  Don't worry about the oil, the Brit Pack will be wiping
it up with their super-absorbent jerseys in just a few seconds!

<p>
(CHEF - BRIT): I bet you passed my kids this time!  

<p>
(FIELD-MEG):  See you at the finish line!

Bad editing and GMing on your part, in my opinion.

I accept that.
Basically I had a VERY short window to get the szine out, or it
was going to be another week.
I could have held the press, but decided that it balanced out the

All this is explanation and not intended as an excuse.
After I did it and had time to think about it, I realized that I
should have just held the press to the next issue as I had 
intended originally.))</i>
And another thing, you forgot to tell the alleged Latin Black Presser
that he had to abuse the GM before abusing me.
Of course, since I was writing the press, I suppose you could call it
self-abuse.
I assume you approve of self-abuse?
<i>((Of course, of course, especially when I do it to myself....))</i>

(HERMIT BARNO to ZEALOT POLLARD):  As Jehovah said to Joshua, ``Cut the

think.  

<p>

<p>
(MIKE to KENT):  A good thing about Sean:  You aren't the farthest from
sanity and coherence in this game.

(HARMONIOUS HAIKU #1): A matador's sword; can be used by a Frenchman;

<p>
(MUNICH to PARIS):  Aw, what the hell?  Let's give it a good, rip-roaring 
go, just for kicks eh?

<p>
(FRANCE-EGYPT): I can think of THREE good reasons why Glenn was put

NASA needs money from Congress to keep the shuttle going.
NASA needs to keep the shuttle going to build and supply the space station.
The space station is needed to give the shuttle something to do.

<p>
(BOOB to BERLIN): Now, we need to look at this carefully....
do you want him to go back into space?
To stay away from the money??
Or just back to a good old fashioned water splashdown???

<p>
(GERMANY to FRANCE): From this we learn that we do not give one who
seduces people to do evil the opportunity to justify his actions.

<p>
(ITALY-WORLD): I'm flexing my muscles baby!

<p>
(FRANCE-IRAN): Whoever wrote that press item datelined Iran is
obviously not aware that, Iran being a Muslim country like Turkey,
ALL males of the Islamic faith are circumcised somewhere around the
ages of 8 to 10.
Or perhaps the writer is confused about the difference between 
circumcision and castration?
Go read up on them, and remember that neither medical operation
should be confused with a vasectomy operation.
(I had a vasectomy in 1973, and still regard it as the best $100
I ever spent.)
 
<p>

<p>

(MACHIAVELLI to THOSE WHO DID NOT HAVE THE BOOK): The quote continues...
``Yet experience shows that those princes who had little regard for their
word and had the craftiness to turn men's minds have accomplished great
things, and in the end have overcome those who governed their actions by
their pledges." ( The Prince ch. 13 par. 1)  I have yet to lie to anyone
and thus the predicament. Does being less than forthcoming count as a
lie?

<p>
(PALACE OF VERSAILLES): ``And how do you like being my prisoner, Mr.
Jonas Johnson?
Yes, you are now in my power.
Your deputy, John Schultz, has managed to keep the news of your
kidnapping a secret.
Perhaps he is not all that interested in having you rescued and returned
to power?
No matter, I know the whole plot, and so do the Greeks, now.
Very clever.
Incite the Turks to castrate the Greeks.
Blame France.
While all this is going on, everyone forgets about the Elgin 
Marbles and the efforts to return them to Greece.
Too bad the Greeks figured it out.
I will admit that France trained those castrated Greeks, but
they did the actual commando raid that captured you and delivered
you here.
Death is too good for you, considering your crimes.
We have had a new torture device built.
You will be taken to see it, and have three weeks to contemplate your fate.
Then we use it.
We will show no mercy.''

<p>
(BERLIN to WARSAW): Whoever wrote that ``die, die, die" crap in the 
press...?  It wasn't I!  I'm known for more subtle messages, such as
``Make Room...Your Daddy's Comin'".  You can draw your own conclusions.

<p>

<p>
(ME to TO SENDER OF STRONG PACKAGE): I will try to be all I can be.

(ME to YOU OR U): About as far as I can throw you.

<p>
(SUPERHERO to WORLD): My Spidey sense is tingling Mr. GM knows I have an
eerie feel for these things.
Ignorance is bliss, but it often leads to premature death, 
and frankly ignorance is just no fun. If I made a wrong
call, Mea Culpa, but we do what we must.

<p>
(EGYPT to ANYONE): What does <i>TAP</i> stand for?

<p>
(ROLAND to ALL): Best wishes for the holiday season.
<i>((Thanks, Roland, but I would have said Merry Christmas!))</i>

<p>
(HAMBURG to ANKARA):  You have a lot of nerve, demanding that
we drop everything else and swarm on down into the Ukraine.  You
haven't even offered us a support into a dot!

<p>
(BARNO to PARTRIDGE):  Can the first reports be true?  Did Pollard's own
elite troops commit crimes aginst humanity during their occupation of
Bulgaria?  Our people on the new continent need to know.

<p>
(HUN to BRIT): I received your request for support on the 10th-no time
to write back to you, but I gave you what you asked for.  Hope you
took it!

<p>
(JEFF O'DONNELL to HARRY ANDRUSCHAK): It is understandable that you
fear for your life as a tourist in Turkey.
However, I would like to point out that even the most militant group
in the Turkish underground or even the most radical members of
the local Shiite Moslem sect or even the most daring tourist
T-Shirt peddlers would have to find their terrorist plans foiled,
forcing them into a strategic military style retreat once they
come upon the knowledge that you are member of the United States
Postal Service.
I would also point out that as a card carrying liberal Democrat
it would probably be in their best interest to keep you alive, 
healthy and voting.

<p>
(THE CROSSROADS OF CIVILIZATIONS.... FIRST INSTALLMENT):
I've noticed that when I talk to people about my vacations, 4 basic
questions always crop up.  
For my trip to Turkey, they went along the lines of....

<p>
1) Why travel at all?

<p>
2) Why travel with a tour group?

<p>
3) Why Turkey?

<p>
4) Why November?

<p>
The last question is best answered first.
It has to do with the fact that I work for the United States Postal 
Service.
We have a clumsy system for alloting vacation times.
The Post Office divides the year into 2 and 3 week periods, and you bid
for a 2 week period and a 3 week period.
Who gets what is determined by seniority, not merit.

<p>
For the year 1998, I obtained a 2 week period in February and a 3 week
period in November.
I do not have enough seniority to even think about a vacation period
from Memorial Day to Labor Day.
I used the 2 weeks in February to sail with Windjammer Barefoot Cruises
on the 3 masted barquentine MANDALAY to view the total solar eclipse
of 26 February.

<p>
As for November, I long ago learned the lesson about traveling in
the off-season.
Crowds are smaller in the winter months, prices are much cheaper, and
all you have to put up with is some less than perfect weather.

<p>
Tour groups have advantages and disadvantages.
With a group, a lot of the tedious planning is done for you.
Of course, you pay a price for this convenience.
You get to travel with some interesting companions, but the
schedule may not include places you want to see or things you
want to do.
My general attitude is that I need a tour group for my first 
visit to a country.
I can decide to return solo later on, once I know what will be
involved.

<p>
I chose GO-AHEAD vacations for my tour group, based on enthusiastic
comments from friends who had used this outfit.
I chose Turkey because the price was right in November, and because
I had been reading up on Turkey as a background to my activity
as a player of the game of DIPLOMACY.

<p>
Turkey has it all.
It was the Crossroads Of Civilizations as dozens of armies 
marched back and forth across this land bridge between Europe
and Asia.
Empires rose and fell.
This is a land where history is measured in millenia, not centuries.
And it is a land with a modern democratic republic, part of NATO,
and an active member of the European Community.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR ATATURK P&#214;-LLARD to MR. ANDRUSCHAK): I hope your visit to
my nation was satisfactory.
Forgive the lack of a greeting from my Greek militant forces but
they are busy anticipating the next move of the Italians.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) Rick has been having a tough time with postal mail!
I carefully addressed Issue #210 just as printed above, but it was
returned as undeliverable.
It seems that the Germans are highly efficient at many things, 
but postal delivery does not appear to be one of them.
The szine gets to the Brits I send it to in 2-4 days!
It has been having trouble getting to Germany at all!
Then, trying to avoid the problem with #210, I sent #211 to
Rick here in the States where he was for Thanksgiving, but 
missed him by a day!
At this juncture, he still has neither issue, so we need to
delay the game until January.
I'm very sorry about the delay.
Have any of the rest of you had mail returned??

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(HOLLAND): Sorry guys, but I have been sitting by my mailbox waiting for a map to
show up, and it hasn't yet appeared.  The clever plan developed by me
and Jim-Bob backfired and the issue arrived in Connecticut one day
after I left for NJ to fly back here.  Not a good month for clever
plans.  :(

<p>
(ROLAND to ALL): Happy holidays to all. And may all the backstabbers
especially Mr. York get a lump of coal. O the pain the pain.

<p>
(F to FORMERLY LOQUACIOUS BRITISH ALLY): At least you could have written
or replied to my email. Instead I must assume that all ambassadors are 
dead.

<p>
(F to LUKE SAN):  Luke, you must not succumb to the dark side.
Mr. Bigglesworth and I will not be happy.
<i>((No, indeed.... you better watch out!
Dr. Evil will learn how to ask for REAL money...))</i>

<p>
(F to ALL): As you can see, the reins of power in my country have
been passed on to Dr. Evil.  We demand one million dollars in
cash or you will all be SHAGGED. Ya Baby!

<center><b>France (survives) - Paul Rauterberg</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>In my very first game of postal Diplomacy (back in, ahem,
1974) I learned, at the hands of Edi Birsan, that smart French
and English players ignore English Channel to their dire peril....  So what
did I do here?  I paid it no heed, and wound up losing Brest in F'01.
     
<p>
Luckily, I did cover Bur to stave off the accompanying German
invasion.  This enabled me to hold off the continuing incursions of
E/G, who ignored events in the East at their own peril.  R/T consumed
Austria with a will, and soon were pecking away at the periphery of
Germany's empire.
     
<p>
At long last, my F/G tormentors realized that there was more to
the game than the simple containment of France.  As they turned
to deal with the growing eastern menace, I moved toward Italy with
an eye to my own aggrandizement.  My eventual stab at the Boot
was not my most graceful act, however, and Italy offering himself up
as a puppet to the Turkish navy.  I found myself playing defense.
Again.
     
<p>
Nothing leads to general inertia throughout the board than a Western
Triple Alliance, which is what we of necessity had formed here.  When
convinced of this awful reality, the Turkish Sultan agreed
to join me in a quick split of the Italian dots:  Simon didn't seem to care
much, one way or another, anyway....
      
<p>
Back when I was still being assailed by the E/G alliance, I had
pleaded, begged, almost grovelled for the formation of a F/R ``ends against
the middle" pact.  The Tsar spurned my entreaties, however, and bid to
consume the centerboard on his own.  When his advances
stalled in Nwg and at the gates of Munich, Russia lost momentum
and found himself at the mercy of his erstwhile Turkish ally.  Pummelled by
the competing forces of G/T, the empire of the Tsar
faded into insignificance.
     
<p>
The raison d'etre of the Western Triple, Russia's containment,
became a moot issue.  With the navy of Turkey contained in the area
of Italy, and with Germany expanding all too rapidly to the eastward,
England and I saw no reason not to make eliminate this menace while
still we could!  Germany dropped like a rock into the bottomless pit.
     
<p>
Could the game ``have play in it" past this point?  Possibly for
Turkey, who might have advanced fleets into Tus and then into Pie,
thus loosening my hold on GOL.  But what the heck?  I saw that coming mile
away....
     
<p>
Congrats to Mike and Keither for their well played game, and (what
the heck?) kudos to the Duck for weathering the storm to the bitter
end!  Tro and I are beginning to play these games like pecker-sizing 
contests.  Will we ever prove anything?

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) All draws and concessions are still rejected.
With winter orders please vote on a concession to Germany, and FG, FGT, GT, and
FGTA draw proposals.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> PHIL R.): Most people in the hobby that I've known, that have
also played in a game with Richard Weiss, don't want to ever meet him.
You are not the first to express this sadly, very common feeling.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> FRANCE): I enjoy reading coherent press.
Richard's press is way beyond incoherent.
I'd say that it is disoriented, irrational, disordered, muddled,
disjointed, deranged, illogical, inconceivable, preposterous, and
rudimentary.
He mainly seems to be writing to Jim.
It is wonderful how he is going crazy with the game now.

<p>
(GERMANY <font face=symbol> &gt;&gt; </font
><font face=symbol> &gt; </font
> JIM-BOB): You know what I meant.
Have you ever seen a Turkey and Austria alliance succeed with a T/A draw?
Either by the Turkish and Austrian players eliminating all the other
players, or by all the surviving players voting them a draw?
<i>((Sure, I've seen most everything you can easily imagine 
at one time or another.))</i>

<p>
(TUR-ALL): I am going to stop any abusive press.  The last issue crossed my
boundaries of reasonableness.  My kids could always choose to use whatever
words they wanted as long as they knew that others would probably have
reactions and possible consequences for some.  Those were the traditional
swear words.  It was always cute to see when a 2-year old saves the big
``Fuck" word for a moment they feel is appropriate at the dining table with
the grandparents.  Let's say it got them, and me, in lots of trouble
through about 7 years old and then no more.  Just when the other kids were
getting into use for emphasis, my kids were tired of it.  And for that and
other reasons, I've had no rebellion by my first two teenagers.  They
didn't even pretend that they were becoming nuns.
        
<p>
A detour here.  I am most proud of my sociological daughter (wife's by
another marriage, but I raised) for being the first to ever start a
``Western European Culture Club" in a California High School - and probably
in the US.  It caused quite a local stir and some statewide problems/news.
But, it was no different than many of the other ``culture clubs" which were
blatant ethnicist groupings.
        
<p>
Back to the swear words, my kids, and no more abusive press.  There were a
very few words which my kids knew would get reactions from me.  One was
``nigger" and one was ``fag."  Almost any label with negative prejudice (look
up the word in the dictionary, it does not necessarily mean negative) for a
class of people which denigrates the individual by lumping into a
perjorative obtains a response from me.  Why it is funny or clever or
abusive or whatever was your intention - I hope that you copied it out of a
book somewhere and thought you were being a plagiarist.
        
<p>
I've been in the hobby since before JimBob called it <i>TAP</i> - in fact my file
folder with <i>TAP</i>s is still labeled something else.  I'll give anyone (or
everyone) in this game a free year's sub to <i>TAP</i> if they can tell Jim by
next issue what at least one such title was.  
<i>((OK, let's see if that gets any response...))</i>
I've seen such perjorative
press before.  I've seen it in games where some people talked about niggers
and one of the players was a nigger (in the sense that the person using the
label meant it).  I've seen it about fags.  I've seen it about prisoners,
murderers and Father rapers, but not about anyone who's ever eaten at
Alice's Restaurant.  Let's just keep it amongst ourselves and not involve
classes of people.  OK?

<p>
I actually was going to write about no more abusive press - because that
part has become not fun for me.
I did want to ask my fellow players if they knew how many ``Draw lines,"
there are in the game of Dip?  Absolute, can't be broken, there are enough
SC's to support, enough units can defend, etc. draw lines.  Maybe it is
easily retrievable on-line now, I don't know.  Maybe tactics aren't as much
discussed, even in snail zines with lots of press and writings.  But, do
you know?  Do you care?  Do you know whether A-T had a draw line or even
does now?
        
<p>
Why would I ask - for the same reason I play.  The game is a complex mix
of 7 people plus GM.  The fun is in having a challenge amongst equals with
people who play for more or less the same reason (goal) that I do.  If we
have separate goals then the fun is a little bit less to a lot less.  I
have acknowledged since year 2 of my play in the Hobby that I do play for a
slightly different goal then most - I play for the original creator's goal.
The original creator's goal (quick, this could generate another offer of a
free year's sub, Jim, hold my keys, don't edit it so I do offer anything,
``Can you spell his name correctly.  Twice the reward if you know which
countries he thought were the strongest."  I can't.  Nor do I remember, but
we were all surprised because statistical reality didn't hold to his
imagination as the creator.) was a solo victory.  The only other condition
was also Jim-Bob's - a DIAS.

I think this has been the most fun game I've played in a long time.  Thank
you.  I still have a little left though, and hope that we each examine the
goals that we had along the way and what we thought we'd accept as a final
solution, and compare what will be the ending with what we imagined.  I
think there has been a lot of change during this game.  Interesting.  Why I
play the game.  Why it mirrors life.  Why no two games can possibly be
similar - even with similar moves.

(MINUTES FROM THE HOF COMMITTEE): Mike B: So it is unanimous.
We all vote that Richard Weiss will not be allowed to play any longer,
or even think about Diplomacy, because he is a total and complete moron
and an embarrassment to the hobby.
