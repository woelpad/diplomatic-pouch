<p><br><p><br>``Feel so trapped and lonely; Nowhere left to go; We know we've
been kidnapped; Now this place must Burn!''
From ``Kidnapped'' a Mekons song that may be found on <i>Honky Tonkin'</i>.
This begins a series of Mekons song quotes that henceforth will be
found in the new Modern game.

<p>
<p><br><p><br>I'm a bit late again as I get my equilibrium back after the big
anniversary issue.
Thanks for all of the kind comments.
The most common one was something along the lines of
``makes a good doorstop''.
Glad I could oblige.
I send my SPECIAL thanks to those who were moved to send me 
monetary gratuities.
I and my wife thank you.
The deadline is pushed back one more time, but now I will 
guarantee the schedule through World DipCon, by hook or crook.
I will make no promises for content and indeed am holding yet
more material even this time.

<p>
The postal sub price is a flat
$1.00 per issue in the US and Canada,
a bargain at twice the price.... but 
you can double that for other foreign subbers (or $2.00 per
issue sent airmail).
Players in current games and standbys will
continue to get the issues for free, and new game starts 
(except for Nuclear Yuppie Evil Empire Diplomacy, which is free) cost 
$15.00 ($10.00 for a life of the
game subscription and $5 for the NMR Insurance). 
Remember that music comments and reviews are scattered through the 
game press at times.

The message:

Please make careful note of that as well since you generally
can get yourself off the list a lot easier than I can, and
NOBODY likes to see unsubscribe messages sent to the entire list.
A big, big thank you for David Kovar for setting this all up!!
The Cal Tech ftp site is being mirrored on the diplom.org machine as well.
Issues of <i>The Abyssinian Prince</i> #131 to #186 are 
available via anonymous FTP from ftp.ugcs.caltech.edu in the

I will be putting all of these issues up in html format.
We'll get all that straightened out soon.

<center><b>THE SEARCH FOR DAN STAFFORD</center><br></b>

<p>
<p>I had no time to dig up some Dan Stafford writings, but I will in
the future.
Look, look, win money!

<p>
This is now going to be a regular continuing feature of the szine
and I will be introducing a new ``search for'' every five issues.
Moreover, you can win a $25 prize for finding some previous
target who went unfound in the original $50 period.
That means that if Kevin Tighe or Garret Schenck or Jerry Lucas
is ``found'' from now on it is worth $25.
Plus, Steve Emmert will throw in another ten spot for Garret Schenck if you
can get Garret to write to him.

<p>
Winners will receive credit for Dip hobby activities
that I will pay out as requested by the winner.
Bid on PDORA items, subscribe to szines here or abroad, run your
own contests, publish a szine, or whatever.
Spend it all right away or use me as a bank to cover hobby activities
for years.
What must you do to win?
Get me a letter to the editor for <i>TAP</i> from the person we're
searching for.
This is very important, just finding them doesn't do it.
They have to write me a letter.     
The final judge as to the winner of any contest will be the target 
himself and I reserve the right to investigate the winning entry.
When you find someone I'm looking for, you should ask him to send me a 
letter for print that includes a verification of who ``found'' him.

<p>
Hi Jim, I received <i>TAP</i> today.
Took thirteen days to track me down.
I now reside in hell.... its address is John T. Schultz, #19390,
Marion County Jail II, 730 East Washington Street, Indianapolis, 
IN  46202.
Don't ask me what the move means.
I don't know.
It's definitely not the move I expected.
Somewhere down the line, as I discover more information,
I'll write a piece on privatized prisons, from an inmate's
point of view, of course.
I've been ``sold'' to a private company.

<p>
Great issue!
T. Tallman looks like a fun kind of strange character.
<i>((He and I always have been funny kinds of soulmates....))</i>
Reminds me of somebody but I can't put my finger on who.

<p>

<p>
WOW!! 
is about the best reaction I can give for this momentous issue. 
I thoroughly enjoyed the excerpts from <i>NSWG</i>, very informative and
interesting.

<p>
The reprints of old <i>TAP</i> selections were fine choices,  
I must say. 
<i>((Why, thank you, that was a very time consuming, but very
enjoyable activity as you can imagine....))</i>
The desert island disc bits will be particularly helpful as 
I start to build on the CDs I currently have 
(yes, I have a new job and should have some disposable income soon - 
see note below). I've heard good things about Portishead 
(though that is in your recent commentary). I think that'll be
my first buy. 

<p>
Thanks again for sending it to me. 
Here's to another 200 issues imagining
sound of a body hitting the floor in a dead faint.

PS: Hi, Well, the computer went and did it. 
I lost the entire hard drive and it is irrecoverable. 
Unfortunately, it came just as I was cleaning up the old computer and 
just transferred everything to the new computer. 
Back-ups were going to be done in the next few 
days as I had just finished. Of course, of course....

<p>
What this means is, once I get the computer up and running, I'll need to
retype all of the <i>RW</i> and flyer turn reports before I 
can adjudicate them. This may take some time (especially 
if I don't have a hardcopy of the turn and have to obtain
one from someone else or reconstruct it from the order sheets). 
I apologize for this; but, at this point there is little 
I can do except the above.

<p>
Now to some good news. I have a job working for the State in Austin. 
I've accepted a position with the State Library as a Records Consultant
(with State Agencies and Local Governments). 
However, the Texas WorkForce Commission is going to offer 
a job working with computer and web development next week 
(also in Austin).
Everything's coming together - all at once.

<p>
However, I don't have a current address yet for Austin. 
At least for the month of April I'll be splitting time 
between San Antonio and Austin, staying on a friend's couch 
during the week and returning to San Antonio over the weekend. 
The PO Box in Universal City will still be valid at least 
until the end of April (and will forward thereafter). 
I hope to get a PO Box in Austin early in April.

<p>
Unfortunately, this may delay the rebuilding of the computer files as 
I will only be able to work on it over the weekends. 
However, during that time I will also need to be packing and 
answering a week's worth of mail/EMail. 
It may be a rough couple of months, but I WILL get everything 
out as soon as I reasonably can.

<p>
Again, my apologies for this delay. But, I hope it will be the end of 
the road for disruptions and delays when I get moved, settled and 
oriented into my new job (whichever it turns out to be).

<p>

<p>
Jim-Bob, Wow! 
I wondered what was in that envelope-a complete collection of old
<i>TAP</i>s?  
But it was just one issue.  I found the excerpts from <i>NSWG</i> very
interesting.  
For one thing, I felt transported back ten years to when I first 
joined the postal Diplomacy hobby (hey!  I think I'm now eligible to
stand by for your ZR Invitational game, since I signed up for my 
first (and only!) regular Dip game start in <i>Rebel </i> 
in March, 1988.  Since then I have entered Eric Ozog's ``Maricopa'' 
as a standby, but I don't mind doing another in your zine;  
I prefer not to do two in the same zine, but no problem
with different zines.)  I don't know what exactly about 
<i>NSWG</i> gives me that ``out-of-time'' feeling, but it's something.
<i>((Agreed.
I get the same feeling.
It gives me lots of hobby energy again.
You really wanna standby for that game?
You got it.))</i>

<p>
For all these years I assumed the term ``nosewege'' was derived from 
the analogy ``Nwg means Norwegian, so NSWG means Nosewegian.''  
Now I discover I was wrong.  It's some sort of Navy lingo.  
Who'da guessed?

<p>
I've started listening regularly to the Saturday morning ``Hillbilly at
Harvard'' show on WHRB (95.3 FM) on Saturday mornings.  It starts before I
get up and it ends about 1 or 1:30.  My wife has recently fallen for Irish
music big-time, and I don't mind Irish music, but it reminds me how much I
like more diversified folk/bluegrass/old-fashioned country.  The WHRB show
has a mix of all these styles and not too much that I don't enjoy listening
to.  It's always a mystery how modern country can be so bad when it's based
on something that was so good.
<i>((That's a great way of putting it, I completely agree.))</i>

<p>
You and Ian Moore discuss the prospect of the President's possibly 
having to resign because of sex.  
The thing I think you're missing is this:  if the president of a 
major U.S.&nbsp;corporation were faced with the same allegations
and evidence (or lack thereof) that Clinton is facing, he would 
almost certainly have been forced to resign by now.  
<i>((It's the law of the Street combined with the laws.
It is accepted that executives serve at the pleasure of the
board and are at risk every single day.
Presidential resignations, we hope, are a once in a century event.
Executive tenure is dropping through the floor in general.))</i>
Media pressure and current laws on sexual harassment and 
discrimination would make it almost impossible for him to keep his job.  
In almost any major company, a boss simply can't
have sexual relations with someone who works for him or her, 
whether the relationship is agreeable to both parties or not.  
So the issue is not whether Clinton should (in a reasonable country) 
have to resign, but whether he is getting a break because he's 
the President.
<i>((I think the question is whether he is getting a break because
he is a political executive as opposed to a corporate executive
and the answer surely is yes, but we don't subject our politicians
to the same structures as everyone else.
This works both for and against them, depending on the issue.))</i>

<p>
You know, I think the last issue of <i>Voice of Doom </i> was 
about 270 pages, not 100.  
I seem to remember it being about an inch thick.  
<i>((Really?
You're probably right, oh well....))</i>
If so, <i>TAP 200 </i> might not be a record-breaker.  
Maybe I'm remembering incorrectly, though.
<i>((Other comments on that?
Also, the open page model gets more words on a page than digest
or other reduced models.))</i>

Hi Jim, 
Congratulations on reaching #200!
A great issue, I just finished actually reading it from
cover to cover (took me four days on and off).

<p>
Flad you made it to Diplomatic Incident IX.
It's always fun to have you in a game and you did a great job 
rorming up that disparate group for a last stand.
<i>((I would have done a better job of it if I hadn't had
my eye on the clock, since I said I was going to leave at
``dinner time''.
With extra time, I think I could have worked my way into 
contention.))</i>
Unfortunately you had the harder task coordinating the
tactics of that group while Pitt and I were clicking.
<i>((Working with Jack Sinnott is always an adventure,
but one I had decided from relatively early on I was 
going to try to cultivate.
I kept John Q-V pretty much off balance too!
I thought it was a good game for me, despite the outcome.))</i>
It's an interesting facet of playing with (perhaps I should
say against as it usually ends up that way and is the
correct context) you that your actions and machinations
with other players is usually what keeps me from making
the moves that you are indicating you'd like to see from me.
It was certainly that way in this game, you did more than anyone
else to keep the N/G alliance going.
<i>((In Loeb 9, I was Spain....))</i>
I know that that was a balancing act on your part as you feared
a Norwegian solo if I did stab, and of course the chance for
that is the only reason I'd have tried the stab.
<i>((I was trying very hard to find the knife edge where you
would actually stab, but it would be the wrong move.... having
you stab Pitt when it was the right move wouldn't have been
much of a challenge.
I could easily have done that, but I couldn't quite locate that
grey zone.
Then again, maybe you're too good ever to fall for that ;-) ))</i>
Anyway, I enjoyed the game.

<p>
Lots of interesting music reviews although I have to say I've never 
heard of most of the bands you discuss.
Plug them a few more times though and I'll actually have to see if the 
local library has any Mekon CDs.
<i>((Lots of people have mentioned that they are falling over 
that line lately.
It'll be interesting what feedback I get from that.
The Mekons have their own sort of musical language and they seldom
are very ``pretty'', though they take a stab at that too when it
suits their purpose.
Anyway, I expect some people to fall in love and get hate mail from
others.
If you find it in the library, that will be the low risk method.
There still is no doubt in my mind that they are the greatest 
rock and roll band still going for four main reasons: (1) They
are poor and don't sell lots of records - though some relatively
well off artists manage to maintain their roots, there is a fundamental
disconnect that disqualifies bands like the Rolling Stones, REM, and U2
from the running; (2) They have a core liberal non-corporate philosophy
that they actually live and believe in - let's face it, music is a 
business and many bands are corporations; 
(3) They are close to their fans and the people - when they come through
for concerts you can actually talk to them, they hang around after the
concerts, they bring people up on stage to dance with them during 
concerts, all those things that have made each Mekons concert I have
attended a truly special event; and 
(4) They engage you with their songs in a way that simply grabs you
and won't let go.))</i>

<p>Hope you're well as we ride around another iteration of a major 
cycle affecting Earthlife. 
Things have gotten much better for me lately.

<p>
I only heard about four live concerts in 1997, and not much new
recorded music.
Best show was Lick the Marmot, one of the last performances
by these Yellowstone employees, at the rec hall at Lake Lodge
in May.
Hot Tomato and Dexter Grove were very good.
I've described the first two bands in previous years.
Dexter Grove is a creative, somewhat Phish-like band 
working imaginative guitar and keyboard stuff over polyrhythmic
conga/bongo foundations.
Good interaction among the musicians and great grooves.
Worst was Sonic Rangers at Mammoth's Survivors' Party.
Three kids out of some garage who played maybe one 
interesting song all night amid rather basic renderings
of formulaic '80s pop-rock.
The party actually picked up and people danced more after 
the band shut down and the stereo was turned on.

<p>
Since I attended no commercial concerts, I'll defer to my new 
housemate Craig Aldinger, whose comments are enclosed.
Yay!

I suppose this comes under the heading of ``enclosed comments''
but at this hour of the morning with a dog whining in my face
requiring exit it could just as easily be called canine slavery...

<p>
Whatdafux?
Oh yeah - an overview of live music.
Surprisingly, Bozeman, Montana plays host to quite the variety
of acts.
Probably the most memorable were back-to-back Widespread Panic
(READ: widespread buttcheeks; thanks Willi Gallinac....) shows 
a study in contrasts, first night - tight and hot - all original 
tunes; second night - loose and groovin' - several cover tunes
including `Dear Mr. Fantasy' and Van ``the Man'' Morrison's
`Brown Eyed Girl'.

<p>
Also, fresh from a European tour, Wilco (Uncle Tupelo, Son Volt -
same crew) $30,000 worth of collectors item guitars on stage -
hate to have their insurance bills!

<p>
Shows seen in the Emerson Cultural Center, an old redbrick school
probably dating to the 1930's with an old-style auditorium/stage 
setup that holds 1,000 people max.
We sat in the balcony for the W.P. shows and there was a tapehead
who had a rubber chicken wedged in between his microphones a
few seats down from us both nights..... got a half-assed live
tape of the second show/second set out of it.

Jim, ta for <i>TAP</i> 200, turned up yesterday.                             
                                                                 
I've answered in my obligatory letter but I got the Jonatha
Brooke off of a tribute album to Laura Nyro. I liked the song so
much it got on my annual best of tape.                           
<i>((As did I, wow!))</i>              
                                                   
I'm sure it wasn't me who put you on to Melissa Ferrick but Mark
Wightman. He would very much like that album. The Erin McKeown
sounded interesting ............... hint.         
<i>((Mark it was, I think.
Sorry about that.
I should do something about Erin, shouldn't I.
Something will happen on that.))</i>

I'm puzzled as  to  why  they reckon British authorities can't  judge
weight! No there were no problems. Couldn't see why there would be.                                         
Yeah I don't what's happened with Air mail, I got <i>Off the Shelf</i> even 
faster before many US subbers!! Nice to  see Tom has  his priorities
right.                                                               
                                                                     
I'm not certain who is going to be most insulted me or Mark over you 
confusing us. I'm the honest reliable one he's the stabbing git - even
his friends agree on that.                                       
<i>((All right, I got the idea, I made a mistake, OK?))</i>    
                                                                     
Ah well if John was making fun  of  me  then that's alright then. I'd
like to make fun of some of Brad Martin's American subbers but I think
they lack a sense of humour. I'm afraid I  just don't understand this
American fascination with guns and killing people.                   
<i>((That's OK, I do in theory, but not in practice.))</i>                                        
                             
Oh  in your reply in <i>TAP</i> 200 (thank god that unlike Kent you didn't
include your love letters!!) you say you feel you've discussed this 
subject any number of times. I'd  ask  you  to bear in mind that your

Jim, I  get  a magazine called folk roots and  I know they don't regard
women  singer  song writers  as  folk singers. Oh  a contender for
album of  the year  is Texas - <i>White on Blonde</i>. 
I look forward to your dissection of the tape.  
And confusing me and Wightman is unforgiveable.                                                    
<i>((Point, game, set, and match!))</i>                 
                                                 
My comment about guns took on  a  new poignancy with the shootings
in Arkansas. Now I know that such atrocities happen in the UK  but
I  read somewhere (Bryson I think) that  more people get killed on
US school grounds than in London. I don't know about you  but that
kind of statistics scares the willies out of  me. How  on Earth do
kids of that age get hold of that quantity of guns.               
<i>((Relatively easily.
Essentially, the problem is this.
In rural areas/small towns in this country the guns always have been
left just lying around.
This in houses that traditionally would not even be locked, so if
ANYONE wanted to get guns they could.
But then, the small town had everyone watching everyone and there 
was a small town culture that was isolated and ``wholesome''.
Now, kids in these small towns hear the same music, see the same
videos, wear the same clothes, use the same drugs as everyone else.
This makes the guns really dangerous.))</i>                                      
                            
Yeah  I'll  read  the  zine carefully. You'll probably  set  us  a
written test for next issue!!                                    
<i>((Not me, I don't do those sorts of things.
If I have tests or quizzes they have to be REALLY obscure, like my
favorite old 17th Century cultural quizzes.))</i> 
                                                                
I  just  find  the different styles between US  and  UK players so
different Americans tend to be more adventurous.

Strong Vincent's memorial is on Route 97 in downtown Waterford, Pennsylvania,
12 miles south of Erie. Its one of those little historical plaques indicating
his birthplace. I pass by it every time I go to my in-laws. 
My wife went to high school in Waterford. 
There is also a Strong Vincent High School in Erie.
The 83rd Pennsylvania (Vincent's regiment before his promotion to 
brigade command after Fredricksburg) was recruited from Erie County, PA.

I'm not sure that Waterford is worth making a pilgrimage to anymore. 
The only thing there of historical significance is the 
site of old Fort Le Beouf; where a young Lieutenant Colonel of Virginia
Militia named George Washington was ordered to toss the French out 
in 1759. The fort is gone; nothing left but a plaque and a small museum.

How 'bout those Rams?  We saw only the last minute of the game as 
they were showing us UCLA downing Michigan, but they were giving 
constant reports/scores from the game.  I of course thought of you 
every time.  I had no idea Harrick was there.

Rhode Island is a little state and a tough recruiting sell to
basketball players.
As soon as Harrick resurrects his reputation, he'll be off 
somewhere too.
We just have to live with it...
Having two senior guards is the standard way to build upset 
potential in the NCAA's as history shows.
I've been touting Tyson Wheeler's quickness since his freshman
year in this szine - he's as quick as Allen Iverson!
Now, we'll see if he can take his quickness to the NBA.
Cuttino Mobley is pretty good too.))</i>

Hiya, Boob:
I ended up with the flu again, so I'm home. 
I just might even watch the URI-Stanford game. 
I'm a little ticked that Valpo got beat because UB (aka the
State University of New York at Buffalo) plays in the 
Mid-Continent with Valpo and the conference gets money from the 
NCAA depending on how far you can go.
The Mid-Continent hasn't gotten much money out of the dance. 
We won't even mention how little the A-10 or the MAAC is 
getting this year. The most irritating thing that I read was a 
comment by Valpo's coach after they beat Florida State. 
It went something like, ``We have 3500 students. They have 30,000. 
For a school like us to beat a school like them is quite an
accomplishment." He must have forgotten that they have UB in 
their conference, which has pretty much the same numbers. 
They just don't have the athletic tradition. 
They actually TEACH their students. Imagine that!!! 

<p>

<center>Rich Goranson, ForlornH of aol.com</center><br>

<p>
<i>((Yeah, imagine that.
I know about UB, my brother went there.
There is a basketball tradition in Buffalo, of course, it just
historically is with Niagara and Canisius.
URI beating Valpo was great for the locals, but we missed some
of our ``Cinderella'' identification since the announcers and
the media had dubbed Valpo the great story.))</i>

So tonight's the big night.  Since reading your comments about 
senior guards winning the NCAA tournament, I've heard similar 
comments from the announcers, and specifically that tonight's game 
will be a great guard match up.
     
Too bad about Baron Davis and UCLA.  I couldn't bring myself to 
root for Maryland last night, not even for Dick Martin's sake.  AZ 
and UCLA, being the closest geographically, are my picks.  And 
I'll always root for a team west of the Mississippi over one from 
the East.  Unless URI keeps going.

<p>

<center>Keith, Keith_Sherwood of intuit.com</center><br> 

<p>
<i>((Alas, it was not to be.
I, of course, saw the earlier games, but for the loss to Stanford,
I only saw the very last minute, which was really depressing...
still, it was a great tournament, the best in years.
The balance of the szine didn't permit my usual (bad) predictions.
I did predict that Kentucky would meet North Carolina in the
final, which nearly happened.
It would have been nice had URI joined them in San Antonio!
I figured out what great teams would be upset, but not always who
would upset them.
My best predictions in years and they didn't make the szine!!))</i>

<center>GAME OPENING INFORMATION</center><br> 

<p>
<p>Vincent Mous' Modern Diplomacy ten player variant
starts in this very issue.
There are about 50 supply centers and it is set across a map 
slightly more expansive than the original's European map.
The game is set to start in 1995 and I will go with that date.
All rules are as in the original Diplomacy rules with the Suez
Canal allowing passage of fleets and a weird canal running 
from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea through Rostov and Volga.
See the map in the postal version of this issue.
Internet types can look at the map through the Diplomatic Pouch's archive.
Sorry about the quality of the map, it is the best one I can find
(and I assure you I spent hours looking).
I remind you again to look at Chris Warren's evaluation of the 
powers' starting positions in <i>Diplomacy World</i> #83.
Ask Doug Kent for a back issue by writing him at the address
listed with the Zine Register game - I'm sure he'd send you
the issue for three bucks.

<p>
Conrad von Metzke recently finished GMing a black hole game where
you can freely jump over black holes instead of having
them render spaces impassible.
I played in this game and like the tactics of jumping
over the black holes a great deal.
Now there the black holes were random, but what would happen if you
could plan them?
The next NYEED game will feature this rule change and 
will be a 7x7 tourney format unless I am convinced otherwise.
I am itching to get this game started, so it will start as soon
as it is filled!
You get a life of game sub, and the game itself is FREE!! 
Sandy Kenny, Mike Barno,
John Schultz, and Harry Andruschak are signed up.
Off an offhanded suggestion in the NYEED press, we'll call it
Nelson Mandela.
Just three more and we'll get started!
Come on, this one will be REALLY exciting!!

<p>
I also would really like to open a game of Breaking Away.
Is there any interest at all??
Well, John Schultz and the game's designer John Harrington
are interested.
Others??
You don't need to own the game to play, I'm going to use 
Keith Thomasson's house rules that include the ``how to play the game.''
I printed Keith's rules a few issues back, but some of the shaded parts
didn't reproduce properly.
I'll print the rules properly if I get a bit more interest in the game.
I thank John Harrington for encouraging me in this.

<p>(YOU ONLY NEED TO LEAD THE FINAL LAP TO WIN): Success often
depends on timing.
As Agesilaus, who lived from 444 to 400 B.C., pointed out:
``It is circumstance and proper timing that give an action
its character and make it either good or bad.''

<p>
(THIS GAME OBSERVES THE ``ghodstoo'' GAME): ``Have you noticed
that the most subtle shedders of blood have almost always been the
most civilized gentlemen?''
(Fyodor Dostoyevsky, <i>Notes from the Underground</i>)

<p>
(BUDDY-CLINTON): Am I really the one who needs to be neutered?

<p>
(HARRY'S ENDGAME STATEMENT): Not much to say.
My tit-for-tat strategy did not change for the entire game and still
resulted in a respectable score.
Which is the whole point of tit-for-tat.... not so much on getting
the best score as not getting the worst score.
Again, note how narrow the point spread actually was after 7 rounds.
Indeed, the 7x7 format results in an entirely different game
from the one-shot version.
Perhaps the GM might consider offering both versions in the future.
<i>((For now, 7x7 is it... I like it better in being different.
I think I'll like the ``skipping over the holes'' version even better.))</i>

<p>
Nothing to do with the game or the zine, but I need to brag about
my vacation last month on the Windjammer MANDALAY.
It was a superb 14 day cruise on a genuine 3 masted barquentine, and
along the way we were able to view the total solar eclipse, lasting
3 minutes 18 seconds.
I also celebrated 14 years of sobriety.
Probably the best vacation I have ever been on.

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The game was set up by random draw according to player preference.
I have named it (since it is a ``modern'' game) after the best album
by that most modern of bands, the Mekons.
For a ``quote'' of the game, we will get a selection from a Mekons
song with the press for each season.

<p>
2) As is traditional in getting games started in this szine, you
get three deadlines to get acquainted.
Both of those Autumn and Winter deadlines will accept press.
The first moves are due with Spring on Memorial Day weekend.
Note that puts the deadline on World DipCon weekend.
I will probably be there and not work on the szine until I return.
I last printed the house rules a few issues ago when I started
Show Me the Money.
I can E-Mail or Mail them to anyone who needs to see them.

<p>
3) Standbys for this game are the three who didn't get into the
game: Brad Wilson, Jack McHugh, and Paul Kenny.

<p>
4) This game is very popular on the Judges and has been written
about by Chris Warren in <i>Diplomacy World</i> #83.
This map is the best one I can find. 
There is a bitmapped version in the zipped map archive that
you can get through the Diplomatic Pouch and the Cal Tech archive.
But that one isn't particularly attractive either.
You get what follows as a key precisely ONCE.
Copy it down however you need to on the maps so you get your
orders right.
Ask questions, if you have any, now. 
Consider yourself WARNED.
I expect to have problems and it is your responsibility to
get it right.
I'm not trying to be difficult, just realistic.

quiet summer.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(TIM RICE QUOTE OF THE MONTH): ``I know I'm the best there is, 
but all they want is a show. 
Alright, I'll be glad to oblige..." -  ``Merano" from <i>Chess</i>

<p>
(HOLLAND): The Dutch government would like to extend 
apologies for its silence of late.  
The good news is that the job search goes well.  The bad news
is that I'll continue to be busy for at least two months more.
 
(TIM RICE QUOTE OF THE MONTH II): ``I'm not the kind to be vindictive,
holding some childish grudge. 
How could I be? I'm in the spotlight, half of the world my judge." -
``Florence Quits'' from <i>Chess</i>

<p>
(BRITAIN-CHINA): You have reminded everyone on the board, 
including myself, that I am at eleven, 
but you must not have reminded yourself, as you have done
everything you can to pick a fight with me. 
You are afraid of my eleven dots, but want nothing more than 
to fight them? Remember, once you start taking Lithium, 
you have to take it every day! Jim, get another straitjacket please. 

<p>
(CHINA-BRITAIN): You should be playing in Tim Lurz' szine. 
I hope that you get everything that you deserve. 

<p>
(TURKEY to BRITAIN AND CHINA): It's just amazing that you 
two dance at all!

<p>
(BRITAIN-HOLLAND): I must admit, the ``press" comments did confuse me. 
I thought you were telling me you were going to write 
insulting press, when you were only writing insulting letters. 
That's a big difference. 

<p>
(H-B): My moves are precautionary.  
Why is it that I think they are necessary?

<p>
(CHINA-HOLLAND): It's better than it looks. Trust me...

<p>
(H-J): Yeah, I know I owe you a letter.  I imagine at some point we'll
discuss those islands.

<p>
(CHINA-FRANCE): Now we shall see who is right...and who is dead.

<p>
(FRENCH FOREIGN LEGIONNAIRE to CANTONESE WAITER AS HE IS HANDED A BOX
OF BODY PARTS): ``Merci beaucoup for General TSO's chicken "

<p>
(CHEF -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> KATHIE LEE GIFFORD): Oh, Kathie Lee, you are 
my sexual FAN-TA-SY!
 
(CHINA-RUSSIA): He shall not get further inland. 

<p>
(BOOB to CHINA): Oh, you are Kathie Lee's knight in shining armor?

<p>
(VERUKA SALTZ -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> WILLY WONKA): I want an Oompa-Loompa NOW!

<p>
(F-H): delicious cheesey poofs in the Philippines...
 
(CHINA-JAPAN): Next time you attack a home centre next to one of mine, 
I'd sure like to know about it first. 

<p>
(WALLY - BEAV): Care to dance with the Devil in the Pale Moonlight?
 
(CHINA-TURKEY): I don't know how you can handle all this 
stress with no opposing units anywhere near any of yours. 

<p>
(GRASSHOPPER -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> TOADFATHER): Master, where do all of those fleets go?
 
The Colonial Office-London: The undersecretary was in a quandary. His thoughts
tumbled in his head, making and breaking alliances like underpants in a dryer
without Cling Free. Should he stab the French? Should he gut the Chinese?
Should he eviscerate the Dutch? Should he swallow up the Russians? He
possessed the mightiest forces in Asia but he had expanded too quickly,
earning the enmity of all the great powers. The whole scene had an eerie,
surreal quality, like when you're on vacation in another city and "Jeopardy"
comes on at 7 p.m. instead of 7:30. And while he plotted the domination of
Asia the words of Charlemagne kept rolling through his head, like a song that
had gotten stuck there and only a good bottle of Glenfiddich could remove,
"But if the fates feel frivolous, and all our plans they smother. Well,
suppose this war does shrivel us? There'll always be another..."

<p>
(PRESIDENT REAGAN -<font face="symbol"> &gt; </font
> RUSSIA): Your country has been declared an 
outlaw state.  Bombing will begin in fifteen minutes.
 
(SCULLY - MULDER WHO?): Who is going to control the growing 
British Invasion?  Even I can't help being infected... 
Help it's starting again ``Love Love me do, I'll always be true, 
so pleeeease... stop them Brits. It is that mind control
thing Mulder and I believe the French, and Russian leaders may be 
under this awful alien influence. 
But I think that Sultan has fought off the mind control for now.

<p>
(BOOB to SCULLY): I wouldn't be so sure...

<p>
(PRESS): from Robert Jordan series <i>The Wheel of Time</i>
``The Wheel of Time turns, and ages come and pass leaving memories 
that become legend, then fade to myth, and are long forgot when 
ages come again. In one age, called the Third Age by some, 
an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose"... 
from the South China Sea... ``The wind was not the beginning.
There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of 
the Wheel of Time.  But it was a beginning." 
Of what we may but speculate. Could it be the downfall of an Emperor? 
The start of a strong and lasting New World Order?
Alas we poor mortals are not privy to this knowledge. 
Yet I do hear the sound of war throughout the world - Roland
 
(RICK'S REMARKS): Just registered for my first World DipCon.  
Hope to see some of y'all there.

<i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) In case anyone can't figure it out, the game goes on.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE ALLIES): I must congratulate the Empires
of Germany, France, and yes, Austria.
Fate has turned a most twisted tale upon us all.
Germany now humbled as I know only too well.
Austria fighting valiantly and then suddenly she falls
while sleeping.
Of France?
What can I say?
The future will surely tell....
Let us continue fighting to the bitter end.

<p>
(VOCABULARY TIME): The quiz for this month is the origin of the phrase, 
``to the bitter end."  
(Hint:  There's nothing bitter about it.)

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH to SAN DIEGO): I finally decided to knuckle under 
and buy some tax software.  
You have no idea how difficult it was for me to patronize your 
employer and get Turbotax.  Almost like I'm perpetuating
your income stream.

<p>
(THE LIVERPOOL UNDERGROUND to THE WORLD): It has been related 
to us from the Prime Minister of Britain that the infamous
Mike Barno has been safely smuggled to the colony of New
Carthage and at present is doing quite well....

<p>
(CALHAMER to PRESS GHOSTWRITER):  Since when am I dead?

<p>
(FORMER BUTLER OF THE GREAT CZAR OF RUSSIA): It may be 
true that he is victorious battle after battle, but I 
know he is bitter about his loss of prestige among his
contemporaries.
If he had only continued to write.
He no longer seems to be a diplomat.

<p>
(RUSSIA-GM): Okay, I pick France to NMR this turn.
 
(BOOB to KEITHER): Dead wrong, everyone checked in.
    
(RUSSIA-BOARD): In a change of pace, I go arch conservative and 
challenge you to steal two centers from me.

<p>
(AMBASSADOR POLLARD to THE WORLD): Since today is a Holiday I wish
everyone a Happy Saint Patrick's Day!!!
I do realize most of you are not of the British Commonwealth,
but as you can see Britain is becoming quite the melting pot
(I do hope the Army which is Russian treats Scotland with the
utmost of respect).
As for me, I intend to travel to the United States and vacation
in Southern Utah for several weeks.
Perhaps I can enlist the aid of the United States and bring
freedom back to my homeland...  

<p>
(VON STEUBEN to WELSHMAN): Not unawares, exactly; it was more like
Luke's seeing an opportunity to pick up a dot, 
oblivious to the fact that he needs to focus on Sherwood's dots.  
I guess you could say they caught me undermanned.
<i>((But you will admit that build will come in handy in defending
against the ``lost unit'' if it wanders south.))</i>
        
(ADMIRAL LANGWORTHY to BARON VON STEUBEN): OLE chap.
I sent you a shipload of rum, not a shitload (Forgive the typo...).
Since the ``Processor'' is no longer residing in Yellowstone I
shall challenge you to the great game of ``Titan''.
As Mike Barno put it, ``To death and the decomposition of their
component particles!!!''

<p>
(RUSSIA-FRANCE): Did you catch the coded hint in last season's press 
that I was leaving Denmark open?

<p>
(EDINBURGH to THE RUSSIAN NAVY): Come in!
Bring ye spirits!
Vodka and haggis for all1
We will celebrate the buttkickin of the French!
Our day will come agin!

<p>
(EMMERT to POLLARD): If I were you, I wouldn't take abuse from 
a nonplayer like Barno.  
I think you should insist on being abused only by players, like I do.  

<p>
(P.S. TO JIM-BOB): And you, too.  
Wouldn't want to keep you from abusing me.

<p>
(BOOB to BEACHED LAWYER): Oh sure, I'll abuse you, but not here.
Paris is burning in a parallel universe and there I shall respond.
Some Marquis of Queensbury you turned out to be!

<p>
(POLLARD SPEAKS): That picture of Mike is great!
Does he really look like that representation of him?

1) The game specific standby list for this game includes
Garret Schenck, Cathy Cunning Ozog, Mike Mills, Dick Martin, 
Vince Lutterbie, and Eric Brosius
in reverse alphabetical order (note that Garret is presently
missing...).
Guest press from potential standbys would be a ``good thing''
if they wanted to be chosen.

<p>
2) Anyone failing to submit press for two consecutive 
turns will be dropped from the game!
Although press in this szine is generally black, I will make the
exception here that I will say who has NPRed and is ``at risk''
for being dropped. 
This requirement is back this time and EVERYONE is on the bubble.
Send press with your fall orders, or else!
Whoops.... except for Paul and Doug!

<p>
3) The EFGT and EFT draws are rejected.

<p>
1) Time for everyone to tell me what to do with their leftover NMR
insurance (see the balances up above).  Hank and Ed are 
the only ones here not in other games.  Those of you in other
games will automatically have your balances transferred there.
The default for Hank and Ed is that your balances go 
toward sub fees until they run out, starting with issue #202.

<p><br><p><br><i>Endgame and Other Assorted Comments</i>

<p>
<p>
<center>Official EOG for Friedrich Nietzsche from Sultan Dave</center><br>

<p>
The first thing I remember about this game was that in an idle moment
I had come up with a wonderful blitzkrieg that could be implemented by
an RAT alliance so I asked Jim to give me Turkey.
He replied that the draw was random and I'd just have to play.... Turkey!
With that good omen I was off and thought I might even get a chance
to try the RAT.
Ha!
Not a very adventurous bunch, so it was back to the old standards.
There were a fair number of letters exchanged before the opening 
moves and by the time they had ended I had formed definite opinions
about my neighbors.

<p>
Ed was a solid player, going to be very good and I'd have to keep 
an eye on him but he was going to play it square at the beginning.
Jonas had written some rather encouraging things, but I couldn't
trust any of them.
He was going to come south full steam and the only thing that would call 
him off was an Italian stab.

<p>
Don.
Well, before I get to game impressions I have to make a general 
comment here.
His opening letter was the single best opening Diplomacy letter I 
have ever received and the follow ups were equally exceptional.
He didn't just propose a set of moves, he analyzed, theorized,
explored different avenues, and all in a pleasant style.
I'll skip ahead right now and say that somewhere down the line
something went astray.
Don alludes to this in his EOG, commenting on my thinking he had
been unsportsmanlike.
Not owning a computer, I don't have copies of my letters and I 
don't recall what could have sparked this.
I do remember that his sudden broadside in the press months after
the fact caught me completely by surprise.
No need to hash it all out in public, but I want to state for the 
record that in no way do I consider Don to have been unsportmanlike.
He's a fine player and a credit to the game and I'm glad to have
played with him.

<p>
So, back to the game.
Lengthy discussions with Don about an I/T certainly made it seem 
possible but he wasn't going to his Austria at the start and in the end
my mistrust for Austrian intentions pushed me towards the R/T
(I also have to admit that I had never played an R/T as Turkey
before and still can't really say that I have!).
The fleet move to Con had a much stronger effect on Don than 
I had hoped and it seemed that we were doomed to R/T vs. A/I,
and not only that, but R/T vs. an aggressive and savvy I.
There were a number of things that A/I might have tried in the fall.
I actually expected TYO to move to BOH, but in any case there was
nothing to be served by leaving the army in Smyrna and while the
standard move would be to shuffle it to Con, the risk of the bounce
was not worth the gain.
With Russia coming into the Black to provide the extra support if needed
the turn delay would not be a big deal anyway.

<p>
1901 ended with Russia having no builds and I was actually reasonably
happy with the position.
A smaller Russia with trouble in the north was less likely to stab.
The Italian ``stab'' was obviously just a ploy (If only Ed
had tried for Vie instead of Bud, or better yet, let Jonas into Rum!)
but I still saw a real possibility of working with Don.
I thought the unorthodoxness of an I/T appealed to him.
I knew that I would have to make the first real move, committing against
Russia to make it happen, but I was prepared to do that in a year or two.
Then came my downfall.
A single mistake that I could never recover from.
Somehow I convinced myself in Spring 02 that Jonas would not attack Bul.
Why or how is lost in the depths of my mind.
If it was due to his efforts, then my hat is off to him, it was a 
masterful ploy.
Turkish hopes died with my army in Bul, because it was coupled with
the even worse news that the pressure was off Russia in the north.
As an R/T alliance we still had a solid defensible line, but growth
was going to be slow or non existent and I was now at the mercy of
my Russian ally who not only was free to concentrate on the south but had
spare units to play with.

<p>
Ed restrained himself for a while, but as expected, growth was stagnant
and I just couldn't spare a unit for interior defense without collapsing
my line against Don.
When the stab came it was of course a blow, but it was also a release in
a way.
Now I had a new focus, revenge!
It was a whole new ball game and I could exercise my Diplomatic skills
again as I tried to convince Don of the benefits of keeping me alive.
I concentrated all my efforts on Don as his units were the ones that
could make or break me and as I felt he was the dominant partner in
A/I and if I convinced him he'd pull Jonas along.

<p>
My efforts were successful as I was convincing (and honest at the time!)
in selling Don on the idea that revenge against Russia was all I wanted
and that my units were his for the asking.
The strings of puppetdom did not last forever however and for two
specific reasons.

<p>
I was always honest in my assertions to Don that I waas an ally for the game and that all I wanted was to be cut loose and aimed at Russia.
I had no intention of doing anything else and would have followed
that policy to the end, angling of course to be a part of an I/T
draw if possible, but probably not turning on Don.
However, I am not really suited to puppetdom.
I need to <i>play</i> if I am in the game.
Don on the other hand seemed to want a docile puppet.
He seemed to be more concerned about the dangers of a resurgent
Turkey than about bringing Russia down.
An effective offensive against Russia required a Turkish build
but this Don would not countenance.

<p>
It was a pity because I feel that we could have made great strides, but
Don was leery of his creation and in keeping a tight rein he slowly
turned the lust for revenge against Russia into a desire to break the
strings.
There were so many opportunities to strike back at Russia, yet at each turn
it was Italy, my ally, who ended up between me and my goals.

<p>
This finally led to my shifting sides again.
Both a desire to make something happen and a feeling that Don was going
to give in to his misgivings soon and take my centers anyway.
With quick dispatch, Don removed any possibility of a Turkish
resurrection by allying with Ed and the decline that started in '02 was
finally complete.

<p>
As to the rest of the board, I never really got a chance to interact
with them.
I exchanged some nice letters with John and had some fun with him in the
press.
I admit to some feelings of dissatisfaction with the ending as I thought
France played a tad passively and could easily have had the win or at least a good shot at it a number of times, but then again my failing is usually
that I play too aggressively and any game that you are happy with in
the end is a good game, and while my derriere is sore from kicking
myself over Spring 02, I'm more than happy with the game as it had 
a lot of great Diplomacy.

<p>
My apologies to Jim if we didn't keep up to standards with our press.
There was so much going on behind the scenes that it was hard to
remember to play for the audience as well.
Thanks for your active and encouraging GMing though.

<p>
<i>((You're quite welcome.
You're also right that I strongly considered kicking your derrieres right
out of the szine.
This was easily the smallest press output of any game that I ever started 
in the szine itself, not counting the orphans.
And if you subtract out my press, it was positively miniscule.
You and John at times held things up, but it was pretty pathetic.
One would think it was just another E-Mail game ;-)
Seriously, though, I was following the deep machinations behind
the scenes well enough to call this a pretty damned good little
Diplomacy game.
I welcome last end game statements from anyone else, but I expect
next time to close this one out.
Thanks!))</i>

<p><br><p><br><i>Game Notes:</i>

<p>
1) The FG draw has been rejected.
Hmmm, there is no repeat of the proposal.

<p>
<p><br><p><br><i>Press:</i>
 
(GERMANY to FRANCE):  Have at thee, villain.
  
(PARIS to BERLIN):  If I had wanted you for an enemy, you would have 
been crushed long ago.  My friends come in ``second".
     
(VIRGINIA BEACH to PROVIDENCE): There is a cause of action for 
definition of character, or something like that.  
Have to go look that one up, but I don't think you can recover much.  
Go ahead; sue me if you can.
<i>((I'm getting an engineer....))</i>

<p>
(JAMES (THE ENGINEER) to EMMERT (THE LAWYER): An engineer died and 
showed up at the pearly gates, but St. Peter said ``your name isn't 
on the list - you have to go to hell".  
The engineer did as he was told and went down to hell.  
He immediately started fixing all the problems with hell and within  
a month had installed air conditioning, ice cream makers, and other 
items to make life bearable.  
Before too long life was getting good in hell and St. Peter heard 
about it. St Peter called up the devil and said ``I made a 
mistake, that engineer was supposed to be in heaven."  
The devil responded that he didn't care and there was no way 
he was going to let the engineer go up to heaven.  
St. Peter replied ``if you don't let the engineer go to 
heaven, then I will have no choice but to sue you".  
To which the devil replied ``oh, and just where do you 
think you will find a lawyer!?"
     
(EMMERT to BOARD): You'll like this one.  
I'm now defending a suit for an injunction by a high school senior 
who wants his English comp grade raised from F to D so he can 
compete on the baseball team this spring. 
Says the teacher calculated his grade wrong.  (He turned in two papers
16 and 27 days late, but says he should have received the highest
possible ``F" score, a 59, instead of the zeroes the teacher gave him.) 
This is the extent of the advance of our civilization:  Students are now
suing the school boards over grades.  Is this a great country, or what?
<i>((Unfortunately, that is my story of the month....))</i>

<p>
(FRANCE to AUSTRIA):  How much to rent your army for a few turns?  
Russia is correct, I really could use just one more army in the East.

<p>
(G to AER): Well, are we in this thing together, or do we fight in 
a burning house?

<p>
(JAMES to SCHULTZ): Why are you rooting for Germany?  I made the game 
interesting again.  I gave you the breath of life again!  After all of 
you complaining about the triple, I rip it apart and then you root for 
the other guy?
       
(GERMANY to FRANCE): Why propose draw after draw, but not vote for
them? Showmanship?

<p>
(FRANCE to GERMANY): Who guessed right in the Ruhr?  My only goal was 
to not leave Munich open for a build.  How did I do? 

<p>
(BOOB to FRANCE): Pretty good, pretty good, but Germany didn't get
any builds....     
 
(STEVE to DREW): I half expect you'll move to swap Sevastopol for
Rumania.  I can deal with that, if that's what comes to pass.
  
(FRANCE to BOOB): I should have 17 within my grasp.  Could you give me 
a little help on the 18th and let me keep Sev?  
<i>((Nope.))</i>
It will be one less game for you to worry about every month.  
<i>((I can handle it.))</i>     

<p>
(GERMANY to BOOB): ``Knaves all" . . . ``Knaves all" . . . Hmmm.  
Is this a trick question?  
Or something from one of those games I've never played, like Titan?
Cribbage?  

<p>
(VIRGINIA BEACH): Somehow, I missed out on the desert island music 
list.  Is it too late to submit my own?  
<i>((Not at all, I didn't update mine yet.))</i>
(And would you prefer that I do so next time, to ease
your burdens somewhat?)
<i>((Well, that's where it is now, but it is up to you.))</i>
